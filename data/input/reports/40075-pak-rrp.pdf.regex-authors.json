Environmental impact assessments have \nAssessment  been  conducted  for  the  Peshawar\u2013Torkham  Expressway  (E-1) \nand Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal Expressway (E-4) projects. Summaries \nwere  disclosed  publicly  on  30  May  2006  and  4  April  2007, \nrespectively. \n   \nInvestment Program  Under the strategic framework \u201cVision 2030\u201d the Government of \nDescription  Pakistan  (the  Government)  plans  to  raise  the  trade  to  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) ratio from 30% to about 60%. This would \nbe equivalent to $600 billion by 2030. To achieve this target, key \nactions under the strategy will be improving trade competitiveness \nand export diversification. Logistics are currently seen as a key \nconstraint to raising competitiveness and attracting private sector \ninvestment. They are also a bottleneck to increasing productivity \nas well as to deepening and diversifying the industrial base both \nof which are necessary to provide sustainable jobs for a growing \npopulation. Several actions are planned or underway to address \nthe  logistics  and  investment  gap.  One  of  these  is  a \ncomprehensive road network investment program. An enhanced \nroad network will cut the time and cost of moving goods and \nservices  along  the  entire  logistical  chain.  Specifically,  the \nGovernment  intends  to  double  the  road  density  from \n0.32 kilometers  per  square  kilometer  (km/km2)  at  present  to \n0.64 km/km2  by  2030.  In  addition to  improvements  to  physical \ninfrastructure,  the  initiative  includes  meaningful  policy  and \ninstitutional  actions  aimed  at  providing  a  better  enabling \nenvironment for investment, for industrial diversification, and for \nthe logistics industry as a whole.  \n \nPakistan\u2019s  domestic  trade  flows  are  concentrated  in  one  major \nnorth\u2013south transport corridor. The proposed actions, while aimed \nat making this corridor more efficient, will also have a major and \nbroader impact on the performance of the entire transport sector \nand thus on the economy overall. This comprehensive approach is \nembodied in a special initiative called the National Trade Corridor \nImprovement Program (NTCIP). The Government views NTCIP as \na  key  success  factor  to  the  country\u2019s  growth  prospects,  to \ninclusiveness, to employment creation and social service renewal, \nand  to  the  execution  of  second  generation  sector  and \nmacroeconomic reforms. NTCIP represents a flagship endeavor by ", "ii   \nthe  Government  and  the  private  sector  to  bring  about  better \nconnectivity and trade facilitation. Beside roads, the initiative covers \nports, railways, airports, customs clearing procedures, tariffs, and \nthe trucking industry. The rationale for NTCIP is embedded in and \nemanates from plans for growth, job creation, and trade. When \nfully implemented, these efforts will save $5 billion\u20137.5 billion per \nannum that are currently lost because of inefficient logistics. The \nlatter  will  thus  increase  in  terms  of  its  contribution  to  GDP, \nbringing the country closer to other benchmark countries in Asia. \n \nThe  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  is  responsible  for  the \noperation, maintenance, and development of the national highway \nsystem. NHA manages 11,400 km of roads, of which 30% are \nalready toll roads. The efficiency of the road network has been \nconstrained by slow moving traffic, poor quality surfaces, and non-\nvehicular traffic. Currently, it takes 72 hours to travel between \nPeshawar  and  Karachi,  a  distance  of  about  1,700  km.  The \ninvestment  in  the  backbone  of  the  national  trade  corridor  is \nexpected to reduce this travel time to 36 hours after completion.  \n \nAs a core component of NTCIP, NHA has developed the National \nTrade  Corridor  highway  investment  plan  (NTC  highway \ninvestment plan). It covers the corridor backbone from Peshawar \nto Karachi and the outlying links that connect Pakistan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and Gwadar Port in Baluchistan. The \ninitiative  includes  not  only  new  road  construction  but  also  the \nimprovement  of  over  3,500  km  of  roads,  national  highways, \nexpressways,  and  motorways.  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) is an active partner of the Government in the road sector \nand  is  involved  in  policy  formulation  including  the  National \nTransport Policy. ADB is currently supporting the engagement of \nan advisor to formulate a national trade corridor strategy. In view \nof this long-standing relationship in the sector, the Government \nhas  approached  ADB  along  with  other  financing  agencies  to \nfinance the investment plan for the medium term. ADB\u2019s proposed \nshare of the NTC highway investment represents about 20% of \nthe total. Key sections of the motorway and expressway network \nwill  be  financed  through  the  National  Trade  Corridor  Highway \nInvestment Program (the Program), and key sections of highways \nwill  be  financed  through  the  National  Highway  Development \nSector  Investment  Program  (NHDSIP)  approved  in  2005.  The \nNTC highway investment plan has an estimated economic internal \nrate  of  return  of  39%  and  a  total  average  economic  savings \nestimated at PRs200 billion per year.  \n \nA road sector development framework (RSDF) was agreed with \nthe Government in 2005. This road map addresses major policy \nand  institutional  issues.  Some  targeted  milestones  have  been \ncompleted, others are on schedule, and some have faced delays. \nRSDF has been updated to reflect current concerns and lessons \nlearned from those delays and from other ADB projects in the ", "  iii\nsector.  The  sequencing  of  interventions  is  well  focused,  the \npackage of modalities includes private and public sector actions, \nand  the  policy  framework  is  defined  and  endorsed  by  the \nauthorities.  \n \nThe support components of the Program are needed not only for \nbest practice purposes in safeguards but also to underpin the \nreform momentum for the sector and for the RSDF. Specifically, \nunder the Program assistance will be provided to enable NHA\u2019s \nexperienced team to manage the expanded portfolio of assets \nplanned under the NTC highway investment plan. Various actions \nare also included to reinforce capacity development and thus the \nimplementation of the RSDF. The non-investment measures are \n(i) policy reforms and implementation, (ii) road management, (iii) \nhuman  resource  development  and  management  in  NHA,  (iv) \nproject  preparation  and  implementation,  (v) safeguards,  and  (vi) \nprivate sector participation. The support component is estimated to \ncost $12.5 million.  \n \nTo  advance  the  concept  of  industrial  diversification  and \ncommercial  activity  along  the  national  trade  corridor  and  to \nmaximize  traffic  flows,  a  framework  for  spatial  planning  and \ninvestment planning along the corridor is required. An NTC team \nwith representatives from the private sector (e.g., business groups \nand  chambers  of  commerce),  government  agencies,  and \nacademia will be established for this purpose. This team would \ncoordinate the development of an NTC highway business plan. \nADB  will  provide  a  technical  assistance  grant  of  $500,000 \nequivalent in conjunction with the Program to develop a business \nplan for the motorways and expressways between Peshawar and \nKhanewal. \n \nPrivate sector participation is an integral part of the RSDF. ADB is \nproviding support for private sector involvement in the road sector \nby pursuing pilot projects and advisory work. In this support and \nother interventions, ADB\u2019s private sector operations department \nand  public  sector  department  will  work  together  to  assist  the \nGovernment.  Pilot  projects  will  incorporate  lessons  learned  in \nstructuring  and  implementation  from  the  recent  public-private \npartnership (PPP) projects in the road sector in Pakistan. ADB will \nwork with the Government and NHA\u2019s private-public partnership \nunit to strengthen the approach to selecting, structuring, bidding, \nand negotiating PPP transactions.  \n \nMultitranche Financing  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  partially  finance  the \nFacility  investment  program  through  a  multitranche  financing  facility \n(MFF). The amount requested is $900 million. It will target parts of \nthe NTC highway investment plan related to expressways and \nmotorways over a 10-year period and represents 16.6% of the \noverall NTC highway investment plan. The MFF has a maximum \nutilization period of 10 years. Under the MFF, periodic financing \n ", "iv   \nrequests (PFRs) will be converted into separate loans. \n \nThe  Government  has  entered  into  a  framework  financing \nagreement  (FFA)  with  ADB  with  a  set  of  representations  and \nwarranties  related,  among  others,  to  technical,  operational, \nfinancial, safeguard, governance, capacity, and fiduciary oversight \nmatters. The FFA satisfies the relevant requirements for ADB\u2019s \npilot financing instruments and modalities. It will represent the \nbasis for ADB to monitor adherence to policies and procedures \nand best practices in key areas. \n \nThe MFF is the most suitable modality for ADB\u2019s intervention in \nthe NTC highway investment plan because of several key success \nfactors: (i) there is a strategic framework and strong economic \nrationale  for  the  NTC  in  general  and  for  the  road  network  in \nparticular,  (ii)  NHA  has  a  well-structured  investment  program \nblending physical and technical support components phased over \ntime and incorporating a range of interventions, (iii) the sector is \nunderpinned by the RSDF combining sector and thematic issues, \nand (iv) NHA has a phased implementation plan.  \n \nThe MFF blends project readiness with financial, technical and \nthematic considerations and enables ADB to maintain an active \npolicy dialogue throughout the life of the Program. ADB support \nfor the NTC highway investment plan builds the foundation for \nnetwork connectivity by providing financing for key road sections. \nThe MFF provides comfort to the private sector not only for those \nconsidering  investment  in  road  projects  but  most  of  all  for \nindustrial investment. Flexibility of timing and products under the \nMFF will ensure that the projects are structured to fit the existing \nmarket environment for PPPs and to maximize benefits to the \ncountry.  \n \nA program loan approach for the reform agenda is not appropriate \nsince disbursements for road construction cannot be conveniently \nlinked to satisfying policy conditions. A sector loan would have \nbeen  suitable  had  the  program  comprised  a  larger  number  of \nsmaller road sections, a scenario more typically associated with \nrural  road  networks.  Considering  the  need  to  fulfill  safeguard \nconcerns for larger projects, the time required to prepare projects \ncannot  be  constrained  by  financial  concerns.  A  sector  loan \ncommitting the entire amount for the investment plan at the outset \nwould leave NHA with a large contingent liability and undisbursed \nloan amount should extra time be needed to fully prepare the \nprojects and would also lead the Government to incur additional \ncommitment fees. \n \nThe Government has submitted the first PFR to ADB for a loan of \n$545 million to be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n(OCR). The package includes a loan of $10 million equivalent \nfrom  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources  to  fund  the ", "  v\nsupport components. The first PFR is presented to the ADB Board \nof Directors, together with this document and the FFA. \n \nRationale  The  Government  views  investment  and  trade  as  key  success \nfactors to growth, employment, inclusiveness, and overall poverty \nreduction.  Pakistan\u2019s  domestic  investment  and  trade  flows  are \nconcentrated  along  one  major  transport  corridor.  The  corridor \nconnects not only key business centers in the country but also \nconnects Pakistan to the outside world. It is a key exit route for \ntrade  coming  from  Central  Asia.  The  network  is  supported  by \nnational highways and feeder roads, ports, and airports, but the \nexpressway  backbone  network  is  incomplete.  The  proposed \nprogram targets the completion of this network.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  proposed  Program  is  derived  from  Pakistan\u2019s  long-term \ntransportation strategy and is an integral part of the NTCIP. The \nimpact of the Program will be trade growth and the outcome will \nbe  a  more  efficient  NTC  highway  network.  The  Program  will \nimprove  Pakistan\u2019s  competitiveness  and  link  the  country  more \neffectively to the outside world. It will also provide trade routes for \nothers in the region. \n   \nInvestment Program   The total investment cost of the NTC highway investment plan for \n2007\u20132014 is estimated at $5.36 billion. \n   \n  National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Plan \n  Program  Total \n  $ million  Share   $ million  Share \nGovernment  210  20%  1,632a  30% \nADB  890  80%  1,082b  20% \nOther IFIs or BFIs      1,547  29% \nOther      1,102  21% \nTotal  1,100  100%  5,363  100% \n         \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IFI = international financial institutions, BFI = bilateral \nfinancial  institutions,  NHDSIP  =  National  Highway  Development  Sector  Investment \nProgram, Program = National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program.  \na Government component for NTC includes roads to be financed by Water And Power \nDevelopment Authority. \nb 16.6% from the Program and 3.4% from NHDSIP  \nSource: Asian Development Bank and National Highway Authority estimates. \n \n  Tranche 1 \n($ million) \n  Projects (OCR)  Program Support (ADF) \nAmount  Share  Amount  Share \nADB  545  77%  10.0  80% \nGovernment  164  23%  2.5  20% \nTotal  709  100%  12.5  100% \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital \nresources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n ", "vi   \n \nMultitranche Financing  The maximum financing amount available under this MFF is $900 \nFacility\u2013Amount and  million.  The  MFF  comprises  $890  million  from  OCR  and  $10 \nTerms  million equivalent from ADF resources. The MFF is designed to \nfinance  part  of  the  NTC  highway  investment  plan  through \nindividual  loans.  The  first  tranche  will  be  funded  from  OCR \nresources, and the ADF loan will also be provided to address non-\nphysical investment needs and the support component. \n \nFinancing from OCR resources will be subject to interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The first tranche loan will have \na repayment period of 25 years including a grace period of 5 \nyears, and an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.35%; and \nconversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the \nterms of the FFA, the loan regulations, and other such terms as \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Financing from \nADF resources will be in Special Drawing Rights equivalent to $10 \nmillion have an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter and a \nrepayment period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. \n \nThe Government will make the proceeds of the loans available to \nNHA upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \nDepending  on  market  conditions  for  possible  public\u2013private \npartnership initiatives, the proposed MFF provides ADB with the \nflexibility to provide loans and guarantees for amounts counter-\nguaranteed by NHA and the Government for commercial loans or \nequity investment by NHA in project companies. \n  \nDisbursement  The individual loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). \n   \nAllocation Terms  The Government will provide the funds under the Program to NHA \nin local currency under terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \nAny foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government. \n   \nAdvance Contracting  For  each  project  and  for  the  technical  assistance  support \nand Retroactive  component, advance contracting for procurement of equipment, \nFinancing  civil works, land and consulting services will be allowed, subject to \neligibility according to agreed procedures and ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and its \nBorrowers (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nRetroactive financing may be available under individual loans for \nexpenditures  incurred  12  months  prior  to  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding loan agreement with a ceiling of up to 20% of the ", "  vii\nloan amount. The Government and NHA have been informed that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does \nnot commit ADB to financing any of the proposed projects.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The utilization period will be for 10 years from 2007 to 2017 with \nthe last PFR to be submitted by 30 June 2013. Each specific loan \nwill have its own closing date to match its implementation period. \n   \nEstimated Project  The estimated project completion date is 31 August 2017. \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  NHA will be responsible for the implementation of the Program \nArrangements  and the individual projects as per the respective loan and project \nagreements. The Government will have overall responsibility for \nthe MFF as per the FFA and loan agreements. \n   \nExecuting Agency  NHA will be the executing agency for the investment component \nand for the support component.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement to be financed under the Program will be carried out \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive  bidding \n(ICB)  will  be  used  for  goods  and  works  funded  under  the \ninvestment program. Civil works contracts with an estimated value \nless than $5 million will be procured using national competitive \nbidding  through  ADB\u2019s  standard  prequalification  procedure. \nSupply contracts will use limited international bidding for contracts \nwith an estimated value of $100,000 up to $1 million and shopping \narrangements for contracts less than $100,000. The goods and \nsupply contracts in excess of $1 million will be procured through \nICB. ICB will be used for civil works contracts estimated to cost \nthe equivalent of $5 million or more. A procurement plan has been \nprepared to ensure maximum competition under ICB. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  will  be  required  for,  among  others, \n(i) construction  supervision,  (ii) project  management  support, \n(iii) institutional strengthening, and (iv) a NTC highway business \nplan. Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and its Borrowers (2007, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  Consulting  firms  will  be  selected  through \ninternational  competition  using  the  quality  and  cost-based \nselection  method.  Individual  consultants  may  be  recruited  for \nspecific assignments in accordance with government procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  It  is  envisioned  that  because  of  the \ncontinuation of a number of tasks during implementation, single-\nsource selection may be used for certain assignments with the \nprior approval of ADB. \n \n \n \n ", "viii  \nRisks and Assumptions  The  major  risks  under  the  Program  would  include  a  material \nreversal of the policy framework and instability in the country\u2019s \nbusiness climate. This risk is likely to be short term in nature. \nGeneral elections will bring about some short-term disruptions, but \nmost  analysts  point  to  a  continuation  of  the  reform  process \nincluding the so-called second generation reforms. \n \nThe ability to attract private sector investment to the sector is \nanother concern. The investment program is simply too large for \nthe public sector to execute entirely through its own resources. \nThe Government needs to look outside for funds and partners. \nADB  will  continue  support  through  existing  PPP  technical \nassistance  and  will  consider  financial  support  through  the \nProgram and the private sector operations department.  \n \nThe provincial and district roads that feed into the NTC need to be \nfurther improved to maximize the benefits of the road network. \nThe  Government  at  federal  and  local  level  needs  to  allocate \nadequate resources to these smaller but strategically important \nroads. The NTC strategy will identify appropriate industries and \ntheir advantageous locations and the logistic hubs along the NTC. \nThis study will assist the Government to identify and concentrate \nresources on the key feeder roads. A coordinating entity will be \nestablished with assistance in the NTC highway business plan.  \n \nThe capacity of NHA to execute investments is also a risk. NHA \nhas  been  undergoing  reforms  initiated  by  Government  policy. \nNHA\u2019s own transformation is underway. ADB will support capacity \ndevelopment through the support component under the Program.  \n \nWith regard to the execution of the first tranche, procurement \ndocuments  have  been  drafted  and  are  ready  to  be  issued  to \nconsulting firms. Local procurement experts have been recruited \nto cope with the initial workload.  \n   \n  This  is  the  second  MFF  for  which  NHA  will  be  the  executing \nagency.  A  foundation  for  implementing  MFFs  has  been \nestablished at NHA. The teams within NHA will be strengthened to \nenable the efficient execution of the additional projects through \nthe support component of the Program.  \n \n  There is also potentially a fiduciary oversight risk associated with \nthe Program. However, this will be addressed through oversight \nand  monitoring  arrangements  in  procurement,  accounting, \nadministration, and reporting. Financial management, better and \ntransparent budgeting, disbursement management, management \nand  information  systems,  and  financial  planning  will  be \nstrengthened.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit, for your approval, the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the National Trade \nCorridor  Highway  Investment  Program  (the  Program).  The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for developing a national trade corridor (NTC) highway business plan, \nand, if the Board approves the proposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework for the Program is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  For its current high level of economic growth to be sustained, Pakistan must diversify its \neconomy and become more globally competitive. The Government\u2019s National Trade Corridor \nImprovement Program (NTCIP) is a holistic approach to reduce the bottlenecks inhibiting trade \nand to exploit the strategic location of Pakistan as a land bridge to Central Asia and the \nhinterlands  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  In  order  to  facilitate  this  goal, \nimprovements to road connectivity and efficiency are essential. \n \n1.  Economy and Trade \n \n3.  Pakistan has experienced strong economic growth since the beginning of the century, \nreaching a peak of 8.4% in fiscal year (FY) 2005 and 6.6% in FY2006. The outlook is for \ncontinued strong growth,1 based on the assumption that Pakistan will continue to implement the \nmacro- and microeconomic policies necessary to sustain and accelerate economic growth. \nAlthough the textile sector still dominates exports, recent export growth has been marked by \nincreasing diversity, particularly in manufactured goods. While imports of consumer goods have \nalso increased, their share of total imports dropped from about 15% in FY2001 to about 10% in \nFY2006.  \n \n4.  In terms of value, about 60% of Pakistan\u2019s imports originate from Asia. The PRC is the \ndominant source of non-oil imports and represents some 10% of total imports by value. Imports \nfrom Europe constituted about 19% of imports in FY2006, while imports from North America \ndeclined to about 7%. Recorded imports from neighboring countries, including Afghanistan, \nIndia, and Iran accounted for about 4.2% of the total. While Pakistan\u2019s seaports are the closest \nfor Central Asian countries, transit traffic from Central Asia using the Peshawar\u2013Karachi corridor \nis negligible and accounts for only 1.5% of Pakistan\u2019s total merchandise trade.  \n \n5.  The current level of east\u2013west traffic, including transit traffic using Pakistan as a land \nbridge between India and Iran, is low. Intraregional trade in South Asia is weak and the region is \nconsidered the least integrated in the world.2 Currently, much of the trade between India and \nPakistan is routed through Dubai. Direct trade would avoid such detours and efficiency losses. \nIndia\u2019s rapidly growing economy may have a \u201cpull\u201d effect not only on the economies of its direct \nneighbors but also on countries that would use the Pakistan east\u2013west corridor for trade with \nIndia.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

The transport sector contributes about 10% of Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). \nIt is dominated by road transport which carries 91% of passenger traffic in passenger-kilometers \nand 96% of freight traffic in ton-kilometers. Road transport services are mainly operated by \nprivate sector enterprises with the small share of government-owned goods handled by a public \nsector agency.  \n \n7.  Overall demand for road transport has increased rapidly in recent years. Gains in traffic on \nthe road network have been at the expense of the railway network. Extensive investment in \nrailways and restructuring of the industry will be needed for the network to become a viable \nalternative to road transport.3 In the meantime, the demand for road transport will continue to \nincrease.  \n \n8.  The  total  road  network  is  about  260,000  kilometers  (km),  of  which  11,400  km  are \nnational highways, 92,500 km are provincial highways, and 150,000 km are district or urban \nroads. The National Highway Authority (NHA) is responsible for national highways, including \nlimited-access  motorways,  partial-access  expressways  and  unlimited-access  highways  that \nconstitute the arterial road network system. About 7,000 km of the national highway network are \ntwo-lane, undivided roads.  \n \n9.  The NHA has prepared a comprehensive plan to 2015 to upgrade the national road \nnetwork and extend the highway system. The cost of implementing this plan is PRs480 billion \n($8.0 billion), of which about half is expected to be funded by external assistance (Table 1). The \nplan  provides  for  the  improvement  of  6,500  km  of  existing  roads  and  the  construction  of  \n2,500  km  of  new  expressways  and  motorways.  Parallel  plans  to  improve  7,600  km  and \nconstruct 4,500 km of provincial roads and special-area roads are also proposed in the Medium-\nTerm Development Framework (MTDF). \n \nTable 1: National Highway Development Cost Estimates and Financing Plan (2006\u20132015) a \n \nFinancing Source  Cost Estimates  % \nPRs million  $ million \nGovernment (ongoing and new) b  184,440  3,074  38.33 \nPrivate Sector  34,623  577  7.19 \nDevelopment Partner     \nADB  122,228  2,037  25.40 \nOther IFIs  94,927  1,582  19.73 \nBilateral Financial Institutions  44,994  749  9.35 \nTotal  481,212  8,019    100.00 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ERA = Earthquake Reconstruction Agency, IFI = International \nFinancial Institutions, MTDF = Medium-Term Development Framework, WAPDA = Water and \nPower Development Authority.  \na  Government budgetary allocations from 2011 are carry forwards.

The  road  maintenance  investment  budget  increased  from  PRs2  billion  in  2000  to \nPRs7 billion in 2006 (about 22% per year). This investment improved the pavement international \nroughness index from 8.9 in 2000 to 4.7 in 2006 (Appendix 2). \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Road Sector  \n11.  Road Assets. Travel  on  roads  is  severely  constrained  by  non-motorized  and  slow-\nmoving motorized traffic. As a result, transportation is inefficient, travel and delivery times for \ngoods are uncertain, and transport costs are higher than they should be. Road safety is also \ncompromised. The existing roads must be improved and new roads built to segregate traffic. \nThe Government intends to double the road density from 0.32 kilometers per square kilometer \n(km/km2) in 2006 to 0.64 km/km2 2030 (Vision 2030).   \n \n12.  Sustainability (Road Funding). NHA has a development budget and a maintenance \nbudget.  Development  funds  are  in  the  form  of  government  cash  loans  and  are  currently  \nPRs25  billion  per  year,  which  is  below  the  PRs40  billion  per  year  needed  to  satisfy  the \ngovernment plan for highway construction and to meet the needs of the growing economy.  \n \n13.  NHA has a Road Asset Management Directorate, which has achieved positive results in \nplanning and implementing road maintenance. For FY2007, the funding requirement for the \nnational  highway  network  and  motorways  was  estimated  at  PRs14  billion  for  periodic \nmaintenance and rehabilitation, with an additional PRs3 billion for routine maintenance. The \navailable total budget for the year was under PRs7 billion,4 and a maintenance program was \nprepared  according  to  this  budget.  Without  maintenance,  these  roads  will  require  more \nexpensive improvements in the future.  \n \n14.  Road Safety. Since 2000, reported road accidents have averaged over 10,000 per year \nand resulted in about 5,150 fatalities. The rate of about 10 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles is very \nhigh when compared with rates in developed countries but low for developing countries. The \nmain  causes  of  road  accidents  are  driving  at  speeds  inappropriate  for  vehicle  and  road \nconditions, lack of safety awareness, poor discipline, and poor enforcement of regulations.  \n \n15.  Public\u2013Private Partnership (PPP). PPP for roads in Pakistan is at an early stage and \nthe Government has been considering various ways of attracting private funding. The main \nrestraints have been the enabling environment, lack of track record for traffic volumes, and the \nlength  of  time  for  selection  of  and  negotiation  with  the  private  sector  partner.  To  enable \nwidespread use of PPP, the Government has established an infrastructure project development \nfacility. If expertise is developed at the national level, it will benefit all stages, including planning, \npromotion, selection, negotiation and implementation and can be used to form partnerships at \nprovincial and local levels where capacity is limited.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Annual maintenance, repair, and operational expenditures for existing motorways and national roads are funded \nfrom several sources: government grants (about PRs1.4 billion), road tolls net of collection costs (about PRs4.5 \nbillion), and miscellaneous income from right-of-way leases, police fines for traffic infringements and overloading, \nand advertising for the current year.  \n ", "4   \n2.  National Highway Authority \n \n16.  NHA is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and development of the national \nhighway system. It is an autonomous agency with a functional structure and decentralized \nimplementation arrangements through regional provincial offices. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the World Bank have provided assistance to NHA.5 Policy dialogue and financial \nsupport  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  contributed  to:  (i)  preparing  a  rolling  5-year \nmedium-term investment and maintenance plan; (ii) increasing the sections of the national \nhighway  network  that  charges  tolls  and  using  toll  receipts  for  road  development  and \nmaintenance programs; (iii) setting up the Road Asset Management Directorate (which has \nbeen fully functional since 2003); (iv) enforcing the National Highway Safety Ordinance and \nextending it to cover additional road lengths in each subsequent year; (v) collecting monetary \npenalties since 2003 for violations of traffic ordinances and allocating the collections to road \ndevelopment and maintenance programs; (vi) introducing standard operating procedures for \nfinancial management and an accompanying financial manual; (vii) recruiting financial experts \nfor NHA and independent auditing of financial statements; (viii) installing and activating weighing \nstations to control axle loads; (ix) establishing a public\u2013private partnership cell in NHA, (x) \nestablishing a highway safety unit in NHA; and (xi) annual consultations with stakeholders to \ndevelop the road maintenance plan. These reforms must be sustained and capacity added to \nenable NHA to plan, implement, and maintain its expanding portfolio of roads. \n \n17.  Sustainability  (Road  Funding).  There  is  a  framework  in  place  that  allows  NHA\u2019s \nfinancial performance and sustainability to be assessed, but the application of rigorous financial \nstandards is unlikely to provide a true reflection of its current status. When the NHA was \nestablished, the capital investment grants given to its predecessor, the National Highway Board, \nwere converted into cash development loans that NHA is now required (but is unable) to repay \nor service. The arrears are substantial. Although tolls are the main NHA revenue source, only \n30% of the roads it supervises are toll roads. Current revenues cover about 32% of operation \nand maintenance costs for the current year. Provincial roads that are often in a very poor \ncondition have been brought under federal control and the maintenance budget of NHA has \nbeen increased. A policy decision is needed on the resolution of cash development loans and \non whether road-user charges should be set with a view to recovering the full costs of road \nprovision, including capital costs.6 \n \n18.  Accountability and Transparency. NHA has an action plan to improve its financial \nmanagement. Fixed asset registers and adjustments of land acquisition advances have been \nprepared,  staff  members  with  professional  qualifications  have  been  hired,  and  financial \nstatements have been independently audited. As it is a public service provider, the performance \nof NHA can not be monitored simply through financial statements. Other performance standards \nwill need to be developed, monitored, and disclosed.   \n \n19.  Efficient  Service  Provider.  NHA  has  made  significant progress  toward  its  goal  of \nbecoming an efficient service provider; however, it is still in transition and has limited in-house \ncapability in strategic planning, project and asset management, and network operations. Further \nprogress  will  be  needed  if  it  is  to  manage  existing  and  new  roads  and  to  implement  its \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001.

Measures need to be taken to attract and retain talented \nqualified staff.  \n \n20.  Vehicle overloading is a major cause of premature pavement deterioration and of road \naccidents. There are now 54 weighing stations throughout the country. Fines are low (about \nPRs100 per excess ton) and insignificant in relation to haulage revenues and load value. Where \noverloading is extreme, many drivers are unable to pay and the fine is overlooked. Neither \nunloading  facilities  nor  storage  spaces  are  available  at  the  weighing  stations;  therefore, \noffloading to achieve legal limits is not possible. The number of weighing stations needs to be \nincreased and limits implemented more rigorously. \n \n21.  Safeguards. The Government has put in place new procedures for acquiring land, \nrelocating services, and planning resettlement. A planning document for land acquisition must \nbe submitted and approved before any other project activity can be approved. This is because \nin the past land acquisition in major projects caused delays and significantly increased costs. \nNHA\u2019s experience of its own projects and those of other agencies has demonstrated the need to \nstrengthen capacity for preparing and implementing safeguard requirements. The safeguard \nfunction in NHA needs to be upgraded and mainstreamed. However, there is a shortage of \nqualified and experienced social safeguards experts in Pakistan so training of staff will be \nessential for implementation and monitoring. Environmental laws have been in place since 1997 \nand are consistent with ADB\u2019s environmental policy.  \n \n22.  Public-private partnership (PPP). NHA has successfully encouraged private sector \nparticipation by outsourcing maintenance, operation of tolls, and planning (detailed design, \nfeasibility study). Implementing the highways components of the MTDF and national trade \ncorridor highway investment plan will require a major increase in funding and PPP financing is \nproposed for at least 7% of the 2006\u20132015 funding requirement. Given the limited progress with \nPPPs to date, this target will place a considerable demand on NHA's management capabilities. \nSignificant increases in private sector participation need to be managed effectively; poorly \nexecuted PPP projects not only fail to realize their potential benefits, they may discourage future \ninitiatives.  NHA  identified  projects  valued  at  approximately  PRs80  billion  in  the  National \nHighway  Development  Plan;  however,  it  has  had  difficulty  in  attracting  private  sector \ninvestments because of the lack of an enabling environment and traffic track record to underpin \nprivate sector transactions. Only PRs7 billion has been invested.7 Build operate and transfer \nschemes, management contracts, and concession contracts are being explored.  \n \n3.  National Trade Corridor Improvement Plan \n23.  If Pakistan is to achieve the Government\u2019s \u201cVision 2030\u201d it will have to improve its trade \nto GDP ratio from 30% in FY2005 to 60% by FY2030, or from $14 billion to about $600 billion.8 \nTo achieve this target, the government plans to improve the country\u2019s trade competitiveness \nand  diversify  exports.  The  Government  has  identified  logistical  barriers  to  trade  as  a  key \nconstraint on competitiveness and has formulated a comprehensive program aimed at reducing \n                                                 \n7  Of the seven projects planned for PPP, concession agreements have been signed for two: the Karachi\u2013Hyderabad \nmotorway M-9 (PRs6.3 billion) and Lakpass Tunnel (PRs679 million). Negotiations for the concession on Shahdara \nFlyover (PRs3.5 billion) are underway. A proposal was submitted for Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal Expressway E-4 but \nwas not accepted by the Government. M-9 concession has been cancelled due in ability of the sponsors to arrange \nfinancing within the deadline. \n8  Pakistan in the 21st Century: Vision 2030 (Working Draft). http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/ministries/planningand \ndevelopment-ministry/vision2030/Pak21stcentury/Chapterwise.htm \n ", "6   \ntime  and  cost  along  the  whole  logistical  chain.  In  addition  to  improvements  to  physical \ninfrastructure,  the  action  program  includes  policy  and  institutional  measures  to  provide  an \nenabling environment for the logistics industry.  \n \n24.  Because Pakistan\u2019s domestic trade flows are concentrated in one major north\u2013south \ntransport corridor, the proposed measures, while aimed at making this corridor more efficient, \nwill have a major impact on the performance of the entire transport sector and on the economy \noverall.  Because  of  its  comprehensive  scope  and  expected  far-reaching  impact,  the \nGovernment views the NTCIP as a key factor in promoting growth and reducing poverty. The \nNTCIP is a flagship endeavor by the Government and the private sector to improve trade \nfacilitation, ports, railways, airports, highways, and the trucking industry.  \n \n25.  The NTCIP\u2019s overall objective is to foster trade and economic growth through increased \ncompetitiveness. Consistent with the concept of trade logistics (defined as a chain of services \nsupported by infrastructure, policies, and procedures), the NTCIP addresses constraints posed \nby individual components. While an analysis of the transport cost chain indicates that Pakistan \ncompares  quite  favorably  against  international  benchmarks,  this  masks  major  external \ndiseconomies that jeopardize the long-term sustainability of the system. The NTCIP therefore \ncombines investments in physical infrastructure with policy and institutional reforms. When fully \nimplemented, it is estimated that NTCIP will save $5 billion\u2013$7.5 billion per annum currently lost \nbecause of the inefficiency of the transport sector.9 \n \n4.  National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Plan \n26.  The proposed national trade corridor highway investment plan (NTC highway investment \nplan) will reduce travel and transit costs and times both on new roads and on the existing road \nnetwork. It will also improve road safety. The current average travel times between Karachi port \nand industrial centers in Punjab (about 48 hours) and the city of Peshawar (about 72 hours) will \nbe reduced by about half.  \n \n27.  The  NTC  highway  investment  plan  covers  3,500  km  of  road  construction  and \nimprovements along the backbone of the corridor from Peshawar to Karachi, connections with \nthe PRC, and connections to the sea port in Gwadar (Appendix 3).  \n \n5.  Maximizing the Impact of National Trade Corridor Improvement  \n28.  The NTC highway investment plan will have to ensure a rational allocation of resources \nto individual projects and modes of transport. Decisions will need to be based on comparative \ncosts and sound investment analysis, especially for motorways, to avoid the problems faced by \nother motorway projects in Pakistan. The Islamabad to Lahore motorway (M2) has been in \noperation since 1997. While toll rates have been adjusted10 over time and revenues have \nincreased, the M2 has so far been unable to cover even operating and maintenance costs, not \nto mention capital costs. There has been little development along the road, so the envisioned \neconomic benefits have not been realized either. The unsatisfactory performance of the M2, \nwhich at its conception was considered a prime candidate for private sector involvement, is \nrooted in two factors: an alignment that is substantially longer than the competing national road \n                                                 \n9  Pakistan  Development  Forum  2007  Background  Briefs.  April  2007.  Islamabad.  Available: \nwww.pakistan.gov.pk/PDF/index.jsp. \n10 To boost traffic, tolls were reduced 2 years after the opening of the M2. \n \n ", "  7\nand  relatively  high  tolls.11 Complementary  measures  such  as  spatial  planning,  supporting \ninfrastructure, and tax or regulatory incentives to encourage private investment activity that \ncould have boosted traffic were not undertaken. A business plan and a coordinating body that \ncould  have  brought  together  public  and  private  stakeholders  to  implement  it  would  have \nimproved development along the road.  \n \n6.   External Assistance \n29.  Since the inauguration of the NTCIP in 2005, the Government has interacted closely with \nmultilateral and bilateral agencies. ADB, the World Bank, the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC), and other bilateral financial institutions are considering assistance. The \nWorld Bank is processing a NTCIP development policy loan. Potential projects include policy \nreform in rail, road, port and shipping services; trucking and trade facilitation; and civil aviation.  \n \n30.  For the road sector, Pakistan has received substantial assistance from ADB, JBIC, and \nWorld Bank (Appendix 4), since 2000. ADB\u2019s provincial project financial assistance began with \nSindh  (2001)12,  Punjab  (2002)13,  Baluchistan  (2003)14,  and  North-West  Frontier  Province \n(2004).15 The projects concentrated on provincial highways and farm-to-market roads. For the \nBaluchistan and North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) projects, ADB financed sections of the \nnational highways that form part of a network with Afghanistan and associated civil works for \nborder facilities at Chaman in Baluchistan (for $3.5 million) and Torkham in NWFP (for $2.3 \nmillion). In 2005, a National Highway Development Sector Investment Program (NHDSIP) was \napproved for continued support for national highway development and regional connectivity.16 \n \n31.  Since 2001, JBIC has financed the construction of the Kohat Tunnel for a total of \n$79 million and the Indus Highway Construction Project (III) for $166 million. In 2001, the World \nBank financed the Trade and Transport Facilitation Project for $3 million and the Highway \nRehabilitation Project for $200 million in 2003. During the last 4 years (2003\u20132007), the Trade \nand Transport Facilitation Project has been actively assisting the Ministry of Communication to \nreview, improve, and provide institutional capacity building for all major agencies associated \nwith the logistical chain. Under this project, the Government introduced a single administrative \ndocument and a goods declaration form, both of which constitute major steps toward trade \nfacilitation. The World Bank is preparing a project to follow the Trade Facilitation Project. In \naddition, the National Logistics Cell, a government agency, is undertaking border improvements. \nPakistan Railways is authorized to move transit goods to Afghanistan. Overall, trade facilitation \nof freight traffic is adequately covered by the Government and the World Bank project. The \n                                                 \n11 Benefits accrue mainly to passenger cars that can drive at the allowable maximum speed of 120 km per hour. \n12 ADB. 2001.

Lessons Learned \n32.  Before 2000, ADB-financed road projects focused on local and regional farm-to-market \nneeds with only selective interventions in national highways. Subsequently, ADB\u2019s investment \nstrategy shifted toward general provincial rural access roads. Since 2002, the Government has \nsought  greater  integration  with  Pakistan\u2019s  international  neighbors,  so  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners have concentrated on improving the capacity and quality of essential road \nsections. Initially, ADB assistance was directed at road links with Afghanistan.  \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  supporting  the  road  sector  indicates  a  need  for:  (i)  advance \nprocurement of civil works and recruitment of supervising consultants; (ii) early establishment of \nproject implementation units (PIUs) with clear, unambiguous roles and responsibilities; (iii) strict \npre-qualification criteria for contractors and supervising consultants; (iv) advance actions and \nclose  monitoring  with  respect  to  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  relocation  of  utilities,  and \nclearance of rights-of way; and (vi) a fast disbursement mechanism. NHA and ADB have \nworked together to shorten the procurement schedule for supervision consultants and civil \nworks for the first batch of NHDSIP projects. However, approval for contract signing within the \nGovernment took 3 months and delayed mobilization. Coordination with all relevant government \nparties is the key for fast tracking the recruitment process. Recruitment of NHDSIP\u2019s project \nmanager and support consultants was delayed, which resulted in a lack of coordination in the \nearly stages of project implementation. Establishing a project management unit with a full staff \nearly on is, therefore, crucial. In general, a clear understanding of the land acquisition and \nresettlement  plan  and  close  and  methodological  monitoring  by  the  executing  agency  is \nnecessary to ensure compliance with ADB policy. To assist the Government to implement the \nRoad Sector Development Framework and to prepare for subsequent tranches under the MFF, \nclose and frequent coordination by ADB staff will be essential.  \n \n34.  The Pakistan country assessment program evaluation (CAPE)18 suggested that ADB \nshould continue supporting the transport sector. The CAPE findings support the current strategy \nof province-specific projects, increased use of MFFs, a network approach to road development \nrather than a focus on selected elements of the network, increased emphasis on the soft \ncomponents of road sector performance, and a strategy of fostering regional connectivity. The \nuse of MFFs allows for long-term engagement in the sector which supports reforms in tandem \nwith  flexible  timing  for  project  financing.  The  CAPE  further  recommends  that  ADB  should \nseparate policy conditions and soft components from investment projects. Soft components \nshould, if necessary for the success of the investment project, be undertaken first, because if \ntheir implementation is slow this may delay the implementation of the physical components and \ntherefore increase costs substantially during implementation. \n \n35.  Moreover, the sector assessment program evaluation (SAPE)19 for the Pakistan road \nsector suggested the following: (i) ways must be found to address the defects noted in the \nplanning and design of previous road projects, (ii) a sector road map needs to lay out a clear set \nof steps to be taken by the Government, ADB, and other development partners to improve road \nmaintenance; (iii) the sector road map should include a time-bound series of actions that the \n                                                 \n17 A World Bank-financed project, Highway Rehabilitation Project, approved on 10 November 2003, for $200 million. \n18 ADB. 2006.

The public and private sides \nof ADB must work together to help achieve this objective. The Program addresses the lessons \nlearned and the recommendations of the CAPE and SAPE. \n \n8.  Asian Development Bank Operations and Sector Strategy \n36.  Sector strategy. ADB\u2019s focus has shifted from rural roads to major highways over the \npast 20 years. ADB\u2019s support for national highways in the country strategy and program update \nfor Pakistan (2005\u20132006)20 concentrated on supporting government initiatives to strengthen \nsubregional  cooperation,  improve  cross-border  facilities  and  agreements,  strengthen  trade \nfacilitation,  and  enhance  transport  efficiency  in  the  main  transport  corridors.  Support  for \nsubregional cooperation and cross-border agreements is part of the ADB-sponsored Central \nand South Asian Transport and Trade Forum.21 The World Bank has also undertaken trade \nfacilitation  activities  in  Pakistan.  However,  evaluating  such  multinational  initiatives  is \ncomplicated because it is often difficult to assign benefits to individual economies and to collect \nreliable and comparable data. For its part, the Government of Pakistan has also initiated a \nnumber of programs to meet subregional objectives. ADB has, therefore, shifted its strategy \ntoward assisting NHA to support of its overall plan to contribute to subregional connectivity. The \nongoing MFF for NHDSIP and this proposed MFF for the Program conform to this strategy.  \n \n37.  In addition, ADB is financing technical assistance to help the Government formulate a \nnational transport policy. Such a policy will provide a stronger strategic direction for transport \ninfrastructure and an enabling environment for sustainable transport operation and financing.22 \nADB has also worked with NHA to encourage private sector participation in motorway and \nnational highway investment, operation, and maintenance.23 The result of this work has been \nused for smaller PPP projects and will be the basis for further assistance for a pilot project. \n \n38.  In the long term, the shared aim of the Government and ADB is to create a self-\nsustaining and efficient highway system that enables the people of Pakistan and their neighbors \nto enjoy greater mobility and trade at the lowest possible cost. ADB strategy is, therefore, to \ncontinue to fill financing gaps in road development and to emphasize institution building and \npolicy reform as these are linked to the sustainability of investments and to better economic \nreturns. Since there is potential large-scale lending for the highway system, ADB will continue to \nadopt  a  programmatic24 approach,  and  projects  will  be  developed  in  a  sequential  and \nprogressive manner together with support components.  \n \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2005.

The loans are designed as investment projects but with the policy reform elements to be implemented in a \nsystematic, sequential, and coherent manner. \n ", "10   \n9.  Policy Dialogue \n39.  ADB has been engaged in policy dialogue with the Government and NHA since 2001 \nand has provided loans and technical assistance in support of critical policy and institutional \nreforms.  Following  extensive  policy  dialogue,  agreement  was  reached  on  a  road  sector \ndevelopment framework (RSDF) in 2005 for NHDSIP. It contains recommendations for major \npolicy reforms and sets implementation target dates in five policy areas: (i) promulgating the \nnational  transport  policy;  (ii)  facilitating  PPPs  in  road  construction,  maintenance,  and  toll \ncollection;  (iii)  developing  the  NHA  as  an  institution  and  improving  its  strategic  focus;  \n(iv) embedding concern for road safety in decision making; and (v) ensuring sustainable funding \nof  road  maintenance.  Significant  progress  continues  to  be  made  on  the  major  policy  and \ninstitutional issues targeted in the RSDF.  \n \n40.  The RSDF has been updated to include additional policy milestones for the Program \n(Appendix 5). Using lessons learned from NHDSIP and other projects with NHA, additional \ncapacity-building measures have been added. The RSDF\u2019s objectives have been reorganized \nunder  (i)  sustainability,  (ii)  accountability  and  transparency  of  NHA,  (iii)  efficient  service \nprovision by NHA, (iv) highway safety, (v) safeguards, and (vi) private sector participation in \nNHA roads. The progress against the policy reform milestones in the RSDF will be reviewed as \npart of the review process for all individual periodic financing requests (PFRs) scheduled to be \ncompleted before 30 June 2013. To implement the RSDF, NHA will be assisted by NHDSIP \nconsultants and additional support has been included in the Program. Implementation of the key \nelement of the RSDF has been agreed with the Government to be assurances for the Program. \n \na.  Sustainability of Road Sector (Road Funding) \n \n41.  Short-term  financial  sustainability  for  NHA  can  be  achieved  through  government \nendorsement of (i) a 5-year business plan and (ii) a 5-year maintenance plan (RSDF M251-1, 1-\n2). The business plan should include an investment plan, financial forecasts, and a budget. \nAlthough the grant for highway maintenance has been increased by the Government, the actual \namount  allocated  cannot  be  predicted  under  the  current  system  of  annual  allocations. \nGovernment endorsement of the business and maintenance plans will assure allocations and \nallow for further detailed planning. In addition, NHA is unable to service its accumulated cash \ndevelopment loans. The resolution of these debts is being discussed with the Government and \na decision on the available options is expected by September 2008 (RSDF M1-3).  \n \n42.  A national transport policy is being developed with technical assistance provided by \nADB.26 The policy will establish the foundations for the long-term sustainability of the transport \nsector. The overriding objective will be to improve economic welfare by providing transport \nservices at minimal cost. Other objectives relate to equity (including poverty alleviation), safety, \nand environmental and strategic considerations. The general principle of the policy is that \noperations and services should be left to the private sector except in cases where the private \nmarket fails and government intervention in some form may be appropriate. Other principles in \nthe draft national transport policy include: (i) competition within and between modes should \ngenerally be encouraged; (ii) minimum pricing (setting fares and charges) at marginal cost \nshould be the aim; (iii) there should be clear separation between the entity responsible for policy \nand  regulation  and  the  operations  or  executive  entity;  and  (iv)  investments  should  be \n                                                 \n25 This is in reference to the milestones set in the Road Sector Development Framework.

The new target date for government promulgation of the national transport \npolicy is June 2008 (RSDF M1-5).27 \n \n43.  A toll policy that balances economic benefits to society with financial benefits to NHA is \nneeded. The policy should be approved by the Government (RSDF M1-6) by December 2012 \nfor implementation in line with the national transport policy. Because the revenues from toll \ncharges will be limited, a new study28 is needed to examine the current set of road-user charges \nand to make recommendations that will enable some of the income from the charges to be \nallocated to NHA.29 The timing of this study will depend on the Government\u2019s decision on \nwhether to pursue road-user charges. The Government will determine and adopt policies to \nensure the financial sustainability of NHA by December 2009 (RSDF M1-7). \n \nb.  Accountability and Transparency of NHA \n \n44.  Road users and taxpayers should have a role in reviewing the needs, priorities, and \neffectiveness of road system management. NHA has been improving its disclosure and public \naccountability practices. Financial, performance, and commercial audit reports and information \non procurement will need to be disclosed to stakeholders. A management information system is \nbeing procured to improve transparency and accountability. A website to enable reporting of \ngrievances  has  been  functioning  since  30  June  2007  (RSDF  M2-1).  A  review  of  key \nperformance indicators and reporting mechanisms for NHA will be undertaken to clarify how \naccountability  can  be  strengthened.  Standard  operating  procedures  will  be  adopted  in \naccordance with the new indicators by December 2009 (RSDF M2-2). The qualifications in the \nauditor\u2019s letter for the audited financial statements of NHA will be addressed and rectified by \nSeptember 2008 (RSDF M2-3). \n \n    c.  Efficient Service Provider \n \n45.  NHA is in the process of transforming itself into a service-driven organization with a \nstrong service base. A network optimization plan is being developed with the help of ADB \n(footnote 16). Revisions to the guidelines for network planning will be made by July 2008 (RSDF \nM3-1). \n \n46.  NHA  has  outsourced  an  increasing  number  of  functions  to  the  private  sector. \nPerformance-based concession contracts for operation and management should be in place by \nMarch  2010  (RSDF  M3-3).  To  alleviate  overloading,  more  weighing  stations  will  be  built, \nincorporating storage spaces with off-loading facilities. Portable weighing stations will be used \nwhere  heavy  construction  temporarily  increases  truck  traffic.  ADB  will  consider  providing \nfinancial support for such initiatives.  \n \n47.  NHA needs to attract, develop, and keep talented staff. A human resource policy based \non performance indicators, evaluation, and compensation will be formulated and adopted by \nDecember 2009 (RSDF M3-4). A training institute is being established. \n \n                                                 \n27 The original target date in RSDF 2005 was June 2007. \n28 The last comprehensive road-user charge study was undertaken by the National Transport Research Centre in \n1987. \n29 The user charges may include fuel duties and vehicle license fees. Such charges should reflect the relative \ncontributions of different vehicle categories to congestion, environmental pollution, or road damage. NHA would be \ngiven access to a portion of such charges. \n ", "12   \n  d.  Road Safety on the National Highway Network \n \n48.  NHA has established clear responsibility for a national highway safety program and for \ncloser liaison with the National Highway and Motorway Police. A road safety unit has been \nestablished in NHA. Under the NWFP Road Development Sector and Connectivity Project \n(footnote 15), the National Highway and Motorway Police is undertaking a pilot safety study on \nsample sections of the national highway. An action plan acceptable to ADB in response to the \npilot study\u2019s recommendations will be prepared by December 2008 (RSDF M4-2). \n \n  e.  Safeguards \n \n49.  The Government has identified land acquisition as a cause of project delays and cost \nescalations. Careful monitoring of compliance with ADB safeguard policies will be needed in the \npreparation and implementation of land acquisition and resettlement plans and an environment \nimpact assessment that is acceptable to ADB. By December 2007, NHA will establish a unit with \na dedicated general manager and adequate staffing for environmental and social safeguards. \nPreliminary land acquisition and resettlement and environmental assessment guideline for NHA \nheadquarters will be adopted by June 2008 (RSDF M5-1). Guidelines for regional offices and for \ncoordinating with local government entities will be adopted by November 2008 (RSDF M5-2). \n \nf.  Enhancing Private Participation \n \n50.  The Government intends to improve the enabling environment for private participation in \ninfrastructure, supported by a cluster of ADB program loans that will help to establish the overall \npolicy  framework  and  reforms.30 Previous  ADB  technical  assistance31 has  helped  NHA  to  \n(i) revise a draft policy and regulatory framework for private sector participation in national \nhighways, motorways, tunnels, and bridges (to be confirmed by the cabinet committee for \ninvestments); (ii) prepare an action plan to improve the legal and regulatory framework for \nprivate  sector  participation;  (iii)  develop  comprehensive  PPP  tender  documents  for  future \nprojects; (iv) undertake a preliminary review and improvement of NHA\u2019s proposed build-operate-\ntransfer projects over the next 5 years; and (v) review the institutional arrangements needed to \ncarry out PPP projects, including creating a PPP cell at NHA. \n \n51.  ADB is also helping to finance two of the proposed PPP pilot projects (footnote 23). ADB \nassistance  will  cover  identification  of  projects,  preparation  of  projects  for  bidding,  and \nnegotiation of contracts. The consultants have been selected. A full review of the current PPP \nfinancing plan is expected by 31 March 2008 (RSDF M6-1). NHA is targeting bidding of the ADB \nPPP pilot projects by September 2008 (RSDF M6-2). Based on the experience of the pilot \nprojects, a revised pipeline of PPP projects is targeted to be available by December 2008 \n(RSDF M6-3). Such projects will require expected financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) that \nare sufficiently attractive to the private sector. \n \n52.  NHA  is  considering  how  projects  with  less  attractive  FIRRs  or  untested  revenue \nforecasts may be financed. ADB may consider assistance for these projects through either \nloans for equity contribution by NHA or guarantees.  \n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2006.

The proposed Program is closely linked to Pakistan\u2019s long-term transportation strategy \nand is an integral part of the NTCIP. The impact of the Program will be trade growth, and the \noutcome will be a more efficient NTC highway network. \n \nB.  Outputs \n54.  The Program will have two components: (i) investment projects covering over 346 km of \nthe NTC highway network to be funded through two tranches, and (ii) program support focusing \non institutional strengthening of NHA. The proposed program is consistent with the CAPE and \nSAPE recommendations that ADB should adopt a network investment approach and continue \nsupport for policy reforms and institutional strengthening (paras. 34\u201335). An MFF will be used \nso tranches can be prepared as projects become ready for implementation. The roads selected \n(new, expansion, or existing roads) will be in the main backbone of the NTC (Peshawar\u2013\nKarachi) and those providing connections to the PRC and to the seaport in Gwadar. Technical \nassistance will also be provided in conjunction with the Program to develop an NTC highway \nbusiness  plan  for  the  pilot  section  of  the  Peshawar\u2013Khanewal  (M1-E4)  motorways  and \nexpressways and to enhance the economic and financial sustainability of the roads (paras. 95\u2013\n97). \n \n55.  Depending  on  needs,  ADB  may  facilitate  financing  of  PPP  initiatives  through  the \nProgram by: (i) funding NHA\u2019s equity portion, (ii) guaranteeing any minimum traffic guarantee or \nannuity  given  by  NHA,  and  (iii)  providing  political  risk  guarantees  for  commercial  loans. \nProviding equity or debt to a project company through ADB\u2019s private sector window will be \nconsidered separately from the Program. \n \n56.  The Program will implement policy reform actions agreed with NHA and the Government \nin the RSDF (paras. 39\u201340). Policy reforms to be undertaken during the later phase (2012\u2013\n2017) will include a review of the outcomes from the first phase, updating the RSDF, and \nformulating the next generation of reforms. \n \n1.  Road Investment \n \n57.  The Government has asked ADB for support in building new roads and expanding \nexisting roads to achieve the goals set out in the National Trade Corridor Investment Program. \nSome  of  the  highways  will  be  funded  through  the  ongoing  NHDSIP  (footnote  16)  and \nexpressways  and  motorways  through  the  Program.  NHA  has  prepared  two  projects  under \ntranche 1: (i) the Peshawar\u2013Torkham section 1 (E-1), and (ii) the Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal section \n(E-4). The total length of these two sections is 218 km. NHA has finalized preparatory works, \nincluding  traffic  and  economic  analyses;  environmental,  social,  land  acquisition,  and \nresettlement assessments; detailed engineering designs; and bidding documents. NHA has \nprepared the procurement plans and is proceeding with advanced action allowed by ADB.  \n \n58.  The proposed projects are the construction of four-lane highways with partially limited \naccess for section 1 of E-1 and E-4. Full-depth asphalt pavement, long-span bridges, flyovers, \nand interchanges will be constructed in both projects. There will be significant earthworks for \nsection 1 of E-1 as it crosses a mountainous area. Fewer earthworks are expected on the \nrelatively flat terrain for the E-4 project.  \n ", "14   \n \n59.  Three projects for tranche 2, totaling about 125 km, are being prepared by NHA. Due \ndiligence will be conducted by ADB when preparatory works have been completed. The criteria \nfor selecting the roads for tranche 2 and other additional road sections during implementation \nand the status of the preparatory work for the tranche 2 projects is in Appendix 6.  \n \n60.  The  Program  will  provide  vehicle  parking  and  service  areas  along  project  highway \ncorridors. It will also provide equipment to control pavement overloading by domestic and \ninternational traffic. This component will include serviced parking areas and wayside facilities \nand will cover consulting services for design, supervision, and civil works. The facilities to be \nprovided include (i) paved parking, (ii) emergency repairs, (iii) restaurants, (iv) refueling, (v) \nprayer areas, (vi) overnight accommodation, (vii) weighing stations, (viii) emergency medical \nservices (ix) toll plazas, and (x) a building for operations. The design approach and technical \nstandards are in Supplementary Appendix A. The facilities will be leased out to private operators \non a long-term basis or developed through PPPs.  \n \n2.  Institutional Strengthening \n \n61.  Institutional  strengthening  will  be  continued  in  line  with  the  RSDF.  The  design  of \ninterventions has taken into account ongoing and planned support from ADB and other bilateral \nand multilateral financial institutions and therefore not all the milestones in the RSDF are \ncovered.  Under  the  ongoing  NHDSIP,  NHA  has  established  a  policy  coordination  unit  to \ncoordinate and monitor progress on institutional and policy reforms. Outline terms of reference \nfor the components summarized below are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n62.  The  Government  is  considering  financing  options  for  capital  development  and \nmaintenance  of  roads  (para.  39).  A  road  sector  policy  study  will  help  NHA  to  rationalize \nexpenditures and ensure stable and predictable revenues. It will also review road user charges \nshould the Government decide to pursue this option.  \n \n63.  The  Program  has  several  components  designed  to  help  NHA  become  an  efficient \nservice provider (paras. 45\u201347). Road corridor management using performance-based contracts \nhas improved road maintenance practices in many countries and the Program will support NHA \nto  determine  the  model  best  suited  for  Pakistan.  Assistance  will  be  provided  for  a  pilot \napplication of performance-based contracts on a road to be selected during the study. Efficient \nmanagement will be promoted through intelligent transport systems such as card readers and \nelectronic notification. Portable weighing stations will be piloted to control overloading of trucks \nat temporary locations such as construction sites.  \n \n64.  If NHA is to become an efficient service provider, it will need highly motivated and \nqualified staff. Consultants will develop a human resource development strategy. Proposals will \nbe made for work performance indicators for units and departments and for advanced training \nand education to upgrade the skills of staff.  \n \n65.  As part of the ongoing NHDSIP, a core team of experts has been funded for a 2-year \nperiod for capacity development, project management, contract management, and safeguards. \nThe services of these consultants will be extended for another 3 years under the Program, \nfurther  strengthening  NHA\u2019s  capacity  to  prepare,  implement,  and  monitor  the  projects.  To \nencourage quality at entry, the Government has requested funding for project preparation. The \nconsultants will prepare feasibility studies and detailed designs using the latest technologies for \nalignment selection and construction. \n \n ", "  15\n \n66.  NHA established unit for environmental and social safeguards under NHDSIP. These will \nbe  upgraded  and  a  dedicated  general  manager  assigned,  with  adequate  support  staff.  A \nmethodical approach will be taken to building capacity and maintaining sustainability (para 42). \nCapacity  development  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  under  NHDSIP  has  been \nredesigned to utilize the funds to fit the current needs of NHA, and a detailed assessment of \ncurrent bottlenecks will be carried out to enable the unit to become efficient and effective. \nFunding from the Program will help to eliminate these bottlenecks and to improve coordination \nbetween NHA headquarters and regional offices and among NHA, the boards of revenue in the \nfour  project  provinces,  and  local  governments  in  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and \nindigenous  people  issues  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  Guidelines  for  environmental \nassessment will be adopted by June 2008. \n \nC.  Technical Justification and Selection Criteria \n \n67.  The projects proposed under the Program cover key sections of the NTC. The Program \nis divided into tranches, with tranche 1 covering two projects and the institutional strengthening \ncomponent. The following criteria were used to identify the projects: (i) technical justification,  \n(ii) economic viability, and (iii) minimal environmental and social impacts (Appendix 7). These \ncriteria will be applied to all subsequent tranches.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n68.  The total cost of NTC highway investment plan is $5.36 billion. The financing plan is a \ncombination of funds from the Government, ADB, and other financiers. It was agreed that NHA \nwould provide at least 20% from its own resources and that ADB could fund up to 80% of the \ntotal cost for components under each tranche (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Plan \n \n  Program  Total \nAmount  Share   Amount  Share  \n \n($ million)  (%)  ($ million)  (%) \nGovernment  210  20  1,632 a  30 \nADB  890  80  1,082 b  20 \nOther IFIs or BFIs      1,547   29 \nOther      1,102  21 \nTotal  1,100  100  5,363  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IFI = international financial institutions, BFI = bilateral financial institutions, \nProgram = National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program.  \na The Government component for NTC includes roads to be financed by the Water and Power Development \nAuthority. \nb About 16.6% from the Program and 3.4% from NHDSIP. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and National Highway Authority estimates. \n \n69.  The Government has requested funds up to the equivalent of $900 million to help \nfinance part of the NTC highway investment plan for motorways and expressways. This is in \naddition to $175 million proposed to be allocated to highways from the NHDSIP. The financing \nwill be provided under an MFF in accordance with ADB policy.32 The implementation period will \nbe 10 years. The MFF will consist of individual loans subject to the submission of a related PFR \nby  the  Government  and  execution  of  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  Government  has \n                                                 \n32 ADB. 2005. Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities.

The Government will make \nthe proceeds of the loans available to NHA upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n70.  ADB  will  use  its  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  to  finance  the  projects  up  to  a \nmaximum amount of $890 million. Each loan will have a repayment period of 25 years, including \na grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London inter-\nbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.35%, conversion \noptions that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the ordinary operations for loan \nregulations, and such other terms set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The foreign \nexchange risk will be borne by the borrower. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  and  (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and did not rely on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.  \n \n71.  The support component (institutional strengthening) amounting to $12.5 million will be \nfunded by ADB in the amount of $10.0 million equivalent (80%) through its Asian Development \nFund (ADF) resources. The terms and conditions will include interest at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter and a repayment period of 32 \nyears including a grace period of 8 years. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the \nborrower. The borrower will make the proceeds of the loan available to NHA upon terms and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n72.  The first PFR to ADB for tranche 1 is for $555 million, comprising a loan of $545 million \nfrom OCR to finance two projects and a loan from ADF resources of $10 million equivalent to \nfinance the support component (Table 3). The first PFR has been prepared by the Government \nand is presented to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors together with this document and the FFA. The \ncost of the two projects identified under tranche 1 is estimated at 2007 current prices to be $709 \nmillion. The Government and NHA requested ADB to finance up to 77% of the total cost which \namounts to $545 million. The remaining portion will be met by a government allocation to NHA. \nThe cost estimates per project are provided in Appendix 8. \n \nTable 3: National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program Financing Plan Tranche 1 \n($ million) \n \nTranche 1 \n                    OCR                                            ADF \nItem  Amount  Share    Amount  Share \n($ million)  (%)  ($ million)  (%) \nADB        545   77    10.0   80 \nGovernment         164   23           2.0   20 \nTotal         709  100           12.0   100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, Program = National Trade \nCorridor Highway Investment Program, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "  17\nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  The Executing and Implementing Agencies \n73.  NHA will be the executing agency and the implementing agency for the investment and \nsupport components. The proposed organization structures are in Appendix 9 and 10. An NTC \nHighway Investment Program coordinating committee chaired by the chairperson of NHA will be \nresponsible for monitoring the use of loan funds and for overall implementation performance. \nThe committee will meet at least quarterly. A policy formulation and coordination office headed \nby the NHA member for planning was established under NHDSIP, and the Program project \nmanagement office (PMO) under the NHA member for operations is to be set up at NHA \nheadquarters in Islamabad. A general manager for ADB projects in NHA headquarters has been \nappointed and is in place.  \n \n2.  Management \n74.  Under NHDSIP, NHA has established a project coordinating committee (PCC) chaired \nby the chairperson of NHA to provide guidance on the overall implementation and performance \nof the project. NHA will introduce management information systems in the office of the general \nmanager (ADB) to manage the Program and other projects under its responsibility. A core team \nof consultants has been provided under the NHDSIP to further develop capacity for project \npreparation and implementation. The general manager oversees all activities for ADB projects, \nincluding  preparing  projects,  writing  reports,  and  monitoring  implementation  of  on-going \nprojects.  A  principal  coordination  officer  has  been  assigned  to  the  general  manager  to \ncoordinate work being done in different departments of NHA. A safeguard unit is responsible for \nthe  processing  and  implementation  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  For  the \nimplementation of the E-4, a project management unit is located in the field (near Faisalabad) \nand a general manager and principal coordinating officer will directly control and monitor the \nproject. Project directors for each package head their respective PIUs. For section 1 of E-1, the \ngeneral manager for ADB projects in NWFP will head the project management unit and will \nhave a project director who will head the PIU. Project directors will be supported by deputy \nproject directors and adequate support staff as per NHA\u2019s standard complement (NHA will \nprovide such information to ADB). The supervising consultant for construction will assist the \nPIU. Each PIU will be adequately staffed and working at least 2 months before the award of civil \nworks contracts.  \n \n75.  Independent teams of international and domestic consultants will be provided for each \ncivil  works  contract  (supervision  consultants)  and  they  will  be  headed  by  chief  resident \nengineers. Each team will report to the assigned project director or general manager. NHA will \nbe provided with the necessary expertise from the consulting team supervising construction or \nfrom NHA staff resources for projects involving land acquisition, resettlement activities, and \nenvironmental impacts. An accountant or administrative specialist will be assigned to each PIU. \nThe team will provide NHA with periodic reports on the progress of the project, including \nsafeguard issues. Sufficient administrative authority will be delegated to the PIUs for effective \nand timely project implementation. \n \n76.  For subsequent tranches, NHA will appraise all projects and will be responsible for their \npreparation and implementation. Appraisal, processing, and implementation will include the \ndevelopment and completion of technical reports (feasibility studies, preliminary design reports, \nenvironmental assessment reports, resettlement and indigenous people development plans, \nand detailed design reports) to ensure compliance with government and ADB requirements. \n ", "18   \nPFRs will be submitted to ADB when they have been approved by NHA and have received the \nrequired government clearances (PC-1s). Detailed timetables for implementation will be set out \nin the facility administration memorandum.  \n \n77.  NHA will submit progress reports to ADB every quarter. Environmental checklists will be \ncompleted as an early warning system for projects that are environmental or social category A \nor B. NHA will submit other required performance and monitoring reports twice a year. Overall \nprogress and compliance with conditions of the FFA and individual loan and project agreements \nwill  be  monitored  regularly,  with  periodic  reports  to  ADB,  consistent  with  existing  project \nimplementation requirements. Reports will include evaluations of issues or problems faced by \nNHA  and  will  recommend  remedial  actions.  Overall  progress  will  be  considered  as  new \nfinancing requests are submitted.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n78.  The  Program  will  be  implemented  over  10  years  (inclusive  of  procurement  and \nconstruction  activities)  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  31  August  2017.  The  loan \nagreements are expected to have implementation periods of 3\u20136 years. The last PFR should be \nsubmitted no later than 30 June 2013. Civil works are expected to be bid out in two tranches. \nThe tranche 1 projects are at an advanced stage of preparation, and mobilization of consultants \nto supervise construction and civil works is expected to begin in July 2008. For tranche 2 \nprojects,  NHA  will  develop  detailed  implementation  plans  when  it  submits  the  PFR.  The \nimplementation schedule will allow for the acquisition of land free from encumbrances; for \nresettlement; for clearance of all utilities; and for trees from the land to be used for construction. \nFor  the  support  component,  implementation  will  be  staged  from  2008  to  2014.  The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n4.  Disbursement Arrangements \n79.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment procedures will generally be used for \nlarge civil works contracts and consulting services. NHA will establish imprest accounts for the \ninvestment at the National Bank of Pakistan, with an initial advance equivalent to estimated \neligible project expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is less. \nThe imprest accounts (one for each OCR and ADF loan) will be established, managed, and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements \nagreed by the Government and ADB. Statement of expenditure procedures will be used to \nreimburse  eligible  expenditures,  or  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the  imprest  account  for  any \nindividual payment under $100,000 for the OCR loan and $50,000 for the ADF loan.  \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n80.  ADB Management has approved a request for advance contracting for procuring goods \nand services for each tranche. The Government has also requested retroactive financing of up \nto 20% of the loan amount for each tranche under the Program. ADB Management has agreed \nto seek Board approval for retroactive financing provided that expenditures are in accordance \nwith agreed procedures and they took place during the 12 months before the signing of the \ncorresponding individual loan agreement under the MFF. Retroactive financing is sought for \neligible expenditures, including civil works, goods, and consulting services. Such financing will \nbe subject to compliance with any involuntary resettlement requirements stated in a project \nresettlement plan. Furthermore, NHA has been informed that approval of advanced contracting \n \n ", "  19\nand retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any of the proposed projects. The \nprocurement department in NHA will mainly be responsible for the advance action. PIUs will be \nestablished for each project.  \n \n6.  Procurement \n81.  Procurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed from the ADB loan will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  To  ensure  competition,  international  competitive  bidding  contract  packages  will  be \nencouraged. Civil works contracts will be procured through international competitive bidding \namong pre-qualified bidders. Civil works contracts with an estimated value less than $5 million \nwill be procured using national competitive bidding through ADB\u2019s standard prequalification \nprocedure. Supply contracts will use limited international bidding for contracts with an estimated \nvalue of $100,000\u2013$1,000,000, and shopping arrangements for contracts of less than $100,000. \nBefore the beginning of national competitive bidding procurement, ADB and the Borrower will \nreview the Borrower's procurement procedures to ensure consistency with ADB requirements. \nAny modifications or clarifications to the Borrower's procedures will be documented in the \nprocurement  plan.33 Goods  in  excess  of  $1  million  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive bidding. The Government has agreed to include the relevant sections of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) in all bidding and contractual documents. \n \n82.  The  projects  in  the  two  tranches  will  involve  about  seven  international  competitive \nbidding contract packages for road improvement and construction civil works. The packages \ntake into account the need for a balance between (i) minimizing administration by consolidating \nworks  in  larger  contracts,  and  (ii)  designing  package  sizes  that  will  enable  international \ncontractors to participate. The thresholds for each type of procurement plan and indicative \ncontract packages are in Appendix 12. Finalization of the civil works packages for tranche 2 will \nbe done during project implementation. Furthermore, to shorten processing, the bidding period \nhas been reduced to 45 days.34 \n \n83.  If ADB and the borrower later agree to adopt post-qualification procedures based on the \nsuccess of the exercise initiated under the NHDSIP, such procedures can be tried for some \ntranche 2 packages. If a post-qualification procedure is adopted in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines,  no  prior  review  and  approval  will  be  required;  however,  ADB  will  review  the \nprocurement documents and respond as soon as practicable but no later than 6 months after \ntheir receipt.  \n \n7.  Consulting Services \n84.  Tranche  1  will  require  about  1,207  person-months  of  consulting  services  (128 \ninternational  and  1,079  national).  Tranche  2  will  require  about  1,080  person-months  (171 \ninternational and 909 national); however, this figure will be finalized during implementation of \ntranche 1. The consultants will help NHA to implement the Program. The terms of reference for \nall loan-financed consultants will be subject to prior ADB approval. International consultants \nrecruited as consulting firms will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nselection procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \n                                                 \n33 ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n34 Requests for extensions from bidders up to 60 days will, however, will be favorably considered if the bidders find \nthe shortened timeline difficult to meet. \n ", "20   \namended from time to time). Individual international and national consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n85.  For  tranche  1  projects,  two  ADB-financed  consulting  firms  will  support  bidding  and \nsupervising of the construction of civil works for highway improvements. The consultants will \nhelp with supervising construction of the four civil works packages. Terms of reference for the \nconsultants for tranche 2 projects will be finalized during the implementation of tranche 1. \nDetailed engineering design and feasibility studies for tranche 2 projects are being undertaken \nby  locally  recruited  consultants  and  financed  from  NHA  resources.  Consulting  services \npackages  are  summarized  in  Appendix  12  and  an  outline  of  the  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants supervising construction is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n  \n86.  In  addition  to  recruiting  consultants  through  firms,  NHA  will  engage  the  following \nindividual consultants to provide project management support: (i) a local resettlement specialist \nto review resettlement plans for all projects and to train NHA staff to strengthen capacity for \noverall  planning  and  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities;  (ii)  an \ninternational social monitoring specialist for independent monitoring, evaluation, and reporting \non the progress of land acquisition and resettlement activities (Supplementary Appendix C); (iii) \nan international environmental expert to oversee compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002) and safeguard measures for all projects; and (iv) a contract specialist to help NHA \nengage consultants and procure civil works.  \n \n8.  Anticorruption Policy \n87.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  NHA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate either directly or through \nits agents any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to projects \nunder the Program. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \nare included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of NHA and all contractors, suppliers, and \nconsultants and other service providers. \n \n88.  The independent audit of the NHA financial statements and the Road Maintenance \nAccount has been a notable step in promoting transparency and governance. Annual public \nconsultations have taken place on the road maintenance plan. A grievance website has been \nestablished to enable anonymous or signed complaints. A policy coordination unit has been \nestablished to assist with the implementation of agreed reforms. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \na.  Accounts and External Audit \n89.  NHA  shall  maintain  its  financial  statements  in  double  entry  accrual  accounting  in \naccordance  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  followed  in  Pakistan.35 Its \nfinancial  statements  shall  comprise  its  balance  sheet,  income  statement,  and  cash  flow \n                                                 \n35 Where for any particular disclosure the prevailing accounting standard in Pakistan differs from the International \nFinancial Reporting Standard, the financial statements shall, in a note to the accounts, explain the divergence. \n \n ", "  21\nstatement  accompanied  by  their  respective  schedules  and  notes  to  accounts  as  may  be \nnecessary.  NHA\u2019s  financial  statements  shall  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with \nInternational Standards of Auditing by an external auditor acceptable to ADB. NHA annual \nfinancial statement shall be accompanied by the auditors\u2019 letter to NHA management and \nmanagement\u2019s response to it. Most importantly, NHA\u2019s external auditors\u2019 report will contain the \nauditors\u2019 opinion on whether ADB\u2019s loan funds were used for the purposes specified in ADB\u2019s \nloan and project agreements. NHA will submit to ADB its audited annual reports in English \nwithin 6 months of the close of every financial year. \n \n90.  NHA will maintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the goods \nand  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures \nincurred for the project and use of local funds. These project accounts and financial statements \nwill be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an independent auditor \nacceptable to ADB. External auditors for the projects will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The audit of the \nimprest accounts and statement of expenditure will be carried out as part of the regular annual \naudit.  The  auditor\u2019s  opinion  of  the  examination  of  the  imprest  accounts  and  statement  of \nexpenditure should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. NHA will submit to ADB the \naudited project annual reports in English within 6 months of the close of every financial year. \n \nb.  Internal Audit \n91.  NHA has an internal audit department headed by a general manager. The remainder of \nthe  staff  consists  of  a  director,  two  deputy  directors,  four  assistant  directors  and  a  junior \naccounting and audit member of staff. The eventual staff size is 40 but not all positions have \nbeen filled. NHA\u2019s internal audit department general manager, deputy director and assistant \ndirectors  are  seconded  from  the  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  of  Pakistan  (the  country\u2019s \nsupreme audit institution). The director is seconded from the Income Tax Department. NHA\u2019s \ninternal audit department reports to its chairperson. Any abnormalities detected by the internal \naudit department are forwarded to the concerned operational general manager and the internal \naudit department recommendations are followed up by the compliance committee established \nwithin NHA. The internal audit department audits NHA twice a year and coordinates efforts with \nthe external auditor. With the help of consultants, it is preparing an internal audit manual that is \nexpected  to  be  ready  in  6  months.  Overall,  NHA\u2019s  internal  audit  system  appears  to  be \nsatisfactory and commensurate with its role as an EA. \n \nc.  Investment Program Performance and Monitoring Report \n92.  Quarterly progress reports will be prepared for individual projects for review by ADB. \nNHA  has  been  developing  a  systematic  investment  program  performance  monitoring  and \nanalysis system, integrated with its management information system for NHDSIP. Baseline data \nfor performance monitoring have been established and are being refined. They will be applied to \nProgram. The key indicators and assumptions outlined at the impact and outcome levels in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) will be used for rapid assessment. The policy \ncoordination unit is monitoring progress on the road sector development framework and will \ncontinue to report on progress as part of the periodic reports. The procurement schedule for \nconsultancy services under the support component and progress reports by the consultants will \nbe closely monitored by the policy coordination unit. \n \n ", "22   \n10.  Investment Program Review  \n93.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the first loan approval. The \nmission will review implementation and operations, including resettlement and environmental \naspects,  based  on  quarterly  progress  reports.  Subsequent  missions  will  meet  with  the \nGovernment and NHA twice a year to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review will \nbe carried out 2 years after each loan becomes effective. This will focus on the engineering, \nresettlement, environmental, and social aspects of ADB-supported investments and will also \nreview the financial status of NHA. Representatives of ADB and NHA will take part in the review. \nThe midterm reviews will evaluate compliance with warranties and representations contained in \nthe FFA and with assurances in individual loan agreements. The review will allow for any mid-\ncourse corrections to ensure successful implementation and the achievement of objectives. A \nproject completion report will be submitted within 3 months of the completion of individual \nprojects.  A  completion  report  will  be  prepared  after  the  completion  of  all  ADB-supported \nactivities and projects under the Program. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n94.  A technical assistance grant will be provided to develop a pilot highway business plan for \nthe E1-E4 (Peshawar\u2013Khanewal) road. The impact and outcome of the TA is consistent with the \nProgram (para. 53) and will help to maximize the benefits from the NTC. A team of business \nconsultants will be hired to (i) identify industries that would be attracted to particular areas along \nthe road in line with existing spatial plans (if any) and in consultation with the private sector; (ii) \ndraft recommendations for government action (e.g., on infrastructure and incentives needed) to \nattract priority sectors, and (iii) develop a marketing plan (Supplementary Appendix D). The \nconsultants will work in concert with the NTC strategy being developed with ADB support, which \nwill establish a strategic framework for new business development along the NTC. \n \n95.  Cost  and  Financing. The total cost of the technical assistance is estimated to be \n$650,000 equivalent. ADB has been asked by Government to provide $500,000 equivalent. The \nTA will be financed on grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will \nprovide $150,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities and other expenditures.  \n \n96.  Implementation  Arrangements.  Input  from  private  and  public  stakeholders  will  be \nessential  if  the  business  plan  is  to  be  successful.  An  NTC  development  body  with \nrepresentatives from the private sector (e.g., business groups and chambers of commerce), \ngovernment agencies, and academia will be formed under the Planning Commission to develop \nand implement the recommendations from the technical assistance grant. The executing agency \n(EA) will be the Planning Commission headed by the member for infrastructure. The TA is \nexpected to engage international consultants for 11 person-months and national consultants for \n15 person-months. Consulting services will be recruited through ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nor quality-based selection procedures and its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix D. In \naddition, individual expertise will be recruited in accordance with ADB guidelines. The TA is \nexpected to begin in September 2008 and completed by January 2009.  \n \nV.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Investment Program Benefits and Beneficiaries \n97.  The Program is designed to increase trade growth by making road traffic along the NTC \nmore efficient. Increased competitiveness will contribute to greater GDP growth and enhance \n \n ", "  23\nemployment opportunities. The road projects will provide employment for skilled and unskilled \nlabor during their implementation.  \n \nB.  Overall Economic Analysis \n98.  The urban centers of Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad\u2013Rawalpindi are the main origins \nand destinations for domestic trade and attract over 33% of traded goods. The north\u2013south \nroads have played a significant role in accommodating increases in freight movement.  \n \n99.  Under a \u201cdo-minimum\u201d scenario where the ongoing road works and other rehabilitation \nworks were taken into account, the vehicle and capacity ratios of N5 road sections in 2015 were \nestimated at about 0.7 or above which is theoretically reaching road capacity. The \u201cdo-minimum\u201d \nwas compared with a \u201cwith development\u201d case in which all the proposed works in the NTC \nhighway investment plan were included. The total financial cost of about 3,700 km of roads was \nestimated at PRs264 billion (exclusive of land acquisition and price contingency). It is assumed \nthat  this  expenditure  will  be  incurred  over  the  period  2008\u20132014.  Subsequent  increases  in \nmaintaining the road network were estimated at an average of PRs3.7 billion per year.  \n \n100.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the NTC highway investment plan overall \nis estimated at 39%. To begin with the benefits are mainly associated with savings in vehicle \noperating costs but benefits from time savings grow over time. The total savings were estimated \nto average about PRs200 billion per year or about 3% of Pakistan\u2019s 2005 GDP. \n \n101.  Benefits accruing from savings in vehicle operating costs grow more slowly than benefits \nassociated with time savings. The underlying reason is that renewed congestion occurs toward \nthe end of the investment period (requiring a new round of capacity expansion at a later stage). \nThis conclusion was supported by the Pakistan Transport Plan Study36 which suggested that \nplans for the motorway system should include two parallel north\u2013south motorways, one on each \nside of the Indus River. \n \n102.  A preliminary computable general equilibrium model was used to estimate the indirect \nbenefits of the NTC highway investment plan for the economy. The indirect benefits were much \ngreater  than  the  direct  benefits.  Improvements  in  feeder  roads  to  the  NTC  highways  and \nproduction and logistics hubs along the highway would increase the distribution of benefits \nfurther to secondary cities and rural areas.  \n \nC.  Economic Analysis for Tranche 1 Projects \n103.  The overall economic viability of NTC highways was estimated, taking into account the \noverall investment not only in the highways but in other investments currently in the pipeline. A \nsensitivity test was performed to assess the worst-case scenario in which only the individual \nprojects under tranche 1 are constructed. Individual project evaluations do not encompass all \nthe benefits that overall network improvement would bring, such as a cleaner environment and \nfewer accidents (Appendix 13).  \n \n104.  Peshawar\u2013Torkham Section 1 (E-1). The project will provide an alternative route to the \nexisting  two-lane,  undivided  road  for  traffic  between  Peshawar  and  Afghanistan  and \nintermediate locations within Pakistan. A four-lane divided configuration that avoids urban areas \nwill permit higher travel speeds and will include road safety measures. As a result, vehicle \n                                                 \n36 Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2006. Pakistan Transport Plan Study. \n ", "24   \noperating costs and travel time for users of the new road will be reduced. The new road will \nprobably divert about 60% of the traffic from the existing road. The substantial bus traffic will be \nsplit between the existing road and the new road. \n \n105.  Under the worst-case scenario, only this road is built. The EIRR was estimated at 11% \nand the project is only marginally viable because of the high capital cost. The likelihood that only \nthis project will be implemented is very small, given that both sections 1 and 2 of Peshawar\u2013\nTorkham (E-1)37 and all of Faisalabad-Khanewal (E-4) will be financed by ADB. Construction of \nthese sections (which will provide shorter connections between Peshawar and Multan) will result \nin higher benefits to society and an EIRR of 14%. \n \n106.  Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal (E-4). The project will provide an alternative to several existing \nroutes between Faisalabad and the Khanewal\u2013Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh area. The existing roads \nare narrow and congested more because of the vehicular characteristics of prevailing traffic (i.e. \nnon-motorized vehicles) rather than traffic volume. It will also extend the E-1, M-2, and M-3 \nmotorway network southward, thus offering a higher speed link for through traffic between the \nnorth of Pakistan and its neighbors to the north and northwest and to southern Punjab, Sindh, \nand the ocean ports of Pakistan.  \n \n107.  Traffic diverted to the new road will be able to travel at higher speeds. No account has \nbeen taken of any changes in the distances to be traveled between the new road and the \nexisting roads.  \n \n108.  E-4 provides the missing link between the existing motorway (M-1, M-2, and M-3) and \nthe heart of Punjab (Lodhran\u2013Sukkur, N-5). Under the worst-case scenario in which only this \nroad is built, the project is economically viable given the estimated EIRR of 15%. It will generate \na high economic return even with pessimistic assumptions regarding traffic volume, economic \ngrowth, and construction costs. These results do not include benefits from reduced traffic on \nroads from which traffic is diverted. Such reductions would relieve congestion and reduce the \nrate of road deterioration. \n \nD.  Financial Management and Financial Analysis \n109.  A financial management assessment found that NHA had enough capacity to fulfill \nADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements. Questionnaires and field interviews were used to review current \npractices. NHA is in transition, and the assessment was designed to determine its potential to \nachieve greater financial and operational autonomy. Accounting diagnostic tools such as the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  comprehensive  country  financial  accountability  assessment 38  and  public \nexpenditure review39 were used (Supplementary Appendix F).  \n \n110.  A  financial  analysis  of  the  proposed  investments  for  tranche  1  was  carried  out  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Financial Governance and Management of Investment \nProjects Financed by ADB (2005). All financial costs and benefits were expressed at constant \n2006 prices. Cost streams used to determine the FIRR (i.e., capital investment, operations and \n                                                 \n37 Peshawar\u2013Torkham  Section  2  will  be  implemented  under  batch  2  of  the  MFF  for  the  National  Highway \nDevelopment Sector Investment Program under preparation by NHA. \n38 World Bank. 2003.

Pakistan Public Expenditure Management, Strategic Issues and Reform Agenda. Washington, \nDC (January). \n \n ", "  25\nmaintenance, and taxes) reflect the costs of delivering the estimated benefits. The current toll \nrate was used to estimate revenue, while incremental operation and maintenance costs were \ncharged for each year. \n \n111.  Calculated using conservative traffic estimates and current toll rates as a basis for \naffordability, the FIRR for section 1 of E-1 and E-4 compares unfavorably with the estimated \nweighted average cost of capital. If NHA or a commercial operator is to fully recover the capital \ncosts, revenues must be increased (e.g., non-toll user charges), since the potential to increase \ntolls is limited by the adverse impact of higher tolls on traffic volume.  \n \nE.  Environmental Assessment \n112.  Both the tranche 1 projects under the PFR are category A under ADB\u2019s Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) were carried out for \neach project and their summaries disclosed publicly on the ADB website in May 2006 (E-1) and \nApril 2007 (E-4). The EIAs reported that the potential adverse impacts of the construction and \nimplementation stages could be manageable with adequate mitigation and monitoring programs \nas prescribed in the environmental management plans (EMPs). No component of any project \nfalls in an environmentally sensitive or protected area.  \n \n113.  Environmental assessments for all the ensuing projects under future tranches will be \nconducted in accordance with the Environmental Assessment Review Framework, prepared by \nthe Government and agreed with ADB in compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment  regulations  and  guidelines  (Supplementary \nAppendix G). \n \n114.  The cumulative impacts of the proposed tranche 1 projects may be significant if they are \ntaken together with other interventions in the NTC to 2030. During that period, the trade volume \nis expected to grow exponentially. To address the potential cumulative impacts on land use, air \nquality,  water  resources,  and  public  health,  policy  dialogue  will  be  carried  out  and \nrecommendations made at the strategic and cross-sector level by ADB. A cumulative impact \nassessment has been initiated and its terms of reference agreed with the NHA. The target \ncompletion date will be September 2008 (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n115.  NHA will implement the EMPs. NHA will ensure that bidding documents and contracts \ninclude  the  mitigation  measures  required  in  the  EMPs,  that  the  mitigation  measures  are \nimplemented  by  the  contractors,  and  that  supervision  is  adequate.  An  adequate  budget  for \nimplementation has been provided in the EMPs and capacity building for the NHA safeguard unit \nin environmental management has been included in the Program (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \nF.  Social Safeguards  \n116.  Substantial land acquisition and resettlement impacts are expected for those projects \nthat will require the construction of new roads. Full implementation of the land acquisition and \nresettlement plan will be a condition for initiating civil works. NHA, with the affirmation of the \nMinistry  of  Communication,  has  prepared  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework \nspecifying compensation provisions and preparation and implementation procedures for the \nwhole Program. The framework also covers land acquisition and resettlement plans for the \nprojects under tranche 1, E-4 and section 1 of the E-1. The land acquisition and resettlement \nframework is in Supplementary Appendix J and the land acquisition and resettlement plans are \nin Supplementary Appendix K. Appraisal of subsequent tranches will require a review of the \n ", "26   \nresettlement plan and preparation of land acquisition and resettlement plans for all projects with \nland acquisition and resettlement issues (Appendix 14). \n \n117.  Indigenous  people  will  be  affected  only  by  projects  in  NWFP  tribal  areas.  NHA  has \nprepared  an  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  for  the  Program  (Supplementary \nAppendix L) and has included appropriate actions in the land acquisition and resettlement plan for \nsection 1 of E-1. Appraisal of subsequent tranches will require a review of the indigenous peoples \ndevelopment framework and the preparation of indigenous peoples development plans or actions \nfor all projects with issues relating to indigenous peoples. Full implementation of indigenous \npeoples development plans will be a condition for initiating civil works. The indigenous peoples \ndevelopment framework for the whole the Program is an appendix to the FFA. \n \nG.  Poverty and Social Impact \n118.  Given the type of roads (expressways and motorways) to be financed by the Program, \nthe direct benefits for the poor will not be substantial. The projects will, however, create an \nenabling environment for poverty reduction. The major indirect poverty reduction impacts will \ninclude (i) lower prices for transport services, food, and other daily necessities because of lower \ntransport costs and higher travel speeds; (ii) jobs and income generated from construction and \nmaintenance of the project; and (iii) better access to markets in large cities where goods may be \ncheaper (Appendix 15). \n \nH.  Potential Risks and Assumptions \n119.  The major risk under the investment program would a material reversal of the policy \nframework and instability in the country\u2019s business climate. This risk is likely to be short-term in \nnature. The general elections process will bring about some short term disruptions but most \nanalysts point to a continuation of the reform process, including the so-called second generation \nreforms. \n \n 120.  Improving  the  transit  route  between  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan  will  help  remove \nconstraints to stability and promote subregional cooperation. By developing these roads the \nGovernment is demonstrating its wish to managing the political stability risk in the area. To \navoid the risk that the Program will not be sustainable because of inadequate maintenance, for \neach road improvement the Government will be required to enter into long-term operation and \nmaintenance contracts to be awarded to commercial contractors on the basis of competition. \n \n121.  The ability to attract private sector investment to the sector is another concern. The NTC \nhighway investment plan is simply too large for the public sector to execute entirely through its \nown resources. The Government needs to look outside for funds and partners and this will be \nsupported by the Program. (paras. 50\u201352) \n \n122.  The provincial and district roads that feeds into the NTC needs to be further improved to \nmaximize the benefits of the network. The Government, at federal and local level, needs to \nallocate adequate resources to these smaller but strategically important roads. The NTC Strategy \nwill identify the industries, advantageous location of these as well as logistic hubs along the NTC. \nThis study will assist the Government to identify and concentrate on the key feeder roads.  \n \n123.  Implementation delays are a risk to the Program. For land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities,  delays  will  be  minimized  by  providing  consulting  services  to  support  NHA\u2019s \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. A new position of director of resettlement will be \ncreated  and  the  safeguard  focal  point  position  will  be  upgraded  from  director  to  general \n \n ", "  27\nmanager. The early appointment of the project director has allowed for advanced work to \ncommence  in  land  acquisition.  The  risk  of  delays  because  of  slow  procurement  is  being \naddressed by (i) early ADB approval of tranche 1 project documents for recruiting project \nsupervision consultants and bidding documents for civil works, (ii) early commencement of \nadvance  recruitment  and  advance  procurement  actions,  (iii)  establishment  of  the  project \nmanagement offices, and (iv) appointment of the general manager and the project directors for \nthe tranche 1 projects. In addition, NHA has obtained internal approval of the project pro forma \ndocument, thereby ensuring early loan effectiveness. \n \n124.  An economic analysis of tranche 1 projects suggests there are no significant economic \nrisks. Sensitivity tests and risk analysis show that the projects will be economically viable even \nunder  a  combination  of  adverse  scenarios.  The  risk  of  adverse  social  and  environmental \nimpacts has been addressed through the mitigation measures in the resettlement plan, the EIA, \nand the EMP and through associated conditions and assurances in the project loans. The \nProgram projects will be required to comply with all eligibility criteria before receiving ADB \nfinancing. \n \n125.  The use of a new financing modality over the 10-year implementation period poses a risk \nfor both Pakistan and for ADB. Dedicated ADB program teams will be available to offer advice \nand guide NHA on specific issues and problems pertaining to operations under the MFF. The \nGovernment and NHA are providing ADB with a set of warranties and representations and may \nneed  real-time  support  before  formally  submitting  PFRs  under  the  MFF.  A  core  team  of \nconsultants will be on board to help NHA throughout the PFR process. This is clearly one of the \nadvantages  of  the  MFF.  NHA  has  the  capacity  and  willingness  to  adhere  to  the  MFF \nunderstandings, but from time to time the team in Pakistan will require special assistance.  \n \n126.  In the areas of procurement, accounting, and reporting, capacity will be built in financial \nmanagement, budgeting, management and information systems, and financial planning. The \nlonger-term objective, however, will be to leave in place systems, people, and procedures that \ncan outlive the Program. The Government and NHA are especially keen on this approach and \nwill work with ADB toward this goal. \n \n127.  The fiduciary risk under the Program will be addressed mainly through the arrangements \nmade (paras. 109\u2013111). The financial sustainability of NHA needs to be addressed so that the \nhighway network can be maintained and expanded (paras. 41 and 43). \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n128.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and NHA have given the following \nassurances, which have largely been incorporated in the FFA, and will be incorporated in the \nindividual loan agreement (s) and project agreement (s) as applicable and mutually agreed among \nthe Government, NHA, and ADB for each project under the MFF.   \n \n1.  Resolution of Cash Development Loans \n129.  To  ensure  the  long-term  financial  sustainability  of  NHA,  the  Government  will  take \nnecessary actions to resolve NHA\u2019s accumulated cash development loans by 30 September 2008 \n ", "28   \nby converting the debt to equity and/or grant, or entering into alternative financial arrangements \nsuch as leasing NHA assets transferred by NHA to the Government (RSDF40 M1-4).  \n \n2.  National Highway Authority Business Plan \n130.  NHA will prepare and submit to the Government a 5-year business plan, including a \nfinancing plan, an investment plan, and a budget. The Government will endorse the business \nplan by 31 January 2008 (RSDF M1-2). \n \n3.  Highway Toll Revenue Policy \n131.  To balance the economic benefit to society and the financial benefit to NHA, NHA will, in \nconsultation  with  ADB,  prepare  a  highway  toll  revenue  policy  for  consideration  by  the \nGovernment  in  line  with  the  National  Transport  Policy;  the  policy  will  be  approved  by  \n31 December 2012 (RSDF M1-6). \n \n4.  Contracting of Operation and Maintenance  \n132.  Prior to completion of each highway project in this Program, NHA will enter into a \ncontract or concession for the operation and maintenance of each highway with a commercial \nentity awarded a contract following a competitive bidding process. \n \n5.  Safeguard Strengthening \n133.  In consultation with ADB, NHA will prepare an action plan for safeguards by 31 March \n2008. NHA will also adopt (i) preliminary guidelines for land acquisition and resettlement by  \n30 June 2008 and (ii) guidelines for land acquisition and resettlement to be applied at all NHA \noffices nationwide by 30 November 2008. By 31 December 2007, NHA will upgrade the existing \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  unit  to  be  headed  by  a  senior  officer  at  the  general \nmanager or equivalent level, with a director for environment and a director for resettlement and \nadequately staffed with qualified personnel (RSDF M5-1, M5-2). \n \n6.  Financial Management  \n134.   NHA  will  ensure  that  its  internal  controls  are  adequate  for  preparation  of  financial \nstatements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and for annual \nindependent audit in accordance with International Standards of Auditing. NHA will ensure that \nall qualifications to the audited financial statements will be rectified by 30 September 2008 \n(RSDF M2-3). \n \n7.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n135.  NHA  will  ensure  that  (i)  all  land  and  rights  of  way  required  by  projects  are  made \navailable in a timely manner; (ii) the provisions of the resettlement plans are implemented \npromptly and efficiently according to their terms, applicable laws and regulations of Pakistan, \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework agreed with ADB; (iii) the resettlement plans are updated based on detailed designs, \nare prepared in full consultation with affected persons, and are disclosed to them prior to \nsubmitting the resettlement plans to ADB; (iv) the finalized and updated resettlement plans are \nreviewed and approved by ADB prior to contract award and compensation paid prior to the \n                                                 \n40 Refer to the Road Sector Development Framework in Appendix 5.  \n \n ", "  29\ncommencement of civil works; (v) contractors\u2019 activities are in compliance with requirements of \nthe resettlement plans, the land acquisition and resettlement framework, applicable domestic \nlaws, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy; and (vi) an independent monitor acceptable to \nADB is engaged to carry out monitoring and evaluation and to report to ADB in accordance with \nthe requirements of the resettlement plans. \n \n8.  Private Sector Participation \n136.  The Government will ensure that the Cabinet Commission on Investment confirms the \nrevised  \u201cPolicy  Framework  and  Package  of  Incentives  for  Private  Sector  Participation  in \nHighway and Bridge Projects\u201d by 30 December 2008 (RSDF M6-3). \n \n9.  Indigenous Peoples \n137.  NHA will ensure that all projects affecting ethnic minorities are constructed and operated \nin accordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) as specified \nin  the  indigenous  peoples\u2019  development  framework  agreed  with  ADB  and  the  detailed \nindigenous  peoples  development  plans  (or  resettlement  plans).  NHA  will  ensure  that  the \nindigenous peoples development plans (or resettlement plans) are monitored and evaluated by \nan independent agency. \n \n10.  Environment \n138.  NHA will ensure that (i) the projects are constructed and operated in accordance with \nnational and local environmental procedures and guidelines and with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003);  (ii)  the  projects  are  selected, \ndesigned,  constructed,  and  operated  in  accordance  with  the  EIAs  or  IEEs  and  the \nenvironmental assessment review framework; (iii) the EMPs as reflected in the EIAs and IEEs \nwill be incorporated in bidding documents and civil work contracts and will be implemented; and \n(iv) environmental performance reports will be submitted to ADB twice annually during the \nconstruction period, including progress made on mitigation measures, monitoring, problems \nencountered, enforcement plans, and any violations. \n \n11.  Social Impacts \n139.  Gender. NHA will follow the principles of ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998) during the implementation of each project, including taking all necessary actions to \nensure  that  (i)  equal  opportunities  are  provided  to  women  for  road  construction  activities;  \n(ii) there is no differential payment between men and women for work of equal value; and  \n(iii)  women  living  in  the  project  area  are  encouraged  to  participate  in  planning  and \nimplementation  of  project  activities.  NHA  will  monitor  project  effects  on  women  during \nimplementation of each project through, where relevant, gender-disaggregated data collected \npursuant  to  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  referred  to  in  the  Project  Performance \nMonitoring System. \n \n140.  Sexually transmitted infections. The Government will ensure that all projects financed \nunder  the  Program  include  appropriate  measures  to  mitigate  the  potential  risk of  sexually \ntransmitted diseases (STDs) such as HIV/AIDS. These measures will include carrying out public \nawareness programs on the risks and prevention of the transmission of HIV/AIDS. NHA will \nensure  that  appropriate  information  is  posted  in  selected  areas  along  the  project  roads  \n(e.g., border areas, gas stations, restaurants, and weighing stations) and transport workers and \ntheir families, motorway personnel, relevant police offices, and people in the project areas are \n ", "30   \ntrained. Civil works bidding documents and contracts for each project will include provisions \nrequiring contractors to (i) disseminate information at work sites on the risks of STDs and \nHIV/AIDS as part of the health and safety measures for those employed during construction and \n(ii) take measures to protect workers from potential exposure to STDs and to provide them with \ntesting and treatment if needed. Similarly, the civil works contracts will also include clauses to \nregulate the behavior of workers in relation to the local communities in project areas. \n \n141.  Working conditions and child labor. NHA will ensure through the civil works bidding \ndocuments and contracts that (i) contractors follow legally mandated provisions on health, \nsanitation, and appropriate working conditions including accommodation where appropriate for \nconstruction workers at construction campsites; (ii) contractors do not employ child labor in \nconstruction and maintenance activities; and (iii) appropriate facilities are provided for children \nof laborers in construction campsites, all in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of \nthe Government. \n \n142.  Human trafficking. The Government will ensure that public awareness campaigns on \nhuman trafficking, particularly of women and children, are carried out to reduce the risk of \ntrafficking around construction camps and bus and other transport facilities.  \n \n12.  Execution of Civil Works Contracts \n143.  NHA will ensure that, subsequent to awarding civil works contract under any project, no \nsection or part thereof will be handed over to the contractor until the applicable provisions of the \nland acquisition and resettlement framework and resettlement plans (including in particular the \ntimely  delivery  of  compensation  to  affected  families),  indigenous  peoples\u2019  development \nframework and indigenous peoples\u2019 development plans, and the Environmental Assessment \nReview Framework and EMPs have been complied with. \n \n144.  Any changes to the location, land alignment of roads, or environmental impacts on \naccount of detailed designs of related projects will be subject to prior approval by ADB and the \nrelevant government agency in accordance with the project selection criteria and approval \nprocedures in the FFA. \n \n13.  Project Selection Criteria \n145.  The Government and NHA will ensure that all projects are selected and approved in \naccordance with the agreed criteria and procedures set out in the FFA. NHA will monitor the \nimplementation of projects through completion. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n146.  The effectiveness of the ADF and OCR loan agreements will be subject to a cross-\neffectivity provision. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n147.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I \nrecommend that the Board approve the provision of loans under the multitranche financing \nfacility in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $900,000,000 equivalent to the Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for the National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program comprising  \n \n ", "  31\n \n(i)  the loans not exceeding $890,000,000 equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, with  interest  to  be  determined  in accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)- based lending facility; and \n \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 6,451,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years;  \n \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \nLiqun Jin \nVice President  \n \n \n \n22 October 2007 \n ", "Appendix 1  32\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign   Performance   Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \nImpact  By 2022:    Assumption \nIncreased trade  \u2022 Increased gross domestic  \u2022  National socioeconomic  Government continues with \ngrowth   product from $114 billion  statistics from the Central  policies conducive to economic \n(2006 estimate) to $336  Statistics Office  growth \nbillion      \n  Risk \n\u2022 Increased trade from    Political instability \n$35 billion (2006) to $170  Geopolitical instability \nbillion    \n \nOutcome  By 2017:     \nEfficiency gain for  \u2022 Traffic volume.  \u2022  ADB\u2019s PCR and PPER  Assumptions  \nroad traffic  Peshawar\u2013Torkham  \u2022  NHA \u2018s periodic traffic  \u2022 All other NTC highway \noperation along the  5,000 vehicles per day  counts and surveys  investments are implemented \nNational Trade  (diverted traffic) and  \u2022  Freight Forwarder  as scheduled \nCorridor  8,000 per day  Association statistics  \u2022 Capacity building support for \n  (induced traffic)  \u2022  NHA financial statement  NHA provided by previous \n\u2022 Reduced average  \u2022  Central Statistics Office  interventions successfully \ntravel time.

The transport sector contributes about 10% of Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). \nIt  is  dominated  by  road  transport,  which  carries  91%  of  passenger  traffic  in  passenger-\nkilometers and  96%  of  freight  traffic  in  ton-kilometers. Road  transport  services  are  mainly \noperated  by  private  sector  enterprises  with  the  small  share  of  government-owned  goods \nhandled by a public sector agency. At the local and intra-regional level, the road transport \nindustry is characterized by poor service quality and unreliability.  \n \n2.  Overall demand for road transport has increased rapidly in recent years. Gains in traffic \non the road network have been at the expense of the railway network, which will require \nsubstantial and expensive upgrading over an extensive period. In the meantime, the demand for \nroad transport will continue to increase.  \n \n3.  Trucks comprise almost half of non-urban road traffic; cars, 30%; and light vehicles and \nbuses, 20%. The truck fleet is dominated by obsolete and underpowered vehicles and has not \nchanged  radically  in  the  last  20  years.  Changes  in  truck  configuration  have  been  largely \nconcentrated in the long-haul fleet, where the number of rigid three-axle trucks and tractor-trailer \nunits has increased much more quickly than the number of rigid two-axle units. Stringent vehicle \ntesting and better enforcement of legislation governing vehicle conditions will be more effective \nat improving vehicle fleet efficiency and safety than road infrastructure upgrading.   \n \n4.  The trucking industry is very competitive with minimal barriers to entry and a large \nnumber of operators. Haulage rates are low and have fallen over the last 20 years, despite \nincreases in fuel prices.1 The long-distance trucking industry (where customers require a more \nreliable  and  secure  service)  is,  however,  less  competitive.  Acquisition  of  newer,  modern \nvehicles is expensive and beyond the means of all but a few vehicle owners. As a result, there \nare few long-distance operators, and they can and do impose significantly higher haulage rates \nfor long-distance traffic.  \n \nB.   Provision of Roads \n5.  The total road network is about 260,000 kilometers (km), of which about 11,400 km are \nnational highways, 92,500 are provincial highways, and 150,000 are district or urban roads. \nResponsibility for managing the total road network is vested in the federal National Highway \nAuthority (NHA)2 and in provincial and district administrations. NHA is responsible for national \nhighways,  including  limited-access  motorways,  partly-limited-access  expressways,  and \nunlimited-access highways. About 7,000 km of the national highway network are two-lane, \nundivided roads. Travel on roads is severely constrained by non-motorized traffic and by slow-\nmoving motorized traffic. As a result, transportation is inefficient and travel times, delivery times \n                                                 \n1  Transport Competitiveness in Pakistan. Report No. 36523. 2006. World Bank South Asia Region quotes annual \ndeclines in freight rates of 1.4% per year and an increase in fuel prices of 3.2 % per year. \n2  The National Highway Authority (NHA) is an autonomous agency with a functional structure and regional offices for \nwork implementation. NHA has limited capacity, particularly in strategic planning, asset management, project \nmanagement  and  network  operation.  Concurrently,  it  is  introducing  modern  road  asset  management  and \nmaintenance systems for operation and maintenance and integrating them into day-to-day operations. Under the \nNHA Act, 1991, NHA is permitted to receive funds from various sources, including loans and grants from the \nfederal government, foreign aid and grants and other receipts (lease monies, fees, rentals, fines etc) and is able to \nfloat bonds and charge road user fees.  \n ", "Appendix 2  36\nfor  goods,  and  transport  costs  are  higher  than  they  should  be.  Road  safety  is  also \ncompromised. \n \nC.   Issues and Challenges \n6.  Accessibility. Roads are not equally distributed throughout the country. In terms of road \nlength per capita, Sindh Province is the best served in terms of road density (0.57 km/km2) and, \nexcept for Baluchistan, is also best in terms of population per kilometer of road (2,420 km per \nmillion). Baluchistan Province is significantly better served in terms of km per capita (5,909 km \nper million).  \n \n7.  Road conditions. A survey of road conditions was carried out on motorways and other \nnational highways from December 2005 to March 2006.3 The results in terms of roughness of \npavement are presented in Table A2.1.  \n \nTable A2.1: Condition of Motorways and National Highways in Pakistan (2006) \n    Pavement Condition   \n    Good   Fair   Poor   Bad   Under  Total \nconstruction \n  IRI  < 4  4 -6 6 -8 >8  \nMotorways  km  439  21 4 0 145  608\n%  72%  3%  1%  0%  24%   \nNational  km  4,959  2,032  1,756  751  1,285  10,783 \nHighwaysa \n%  38%  18%  17%  7%  13%   \nIRI= International Roughness Index; km = kilometers. \na About 646 km of national highway in urban areas was not surveyed but is included in the total. \nSource: National Highway Authority.  \n \n8.  It can be seen that 75% of the motorway network and 56% of the national highway \nnetwork are in good or fair condition. This suggests there have been significant improvements in \nroad conditions since 2000, when about 63% of the national highway network was in poor or \nbad condition. \n \n9.  About 75% of the network is two-lane undivided roads that are 6\u20137 meters wide. On \nthese roads theoretical capacity and running speeds are largely unattainable because of the \namount of non-motorized traffic and slow-moving truck traffic. Operating conditions and road \nsafety are further undermined by the encroachment of commercial and other developments on \nthe roadside. Only 25%of the network is either four- or six-lane roads. Overall, average travel \nspeeds are estimated to be little more than 25 km per hour (kph) compared with 75 kph in \ndeveloped countries. Accident rates are estimated to be 10 times higher than in developed \ncountries.  \n \n10.  The condition of the provincial roads is significantly worse than that of the national \nhighway network. Many roads are either permanently impassable or subject to closure during \nbad weather. \n \n                                                 \n3  Annual Maintenance Plan for Fiscal Year 2006-07. \n \n ", "37  Appendix 2 \n11.  Road funding. The NHA development and maintenance budgets have traditionally been \nunderfunded. Development funds are in the form of government cash loans and are currently \nabout PRs25 billion annually, which is below the PRs40 billion per year needed to meet the \ngovernment  plan  for  motorway  construction.    Annual  maintenance,  repair,  and  operational \nexpenditures  for  existing  motorways  and  national  roads  are  funded  from  several  sources: \ngovernment  grants  (approximately  PRs1.4  billion),  road  tolls  net  of  collection  costs \n(approximately PRs4.5 billion), and miscellaneous income from right-of-way leases, police fines \nfor traffic infringements and overloading, and advertising. Road maintenance expenditures have \nbeen increasing and represent a rising proportion of total expenditures; however they remain \nwell below needs, which are in excess of PRs10 billion per year.   \n \n12.  In  all,  NHA  receives  an  annual  income  of  PRs6\u20137  billion.  This  compares  with  an \nestimate of PRs8 billion for current expenditures, plus another PRs1\u20132 billion to meet the \nmounting backlog of road and bridge repairs. Raising maintenance funds to the level of need \nwill require either more revenues from road users or larger government grants (increases in \nlease revenues or police fines are unlikely to be significant). If road tolls were to be increased, \nthere would be a negative impact on traffic volume and in any case the Government would \nprobably not agree to a toll increase.  \n \n13.  Road maintenance. NHA has established a road asset management directorate to plan \nand oversee maintenance operations. Local supervision and monitoring are carried out by NHA \nregional offices. Surveys of road conditions are carried out annually and from these annual work \nprograms are prepared using the HDM-4 model.4 There is also an annual consultation with \nstakeholders for their input on the need for maintenance.  For fiscal year 2007, the funding \nrequirement  for  the  national  highway  network  and  motorways  was  estimated  at  \nPRs14 billion for periodic maintenance and rehabilitation plus about PRs3 billion for routine \nmaintenance.  The  available  total  budget  for  the  year  was  under  PRs7  billion,  and  a \nmaintenance program was prepared according to the amount allocated to NHA. Increases in toll \nfees to eliminate the government grant have been resisted but are the long-term aim. Proposals \nto establish a road fund are also under consideration  \n \n14.  Road accidents. Since 2000, reported road accidents have averaged over 10,000 per \nyear and have resulted in about 5,150 fatalities. At about 10 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles, this \nrate is very high when compared with developed countries but low for developing countries. An \nearlier Asian Development Bank (ADB) report estimates, however, that the actual fatality rate is \nover 30 per 10,000 vehicles.5 There are no official audits to support either contention.  \n \n15.  The main causes of road accidents are driving at speeds inappropriate to vehicle and road \nconditions, lack of safety awareness, poor discipline, and poor enforcement of regulations. Under \nthe  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  Road  Development  Sector  and  Subregional \nConnectivity Project,6 a pilot project on road safety will be carried out for sections of the national \nhighway in NWFP. It is intended that the findings and recommended actions will be applied \nthroughout Pakistan. \n                                                 \n4  The Highway Development and Management System (HDM-4) is a software system for formulating options for \ninvesting in road transport infrastructure. \n5  ADB. 2005.

Major initiatives to date to reduce accidents have been confined to motorways and \nnational highways. These include providing safety barriers and creating the National Highway \nand  Motorway  Police  (NHMP).  In  practice,  the  NHMP  concentrate  its  activities  on  the \nmotorways where the present force of 836 staff represents more than 2 persons per km.   \n \n17.  Vehicle  overloading. Vehicle overloading is a major cause of premature pavement \ndeterioration and of road accidents.  \n \n18.  There are 54 vehicle weighing stations throughout Pakistan. As in many other countries, \nthey are ineffective in restricting axle loading and keeping truck loads to within legal limits. The \nlevels of fines are low (about Rs100 per excess ton of load) and represent an insignificant \namount in relation to haulage revenues and load value. Where overloading is extreme, many \ndrivers are unable to pay and the fine is overlooked. Neither unloading facilities nor storage \nspaces are available at the weighing stations; therefore, offloading so that loads can be reduced \nto within the legal limits is not possible. \n \n19.  Even new trucks lack the full efficiency and performance characteristics available in \nother countries. About 30% of the components in locally assembled vehicles are local and have \nlower specifications than those available elsewhere. Imported vehicle designs are generally old \ntechnology, including, for example, the use of naturally aspirated rather than turbo-charged \nengines. Importing second-hand trucks is limited to dump trucks, but many are converted for \ngeneral freight haulage. \n \n20.  Overloading further compounds the problem of low basic performance of trucks. As a \nresult, truck traffic is slow and reduces the speed at which traffic in general can flow, even on \nmotorways and other roads in good condition. \n \n21.  Private sector participation. Private sector participation will be an essential component \nof proposed trade and transit initiatives, including highway development. The NHA development \nplan identifies projects valued at PRs8.730 billion for public\u2013private sector financing. However, \ndifficulties have been encountered in attracting private sector interest and an appropriate legal \nframework has yet to be put in place. Under the current condition only a small number of \nprojects in the pipeline would be able to attract adequate private sector interest.  .   \n \nD.  Road Sector Policy  \n22.  The Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF) 2005\u20132010 outlined government \npolicy for the transport sector. It included the following:7 \n \n(i)  optimal utilization of existing capacity with an emphasis on rehabilitation and \nupgrading; \n(ii)  selective  and  cost-efficient  investments  in  economically  viable  new  roads \nincluding expanding the rural network; \n(iii)  developing a road network to facilitate transport and trade with Afghanistan, the \nCentral Asian republics and India; \n(iv)  developing  innovative  financing  mechanisms  and  enhancing  private  sector \nparticipation; \n                                                 \n7  The road sector policy is being reviewed under TA 4400-PAK: Technical Assistance to Pakistan for Transport \nPolicy Support. \n \n ", "39  Appendix 2 \n(v)  prioritizing road maintenance and safety; \n(vi)  effective control of overloading on the roads; and \n(vii)  enhancing the capacity of the road sector agencies. \n \nE.   Road Sector Development Plan \n23.  NHA has prepared a comprehensive plan up to 2015 for upgrading the national road \nnetwork  and  extending  the  motorway  system.  The  cost  of  implementing  this  plan  is  \nPRs480 billion ($8 billion) of which about half is expected to be funded by external assistance \n(Table A2.2). \n \n24.  The plan provides for improvements to 6,500 km of existing roads and the construction \nof 2,500 km of new expressways and motorways. Parallel plans for improving 7,600 km and \nconstructing 4,500 km of provincial roads and special-area roads are also proposed in the \nMTDF. \n \nTable:A2.2: National Highway Development Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n(2006\u20132015)a \n       \nFinancing Source  PRs million  $ million  Percentage (%) \nPSDP (on-going and new)b  184,440  3,074  38.33 \nPrivate Sector  34,623  577  7.19 \nDevelopment Partner       \n     World Bank  94,927  1,582  19.73 \n     ADB  122,228  2,037  25.40 \n     Japan  34,406  573  7.15 \n     People\u2019s Republic of China  4,588  76  0.95 \n     Republic of Korea  6,000  100  1.25 \nTotal  481,212  8,020  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ERA = Earthquake Relief Authority, MTDF = medium-term \ndevelopment framework, PRs = Pakistan Rupees, PSDP = Public Sector Development Programme, \nWAPDA = Water and Power Development Authority. \na Amounts of Developing Partners and Government are the planned figures and not committed. \nb MTDF, WAPDA, ERA, private sector counterpart and securitization.  \nSource: National Highway Authority.

Private sector \nparticipation will be sought in the form of maintenance and operation contracts after completion \nof the roads.   \n \nTable A3.3: NTC Highway Investment Plan\u2013Roads Proposed to be Financed by ADB \nNumber Section Financed By  Km Rs Mil $Million ADB  PFR Timing Contract  Planned \nMFF 2 Start Completion \nE-1  Peshawar - Torkham (Section I)  Tranche 1 34    7,986        132      106  2007 2008 2012\nE-4 Faisalabad \u2013 Khanewal   Tranche 1 184  34,909        577      439  2007 2008 2012\nE-6    Shikarpur \u2013 Ratodero  Tranche 2 44    9,061        150     120  2010 2011 2014\nE-2   Peshawar Northern Bypass   Tranche 2 34    5,313          88       70  2010 2011 2014\nE-35  Havellian \u2013 Manshera  Tranche 2 47  11,965        198     155  2010 2011 2014\n Subtotal  343   69,234      1,144      890 \nNumber Section Financed By  Km Rs Mil $Million ADB  PFR Timing Contract  Planned \nMFF 1 Start Completion \nE-1 Peshawar - Torkham (Section II)  PFR2 17    7,865        130     104 2008 2008 2012\nN-35 Hasanabdal \u2013 Havellian  PFR3 50    6,637        110       88 2008 2011 2014\n Subtotal 67  14,502         240      192 \nNumber Section Futher  Km PRs M $Million ADB  Timing Contract  Planned \nFinancing Start Completion \nM-7   Dadu - Dureji \u2013 Hub   Tranche 1 270 2 5,671       4 24     339 2009 2010 2014\n Subtotal  270   25,671         424      339 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, E = expressway, Km = kilometer, N = national highway, M = motorway, MFF 1 = National Highway Development Sector \nInvestment Program Multitranche Financing Facility, MFF2 = National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program Multitranche Financing Facility, PFR = \nPeriodic Financing Request.\nSource: National Highway Authority Document dated May 2007 and Asian Development Bank estimates dated September 2007.  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 4  42\n \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE ROAD SECTOR \n \nFunding  Amount \nProject  Year \nSource  ($ million) \n       \nFarm to Market Roads Project  ADB  38.00  1986 \nSecond Farm to Market Roads Project  ADB  113.00  1990 \nProvincial Highways Project  ADB  165.00  1992 \nFlood Damage Restoration Project  ADB  78.00  1993 \nSukkur Bridge Project  ADB  45.00  1994 \nRural Access Roads Project  ADB  123.00  1996 \nRoad Sector Development Program (Sindh)  ADB  200.00  2001 \nPunjab Road Development Sector Project  ADB  150.00  2002 \nBaluchistan Road Development Sector Project  ADB  185.70  2003 \nNWFP Road Development Sector and Subregional \nADB  301.20  2004 \nConnectivity Project \nNational Highway Development Sector Investment \nADB  770.00  2005 \nProgram \n  Subtotal    2,168.90   \n       \nIndus Highways, Phase I  JBIC  71.00  1989 \nIndus Highways, Phase II  JBIC  173.00  1991 \nRural Roads Construction  JBIC  95.00  1993 \nIndus Highways, Phase IIB  JBIC  152.00  1993 \nKohat Tunnel Construction (I)  JBIC  45.00  1994 \nKohat Tunnel Construction (II)  JBIC  34.00  2001 \nIndus Highway Construction Project (III)  JBIC  166.00  2006 \n  Subtotal    736.00   \n       \nFirst Highway Project  World Bank  17.00  1964 \nThird Highway Project  World Bank  50.00  1980 \nFourth Highway Project  World Bank  152.00  1987 \nTransport Sector Project  World Bank  184.00  1991 \nKarachi Port Modernization  World Bank  91.40  1992 \nTrade and Transport Facilitation  World Bank  3.00  2001 \nHighway Rehabilitation Project  World Bank  365.00  2003 \n  Subtotal    765.40   \n       \nTotal    3,767.30   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, NWFP = North-West Frontier \nProvince. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n ", "43  Appendix 5 \nROAD SECTOR DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK \nImplementation Timeframe\nComponent Designation Action 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\n1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4\nPolicy Dialogue and Milestones\n1.

Requirements \n1.  The following are the requirements for each road section under the National Trade \nCorridor Highway Investment Program (the Program). \n \n(i)  The objective of the Program is to develop and improve road connectivity and \nefficiency along the main north\u2013south national highway to support the National \nTrade Corridor (NTC). Out of about 1,900 kilometers (km) of total highway length, \nthe Government has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to assist in \nthe  construction  and  improvement  of  about  346  km  in  the  NTC  highway \ninvestment plan. \n \n(ii)  The projects will be technically sound, and a feasibility study and preliminary \ndesign will be prepared. The National Highway Authority (NHA) will ensure that \ndetailed  design  reports  of  the  respective  packages  are  prepared  within  the \noverall time frame agreed for the Program and not more than 5 months after \nproject approval. A road safety audit will be conducted during project design. \n \n(iii)  The projects will be economically feasible and financially sustainable, and their \nestimated economic internal rate of return will be equal to or higher than 12%, or \nthe roads will be a key section integral to the connectivity of NTC, based on an \neconomic analysis to be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects (1997). \n \n(iv)  Environmental screening in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines (2003) will be conducted for all civil works packages. The selected \nroad  sections  will  not  pass  through  or  be  within  or  less  than  1  (km)  from \nprotected  areas  as  designated  by  the  Government,  including  sanctuaries  or \nnational parks. For each project, an environmental assessment report will be \nprepared, including an environmental management plan in accordance with the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework. \n \n(v)  In line with the larger objectives of the Program, the highway sections will be \nsocially sound and include measures to mitigate any possible social impacts. For \neach package, an initial poverty and social assessment will be conducted in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines on initial poverty and social assessment. \n \n(vi)  Resettlement plans for each package will be prepared in accordance with the \nland acquisition and resettlement framework and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement. \n \n(vii)  If any indigenous peoples or tribal peoples are likely to be affected significantly \nby any civil works package, an indigenous people\u2019s development plan or special \naction will be prepared following the measures set forth in the indigenous people \ndevelopment framework. \n \n(viii)  All necessary federal and provincial government approval will be obtained; and \n ", "Appendix 7  47\n \n(ix)  Sufficient Government counterpart funding will be allocated to implement the \nprojects. \n \nB.   Procedures \n2.   Each project will be prepared and processed in accordance the following procedures: \n \n(i)  A feasibility study for projects will be conducted by consultants engaged by NHA, \nwho will fill out checklists for initial poverty and social assessment, involuntary \nresettlement,  indigenous  people,  and  environmental  screening.  These \ndocuments will be sent for review to ADB and may require revisions. \n \n(ii)   Upon completion of the detailed design, NHA will prepare and submit to ADB a \nsummary  appraisal  report  for  each  project,  together  with  the  required \nattachments, including a land acquisition and resettlement plan, environmental \nassessment, summary poverty reduction and social strategies, and indigenous \npeople development plan or special action plan for indigenous people if required. \n \n(iii)   NHA will translate each project\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement plan into the \nlocal language (Urdu and/or possibly Pashtu) and disclose it to affected people \nbefore submitting it to ADB. NHA will revise the resettlement plan if required, \nbased on comments from affected people and from ADB. \n \n(iv)   NHA (and ADB) will disclose each project summary environmental assessment \nreport for category A or B projects to the public 120 days before ADB's approval \nof the relevant periodic financing request. \n \n(v)   ADB  will  review  the  summary  appraisal  reports,  together  with  the  required \nattachments. If it finds that the project does not satisfy eligibility criteria and \nprocedures, or does not comply with ADB's policies, ADB may advise NHA to \nmodify the project. In addition, NHA will prepare draft pro forma (PC1) reports \nand forward them at the same time as the appraisal reports to ADB. \n \n3.   Based on ADB's approval, and subject to any modification and remedial measures \nrequired by ADB, NHA will implement the projects. NHA will ensure that ADB has access to all \ndocuments related to the project proposals and approval process. These documents should be \nkept for 5 years after approval. \n \nC.   Organizational Arrangements \n4.   NHA will appraise the projects, and ADB will advise NHA to comply with the eligibility \ncriteria and procedures and to follow other relevant policies. \n \n5.   The  project  management  office,  assisted  by  the  technical  audit  team  (formed  from \nexperts within the project management office and NHA) will process the projects for quality \ncontrol of preparation and contract implementation. This team will review and examine all \ntechnical  reports,  including  feasibility  studies,  preliminary  design  reports,  environmental \nassessment reports, land acquisition and resettlement plans, and detailed design reports, to \nensure that Government and ADB requirements are fully met.  \n \n ", "48  Appendix 7 \n \n6.   The  technical  audit  team  will  evaluate  the  viability  of  each  project  and  prepare  a \nsummary appraisal report to be submitted to ADB for approval.

Economic Evaluation of the National Trade Corridor Highways \nA.  Freight Movement \n1.  The main urban centers of Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad\u2013Rawalpindi attract over \n33% of Pakistan\u2019s traded goods. Two thirds of the volume of interregional trade originates \nfrom  Punjab  province,  particularly  the  areas  of  Lahore,  Sargodhar,  and  Sheikharpura, \nfollowed by Islamabad\u2013Rawalpindi and Multan. The highest trade volumes are within Punjab \nprovince and the northern and central areas of Sindh. The highest intra-provincial cargo flow \nis from west Punjab to north-east Punjab (22,700 tons). Other flows exceeding 15,000 tons \nannually are northern Punjab to northeastern Punjab and vice versa, northern and central \nSindh to Karachi, Karachi to southern Baluchistan, Karachi to northeastern Punjab, and \nsouthern Baluchistan to Karachi. All these flows except for those to and from Baluchistan are \nserved by highways forming part of the National Trade Corridor (NTC). Most use less than \n30% of the total corridor length. \n \nB.  Overall Travel Performance \n2.  The  north\u2013south  roads  have  accommodated  much  of  the  increase  in  freight \nmovement. Traffic volumes throughout the main highway network were estimated using \nCube Software. Forecasts for transport demand were derived from the comprehensive data \nset created during the Pakistan Transport Plan Study1. This model uses vehicle operating \ncosts and travel time as the determinants for the assignment of origin, i.e., destination road \ntransport  demand.  The  current  traffic  on  the  existing  roads  ranges  from  about  2,000 \npassenger car units (pcu)/day in Torkham\u2013Landi Kotal (N5) to 15,000 pcu/day in Umarkot\u2013\nRohri (N5) and 22,000 pcu/day in Karachi\u2013Hyderabad (M9).  \n \n3.  Under  a  \u201cdo-minimum\u201d  scenario  where  ongoing  road  works  and  other  nominal \nrehabilitation works were taken into account, the vehicle and capacity ratios of N5 road \nsections in 2015 were estimated at about 0.7 or above, which is theoretically reaching \ncapacity.  \n \nC.   Economic Feasibility of National Trade Corridor Highways \n4.  The \u201cdo-minimum\u201d was compared with a \u201cwith development\u201d case in which all the \nNational Transport Corridor highway investment plan proposed works were included. The \ntotal financial cost of the road development program of about 3,700 km of roads and four \nnew  bridges  was  estimated  at  PRs264  billion  (exclusive  of  land  acquisition  and  price \ncontingency). It is assumed that this expenditure will be incurred over the period 2008\u20132014. \nSubsequent  increases  in  maintaining  the  road  network  will  rise  to  an  average  of  \nPRs3.7 billion per year.  \n \n5.  Commercial vehicle travel times between Peshawar and Karachi are currently over \n72 hours but would be reduced to about 36 hours following the completion of National \nTransport Corridor highway investment plan. As traffic grows on the new roads, the impact \non reduced speeds caused by the increase in the number of cars will be significantly less \nthan without the capacity added by the new roads. As a result the savings in travel time will \ngrow more rapidly than the savings in vehicle operating costs. This is without allowing for \nincreases in the unit value of time which, with increased real incomes, should also rise. \n \n                                                 \n1 Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2006. Pakistan Transport Plan Study in the Islamic Republic of \nPakistan. Tokyo. \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \n \n6.  There will be a gradual build-up of benefits from reduced vehicle operating costs as \nthe improved network is expanded. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the \noverall National Transport Corridor highway investment plan is 39%, inclusive of the values \nof time. Without a value assigned to time, the EIRR was estimated at 34%. The share of \nbenefits shifts from predominantly savings in vehicle operating costs to benefits from savings \nin time (Table A13.1). Total savings were estimated at an average of PRs200 billion per year \nor about 3% of the Pakistan\u2019s 2005 gross domestic product (GDP).  \n \nTable A13.1: National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Plan Benefits \n(PRs million) \n \nYear  Without  Program  With  Program  Benefits  \nVehicle  Passenger  Vehicle  Passenger  Vehicle \nTravel time \n   operating  travel time  operating  travel time  operating \nsavings \ncosts  value  costs  value  cost savings \n2015  1,650,876  149,363  1,490,058  123,909  160,818  25,454 \n2020  2,275,311  282,305  2,098,575  211,105  176,736  71,200 \n2025  3,287,493  615,052  3,062,030  433,816  225,463  181,236 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates, 2007. \n \n7.  The less rapid increase in savings in vehicle operating costs compared with savings \nin time reflects the onset of renewed congestion even with the proposed road capacity \nincreases. As truck traffic is less sensitive to travel time, it will increasingly revert back to the \npresently used roads and away from the new roads as traffic volumes on the new roads \nincrease. This indicates that further increases in capacity will be required within the next 20 \nyears. This was a conclusion of the Pakistan Transport Plan Study, which suggested that the \nmotorway system should include two parallel north\u2013south motorways, one on each side of \nthe Indus River.  \n \nII.   Sensitivity Test: Economic Evaluation of Tranche 1 Projects \nA.  Methodology \n8.  A sensitivity test was performed to assess the worst-case scenario (only individual \nprojects under tranche 1 are constructed). Standard methods were used to evaluate the \ntime-related economic costs and benefits directly associated with the proposed roads. The \ncosts are the resources needed to construct and maintain the road. Benefits are savings by \nroad users, including travel time. Because the road does not replace an existing road that \nwould have continued to be maintained, no significant savings in road maintenance will be \nrealized. \n \n9.  The existing roads will be maintained in good condition but travel speeds on them will \nremain low even after the project road is completed because of non-motorized and slow-\nmoving motorized traffic. Therefore a speed-related rather than a pavement-roughness-\nrelated, vehicle operating cost model was used to calculate road user costs with and without \nthe project. Estimated speeds are assumed to decline slightly over time in both models on \nthe existing roads as traffic grows. There will also be some decline in speeds on the project \nroad as traffic increases, but these reductions will be more modest. Benefits associated with \nthe reduced incidence and severity of road traffic accidents was not included.  \n \n10.  Civil works and vehicle operating costs have been estimated at 2006 prices. Road \nmaintenance costs were estimated at PRs150,000 per year for routine maintenance and \nPRs 2,000,000 per intervention for periodic maintenance. It was assumed that there would \nbe  periodic  maintenance  interventions  in  the  8th  and  15th  years  following  opening.  A \nresidual value for the project of 10% of capital cost has been included in the final year of the \nevaluation period of 20 years. \n \n ", "Appendix 13  59\n \n11.  Traffic growth rates on the project roads are forecast to be slightly higher than the \nnational average.  This is based on expectations of increased trade between Pakistan and \nAfghanistan and the restoration of and subsequent sustained growth in personal travel \nbetween the two countries. The analysis assumes the annual growth rates in total traffic on \nthe route range will be 7.0\u20139.0% between 2005 and 2010, and 5.5\u20137.0% after 2020 for \nvarious types of vehicles. \n \n12.  The proposed projects are new roads on new alignments and will compete for traffic \non the existing road. Therefore there are no normal traffic benefits to evaluate. Generated \ntraffic is generally restricted to increased demand for travel (vehicle-kilometer) as a result of \nreduced costs and travel time. The improved NTC highway network will contribute to the \nfaster general development of areas along the corridor and thus to the economy. However, \nthe economic development is not attributable solely to highway improvements. The, NTC \nhighways will provide only limited links between areas of potential production and local \nmarkets. Therefore, a conservative approach was taken by not including generated traffic in \nthe  particular  projects.  The  benefits  will  be  restricted  to  those  associated  with  traffic \ndiversion. \n \n13.  Travel time values for cars were estimated based on PRs50 per hour for three \noccupants for travel during working time (20% of total trips) and 25% of hourly income for \nnon-working time trips, i.e., PRs60 per hour. For minibuses and buses, passenger time was \ncalculated as for car drivers but valued on the basis of an hourly income of PRs12.7. Value \nper vehicle assumes an average load of eight passengers in minibuses, while for large \nbuses an average passenger occupancy of 20 was assumed. No value was assigned to \ngoods in transit. \n \n14.  The  economic  analysis  was  conducted  using  domestic  prices.  Financial  costs, \nincluding  physical  contingencies,  were  converted  into  economic  costs  using  a  specific \nconversion factor for civil works of 0.85. \n \nB.   Peshawar\u2013Torkham Section I Project \n1.   Description of Project \n15.  This road forms part of the N-5 arterial road. It will lead westwards from Peshawar in \nNorth-West Frontier Province through Khyber Pass to the Pakistan\u2013Afghanistan international \nborder. The total length of the new road from Peshawar to the border is 51 km; the project \nsection of 34 kilometers (km) commences at the junction between the existing N-5 road and \nthe proposed Peshawar Northern Bypass. The final 17 km ending at the international border \nis being constructed with ADB assistance under the multitranche financing facility for the \nNational Highway Development Sector Investment Program.2 \n \n16.  The proposed project will construct a new four-lane highway on an alignment to the \nsouth of the existing road. The existing road passes through the towns of Jamrud after about \n6 km and Landikotal about 6 km from the Afghanistan border. The new road will pass very \nclose to the town of Jamrud but will bypass Landikotal about 2 km south of the town center. \n \n2.  Traffic Forecast \n17.  Traffic in 2005 varied from about 8,330 vehicles per day (vpd) at the Peshawar end \nof the highway to 5,400 vpd between Jamrud and Landikotal and to 3,330 vpd between \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2005.

Manila  (RRP:  PAK  36052,  approved  in  22  November,  for \n$770,000,000) \n ", "60  Appendix 13 \nLandikotal and Torkham. The composition of traffic also varied with passenger car traffic \nfalling from about 50% at the Peshawar end to under 20% beyond Landikotal. The growth \nrate was about 17% per year. \n \n18.  The split in traffic on the existing and new roads has been estimated for each vehicle \ncategory. Cars, jeeps, and pick-ups will probably favor the new road, where they can travel \nmore quickly and will make fewer intermediate stops; it is assumed that 75% of the vehicles \nin this category will use the new road. More minibuses will stay on the existing road so they \ncan make frequent intermittent stops in built-up areas: it is assumed that only 33% will divert \nto the new road. It is assumed that large buses will be divided equally between the existing \nand the new road. Larger, heavier trucks are more likely than 2-axle trucks to be carrying \ninternational trade; it is assumed that 50% of 2-axle trucks, 60% of 3-axles and 80% of \narticulated trucks will divert to the new road. \n \n19.  The traffic forecasts of the new road are presented in Table A13.2. \n \nTable A13.2: Traffic Forecast for Peshawar\u2013Torkham Section  \n(number of vehicles) \n  Traffic on  Traffic Forecast on New Road  \nExisting Road  (assuming existing road remains open) \n  2005  2013  2015  2020  2025  2030 \nAnnual Average Daily             \nTraffic Total  6,356  3,893  4,425  6,021  8,050  10,777 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates, 2007. \n \n  3.   Economic Analysis \n20.  Costs  are  based  on  the  construction  of  a  four-lane  divided  road  with  2-meter \nshoulders  on  either  side.  Total  costs,  including  civil  works,  physical  contingency,  and \nsupervision, are estimated at PRs6 billion.  \n   \n21.  The new road will divert an estimated 60% of the traffic from the existing road. Traffic \nretained by the existing road on the section as far as Jamrud will be traffic servicing areas \nalong the existing alignment, essentially some private cars, most minibuses, and some \ntrucks, particularly the smaller trucks used for local deliveries. Some public service traffic will \nuse the existing road and some will use the new road. For the evaluation, the existing road \nand the new road are assumed to share this traffic equally. Total vehicle operating cost \nsavings are estimated to increase from PRs370 million in 2012 to PRs700 million in 2020.  \n \n22.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated at 10.6% (Table A13.3). \nMuch of the benefit will accrue to Afghanistan\u2019s economy, as much of the traffic comprises \nthe transport of international trade with Afghanistan and the carriage of Afghani passengers. \nThe vehicle operating cost savings and time savings used in the present analysis are taken \nas proxies for these benefits to Pakistan. The project is only marginally viable because of the \nhigh capital cost. The likelihood of having only this project implemented is very small given \nthat the Peshawar\u2013Torkham sections 1 and 23 and the Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal (E-4) section \nwill  be  under  ADB  financing.  Construction  of  the  sections  that  will  provide  shorter \nconnections between Peshawar and Multan will result in higher benefits to society and an \nEIRR of 14.0%. Construction costs are based on final draft of the detailed designs and \nshould therefore be well within 10.0% of the cost estimates. A cost reduction of 10.0% would \nresult in an EIRR of 13.0%, and a cost increase by 10.0% will reduces it to 11.4%.  A \nreduction in costs may be achieved when the contract is awarded. In the meantime, in order \nto enhance the project\u2019s worth, NHA will re-examine the design and cost estimates to seek \nsavings in areas that do not compromise road strength, pavement quality, or safety.

It will form a central section of the nationwide expressway and \nmotorway network, with sections already completed or under construction in the north linking \nPeshawar, Islamabad, and Lahore.

Traffic volumes and origin-destination surveys on existing roads in the area were \ncarried out in September 2004,4 2005,5 and 2006.6 The E-4 will attract long-haul traffic, \nmainly from the N-5 national highway located to the east; some traffic that currently uses \nparallel provincial roads; and possibly some traffic from the N-55 to the west (Table A13.4). \nTraffic  on  the  new  expressway  will  comprise  traffic  between  northern  and  central  and \nsouthern Pakistan, including some long-distance traffic to and from PRC, and from parts of \nAfghanistan to central and south Pakistan, including the international ports. There will be \nlittle attraction for long-distance traffic between eastern and western Pakistan to use the \nexpressway. \n \nTable A13.4: Traffic Forecast for Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal (E-4) \n(number of vehicles) \nPotential \nDiverted traffic assuming remainder of network \ndivertable \nremains undeveloped\ntraffic\n2007 2013 2015 2020 2025 2030\nTotal AADT 4,430 6,278 7,678 10,528 14,156 19,055  \nAADT = annual average daily traffic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates, 2007. \n \n                                                 \n4 Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal motorway (E-4).

Economic Analysis \n26.  Costs are based on construction of a four-lane divided road with 2-meter shoulders \non either side. The total financial cost of implementation over 4 years, including civil works, \nphysical contingency, and supervision is estimated at PRs26 billion. \n \n27.  The project will divert traffic from existing roads. By extending the M-1, M-2, and M-3 \nmotorway network, it will offer a higher speed link for through traffic from the north of \nPakistan and its neighbors to the north and northwest to southern Punjab, Sindh, and the \nocean ports of Pakistan. Traffic to and from Baluchistan and southern Afghanistan will not be \naffected significantly. Benefits to diverted traffic will be realized as higher speeds attained. \nGenerated benefits directly associated with the project will not be significant. \n \n28.  The project is economically viable with an estimated EIRR of 15.4%. (Table A13.5) \nThis value does not include benefits that derive from reduced traffic on roads from which \ntraffic has been diverted. However, much of the congestion on Pakistan\u2019s roads is a result of \nconflict  between  traffic  of  significantly  different  speeds  and  that  conflict  will  remain \nunresolved  unless  traffic  is  better  regulated.  In  addition,  heavily  loaded  trucks  will  be \nreluctant to transfer to roads where load controls will be more strictly monitored so road \ndeterioration rates will not be significantly reduced unless monitoring is stricter for the new \nas well as existing roads. A 20.0% cost increase would result in a fall in the EIRR to 13.3%, \nindicating  no  significant  threat  to  the  economic  viability.  The  traffic  growth  rates  have \nassumed sustained economic growth; if growth rates are 20% below the forecast, the EIRR \nwould fall to 13.6%. If the rate of diversion is 20.0% lower than that estimated, the project \nremains economically viable with an EIRR of 13.5%.  \n \nTable A13.5: Summary of Results of Economic Analysis  \nfor Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal (E-4) \n(PPRs million) \n \nNet  Vehicle  Total net \nCapital  Time \nYear  maintenance  operating cost  benefit \ncost  savings \ncost  savings  stream \n2007\u20132011  21,886.4  0.0  0.0  0.0  -21,886.4 \n2012  0.0  3.5  2,778.1  214.1  2,988.6 \n2015  0.0  3.5  3,434.4  262.9  3,693.8 \n2020  0.0  3.5  6,510.9  490.0  6,997.4 \n2025  0.0  3.5  6,510.9  490.0  6,997.4 \n2030  0.0  3.5  8,862.8  662.4  9,521.7 \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return   15.4% \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates, 2007. \n \n ", "Appendix 14  63\nSUMMARY OF SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS \nI.  Background \n1.  The Government of Pakistan has requested support from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to undertake the National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program (the Program). \nWith the National Highway Authority (NHA) as the executing agency (EA), the Program will be \nfinanced through a multitranche financing facility (MFF) and will finance road sections in the \nNational Trade Corridor. The MFF is expected to have two tranches, each covering several \nprojects which in case of new motorways or highways will entail significant land acquisition and \nresettlement impacts. MFF appraisal includes the appraisal of the projects under tranche 1: \nsection  1  (kilometer  [km]  1  to  km  34)  of  the  Peshawar\u2013Torkham  Expressway  and  the \nFaisalabad\u2013Khanewal expressway (E-4). Projects in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) may \nhave impacts on indigenous people.  \n  \nII.  General Procedures \n2.  Land acquisition and resettlement will follow the laws of Pakistan, ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  ADB  Operations  Manual  section  on  involuntary \nsettlement.1 MFF and each tranche appraisal and the approval and implementation of each \nproject with land acquisition and resettlement or indigenous people issues will require the \npreparation of the following documents:  \n(i)  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  and  an  indigenous  people \ndevelopment framework (IPDF) for the whole MFF to be reviewed, updated, and re-\napproved by ADB annually and before the preparation of each tranche; \n(i)  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  for  each  tranche,  indicating  whether  land \nacquisition and resettlement or indigenous people impacts are expected, and if so their \ntype and magnitude;  \n(ii)  a land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) for each project with land acquisition \nand resettlement with detailed design and impact figures and compensation budgets and \nschedules;2 \n(iii)  an indigenous people development plan (IPDP) or relevant indigenous people action for \neach project affecting indigenous people.  \n \n3.  The appraisal of the MFF and of each tranche and the approval and implementation of \neach  project  under  a  tranche  will  follow  these  land  acquisition  and  resettlement-related \nconditions. \n(i)  MFF and tranche 1 appraisal: preparation of a LARF and an IPDF for the MFF and \nLARPs and IPDPs (or LARPs that include indigenous people action plans) for all tranche \n1 projects with land acquisition and resettlement or indigenous people impacts.  \n(ii)  Other tranche appraisals: A review and update of the LARF and IPDF and preparation \nof a LARP and an IPDP (or indigenous people actions) for all tranche projects that have \nland acquisition and resettlement or indigenous people impacts. \n(iii)  Start of project civil works: LARP and IPDP implementation. \n \n4.  To meet these conditions, NHA has prepared a LARF and an IPDF for the whole MFF, \none LARP for Peshawar\u2013Torkham Expressway section 1, and one LARP for expressway E-4. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. Manual (OM Section F2/BP).  \n2 As noted in the ADB Operations Manual Section F2/OP & BP (2006), a resettlement plan\u2019s complexity rests on \nimpact severity. If impacts are severe (> 200 people resettled or with >10% income losses), a project is classified as \ncategory \u201cA\u201d and a full plan is prepared. If impacts are not severe (<200 people resettled or with <10% income \nlosses), a project is classified as category \u201cB\u201d and only a short plan is prepared. \n \n ", "64  Appendix 14 \nThe LARP for the Peshawar\u2013Torkham Expressway incorporates the indigenous people action \nplan.  \n \nIII.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework \n5.  The LARF are based on the following principles: (i) land acquisition and resettlement will \nbe avoided or at least minimized; (ii) compensation will guarantee the maintenance of the pre-\nproject living standards of the people affected; (iii) those affected will be fully informed and \nconsulted on compensation options; (iv) their sociocultural institutions will be supported and \nused; (v) land acquisition and resettlement provisions will apply equally to women and to men; \n(vi) lack of formal title will not be a bar to compensation and/or rehabilitation; (vii) particular \nattention will be paid to households headed by women and to vulnerable groups; (viii) land \nacquisition and resettlement will be conceived and executed as an integral part of the project \nand  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  budgets  will  be  included  in  project  costs;  and  \n(ix) compensation will be fully provided before ground leveling and demolition. The LARF also \ncover all issues relevant for effectively conducting land acquisition and resettlement tasks so \nthey comply with ADB policy (Paras. 7\u201311 of this appendix). It establishes the eligibility and \ncompensations entitlements as laid out in Table A14.1.   \n \nTable A14.1.

Institutional responsibilities. NHA has overall responsibility for land acquisition and \nresettlement preparation, implementation and financing and will exercise its functions via a \nproject management unit (PMU) and project implementation units. At the PMU, land acquisition \nand resettlement tasks will be handled by a land acquisition and resettlement unit. This unit will \nbe aided by a social safeguard team under the project preparation and supervision consultants \nand by nongovernmental organizations or impact assessment or valuation consultants hired for \nimpact surveys or monitoring assistance. The PMU will coordinate with local governments that \nhave jurisdiction over land administration and valuation. At the provincial level, these are tasks \nof the Board of Revenue, and at the district level, they are handled by the District Collector\u2019s \nOffice and the Land Acquisition Collector. Minor agents such as patwari (land record keeper) will \nidentify and verify titles. Compensation for assets other than land or income rehabilitation is the \nresponsibility of the relevant district department. To ensure effective coordination with local \ngovernments  and  other  agencies,  NHA  will  establish  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nsteering committee at the provincial level and a land acquisition and resettlement coordinating \ncommittee at the district level. ADB clearance for category B LARPs or IPDPs will be done by a \nsocial development specialist hired at the resident mission. Category A projects will be cleared \nat ADB headquarters.  \n  \n7.  Disclosure  and  public  consultation.  Preparation  of  LARPs  will  require  intensive \nconsultations with affected persons, the results of which will be fully documented in the LARPs. \nAs an appraisal condition, LARF and LARPs in English will be disclosed on the ADB website \nwhile LARF and LARPs in the local language (Urdu and/or possibly Pashtu) will be disclosed \nlocally. \n \n8.  Grievance  procedures.  Grievances  will  first  be  handled  at  the  village  level.  If  no \nsolution is reached, the persons affected will then lodge a complaint with the land acquisition \nand resettlement unit. If no settlement is reached, the case can, with land acquisition and \nresettlement coordinating committee support, be brought to the PMU. If the grievance remains \nunsettled after 3 weeks, the persons affected will be able to seek redress at the appropriate \ncourt.  \n \n9.   Monitoring and evaluation. PMUs will internally monitor and report to the EA on land \nacquisition and resettlement implementation. The EA will report to ADB quarterly. External \nmonitoring will be assigned to an independent agency by the EA, and external monitoring \nreports  will  be  submitted  to ADB  twice  a  year.  At  the  end  of  project  implementation,  the \nindependent monitoring agency will carry out  a general evaluation of land acquisition and \nresettlement implementation. \n \n10.  Finances and schedules. The LARF prescribes that each LARP include detailed land \nacquisition and resettlement budgets and provide clear schedules linking land acquisition and \nresettlement tasks with the initiation of civil works. \n \nIV.  Indigenous People Issues \n11.  Indigenous people will be affected only by projects in NWFP tribal areas. No area with \ngroups fitting ADB\u2019s definition of indigenous people will be affected in Punjab. The LARP for \nsection 1 of the Peshawar\u2013Torkham Expressway includes the required indigenous people \naction plan. To comply with ADB\u2019s indigenous people policy provisions, NHA has also drafted \n ", "66  Appendix 14 \nan IPDF for the whole MFF detailing (i) project processing conditions relating to indigenous \npeople; (ii) IPDP preparation or implementation requirements; (iii) definitions of indigenous \npeople in Pakistan; (iv) results of a general social assessment; (v) an indigenous people \nstrategy for the Program and the type of action related to indigenous people that is needed;  \n(vi) IPDP participation instruments; and (vii) general processing and implementation issues. \n \n12.  Based on IPDF provisions and the results of the social assessment, it is assumed that \nPakistan\u2019s definition of \u201ctribal peoples\u201d fits ADB\u2019s definition of \u201cindigenous people\u201d. Therefore \n\u201ctribal  peoples\u201d  will  be  substituted  for  \u201cindigenous  people\u201d  in  the  preparation  of  specific \ndocuments. Also, based on IPDF provisions, the appraisal of each tranche will include an \nindigenous peoples identification assessment (IPIA) providing (i) general information on projects \nlikely to affect indigenous peoples, the relative magnitude of impact expected, and the number \nor type of IPDPs to be prepared ,and (ii) an outline of indigenous people groups to be affected, \nincluding  an  overview  of  their  demography,  social  organization,  livelihood  or  land  tenure \nfeatures, relations with government or other groups, adaptation to outside society or culture, and \nlocal governance. \n13.  The IPDF also indicates the type of actions needed, based on the magnitude of impacts \nand the situation. This action will be of two types.    \n(i)  If impacts affecting indigenous people are limited to land acquisition and resettlement but \nhave no broad community or systemic effect requiring the rehabilitation of an entire \nproduction system, specific actions related to indigenous people will be integrated in the \ntext of the LARP.   \n \n(ii)  If  impacts  affecting  indigenous  people  go  beyond  standard  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement effects and cause broad disruption with systemic sociocultural dimensions \nand wide economic and community effects, a stand-alone IPDP, including a detailed \naction plan, schedules, and budgets, will be prepared. The stand-alone IPDP will not \nonly cover land acquisition and resettlement issues, it will also provide a detailed action \nplan  based  on  direct  participation  by  indigenous  people  in  the  socio-economic \nrehabilitation of the affected communities, including providing community development \npackages. \n \n14.  Institutional responsibilities. Based on the IPDF, NHA has overall responsibility for \nactions related to indigenous people, including IPDP preparation, implementation, financing, and \nmonitoring through the PMU and the project implementation units. The PMU will be assisted by \nthe land acquisition and resettlement unit and the social safeguard team under the project \npreparation and supervision consultants and by nongovernmental organizations in project areas. \nThe PMU will coordinate with local government authorities in tribal areas and with indigenous \npeople communal organizations and will carry out all activities related to indigenous people in \nsuch a way as to follow the administrative or political process prevalent in tribal areas. In \nparticular, the PMU will carry out these tasks together with the political agent and the district \ncoordinators\u2019 offices and through them make workable arrangements with concerned tribal \nleaders (maliks, sardars and/or khans) who in turn will consult their tribal councils (Jirgas) and/or \ncommunities to make the final decisions and take necessary actions in line with the project\u2019s \nrequirements. To ensure coordination with tribal territorial governments, political agents will be \nmembers of the land acquisition and resettlement steering committee in NWFP and of the land \nacquisition and resettlement coordinating committee at the district level.  \n  \n15.  Complaints  and  grievances.  Complaints  from  affected  indigenous  people  will  be \naddressed to the political agent\u2019s office via tribal leaders and councils. If convinced, the political \nagent will then call on the PMU or NHA headquarters to discuss, negotiate, and resolve the \nissues at hand. If NHA, the political agent, and the tribal leaders cannot find mutually agreeable \nsolutions to a grievance, the project will not be implemented.  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 14  67\nI6.  Public  consultation  and  disclosure.  Indigenous people  tasks  will  be  planned  and \nexecuted on the basis of intense consultations with affected communities and will entail the \nsigning of specific land acquisition agreements by the tribal elders, the political agent, and NHA.  \n \n17.  As an appraisal condition, IPDF and IPDPs in English will be disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite while IPDF and IPDPs in local languages (Urdu and/or possibly Pashtu) will be posted \nlocally.  \n \n18.  Monitoring and evaluation. Internal monitoring of IPDP implementation will be done by \nthe PMU and reported to NHA. NHA will report to ADB quarterly. External monitoring will be \nassigned to an independent agency by NHA, and external monitoring reports will be submitted \nto ADB once a year. At the end of project implementation, the independent monitoring agency \nwill carry out a general evaluation of IPDP implementation. \n \n19.  Finances and schedules. The IPDF prescribes that each stand-alone IPDP will detail \nbudgets and provide clear schedules linking land acquisition and resettlement tasks with the \ninitiation of civil works. \n \nV.  Impacts of Tranche 1 Projects \n \n20.  Tranche 1 of the MFF covers two projects: (i) the Peshawar-Torkham Expressway \nsection 1, and (ii) the Faisalabad\u2013Khanewal expressway (E-4). LARPs were prepared for \nthese two projects and have been included in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n21.  The  Peshawar-Torkham  Expressway  (E-1)  will  affect  88  households  (2,417  affected \npersons) who will lose 121 structures (36 houses, 67 shops or commercial structures and 18 \ndismantled houses). Nearly 179.37 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired, of which 1.43 ha is \nprivate residential or commercial plots and 177.94 ha communal land belonging to various \nPathan clans of the Afridi tribe. Land losses will have minimal impact on livelihood as the \naffected areas are essentially barren, stony hills. The overall budget for the resettlement \ncomponent is estimated to PRs643.89 million. \n \n22.  E-4, will affect 9,209 households (9,050 households loose land\u20148,113 as owners, \n727 as tenants and 210 as lease holders) with an overall population of 65,370 persons; of \nthese, 207 families will lose a house and 19 will lose businesses. Other impacts include 1 \nmosque, 1 school, 5 tube wells, 5 cattle yards, 3 shops, 2 brick kilns, a poultry farm, a \nhatchery, a soap factory and a petrol pump that will be affected to varying degrees. Finally, a \ntotal  of  18,000  wood  trees  and  13,295  fruit  trees  will  be  affected.  Costs  of  LARP \nimplementation  are  estimated  at  PRs6.45  billion  (inclusive  of  impacts,  compensation, \nadministrative costs, and contingencies) \n \n ", "68  Appendix 15 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nA.  Links to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national   Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?    national priority in country poverty   \n    No  partnership agreement?     No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty Reduction: \nBased on an analysis of the determinants of poverty, Pakistan\u2019s poverty reduction strategy explicitly \nrecognizes  that,  while  economic  growth  and  service  delivery  are  crucial  for  poverty  reduction, \ninfrastructure development (including aviation, ports, railways, and roads) is critical as a catalyst for \ngenerating economic activity, employment, and accelerating growth. Better transport infrastructure also \nhelps  to  integrate  Pakistan\u2019s  provinces  and  regions.  Increases  in  trade  with  neighboring  countries \nfacilitated through highways and other means contributes to macroeconomic stability and reduces risks of \nshocks for the vulnerable poor.  \n \nConsultations with local communities during poverty reduction strategy formulation indicated that the need \nfor improved connectivity and access to markets through rural roads was a key issue for the poor. The \nprovision of electricity was another. Rural\u2013urban links promoted through improvements in highways and \nroads help to ensure greater stability of income and more off-farm employment in rural areas, where the \nmajority of Pakistan\u2019s population and the poor live. In support of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy, ADB recognizes the potential of subregional cooperation through the better transportation links. \nTransportation is expected to contribute to macroeconomic growth and to increase revenue to the national \ngovernment (and therefore indirectly to lead to an increase in social spending that benefits the poor, who \nhave a disproportionate interest in public social spending). In addition, better accessibility helps reduce the \nurban\u2013rural gap and leads to more economic activity, generating off-farm employment for the poor. \nHowever, macroeconomic growth in Pakistan will not necessarily translate into reductions in the social \ngap.1 \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification : General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe number of poor2 in Pakistan more than doubled in the 1990s, increasing to 45 million in 1999. Of this \nfigure, 33 million or 73% (4.7 million households), were estimated to live in rural areas. Moreover, Pakistan \nranks poorly in major social indicators: the infant mortality rate in rural areas is 106 per 1,000 live births \nand the percentage of malnourished children under 5 is 39%. An important feature of poverty in Pakistan \nis the clustering of incomes around the poverty line, as 40.5% of the nation\u2019s population falls in a narrow \nincome range around this line. Approximately 12.2% of the total population may be classed as chronically \nor extremely poor. According to a Social Policy Development Center assessment (1990-2000), over a 10-\nyear period the disposable income of the top income quintile grew in real terms by 23%, while that of the \nlowest quintile grew by 3%, increasing the gap between the rich and the poor.3 Factors that affect the \nlivelihood of the poor include (i) low literacy; (ii) lack of access to appropriate technologies, government \nextension services, off-farm employment opportunities, and formal credit; (iii) social exclusion; (iv) gender \ndiscrimination; (v) exclusion from benefit of development projects; and (vi) poor service delivery.  \nThe direct impact of the projects on the poor is not expected to be substantial, since the roads would not \nbe primary roads. Instead, they are partially limited access or limited access roads, motorways, and \nexpressways. Benefits for the poor would take the form of improved local employment prospects during \nproject construction. The projects will create significant employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled \nlabor during implementation. Unskilled labor will be employed directly in road construction, rehabilitation, \nand maintenance and indirectly in providing materials and services for contractors. The projects will \ngenerate approximately 26,000 person-months of unskilled labor \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No \nIs there a participation strategy?

Additional assistance to households headed by women will be provided as \npart of the resettlement plan.
