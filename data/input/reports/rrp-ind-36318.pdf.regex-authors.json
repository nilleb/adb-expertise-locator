The \nstrategy will support the high-growth agenda of the Government of \nIndia (the Government) through assistance for fiscal consolidation, \nprivate sector development, and infrastructure development. The \npower  sector  is  one  of  the  major  sectors  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment, where ADB\u2019s intervention will be directed to policy \nreforms and capacity building, combined with physical investment \nsupport. The SDP supports the restructuring of the power sector \nin Assam to create an efficient, self-sustaining, and competitive \npower sector to ensure that electricity will be supplied in adequate \nquantities, in an efficient manner, and at reasonable cost to all \nconsumers. \n \nGiven the present constraints on the power sector in Assam\u2014\nsuch  as  load  restriction  and  system  limitations,  lack  of \naccountability, and the critical financial position of the sector\u2014the \ngovernment  of  Assam  (GOA)  has  committed  to  make  policy \ninterventions to restructure the sector. To effectively remove these \nconstraints,  the  interventions  at  policy  level  need  to  be \nunderpinned by immediate investments to technically improve the \nefficiency of the power system. Therefore, a mixed modality of a \nsector development program is considered the best instrument for \nsupporting power sector restructuring.  \n   \nThe Policy Loan   \n   \nObjectives  The  objectives  of  the  policy  loan  are  to  support  reforms  and \nrestructuring of the state\u2019s power sector and to (i) strengthen the \nfunctions and capacity of Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission \n(AERC), (ii) develop appropriate policies for implementation of the \nsector  reform,  (iii) restructure  Assam  State  Electricity  Board \n(ASEB), and (iv) undertake power tariff reforms.  \n \nComponents and  The major components and outputs of the policy loan comprise: \nOutputs  (i) ensuring  independence  of  AERC;  (ii)  developing  regulatory \nframework; (iii) developing appropriate policies for implementation \nof the sector reform; (iv) reorganization and financial restructuring \nof ASEB; and (v) rationalizing the tariff structure and developing \nrules for independent tariff setting. \n   ", "iv \nEnvironmental  The Project is classified as environment Category B. An initial \nAssessment  environmental examination was undertaken and a summary of it is \npresented in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nThe environmental assessment of the policy actions is presented \nin Supplementary Appendix B. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $150,000,000 from ADB\u2019s OCR will be provided under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan will have a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee \nof 0.5%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan and Program Agreements. \n   \nExecuting Agencies  The executing agencies of the policy loan will be the Finance \nDepartment and the Power Department of GOA. \n   \nProcurement  The proceeds of the policy loan will finance the foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local taxes and duties) of eligible items, produced \nin and procured from ADB member countries. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  Counterpart  funds  will  be  used  by  GOA  in  accordance  with \narrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support  adjustment costs \nassociated with the Program, including (i) retirement of defaulted \nbonds  and  loans,  (ii) payment  of  dues  under  a  financial \nrestructuring plan (FRP) of ASEB, and (iii) funding of cash shortfall \nof the sector. \n   \nThe Investment Loan   \n   \nObjectives  The objectives of the investment loan are to assist ASEB and its \nsuccessor  companies  to  (i) improve  system  capacity  and \nefficiencies by strengthening transmission and distribution system, \n(ii) increase  revenue  by  introducing  a  revenue  management \nsystem, and (iii) increase the reach of electricity in rural areas. \n   \nComponents and  The investment component (the Project) of the SDP comprises \nOutputs  five components: \n \nPart A: Improvement of Transmission System; \nPart B: Improvement of Distribution System;  \nPart C: Intensification of Rural Electrification;  \nPart D: Revenue Management System; and \nPart E: Consulting Services. \n   ", "v \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $100,000,000 from ADB\u2019s OCR will be provided under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan will have a term of \n20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee \nof 0.5%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan and Project Agreements. \n \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be executed by the Power Department of GOA \nArrangements and  and ASEB or its successor companies  (Assam Electricity Grid \nExecuting Agency  Corporation  Limited  (AEGCL)  and  distribution  companies \n(DISCOMs), with the prior approval of ADB). These companies \nhave been duly incorporated and registered under the Companies \nAct, 1956. \n   \nProcurement and  Goods and services procured by ASEB  and  financed  by  ADB \nConsulting Services  under the Project will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The social and poverty assessment shows that all categories of \nBeneficiaries  consumers will benefit from the sector reform. The short-term \nnegative impacts from tariff rationalization will be more than offset \nby improvement of quality of power supply and indirect benefits \nfrom  industrial  growth.  No  negative  impact  on  the  poor  is \nenvisaged from the short-term tariff increase.  \n  \nThe  rural  electrification  component  of  the  Project  will  directly \nbenefit  the  poor  through  substantial  savings  on  fuel  and  time \nspent on household activities, and better educational and health \noutcomes  from  access  to  electricity.  The  Project  will  provide \nelectricity supply to approximately 78,000 rural households, 3,500 \ncommercial  consumers,  and  1,850  industrial  and  other \nconsumers. \n \n ", "vi \nRisks and Safeguards  The  major  risks  to  the  Program  are  (i) consistent  political \ncommitment  to  underpin  the  reform  process,  (ii) regulatory \ncapacity  to  ensure  AERC\u2019s  independence  and  make  timely \nregulatory decisions, and (iii) availability of human resources to \nimplement the Project and drive cultural change in Assam Power \nGeneration Corporation Limited (APGCL), AEGCL and DISCOMs. \nThe  risks  have  been  mitigated  through  (i) enactment  of  the \nElectricity Act 2003 of the Government providing for a complete \nlegal framework for power sector reforms; (ii) GOA\u2019s commitment \nto  the  industry\u2019s  structure,  the  reform  roadmap,  and  the \ngovernance structure, the FRP of ASEB, and transitional cash \ndeficit  support  to  its  successor  companies;  (iii) stakeholder \ncommunication  program;  (iv) GOA\u2019s  commitment  to  provide \nnecessary resources to AERC; and (v) ADB\u2019s extensive technical \nassistance (TA) support for capacity building of AERC and ASEB \nemployees and for change management in APGCL, AEGCL and \nDISCOMs. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Three TAs are included in the SDP. These are (i) reorganization \nof ASEB, for $1,000,000;  (ii) institutional development for rural \nelectrification, for $400,000; and (iii) policy and legal support for \npower sector reforms, for $100,000. These TAs will be financed \nfrom the India Trust Fund of the Department for International \nDevelopment, United Kingdom, for $1.5 million, and administered \nby ADB. \n ", "vii \n \n ", "  1\nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  proposed \nassistance to India for the Assam Power Sector Development Program (SDP) that includes (i) a \npolicy loan and (ii) an investment loan. The report also describes proposed administration of \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  (i) reorganization  of  Assam  State  Electricity  Board  (ASEB), \n(ii) institutional development for rural electrification, and (iii) policy and legal support for power \nsector reforms, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TAs. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  Pro-poor growth is the main strategic pillar for reducing income poverty in the Country \nStrategy and Program for 2003\u20132006 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The strategy will \nsupport  the  high-growth  agenda  of  the  Government  of  India  (the  Government)  through \nassistance for fiscal consolidation, private sector development, and infrastructure development. \nThe power sector is one of the major sectors in infrastructure development where ADB\u2019s \nintervention will be directed to policy reforms and capacity building, combined with physical \ninvestment support. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program also provides for extended coverage \nto the northeastern region, where poverty incidence is much higher than the national average, \nand where significant potential for regional cooperation exists.  \n \n3.  Recognizing its inability to fund the additional investments required for delivering high-\nquality power at a reasonable price, the government of Assam (GOA) has decided to restructure \nthe power sector to increase its operational efficiency, delivery capacity, and self-financing \ncapability, and to free budget resources to be reallocated to social sectors. In March 2001, GOA \nsigned a memorandum of understanding with the Government and committed to reforming its \npower sector. Based on the memorandum of understanding, GOA established Assam Electricity \nRegulatory Commission (AERC) in August 2001 and initiated the reform program including \nenergy auditing, computerization, distribution profit center approach, and labor rationalization. \nTo  further  proceed  with  the  reform  program,  GOA  has  requested  assistance  from  ADB \n(Appendix 1).  \n \n4.  In response to GOA\u2019s request, ADB included the SDP in the India Country Strategy and \nProgram for 2003. In preparation for the SDP, ADB approved a TA1 grant to advise GOA on \ndesign and implementation of the restructuring of ASEB and support ASEB in preparation of \nimmediately needed investment projects. ADB also approved a TA2 grant funded by the Japan \nSpecial Fund for capacity building of AERC to strengthen the regulatory framework and capacity \nfor the power sector reforms. An ADB loan appraisal mission visited Assam, India from 25 \nAugust to 15 September 2003. This report is based on the agreements reached during the \nmission. \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n5.  Assam is a small state with a total population of 26.6 million. It is in the center of \nnortheastern India and is a strategic corridor for southeast Asia. Assam\u2019s per capita income of \n$212 is less than two thirds of the national average; 89% of its population are widely scattered \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Assam Power Sector Development Program. Manila.  \n2  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for Building the Capacity of Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission. \nManila. This TA started in October 2003. \n ", "2  \nacross rural areas, and 36% of households are living below the poverty line, compared to the \nnational average of 26%. Although Assam is blessed with natural resources such as oil, natural \ngas, and minerals, and has thriving tea and rubber plantations, its industry has not grown \nsignificantly since independence due to a lack of investments from outside the state. \n \n6.  Since independence, the power sector of Assam has grown based on the state\u2019s natural \nresources of oil and natural gas and the hydropower potential of the northeast, in response to \nthe  requirements  of  the  population  spread  extensively  over  a  large  geographical  area \ninterspersed with a thriving tea plantation industry. However, the power sector in Assam today is \nfacing a situation where, due to various constraints, operation of generation, transmission, and \ndistribution systems is becoming difficult to sustain at the desired level. Power is supplied to \nonly  950,000  households  (out  of  4.5 million)  and  per  capita  power  consumption  is  only \n104 kilowatt-hours (kWh), which is less than one third of the national average of 359 kWh.  \n \n7.  ASEB is a vertically integrated utility, fully owned by GOA, and it, exclusively, supplies \npower in the state. It has an installed capacity of 574.4 megawatts (MW) comprising 572.4 MW \nof thermal power and 2 MW of hydropower. Of the thermal capacity, 300 MW is not operational \nfor reasons such as costly fuel, design problems, and inadequate maintenance. This results in a \nplant load factor of 15%, compared to the national average of 70%. ASEB\u2019s own system meets \nonly 120 MW out of total peak demand of 614 MW. The deficiency is being met by power \nbought from central public sector undertakings (CPSUs)3 and neighboring states. Transmission \nand distribution (T&D) losses are estimated at 41% due to lack of investment and maintenance, \nand to nontechnical losses.  \n \n8.  Poor performance of the power sector has also been a major impediment to industrial \ngrowth. The lack of sufficient and reliable power is eroding Assam\u2019s competitiveness and \nprevents it from attracting industrial investments from outside the state. Improved power supply \nat a reasonable cost is, therefore, essential to revive the state\u2019s industry and its economy more \ngenerally. Equally important is improving financial sustainability of the power sector so that it is \nno longer a drain on state finances. The power sector\u2019s demands on the state budget have \nresulted in allocation of public funds at the expense of other state responsibilities, such as \neducation and health. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n  \n9.  The power sector of Assam is faced with three major constraints that need to be urgently \naddressed: (i) significant load restrictions and system constraints, (ii) lack of accountability, and \n(iii) ASEB\u2019s critical financial position and heavy dependence on government resources.  \n \n1.  Constraints \n \n10.  Load Restrictions and System Constraints. Power demand grew by 9% in FY2003; \nthe demand-supply gaps are estimated at about 20% in peak power terms and 6% in energy \nterms. This suppressed demand resulted in frequent scheduled and unscheduled load cuts, \nstemming from frequent outages in some of the generation stations in the northeastern region \nand lack of capacity of ASEB\u2019s T&D system. The quality of the power supply is inadequate due \n                                                 \n3  Enterprises owned by the Government. ASEB purchases power and fuel from CPSUs, including National Thermal \nPower  Corporation  (NTPC),  North  Eastern  Electric  Power  Corporation  (NEEPCO),  National  Hydro  Power \nCorporation (NHPC), Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL), Oil of India (OIL), and Gas Authority of India \n(GAIL). ", "  3\nto lower than normal frequency and fluctuating voltages. In addition, inaccurate billing due to \ndefective meters and a manual billing system, as well as a long lead-time for connection and \nmaintenance, are contributing to low levels of customer satisfaction.  \n \n11.  Lack of Accountability. While regulation of the power sector has been removed from \nGOA by establishment of AERC, there is a need to make a clear distinction between policy \nmaking and regulation of the sector. This requires developing a detailed regulatory framework \nand  enhancing  capacity  of  AERC.  The  present  organizational  form  of  ASEB,  a  vertically \nintegrated utility heavily dependent on state resources, does not ensure accountability of either \nGOA or ASEB in their respective roles. There is a lack of motivation among ASEB employees \nbecause of (i) low levels of authorities; (ii) mismatch between responsibilities and authorities; (iii) \nperceived low level of compensation; and (iv) lack of  objective performance measurement \nsystem.  \n \n12.  Critical Financial Position.  ASEB\u2019s high cost structure, coupled with GOA-directed \ntariff setting in the past and poor billing and collection, has significantly undermined its financial \nhealth. GOA, due to its critical fiscal condition, has been unable to provide adequate support to \nASEB\u2019s revenue gap. ASEB has defaulted on payments to most of its creditors and has found it \ndifficult to raise capital in the market in the recent times. As a result, lack of capital investments \nand poor maintenance have decayed the power system and caused the quality and coverage of \nthe power supply to deteriorate. ASEB\u2019s chronic liquidity problem has prevented it from filling \nthe supply shortage by power purchases, despite the power surplus situation in the northeastern \nregion.  \n  \n  2.  Objectives and Strategy of the Government of Assam \n \n13.  GOA has launched a comprehensive program for restructuring the power sector in order \nto ensure that electricity will be supplied in adequate quantities, in an efficient manner, and at \nreasonable cost to all consumers in the state. GOA issued its \u201cPower Policy Statement 2003\u201d in \nJanuary this year. In it, GOA clearly expressed its commitment to undertake sector reform \nthrough (i) providing an appropriate legal framework for reform, keeping in view the national \nlegislative framework and the interests of its people; (ii) reorganizing and unbundling ASEB into \ncorporatized functional companies; and (iii) strengthening the independent tariff setting and \nregulatory capacity of AERC. \n \n14.  In line with the recommendations of an ADB TA,4 ASEB introduced a profit center \napproach in its 14 \u201cdistribution circles\u201d as a first step to unbundling and corporatizing its \noperations in 2002. In all circles, billing and collection, and maintenance functions have been \nseparated to sharpen focus on revenue collection, and decision-making authority for routine \noperational matters has been delegated to the heads of the circles. ASEB has started an \nextensive distribution modernization program covering all 14 distribution circles, with assistance \nfrom the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program (APDRP) of the Government. \nTo further accelerate its reform efforts, GOA requested ADB assistance to address the three \nmajor issues of the power sector, namely, (i) financial distress of ASEB and increasing burden on \nthe state budget; (ii) the operational and system constraints of ASEB; and (iii) low service quality \nand coverage. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2000.

To  sustain  poverty  reduction,  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  of  the \nGovernment targets a high growth rate of 8% per year, requiring a very high rate of investment. \nADB positions its support in the power sector as a major intervention to achieve pro-poor growth \nthrough  infrastructure  development.  At  state  level  operations,  ADB  has  adopted  a  sector \ndevelopment program modality, recognizing that physical investment support would not contribute \nto  pro-poor  economic  growth  unless  sector  reform  is  undertaken  simultaneously.  Another \nimportant  challenge  in  achieving  high  growth  is  a  major  fiscal  turnaround.  ADB  is  directly \naddressing this issue through its support in improving public resources management. ADB\u2019s \nsupport to the state power sector reforms is also intended to indirectly support state fiscal \nconsolidation, as the power sector is the major drain on the state\u2019s financial resources. ADB is \nsupporting the power sector reforms through its state-wide operations and is aiming to ensure \nsustainability of the power sector reform program through its long-term interventions in the \nstate-wide reforms, including support for the public resources management. ADB operations in \nthe Indian power sector and coordination with other major funding agencies are discussed in \nAppendix 2 and 3.  \n  \n16.  Lessons Learned. ADB\u2019s 2001 evaluation study5 on program lending identifies several \nkey factors to increase the efficacy, sustainability, and development impact of program lending. \nMany of these have been incorporated in the design of the SDP. To ensure GOA\u2019s ownership of \nthe reform package, the policy matrix has been designed to require all hard policy decisions \nbefore the first tranche release. The SDP includes extensive TA support for building the major \nplayers\u2019 capacity for designing and implementing reform programs. \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s experience in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh shows that an effective and flexible \ncoordination needs to be assured between the power sector reform program and the public \nresource management program, as power sector reforms have a significant impact on the state \nbudget. In these states, the Public Resource Management Program loans6 preceded the Power \nSector Development Program loans7 and did not fully take into account the possible impact of \npower sector reforms on the state budget. Therefore, state budgetary support for the power \nsector reforms was severely constrained by the availability of the budget and the conditionalities \nincorporated in the Public Resource Management Program loans. Learning from these lessons, \nand given the more serious fiscal condition of Assam as well as the magnitude of the impact of \nthe power sector reforms on the state\u2019s budget, ADB decided to start with a power sector reform \nprogram so that a follow-on loan for public sector resource management8 can be designed to \naddress fiscal consolidation of the state while fully incorporating the fiscal impact of power \nsector reforms. \n \n18.  Another lesson learned from others states is the importance of state government support \nfor financial restructuring of a state electricity board and insulation of a transmission company \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001.

In Orrisa, all past liabilities of the power sector were transferred to new \nsector companies and the government of Orissa did not provide any financial support for  the \ncompanies  to  service  the  liabilities.  In  addition,  a  transmission  company  was  vested  with \nintermediary function of bulk power purchase and supply between generation companies and \ndistribution companies. As a result, distribution companies, overburdened with past liabilities, \ndefaulted on payments to the transmission company and the transmission company, in turn, \ndefaulted on payment to the generation companies. This also affected the principal business of \nthe transmission company. On the basis of these lessons, the SDP has been designed to focus \non the successful implementation of a financial restructuring plan (FRP) for ASEB with GOA\u2019s firm \ncommitment to take over part of the past liabilities of the sector and provide transitional financial \nsupport for cash deficits of new sector companies. Furthermore, the industry structure of the \nrestructured power sector of Assam insulates a transmission company from bulk power purchase \nand supply functions so it can focus on the wheeling of power and system operations as the \nbackbone of the industry. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n19.  A comprehensive program for restructuring the power sector has been launched by GOA \nand will be continued through ADB TA grants. The SDP seeks to ensure that electricity will be \nsupplied in adequate quantities, in an efficient manner, and at reasonable cost to all consumers in \nthe state of Assam. \n  \n20.  The SDP comprises a policy loan and an investment loan, along with three TAs to support \nits implementation. The policy component (the Program) and the TAs will assist GOA and ASEB \nto (i) develop a policy and regulatory framework for the organized growth of the power sector; \n(ii) enhance  sector  efficiencies  by  establishing  a  commercial  and  competitive  business \nenvironment; and (iii) improve the financial viability of the sector. The investment component (the \nProject) will assist ASEB to improve the quantity and quality of the power supply. The program \nframework is in Appendix 4.  \n  \nB.  The Policy Loan \n \n1.  Amount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds \n21.  The Government has requested a policy loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the policy component of the SDP. The loan will have a 15-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; a front-end fee of \n0.5%; conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the draft Loan \nAgreement,  Loan  Regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Conversion  Guidelines;  and  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government will pay front-end fee and \ncommitment charge on the loan. The Government has provided ADB with (i) reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The counterpart \nfunds to be generated from the loan proceeds will be transferred from the Government to GOA \nunder normal arrangements for the transfer of external  assistance. The funds transferred to \nGOA will be treated as \u201cadditional\u201d to the Government\u2019s transfers allocated annually to GOA. \nThe Government will bear the foreign exchange risk in accordance with its policy.  \n ", "6  \n \n22.  The policy loan is proposed to support reforms and restructuring in the power sector. \nUnder arrangements satisfactory to ADB, GOA will use the counterpart funds to be generated \nfrom the loan proceeds to support the financial restructuring of ASEB and adjustment costs \nassociated with the Program, including (i) retirement of defaulted bonds and loans, (ii) payment of \ndues owed under the FRP of ASEB, and (iii) funding of cash shortfall of the sector (paras. 31 and \n32). \n \n2.  Objectives and Components \n23.  The objectives of the policy loan are to support reforms and restructuring of the state\u2019s \npower sector and to (i) strengthen the functions and capacity of AERC, (ii) develop appropriate \npolicies for implementation of the sector reform, (iii) restructure ASEB, and (iv) undertake power \ntariff reforms. ADB and GOA conducted rounds of policy dialogues and agreed on (i) the initial \nindustry structure, reform roadmap, and governance structure of the reformed sector; (ii) the FRP \nof ASEB and required GOA support; (iii) the necessity of GOA\u2019s policy on rural electrification and \nother  matters  to  address  the  implication  of  applicable  laws  on  the  state\u2019s  power  sector, \nrestructuring of ASEB and the FRP; (iv) the necessary actions and their time frame for unbundling \nand corporatization of ASEB; and (v) the capacity building of AERC. The policy loan ensures that \nall decisions and actions necessary to implement these agreements will be made by GOA, AERC, \nand ASEB in a timely manner. The Program is scheduled to be completed by December 2004. \n \n3.  Important Features \na.  Reform Model and Industry Structure \n24.  GOA unbundled ASEB into  Assam Power Generation Corporation Limited (APGCL), \nAssam  Electricity  Grid  Corporation  Limited  (AEGCL),  and  three  distribution  companies 9 \n(DISCOMs). These companies were incorporated and registered under the Companies Act, \n1956 in October 2003. All generation assets of ASEB will be transferred to APGCL and each of \nthe generation plants will operate as an independent profit center of APGCL. All T&D assets will \nbe  transferred  to  AEGCL  and  the  three  DISCOMs,  respectively.  In  Assam,  economic \nconsiderations  justify  this  functional  unbundling  by  encouraging  focus  and  accountability. \nTransmission can be a good business given the strategic placement in the northeast corridor. \nThe  creation  of  DISCOMs  will  enable  management  to  address  the  particular  distribution \nproblems in each part of Assam and strengthen customer services.  \n \n25.  AEGCL is envisaged to be a wire company and will not undertake bulk purchase or bulk \nsupply, being the backbone for conveying electricity from APGCL and other generating stations \nto DISCOMs, from one DISCOM to another, and for transmission to other states in India. The \nscheduling, load dispatch, and system operator functions at present undertaken by ASEB will be \nvested in AEGCL. DISCOMs will directly purchase bulk power from APGCL, central sector \ngenerators, or other sources.10 The modalities or sources of bulk supply will be entirely left to \nthe discretion of the DISCOMs, following the regulations established by AERC.  \n \n26.  In the long run, competition will be further extended to the wholesale market by allowing \nothers connected to the transmission system, besides distribution companies, to choose their \n                                                 \n9  Lower Assam Electricity Distribution Company Limited, Central Assam Electricity Distribution Company Limited and \nUpper Assam Electricity Distribution Limited. \n10 During the transitional period, ASEB will continue to serve as bulk purchaser and supplier to ensure continuity of \nsupply under the existing power purchase agreements. ", "  7\nsource of supply. Ultimately, competition will be introduced to the retail market. However, this \nprocess  will  require  fulfillment  of  a  number  of  conditions,  including  reduction  of  cross-\nsubsidization,  reduction  of  a  significant  capacity  surplus,  technological  maturity,  stronger \nregulatory oversight, and capacity building of market participants. A long-term reform roadmap \nis provided in Appendix 5. \n \nb.  Governance Structure of the Reformed Sector \n27.  Regulatory Framework. AERC will need to address many complicated issues during \nthe reform process in order to ensure the organized growth of the electricity industry. Therefore, \nstrengthening AERC is imperative to keep the reform on track. AERC has at present only one \nregulator, and lacks qualified staff. A major impediment to appropriate staffing of AERC is the \nhiring freeze imposed by GOA 2 years ago and that is still in effect. GOA has approved the \nposts and budget of one secretary, one joint director, and two deputy directors for AERC on a \nfull-time basis. These new staff will be appointed through deputation until the recruitment freeze \nis lifted and will be paid from AERC\u2019s own budget. The period of deputation will be 5 years or \nmore to avoid frequent rotation of staff. The positions will be widely advertised in the public \nsector including not only GOA but also state and central public sector agencies. AERC will \ncompetitively select qualified candidates. \n \n28.  Electricity Act 2003. The Electricity Act of the Government came into force on 10 June \n2003 and is applicable to all the states in India except for Jammu and Kashmir. The act provides \nfor a complete legal framework for implementing the power sector reforms in India and its \nstates, including functional unbundling of the state electricity boards, establishment of the state \nregulator, licensing, and antitheft provisions. The act also represents a departure from the \nprevious regime of the power sector by introducing more competition in wholesale as well as \nretail markets. \n \n29.  Governance Structure of the Successor Companies. APGCL, AEGCL, and three \nDISCOMs, established as limited companies under the Companies Act, 1956, will operate on \ncommercial principles.  These companies initially will be the subsidiaries of ASEB that will \nremain wholly owned by GOA. The board of each successor company will consist of a specified \nnumber of directors, of whom not more than one third will be nominated by GOA and the \nbalance  will  be  selected  by  an  independent  selection  committee.11 The chairperson and \nmanaging director and all nonexecutive directors of respective companies will be appointed for \na specified period of time.12  \n \nc.  Financial Restructuring of Assam State Electricity Board \n30.  Financial Position of ASEB. According to provisional figures, ASEB improved its cost \nrecovery from 45% in FY2002 to 55% in FY2003 as a result of the reduction of power purchase \ncosts available from cost-efficient hydropower plants and collection efficiency improvement to \n                                                 \n11 The selection committee (five members) as indicated in the articles of associations of each successor company will \nconsist of only one member from GOA and the rest from outside GOA, namely, the chairperson or member of the \nBureau of Public Sector Enterprises, and the chairperson or managing director of a reputed financial institution, of \na management institute, and of a central government company engaged in or connected with the electricity \nindustry. \n12  During the transitional period of not more than 2 years, in order to ensure proper coordination among the \nsuccessor companies, there will be 2 different posts of the chairperson and the managing director, both of whom \nwill be the executive member of the board of directors. The chairperson of ASEB will be the chairperson of all \ncompanies and play coordination role while the managing director of each company will be responsible for its \noperations. \n ", "8  \n96%. These resulted in a reduction of cash operating deficits by 68% from Rs3.4 billion in \nFY2002 to Rs1.1 billion in FY2003. Subsequently, AERC issued its first tariff award, permitting \nan average hike of 13.5% after fuel price adjustment, effective 1 April 2003. However, the \nrevised average tariff of Rs4.05 per kWh is still below its cost of supply of Rs6.56 per kWh, \nwhich is the highest in India. While this gap was supposed to be filled by subsidies for rural \nelectrification and subventions, GOA has provided only loans, which have never been repaid by \nASEB. The subsidies and subventions that have not been made, and the loans that have not \nbeen repaid, have burdened GOA and ASEB as unsettled cross-liabilities. ASEB has also \ndefaulted in the past on power and fuel purchase payments to CPSUs13 and neighboring state \nelectricity boards and on debt service to certain financial institutions. Despite a gradually \nimproving financial performance, therefore, ASEB still has a negative net worth of Rs49.8 billion.  \n \n31.  Financial  Restructuring  Plan.  To  discontinue  the  vicious  circle  of  cross-liability \nbetween ASEB and GOA and to improve the financial viability of the power sector, an FRP has \nbeen developed by ASEB and was approved by GOA in October 2003. Under the FRP, the \nbalance sheet of ASEB will be restructured in such a manner that its successor companies will \nbe financially viable. This is also required to avoid the costs of ASEB\u2019s unrecoverable assets \nand unserviceable liabilities being passed on to consumers through tariff hikes. Accordingly, the \nFRP includes: (i) a clean-up of ASEB\u2019s balance sheet through a write-off of nonperforming \nassets; (ii) an offsetting of unpaid subsidies and subventions against GOA loans; (iii) settlement \nof receivables from municipal bodies and dues owed to neighboring states; (iv) securitization of \ndues owed to CPSUs as of 30 September 2001; (v) settlement of dues owed to CPSUs after 30 \nSeptember 2001; (vi) the transfer of defaulted bonds and loans to GOA. Following the approval \nof the FRP by GOA; and (vii) transitional cash deficit support. GOA and ASEB signed a \nmemorandum of understanding (MOU) to accomplish the settlement of the above (ii) and (iii) \n(Appendix 6). The major components of the FRP will be implemented before transfer of assets \nand liabilities of ASEB to its successor companies anticipated in March 2004. The costs of the \nFRP by category and year are given in Appendix 7. \n \n32.  Transitional  Cash  Shortfall  Funding.  After  the  implementation  of  the  major \ncomponents of FRP, part of the outstanding liabilities (the undefaulted portion of bonds and \nloans) will still remain in ASEB. A long-term financial projection of ASEB and its successor \ncompanies (Appendix 7) indicates that the sector, even after the cross-settlements with GOA, \nwould not be able to generate cash revenue to fully meet operating expenses and debt service \nobligations before FY2007. Until then, the sector is expected to produce a cash shortfall of \nRs2.71 billion. To bridge this shortfall, GOA has committed to provide financial support to ASEB \nand its successor companies. GOA has also committed to provide adequate guarantees to \nfacilitate them to raise the necessary funds for working capital and investment requirements \nduring the transitional period. GOA\u2019s financial and budgetary support for the implementation of \nthe FRP and to meet the transitional cash shortfall is a major part of the adjustment costs of the \nreform.  \n \nd.  Social Issues  \n33.  The Program will assist GOA to implement the power sector reforms, and should have a \npositive impact on economic growth. To assess this impact and provide mitigation measures for \nany possible negative impact, a poverty impact assessment was conducted in May\u2013June 2003 \n                                                 \n13 ASEB has been current on payments to CPSUs since July 2002. \n ", "  9\nthrough a survey in about 500 households and stakeholder consultations. A poverty impact \nassessment prepared for the Program is attached in Supplementary Appendix C. \n   \n34.  Human Resources Development Strategy. ASEB has developed a human resources \ndevelopment strategy (HRDS) with the following objectives: (i) anticipate the implications of \norganizational restructuring and mitigate any possible negative impact on employees; (ii) avoid \nany labor retrenchment; (iii) improve performance and better the terms of employment and \nconditions of service; and (iv) ensure that the process of restructuring is participative, through \ndialogue  and  consultations  with  employees  and  other  stakeholders  (such  as  unions  and \nassociations) as well as ASEB and its successor companies. Based on consultations with trade \nunions and associations, GOA and ASEB management confirmed that there would not be any \nretrenchment. The HRDS consists of (i) a personnel transfer policy on an as-is-where-is basis, \n(ii) retraining and redeployment, (iii) workforce adjustment through normal attrition and disability \npension, and (iv) a voluntary retirement scheme for eligible employees. A summary HRDS is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n35.  Treatment of Terminal Benefits. So far, ASEB has been meeting the liabilities for \nterminal  benefits  (including  pension,  gratuity,  encashment  of  unutilized  leave,  and  other \nretirement benefits) of its employees from revenues, and not on the basis of any funded trust or \nscheme. As a result, a significant part of the terminal benefit liabilities are unfunded. An \nactuarial valuation is necessary to determine the amount required for making all these liabilities \nfully funded. After unbundling and transferring the functions, the successor companies of ASEB \nwill (i) establish appropriate trusts or funds for various terminal benefits, (ii) contribute to the \nfunds for future service in accordance with the requirements of applicable law, and (iii) make \ngood the shortage in the fund related to the past and progressively make the liability fully \nfunded. GOA has committed to provide full funding to meet the ongoing payments to the \nexisting pensioners and those who will retire until FY 2008-09, till such payments can be fully \nmade by ASEB and its successor companies. ASEB will develop and submit through GOA an \nimplementation plan for the transfer of terminal benefit-related liabilities within 6 months of loan \neffectiveness.  \n \n36.  Stakeholder Participation. Given the different perceptions and high degree of public \nskepticism about the inefficiency of ASEB and the purpose of the power sector reforms, GOA and \nASEB noted the need for  developing public relations strategies to inform the general public \nabout the need and purpose of the reforms and to refine internal communications procedures to \nenhance employees\u2019 understanding and support for the organizational changes as a result of \nthe reforms. The consulting services under the investment loan will support GOA and ASEB in \npreparing a public relations strategy to (i) identify and address consumers\u2019 major concerns \nrelated to the existing electricity services and proposed reforms and (ii) widely disseminate to \nconsumers information on the proposed reforms, particularly on tariffs, and by tariff category. To \nstrengthen  employees\u2019  acceptance  and  support  of  the  reforms,  particularly  organizational \nchanges, ASEB will formally establish a consultative framework involving employees and their \nrepresentatives, for implementation of the HRDS and new service rules and conditions. \n \n4.  Financing Plan and Counterpart Funds \n  \n37.  The  adjustment  costs  for  the  power  sector  reforms  will  include  cost  of  (i) the \nimplementation  of  FRP  and  (ii) funding  cash  shortfalls  of  ASEB  and  the  new  successor \ncompanies. The detailed breakdown of the estimated adjustment costs is given in Table 1. \n \n ", "10  \nTable 1: Financial Implications of Costs of Adjustment \n($ million) \nCosts of Adjustments  2003/04 2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 Total\nTakeover of Debt Servicesa  37.0 45.3 4.3 4.3 90.9\nDues of Power and Fuel Purchase from CPSUsb  50.6 20.0 20.0 20.0 110.6\nDues of Power Purchases from Others  0.0 16.0 16.0 16.0 47.9\nDues of Municipal Bodies  0.0 2.3 2.3 2.1 6.8\nCash Shortfall of ASEB  45.3 1.9 10.4 0.0 57.7\nTotal 133.0 85.5 53.0 42.3 313.8\n           \nSource of Funds  03/04 04/05 05/06 06/07 Total\nGOA  43.0 25.5 53.0 42.3 163.8\nADB  90.0 60.0 0.0 0.0 150.0\nTotal 133.0 85.5 53.0 42.3 313.8\na Including GOA guaranteed REC loans, defaulted LIC loans and bonds. \nb Including $90.2 million until 2006/07 for the securitization of past CPSU dues, which was agreed by GOA, the \nGovernment, and the Reserve Bank of India.  \nASEB= Assam State Electricity Board, CPSU= central public sector undertaking, GOA= government of Assam \nLIC= Life Insurance Corporation of India, REC= Rural Electrification Corporation \nSource: ADB staff estimates, ASEB, GOA. \n  \n38.  GOA\u2019s budgetary supports to the power sector are constrained as per the Memorandum \nof  Understanding  on  the  Medium-Term Fiscal Reform Programme between GOA and the \nGovernment  (2001/02  to  2004/05).  Therefore,  GOA  requested  an  ADB  policy  loan  of \n$150.0 million to be provided in two tranches to support the adjustment costs from FY2004 to \nFY2005 while committing to arrange the balance of the adjustment costs.  \n \n  5.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n    a.  Program Management and Period of Implementation \n \n39.  The executing agencies (EAs) for the Program will be the Finance Department and \nPower Department of GOA. GOA has established a steering committee for power sector reform \nchaired by the chief secretary. The committee will be the apex body to maintain strategic and \nprogram overview through the reform process to ensure effective use of resources and to \nestablish priorities. \n \n40.  In addition, GOA has established a strategic policy unit (SPU) under the reform steering \ncommittee. The SPU will be responsible for daily implementation of the Program under the \nguidance of the reform steering committee and for defining the critical path for reform and for \npreparing a time-bound implementation plan and review mechanisms, keeping in mind the \ninstitutional, financial, and regulatory imperatives. SPU will coordinate with ADB and various \nstakeholders in the sector and solicit feedback from power sector experts from within and \noutside  Assam  and  representatives  of  consumer  groups  on  a  regular  basis  for  adequate \nconsideration in the reform program. \n \nb.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n41.  In accordance with provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the policy loan will be disbursed to \nthe Government of India as the Borrower. The proceeds of the policy loan will be utilized to ", " 11\nfinance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of imports produced in \nand procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  8)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement will be through normal commercial practices in the case of procurement by the \nprivate sector, or prescribed procedures acceptable to ADB in the case of procurement by the \npublic sector, having due regard for the principles of economy and efficiency. The Government \nwill certify that (i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible imports is equal to or exceeds the amounts \nof ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the policy loan in a given period; and (ii) the policy loan \nproceeds will be accurately utilized, in a manner satisfactory to ADB. The policy loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed on the basis of the certification provided by the Government, which confirms \nthat the above requirements for the policy loan have been met. ADB will have the right to audit \nthe use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n    c.  Counterpart Funds \n \n42.  Counterpart funds generated under the policy loan will be transferred by the Government \nto GOA and be used by GOA to finance adjustment costs associated with the Program, \nsatisfactory to ADB for this purpose and GOA will, in particular, provide necessary budget \nappropriations in support of the Program. The counterpart funds will support GOA in its power \nsector reforms and the financial restructuring of ASEB and adjustment costs associated with the \nProgram, including (i) retirement of defaulted bonds and loans, (ii) payment of dues owed under \nthe FRP, and (iii) funding of cash shortfall of the sector. \n \nd.  Tranching \n \n43.  The policy loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $90 million is \nexpected in December 2003 and the second tranche of $60 million is expected in December \n2004, subject to the fulfillment of the conditions for each tranche as shown in the policy matrix \n(Appendix 1) and satisfactory compliance of loan covenants.  \n \n44.  First Tranche\u2014$90 million. Release of the first tranche of $90 million is dependent on \nfulfillment of the following actions:  \n \n(i)  GOA to sanction the adequate posts and budget for at least one secretary, one \njoint director, and two deputy directors for AERC on a full-time basis to fully \nfunctionalize AERC; \n \n(ii)  GOA to develop and approve initial industry structure, reform roadmap, the FRP, \nand governance structure of APGCL, AEGCL, and DISCOMs; \n \n(iii)  GOA to establish a power sector reform steering committee and the strategic \npolicy unit; \n \n(iv)  GOA  to  take  a  decision  on  distribution  reconfiguration  (with  at  least  three \nDISCOMs);  \n \n(v)  GOA to incorporate and register APGCL, AEGCL, and at least three DISCOMs \nas per decision on distribution reconfiguration under the Companies Act, 1956; \n \n(vi)  GOA to commit to provide financial and budgetary support to fill cash deficit of \nASEB and its successor companies,  with effect from 1 April 2002,  during the \n ", "12  \ntransitional period until the operating expenses and servicing obligations of the \nliabilities  passed  on  to  the  successor  companies  are  fully  met  by  such \ncompanies; \n \n(vii)  Under the FRP, (a) GOA and ASEB to complete settlement of cross-liabilities \nbetween GOA and ASEB up to 31 March 2003, and (b) GOA to issue Assam \nSpecial Bonds to securitize past dues as of 30 September 2001, of at least three \nCPSUs, in accordance with the tripartite agreement between the Government, \nGOA, and the Reserve Bank of India dated March 2003; and \n \n(viii)  ASEB to file a second tariff proposal with AERC, develop and approve the \nHRDS, and develop a comprehensive metering plan. \n \n45.  Second  Tranche\u2014$60 million.  Release  of  the  second  tranche  of  $60 million  is \ndependent on fulfillment of the following actions:  \n \n(i)  GOA to cause AERC to issue rules and standards for independent tariff setting, \nincluding multiyear tariff principles and licensing; \n \n(ii)  GOA to develop and approve (a) a state rural electrification policy, including \namong others an institutional mechanism for improvement of revenue collection \nefficiencies, and connectivity of poor consumers as identified under the policy; \nand (b) a state policy to address the implications of applicable laws on the state \npower sector, restructuring of ASEB and the FRP; \n \n(iii)  GOA to finalize and approve transfer scheme(s) for transfer of assets, liabilities, \nand  personnel  from  ASEB  to  APGCL,  AEGCL,  and  DISCOMs  as  mutually \nagreed between ADB and GOA and to transfer the assets and liabilities of ASEB \nto APGCL, AEGCL, and DISCOMs; \n \n(iv)  GOA to appoint the managing directors, and part-time directors, of APGCL, \nAEGCL, and DISCOMs as selected by the independent selection committee; \n \n(v)  GOA to complete the transfer of personnel from ASEB to APGCL, AEGCL, and \nDISCOMs in accordance with the transfer scheme(s);  \n \n(vi)  a power purchase agreement between APGCL and ASEB, and bulk supply \nagreements between ASEB and DISCOMs, to be filed by concerned parties with \nAERC for its approval; \n \n(vii)  AEGCL and all DISCOMs to file requests for license terms and conditions with \nAERC; \n \n(viii)  GOA and ASEB to complete implementation of the  FRP including (a) through \nprovision of budget appropriations of all dues payable for up to FY2004/05, and \n(b) all dues paid for up to FY2004/05, in accordance with the FRP; \n \n(ix)  GOA  to  settle  all  CPSU  dues  as  of  31  March  2003,  including  through \nsecuritization; \n ", " 13\n(x)  GOA to approve ASEB\u2019s implementation plan for transfer of terminal benefit \nrelated-liabilities of its employees to ASEB\u2019s successor companies; \n \n(xi)  AEGCL to file with AERC the transmission service agreements (with wheeling \ncharges for the period until the determination of tariffs by AERC) for use of the \ntransmission lines; \n \n(xii)  AEGCL  and  DISCOMs  to  file  respective  revenue  requirements  and  tariff \nproposals with AERC; and \n \n(xiii)  ASEB to complete metering in accordance with the metering plan. \n \n   d.  Program Performance Monitoring, Review, and Evaluation \n \n46.  The reform steering committee will submit through GOA to ADB quarterly progress \nreports,  which  describe  (i) progress  of  the  Program  during  the  period;  (ii) implementation \nschedule; (iii) problems encountered; (iv) remedial actions taken; and (v) work to be undertaken \nin the following period. On the basis of the quarterly reports, ADB will review the implementation \nand operations of the Program in accordance with ADB\u2019s Performance Management System \nHandbook, 2001, as amended from time to time, and will conduct quarterly review missions to \ndiscuss the progress of the Program with GOA officials and related agencies/companies. The \nreform steering committee and the SPU will also submit a program completion report to ADB \nwithin 3 months of the physical completion of the Program. \n \nC.  The Investment Loan \n \n47.  The Government has requested an investment loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the investment component of the SDP. The loan will have a \n20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; a front-\nend fee of 0.5%; conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the \ndraft Loan Agreement, Loan Regulations, and ADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines; and other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government will pay the front-end fee \nand the commitment charge on the loan. The Government has provided ADB with (i) reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n48.  The loan proceeds will be transferred by the Government to GOA under its normal \narrangements of transfer to GOA, which is 90% grant and 10% loan. GOA will in turn make \navailable the loan proceeds to ASEB as follows: (i) provide on a grant basis the 90% grant \nportion of the loan amount; (ii) relend 50% of the balance amount of loan proceeds (5% of the \nloan amount) at an interest rate of 10.5% with a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears; and (iii) relend 50% of the balance amount of loan proceeds (5% of the loan amount) at \nan interest rate of 10.5% with a term of 20 years. The Government will bear the foreign \nexchange risk on the loan in accordance with its policy. \n \n1.  Objectives \n \n49.  ASEB\u2019s high T&D losses are due to a lack of T&D system investment and maintenance. \nInaccurate and insufficient metering contributes to commercial losses. The billing and collection \n ", "14  \nsystem is entirely manual and this, combined with the effect of inaccurate metering, makes it \ndifficult to bill accurately and collect promptly. Rural electrification is also a major area for \ninvestment, given the low coverage in rural areas. In view of these, the Project is designed to \n(i) improve system capacity and efficiencies by improvement of the T&D system, (ii) increase \nrevenues  by  introducing  a  revenue  management  system,  and  (iii) increase  the  reach  of \nelectricity in rural areas. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n  \n50.  The Project components are as follows: Part A: Improvement of Transmission System; \nPart B: Improvement of Distribution System; Part C: Intensification of Rural Electrification; Part \nD: Revenue Management System; and Part E: Consulting Services. An outline description of \nthe components is given in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Important Features \n \n    a.  Rural Electrification Program \n \n51.  Based on the national 5-year rural electrification plan, ASEB plans to electrify all villages \nby 2007, and all households by 2012. The majority of Assam is rural; while 70% of all urban \nhouseholds are electrified, less than 20% of all rural households are electrified. The impediment \nto rural electrification is not simply access to the grid. Although 19,019 of the 24,685 populated \nvillages in Assam are electrified at least by a single-point supply, penetration ratios in those \nvillages are very low. This is partly because the grid is incapable of providing reliable electricity \nto the rural population and, thus, rural areas are actually being  \u201cde-electrified\u201d. ASEB\u2019s 10th \nFive-Year  Plan  (2002\u20132007)  therefore  includes  intensifying  electrification  in  the  19,019 \nconnected villages to reach at least 50% household connectivity in addition to connecting 2,411 \nof the 5,666 \u201cvirgin\u201d villages to the grid by 2007. ASEB is repairing 37 substations, but another \n25 are in need of repair. Under the Project, 1,200 distribution transformers will be replaced by \ntransformers  with  meters,  25  substations  will  be  upgraded,  and  a  system  study  for  rural \nelectrification will be performed for optimum grid expansion planning in rural areas.  \n  \n52.  Connection charges represent another impediment to rural electrification through grid \nextension. Despite their low income levels, unconnected households in rural areas pay more for \nenergy such as kerosene than households that are electrified. An ADB survey (Supplementary \nAppendix C) has shown that at least 50% of all unconnected households, in both connected and \nunconnected villages, would immediately take electricity if it were offered and if they could afford \nthe connection charges, which are estimated at about Rs3,000 per line, or more if connection \nrequires erecting additional poles. This implies that subsidies should be directed at connection \ncharges, rather than tariffs, in order to extend connections. This issue will be addressed by GOA \nin its new rural electrification policy.  \n \n53.  Another important factor for sustainable rural electrification is capacity building of the \nstakeholders. There needs be an effective organization at the village level to act as the bulk \npurchaser and to provide the billing and collection functions. This organization, under the \noversight of a state-level umbrella organization to coordinate practices and standards, would be \nresponsible for managing the local problems of connection, maintenance, theft, and collection. \nRecognizing that a rural electrification model has been very successful in Bangladesh, a TA \nunder  ADB\u2019s  subregional  economic  cooperation  program14 will be provided through which \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC). Manila. ", " 15\nexperts from the Rural Electrification Board of Bangladesh will examine the applicability of the \nrural electrification model of Bangladesh to develop a new institutional mechanism for rural \nelectrification  in  Assam  and  to  identify  areas  for  pilot  projects.  Under  a  TA  in  the  SDP \n(institutional development for rural electrification), this assistance will be further extended to \nconduct detailed feasibility studies of the identified pilot projects.  \n \nb.   Loss Reduction Program  \n \n54.  During FY2002/03, out of 3,299 GWh sourced from ASEB\u2019s own generation and central \ngenerating utilities, ASEB could supply consumers with only 1,960 GWh, due to very high T&D \nlosses of 41%. These losses are one of the major reasons for ASEB\u2019s financial distress. ASEB \nhas, therefore, drawn up a comprehensive loss reduction plan to be completed by FY2007/08. \nAs per the plan, the T&D losses are expected to be reduced from the existing 41% to 25% by \nFY2007/08. \n  \n55.  To reduce transmission system losses\u2014primarily due to overloading and inadequate \nredundancy\u2014and to meet growing demand, ASEB\u2019s transmission system will be augmented \nand reinforced by the investment loan. The distribution losses (technical and commercial) will be \nreduced by a combination of system strengthening, computerization of billing and collection, and \n100% metering15 in all the existing distribution circles to be funded by the investment loan and \nthe APDRP.  \n \nc.  Poverty and Social Dimensions \n \n56.  The Project will directly and indirectly contribute to economic growth and will reduce \npoverty, by lowering household energy costs and by removing energy constraints to enterprises \nthat offer employment opportunities for the poor. There is an association between electrification, \nhigher income levels, improved health status, and educational achievements. Direct benefits will \nextend to all categories of consumers, poor and nonpoor, in improvements to the existing quality \nof supply. As 26% of households in Assam are already connected, mostly in urban areas, most \nof these new beneficiaries will be among the rural poor. The rural electrification (RE) component \nof the Project will reconnect approximately 1,200 villages with a potential to provide connection \nto approximately 78,000 households in which about 40% live below the poverty line. In addition, \nthere will be approximately 3,500 commercial and 1,800 industrial and other consumers. Direct \nbenefits to households include better quality lighting for the same outlay as they currently incur \non kerosene, improved air quality in the home, and possible substitution of at least some of the \nprevalent fuelwood used for cooking. Of indirect general benefit will be improved public facilities \nsuch as street lighting, and social infrastructure such as hospitals and schools. Gender impacts \nof electrification are particularly favorable; women want electricity and have clear perceptions of \nits power to reduce drudgery, to ease working hours, to increase access to the media, and to \nenhance  the  general  amenity  in  their  lives.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \ndevelopment strategy is attached as Appendix 10. \n \nd.  Resettlement \n \n57.  A  social  assessment  and  a  20%  sample  survey  of  households  on  the  proposed \ntransmission  component  of  the  Project  were  carried  out  in  May\u2013June  2003.  The  project \ncomponent comprises 549 km of seven transmission lines with 13 substations. According to the \nsocial assessment, substations require a total of 70 hectares (ha) of land. For five substations, \n                                                 \n15 See para. 5 of Appendix 9 for detailed metering plan. \n ", "16  \nland has been acquired in the past 10 to 25 years.16 This land has been enclosed and is free \nfrom squatters or encroachments. A further 19.5 ha of land remains to be acquired for four \nsubstations. Construction of transmission lines requires minimal land acquisition. Total land \nrequirements  for  footings  are  10.5  hectares.  About  1,870  persons  will  be  affected  in \ntransmission lines due to the loss of land for power footings and trees/plants. Approximately 70 \npersons will be affected by minor acquisition of private land for the remaining substations; most \nwill be government land. Based on the social assessment, the RE scheme will have insignificant \nresettlement impact except for cutting trees within the existing right-of-way. ASEB will select RE \nsubprojects that, other things being equal, avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement. \nA summary of the resettlement plan for the transmission and the RE components of the Project \nis attached as Appendix 11. Since the impact of land acquisition will be minimal, it is envisaged \nthat an indigenous people development plan is not required. However, an additional 5% of \ncompensation  for  any  land  or  loss  of  trees  will  be  given  to  vulnerable groups, including \nscheduled tribes and households below the poverty line. \n \n58.  To enhance the abilities of ASEB to address, collect, analyze, and monitor social \nbenefits, environment, land acquisition, and poverty impact of the Project, ASEB will establish a \nfully  functional  social  and  environmental  management  cell  and  place  it  under  its  own \nresponsibility. Consulting services for capacity building of the cell will be provided under the \ninvestment loan. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, a supervisory \nconsultant  under  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the \nimplementation of the resettlement plan (RP). Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, locally-\nbased  nongovernment  organizations 17 or  representatives  of  the  local  community  will  be \nrecruited to conduct monitoring and verification of implementation of the RP.  \n \ne.  Environment \n \n59.  The  proposed  project  is  category  \u201cB\u201d  in  ADB\u2019s  classification  system.  The  initial \nenvironmental examination reports were prepared for the T&D lines. The initial environmental \nexamination shows that the adverse environmental impacts associated with the establishment \nof T&D lines would be minor and mainly caused by construction activities (e.g., clearing of \nvegetation and disturbance of traffic). The mitigation measures will be incorporated into the \ncontractor\u2019s  contract  document.  The  adverse  environmental  impact  associated  with \nrehabilitation and establishment of the substations will be mostly due to operation activities \n(e.g., leakage and spillage oil and other lubricants, improper disposing of oil wastes). The \nmitigation measures to minimize these impacts are available. Therefore, it is concluded that an \nenvironmental impact assessment to further examine impacts associated with the investment \nproject  is  not  required.  However,  routine  monitoring  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  pollution \ngenerated by the substation is required. The social and environmental management cell within \nASEB will help promote environmentally responsible activities within ASEB and its successor \ncompanies, and will monitor the implementation of mitigation measures. \n \n60.  The  Government  is  still  allowing  polychlorinated  biphenyl (PCB) to be used in the \ncountry. Therefore, it is very likely that transformers containing PCB are still used, produced, \nand sold, although there is no systematic data or monitoring on such transformers. The Project \nwill require ASEB to install only PCB-free transformers. However, due to the Assam Preferential \n                                                 \n16 Land audit was conducted during PPTA stage. It has been verified that land was not acquired for this project, \ntherefore a retrofitted resettlement plan was not required to address the compensation and income restoration \nissue (see footnote 2, OM Section OP/F2 on Involuntary Resettlement). \n17 The NGO may be a domestic consultant with appropriate expertise and experience in resettlement implementation.  ", " 17\nStores Purchase Act (APSPA), ASEB is required to purchase distribution transformers only from \nlocal suppliers, which may not be able to supply PCB-free transformers. In this context, for all \ntransformers purchased under APSPA, ASEB will ensure that (a) no liquid leakage or spillage \noccurs from the transformers; (b) every time maintenance work for transformers is undertaken, \nthe waste oil contents of PCB will be stored in safe drums to avoid any leakage and such waste \nwill be handled in accordance with the Ministry of  Forest and  Environment Notification on \nHazardous Waste Management, 1989, as amended from time to time; and (c) the used oil will \nbe sold only to parties authorized for recycling oil wastes or recycling hazardous wastes. The \nGovernment is now organizing consultations on persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Therefore, \nit is expected that the use of PCB in India will be banned very soon as the Government is also \nparty to the Convention on POPs. In this context, ASEB has to monitor national developments \non managing POPs, particularly for PCB. As soon as the Government bans PCB, ASEB will \nhave to deal with PCB transformers in accordance with government requirements. \n \n4.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n61.  The summary cost estimates of the Project are in Table 2 (details are in Appendix 12). \n \nTable 2: Cost Estimates  \n ($ million)  \nProject Components  Foreign   Local  Total  \n   Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

The proposed financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 3. The foreign \nexchange cost of $98.2 million and the local currency cost of $1.8 million will be covered by an \nADB loan, accounting for about 41% of the total project cost of $243.5 million. The Government \nwill  cover  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $7.6 million  for  the  front-end fee, interest during \nconstruction,  and  commitment  charge  on  the  loan.  The  Government  will  also  cover  local \ncurrency of about $109 million, and GOA and ASEB will fund local currency cost of $27 million. \nASEB and its successor companies will, however, continue to be cash-starved for some time, \nand their balance sheets will not be strong enough to raise the counterpart funds for the Project \nfrom the market in a timely manner. Consequently, as the owner of ASEB and its successor \n ", "18  \ncompanies, GOA will need to promptly make the necessary funds available to them to ensure \ntimely project implementation. Such funds, however, will not form part of the counterpart funds \ngenerated out of the proceeds of the policy loan and will be provided in addition to the proceeds of \nthe investment loan. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan for the Project \n($ million) \nForeign  Local \nSource  Total Cost  % \nExchange  Currency \nADB  98.2  1.8  100.0  41.1 \nGovernment  7.6  108.9  116.5  47.8 \nGOA and ASEB  0.0  27.0  27.0  11.1 \nTotal  107.6  135.9  243.5  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GOA = government of Assam, ASEB = Assam State \nElectricity Boad. \nNote: The Government\u2019s foreign exchange contribution is for the front-end fee, interest during \nconstruction, and commitment charge. \nSource: ADB staff estimates, ASEB. \n \n5.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n    a.  Project Management \n \n63.  ASEB, or its successor companies (AEGCL and DISCOMs) and the Power Department of \nGOA, will implement the Project. AEGCL and DISCOMs were established in October 2003 and \nare expected to start functioning by mid-2004. While ASEB will be responsible for executing the \nProject, it is intended to transfer such responsibility along with personnel to the successor \ncompanies when feasible with prior approval of ADB. GOA (through its Power Department), as \njoint executing agency, will ensure adequate funding, facilities, and all resources, in addition to the \nproceeds of the loan, as required for timely implementation of the Project. \n \n64.  Day-to-day project implementation will be undertaken/supervised by a PMU, to be set up \nfor the Project. The PMU will be established in ASEB as a holding company, headed by a senior \nASEB officer and will consist of a sufficient number of engineers on full-time assignment. Apart \nfrom exceptional organizational requirements, the staff assigned to PMU will be retained in the \nPMU for the entire duration of project implementation. After unbundling, the PMU will continue in \nASEB as a holding company. The PMU will be the focal point for ADB on all project components \nand will be responsible for coordinating all aspects related to the Project.  \n \nb.  Period of Implementation \n   \n65.  Implementation of the Project will commence in March 2004 and be completed in \nDecember 2006 (see Appendix 13). \n \nc.  Procurement and Consulting Services \n  \n66.  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. For such procurement, bidding documents will be prepared in a manner to \nensure  maximum  competition  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Each  supply \ncontract, estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more, will be awarded on the basis of \nICB. Each supply contract estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $500,000 can be \nawarded on the basis of international shopping. ADB funds will not be used to finance any local ", " 19\ncosts. Turnkey contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of more than $1 million will be adopted \nusing two stage-two envelope bidding procedures, for some packages of transmission system \nimprovement, RE, and the revenue management system, and will be procured through ICB. A \nlist of the major contract packages under the Project with their cost estimates is in Appendix 14. \nThe Project does not include retroactive financing. \n \n67.  Under APSPA, the main goods of the power system, including conductors, cables, \ndistribution  transformers  and  prestressed  concrete  poles  are  to  be  procured  from  local \nsuppliers. Therefore, goods procured by ASEB under the APSPA requirements will be from its \nown funds and supplied to the turnkey contractors. All responsibility regarding the time schedule \nof supplying these goods and the quality of the supplied goods will be with ASEB and its \nsuccessor companies. \n \n68.  The  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  system  has  recently  been \ninstalled in the state load dispatch center and limited numbers of 132 kV substations. Under the \nProject, improvement and expansion of this system to all 132kV substations will be included. \nThis component will be separated into two packages: (i) the state load dispatch center and \nexisting  remote  terminal  units,  and  (ii) new  remote  terminal  units.  With  the  aim  of  cost-\neffectiveness and maintaining standardization, goods for package (i), estimated cost $600,000, \nwill need to be procured from the original supplier. Therefore, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement, a single tender procedure for package (i) will be adopted to award \nthe contract to incumbent supplier. \n \n69.  To ensure timely implementation of the SDP, three international consulting firms will be \nengaged, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, for (i) project implementation \nsupport (34 person-months of international consulting services and 128 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services); (ii) systems study (14 person-months of international consulting \nservices  and  56  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services);  and  (iii) program \nimplementation support (30 person-months of international consulting services and 56 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services). An outline of the terms of reference for consulting \nservices is given in Supplementary Appendix E. Cost estimates for each component are given in \nSupplementary  Appendix  F.  For  selection  of  consulting  firms,  the  quality  and  cost-based \nselection method on full technical proposal (in case of (i) and (iii)) and simplified technical \nproposal basis (in case of (ii)), as applicable, will be used. \n \nd.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n70.  Since the disbursements under the Project will be mainly for the supply of goods and \ninternational consulting services, ADB\u2019s commitment letter and direct payment procedures will \nbe  used  for  the  purpose  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook, \nJanuary 2001,  and  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-based  Loan \nProjects, July 2002, both as amended from time to time. \n \ne.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n71.  Following the loan approval, the PMU will prepare progress reports for the respective \ncomponents of the Project every 3 months and submit them to ADB within 1 month of the end of \neach quarter. The reports will contain a narrative description of progress made during the \nperiod, changes to the implementation schedule if any, problems or difficulties encountered and \nthe remedial actions taken, the performance of the project implementation consultants where \napplicable, and the work to be carried out in the upcoming period. The reports will also include a \n ", "20  \nsummary financial account for the Project, consisting of project expenditure to date. A project \ncompletion report will be submitted to ADB within 3 months of completion of the Project. \nUnaudited statements will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the close of the financial \nyear. ASEB will also submit to ADB audited Project accounts and the auditors\u2019 observations with \nrespect to use of loan proceeds and compliance with loan covenants within 9 months of the \nclosing of each financial year. \n \nf.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n72.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, ASEB will be responsible for direct supervision of \nimplementation and monitoring the operational performance of the components. The PMU will \nprepare progress reports for the respective project components and submit them to GOA and \nADB on a quarterly basis within 1 month of the end of each quarter. ADB will review the \nimplementation and operation of the Project on the basis of these reports and meet with PMU \nstaff, ASEB management, and GOA to discuss progress of the Project and any remedial \nmeasures to be taken for timely implementation of the Project and for achieving its objectives. \n \nD.  Assam  Power  Sector  Development  Program  Performance  Monitoring  and \nEvaluation \n \n73.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, ASEB will set up a benefit monitoring unit within \nthe PMU and reporting to the reform steering committee, to monitor and evaluate the scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and progress of SDP achievement in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProject Performance Management System Handbook, 2001 as amended from time to time. The \nquarterly reporting will include socioeconomic and poverty indicators, reflecting the impacts of \nthe policy and the project components on end-consumers, particularly those living below the \npoverty line. Using consulting services, the benefit-monitoring unit will undertake an in-depth \nqualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the reform on end-consumers. Outline \nterms of reference for the consulting services are provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n74.   To support the implementation of the Program, three TAs are included in the SDP. \nThese are (i) reorganization of ASEB, for $1,000,000; (ii) institutional development for rural \nelectrification, for $400,000; and (iii) policy and legal support for power sector reforms, for \n$100,000. These TAs will be financed from DFID\u2019s India Trust Fund, funded by the Government \nof the United Kingdom for $1.5 million, and administered by ADB. The details of the TAs are \ngiven in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n  1.  Program Component \n \n75.  The program component will establish a financially self-sufficient power sector through \nfinancial restructuring of ASEB. The power sector is envisaged to positively contribute to the \neconomic development of Assam through a sufficient quantity of electricity and sustainable tariff \nlevels.  Coupled  with  additional  cash  inflows  from  the  tariff  rationalization,  efficiency \nimprovements from the project investment, and budgetary support from GOA, the Program will \nhelp ensure the financial soundness of the successor companies of ASEB and reduce\u2013\u2013and ", " 21\neventually eliminate\u2014the financial burden of GOA to meet deficits in the power sector. The \ndetailed analysis is provided in Appendix 7. \n \n76.  From  FY1998/99  to  FY2002/03,  GOA  provided  financial  support  of  Rs4,334 million \n($92 million) to ASEB for its operational expenses. GOA projects that 25% of the consolidated \nfiscal deficits of GOA will come from the power sector in FY2003/04. Without the reform, the \nfinancial problems of the power sector would continue to hamper the mobilization of GOA\u2019s \nfiscal resources for other sectors as important as the power sector is for the economic and \nsocial  development  of  the  state.  With  the  program  component  of  the  SDP,  coupled  with \nefficiency improvements driven by the project component of the SDP, the power sector is \nexpected to achieve cash breakeven in FY2006/07, and thereafter no financial support by GOA \nwill be required for the power sector deficit. \n \n2.  Project Component \n \na.  Financial Analysis \n \n77.  The financial analysis of the Project is presented in Appendix 15. Because the impacts \nof the T&D  components are interdependent, they have been combined for the economic and \nfinancial analysis. The revenue management system component has been designed to reduce \ncommercial losses by providing 100% metering, a computerized billing system, and prompt \naccounting of metered data. Both components exhibit a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nthat is above ASEB\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. The beneficiaries of the RE component \nare former consumers in villages that have lost access to electricity because of equipment \nfailures at the village level. The expenditure on this component is primarily for replacement of \ndamaged transformers. The revenues resulting from this investment will flow primarily from rural \ndomestic customers, many of whom are not metered and pay a flat rate charge that yields a \nrelatively low return on energy consumed. As a result, the RE component exhibits a negative \nFIRR.  \n \nb.  Economic Analysis \n \n78.  The economic analysis of the investment program is also presented in  Appendix 15. \nEconomic  analysis  was  performed  for  only  the  transmission and distribution components \ncombined  and  the  RE  component,  as  the  benefits  of  the  revenue  management  system \ncomponent are largely directed at improving the financial performance of the sector. The \neconomic gains from the T&D components are reduced requirements for generation of electrical \nenergy that would otherwise be \u201clost\u201d in the network, and increased economic activity resulting \nfrom consumers\u2019 improved ability to meet their energy needs from grid-based supplies. The \ncosts and benefits are valued in economic terms and show a high economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR). \n \n79.  The high EIRR for the RE component is a function of the relatively low investment \nrequired to reestablish supply in areas where supply facilities already exist and the relatively \nhigh opportunity cost associated with alternative sources of energy supply. The RE component \nis an essential part of ASEB\u2019s rural electrification plan, which is intended to bring electrification \nto all households by 2012. Before new connections can be made, the grid must be strengthened \nand  the  transformers  made  more  reliable.  The  RE  component  will  lead  to  even  greater \neconomic benefits when it is followed by a project that connects rural consumers to the grid.  \n \n ", "22  \nc.  Poverty Reduction Impact \n  \n80.  The social impact of the project components is measured by the poverty impact ratio \n(PIR). The direct project benefits include: (i) economic benefits of the incremental energy \nsupply, computed based on the estimated willingness to pay of domestic consumers, and the \ncost of self-generation for nondomestic consumers; (ii) the economic value of cost savings in \nthe production of nonincremental energy usage; and (iii) the economic value of the cost of \nproducing incremental energy. The approach also takes account of indirect benefits, such as \nstreet lighting and other externalities provided by the RE project, and the benefits of wages to \nlabor, which are only regarded as a cost in a purely financial analysis.  \n \n81.  Since the revenue management system is determined to have only financial, and no \neconomic,  benefits,  the  PIR  was  not  calculated  for  this  component.  The  T&D  and  RE \ncomponents provided benefits that consisted in the incremental energy available to the affected \ncustomers, evaluated at the economic value to each customer class. It was assumed that all \nadditional capacity would be utilized and additional energy would be sold. However, neither of \nthese components entailed the connection of new customers. The T&D and RE components \nalso provided cost savings in producing nonincremental energy, which accrued to ASEB; these \nwere regarded as social benefits that would accrue to the poor and the nonpoor, whether or not \nthey are connected. The economic benefits from increased energy sales resulting from the T&D \ncomponents accrue to urban and rural customers alike, but only to customers who are already \nconnected. The share of these benefits accruing to the poor is estimated by estimating, first, the \nproportion of connected households that are poor. A detailed calculation of the PIR appears in \nAppendix 15.   \n \nB.  Risks and Safeguards  \n \n82.  Political Commitment. The success of the power sector reforms hinges  on GOA\u2019s \nstrong commitment to them. At the initial stage of the reform process, where no significant \nperformance  improvement  has  been  achieved,  a  tariff  hike  is  always  unpopular  with  all \nconsumer groups. While major benefits of the reforms may not immediately be visible, the \nreforms under the Program will ultimately free up state resources for more investments in social \nobjectives and help all consumers gain better access to and services from electricity. Certain \ngroups of stakeholders may resist giving more autonomy to the regulator and utilities in order \nnot to lose their vested interest in the current regime. Therefore, a strong political commitment is \nrequired to implement the reforms and convince stakeholders of the need for the reforms to gain \ntheir support. GOA has made a firm commitment to major policy matters for the successful \nimplementation of the reforms. The central Government\u2019s Electricity Act provides for a complete \nlegal framework to underpin GOA\u2019s commitment. The Program is designed to accelerate the \nreform program and make the most of key policy decisions within the first year. Through a TA \ngrant and consulting services under the SDP, ADB will support GOA and ASEB in making timely \nactions for implementation of the reforms while effectively communicating with a wide range of \nstakeholders.  \n \n83.  Regulatory  Capacity.  A  legal  framework  is  already  in  place  under  the  central \nGovernment\u2019s Electricity Act to give the state regulator a wider mandate and independence. It \nis, however, GOA\u2019s responsibility to ensure that, within the legal framework, the regulations are \ndistanced from policy-making and regulatory actions are made on the basis of a commercial \nprinciple and without political interference. Due to its critical role in sector reforms, there is a risk \nthat AERC could be a bottleneck unless it functions properly. Therefore, for successful reforms, \nGOA needs to undertake full responsibility to make AERC fully operational to fulfill its statutory ", " 23\nfunctions before major regulatory issues emerge. The Program requires GOA to provide AERC \nwith sufficient resources, including professional and supporting staff and an operating budget. \nADB will support the development of detailed rules and standards for independent tariff setting \nand licensing and will provide hands-on operational support for AERC staff under a TA grant.18 \n \n84.  Financial Sustainability. The power sector reforms will require a substantial budgetary \nand financial support from GOA. If efficiency improvements of the sector do not take place as \nexpected, GOA\u2019s burden will increase and may jeopardize state finances. To mitigate this risk, \nADB  has  committed  to  make  long-term  interventions  on  the  broad-based  and  state-wide \nreforms, including support for its public resource management. In addition, the SDP reflects \nADB\u2019s lessons learned from power sector reform programs in other Indian states to help ensure \nfinancial sustainability of the power sector.  \n \n85.  Human Resources. The employees of ASEB\u2019s successor companies will play a critical \nrole for successful sector reform. Unless they change their work culture and hold themselves \naccountable for their performance while being given more autonomy, the sector will be unable to \ndepart  from  the  present  regime  and  satisfy  consumers.  This  change  requires  a  strong \ninstitutional  mechanism  and  leadership  within  each  company  to  ensure  accountability  of \nemployees and motivate them to performer better. Another human resources risk is a lack of \nprofessional staff, a serious problem at ASEB for staff in their 30s and 40s due to a long \nrecruitment freeze. As GOA has a policy not to retrench employees as a result of the reforms, a \ncritical element for the reforms is how efficiently ASEB and its successor companies utilizes the \nexisting  labor  force  through  retraining  and  redeployment.  ADB  will  support  effective \nimplementation of HRDS and capacity building of employees through consulting services under \nthe SDP. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n86.  In addition to the standard assurances, the following specific assurances have been \ngiven by GOA and the Government, which will be incorporated in the legal documents for the \nProgram. \n \n  1.

The  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  SDP,  as  described  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix, will continue to be in effect for at least the duration \nof the SDP. \n \n88.  The Government will transfer the counterpart funds generated under the policy loan, and \nthe  loan  proceeds  under  the  investment  loan,  under  normal  arrangements  for  transfer  of \nexternal assistance to GOA and will treat such counterpart funds as an additionality to transfers \nallocated annually to GOA. \n \n89.  The Government will cause GOA to ensure that sufficient budgetary allocations are \nmade available to ASEB in a timely manner for efficient and timely implementation of the SDP. \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2003.

The aim of the power sector reform program of the government of Assam (GOA) is to \ndeliver greater social benefits from power supply in the state by improving service quality and \ncoverage while ensuring the financial viability and economic efficiency of the sector. As in other \nIndian states, a lack of accountability at all levels of the sector has resulted in the poor service \nquality and unsustainable financial performance that now characterizes Assam State Electricity \nBoard (ASEB) operations. The GOA reform program entails phased structural interventions that \nwill restore and institutionalize accountability throughout the sector. The program entails  the \nmigration  shown  in  Figure  A5.1.  By  first  creating  a  framework  for  accountability  and \ninstitutionalizing it through corporatization and the introduction of competition, the reform aims to \ndeliver  substantive  and  lasting  benefits.  The  emphasis  on  establishing  a  framework  for \naccountability  up  front  rather  than  the  merely  the  institutional  structures  that  facilitate  it \ndistinguishes the Assam reform program from others. \n \nFigure A5.1: The Assam Reform Roadmap \n \n \n \n \n \n4.

Each step in the roadmap is described in further detail below. \n \n3.  Establish Blueprint and Accountability. During this first step, ASEB will establish an \ninternal reform management structure to lead the restructuring through all phases. ASEB will \nbegin  to  reorganize  more  closely  around  the  electricity  value  chain,  i.e.,  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution/supply. Authority will be redefined and key performance indicators \nestablished for each principal organizational unit to empower it to perform the work assigned \nand to measure its performance. Stakeholder consultations and organizational capacity building \nwill begin during this phase. These activities may be undertaken entirely at the discretion of \nASEB, and have already begun in several important areas, e.g., energy accounting. \n \n4.  Develop Financial Processes and Make Transfers. The formation of new corporate \nsubsidiaries requires approval and acceptance by GOA of a financial restructuring plan that will \nallow the new entities to begin operation unencumbered by past liabilities. This triggers the \ncreation of new governance structures, development of new financial processes required for \nunbundling, formulation of new employee performance management systems (reflected in new \nconditions of service for the new companies), establishment of opening balance sheets for the \nnew entities, design of intercompany contracting and pricing, and the actual transfer of assets, \nliabilities, and people. Once the new generation, transmission, and distribution companies have \n ", "46   Appendix 5 \nbeen established, the role of ASEB as bulk purchaser will be devolved to the distribution \ncompanies (DISCOMs), which will be free to contract directly with their generation affiliate or \nany other supplier (e.g., central sector generators) they may choose. The transmission company \nwill function solely as a wires company and system operator, and will not engage in power \ntrading, bulk purchasing, or bulk supply. By providing choice of bulk supply to the DISCOMs, \nAssam will take the first step toward the introduction of competition. \n \n5.  Ensure Financial Independence. The new entities may be separated entirely from the \nholding company as soon as they have demonstrated their financial viability and absorbed full \nlegal,  human  resources,  and  financial  management  capability.  New  financial  processes  for \nfunding and treasury management as well as risk management must be introduced. \n \n6.  The migration of ASEB through these stages is shown in Figure A5.2. \nFigure A5.2: Assam State Electricity Board Organizational Migration \n \nCurrent Structure Profit Center Structure CorporatizedStructure Fully Unbundled Structure\nASEB Residual\nsuBppullkie rs suBppullike rs ASEB Holding suBppullike rs\nASEB Bulk \nG suppliers\nASEB\nCorporate G\nGeneration\nG\nTransmission/SO\nT/SO\nDistribution/Supply T/SO T/SO\nD/S\nPower flows D/S D/S\nCash flows\nASEB Holding may hold bulk purchasing  ASEB Residual to be liquidated as soon \n& supply contracts until transfer to new  as possible \nG, T & D companies, and control \nintercompany cash flows until new tariffs \n& financial processes are in place.\n \nASEB = Assam State Electricity Board, D/S = distribution and supply, G = generation, T&D = transmission and \ndistribution, T/SO = transmission and system operation. \n \n7.  Create Wholesale Market Processes. GOA advocates extending competition as far as \npossible  to  further  institutionalize  accountability  and  to  impose  a  structural  mechanism  to \ncompel improved service quality and financial viability. During this stage, competition would \ndevelop further to  allow others besides the distribution companies to choose their source of \nsupply. At this stage, such competition would be limited to consumers directly connected to the \ntransmission  system,  initially  captive  users  as  noted  above.  This,  however,  requires  the \ndevelopment of dispatch, metering, and settlement systems following regulatory analysis and \ndirectives, in addition to the unbundling and corporatization of ASEB carried out in the previous \nstage. \n \n8.  Create Retail Market Processes. Extending these metering and settlement systems to \nretail consumers requires far more complex systems. Retail competition will also require more \nsophisticated regulatory oversight, stronger consumer protection, and further capacity building \namong  market  participants.  Again,  these  changes  can  only  follow  regulatory  analysis  and \ndirectives. It may take a considerable amount of time to satisfy these prerequisites and reach \nthis stage, but retail competition is the eventual goal of the reform process. \n ", "  Appendix 6  47 \n \n \n ", "48  Appendix 7 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF ASSAM STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD \n \nA.  Past Financial Performance of Assam State Electricity Board \n \n1.  In the past, the Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB) has been unable to meet its \noperational cash requirements due to high transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, poor \nbilling and collection, high operating costs of power purchases and employees, and insufficient \ntariff adjustments to the cost of supply. Accumulated losses have extinguished owner\u2019s equity, \nwhich at the end of FY2003 was a negative Rs49.8 billion, exceeding total assets of Rs37.6 \nbillion. Due to lack of essential maintenance, aged and inefficient generation plants have forced \nASEB to increase costly power purchases from external sources, such as central public sector \nundertakings  (CPSUs)  and  neighboring  state  electricity  boards  and  Independent  Power \nProducers, to meet continuing power shortages. In addition, inadequate T&D capacity has \nresulted in a low quality of power supply and high T&D losses (more than 40%). As the tariffs \ncover about a half of the costs of supply and the government of Assam (GOA) has been unable \nto provide required subsidies and subventions, ASEB has been in a chronic cash deficit and has \ndefaulted  on  payments  for  power  purchase,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  debt \nobligations. This has made it difficult for ASEB to gain funding support from financial institutions. \nThe summary of operational and financial indicators is shown in Table A6.1. The historical and \nprojected financial statements are indicated in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n     \nTable A7.1: Historical Operational and Financial Highlights of  \nAssam State Electricity Board \nItems  1997/98 1998/99 1999/00 2000/01 2001/02  2002/03a\nPower Generation (MWh)  936 855 801 869 787  707\nPower Purchase (MWh)  1,747 1,978 2,072 2,306 2,460  2,512\nPower Sales (MWh)  1,511 1,595 1,672 1,911 1,818  1,960\nT&D Loss (%)  30.0 38.0 42.0 39.8 44.0  41.2\n             \nOperating Cash Surplus/Deficits (EBITDA)b (Rs million)  (1,841) (2,182) (3,115) (3,375) (3,445)  (1,114)\nProfit/Loss after Tax (Rs million)  (3,509) (4,912) (5,780) (6,075) (6,321)  (4,102)\nOperating Ratio    0.70 0.68 0.63 0.65 0.65  0.85\n             \nAverage Tariff (Rs/kWh)  2.41 2.42 2.91 3.00 3.26  3.59\nAverage Cost of Supply (Rs/kWh)  5.22 5.77 6.98 6.76 7.33  6.56\nCost Recovery (%)  46 42 42 44 45  55\n             \nAverage Tariff (Rs/kWh) \u2013 Annual Changes (%)    0.4 20.0 3.4 8.7  9.9\nAverage Cost of Supply (Rs/kWh) - Annual Changes (%)     10.5 21.1 -3.2 8.5  -10.5\nkWh = kilowatt-hour, MWh = megawatt-hour, T&D = transmission and distribution. \na Based on provisional accounts.  \nb\n Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and any noncash items (Government of Assam \nsubsidies). \nSource: Assam State Electricity Board data. \n \n2.  In FY2002/03 on a provisional basis, some improvements on ASEB\u2019s operations have \nbeen observed. ASEB reduced its cash operating deficits by 68% from FY2001/02 due to the \nreduction of power purchase costs available from cost-efficient hydropower plants. As a result, \nthe cost recovery of FY2002/03 has also improved to 55% from 45% in FY2001/02. ASEB has \nremained current on power purchase bills from CPSUs since July 2002. At present, ASEB \n ", "  Appendix 7  49 \nmaintains the bill collection rate at 96%. In addition, Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission \n(AERC) granted ASEB the first tariff award including the average tariff increase of 13.5% after \nfuel price adjustment, effective 1 April 2003 (for FY2003/04).  \n \nA.  Implementation of Financial Restructuring Plan \n \n3.  To improve the financial viability of ASEB, the financial restructuring plan (FRP) was \napproved by GOA in October 2003. This will include measures such as (i) cleaning of the \nbalance sheet by settlement of accumulated dues to creditors and cross-claims between ASEB \nand GOA; (ii) transfer of assets and liabilities from ASEB to its successor companies; and \n(iii) GOA cash supports for the successor companies during the transitional period until the \noperating expenses and servicing obligations of the liabilities passed on to the successor \ncompanies are fully met by such companies.  \n \n4.  Settlement of Cross-Liabilities between GOA and ASEB. Prior to the transfer of \nbalance sheet items to the successor companies, the settlement of cross-liabilities between \nGOA and ASEB will be carried out. This component of the FRP includes the settlement of the \nfollowing: (i) items owed by GOA to ASEB including subventions, rural electrification (RE) \nsubsidy, and receivables from municipal bodies; (ii) items owed by ASEB to GOA and other \nparties including GOA loans, electricity duties, loans from Rural Electrification Corporation \n(REC), defaulted bonds and defaulted loans from Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), additional \ndues owed to CPSUs post 30 September 2001, and dues owed to Megalaya State Electricity \nBoard (MeSEB), West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB), and Grid Corporation of Orissa \n(GRIDCO).The ASEB\u2019s three receivable items (subventions, RE subsidy, municipal bodies\u2019 \ndues) from GOA will be set off against GOA loan and electricity duties as mutual financial \nobligations in the book entries. As a result of these book adjustments, other liabilities owed to \nthird parties will be transferred to GOA from ASEB. Finally, the net amounts1 will be written off \nfrom  the  book  accounts  of  both  ASEB  and  GOA.  The  category-wise  costs  of  the  cross-\nsettlement under the FRP are indicated in Appendix 6. This component of the FRP is completed \nbefore the first tranche release. \n \n5.  CPSU Dues Transferred to GOA. Based on the tripartite agreements (recommended \nby Montek Singh Ahluwalia Committee) in March 2003 among GOA, the Government and the \nReserve Bank of India, the past dues owed to some of the three CPSUs2 as of 30 September \n2001 were securitized as \u201cAssam Special Bonds (October) 2006\u201d in September 2003. The \nbalance dues to other CPSUs3 as of 30 September 2001 are to be securitized after negotiations \nand  mutual  agreements.  Since  the  cut-off  date  of  30  September  2001,  however,  ASEB \naccumulated  dues  until  June  2002.

Projected Financial Performance of Assam State Electricity Board \n \n8.  Based on the FRP, the financial projection consolidating ASEB and all its successor \ncompanies is made under the assumptions that (i) the cross-settlement of dues between GOA \nand ASEB and the subsequent cleaning of balance sheet items would be finalized within \nFY2003/04 and (ii) no subvention would be provided by GOA. In addition, the system loss is \n ", "  Appendix 7  51 \nprojected to reduce by 16% by FY2007/08 as all the project components are completed. The \naverage  tariff  is  projected  to  increase  at  a  moderate  pace  taking  into  accounts  domestic \ninflation. The resulting projected operational and financial indicators are shown in Table A7.3. \n \n9.  The  projection  indicates  that  cash  revenue  of  the  sector  will  meet  all  operational \nexpenses  including  power  purchases,  payroll,  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  by \nFY2005/06 and all cash expenditures including debt service obligations, capital expenditures, \nand working capital requirements by FY2006/07. Eventually, the sector will start posting net \nprofits in FY2010/11 driven by loss reductions and tariff rationalization. However, GOA\u2019s full \nsupport for cash deficit funding during these transitional period will be vital so as to avoid \npayment defaults to suppliers and creditors and help the sector achieve financial sustainability \nas  soon  as  possible.  Furthermore,  to  cut  down  cost  of  supply,  ASEB  and  its  successor \ncompanies will need to tap cheaper power sources and rationalize its labor force to reduce \nemployee costs.4  \n \nTable A7.3: Projected Operational and Financial Performance  \nof Assam State Electricity Board \n \nItem/Year  2003/042004/052005/062006/072007/082008/092009/102010/112011/12\nT&D Loss (%)  40.0 38.4 34.9 29.5 25.0 22.5 21.5 20.5 19.5\n                   \nOperating Cash Surplus/Deficits (EBITDA) \n(Rs million)  (180) (151) 370 1863 2043 2888 3725 3963 3810\nCash Surplus/Deficits                                     \n(Rs million)  (1,103) (758) (488) 115 38 184 1,040 1,835 1,932\nProfit/Loss after Tax (Rs million)  (1,770) (2,302) (2,578) (1,799) (1,770) (1,022) (157) 128 25\n                   \nOperating Ratio   0.87 0.84 0.85 0.95 0.96 1.00 1.05 1.05 1.04\nDebt Service Coverage Ratio  (0.03) (0.12) 0.44 1.07 1.03 1.11 1.44 1.91 2.08\nDebt to Equity Ratio  0.49 0.54 0.54 0.56 0.53 0.42 0.33 0.26 0.21\n(portion of long-term debt) (%)  33 35 35 36 35 30 25 20 17\n                   \nAverage Tariff (Rs/kWh)  4.05 4.26 4.49 4.57 4.73 4.94 5.18 5.46 5.78\nAverage Cost of Supply (Rs/kWh)  5.54 5.84 6.07 5.73 5.80 5.71 5.66 5.86 6.22\nCost Recovery (%)  73 73 74 80 82 86 91 93 93\n                   \nAverage Tariff (Rs/kWh)                                    \n- Annual Changes (%)  13.1 5.1 5.3 1.8 3.5 4.4 4.8 5.5 5.9\nAverage Cost of Supply (Rs/kWh)                                   \n- Annual Changes (%)  (15.6) 5.4 3.9 (5.6) 1.2 (1.5) (0.9) 3.5 6.1\nEBITDA = earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization; kWh = kilowatt-hour; T&D = transmission and \ndistribution. \nSource: ADB staff estimates, Assam State Electricity Board. \n \n                                                 \n4  Employee costs represent 25% of operating expenditures.  \n ", "52  Appendix 8 \nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nSector  identified  as  a  National  Priority  in  Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in  Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?  \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Assam:  \n \nThe investment in power sector in Assam ultimately benefits poor and vulnerable groups more than the nonpoor. \nAbout 40% the state\u2019s population is poor. Around three fourth of the population and more than 90% of poor are \ncurrently deprived of the direct benefits of state\u2019s power sector. Even among connected households, a significant \nnumber are disconnected each year due to floods and poor maintenance of electricity lines. The Assam State \nElectricity Board (ASEB) is currently unable to reconnect villages due to financial problems. Since the use of electricity \nin agriculture is extremely low in Assam, crop productivity is much lower in the state than in other Indian states. This \nhas direct implications for the poor because improvements in crop productivity, as in the \u201cgreen revolution,\u201d lead to \nreduced rural poverty. Because of the poor quality of supply, industries in Assam have to deal with losses and higher \ncosts of power, which limit the prospects of industrial development and employment growth. These too have negative \nimplications for the poor. Thus the investment in the power sector for reducing transmission and distribution (T&D) \nlosses, increasing the ability to transmit more power, increase connections, and reconnect disconnected villages \nwould benefit the poor immensely. It would also enhance the capacity of the government of Assam (GOA) to invest in \nmore poverty reduction programs and other social services such as health and education, thus directly benefiting the \npoor.  \n \nThe project will help, directly or indirectly, reduce poverty by lowering household energy costs, and removing energy \nconstraints to enterprises that offer employment opportunities for the poor. There is an association between \nelectrification, higher income levels, improved health status, and educational achievements. Direct benefits will extend \nto all categories of consumer\u2014poor and nonpoor\u2014in improvements in the existing quality of supply. It is expected that \nmore than half a million new consumer households will be enabled to connect over the next 10 years as the low-\nvoltage lines are extended. As 26% of households in Assam are already connected, mostly in urban areas, most of \nthese new beneficiaries will be rural poor. Direct benefits to households include better quality lighting for the same \noutlay as they currently incur on kerosene, and improved air quality in the home. Electricity is cheaper for a given \namount of light delivered than these traditional fuels. \n \nShort-term direct benefits may occur in opportunities in labor and contracting for supply of goods and services in the \nconstruction phase of the projects. There is pent-up industrial demand for power. Longer-term employment benefits \nwill follow when it is easier to provide new industrial connections and quality supply to existing ones. This and more \nconnections to commercial consumers will have direct benefits in terms of employment opportunities for the many \nqualified youths currently unemployed or underemployed. Better quality power is a necessary (if not sufficient) \ncondition to improving access to irrigation that could have a major impact on improving incomes of the rural poor, most \nof whom hold subeconomic plots of cultivable land. Indirect public benefits will be derived through public facilities such \nas street lighting and social infrastructure such as hospitals and schools.  \n \nGender impacts of electrification are particularly favorable. The lack of electricity connections and the poor quality of \nsupply affects women more since they are more home-bound than men. Such a lack also increases their morbidity as \nthey work in poorly ventilated kitchens with smoky biomass-based ovens (chulas), and use traditional appliances that \nrequire high physical effort. Women want electricity and have clear views of its power to reduce drudgery, ease \nworking hours, increase access to the media, and enhance general amenity in their lives. \n \nB.        Poverty Analysis                                     Proposed Classification: Economic growth \n \nThis assessment is based on a survey of 600 households spread over several districts of Assam, and on secondary \ndata from a number of sources. Over 40% of the population in the state are below the Indian poverty line, whereas the \nwhole of country rate is 36%. Average annual per capita income is $212, against the Indian level of $386. The human \ndevelopment index (HDI) of Assam is only 0.386, whereas the national average is 0.472. Assam ranks 14th out of 15 \nstates. In terms of social development, the state has a higher infant mortality rate than the Indian average. Nearly 45% \nof women are illiterate. Only 60% of households have access to safe drinking water. Only 10% of people live in a \nreasonably good house. Around 70% of the workforce is in low-productive agriculture. The labor force participation \nrate in general is lower in Assam than in India on average, and more so for women.  \n \n ", "56  Appendix 10 \n \nSome nonincome poverty indicators are generally favorable relative to the whole of India, due to low population \ndensities and the structure of society. For example, almost double the number of Assamese as compared to all of \nIndian households have a latrine. About 11% of the Assam population belongs to tribal groups, which are categorized \nas  scheduled  tribes.  However,  consumption  expenditures  seem  to  be  reasonably  well  distributed  across  the \nScheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other households in rural Assam. One survey shows that 70% of families \nwith a monthly income below Rs2,000 have no electricity connection. Scheduled tribes have relatively favorable \nconnection rates, at 64%. The poor pay 5\u201310% of their income for, on the whole, poor quality energy: kerosene for \nlighting, and biomass fuels, usually gathered, for cooking. For average current expenditures on kerosene, a poor \nhousehold can run two lights, a fan, and a television. However, the poor spend larger sums of money on poor quality \nsurrogates than they would spend for superior electricity service. The state has witnessed severe insurgency problems \nand social conflicts between different ethnic groups during the last 20 years. These have created significant social and \neconomic losses for the state. The financial position of GOA is very weak. This has seriously affected the ability of the \nstate to finance public facilities in health and education, etc. \n \nThe proposed project leads to a reduction of transmission and distribution losses and an addition of capacity to \ntransmit and supply power. This is important since transmission and distribution losses of 40% are a major cause of \nnonviability of the Assam power sector. Capacity addition is also urgently required to extend connection from the \ncurrently meager 25% of the population to all, within a decade. The rural electrification (RE) component aims at \nreconnecting 1,201 villages (which had electricity in the past but lost it due to natural calamities and poor \nmaintenance) with the potential to connect 77,600 households. In addition, there will be 3,478 commercial consumers, \n716 industrial consumers, and 1,146 other consumers. The investment to reduce losses and enhance capacity would \nalso ultimately reduce the cost of power for the economy, which might help lessen one of the major constraints of \nagricultural and industrial development of the state. These benefits of the investment project help 40% of Assam\u2019s \npoor since they did not have electricity connection. This project will ease the financial burden of GOA in the power \nsector and enhance its ability to invest in the social sector. \n \n \nC.          Participation Process \n \nStakeholder Analysis: Yes \n \nInterviews were held with central stakeholders before the fieldwork commenced. Institutional stakeholders are ASEB, \nblock offices who identify the poor, and indigenous people's development agencies. Numerous civil society groups are \nstakeholders: Mahila Samiti, water user groups, commerce and industry councils, and religious organizations. At the \ngrassroots  level,  household  consumers,  both  poor  and  nonpoor,  are  stakeholders.  Nonconsumers  are  also \nstakeholders in that they benefit from the provision of electrified public facilities. In the field, semistructured interviews \nwere conducted with the institutional stakeholders. Focus group meetings were held with some civil society and \nconsumer groups, and 600 household surveys were conducted. Assistance was sought from the village authorities to \nidentify roughly equal percentages of below poverty line, average and above average income households for \ninterview. The sample was skewed in favor of the better off. Largely out of necessity, the impact areas of the \nsubstations that are the starting point of the survey work are in urban or rural town areas. Consumer education is \nrecommended for poor rural consumers in safe and productive uses of electricity, but this will be developed by ASEB \nand no special participation strategy is required. The sustainability of electricity supply created through the RE \ncomponent requires establishment of participatory village electricity user associations and this will be addressed in the \ntechnical assistance (TA) component for RE. \n \nD.            Gender Development \n  \nThough all members of society gain from electrification, women are the major winners. They gain from better light and \nbetter indoor air quality where electricity is replacing kerosene and fuelwood. Their working hours are extended, but \nthey themselves cite this as a benefit, since it enables them to rest during the hottest part of the day and complete \ntheir work in the cooler evening hours under artificial light. Time use surveys indicated that women work an average \n8.25-hour day on domestic chores alone. If these tasks must be accomplished in hours of natural light, there is no time \nfor recreation or personal development. Girls work 3 hours on domestic duties, while boys work 45 minutes. Women \nexpect economic benefits from the subprojects through increased employment opportunities and decreased domestic \ndrudgery. Associated with adult literacy programs, introducing electricity can have a dramatic effect on women's formal \nskills levels. Women in rural Assam suffer less discrimination on grounds of gender or caste than the rest of India; with \n56% female literacy, their education status is relatively favorable. Electrification has a major impact on their awareness \nthrough the mass media of the outside world, health and education issues, market forces, and other opportunities.  \n ", "  Appendix 10  57 \n \nE.

Project Description \n1.  The main objective of this project is to improve the quality and quantity of supply of \nelectricity available to consumers in Assam state. An investment component is included to \nstrengthen  and  upgrade  transmission  and  distribution  capability  and  intensify  rural \nelectrification. The proposed investment component of the Assam Power Sector Development \nProject (the Project) involves seven new transmission lines totaling 549 kilometers (kms), 13 \nnew  substations  that  have  implications  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  a  rural \nelectrification (RE) scheme without any land acquisition impact.  \n \nB.  Project Area and Impacts \n2.  Construction of Substations. Substations require a total of 70 hectares of land. For the \nsubstations to be located at Boko, Narangi, Bokakhat Golaghat, Moran, Namrup, Diphu, and \nSilchar, government land has been acquired in the past 10 to 25 years. This land has been \nenclosed, and is free from squatters or encroachments. A further  19.5 hectares (ha) of land \nremains to be acquired in five districts for the substations at Nalbari, Sinbsagar, Biswanath, \nCharali, and Majuli. This land is a mixture of titled land and government land encroached for \nagriculture and grazing.  \n \n3.  Transmission  Lines.  A  single  220-kilovolt  (kV)  line  of  192  kilometers  spans  two \ndistricts, Kamrup and Darrang. The six remaining lines are 132 kV lines, total 302 km: Tinsukia\u2013\nNamrup (44 km), Jorhat\u2013Bokakhat (76 km), Lanka\u2013Diphu (72 km), Garmur\u2013Nazira (80 km), \nNazira\u2013Sibsagar (25 km), and Sarusajai\u2013Kalipara (4 km). Construction of transmission line \nrequires minimal land acquisition. For each 220 kV line footing, 10m2 is required at 350 meter \nintervals. For the 132 kV lines, 8 m2 footings are required at the same interval. Total land \nrequirements for footings are 10.5 hectares. In addition, a transmission corridor of 35 meters in \nwidth must be cleared of trees. Based on survey in May\u2013June 2003, approximately 70 persons \nwill be affected by minor acquisition of private land for the remaining substations; most will be \ngovernment land. Average land loss will be 0.15 hectares with a range from 0.1 to 0.3 hectares. \nLand use in this area is permanently restricted. Compensation is paid for trees owned and \ncustomarily used within this corridor. The land so restricted is still available for low crops and \ngrazing. Table A10.1 indicates the outcomes of surveys for impacts of the land acquisition \nrequirements. \n \nTable A11.1: Type of Impact and Number of Affected Persons \n \nType of Project  Number of  Length (kms)  Area (ha)  Number of \nComponents  APs \nSubstations  13    19.5  70a \nTransmission Lines  7  492  10.5  1,600b \nRE Scheme  3  361.5  None  320c \nTotal  20  492  30  1,670 \nAP = affected person, RE = rural electrification. \na Land. b Land and trees. c Trees. \nSource: Assam State Electricity Board data. \n \n4.  About 1,600 people are affected by land acquisition in transmission corridors. Population \ndensities in the districts through which transmission corridors pass vary from 86 to 604 per \n ", "  Appendix 11  59 \nsquare kilometer. As land holdings are small, it is unlikely that any single affected person (AP) \nwill lose more than 0.1 ha of land for right-of-way. The area enclosed by the four corners of \nfootings is open, and can still be used for low crops and grazing. \n \n5.  Ninety percent of tree losers in the survey will lose only one or two trees. In closed forest \nareas of the transmission corridor, about 350 trees are affected per linear kilometer. Based on \nthe survey, an estimated 60% of transmission corridors traverses government forest areas with \nlow population densities; average tree density is taken as 60 per kilometer for the transmission \ncomponents. State average percentage of indigenous peoples is 17%. In two districts there are \nhigh concentrations of indigenous peoples, up to 30% in project areas. Indigenous peoples are \nnot highly vulnerable, as their cultures tend to be homogenous and egalitarian. \n \n6.  RE Scheme. The RE component involves the reconstruction of 74.5 kilometers of 11-\nkilovolt  (kV)  lines,  287  kms  of  low  tension  lines  and  placing  around  1,200  low  tension \ntransformers. Reconstruction of these lines and transformers will be in existing rights-of-way or \non public land. Except for clearing the way by cutting trees in which around 320 people will be \naffected, no land acquisition or resettlement is required.  \n \nC.  Findings of the Socioeconomic Survey \n7.  A socioeconomic survey was conducted in May\u2013June 2003. Key informant interviews \nwere  conducted  with  Assam  State  Electricity  Board  (ASEB)  resident  engineers,  and  land \nacquisition officers. Where land had already been acquired, validation of its unencumbered \nstatus was undertaken. This confirmed that acquired land is not encroached or encumbered. \nHousehold surveys targeted 600 households across a range of incomes in impact areas. The \nsurvey revealed that impacts are neither extensive nor severe. About 26.5% of the APs are \nbelow the poverty line. More than half are engaged in agriculture, agricultural labor, or forest-\ndependent activities, of which almost 40% hold less than 0.66 ha of cultivated land. Most are in \nthe economically active age group. Scheduled Tribes/Scheduled Castes of the survey AP profile \naccounted for approximately 11%. The survey and discussions with local informants indicate \nthat neither the extent not the severity of impact is severe for indigenous peoples. In Karbi \nAnglong, the district with the highest concentration of indigenous peoples (17.8%), informants at \na focus group meeting stated that they welcomed the subproject and anticipated improvements \nin employment and economic conditions as an outcome. \n \nD.  Resettlement Principle and Compensation \n8.  The primary objective of the resettlement plan is to mitigate any negative impact of the \nproject. The principles guiding land acquisition and resettlement in the subprojects are ADB's \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement, 1995; the Government of India Land Acquisition Act, 1894, \nand its subsequent amendments; and the Land Regulations for the State of Assam, amended in \n1990. The entitlement matrix, Table A10.2, summarizes the treatment to be applied to the \nadverse impacts. \n \n9.  Based on the inventory of losses identified in the survey and consultations with APs, an \nentitlement matrix has been developed, which recognizes the categories of loss. Compensation \nfor the types of losses identified in the survey will be calculated as follows: \n \n ", "60  Appendix 11 \nTable A11.2: Entitlement Matrix \n \nSl.

Stakeholder Participation, Disclosure, and Grievance-Redress Mechanisms \n10.  Land acquisition and compensation will take place under the provisions of the Land \nAcquisition Act, 1894 and subsequent amendments. Procedures for participation and disclosure \nas prescribed under the Act will apply. These include informing the land acquisition officer (LAO) \nin the District Revenue Department, who posts notices on the affected land prior to the planned \nacquisition, actively seeks out APs, places public notification in two newspapers, at least one in \nthe local language, and invites APs to meetings. The LAO or district collector will propose a \ncompensation plan and schedule to be agreed with APs. The summary resettlement plan will be \nmade public, and will be posted on the ADB web site. Compensation will be paid out by the \nDistrict Revenue Department. \n \n11.  Claims, disputes, and grievances will be lodged with the Revenue Office. The ASEB \ncircle land acquisition and resettlement officer (LARO) will liaise with the district land acquisition \nofficer to track progress of claims and any disputes arising from them. ASEB will retain the \nservices of an independent monitor who will advise on mediation of disputes to an ad hoc \ncommittee comprising a community leader, resident engineer, and an ASEB LARO, and the \nLAO from the Revenue Department. The grievance redress committee will also be established \nas part of the Head Office, LARO. Disputes that cannot be mediated will be referred to the \ncourts in the normal manner. This process is described in the full RP (see Supplementary \nAppendix I). \n \nF.  Institutional Framework and Budget \n12.  ASEB will set up a project management unit (PMU) to oversee and direct all the \nactivities under the project. One senior male and one senior female LARO will be appointed in \nthe Transmission and Distribution Division. These officers, preferably from amongst those \nsurplus to requirements under the restructuring component and with skills in social sciences, will \nreceive  training  in  the  new  principles  and  practical  approaches  to  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation  in  the  substation  component.  A  supervisory  consultant  will  assist  ASEB  to \nimplement  this.  The  LAROs  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement in the various subproject sites, and ensuring that these are timely implemented. \nThese officers will report to the PMU. The LAROs will be responsible for preparation of publicity \nmaterials and organizing public participation. \n \n13.  In each circle, a LARO will be appointed to manage the process in the districts under the \njurisdiction of the circle. They will interact with the district revenue offices. They will report \nthrough the resident engineers to the Head Office, LARO. Land acquisition and compensation \nreports will be made by the circle LARO monthly and passed to the Head Office, LARO, for \nreview at PMU subproject review meetings. The independent project performance monitor will \nattend these meetings for the relevant agenda item. The budget for implementation of the land \nacquisition and resettlement plan is around Rs59 million or $1.3 million. This includes cost of \ncompensation, administration, replacement of community facilities, and independent monitoring. \n \n ", "62  Appendix 11 \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n14.  Internal monitoring of land acquisition and resettlement will take place at circle and head \noffice level. LAROs will supply to the Head Office, LARO, information for their circle on progress \nand procedures against the objectives. These will include AP identification, public notification, \ntypes of claims and appeals lodged, and progress in compensation payments. LAROs will \npresent a consolidated monthly report to the PIO, including a monthly revision of progress of \ncompensation against budget. External monitoring will be provided by the independent project \nmonitor, who will review internal monthly reports. The independent monitor will report quarterly \nto the PMU on issues that have arisen in land acquisition and resettlement, and advise on \nmediation principles and procedures as required. \n ", "  Appendix 12  63 \nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES  \n($ million) \n \nProject Component  Foreign  Local  Total Cost \nExchange  Currency \nA.

Project Description \n \n1.  Project Scope \n1.  The investment component (the Project), comprises transmission and distribution (T&D); \nrural electrification (RE); and a revenue management system (RMS). Because the T&D impacts \nare  interdependent,  these  two  components  have  been  combined  for  the  purpose  of  the \neconomic and financial analyses. The anticipated benefits of the RMS are financial in nature, as \ndistinct from \u201ceconomic\u201d and comprise: (i) reduction of nontechnical losses, and (ii) reduction in \nthe amounts of working  capital tied up in accounts receivable. Therefore, only a financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR), and not an economic internal rate of return (EIRR), was calculated \nfor the RMS. The poverty impact ratio (PIR) of a component(s) is an estimate of the proportion \nof the net economic benefits that accrue to the poor. Each category of cost and benefit is \nassigned to the relevant stakeholder groups (e.g., government, domestic consumers, other \nconsumers), and the proportion of each that accrues to the poor is estimated. The total net \neconomic costs and benefits to the poor are divided by the overall total to determine the PIR for \nthe project. The results of these calculations are presented in the sections that follow. \n \n2.  Project Costs \n2.  The  project  costs  inclusive  of  allowances  for  physical  contingencies  have  been \ncalculated in constant 2003 prices and are summarized below. \nTable A15.1: Project Costs  \n($ million) \nComponent  Foreign  Local  Total \nCost  Cost  Cost \nDistribution Scheme (14 circles)  0  96.31  96.31 \nTransmission   24.31  12.39  36.70 \nRevenue Management System  1.90  6.44  8.34 \nRural Electrification  4.40  0.00  4.40 \nConsulting Services  4.40  0.00  4.40 \nTotal Project Cost  95.11  130.83  225.93 \nSource: ADB staff estimates. \n  \nB.  Project Financial and Economic Analysis \n \n1.  Cost-Effectiveness \n \n3.  The project components are planned in a cost-effective manner. When the project \nobjectives have been determined, the engineers identify a number of alternative ways to attain \nthese objectives. They examine the alternatives thoroughly and select the least expensive one \nthat meets the required standards. \n \n2.  Approach and Methodology \n \na.  Transmission and Distribution Costs and Benefits \n4.  The T&D components will reduce technical losses and enable additional supply to the \nexisting customers, meeting demands at peak times that would otherwise go unsatisfied. In \n ", "Appendix 15   67\naddition, because the components strengthen the system and increases capacity, the load-flow \nmodel of Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB) forecasts an increase in sales that greatly \nexceeds the reduction in losses. The T&D components lead to reduction of technical losses, \nwhich are then sold. The components also lead to an increase in variable costs associated with \nthe generation or purchase, transmission, and distribution of the incremental energy. In the \nfinancial analysis costs have been valued at the average financial cost of generation plus \npurchases, whereas in the economic analysis, they were valued at the economic or marginal \ncosts.  The  benefit  of  the  T&D  components  results  from  increased  sales.  In  the  financial \nanalysis, they are valued at the average financial tariff, and in the economic analysis they are \nvalued as willingness to pay (WTP).  \n \nb.  Revenue Management System Costs and Benefits  \n5.  Only  the  financial  costs  and  benefits  (FIRR)  of  the  RMS  component  have been \nassessed. The benefit is the reduction in commercial losses, valued at the average tariff \u2014 in \nsuch a supply-constrained environment the reduced commercial losses will be fully absorbed by \ndemand. Since there are no economic benefits, no PIR was calculated for this component. \n \nc.  Rural Electrification Costs and Benefits \n6.  The purpose of the RE component is to restore electricity to some of the villages that \nhave become \u201cde-electrified\u201d. The resulting reinforcement of the RE system restore electricity \nthat had been enjoyed by consumers and will provide incremental volumes to meet repressed \ndemand. All the electricity sales resulting from the RE  component are assumed to reflect \nincremental energy usage. Accordingly, the direct benefit of this component is measured by the \nconsumers\u2019 WTP, estimated as the average of the price of kerosene and the revenue yield per \nkWh, multiplied by a factor of 0.8 to represent a nonlinear demand curve. This underestimates \nthe economic benefit, because there are probably some customers who substituted kerosene \nand who would, therefore, realize the resource cost savings (i.e., the price of kerosene less the \ncost  of  electricity)  when  they  switched  to  electricity.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  RE \ncomponent also include the indirect benefits of street lighting and other public services, which \nbenefit the poor whether or not they are connected. \n \n7.  A primary reason that the FIRR for the RE component is negative is that the revenue per \nkWh for rural domestic customers is significantly lower than that for urban domestic customers. \nAt the level of usage estimated for these customers, the domestic tariff would have to be Rs3.17 \nper kWh in order for the component to exhibit an FIRR of 8%. The present RE component will \nnot connect additional customers; however, new connections are an essential part of ASEB\u2019s \nRE plan, which is intended to bring electrification to all households by 2012.  Additionally, all \ncustomers will be metered; this means that the existing rural domestic customers will pay the full \ntariff for each kWh consumed. Subsidies to rural customers will be directed at the connection \ncharges rather than the tariff. Accordingly, a large increase in customers is expected, who will \npurchase electricity at the tariff, which is still below the maximum WTP (as estimated by the \nprice of kerosene). Therefore, the realistic financial prospects for the RE program overall \nexceed what is implied by the calculation of the FIRR for the present investment component. \nThe EIRR for the  component is high, derived from the additional electricity sold to existing \ncustomers. In addition, the RE component will provide indirect benefits to all residents of the \nreelectrified villages, through increased street lighting and other public services. This effect is \nincluded in the calculation of the PIR. \n \n \n ", "68   Appendix 15 \n3.  Valuation of Costs and Benefits \n \n8.  For the financial analysis all costs and benefits are expressed in constant 2003 financial \nprices. For the economic analysis, the foreign exchange numeraire (2003 prices) has been used \nto value costs and benefits. Traded goods and services are valued in terms of their direct impact \non foreign exchange, while nontraded goods are valued in terms of their indirect impact on \nforeign exchange. A conversion factor of 0.85 is used to convert the financial cost of labor to \neconomic values while a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 has been used for other costs. \nAdditional  consumption  is  valued  at  the  consumers  WTP.  WTP  is  discussed  in  detail  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. The PIR is the proportion of net economic benefits that accrue to \nthe poor. The PIR is based on the difference between the financial and the economic value of \nthe different categories of costs and benefits. \n \n9.  The financial and economic internal rates of return and the PIR for the components are \nsummarized below: \nTable A15.2: Cost-Benefit Analyses (%) \n \nItem  FIRR  EIRR  PIR \nTransmission and Distribution  12.0  15.7  12.5 \nRural Electrification  \u2013  57.2  25.4 \nRevenue Management System  30.9  \u2013  \u2013 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, PIR = poverty impact ratio \n\u201c\u2013\u201c = not available.  \nSource: ADB staff estimates. \n \n10.  The FIRRs for the T&D and RMS components exceed the ASEB\u2019s weighted average \ncost of capital.1 The absence of any return for RE reflects the high costs and high losses \nincurred in the rural areas and the low average revenue received from a customer base that is \ndominated by domestic users. The relatively high level of benefits of the RMS component stems \nfrom the efforts to reduce nontechnical losses with the return reflecting the combined impact of \nRMS investment and sector reforms.  \n \n11.  All the EIRRs exceed the economic opportunity cost of capital, which is of the order of \n10 to 12%. The exceptionally high EIRR for the RE component is a function of the relatively low \ninvestment required to reestablish supply in areas where supply facilities already exist and the \nrelatively  high  opportunity  cost  associated  with  alternative  sources  of  energy  supply.  The \nprojects\u2019 projected benefits exceed their costs and show that all the projects are economically \njustified  and  the  T&D  and  RMS  are  financially  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis  is  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. \n \n4.  Social Impact \n \n12.  The social impact of the subprojects is measured by the PIR, which estimates the \nproportion of economic benefits that accrue to the poor. In the base case, the proportion of \ngovernment expenditures on the poor is estimated at 10%. The proportion of capital investment \nand operation and maintenance that is assumed to consist of labor wages is 10%, and all the \nlaborers are assumed to be skilled (i.e., nonpoor). The indirect benefits of public use of \nelectricity under the RE program is assumed to equal 20% of the benefits of electricity to \nconsumers; these accrue to poor and nonpoor, connected and nonconnected households, alike. \n                                                 \n1  Indicative returns with the capital asset pricing model and Indian capital market data suggest that the maximum \nWACC would not exceed 8% on real term. \n ", "Appendix 15   69\nAs these assumptions are changed modestly, the PIR fluctuates greatly. This is less striking in \nthe RE component, which already provides a high proportion of direct benefits to the poor; \nhowever, for the T&D components, which has a PIR of 12.5% in the base case, an assumption \nof 20% government spending on the poor increases the PIR to 38.3%, while an assumption of \n5% decreases it to -0.37%.  \n \na.  Transmission and Distribution \n \n13.  The PIR for the T&D components was calculated as follows. First, the net present value \nwas calculated for  every cost and direct benefit category associated with the  component \nexpressed in both the financial and economic terms. For each category the financial value was \nsubtracted from the economic value to yield the net economic cost or benefit. Each category \nwas attributed to the appropriate stakeholder. The investment and variable costs were assigned \nto the government, as they are the owners of ASEB. The net economic benefit of increased \nsales impacts only existing customers. An indirect benefit to labor was derived investment and \noperation and maintenance, corresponding to labor, because the laborers receive the benefit of \nwages. The net economic value of these wages is calculated as the economic value minus the \nfinancial value. \n \n14.  For each category, the proportion of cost or benefit accruing to the poor was estimated. \nThe government\u2019s share is applied to government programs, 10% of which benefits the poor. \nAccording to the data in the financial model 46% of energy sales are to domestic customers and \n54% are to commercial and industrial customers. These percentages have been applied to the \nincremental sales resulting from the T&D component. The proportion of poor recipients of the \nbenefits (i.e., poor connected households as a proportion of total connected households) have \nbeen calculated from the poverty impact studies conducted in conjunction with this document. \nNone of the benefits for nondomestic customers is assumed to accrue to the poor. This \ncomponent is assumed to employ only skilled labor; none of the indirect benefits to labor is \nattributed to the poor. \n \nb.  Rural Electrification \n \n15.  The PIR for the RE component was calculated according to the same method. However, \nbecause this component was implemented in rural villages that had no electrification, or very \nunreliable electricity supply, there were several differences in the analysis that must be noted. \nThe domestic beneficiaries of the increase in sales are exclusively rural households. From the \npoverty  impact  data,  it  was  possible  to  estimate  the  proportion  of  poor  rural  connected \nhouseholds as a proportion of connected rural households. In addition, RE offers indirect \nbenefits to unconnected households, in the form of increased street lighting and improved public \nservices. These benefits, per household, are estimated at 20% of the benefits to connected \nhouseholds. These benefits accrue to connected and unconnected households alike. From the \npoverty impact data, it was possible to estimate the proportion of poor rural households as a \nproportion of total rural households. \n \n16.  An RE study reported the number of customers, by customer class, that will benefit from \nthe RE component, together with the most recent available data on their connected load and \npeak load. However, since many of these customers were unmetered, it was not possible to \nreport their actual energy usage. Therefore, for the financial and economic analysis, the usage \nby customer class has been estimated in proportion to the connected load. The result is 87.8% \nusage by domestic customers and 12.2% by nondomestic customers. The PIR is 25.4%.
