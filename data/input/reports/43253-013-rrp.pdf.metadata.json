It  will  improve  water  use  efficiency  in  irrigated  agriculture  to  provide \neconomic opportunities to improve rural incomes.2   \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\n3. \nThe  state,  in the  south of  India,  has  a  population  of  61.1  million  and  covers  an  area  of \n191,976  square  kilometers  (5.83%  of  the  area  of  India).  It  is  home  to  one-third  of  India\u2019s \ninformation  technology  and  other  service  industries,  and  has  a  gross  state  domestic  product \n(GSDP) at current prices of $97.1 billion (FY2012). The main contribution (about 53% in FY2012) \nto GSDP is from the service sector. The contribution of agriculture to GSDP is relatively small, at \n16%  in  FY2012,  and  in  a  declining  trend  (from  about  30%  in  FY2001).  However,  agriculture \nremains  the  main source  of  employment  for  55%  of  the  population  and  about  75%  of  the  rural \npopulation. The state population is urbanizing, the urban population has increased from 34% to \n39% from 2001 to 2011.3 The changing industrial structure and urbanization have had significant \nimpact on the water balance in the state. \n \n4. \nCompeting demands for water resources. The state is water-stressed, with increasing \nwater  demands  from  urban  and  industrial  sectors.  This  is  exacerbated  by  uneven  spatial  and \ntemporal distribution of water resources and the predicted impacts of climate change.  Although \nKarnataka has two major river basins (the Krishna and Cauvery), its water resources are limited \n(about  1,072  cubic  meters  [m3]/person/year  in  eastward  flowing  rivers).4 Droughts  are  frequent \nand  70%  of  the  annual  rainfall  occurs  from  June  to  September.  The  state\u2019s  water  demand \n(particularly  for  industry  and  household  water)  is  projected  to  increase  by  40%  from \n37,419 million m3 in 2000 to 52,366 million m3 in 2025.5 These demands will cause a decline in \nthe  agricultural  proportion  of  total  water  from  84%  in  2000  to  73%  by  2025.  Meeting  the \nanticipated  rise  in  demand  is  a  major  challenge  which,  if  unmet,  may  constrain  sustainable \neconomic growth. \n \nIrrigated  agriculture.  About  3.09  million  hectares  (ha)  of  land  is  under  irrigation  in \n5. \nKarnataka  and  over  84%  of  state  water  resources  are  used  for  agriculture.  However,  cropping \nintensities (110%\u2013125%) and water use efficiency (40%) are low, and the gross area irrigated in \n2009\u20132010  is  about  59%  of  the  potential  area.  The  irrigation  sector  suffers  from  deficient \ninfrastructure  (resulting  from  insufficient  maintenance  and  lack  of  water  control  structures), \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

New  Delhi:  Academic \n\nFoundation. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nmanagement constraints (low service quality of operators), and limited promotion of water-saving \ncrops and practices. Efficient distribution is impeded by inadequate implementation of command \narea development works and low participation of water users cooperative societies (WUCSs) in \nirrigation  management.6 Improving  irrigation  water  productivity  requires  (i) increasing  water  use \nefficiency, (ii) reducing the gap between the actual and potential area that can be irrigated, and \n(iii) promoting water efficient techniques and technologies like drip irrigation.7 Greater efficiency \nwill  be  required  in  water  used  for  agriculture  to  meet  the  demands  of  other  users,  such  as \nindustry. \n \n6. \nVulnerability to climate change. The predicted impacts of climate change for Karnataka \ninclude  increased  temperatures  and  increased  mean  annual  rainfall,  and  decreased  and  more \nvariable  monsoon  rainfall.8 Overall,  the  investment  program  area  is  found  to  be  vulnerable  to \nincreased incidence of seasonal droughts.9 This will heighten the requirement for a well-planned \nand  methodical  approach  to  water  resources  management.  An  integrated  approach  to  water \nresources management is a means to reconcile varied and changing water uses and demands \nsince  it  provides  greater  flexibility  and  adaptive  capacity  than  conventional  water  resources \nmanagement approaches.10 \n\n7. \nRoad map, investment program, and lending modality. An IWRM road map will guide \nthe  strengthening  of  institutional  and  policy  frameworks,  capacity  building,  and  development  of \nmodernized  infrastructure.11 The  road  map,  developed  in  consultation  with  senior  management \nof  Karnataka\u2019s  Water  Resources  Department  (WRD)  during  project  preparation,  combines  the \nKarnataka state water policy, 2002; the state medium-term plan; and the National Water Mission, \n2011 to guide the state government\u2019s water sector investments. The road map, through physical \nand  nonphysical  investments,  will  support  the  state  to  meet  its  objective  of  improved  water \nresources  management  with  milestone  performance  targets.  To  achieve  this,  the  state  has \nproposed  an  ambitious  budget  allocation  of  about  $8.5  billion  during  FY2014\u2013FY2018  (in \nFY2014,  the  budgeted  allocation  is  $2.06  billion).  The  government  has  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to contribute to the state\u2019s investment program through an MFF, which \nis  well  suited \nto  \n(i) provide a longer-term lending instrument suited to IWRM process; (ii) afford flexibility in terms \nof project scope, timing, and size, which may be adjusted to meet emerging priorities of the road \nmap; and (iii) provide sufficient time for institutional strengthening in IWRM for key agencies and \nwater users.   \n \n8. \nStrategic context, link to government, and ADB strategies. The state\u2019s medium-term \nplan  emphasizes  greater  visibility  of  agriculture  and  allied  activities  to  increase  rural  incomes, \nand achieving a sustainable and orderly process of industrialization and urbanization for poverty \nreduction and sustained human development.12 The state\u2019s water policy of 2002 aims for holistic \n\nthe  most  effective  modality \n\ninvestment  as \n\nthis \n\nfor \n\nis \n\nit \n\n                                                \n6  Government  of  India,  State  Government  of  Karnataka,  Cooperation  Department.  1959.

The  National  Water  Mission,  2011;  National  Water  Policy,  2012;  and  the \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012\u20132017 all support the requirement for integrated planning of water \nresources across various users.13  \n\n9. \nThe investment program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017  for  India  by  reinforcing  core  areas  of  operations,  like \ninfrastructure development for water resources management, investing in irrigation infrastructure \nto  enhance  value  addition  in  agriculture,  and  developing  measures  to  increase  water  use \nefficiency.14 The investment program is also in accordance with the ADB Water Operational Plan, \n2011\u20132020. 15  It  will  improve  water  governance  by  embedding  IWRM  as  an  adaptive \nmanagement process, including for climate change adaptation; and improve water use efficiency \nto increase availability for competing uses. \n\n10. \nThe  state  has  a  number  of  enabling  factors  to  adopt  an  IWRM  approach,  including  \n(i)  recognition  of  the  scarcity  of,  and  threats  to,  water  resources;  (ii)  progressive  policy \nstatements; (iii) major investments in water resources infrastructure; (iv) technical capacity; and \n(v) a progressive outlook, as exemplified by semi-independent institutions of the state WRD like \nthe irrigation corporations or nigams, command area development authorities (CADAs), and the \nAdvanced Centre for Integrated Water Resources Management (AC-IWRM).16 \n \nImprovements  in  urban  water  management  will  be  addressed  under  a  separate  ADB- \n11. \nfinanced investment program.17 The two investment programs will be closely coordinated through \nthe AC-IWRM.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  investment  program  will  be  improved  sustainable  water \nsecurity  in  selected  river  basins  in  Karnataka.  Its  outcome  will  be  IWRM  successfully \nimplemented in selected river basins in Karnataka. \n   \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nThe program will produce three main outputs: (i) state and basin institutions strengthened \nfor  IWRM,  (ii)  irrigation  system  infrastructure  and  management  modernized,  and  (iii)  program \nmanagement  systems  operational.  There  will  be  two  key  components:    Gondi  irrigation  canal \nunder project 1,18 and Vijaynagara and Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal (TLBC) under project 2.  \n\n1. \n\nOutput  1:  State  and  Basin  Institutions  Strengthened  for  Integrated  Water \nResources Management \n\nThe  investment  program  will  strengthen  institutional  capacities  of  the  WRD  and           \n\n14. \nAC-IWRM  to  implement  IWRM  in  selected  river  basins  in  Karnataka.

The  PMU  will  have  day-to-day \nresponsibility  for  implementing  the  investment  program.  A  PIO  for  output  1  will  be  established \nwithin the AC-IWRM to be responsible for implementation of all IWRM-related activities of output \n1.  For  output  2,  each  irrigation  subproject  to  be modernized  will  have a dedicated  PIO that  will \ncomprise  field  staff  of  KNNL  who  will  be  strengthened  with  specific  technical  expertise  from \nCADAs  and  PSCs.  The  PMU  working  with  the  PIO  and  PSCs  will  monitor  overall  program \nexecution and will be responsible for monitoring and reporting.  \n\n23. \nConsulting services will provide technical support for program implementation. The three \nmain  consulting  services  packages  will  be  for  the  (i)  PSCs,  (ii)  IWRM,  and  (iii)  services  for \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (including  environmental  and  effects  monitoring).  The  PSCs  will  be \ninitially engaged for 4 years under project 1 and another 3 years under project 2.23 Firms will be \nrecruited  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method. 24 The  total  inputs  required  for \nPSCs for  project  1  will  be  230  person-months,  including  20  person-months  of  international  and \n210  person-months  of  national  consultants.

A baseline study will be undertaken in November 2014. \n\n25. \nAll  procurement  of  works  and  equipment  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), while recruitment of consultants \nand  other  services  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).25  \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe  investment  program  will  contribute  to  holistic  water  resources  management  in \n26. \nselected subbasins by implementing IWRM principles. The quantifiable benefits will be irrigation \nsystem modernization  and  improved farm  practices,  which will  result  in water  savings that may \nbe  productively  utilized  within  the  subbasin  by  other  users.  Improved  irrigation  water  use \nefficiency  will  potentially  benefit  about  1.5  million  people,  and  will  result  in  an  additional \n1,700 million  m\u00b3  of  water  that  can  be  saved  and  used  irrigating  an  additional  160,000  ha). \nFarmers\u2019  incomes  will  also  increase  from  incremental  crop  production  by  $1,054  for  marginal \nhouseholds and $3,911 for small households.26  \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n27. \nThe  program  will  contribute  to  improved  water  resources  management  by  introducing \nautomatic  flow  measurement  and  telemetry  within  the  K-8  sub-basin  and  on  projects  1  and  2 \nirrigation  subprojects.  System  modernization  will  include  installation  of  gravity  pipe  distribution \nwithin the command area to improve water use efficiency.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n28. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  undertaken  for  project  1  indicate  that  the  project  is \neconomically  viable.  It  provides  benefits  through  increased  agricultural  productivity  and \nhousehold incomes. Improved irrigation service delivery will lead to increased yields of up to 46% \nfor  paddy  rice  and  20%  for  other  crops.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  project  1  is \n\n                                                \n25 Procurement  Capacity  Assessment  and  Financial  Management  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n26 ADB.  2013.  Economic  and  Financial  Analysis  for  Karnataka  Integrated  and  Sustainable  Water  Resources \nManagement Investment Program (TA 7954-IND). Consultant\u2019s report. Manila. A marginal household is defined as \nholding  up  to  1  ha  of  land,  while  a small  household  holds 1  ha\u20132  ha  (Bimal  Misri.  1999.  Country  Pasture/Forage \nResource Profiles. India). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nestimated  at  17%.  The  sensitivity  tests  and  risk  analysis  confirm  that  project  1  is  robust. \nHowever,  incremental  benefits  to  the  project  are  sensitive  to  construction  delays.  Benefit \ndistribution  analyses  confirm  that  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  total  project  benefits  will  be \nshared by farmers and the poor.27  \n \n29. \nThe  WUCSs  and  KNNL  will  continue  to  maintain  systems  through  WUCS  contributions \nand  state  budget  support.  KNNL  and  the  AC-IWRM  are  not  directly  responsible  for  loan \nrepayment, which will be from the state. Overall, the state shows good fiscal health with a GSDP \nfor FY2012 of over $97.1 billion, and a declining trend in fiscal deficit from 3.24% in FY2010 to \n2.92%  in  FY2012.  The  repayment  of  $150  million  is  not  considered  to  pose  a  serious  debt \nburden on the state. \n  \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n30. \nFinancial management assessments carried out for KNNL and the AC-IWRM confirm the \nabsence  of  substantive  financial  management  and  procurement  risks.  Although  neither  agency \nhas  experience  with  implementing  externally  financed  development  projects,  the  risk  for  each \nagency  is  considered  minimal.  This  is  because  KNNL  has  extensive  experience  in  financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  implementation  of  large  irrigation  projects  in  accordance  with \nthe  statutory  requirements  of  the  state  and  India.  The  AC-IWRM,  though  it  is  a  recently \nestablished organization, has suitably qualified and experienced staff and is already operational \nand managing a sizeable budget for operations. Both KNNL and the AC-IWRM will be supported \nby the state, which has extensive experience in water resources-related and externally financed \nprojects. \n\nThe investment program has established clear input and output targets to facilitate good \n31. \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency.  Procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services \nfinanced  by  ADB  will  be  in  accordance  with  its  Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to \nand discussed with the government and the executing agency.  The specific policy requirements \nand  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  facility  administration  manual.    Financial \nmanagement  capacity  within  KNNL  and  the  AC-IWRM  will  be  strengthened  by  (i)  providing \ncapacity  building  on  ADB  disbursement,  financial,  and  project  management  guidelines;  (ii) \nassigning existing staff in KNNL at several levels (state, chief accounts officer, and zonal levels) \nwith additional responsibility for financial management of the project; (iii) introducing mandatory \ne-procurement  for  all  contracts  valued  at  more  than  $4,000,  subject  to  assessment  and \nclearance of the systems used for electronic bidding by ADB;28 (iv) ensuring civil works contracts \ninclude a condition that contractors adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate);  and  (v) reporting  on  project  activities  and  implementation  on  the  KNNL  and  program \nwebsites to foster transparency and timely awarding of contracts. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \nAssessments  have  been  completed  for  project  1  subprojects  to  prepare  strategies  for \npoverty  reduction  and  social  development  impact.29 The  project  interventions  will  (i)  strengthen \nWUCSs for improved water use efficiency on irrigation systems and collective actions to increase \nagricultural productivity; (ii) improve irrigation infrastructure and practice for equitable access to \nwater by small, marginal, and landless farmers; (iii) improve  annual farm incomes by over 50% \nfrom $693 to $1,053 for marginal households; (iv) introduce sustainable and innovative irrigation \n\n                                                \n27 Detailed Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 e-GP System Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nand agricultural practices, like drip irrigation; and (v) facilitate social inclusion.  \n\n33.  Women  will  benefit  from  (i)  capacity  building  in  IWRM;  (ii)  capacity  building  in  water \ngovernance  by  participating  in  WUCSs;  (iii)  skills  training  in  improved  land  and  water \nmanagement;  (iv)  participation  in  infrastructure  development;  and  (v)  overall  benefits  from \nincreased agricultural production.30 Specific activities will include (i) professional training of about  \n200 women in IWRM; (ii) at least 30% representation of women from the current 20% in 2014 in \nWUCS  management  boards;  and  (iii)  gender-specific  capacity  building  for  women  in  water \nmanagement and WUCS participation. The PSCs will include a social development and gender \nspecialist  for  24  person-months  and  each  PIO  will  include  one  female  community  organizer. \nTranche 1 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming.  \n\nE. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\n34. \nEnvironment.  Project  1  is  categorized  B  for  environment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  It  comprises  canal  modernization  for  the  Gondi  medium \nirrigation subproject and installation of flow measurement devices within the subbasin. An initial \nenvironmental examination has been prepared for project 1.31 An environmental assessment and \nreview  framework  has  also  been  developed  for  the  MFF  to  guide  subsequent  subprojects  and \ndevelopment interventions.32 Consultations were undertaken with affected stakeholders, and the \nexisting grievance redress mechanism of the state will be adopted. \n\n35. \nInvoluntary resettlement. Project 1 is categorized C for involuntary resettlement. This is \nbecause the project involves modernization of an existing canal system within the existing right-\nof-way,  and  the  WRD  already  owns  the  right-of-way  of  5  meters  alongside  the  canals  for \nfacilitating maintenance works  and  for  access.  No  land  acquisition  or  other  losses  will  result  in \ninvoluntary  resettlement  under  project  1.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  for  the \nentire  MFF  pursuant  to  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  it  will  be  followed  for  the \nsubsequent projects.33  \n\n36. \nIndigenous  peoples.  Project  1  is  categorized  C  for  the  indigenous  peoples  safeguard. \nThere are  no  indigenous peoples,  as defined by  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  in any  of the \nareas of project 1 or subsequent projects under the investment program. As subsequent projects \nwould also be categorized C, an indigenous peoples planning framework has not been prepared.  \n\n37. \nBased on preliminary investigation, project 2 subprojects are expected to be categorized \nsimilarly  to  project  1  subprojects.  The  resettlement  framework  and  the  environment  and \nassessment  review  framework  are  sufficiently  comprehensive  to  consider  any  subprojects  that \nmay deviate from the anticipated categorization.   \n\n38. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011), the investment program \ncommunication  strategy  sets  out  the  KNNL  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  requirements  for \n(i) types of information to be disclosed; (ii) mechanisms for notice, including language and timing; \nand \ninformation  disclosure  and \ndissemination.  \n \n\n(iii) implementation  and  monitoring \n\nresponsibilities \n\nfor \n\n                                                \n30 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n39.
