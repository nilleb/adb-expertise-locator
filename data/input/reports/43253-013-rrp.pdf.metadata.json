I  submit for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Karnataka Integrated and Sustainable Water \nResources Management Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The investment program will improve water availability to meet competing water demands \nin selected river basins in the state of Karnataka by implementing integrated water resources \nmanagement (IWRM). It will improve water use efficiency  in irrigated agriculture to provide \neconomic opportunities to improve rural incomes.2   \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The state, in the south of India, has a population of 61.1 million and covers an area of \n191,976  square  kilometers  (5.83%  of  the  area  of  India). It  is  home  to  one-third  of  India\u2019s \ninformation technology and other service industries, and has a gross state domestic product \n(GSDP) at current prices of $97.1 billion (FY2012). The main contribution (about 53% in FY2012) \nto GSDP is from the service sector. The contribution of agriculture to GSDP is relatively small, at \n16% in FY2012, and in a declining trend (from about 30% in FY2001). However, agriculture \nremains the main source of employment for 55% of the population and about 75% of the rural \npopulation. The state population is urbanizing, the urban population has increased from 34% to \n39% from 2001 to 2011.3 The changing industrial structure and urbanization have had significant \nimpact on the water balance in the state. \n \n4.  Competing demands for water resources. The state is water-stressed, with increasing \nwater demands from urban and industrial sectors. This is exacerbated by uneven spatial and \ntemporal distribution of water resources and the predicted impacts of climate change. Although \nKarnataka has two major river basins (the Krishna and Cauvery), its water resources are limited \n(about 1,072 cubic meters [m3]/person/year in eastward flowing rivers).4 Droughts are frequent \nand 70% of the annual rainfall occurs from June to September. The state\u2019s water demand \n(particularly  for  industry  and  household  water)  is  projected  to  increase  by  40%  from \n37,419 million m3 in 2000 to 52,366 million m3 in 2025.5 These demands will cause a decline in \nthe  agricultural  proportion  of  total  water  from  84%  in  2000  to  73%  by  2025.  Meeting  the \nanticipated rise in demand is a major challenge which, if unmet, may constrain sustainable \neconomic growth. \n \n5.  Irrigated  agriculture. About  3.09  million  hectares  (ha) of  land  is  under  irrigation  in \nKarnataka and over 84% of state water resources are used for agriculture. However, cropping \nintensities (110%\u2013125%) and water use efficiency (40%) are low, and the gross area irrigated in \n2009\u20132010  is  about  59%  of  the  potential  area.  The  irrigation  sector  suffers  from  deficient \ninfrastructure  (resulting  from  insufficient  maintenance  and  lack  of  water  control  structures), \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Census \n2011. http://www.indiaonlinepages.com/population/karnataka-population.html (accessed 9 June 2012). \n4  The Falkenmark water stress indicator defines water supplies below 1,000 m3/person/year as water stress that will \nimpede economic growth.

Karnataka Development Report 2007. New Delhi: Academic \nFoundation. ", "2   \nmanagement constraints (low service quality of operators), and limited promotion of water-saving \ncrops and practices. Efficient distribution is impeded by inadequate implementation of command \narea development works and low participation of water users cooperative societies (WUCSs) in \nirrigation management.6 Improving irrigation water productivity requires (i) increasing water use \nefficiency, (ii) reducing the gap between the actual and potential area that can be irrigated, and \n(iii) promoting water efficient techniques and technologies like drip irrigation.7 Greater efficiency \nwill be required in water used for agriculture to meet the demands of other users, such as \nindustry. \n \n6.  Vulnerability to climate change. The predicted impacts of climate change for Karnataka \ninclude increased temperatures and increased mean annual rainfall, and decreased and more \nvariable monsoon rainfall.8 Overall, the investment program area is found to be vulnerable to \nincreased incidence of seasonal droughts.9 This will heighten the requirement for a well-planned \nand methodical approach to water resources management. An integrated approach to water \nresources management is a means to reconcile varied and changing water uses and demands \nsince it provides greater flexibility and adaptive capacity than conventional water resources \nmanagement approaches.10 \n7.  Road map, investment program, and lending modality. An IWRM road map will guide \nthe strengthening of institutional and policy frameworks, capacity building, and development of \nmodernized infrastructure.11 The road map, developed in consultation with senior management \nof Karnataka\u2019s Water Resources Department (WRD) during project preparation, combines the \nKarnataka state water policy, 2002; the state medium-term plan; and the National Water Mission, \n2011 to guide the state government\u2019s water sector investments. The road map, through physical \nand nonphysical investments, will support the state to meet its objective of improved water \nresources  management  with  milestone  performance  targets. To  achieve  this,  the  state  has \nproposed  an  ambitious  budget  allocation  of  about  $8.5  billion  during  FY2014\u2013FY2018  (in \nFY2014, the budgeted allocation is $2.06 billion). The government has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to contribute to the state\u2019s investment program through an MFF, which \nis  well  suited  for  this  investment  as  it  is  the  most  effective  modality  to  \n(i) provide a longer-term lending instrument suited to IWRM process; (ii) afford flexibility in terms \nof project scope, timing, and size, which may be adjusted to meet emerging priorities of the road \nmap; and (iii) provide sufficient time for institutional strengthening in IWRM for key agencies and \nwater users.   \n \n8.  Strategic context, link to government, and ADB strategies. The state\u2019s medium-term \nplan emphasizes greater visibility of agriculture and allied activities to increase rural incomes, \nand achieving a sustainable and orderly process of industrialization and urbanization for poverty \nreduction and sustained human development.12 The state\u2019s water policy of 2002 aims for holistic \n                                                \n6  Government of India, State Government of Karnataka, Cooperation Department. 1959.

The National Water  Mission,  2011;  National Water Policy,  2012;  and the \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012\u20132017 all support the requirement for integrated planning of water \nresources across various users.13  \n9.  The investment program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and \ncountry partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India by reinforcing core areas of operations, like \ninfrastructure development for water resources management, investing in irrigation infrastructure \nto  enhance  value  addition  in  agriculture,  and  developing  measures  to  increase  water  use \nefficiency.14 The investment program is also in accordance with the ADB Water Operational Plan, \n2011\u20132020. 15  It  will  improve  water  governance  by  embedding  IWRM  as  an  adaptive \nmanagement process, including for climate change adaptation; and improve water use efficiency \nto increase availability for competing uses. \n10.  The state has a number of enabling factors to adopt an IWRM approach, including  \n(i)  recognition  of  the  scarcity  of,  and  threats  to,  water  resources;  (ii)  progressive  policy \nstatements; (iii) major investments in water resources infrastructure; (iv) technical capacity; and \n(v) a progressive outlook, as exemplified by semi-independent institutions of the state WRD like \nthe irrigation corporations or nigams, command area development authorities (CADAs), and the \nAdvanced Centre for Integrated Water Resources Management (AC-IWRM).16 \n \n11.  Improvements in urban water management will be addressed under a separate ADB- \nfinanced investment program.17 The two investment programs will be closely coordinated through \nthe AC-IWRM.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the proposed  investment program will  be improved sustainable water \nsecurity  in  selected  river  basins  in  Karnataka.  Its  outcome  will  be  IWRM  successfully \nimplemented in selected river basins in Karnataka. \n   \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The program will produce three main outputs: (i) state and basin institutions strengthened \nfor IWRM, (ii) irrigation system infrastructure and management modernized, and (iii) program \nmanagement systems operational. There will be two key components:  Gondi irrigation canal \nunder project 1,18 and Vijaynagara and Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal (TLBC) under project 2.  \n1.

Investment and Financing Plans  \n18.  The investment program is estimated to cost $225 million (Table 1).  \n \n19.  The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $150 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance a part of the investment program. The MFF will consist \nof two tranches, subject to the government\u2019s submission of related periodic financing requests, \nexecution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms \nand conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement.  \n20.  The first tranche of the MFF will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nan annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms \n                                                \n19  The  Advanced  Centre  for  Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  will  be  accredited  by  United  Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization-Institute for Water Education (UNESCO-IHE) as an institute for \nprofessional training in integrated water resources management. \n20 Irrigation modernization is a process of technical and managerial upgrading (as opposed to mere rehabilitation) of \nirrigation schemes combined with institutional reforms, with the objective to improve resource utilization (labor, \nwater, economic, environmental) and water delivery service to farms (Food and Agriculture Organization. 1999. \nModernization  of  irrigation  system  operations:  proceedings  of  the  5th  ITIS  network  international  meeting. \nAurangabad. 28\u201330 October 1998).

The  program  coordination  committee \nchaired by the principal secretary of the WRD will provide overall program and policy guidance.  \n22.  For project 1, the state\u2014acting through KNNL\u2014will be the executing agency. The PMU \n                                                \n21 The interest includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points. This is based on the above loan terms and the \ngovernment\u2019s choice of repayment options and dates. \n22 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6   \nwill be located within KNNL. The managing director of KNNL will be the program director, and will \nimplement the program under the overall guidance of the state IWRM steering committee and \nthe program coordination committee, with the support of PSCs. The PMU will have day-to-day \nresponsibility for implementing the investment program. A PIO for output 1 will be established \nwithin the AC-IWRM to be responsible for implementation of all IWRM-related activities of output \n1. For output 2, each irrigation subproject to be modernized will have a dedicated PIO that will \ncomprise field staff of KNNL who will be strengthened with specific technical expertise from \nCADAs and PSCs. The PMU working with the PIO and PSCs will monitor overall program \nexecution and will be responsible for monitoring and reporting.  \n23.  Consulting services will provide technical support for program implementation. The three \nmain consulting services packages will be for the (i) PSCs, (ii) IWRM, and (iii) services for \nmonitoring and evaluation (including environmental and effects monitoring). The PSCs will be \ninitially engaged for 4 years under project 1 and another 3 years under project 2.23 Firms will be \nrecruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method.24 The total inputs required for \nPSCs for project 1 will be 230 person-months, including 20 person-months of international and \n210 person-months of national consultants. For IWRM, the AC-IWRM will recruit 27 person-\nmonths of international individual consultants and seven person-months of national individual \nconsultants. \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period   October 2014\u2013September 2021 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2021 \nManagement   \n(i)  Oversight body  State IWRM steering committee, chaired by chief secretary \n(ii)  Executing agency  The state acting through KNNL (and other agencies with responsibilities concerning \nwater resources issues) \n(iii)  Key implementing  The Advanced Centre for IWRM will be responsible for the implementation of output 1. \nagencies   KNNL,  other  nigams  (irrigation  corporations),  and  agencies  with  responsibilities \nconcerning water resources issues, including CADAs and WUCSs, will be responsible \nfor implementing all other activities. \n(iv)  Implementation unit   Program Management Unit, Bangalore (8 technical staff)  \nAdvanced Centre for IWRM, Bangalore (6 technical staff) \nProject 1 Implementation Office, Shimoga (10 technical staff) \nProcurement   Gondi civil works for project 1  1 contract  $16.00 million \n(NCB) \nVijaynagara civil works for project 2  1 contract  $64.00 million \n(ICB)  \nTLBC for project 2 civil works (ICB)    1 contract  $85.00 million \nInstallation of telemetry (ICB)   1 contract  $3.50 million \nConsulting services  PSC (QCBS)  230 person-months  $3.70 million \n(20 international and \n210 national) \nIWRM consultants  34 person-months   $0.80 million \n(individual)  (27 international and \n7 national) \n \nEnvironmental monitoring (QCBS)   Lump sum contract  $0.48 million \nEffects monitoring (QCBS)  Lump sum contract  $0.18 million \nRetroactive financing  ADB  may,  subject  to  its  policies  and  procedures,  allow  upon  request  advance \nand/or advance  contracting of  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  and  consulting  services.

For  monitoring  and  evaluation,  two  separate  consulting  services  will  be  required: \n(i) environmental monitoring, and (ii) baseline and effects monitoring surveys at midterm and \nprogram completion. A baseline study will be undertaken in November 2014. \n25.  All procurement of works and equipment will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), while recruitment of consultants \nand other services will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).25  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n26.  The  investment  program  will  contribute  to  holistic  water  resources  management  in \nselected subbasins by implementing IWRM principles. The quantifiable benefits will be irrigation \nsystem modernization and improved farm practices, which will result in water savings that may \nbe  productively  utilized  within  the  subbasin  by  other  users.  Improved  irrigation  water  use \nefficiency  will  potentially  benefit  about  1.5  million  people,  and  will  result  in  an  additional \n1,700 million m\u00b3 of water that can be saved and used irrigating an additional 160,000 ha). \nFarmers\u2019 incomes will also increase from incremental crop production by $1,054 for marginal \nhouseholds and $3,911 for small households.26  \n \nA.  Technical \n27.  The program will contribute to improved water resources management by introducing \nautomatic flow measurement and telemetry within the K-8 sub-basin and on projects 1 and 2 \nirrigation subprojects. System modernization will include installation of gravity pipe distribution \nwithin the command area to improve water use efficiency.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n28.  Economic and financial analyses undertaken for project 1 indicate that the project is \neconomically  viable.  It  provides  benefits  through  increased  agricultural  productivity  and \nhousehold incomes. Improved irrigation service delivery will lead to increased yields of up to 46% \nfor paddy rice and 20% for other crops. The economic internal rate of return for project 1 is \n                                                \n25 Procurement Capacity Assessment and Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB.  2013.  Economic  and  Financial  Analysis  for  Karnataka  Integrated  and  Sustainable  Water  Resources \nManagement Investment Program (TA 7954-IND). Consultant\u2019s report. Manila. A marginal household is defined as \nholding up to 1 ha of land, while a small household holds 1 ha\u20132 ha (Bimal Misri. 1999. Country Pasture/Forage \nResource Profiles. India). \n ", "8   \nestimated  at  17%.  The  sensitivity  tests  and  risk  analysis  confirm  that  project  1  is  robust. \nHowever,  incremental  benefits  to  the  project  are  sensitive  to  construction  delays.  Benefit \ndistribution analyses confirm that a substantial proportion of the total project benefits will be \nshared by farmers and the poor.27  \n \n29.  The WUCSs and KNNL will continue to maintain systems through WUCS contributions \nand  state  budget  support.  KNNL  and  the  AC-IWRM  are  not  directly  responsible  for  loan \nrepayment, which will be from the state. Overall, the state shows good fiscal health with a GSDP \nfor FY2012 of over $97.1 billion, and a declining trend in fiscal deficit from 3.24% in FY2010 to \n2.92% in FY2012. The repayment of $150 million is not considered to pose a serious debt \nburden on the state. \n  \nC.  Governance \n30.  Financial management assessments carried out for KNNL and the AC-IWRM confirm the \nabsence of substantive financial management and procurement risks. Although neither agency \nhas experience with implementing externally financed development projects, the risk for each \nagency is considered minimal. This is because KNNL has extensive experience in financial \nmanagement, procurement, and implementation of large irrigation projects in accordance with \nthe  statutory  requirements  of  the  state  and  India.  The  AC-IWRM,  though  it  is  a  recently \nestablished organization, has suitably qualified and experienced staff and is already operational \nand managing a sizeable budget for operations. Both KNNL and the AC-IWRM will be supported \nby the state, which has extensive experience in water resources-related and externally financed \nprojects. \n31.  The investment program has established clear input and output targets to facilitate good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency.  Procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services \nfinanced by ADB will be in accordance with its Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government and the executing agency.  The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual.   Financial \nmanagement capacity within KNNL and the AC-IWRM will be strengthened by (i) providing \ncapacity  building  on  ADB  disbursement,  financial,  and  project  management  guidelines;  (ii) \nassigning existing staff in KNNL at several levels (state, chief accounts officer, and zonal levels) \nwith additional responsibility for financial management of the project; (iii) introducing mandatory \ne-procurement  for  all  contracts  valued  at  more  than  $4,000,  subject  to  assessment  and \nclearance of the systems used for electronic bidding by ADB;28 (iv) ensuring civil works contracts \ninclude a condition that contractors adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate); and (v) reporting on project activities and implementation on the KNNL and program \nwebsites to foster transparency and timely awarding of contracts. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  Assessments have been completed for project 1 subprojects to prepare strategies for \npoverty reduction and social development impact.29 The project interventions will (i) strengthen \nWUCSs for improved water use efficiency on irrigation systems and collective actions to increase \nagricultural productivity; (ii) improve irrigation infrastructure and practice for equitable access to \nwater by small, marginal, and landless farmers; (iii) improve annual farm incomes by over 50% \nfrom $693 to $1,053 for marginal households; (iv) introduce sustainable and innovative irrigation \n                                                \n27 Detailed Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 e-GP System Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "  9 \nand agricultural practices, like drip irrigation; and (v) facilitate social inclusion.  \n33.  Women will benefit from (i) capacity building in IWRM; (ii) capacity building in water \ngovernance  by  participating  in  WUCSs;  (iii)  skills  training  in  improved  land  and  water \nmanagement;  (iv)  participation  in  infrastructure  development;  and  (v)  overall  benefits  from \nincreased agricultural production.30 Specific activities will include (i) professional training of about  \n200 women in IWRM; (ii) at least 30% representation of women from the current 20% in 2014 in \nWUCS  management  boards;  and  (iii)  gender-specific  capacity  building  for  women  in  water \nmanagement and WUCS participation. The PSCs will include a social development and gender \nspecialist for 24 person-months and each PIO will include one female community organizer. \nTranche 1 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n34.  Environment. Project 1 is categorized B for environment in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). It comprises canal modernization for the Gondi medium \nirrigation subproject and installation of flow measurement devices within the subbasin. An initial \nenvironmental examination has been prepared for project 1.31 An environmental assessment and \nreview framework has also been developed for the MFF to guide subsequent subprojects and \ndevelopment interventions.32 Consultations were undertaken with affected stakeholders, and the \nexisting grievance redress mechanism of the state will be adopted. \n35.  Involuntary resettlement. Project 1 is categorized C for involuntary resettlement. This is \nbecause the project involves modernization of an existing canal system within the existing right-\nof-way,  and  the WRD  already  owns  the  right-of-way  of  5  meters  alongside  the  canals  for \nfacilitating maintenance works and for access. No land acquisition or other losses will result in \ninvoluntary resettlement under project 1. A resettlement framework has been prepared for the \nentire  MFF  pursuant  to  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  it  will  be  followed  for  the \nsubsequent projects.33  \n36.  Indigenous peoples. Project 1 is categorized C for the indigenous peoples safeguard. \nThere are no indigenous peoples, as defined by the Safeguard Policy Statement, in any of the \nareas of project 1 or subsequent projects under the investment program. As subsequent projects \nwould also be categorized C, an indigenous peoples planning framework has not been prepared.  \n37.  Based on preliminary investigation, project 2 subprojects are expected to be categorized \nsimilarly  to  project  1  subprojects.  The  resettlement  framework  and  the  environment  and \nassessment review framework are sufficiently comprehensive to consider any subprojects that \nmay deviate from the anticipated categorization.   \n38.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011), the investment program \ncommunication  strategy  sets  out  the  KNNL  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  requirements  for \n(i) types of information to be disclosed; (ii) mechanisms for notice, including language and timing; \nand  (iii) implementation  and  monitoring  responsibilities  for  information  disclosure  and \ndissemination.  \n \n                                                \n30 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nF.
