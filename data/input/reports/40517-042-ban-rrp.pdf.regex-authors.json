THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) proposed \nsupplementary  grant;  and  (ii)  the  proposed  administration  of  a  supplementary  grant  to  be \nprovided by the Asian Clean Energy Fund1 under the Clean Energy Partnership Facility, to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility \n(PPIDF).2 \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n2.  On 2 October 2008, the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved  two  loans  (one  of  $82  million  from  ordinary  capital  resources  and  the  other  of \nSDR52,870,000 from special fund resources) to Bangladesh for the PPIDF Project. \n \n3.  The project is helping to address infrastructure deficiencies in Bangladesh, and thereby \npromote economic growth and poverty reduction, by providing long-term debt financing and \ncatalyzing private sector participation through Infrastructure Development Company Limited \n(IDCOL). It is divided into three main components, with each one having different target groups \nand objectives.  \n \n(i)  Component A uses $82 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to provide \ndollar financing to the government for relending to IDCOL to finance large private \nsector-sponsored infrastructure subprojects of at least $30 million.  \n(ii)  Component B provides Asian Development Fund (ADF) funding of $50 million \nequivalent to the government for relending in local currency to IDCOL to finance \nsmall and medium-sized infrastructure subprojects primarily located in rural and \nsemi-urban areas, especially in the energy sector.  \n(iii)  Component  C  provides  ADF  funding  of  $33  million  equivalent  for  IDCOL\u2019s \nongoing renewable energy program. One of the main objectives of this program \nis  to  help  provide  the  rural  population  in  off-grid  areas  with  access  to \nenvironment-friendly electricity by financing renewable energy systems (RESs), \nsuch as solar home systems (SHSs), biomass and biogas installations, through a \nmicrofinance-based, direct sales program. \n \nB.  Status of Project Implementation \n \n4.  As of April 2011, there have been no disbursements under component A. However, a \nnumber of projects are expected to reach financial closure within the next few months. IDCOL is \ncurrently  reviewing  the  financing  of  3  independent  power  plants 3  recently  awarded  by \nBangladesh Power Development Board. In addition, 12 projects totaling 2,295 megawatts (MW) \nare in the pipeline. \n \n                                                \n1  Established by the Government of Japan. \n2  The revised design and monitoring framework is in the Appendix. \n3  Summit Group, the largest power conglomerate in Bangladesh, has recently been awarded the right to develop 3 \nlarge independent power plants: (i) the 2 Bibiyana gas-fired combined cycle power plants of 341 MW each for \nphases 1 and 2, and (ii) the Meghnaghat 335 MW dual fuel-combined cycle power plant. In addition, the Ranhill-\nSTS-Consortium from Malaysia has won the bid to build the Bhola 225 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant. ", "2   \n5.  Under component B, ADB has made one disbursement of $5 million in April 2010 to \nIDCOL for providing a term loan facility of Tk350 million to an information technology company \nfor the establishment and operation of a nationwide wireless broadband network. Another local \ncurrency  loan  of  Tk200  million  from  IDCOL  to  a  company  that  operates  a  nationwide \ntelecommunication transmission network using fiber optic technology has been approved by \nIDCOL\u2019s board and will soon be disbursed. IDCOL\u2019s current project pipeline for component B \nconsists of several small to medium-sized, primarily gas-fired power plants. In addition, IDCOL\u2019s \nboard has approved 3 projects that will set up solar photovoltaic module assembly facilities with \na capacity ranging from 5 MW to 10 MW each. \n \n6.  Progress  in  implementing  component  C  to  finance  access  to  environment-friendly \nelectricity in off-grid areas has been successful. As of April 2011, 97% or $32 million of the total \navailable ADF funds of $33 million have been disbursed to finance 104,273 SHSs. It is expected \nthat the unutilized amount will be disbursed in the next few months for further financing of SHSs.  \n \nIII.  IDCOL\u2019S RENEWABLE ENERGY PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n7.  Lack of access to reliable electricity has been one of the most severe constraints to \neconomic growth and improved livelihoods in Bangladesh. Although 75% of the population lives \nin rural areas, only about 30% of rural households have access to grid electricity. The current \nelectrification rate is about 400,000 households a year and, at such a rate, it would take more \nthan 40 years to reach all households. Against this backdrop, the power sector has been \nprioritized by the government to provide universal electricity access by 2020. \n \n8.  Given  the  slow  pace  of  grid  extension,  the  government  strategy  emphasizes  the \npromotion of off-grid renewable energy technologies in rural areas as a priority. Thus, off-grid \nelectrification  based  on  RESs  is  the  only  readily  available  and  cost-effective  electricity \napplications for millions of people in areas without access to a conventional energy supply. \nSuch applications are wide-ranging, including SHSs, biomass, micro-wind power systems in \ncoastal areas, and mini-hydro projects in the mountainous regions. \n \n9.  Promotion of renewable energy is also preferred from the viewpoint of providing clean \nenergy  technologies,  since  most  of  the  power  generation  in  Bangladesh  for  lighting  and \npumping water for irrigation uses kerosene and diesel. About 75% of the population also relies \non biomass, such as rice straw, dried leaves, jute sticks, cow dung, or wood, for cooking and \nheating. These sources of energy cause high CO  emissions and are an inefficient use of \n2\nresources. Introduction of efficient renewable energy can thus have a positive impact on the \nenvironment by reducing CO  emissions and preventing deforestation. To accelerate the use of \n2\nthese energy applications, the government decided to mandate IDCOL with the financing of \nSHS installations and other renewable energy applications in off-grid areas. \n \nB.  Overview of IDCOL\u2019s Renewable Energy Program \n \n10.  IDCOL\u2019s renewable energy program provides refinancing, sets technical specifications \nfor equipment, develops publicity materials, extends loans, installs the systems, monitors their \nperformance, and provides maintenance support. In particular, IDCOL provides: \n ", "  3 \n(i)  loans at 6%\u20138% (per annum) to participating organizations,4 which then provide \ncustomers in rural areas with financing of up to 80% of the cost of an SHS5 with a \ncapacity of 10\u2013130 watts;6  \n(ii)  loans to companies for biomass installations in rural or semi-urban areas, and \nfinancing for commercial and semi-commercial biogas plants or biogas-based \nelectricity plants; and \n(iii)  loans and grants for solar irrigation pumps.  \n \n11.  Funds used by IDCOL for refinancing stem exclusively from donor loans channeled \nthrough the government. IDCOL\u2019s main responsibility is, therefore, to raise and channel funding \nin the form of loans to participating organizations and to monitor the overall performance of its \nrenewable  energy  program.  Participating  organizations,  in  a  second  step,  will  then  select \nsubproject  areas  and  potential  customers,  extend  loans,  install  the  systems,  monitor  their \nperformance, and provide maintenance support.  \n \n12.  In  addition  to  the  refinancing  arrangement,  donors  devised  a  grant  scheme7 to \nincentivize  IDCOL  and  its  participating  organizations  to  increase  the  affordability  of  these \nrenewable energy applications to buyers in rural off-grid areas, where the poorer section of the \npopulation normally lives. The prices of SHSs depend not only on the institutional capacity of \nIDCOL and its participating organizations in operating cost-efficiently but also on world prices for \nthe various system components that are subject to demand and supply. Thus, the grant scheme \nwill shelter end-users from some of the price fluctuations as well as accelerate use of the \nprogram.   \n \nC.  Status of IDCOL\u2019s Solar Energy Program \n \n13.  Since IDCOL first started to finance SHSs in collaboration with the World Bank in 2002, \nthe initial target of financing 50,000 SHSs was achieved in August 2005, 3 years ahead of the \ntarget  date  and  $2  million  below  estimated  costs.  In  view  of  this  successful  program \nimplementation, IDCOL raised its target to finance 1,000,000 SHSs by 2012. As of October \n2010, a total of 702,574 SHSs have been installed and the current installation rate is roughly \n                                                \n4  IDCOL\u2019s renewable energy program is innovative because it is implemented through participating organizations, \nwhich  are  nongovernment  organizations,  microfinance  institutions,  and  private  entities.  These  participating \norganizations  select  project  areas  and  potential  customers,  extend  loans,  install  the  systems,  and  provide \nmaintenance support. Through this scheme, IDCOL can take advantage of participating organizations\u2019 grassroots \nnetworks, which are vital for introducing efficient technology to underdeveloped rural areas and encouraging \ncommunity participation. \n5  SHSs are small photovoltaic systems with a peak capacity of between 10 watts and 130 watts and comprise a \nsolar panel, battery, charge controller, wires, and loads. The estimated technical lifetime of a solar panel for a SHS \nis about 20 years, 5\u20137 years for a battery, and 3 years for a charge controller. Maintenance and after-sales service \nare provided free of charge within the first 3 years of purchase. During this time, the systems are regularly checked \nby participating organization staff while collecting the monthly installments. After the 3-year payback period, \nmaintenance is provided by the participating organizations for a minimal monthly fee. As SHS users are owners of \ntheir systems, motivation to keep the system running will be high. As there are no further monthly installments after \nthe payback period, the payment of a small monthly service fee as well as the replacement of the battery every 5 \nyears will not be a major financial obstacle. \n6  SHS are used mainly by low- and middle-class households, and micro- and small enterprises in off-grid rural \nlocations to operate light bulbs, small electrical appliances like mobile chargers, and black and white television \nsets. Households, and micro- and small enterprises buy SHSs either by cash or credit, but they are required to pay \na minimum 10% of the cost as a down payment. The price of a typical 50-watt SHS is about $400. \n7  The grant scheme consists of (i) a buy-down grant to reduce the consumer price of the SHS, (ii) a grant to IDCOL \nfor management and monitoring of the use of refinancing loans and grant components, and (iii) an institutional \ndevelopment fund available to the participating organizations to widen their outreach capacities in rural areas. \n ", "4   \n30,000 SHSs per month. At this pace, it is expected that the target will be achieved by August \n2011. Therefore, IDCOL has recently revised its target to 2.5 million SHSs by 2014. \n \n14.  As  of  September  2010,  additional  funding  from  the World  Bank  and  other  donors, \nincluding ADB and the Islamic Development Bank, to IDCOL\u2019s solar energy program amounted \nto approximately $170 million. In addition, the Global Environment Facility, Global Partnership \non Output-Based Aid, and German development cooperation through GIZ and KfW pledged \ngrants worth $45.5 million.  \n \nD.  Status of IDCOL\u2019s Financing of Other Renewable Energy Applications \n \n15.  Beyond the financing of SHSs, IDCOL finances other renewable energy applications \nsuch as biogas, biomass, solar, and wind energy installations. IDCOL finances up to 80% of \ntotal costs of renewable energy subprojects by providing a combination of debt and grant \nfinancing. A financial analysis for each subproject determines the necessary grant and loan \nelements, with grant financing constituting a maximum of 50% of total subproject costs for solar \nmini-grid projects and 40% for solar irrigation projects. With regard to biomass and biogas-\nbased power plants, one 250 kilowatt (kW) project is already in operation, while one biomass-\nbased power plant with a capacity of 400 kW and one biogas-based power plant of 50 kW are \nunder construction. One additional 350 kW biogas-based power plant has been approved by \nIDCOL\u2019s board and will start construction soon. In addition, an 11.2 kW solar irrigation pump is \nin operation and an 8.4 kW solar irrigation pump will be constructed shortly. Finally, IDCOL has \ngiven preliminary approval for the financing of 17 solar irrigation pump projects. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY GRANTS \n \nA.  Proposed Changes \n \n16.  The proposed changes relate to the grant funding for component C of the project, which \nfinances RESs. ADB originally intended to apply for grant financing from the Asian Clean \nEnergy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and from the Climate \nChange Fund in parallel with the processing of the project. However, the application process for \nfunding from these 2 sources was not completed by the time the project was approved by ADB\u2019s \nBoard  on  2 October  2008.  As  a  consequence, the grant financing  is  being  processed  as \nsupplementary grants for the project. The proposed allocation of $3.3 million to the project will \nbe funded as follows: \n \n(i)  Grant cofinancing equivalent to $2,000,000 will be provided by the Asian Clean \nEnergy  Fund8 under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  and \nadministered by ADB.  \n(ii)  A grant of $1,300,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be provided by \nthe Climate Change Fund (CCF).9  \n \n17.  The total grant amounts will be divided into two parts to pursue distinct objectives, apply \nspecific lending modalities, and target different beneficiary groups. Part 1 will use the $2 million \nallocation  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  to  enable  participating \norganizations (through IDCOL) to provide buy-down grants and institutional development grants \nfor individual SHSs of at least 10 watts. The buy-down grant for each SHS will be $2510 and will \n                                                \n8  Established by the Government of Japan. \n9  Established by ADB.  \n10 The proposed $25 grant provided by part 1 is in line with those provided by some of the other donors.  ", "  5 \nbe limited to one such grant per household. Funds may be disbursed to the participating \norganizations  by  IDCOL  after  sufficient  verification  in  accordance  with  the  procedures \nestablished under component C of the project. This will enable at least 80,000 low- and middle-\nincome households in IDCOL\u2019s solar energy program to benefit from a reduced SHS price. \nWhile loan financing under component C of the project is largely exhausted, the proposed \nsupplementary grants will support loan financing for SHSs provided by other donors.  \n \n18.  Under part 2, IDCOL will use $580,000 of the allocation of $1.3 million under the CCF to \noffer grants under its direct financing activities to some of its medium-scale subprojects using \nrenewable energy applications such as biomass, biogas, and wind energy installations in rural \nareas with no access to grid electricity. Up to 50% of the total cost of an individual subproject \ncan  be  financed  with  a  grant  from  part  2.  As  was  the  case  with  the  implementation \narrangements  under  component  B  of  the  project,  the  first  3  subprojects  to  receive  grant \nfinancing under part 2 will be submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to disbursement by \nIDCOL, unless otherwise agreed between ADB and IDCOL. \n \n19.  The remaining amount under the CCF will be provided to IDCOL to pay for the following \nexpenses related to the administration and monitoring of its renewable energy program under \npart 1:  \n \n(i)  $357,000  as  the  program  support  administration  cost  of  IDCOL  for  the \nmanagement and monitoring on the use of the grant component\u2014this amount is \nbased on an administration cost of $4.46 per SHS11 installed.12 \n(ii)  $233,000 as an institutional development fund for the training of participating \norganization staff and their customers to widen their outreach capacities in rural \nareas. Because of the expanding network of supply and maintenance outlets, \nmaintenance,  services,  and  spare  parts  are  available  within  a  reasonable \ndistance from the SHS customers. Currently, the typical radius for each outlet is \naround 10 kilometers. \n(iii)  $30,000 for technical inspections.13 \n(iv)  $60,000 for annual technical audits14 to be carried out by an audit firm for 2 \nconsecutive years. \n(v)  $40,000 for appointing independent engineers15 to conduct feasibility studies, \nand appraise and monitor renewable energy projects. \n \n                                                \n11 The proposed administration cost per SHS unit of $4.46 reflects a reduction of 50% from IDCOL\u2019s current rate as a \nresult of economies of scale achieved by the increased installation rates. \n12 The low interest margins that IDCOL earns in its renewable energy program are not sufficient for the company to \ncover expenses related to the administration and monitoring of its renewable energy program, such as: (i) \noverhead costs; (ii) salaries and allowances for IDCOL officials dedicated to the program and for its inspectors, \nwhich are not included with technical inspection-related expenses; (iii) financial audits; (iv) committee meeting \nexpenses; (v) promotional and logistical support; and (vi) printing and stationery. \n13 Technical inspection is the physical verification of SHS by technical inspectors recruited as employees by IDCOL \nfor this specific purpose. Their responsibility is to conduct inspections of all SHSs installed under the program. \n14 Technical audits are conducted by a third party appointed by IDCOL on a competitive basis. Usually, IDCOL \nconducts technical audits once a year. Auditors conduct a detailed technical analysis of the performance of \ndifferent SHS components (panel, battery, charge controller, cable, and lamp) including laboratory testing of those \nitems on a random sample basis. They collect samples from the field, factory of the manufacturer, and also from \nthe participating organizations\u2019 stock. \n15 Independent engineers are engaged on a competitive basis to conduct feasibility studies, appraise the conceptual \nand technical design, monitor construction, and/or monitor operational performance of renewable energy projects \n(other than the solar program). \n ", "6   \n20.  The  proposed  cost  estimates  for  the  additional  SHSs  and  related  activities  are \nsummarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Proposed Cost Estimates \n($) \n  Cost/       \nCost Item  Unit  Unit  Total Costa   Total Costb \nBuy-down grants to individual households for the         \npurchase of SHSs (through participating       \norganizations) (part 1)  25.00   80,000  2,000,000 \nDirect grants to subprojects, financed by IDCOL,         \nusing renewable energy technologies (part 2)  580,000 \nProgram support administration cost for IDCOL   4.46   80,000    357,000  \nParticipating organization staff and customer training        233,000  \nTechnical inspections        30,000 \nTechnical audits carried out by an audit firm        60,000 \nIndependent engineers\u2019 costs        40,000 \n    Total      2,000,000  1,300,000 \nIDCOL = Infrastructure Development Company Limited.  \na  Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, established by the Government \nof Japan, and administered by the Asian Development Bank. \nb  Climate Change Fund, established by the Asian Development Bank. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSources: Infrastructure Development Company Limited data and estimates. \n \nB.  Rationale for Supplementary Grants \n \n21.  The main rationale for the proposed supplementary grants is to increase the financing \navailable to the rural poor for the purchase of an SHS which is in line with the provision of grant \nmoney already done by other donors. The funds will subsidize SHSs and other renewable \nenergy applications in order to make them more affordable to end-users, thereby guaranteeing \nincreased  SHS  installation  rates  and  the  successful  implementation  of  alternative  energy \ngeneration  in  off-grid  areas.  This  will  assist  the  government  in  implementing  its  vision  of \nuniversal electricity access by 2020.  \n \n22.  The  additional  activities  under  component  C  are  consistent  with  (i)  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy and program update 2006\u20132010 for Bangladesh,16 which highlights rural electrification \nas one of the key development challenges; (ii) the original development objectives; and (iii) the \nproject\u2019s  impact,  outcomes,  and  development  effectiveness  as  well  as  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework in the Appendix. Furthermore, the renewable energy program component \ndemonstrates  satisfactory  implementation  and  is  likely  to  achieve  the  stated  development \nobjectives as highlighted in sections III C and III D on the status of IDCOL\u2019s renewable energy \nprograms. \n \nC.  Impact on the Project \n \n23.  The supplementary grants will (i) provide under part 1 further support for this highly \nsuccessful  intervention  in  the  absence  of  sufficient  grant  funding  sources  to  achieve  the \ntargeted 2.5 million SHSs by 2014; (ii) promote clean energy technologies, which will lead to a \nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions; and (iii) contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable \ndevelopment. \n \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2005, Bangladesh: Country Strategy and Program Update, 2006\u20132010. Manila. ", "  7 \n24.  With respect to the provision of grants for the purchase of SHSs under part 1, the \nproposed changes will improve the access of low-income households to clean energy. The \nextreme  poor  will  benefit  mostly  since  they  are  otherwise  deprived  of  access  to  reliable \nelectricity. In the long term, a self-sustaining market for SHSs will be created in Bangladesh, \nwhich will: \n \n(i)  replace fossil fuel (kerosene) lamps through modern electricity from renewable \nsources;  \n(ii)  provide better lighting for school children as they study in the evening;  \n(iii)  provide more security for household members, especially women and children;  \n(iv)  help save money that is being spent on kerosene or candles; \n(v)  help save time needed for purchasing kerosene; and \n(vi)  improve indoor air quality and health by avoiding the burning of kerosene. \n \n25.  IDCOL\u2019s high installation rates of SHSs and other renewable energy applications will \nhelp contribute to reduced carbon emissions. IDCOL estimates that each SHS saves at least \n$61.8 worth of kerosene each year, and reduces 345 kilograms of CO  emission annually as a \n2\nresult. Therefore, the 80,000 new SHSs to be installed through the proposed changes will bring \na reduction of about 27,600 tons of CO  emissions a year. IDCOL is currently assessing the \n2\ncarbon emission reductions achieved by RESs other than SHSs. \n \n26.  The proposed supplementary grants will facilitate additional financing of SHSs by IDCOL \nthrough the provision of 80,000 grants, thereby increasing the number of SHSs to be financed \nunder the project from the current 104,273 SHSs to at least 180,000 SHSs. As a result, IDCOL \nis more likely to meet its objective of financing 2.5 million SHSs by 2014.  \n \n27.  Currently, the overall funding available to IDCOL is sufficient to provide financing for \n772,321 SHSs. In light of the current installation rates, existing funding is expected to be \ndepleted in the second quarter of 2011 and the available ADB financing under component C is \nequally expected to be fully utilized by 2011. More specifically on loan financing, IDCOL faces a \nfunding gap of roughly $408 million for the financing of approximately 1,825,000 SHSs to reach \nits goal of financing 2.5 million SHSs by 2014.  \n \n28.  Without ADB\u2019s proposed grant financing under part 1, part of IDCOL\u2019s SHS program \nmay be financed without the grant element, which could cause the price of an SHS to become \nunaffordable to a large section of society, thereby leading to declining demand from customers. \nIn addition, customers would have to bear administration support costs, given that these are \ngenerally  covered  by  grant  funding.  According  to  IDCOL\u2019s  estimates,  this  could  lead  to \nsignificantly  lower  installation  rates  and  a  customer  base  that  will  consist  primarily  of  the \nrelatively better-off residents in rural and urban areas. In this scenario, IDCOL may miss its \ntarget of installing 2.5 million SHSs by 2014. Thus, the proposed supplementary funding will \nhelp maintain the current high installation rate and assist IDCOL in achieving its target, while \nretaining a more inclusive customer base for SHS installations. \n \n29.  IDCOL has in its pipeline projects for other renewable energy applications, but is also \nshort of funding for these projects. ADB has allocated about $3 million under component C and \nthe International Development Agency has pledged loan financing of $6 million, while the Global \nEnvironment  Facility,  Global  Partnership  on  Output-Based  Aid,  and  German  development \ncooperation through KfW have contributed a total of $3.1 million in grant funding. Assuming the \nproposed ADB grant financing is approved under part 2, IDCOL estimates that its shortfall for \ngrant financing will still be about $9.6 million and for loan financing, it will be $12 million.  \n ", "8   \nD.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n \n30.  Environmental safeguards. The proposed project is classified as category FI. As part \nof ADB\u2019s earlier assistance under the original loan, IDCOL has established an environmental \nand social safeguards framework that will be updated to reflect the changes in connection with \nthis additional grant funding and ongoing ADB-financed capacity building efforts for the benefit \nof IDCOL\u2019s Environmental and Social Safeguards Management Unit. Given the small size and \nretail character of an SHS installation, no adverse environmental impacts are expected through \nthese supplementary grants. The only potential negative environmental impact of the SHS \ndissemination program could originate from battery-related waste problems. To limit negative \neffects on the natural environment, IDCOL requires all participating organizations to ensure that, \nwhen batteries reach the end of their lifetime (typically 5\u20137 years), they are  collected from rural \ncustomers and returned to the battery manufacturer for recycling purposes. To assure complete \ncollection of old batteries, most participating organizations offer small amounts of money for the \nreturn of used batteries to their respective offices. IDCOL requires all battery manufacturers to \nhave  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  14001  certified  battery  recycling \nfacilities. All battery manufacturers are in the process of obtaining ISO 14001 certificates in \n2011. \n \n31.  Social safeguards. The proposed supplementary grants are classified as category C. \nNo involuntary resettlement or any impact on indigenous peoples is expected as a result of this \nfinancing. The environmental and social safeguards framework under the original loan will \nremain in place with respect to any social safeguard concerns resulting from this additional \ngrant funding. \n \nE.  Revised Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n32.  The cost estimates for the installation of SHSs have not changed and remain dependent \non market prices and the institutional capacity of IDCOL and participating organizations to \nreduce their operational costs.  \n \n33.  The original financing plan will be marginally changed since the proposed supplementary \ngrants  will  only  impact component  C  of  PPIDF  which  will  provide  financing for renewable \nsubprojects. The project will complement the grant funding sources available to IDCOL for its \nrenewable energy program and will, therefore, have a positive effect on component C. The \nrevised financing plan is provided in Table 2.   \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million)\n \nOriginal  Supplementary  % of \nSource  Financing  Financing  Total  Total \nAsian Development Bank (OCR)  82.0  0.0  82.0  8.8 \nPrivate Sector Sponsors and Banks (large subprojects)  328.0  0.0  328.0  35.3 \nAsian Development Bank (ADF)  83.0  0.0  83.0  8.9 \nPrivate Sector Sponsors and Banks (SMIPs and renewable energy)  332.0  0.0  332.0  35.8 \nSupplementary grant financing for renewable energya  0.0  3.3  3.3  0.4 \nIslamic Development Bank   100.0  0.0  100.0  10.8 \nTotal  925.0  3.3  928.3  100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources, SMIP = small and medium-sized infrastructure subproject. \na  The supplementary grants are jointly financed by (i) the Asian Clean Energy Fund Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility, established by the Government of Japan and administered by the Asian Development Bank; and (ii) the Climate \nChange Fund, established by the Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Government of Bangladesh and Asian Development Bank estimates. ", "  9 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n34.  Implementation arrangements for the project under the proposed supplementary grants, \nincluding project management; application of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate);  disbursement  arrangements;  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting;  and  project  review \nremain the same as those for the original loan. In addition, two imprest accounts will be opened \nto administer the disbursements of the Asian Clean Energy Fund and CCF grants. \n \nG.  Procurement \n35.  For the provision of buy-down grants of $25 to end-users for the purchase of individual \nSHSs  and  for  the  provision  of  grants  by  IDCOL  to  subprojects  using  renewable  energy \napplications such as biomass, biogas, and wind, IDCOL will require participating organizations \nto procure goods and works in compliance with established commercial practices that are \nacceptable to ADB. IDCOL and the participating organizations will (i) procure goods and works \nby adopting international competitive bidding procedures for the purchase of large single items \nor for bulk purchasing in cases where large quantities of like goods can be grouped together; \nand (ii) ensure that goods and works are purchased at a reasonable price, with account being \ntaken also of other relevant factors such as time of delivery, efficiency and reliability of the \ngoods, and their suitability for the activities of the participating organizations.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n36.  The project benefits, impacts, assumptions, and risks remain the same as those stated \nin the original report and recommendation of the President.17 Project implementation period will \nnot be extended.  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n37.  Assurances provided by the government in the original loans shall be applied to the \nextent they are applicable to the proposed project.  \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.
