THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan from the Asian Development Fund resources (A loan) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB); and (ii) a proposed loan funded through the participation of the ASEAN Infrastructure \nFund (AIF) (B loan), both to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, for the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  (EWEC)  Eindu  to  Kawkareik  Road \nImprovement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project is located in Myanmar\u2019s Kayin State, which borders Thailand. The state is \nisolated and has been affected by sectarian conflict since 1949. As a consequence, poverty \nlevels are high, and social and economic infrastructure is rudimentary and in poor condition \nwhere it exists. Despite these factors, the state is traversed by Myanmar\u2019s principal road link to \nThailand, along which about 30% of the country\u2019s land-based trade passes. This road link is part \nof the GMS EWEC, which is intended to connect Da Nang in Viet Nam with Mawlamyine and \nYangon in Myanmar, through the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand. The GMS \nEWEC road sections have been completed in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam; the Myanmar sections need to be completed and improved. The project is \naligned  with  the  development  agenda  of  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which \nsupports inclusive economic growth and regional cooperation and integration.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Myanmar suffers from a lack of good quality transport connections nationally and with \nneighboring countries, which has constrained its economic growth and integration within Asia. \nAfter five decades of isolation, it is essential that regional connectivity is improved to stimulate \nand sustain economic development, and to normalize cross-border flow of goods and people. \nImprovement of the GMS EWEC within Myanmar will dramatically improve connectivity, reduce \ntravel times, and support economic development within the corridor and beyond, lifting many in \nthis poor state of Myanmar out of poverty. The project will (i) improve road access to and within \nKayin State; (ii) facilitate trade between Myanmar and Thailand, and beyond to the wider GMS \nregion; and (iii) support the peace process and demonstrate the government\u2019s commitment to \nimproving the well-being of people in areas that have long been affected by conflict. Detailed \nconsultations were carried out during project preparation, and a comprehensive communication \nstrategy has been prepared for the project to ensure continued and meaningful dialogue with all \nstakeholders during project implementation. The GMS EWEC within Myanmar is a priority of the \ngovernment, as highlighted in the national transport master plan.3 \n \n4.  The project will improve the central 66.4-kilometer (km) section of the GMS EWEC within \nMyanmar,  between  the  towns  of  Eindu  and  Kawkareik.  The  section  to  the  east,  between \nKawkareik and Myawaddy, on the border with Thailand, is being improved with assistance from \nthe Government of Thailand. The section to the west, between Eindu and the main Yangon\u2013\nMawlamyine  highway,  is  being  improved  through  a  government-managed  build\u2013operate\u2013\ntransfer concession operated by a Myanmar private company. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n3  Government of Myanmar. 2015. National Transport Master Plan. Nay Pyi Taw. ", "2 \n \n5.  The project road will be improved to the GMS road network standard of two lanes with \nappropriate width paved shoulders, suitable for all standard highway traffic. The section will \nrequire complete reconstruction, with some short sections of realignment for improved vehicle \noperating speed and road safety. The project also includes design features for climate resilience \nin this flood-prone area, including raising the road to a level that takes into account potentially \nhigher future flood levels to provide year-round access. \n \n6.  The  project  fully  supports  the  strategic  thrusts  of  the  interim  country  partnership \nstrategy.4 It also supports the findings of the Myanmar Transport Sector Initial Assessment.5 \nThe project forms one of a series of assistance programs and projects provided by ADB in \nKayin State across several sectors. The focused approach to providing assistance in the state \nwill allow greater familiarity with ADB by the government, as well as benefits from cross-sector \nimprovements to end users and beneficiaries. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact will be improved trade between Myanmar and Thailand. The outcome will be \nimproved connectivity within Kayin State and with Thailand. \n \nC.  Output \n \n8.  The project output will be the improvement of 66.4 km of road between Eindu and \nKawkareik. The completed road\u2019s main alignment will have two traffic lanes, each 3.5 meters \n(m)  wide  and  with  1.5  m-wide  paved  shoulder.  As  part  of  the  project  road  section,  an \napproximately 0.67 km-long access road to Kyon Doe river port will also be reconstructed to \nfacilitate  transport  interchange  between  the  project  road  and  Kayin  State\u2019s  extensive  inland \nwaterway network. The road design speed will be 80 km per hour outside built-up areas, with \nlower operational speeds in built-up areas for safety reasons. In general, the horizontal alignment \nof the road will follow the existing centerline. However, to allow higher traffic speeds and to \nimprove road safety, about 15 km of the alignment will deviate from the existing alignment by up \nto 200 m. The road improvement works will also include 19 new bridges and 78 box culverts to \nimprove drainage and water management, especially in the major flood-prone areas from km 34 \nto km 52. Output activities will include (i) two civil works packages for road improvement; and (ii) \na consulting services package for construction supervision and design check, which will also \ninclude project management and implementation capacity development for government staff. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n9.  The project is estimated to cost $121.8 million (Table 1). \n \n   \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2012.

The following principles were followed in determining the amount of taxes and duties to be \nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB): (i) it is consistent with the interim country partnership \nstrategy, (ii) the amount does not represent an excessive share of the project investment plan, (iii) the taxes \nand duties apply only to ADB and ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF)-financed expenditures, and (iv) the \nfinancing of the taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \nb In January 2015 prices. \nc  The estimated cost includes (i) land acquisition and resettlement ($580,000, including independent monitoring); \nand (ii) environment ($20,000, including replacement tree planting). \nd Costs to be financed include project management unit travel allowances, office operation and maintenance, \nutilities, and consumable supplies. \ne Physical contingencies computed at 10% of base costs. Price contingencies computed for foreign exchange \ncosts and local currency costs based on projected annual rates over the project\u2019s implementation period. The \nprice contingencies include provision for the potential exchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a \npurchasing power parity exchange rate. \nf  Includes A loan and B loan. For the A loan, interest during construction has been computed at 1% per annum. \nFor  the  B  loan,  interest  during  construction  has  been  computed  at  the  5-year  (corresponding  to  the \nimplementation period) US dollar fixed swap rate plus an AIF spread of 1.4%. The commitment charge of \n0.15% per annum on undisbursed balance of the B loan is currently waived subject to annual approval of the \nAIF board of directors, and this waiver is expected to be maintained. The interest charges of both the A loan \nand the B loan will be capitalized. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n10.  The  government  has  requested  (i)  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR71,258,000 ($100.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (A loan), and \n(ii) a loan of $20 million funded through the participation of the AIF (B loan) to help finance the \nproject.6 The A loan will have (i) a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; (ii) an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and \n(iii)  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  A  loan  agreement.  The  ADB-\nadministered B loan of $20.0 million will have (i) a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears;  (ii)  a  straight-line  repayment  method;  (iii)  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate-based lending facility (6-month rate plus \n1.4%); (iv) a commitment charge of 0.15% per year on the undisbursed balance (which is \ncurrently waived on an annual basis by the AIF board of directors, and which is expected to \ncontinue being waived); and (v) such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft B loan \nagreement.  Based  on  these  conditions,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  12.75  years  and  no \n                                                \n6  ADB and AIF financing may finance local transportation and insurance costs. \n ", "4 \nmaturity premium is applicable. The B loan will finance the same output as the A loan on a pro \nrata basis.7 The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \n  Asian Development Fund  100.0  82.1 \nASEAN Infrastructure Fund  20.0  16.4 \nGovernment  1.8  1.5 \nTotal  121.8  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The  project\u2019s  executing  agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Construction  (MOC).  MOC\u2019s \nDepartment of Highways (DOH) will be the implementing agency.8 DOH has established a \nproject management unit (PMU) that will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the \nproject. Assessment undertaken during project preparation of MOC and DOH shows sufficient \ncapacity to implement the project. The PMU, based in Yangon, is headed by a full-time project \ndirector and is staffed with engineering, financial, administrative, and safeguard specialists. The \nPMU will establish an appropriately staffed and resourced office in the project area during \nimplementation. The arrangements mirror those of the recently approved Maubin\u2013Phyapon \nRoad Rehabilitation Project, which has performed well with respect to bidding and safeguard \nrequirements.9 \n \n12.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  project  road  will  be  implemented  through  two  civil  works \ncontracts: (i) one covering the section of the project road from Eindu to Gyaing (Kawkareik) \nBridge (km 0.0\u2013km 40.4), and (ii) one covering the section from Gyaing (Kawkareik) Bridge to \nKawkareik (km 42.2\u2013km 66.5). The existing Gyaing (Kawkareik) Bridge (km 40.4\u2013km 42.2) will \nbe replaced with collaborative parallel funding support from the Government of Japan. The civil \nworks contractors will be responsible for all aspects of their contracts, including coordinating \nlabor, equipment, supplies, and use of materials; achieving specified schedule and quality \nstandards; and complying with social and environmental requirements. All civil works contracts \nfor the ADB- and AIF-financed part of the project will be procured following procedures set out in \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time-to-time),  subject  to  ADB\u2019s \neligibility requirements waiver.10 Universal procurement will be applied. Recent ADB experience \nwith  the  Maubin\u2013Phyapon  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  9)  has  demonstrated \nconsiderable interest by contractors in civil works packages under ADB-supported projects. \n \n13.  The civil works contracts will be supervised by a contract supervision consultant (CSC), \nwho will be the engineer for the contracts as defined in the contract documentation. The CSC \n                                                \n7  The pro rata ratio is decided between the A loan and the B loan amounts, in this case 83.33% from the A loan and \n16.67% from the B loan. \n8  Under a recent reorganization of MOC, the DOH has replaced Public Works as the implementing agency for \nhighway projects. \n9  ADB. 2014.

The CSC will be recruited through quality- and cost-based \nselection.  The  scope  of  the  services  provided  by  the  CSC  will  include  design  review, \nconstruction supervision, and environmental and resettlement monitoring. The Maubin\u2013Phyapon \nRoad Rehabilitation Project demonstrated that there was substantial interest from qualified \nbidders for such works and services. \n \n14.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).11 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  May 2016\u2013September 2019 \nEstimated closing date  31 March 2020 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Ministry of Construction \n(ii) Implementing  Department of Highways, Ministry of Construction \nagency \n(iii  Implementation unit  Project management unit (project site offices and 18 staff) \nProcurement (civil works)  International  2 contracts  $89.0 milliona \ncompetitive \nbidding \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- 105 international person- $6.0 million \n(contract supervision)  based selection  months \n792 national person-months \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting for civil works and consulting services \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government \nand ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na  Estimated contract values are base civil works costs plus 10% contract contingencies. \nSource: ADB. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n15.  The completed project road\u2019s main alignment will have a total formation width of 11.0 m. \nIts cross section will typically comprise 3.5 m of traffic lanes with 1.5 m of paved shoulders and \n0.5 m of unpaved shoulders on each side, except in urban areas where the paved shoulder \nwidth  will  be  2.0  m.  The  paved  shoulders  are  provided  for  the  substantial  volumes  of \nnonmotorized traffic and pedestrians that use the road. Along the approximately 0.67 km-long \naccess road to Kyon Doe river port, the cross section will be typically two 3.0 m lanes with \nunpaved shoulders. \n \n                                                \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \n16.  The project road will follow the existing alignment for around 45 km of its length. For the \nremaining length, the road will be realigned to maintain vehicle operating speed and to ensure \nroad safety at the design speed of 80 km per hour. The project road will generally follow the \nexisting vertical alignment, with some increase in height to account for potentially higher future \nflood levels. This will apply particularly from km 34 to km 52, where the road level will be \nsubstantially raised to avoid road closure due to flooding, as part of the project\u2019s climate-resilient \ndesign features, with additional culverts provided to equalize flood level impacts on agricultural \nland on both sides of the road. \n \n17.  The project road\u2019s main alignment will have a flexible pavement with asphaltic surfacing. \nThe access road to Kyon Doe river port will be provided with a rigid concrete pavement because \nthe area adjacent to the port is prone to frequent flooding. Pavement structures have been \ndesigned using appropriate design methods based on projected traffic on the project road from \n2019 to 2039, assuming the provision of an asphaltic concrete overlay along the main alignment \nbetween years 2029-2031 to provide additional strength required for traffic loading for the \nremainder of the project road\u2019s service life. Detailed design for the project has been undertaken. \nThe traffic projection is based on present traffic volumes, with growth rates that take into \naccount the likely rapid increase in traffic, in terms of traffic volume and loading, that will occur \nas Myanmar\u2019s economy begins to reflect the effect of economic liberalization and increased \ntrade with neighboring countries, in particular Thailand. \n \n18.  The  Gyaing  (Kawkareik)  Bridge,  which  lies  within  the  project  road  length,  will  be \nreplaced under financing provided by the Government of Japan. The approaches to the new \nbridge will be designed and constructed to essentially the same technical standards as for the \nADB- and AIF-financed sections of the project. \n \n19.  Existing utilities within the project road\u2019s corridor of impact will be relocated before the \ncivil works commence.12 These utilities include approximately 330 power poles and sections of \nthree fiber-optic telecommunications cables. \n \n20.  The technical due diligence confirmed that the project\u2019s technical design, alignment, \ncross section, drainage structures, pavements, and road safety are appropriate for a road in this \nlocation,  and  for  the  volume  of  traffic  projected  to  use  it.  The  construction  program  and \nsequencing provide suitable implementation arrangements for construction activities and site \naccess, especially where the acquisition of new land is required. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  The project has an economic internal rate of return of 19.5%, with a net present value of \n$148.5 million at a 12% discount rate.13 The three main benefits are reduced vehicle operating \ncosts, reduced travel time, and reduced maintenance costs, with other quantified benefits being \nfewer accidents and less pollution, together resulting in increased regional and local trade, and \nimproved road safety. Additional benefits from avoidance of future flooding over the road, which \nhave not been evaluated, would improve the economic merit of the project. \n \n                                                \n12 The corridor of impact is defined typically as the area occupied by the road, including its embankment and cut \nslopes, plus 2 m\u20133 m on each side. This width is substantially less than the government\u2019s standard right-of-way \nwidth for a road of this class, which is approximately 46 m outside urban areas. \n13 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n22.  The MOC is a general government sector unit, and the project is nonrevenue generating. \nThe financial analysis undertaken during project preparation assessed the MOC\u2019s financial \ncapacity to sustainably maintain the project. The analysis concluded that MOC has sufficient \nfinancial capacity, within the government\u2019s budgetary procedures, for the recurrent expenditures \nof operating and maintaining the project in a sustainable manner. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MOC, and DOH. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). The financial management assessment \nundertaken during project preparation revealed that both the MOC and DOH understand ADB\u2019s \nfinancial management policies and implementation procedures as a result of their work for the \nADB-supported Maubin\u2013Phyapon Road Rehabilitation Project. Procurement risk assessment is \nhigh. Additional training in financial management and disbursement practices for the accounting \nstaff of the MOC and DOH is included in the scope of the Maubin-Phyapon Road Rehabilitation \nproject. With this additional support, the financial arrangements for the project are adequate for \nproject implementation. The MOC and DOH will maintain separate project records and accounts \nthat identify works and services financed from the ADB and AIF loan proceeds. The project \nfinancial statements will be audited annually by an independent auditor. Public disclosure of the \nproject  financial  statements,  including  the  annual  audit  reports  on  the  project  financial \nstatements, will be guided by ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy 2011. \n \n24.  The government is committed to promoting good governance and addressing corruption. \nAn anticorruption commission was formed in January 2013, and an anticorruption law was \npromulgated in July 2013. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  Based on the social impact assessment undertaken in March and April 2014, the project \nwill provide long-term positive impacts such as better access to basic facilities and services, and \nfaster  and  convenient  travel.  Additionally,  during  construction,  the  project  will  provide  job \nopportunities for the local communities. However, there are also adverse impacts such as \nphysical and economic displacement of households due to acquisition of land and clearance of \nthe corridor of impact, and increased risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and human trafficking. To \nmaximize  benefits  and address  adverse  impacts,  a  summary  poverty reduction  and social \nstrategy has been prepared.14 The gender categorization of the project is no gender elements, \nbut includes gender issues in the resettlement and ethnic groups development plan (REGDP).15 \nAs the project is in Kayin State, a former conflict area, a detailed communication strategy will be \nimplemented  during  the  project  to  inform  all  stakeholders  of  project  progress  and  ensure \nmeaningful dialogue throughout the project implementation period.16 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) will apply to the entire length of the project \n                                                \n14 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Resettlement and Ethnic Groups Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 A communication strategy has been prepared for the project to promote consultations with and participation of \nethnic communities.

Resettlement. The project has been classified as involuntary resettlement category B in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. As presented in the project\u2019s REGDP \n(footnote 15), 114 households will be affected by land acquisition for the project. The effects \ninclude impacts on 68 main structures (houses and shops) and the acquisition of the following \ntypes of land outside the existing right-of-way, where realignments are required: 8,718 square \nmeters (m2) of residential land, 113,324 m2 of garden land, and 19,528 m2 of cropland. Advance \naction for resettlement will be undertaken prior to the start of construction, as specified in the \nREGDP. \n \n28.  Communities in the project area consist of six ethnic groups: Bamar, Kayin, Mon, Pa Oh, \nShan, and Tamil. Impacts on affected ethnic communities and households are described and \naddressed  in  the  REGDP.  This  includes  minimization  of  impacts  due  to  land  acquisition, \npromotion of local participation in project activities and benefits, and community consultation. \nThe project is categorized as B for indigenous peoples safeguards. A communication and \nparticipation  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  to  ensure  consultations  with  and \nparticipation of ethnic communities; this is included in the PAM. \n \n29.  Environment. The project is not anticipated to cause significant adverse environmental \nimpacts  and  has  been  classified  as  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. An initial environmental examination (IEE) has been prepared to \nmeet the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.17 The IEE and environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) will apply to the entire length of the project road between Eindu and \nKawkareik, including the section of the road incorporating the Gyaing (Kawkareik) Bridge. The \nrecommended environmental mitigation measures and monitoring activities set out in the EMP \ncover the preconstruction, construction, and operation stages of the project. The EMP, which \nalso defines the institutional arrangements and responsibilities for its implementation, will be \nincorporated into the project\u2019s civil works contract documentation for the entire length of the \nproject road between Eindu and Kawkareik, including the section of the road incorporating the \nGyaing (Kawkareik) Bridge. \n \n30.  Training on social safeguards will be provided to MOC, DOH, and local authorities under \nthe CSC contract and under a parallel technical assistance.18 \n \n31.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  on  information \ndisclosure and consultation, the IEE and the REGDP will be posted on ADB\u2019s website before \nthe project is considered by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  The  overall  risk  assessment  of the  project  is medium. The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts of the project are expected to outweigh the costs and thus the project will have a \npositive impact. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described \n                                                \n17 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB. 2010.
