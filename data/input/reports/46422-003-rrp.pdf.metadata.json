The  state  is \nisolated  and  has  been  affected  by  sectarian  conflict  since  1949.  As  a  consequence,  poverty \nlevels  are  high,  and  social  and  economic  infrastructure  is  rudimentary  and  in  poor  condition \nwhere it exists. Despite these factors, the state is traversed by Myanmar\u2019s principal road link to \nThailand, along which about 30% of the country\u2019s land-based trade passes. This road link is part \nof the GMS  EWEC,  which is  intended  to  connect  Da Nang in Viet  Nam  with Mawlamyine and \nYangon  in  Myanmar,  through  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  and  Thailand.  The  GMS \nEWEC road sections have been completed in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, \nand  Viet  Nam;  the  Myanmar  sections  need  to  be  completed  and  improved.  The  project  is \naligned  with  the  development  agenda  of  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which \nsupports inclusive economic growth and regional cooperation and integration.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMyanmar  suffers  from  a  lack  of  good  quality  transport  connections  nationally  and  with \nneighboring  countries,  which  has  constrained  its  economic  growth  and  integration  within  Asia. \nAfter five decades of isolation, it is essential that regional connectivity is improved to  stimulate \nand  sustain  economic  development,  and  to  normalize  cross-border  flow  of  goods  and  people. \nImprovement of the GMS EWEC within Myanmar will dramatically improve connectivity, reduce \ntravel times, and support economic development within the corridor and beyond, lifting many in \nthis poor state of Myanmar out of poverty. The project will (i) improve road access to and within \nKayin State; (ii) facilitate trade between Myanmar and Thailand, and beyond to the wider GMS \nregion;  and  (iii)  support  the  peace  process  and demonstrate  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to \nimproving  the  well-being  of  people  in  areas  that  have  long  been  affected  by  conflict.  Detailed \nconsultations were carried out during project preparation, and a comprehensive communication \nstrategy has been prepared for the project to ensure continued and meaningful dialogue with all \nstakeholders during project implementation. The GMS EWEC within Myanmar is a priority of the \ngovernment, as highlighted in the national transport master plan.3 \n \nThe project will improve the central 66.4-kilometer (km) section of the GMS EWEC within \n4. \nMyanmar,  between  the  towns  of  Eindu  and  Kawkareik.  The  section  to  the  east,  between \nKawkareik and Myawaddy, on the border with Thailand, is being improved with assistance from \nthe  Government  of  Thailand.  The  section  to  the  west,  between  Eindu  and  the  main  Yangon\u2013\nMawlamyine  highway,  is  being  improved  through  a  government-managed  build\u2013operate\u2013\ntransfer concession operated by a Myanmar private company. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n3  Government of Myanmar. 2015. National Transport Master Plan. Nay Pyi Taw. \n\n\fOutput \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be improved trade between Myanmar and Thailand. The outcome will be \n\n \n5. \nThe project road will be improved to the GMS road network standard of two lanes with \nappropriate  width  paved  shoulders,  suitable  for  all  standard  highway  traffic.  The  section  will \nrequire  complete  reconstruction,  with  some short  sections  of  realignment  for  improved  vehicle \noperating speed and road safety. The project also includes design features for climate resilience \nin this flood-prone area, including raising the road to a level that takes into account potentially \nhigher future flood levels to provide year-round access. \n \nThe  project  fully  supports  the  strategic  thrusts  of  the  interim  country  partnership \n6. \nstrategy.4 It  also  supports  the  findings  of  the  Myanmar  Transport  Sector  Initial  Assessment.5 \nThe  project  forms  one  of  a  series  of  assistance  programs  and  projects  provided  by  ADB  in \nKayin State across several sectors. The focused approach to providing assistance  in the state \nwill allow greater familiarity with ADB by the government, as well as benefits from cross-sector \nimprovements to end users and beneficiaries. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nimproved connectivity within Kayin State and with Thailand. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe  project  output  will  be  the  improvement  of  66.4  km  of  road  between  Eindu  and \nKawkareik.  The  completed  road\u2019s  main  alignment  will  have  two  traffic  lanes,  each  3.5  meters \n(m)  wide  and  with  1.5  m-wide  paved  shoulder.  As  part  of  the  project  road  section,  an \napproximately  0.67  km-long  access  road  to  Kyon  Doe  river  port  will  also  be  reconstructed  to \nfacilitate  transport  interchange  between  the  project  road  and  Kayin  State\u2019s  extensive  inland \nwaterway  network.  The  road  design  speed  will  be  80  km  per  hour  outside  built-up  areas,  with \nlower operational speeds in built-up areas for safety reasons. In general, the horizontal alignment \nof  the  road  will  follow  the  existing  centerline.  However,  to  allow  higher  traffic  speeds  and  to \nimprove road safety, about 15 km of the alignment will deviate from the existing alignment by up \nto 200 m. The road improvement  works will also include 19 new bridges and 78 box culverts to \nimprove drainage and water management, especially in the major flood-prone areas from km 34 \nto km 52. Output activities will include (i) two civil works packages for road improvement; and (ii) \na  consulting  services  package  for  construction  supervision  and  design  check,  which  will  also \ninclude project management and implementation capacity development for government staff. \n \nD. \n \n9. \n \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $121.8 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \n\n                                                \n4  ADB. 2012.

The  commitment  charge  of \n0.15% per annum on undisbursed balance of the B loan is currently waived subject to annual approval of the \nAIF board of directors, and this waiver is expected to be maintained. The interest charges of both the A loan \nand the B loan will be capitalized. \n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \n10. \nThe  government  has  requested  (i)  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR71,258,000 ($100.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (A loan), and \n(ii) a loan of $20 million funded through the participation of the AIF (B loan) to help finance the \nproject.6 The  A  loan  will  have  (i)  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  (ii)  an \ninterest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  and \n(iii)  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  A  loan  agreement.  The  ADB-\nadministered B loan of $20.0 million  will have  (i) a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears;  (ii)  a  straight-line  repayment  method;  (iii)  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate-based lending facility (6-month rate plus \n1.4%);  (iv)  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  on  the  undisbursed  balance  (which  is \ncurrently  waived  on  an  annual  basis  by  the  AIF  board  of  directors,  and  which  is  expected  to \ncontinue  being  waived);  and  (v)  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  B  loan \nagreement.

MOC\u2019s \nDepartment  of  Highways  (DOH)  will  be  the  implementing  agency. 8 DOH  has  established  a \nproject management unit (PMU) that will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the \nproject.  Assessment  undertaken  during  project  preparation  of  MOC  and DOH  shows  sufficient \ncapacity to implement the project. The PMU, based in Yangon, is headed by a full-time project \ndirector and is staffed with engineering, financial, administrative, and safeguard specialists. The \nPMU  will  establish  an  appropriately  staffed  and  resourced  office  in  the  project  area  during \nimplementation.  The  arrangements  mirror  those  of  the  recently  approved  Maubin\u2013Phyapon \nRoad  Rehabilitation  Project,  which  has  performed  well  with  respect  to  bidding  and  safeguard \nrequirements.9 \n \n12. \nThe  rehabilitation  of  the  project  road  will  be  implemented  through  two  civil  works \ncontracts:  (i)  one  covering  the  section  of  the  project  road  from  Eindu  to  Gyaing  (Kawkareik) \nBridge  (km  0.0\u2013km  40.4),  and  (ii)  one  covering the  section from  Gyaing (Kawkareik)  Bridge to \nKawkareik (km 42.2\u2013km 66.5). The existing Gyaing (Kawkareik) Bridge (km 40.4\u2013km 42.2) will \nbe replaced with collaborative parallel funding support from the Government of Japan. The civil \nworks  contractors  will  be  responsible  for  all  aspects  of  their  contracts,  including  coordinating \nlabor,  equipment,  supplies,  and  use  of  materials;  achieving  specified  schedule  and  quality \nstandards; and complying with social and environmental requirements. All civil works contracts \nfor the ADB- and AIF-financed part of the project will be procured following procedures set out in \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time-to-time),  subject  to  ADB\u2019s \neligibility requirements waiver.10 Universal procurement will be applied. Recent ADB experience \nwith \nthe  Maubin\u2013Phyapon  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  9)  has  demonstrated \nconsiderable interest by contractors in civil works packages under ADB-supported projects. \n \nThe civil works contracts will be supervised by a contract supervision consultant (CSC), \n13. \nwho  will  be the  engineer for  the  contracts  as  defined in  the  contract  documentation.

The  paved  shoulders  are  provided  for  the  substantial  volumes  of \nnonmotorized  traffic  and  pedestrians  that  use  the  road.  Along  the  approximately  0.67  km-long \naccess  road  to  Kyon  Doe  river  port,  the  cross  section  will  be  typically  two  3.0  m  lanes  with \nunpaved shoulders. \n \n\n                                                \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fThe project road will follow the existing alignment for around 45 km of its length. For the \n16. \nremaining length, the road will be realigned to maintain vehicle operating speed and to ensure \nroad  safety  at  the  design  speed  of  80  km  per  hour.  The  project  road  will  generally  follow  the \nexisting vertical alignment, with some increase in height to account for potentially higher future \nflood  levels.  This  will  apply  particularly  from  km  34  to  km  52,  where  the  road  level  will  be \nsubstantially raised to avoid road closure due to flooding, as part of the project\u2019s climate-resilient \ndesign features, with additional culverts provided to equalize flood level impacts on agricultural \nland on both sides of the road. \n \n17. \nThe project road\u2019s main alignment will have a flexible pavement with asphaltic surfacing. \nThe access road to Kyon Doe river port will be provided with a rigid concrete pavement because \nthe  area  adjacent  to  the  port  is  prone  to  frequent  flooding.  Pavement  structures  have  been \ndesigned using appropriate design methods based on projected traffic on the project road from \n2019 to 2039, assuming the provision of an asphaltic concrete overlay along the main alignment \nbetween  years  2029-2031  to  provide  additional  strength  required  for  traffic  loading  for  the \nremainder of the project road\u2019s service life. Detailed design for the project has been undertaken. \nThe  traffic  projection  is  based  on  present  traffic  volumes,  with  growth  rates  that  take  into \naccount the likely rapid increase in traffic, in terms of traffic volume and loading, that will occur \nas  Myanmar\u2019s  economy  begins  to  reflect  the  effect  of  economic  liberalization  and  increased \ntrade with neighboring countries, in particular Thailand. \n \n18. \nThe  Gyaing  (Kawkareik)  Bridge,  which  lies  within  the  project  road  length,  will  be \nreplaced  under  financing  provided  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  approaches  to  the  new \nbridge will be designed and constructed to essentially the same technical standards as for the \nADB- and AIF-financed sections of the project. \n \n19. \nExisting  utilities  within  the  project  road\u2019s  corridor  of  impact  will  be  relocated  before  the \ncivil works commence.12 These utilities include approximately 330 power poles and sections of \nthree fiber-optic telecommunications cables. \n \n20. \nThe  technical  due  diligence  confirmed  that  the  project\u2019s  technical  design,  alignment, \ncross section, drainage structures, pavements, and road safety are appropriate for a road in this \nlocation,  and  for  the  volume  of  traffic  projected  to  use  it.  The  construction  program  and \nsequencing  provide  suitable  implementation  arrangements  for  construction  activities  and  site \naccess, especially where the acquisition of new land is required. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nThe project has an economic internal rate of return of 19.5%, with a net present value of \n$148.5 million at a 12% discount rate.13 The three main benefits are reduced vehicle operating \ncosts, reduced travel time, and reduced maintenance costs, with other quantified benefits being \nfewer accidents and less pollution, together resulting in increased regional and local trade, and \nimproved road safety. Additional benefits from avoidance of future flooding over the road, which \nhave not been evaluated, would improve the economic merit of the project. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n12 The  corridor  of  impact  is  defined  typically  as  the  area  occupied  by  the  road,  including  its  embankment  and  cut \nslopes, plus  2  m\u20133  m  on  each  side.  This  width is substantially  less  than the government\u2019s  standard  right-of-way \nwidth for a road of this class, which is approximately 46 m outside urban areas. \n\n13 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nThe MOC is a general government sector unit, and the project is nonrevenue generating. \n22. \nThe  financial  analysis  undertaken  during  project  preparation  assessed  the  MOC\u2019s  financial \ncapacity  to  sustainably  maintain  the  project.  The  analysis  concluded  that  MOC  has  sufficient \nfinancial capacity, within the government\u2019s budgetary procedures, for the recurrent expenditures \nof operating and maintaining the project in a sustainable manner. \n \nC. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n23. \nwith  the  government,  MOC,  and  DOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  11).  The  financial  management  assessment \nundertaken during project preparation revealed that both the MOC and DOH understand ADB\u2019s \nfinancial management policies and implementation procedures as a result of  their work for the \nADB-supported Maubin\u2013Phyapon Road Rehabilitation Project. Procurement risk assessment is \nhigh. Additional training in financial management and disbursement practices for the accounting \nstaff of the MOC and DOH is included in the scope of the Maubin-Phyapon Road Rehabilitation \nproject. With this additional support, the financial arrangements for the project are adequate for \nproject implementation. The MOC and DOH will maintain separate project records and accounts \nthat  identify  works  and  services  financed  from  the  ADB  and  AIF  loan  proceeds.  The  project \nfinancial statements will be audited annually by an independent auditor. Public disclosure of the \nproject  financial  statements,  including  the  annual  audit  reports  on  the  project  financial \nstatements, will be guided by ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy 2011. \n \n24. \nThe government is committed to promoting good governance and addressing corruption. \nAn  anticorruption  commission  was  formed  in  January  2013,  and  an  anticorruption  law  was \npromulgated in July 2013. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nBased on the social impact assessment undertaken in March and April 2014, the project \nwill provide long-term positive impacts such as better access to basic facilities and services, and \nfaster  and  convenient  travel.  Additionally,  during  construction,  the  project  will  provide  job \nopportunities  for  the  local  communities.  However,  there  are  also  adverse  impacts  such  as \nphysical and economic displacement of households due to acquisition of land and clearance of \nthe corridor of impact, and increased risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and human trafficking. To \nmaximize  benefits  and  address  adverse  impacts,  a  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy has been prepared.14 The gender categorization of the project is no gender elements, \nbut includes gender issues in the resettlement and ethnic groups development plan (REGDP).15 \nAs the project is in Kayin State, a former conflict area, a detailed communication strategy will be \nimplemented  during  the  project  to  inform  all  stakeholders  of  project  progress  and  ensure \nmeaningful dialogue throughout the project implementation period.16 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  will  apply  to  the  entire  length  of  the  project \n\nE. \n \n26. \n                                                \n14 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Resettlement and Ethnic Groups Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 A  communication  strategy  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  to  promote  consultations  with  and  participation  of \nethnic communities.

The project has been classified as involuntary resettlement category B in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  As  presented  in  the  project\u2019s  REGDP \n(footnote  15),  114  households  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  for  the  project.  The  effects \ninclude impacts on 68 main structures (houses and shops) and the acquisition of the following \ntypes  of  land outside the existing right-of-way,  where realignments  are required:  8,718  square \nmeters (m2) of residential land, 113,324 m2 of garden land, and 19,528 m2 of cropland. Advance \naction for  resettlement  will  be  undertaken  prior  to  the  start  of  construction,  as  specified  in  the \nREGDP. \n \nCommunities in the project area consist of six ethnic groups: Bamar, Kayin, Mon, Pa Oh, \n28. \nShan,  and  Tamil.  Impacts  on  affected  ethnic  communities  and  households  are  described  and \naddressed  in  the  REGDP.  This  includes  minimization  of  impacts  due  to  land  acquisition, \npromotion  of  local  participation  in  project  activities  and  benefits,  and  community  consultation. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  B  for  indigenous  peoples  safeguards.  A  communication  and \nparticipation  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  to  ensure  consultations  with  and \nparticipation of ethnic communities; this is included in the PAM. \n \nEnvironment. The project is not anticipated to cause significant adverse environmental \n29. \nimpacts  and  has  been  classified  as  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  prepared to \nmeet  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.17 The  IEE  and  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) will apply to the entire length of the project road between Eindu and \nKawkareik, including the section of the road incorporating the Gyaing (Kawkareik) Bridge. The \nrecommended environmental mitigation measures and monitoring activities  set out in the EMP \ncover  the  preconstruction,  construction,  and  operation  stages  of  the  project.  The  EMP,  which \nalso  defines  the  institutional  arrangements  and  responsibilities  for  its  implementation,  will  be \nincorporated  into  the  project\u2019s  civil  works  contract  documentation  for  the  entire  length  of  the \nproject road between Eindu and Kawkareik, including the section of the road incorporating the \nGyaing (Kawkareik) Bridge. \n \n30. \nthe CSC contract and under a parallel technical assistance.18 \n \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  on  information \n31. \ndisclosure  and  consultation,  the  IEE  and  the  REGDP  will  be  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  before \nthe project is considered by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nF. \n \n32. \nThe  overall  risk  assessment  of  the  project  is  medium.  The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts  of  the  project  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs  and  thus  the  project  will  have  a \npositive impact. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described \n\nTraining on social safeguards will be provided to MOC, DOH, and local authorities under \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n17 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB.  2010.
