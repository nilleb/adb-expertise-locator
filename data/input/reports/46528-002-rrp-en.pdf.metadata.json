It \nwill comprise a diversion structure, a 117-kilometer (km) main canal, 23 distributaries, 10 minor \ncanals,  485  watercourses,  and  associated  structures.  The  primary  beneficiaries  are  384,000 \npeople in 80 villages in the project area.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSector  overview.  Agriculture  contributed  20%  of  gross  domestic  product  and  was \nPakistan\u2019s largest employer, absorbing 42% of the country\u2019s total labor force in fiscal year (FY) \n2015.3 About 30% of the population lived below the poverty line during FY2014, or about 55 million \nout of Pakistan\u2019s estimated population of 186 million (footnote 3). At 36%, the poverty incidence \nin rural areas in FY2014 was almost double the 19% rate in urban areas (footnote 3). Pakistan\u2019s \nmajor crops are wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize, and cotton, which account for 24% of the value \nadded  in  overall  agriculture  and  5%  of  gross  domestic  product.  Punjab\u2019s  contribution  to  the \nagriculture sector is estimated at more than 80%. The province produced 76% of the nation\u2019s total \noutput of wheat, 51% of rice, 65% of sugarcane, 81% of maize, and 72% of cotton. \n \n4. \nThe  Ministry  of  Planning,  Development  and  Reform  has  estimated  that  the  agriculture \nsector has to grow 5% per year to reduce the poverty incidence and ensure food security, and for \nthe national economy to reach its 7%\u20138% annual growth target.4 But agriculture\u2019s annual growth \nrate only averaged 2.8% during 2010\u20132014, a significant drop from 4.4% average annual growth \nrates  experienced  during  1990s  and  from  3.2%  during  2000s.5  The  sector  is  increasingly \ndominated by small farmers who produce mostly for their own food needs. Only 17% of farms are \nlarge, produce cash crops, and engage in value-added activities.6 \n \nIn  the  Punjab  Growth  Strategy  2018,7  the  government  of  Punjab  sees  growth  in  the \n5. \nagriculture sector as a key element in achieving inclusive growth, and highlights the following: (i) \nincreased crop productivity through improved agriculture research and extension, on-farm water \nmanagement,  and farm  inputs; (ii)  better  value  chains; (iii)  better  use  of energy; (iv)  increased \nhigh-value agriculture; (v) improved land resources and environment and adaptability to climate \n\n                                                \n1  Kharif refers to the sowing season for summer crops. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Jalalpur  Irrigation \n\nProject (TA 8404-PAK). \n\nPolicy (Draft).

Lahore. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fchange  impacts;  (vi)  increased  cultivated  area;  (vii)  improved  productivity  of  water  use  by \nimproving  irrigation  infrastructures;  and  (viii)  improved  regulatory  and  institutional  changes, \nmainly  on  agriculture  inputs.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  the \ngovernment of Punjab in strengthening on-farm water management, adapting to climate change \nimpacts, and rehabilitating irrigation systems, all of which require substantial financing resources. \n \n6. \nBecause  of  the  country\u2019s  semi-arid  climate,  with  an  average  annual  rainfall  of  240 \nmillimeters  in  most  parts  of  the  country,  about  80%  of  arable  land  and  more  than  90%  of \nagriculture  output  depends  on  irrigation.  One  of  the  strengths  of  the  agriculture  sector  is  the \navailability of water from IBIS, the world\u2019s largest contiguous irrigation system covering 15 million \nha  of  farmland,  which  accounts  for  74%  of  the  country\u2019s  irrigated  area.8  The  operational \nperformance of irrigation systems, including IBIS, however, is less than satisfactory. Crop water \nrequirements have dramatically increased as a result of the increase in cropping intensities and \nthe  cultivation  of  high  water-consuming  crops.  While  demand  for  canal  irrigation  water  has \nincreased, surface water availability has essentially remained unchanged as no new reservoirs \nhave been constructed on the Indus River since 1976. Irrigation efficiency is also low at about \n40%.  Agriculture  productivity  per  unit  of  water,  land,  and  other  inputs  is well  below  global  and \nregional standards because of mismanagement of water resources.9 \n \n7. \nIBIS  is  also  financially  unsustainable,  recovering  on  average  only  24%  of  the  costs \nnecessary  for  the  effective  management  of  the  irrigation  infrastructure.10  As  a  result,  asset \nmanagement remains a pervasive problem as irrigation departments routinely defer maintenance \nbecause they lack funds to cover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. To establish efficient \nand sustainable irrigation and drainage institutions, the government of Pakistan launched a far-\nreaching sector reform initiative in 1997 across Pakistan\u2019s four provinces with a view to converting \nthe provincial irrigation departments into autonomous and self-accounting irrigation and drainage \nauthorities. The reforms, however, were not fully successful and the self-accounting irrigation and \ndrainage  authorities  still  lack  the  capacity  to  carry  out  their  intended tasks.11  ADB,  through  its \ntechnical assistance (TA), is reviewing the reforms and their related plans and actions and will \nintegrate  them,  as  appropriate,  into  the  transformation  process  of  the  Punjab  Irrigation \nDepartment (PID) into the Water Resources Department.12 \n \nTo  address  the  country\u2019s  water  stress  in  the  short  to  medium  term,  Pakistan  needs  to \n8. \ninvest more in (i) water conservation, (ii) high-efficiency irrigation, (iii) the capture of unclaimed \nmonsoon  flows  to  irrigate  rain-fed  areas,  and  (iv)  modern  irrigation  systems  and  measures  to \nimprove asset management and irrigation service delivery to ensure food security. \n \n9. \nAbout 20% of Pakistan\u2019s cultivable area is outside IBIS. Farming in most of these areas \n(about 3.24 million ha) is rain fed, resulting in low agricultural productivity. Some of the country\u2019s \npoorest people live in these areas and depend on agriculture for their income. Without a secure \nsource of water for irrigation, farming in rain-fed areas is both a low-productivity and a high-risk \n\n                                                \n8  FAO. 2012.

Although Punjab accounts for 57% of the nation\u2019s cultivable area and accounts for 78% \nof the nation\u2019s irrigated area, about 13% of cultivable land in Punjab is still rain fed.13 \n \n10. \nProposed investment. The project aims to increase agriculture production by bringing \n68,263 ha of less-productive, predominantly rain-fed agricultural land under new IBIS coverage. \nMore than 500,000 people live in the project area, and more than 70% of these people rely on \nfarming for their livelihood.14 Available water for farming is limited, as runoffs from the nearby hills \nand  the  groundwater  are  highly  saline.  The  project  will  provide  as  much  as  284  million  cubic \nmeters of fresh and good quality water annually from the Jhelum River during the high-flow kharif \nseason,15 in accordance with the Water Apportionment Accord that determines the agreed share \nof waters in the Indus Basin among the country\u2019s four provinces.16 ADB first identified the project \nfor possible financing in 201317 and completed a feasibility study in 2015 (footnote 2). \n \n11. \nThe analysis of climate change impacts in the project area for 2025 and 2050 shows that \nannual  rainfall  is  likely  to increase  about  4.0% by  2025  and  6.5%  by  2050,  with the  maximum \nincrease  likely  to  occur  in  the  summer  (July\u2013September).  The  analysis  also  suggested  a \nmaximum increase in extreme rainfall events of about 6% by 2025 and 10% by 2050 for a 100-\nyear  return  period.  The  temperatures  will  also  rise  throughout  the  year,  increasing  the  water \nrequirements of crops. Such increase will be compensated for by increased precipitation.18 \n \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2015\u20132019, \n12. \nwhich  prioritizes  the  promotion  of  better  water  resource  management  and  irrigation,19  and  is \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Pakistan,  2017\u20132019.20  The  project  is \nincluded in the list of upcoming irrigation subsector investments (footnote 7). It is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 and will contribute to some outputs expected in the \nplan.21 Under the current partnership strategy, ADB has been financing two irrigation subsector \nprojects for the Punjab government. The first was the four-tranche multitranche financing facility \nfor the Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program in 2006. Except for slow progress in the \nfirst tranche, all tranches were completed by the original program completion date of September \n2017  and  delivered  major  intended  infrastructure  outputs.22  The  second  is  the  Trimmu  and \nPanjnad Barrages Improvement Project approved in 2014, which is being implemented without \nserious implementation problems.23 \n \n                                                \n13 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of National Food Security and Research. 2013.

The Khewra Salt Mines is the world\u2019s second-largest salt mine and is located near Khewra town, another \nbeneficiary town. \n\n15 The volume of 284 million cubic meters (m3) considering the estimated conveyance efficiency of 68%. \n16 Punjab\u2019s water withdrawal entitlement from the Indus system during the high-flow season is 45.7 billion m3, while the \nprovince\u2019s average actual water withdrawal in the same period during 1991\u20132012 was 41.3 billion m3. Thus, Punjab \nis entitled to an additional 4.4 billion m3 (the balance between the two). The total average water withdrawal of the \nJalalpur irrigation system would be about 6.4% of this unclaimed water entitlement. \n\n17 ADB. 2013.

The PID completed the detailed engineering \ndesign, successfully and in a timely manner, in August 2017 under the project design advance \n(PDA)  approved  in January  2016  with $5  million financing.25  The  PID  has  already  been  in the \nprocess of shortlisting the major project implementation consultants for this project. By the end of \nMay 2018, the PID is expected to complete international competitive bidding for the construction \nof  the  main  irrigation  system,  and  engage  the  major  project  implementation  consultants.  Land \nacquisition  for  the  main  irrigation  system  is  in  the  advanced  stage,  with  50%  completed  as  of \nSeptember 2017. The improved project readiness reflected the lesson identified in administering \nthe first-tranche of the Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program, which took 10 years to \ncomplete because of the absence of its detailed design and draft bid document at the approval.   \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: growth of agriculture sector enhanced and \n15. \nfood  security  ensured  (footnote  7).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  agricultural \nproduction in the project area increased.26 \n \nC. \n \n16. \nOutput  1:  Jalalpur  irrigation  distribution  system  established.  The  structures  to  be \nconstructed include an intake structure at the right bank of the Jhelum River at the Rasul Barrage, \nwith a design discharge capacity of 38.2 cubic meters per second. The flow will be conveyed to \nthe project area through a 117-km main canal and further distributed throughout the project area \nvia 23  distributaries  and  10  minor  canals. The  good  quality  water  that  will  be  delivered by  the \nirrigation system will reduce the use of saline groundwater. Because the main canal will traverse \nnatural drainage channels that carry seasonal and saline flood water from the Salt Range,  the \nproject will construct 72 cross-drainage structures for the safe passage of flood water across the \nmain canal. The project will also construct 18 flood-carrier channels to drain saline flood water to \nthe Jhelum River, protect the project area from floods, and restore soil productivity. In addition, \nthe project will construct 253 associated structures, including 42 flow regulators and drops, 16 \nrailway  and  road  bridges,  15  footbridges,  and  2  escapes.  The  project  will  also  construct  485 \nwatercourses and 17 drinking water supply outlets and, for easy access to water by livestock, 30 \ncattle baths. \n \n17. \nThe project will develop a monitoring and evaluation system using satellite remote sensing \ntechnology to assess irrigation efficiency, crop growing, water productivity, and the abiana;27 and \nwill train staff from the PID and the Punjab Agriculture Department (PAD) to use the system. To \nensure sustainable O&M of the Jalalpur irrigation system, the project will develop a guideline and \na sustainable plan for the system\u2019s O&M with improved asset management and irrigation service \n                                                \n24 Independent  Evaluation  Department.  2013.

To address potential risks \nagainst extreme torrents from the hilly terrain and floods from the Jhelum River,  the project will \nalso develop a flood disaster risk management plan. \n \nOutput 2: Water-use capacity improved in project areas. The project will construct 485 \n18. \nfarm-level field channels (watercourses) to distribute irrigation water over 68,263 ha of farmland \nduring  April\u2013October.  The  project  will  organize  the  beneficiary  farmers  into  water  user \nassociations  (WUAs)  that  will  be  responsible  for  the  O&M  of  the  watercourses  and  their \nassociated structures, and provide training to strengthen their capacity. The project will involve \nthe WUAs  in  planning,  designing,  and  constructing  the  watercourses;  and  will  provide  precast \nparabolic concrete segments to cover 50% of the length of each watercourse.28 To increase crop \nyields and irrigation application efficiency with minimum water wastage,29 the project will provide \nthe project area with precision land leveling covering about 12,140 ha, high-efficiency irrigation \nsystems (HEISs)  covering  more than  800 ha,  and 20  water  storage  ponds with solar  pumping \nstations, under a cost-sharing arrangement with the beneficiary farmers. The project will train the \nWUAs and the farmers on climate-smart irrigation practices covering (i) the use of solar pumping \nstations,  (ii)  precise  land  leveling  and  HEISs,  (iii)  irrigation  schedules  based  on  crop  water \nrequirements, and (iv) other management techniques to maximize water productivity. \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  Farm  management  capacity  improved  in  project  areas.  The  project  will \nestablish 664 agricultural demonstration farms of varying sizes covering 220 ha. The project will \nprovide  6,000  farm  households  with  advisory  services  and  training  on  climate-smart  irrigated \nagriculture practices and more profitable farm management through demonstration activities and \nfarmer field schools. The services and training will cover cropping patterns for high-value crops, \nselection  and  adequate  use  of  seeds  and  fertilizers,  soil  analysis  and  soil  improvement \ntechniques,  and  better  marketing.  The  project  will  (i)  organize  knowledge-sharing  events  to \npromote modern water management and farming technologies, (ii) provide farmers with private \nagriculture  support  services  for  marketing  and  supply  chain  management  of  high-value \nagriculture, and (iii) help farmers develop links between growers and the market. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $360.59  million  (Table  1).

The  project  management  office  (PMO)  for  canals  (PMO-Canals)  for  the  Punjab \nIrrigated Agriculture Investment Program will execute output 1 of this project.31 The PMO-Canals \nstaff has experience in managing ADB projects, such as the Lower Bari Doab Canal Improvement \nProject under the Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program (footnote 22). The PAD will be \nthe implementing agency. A project implementation office (PIO) to be established in the PAD will \nimplement outputs 2 and 3, under the overall coordination and oversight of the PID.

The project \nwill build 72 cross-drainages to let the flood flows pass safely across the main canal, and 18 flood-\ncarrier channels to let the saline flood flows pass to the Jhelum River. The design capacity of the \ncross-drainage structures and flood-carrier channels, with a 40-year return period for floods, is \nsufficient to incorporate the risk of the increase in flood events because of climate change.  \n \n24. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The project will incorporate innovative satellite remote \nsensing  technology  into the monitoring  and  evaluation  system for  the  efficient  and  transparent \nassessment of irrigation efficiency, crop growing, water productivity, and the abiana. Precise land \nleveling  of  about  12,140  ha  and  HEISs  covering  more  than  800  ha  will  increase  irrigation \napplication efficiency to reduce water wastage. The project will build a concrete flume on 50% of \nthe length of each watercourse to avoid water losses. \n \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n25. \nThe  project\u2019s  main  economic  benefits  will  be  increased  agricultural  production  made \npossible  by  the  provision  of  seasonal  irrigation  water  to  about  68,263  ha  of  land  with  low \nagricultural productivity. Good quality irrigation, to be made available by the project during April\u2013\nOctober every year, will help not only the summer crops but also the winter crops (October\u2013May) \nbecause  of  the  increased  soil  moisture  at  the  end  of  the  irrigation  season  and  the  gradual \nimprovement in groundwater quality. Over its 6-year implementation period, the project will bring \nabout  diversification,  increase  crop  intensity  from  13%  to  90%,  and,  depending  on  the  crop, \nincrease crop yield by between 12% and 141%. The estimated internal economic rate of return is \n15%.32 The sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic viability of the project is most sensitive \nto  a  2-year  delay  in  the  realization  of  benefits.  Therefore,  it  is  essential  that  the  project  is \nimplemented as scheduled through the provision of technical and extension support to the project \nbeneficiaries. \n \n26. \nThe management and O&M of Punjab\u2019s irrigation systems is estimated at $51.30/ha per \nyear.  During  2013\u20132016,  the  government  of  Punjab  has  allocated  $158  million  equivalent  or \n$18.60/ha  annually  on  average  for  this  purpose.  Despite  the  financial  gap,  Punjab\u2019s  irrigation \nsystems are in reasonably good condition and deliver an acceptable level of water to end users. \nThe government of Punjab will allocate adequate resources to fully implement the O&M plan to \nbe developed under the project. During the development of the O&M plan, the PID and ADB will \nreassess and reconfirm the adequacy of the O&M requirement.33 ADB will provide small-scale TA \nfor the continued monitoring of the financial sustainability and O&M status of the Jalalpur irrigation \nsystem after project completion. Ensuring the financial sustainability of irrigation systems is the \ncore agenda of irrigation sector reforms. ADB, through its TA, is reviewing the reforms and their \nrelated plans and actions and will integrate them, as appropriate, into the transformation process \nof the PID into the Water Resources Department under ADB TA (footnote 12). \n \nC. \n \n27. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  PID  and  the  PAD  have \nsatisfactory capability to record financial transactions and balances, provide regular records and \nmonitor  reports,  and  safeguard  assets.  But  their  financial  management  risks  were  assessed \nsubstantial because the assessment identified an accounting staff shortage in the PID and a lack \nof internal audit arrangement in the PID and the PAD. To address these weaknesses, the PID \nand the PAD will need to be strengthened by appointing additional staff. \n \n28. \nProcurement of civil works and goods will follow ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time), while  consultant engagement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All civil works contracts valued at $10 \nmillion  and above will  be  procured  using international  competitive bidding.  Consulting services \nwill be recruited in two packages for the project management and construction supervision of the \nPMO-Canals,  and one package for  implementation  support  of  outputs  2 and 3 under the  PIO, \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection method with a 90:10 ratio. Two individual consultants \n(one  for  social  and  another  for  environment)  will  be  required  for  the  external  monitoring  of \nsafeguard  implementation under  the  PMO-Canals,  and  two  other  individual  consultants  will  be \nrequired to support the PID  secretary.

The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \nD. \n \n29. \nAgricultural land is turning barren because of groundwater salinity and the use of saline \nflood  water  from  the  Salt  Range  for  agriculture,  which  ultimately  reduces  crop  production  and \nleads  to  increasing  poverty  in  the  region.  The  majority  of  farmers  in  the  project  areas  have \nsmallholdings and are considered poor. The construction of a new irrigation system; provision of \nirrigation supplies and agricultural support services; and training on the efficient use of irrigation \nwater,  irrigated  agriculture  practice,  and  more  profitable  farm  management  will  contribute  to \npoverty  reduction  by  increasing  agricultural  production  and  improving  the  income  of  about \n500,000  mostly  poor  rural  people.  Irrigated  agriculture  will  create  job  opportunities  for  on-farm \nand off-farm labor in both farming and nonfarming communities. The communities will also benefit \nfrom the reliable supply of irrigation water, as well as improved water-use skills. The project will \nconstruct about 17 water supply outlets, which will help reduce poverty by increasing household \naccess to safe water. \n \n30. \nIn addition to their household tasks, women perform a large proportion of agriculture- and \nlivestock-related  activities,  which  often  require  the  use  of  water.  Yet  women  farmers  are  often \nexcluded from training on improved agricultural practices and water-use skills. They also have \nvery  little participation  in  decision making as  they  are  often  not WUA  members. The  project  is \nclassified effective gender mainstreaming and will address these gender issues by (i) installing \nwater supply outlets, cattle baths, fencing, and crossing points in strategic places of the irrigation \nsystem;  (ii)  encouraging women\u2019s  participation  in  the WUAs;  (iii)  training  women  on  water-use \nskills; and (iv) ensuring women farmers\u2019 participation in training on irrigated agricultural practices \nand profitable farming systems. \n \nE. \n \n31. \ncategories are as follows: \n \n32. \nEnvironment  (category  A).  The  PID  prepared  an  environmental  impact  assessment \n(EIA)  following  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Major  anticipated  adverse  environmental  and \nsocial impacts related to construction include soil erosion, noise, cutting trees, and impacts on \npublic structures and infrastructure. Among the potential adverse impacts during operation are \nfloods from hill torrents, disposal of solid waste in canals, and use of fertilizers and pesticides. \nProtected zones near the project area are the Jalalpur Wildlife Sanctuary, which  is a breeding \narea for the Punjab urial, and the Rasul Barrage Game Reserve. The EIA established that the \nproject will not have any significant impact on the avifauna and aquatic life of the game reserve, \nnor  will  it  affect  wildlife  in  the  wildlife  sanctuary.  The  PID  incorporated  adequate  mitigation \nmeasures into the project design and will implement them through an environmental management \nplan (EMP). The environment experts of the project implementation consultant will supervise the \ncontractor in implementing the EMP. The PID will establish an environmental and social safeguard \nunit, which will ensure that the project is implemented in an environmentally sustainable manner. \nAn  external  individual  environment  expert  will  ensure  that  all  contractual  obligations  related  to \nenvironmental  and social  compliance are met.  The  EMP  includes provisions  on  environmental \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n34 Procurement Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fand social management, as well as an occupational health and safety development program, and \nthe  PMO-Canals  and  contractors  will  implement  them  through  training  and  workshops  at  the \npreconstruction  and  construction  stages.  The  project  complies  with  public  disclosure  and \nconsultation  requirements.  The  PDA  consultants  held  two  rounds  of  community  consultations \nduring the EIA process and disclosed the EIA on the ADB website on 4 July 2017. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The main canal, distributaries, and flood-carrier \nchannels  to  be  constructed  under  output  1  will  require  3,283  ha  of  land.  Almost  99%  of  the \nrequired land is privately owned and will need to be acquired. Out of this, 1,370 ha is agricultural \nland.  Only  about  5.6 ha is for residential  and/or commercial  purposes.  At  the  main  canal,  216 \nresidential and 10 commercial structures may be affected, along with 43 tube wells and related \nstructures.  Construction  of  the  distributaries  may  also  affect  about  39  miscellaneous  private \nstructures. About 8,000 people may be affected. Of these, 2,920 landowners may lose 10% or \nmore of their agricultural land, while 166 owners of residential and commercial structures may \nneed to relocate. The PDA consultants prepared a draft land acquisition and resettlement plan \n(LARP)  following  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  based  on  a  socio-economic  survey  of  400 \npotentially displaced persons and community consultations. The PID disclosed the draft LARP on \nthe  ADB  website  on  25  August  2017.  The  PID  will  prepare  the  final  LARPs  following  the \nnotification of land acquisition under Sections 4 and 6 of the Pakistan Land Acquisition Act (1894), \nmarking of the project boundaries in the field, census, detailed measurement surveys, and further \nconsultations with affected persons. Under output 2, land will be required for the 485 watercourses \nto be constructed, along with more than 18,910 small farm turnout structures. The required land \nwill  be  provided  by  the  farmers  and  local  communities  as  counterpart  support,  including  other \nassets,  therefore  involuntary  resettlement  is  not  involved.  Safeguard  measures  to  ensure  that \ncontributions are voluntary and documented are provided in the PAM. \n \n34. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). Punjabis comprise the majority of the population in \nthe project area, and there are no communities or groups that may be considered as indigenous \npeoples as defined under the Safeguard Policy Statement. All ethnic groups are mainstreamed \ninto the general Pakistan society and culture. \n \nF. \n \n35. \nADB has identified and assessed the risks associated in the implementation and sustained \nperformance  of  the  project  in  aspects  such  as  technical;  economic  and financial;  governance; \npoverty, social, and gender; and safeguards. The project\u2019s overall risk was assessed moderate. \nSignificant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nRisks \nExtreme weather events cause hill torrent \nfloods above design discharges, damaging \nthe irrigation system, farm land, and \nproperties. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \nThe PID examined several options for the initial section using a model \nexperiment and selected the least-cost solution for capital investment \nand O&M.
