The  Project  will  support  improved  water  supply  and \nsewerage  management  and  operations,  improved  environmental \nmonitoring  related  to  water  supply  and  sewerage  operations, \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  trade  waste  policies  and \nprocedures, conduct of public awareness campaigns, and a tariff \nstudy.  It  will  also  provide  support  for  the  creation  of  a  water  and \nsewerage  department  (WSD)  followed  by  the  creation  of  a  water \nand  sewerage  corporation \nfor \ngovernance similar to those of a commercial water and sewerage \nagency. \n \nThe  Fiji  Island\u2019s  principal  urban  areas  suffer  from  deficiencies  in \ntheir water supply and sewerage systems, to the extent that their \neconomic  and  social  development  is  being  hindered  and  their \nenvironments  are  being  adversely  affected.  Water  shortages  in \nthe  Suva\u2013Nausori  urban  area  are  having  an  increasingly  harmful \neffect on the local economy. No new connections are being given, \nwhich  has  effectively  halted  new  land  development.  Many \nlocalities are not served by a piped sewerage system. Local land \nzoning \nthe  density  of \ndevelopment  in  unsewered  urban  areas.  Lack  of  sewerage  is \nholding  back  development  and  causing  gross  pollution in several \nlocalities. \n \nThe  Fiji  Island\u2019s  water  supply  and  sewerage  services \u2014currently \nprovided  by  the  Public  Works  Department  (PWD),  which  is \nresponsible  also  for  roads,  buildings,  and  mechanical  and \nelectrical  services \u2014are suffering from ineffective management, a \nlack  of  maintenance,  and  shortages  of  funds.  Water  losses \nbetween  production  and  consumption  average  55%,  and  tariff \ncollections average only 60% of billings.  The Government of the \nRepublic of the Fiji Islands has provided financial support, but it is \nnow  inadequate  to  carry  out  needed  repairs  and  replacements. \nThere  is  a  need  to  establish  a  department  focused  on  water  and \nsewerage  operations,  with  the  potential  to  be  converted  into  a \n\nregulations  place \n\nrestrictions  on \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope \n\nthe \n\ncommercial corporation, based on the principles of a strong client \norientation,  an  awareness  of  the  value  of  water  and  sewerage \nservices, an ability to collect and retain revenues fully covering the \ncost of the services provided, and transparency and accountability \nin its operations. \n \nThe Project will address the need for improved water supply and \nsanitation  services  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area.  It  will  improve \nenvironmental  conditions  throughout  the  area,  including  in  low \ncost  and  squatter  housing  areas.  The  Project  will  also  help \nenhance \nlong-term  sustainability  of  water  supply  and \nsewerage  services  through  supporting  implementation  of  more \neffective  policies  and  institutional  arrangements  as  well  as \nproviding investment for the development of these services.   \nThe  Project\u2019s  physical  works  comprise  the  most  urgent  and \nimmediate  investment  needs,  as  identified  in  master  plans  for \nwater  supply  and  sewerage  development  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori \narea. \n \nProject  outputs  will  include:  (i)  improvement  of  the  coverage  and \nquality  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  in  the  Suva\u2013\nNausori  area;  (ii)  improvement  of  the  adverse  environmental \nconditions  that  have  been  caused  by  inadequate  sewerage \nservices;  and  (iii)  establishment  of  WSD/WSC  for  provision  of \nwater  supply  and  sewerage  services  in  the  country\u2019s  metered \nwater  supply  areas,  with  arrangements \nfor  autonomy, \ntransparency, and accountability similar to those of a commercial \nwater and sewerage corporation. \n \nProject activities will include: (i) rehabilitation and augmentation of \nwater  supply  networks,  water  treatment,  and  water  storage \nfacilities;  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  augmentation  of  sewerage \nnetworks  and  sewage  treatment  facilities;  (iii)  development  of  a \nnew  source  of  water  supply;  (iv)  establishment  of  stronger \nenvironmental  management  procedures;  and \ninstitutional \ndevelopment of the proposed WSD/WSC, particularly in the fields \nof  management,  accounting  and  financial  operations,  operation \nand  maintenance  of  water  supply  and  sewerage \nfacilities, \nenvironmental management, and customer relations. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  US$72.4  million \nequivalent,  of  which  foreign  exchange  costs  amount  to  US$48.0 \nmillion  equivalent  (66%  including  US$4.7  million  for  commitment \ncharges, front-end fee, and interest during construction). \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide US$47.0 million \nfor  the  Project.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the \ncosts. \n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  US$47.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n\n\f \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n  v\n\n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5% \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement. \n \nUntil 30 June 2009 \n \n31 December 2008 \n\nlending \n\n \nThe  Executing  Agency  will  establish  a  project  management  unit \n(PMU)  for  works  and  a  PMU  for  reforms.  The  Government  will \ncreate  a  project  steering  committee  as  a  subcommittee  of  the \nexisting capital works committee. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Works  and  Energy  will  be  the  Executing  Agency \nand WSD/WSC will be the Implementing Agency for the Project.   \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  under  Asian  Development \nBank  Loans. The  principal  civil  works,  equipment,  and  materials \ncontracts will be awarded through ADB\u2019s international competitive \nbidding  procedures.  At  present,  nine  international  competitive \nbidding  procurement  packages  are  proposed,  but  this  number \nmay be reduced, depending upon considerations of economy and \nefficiency.  Small  contracts  not  exceeding  US$2.0  million  for \nconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  pipelines  in  built-up  areas  and \nfor  minor  construction  works  will  be  awarded  through  local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  International \nshopping will be used for procurement of equipment and materials \nin  small  contracts  of  less  than  US$500,000.    Some  small  works \n(such as for replacement of consumer water meters, installation of \nsmall  service  pipes,  and  leakage  detection  and  repairs)  may  be \ncarried out under force account procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  in  several  packages  for  (i) \nproject  management-works; (ii) project management-reforms; (iii) \nwater  loss  reduction,  wastewater  inflow/infiltration  assessment, \nmapping, environmental monitoring and computerization; and (iv) \ndetailed  design  and  construction  supervision.  Packages  (ii)  and \n(iii) will be funded by ADB and packages (i) and (iv) will be funded \nby  the  Government.  The  consultants  for  package  (i)  will  be \nselected as individuals, and the consultants for packages (ii), (iii), \nand  (iv)  will  be  selected  as  firms.  For  packages  (ii)  and  (iii), \nconsultants  will  be  selected  as  firms  by  the  Executing  Agency \nusing the quality- and cost-based process in accordance with the \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank and its Borrowers. For package (i), it has been agreed that \nin \ninternational  consultants  will  be  selected \n\nin  a  process \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nAdvance Action and \nRetroactive Financing \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the \nAsian  Development  Bank  and  its  Borrowers.  Package  (iv) \nrecruitment  is  under  way.  Suitably  qualified  and  experienced \nconsultants are being selected by the Executing Agency through a \ninternational  quality-  and  cost-based  selection, \nprocess  of \nacceptable  to  ADB.  A  total  of  825  person-months  of  consulting \nservices  will  be  required,  comprising  615  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services  and  210  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services. \n \nAdvance  action  financing  will  be  provided  for  recruitment  of \nurgently  needed  consultants  and  for  procurement  of  civil  works \nand  supply  of  equipment  and  materials  of  urgent  water  loss \nreduction activities begun after 1 January 2004 in an amount not \nexceeding  US$1.0  million  equivalent.  Retroactive  financing  for \nwater  loss  reduction  activities  require  prior  approval  of  ADB. \nAdvance action for civil works, equipment and materials for other \nurgently  needed  water  system  rehabilitation  and  augmentation \nworks will also be provided. \n \nThere  are  high  socioeconomic,  economic,  and  environmental \nbenefits  associated  with  the  Project.  The  beneficiaries  of  the \nProject\u2019s  institutional  development components will comprise the \n450,000 inhabitants of the country\u2019s metered water supply areas. \nThe beneficiaries of the Project\u2019s physical components will be the \nmore  than  262,000  residents  of  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area,  more \nthan 27% of whom live on or below the poverty line, and industries \nand commercial enterprises within the Suva\u2013Nausori area.  \n \nWithin \nrehabilitation  and \naugmentation  of  water  supply  facilities  will  eliminate  the  acute \nwater shortages that have been experienced in recent years, and \nwill remove a major constraint to economic growth.  \n \nThe  sewerage  components  of  the  Project  will  alleviate  serious \npollution  of  streams,  drains,  and  coastal  waters,  and  alleviate \nunhealthy conditions in low income and squatter areas. \n \nNationally,  benefits  will  accrue  from  the  establishment  of  an \nefficient, autonomous water supply and sewerage agency that will \nprovide effective and sustainable services for the future. \n \nCost recovery will be improved through a commercial approach to \nmanagement, and costs will be reduced through water loss/inflow \nand  infiltration  reduction.    Methods  of  increasing  tariff  revenues \nhave  been  discussed,  and  a  tariff  study  is  provided  under  the \nassociated  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  assess  alternatives  and \nprepare  detailed  proposals.  It  has  been  agreed  that  WSD/WSC \nwill  recover,  by  2006,  the  costs  of  operations,  maintenance  and \ndebt  service  and  by  2012,  the  costs  of  operation,  maintenance, \ndepreciation, and interest. To achieve the 2006 target will require \n\nthe  Suva\u2013Nausori  area, \n\nthe \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n  vii \n\nto  continued  discharge  of  sewage  by \n\nonly  a  modest  tariff  increase  of  about  25%.  However,  to  achieve \nthe 2012 target will require further tariff increases of about 70%. It \nis  understood  that  tariff  increases  will  be  undertaken  as  services \nimprove, and will be designed to ensure that the services provided \nremain affordable for all population groups. \n \nThe  main  risk  is  that  the  institutional  reforms,  including  the \nrestructuring  of  PWD\u2019s  water  and  sewerage  services  into  a \ndepartment, and the subsequent establishment of a commercially \noperated  water  and  sewerage  corporation,  will  be  delayed  or \nineffective, and not result in the expected improvements in water \nand sewerage operations. A related risk is that cost recovery will \nbe  insufficient  to  ensure  the  sustainable  provision  of  water  and \nsewerage services.  Another risk is that environmental conditions \nmay  not  improve,  despite  the  investments  made  in  the  Project, \ndue \nthose  without \nconnections.  However,  the  Government  is  strongly  committed  to \nthe  Project,  which  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with \noperational output targets reflected in assurances, and they will be \nclosely monitored during project implementation. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  an  associated  TA  for  capacity \nbuilding \nthe  provision  of  water  supply,  sewerage,  and \nenvironmental  services.  The  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at \nUS$978,000  comprising  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  US$661,000 \nand  a  local  currency  cost  of  US$317,000.  ADB,  through  its  TA \nfunding program, will  finance  US$783,000  on  a  grant  basis.  The \nobjectives of the TA are to (i) build capacity in the fields of trade \nwaste  management,  environmental  management,  health  and \nsafety  procedures,  community  education  and  awareness;  and  to \n(ii)  enhance  cost  recovery  from  customers  through  a  tariff  study \nthat  will  identify  the  costs  of  various  water  supply  and  sewerage \nservices and identify efficient, effective, and affordable changes in \nthe  tariff  structure.  The  TA  will  complement  capacity-building \nmeasures  that  are  to  be  financed  through  the  loan.  Consultants \nengaged  under  the  TA  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank and its Borrowers. \n\nin \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following  report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  the  Fiji  Islands  for  the  Suva-Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage Project. \nThe  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  in  the \nProvision of Water Supply and Sewerage Services, and if the Board approves the loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nThe  urban  water  supply  and  sewerage  systems  of  the  Fiji  Islands,  which  were  well \n2. \ndeveloped  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  have  not  kept  pace  with  demand  and  have  suffered  from \ndeferred  maintenance.  Despite  an  ambitious  capital  investment  program  carried  out  over  the \nlast  several  years,  deficiencies  are  widespread.  Table  1  illustrates  the  extent  and  causes  of \ndeficiencies in the water supply and sewerage services in the Suva\u2013Nausori area. \n \n\nTable 1: Analysis of Water Supply and Sewerage Services Performance \n\nCurrent Situation and Performance \n\nIndicator \nPoverty \nUrban poverty \n\nWater Supply Indicators \n\nService  \n\nSupply disruptions and \ndeficiencies  \n\nUnaccounted-for water \n\nLeakages  \n\nGastroenteric disease \n\nSewerage Indicators \n\nSewerage coverage \n\nPollution of natural waters  \n\nCurrent estimates indicate that more than 27% of the 262,000 people who live in the \nSuva\u2013Nausori urban area subsist below the poverty line. \n\nAbout  243,000  persons,  or  93%  of  the  population  of  the  Suva\u2013Nausori area, have \ndirect  connections  to  piped  water  supplies.a Although the water supplied is in most \ncases potable, disruptions of service are frequent, and cause considerable hardship. \nWater  users  who  lack  connections  either  get  their  water  from  a  neighbor\u2019s  tap  or \ndepend  upon  wells  and  streams.  While  some  wells  are  of  good  quality,  many  are \nbadly polluted, particularly in low-lying areas.  \n\nDuring  the  early  1990s,  disruptions  occurred  during  \u201cdrought\u201d  years.  By  the  mid-\n1990s,  disruptions  occurred  during  the  drier  periods  of  each  year.  Now,  they  occur \nduring all periods of the year.  Provision of water by tank truck, with storage in plastic \ntanks, which is very expensive, has become common. \nUnaccounted-for waterb has increased from about 30% of water supplied in the early \n1990s to about 55% of water supplied in 2003. It comprises losses of water recorded \nas delivered to consumers due to physical leakages, or inaccurate or missing meters.  \n\nLeakages  occur  in  house  connections,  distribution  system,  reservoirs,  pumping \nstations,  and  transmission  mains.  An  ongoing  leak  detection  survey  shows \nconsiderable losses throughout the system, including in transmission mains , many of \nwhich are old and in need of replacement.  \n\nDuring 1995-2000, 10,000 cases of diarrhea were reported in the Suva\u2013Nausori area, \nmost among infants and in areas where piped water is not available or the quality of \npiped water is compromised. \n\nAbout  71,000  persons,  or  about  27%  of  the  population  of  the  Suva\u2013Nausori area, \nhave access to a sewerage system. Most of the remainder are connected to septic \ntanks  and  some  lack  sewerage  altogether.  Sewage  effluent  flows  to  streams  and \ncoastal waters. High-density development is banned in areas without sewers, causing \ndevelopment to spread out, and increasing the demand for water. \n\nLevels  of  indicator  bacteria  in  streams  and coastal waters demonstrate that many \nwaters are unsuitable for contact activities. As these waters are used for fishing and \nshellfish gathering, they are a potential health risk. \n\n\f2 \n\nIndicator \n\nOverflows from the \nsewerage system  \n\nInstitutional Indicators \nOrganization and \nmanagement \n\nHuman resources  \n\nFinancial Indicators \n\nFlow of funds  \n\nCurrent Situation and Performance \n\nMost of Suva\u2019s 71 pumping stations overflow frequently, due to inflow of groundwater \nto sewers, together with blocked sewers, broken exposed mains, and sewage pump \nbreakdowns.  \n\nUrban  water  supply  and  sewerage  systems  are  developed  and  managed  by  the \nWater Supply and Sewerage Section of the Public Works Department (PWD) of the \nMinistry  of  Works  and  Energy.  Management  of  the  section  is  not  substantially \nconcerned with water losses or cost recovery. Response times to problems are long. \nOutside  the  Suva\u2013Nausori area, even maintenance is shared with other sections of \nPWD. \n\nPWD  has  a  shortage  of  personnel  with  appropriate  managerial,  financial,  and \ntechnical qualifications and experience. \n\nPWD  is  responsible  for  billing  and  collection.  Revenues  are  turned  over  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  consolidated  fund  and  PWD  is  in  turn  financed  through  government \nbudgetary  allocation.  There  is  little  incentive  for  PWD  to  improve  its  financial \nefficiency. \n\nRevenues  \n\nRevenues are presently insufficient to meet even cash operating costs. \n\nBilling and collection \n\nCollections efficiency is about 60% of potential revenues. \n\nAccounts receivable are currently about 300 days of sales. \n\na  Based  upon  a  household  size  of  4.6  persons  per  connection.  Some  sources  put  the  proportion  of  the  population \nwith  direct  connections  as  low  as  86%.  Although  the  2002  household  income  and  expenditure  survey  of  urban \nhouseholds  put  the  proportion  of  the  population  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori region with som e form of access to piped \nwater supply at 97%, it may have underestimated the rural population in the water supply system service area. \nb    Defined here as the difference between water used in production as measured by meters at the treatment plant \n\noutlet and water provided to consumers as measured by meters at the point of consumption.  \n\n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Opportunities \n\nincluding \n\nthroughout \n\nthe  system, \n\nleakages  are  occurring \n\n3. \nThe Suva\u2013Nausori water supply distribution system, on which the physical works of the \nProject are centered, requires improvements from the source to the consumer tap. Consumers \nthroughout the service area, particularly those living at high elevations, in locations distant from \nthe  treatment  plants,  and  in  slum  and  squatter  areas,  are  suffering  from  frequent  service \ninterruptions.  Substantial \nin \ntransmission lines, distribution lines, and reticulation systems. Administrative losses result from \nunder-registration  of  meters  and  unauthorized  connections.  Physical  losses  can  be  reduced \nthrough  rehabilitation  works  and  both  types  of  losses,  physical  and  administrative,  can  be \nreduced through better management. The existing water intake at Waila on the Rewa River is \nsubject  to  saltwater  intrusion  during  the  dry  season.  The  two  water  treatment  plants  require \nrehabilitation to achieve optimal treatment levels, particularly in the areas of backwash facilities, \ninstrumentation,  and  chemical  dosing.  There  is  also  the  potential  to  increase  water  production \nthrough  process  improvements.  The  water  transmission  and  distribution  systems  require \noptimization  to  better  distribute  the  produced  water  to  service  areas  in  relation  to  relative \ndemand. There is a need to decrease the loading on the Tamavua water treatment plant, which \nis currently operating at twice its design capacity, and to increase the loading on the Waila water \ntreatment  plant,  which  has  recently  been  augmented  and  is  operating  substantially  under  its \ndesign capacity. Elimination of leakages in the distribution system will enable better services to \nbe  provided  to  the  present  and  future  population  of  the  area  and  help  minimize  increases  in \ntreatment plant capacity. Illegal connections are substantial and should be eliminated. Improved \n\n\f3 \n\nmetering  of  consumers,  of  supply  areas,  and  of  water  intakes  will  help  in  leakage  reduction. \nEnhanced  and  expanded  system \ninstrumentation  will  enable  better  coordination  and \nmanagement  of  supplies,  particularly  during  times  of  shortages.  There  is  a  need  to  enhance \nwater supplies to better service both existing and new consumers.1  \n \n4. \nThe  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  system  faces  similar  needs.  The  Kinoya \nsewage  treatment  plant  currently  has  nearly  40%  excess  capacity  for  dry  weather  flows  when \ninflows  and  infiltration  (I&I)  are  at  reasonable  levels;  however,  even  high  tide  results  in  higher \nflow and salinity levels, which reduce treatment efficiency. In the central Suva area, anecdotal \nevidence  suggests  I&I  as  high  as  90%  in  wet  weather.  I&I  also  means  exfiltration,  that  is, \nsubstantial raw sewage is discharged to the environment.  This together with frequent overflows \nfrom deteriorated pump stations, and blocked and broken sewer mains, has resulted in serious \npollution of the urban water environment.  Rehabilitation of these facilities will allow the current \nsystem to achieve its desired environmental and public health benefits and allow connection of \na larger percentage of the population, further improving the environment and taking advantage \nof  the  capacity  of  the  Kinoya  sewage  treatment  plant.  The  Kinoya  sewage  treatment  plant, \nwhich  includes  an  older  trickling  filter  system  for  secondary  treatment  as  well  as  a  new \nsequencing batch reactor, generally operates effectively and achieves international wastewater \ndischarge quality standards, but its capacity is limited by the inlet works. Odor control problems \nalso occur. Sludge treatment and disposal facilities are inadequate. Improved instrumentation of \nthe  sewage  treatment  plant  will  allow  overall  treatment  efficiency  improvements  and  efficient \nbalancing between the trickling filter and sequencing batch reactor plant.  \n \n5. \nThe underlying problems of delivery of water supply and sewerage are often described \nas shortages of water in reservoirs and  lack of finance. These problems exist, but they are not \nthe fundamental problems. Water resources in the area are abundant, and the Government  has \npoured  substantial  financial  resources  into  capital  works.  Nevertheless,  the  works  have  not \nhelped improve services as expected because of operational shortcomings.  \n \n6. \nUnder  the  present  institutional  arrangements,  senior  staff  of  the  Public  Works \nDepartment  (PWD)  are  responsible  not  only  for  water  supply  and  sewerage  but  also  roads, \nbuildings,  and  mechanical  and  electrical  works;  management  information  systems  are  more \nfocused  on  capital  works  than  on  operations  or  finances;  and  operations  are  bound  up  in \nbureaucracy. High unaccounted-for water (UFW) in the water supply system and high I&I in the \nsewerage system lead to unnecessarily high treatment plant, distribution, and collection system \ncosts. The practice of permitting nonpaying customers, to remain connected reduces revenues, \nand  the  gap  between  costs  and  revenues  prevents  the  mobilization  of  the financial resources \nneeded  for  better  asset  management.  Shortages  of  senior  staff  lead  to  substantial  use  of \nconsultants in line positions and result in management deficiencies. \n \nthe \nthe  urgently  needed  service  delivery \n7. \nsustainability of these improvements require concurrent management and institutional reforms. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Strategic  Plan  2003-2005  and  PWD\u2019s  Corporate  Plan  for  2002  lay  out  a \nframework  for  moving  ahead.  The  Strategic  Plan  provides  for  corporatization  of  water  and \nsewerage services by 2005. Within this framework, PWD\u2019s Corporate Plan points out the need \nfor  creating  an  entity  separate  from  other  public  works  responsibilities  to  provide  for  better \nmanagement  and  improved  delivery  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  services.  It  proposes  the \nreorganization  of  the  water  and  sewerage  section  of  PWD  into  an  autonomous  water  and \n\nimprovements  and \n\nAchievement  of \n\n                                                 \n1  Supplementary  Appendix  A  includes  a  demand  assessment  for  water  supply  and  the  sewerage  collection  and \n\ntreatment system. \n\n\f4 \n\nsewerage  corporation  (WSC).  The  Government  and  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Works  and  Energy \n(MWE) have underlined the need to plan carefully for the transition. Underlying concerns include \nthe  need  to  maintain  the  present  high  level  of  accessibility  to  services,  to  avoid  any  harmful \nimpacts  on  the  poor,  to  retrain  and  redeploy  staff  rather  than  make  them  redundant,  and  to \navoid  substantial  tariff  increases  until  services  can  be  improved.  To  minimize  unexpected \nimpacts,  the  transition  from  a  water  and  sewerage  department  (WSD)  to  a  WSC  is  being \nphased.  \n \nIt  is  clear  that  the  overall  institutional  framework  for  the  water  supply  and  sewerage \n8. \nsector  needs  improvement.  Steps  are  being  taken  to  create  a  water  policy,  and  to  strengthen \ncontrols  over  wastewater  discharges  through  a  public  health  and  pollution  control  bill  and  a \nsustainable development bill. However, both bills have been under consideration for some time.   \nNo  matter  how  strong  the  bills,  administrative  capacity  to  monitor  water  quality  and  control \nharmful waste discharges will continue to be limited. Nevertheless, it is important for the welfare \nof the country\u2019s urban population and the sustainability of its natural environment that the bills \nbe finalized and passed as soon as possible. A sector road map, which has been discussed and \nagreed  upon  in  principle  with  the  Government,  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  Appendix 1 \nsummary sector analysis links sector issues and project to ADB country strategy, ADB\u2019s water \npolicy, and Government development goals. \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n9. \nThe main lessons learned in similar projects in the Fiji Islands and throughout the Pacific \ninclude the need to (i) address institutional reforms including broad sector reforms as a part of \nthe project, to ensure achievement of project service delivery objectives; (ii) provide for careful \ndesign and sequencing of institutional and financial arrangements; and (iii) plan for and mitigate \nundesirable  outcomes;  clearly  identify  arrangements  for  procurement,  in  particular  for \ncontracting versus force account works, to avoid ambiguity during implementation; and ensure \nadequate counterpart funding to carry out the project on schedule. Generally, counterpart staff \nhave been suitably experienced and qualified for their assignments. Appendix 2 lists recent and \ncurrent external assistance in this sector to the Fiji Islands. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjective \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Project will contribute to the long-term goal of improving the delivery of urban water \n10. \nsupply and sewerage services in the Fiji Islands. The objectives of the Project are to (i) increase \ndelivery of safe water supply and sewerage services in the Suva\u2013Nausori area through  physical \nand institutional improvements, and (ii) enhance the sustainability of water supply and sewerage \nservices throughout the Fiji Islands by means of appropriate institutional reforms.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  outputs  will  include:  (i)  increased  supply,  delivery,  and  potable  water \n11. \nreliability in the Suva\u2013Nausori area; (ii) reduction in UFW; (iii) rehabilitated wastewater collection \nand treatment system; (iv) improvement in the adverse environmental conditions that have been \ncaused  by  inadequate  sewerage  services;  (v)  strengthened  institutions  and  legislative \n(vi) \nframeworks \nestablishment  of  an  entity  dedicated  to  provision  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  in \nmetered water supply areas, operated in manner similar to those of a commercial water supply \n\nfor  wastewater  management  and  environmental  management;  and \n\n\f5 \n\nand  sewerage  agency.  The  Project  works  are  part  of  a  water  and  sewerage  master  plan \ndeveloped  through  ADB  assistance.2  The    Project  Framework  (Appendix  3)  includes  specific \ntargets for the outputs. \n\nThe Project is divided into two parts, one for construction of water supply and sewerage \n12. \nfacilities  and  one  for  institutional  reforms  and  development.  The  first  component  (Part  A)  is \ndivided into Part A1 (water supply) and Part A2 (sewerage works). The second component (Part \nB) is the institutional reform program that provides assistance for the transition of the water and \nsewerage division of PWD to an effective independent utility agency.  \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Water Supply and Sewerage \n\nThe water supply component of the Project includes: (i) implementation of a program for \n13. \nwater  loss  reduction  comprising  leak  detection,  replacement  of  about  50  kilometers  (km)  of \nleaking  distribution  mains,  replacement  of  about  15,000  leaking  service  pipes  and  27,000 \nmalfunctioning  meters,  rehabilitation  of  the  Tamavua  main  storage  reservoirs  and  the  Upper \nWaimanu  pumping  station,  and  a  demand  management  program;  (ii)  optimization  and \naugmentation  of  the  distribution  system  comprising  installation  and  upgrading  of  pumping \nstations in four locations, construction of additional service, storage, and balance reservoirs with \na  capacity  of  about  29  megaliters  (ml),  construction  of  about  40  km  of  additional mains, and \ninstallation  of  about  13,000  new  house  connections;  (iii)  augmentation  of  water  sources, \nincluding construction of a new water supply intake and pumping station on the Rewa River, and \nconstruction  of  about  11  km  of  new  source  and  rising  mains  and  related  pump  station \nimprovements;  (iv)  augmentation  of  existing  water  treatment  plants,  including  rehabilitation  of \nmechanical facilities in the Tamavua treatment plant, construction of a new clear water reservoir \nat  Waila,  upgrading  and  installation of instrumentation systems, construction and upgrading of \nsludge and backwash facilities at Waila and Tamavua, and upgrading laboratory facilities; and \n(v)  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision.  Emphasis  is  placed  on  distribution  network \nrehabilitation  and  development  and  implementation  of  a  strong  UFW  reduction  program. \nComponents such as meter testing, meter replacement, service pipe replacement are included \nin the Project, even though they involve numerous small works, because they are essential to \nthe UFW reduction program. \n\n14. \nThe sewerage and sewage treatment component of the Project includes: (i) rehabilitation \nand  upgrading  of  existing  collection  networks,  including  I&I  rehabilitation  works,  comprising \nrehabilitation  and  replacement  of  about  8  km  of  trunk  mains,  gravity  mains,  rising  mains,  and \npump  stations;  (ii)  improvement  of  the  Kinoya  sewage  treatment  plant,  including  inlet  works, \nodor control and sludge treatment, dewatering and disposal systems; (iii) construction of about \n15  km  of  new  trunk  sewer  mains,  collectors  and  reticulation,  with  related  pumping  stations; \ninstallation  of  about  6,300  new  sewerage  connections  in  backlog  areas  and  in  presently \nunserved areas; (iv) design and implementation of a trade wastewater program; (v) upgrading of \nmaintenance  facilities  and  the  existing  national  water  quality  laboratory  at  Kinoya;  (vi) \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  improved  management  systems,  including  mapping  and \ngeographic information systems, receiving water quality monitoring, and infiltration assessment \nand related design; and (vii) detailed design and construction supervision.  Emphasis  is  placed \non  rehabilitation  works,  addressing  I&I  issues  as  well  as  the  trade  wastewater  management \nprogram. New service connections are included in the Project because they are essential to the \ndelivery  of  the  Project\u2019s  outputs.  As  with  the  water  supply  component,  installation  of  a \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 1998. Suva-Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage Project. Manila. \n\n\f6 \n\nsupervisory data control and data acquisition system is already underway and so it is excluded \nfrom the project. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent B: Institutional Reform and Development \n\n15. \nThe  institutional  reform  and  development  component  of  the  Project,  includes  (i) \nimplementation of an institutional reform action plan (IRAP) (Appendix 4) and a financial action \nplan  (Appendix  5)  aimed  at  creating  a  WSC  by  2005;  (ii)  implementation  of  a  management \ninformation reporting system facilitating well-integrated, effective and efficient water supply and \nsanitation operations; (iii) implementation of an accounting system for WSD that  provides data \non  costs  and  revenues,  by  district,  by  month,  and  for  WSC  that  provides  data  as  required  for \ncommercial  operations;  (iv)  implementation  of  agreed  recommendations  from  the  tariff  study \ncompleted  under  the  TA  associated  with  the  loan;  (v)  improvement  of  operations,  including \nprovision of consumer services and metering, adoption of water loss reduction and I&I reduction \nprograms, and mechanizing water and sewage treatment operations; (vi) upgrading of human \nresource  management  systems;  (vii)  strengthening  of  environmental  monitoring  and \nenvironmental  management  systems;  (viii)  upgrading  of  computerized  information  systems \nthrough  the  provision  of  new  hardware  and  software;  (ix)  conduct  of  a  water  awareness \nprogram; and (x) training of WSD/WSC staff. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \nAn  accompanying  TA  will  provide  support  for  development  of  a  trade  waste  program, \n16. \nhealth and safety procedures, environmental legislation and regulations, a community education \nand awareness program, and a tariff study. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nThe  proposed  IRAP  which  resulted  from  extensive  dialogue  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment provides an appropriately incremental approach to necessary institutional reforms. \nIt  is  agreed  that  the  development  of  the  WSC  requires  careful  planning  and dialogue among \nstakeholders,  including  those  in  civil  society.  The  guiding  principles  are  that  it  be  dedicated \nsolely  to  the  delivery  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  services,  well  governed,  autonomous  of \ngovernment  red  tape,  and  able  to  mobilize  the  staff  and  financial  resources  necessary  to \nprovide  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  sufficient  to  meet  demand  effectively  and \nefficiently.  To  avoid  monopoly  issues,  it  should  be  a  partly  or  wholly  government-owned \ncorporation operating with a clearly defined  social  purpose,  under  strict  regulatory  control.  In \norder to avoid unintended negative impacts, the creation of the corporation should be preceded \nby creation of a WSD dedicated to the provision of water and sewerage services, with support \nservices including, but not limited to, administration, personnel, finance, and planning.3  \n \n18. \nThe IRAP will be implemented in stages, allowing the process to carefully consider each \nstep  and  gain  the  necessary  stakeholder  support.  In  this  way,  broad  ownership  should  be \nachieved  that  will  improve  the  sustainability  of  the  reforms,  physical  improvements  completed \nunder the project and improvements in operation and maintenance management. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nThe  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  US$72.4  million, of which the foreign exchange \ncost  is  US$48.0  million  (67%)  including  US$4.7  million  in  interest  during  construction,  the \ncommitment  charge,  and  the  front-end  fee  on  the  loan;  the  local  currency  cost  is  US$24.4 \n\nCost Estimates \n\n                                                 \n3 Currently proposed structure of proposed water and sewerage department is shown in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n\f7 \n\nmillion  (33%).  The  cost  of  the  physical  components  includes  the  cost  of  land;  equipment  and \nmaterials;  civil  works;  and  consultants  for  surveys,  preparation  of  detailed  designs,  and \nconstruction  supervision.  The  cost  of  the  institutional  development  component  and  the  project \nmanagement component includes the cost of equipment and materials and consultants.

The  Government  prefers  to  provide  all  the  funding  for  the \nconsultants for detailed design and construction supervision, in order to simplify project financial \nadministration. The proposed financing plan is in Table 3 and detailed in Appendix 6.  \n\n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n(US$ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n45.9 \n2.1 \n48.0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n1.1 \n23.3 \n24.4 \n\n \n \n \n\n \nTotal \n47.0 \n25.4 \n72.4 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n% \n65% \n35% \n100% \n\n \n \n \n\nSource of Financing \n\nAsian Development Bank Loan \nGovernment \n\n \n \n \nTotal \nSource: Appraisal mission estimates. \n \n\n                                                 \n4  The loan of $47 million would be 65.0% of the cost of the Project excluding the cost of the TA. Under ADB\u2019s cost-\n\nsharing policy, Fiji is a group C country, and therefore eligible for 65% of the project cost.  \n\n\f8 \n\nThe loan will be from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, under ADB\u2019s London interbank \n21. \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility,5 a commitment charge of 0.75% on undisbursed loan balances; and a front-end fee of \n0.5%.6  The  Government  has  stated  that  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions was its own independent decision and \nwas not made in reliance on any communication or advice of ADB.   \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Works  and  Energy  (MWE)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  its \n22. \nWSD/WSC will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for the Project. Two project management units \n(PMUs) will be established within WSD/WSC, one for Part A of the Project and one for Part B \n(Supplementary Appendix D). Although the two PMUs will operate independently, they will meet \non  a  quarterly  basis  to  review  progress  and  identify  any  areas  needing  common  action.  The \nPMU  for  Part  A  will  report  to  the  head  of  the  IA  and  will  be  responsible  for  implementation \nprogramming,  selection  and  engagement  of  consultants,  procurement  of  goods  and  services, \nmanagement  of  construction,  maintenance  of  project  records,  progress  reporting,  financial \nmanagement, identification of problems and issues that may arise during implementation, staff \ntraining,  and  preparation  of  recommendations  for  adjustments  in  the  Project,  if  any.  The  PMU \nfor Part A will be headed by a project manager with suitable expertise, and experience in similar \nprojects. There will also be two assistant project managers, one for water and one for sewerage, \nas  well  as  a  senior  valuer,  a  land  acquisition  officer,  a  community  relations  officer,  an \naccountant,  and  support  staff.  Design  and  supervision  consultants  will  report  to  the  project \nmanager.    The  PMU  for  Part  B  will  report  to  the  head  of  MWE  and  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation programming, selection and engagement of consultants, procurement of goods \nand  services,  supervision  of  consultants,  maintenance  of  records,  progress  reporting, \nidentification  of  problems  and  issues  that  may  arise  during  implementation,  staff  training,  and \npreparation of recommendations for adjustments in the Project, if any. The PMU for Part B will \nbe headed by an institutional development specialist with relevant expertise and experience in \nsimilar operations. In addition, it will have an assistant institutional development manager, short-\nterm  advisors,  and  support  staff.  WSD/WSC  will  provide  the  two  PMUs  with  secretarial  and \nother support services. WSD/WSC will operate and maintain the project facilities on completion. \nThe establishment of the PMU-Works and the PMU-Reform, and the designation of each of their \nheads  \u2014acceptable  to  ADB\u2014  will  be  conditions  of  loan  effectiveness.  A  consultative  process \nwill be established under which WSD/WSC will keep members of community groups (including \nmembers  of  squatter  settlements  and  indigenous  peoples  settlements)  informed  about  the \nProject,  and  seek  their  support  in  matters  such  as  location  of  facilities,  land  acquisition,  and \nidentification of sewage overflows. \n \n23. \nA project steering committee (PSC) will be constituted from among the members of the \ncapital  works  committee,  which  was  established  during  the  preparation  of  the  master  plan  for \nthe development of water and sewerage service in the Suva\u2013Nausori area, and for the feasibility \nstudy  for  the  Project.  The  PSC  will  comprise,  but  not  be  limited  to,  representatives  of  the \n                                                 \n5 Following standard ADB practice a 5-year LIBOR swap rate (3.3% plus 0.6%) has been assumed in the financial \n\nanalysis. \n\n6  The  front-end  fee  of  0.5%  is  a  reduced  rate  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors.  In  the  event  the  loan  is  not \napproved in 2003, the front-end fee will revert to the standard rate for OCR loans as determined by the Board of \nDirectors. \n\n\f9 \n\nMinistry of Finance and National Planning, MWE, and the Lands and Survey Department. The \nPSC\u2019s prime roles are high-level coordination, particularly among government departments, and \nidentification and rectification of any issues that may arise during project implementation. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n24. \nApril 2009. The implementation schedule is given in Appendix 7. \n \n\nThe Project will be implemented over a 5-year period approximately from April 2004 to \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n25. \nCivil works contracts greater than US$2.0 million in value, and equipment and materials \nsupply  contracts  greater  than  US$500,000  in  value,  will  be  tendered  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement \ndated January 2001. Civil works contracts smaller than US$2.0 million will be undertaken under \nlocal  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Equipment  contracts  of \nUS$500,000 or less may be awarded through international shopping procedures acceptable to \nADB.  Prequalification  of  contractors  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Some small and moderate-sized works such as UFW detection and repairs; \npump  and  motor  replacement;  and  replacement  and  installation  of  new  water  and  sewerage \nservice pipes, house connections, and meters will be carried out through force account works, \nacceptable  to  ADB,  which  in  aggregate  will  have  a  value  of  not  more  than  US$5  million.  The \nforce account works would be too small and scattered to be of interest to contractors, and the IA \nhas  adequate  facilities  and  the  capability  to  undertake  the  works  expeditiously  and  at \nreasonable  cost.  Vehicles,  computers,  and  other  equipment  with  a  value  of  less  than \nUS$100,000 per item may be purchased under off-the-shelf or direct purchase procedures, the \nlatter to ensure compatibility with existing equipment. Vehicles and equipment purchased under \nthe  Project  for  use  by  PMU  staff  and  consultants  will  be  handed  over  to  the  IA  at  the  end of \nproject  implementation.  Detailed  designs  for  each  physical  component  of  the  Project  shall  be \nsubmitted to ADB for approval prior to issuance of bidding documents. Indicative procurement \npackages are in Appendix 8 and a procurement summary is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n26. \nThe Government has requested that advance procurement action be provided for (i) the \nrecruitment of urgently needed consultants for the PMU-Reform;  (ii) urgent water loss reduction \nactivities  undertaken  with  prior  approval  of  ADB;  and  (iii)  other  civil  works,  equipment  and \nmaterials for the water supply system rehabilitation and augmentation incurred under the Project \nprior  to  the  loan  effective  date.  The  Government  also  requested  that  retroactive  financing  be \nprovided  for  items  (i)  and  (ii)  procured  after  1  January  2004.  The  retroactive  financing  will \nfacilitate  project  implementation.  To  be  eligible  for  ADB  financing,  such  recruitment  and \nprocurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  dated  January  2001.  Retroactive \nfinancing will be considered for such recruitment and procurement in an amount not exceeding \nUS$1.0 million. The Government has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of the advance action \nand  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  provide  funding  for  the  Project.  MWE\u2019s \ncapacity to carry out advance action has been found adequate. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nConsulting  services  under  the  loan  will  be  provided  in  several  packages:  (i)  project \n27. \nmanagement-works;  (ii)  project  management-reform;  (iii)  water  loss  reduction,  infiltration \nassessment, mapping, environmental monitoring and computerization; and (iv) detailed design \n\n\f10 \n\nand construction supervision (multiple contracts). All of the consultants except those for project \nmanagement-works  and  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision  would  be  funded  under \nthe loan. The consultants for package (i) will be selected as individuals and the consultants for \npackages  (ii),  (iii),  and  (iv)  will  be  selected  as  firms.  For  packages  (ii)  and  (iii),  it  has  been \nagreed that consultants will be selected by MWE in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants using quality- and cost-based procedures. Package (iv) recruitment is under \nway;  consultants  are  being  selected  by  MWE  through  a  process  of  international  quality  and \ncost-based selection, similar to that of ADB except that shortlisting was not used. For package \n(i)  and  (iv),  ADB  and  the  Government  will  agree  on  the  terms  of  reference  prior  to  consultant \nrecruitment.  For  package  (iv),  the  invitation  materials,  the  draft  contract,  the  results  of  the \nevaluation and the proposals of the first-ranked consultants will be provided to ADB for review \nbefore  contract  signing.  For  package  (i),  a  list  of  the  candidates,  their  qualifications,  the \nevaluation  of  their  qualifications,  and  the  draft  contract  will  be  furnished  to  ADB  for  review \nbefore  contract  negotiations,  and  ADB  will  be  provided  with  a  copy  of  the  signed  contract. \nAppendix 9 gives the summary res ponsibilities for consultants and summary terms of reference \nare in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n\n6. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n28. \nAlthough  project  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  requirements  are  not  considered  to \nbe significant by the standards of ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, there is still enough \nuncertainty in land acquisition requirements, particularly for sewerage, that land acquisition and \nresettlement needs must be monitored carefully. Preliminary sites have been selected  for water \nsupply  reservoirs  and  pumping  stations,  and  PWD  has  made  preliminary  enquiries  with  the \nLands and Survey Department to ascertain land status and availability. About 20 hectares (ha) \nof land will be permanently required for the construction of access roads, water supply pumping \nstations,  service  reservoirs,  and  intake  works,  and  about  4  ha  of  land  will  be  temporarily \nrequired for the construction of a main water supply pipeline from the proposed Rewa pumping \nstation  to  the  Waila  water  treatment  plant.  For  the  water  supply  component,  permanent \nresettlement  of  approximately  five  households  (about  30  persons)  will  be  required.    For  the \nsewage  component,  which  is  less  extensive,  but  more  focused  on  densely  built-up  areas, \nresettlement of about the same number of households and persons could be expected. \n \n29. \nThe  Government\u2019s  procedures  for  acquiring  land,  compensating  landowners,  and \ndealing  with  resettlement  issues  are  described  in  a  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Plan \n(RP), presented in Supplementary Appendix G and summarized in Appendix 10. It was agreed \nthat  the  Government  will  ensure  that  all  land  and  rights-of-way  required  by  the  Project  will  be \nmade  available  in  a  timely  manner  and  that  the  provisions  of  the  RP,  including  compensation \nand  entitlements  for  affected  persons,  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable \nlaws and regulations, and with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement,  following procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  A  community  relations  officer  in  the  PMU  will  assist in community liaison, \nland  acquisition,  and  resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  sufficient \ncounterpart  funds  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  and  meet  any  obligations  in \nexcess of the RP\u2019s budget estimate. The Government will ensure that resettled persons will be \nat least as well off as they would have been in the absence of the Project. Adequate staff and \nresources  will  be  committed  to  supervision  and  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan. The plan will be updated regularly to reflect any significant material changes \nof the project scope or other causes, and such changes will be subject to ADB approval. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n30. \n\nDisbursements  for  contracts  awarded  under  ICB  and  LCB  procedures,  as  well  as  for \n\n\f11 \n\ncontracts for consulting services, will be by ADB\u2019s direct payment or reimbursement procedures.  \nAll disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated 2001 \nand  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  ADB  will  not  provide \nfunding  for  civil  works  unless  consultants  acceptable  to  ADB  are  recruited  or  unless  staff \nacceptable to ADB are designated to provide for construction supervision.   \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n31.  MWE  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Project,  and  will  have  the \nproject  accounts  and  financial  statements,  audited  annually  by  independent  private  auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  project  accountant,  engaged  under  the  PMU-Works,  will  have \nexperience  in  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  project  accounting  and  audit  procedures.  MWE  will \nprovide ADB with copies of the audited project accounts and financial statements no later than 9 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. MWE will provide ADB with quarterly \nprogress reports on project implementation. Within 3 months of the physical completion of the \nProject,  MWE  will  provide  ADB  with  a  project  completion  report.  Progress  reports  will  be \ncompiled by the two PMUs, and consolidated by the PMU-Works. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nIn  consultation  with  ADB,  the  two  PMUs  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project \n32. \nperformance  monitoring  system  expanding  on  the  project  framework.  Project  performance \nreports will be included in both PMUs\u2019 regular project reporting procedures, and will indicate the \nprogress made in meeting national institutional performance targets, as well as physical targets \nfor  the  project  area.  Performance  indicators  will  include  but  not  limited  to, populations served, \navailability  of  water  supplies,  UFW,  billing  and  collection  efficiency,  degree  of  completion  of \ndetailed  design  work,  award  of  contracts,  disbursements  and  cost  recovery.    The  proposed \nproject performance monitoring system is described in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n33. \nADB will carry out regular reviews of the progress of the Project in conjunction with the \nPMUs, at least twice per year. Reviews will include progress of policy and institutional reforms, \nas well as of physical works. Reviews will particularly focus on project performance indicators. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  carry  out  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  approximately  2.5 \nyears after project implementation begins. The midterm review will include a review of progress \ntoward achieving the Project\u2019s policy and institutional objectives, as well as progress in physical \ncomponents, procurement arrangements, disbursement arrangements, the performance of the \nPMUs, and the performance of project consultants. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n34. \nADB will provide an associated TA for institutional development and capacity building in \nWSD/WSC. The TA will enhance water and sewerage management by improvements in trade \nwaste  management,  tariffs,  environmental  management,  health  and  safety,  and  community \nawareness of water issues. It will produce the following outputs: (i) water sewerage tariffs study; \n(ii)  a  trade  waste  program;  (iii)  a  health  and  safety  system  for  WSD/WSC;  (iv)  environmental \nlegislation and/or regulations recommendations; and (v) a community awareness and education \nprogram, with training products and course materials for incorporation in school and community \neducation curricula.  A TA framework is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n\n\f12 \n\nlegislation  and \n\ntrade  wastes;  development  of \n\nThe trade waste program will include an assessment of the source, quality, and quantity \n35. \nof \nregulations;  and  preparation  of \nrecommendations  for  an  action  plan  to  effectively  control  and  manage  trade  wastes.  \nEnvironmental  legislation  advice  and  recommendations  will  support  the  finalization  of  the \nSustainable Development Bill, the Public Health and Pollution Control Bill, and for preparation of \nambient and discharge standards and implementing regulations. The health and safety system \nwill be comprehensive. The development of community education and awareness materials will \ninclude subjects such as water conservation, water handling, sanitation, water-related diseases, \ncivic  awareness,  and  other  related  topics.  Although  the  TA  will  be  community-wide,  the \ncommunity  awareness  component  will  have  a  subcomponent  focused  on  slum  and  squatter \nsettlements. The tariff study will identify tariff needs for acceptable levels of cost recovery, cost \nrecovery mechanisms, tariff structures, and implementation mechanisms, as required to achieve \ncommercial operations and meet debt servicing requirements for the Nadi\u2013Lautoka and Suva\u2013\nNausori  systems.  The  tariff  study  will  ensure  that  any  proposals  are  affordable  and  consistent \nwith current government policies. MWE will be the Executing Agency for the TA, which will be \ncarried  out  over  a  1-year  period  starting  in  July  2004  and  finishing  at  end  of  July  2005. \nConsulting services will comprise 26 person-months of international consulting services and 27 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  a  firm \nthrough a process of quality- and cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants.  The  following  specialists  will  be  required:  tariff specialist, community \neducation  specialist,  environmental  legislation  advisor,  trade  waste  specialist,  public  relations \nspecialist,  health  and  safety  specialist,  environmental  management  specialist,  and \nenvironmental  engineer.  Reporting  will  include  a  brief  inception  report  that  focuses  on  any \nnecessary  changes  to  the  scope  of  work  or  work  program,  and  interim,  draft  final,  and  final \nreports.  In  addition,  each  consultant  will  be  required  to  produce  draft  final  reports  relevant  to \ntheir  inputs  for  discussion  with  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  stakeholders,  with  the  final \nreport to be submitted within 1 month of receipt of comments from ADB and the Government. \nConsultants will also prepare briefing papers for periodic consultation workshops.  \n \n36. \nThe  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  US$978,000  comprising  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of \nUS$661,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  US$317,000.  ADB,  through  its  TA  funding  program, \nwill  finance  US$783,000,  on  a  grant  basis,  for  the  entire  foreign  costs  of  US$661,000  and \nUS$122,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The consultants\u2019 summary terms of reference \nand detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 11.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\n \nA. \n \n37. \nThe project area extends for about 25 km from industrial areas around Lami to the west \nSuva, to rural areas around Nausori in the east. It is home to over 262,000 people or about one-\nthird of the country\u2019s total population and almost 60% of its urban population. With in-migration \nfrom other areas of the country, the population is expected to increase at about 3% per annum.  \n \nThere  are  high  socioeconomic  benefits  associated  with  the  Project.  The  benefits  from \n38. \nthe  investments  made  in  water  include  meeting  suppressed  demand  of  existing  domestic and \ncommercial customers, avoiding further deterioration of the system, avoiding tankering of water \nand conserving water through better demand management. The benefits from the investments \nin  sewerage  include  smaller  housing  plot  sizes  for  residential development under Suva town \nplanning  codes,  increased  economies  of  land  use  and  avoidance  of  the  costs  of  constructing \nand maintaining septic tanks. The discharge of raw sewage, has damaged the environment to \n\n\f13 \n\nthe  detriment  of  all  residents  and  visitors.  This degradation has negative effects on residents\u2019 \nability  to  continue  to  enjoy  the  use  of  the  rivers  and  harbor  areas,  and  it  could  detract  further \nfrom Suva\u2019s tourist potential. The development of improved water supply and sewerage services \nwill  contribute  to  reducing  health  risks,  especially  for  the  poor  households  in  informal  squatter \nsettlements.  Increases  in  water  and  sewerage  tariffs  will  be  held  in  check  through  efficiency \nimprovements  in  water  and  sewerage  operations.  The  poor  will  benefit  more  than  others \nbecause they will be protected by maintaining a lifeline block for basic water needs. \n \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n39. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for water was calculated for the Project and \nfor the master plan with  and  without  tariff  increases.  Quantified  benefits  included  the  value  of \nmeeting suppressed demand and the demand of new customers, saved cost of water tankering, \nsaved  cost  of  small  systems  absorbed  into  the  larger  area,  the  value  of  incremental  UFW \nactually  supplied  to  consumers,  and  the  value  of  connection  revenues.  Replacement  and \nrehabilitation of assets was provided at 2.5% of total capital costs every 5 years. The resulting \nEIRR was 26.2% for the Project, 24.9% for the master plan without a tariff increase, and 21.4% \nfor the master plan with a tariff increase, which results in decreased consumption.   \n \n40. \nAn  EIRR  for  sewerage  was  calculated  for  the  master  plan.  Since  I&I  has  not  been \nquantified, and the benefits of I&I reduction would pertain more to the Project than to the master \nplan,  this  could  be  expected  to  yield  a  conservative  result  lower  than  that  for  the  Project. \nQuantified benefits included land value, value increases in areas provided with sewerage, plus \nthe  avoided  cost  of  constructing  and  deluding  septic  tanks.  Replacement  of  rehabilitation  of \nassets was provided at 2.5% of capital costs every 5 years. The resulting EIRR for the master \nplan  was  9.8%,  which  is  reasonable  given  that  because  of  lack  of  data  it  was  not  possible  to \ncalculate  either  the  value  of  improved  receiving  water  and  environmental  quality  in  areas \naffected by water and environmental quality changes or the cost savings due to decreased I&I. \nThe EIRR for the water and sewerage master plans combined, assuming a water tariff increase \nthat  would  decrease  consumption,  was  18.5%;  this  result  provides  a  strong  economic \njustification for the Project. Details can be found in Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix J.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty  \n\n41. \nA  detailed  poverty  assessment  carried  out  in  parallel  with  project  processing  has \nconfirmed that in 2002 more than 27% of the population of the project area are poor, meaning \nthat their incomes are insufficient to meet basic needs. Such households may have enough to \neat but be unable to provide schooling for their children or health care for their sick. Urban Indo-\nFijians  suffer  from  a  slightly  higher  amount  of  poverty  (31%)  although  ethnic  Fijians  are  close \nbehind  (27%).  The  incidence  of  urban  poverty  has  increased  since  the  mid-1990s, due to  the \nslowdown  of  the  sugar  economy  and  lack  of  urban  job  creation;  unemployment  increased  by \n122%  between  1996  and  2002.  Although  some  urban  poor  may  live  in  small  formal  housing, \nabout  half  of  them  live  in  informal  and  squatter  settlements.7  Although  many  informal  and \nsquatter settlements have piped water available to them, it is often available to only a few of the \nresidents  and  the  others  must  share.  Few  informal  and  squatter  settlements  have  sewerage \nfacilities, and suffer from poor sanitation as well as create pollution for others. Pit latrines, water \nseal toilets, and some flush toilets to septic tanks are the main types of toilets in such areas. A \n\n                                                 \n7    An  informal  settlement  is  one  in  which  occupation  rights  have  been  given  by  the  landowner  but  the  rights  of  the \noccupant  have  not  been  recorded.  A  squatter  settlement  is  one in which occupation rights have not been given. \nMost squatter settlements are on marginal and/or state-owned land. \n\n\f14 \n\nparticipatory hardship assessment carried out in 2002 revealed that people in such areas gave \nwater  supplies  a  high  priority.  Even  those  with  taps  experienced  frequent  service  interruptions \nand those without taps were anxious to be connected. Where shared connections were used, \npeople  were  often  paying  significantly  more  for  their  water  taps  since  the  stepped  tariff \ndiscriminates against large users. Many people in such areas rely on surface and well water for \nnondrinking  purposes,  that  is  frequently  contaminated,  raising  the  risk  of  illness.  Lack  of \nsewerage is a serious problem, particularly in the low-lying informal and squatter communities.  \n \nAlthough the Government has a policy of providing metered water supply connections to \n42. \nindividual  dwellings  in  informal  settlement  areas,  such  connections  require  the  landowner\u2019s \npermission, which often takes time or is difficult to secure. The Government also has a program \nfor  regularizing  squatter  settlements,  but  it  depends  upon  assessments  of  the  suitability  of \nregularizing each settlement. In cases where the settlement has not been regularized or will not \nbe regularized, a few occupants will usually succeed in getting a water connection but they do \nso despite lacking the required documentation (an occupancy permit and a building permit). To \naddress  these  problems,  the  IA  will  prepare  a  program  to  improve  the  provision  of  water  and \nsewerage in poor communities and submit it to ADB for review.  \n \n43. \nThe  Project\u2019s  water  supply  component  will  help  reduce  health  risks,  such  as  infantile \ndiarrhea, that are due to the lack of water and contamination of water arising from low pressure \nin the piped system. It will also provide water for cooking, washing, and bathing, and reduce the \ncost of boiling water. Improvements to sewage disposal to prevent contamination of waterways \nwill benefit the poorest that live  in swampy, low-lying, poorly draining areas near the coast such \nas in Vatuwaqa and the Samabula River. These communities use these waterways for fishing \nand  supplementing  their  food  sources.  The  environmental  benefits  of  the  Project\u2019s  sewerage \ncomponent will improve the quality of life for the poorest people. \n \n44. \nA  quantitative  assessment  was  carried  out  of  the  Project\u2019s  net  benefit  distribution. \nSeveral  stakeholder  groups  were  identified,  of  which  the  poor  were  one,  and  the  Project\u2019s  net \neconomic benefits to them were estimated, as calculated in the economic analysis described in \nparagraphs  39  and  40,  less  any  changes  in  the  cost  to  the  poor  of  the  improved  services.  In \naggregate,  the  water  and  sewerage  components  of  the  Project  generate  total  net economic \nbenefits of about US$40 million, of which it is estimated that about US$14 million will accrue to \nthe  poor.  This  gives  a  combined  project  poverty  impact  ratio  of  35%,  which  is  above  the \nproportion of poor households and substantially above the proportion of poor household income \nin the project area. The sewerage component yields more than half the net benefits, underlining \nthe importance of implementing sewerage improvements as well as water supply improvements \nin such communities. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13 and a \npoverty impact assessment is in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial  Aspects \n\n45. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the water supply part of the project is 4.0% \nwith  present  tariffs.  Since  the  effects  of  the  short-term  sewerage  investment  cannot  be \nseparately identified, it is not possible to provide an estimate for the FIRR of the combined water \nand sewerage project. The net financial flows for the water supply and sewerage master plans \nwere combined to provide an FIRR for the overall master plan. The master plan FIRR is 3.1% \nwith present tariffs and 5.6% with a 60% tariff increase in 2006 required to set the overall FIRR \nequal to the weighted average cost of capital. Corporatization requires a reasonable prospect of \nsuch  a  tariff  increase,  and  will  require  an  explicit  subsidy  payment  from  the  Government  until \nprofitability  is  achieved.  For  long-term  sustainability  of  the  master  plan,  as  well  as  from  the \n\n\f15 \n\nstandpoint of long term sustainability of water and sewerage operations it will be necessary to \ndouble the water tariff and triple the sewerage tariff.8  \n \n46. \nSeveral options are available to allow such tariff increases without causing affordability \nproblems. In the case of water, the present tariff for nondomestic customers is only about half of \nfull  costs  and  could  be  increased  without  causing  economic  distortion.  The  size  of  the  first \nlifeline domestic supply block could be reduced provided that arrangements are made to ensure \nthat  needy  households  sharing  a  water  connection  are  not  unduly  penalized.  In  the  case  of \nsewerage, the tariff should be restructured to be similar to the water tariff. Such changes could \ngenerate the increase in revenues required for commercial operations without creating hardship \nfor existing consumers. For a population already spending substantial amounts for bottled and \ntankered  water,  it  can  be  expected  that  willingness  to  pay  will  exist  provided  the  services \nprovided  are  of  suitable  quality.  Tariffs  at  the  levels  proposed  are  affordable  for  both  average \nand low-income households. In  2008, the expected tariffs represent a water and sewerage bill \nequivalent to 2.6% of the income of an average household, a moderate increase as compared \nwith the current level of 1.4%. For a low-income household, when the basic needs covered by \nthe lifeline block (equivalent to consumption of about 60 liters per capita per day) are met, the \nwater and sewerage charges will amount to 1.5% of income in 2008, as compared  to 0.9% in \n2001. An internationally acceptable level of affordability for water and sewerage is regarded as \n3\u20135% of monthly household income, indicating that the proposed tariffs are affordable.  \n \nB. \n \n\nSocial and Environmental Impacts \n\n1. \n\nSocial \n\n \n47. \nThe Project will have a positive social impact. The risk of waterborne disease outbreaks \nwill  be  decreased.  More  reliable  and  improved  water  supplies  will  be  provided  to  almost  all \nresidents and industries; the latter will lead to improved production and economic stability. The \ntrade waste policy, industrial discharge connections, and sewerage system upgrading will result \nin cleaner waterways and an improved quality of life. Communities will be better informed about \nwater  and  sanitation  issues,  and  improved  operational  performance  will  result  from  such \nawareness.  There  will  be  improved  public  confidence  in  the  provision  of  water  supply  and \nsewerage  services.  Although  there  will  be  increased  tariff  charges  for  average  water  and \nsewerage  users,  the  poor  will  be  protected  through  maintaining  a  small  lifeline  block,  and \nincreased tariff charges will be offset by reduced taxes. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironment \n\n48. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  benefit  to  the  environment  through  (i)  substantial \nreduction  of  sewage  entering  the  groundwater,  streams,  and  the  sea  due  to  inadequate \ntreatment  in  septic  tanks;  (ii)  substantial  reduction  of  sewage  pump  station  failures  and \nconsequent  overflows,  which  often  seriously  affect  low-lying communities near coastal waters; \nand  (iii)  provision  of  sludge  treatment  facilities  at  the  two  project  WTP.  Altogether,  these \nimprovements will help to alleviate serious pollution of streams, drains, and coastal waters in the \nproject  area.  Improvements  in  coastal  water  quality  are  closely  linked  to  the  extension of the \nsewage outfall that is being funded by the European Union, and assurances have been included \nto ensure reporting on the progress of outfall completion. Sustainable improvements in stream, \nground, and marine water quality will be supported through assurances for the enactment of key \nenvironmental legislation, including the Sustainable Development Bill and the Public Health and \n\n                                                 \n8 Detailed financial projections are included in Supplementary Appendix L. \n\n\f16 \n\nPollution Control Bill, or other legal measures that will help clarify and strengthen the basis for \nregulation and control of waste discharges. The strengthening of PWD\u2019s water quality laboratory \nand improvement of PWD\u2019s environmental guidelines will help ensure the monitoring of project \nimpacts and benefits, including the sustainability of water quality benefits. \n \n49. \nThe initial environmental examination (IEE) completed under the feasibility study and the \nupdated  assessment  during  appraisal,  the  recommendations  of  which  are  summarized  in \nAppendix  14,  concluded  that  the  Project  would  have  these  environmental  benefits  but  also \nnoted potential negative impacts may be experienced due to increased water withdrawals from \nthe Rewa River. However, it is expected that these impacts would be minor, however, since the \ndata  used  in  the  modeling  and  assessment  was  very  limited,  this  issue  will  require  further \nassessment during detailed design. Negative impacts, such as erosion and sedimentation, are \npossible    during  construction  works,  but  can  be  mitigated  through  standard  engineering  and \nenvironmental control practices. An updated environmental assessment will be prepared for all \ncomponents  during  detailed  design  to  confirm  the  conclusions  of  the  IEE  and  develop \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs), satisfactory to ADB, for each project component and \nthe  overall  Project.  Particular  attention  will  be  given  to  the  Rewa  River  intake  works  and  the \nsludge  treatment  and  disposal  facilities  at  the  two  WTP.  Disbursement  of  funds  for  these \ncomponents  will  require  detailed  environmental  examinations  and  EMPs  acceptable  to  ADB. \nProject  environment  monitoring  will  be  provided  by  MWE  through  its  own  staff,  civil  works \nsupervision  consultants,  and  an  environmental  monitoring  consultancy.  MWE  will  ensure  that \nthe  Project  is  implemented  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner,  in  accordance  with  the \nrecommendations of the summary IEE, updated EMPs and all applicable laws of the Fiji Islands, \nADB\u2019s Environmental Policy, and ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines from 2003. The \nfull summary IEE is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n\n3. \n\nGender \n\nRisks \n\nLack of water places an extra burden on women and children by adding to their workload \n50. \nin the collection and storage of water. Women are most inconvenienced by intermittent cuts in \nwater supply. In both indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian cultures, women are at the center of the \ndomestic sphere with prime responsibility for water and sanitation at home. They are principal \ncarers  for  children  and  have  control  over  food  preparation,  bathing,  toileting,  and  hygiene  of \nthese  children.  Thus,  the  Project  will  have  a  profound  effect  on  women  in  terms  of  improving \nenvironmental  conditions,  improving  water  supply,  and  improving  their  and  their  children\u2019s \nhealth conditions. The community education and awareness program also targets women.  \n \nC. \n \n51. \nInstitutional reforms are necessary in order to provide the quality and quantity of water \nand  sewerage  services  proposed  and  to  sustain  the  project  facilities.  However,  many  of  the \nreforms to be implemented under the Project have been under discussion for at least 5 years, \nand the corporatization of water supply and sewerage services, actually begun in 1998, was first \npostponed by the government in power in mid-1999, and then halted by the present government \nin  late  2001.  Since  then,  the  Government  has  put  the  corporatization  of  water  supply  and \nsewerage into its strategic plan for 2003-2005, while also expressing a strong desire to maintain \naccessibility to water and sewerage services, avoid tariff increases until services are improved, \nand  avoid  redundancies.  The  success  of  the  Project  will  depend  upon  the  thoroughness  with \nwhich institutional reforms are prepared and Government commitment to the reforms. \n \n52. \nImproved cost recovery and improved operations and maintenance are closely linked to \nthe institutional reforms. It is important that the management of WSD/WSC receive the political \n\n\f17 \n\nsupport  and  the  autonomy  necessary  to  operate  more  efficaciously.  Operations  and \nmaintenance improvements are essential to reducing UFW, the high level of which contributes \nto financial inefficiency. Tariff increases are necessary to sustainably operate and maintain the \nsystem. A tariff study is included in the Project to reduce the risk that the Government will not \nraise  tariffs  by  providing  recommendations  that  address  all  aspects of tariff systems, including \nnecessary cost recovery levels, cost recovery systems and mechanisms to implement them, as \nwell  as  systems  for  the  Government  to  meet  social  obligations  for  affordable  water  and \nsewerage services where these otherwise may not be commercially viable. \n \n53. \nImproved  environmental  management  is  necessary  to  effectively  manage  sewage  and \nother  pollution  sources  and  improve  environmental  quality.  The  public  awareness  program, \nenvironmental  legislation  assistance,  and  trade  waste  study  included  under  the  Project  will \nmitigate  risk  of  Government  reducing  its  current  efforts  to  promulgate  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment  and  Public  Health  and  Pollution  Control  Bills.  The  awareness  programs  and  the \nenvironmental  monitoring  program  together  with  the  further  environmental  requirements \nincluded  in  the  detailed  design  and  construction  phases  will  prevent  or  mitigate  potential  risks \nassociated with the water intake and water treatment plant sludge disposal system. \n \n54. \nThe  Government\u2019s  limited  familiarity  with  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  quality-  cost-based \nselection  procedures  and  PWD  water  and  sewerage  division\u2019s  lack  of  recent  experience  with \nADB\u2019s  procurement  procedures  could  result  in  delays  in  the  early  phases  of  implementation. \nThis  risk  has  been  mitigated  through  relevant  discussions  during  Appraisal  and  provision  of \nguidelines. A project implementation seminar in the Fiji Islands for the EA is also planned. \n \nD. \n\nOverall Assessment \n\n55.  While there are substantial risks associated  with the Project, resources have been built \ninto  the  project  to  avoid  them.  Political  commitment  will  be  a  key  component  in  risk  reduction, \nand  this  depends  on  a  clear  and  consistent  presentation  of  the  rationale  and  sequencing  of \nproject reforms. From the available evidence the Project benefits will outweigh the costs and the \nProject  sufficient  robust  to  be  beneficial  under  the  likelihood  of  various  risk  occurring.  The \nProject contributes to ADB\u2019s strategy for the Fiji Islands and its development goals.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n56. \nassurances which are incorporated into the Loan Agreement: \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n\nThe Government will comply with, or cause PWD/WSD/WSC to comply with, the \nIRAP, as endorsed by Government\u2019s Cabinet of Ministries on 5 November 2003, \nin particular, \n\n(a)  by  30  June  2004,  the  Government  will  have  appointed  WSD\u2019s  advisory \n\nboard; \n\n(b)  By  1  July  2004,  WSD  will  have  developed  a  staffing  plan  for  WSD  with \nposition  descriptions \nfor  senior  staff,  resourcing  strategies,  position \nevaluations  and  redeployment  plans;  and,  by  1  July  2004,  WSD  and  the \nBorrower\u2019s  Public  Service  Commission  will  have  entered  into  a  senior \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nofficer\u2019s employment agreement, based on key performance indicators, with \nevery senior WSD officer. \n\n(c)  by 30 September 2004, the Government will have completed the separation \nof  those  units,  staff,  assets,  and  records  currently  within  PWD  that  will \nmake up the new WSD;  \n\n(d)  by  30  June  2005,  the  Government  will  have  submitted  to  Cabinet  a \nmemorandum  reviewing  the  progress  of  reorganization  to  that  date,  and \noutlining the further steps to corporatization; and  \n\n(e)  by  30  September  2005,  the  Government  will  have  submitted  to  Cabinet  a \nmemorandum  presenting  for  approval  the  charter,  organization  plan, \nstaffing plan, outline chart of accounts, management information reporting \nsystem,  and  the  financing  and  regulatory  arrangements  for  WSC.  The \nGovernment will cause Cabinet consideration of this cabinet memorandum \nto take place not later than 31 December 2005. \n\nTo ensure transparency and accountability, WSD/WSC will make available to the \npublic its annual corporate plan within 3 months after the commencement of each \nyear,  and  its  annual  report  and  financial  statements  within  6  months  after \ncompletion of each year. The results of the tariff study will also be made public, \nso that the community is prepared for these increases. \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe following operational improvements will be under taken: \n\n(a)  The Government will cause WSD/WSC to establish client services units in \neach  major  service  area,  with  the  objective  of  responding  to  all  customer \ncomplaints.  WSD/WSC  will  respond  to  any  such  complaints  involving \ninterruptions of services, leaks, or blockage of sewage within 48 hours, and \ncomplaints  involving  errors  in  bills  and  similar  matters  within  30  days. \nWSD/WSC  will  establish  the  client  services  unit  in  the  Suva-Nausori area \nby not later than 31 December 2004. \n\n(b)  By  1  July  2004  and  continuing  thereafter,  WSD/WSC  will  undertake  a \nprogram of community awareness of water issues, including water demand \nmanagement, water handling, waterborne disease, and sanitation. \n\n(c)  WSD/WSC  will  undertake  a  program  for  provision  of  water  supply  and \nsewerage services in poor urban and rural communities, including squatter \nsettlements.  The  program  will  aim  at  universal  access  to  water  and \nsewerage services at cost levels affordable and acceptable to the poor. The \nprogram will be provided to ADB for review by 31 December 2004. \n\n(d)  By  31  January  2004,  PWD/WSD  will  have  adopted a water loss reduction \nprogram  satisfactory  to  ADB,  providing  for  reduction  of  UFW  in  the  Suva\u2013\nNausori area to not more than 30% by 31 December 2007.  \n\n(e)  The Government will ensure (a) by 31 December 2005, the implementation \nof a sewer rehabilitation program designed to reduce inflows and infiltration; \nand  (b)  by  31  December  2006,  the  implementation  of  a  trade  waste \nprogram  with  a  discharge  permit  system  to  cover  all  non-domestic \ndischarges  to  wastewater  system  with  adequate  standards,  appropriate \ntreatment requirements, and monitoring and enforcement provisions.   \n\n(f)  The  Government  will  develop  and  implement  a  long-term  program  for \n\n\f \n\n(iv) \n \n\n19 \n\nmonitoring  the  quality  of  receiving  waters  and  the  aquatic  biological \nenvironment affected by the Project.  \n\n(g)  The  Government  will,  through  its  regular  quarterly  reports,  keep  ADB \napprised  of  progress  on  the  extension  of  the  Kinoya  sewage  outfall,  and \ninform  ADB  of  any  delays,  changes,  or  problems  that  could  affect  the \nperformance of the Project. \n\nThe following financial management improvements will be undertaken: \n\n(a)  The Government will cause WSD to set up an accounting system, following \nexisting  government  accounting  procedures,  which  will  provide  data  on \ncosts  and  revenues  by  district  by  month.  Overhead  costs  will  be  reported \nseparately  and  allocated  in  the  management  information  reporting  system \nto be set up under the Project. \n\n(b)  The  Government  will  cause  WSD/WSC  to  conduct  a  tariff  study  that  will \nconsider and agree appropriate levels of cost recovery and mechanisms for \ncost  recovery  systems,  including  means  for  the  Borrower  to  meet  social \nobligations  for  affordable  water  supply  and  sewerage,  consider  and  agree \nappropriate tariffs to ensure that poor families sharing a connection are not \npenalized  by  high  block  rates,  and  review  and  discuss  existing  demand \nforecasts. The Borrower will ensure this report is released to the public.  \n\n(c)  Beginning from 1 January 2004, PWD/WSD will establish a debt collection \nunit  to  enforce  a  disconnection  policy  with  the  objective  of  reducing  the \noutstanding debts to 90 days by 31 December 2004, and to 60 days by 31 \nDecember 2005.  Disconnections will be initiated when a water or sewerage \nbill is more than 30 days in arrears, and will be carried out within 30 days of \nbeing ordered, in line with prevailing government regulations. \n\n(d)  By 30 April 2005, WSD will establish an accounting system able to produce \nan \nflow/flow-of-funds \nstatements  following  accrual  accounting  procedures  and  other  generally \naccepted accounting policies. \n\nincome  statement,  balance  sheet,  and  cash \n\n(e)  By  31  December  2007, \n\nresults  and \nrecommendations of the tariff study, the Government will cause WSD/WSC \nthrough improvements in operations and financial management to achieve \nrecovery of the costs of operations, maintenance and debt service. \n\ninto  account \n\ntaking \n\nthe \n\n \n\n(f)  WSC,  once  established,  will  operate  in  a  financially  sustainable  manner, \nwithin  a  social  policy  and  regulatory  framework  established  by  the \nGovernment. To the extent that WSD agrees to undertake social services, \nand these require subsidies, these will be subsidized by the Government. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure,  and  will  cause  MWE,  WSD  and/or  WSC  as  the \ncase  may  be  to  ensure,  that  the  Project  facilities  are  designed,  constructed, \noperated,  maintained  and  monitored  in  strict  conformity  with:  (a)  all  applicable \ngovernment laws, regulations, permits and approvals, including national and local \nenvironmental protection, social development, health, labor, child protection, and \noccupational  safety  regulations  and  standards;  (b)  all  mitigation  and  monitoring \nmeasures detailed in the various environmental assessments and plans relating \nto  the  Project,  e.g.,  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  and  all  relevant \n\n \n (v) \n\n\f20 \n\nenvironmental  assessments  (EAs)  and  environmental  management  plans \n(EMPs);  and  (c)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines, 2003. \n\n \n(vi)  Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing:  (a)  the  Government  will  ensure \nthat  during  the  detailed  design  stage  of  the  Project,  EAs  and  EMPs,  all \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  are  completed  for  each  phase  of  the  Project;  (b)  the  \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  environmental  mitigation  measures  identified  as  a \nresult  of  the  IEE,  EAs  or  EMPs  are  incorporated  as  relevant  into  the  various \ndesign  and  bidding  documents,  and  later  into  each contract of works under the \nProject;  (c)  with  regard  to  the  water  and  environmental  monitoring  referred  to   \nabove,  the  Government  will  cause  the  water  and  environmental  monitoring \nprogram  to  be  undertaken  under  the  guidance  and  supervision  of  the \nEnvironment Department and the Health Department and will ensure monitoring \ninformation is included in project progress reports submitted to ADB; and  \n\nThe  Government  will  complete  passage  of  the  Public  Health  and  Pollution \nControl Bill and the Sustainable Development Bill by 30 June 2005 or effect other \nlegal measures needed to achieve the sewage system connection, trade waste \nmanagement,  watershed  protection,  water  quality  standards,  and  environmental \nmonitoring programs required under the Project.  \n\n \n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  land  and  rights-of-way  required  for  the \nProject  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner,  and  that  the  provisions  of  a \nland acquisition and resettlement plan, including compensation and entitlements \nfor affected persons, will be implemented in accordance with all applicable laws \nand  regulations,  and  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB.  The  plan  will  be  revised  and \nupdated  based  on  detailed  designs  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \napproval before implementation of the related physical works. \n\n \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\nB. \n\n \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n57. \nApproval of the organization and staffing plan for WSD acceptable to ADB by the Public \nService  Commission;  designation  of  the  head  of  WSD,  who  will  be  suitably  qualified  and \nexperienced  for  the  position;  the  establishment  of  a  PMU-Works  and  a  PMU-Reform, with in \neach case a designated head acceptable to ADB; and appointment of the change manager to \noversee the reform process within PWD/WSD will be conditions of loan effectiveness. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n58. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB a+nd recommend that the Board approve the loan of US$47,000,000 to the Republic of the \nFiji  Islands  for  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n \n  20 November 2003 \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY SECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction and Scope \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  relevant  sub-sectors  in  the  analysis  included  water  supply  and  urban  wastewater \nmanagement.  This  appendix  briefly  summarizes  the  status  of  the  subsectors,  including  (i) \nrelevance to ADB\u2019s Water Policy and country strategy; (ii) indicators, such as environmental quality \nand access to sanitation; and, (iii) institutional framework. Appendix 4, Institutional Reform Action \nPlan,  Supplementary  Appendix  A,  Demand  Assessment,  and  Supplementary  Appendix  B,  Sector \nRoadmap provide the relevant details for indicators and necessary institutional, legislative, policies \ntechnical, planning needs, and action plans.  \n \nB. \n\nADB Sector Focus and Country Strategy and Program \n\nADB's  Water  Policy  supports  integrated  water  resource  management  improved  and \n2. \nexpanded  delivery  of  water  services,  foster  cooperation  and  awareness,  promote  regional \ncooperation, facilitate the exchange information and improve governance. It further emphasizes the \nneed for autonomous management of water utilities, cost recovery and private sector participation \nwhile ensuring access and equitable service to the poor and vulnerable. The Country Strategy and \nProgram for Fiji aims at promoting economic growth and improve the quality of life, especially for \nthose  left  behind  or  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  or  natural disasters. The strategy is consistent \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  strategic  development  plan  for  2003-2005.  ADB  will  focus  on  public \ninvestment in physical infrastructure in key sectors, strengthen associated policy institutional and \nregulatory  framework  frameworks, and promote private sector participation in public enterprises. \nThe  CSP  update  is  well  aligned  with  the  millennium  development  goals.  The  project  supports \nADB\u2019s strategy for the Fiji Islands and the ADB Water Policy through (i) fostering good water and \nenvironment governance; (ii) improving living conditions and, (iii) at promoting private sector growth \nimproved environmental infrastructure. \n \nC. \n\nIndicators \n\nA  large  majority  of  the  population  (50%)  have  access  to  potable  water.  And  75%  has \n3. \naccess  to  safe  sanitation,  In  Suva-Nausori  approximately  93%  have  access  to  safe  water  and \nabout  27%  are  served  by  the  wastewater  collection  system  and  most  of  the  remainder  by  septic \ntanks,  though  some  have  no  facilities  (specific  data  are  not  available).  Marine  and  urban  stream \nwater  quality  in  the  Suva-Nausori  area  has  been  significantly  degraded  as  a  result  of  the \ninadequate  sanitation  and  poor  condition  of  the  sewer  system.  Water  quality  monitoring  data \nshows definitive evidence of sewage contamination. \n \nC. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n4. \nPresent  institutional  arrangements  for  water  supply  and  sewerage  and  environmental \nmanagement  are  weak.  Water  and  sewerage  operations  are  managed  from  a  division  within the \npublic works department, which leads it to compete for human and financial resources, resulting in \nfor  2003-2005 \nmanagement  deficiencies.  The  Government\u2019s  strategic  development  plan \nrecognizes the need for institutional reform to achieve acceptable operations and maintenance and \ncost recovery levels and thus calls for corporatization of water supply and sewerage service by end \nof  2005.  Environmental  legislation  is  limited,  which  also  has  constrained  development  of \nappropriate  management  system;  however,  the  Government  is  in  the  process  of  promulgating  a \nsustainable development bill and public health and pollution control bill.   \n \nD. \n \n5.  Rehabilitation,  optimization  and  expansion  of  the  water  supply  and sewerage systems are \nurgently  needed.  Institutional  reforms  included  in  the  Project  that  will  in  turn  result  in  improved \noperations  and  maintenance  and  cost  recovery  ensure  sustainability  of  Project  outputs.\n\nNeed for the Project \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\nDescription \n\nAmount \n(US$ million) \n\n22 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nSource and \nYear \n\n \nAsian \nDevelopment \nBank \n1996 \n\n \n

\n\u2022  The Water and Sewerage Department (WSD), and its corporatized successor the Water and \nSewerage  Corporation  (WSC),  will  operate  in  a  financially  sustainable  manner,  within  a \nsocial  policy  and  regulatory  framework  established  by  the  Government.  It  will  seek  to \ngenerate the funding necessary to maintain its facilities and to contribute substantially to the \ncost of new facilities through user charges. \n\n\u2022  The  WSD  will  set  up  an  accounting  system,  following  existing  government  accounting \nprocedures, which will provide data on costs and revenues by district by month. Overhead \ncosts should be reported separately and consideration should be given to allocating them in \nthe management information system to be set up. \n\n\u2022  Revenues  collected  by  the  WSD  through  the  Water  Rates  Office  will  continue  to  be \n\ntransferred to the Government\u2019s consolidated fund.  \n\n\u2022  The WSD and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will oversee the tariff study planned under the \nloan to ensure that (I) alternative definitions of full cost recovery are defined and discussed; \n(ii) appropriate levels of cost recovery for different types of system and for the operation as a \nwhole are discussed and agreed upon; (iii) consideration is given to the possibility of varying \ntariffs by system; (iv) means are set up to ensure that poor families sharing a connection are \nnot penalized by high block rates; (v) consideration is given to lowering the size of the first \ndomestic  block  (band);  and  (vi)  existing  demand  forecasts  are  reviewed,  discussed, \namended as necessary, and a system for continuous review and updating is set up.  \n\n\u2022  WSD will review and update an earlier valuation of water and sewerage assets and liabilities \nand  prepare  financial  statements  to  enable  them  to  be  transferred  to  the  WSC  on  its \ncreation (not later than 31 December 2005). \n\n\u2022  The WSC will assume the assets and liabilities of the water and sewerage systems for which \n\nit becomes responsible. \n\n\u2022  The  WSC  will  use  a  double  entry  accounting  system  and  will  follow  accrual  accounting \n\nprocedures and other generally accepted accounting policies. \n\n\u2022  The WSC will continue the procedure set up by WSD to provide monthly data on costs and \nrevenues  by  district.  Consideration  will  be  given  on  the  appropriateness  of  the  district  as \ncost center.  \n\n\u2022 \n\nIn conjunction with MOF, the WSC will determine the level of cost recovery required by each \ncost center. If these agreed levels imply the need for subsidies, arrangements will be made \nfor them to be recorded in the WSC books. MOF might wish to fund these subsidies directly. \nIf not, they should be used to increase government equity. They should be allowed for in any \nrequired cost recovery for the WSC as a whole.    \n\n\u2022  The  act  or  other  legislation  setting  up  the  WSC  will  enable  the  board  to  retain  relevant \n\nrevenues collected by the Water Rates Office.  \n\n\u2022  MOF will pass on to the WSC, in Fiji dollars, any international and local loans taken out to \nfinance its operations and expansion so that they appear on the entity\u2019s books of account. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n31 \n\n\u2022  The WSC will be charged with paying debt service on those loans to MOF. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf  tariff  revenues  are  not  sufficient  to  make  full  loan  payments,  the  residual  will,  after \nnegotiations, be used to increase government equity in the WSC. \n\n\u2022  The Government will clarify the tariff basis (monthly or quarterly), strengthen meter reading, \nbilling  and  collection  procedures,  and  enforce  a  well-publicized  disconnection  policy  for \nnonpayment,  with  the  objective  of  reducing  the  outstanding  debtors  from  the  presently \nestimated  300  days  to  90  days  by  31  December  2004,  and  to  60  days  by  31  December \n2005. \n\n\u2022  Customers whose water or sewerage bill is more than 30 days in arrears will be informed \nthat if they do not pay within 30 days they will be disconnected. Following disconnection, the \nservice will not be restored until the debt and a reconnection charge are paid.  \n\n\u2022  To  the  extent  that  the  WSD/WSC  agrees  to  provide  water  or  sewerage  to  social  services, \nand  that  these  require  subsidies,  the  latter  will  be  provided  by  the  Government.  WSD  will \nobtain the repeal of the ordinance that provides rebates to customers for water losses after \ntheir meter. \n\n\u2022  Not later than 31 December 2004 the Government will submit to Parliament a bill to amend \nthe Sewerage Act to provide for disconnection of water services in the event of nonpayment \nof the sewerage bill. \n\n\u2022  The  WSC  will  through  improvements  in  operations  and  financial  management  achieve  the \nfollowing levels of cost recovery: (i) operation, maintenance, and debt interest, not later than \n31 December 2006; and (ii) operation, maintenance, and the higher of (a) debt service and \n25% of capital costs or (b) depreciation plus interest, not later than 31 December 2012.  \n\n \n\u2022  The  Government  will  monitor  the  financial  situation  of  WSD/WSC  and,  in  the  event  the \nabove targets are not expected to be met, take action to enable their achievement, including \nfurther improvements in operational efficiency, tariff adjustments, or tariff increases. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \nTable A6.1:  Cost Estimate \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\nSubtotal A \n\nLand Acquisition \n\nWorks and Equipment \n1.

As  detailed  design  confirms  land  needs,  the  Government  will \nupdate  and  revise  the  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  guidelines  with  assistance \nfrom the design consultants, particularly to ensure that the sewerage component\u2019s land needs \nare clearly identified. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nAbout  20  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be  permanently  acquired  and  another  4  ha \ntemporarily  acquired  for  water  supply  system  improvements.  Three  categories  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement have been identified: (i) permanent acquisition of approximately 5 \nha  and  resettlement  of  approximately  five  households  to  acquire  additional  land  adjacent  to \nexisting pump stations; (ii) permanent acquisition of approximately 15 ha of uninhabited native \nland  for  access  roads,  pump  station  sites,  storage  reservoirs,  and  intake  works;  and  (iii) \ntemporary  acquisition  of  native  and  freehold  land  belonging  to  about  5  native  landowners,  5 \nfreehold  owners,  and  a  maximum  of  10  lessees  without  resettlement  as  easement  and \nassociated  access  for  the  laying  of  6.3  kilometers  of  main  water  supply  pipeline,  temporary \naccess  routes,  construction  areas,  stockpiles,  and  storage  areas.  Most  water  supply  pipelines \nwill use existing main road reserves. Project land acquisition and resettlement requirements are \nnot  considered  to  be  \u201csignificant\u201d  according  to  ADB  policy;  the  landowners  are  unlikely  to  be \nconsidered to be poor and no more than 50 indigenous persons will be affected.  \n \nC.  \n \n3. \nIn the Fiji Islands there are three types of land: native land, freehold land, and state land. \nThe  majority  of  land  is  classified  as  native  and  is  under  the  administration  of  the  Native  Land \nTrust Board. Such land is very important to native landowners as a link to their ancestral past \nand identity. The Department of Lands and the Public Works Department (PWD) have a written \nprocedure on land acquisition based on the Crown Acquisitions of Lands law. The law, however, \ndoes not provide for resettlement, only cash compensation. In practice, aside from cash, PWD \nlandowners  such  as  employment  opportunities,  \nprovides  \u201dgoodwill\u201d  compensation \nplaygrounds, water supply systems, and footpaths. Under the current legal framework, the PWD \nhas  the  right  to  enter  land  and  construct  easements,  access  roads,  or  pipelines  for  the  public \ngood.  Under  the  Sewerage  Act,  it  can  enact  compulsory  acquisition  of  land,  but  this  right  has \nnot  been  claimed  in  the  last  20  years.  Negotiation  with  the  landowners  is  the  preferred \noperational  procedure,  which  involves  forwarding  the  application  to  the  Department  of  Lands \nand either purchasing the land outright or leasing it for up to 99 years. In practice, land is usually \nleased  rather  than  purchased.  The  Native  Land  Trust  Board  is  involved  in  negotiations  when \nnative  land  is  involved.  The  Department  of  Lands  makes  acquisition  payments  directly  to \nlandowners, except in the case of native land, where the money  is channeled to the trust board \nfor distribution to landowners.  \n \nD.  \n \n4. \n\nAdverse impacts on existing human settlements, land, buildings, and other assets and \n\nGovernment Policy, Legal, and Institutional Framework \n\nResettlement and Land Acquisition Principles \n\nto \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nEntitlements \n\nlivelihoods  will  be  minimized  if  not  avoided  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.  In  the  case  of  any \nadverse  impact,  persons  so  affected  will  be  compensated  at  replacement  cost  and  offered \nassistance  to  maintain,  if  not  improve,  their  standard  of  living,  access  to  basic  services, \nproduction levels, and income-earning capacity. \n \nE.  \n \n5. \nThe  Lands  Acquisition  Compensation  Act  also  provides  for  loss  of  rents  and  profits. \nUnder  the  current  system  for  crop  compensation,  PWD  staff  pay  compensation  directly  to \nfarmers  according  to  a  comprehensive  schedule  published  by  the  Department  of  Primary \nIndustries and updated annually. The schedule covers mature and immature plants by type of \nplant.  There  are  three  types  of  people  eligible  for  compensation:  landowners,  lessees,  and \nsublessees.  Table A8.1 shows the compensation entitlement scheme. \n \n\nType of Loss \n\nEntitled Persons \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nTable A10.1: Entitlement Matrix \nCompensation and \nRehabilitation Measures \n \n\n1.

Loss of Houses and Other Structures \nAffected Houses and \nStructures  \n\nOwners identified \nduring the census  \n \nTenants renting \nhouses/structures  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCash compensation for loss of \nincome, standing crops, and trees \nand the cost of soil restoration and \ndamaged infrastructure during \nconstruction. \nCash compensation for affected \nhouses and structures at \nreplacement cost without deduction \nfor depreciation or salvageable \nmaterials. \nCash compensation for crops and \ntrees at current market values. \n \nAs a priority, the tenants and \nowners will be provided adequate \nnotice to relocate their buildings, \nwith transportation and/or \ndismantling/reconstruction help \nprovided. Local builders could be \ncontracted for this exercise. \nIf above is unsuccessful, for \npermanent houses and structures, \ncash compensation equivalent to \nreplacement cost without \ndepreciation or salvageable \nmaterials is offered. \n\n \n\nValuation may be required \nby independent registered \nvaluer to determine \nappropriate value of land.  \nCrop value is to be \ndetermined with staff input. \n\nCompetitive bidding must be \nuse to appoint builders for \nrelocation assistance. \nRegistered quantity surveyor \nmust provide valuation of \nbuilding and materials. \n\n3. Loss of Crops and Trees  \nCrops and Trees  \n \n \n\nOwner or person with \ncustomary usage \nrights  \n\nCash compensation is offered \nfor full replacement cost at  \ncurrent market value. \n\n \nAppropriate staff assist in \ndetermining market value.  \n\nConsultation and Grievance Procedures \n\n \nF.  \n \nTo  acquire  native  land,  PWD  and  the  Department  of  Lands  meet  with  members  of \n6. \nrespective clans in their own villages and any lessees individually to explain their intent, answer \nquestions, and get consensus from landowners. On freehold lands, the department\u2019s Valuation \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n43 \n\nSection prepares a sale and purchase agreement and approaches the landowner to explain and \nexecute  the  document  after  the  landowner\u2019s  agreement.  PWD  and  the  Department  of  Lands \nstart consultations and approach landowners at least 6 months prior to project implementation. \nIn the case of a dispute, landowners can take the Government to court to obtain an injunction \nand stop the land acquisition, a rare but well-established procedure. For compulsory acquisition, \nPWD applies to the Solicitor General\u2019s Office for approval. The Project will ensure that there is \nno  disturbance  to  sacred  sites  such  as  burial  grounds  or  the  house  sites  of  ancestors. \nConsultation  with  landowners  is  essential  to  ensure  there  is  no  conflict  about  the  location  of \nwater and sewerage infrastructure. Several meetings with landowners will be required.  \n\nG.  \n\nResources, Financing, and Implementation Arrangements \n\n7. \nFunds  for  land  acquisition  (purchase  or  leasing),  compensation,  and  resettlement  are \nappropriated  in  the  annual  budget  of  the  Ministry  of  Works  and  Energy.  Contingencies  are \nprovided  in  accordance  with  annual  budgetary  appropriations.  The  principal  institutions \nconcerned  in  the  process  are  all  well  established  as  is  the  process  itself.  The  Department  of \nLands prepares a schedule to monitor negotiations, payment, survey, and other arrangements. \nTable  A8.2  summarizes  the  anticipated  funding  and  implementation  arrangements.  The \nGovernment has committed itself to funding any necessary resettlement and land acquisition. \n\n \nTable A10.2: Financing and Implementation Schedule \n(F$)  \n\nActivity \n\nResettlement of Squatters \n\nPermanent Land Acquisition \n\n     Source: Government estimates. \n\nTotal \n \n\n450,000 \n\n725,000 \n\n325,000 \n\n2004 \n \n200,000 \n\n2005 \n \n150,000 \n\n2006 \n \n\n100,000 \n\n300,000 \n\n22,500,000 \n\n200,000 \n\nTemporary Easement Acquisition \n\n150,000 \n\n100,000 \n\n75,000 \n\nH.

As  is  to  be  expected,  the  benefits  of  the \nimmediate  project  are  higher  than  those  of  the  master  plan  since  major  parts  of  the  early \nbenefits will be water loss reduction, requiring comparatively little investment, and increases in \ncollection  efficiency.  Decisions  regarding  options  for  the  master  plan  were  evaluated  using \neconomic least-cost analysis. The following general assumptions have been adopted:  \n\n \n\n \n\n(i)  Prices in general are adjusted to 2003 constant prices from the 2002 prices used \npreviously. By agreement with the Ministry of National Planning, the local inflation \nrate was taken at 2.5%.   \nThe least-cost analyses carried out in the 1999 master plan used 1999 constant \nprices; it is unnecessary to update them since the options have not changed and \nprice adjustments will affect all equally.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(v) \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii)  Each project component is assumed to have a useful economic life of 40 years \nafter  construction  for  civil  works  and  15  years  for  electrical  and  mechanical \ncomponents.  For  the  ADB-funded  project,  replacements  have  been  included  at \n2.5% of previous investment once every 5 years. \nThe period of the master plan investment program is 20 years. An allowance is \nmade  in  year  30,  equivalent  to  5%  of  project  capital  costs,  to  provide  for  the \nreplacement  of  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  and  vehicles  over  the \nbalance of the evaluation period, years 21 to 40. No residual values are assumed  \nin year 40. \nFinancial flows are discounted at the estimated weighted average cost of capital \nof  4%.  This  is  a  minimum  to  be  applied  when  the  calculated  weighted  average \ncost of capital is lower.1  \nThe  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  employed  in  the  economic  analysis  is \nassumed to be the standard 12% per annum. \nThe average household size is 5.5 persons. Based on 2002 water consumption \ndata, they consumed 187 litres per  capita per day (lpcd). Supplies are assumed \nto  have  constrained  demand,  which  is  estimated  to  be  190  lpcd  with  present \nincomes and present tariffs. \nIncomes have been allowed for in the demand forecasts by assuming per capita \nincome growth of 2% per annum and an income elasticity of 0.60. \nThe  effects  of  tariff  increases  have  been  estimated  using  price  elasticities  of  \u2013\n0.20  for  domestic  and  \u20130.05  for  nondomestic.  These  figures  are  based  on \ninternational  rather  than  the  Fiji  Islands  data.  They  are  low  as  a  result of the \npresent low level of tariffs. \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(x)  Wastewater generation is estimated at 85% of water consumption. \n(xi)  Capital  costs  include  physical  contingencies  (10%  for  water  and  12%  for \nsewerage) but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction. \n(xii)  All  economic  costs,  in  particular  of  imported  tradeable  inputs,  are  net  of  duties \nand  taxes.  Financial  costs  include  (a)  duties  and  taxes  at  2.0%  of  total  base \ncosts,  based  on  taxes  and  duties  on  imported  items  of  10%  for  pumping  and \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002.Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects. Manila. \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nelectrical equipment and 27% for building materials such as reinforcing steel; and \n(b) value-added tax at 12.5% on all purchases (an increase over 10% in 2002). \nThe economic opportunity cost of raw water provided to the project is assumed to \nbe zero. There are no competing uses of the raw water such as irrigation in the \nSuva-Nausori area. \nThe average official exchange rate of F$2.00 per US$1.00 (as of April 2003) has \nbeen  employed  in  converting  foreign  exchange  costs  to  their  local  currency \nequivalent.  \nIn  economic  pricing,  domestic  price  numeraire  in  local  currency  unit  (F$)  was \nused. Based on 1999 imports and customs revenue data, weighted average tariff \nrate = 14.1% percent, therefore a shadow exchange rate factor is approximated \nby  1.141  (this  is  equivalent  to  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  1/(1+WATR)  = \n0.88). \nIt is assumed that there are no significant distortions in the wage rates for skilled \nlabor.  In  the  case  of  unskilled  labor,  underemployment  exists  in  the  Fiji  Islands \neconomy  resulting  in  the  opportunity  cost  of  unskilled labor being less than the \nminimum wage. In the third Fiji Road Upgrading Project2 a shadow wage rate of \n0.860 was calculated. This factor has also been adopted for the current project. \n\n(xiii) \n\n(xiv)  \n\n(xv) \n\n(xvi) \n\n \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\n B. \n \n2. \nThe least-cost analysis has been carried out in economic prices. It is used to determine \nwhich development option (or combined options) is preferred economically where a number of \nviable technical alternatives exist. Four components were subjected to the least-cost analysis. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  of  a  New  Water  Source.  Three  options  to  supply  Suva-Nausori water \ndemands  for  the  next  20  years  were  considered:  Rewa  run-of-river,  Waldina  run-of-river, and \nstorage dams on the upper Waimanu and Sovi rivers, with and without hydroelectric generation \ncapacity. The least-cost option was found to be developing a new intake and pumping station on \nthe  Rewa  River,  and  continuing  to  take  water  from  the  existing  Waila  intake.  Water  from  both \nsources would be treated at Waila. Least-cost analysis was also used to evaluate the proposed \nRewa River rising main diameter.  \n \n4. \nTransfer  of  Treated  Water  to  Suva  City.  The  demand  for  treated  water  from  the \nexisting  Waila  water  treatment  plant  is  expected  to  double  during  the  next  20  years. \nAccordingly, it will be necessary to increase the transfer of water from the Waila treatment plant, \nthrough  pipelines  in  King\u2019s  Road,  to  lower  and  medium  pressure  water  distribution  zones  in \ncentral  Suva.  Three  options  were  considered:  duplication  of  the  trunk  main  from  Wainibuku  to \nMead Road, booster pumping from one of the trunk mains at Wainibuku reservoir, and reduced \npumping  from  Wainibuku  and  construction  of  a  new  section  of  trunk  through  the  high  point in \nKing\u2019s  Road.  The  least-cost  option  was  found  to  be  duplicating  a  trunk  water  supply  pipeline \nfrom  Wainimbuku  to  Mead  Road,  with  sufficient  capacity  to  overcome  the  low  pressures  in \nKing\u2019s Road.  \n \nAugmentation  of  Water  Treatment  Plants.  Three  options  for  augmenting  the  water \n5. \ntreatment  to  meet  maximum  day  demands  from  year  5  to  year  20  were  considered.  They \nincluded  maintaining  the  existing  Tamavua  water  treatment  plant  capacity  and  providing  20 \nmegaliters per day (Ml/d) capacity increase at Waila in 2002 and 2011; increasing the capacity \nof Tamavua by 9 Ml/d and providing 20 Ml/d capacity increases at Waila in 2003 and 2015; and \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 1997. Third Road Upgrading (Sector). Manila. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n49 \n\nincreasing Tamavua by 16 Ml/d and providing 20 Ml/d capacity increases at Waila in 2010 and \n2019.  The  least-cost  option  was  found  to  be  increasing  the  output  of  the  Tamavua  water \ntreatment plant during droughts to by 16 Ml/d by duplication of the Upper Waimanu rising main \nand using three pumps, and providing 20 Ml/d additional capacity at Waila in 2010 and 2019.  \n \n6. \nSewerage and Sewage Treatment.  Two  broad  options  have  been  identified  for  future \ntreatment and disposal of Suva\u2019s sewerage: (i) a \u201ccentralized\u201d strategy, which assumes that all \nsewage,  except  sewage  from  Nausori,  will  be  diverted  to  and  treated  at  the  existing  plant  in \nKinoya;  and  (ii)  a  \u201clocalized\u201d  strategy,  which  envisages  utilizing  the  existing  plant  at  Kinoya, \ntogether  with  new  plants  to  be  located  in  growth  areas  at  the  extremities  of  Suva\u2019s  sewerage \nsystem, at Waila and Lami. The centralized strategy was found to be least cost.  \n \nC. \n \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\n1. \n\nWater Supply  \n\n \nCapital  and  operating  costs  were  forecast  for  2  years  for  the  ADB  Project  and  for  20 \n7. \nyears  for  the  master  plan.  After  these  periods,  operating  costs  are  held  constant  with  an \nallowance  made  for  replacement  and  rehabilitation  at  2.5%  of  project  capital  costs  every  5 \nyears.  No  residual  values  are  assumed  at  the  end  of  40  years.  Operating  costs  used  in  the \nmaster plan and feasibility study analyses included only direct operation and maintenance and \ndid not include salaries and wages or overheads. The latter have been added at rates derived \nfrom the analysis of the likely costs of a Fiji Water Authority, given in the feasibility study. They \nwere obtained from Ministry of Works costs and add 57% and 15%, respectively. The inclusion \nof  these  costs  does  mean  that  both  the  costs  and  benefits  of  corporatization  have  been \nincluded. \n \n8. \nThe physical project will provide water for sale, mainly through decreased physical and \nfinancial  losses.  The  assumptions  made  for  total  losses  are:  2003,  56%  (2002  actual);  2004, \n50%; 2005, 45%; 2006, 40%; 2007, 35%; 2008 plus, 30%. The effect of not decreasing losses \nbelow  40%  is  included  in  the  sensitivity  analysis.  The  present  share  of  financial  losses  is \nassumed to be 12% of production. \n \n9. \nNonincremental benefits include the following: (i) meeting the demand of new customers \nat present satisfied demand levels; (ii) saved cost of water tankering in drought conditions, (iii) \ncost savings from absorbing small systems into the greater Suva-Nausori network. Incremental \nbenefits  include  the  following:  (i)  meeting  suppressed  domestic and commercial demands, (ii) \nnon-evenue  water  consumed  under  the  Project;  (iii)  the  cost  of  new  connections,  assumed \nequal  to  willingness  to  pay.  Valuation  of  these  items  is  summarized  in  Table  A10.1.  Note, \nhowever,  that  the  incremental  benefit  differentiation  is  less  relevant  when  the  Project  is  not \nreplacing water from an alternative, normally traditional, source.3  \n\n                                                 \n3  Nonincremental costs to the user are then higher than incremental and the downward sloping demand curve can \nbe used to value the latter. In this study, as in others when water is being replaced by water of higher quality and/or \nreliability, expressed willingness to pay for the incremental is higher than actual payments for the nonincremental. If \ntaken simplistically, this would imply an upward sloping demand curve. That is the reason why the survey-based \nwillingness to pay value has been used for both incremental and nonincremental sales. \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nBenefit \n\nA.

For the 20-year master plan it is 24.8%. \nWith tariff increases to provide the required financial return, sales would be less and the EIRR \nwould fall to 21.4%. \n\n59. \nSensitivity  analyses  indicate  that  the  economic  viability  is  robust  to  adverse  changes, \nespecially to cost increases. Benefits are a combination of unit benefits, as shown in Table A10.1, \nand m3 sales and so the range in possible results is larger. The number of items involved is  large \n(volumes and values for each of the items in Table A10.1) and to show the sensitivity to each would \nbe  confusing.  Therefore,  the  sensitivity  to  a  relatively  large  fall  in  total  benefits  is  shown  in  Table \nA10.2.  As  can  be  seen,  benefits  associated  with  the  overall  growth  in  satisfied  water  demand, \nparticularly  to  the  non-domestic  sector,  are  the  largest  item  in  these  benefit  flows  and  so  would \naccount for much of the variation shown. This is the result particularly of the assumed additional unit \nbenefit to the non-domestic sector, at least in terms of willingness to pay.  \n\nTable A12.2: Economic Sensitivity Analysis for Water \n\n \n\nADB  Project  Master  Plan  Master  Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIncrease  Tariff \n\nIncrease \n\nNo \nTariff \n\nChange  EIRR \n\nSV \n\nEIRR \n\nSV \n\nEIRR \n\nSV \n\n  \n\n26.2% \n\n24.9% \n+ 20%  22.3%  36.5%  20.9%  32.6%  18.1%  28.8% \n+ 20%  25.6%  243.7%  24.3%  232.0%  20.9%  184.0% \n- 20%  20.9%  27.1%  19.6%  24.4%  17.0%  21.3% \n\n21.4% \n\n  \n\n  \n\n17.4%  16.2%  16.1%  14.7%  14.0%  12.7% \n40%  25.8%  358.6%  24.4%  285.1%  20.9%  212.4% \n75%  26.2% \n\n21.4% \n\n24.9% \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nBase Case \n\nA.

Operating  costs  are  held  constant  with  an  allowance  for  replacement  and \nrehabilitation  at  2.5%  of  project  capital  costs  every  5  years.  Salaries,  wages,  and  overheads \nhave been added to direct operation and maintenance. No residual values are assumed at the \nend of 40 years.  \n \n60. \nThere  are  two  main  ways  to  evaluate  a  sewerage  program  economically.  These  are:  (a) \nstandard benefit cost analysis (BCA); (b) measure the project\u2019s output against relevant standards, on \nthe  assumption  that  those  standards  have  been  set  to  reflect  costs  and  benefits4.  The  latter \napproach is difficult for the Project since there are no accepted river water quality standards in the \nFiji Islands and the water whose pollution is being controlled goes all but directly into the ocean. \n \n61. \nStandard BCA requires a means to estimate peoples\u2019 willingness to pay (wtp) for the project \nbenefits. The various alternative  methods to do this can be summarised as (a) contingent valuation \nsurveys, (b) estimation of direct costs such as health and environment, (c) estimates of land value \nincreases; (d) avoided costs of installing own septic tanks and/or replacing septic tanks on new and \nexisting  properties  and  dislodging  costs.  Data  is  not  available  for  the  first  two  of  these.  For  land \nvalues it is possible to use building densities allowed by the planners for properties in areas where a \nsewage connection is possible. This is a  potential benefit based upon ability to subdivide and has \nbeen measured separately from the actual connection. Therefore it can be assumed to be additional \nto the direct avoided cost benefits.  The assumptions used to measure these two benefits are given \nin Table A10.3.    These  benefits  do  not  include  health  and  amenity  benefits  to  people  living  along \npolluted rivers or using the ocean into which they discharge. \n \n\n \n\nBenefit per New Connection \n\nUnit \n\nValue \n\nRationale \n\nTable A12.3: Economic Benefit Values for Sewerage  \n\nIncreased Land Use Values  \n\nNew Housing Authority Plots \n\nNew (Small) Private Plots \n\n \nF$/conn. or 400 m 2 plot \nF$/conn. or 600 m 2 plot \n\n3000 \n\n5000 \n\nIncreased plot value \n\nIncreased plot value \n\nBacklog Sewerage Connections  \n\nF$/conn. or plot \n\n10,000 \n\nIncreased plot value \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAvoided Costs of Septic Tanks  \n\n \n\nAvoided Initial Capital Cost or \nReplacement \n\nF$/conn. per annum  \n\n239 \n\nF$2,000 per 15 year life \ntank \n\nAvoided Cost of Desludging \n\nF$/conn. per annum  \n\n40 \n\nF$120 per 3 year trip \n\nm2=square meters, conn=connection. \nSource: Appraisal Mission estimates. \n \nThe sewerage program is long term and it is all but impossible to separately identify the \n12. \nbenefits  that  would  accrue  from  the  ADB-funded  5-year project. If it were to be assumed that \nthere  would  be  no  further  investment  and  so  no  additional  sewerage  connections,  economic \nbenefits  would  be  less  than  costs  in  all  future  years.  This  is  not  a  reasonable  assumption, \nhowever,  so  the  economic  analysis  of  the  sewerage  component  is  based  on  the  investments \nand  benefits  identified  in  the  master  plan.  The  former  have  been  adjusted  to  allow  for  the \npresently expected costs of the project. It can also be noted that a major benefit of the project \n\n                                                 \n4 Economic Issues in the Design and Analysis of a Wastewater Treatment Project, Technical Note 4, ERD, ADB, July \n\n2002. \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nwill be returning the system to its design efficiency, but that will provide economic and financial \nbenefits that are difficult to estimate. \n \n13.  Making  connections  in  areas  already  served  (the  backlog)  would  be  the  result  of \ninstitutional rather than physical project change. Therefore  results have been obtained for both \nthe  physical  project  and  for  that  project  plus  institutional  change  (which  would  ensure  that \nplaces  that  could  connect  actually  do  so).  With  these  assumptions  the  estimated  base  case \nphysical project EIRR is \u20136.3%. The EIRR of the total project, including institutional change to \nensure use, is 9.8%.  \n \n62. \nDue  to  the  low  base  level,  sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  economic  viability  is  not \nparticularly  robust  to  adverse  changes,  as  shown  in  Table  A10.4.  The  difference between the \nEIRRs with and without backlog connections indicates how important it will be to ensure that all who \ncould use the system do. \n \n63. \nIt is probable that these comparatively low levels are because not all the environmental etc \nbenefits are captured by the assumed land value increases. This will apply particularly to users of \npresently polluted streams and coastal areas, all of whom would have some willingness to pay to be \nable to use unpolluted waters. \n \n\nTable A12. 4: Economic Sensitivity Analysis for Sewerage Master Plan \n\nItem \n\nChange \n\nEIRR \n\nSwitching Value \n\nA.

The net economic flows for the water supply and sewerage \nmaster plans were combined to provide an EIRR for the overall project. The estimated EIRR is \n15.8%,  including  allowance  for  decreased  sales  due  to  tariff  increases  and  the  benefits  of \ninstitutional reform. Sensitivity tests for the combined project show that the economic viability of \nthe  combined  master  plan,  although  low,  is  reasonably  robust  to  adverse  changes  in  various \nassumptions (Table A10.5). \n\n \nTable A12.5: Economic Sensitivity Analysis for Water and Sewerage \n\nChange \n\nEIRR \n\nSwitching Value \n\nItem \nA.

The  latter  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  revenue  collection  and  so will \nprovide benefits to both project and nonproject cash flow.  Agreement was reached during the \nappraisal mission that consideration could be given to tariff increases once the benefits of the \nproject  start  to  become  obvious  to  customers,  and  this  point has been reached. The criterion \nused was to set the FIRR above the 4% weighted average cost of capital. This would ensure the \nlong-term viability of the project but would not ensure that cash flows are available at all times to \nmeet capital, operating, and debt service requirements on an annual basis. This would require \nanalysis of the cash flows of the enterprise as a whole. That in turn would require decisions as \nto  the  nature  of  the  enterprise  and  the  extent  to  which  it  would  be  charged  with  meeting  debt \npayments. \n\n \n\nIn  addition  to  revenues  from  decreased  losses  provided  by  the  physical  project,  the \n16. \ninstitutional  part  of  the  project  will  provide  revenues  from  increased  revenue  collection \nefficiency. The assumptions made for the latter are: 2003, 57% (2002 actual); 2004, 60%; 2005, \n70%;  2006,  75%;  2007,  80%;  2008,  85%;  2009,  90%;  2010  plus,  95%.

For the latter, they are shown at present tariff \nlevels and for the master plan with a 60% tariff increase in 2006, sufficient to provide an FIRR \nfor the combined water and sewerage project of 4% (the weighted average cost of capital). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A12.7: Effects of Collection Efficiency on the Water Supply FIRR \nProject \n\nMaster \n\nPlan \n\nADB \n\nMaster \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \n\nExisting \n\nExisting \n\n60% Increase \n\nTariffs \nPlus Non \nProject \nRevenues  \nnegative \n2.2% \n5.5% \n4.0% \n\nTariffs \nPlus Non \nProject \nRevenues  \n-9.4% \n1.3% \n4.2% \n3.1% \n\nProject \nSales  \n-9.4% \n-3.0% \n-1.2% \n-1.4% \n\nProject \nSales  \n-1.4% \n1.7% \n2.9% \n2.6% \n\nPlan \nTariff \nin 2006 \nPlus \nNonProject \nRevenues  \n-1.4% \n4.3% \n6.7% \n5.6% \n\nCollection \nEfficiency \nAlternative \n64% \nPresent \n85% \nDepartment \n96% \nCorporate \nAssumed \nrising to 95% in 2010 \nSource: Appraisal Mission estimates. \n\nProject \nSales  \nnegative \n-4.9% \n-2.4% \n-2.7% \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n19. \nConceptually, it might be argued that the true project FIRR should not include the effects \nof  increased  collection  efficiency  on  nonproject  revenues.  If  this  is  the  case,  the  FIRR  for  the \nADB project would be negative with present efficiency and minus 2.7% with assumed efficiency. \nThe FIRR for the master plan would be minus 1.4% with assumed efficiency and minus 9.4% \nwith  present  efficiency.  The  tariff  increase  in  2006  required  to  raise  the  water  and  sewerage \nmaster  plan  FIRR  to  4.0%  would  be  60%  with  assumed  efficiency  and  around  100%  with \npresent efficiency. It would give a water supply FIRR of 5.6%. \n \n20. \nThese  required  increases  demonstrate  the  importance  of  efficiency  change.  They  also \nimply that without them, the physical project will simply not  succeed. For this reason alone, it is \nbetter to think of the project as including institutional change. In this case the ADB project FIRR \nis 4.0% with present tariffs. The master plan project is 3.1% with present tariffs and 5.6% with \nthe 60% tariff increase in 2006 required to set the overall FIRR equal to the weighted average \ncost of capital. \n \nStandard  sensitivity  analyses  indicates  that  the  financial  viability  with  the  assumed \n21. \ncollection  efficiency,  albeit  low,  is  robust  to  adverse  change,  especially  to  cost  increase.  The \nmajor  single  item  is  the  benefit  associated  with  increased  efficiency  in  the  collection  of \nrevenues, as shown in Table A10.8.  \n\nTable A12.8: Financial Sensitivity Analysis for Water \n\nWater Sensitivity Tests \nFinancial \n\nChange \n\nADB \nExisting \nFIRR \n\nProject \nTariffs \nSV \n\nMaster \nExisting \nFIRR \n\nPlan \nTariffs \nSV \n\nMaster \nIncreased \n\nPlan \nTariffs \nSV \n\n \n20% \n20% \n-20% \n \n40% \n\n4.0% \n2.9% \n2.7% \n1.1% \n-2.0% \n2.6% \n\nA.

Unit financial benefits \nare  based  on  the  present  tariff  which  is  F$0.198  and  F$0.225  per  cubic  meter  m3  of  water \nconsumed  for  domestic  and  commercial  customers,  respectively.  These  rates  are  applied  to \ncustomers  identified  as  being  connected  to  the  sewer  system.  Identification  and  collection  are \nboth  poor  and  at  present  only  some  32%  of  the  estimated  revenue  potential  is  collected.  It  is \nassumed  that  the  tariff  collection  efficiency  will  improve  only  marginally  to  40%  in  2005,  when \ncorporatization  should  occur.  It  is  then  assumed  to  increase  more  rapidly  to  95%  in  2009.  In \norder  to  maintain  consistency  between  the  sectors  the  same  60%  tariff  increase  in  2006 \nassumed for water is also assumed for sewerage. \n \n23. \nThe sewerage program is long term and it is all but impossible to separately identify the \nrevenues that would accrue from the ADB-funded 5-year project. If it were to be assumed that \nthere was no further investment and so no additional sewerage connections, financial benefits \nwould  be  less  than  costs  in  all  future  years.  This  applies  even  with  the  60% tariff increase in \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\n2006 calculated as necessary to give overall master plan project financial viability. This is not a \nreasonable assumption, however, so the financial analysis of the sewerage component is based \non  the  investments  and  benefits  identified  in  the  master  plan.  The  investments  have  been \nadjusted to allow for the presently expected costs of the immediate 5-year project. \n \n24. \nIn  spite  of  the  assumed  efficiency  increases,  the  estimated  base  case  FIRR  is  not \ncalculable  since  revenues  would  never  be  more  than  costs.  This  means  that  for  any  form  of \nfinancial  viability  tariffs  would  have  to  be  increased.  No  increase  would  be  required  to  cover \ndirect  operation  and  maintenance;  135%  increase  would  be  needed  to  cover  operation  and \nmaintenance plus salaries and wages; and a factor of 18 increase would be needed for full cost \nrecovery.   \n\n \n3. \n\nWater Supply and Sewerage Combined \n\n \n25. \nSince the effects of the short-term sewerage investment cannot be separately identified, it is \nnot  possible  to  provide  an  estimate  for  the  financial  viability  of  the  combined  water  and  sewerage \nADB  funded  investment.  The  net  financial  flows  for  the  water  supply  and  sewerage  master  plans \nwere  combined  to  provide  an  FIRR  for  the  overall  master  plan.  To  raise  the  FIRR  to  the  required \nweighted average cost of capital level of 4% would require a tariff increase of 60% in 2006. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY   \n \n\nA.

Infantile diarrhea is fairly common, and such household  \nis often forced to boil their drinking water to purify it, which is costly. The project will help provide reliable potable water \nservice to poor households in the project area.  It will also make sewage collection available, although with a lower \ncoverage than water, to a substantial number of poor households and it will help improve the quality of water in the \nstreams and coastal areas along which many poor people live. The project will very substantially benefit the poor, by \nimproving the quality of their water supply, improving their sanitation, reducing pollution and eliminating the need for \nboiling drinking water for those with pipes/water connections.  Since the cost of water and sewerage to the poor will \ndecrease, the net benefit flows will be substantial. \nB. \nBeneficiaries will comprise all urban households, including the \npoor and those in informal and squatters settlements; industries, \nhotels, restaurants, schools, health facilities. \n\nProposed Classification \n \n \n\nHuman Development, \nEnvironmental Protection \nPoverty Intervention \n\nThematic: \n \n \nPoverty Classification: \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nC. \nParticipation Process \nStakeholder analysis completed  \n \n \n \nParticipation strategy: Yes \n\nDone  during  project  processing.

Due  to  the  length  of  time  since  the  IEE  was  prepared  and  the \naddition and deletion of some components from the Project, the Project was reassessed during \nthe  Appraisal  Mission2  and  the  summary  IEE  (Supplementary  Appendix  M)  reflects  the \nappraisal\u2019s  conclusions  and  recommendations  as  well  those  of  the  IEE.  This  appendix \nsummarizes the findings of both the IEE and the summary IEE. \n \nA. \n \nEnvironmental legislation and control in the Fiji Islands are in their infancy. There is no \n2. \nnational  water  quality  policy  or  management  strategy,  and  no  water  or  land  resource \nmanagement legislation, environmental impact assessment (EIA), or management legislation. In \nsome instances , sectoral legislation incorporates environmental management components, e.g., \nEIAs are called for through the Town and Country Planning Act 1946; however, it is not legally \nbinding,  and  the  development  of  in-house  or  corporate  environmental  management  strategies \nand  codes  of  environmental  practice  (COEPs)  is  becoming  increasingly  common.  Two  key \nitems of environmental legislation are under development: the Sustainable Development Bill and \nthe  Public  Health  Pollution  Control  Bill.  The  former  addresses  overall  environmental \nmanagement and policies, including EIA, and the latter addresses waste management, pollutant \ndischarges, and monitoring. \n \nThe Public Works Department (PWD) has adopted in-house standards for water quality \n3. \nand sewerage effluent. These standards are well founded and useful as an interim measure, but \nthere is little or no incentive to achieve compliance. Also, PWD) lacks the capacity to supervise \ncompliance.  \n\n \nWater Quality Monitoring Program \n\n4. \nThe  Project  includes  several  activities  to  improve,  the  environmental  performance  of \nPWD and its successors, including (i) introduction of an appropriate environmental management \nframework,  through  the  promulgation  of  its  own  COEP;  (ii)  establishing  an  environmental \nsection; and (iii) upgrading of the National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL). \n \nB. \n \nA  water  quality  monitoring  program,  related  mainly  to  the  chemical  and  microbiological \n5. \nquality  of  water  supplies,  is  maintained  by  the  NWQL,  which  is  managed  by  the  Water  and \nSewerage Department. This program is frustrated by lack of equipment, training, and resources. \nIt  will  be  improved  by  increasing  and  making  routine  the  monitoring  of  water  treatment  plant \nsludge and backwash water; sewage sludge; and pesticides,  Giardia, and  Cryptosporidium. A \n\u201cnoncompliance procedure\u201d and a quality assurance program also will be developed. \n \n6. \nWater  quality  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  early  in  the  Project  to  establish  solid \nbaseline  data  provide  for  monitoring  of  project  effects,  e.g.,  urban  streams  near  failing  pump \nstations and sewers, near the Kinoya treatment plant outfall, near water treatment plant outfalls. \nThe  monitoring  program  will  be  designed  to  be  an  integral  part  of  the  water  and  sewerage \nutilities  and  Ministry  of  Health  or  Department  of  Environment\u2019s  monitoring  program.

Water quality and effluent data will be made available to the Department of \nEnvironment and to the general public. \n\nC. \n\n \nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n \n7. \nPublic consultations during the feasibility study focused on the issues of land availability \nand  social  impact  assessment  of  the  various  project  components.  In  particular,  the  feasibility \nstudy  team  met  with  village  leaders  and  a  group  of  women  fisherfolk  in  the  Rewa  River  area. \nSuch consultation with the affected communities will be an ongoing process under the Project. \n \nD. \n\nFindings and Recommendations of the IEE \n\n \n\n \n\nThe findings of the IEE of the proposed Project are as follows: \n\n8. \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  current  water  supply  system  provides  water  of  adequate  quality.  However,  the \nsystem is failing to provide a reliable supply and is not meeting the demand for new \nconnections. \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii)  A  new  raw  water  source  is  needed  based  on  the  feasibility  study,  and  the  Rewa \nwater intake is the most suitable location, but additional modelling and environmental \nassessment should be undertaken during detailed design to confirm safe yields and \nidentify  the  most  appropriate  environmental  controls  as  well  as  to  continue  public \nconsultations. \nThe  condition  of  the  sewerage  infrastructure  is  poor  and  there  is  a  serious  and \nincreasing  public  health  risk  from  wide-scale  leakage  of  raw  and  partly  treated \nsewage.  Continued  and  increasing  levels  of  sewage  containing  high  levels  of \nnutrients  and  industrial  contaminants  are  leaked  to  creeks,  waterways,  and  the \ninshore environment with serious impacts on the aquatic ecology. \nThe  Project  has  the  potential  to  make  a  major  beneficial  impact  in  reducing  public \nhealth  hazards  and  improving  the  aquatic  biology  of  creeks  and  the  inshore \nenvironment. \n\n(iv) \n\n(v)  Water  quality  monitoring  must  be  undertaken  early  in  the  Project  to  establish  solid \nbaseline  data  with  specific  attention  to  project-affected  areas,  i.e.,  urban  streams \nnear  failing  sewers  and  pump  stations  and  near  the  Kinoya  wastewater  treatment \nplant outfall. The monitoring program should be designed to be an integral part of the \nwater  and  sewerage  utilities  and  Ministry  of  Health  or  Department  of  Environment \nmonitoring program.  \n\n(vi)  PWD\u2019s current environmental management capability is inadequate.  \n(vii)  Environmental controls during construction and operation of the river water intake will \nbe  important  to  protecting  the  Kai  (fresh  water  mussels)  fisheries  and  the \ncommunities that depend on them. \n\n9. \n\nThe following recommendations of the IEE and summary IEE will be implemented: \n\n(i) \n\nIn  line  with  its  existing  environmental  management  approach,  and  with  the  draft \nSustainable Development Bill, PWD will draw up a COEP, based on the International \nStandards Organisation 14000 series.  \n\n(ii)  An  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  for  the  entire  Project  will  be  prepared \nduring  detailed  design.  The  EMP  will  include  identification  of  potential  impacts, \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nspecific  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  program  for  during  and  postconstruction, \nbudgets  for  environmental  measures  and  monitoring,  and  a  public  consultation  and \nreporting  program.  EMP  implementation  will  be  a  specific  and  performance-\nevaluation element of all civil works contracts.  \n\n(iii)  A detailed environmental assessment will be undertaken, with particular attention to \nthe Rewa water intake, to support the development of the EMP, confirm preliminary \ndesigns, and identify the most appropriate environmental controls as well as continue \npublic  consultations.  Funds  will  not  be  disbursed  for  the  Rewa  water  intake \ncomponent until an EMP satisfactory to the Government and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has been prepared.  \n\n(iv) \n\nThe Project will provide a technical specialist to help PWD to prepare the COEP and \nprovide training to its staff. \n\n(v)  Adequate  residual  flow  for  aquatic  ecology  needs  to  be  left  in  the  Waimanu  River \nduring very low flows. A policy for the quantum of residual flows will be a component \nof  the  COEP.  To  ensure  that  adequate  flows  can  be  left,  the  system  will  have  the \ncapacity  to  transfer  off-take  to  the  Rewa  River  source  during  very  low  flows  in  the \nWaimanu River. \n\n(vi)  A rigorous ongoing monitoring program will be implemented for pollutants in streams \n\nused as water sources, and this information will be available to the public.  \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nThe current use of copper sulphate during water treatment to minimize algae growth \nwill be phased out as soon as possible. \n\nThe  sludge  deposition  site  at  the  Waila  water  treatment  plant  will  be  chemically \ncharacterized and rehabilitated if it is contaminated. \n\n(ix)  Effluent (backwash water) from the Tamavua and Waila water treatment plants will \n\nbe collected and disposed of in an environmentally safe manner.  \n\n(x)  A  rigorous  regular  (monthly  or  quarterly)  monitoring  program  will  be  developed  for \nwater  quality  in  the  streams  in  the  project  area,  and  for  Laucala  Bay  receiving \nwaters,  including  Suva  and  Walu  bays,  and  this  information  will  be  available  to  the \npublic.  At  a  minimum,  the  water  quality  monitoring  program  will  include  typical \nsewage  contaminants  such  as  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  total  and  fecal \ncoliforms, suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorous,  \n\n(xi)  PWD will upgrade its attitude and ability to respond to sewage overflows.  \n\n(xii)  NWQL  will  be  upgraded  and  several  changes  will  be  made  to  its    monitoring \n\nprogram. \n\n(xiii)  Sewage sludge from the Kinoya sewage treatment plant will be stored on a prepared \nsite at Kinoya according to the sludge management strategy. Sludge disposal will be \na component of PWD\u2019s COEP, and the sludge will be analyzed on at least a monthly \nbasis. Odor complaints from the plant\u2019s neighbours will be recorded and, if found to \nbe excessive, the disposal strategy will be reviewed. \n\n(xiv)  \n\n(xv) \n\nThe  Sewerage  Act  will  be  amended  to  ensure  connection  by  industry  and  house \nowners to sewer lines when they are put in place. \n\nThe Sustainable Development Bill and the Public Health and Pollution Control Bill or \nother legal measures will be finalized and submitted to Parliament.  \n \n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nE. \n\nConclusions \n \n10. \nThe Project will have a positive benefit to the environment through substantial reduction \nof  sewage  presently  entering  the  groundwater,  steams,  and  the  sea  due  to  inadequate \ntreatment in septic tanks, pump station and pipeline failures, and lack of water treatment plant \nsludge  disposal  facilities.  The  improvements  in  coastal  water  quality  possible  through  the \nsewerage  components  of  this  Project  are  closely  linked  to  the  extension  of  the  sewage  outfall \nthat is being funded by the European Union.   \n \n11. \nSustainable improvements in stream, ground, and marine water quality will be supported \nthrough  project  works  and  the  enactment  of  key  environmental  legislation,  including  the \nSustainable  Development  Bill  and  the  Public  Health  and  Pollution  Control  Bill,  or  other  legal \nmeasures,  which  will  help  clarify  and  strengthen  the  basis  for  regulation  and  control  of  waste \ndischarges.  The  strengthening  of  the  PWD\u2019s  water  quality  laboratory  and  improvement  of \nPWD\u2019s environmental guidelines will help ensure the monitoring of project impacts and benefits, \nand  the  sustainability  of  the  Projects\u2019  water  quality  benefits.  The  Project  will  upgrade  PWD\u2019s \nenvironmental  management  capacity,  and  will  establish  a  sound  operating  policy  and \nimplementation framework. \n \n12. \nThe  IEE  has  been  thoroughly  carried  out,  environmental  issues  have  been  identified, \nand mitigation strategies have been included in the Project. It is not considered that an ADB EIA \nneeds  to  be  conducted.  However,  environmental  assessments  acceptable  to  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  should  be  carried  out  as  a  basis  for  EMPs,  acceptable  to  ADB,  for  all  project \ncomponents with particular attention given to the Rewa River water intake.   \n \n \n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 November 2003) \n", "Currency Unit \n F$1.00 \nUS$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Fiji dollar (F$) \nUS$0.55 \nF$1.81 \n", "For the purpose of calculation in this report, a rate of US$1.00 = F$2.00, which was current at \nthe time of loan appraisal, has been used. \n \n", "ADB \nCOEP \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nIA \nI&I \nICB \nIEE \nIRAP \nLCB \nLIBOR \nlpcd \nMl(/d) \nMOF \nMWE \nNWQL \nPMU \nPSC \nPWD \nTA \nUFW \nWSC \nWSD \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \ncode of environmental practice \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancial internal rate of return \nimplementing agency \ninflows and infiltration \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \ninstitutional reform action plan \nlocal competitive bidding \nLondon interbank offered rate \nliters per capita per day \nmegaliters (per day) \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Works and Energy \nNational Water Quality Laboratory \nproject management unit \nproject steering committee \nPublic Works Department \ntechnical assistance \nunaccounted-for water \nWater and Sewerage Corporation \nWater and Sewerage Department \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "This report was prepared by N.
