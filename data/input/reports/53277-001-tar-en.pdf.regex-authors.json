THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Macroeconomic context. India\u2019s economy has been growing fast, achieving about 7% \nannual growth since FY2012. The economic structure has also been transformed over time. For \nFY2019, the services sector was the largest contributor to gross domestic product at 54%, \nfollowed by the industry sector (30%) and the agriculture and allied sector (16%). However, 44% \nof the overall workforce are still engaged in the agriculture sector, while 32% are employed in the \nservices sector and 25% in the industry sector. Most new jobs today are being created in \nnonfarming sectors, but a shortage of skilled workers is a critical constraint in meeting education \nand skills requirements of emerging jobs. With rapid technology advances across the sectors, \nlow-skilled jobs are more affected by automation and artificial intelligence, while new emerging \njobs demand higher levels of cognitive and technical skills.1 To achieve sustained and inclusive \neconomic growth, India needs to develop a well-educated, high-skilled workforce who can meet \nchanging skills requirements in the local and global labor markets.  \n \n2.  Progress and issues in education. Over the past 15 years, a series of reforms and \ninitiatives by the government expanded access to schooling, achieving near universal enrollment \nat the primary level. Secondary education also made notable progress, with its gross enrollment \nrate increasing from 52% to 80% at the secondary level and from 29% to 56% at the senior \nsecondary level during 2006\u20132016. Gender parity has been observed across many states, \nalthough the extent of gender gap varies by state. Yet, increased access to schooling has not \nnecessarily resulted in improved learning among students. National studies indicate that many \nstudents do not acquire competencies expected at each grade level, especially basic foundational \nliteracy and numeracy.2 Low levels of learning at the early grades lead to high dropout rates and \nlow completion rates as students move onto higher grades. Learning deficiencies during school \nyears eventually show up as weak skills when the youth enter the labor force. Focused efforts are \nneeded to improve learning outcomes from primary to secondary education and to lay strong \nfoundation for human capital development.  \n \n3.  Quality and relevance of skills training. In preparing the youth for successful transition \ninto the labor force, technical and vocational education and training (TVET) plays a critical role by \nimparting job-ready skills that enhance their employability and productivity. TVET is especially \nimportant for those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, who may not pursue a higher education. \nHowever, fewer than 5% of India\u2019s workforce has undergone formal skills training. In addition, \nTVET across many states has not kept pace with changing market demands, resulting in low job \nplacement rates among graduates from TVET programs such as industrial technical institutes. \nInadequate quality and limited industry relevance of TVET courses are the major issues, which \nresult from outdated training infrastructure and curricula, limited qualifications of trainers, and lack \nof credible assessment and certification systems. To ensure young people are equipped with \nrequisite skills in line with labor market demands, significant improvements are needed in the \nTVET system.  \n \n \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2018. Asian Development Outlook: How Technology Affects Jobs. Manila; McKinsey \nGlobal Institute. 2017. India\u2019s Labour Market: A New Emphasis on Gainful Employment. New Delhi.  \n2  The National Achievement Surveys (NAS), for example, have measured students\u2019 learning since 2001\u20132002. Results \nfrom the 2017 NAS show that one-third of students in grade 3 could not read simple texts with comprehension. For \ngrade 5 and 8 students, the proportion of students who could not perform in grade-specific reading tests were higher, \nat 42% and 44%, respectively.  \n ", "2   \n4.  Demographic challenges and opportunities. India is undergoing a major demographic \ntransformation,  with  a  declining  share  of  the  school-age  population  (aged  5\u201319)  and  the \nincreasing working-age population. By 2026, India will have the world\u2019s largest and youngest \nworking-age population (aged 15\u201359) with 900 million people, who will make up nearly two-thirds \nof the total population. With the largest youthful workforce, India has a great opportunity to \ncapitalize on the demographic dividend for accelerated growth. To reap this demographic dividend, \nthe country needs to equip its young population with quality education and requisite skills to build \na productive and competitive workforce. Education and skills of the workforce are also essential \nin promoting technological progress and innovation, which in turn drives the economy to move up \nthe value chain from simple to more sophisticated, high-value production.  \n \n5.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \nsupporting  education  and  skills  development  initiatives  at  the  state-level,  with  the  aim  of \nincreasing employability and productivity of the youth entering the labor force. Each of state-level \nprojects endeavors to improve the overall TVET system by upgrading training infrastructure, \nenhancing teacher qualifications, and delivering skills programs aligned with local labor demands. \nNew support has been proposed for ADB to address the quality of basic and secondary education \nand to strengthen learning outcomes from school education both at the central and state levels.  \n \n6.  It is important to enhance the capacity and competencies of executing and implementing \nagencies in order to ensure quality project designs, effective project implementation, and overall \nportfolio performance. For successful outcomes of ADB support in the areas of education and \nskills development, consolidating and sharing the lessons and good practices are essential \ntogether with dedicated capacity building for project designs and implementation. The proposed \ntransaction technical assistance (TA) facility would bridge capability gaps, apply best practices, \nand foster innovative solutions for common challenges in the sector. Capacity building support \nwill be provided through the provision of incremental consulting services to enhance project \npreparatory and implementation capacity. The TA facility is listed in the country operations \nbusiness plan (COBP) for India, 2020\u20132022, with the title Supporting Education and Skills \nDevelopment Capacity.3     \n \n7.  The  TA  facility  will  support  project  preparation,  capacity  building,  undertaking  due \ndiligence, and increasing the readiness for pipeline projects, including those identified in the \nCOBP for India, 2020\u20132022. It will initially support the following:  \n \n(i)  Supporting School Education Program in India;  \n(ii)  Kerala Skills Development Project; and  \n(iii)    Supporting State-Level Skills Development Project (for Assam).4 \n \n8.  These projects are all in the education sector, including TVET subsector, and have similar \ndue diligence requirements. The TA facility approach is suitable as it will enhance project \npreparation efficiency, enable the incorporation of lessons in new project designs, and improve \nproject implementation readiness by (i) allowing the same experts and consultants to be mobilized \nfor  similar  due  diligence  activities,  (ii)  facilitating  learning  on  project  processing  and \nimplementation across different projects, (iii) creating synergies from working with common \nexpertise and improving knowledge transfer, and (iv) strengthening coordination among various \n \n3  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2020\u20132022. Manila.  \n4  The project is not listed in the COBP, 2020\u20132022, since it was proposed for ADB financing after COBP finalization. \nThe project proposal is currently undergoing government\u2019s approval process: it received approval from the Niti Aayog \non 3 October 2019 and is waiting for official clearance from the Department of Economic Affairs for ADB to proceed \nwith processing. \n ", "3 \ntechnical inputs and capacity building opportunities. Overall, this TA facility will reduce transaction \ncosts compared to resources required for separate stand-alone transaction TA projects.  \n \n9.  The TA facility will also support ongoing projects as required and agreed with the project\u2019s \nrespective executing and implementing agencies. Given the varying and evolving implementation \ncapacities, ongoing skills development projects often face unanticipated challenges, for example, \nin  the  areas  of  procurement  and  safeguards  which  require  resources  for  assessments  or \nmitigation  measures.  Technical  and  training  support  will  be  provided  to  ensure  project \nsustainability and transfer of capacity and knowledge. Ongoing projects to be supported are the \nfollowing:5 \n \n(i)  Supporting Human Capital Development in Meghalaya; \n(ii)  Supporting Additional Skills Acquisition Program in Kerala; \n(iii)  Himachal Pradesh Skills Development Project; \n(iv)  Odisha Skills Development Project; and \n(v)  Madhya Pradesh Skills Development Project. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Quality education and skills development projects designed and project \nreadiness achieved. Technical expertise will be provided to support the preparation of selected \ninvestment projects for potential ADB financing. The scope of activities will cover (i) analytical \nstudies such as sector assessments, demand assessments involving tracer and/or employer \nsurveys, and stakeholder analysis as appropriate for each ensuing project; (ii) feasibility studies \nas required for the ensuing project; (iii) development of results frameworks or monitoring and \nevaluation frameworks; (iv) economic and financial assessments, and social, gender, and poverty \nanalysis; (v) safeguard assessments including environment and social safeguards; and (vi) due \ndiligence  in  financial  management,  procurement,  plus  other  institutional  arrangements  for \nexecuting and implementing agencies. The output will also support ensuing projects to achieve \nproject readiness through advance procurement activities.   \n \n11.  Output  2:  Project  implementation  and  management  capacity  of  executing  and \nimplementing agencies improved. Technical expertise and capacity building will be provided to \nselected  executing  and  implementing  agencies  of  ongoing  skills  development  projects  for \nsuccessful implementation and sustainability. Support will be provided for common critical areas, \nsuch  as  setting  up  quality  training  facilities,  specifications  of  quality  training  equipment, \nestablishment  of  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems,  and  ensuring  financial \nmanagement and procurement capacity for timely implementation and sustainability. Along with \nexpert advice, seminars or workshops will be offered across multiple projects.  \n  \n12.  Output 3: Capacity of executing and implementing agencies strengthened to apply \ninnovative practices and technology solutions for project design and implementation.  \nTechnical expertise and capacity building will be provided through learning and sharing of national \nand international best practices in education and TVET interventions, which can be incorporated \ninto project designs for ensuing projects as well as during implementation of ongoing projects. \nThe topics will cover such areas as the use of information and communication technology \nsolutions or EdTech programs in classroom practices, teacher training, and leadership capacities, \nwhich aim to augment students\u2019 learning of foundation skills, technical skills, and soft skills. \nSupport will be provided through seminars, workshops, and national and overseas study visits.  \n \n5  The approved Report and Recommendation of the President of the indicative ongoing projects are in Appendix 3. \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The TA facility scope is expected to expand to cover \nother additional activities, consistent with the TA\u2019s outputs and activities, and be replenished from \ntime to time as funds are required and identified.  \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, workshop facilities, office supplies, secretarial and coordination assistance, and other in-\nkind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance ensuing projects. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance will be the executing \nagency of the TA facility. ADB through the South Asia Human and Social Development Division \n(SAHS) will be responsible for TA facility administration and will work closely with the executing \nand state line departments for the ongoing and planned projects. ADB will be responsible for the \nrecruitment, management, and administration of all consultants financed by the TA facility. ADB \nwill inform the Department of Economic Affairs and the relevant state line departments of selected \nconsultants prior to their mobilization.  \n \n16.  The TA facility will be implemented over 2.5 years, from January 2020 to June 2022. \nDisbursement under the TA facility will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table below. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2020\u2013June 2022 \nExecuting agency  Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance \nImplementing agencies  National  and  state-level  government  agencies  that  are  preparing \nensuing projects and/or implementing ongoing projects.

Consulting services. The TA facility will initially provide 77 person-months\u2019 consultant \ninputs (24 person-months international and 53 person-months national) to support the preparation \n ", "5 \nof ensuing projects and implementation of ongoing projects. The consultants will be recruited \nusing individual consultant selection method and deployed based on the requirements of each \nproject being prepared or implemented. Individual consultant selection, rather than firm selection, \nis  considered  appropriate,  because  the  TA  facility  involves  multiple  activities  that  are  not \nnecessarily interdependent and will require a varied range of consultants and services. The TA \nfacility will also recruit one firm to carry out demand assessments for ensuing skills projects, which \nmay include a tracer study and/or an employer study depending on the availability of existing data \nand information. Since the work is considered a small assignment, the firm will be recruited using \nconsultant qualification selection and bio-data technical proposal. ADB will engage consultants \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nproject administration instructions and/or staff instructions.6  \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nIndia for Supporting Education and Skills Development Facility and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board.  \n \n6  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Amount \nA.
