THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL), to \nbe guaranteed by India, for the Accelerating Infrastructure Investment Facility in India. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2.  The  MFF  involves  a  sovereign  loan  of  $700  million  to  IIFCL  to  support  renewed \ngovernment  efforts  to  accelerate  infrastructure  growth  through  increased  private  sector \ninvestment given competing pressures for fiscal resources.  \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Importance of infrastructure financing for development. India\u2019s infrastructure deficit \nis  arguably  the  critical  development  challenge  facing  the  country.  The  weak  state  of \ninfrastructure represents a drag on higher, sustainable gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nreflecting  supply-side  constraints. It  impedes  economic  development  and  poverty reduction \nefforts.1 To meet the growing aspirations of its citizens including for better service delivery, India \nwill have to identify new means to expand infrastructure financing given limits on fiscal space, \nexternal commercial borrowing, and bank balance sheets. The solution to overcoming these \nlimits lies in part on increasingly leveraging private capital. To achieve the targeted real GDP \ngrowth rate of 8.4% in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2012\u20132017), the government estimates \ninfrastructure investment of about $1 trillion will be required. Of this, about 47% is targeted to \ncome from private capital as compared with about 38% under the Eleventh Plan and 22% under \nthe Tenth Plan. 2  \n \n4.  Infrastructure  financing  gap. The infrastructure investment funding gap during the \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan is estimated to be about $113 billion. The government projects sourcing \nthe shortfall from the private sector.3 \n \n5.  Infrastructure challenges across sectors. According to the 2012 report of the Reserve \nBank of India (RBI), the total fixed investment by large firms in new projects, led mainly by \ninfrastructure and metals, which were sanctioned financial support during FY2011, dropped by \n46% compared with the previous year. Investments in infrastructure during FY2012 declined by \n52%.4  The unfavorable investment climate includes increasing losses of public sector utilities, \ndelays in legal and environmental clearances for roads, and constraints in availability of finance \nto project companies that are already leveraged and unable to raise more debt in the absence \nof fresh equity capital including quasi equity. All these factors contribute to the recent slowdown \nin infrastructure investment.5  \n \n                                                \n1  According to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report, India ranked 82nd of 142 countries \nduring 2010\u20132013. \n2  According to the interim report of the high-level committee on financing of infrastructure of August 2012, GDP is \nassumed to grow at 7% in FY2012, 8% in FY2013, and 9% for the remainder of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. \n3  A detailed estimate on the infrastructure financing gap is provided in the Framework Financing Agreement \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  Reserve Bank of India. 2012. Reserve Bank of India Annual Report 2011\u201312. Mumbai. \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Infrastructure Financing (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n ", "2     \n \n6.  Financing  challenges.  To  date,  the  banking  sector  has  been  the  main  driver  of \ninfrastructure financing in India. However, it is facing increasing challenges in addressing the \ninfrastructure\u2013financing gap. First, high credit expansion for infrastructure in recent years has \nresulted in an increasing asset\u2013liability mismatch for banks. Second, banks are approaching \nexposure  limits  to  borrowers  and  infrastructure  sectors.  Third,  the  asset  quality  of  banks \ndeteriorated considerably during the half year ending September 2012 with the gross (net) \nnonperforming advances ratio for all banks rising sharply to 3.6% (1.7%) from 2.9% (1.2%) as of \nend March 2012. Should the slowdown in GDP growth persist and interest rates remain at \ncurrent levels, estimates suggest the risk of further increases in nonperforming loans.  \n \n7.  Equity availability. Based on a 70:30 debt equity mix, $500 billion funding in private \ncapital implies mobilizing $150 billion of equity over the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. While the sector \nhas  a  market  capitalization  of  $55  billion  (50%  promoter  share),  generating  $95  billion  of \nadditional equity will be a challenge. A periodic dilution of promoters\u2019 share may not be possible \ndue to contract restrictions; excessive dilution will suppress the market. As most infrastructure \ncompanies do not generate significant free cash flow, new equity will have to come from new \nfund raising. However, markets can be unfavorable due to limitations on exit options hindering \nthe raising of equity.  \n \n8.  Other  nonbank  financing.  Historically,  development  finance  institutions  (DFIs) 6 \nprovided infrastructure finance, raising low-cost, long-term funds from multilateral and bilateral \nagencies and government-guaranteed bonds. As DFIs were exposed to high-risk sectors like \ninfrastructure, they were dependent on government equity. Thus, the government decided which \nDFIs to support and which to convert into a bank or nonbank finance company (NBFC).7 \nConsequently, several former DFIs such as Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of \nIndia and Industrial Development Bank of India became universal banks. In 2003, RBI set up a \nworking group to address the regulatory and supervisory issues of DFIs, within the broader \nNBFC framework.8 The working group suggested that the exclusive role of DFIs as providers of \ndevelopment finance is unnecessary and that banks may extend project finance and develop \nrequired skills. More recently, RBI indicated that NBFCs and banks will be subject to similar \nasset classification, income recognition and provisioning norms, and prudential measures for \nsystemic risk.9 Thus, the flexibility of NBFC operations may be reduced in the future.10  \n \n9.  In this context, IIFCL is the only DFI that receives both periodic government equity \ninfusion and guarantees for its borrowings.11 Thus, to justify government support and to respond \nto  evolving  market  needs,  IIFCL  operations  are  increasingly  geared  to  leveraging  market \n                                                \n6  Other NBFCs, such as Rural Electrification Corporation and Power Finance Corporation, have a limited subsector \nfocus and do not have a specific public\u2013private partnership mandate. \n7  Reserve Bank of India. 1998. Narasimham Committee on Banking Sector Reforms. Mumbai.  \n8  In 2003, RBI set up a working group to examine, within the broader framework of NBFCs, regulatory and \nsupervisory aspects including access to short-term resources for the DFIs as a separate category. \n9  The time for classifying a loan as a nonperforming asset for an NBFC will be reduced from the existing 180 days to \n120 days from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, and ultimately to 90 days (bank standard). \n10 Reserve Bank of India. 2011. Working Group on the Issues and Concerns in the NBFC Sector Report and \nRecommendations. Mumbai. \n11 IIFCL was established on 5 January 2006 as a wholly owned government company with the mandate to (i) play a \ncatalytic role by leveraging resources and specialized skills, and (ii) be a nodal public-private partnership (PPP) \nfinancing agency as an integral element of the overall PPP development strategy. IIFCL provides commercial long-\nterm debt financing for stand-alone nonrecourse infrastructure projects, such as project-specific special purpose \nvehicles established for PPP. \n ", "3 \n \nresources and complementing bank financing by expanding its products to include take-out \nfinancing,12 subordinate debt, and credit enhancements.  \n \n10.  Policy framework: developing an enabling environment. Against the backdrop of \nthese challenges, the government identified the need for further reforms to enhance private \nsector participation in infrastructure. These include strengthening  public\u2013private partnership \n(PPP)  support;13 promoting  project  finance  schemes  in  infrastructure  development;14 and \ndeveloping new sources of take-out project bond financing, including infrastructure debt funds.15 \nWith these reforms in place, the government plans to accelerate infrastructure investment to \nabove 9% of GDP during the Twelfth Plan compared with 7% during the Eleventh Plan. The \ngovernment  has  also targeted  IIFCL,  an  apex  organization  established for  promoting  PPP \nprojects, to play a larger role in infrastructure financing. As such, the government amended \nIIFCL\u2019s scheme for financing viable infrastructure (SIFTI) to accommodate the need of the \nmarket for subordinate debt and added a new scheme, Take-out Finance Scheme for Financing \nViable Infrastructure Projects.16 \n \n11.  The  proposed  facility  has  two  pillars:  (i)  positioning  IIFCL  to  play  a  larger  role  in \ninfrastructure financing with newly introduced financial products and modalities; and (ii) building \non the strong relationship and successful performance of previous Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) facilities with IIFCL support for PPPs.17 The facility will involve a sovereign loan to IIFCL18 \nto support three main areas: (i) direct lending, including to renewable and clean energy; (ii) take-\nout financing; and (iii) subordinate debt, all in line with the scheme. IIFCL provides up to 20% of \nits business in direct lending, resulting in efficient capital allocation for lending consortium \nmembers.  \n \n12.  The new initiative to include the take-out financing option in the facility would help \naddress the exposure and asset\u2013liability mismatch constraints of banks and provide space for \n                                                \n12  Take-out financing is a method of providing long-term financing for projects by banks. Under this method, the loan \nwill be taken out of books of the financing bank within the pre-fixed period, by another institution, thereby \npreventing any possible asset-liability mismatch.  \n13 ADB provided a total of eight technical assistance projects of $11.8 million during 2006-\u20132010 for mainstreaming \nPPPs at both the state and central governments of India as well as for capacity building for IIFCL.  \n14 As pilot demonstration project finance, ADB financed the Bangalore Metro Project under its nonsovereign window \nin 2011.

Under the SIFTI, IIFCL lends to project special purpose vehicles of PPP \nprojects up to a maximum of 20% of the total project cost as part of a lending consortium. Further, under the SIFTI, \nthe project special purpose vehicle has its loan appraised by a lead bank or by a reputed institution.

Manila (MFF 0017-IND, approved \non 20 December, $500 million); ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors: Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to India for the Second India Infrastructure Project Financing \nFacility. Manila (MFF 0037-IND, approved on 17 November, $700 million). \n18 IIFCL has $1 billion of authorized capital and $500 million paid-up capital. Apart from equity, IIFCL raises long-term \ndebt from the domestic market and debt from bilateral and multilateral institutions. IIFCL\u2019s borrowings are backed \nby a sovereign guarantee. \n ", "4     \n \nnew bank lending.19 In addition, IIFCL offers take-out at financial close to take-out a portion of \nbank debt after project completion. The terms are based on subproject ratings and can result in \nlong-term borrowing cost reduction. Thus, a key value addition of the facility is to provide long-\nterm resources to IIFCL to sustain the long-term take-out finance option. The support for IIFCL's \nsubordinate debt product through the proposed facility will enable overleveraged subproject \ndevelopers  in  raising  additional  debt  without  having  to  raise  additional  equity  and  assist \nsubprojects in achieving financial closure. In addition, the facility will include new areas such as \ngreen  and  renewable  energy  to  support  government  efforts  to  meet  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and support PPP initiatives in lagging states for inclusive growth.  \n \n13.  Multitranche  financing  facility.  The MFF modality is well suited for PPPs as PPP \nsubprojects  are  typically  developed  in  a  phased  manner  based  on  project  implementation \nrequirements. 20 The MFF modality provides IIFCL with flexibility to release financing in line with \nsubproject readiness based on achievement of phased benchmarks including finalization of risk-\nsharing  arrangements,  readiness  of  engineering  and  procurement  contracts,  and  phased \nrelease of equity by subproject promoters. In addition, disbursement of a subproject can take \nplace through multiple tranches with the introduction of time-slicing in the MFF. This provides \nthe much-needed flexibility for IIFCL to properly and cost-effectively plan the disbursements of \nsubprojects allocated for financing under the facility. \n \n14.  ADB assistance to IIFCL and performance.21 To support government initiatives to \nmainstream PPP in infrastructure development, ADB provided two MFFs totaling $1.2 billion to \nIIFCL  under  the  India  Infrastructure  Project  Financing  Facility  (IIPFF)  (footnote  17).  The  \nIIPFF I (comprising two tranches) was fully disbursed for 30 PPP infrastructure subprojects, \nincluding major international airports such as the Delhi and Mumbai international airports. It \nachieved financial closure on 26 August 2011, ahead of the target closure date. The IIPFF II for \n$700 million  comprises  three  tranches.  To  date,  the  first  and  second  tranches,  totaling \n$460 million, were fully disbursed well ahead of the target closing date (December 2014) for  \n14 subprojects. The third and final tranche, approved by ADB Management in December 2011, \nis also performing well with disbursement to date of $118.90 million for 10 subprojects. ADB \nexpects to disburse the entire third tranche of $240 million by November 2013, 1 year ahead of \nthe target closing date. The average fund mobilization ratio of these two facilities is about  \n12 times, which means that every dollar drawn down from the facilities has mobilized $12 of \nadditional funding.  \n \n15.  Strategic  context.  The  ADB  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u22122012  for  India \nemphasizes infrastructure development and is based on four pillars: (i) supporting inclusive and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, (ii) catalyzing investment, (iii) increasing results orientation \nand knowledge solutions, and (iv) supporting regional cooperation.22 The facility supports all \npillars given the link between growth and infrastructure development and the need to mobilize \nfinancing.23 The strategy also supports the role of financial intermediaries for providing long-\n                                                \n19 Infrastructure projects are initially funded by banks or a consortium of banks. Such projects require long-term \nfunding of 20\u201325 years, while traditional bank funding cannot be extended beyond 10\u201312 years. \n20 ADB. 2005. Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Manila. \n21 The evaluation of benefits and impacts of the two IIPFFs shows that they have generated significant benefits. They \nsupported upgrading and expansion of more than 1,800 kilometers of the road network across India and added \n3,200 megawatts of power generation capacity. Given that on average 20,000 person-days of employment are \ngenerated per kilometer of road construction, the IIPFFs have resulted in about 36 million person-days of \nemployment. This employment opportunity has significantly benefited rural workers in the unorganized sector.  \n22 ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n23 Accordingly, the proposed facility will support PPP infrastructure projects under the SIFTI. \n ", "5 \n \nterm infrastructure financing and supports the PPP modality, which is consistent with the draft \ncountry partnership strategy for 2013\u20132017.  \n \n16.  Lessons. The facility incorporates lessons from earlier financial intermediation loans for \ninfrastructure  and,  in  particular,  from  implementing  the  IIPFFs.24 First,  building  a  strong \npartnership  among  stakeholders  including  subproject  developers,  executing  agency, \ngovernment, and ADB is essential to meaningfully pursue PPP development in India. Therefore, \na holistic approach has been taken to support the government\u2019s infrastructure development \npriorities and assist executing agencies with capacity building, policy advice, and provision of \nfinancing to promote PPP. Second, the facility supports IIFCL\u2019s ability to leverage resources and \nexpand the infrastructure investor base, and sustain a tested business model that has resulted \nin  a  robust  pipeline  of  projects.  Third,  while  IIFCL  follows  the  lead  bank  in  the  lending \nconsortium with respect to credit terms, its risk profile and appetite is different from the lead \nbanks. Thus going forward, IIFCL could use its resources to price its loans differently from the \nlead bank. In addition, as the facility will also support take-out financing and subordinate debt, \nan additional innovation of offering take-out financing for a part of the loan after commercial \noperation commences, at the time of financial closure itself, may also be explored through the \nfacility.25  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The impact of the facility will be the increased availability of infrastructure. The outcome \nwill be facilitated private sector investment in infrastructure PPPs. This will be achieved by \nsupporting the evolution of the market for new financial products and modalities. \n \nC.  Outputs \n18.  The outputs will be enhanced availability of long-term finance for PPP subprojects and \nimproved project management. The indicative pipeline of subprojects will be subject to due \ndiligence to ensure conformity with ADB requirements.26 Subprojects will be financed for roads, \nrailways, airports, energy (including renewable energy), and urban infrastructure. The pipeline \ncomprises 31 subprojects for direct lending, including subordinate debt and take-out financing. \nUp to $300 million of bank capital is expected to be released for new greenfield projects by \nFY2018. For tranche 1, 12\u201314 subprojects from the pipeline for the facility will be taken up for \nfinancing. Tranche 2 will include tranche 1 subprojects that are still in construction phase and \n15\u201317 new subprojects. Increased use of subordinate debt and take-out finance modalities may \nbe envisaged based on market requirements.  \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n19.  By the end of March 2013, IIFCL had a pipeline of 300 sanctioned projects27 with a total \nproject  cost  of  Rs4,631.8  billion  ($89.1  billion),  of  which  IIFCL  financing  is  estimated  at \nRs537.6 billion ($10.3 billion). The IIFCL pipeline is expected to grow on average by 40\u201350 \n                                                \n24 The IIPFF I is rated highly successful. ADB. 2012.

IIFCL has requested an MFF in an amount up to $700 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance a part of the IIFCL\u2019s investment program. Accordingly, the MFF \nis included in the India country operations business plan for FY2013. The proposed facility will \ncapture approximately 7.4% of the IIFCL financing plan during the investment period. The MFF \nwill comprise two tranches of $400 million and $300 million respectively, subject to IIFCL\u2019s \nsubmission of related periodic financing requests (PFRs), execution of the related loan and \nguarantee  agreements  for  each  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and \nundertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF will \nhave a 19.5-year term, including a grace period of 4 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nand guarantee agreements.  \n \n21.

ADB  coordinated  with  development \npartners  during  processing  and  implementation  of  its  first  two  MFFs  to  IIFCL,  as  well  as \nprocessing of the proposed facility. Coordination efforts with development partners are aimed at \navoiding  duplication  of  resources  and  exploring  possible  cofinancing,  as  well  as  providing \ncontinued capacity building support to IIFCL for institutional strengthening, particularly in the \nareas  of  safeguards  and  financial  management.  Development  partners  such  as  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW,  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank either have ongoing lines of credit with \nIIFCL or are in discussions for possible lending. Some development partners have indicated \ntheir interest in the possibility of providing cofinancing with ADB in a subsequent tranche of the \nfacility.29  \n \n22.  Framework  financing  agreement.  IIFCL  and  the  government  have  entered  into  a \nframework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB. The FFA satisfies requirements established in \nADB\u2019s  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative.  The  FFA  records  the  full  set  of  assurances, \nwarranties,  and  representations  on  cross-cutting  themes  covering  safeguards,  governance, \nanticorruption, financial management, procurement, disbursement, and subproject selection. \n                                                \n28 IIFCL  sanctioned  37  (Rs74,020  million)  new  projects  in  FY2011,  47  (Rs69,140  million)  in  FY2012,  and  \n66 (Rs69,140 million) in FY2013. \n29 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n \nThe government and IIFCL have ensured full compliance with the terms and conditions of the \nFFA before submission of the PFR to ADB. \n \n23.  Periodic financing request. Subloans will be extended under the facility to a range of \nsubprojects subject to submission of the related PFR by IIFCL and execution of related loan and \nguarantee agreements. Each PFR will be accompanied by a list of identified subprojects. IIFCL \nhas submitted the first PFR in line with the FFA. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe facility administration manual.30 \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2014\u2013March 2019 \nJanuary 2014\u2013December 2016 (tranche 1) \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2019 \nDecember 2016 (tranche 1) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Harsh Kumar Bhanwala \nExecutive director, presently holding charge of chairman and \nmanaging director \n(ii)  Executing agency  India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited  \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Chief general manager  \nSource: India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited. \n \n25.  Project management. IIFCL will be the executing and implementing agency. The IIFCL \nboard will provide policy direction and strategic oversight. The IIFCL project management unit, \nestablished at the inception of the IIPFF I, will monitor day-to-day implementation of the facility. \nThe environment and social safeguards management unit (ESMU), established in February \n2010 at the inception of the IIPFF II, will be responsible for compliance with state and national \npolicies and the environmental and social safeguards framework (ESSF) of IIFCL.31  \n \n26.  Maximum  subloan  size  and  free  limit.  As IIFCL  can  only  finance up  to  20% of \nsubproject cost for direct lending and up to 30% for take-out financing, ADB will not stipulate \nany additional limitation on subloan size. Under each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies \nand procedures, permit on request a free limit for the borrower for up to $30 million of the \nqualified subproject financed under the SIFTI. A suitable free limit for the subproject financed \nunder the take-out finance scheme may be considered for the second tranche, based on ADB \nassessment  of  IIFCL\u2019s  operating  performance,  appraisal  standards,  portfolio  quality,  and \naverage loan size on take-out finance during facility implementation. \n \n27.  Retroactive  financing.  Under  each  tranche,  ADB  may,  subject  to  its  policies  and \nprocedures, permit on request retroactive financing of eligible expenditures for the facility up to \n20% of the individual loan, incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months \nbefore the date of signing of the related legal agreement. IIFCL acknowledges that any approval \n                                                \n30 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 The ESSF was developed with ADB assistance in 2007, updated in 2010 to reflect the adoption of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), and further revised in July 2013. \n ", "8     \n \nof advance contracting and/or retroactive financing will not constitute a commitment by ADB to \nfinance the related project. \n \n28.  Subproject  and  subborrower  selection  criteria  and  approval  procedures.  The \nscheme provides the details of the definitions, eligibility criteria, appraisal, and monitoring and \nlending terms for subprojects. Thus, the eligibility requirements for subproject and subborrower \nselection criteria of the facility will adhere to the scheme, which includes appraisal of the \nsubproject  by  the  designated  specialized  appraisal  agency  for  technical,  economic,  and \ncommercial viability and review, and acceptance of the results of the appraisal by the lead \nbank.32 In addition, subborrowers will be required to meet ADB requirements and follow the \nsubproject approval procedure details stipulated in the loan agreement, FFA, and the facility \nadministration manual. The assessment of compliance with undertakings under the FFA and \nloan agreements of the IIPFF II confirms that IIFCL is in full compliance.33  \n \n29.  Procurement and disbursement. All goods and services to be financed under the \nfacility will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The individual loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) under chapter 11 for \ndevelopment finance institutions.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n30.  The facility is expected to catalyze an investment estimated at more than $5 billion from \nthe private sector to finance 30 subprojects. While the projects sanctioned by IIFCL are spread \nacross all infrastructure subsectors, most subprojects identified for the facility are mainly for \nroads and energy. The economic efficiency of road projects is typically high with an economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of 25%\u201330% and financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 10%\u2013\n15%. The estimates are also robust from a sensitivity perspective with the EIRRs and FIRRs not \ndeclining  significantly  even  in  worst-case  scenarios.  Further,  the  EIRRs  and  FIRRs  are \nsignificantly above the opportunity cost of capital. The facility is also expected to finance roads, \npower, and airport projects where EIRR estimates meet benchmark requirements.34  \n \nB.  Governance \n31.  Financial management. IIFCL has the financial management capacity to administer the \nfacility. IIFCL board members actively oversee operations and have suitable industry and policy \nbackgrounds. IIFCL staffing has significantly increased since the inception of the IIPFF I and it \nhas meanwhile deepened its technical capacities. Accounting policies are well established and \nfollow national statutes. IIFCL is currently upgrading its management information systems. The \nnew system, which IIFCL has agreed to implement within 6 months of the facility\u2019s signing, will \nrepresent a significant enhancement and improve internal reporting. Given the government\u2019s \n                                                \n32 IIFCL's scheme requires IIFCL to only finance commercially viable projects and provide financing on commercial \nterms and price loans accordingly. Thus, all aspects of project economics and creditworthiness with regard to \nsubprojects are subject to extensive due diligence prior to loan approval by IIFCL.  \n33 Compliance Review Matrix of Legal, Environmental, and Social Safeguards of the Second India Infrastructure \nProject Financing Facility (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 The EIRRs of ADB-funded energy projects in India were higher than 12% (ranging from 13% to 31.5%), implying \neconomic efficiency in resource allocation and use. Independent Evaluation Department. 2007. Sector Assistance \nProgram Evaluation: Energy Sector in India. Manila: ADB. Research conducted by a local research firm in India in \n2012 shows the EIRR of four road projects at 16%\u201321%.  \n ", "9 \n \nhistorical and expected support, IIFCL should have sufficient equity to absorb the $700 million \nfacility without breaching its regulatory capital requirements.35  \n \n32.  Anticorruption  policy.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to examine and review directly any \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the subprojects under the \nMFF. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended from time to time) was explained to and discussed with IIFCL and the government. \nThe specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the facility \nadministration manual (footnote 30).  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n33.  Infrastructure development strongly impacts poverty incidence by supporting inclusive \ngrowth. A recent ADB empirical study indicates that the higher the overall productivity growth, \nthe faster is the pace of poverty reduction.36 The anticipated key impact of the MFF will be \nthrough greater affordability of high-quality infrastructure facilities that stimulates productivity \nincreases, which in turn increase employment and income opportunities leading to poverty \nreduction.  The  poor  are  acutely  affected  by  inadequate  infrastructure  that  impedes \ndiversification and improvement of their livelihoods. Shocks to the national economy, such as \nthe rationing of the supply of electricity will particularly impact many people who depend on \nsmall enterprises in the informal sector for their livelihood.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n34.  In  2007,  ADB  assisted  IIFCL  in  formulating  its  safeguard  policy  and  framework  in \nconsultation with development partners. The environmental and social safeguards framework \n(ESSF) was updated during the processing of the IIPFF II in 2010.37 IIFCL again revised and \nupdated the ESSF in July 2013 to reflect recent legislative and regulatory changes pertaining to \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  and  changes  in  safeguard  policies  of  development \npartners.  IIFCL  has  uploaded  the  ESSF  on  its  website.  It  will  continue  to  ensure  that  all \nsubproject  proposals,  to  be  financed  under  the  facility,  comply  with  ESSF  safeguard \nrequirements. Safeguard compliance performance during the IIPFF I and II was found to be \nsatisfactory.38 IIFCL is in the process of further strengthening its ESMU with an adequate \nnumber of qualified specialists in environmental and social safeguards to be headed by a senior \nsafeguard professional. The ESMU will be supported by an external consulting organization \nand/or specialists to conduct field visits, safeguard assessments, monitoring, and review. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  Potential key risks are mostly related to the impact of continued financial market volatility \nrecently observed in India and in particular (i) significant increase in borrowing costs making \n                                                \n35 IIFCL\u2019s current capital adequacy ratio is 18.2%. Net nonperforming assets were nil in FY2009\u2013FY2012 and 0.7% in \nFY2012\u2013FY2013. Further details on IIFCL\u2019s financial management are provided in the Financial Management \nAssessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n36 R. Hasan et.al. 2013. Working paper on Growth, Structural Change, and Poverty Reduction: Evidence from India. \nManila: ADB. The paper finds that a 1 percentage point increase in the annual rate of productivity growth leads to a \n0.64 percentage point increase in the annual rate of poverty reduction. \n37 Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 Compliance Review Matrix of Legal, Environmental, and Social Safeguards of the Second India Infrastructure \nProject Financing Facility (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10     \n \nfinancial closure difficult, and (ii) deterioration in IIFCL\u2019s portfolio from a weakening currency \nand  other  related  factors.  These  risks  are  unlikely  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  IIFCL \noperations and can be effectively mitigated. The integrated benefits and impacts of the facility \nare expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.39 A short analysis of the impact of financial \nmarket volatility is provided as a supplementary document.40  \n \n36.  Climate change. A screening report for subprojects under the facility has been prepared \nfor climate change risks on subprojects. Screening criteria to score subprojects used a score of \n1  indicating  low  risk  and  2  indicating  higher  risk  for  risks  stemming  from  sea  level  rise, \nlandslides due to precipitation, and others. Thus, the facility will prioritize supporting subprojects \nby declining level of risk.41  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n37.  IIFCL and the government have assured ADB that implementation of the facility shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n38.  IIFCL and the government have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are \nset forth in the FFA. Specific covenants agreed by IIFCL and the government with respect to \nindividual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan agreement and guarantee agreement \nfor the respective tranches.  \n \n39.  Conditions for loan effectiveness. As a condition precedent to the loan effectiveness \nof  the  first  tranche,  IIFCL  will  fully  staff  its  ESMU.  As  conditions  precedent  to  the  loan \neffectiveness of the  second tranche, IIFCL will have (i) instituted quarterly reporting to its \nboard\u2019s risk management committee, (ii) installed an integrated risk management information \nsystem, and (iii) regularized the position of the ESMU head. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $700,000,000 to India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited, to be \nguaranteed by India, for the Accelerating Infrastructure Investment Facility in India, from ADB's \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the framework financing agreement \npresented to the Board.  \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao  \nPresident \n5 September 2013\n                                                \n39 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n40 Recent Rupee Depreciation and Financial Risks Associated with India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Climate Change Preliminary Risk Assessment Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased  Infrastructure investment to  For all indicators for  Delivery mechanisms \navailability of  increase to reach 10% of GDP  impact:  and enabling \ninfrastructure   by FY2023 (baseline: average  Planning Commission  environment for \ninvestment over Eleventh Five- infrastructure reports,  infrastructure \nYear Plan at 7.22% of GDP)  annual economic survey  investment \nPrivate investment accounts for  of India  strengthened \n47% of total infrastructure  RBI banking survey and   \ninvestment by FY2023 (baseline:  annual reports    \n \nprivate sector investment at 38% \n \nof total infrastructure investment \nin Eleventh Five-Year Plan)   \nOutcome      Assumptions \nFacilitated  Catalyzing over  $3.5 billion of  IIFCL annual reports    Sector-specific reforms \nprivate sector  private sector investment for  Infrastructure sector  continue \ninvestment in  financially closing subprojects by  reports from research  Equity investors remain \ninfrastructure  FY2019  institutions   engaged in \nPPPs     infrastructure \nRisk \nBorrowing costs \nincrease significantly \nmaking financial closure \ndifficult \n \nOutput      Assumption \n1.
