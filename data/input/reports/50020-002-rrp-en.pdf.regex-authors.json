THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Power Network Development Project. \n \n2.  The project will construct two 230-kilovolt (kV) transmission lines (of about 300 kilometers) \nwith five 230 kV substations, 48 medium-voltage substations, and 843 kilometers of distribution \nlines  in  various  states  and  regions  in  Myanmar.  The  project  will  install,  for  the  first  time, \ncomputerized systems to improve operational efficiency and reduce losses in the transmission \nand distribution systems. Such computerized systems will be introduced as a first step toward \ndigitizing power system management in Myanmar.1 The project will help increase the electricity \nsupply in support of inclusive and sustainable development and achieve the country\u2019s target of \nuniversal electricity access by 2030. It is included in the country operations business plan, 2017\u2013\n2019 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Myanmar.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Decades of isolation and internal conflicts left Myanmar one of the poorest countries in \nAsia. In 2010, 37.5% of the 52 million population lived below the poverty line.3 In 2012, Myanmar \nre-engaged  with  the  international  community  initiating  wide-ranging  reforms  including \ndemocratization, macro-economic policy adjustments and structural reforms. Since then, the \neconomy grew steadily at more than 7% GDP growth per year, peaking at 8.4% in 2014,4 and \npoverty declined to 26.1% by 2015 (footnote 3). Much of Myanmar\u2019s economic growth has been \npowered by the private sector. However, according to the World Bank Doing Business survey, \nMyanmar is ranked 151 out of 190 countries and lowest among the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations in terms of adequacy of electricity services.5 Moreover, continued internal conflicts \nremain a significant challenge for Myanmar\u2019s development, and consistent efforts are required to \nresolve the long-standing conflicts. The project aims to provide one of the most critical public \nservices as a means of economic development and conflict resolution. \n \n4.  Myanmar  has  one  of  the  lowest  electrification  rates  in  Asia,  with  only  35%  of  the \nhouseholds having access to electricity in 2016, and with wide rural and urban disparity. While \nelectrification rates were 78% in Yangon, rural areas were significantly lower, with the lowest rates \nin Tanintharyi (9%), Rakhine (13%), Ayeyarwady (14%) and Kayin (16%).6 Moreover, these are \nsome of the poorest areas within the country. Given the severe lack of electricity in these areas, \nthe economic and social development divide with urban areas persists, notably for business \ndevelopment and the provision of basic services such as health care and education. \n \n5.  The government has recognized the need to prioritize rural and underserved areas to \npromote economic opportunities for all as well as peace and stability. In response, the Myanmar \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing the Power \nNetwork Development Project (TA 9179). \n2  ADB. 2016.

Government response. The government has initiated policy and institutional reforms to \nimprove the efficiency of investment, operation, and management of the power sector and has \nmobilized  resources  to  upgrade  and  expand  power  infrastructure.8  Its  long-term  power \ndevelopment plans include (i) rehabilitating and constructing power plants to increase generating \ncapacity;  (ii)  expanding  and  upgrading  the  transmission  network  to  remove  transmission \nconstraints; and (iii) expanding distribution systems to connect more consumers to the electricity \ngrid, particularly in underserved rural areas.9 \n \n7.  Investment requirement. To meet the $35 billion\u2013$40 billion required for the National \nElectricity Master Plan, the government mobilizes private investment for power generation where \nmore competition is desirable. It will develop the transmission network through public finance, \nconsidering economies of scale and the capacity to enable open access to generating sources. \nAlso, the government has started corporatizing the large distribution utilities to encourage their \nfinancial autonomy. \n \n8.  Generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  The  private  sector  has  responded \npositively  to  investing  in  power  generation.10  Development  partners  have  also  funded  the \nrehabilitation of aging plants and financed new ones.11 While these projects reduce immediate \nsupply constraints, more generating capacity is needed to meet rising demand, requiring about \n$20 billion in investment. The transmission network needs urgent rehabilitation and expansion to \n(i) connect the increasing generation capacity in the north with the major demand in central and \nsouthern Myanmar; and (ii) reduce transmission and distribution losses, which average 6%\u20138% \nfor transmission (as high as 20% in some regions) and 13% for distribution. Transmission network \ndevelopment requires about $7 billion; distribution system upgrading, and expansion requires \nabout $10 billion. \n \n9.  Policy reforms. Support from ADB, JICA, the World Bank, and others has enabled the \ngovernment to implement policy and institutional reforms. These include creating a transparent \nmechanism for setting cost-reflected electricity tariffs, establishing an independent regulatory \nbody to mobilize private investment, and corporatizing electricity supply entities to increase \nefficiency. \n \n                                                \n7  Government of Myanmar. 2018.

Unpublished. \n9  The government prepared its (i) National Electricity Master Plan, updated since 2017, with Japan International \nCooperation Agency (JICA) support; (ii) the National Electrification Plan with World Bank support, and (iii) the \nMyanmar Energy Master Plan with ADB support (ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Union of \nMyanmar for Enhancing the Power Sector\u2019s Legal and Regulatory Framework. Manila [TA 8469]). \n10 The private sector has submitted numerous proposals for hydro, solar, and thermal power plants. In 2018, the MOEE \nissued notices to proceed to six privately financed generation projects totaling more than 4,000 MW. \n11 Those projects include (i) the MOEE\u2019s addition of new hydropower plants and gas-fired plants; (ii) JICA-assisted \nrehabilitation of gas-fired plants in Yangon ($140 million loan) and Thilawa ($100 million loan) and the Baluchaung \nhydropower plant ($70 million grant); (iii) the World Bank Group-assisted Thaton gas-fired plant ($140 million loan); \nand (iv) the ADB-supported nonsovereign Myingyan power plant (ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and Guarantee for the Myingyan Natural Gas Power Project in \nMyanmar. Manila [Loan 3359]). \n \n ", "3 \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. Since 2012, ADB has provided $4.7 million in technical \nassistance to help (i) prepare the Electricity Law (2014) and the energy master plan and (ii) draft \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency policies.12 ADB has also provided (i) $140 million from \nthe Asian Development Fund to upgrade electricity infrastructure, and (ii) a private sector loan of \n$152.2 million plus a political risk guarantee for a high-efficiency combined-cycle gas-fired power \nplant.13 ADB\u2019s timely and targeted assistance added value by addressing the most urgent needs, \nincluding policy and institutional development, capacity building, and investment. Lessons learned \nfrom previous assistance confirm that aligning project design with government plans, close \ncooperation with the MOEE in project execution, and hands-on capacity building would make ADB \nassistance relevant and effective. \n \n11.  ADB has adopted a conflict sensitive approach to ensure that ADB assistance (i) will not \nexacerbate ongoing conflicts, (ii) contributes to Myanmar\u2019s inclusive development, ensuring \nequitable benefit to all communities, and (iii) will not be disrupted by local conflicts. To achieve \nthis, ADB project design includes measures to ensure that project affected people are properly \ninformed about the project, involved in project decision making, particularly with respect to \ncompensation for adverse impacts, and have equal opportunity to participate in, and obtain project \nbenefits. Such measures include a stakeholder communication strategy and implementation plan, \narticulated in the project administration manual (PAM),14 resettlement and ethnic development \nplans, and proper implementation and monitoring of these plans.15 The conflict sensitive approach \ndesigned for the project will be applied specifically for the three conflict affected states: Kayin, \nMon, and Rakhine, where the project will build distribution facilities to support rural electrification \nin these areas (para. 14). The Summary of Project Activities in Conflict-Affected Areas contains \nfurther information on these subprojects.16   \n \n12.  Development  coordination.  ADB,  JICA,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  development \npartners closely coordinate their assistance for the power sector in Myanmar, through active \nparticipation in the Sector Coordination Group, chaired by the MOEE union minister. Guided by \nthe Myanmar Development Assistance Policy,17 Sector Coordination Group meetings discuss and \nprioritize areas for assistance, review implementation challenges, and propose actions to ensure \nefficient use of international assistance for the sector.18 As a result, ADB focuses its assistance \non strengthening the 230 kV transmission system and the 66 kV, 33 kV, and 11 kV distribution \n                                                \n12 ADB technical assistance and grants covered (i) capacity building and institution support; (ii) policy, strategy, master \nplan, legal, and regulatory framework development; (iii) off-grid renewable energy demonstration; (iv) investment \nproject feasibility study; (v) financial management assessment of the energy sector; (vi) country safeguard system \nstrengthening; and (vii) public\u2013private partnership framework development. \n13 ADB. 2013.

ADB, JICA, \nand the World Bank co-lead the group, which includes other development partners from France, Germany, Italy, \nNorway, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \n \n ", "4 \nsystems; JICA will finance the 500 kV backbone and the rehabilitation of the Yangon distribution \nsystem; and the World Bank will support on-grid and off-grid rural electrification and tariff reform.19 \n \n13.  Project  focus.  The  Yangon  region  is  the  center  of  business  and  socioeconomic \ndevelopment, accounting for 50% of the country\u2019s electricity consumption. Yangon\u2019s transmission \nsystem consists mainly of low voltage facilities, which need upgrading to a high voltage system. \nThe ongoing ADB-financed Power Transmission Improvement Project is upgrading the Thida\u2013\nThaketa\u2013Kyaikasan section from 66 kV to 230 kV.20 This proposed project will upgrade the \nAhlone\u2013Thida section. Upon project completion, the Yangon power system will have a complete \n230 kV transmission ring, which will increase transmission capacity and reliability and reduce \ntransmission losses. Separately, the government is determined to connect Tanintharyi\u2014the \ncountry\u2019s southernmost region and the only region without a transmission system\u2014to the national \ntransmission network. The proposed Mawlamyine\u2013Ye\u2013Dawei 230 kV transmission line is the first \nstep toward realizing this vision. \n \n14.  In parallel with developing the transmission network, the government needs to expand \ndistribution systems to achieve universal electrification by 2030. The proposed strengthening and \nexpansion of distribution systems in the Ayeyarwady and Bago regions and in Kayin, Mon, and \nRakhine states directly contribute to achieving this target. These regions and states have poverty \nrates higher than the national average and electrification rates below the 35% national average. \nCurrently, poverty rates are 45% in Ayeyarwady, 30% in Bago, 41% in Kayin, 53% in Mon, and \n78% in Rakhine21 and electrification rates are 14% in Ayeyarwady, 31% in Bago, 16% in Kayin, \n38% in Mon, and 13% in Rakhine (footnote 6). The project is expected to enable the government \nto electrify an additional 330,000 households in more than 2,000 villages, doubling the average \nelectrification rate in the project areas from 28% to 56% by 2026. Additionally, 1,400 schools, \nclinics, hospitals, and libraries will gain access to grid electricity. The project will install, for the \nfirst time, a computerized transmission asset management system and a computerized customer \nbilling  system\u2014the first  step toward  digitizing power  system  management  in  Myanmar\u2014to \nimprove operational efficiency, effectively manage assets, and reduce nontechnical losses. The \nproject will build distribution subprojects in the conflict affected areas, namely in Kayin, Mon, and \nRakhine states, where the ADB conflict sensitive approach (para. 11) will be implemented \n(footnote 16).  \n \n15.  The project, prepared in response to the government\u2019s request, is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 (Table 1).22 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Contribution \n1.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  Technical due diligence has ensured that the project design meets international technical \nstandards  and  has  provided  sufficient  data  and  specifications  for  preparing  draft  bidding \ndocuments. The DPTSC will use computerized systems to enhance assets management and help \nimprove its operational efficiency. Similarly, the computerized billing system will help the ESE \nimprove its revenue collection. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Economic  analysis.  The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  assessment  followed  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects27 by comparing societal costs and benefits of \nthe with-project scenario with the without-project scenario. The project will significantly increase \nelectricity transmission and distribution capacity, reduce losses, and enhance the security and \nreliability of the supply in seven central and southern regions and states of Myanmar. \n \n27.  The project\u2019s quantifiable benefits include increased electricity supply with higher reliability \nfor the Yangon region (3,097 gigawatt-hours [GWh]) by 2034, provision of 962 GWh of grid \nelectricity to the Tanintharyi region by 2030 (currently the region uses diesel-based electricity), \nand electrification of 330,000 households and 1,400 public buildings (schools, clinics, village \noffices) in selected ESE distribution areas in five regions and states. By 2030, the ESE\u2019s electricity \nsupply will increase by 1,981 GWh and its distribution losses will drop 2 percentage points from \n13% in 2016. The replacement of diesel and other fuels with grid electricity and the distribution \nloss reduction resulting from the project will reduce about 13.5 million tons of carbon dioxide over \n25 years. The economic internal rate of return for the project is 17.7%. A sensitivity analysis \nconfirms the project\u2019s economic viability regarding important project variables.28 \n \n28.  Financial analysis. The financial evaluation of the distribution component of the project \nfollowed ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.29 The analysis \nexamined the financial viability of the proposed reinforcement and expansion of the distribution \nnetwork owned and operated by the ESE. The transmission component will be implemented by \nthe DPTSC, a nonrevenue-generating entity. As such, the transmission component was excluded \nfrom the financial analysis. \n \n29.  The ESE\u2019s profitability has declined in FY2015 and FY2016 because of (i) the inadequate \ntariff margin (the difference between the buying and selling prices) set by the government; and (ii) \nthe separation of electricity distribution in Mandalay to a stand-alone entity in FY2016, resulting \nin the loss of a high-value customer base. As the ESE gears up its capital investment program to \nexpand and reinforce its network, the government needs to increase the tariff margin to allow the \nESE to generate enough cash to meet its expenditure and debt service obligations. Otherwise, \nthe government would have to continue its budgetary support, which is not sustainable. \n \n30.  The analysis was performed by comparing the future incremental benefits accrued from \nadditional electricity sales and the incremental costs to the ESE in real terms, discounted to their \npresent value. The post-tax financial net present value of the incremental cash flows discounted \n                                                \n27 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

Manila. \n \n ", "8 \nat the weighted average cost of capital is $54.7 million. The post-tax real financial internal rate of \nreturn of the project is 2.8%, which is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 0.2%.30 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  The  financial  management  and  sustainability  risk  is  high  mainly  because  of  three \nweaknesses: (i) the DPTSC\u2019s dependence on the MOEE\u2019s budget allocation for its operation and \ninvestment; (ii) the ESE\u2019s dependence on the tariff margin, for which a transparent mechanism \nfor review and adjustment is still being developed; and (iii) weaknesses in internal financial \nmanagement and reporting. To help mitigate these risks, the project proposes regular reviews \nand adjustments of electricity tariffs to recover costs and strengthening of the technical and \nfinancial performance of the ESE and the DPTSC. The long-term solution will be transformation \nof the DPTSC and ESE into independent transmission and distribution companies, which is being \nsupported through the Sector Coordination Group. \n \n32.  The government regulates electricity tariffs, which (depending on consumption level) \nrange from MK35 to MK50 per kWh for residential consumers and MK75 to MK150 per kWh for \nindustrial and commercial consumers. Such low tariffs necessitate government subsidies for the \nDPTSC and the ESE. The government is conducting an analytical study to devise a tariff \nadjustment mechanism that allows tariffs to reflect electricity supply costs. The last retail tariff \nincrease in 2015 led to a weighted average increase of about 40% over 2014 tariffs. Going \nforward, the government is implementing rules and regulations under the Electricity Law (2014) \nso that electricity tariffs will promote the efficiency and economy of the power industry, while also \nmeeting the government\u2019s poverty reduction objective through a lifeline tariff.31 \n \n33.  The government is committed to promoting good governance and addressing corruption. \nThe Anticorruption Law currently in use was promulgated in July 2013. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained to and discussed with the government \nand the MOEE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe PAM (footnote 14). ADB has organized and will continue organizing training for MOEE, \nDPTSC, and ESE staff covering ADB guidelines and procedures for procurement, disbursement, \nreporting, monitoring (by ADB staff and the project implementation consultants), and prevention \nof fraud and corruption (by ADB staff). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The project helps achieve the target of 100% household electrification by 2030. The \nproject beneficiaries are households, businesses, and public institutions in the regions and states \nof Ayeyarwady, Bago, Kayin, Mon, Rakhine, Tanintharyi, and Yangon. Under the distribution \ncomponent, 330,000 households and 1,400 public buildings (schools, clinics, and hospitals) will \nbe newly electrified, doubling the average electrification ratio of the concerned states and regions \nfrom the 28% to 56%. Consumers in the Tanintharyi and Yangon regions will benefit from \nelectricity  made  available  from  greater  transmission  capacity.  The  availability  of  electricity \nimproves health outcomes, increases employment and income opportunities, and improves living \nconditions for women and children. The application of the ADB conflict sensitive approach \nthroughout project implementation will ensure that project affected peoples can participate in \nproject  design,  and  will  have  equal  opportunities  to  be  connected,  with fair  and  equitable \n                                                \n30 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 A lifeline tariff is a targeted subsidy based on household consumption levels. The tariff for the first block of \nconsumption\u2014equal to the basic needs of the poor\u2014is provided at a subsidized rate, while the tariff for subsequent \nblocks are cost-reflective. \n ", "9 \ndistribution of project benefits, without any bias or preferential treatment for any group over \nanother (para. 11).   \n \n35.  Although the project is classified no gender elements, it will give women job opportunities, \nparticularly during the construction of the distribution component. The influx of male workers at \nfuture construction sites may lead to higher risk of sexually transmitted diseases. To mitigate this \nimpact, construction contracts will include prevention and health and safety measures. In addition, \nthe environmental management plan (EMP) includes a code of conduct for workers. The PICs will \nconduct training sessions and information campaigns for the PIUs, local communities, and \nworkers on gender issues, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy describes the project\u2019s social aspects.32 \n \n36.  MOEE prepared a stakeholder communication strategy (SCS) in consultation with the \nADB. The SCS supports two-way and effective communication and information sharing with \nproject  beneficiaries,  project-affected  people,  and  other  concerned  stakeholders  (including \nwomen  and  vulnerable  groups)  throughout  the  project,  thus  facilitating  understanding  and \nacceptance of the project. The SCS includes the actions and responsibilities of the PIUs and the \nPMUs in implementing activities under the SCS. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n37.  Based on technical due diligence and feasibility design, the implementing agencies have \nprepared project safeguard documents following government laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).33 These include (i) an initial environmental examination \n(IEE),34 and (ii) a resettlement and ethnic group development plan (REGDP) for each project \ncomponent (footnote 15). In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are described in paras. 38\u201345. \n \n38.  Environment (category B). The IEEs identified the project\u2019s potential environmental \nimpacts and proposed measures to mitigate them through the EMPs. The implementing agencies \nprepared the EMPs in consultation with the affected communities and stakeholders, following \ngovernment laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The IEEs found that \nthe project does not cause significant adverse environmental impacts as the rights-of-way of \ntransmission lines and substation locations avoid environmentally sensitive areas. The potential \nenvironmental impacts are primarily noise and dust from construction and risks to occupational \nand community health and safety, which can be mitigated and managed. Expected impacts are \nsite-specific, and the EMPs have incorporated appropriate mitigation measures. \n \n39.  The EMPs are part of the bidding documents. Before awarding contracts, the DPTSC and \nthe ESE will reassess the potential impacts on the environmental receptors and will make sure \nthat appropriate mitigation measures are in place. No construction work will be allowed before \nADB approves the updated IEEs, and EMPs. The IEEs, and EMPs specify a grievance redress \nmechanism and monitoring requirements. \n \n40.  Involuntary resettlement (category B) and indigenous peoples (category C). The \nproject involves (i) permanent land acquisition for substations and tower footings of transmission \nand distribution lines and (ii) temporary impacts during the construction of the project facilities. \n                                                \n32 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 The implementing agencies held 21 stakeholder consultations involving more than 1,000 participants. \n34 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nThe  permanent  and  temporary  impacts  will  affect  714  households  under  the  transmission \ncomponent and 20 households under the distribution component. \n \n41.  The project will permanently acquire 38 hectares of land for the distribution component \nand 1 hectare for the transmission component, which will be used for the substations and tower \nfootings. This will have a severe impact on 18 households (totaling 91 people): 9 households will \nlose their primary residential structures under the transmission component; another 9 will lose \nmore than 10% of their total landholdings or income under the distribution component. Both \ncomponents also involve temporary impacts on crops and rubber plantations. Crops will be \nremoved from the line corridor during construction and height limitations on trees within the line \ncorridor will be enforced. In addition, 445 shops along the transmission line alignment will be \ndisturbed during construction. The temporary impacts are expected to be minimal because of the \nwide use of road easements, the short construction period, and construction during the dry season \nwhen most of the farmland lies fallow. \n \n42.  The project has identified 117 vulnerable households, comprising 65 households headed \nby women, 43 very poor households, and 9 households that have people with disabilities. In \naddition to compensation per the entitlement, the project will facilitate their participation in \nlivelihood  development  activities  in  the  project  areas  to  improve  their  income  generation \nopportunities. These measures will restore the income and standard of living of the vulnerable \nhouseholds and no further income restoration program is needed. \n \n43.  All affected households are entitled to compensation at full replacement cost for their lost \nassets,  incomes,  and  businesses. The  REGDPs  specify  the  implementation  arrangements, \nmonitoring requirements, and grievance redress mechanisms. The compensation budget is \nincluded in the project costs to be financed by the MOEE. The implementing agencies will update \nthe REGDPs based on detailed engineering design and have them approved by ADB before any \nphysical or economic displacement takes place. \n \n44.  Three states\u2014Kayin, Mon, and Rakhine\u2014have ethnic groups living in the project areas. \nThe project will not acquire lands that are traditionally used by the ethnic groups nor cause any \nadverse impacts on the identity, society, culture, and areas of spiritual importance or interfere with \ntheir sociocultural beliefs and livelihood systems. Ethnic group communities will benefit equally \nfrom  the  project  through  job  opportunities  and  household  electrification.  The  implementing \nagencies have properly consulted the ethnic groups and will address their concerns during \nREGDP implementation. \n \n45.  The MOEE will recruit PICs with international and national safeguards specialists (for the \nenvironment  and  social  safeguards)  to  assist  the  PMUs  and  the  PIUs  in  updating  and \nimplementing the EMPs and REGDPs. The PICs will also train the PMUs and the PIUs on \nenvironmental management and on EMP and REGDP implementation. The project implementation \ncosts incorporate the estimated budget for the implementation of the safeguard mitigation plans. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n46.  The major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n \n                                                \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nInstability in Rakhine state  Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and conflict-sensitive \nmay prevent compliance with  approach, the Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MOEE) and the government \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s  have agreed to the following specific assurances and conditions in the loan \n(ADB) conflict-sensitive  agreement: the state and regional governments, the MOEE, and the Electricity \napproach, including project  Supply Enterprise (ESE), at all levels, will make sure that (i) all households and \nconsultations with all  communities in the subproject areas will have equal opportunities to connect to \nstakeholders and equitable  electricity grid; (ii) ADB has access to the project areas and can conduct \ndistribution of project benefits.  consultations about the project with all stakeholders and communities \nthroughout the project implementation period.  \nThe government\u2019s multilayer  ADB and development partners are working with the government to streamline \napproval requirements may  approval procedures.
