I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Tonga for the Tonga\u2013Fiji Submarine Cable Project.1 \n \n2.  Under the proposed project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank \nwill support the development and operation of a submarine fiber optic communication cable \nsystem linking Tonga to Fiji where an existing international submarine cable network will provide \nonward cost-effective access to the rest of the world.2 Separately, the World Bank and the \nGovernment of Australia, through the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility (PRIF), will also \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to improve the regulatory framework and develop the capacity \nof the regulator.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Tonga is one of the more isolated countries in the Pacific region, with a small population \nof 102,0003 spread across 48 inhabited islands out of 171 islands.4 About 70% of the population \nis in Tongatapu where the capital city of Nuku\u2019alofa is located. Main economic activities include \nfishery, agriculture, and tourism. Tonga\u2019s small size and distance from large markets do not \nallow the people to exploit economies of scale. A narrow resource base and small market have \nresulted in a highly undiversified economy. Before the recent financial crisis, remittances from \nabout 100,000 Tongans overseas account for an estimated 30% of the gross domestic product \n(GDP). As the global economic slowdown affected the principal remittance-sending countries \n(Australia, New Zealand, and the United States), remittances fell by 10.2% in FY2010, following \na decline of 13.6% in FY2009.5 Lack of economic opportunity within the country resulted in \nmigration from rural to urban areas, and overseas.  \n \n4.  Tonga\u2019s isolation and other constraints to economic development may be mitigated in \npart by improved access to and more affordable telecommunications, especially high-speed \n(broadband)  internet,  which  offers  new  economic  opportunities  domestically,  as  well  as \nconnections  to  larger  markets,  and  new  avenues  for  delivery  of  services,  nationally  and \ninternationally.  A  recent  World  Bank  study  indicates  that  a  10%  increase  in  broadband \npenetration results in a 1.38% increase in GDP growth in low and middle income countries.6 \nSuch impacts result from (i) reduced transaction costs for business, government, and household \ncommunications;  (ii)  new  business  opportunities  such  as  investments  in  e-commerce  and \nbusiness process outsourcing facilities; and (iii) improved public service delivery, in particular to \nsupport e-education and e-health services. Affordable high speed internet services will help \nTongans maintain social cohesion with their relatives residing abroad and improve disaster risk \nmanagement. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory TA, complementing preparatory activities by the World Bank and the Tonga \nCable Limited (ADB. 2010.

Extending  Reach  and  Increasing  Impact:  Information  &  Communication  Technology  for \nDevelopment. Washington DC. ", "2 \n5.  Tonga was the first country in the Pacific to liberalize its telecommunications sector. \nSince  2002,  access  to  basic  telecommunications  has  increased  significantly.  Mobile  tele-\ndensity,7 at about 60%, is among the highest in the region; and local and international call tariffs \nare among the lowest in the Pacific. Internet penetration, however, remains low with about \n2,500 subscribed  broadband  internet  users.  This  is  because  of  the  high  cost  and  limited \navailability  of  international  bandwidth,  resulting  in  congestion.  Internet  service  is  open  for \ncompetition and five internet service providers (ISPs) have been licensed. However, because of \nthe  high  cost  of  satellite  infrastructure  and  capacity  leases,  only  two  telecommunications \noperators are operational ISPs.   \n \n6.  The limited capacity and high cost of international bandwidth is the principal constraint to \nhigher  internet  penetration,  the  introduction  of  new  telecommunications  services,  and  new \nmarket entrants. This is due to Tonga\u2019s total dependence on satellite connectivity. The current \nmarket price for two-way satellite capacity is about $3,600 per megabit per second (Mbps) per \nmonth.  With  normal  growth,  Tonga\u2019s  bandwidth  demand  is  projected  to  increase  to \n1.243 gigabits per second (Gbps) by 2032.8 With the current satellite capacity and price, it would \nbe impossible to meet the growing demand.  \n \n7.  The government and telecommunications industry in Tonga have considered several \noptions to improve access and reduce the international connectivity cost. The preferred option is \nto invest in a new submarine fiber optic cable linking to the Southern Cross Cable Network \n(SCCN) in Fiji. This will provide substantially higher initial capacity of 10 Gbps and reduce \ninternational connectivity costs by more than 60%. Currently, the cheapest broadband internet is \naround $60 per month, which is about 28% of monthly income approximated with GDP per \ncapita in 2010. The submarine cable system will stimulate increased take-up of broadband \ninternet by reducing the price rapidly. \n \n8.  In addition to the positive socioeconomic impact in Tonga, the submarine cable system \nwill  contribute  to  regional  integration.  It  will  increase  the  frequency  and  quality  of \ncommunications among the countries in the region, thus increasing trade in services (tourism \nand back-office functions) and allowing the region to form a sizable market for digital products \nand services. It will also strengthen the existing regional public goods and encourage new ones \nby allowing countries to share the limited knowledge and human resources available in the \nPacific. \n \n9.  Despite the submarine cable\u2019s perceived benefits, investment in submarine cable in the \nPacific has been limited. The requirement of a large upfront capital investment, a long period of \nreturn on investment, and commercial risks from rapid changes in technology and business \nenvironment has led to a market failure. A meager private sector in Tonga cannot mobilize a \nlarge investment for a cable. The cable\u2019s long-term public benefits far exceed private sector \ninvestment return, and therefore, the government considers it as a public investment priority. \n \n10.  The project responds to the Pacific Islands Forum leaders\u2019 call for improved international \nconnectivity for the islands member countries.9 ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2010\u20142014 stresses \nconnectivity  through  improved  information  and  communication  technology  as  a  driver  of \nchange.10 It  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  in  Tonga  by  contributing  to \n                                                \n7  The number of subscribers per 100 inhabitants. \n8  World Bank. 2010.

Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the project will be that widely available and affordable information and \ncommunication technology services improve Tonga\u2019s economic performance and public service \ndelivery.  The  outcome  is  that  the  population  of  Tonga  will  have  access  to  good  quality \nbroadband internet services at a lower price.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  Output  1  of  the  project  is  the  establishment  and  efficient  operation  of  the  Tonga \nsubmarine cable system by Tonga Cable Limited (TCL), a company established in late 2009 to \ndevelop  submarine  cable  options  for  Tonga.  The  submarine  cable  system  will  comprise \ninstallation of an 827-kilometer cable link between Nuku\u2019alofa (Tonga) and Suva (Fiji) and \nconstruction of a landing station in Tonga. In Fiji, the cable will use an existing landing station \nwhere the Tonga cable is connected to the SCCN for data traffic to Australia, the United States, \nand the rest of the world. TCL will procure, own, and operate the cable; and it will be sole \nwholesaler of the cable capacity to the retail service providers. Output 1 will be jointly financed \nby ADB and the World Bank.  \n  \n13.  Output 2 will ensure efficient and effective project management services by TCL. This \noutput will mainly be financed by TCL, with some parallel financing from the World Bank.  \n \n14.  Since  TCL  will  be  a  sole  wholesaler  with  dominant  market  power  for  international \nconnectivity, it needs to be regulated to maintain cost-based pricing and open and fair access to \nall retail service providers, thus maximizing market competition. In parallel to the project, the \nWorld  Bank  will  provide  TA  to  support  the  regulator,  the  Ministry  of  Information  and \nCommunications (MIC), to improve telecommunications policy and the legal and regulatory \nenvironment for internet access and e-transactions. The TA will also support MIC\u2019s capacity \ndevelopment. It will be financed by the World Bank and the Government of Australia through \nPRIF. The regulatory and capacity development of the MIC is critical to achieve the outcome \nenvisaged from the ADB-financed outputs. Close collaboration between ADB and the World \nBank will be maintained during the development of the regulatory framework and the capacity \ndevelopment of MIC through joint review of both agencies on the terms of reference, inputs, \nreports and recommendations of the consultants. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $32.8 million. The investment plan is summarized in \nTable 1. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).12  \n \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2007.

The  government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $9.7  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources to help finance the submarine cable system development.13 The government has also \nrequested grant finance from the World Bank of $16.5 million in joint financing to support the \nsubmarine cable system. Tonga is at high risk of debt distress and cannot afford to take on \nmore borrowing as its public debt is projected to reach 58.5% of gross domestic product in \nFY2011.14 Therefore, grant financing has been sought. TCL will provide counterpart financing \nequivalent to $6.6 million to fund (i) construction of a landing station, including the land lease; (ii) \nenvironmental management and legal expenses; (iii) consulting services for cable construction \nsupervision; (iv) taxes and duties; and (v) recurrent costs during construction.  \n \n17.  The government will make the proceeds of the grants from the cofinanciers available to \nTCL, against the issuance of shares in the capital of TCL, under a share purchase agreement \non terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. The share purchase agreement will require TCL to \nfinance the submarine cable system from the proceeds of the grants. The share purchase \nagreement will value shares in TCL at the nominal amount contributed by the government and \nTCL\u2019s current sole shareholder, Tonga Communications Corporation (TCC).

The Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP) will be the executing agency \nresponsible for overall administration of the project. TCL will be the implementing agency and \nwill handle all procurement and financial management for outputs 1 and 2. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM.   \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2011\u2013June 2016 \nEstimated project completion  30 June 2016 \ndate \nEstimated grant closing date  31 December 2016 \nManagement \n(i)   Project steering  Chaired by deputy prime minister; consists of ministers of MFNP, \ncommittee a  MPE, and MTEYS and chief secretary and secretary to cabinet  \n(ii)  Executing agency  MFNP \n(iii)  Implementing agencies  TCL  \n(iv)  Project management unit  8\u20139 persons under TCL are proposed  \nProcurement  Limited  international  1 contract    $26,200,000 b \nbidding \nNational procurement  1 contract c        $3,957,000 \nConsulting services  National procurement  3 contracts d    $1,000,000 \nRetroactive financing and/or  TCL requested advanced procurement action for the submarine \nadvance contracting  cable system up to bid evaluation.

A submarine cable system is an integrated system of plant, materials, equipment, civil \nworks,  and  services.  For  technical  reasons,  considerations  of  economy  and  efficiency, \nmanagement risks, and in view of the limited number of suppliers, the submarine cable system \nis best procured as a single contract. The contract will be jointly financed by ADB and the World \nBank. ADB and the World Bank have agreed to a memorandum of understanding to capture \ndetailed collaboration and coordination arrangements in relation to this procurement, and the \nproject  more  generally.  The  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n20.  To  enable  joint  financing  of  the  cable  system  contract  package,  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors\u2019  waiver  of member country  procurement  eligibility  restrictions  is  sought to  permit \nparticipation of bidders from non-ADB member countries and/or procurement of goods and \nservices from non-ADB member countries. The World Bank and the Government of Tonga \nacknowledge that ADB cannot finance the submarine cable system contract under the currently \n ", "6 \nproposed arrangements if the Board of Directors does not approve the project or grant the \nnecessary waiver. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n21.  The project is expected to benefit the population of Tonga, as the submarine cable \nsystem and improved regulations will lead to low cost and high quality broadband internet \nservice. It will contribute to the economy\u2019s efficiency and bring new business opportunities that \ncan leverage Tonga\u2019s well-educated young population and diaspora in developed countries. It \nwill also enable the government to provide better education and health services. Due diligence \nwas  based  on  detailed  technical,  regulatory,  environmental,  and  social  assessments,  and \nconsultations with the stakeholders in Tonga. \n \nA.  Technical  \n22.  For the submarine cable system, a technical assessment included the alternative cable \nroutes and different technical options, cable landing station selection, and legal and regulatory \nissues  involved  in  the  cable  system  development  and  operation.  Alternative  cable  routes \nexamined  are summarized  in  Table  4.  Considering  the  lifespan, capacity,  and  capital  and \noperational expenses, a new cable to Fiji has been selected as the most feasible and least-cost \noption. Several cable landing sites in Tonga were examined, and a site in Sopu area was \nselected based on its proximity to the shore, availability of land, and minimum disruption to the \nmarine environment and human activities. The landing station building and auxiliary facilities will \nbe designed and built to adapt to cyclones and the rising sea level.   \n \nTable 4: Different Route Options for Tonga Submarine Cable \nBackhaul \n          cost \nPoint of    Capex  Opex  Lifetime  Capacity  ($/Mbps/ \nConnection  Type of Cable  ($ million)  ($\u2019000)  (years)  (Gbps)  month) \nSamoa   New cable  42  1,100    10a  1   600  \nNew Zealand   Secondhand cable  20   1,750   10  1   100  \nNew Zealand   New cable  62   1,750  25  10 to 320  100  \nFiji  New cable  29   900    14\u201325b  10 to 320  200  \nCapex = capital expenditure, Gbps = gigabits per second,  Mbps = megabits per second,  Opex = operating \nexpenditure. \na Samoa has a submarine cable link to American Samoa, which is linked to Hawaii with a recovered (secondhand)    \ncable. The lifespan of secondhand cables is about 10 years.  \nb Minimum 14 years, as the Southern Cross Cable Network\u2019s original lifespan is until 2025. However, as the Southern \nCross Cable Network has been continuously upgraded, it can be operational for well beyond 2025. \nSource:  World  Bank.  2010.

At Suva, the cable will land on the existing cable station of SCCN, managed by the Fiji \nInternational Telecommunications Limited (FINTEL). TCL will have a landing party agreement \nwith FINTEL for collocation services and interconnection with SCCN. As per the landing party \nagreement, FINTEL will facilitate the necessary permits and authorization from the relevant Fiji \nauthorities, i.e., agencies responsible for communication, land, marine affairs, environment, and \nindigenous people\u2019s issues. The Fiji Ministry of Finance and Department of Communications \nhave indicated their support for the project. At Nuku\u2019alofa, TCL will obtain all permits. Once the \ndetailed cable route is confirmed by a marine survey, the government will declare the cable \npassing area as a special management area under the Fisheries Management Act to avoid any \ndisrupting fishing practices like trawling. The government will also adopt any other legislation or \n ", "7 \nregulations  required  to  ensure  adequate  protection  of  the  submarine  cable  system  in  its \nterritorial water.  \n  \nB.  Financial and Economic  \n24.  A financial analysis of the submarine cable system confirmed its financial viability, as its \nfinancial internal rate of return (13.63%) far exceeded the weighted average cost of capital \n(0.02%). A sensitivity analysis shows that the financial return is more sensitive to demand \ndecrease. Therefore, it is essential to encourage demand growth by lowering consumer price \nthrough competition among retail service providers. A cash flow projection was prepared based \non the revenue projection and the proposed share purchase agreement, and it shows that TCL \ncan achieve a positive net cash flow from 2013. This confirms that TCL\u2019s operation become \nsustainable during the lifespan of the submarine cable.   \n \n25.  The submarine cable system and improved regulatory environment will allow faster and \ncheaper communications services, especially broadband internet, and exert a positive social \nand economic impact through cost savings, efficiency gains, and better public services, among \nothers. However, such an impact is difficult to quantify. The economic analysis included only \nquantifiable benefits of the project: (i) incremental benefits, including revenue from the sales of \ncable capacity and consumer surplus from the additional internet subscribers caused by the \nlower internet price; and (ii) savings from replacing satellite capacity with the submarine cable \nfor international bandwidth, and savings by existing internet subscribers as a result of the lower \ninternet price. The economic internal rate of return is 17.3%, which exceeds 12%, the economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital.  A  sensitivity  analysis  concluded  that  the  project  will  remain \neconomically viable unless TCL revenue falls by 40%.15      \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  Analyses  included  existing  and  proposed  legislation,  regulations,  and  institutional \nstructures for sector planning and management. Tonga has a good overall framework for sector \nmanagement\u2014the  Communications  Act  2000\u2014which  covers  important  issues  including \nconsumer protection, tariff management, fixed licensing terms with opportunities for renewal, \nuniversal-service policy, anticompetitive policies, and arbitration. However, it lacks the detailed \nregulations and procedures to guide the regulator and the industry in an increasingly complex \nsector  environment.  For  example,  there  are  no  detailed  procedures  or  transparency \nrequirements for licensing. Established on 1 May 2009, the MIC is responsible for the overall \nregulatory management of the sector, but it lacks technical and human resource capacity to \nfulfill its mandate.  \n \n27.  The  government,  the  World  Bank,  and  PRIF  have  agreed  on  a  TA  for  capacity \ndevelopment and regulatory reform activities. These will include legal and regulatory reforms \nnecessary  to  incorporate  into  national  law  (i)  Tonga\u2019s  specific  commitments  regarding \ntelecommunications to the World Trade Organization; and (ii) international best practices in the \nfield  of  (a) telecommunications  regulation,  with  a  view  to  creating  an  enabling \ntelecommunications and information and communication technology environment; and (b) cyber \nlegislation. The World Bank and PRIF funded TA will also support the government to develop a \nroad map and policy framework to address any remaining medium- and longer-term regulatory \nneeds, such as the possible establishment of an independent regulatory institution for the \ntelecommunications sector.  \n                                                \n15  Financial and Economic Analyses (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n28.  As the regulatory reform and capacity development will take time, the government will \nensure TCL\u2019s operational requirements are well defined within a license. It will be a wholesale \nlicense, and its terms and conditions will require TCL to set cost-based pricing and provide fair \nand open access to the cable capacity for any interested retail service providers. Once issued, \nthe license information will be publicly available through MIC and TCL websites.    \n \n29.  In November 2009, TCL was established as a limited liability company following the \nCompanies Act (Amendment) 2009. It became a wholly owned subsidiary of TCC, a state-\nowned enterprise, with the intention to offer 20% of TCL\u2019s share capital to private investors after \nthe cable system becomes operational. On the one hand, TCC\u2019s involvement and financial \ncontribution to the project so far has been crucial because there is limited technical capacity \nwithin the country for large-scale telecommunication infrastructure development. On the other \nhand, TCL is a wholesale business and will sell capacity to all retail service providers including \nTCC.  TCC\u2019s  dominant  ownership  of  TCL  could  undermine  TCL\u2019s  ability  to  operate \nindependently.  \n \n30.  In March 2011, the government therefore decided to turn TCL into a separate public \nenterprise,  and  developed  a  transition  plan  for  the  board  composition  and  management \narrangement. To do so, the government will make available to TCL the grants from ADB and the \nWorld Bank against the issuance of shares in the capital of TCL pursuant to the proposed share \npurchase agreement. TCL will use the grants to procure the submarine cable system. As a \nresult,  the  government  will  own  approximately  80%  of  TCL\u2019s  shares  while  TCC  will  own \napproximately 20%.16 After the cable system starts generating revenue, but before the project \nimplementation period ends, the government intends to sell 20% of its shares in TCL to private \nsector investors. During the cable system installation period, two TCC board members will also \nserve  on  TCL\u2019s  board.  The  interim  managing  director,  who  also  serves  as  TCC  board \nchairperson,  will  remain.  At the  end  of  the  installation  period, TCL  will  submit  for  cabinet \napproval its application to become a public enterprise in accordance with the Public Enterprises \nAct  2002,  as  amended.  Pursuant  to  this  Act,  a  new  board  will  be  appointed  and  a  new \nmanagement will be recruited under a competitive and transparent process.  \n \n31.  A governance risk assessment has been completed in accordance with the Second \nGovernance and Anticorruption Action Plan.17 Separate financial and procurement assessments \nby the World Bank concluded that the overall risk of the project is medium, but it can be \nmitigated to low through capacity development of TCL in procurement, close monitoring of the \nprocurement  process  by  ADB  and  the World Bank,  direct  payment  to  the  contractor,  and \nquarterly financial statement reviews. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with MFNP and TCL. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  Absolute or extreme poverty is rare in Tonga. Poverty and hardship mainly means lack \nof opportunity for cash income and access to quality education and health services. In addition \nto the efforts to encourage private sector business activities, technical and vocational education \nand training is a priority for the government to prepare its young population to be a more \n                                                \n16 The share purchase agreement will value the shares in TCL at nominal value, which means that the actual ratio of \nshareholding will be adjusted once the actual value of the cable system contract (and, therefore, the government \ncontribution) is known. \n17 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAPII). Manila. http://www.adb.org/Docu \nments/Policies/Governance/GACAP-II.pdf. \n ", "9 \nproductive workforce. Internet penetration is about 20%, with the highest rate in Nuku\u2019alofa \n(32%). Rural areas of Tongatapu and other islands have penetration of 18%. Across all island \ngroups, female users (55%) outnumbered male users. Lowering the cost of internet service can \ncreate new job opportunities, enhance education and health services, and increase available \nknowledge for the economy.  A competitive market structure has brought an increase in internet \npenetration in the rural areas of Tongatapu and other islands, and lower cost international \nconnectivity through the submarine cable will accelerate the service expansion. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  Environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples impacts were assessed \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Proposed cable laying and minor \ncivil works will not result in any significant adverse environmental impact, and all potential \nenvironmental impacts can be adequately mitigated and monitored. An initial environmental \nexamination,  incorporating  an  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan,  has  been \nprepared  for  each  stage  of  the  project.18 The  government  and  World  Bank  assessment \nprocedures are compatible with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. The project \nhas  incorporated  additional  strengthening  of  TCL\u2019s  capacity  to  monitor  compliance  of  the \nenvironmental management plan. The project is categorized environmental category B. \n \n34.  The project does not involve any land acquisition, and no indigenous people issues have \nbeen identified. Potential impacts on fishing and oyster aquaculture will be avoided while laying \nthe cable. In case any project activity unavoidably involves such impacts during implementation, \nthe  project  will  follow  the  resettlement  framework  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement and World Bank\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.19 The project is categorized \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples category C. The safeguard documents have \nbeen endorsed by the government and posted on TCL and ADB websites.    \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.

The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand grant documents.  \n \n37.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the grant agreement and project agreement. Effectiveness of the ADB grant and \nproject agreements is conditional upon (i) effectiveness of Tonga\u2019s grant agreements with World \nBank and PRIF; (ii) a share purchase agreement among TCL, the government, and TCC, upon \nterms and conditions satisfactory to ADB; (iii) the issuance and publication of an individual \nlicense  for  TCL  for  wholesale  broadband  network  services,  upon  terms  and  conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB; (iv) landing arrangements for the Sopu landing station and the Suva landing \nstation, satisfactory to ADB; (v) certification that all licenses required for the project have been \nobtained; and (vi) legal opinions in relation to the first two conditions.   \n \nV.
