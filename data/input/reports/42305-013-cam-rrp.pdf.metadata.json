The \nreport  describes  proposed  Implementing  subprogram  2  of  the  Third  Financial  Sector  Program \ntechnical  assistance  (TA),  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1\n \n \n2. \nThe development framework for Cambodia\u2019s finance sector is based on a 10-year rolling \nfinance  sector  development  strategy  (FSDS)  of  the  government.  The  10-year  strategy  was \nrecently  updated    as  the  FSDS,  2011\u20132020.2\n   It  is  aligned  with  Cambodia\u2019s  updated  National \nStrategy  and  Development  Plan,  2009\u20132013  and  Rectangular  Strategy,  as  well  as  with  the \ncountry  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Cambodia,  2011\u20132013.  It  has \nincorporated  the  recommendations  of  the  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program,  2010  of  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  and  the  World  Bank.  Bilateral  meetings  were  held  with  key \nstakeholders and were followed by several workshops with government agencies. Development \npartner  coordination  was  further  strengthened  during  the  update  of  the  FSDS.  ADB  meets \nregularly  with  all  development  partners  in  the  finance  sector  to  discuss  current  issues  and \ncoordinate activities. This informal group of development partners periodically discusses finance \nissues  with  relevant  business  associations  and  Cambodia\u2019s  Private  Sector  Forum.  As  per  the \nGovernment  of  Cambodia\u2019s  request,  the  proposed  third  program  is  a  cluster  of  three \nsubprograms to implement the first phase of the FSDS, 2011\u20132020. These reforms have been \ndiscussed  with  all  relevant  government  agencies,  industry  associations,  and  development \npartners. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nA  robust  finance  sector  is  essential  for  sustainable  economic  growth.  Cambodia\u2019s  real \ngross domestic product (GDP) grew strongly at 9.1% per year on average from 1998 to 2008. \nThis slowed in 2009 and 2010 because of indirect effects of the recent global economic crisis. \nThe authorities nevertheless aim to pursue economic reform that will return the economy to pre-\ncrisis growth rates. The period of robust economic performance was led by the private sector, in \nparticular  garments,  tourist-related  services,  construction,  and  agriculture.  A  substantial \nproportion  of  these  activities  were  financed  by  foreign  direct  investment  and  the  domestic \nfinance  system.  With  a  rapidly  growing  commercial  economy  that  requires  a  sound  finance \nsystem  to  sustain  growth,  the  government  is  committed  to  the  long-term  development  of  the \nfinance  sector,  channeling  financial  resources  to  productive  investments,  and  managing  the \ninherent  risks  to  achieve  sustainable  economic  growth  over  the  long  term  and  contribute  to \npoverty  reduction.  To  promote  sustainable  economic  growth,  reduce  poverty,  and  mitigate \nshocks  emanating  from  external  financial  crises,  ADB  supports  finance  sector  development  in \nits developing member countries, including Cambodia. Since 2001, ADB has become the lead \ndevelopment partner supporting Cambodia\u2019s finance sector. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory TA: ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing \n\nthe Third Financial Sector Program Cluster. Manila ( TA 7520-CAM). \n\n\fADB and the government began in 1999 their partnership to develop Cambodia\u2019s then-\n4. \nnascent finance  sector. External  assistance  was  sorely  needed  both to  lay  the groundwork for \nfinance sector development and to rebuild capacity largely decimated during the conflict years. \nFully  cognizant of  the  pivotal  role the  sector  would  play  in  achieving  economic transformation, \nand faced with a rapidly growing commercial economy potentially undermined by scarce capital, \nthe  government  embarked  on  a  long-term  development  strategy  and  plan  for  developing  the \ncountry\u2019s  finance  sector.  As  a  first  step,  and  with  ADB  assistance,  the  government \ncommissioned  the  preparation  of  the  FSDS,  2001\u20132010,  which  was  to  guide  finance  sector \ndevelopment  during  that  period.  To  help  implement  the  first  phase  of  the  FSDS,  2001\u20132010, \nADB approved the $30 million first Financial Sector Program in November 2001.3\n Implemented \nfrom  2001  to  2007,  the  first  program  enabled  the  government  to  begin  establishing  legal  and \nregulatory  foundations,  consolidate  the  banking  system,  establish  key  regulatory  agencies, \nprivatize  state-owned  banks  and  finance  institutions,  and  commence  the  licensing  of  informal \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs). \n \n5. \nThe FSDS, 2001\u20132010 was updated by the FSDS, 2006\u20132015 to take into account new \nchallenges,  both  domestic  and  international,  as  well  as  market  developments.  The  FSDS, \n2006\u20132015  noted  encouraging  progress  in  sector  development.  Encouraging  achievements \nunder  the  first  program  prompted  the  government  to  request  further  support  from  ADB  to \ncontinue its reform of the finance sector, and ADB approved the $45.3 million Second Financial \nSector  Program  Cluster  in  December  2007. 4\n Implemented  from  2007  to  2010,  the  second \nprogram completed reforms that helped boost confidence in the formal finance sector, advanced \nthe  legal  and  regulatory  foundation,  strengthened  the  capacity  of  regulatory  agencies,  and \nintroduced part of the supporting infrastructure for financial activities. While Cambodia still has \none of the lowest rates of financial intermediation in the world, it has improved since 2001 with \nthe money supply growing from 13% of GDP in 2001 to 21% in 2006 and 40% in 2010. \n \n6. \nAs  of  the  end  of  June  2011,  the  formal  finance  sector  comprises  the  National  Bank  of \ninstitutions,  and  2 \nCambodia  (NBC),  29  commercial  banks,  6  specialized \nrepresentative  offices  of  foreign  based  banks;  26  licensed  MFIs  and  29  registered  MFIs;  7 \ninsurance  companies,  1 insurance  broker,  and  2  insurance  agents;  and  the  Securities  and \nExchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) with 7 securities underwriters, 2 securities dealers, \n4 securities brokers, 2 investment advisers, and 3 cash settlement agents. On 11 July 2011, the \ngovernment  launched  the  Cambodian  Securities  Exchange,  jointly  owned  by  the  Ministry  of \nEconomy and Finance (MEF) with 55% and the Korea Exchange with 45%, but trading has yet \nto commence. As in most developing countries, the banking system in Cambodia dominates the \nfinance sector. Banking activities are not fully developed but are improving in rural areas, with \nMFIs providing most formal financial services. Microfinance is expanding rapidly, with total credit \nincreasing  from  $35.0  million  in  2001  to  $514.4  million  in  June  2011  and  the  number  of \nborrowers increasing from 410,000 to 1.08 million over the same period. The Financial Industry \nDepartment in the MEF regulates and supervises the insurance subsector, which comprises six \ninsurance companies and one re-insurer, the latter majority owned by the government. Growth \nhas been steady with the premium total reaching $24.9 million in 2010, nearly seven times the \n$3.6 million in 2001. \n \n\nfinancial \n\n                                                \n3 ADB.  2001.

Sector  Challenges.  Challenges  to  further  developing  the  finance  sector  include  low \nfinancial  intermediation  due  to  the  rural  and  informal  nature  of  the  economy,  vulnerability  to \nexternal  shocks  due  to  a  narrow  economic  base  that  is  heavily  dependent  on  international \nmarkets, governance issues as accounting and auditing practices are being further developed, \nand  inefficiencies due to a financial infrastructure that is not fully developed and corresponding \ntechnical  capacity  that  is  weak  and  needs  to  be  further  developed  in  line  with  the  human \ncapacity requirements of the sector. The third program will continue to address these challenges \nas outlined in the Outputs Section (paras 12-25 below). \n\n9. \nLessons. In moving to implement the FSDS, 2011\u20132020, past lessons clearly illustrate \nthe  following:  (i)  A  set  of  long-term  objectives  is  required  to  guide  and  shape  medium-term \npolicy design and implementation. (ii) Flexibility in design is important to accommodate changes \nin  economic,  social,  and  political  circumstances.  (iii)  The  time  lag  between  the  adoption  of \nreforms  and  their  effective  enforcement  needs  to  be  shortened.  (iv)  Substantial  TA  resources \nare  required  to  build  technical  capacity.  (v)  Maintaining  monetary  and  financial  stability  are \ncrucial to economic growth. (vi) Promoting good governance, under which financial growth and \ndevelopment is to be pursued, would anchor the FSDS. (vii) Enhancing the sector\u2019s operational \nefficiency  would  facilitate  FSDS  implementation.  The  design  of  the  third  program  has \nincorporated these lessons. \n \nRebuilding  Cambodia\u2019s  finance  sector.  This  is  a  protracted  process.  While  positive \n10. \nprogress  has  been  achieved,  a  large  part  of  the  country  remains  untapped  by  formal  finance, \nas, at the end of 2010, less than 10% of the population had access to credit through the formal \nsector.  The  government  recognizes  that  attaining  inclusive  economic  growth  requires  a \ndiversified,  competitive,  and  prudentially  sound  financial  system  to  ensure  that  financial \nresources are efficiently accumulated and effectively allocated. To implement the FSDS, 2011\u2013\n2020, the government requested ADB\u2019s further support for its finance sector reforms under the \nthird  program.  To  maintain  monetary  and  financial  stability,  the  third  program  will  actively \npromote the use of the local currency (the riel), update the core legal framework for banking and \nfinance,  enact  additional  commercial  laws,  and  strengthen  coordination  among  finance  sector \nregulators. Support will be extended toward developing the recently launched securities market \nand operationalizing the money and interbank markets. Capacity building will continue in order \nto meet the increased demand for qualified staff for the growing number of financial institutions \nand their branch networks, as well as to enable existing regulators to shift from compliance- to \nrisk-based  supervision.  Upgrading  supporting  infrastructure,  which  includes  accounting  and \n\n                                                \n5  Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Summary  of  Achievements  under  the  first  Financial  Sector  Program  and  the  Second  Financial  Sector  Program \n\nCluster (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fauditing, anti-money laundering measures, and a payments system, is a long-term initiative that \nwill continue under the third program (additional details are in section II C). \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  expected impact of the third program is a sound, market-based finance sector able \nto  enhance  resource  mobilization  and  support  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  expected \noutcome  is  a  growing,  resilient,  and  efficient  financial  system. The  third  program  comprises  a \nseries  of  three  single-tranche  subprograms  to  be  implemented  from  December  2010  to \nDecember  2013.  Subprogram  1  has  20  reform  actions,  which  the  government  implemented \nbetween December 2010 and October 2011. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThird program policy measures include a set of sector reforms to improve the legal and \nregulatory  framework  and  its  application,  strengthen  institutional  coordination  among  national \nregulatory agencies, promote confidence and growth in outreach, strengthen the application of \nsupporting  infrastructure  and  international  standards,  develop  new  markets,  and  support \ncapacity  development  more  sustainably.  The  program  has  four  outputs:  (i)  finance  sector \nstability maintained, (ii) confidence and financial intermediation improved, (iii) good governance \npromoted,  and  (iv)  finance  sector  efficiency  enhanced.  Key  activities  for  each  output  are \ndescribed below. \n \n\n1. \n\nFinance Sector Stability Maintained \n\n13. \nLegal and regulatory framework for banks and microfinance institutions. As part of \nefforts  to  maintain  financial  stability,  address  the  features  of  a  fast-changing  domestic  market, \nand align it with the reality of closer international economic integration, the NBC is committed to \nupdating the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the NBC, 1996 and the Law on Banking \nand  Financial  Institutions,  1999.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  NBC  organized  workshops  in \ncoordination  with  the  MEF,  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC),  SECC,  and  stakeholders  to  identify \nwhich  existing  laws  have  overlapping  or  conflicting  provisions.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  NBC \nwill update these two laws in consultation with the MEF, MOC, and SECC and incorporate the \nrecommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program, 2010. \n \n14. \nBank  supervision  capacity  and  financial  stability.  As  part  of  efforts  to  strengthen \nprudential supervision under subprogram 1, the NBC has developed a framework for assessing \nfinance  sector  risks  and  issued  supervisory  guidelines  to  banks,  adopted  a  road  map  toward \nimproving  compliance  with  core  Basel  principles  for  effective  bank  supervision,  and  reinforced \ncoordination  between  the  NBC\u2019s  Supervision  Department  and  the  Cambodian  Financial \nIntelligence Unit (CAFIU) to enforce reporting by banks. Subprogram 2 will support (i) the NBC\u2019s \nefforts  to  strengthen  cooperation  among  local  finance  sector  regulators  and  with  supervision \nauthorities in countries that have subsidiary banks licensed in Cambodia, (ii) its requirement that \nbanks  involved  in  nonbank  activities  provide  consolidated  financial  statements,  and  (iii)  its \nimplementation  of  key  actions  toward  full  compliance  with  core  Basel  principles  for  effective \nbank supervision. \n \n15. \nPrudential supervision and regulations for microfinance institutions. The NBC has \nmade  significant  progress  in  building  the  regulatory  framework  for  licensing  and  supervising \nregistered MFIs. To improve financial reporting by MFIs, the NBC recently required them to pilot \ntest a microfinance information system that electronically transmits MFIs\u2019 financial reports to the \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fStrong  legal  foundation  to  support  financial  and  commercial  transactions.             \n\nNBC. Under subprogram 1, the NBC fully implemented the microfinance information system and \nensured that all licensed MFIs complied with reporting requirements, to enhance the quality of \noff-site  supervision  reports.  During  subprogram  2,  the  NBC  will  continue  to  develop  on-site \nsupervision methodologies for effectively supervising microfinance. \n \n16. \nA comprehensive legal framework for commerce and finance must be developed, updated, and \nimplemented  to  support  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  and  commercial  activities.  Under  subprogram  1, \nthe  MEF,  MOC,  Ministry  of  Justice,  and  NBC  jointly  reviewed  potential  conflicts  or  overlaps \nbetween  existing  laws  and  agreed  on  necessary  revisions.  Further,  the  MOC  reviewed  the \nutilization of the on-line secured transactions registry. Under subprogram 2, the MEF will submit \nthe draft financial trust law to the Council of Ministers, and the new insurance law to the National \nAssembly. Further, the MOC will obtain guidance from the Council of Ministers on the approach \nfor setting up commercial courts and organize workshops to help increase the utilization of the \nonline secured transactions registry. Activities toward the adoption and implementation of these \nlaws will continue under subprogram 3. \n \n\n2. \n\nConfidence and Financial Intermediation Improved \n\nConsumer  access  to  credit,  customer  protection,  and  market  confidence.            \n\n17.  Modern  payments,  clearance,  and  settlement  system.  Modernizing  the  payments, \nclearance,  and  settlement  system  will  continue.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  NBC  held \ncomprehensive  consultations  toward  preparing  a  draft  law  on  the  national  payments  system, \nwhich  has  been  reviewed  by  its  management.  Further,  to  ensure  that  the  settlement  and \ntransfer of securities are carried out simultaneously, the SECC has accredited three commercial \nbanks as cash settlement agents for securities transactions. During subprogram 2, the NBC will \nsubmit  the  draft  law  on  the  national  payments  system  to the  Council  of Ministers; commission \nthe \u201cfull solution\u201d phase of the national payments, clearance, and settlement system to facilitate \nthe  timely  clearance  and  settlement  of  checks  nationwide;  and  procure  the  shared  switch  for \nelectronic payments and settlement. Further, the MOC will update the draft e-commerce law in \nclose consultation with NBC. \n \n18. \nThe orderly development and growth of the finance sector to provide wider, more affordable and \nefficient  consumer  access  requires  knowledgeable  customers  and  reliable  information  from \nproviders  of  financial  services.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  NBC  issued  regulations  covering  the \noperations  of  the  credit  bureau  of  Cambodia  to  enhance  banks\u2019  and  MFIs\u2019  compliance  with \nreporting  requirements.  During  subprogram  2,  the  NBC  will  assist  the  incorporation  and \nregistration of the privately owned credit bureau. Further, the NBC will, in coordination with the \nCambodian  Microfinance  Association,  organize  a  study  of  over-indebtedness  and  disseminate \nthe results to stakeholders. \n \n19. \nmoney  markets  to  facilitate  the  short-term  liquidity  needs  of  commercial  banks  will  continue.       \nIn the absence of traded government securities, the NBC has launched negotiable certificates of \ninterbank  borrowing.  Under \ndeposit,  which  will  be  used  as  collateral \nsubprogram 1,  the  NBC  encouraged  the  operation  of  the  interbank  market  using  negotiable \ncertificates of deposit.  During subprogram 2, the MEF will develop capacity, consider the timing \nfor issuance of Treasury bills in riel based on a predetermined borrowing program, and establish \na  system  for  accrediting  primary  market  dealers  of  government  securities,  in  cooperation  with \nthe NBC. \n \n\nInterbank and government securities markets. The development of the interbank and \n\nfor  short-term \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fDomestic  securities  market.  The  development  of  primary  and  secondary  markets for \n20. \nequity  securities  will  help  domestic  corporations  to  access  funds  directly  from  investors.          \nThe  legal  framework  for  developing  a  securities  market  was  established  during  the  second \nprogram. Under subprogram 1, the SECC approved the listing rules and established the support \ninfrastructure for a securities market, registered and officially launched the Cambodia Securities \nExchange, designed educational materials, and undertook a campaign to educate investors and \nbuild  public  awareness  across  the  country.  During  subprogram  2,  the  SECC  will  draft  a  sub-\ndecree  on  bankruptcy  matters  related  to  the  securities  market;  conduct  self-assessment  to \nconfirm  that  securities  market  operations  conform  with  International  Organization  of  Securities \nCommission  core  principles;  examine  the  licensing  and  accreditation  of  all  securities  market \nparticipants, including fit and proper tests; establish a customer complaints center in the SECC; \nand develop and implement a capacity-building plan for its staff. \n \n\n3. \n\nGood Governance Promoted \n\n21. \nInternational initiatives on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of \nterrorism. The second program commenced activities to implement anti-money laundering and \ncombating  the  financing  of  terrorism  (AML/CFT)  in  Cambodia,  to  support  international \ndeterrence  efforts  and  standard  governance  principles  and  build  market  confidence.  Under \nsubprogram  1,  the  CAFIU  addressed  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force  40+9  recommendations \nfollowing the Mutual Evaluation Report of 2011 and strengthened cooperation with the financial \nintelligence  units  of  neighboring  countries  and  related  international  organizations.  During \nsubprogram  2,  the  CAFIU  will  assess  the  risk  facing  NBC-supervised  institutions  and  other \nmarket institutions regarding AML/CFT, in coordination with the SECC; develop a national risk-\nassessment  framework  and  strategic  implementation  plan;  and  conduct  workshops  to  raise \nawareness of AML/CFT among casinos, nonprofit organizations, and realtors. \n \n22. \nCorporate  governance  and  transparency  in  the  finance  sector.  To build consumer \nconfidence  in  the  sector,  formal  finance  institutions  have  to  be  more  transparent  in  how  they \nconduct business and consistently implement good governance practices. Under subprogram 1, \nthe SECC developed a framework for implementing a code of corporate governance practices \nfor  listed  companies.  During  subprogram  2,  the  NBC  will  require  banks  and  MFIs  to  disclose \nloan  terms  and  conditions  according  to  a  uniform  framework  that  will  help  inform  and  protect \nclients,  as  well  as  develop  a  program  to  align  accounting  and  prudential  standards  with \ninternational financial reporting standards. Further, the SECC will implement a code of corporate \ngovernance practices for listed companies. \n \n23. \nCommercial  dispute  resolution  mechanism.  Work  toward  establishing  a  national \narbitration  center  commenced  during  the  second  program.  In  2011,  two  sets  of  qualifying \nexaminations were held in March and August for the 54 selected arbitrators who, upon passing \nthe  examinations,  will  be  registered  as  qualified  arbitrators.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  MOC \narranged for the registration of qualified arbitrators and organized the first meeting of members. \nDuring subprogram 2, the MOC will arrange the election of the first board of directors to run the \nnational arbitration center and officially establish and help operationalize the national arbitration \ncenter. \n \n24. \nDevelopment of the accounting and auditing profession.  To strengthen and expand \naccounting  and  auditing  capacity,  the  MEF  introduced,  during  the  second  program,  a \ngovernment-funded  scholarship  to  enable  70 recipients  annually to  study  toward  becoming \nmembers  of  the  Kampuchea  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants  and  Auditors.  Although \nresults have improved since the first 3 years, some challenges remained for the MEF to attend \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fto,  including the formulation  of  course materials  covering  Cambodian  taxation  laws,  instead of \nUnited  Kingdom  laws.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  MEF  provided  35  certified  public  accountants \nand  35  certified  accounting  technician  scholarships.  Selection  was  on  merit,  and  the  MEF  will \ncontinue  to financially  support scholarship  holders.  During  subprogram  2,  the  MEF  will  update \nthe  Accounting  and  Auditing  Law  to  reflect  international  developments  and  submit  it  to  the \nCouncil  of  Ministers. The  MEF  will  continue  providing financial  support  to  the train-the-trainers \nproject,  as  these  trainers  will  implement  a  standardized  curriculum  at  10  selected  universities \nbased on international financial reporting standards. \n \n\n4. \n\nFinance Sector Efficiency Enhanced \n\n25. \nUpdated and modernized business registration system. The MOC corporate registry \nneeds  to  be  reevaluated  and  expanded  to  improve  the  national  database  of  corporate  entities \nand make corporate information more accessible to investors, lenders, and the general public. \nUnder subprogram 1, the MOC reviewed current systems to ensure all commercial enterprises \nare  registered  and  will  identify  areas  for  improvement.  During  subprogram  2,  the  MOC  will \nconsolidate  the  systems  of  company  registration  and  company  data  storage  for  regulatory \npurposes and to improve public access to this information. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n26. \nA  total  of  $45  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources  has  been \nprogrammed  for  the  third  program,  which  will  comprise  three  subprograms.  The  size  of  the \nbudget  support  program  is  based  on  development  financing  needs  for  the  sector  as  identified \nduring country programming and strategy formulation, the importance the government attaches \nto the reform program, and the estimated costs of designing and implementing the medium-term \nreform  program  minus  estimated  financial  support  provided  by  other  development  partners. 7 \nEach  successive  subprogram  will  be  processed  following  the  successful  completion  of  the \nsubprogram  preceding  it.  The  subprogram  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon \nsatisfactory  completion  of  all  subprogram  triggers  and  following  loan  effectiveness.  The \nproceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.8\n \n \n27. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  $15  million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  1  of  the  third  program.  The \nloan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Loan proceeds will be used to finance the full \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries.9\n ADB  will \nretain  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  withdrawal \napplication certification. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  NBC  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  the  MEF,  MOC,  and  SECC  will  be  the \n28. \nimplementing  agencies  for  the  third  program.  The  finance  sector  steering  committee  and  the \nTWG, as updated under regulation 393 of 21 June 2011, will oversee the implementation of the \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2011.

The TWG will \nreport to the steering committee, chaired by the governor of the NBC, and will propose concrete \nactions  to  resolve  any  issues  that  arise.  A  senior  officer  of  the  NBC  has  been  appointed  as \nprogram  director for  the third  program  and  will  assist  ADB  in  coordinating  day-to-day  program \nimplementation  with  the  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  SECC,  and  other  relevant  agencies.  The  program \ndirector  will  be  required  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  and  an  annual  report  on  the \nprogress  of  subprogram  implementation  and,  in  particular,  on  progress  in  implementing  policy \nactions adopted for the third program. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n29. \nIn response to the government\u2019s request, ADB has prepared TA to support MEF, MOC, \nNBC, and SECC implementation of key policy triggers of subprogram 2, as well as provide the \ngovernment  with  timely  policy  advice  on  demand.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.25  million \nequivalent,  of  which  ADB  will  provide  $1.1  million  as  a  grant  ($0.8  million  from  the  Technical \nAssistance  Special  Fund  and  $0.3  million  from  the  Cooperation  Fund  for  Regional  Trade  and \nFinancial  Security  Initiative),  and  the  MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  and  SECC  will  provide  the  remaining \n$0.15  million  equivalent  in  the  form  of  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  support \nfacilities.10\n A total of 46 person-months of consulting inputs are required, 38 international and 8 \nnational.  Experience  in  Cambodia  has  shown  firms  to  be  more  expensive  than  individual \nconsultants  and  unsuccessful  in  recruiting  the  right  mix  of  consultants,  especially  when  the \nproject requires a diverse mix of expertise. The diverse nature of expertise required, with each \nindividual  consultant  reporting  to  a  designated  implementing  agency  to  deliver  specific  and \nindependent  outputs,  calls  for  recruiting  individual  consultants.  ADB  will  engage  individual \nconsultants  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended \nfrom time to time), using competitive selection. The NBC will be the executing agency of the TA, \nand the MEF, MOC, and SECC will be the implementing agencies. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n30. \nThe third program will generate economic gains through the successful implementation \nof  medium-term  policy  actions.  The  estimated  benefits  of  the  program  far  exceed  the  loan \namount. ADB estimates the potential annual economic benefits of the cluster program  at $125 \nmillion, or 1.0% of GDP, highlighting the importance of finance sector reforms to the economy.11\n \nThe estimated costs of policy implementation to the government, statutory agencies, banks, and \nfinancial institutions are conservatively estimated at $59.0 million (compared with $45.0 million \nequivalent  for  the  third  program,  of  which  $15.0  million  is  for  subprogram  1).  These  include \ninvestment,  administrative,  enforcement,  and \ntoward \nimplementing  and  enforcing  the  reforms,  estimated  at  a  minimum  of  $31.5  million.  The \nestimated  policy  implementation  costs  include  investment,  administrative,  and  increased \nbusiness  costs  borne  by  banks  and  financial  institutions  in  complying  with  the  reforms, \nestimated at a minimum of $27.5 million. \n\nthe  government \n\nfiscal  costs \n\nto \n\n                                                \n10  Implementing Subprogram 2 of the Third Financial Sector Program Technical Assistance (accessible from the list    \n     of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n31. \nThe country\u2019s public financial management systems were assessed to better understand \nfiduciary  risks  and  determine  appropriate  fiduciary  arrangements  for  the  third  program.  The \ngovernment  continues  to  emphasize  strengthening  the  public  financial  management  system, \ninternal  control  systems,  and  the  functions  of  the  National  Audit  Authority, 12  which  have \nmitigated the fiduciary risk of the public financial management system as a whole. 13\n Satisfactory \nprogress has been noted in fiscal revenue collection, with greater use of the banking system to \nstreamline revenue collection and payment processes. Subprogram 1 includes measures to (i) \nimprove  the  management  information  system  and  reporting  standards  within  the  NBC,  banks, \ninsurance  firms,  and  MFIs;  (ii)  promote  transparency  in  the  information  released  by  banks, \nMFIs,  insurance firms,  and  listed  companies;  (iii)  support  the  operation  of  the  credit  bureau  of \nCambodia; and (iv) strengthen the enforcement of AML/CFT regulations.  \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NBC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  the  government  will  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with \ninternal  procedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practices  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption, money laundering, or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to \nrefrain from engaging in such activities. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe third program is a general intervention to support sustainable economic growth and \n33. \nis  expected  to  reduce  poverty  indirectly. 14\n Further,  finance  sector  development  extends  the \nreach  of  affordable  formal  financial  services  for  the  poor  and  rural  microenterprises  and  so \ndirectly  reduces  poverty.  While  implementing  finance  sector  reforms  based  on  competitive \nmarket  principles  has  been  gender  neutral,  improvements  to  the  finance  sector  climate  have \nencouraged banks and microfinance institutions to open branches in rural areas and introduce \nproducts  and  services  that  are  more  accessible  to  women. The  NBC  reported  that  lending  by \nmicrofinance  institutions  to  women  increased  from  21%  of  loans  in  2002  to  76%  in  2006  and \n81% in June 2011. Females held 68% of deposits in June 2011, and 27% of employees in the \nMFI subsector were female. These results show that subprogram 1 has had gender benefits. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n34. \nAs  the  third  program  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  negatively  affect \nindigenous  people  or  the  environment,  it  is  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  impact  on \nindigenous people, and impact on the environment. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35. \nThe  third  program  assumes  continuing  political  stability  and  macroeconomic  recovery \nfrom the global economic downturn over the medium term.

With  the  design  safeguards,  the \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to far outweigh any costs. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n36. \nThe  government  and  the  NBC  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  third \nprogram  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  detail  in  the  loan  document.  In  addition,  the  government  has  given  the  following \nspecific  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  into  the  loan  agreement.  The  government  will      \n(i) implement the policy triggers in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms as described \nin the development policy letter (Appendix 3) and contained in the policy matrix (Appendix 4), as \nwell  as  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  reforms  beyond  the  subprogram  1  period;  (ii)  continue \nregular  and  timely  policy  dialogue  with  ADB  on  macroeconomic  policies  and  constraints;          \n(iii) keep ADB informed of policy discussions  with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that \nhave  implications  for  the  implementation  of  subprogram  1,  the  third  program,  and  the  post-\nprogram  partnership  framework;  and  (iv)  provide  ADB  with  opportunities  to  comment  on  any \npolicy proposals. The government will take ADB\u2019s views into consideration before finalizing and \nimplementing any such proposals. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \n37. \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n \n\nthe programmatic approach for the Third Financial Sector Program; and \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\nthe loan of SDR9,571,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 1 of the \nThird  Financial  Sector  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  Resources  with  an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 years; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n\n4 November 2011 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n                                                \n15  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nDesign Summary \nImpact \nA sound, market-oriented \nfinance sector to \nenhance the mobilization \nof financial resources \n\nOutcome \nA growing, resilient, and \nefficient financial system \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\n \nTotal private sector credit of \nbanks at 35% of GDP or \nabove by 2017, up from 29% \nin 2010 \n \nTotal bank deposits at 45% of \nGDP or above by 2017, up \nfrom 35% in 2010 \n \nAccess to credit for 15% or \nmore of the population by \n2017, of which at least 60% \nare women (9% of total \npopulation in 2010, of which \nwomen are 59%) \n \nIncreased of M2 to 45% of \nGDP or above by 2014, up \nfrom 38% in 2010 \n \n \n \n \nSolvency ratio of banks and \nMFIs maintained at above \n15% throughout the program \nperiod \n \nRatio of nonperforming loans \nto total loans of banks \nmaintained below 10% \n(3% in 2010) \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms  \n\n \nAnnual reports, including \naudited financial reports of \nbanks, insurance firms, and \nlicensed MFIs \n \nProgress reports from NBC \n \n \n \nKey financial data from NBC \n\n \n\n \nAssumptions and Risks  \nAssumptions \nContinuing political \nstability \n\nMacroeconomic recovery \nfrom global economic \nshock \n\n \nRisk \nSlow recovery from global \nfinancial and economic \nshocks \n\n \nNational accounts and \neconomic reports and official \nstatistics of the Government \nof Cambodia and other \ninternational development \nagencies \n \nPublished audited reports of \nbanks, MFIs, and insurance \nfirms \n\nAssumptions \nThe government remains \ncommitted to reforms and \nimplementing the FSDS, \n2011\u20132020. \n\nComplementary support \nfrom other development \npartners continues. \n\n \nRisk \nSystemic risks in the \nfinancial system are not \ncontained or managed in \na coordinated manner \n\nOutputs \n \n1.
