The Project has four basic components.  \n \nComponent 1 entails support for a government leadership role to \nestablish  public-private  partnerships  with  rural  development \nenclaves  focused  on  improving  and  extending  health  services  to \nthe  surrounding  communities.  Health  services  will \ninclude \nvoluntary  counseling  and  testing  (VCT),  treatment  and  care  (for \nsexually  transmitted  infections  and  HIV/AIDS)  as  well  as  the  full \nrange  of  primary  health  care  services.  Component  1  will  also \nsupport  the  rehabilitation  of  rural  health  infrastructure,  medical \nstaff training, and leadership development for HIV/AIDS advocacy.\n \nComponent  2  will  develop  local  civil  society  organizations\u2019 \ncompetency to work with affected communities to address issues \nrelated  to  the  epidemic,  leading  to  sustainable  behavior  change \nprograms.  The  Project  will  also  support  nationwide  social \nmarketing of condoms, which will be specifically structured to the \ncharacteristics of each region. \n \nComponent  3  involves  strengthening  and  expanding  the  sentinel \nsurveillance  system  covering  high-  and  low-risk  populations  and \nsettings.  The  surveillance  system  will  produce  regular  updates \nand ensure broad dissemination of information. In addition to the \nsero-surveillance,  the  system  will  also  include  behavioral  change \nsurveillance. \n \nComponent  4  entails  project  management,  including  project \nplanning, coordination with partners, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Strategy  2005\u20132010  (MTDS)  and  the  National \nStrategic  Plan  for  HIV/AIDS  2004\u20132008,  and  is  informed  by  the \nthe  Human  Development \nGovernment\u2019s  ongoing  work  on \nStrategy.

The  CCM  will  review  progress  and  guide  project \nimplementation,  ensuring  management  and  resource  efficiencies \nare achieved with the Global Fund. \n \nProject  implementation  will  be  performed  by  NDOH;  the  National \nAIDS  Council  Secretariat  (NACS);  provincial  and  district  health \noffices,  hospitals,  and  health  facilities;  the  National  Research \nInstitute, World Health Organization (WHO), Joint United Nations \nnongovernment \nProgramme \norganizations  (NGOs),  a  not-for-profit  social  marketing  company \nand a separate company for behavioral change, and participating \neconomic operators in rural development enclaves. \n \nAt \nfor \nInternational  Development  (AusAID),  and  New  Zealand  Agency \nfor  International  Development  (NZAID),  ADB  will  engage  the \nconsultants  and  administer  the  two  consultancy  contracts  under \ncomponent 2.  \n \nThe  economic  operators  will  provide  oversight  and  manage  the \npartnerships  with  the  public  health  facilities  in  their  communities \nand  provide  health  services \nthe \nsurrounding communities. NGOs, community-based organizations \n(CBOs),  and  faith-based  organizations  (FBOs)  will  be  trained  to \ndeliver  HIV  prevention  activities,  behavior  change  and \ncommunication, VCT, treatment, and care, including home-based \ncare. \n \nGrant-financed civil works, goods and materials will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nProject civil works are small and limited to the repair and upgrade \nof existing facilities. No land acquisition will be necessary. All civil \nworks will be awarded either through local competitive bidding or, \nwhere  circumstances  warrant,  through  the  direct  engagement  of \nthe  economic  operators \nthe  selected  rural  development \nenclaves. \n \nGoods or materials valued at $1 million or more will be procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding,  and  those  valued  at \nover  $100,000  and  under  $1  million  will  use  either  international \nshopping or local competitive bidding. \n\ntheir  employees  and \n\nto \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nConsulting Services \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nfollowing  positions: \n\ntrain,  supervise  and  monitor \n\nDirect  purchase/negotiation  or  single  tender  may  be  employed \nwhen buying small or off-the-shelf items valued at up to $100,000. \n \nAll condoms and related supplies for the social marketing program \nwill be procured by the contracted not-for-profit company. \n \nADB's  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  suitable  to  ADB  will  apply  in  the  selection  and \nengagement of the consultants.  \n \nTwo  international  companies/NGOs  will  be  engaged,  one  to \ndesign, \nthe  behavior  change \nprograms (to be carried out through local NGOs/CBOs/FBOs and \ncommunities),  and  the  other  to  design  the  plan  for  and  conduct \nthe  social  marketing  of  condoms.  In  both  cases,  ADB  will  take \nresponsibility  for  the  engagement  and  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection (QCBS) will be applied. \n \nIndividual  international  consultants  will  be  engaged  under  the \nProject  by  NDOH \n(i)  project \ncoordinator,  (ii)  HIV  sero-surveillance  specialist/epidemiologist, \n(iii)  behavioral  surveillance  specialist,  and  (iv)  procurement \nspecialist.  \n \nIndividual domestic consultants will also be engaged by NDOH for \nthe following positions: (i) project accountant, (ii) field supervisor, \n(iii)  trainer  supervisors  for  surveillance,  (iv)  statistician,  (v)  data \nentry clerks, and (vi) interviewers.  \n \nBenefits will include a decreased burden of HIV, improved overall \nhealth  status  of  people \nin  participating  rural  development \nenclaves,  and  expanded  primary  health  care  and  community-\nbased  activities  in  rural  areas.  Other  benefits  will  be  public  and \nprivate savings in health expenditures, including indirect costs as \na  result  of  reduced  morbidity  from  emerging  and  endemic \ndiseases,  and  productivity  gains \nimproved  education, \nespecially through less absenteeism and reduced dropout rates. \n \nThe  Project  is  pro-poor  in  its  focus  on  delivering  and  expanding \nprimary  health  care  services  in  rural  areas.  By  increasing  the \nmeans  for  reducing  the  risks  of  HIV  infection  among  the  highest \nrisk groups, the Project will increase the likelihood that low income \npeople  reduce  their  own  risks  to  infection.  Generally,  men, \nwomen,  and  children  will  benefit  equally  from  greater  access  to \nhealth care, but in some project areas women and children will be \nthe primary beneficiaries of more accessible health services. \n\nfrom \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nv\n\nSeveral  activities  of  the  Project  consist  of  community-level \ninterventions,  such  as  targeted  behavior  change  programming \nthrough  capacity  development  of  communities  and  local  civil \nsociety  organizations.  Women,  including  sex  workers,  will  be \nmajor beneficiaries of these community interventions. \n \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  maximize  the  potential  for \nsustainability given the limited time of the grant and the need for \ngreater  Government  commitment  to  the  HIV  response.  Each \nmemorandum  of  agreement  between  the  Government  and  a \nprivate sector operator will be structured to encourage sustainable \ncooperation  and  help  strengthen  the  commitment  of  each  party. \nthe \nThe  competencies  developed  by  NDOH  will  ensure \nestablishment  of  new  (post-project)  public-private  partnerships  in \nthe Government\u2019s continued comprehensive response to the HIV \nepidemic.  By  establishing  a  consortium  of  development  partners \nto  cofinance  and  support  an  independent,  professional  not-for-\nprofit company to establish and run the social marketing program, \nthis essential HIV prevention intervention becomes a collaborative \neffort  and  less  dependent  on  any  single  partner\u2019s  decision  to \ncontinue after 4 years or not. \n \nThe  Project  will  strive  to  work  within  and  strengthen  HSIP \nsystems,  but  an  alternative  mechanism  may  be  needed  if  the \nHSIP becomes dysfunctional.  \n \nPNG\u2019s health system over the past several years has experienced \na  diminishing  ability  to  provide  services,  especially  at  the \ncommunity  level,  because  of  insufficient  supplies,  inadequate \nsupervision,  and  large  numbers  of  nonperforming  health  staff \nmembers  on  payroll.  Extensive  reform  of  the  health  system  is \nneeded but unlikely to occur soon.  \n \nA  major  concern  is  the  Government\u2019s  absorptive  capacity  for  the \nlarge  influx  of  funds  from  the  Global  Fund,  ongoing  AusAID \nsupport, and the proposed ADB grant. The amount of funds to be \ndisbursed and the number of program and project activities under \nthe  health  sector  could  pose  significant  challenges  to  the \nGovernment  at  all \nlevels.  Extensive  consultations  and \ncoordination  have  been  undertaken  with  the  key  supporters  of \nHIV/AIDS  activities  in  PNG  to  ensure  synergies  and  working \npartnerships  and  to  avoid  duplication.  No  new  institutional \nstructures are required for the Project.  \n \nA  worsening  economic  situation  will  drive  more  women  into \ntransactional  sex  and  high-risk  behavior.  Risks  and  assumptions \nappear in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nMap \n\n \n\nvii\n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \ngrant to the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the HIV/AIDS Prevention and \nthe  proposed \nControl \nadministration  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  of  cofinancing  for  the  Project  to  be \nprovided equally on a grant basis by the governments of Australia and New Zealand. \n \n\nin  Rural  Development  Enclaves  Project  (the  Project);  and  (ii) \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\nAbout  47,000  people  in  PNG  were  infected  with  the  HIV  virus  as  of  mid-2004.1  A \n2. \ngeneralized HIV epidemic is under way, with prevalence rates among 15\u201349-year-olds at 3\u20134% \nin  Port  Moresby,  well  over  2%  in  other  urban  areas,  and  over  1%  in  rural  areas.  The  HIV \nepidemic  in  PNG  is  at  an  advanced  and  critical  stage:  infection  patterns,  such  as  15-30% \nannual increases in infection rates, are similar to those of the early stages of HIV spread in sub-\nSaharan  Africa.2  One  forecast  estimates  that  PNG\u2019s  workforce  could  be  reduced  by  34%  by \n2020.3 Containment of the epidemic requires an urgent and long-term response, and therefore \nthe Government of PNG has requested ADB for a grant to establish a project that will develop \npublic\u2013private  sector  partnerships  to  prevent  and  control  the  spread  of  the  disease  in  rural \nHIV/AIDS  \u201chotspots\u201d  around  the  country.  Many  of  these  hotspots  are  associated  with  local \ncenters  of  economic  activity  (also  known  as  \u201cdevelopment  enclaves\u201d),  such  as  mines, \nplantations, logging sites, fisheries, and ports, and therefore a comprehensive response to the \nthreat of HIV/AIDS must include the participation of the private sector. \n \nPNG\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy  2005\u20132010  (MTDS)  focuses  on  export-\n3. \ndriven growth supported by good governance, rural development, poverty reduction, and human \nresource  development.  The  sectors  identified  as  having  the  greatest  export  potential  include \nagriculture (cocoa, coffee, copra, oil palm, and spices), fisheries, forestry, manufacturing, mining \nand  other  nonrenewable  resources  (e.g.,  petroleum  and  other  fuels),  services,  and  tourism. \nMany of these economic sectors typically comprise discrete rural enclaves, which generate local \njobs  and  a  cash  economy,  in  stark  contrast  to  their  surroundings,  where  people  rely  on \nsubsistence farming. However, these enclaves also inadvertently foster the exchange of goods \nand cash for sex among the mostly impoverished peripheral populations. High-risk sex behavior \nis  associated  with  the  surrounding  populations  of  rural  enclave  development  sites  because  of \nincreasing  poverty,  and  the  areas  around  the  enclaves  are  becoming  HIV/AIDS  hotspots. \nTherefore, a comprehensive response to the threat of HIV/AIDS must include the participation of \nthe private sector. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 The 2004 National Consensus Workshop estimated that 25,000\u201369,000 people were infected with HIV in PNG, and \nthen used the median estimate of 47,000 as an official figure.

The  HIV  epidemic  threatens  the  country\u2019s  economic  and \nsocial  fabric.  The  National  Department  of  Health  (NDOH)  has  developed  a  policy  on  broad-\nbased  and  inclusive  partnerships  covering  public\u2013private  arrangements  with  economic \noperators,  civil  society  organizations,  and  development  partners  in  the  delivery  of  health  care \nservices.  NDOH  is  also  implementing  a  sector-wide  approach  (SWAp)  that  brings  together  all \nstakeholders  in  health  under  the  Government\u2019s  National  Health  Plan.  The  National  HIV/AIDS \nCouncil  (NAC)  has  prepared  the  comprehensive  National  Strategic  Plan  on  HIV/AIDS  2004-\n2008  (NSP).  At  the  core  of  the  HIV/AIDS  Prevention  and  Control  in  Rural  Development \nEnclaves  Project,  and  consistent  with  NDOH  and  NSP  priorities,  is  the  development  of \nfunctional  partnerships  between  public  and  private  sectors  and  development  partners,  each \nassuming responsibility for a role or task where a comparative advantage exists. 4 \n \n\n2. \n\nHIV/AIDS Statistics and Situation \n\n5. \nHIV  in  PNG  was  first  confirmed  in  six  cases  in  1987,  and  AIDS  was  reported  in  1988. \nSince the mid-1990s, the HIV epidemic has been growing rapidly. At the end of 2004, a national \nconsensus workshop reviewed all data. The final estimates of people 15\u201349 years old living with \nHIV  in  mid-2004  ranged  from  24,528  (low  scenario)  to  46,744  (medium  scenario)  to  68,966 \n(high scenario). The estimated prevalence was 0.9\u20132.5%, with a median of 1.7% among 15\u201349-\nyear-olds. Including people below and above that age range, the medium estimate of infected \npeople in mid-2004 was 80,000, with a prevalence of about 1.5% of the total population. \n \n6. \nThese estimates indicate that a generalized, sexually transmitted HIV epidemic is under \nway.  The  ratio  of  males  to  females  has  been  almost  equal  from  the  earliest  years  of  the \nepidemic, and recently rates have risen among younger women. The prevalence rates among \n15\u201349\u2013year-olds are at least 3-4% in Port Moresby, well over 2% in other urban areas, and over \n1% in rural areas. Because 83% of the population is rural, about 66% of those living with HIV \ncan be expected to be in the rural areas. \n \n7. \nEstimations  based  on  available  data  and  the  rapidly  rising  intake  of  AIDS  patients  at \nhospitals indicates that the situation is becoming dire. The true extent of the problem country-\nwide  is  difficult  to  gauge  as  surveillance  systems  are  poor,  not  designed  for  public  health \ninterventions,  and  do  not  include  at-risk  groups.  About  60%  of  all  cases  are  detected  in  Port \nMoresby, where most HIV testing takes place. It is likely that traditional high-risk groups, such \nas  sex  workers  and  their  main  clients,  and  men  who  have  sex  with  men  have  higher \nconcentrations  of  infections  than  most  other  social  groups.  Sexually  active  young  people  in \ngeneral and people working or living in and around development enclaves are particularly likely \nto have higher prevalence of HIV.  \n \nThus  far,  PNG\u2019s  overall  response  to  the  epidemic  has  been  fragmented  and \n8. \nuncoordinated.  A  review  of  the  execution  of  the  National  HIV/AIDS  Medium-Term  Plan  for \n1998\u20132002,  which  encompassed  a  broad-based  multisectoral  approach,  revealed  little \nprogress. A later attempt at developing a national strategic plan lacked prioritization and costing. \nThe  Global  Fund  to  Fight  AIDS,  Tuberculosis  and  Malaria  (the  Global  Fund)  plans  extensive \ntreatment  and  testing  but  little  in  the  way  of  evidence-based  prevention  programs.  A  new \n\n                                                 \n4   Technical assistance (TA) worth $175,000 was provided to develop the Project under TA 4583-PNG (ADB. 2005. \nTechnical  Assistance  to  Papua  New  Guinea  for  the  Preparation  of  HIV/AIDS  Prevention  and  Control  in  Rural \nDevelopment Enclaves Project. Manila). \n\n\fAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID) program is under development and \nis exploring new ways to address the problem.  \n \n9. \nIt  has  long  been  recognized  that  mines,  logging  camps,  fisheries  plant,  and  other \nenclaves of economic production have high potential risk factors for HIV. HIV data from mines, \nas at Porgera and Ok Tedi, show increasing levels of infection in the workforce and surrounding \ncommunities. Out of 920 persons tested at Porgera Hospital in 2004, 7.7% were infected with \nHIV, and figures for 2005 (not yet complete) are expected to be even higher. Some of the mines \nhave  begun  to  respond  but  much  more  work  is  required.  Particularly  in  the  surrounding \ncommunities, denial, fear, and the widespread stigma associated with HIV continue to hamper \nprevention efforts.  \n \nAll  industries  will  need  additional  technical  support  to  prevent  HIV/AIDS.  Logging \n10. \ncompanies,  shipping  and  trucking  companies,  maritime  industries,  and  others  collectively \nrepresent  a  crucial  axis  of  HIV  spread.  These  and  other  economic  enclaves,  therefore,  also \nrepresent  a  great  opportunity  for  preventive  interventions.  Although  home-based  care, \nantiretroviral  (ARV)  treatment,  and  treatment  for  opportunistic  infections  such  as  tuberculosis \n(TB) are also greatly needed, effective prevention is of paramount importance. \n \n\n3. \n\nHealth Sector Financing, including HIV/AIDS \n\n11. \nAn  important  factor  in  the  declining  capacity  of  provincial  and  district  governments  to \ndeliver  quality  health  services  has  been  the  successive  attempts  at  decentralization.  Real \nexpenditures on goods and services\u2014critical for quality health care\u2014decreased by almost 46% \nover  1997-2003.  Real  expenditures  on  recurrent  capital  items\u2014crucial  for  maintaining \nequipment  and  capital  stocks\u2014have  fallen  nearly  90%  to  almost  zero.  However,  real \nexpenditures  on  staffing  emoluments  have  increased  8%  in  real  terms.  By  contrast,  the  total \nresources available for the response to HIV/AIDS are high in 2005 (well in excess of $20 million; \nmore than $3.50 per capita). Less than 10% of this amount will come from the Government in \n2005, with an anticipated reduction in funding over the next 5 years. \n \n12. \nThe  total  2004  health  expenditure  of  K475.3  million,  not  including  that  for  HIV/AIDS, \nrepresented  11%  of  total  government  and  development  partner  expenditure  for  the  year.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  share  of  the  total  was  68.4%.  Total  health  sector  expenditure  not  including \nHIV/AIDS increased in nominal terms from K373.9 million in 2001 to K475.3 million in 2004, but \nin  real  terms  decreased  from  K373.9  million  in  2001  to  K339.2  million  in  2004.  In  real  terms, \nexpenditure declined from K69.8 per capita in 2001 to K58.6 in 2004. \n \n13. \nExpenditure to fight HIV/AIDS is evolving. In 2002, about 90% of the about K40 million \ntotal  expenditure  on  HIV/AIDS  came  from  AusAID.  The  participating  stakeholders  in  the \nprevention  and  control  of  HIV/AIDS  have  increased  substantially  in  the  past  year.  However, \nAusAID\u2019s  relative  weight  is  only  just  beginning  to  change.  One  of  the  new  major  additions  of \nfunding  for  HIV/AIDS  is  the  Global  Fund.  The  Agreement  for  HIV/AIDS,  which  was  signed \nbetween the Global Fund and the Government on 30 June 2005, had a start date of 1 August \n2005. The agreement provides for $8.49 million to be released to NDOH, the principal recipient, \nover  2  years  and  managed  through  the  Government\u2019s  Health  Sector  Improvement  Program \n(HSIP). \n \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\n4. \n\nDevelopment Partners and Assistance \n\nPNG  has  attracted  a  variety  of  development  partners  concerned  with  HIV/AIDS.5 \n14. \nResources available in 2005 for the fight against HIV, including the Global Fund, are about $22 \nmillion, with less than 10% from the Government. AusAID has been the major contributor to HIV \nprograms  in  PNG,  and  its  focus  has  been  the  financing  of  the  provincial  AIDS  committees, \ncondoms,  sexually  transmitted  disease  training,  voluntary  counseling  and  treatment  (VCT), \nsurveillance, and high-risk settings. The other major donors include the European Union (a peer \neducation  project  in  high-risk  settings),  the  British  High  Commission  (working  in  East  Sepik \ncommunities),  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  (working  with  sex \nworkers  and  men  who  have  sex  with  men  in  selected  locations),  and  recently,  the    People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. The United Nations (UN) agencies, collectively coordinated by Joint United \nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), have also contributed (see Appendix 2 on external \nassistance).  The  World  Bank  has  invested  in  analytic  work,  and  New  Zealand  Agency  for \nInternational Development (NZAID) has begun to consider program investment.  \n \nFew  international  NGOs  with  strong  professional  reputations  in  the  HIV/AIDS  sector \n15. \nhave  been  attracted  to  PNG.  Donors  usually  implement  their  projects  among  communities \nthrough civil society organizations, which, with the exception of a few faith-based ones, are few, \nsmall, and struggling. Building local capacity to carry out various types of programs will require \nlong-term,  resident  expertise;  the  transfer  of  knowledge  and  skills;  and  a  high  level  of \ninvestment.  Economic  operators  represent  an  untapped  organizational  unit  capable  of \nimplementing  HIV/AIDS  programs  with  assistance.  The  demand  from  most  of  these  economic \noperators for assistance is great. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems, Lessons Learned, and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems and Constraints \n\n16.  Weak  Governance.  Poor  governance  and  inadequate  public  sector  management  are \nconsidered  the  main  development  problems  in  PNG.6  Redressing  fiscal  discipline  is  the  most \ncritical  requirement,  but  there  is  little  evidence  of  commitment  to  reform.  These  problems  will \ncontinue  to  be  addressed  by  the  ongoing  ADB-supported  Financial  Management  Project  and \nPublic Service Program. \n \n17. \nHigh Levels of Associated Diseases. The prevalence of sexually transmitted infections \n(STIs) is high in males and females, urban and rural (Supplementary Appendix 3). TB is also on \nthe  rise.  Other  countries\u2019  experience  shows  clearly  that,  as  HIV  infections  increase,  so  do  TB \ninfections  and  deaths  caused  by  TB/HIV  co-infection.  Hospitals  in  PNG  are  already  reporting \nthat  the  number  of  new  TB  patients  is  increasing.  TB  is  now  the  main  cause  for  admission  in \nadult inpatient wards. National inpatient data for pulmonary TB from 1996 to 2000 showed a rise \nin  registration  of  21%  (from  3,916  cases  to  4,723)  and  in  mortality.  Therefore,  any  project  on \nHIV/AIDS must also deal with primary health care issues as well. \n \nGrowing  At-Risk  Groups.  The  loss  of  traditional  mechanisms  of  social  control,  in \n18. \ncombination with the development of a cash economy and urbanization, has had an enormous \nimpact  on  traditional  sexual  cultures.  Today  extramarital  sex  is  common  as  is  multi-partnered \npremarital  sex,  though  no  adequate  survey  research  has  measured  the  true  levels  of  risk \n\n                                                 \n5 See Appendix 2 for details on external assistance for HIV/AIDS in PNG. \n6 ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Papua New Guinea. Manila. \n\n\fbehaviors. Sex workers in urban areas and urban-like enclaves represent the most at-risk group \nin  the  country.  One  study  of  rural  and  peri-urban  women  revealed  that  55%  of  women  stated \nthey had at some time exchanged sex for money and/or goods, and 36% of men had paid for \nsex  with  cash.  The  clients  of  urban  sex  workers,  who,  in  one  study  of Lae  and  Port  Moresby, \nwere  most  frequently  businessmen,  foreigners,  police,  miners,  loggers,  and  security  men, \nshould  also  be  considered  at  high  risk.  In  addition  to  these  groups  of  men,  studies  mention \ngovernment workers, fishermen, sailors, and truckers.  \n \nStudies have shown that a large number of men (about 12% of rural or peri-urban men, \n19. \naccording  to  one  national  study)  at  times  have  sex  with  men,  with  no  implications  for  identity. \nSuch men represent a large bridging population, having sex with both men and women.  \n \nThe growing at-risk groups situation is further complicated by the near total absence of \n20. \ncondoms in rural areas, where most people live and where most people infected with HIV are \nlocated.  Moreover,  general  cultural  reluctance  to  discuss  sex  and  sexuality  represents  one  of \nthe most serious deficits in most AIDS educational efforts.  \n \n21. \nGender and Cultural Issues. Gender and cultural, as well as institutional, issues also \ncontribute to the epidemic. While religions and traditional cultures discourage extramarital sex, \nin  many  PNG  cultures  premarital  sex  has  never  been  stringently  prohibited,  especially  among \nmales.  Most  development  enclaves  are  staffed  by  a  large  majority  of  males.  Their  paydays \nattract many women willing to exchange sex for  cash, and in some areas small brothels have \nemerged. In general, women are responsible for raising food for their families, and analysis of \nan  earlier  national  nutrition  survey  showed  that  small  cash  incomes  in  the  hands  of  women, \nrather  than  men,  benefit  children.  The  exchange  of  sex  for  material  goods  or  services  has \ntraditional roots in some but not most areas, where it is clearly the lack of means to raise a cash \nincome that motivates the rural sex trade.  \n \nChallenges  within  the  Health  System.  Overall,  PNG\u2019s  health  system  is  in  a  state  of \n22. \ndecline, with services becoming less accessible to rural people. Key health indicators such as \nimmunization  coverage  and  the  ratio  of  doctors  and  nurses  per  10,000  population  are  among \nthe  worst  in  the  Pacific region  (Supplementary  Appendix  1).  A  functioning  primary  health  care \nsystem  no  longer  exists  in  much  of  the  country.  Specifically,  the  Government  has  not  made \nsubstantial  financial  allocations  to  HIV/AIDS,  leaving  donors  to  determine  the  intensity  and \ndirection  of  the  response.  Technical  capacity  for  HIV/AIDS  work  in  all  sectors  is  low,  and \nprevention  strategies  over-emphasize  awareness  and  knowledge  for  the  general  population  in \nlieu of evidence-based targeted investments.  \n \n23. \nThe  HIV  surveillance  system  is  also  problematic.  Recent  efforts  have  attempted  to \nestablish  sentinel  surveillance  at  antenatal  clinics  and  STI  clinics  in  3\u20135  sites.  However,  the \nsystem  has  not  been  performing  reliably  and  the  data  reflect  unknown  biases.  Scanty \nsupervision, a slow confirmation process and poor reporting have seriously hampered the effort. \nHigh-risk  groups  have  not  been  included,  and  the  surveillance  has  not  evolved  into  second-\ngeneration  mode,  i.e.,  with  the  addition  of  at  least  one  STI  and  properly  sampled  behavioral \nsurveys.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nDonor  Funding  in  the  Health  Sector.  Donors  account  for  a  vast  share  of  the  health \n24. \nsector\u2019s  budget,  and  increasingly  this  funding  is  used  for  recurrent  costs.  However,  much  of \ndonor  financing  of  health  is  off  budget  and  outside  government  systems,  leading  to  a  diverse \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nand  fragmented  health  financing  system.7  All  sources  of  health  financing  clearly  need  to  be \nintegrated  under  the  government  systems  to  ensure  a  programmatic,  rather  than  project-\noriented, approach to health. The use of HSIP for this Project will help the Government plan and \nmanage health funds and activities in more systematically.  \n \n25. \nIncreased  Coordination  and  Information  Flows.  Overall  coordination  and  wider \ndissemination  of  information  from  various  development  partner-funded  projects  is  needed  for \nPNG\u2019s health sector. Health projects are often implemented in relative isolation from other, often \ncomplementary,  projects.  Many  health  projects  report  to  their  sponsor  and  government \ncounterpart,  but  little  of  this  information  is  distributed  to  other  development  partners  and \nstakeholders. Donor coordination or harmonization is needed to combat the HIV epidemic and \nhelp the Government develop an integrated strategy.  \n \n26. \nNeed  for  Greater  Oversight  and  Transparency.  A  key  lesson  learned  from  the \nEstablishment  of  Pilot  HIV/AIDS  Care  Centers8  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  that  greater \noversight  is  needed  for  project  implementation  as  well  as  regular  reporting  and  improved \ntransparency.  For  instance,  drug  stock-outs  have  been  frequent  in  the  HIV/AIDS  care  centers \nproject because of weak management and insufficient inventory controls on drugs. Hence, the \nProject  will  develop  direct  links  with  these  centers  to  facilitate  improved  supervision  and \nmanagement of their operations. \n \n27. \nCondom Distribution Programs. Investment in effective modes of HIV prevention has \nbeen  inadequate.  The  primary  mode  of  transmission  is  through  unsafe  sex,  indicating  a  great \nneed for increased and improved condom use. In spite of previous efforts at social marketing to \npromote  condom  use  and  reduce  the  stigma  of  having  HIV,  condom  use  has  not  risen \nsignificantly. An earlier social marketing program started well with low-priced condoms, but later \nattempted  to  generate  revenue  by  raising  prices  of  condoms.  Social  marketing  programs  that \naim  to  recoup  costs  have  not  been  successful  in  PNG  or  elsewhere.  The  better  programs \ndepend  on  donor  subsidies  but  use  the  full  panoply  of  private  sector  marketing  techniques, \nincluding extensive in-depth research repeated throughout the entire life of the project. \n \n28. \nThe  current  condom  distribution  effort  by  NAC  secretariat  (NACS)  and  AusAID\u2019s \nNational HIV/AIDS Support Project (NHASP) has made progress mainly in selected urban areas \nand in terms of brand recognition, but the program\u2019s impact nationwide has been limited. First, \nthe messages used do not reflect the totality and complexity of sexual behavior in PNG and the \ndifferences by region. Second, the entire campaign has been largely urban-biased (as has been \nthe  monitoring)  and  has  had  limited  reach  in  rural  areas,  where  most  of  the  HIV  is spreading. \nThird, the media campaign has not devoted sufficient attention to face-to-face contact with HIV-\npositive people, a technique that numerous studies have shown to be most effective.9 \n \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities \n\n29. \nDevelopments  in  Health  Institutions.  Although  many  gaps  remain  in  the  national \nresponse  to  HIV/AIDS,  there  have  been  some  positive  developments.  Recent  government \nactions include the appointment of a new adviser to the Prime Minister on HIV/AIDS and placing \n\n                                                 \n7   World Bank, AusAID, and ADB.

With the successful application to the Global \nFund,  which  is  aimed  primarily  at  developing  ARV  treatment  programs,  NDOH  has  become \nmore  involved  than  in  the  recent  past.  The  Global  Fund  will  enable  NDOH  to  build  up  an \nHIV/AIDS unit consisting of several people compared to just one person before the grant was \nprovided. Hence, the capacity for HIV/AIDS prevention and control within NDOH is expected to \ngrow and support HIV/AIDS projects. \n \n30. \nGlobal  Fund.  The  Global  Fund  entered  into  an  agreement  on  HIV/AIDS  with  the \nGovernment  on  30  June  2005.  The  association  with  the  Global  Fund  will  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s response to the HIV epidemic. The Project will work closely with the Global Fund \nunder  the  Country  Coordination  Mechanism  (CCM),  seeking  synergies  and  undertaking \ncomplementary activities. The support from the Global Fund for ARVs and rapid HIV test kits will \nbe  critical  inputs  for  the  public-private  partnerships  for  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  care  in  the \ndevelopment  enclaves  and  surrounding  communities.  The  partnerships  established  under  the \nProject  will  simultaneously  serve  as  highly  needed  outlets  for  distributing  the  Global  Fund \nprocurement  items  in  rural  areas.  It  will  be  critical,  however,  to  ensure  open  and  frequent \ncommunication  and  coordination  among  the  various  implementing  agencies  in  the  Project,  for \nthe Global Fund, and other major HIV/AIDS initiatives. \n \n31. \nOngoing ADB-Assisted Initiatives and PNG Country Strategy Program and Update.  \nUnder  TA  4208  (footnote  8)  a  fully  operational  care  center  has  been  organized  in  the  Port \nMoresby  General Hospital (PMGH)  providing treatment to  about 150 patients as of July 2005. \nThe  clinic\u2019s  establishment  was  a  collaborative  effort  by  NDOH,  PMGH,  World  Health \nOrganization  (WHO),  ADB,  and  AusAID.  Care  centers  are  programmed  for  urban  government \nhospitals in Mount Hagen, Lae, and Rabaul, using the model and experience of the care center \nin PMGH.. The Project will make use of these HIV/AIDS care centers in terms of referrals from \nthe public\u2013private partnerships and lower levels of public health facilities for advanced care of \nHIV/AIDS patients and HIV test confirmations.  \n \n32. \nPartnerships with Private Sector. The pre-fact-finding and fact-finding missions under \nthe  project  preparatory  TA  revealed  a  high  level  of  awareness  in  the  private  sector  of  the \nHIV/AIDS  problem,  its  relationship  with  surrounding  communities,  and  the  need  to  embark \nimmediately  on  HIV/AIDS  prevention  initiatives  in  and  around  the  communities.  Some  of  the \nlarger economic operators provide varying degrees of health services to their staff and families, \nbut many operators expressed their concern about how to tackle HIV/AIDS. The health services \ncould be restructured to accommodate the peripheral populations and operate as a focal point \nfor  HIV/AIDS  preventive  services  and  initializing  treatment  and  care  for  people  living  with \nHIV/AIDS.  The  public\u2013private  partnership  will  merge  the  Government\u2019s  response  to  HIV/AIDS \nwith  the  private  sector\u2019s  need  to  maintain  a  healthy,  productive  workforce  and  surrounding \ncommunities. Participation will be encouraged by the government but will be voluntary. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n33. \nIn line with the MTDS and NSP, the expected impact will be \u201cto have controlled by 2015, \nand  stabilized  by  2020,  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS.\u201d10  The  outcome  will  be  strengthened  by \nGovernment  efforts  to  develop  comprehensive  responses  to  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemic,  with  a \n\n                                                 \n10  The Government\u2019s version of the Millennium Development Goal 6, target 7, has been tailored to be more realistic \n\nfor PNG and has been integrated into the MTDS. \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nfocus  on  establishing  operational  partnerships  and  links  to  restructure  rural  health  services \nassociated with development enclaves.11 \n \nPrivate  sector  health  services  provided  by  economic  operators12  to  their  staff  and \n34. \nfamilies will be restructured to accommodate the surrounding populations and will operate as a \nfocal point for HIV/AIDS preventive services, VCT, and treatment and care. The public\u2013private \npartnership will merge the Government\u2019s response to HIV/AIDS with the private sector\u2019s need to \nmaintain a healthy, productive workforce and surrounding communities. \n \n35. \nIntegrating the fight against HIV/AIDS in other sectors in addition to health is a strategy \nthat  requires  cooperation  and  partnership  arrangements  between  key  government  agencies, \nprivate  industry,  development  partners,  and  civil  society  organizations.  Prevention  will  be  the \nhigher  strategic  priority.  At  the  same  time,  core  public  health  strategies  will  not  be \novershadowed  by  the  HIV/AIDS  response.  Improved  health  services  extended  to  surrounding \npopulations  will  include  maternal  and  child  health  services,  immunization,  malaria  prevention, \nTB control, and health promotion. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n36. \nThe Project proposes to help strengthen government leadership and the implementation \nof strategies to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS, with a focus on rural populations. The Project \nhas  four  components,  which  were  designed  in  close  coordination  with  ongoing  and  planned \nHIV/AIDS initiatives under the Global Fund (through NDOH), NACS, and the main development \npartners  active  in  PNG.  Many  of  the  components\u2019  activities  are  consistent  with  or  directly \nsupport the NSP 2004\u20132008.13 The four components are the following: \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Establish Public\u2013Private Sector Partnerships in Rural \nDevelopment Enclaves and Interagency Partnerships \n\n37. \nComponent  1  comprises  four  elements:  (i)  public\u2013private  partnerships  with  rural \neconomic operators to extend and improve rural health service delivery and HIV prevention and \ncare;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  rural  health  infrastructure  for  primary  health  care  and  upgrading  of \nfacilities  required  for  HIV  prevention,  testing,  and  care;  (iii)  collaboration  with  WHO,  NDOH, \nNACS,  and  partners\u2019  training  and  protocols;  and  (iv)  development  of  leadership  for  HIV/AIDS \nadvocacy. \n \n\na. \n\nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships with Rural Economic Operators \n\n \n38. \nPrimary health care, including maternal and child health, and HIV/AIDS prevention and \ntreatment  will  be  expanded  in  rural  areas  by  establishing  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  rural \n\n                                                 \n11 \u201cDevelopment enclave\u201d refers to a particular area in a rural setting that has a significant private sector investment \nemploying  a  large  number  of  people,  becomes  a  cash  economy  in  a  generally  subsistence  rural  economy  in  the \nsurrounding communities, and typically becomes the major (or only) economic driver in the area. One investment \nproject may dominate an entire district or provincial economy, making it a hub of economic activity. \n\n12  \u201cEconomic  operator\u201d  refers  to  the  core  private  industry  in  the  development  enclave,  usually  a  single  dominant \nmining operation, plantation, fisheries plant, or other such project. The owner or company may have headquarters \nand other project sites elsewhere in PNG or overseas, and the activity in the enclave is often run by a subsidiary \nthat has negotiated land-use rights and royalties agreements with the land-owning clan. \n\n13  The  NSP  2004\u20132008  contains  seven  focus  areas:  (i)  treatment,  counseling,  and  care  and  support;  (ii)  education \nand  prevention  through  behavior  change;  (iii)  epidemiology  and  surveillance;  (iv)  social  and  behavior  change \nresearch; (v) leadership, partnership, and coordination; (vi) family and community support; and (vii) monitoring and \nevaluation. \n\n\fdevelopment  enclaves.  The  private  operator  will  support  the  extension  of  health  services \nbeyond  their  immediate  employees  and  their  families  to  the  communities  surrounding  the \ndevelopment  enclave.  The  local  public  health  facilities  and  aid  posts,  where  functioning,  will \ncontinue to provide health services to the wider population, but the private operator will provide \nadditional management and supervision support to the community health facility to ensure more \neffective services. Where local public health facilities are not functioning around an enclave, the \nGovernment  and  private  operator  will  work  together  in  rehabilitating  the  facilities  and  staffing \nthem  with  appropriate  health  personnel  (provided  by  government).  Public\u2013private  partnerships \nfor primary health care and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment will be launched in at least four \nrural development enclaves and expand to more sites later. \n \n39. \nThe  Project  will  enhance  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  initiate  such  partnerships  and \noffer a range of inputs that will be negotiated and tailored to each development enclave's needs. \nEach  enterprise  and  development  enclave  is  unique,  defined  by  the  cultural  setting  of \nsurrounding  communities,  the  type  of  enterprise,  and  their  ongoing  interaction.  Template \nmemoranda of agreement (MOAs) will be designed under the Project and approved by CCM for \n(i)  partnerships  with  private  sector  economic  operators;  and  (ii)  civil  society  organizations \nproviding at least one of the following: VCT, care, treatment, and training. Other template MOAs \nmay be prepared as the need arises.  \n \n\nb. \n\nRural Health Infrastructure and Supplies \n\n40. \nThe  partnerships  will  require  strengthened  health  infrastructure  in  the  rural  areas.  The \nProject  will  upgrade  health  facilities  in  the  pilot  areas  by  repairing  clinics,  partitioning  off \ncounseling rooms for the privacy of VCT, supplying additional medical equipment and supplies, \nand providing vehicles for community outreach and emergency transport. The Government will \ncontribute its normal staff, supplies, and equipment, but also ensure that rapid HIV test kits, STI \nmedicines,  and  ARV  treatment  from  the  Global  Fund  are  provided  to  enclave  clinics  and \nsurrounding health facilities.14 \n \n\nc. \n\nCollaboration with WHO, NDOH, NACS, and Partners\u2019 Training and \nProtocols \n\n41. \nThe  public-private  partnership  arrangements  are  designed  to  coordinate  with  WHO, \nNDOH,  NACS,  and  other  partners\u2019  training  of  health  care  providers  and  the  development  of \nprotocols  for  VCT,  HIV-related  laboratory  activities,  and  treatment.  WHO  is  funding  and \nconducting  these  activities  through  a  separate  project,  but  the  proposed  Project  is  meant  to \ncomplement  WHO,  NDOH,  NACS,  and  other  partners\u2019  work  on  training  and  protocols  by \nproviding equipment, supplies, and facilities upgrading in participating enclaves. \n \n\nd. \n\nDeveloping Leadership for HIV/AIDS Advocacy \n\n42. \nAn important dimension of public\u2013private partnerships for HIV/AIDS prevention is strong \nleadership. The Project will provide additional financial support to UNAIDS (PNG Office) for its \nongoing efforts to develop leadership in HIV/AIDS advocacy by working with national, provincial, \nand district leaders. UNAIDS will also promote the \u201cthree ones\u201d among central, provincial, and \ndistrict  government  agencies,  and  among  all  stakeholders.  The  Project  will  help  UNAIDS \nengage in technical dialogue with churches. \n \n\n                                                 \n14 ARVs will only be distributed to clinics in the development enclaves that have appropriately trained health staff. \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Community Behavior Change, and Social Marketing of \nCondoms \n\n43. \nComponent 2 entails two sets of activities: (i) developing the competency of community \nand civil society organizations to work to address issues related to the HIV epidemic that lead to \nsustainable behavior change, and (ii) the social marketing of condoms throughout the country.  \n \n\na. \n\nStrengthening Civil Society Organizations to Engage in Community \nBehavior Change \n\n44. \nThe Project will strengthen local civil society organizations and local communities in and \naround selected development enclaves to undertake long-term behavior change strategies and \nmonitor behavioral change. The strategies will engage communities and develop HIV prevention \nprograms  for  the  workforce,  residents,  and  settlers  to  change  norms  and  behaviors  to  reduce \nexposure  to  HIV  infection.  Target  groups  will  include  the  workforce,  women  who  sell  or \nexchange  sex,  their  main  clients/partners,  and high-risk  youth  in  the  economic  enclave  and/or \nsurrounding  communities.  This  component  will  complement  the  work  of  the  provincial  AIDS \ncommittees, the European Union Sexual Health Project, and NHASP.  \n \n45. \nThe  Project  will  build  the  capacity  of  local  agencies:  NGOs,  community-based \norganizations  (CBOs),  faith-based  organizations  (FBOs),  and  groups  formed  within  the \nworkplace  or  villages,  to  understand  and  manage  the  threat  of  HIV/AIDS.  Private  sector \ncompanies,  unions,  self-help  groups,  and  others  will  be  engaged  to  learn  the  principles  of \nbehavior  change  and  how  to  implement  them  in  their  own  environments.  Wherever  possible, \nstructural interventions will be encouraged to complement group and individual behavior change \nprogramming.  The  behavioral  change  strategies  will  be  closely  linked  with  the  STI  treatment, \nVCT,  and  HIV  care  activities  in  component  1,  with  equipment  and  training  provided  to  the \npartners.  A  monitoring  system  will  be  developed  so  that  feedback  is  readily  available  for \nanalysis and for adjusting the strategies. \n \n46. \nEach community-based sexual risk reduction behavior change program will be culturally \nappropriate and tailored to local communities. This will ensure that specific customary behaviors \nof indigenous groups in the target areas are respected and addressed appropriately. \n \n47. \nin  behavior  change \nprogramming  will  be  engaged  to  work  with  each  development  enclave  and  the  local \ncommunities to develop and implement the targeted behavior change strategies. The contracted \nNGO  or  company  will  develop  the  capacities  of  economic  operators  and  local  groups  in  the \nfollowing areas: \n \n\ninternational  NGO  or  company  with  diverse  expertise \n\nAn \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nmain methods of proven behavior change programming; \nformative qualitative research in the workplace and surrounding communities; \nsize estimations of at-risk groups; \nbaseline and repeat surveys (behavioral and biomarkers, if possible) after which \nthe enclave may be included in the national surveillance system; \ntargeted peer outreach with supervision and support; \nprovision of \u201csafe space,\u201d e.g., a drop-in or resource center; \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii)  materials/media production specific to local lifestyles and beliefs and developed \n\nby local people; \ntraining health workers on managing clients (attitudes);  \n\n(viii) \n\n\f(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nproviding information on research findings from PNG and suggested from around \nthe world to the local people involved in behavior change programs and others in \nPNG to correct misperceptions related to HIV prevention; and \ndesigning training for all stakeholders, including representatives of at-risk groups. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nSocial Marketing of Condoms \n\n48. \nChanging  high-risk  behavior  requires  that  affordable,  quality  condoms  be  available \nnationwide  (see  Appendix  3).  Pooled  funds  cofinanced  by  ADB  and  the  governments  of \nAustralia and New Zealand will enable a sufficiently large investment to be made for contracting \na  professional  not-for-profit  company  to  engage  in  the  social  marketing  and  distribution  of \ncondoms  for  an  initial  4  years.  The  social  marketing  of  condoms  under  the  Project  will \ncomplement, not replace, existing condom supply mechanisms carried out by NDOH, NAC, and \nthe  NHASP,  essentially  scaling  up  the  effort  nationwide  and  complementing  HIV  awareness \nefforts.15  \n \n49. \n \n\nThe objectives of a national social marketing program include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nexpanded condom sales among the general population and priority target groups \nthrough innovative, research-based, and professional marketing strategies; \nimproved supply and accessibility of low-priced, high-quality condoms in all parts \nof the country; \n\n(iii)  more equitable distribution of affordable sexual health products to assure access \n\nfor rural and low-income groups; \nimproved levels of adoption of safer sex behaviors among all sectors of society; \nand \nincreased participation of the private sector and public\u2013private partnerships at all \nlevels for wider distribution of social marketing products. \n\n \n50. \nThe  contracted  not-for-profit  social  marketing  company  will  conduct  repeated  surveys \nand other forms of research, including in-depth qualitative research and size estimations of at-\nrisk  groups,  to  understand  the  potential  consumers\u2019  beliefs  and  preferences  and  coverage \nneeds.  An  assessment  will  also  be  made  of  the  existing  condom  distribution  program  for  the \n\u201cKaramap\u201d  brand,  including  the  potential  for  integrating  it  into  the  national  social  marketing \nprogram.  The  not-for-profit  company  will  then  develop  a  marketing  strategy  based  on  the \nresearch  for  (i)  the  general  population,  emphasizing  rural  areas;  and  (ii)  high-risk  groups  or \nsettings in urban and rural areas. Targeted programs for sex workers, youth, and men who have \nsex with men will also be included within the range of market sub-segments. The not-for-profit \ncompany will develop an efficient, stable, and secure distribution system able to deliver products \nto  urban  and  rural  outlets.  Traditional  outlets  (wholesalers,  pharmacies,  food  stores,  hotel \nshops)  and  nontraditional  outlets  (guest  houses,  small  kiosks,  night  clubs,  bars,  markets)  are \nexpected to be targeted distribution points. Thousands of such distribution points are required.  \n \n51. \nAll  condoms  and  other  commodities  for  the  social  marketing  program  will  be  procured \nsolely by the not-for-profit company to maintain constant supply and ensure consistent quality. \nMonthly marketing statistics will also be retrieved from a country-wide monitoring system for the \nsocially  marketed  condoms.  The  program  will  include  measuring  behavior,  knowledge,  and \nattitude  changes  in  representative  sentinel  sites  throughout  the  country.  The  not-for-profit \n\n                                                 \n15  The  social  marketing  will  also  consider  the  lessons  learned  from  the  existing  condom  distribution  programs  and \n\nmay roll them into the Project later. \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\ncompany  will  hire,  train,  and  supervise  its  own  staff  members  as  local  teams  for  the  various \nactivities.  \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Strengthen and Expand Surveillance System for HIV \n\nto  collaborate  with  WHO\u2019s \n\n52. \nSupport  will  be  given  to  strengthen  and  expand  PNG\u2019s  current,  but  limited,  sero-\nsurveillance system for HIV/AIDS (see Appendix 4). The initial step will be to facilitate the move \nof the surveillance system from NACS to NDOH as already planned by NACS. This will include \ncapacity  building  for  NDOH  to  assume  HIV/AIDS  surveillance.  An  HIV/AIDS  surveillance  unit \nwithin  the  Disease  Control  Branch  of  NDOH  will  be  established  to  focus  on  sero-surveillance. \nThe Project will review the system and prepare and implement a comprehensive plan to expand \nit  to  cover  in  a  phased  manner  all  provincial  hospital-based  antenatal  clinics,  STI  clinics  and \nblood banks, selected district hospitals/health centers, and participating enclaves. The plan will \nconsider  how \nin-country  health  surveillance  activities  and \ninternational networks. \n \nTo  operationalize  the  surveillance  system  at  the  facility  level,  project  activities  will \n53. \ninclude providing training and equipment to hospitals, health centers, blood banks, and enclaves \nto  conduct  HIV/AIDS  surveillance  and  communicate  information  to  the  appropriate  level  of \nauthority. Protocols and reference manuals will be developed under component 3 and provided \nto the participating health facilities. \n \n54. \nComplementing the sero-surveillance to be performed by NDOH, the Project will help the \nNational  Research  Institute  (NRI)  develop  technical  capabilities  to  conduct  behavioral \nsurveillance related to HIV and STIs. Consultants and field interviewers will work under NRI to \nconduct behavioral surveillance and institutionalize the capacity at NRI. The Project will provide \nequipment to NRI for behavioral surveillance surveys and related research. Surveillance by NRI \nwill  be  closely  coordinated  with  NDOH\u2019s  forthcoming  role  in  HIV  surveillance  and  feed  into \nNACS\u2019s overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system.  \n \n55. \nAn additional activity under component 3 is to support the implementation of the National \nStrategic Plan for Monitoring and Evaluation, 2006\u20132010. The HIV/AIDS surveillance system is \none of several important parts of the overall national HIV/AIDS M&E system planned by NACS, \nand the soon-to-be launched system is only partly funded by AusAID and UNAIDS.  \n \n\n4. \n\nComponent 4: Project Management \n\n56. \nThe  Project  will  provide  the  following  support  to  strengthen  project  management  and \nimplementation:  (i)  coordination  and  management  support,  (ii)  project  performance  M&E \nsystem, (iii) procurement support, (iv) field supervision, and (v) accounting support. Consultants \nwill  be  engaged  to  provide  these  forms  of  support  to  NDOH  and  other  involved  government \nbodies  (Appendix  5).  The  project  coordinator\u2019s  functions  will  include  liaison  with  stakeholders; \ndata  and  document  collection;  support  of  international  and  domestic  consultants;  provision  of \nlogistics support; assistance in organizing Project training or workshops; provision of necessary \ninformation needed by CCM to review progress and make recommendations; and project M&E. \n \n57. \nA  procurement  specialist  will  assist  the  Government\u2019s  Central  Supply  and  Tenders \nBoard and NDOH with all the necessary procurement items and procedures, except the tender \nand selection process for engaging a not-for-profit company to perform social marketing and the \nbehavioral change firm required under component 2. A field supervisor will regularly follow up in \nproject  sites\u2014the  rural  development  enclaves  and  the  surrounding  communities\u2014to  assess \n\n\fprogress  and  implementation,  identify  problems  in  implementation,  and  provide  reports  to  the \nstakeholders. An additional accountant will be placed in the HSIP management branch to assist \nin project accounting, disbursements, reconciliation, and other functions. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n58. \nADB helped establish the framework and the financial arrangements for a health SWAp \nthrough  the  Health  Sector  Development  Program  (HSDP).16  From  1998  to  2001,  HSDP \npromoted  health  sector  reforms  and  linkages  between  NDOH  and  the  provinces.  HSDP  also \nfostered stronger NDOH leadership and improved cooperation between development partners. \nBuilding  on  the  success  of  these  initiatives,  the  Government  committed  itself  to  the  HSIP,  a \nproposed  SWAp  in  the  health  sector.  Billed  as  the  cornerstone  in  the  reform  process  of  the \npublic health sector, HSIP has broad recognition and acceptance by key development partners. \nADB\u2019s association with the development of the SWAp is equally recognized. \n \n59. \nThe  Health  Partnership  Arrangement,  in  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  steps  toward  a \nSWAp in the health sector, was signed in November 2004 by the ministers of health, treasury, \nnational planning, and rural development (for the Government), and by AusAID, NZAID, United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and WHO. The \ndocument  is  not  legally  binding  but  rather  embodies  the  aspirations  of  the  DPs  for  greater \nharmonization and coordination in the sector. ADB plans to sign the document. \n \n60. \nIn  line  with  ADB\u2019s  intention  to  become  a  signatory  to  the  Health  Partnership \nArrangement,  the  Project  will  support  the  health  sector  SWAp  to  strengthen  government \nsystems  and  to  endow  NDOH  with  the  capacity  to  undertake  and  monitor  public\u2013private \npartnerships in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Supporting this long-term reform process will require \nconcerted management efforts and some degree of flexibility from all participants. \n \nThe  Project  seeks  to  attain  higher  levels  of  coordination  among  government,  private \n61. \nsector,  development  partners,  NGOs,  CBOs,  FBOs,  and  the  affected  communities  by \nemphasizing  partnerships  in  the  response  to  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemic.  Government\u2013private \nsector partnerships have worked successfully in many developing countries but have not been \ntried in PNG. Government agencies involved in HIV/AIDS have not coordinated well in the past, \nand  the  Project  intends  to  help  bridge  this  gap.  The  coordination  of  projects  and  specific \nactivities  of  development  partners,  such  as  WHO\u2019s  VCT  training  and  protocol  development  in \nrural areas, will result in more efficient use of resources and synergies, in turn fostering greater \nharmonization of activities under a single, broad national framework for HIV/AIDS. \n \n62. \nThe Project will develop a special relationship with the Global Fund. First, the Project will \nsupport the development of CCM, which was established under the Global Fund to oversee the \nadministration  of  funds  and  activities.  In  addition  to  capacity  building  for  the  planned  CCM \nsecretariat,  the  Project\u2019s  activities  give  additional  substance  to  CCM\u2019s  oversight  functions. \nSecond, the public\u2013private partnerships in the development enclaves will provide critical outlets \nfor Global Fund ARVs and rapid HIV test kits in rural areas. Early on, the Government must find \nnumerous  qualified  facilities  in  the  Global  Fund  to  disseminate  the  ARVs  and  test  kits.  By \nproviding qualified outlets, the Project will enhance the Government\u2019s ability to distribute Global \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 1997.

The  consortium  comprises  ADB,  Government,  AusAID  and  NZAID,  is  non-\nexclusive,  and  may  accept  other  cofinanciers  at  any  time.  This  collaborative  mechanism  is \ndesigned  to  ensure  stability  and  sustainability  for  as  long  as  the  epidemic  persists.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to lead in engaging the not-for-profit social marketing firm and \nmanaging  the  contract  to  help  insulate  this  critical  public  health  intervention  from  influences \noutside best practices in public health. NZAID and AusAID have indicated their staunch support \nfor  ADB  to  undertake  the  contracting  and  administration  of  the  social  marketing  firm  contract. \nRecognizing  the  complementary  objectives  of  the  two  subcomponents  under  component  2, \nGovernment has requested that the international NGO/consulting firm for behavior change also \nbe engaged and administered by ADB. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n64. \nTotal  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties,  is \nestimated  to  be  $25  million.  About  42%,  or  $10.5  million,  of  the  project  cost  is  in  foreign \nexchange, and 58% ($14.5 million equivalent) is in local currency (Table 1).

The  Project  will  therefore  be  implemented  under \nthe umbrella of the HSIP, the national SWAp for health sector development. The HSIP systems \nwere originally established in 1998 under the ADB-supported HSDP, and later extended to allow \nother  development  partners  to  include  their  funds  in  the  SWAp.18  The  HSIP  (formerly  HSDP) \ntrust account has been a success since 1998. This secure channel of provincial health funding \noperates parallel to Government financial systems but follows nearly identical procedures, and \nis  highly  regarded  by  Government  and  development  partners.  The  HSIP  management  branch \nmanages  funds  from  the  Global  Fund,  AusAID,  NZAID,  and  ADB.  The  HSIP  was  critical  in \nsecuring  Global  Fund  monies  for  malaria  (round  2)  and  HIV/AIDS  (round  4).  NDOH  manages \nthe HSIP in partnership with development partners. Accounting is supported by an international \naccounting  firm,  reporting  is  monthly,  and  HSIP  operations  are  subject  to  regular  audits.  It  is \nincreasingly owned by NDOH. \n \n67. \nNDOH  will  be  the  project  Executing  Agency,  and  together  with  the  project  coordinator \n(an individual consultant based within NDOH) will work in close association with the HSIP in all \nmatters of project administration, as well as with CCM. Exceptionally, so as not to overburden \nthe NDOH and HSIP in an area where they lack expertise and experience, and in recognition of \nthe  special  arrangement  established  by  the  consortium  of  development  partners  to  cofinance \nand support the social marketing of condoms program, the Government has requested that ADB \nengage  the  consultant  for  the  behavioral  change  and  communication  program  and  the  social \nmarketing  of  condoms  program  and  administer  both  contracts  under  component  2.  The \nGovernment has also requested that all reporting by contractors of ADB be provided to NDOH \nand CCM. \n \n\n                                                 \n18 See Loan 1516-PNG/1517-PNG (SF) and the associated investment loan, Loan 1518-PNG(SF). ADB has funds in \n\nthe HSIP trust account. \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nfirm \n\nAt  the  joint  request  of  the  Government,  AusAID,  and  NZAID,  ADB  will  engage  the \n68. \nconsultants  and  administer  the  consultancy  services  under  the  two  consultancy  contracts \nrequired  for  component  2.  ADB  will  also  institute  all  operational  links  between  these  two \nconsultancy  contracts.  For  the  contracted  companies,  the  framework  of  general  terms  and \nconditions  contained  in  the  TA  framework  agreement  (6  May  1996)  between  the  Government \nand ADB will apply. \n \n69. \nCCM will review progress and guide project implementation, ensuring that management \nand  resource  efficiencies  are  achieved  with  the  Global  Fund.  The  secretary  of  health  chairs \nCCM.  ADB  has  been  given  an  active  seat  on  CCM.  CCM  meetings  will  be  held  at  least \nquarterly. The Project will help support and develop the CCM secretariat. CCM has functioning \ntechnical working groups for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The group for HIV/AIDS will review and \nadvise on the Project\u2019s technical aspects. \n \n70. \nNDOH  will  review  and  be  a  signatory  to  partnership  arrangements  embodied  in  MOAs \nbetween  the  Government  and  (i)  rural  economic  operators,  (ii)  civil  society  organizations,  and \n(iii)  any  other  related  agencies,  covering  respective  responsibilities  in  relation  to  project \nobjectives and activities. \n \n71. \nThe Project will be implemented by NDOH, NACS, provincial and district health offices, \nhospitals  and  health  facilities,  NRI,  WHO,  UNAIDS,  NGOs,  a  not-for-profit  social  marketing \ncompany,  a \nfor  behavioral  change,  and  participating  economic  operators  (see \nimplementation  arrangements  and  structures  in  Appendix  8).  NDOH  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  a  comprehensive,  nationwide  HIV  surveillance  system.  NACS  will  facilitate  a \nseamless and timely transfer of existing data and files of the current HIV surveillance system to \nNDOH. NDOH and NACS will cooperate in the production and distribution of data and analytical \ninformation on the evolution of, and response to, the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Implementation of the \nnational  M&E  system  will  be  supported  by  the  UN\u2019s  joint  program  for  an  HIV/AIDS  M&E \nenhancement support project. The Project will support and contribute to the implementation of \nthe M&E system by working with this joint program. NRI\u2019s behavioral surveillance will also feed \ninto the overall M&E system. \n \nADB  will  select  the  not-for-profit  social  marketing  company  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s \n72. \nguidelines. The consultancy selection committee will evaluate the proposals using a quality- and \ncost-based  selection  method.  ADB  will  transfer  the  installment  payments  directly  to  the \ncontracted  not-for-profit  company  upon  clearance  being  given  by  its  Pacific  Regional \nDepartment. \n \n73. \nThe  Project  will  develop  the  capacity  of  NDOH  to  negotiate  with  the  participating \neconomic operators to establish individual public\u2013private partnerships. A template MOA will be \nused  to  define  respective  roles  and  responsibilities,  inputs,  and  expected  outputs.  Subsidiary \npublic\u2013private relationships will also be included to capture the network of participants involved \nin the response to HIV/AIDS. \n \nUnder  the  MOA  with  selected  rural  economic  operators,  rural  health  facilities  in \n74. \ncommunities  around  the  development  enclaves  will  be  rehabilitated  to  provide  primary  health \ncare  services,  including  prevention  of  HIV,  VCT,  and  care  of  people  with  HIV.  The  economic \noperators will provide oversight and manage the partnerships with the public health facilities in \ntheir  communities  and  provide  health  services  to  their  employees  and  the  surrounding \ncommunities. \n \n\n\fThe Project will help NDOH support and/or contract selected NGOs, CBOs, and FBOs in \n75. \ndelivering  and/or  training  in  HIV  prevention,  VCT,  treatment  and  care,  including  home-based \ncare. Evidence-based performance will guide the selection process of NGOs, CBOs, and FBOs \nengaged to assist NDOH. \n \n76. \nIn  matters  related  to  the  development  of  counseling,  testing,  treatment,  and  care \nprotocols,  and  adaptation  for  implementation  in  one  or  more  PNG  contexts,  WHO  will  help \nNDOH  establish  standards  to  be  applied  under  the  Project.  Similarly,  in-service  training \nprograms  of  the  above  functions  will  be  facilitated  by  WHO  under  the  responsibility  of  NDOH. \nThe  Project  will  support  and  make  use  of  NDOH\u2013WHO  competencies  in  VCT,  treatment,  and \ncare training, including home-based care. \n \nThe  Project  will  work  with  NDOH,  WHO,  and  provincial  hospitals  to  develop  hospital \n77. \nreferral centers patterned on the model established by the Heduru Clinic at PMGH. The Project \nwill  also  help  develop  public\u2013private  partnerships  between  provincial  hospitals  and  rural \neconomic operators. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n78. \nThe Project will be implemented over 4 years, and is expected to start in February 2006 \nand  end  in  January  2010.  The  first  3  months  will  focus  on  fielding  consultants  and  recruiting \nstaff,  reviewing  baseline  data  for  M&E,  detailed  project  planning,  engaging  consultants  for  the \nsocial  marketing  and  behavioral  change  subcomponents,  and  signing  and  activating  MOAs \nbetween the Government and economic operators. The implementation schedule is in Appendix \n9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nGrant-financed  civil  works,  goods  and  materials  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \n79. \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Project  civil  works  are  small  and  limited  to  the  repair  and \nupgrade of existing facilities, requiring no land acquisition. The small civil works are unlikely to \nattract  foreign  bidders,  and  therefore  civil  works  will  be  awarded  through  local  competitive \nbidding  or,  where  circumstances  warrant  and  for  contracts  valued  at  under  $100,000,  through \nthe  direct  selection  of  those  economic  operators  participating  in  the  Project.  The  Government \nwill submit details of the number and scope of civil works for ADB approval before withdrawing \nfunds for civil works expenditures. \n \n80. \nGoods and materials valued at $1 million or more will be procured through international \ncompetitive  bidding,  and  those  valued  at  over  $100,000  and  under  $1  million  will  use \ninternational  shopping  or  local  competitive  bidding.  Direct  procurement  may  be  used  when \nbuying small off-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nInternational  and  local  consultants  will  be  recruited,  either  as  companies  or  as \n81. \nindividuals,  to  implement  certain  aspects  of  the  Project.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n82. \nIndividual international consultants will be engaged by NDOH for the following positions: \n(i)  project  coordinator,  (ii)  HIV  sero-surveillance  specialist/epidemiologist,  (iii)  behavioral \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nsurveillance  specialist,  and  (iv)  procurement  specialist.  (See  Appendix  9  for  the  number  of \nperson-months for each position.) \n \n83. \nIndividual  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged,  also  by  NDOH,  to  fill  the  following \npositions: (i) project accountant; (ii) field supervisor; (iii) trainer supervisors for surveillance; (iv) \nstatistician;  (v)  data  entry  clerks;  and  (vi)  interviewers.  (See  Appendix  9  for  the  number  of \nperson-months for each position.) \n \nTwo international companies will be engaged by ADB under component 2. ADB will also \n84. \nadminister both contracts. Under the first contract, a company will be engaged to design, train, \nsupervise, and monitor the behavior change programs carried out through local NGOs, CBOs,  \nFBOs, and communities. Under the second contract, a company will be engaged to design the \nplan for, and then conduct the social marketing of condoms. The condoms and related supplies \nfor  the  social  marketing  program  will  be  procured  by  the  contracted  company.  Contenders  for \nboth  contracts  under  component  2  are  expected  to  include  not-for-profit  companies  and \ninternational  NGOs.  These  consultants  will  be  recruited  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method. \n \n85. \nvoids will be filled with additional qualified consultants. \n \n\nNDOH  will  ensure  that  qualified  staff  members  are  assigned  to  the  Project,  and  any \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy19  was explained to and discussed with the Government and \n86. \nNDOH. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the grant regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the NDOH and all contracts, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n87. \nAll  funds  originating  from  the  cofinanciers,  i.e.,  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New \nZealand, will be paid to ADB and will be used exclusively for meeting payments to the not-for-\nprofit  company  engaged  under  component  2  (ii)  for  the  social  marketing  of  condoms.  At  the \nrequest  of  the  Government  of  PNG,  ADB  will  take  responsibility  for  administering  the  funds \nprovided by Australia and New Zealand, and for managing the social marketing contract. \n \n88. \nAll proceeds of the grant not required for component 2 of the Project may be disbursed \nthrough  the  imprest  account,  which  may  be  pooled  in  the  HSIP  trust  account,  which  operates \nunder the oversight of the HSIP management branch. All proceeds of the grant thus deposited \nin  the  imprest  account  (within  the  HSIP  trust  account)  shall  be  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook20  (January  2001),  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed on between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be \n\n                                                 \n19   ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy: Description . Manila. \n20   ADB. 2001. AB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila \n\n\fdeposited into the HSIP trust account shall be based on the estimated expenditures for the first \n6 months of project implementation, not exceeding the ceiling of $1 million. \n \n89. \nUsing the funds deposited into the imprest account (within the HSIP trust account), the \nHSIP  management  branch  will  undertake  procurement  on  behalf  of  NDOH,  NACS,  UNAIDS, \nqualified NGOs, FBOs, CBOs, participating private economic operators, and any other relevant \nparties based on arrangements under approved MOAs (see flow of funds in Appendix 10).  \n \nThe  imprest  account  is  for  the  sole  use  of  this  Project.  Since  the  imprest  account  is \n90. \npooled  within  HSIP  trust  account,  all  funds  through  the  imprest  account  need  to  be  recorded \nseparately, accounted for, and audited. NDOH, with the supervision of the department\u2019s external \nauditor, will submit to ADB the liquidation of all expenditures for the Imprest Account quarterly or \nmore  frequently,  depending  on  the  use  of  the  funds.  A  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  and \nproject  financial  report  showing  the  source  and  use  of  funds,  certified  by  the  project \ndirector/manager  or  the  representatives  of  the  Project  and  endorsed  by  the  external  auditor \nshall  be  attached  to  the  withdrawal  application.  Any  amount  not  disbursed  from  the  imprest \naccount or any amount not disbursed for an eligible expenditure will be returned to ADB in the \ncurrency of the original payment (US dollars). \n \n91. \nThe  EA,  through  the  HSIP  management  branch  director,  will  formulate  expenditure \nestimates  for  each  year  of  implementation  based  on  project  activities.  The  budgets  will  be \nreviewed  and  updated  quarterly.  All  budgets  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  CCM  before \nimplementation.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001),  the \nSOE  procedure  will  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating  advances  to \nthe  HSIP  trust  account  to  ensure  speedy  project  implementation.  The  ceiling  on  SOE  is \n$100,000 per payment. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n92. \nThe Government will ensure that sound accounting and auditing standards according to \ninternationally  accepted  practices  are  applied  by  NDOH  and  all  other  project  implementing \nagencies.  The  HSIP  trust  account  is  subjected  to  rigorous  annual  audits  by  a  professional \nauditing firm. These audit reports will be made available to the Government, ADB, CCM, NDOH, \nand all implementing agencies. Accounting will be carried out by HSIP management branch with \nguidance from the Department of Finance. Annual audits of all NDOH activity will be conducted \nby the auditor general or delegated to a professional auditing firm operating under the auspices \nof the auditor general.  \n \n93. \nThe  HSIP  secretariat  will  submit  the  auditors\u2019  reports,  copies  of  the  certified  accounts, \nand  related  financial  statements,  including  auditors\u2019  opinions  on  the  use  of  grant  proceeds, \ncompliance  with  grant  covenants,  and  the  SOE  procedure  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the \nclose of each fiscal year. \n \n94. \nAll  implementing  agencies  will  provide  quarterly  reports  to  NDOH.  NDOH  will  then \nsubmit  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  to  CCM,  ADB,  and  other  relevant \nstakeholders. The EA will prepare the reports and address necessary improvements for project \nactivities  and  institutional  development  aspects  of  the  Project.  The  quarterly  progress  reports \nwill  have  information  on  the  physical  progress  of  activities,  status  of  compliance  with  grant \ncovenants, organizational and financial issues, the proposed program of activities, and expected \nprogress  in  the  next  3  months.  The  reports  will  be  widely  disseminated  and  shared  with  all \nstakeholders. \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n95. \nData  will  be  collected  to  monitor  progress  in  achieving  the  project  objectives. \nSpecifically, the EA and the project coordinator will jointly develop a project performance M&E \nsystem  that  will  provide  the  Government,  ADB,  AusAID,  and  NZAID  with  information  on  (i) \ntechnical  performance  of  the  Project;  (ii)  measures  of  project  impact,  including  social  and \neconomic  benefits;  and  (iii)  progress  toward  targets  and  goals  identified  in  the  project  design \nand  monitoring  framework  and  the  MTDS.  Some  baseline  data  already  exist,  such  as  the \nquarterly  routine  case  reporting  and  periodic  sentinel  surveillance  activities,  the  report  of  the \n2004  National  Consensus  Workshop,  AIDS  indicator  surveys,  2000  demographic  and  health \nsurvey, NHASP surveys and reports, reports from the four STI clinics (Mt. Hagen, Port Moresby, \nGoroka,  and  Lae),  and  others.  When  necessary,  particularly  in  the  enclaves  and  the \nsurrounding  communities,  the  Project  will  conduct  baseline  surveys  within  the  first  year  of \noperations.  The  social  marketing  not-for-profit  company  will  also  conduct  its  own  research  to \nestablish  baselines  and  subsequent  measures  throughout  the  project.  All  reports  will  be \nsubmitted  by  the  EA  to  CCM,  ADB,  AusAID,  NZAID,  and  other  key  development  partners \nthroughout  project  implementation;  these  reports  will  include  indicators  of  project  completion, \ndelivery, and benefits. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n96. \nCCM  will  include  the  Project  in  its  own  quarterly  reviews.  In  addition,  ADB  and  CCM \n(which  includes  Government  representation)  will  jointly  carry  out  project  supervisory  missions \nevery  6  months.  Before  each  visit,  a  progress  report  will  be  updated.  ADB  reviewers  will \nexamine  records  of  M&E  activities  and  meet  with  central  and  local  governments,  community \nleaders,  and  project  beneficiaries.  Two  years  after  the  Project  starts,  CCM  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive midterm review to (i) examine the scope, design, implementation arrangements, \nand other relevant issues in light of the Government\u2019s development of HIV/AIDS strategies and \npolicies;  (ii)  assess  the  Project's  progress  and  achievement  of  the  objectives;  (iii)  identify \nproblems  and  constraints;  and  (iv)  recommend  any  required  modifications,  restructuring,  and \nreallocations. The Government will issue invitations to ADB, AusAID, and NZAID to participate \nin this midterm review. \n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n97. \nProject  Benefits  and  Beneficiaries.  Improvements  in  labor  quality  and  productivity \nresulting  from  decreased  infectious  diseases  will  lead  to  accelerated  economic  growth.  The \nWHO  Commission  on  Macroeconomics  and  Health  2001  suggested  that  \u201c\u2026investments  in \nhealth  should  be  a  central  part  of  an  overall  development  and  poverty  reduction  strategy,\u201d  as \neach  10%  improvement  in  life  expectancy  at  birth  is  associated  with  an  increase  in  economic \ngrowth  of  at  least  0.3\u20130.4%  per  year.  Hence,  the  project  outcomes  should  be  better  general \nhealth  status,  reduced  poverty  because  of  higher  economic  growth,  and  progress  toward \nachieving the HIV/AIDS-related millennium development goal (see Appendix 11). \n \n98. \nThe  Project\u2019s  economic  benefits  will  come  from  (i)  public  and  private  savings  in  health \nexpenditures,  mainly  from  prevention  of  HIV  and  endemic  diseases  but  also  from  early \ntreatment of infections; (ii) productivity gains from an increased lifespan and reduced mortality; \nand  (iii)  productivity  gains  from  improved  education  achievements,  especially  through  less \nabsenteeism and reduced dropout rates.  \n\n\fThe Project aims to improve the health of the rural poor, focusing on primary health care \n99. \nand  community-based  HIV  prevention.  Low-income  people  are  more  likely  to  be  exposed  to \nhigher risks of HIV infection for several reasons, mainly because they enter into sex work more \noften than higher-income people, incur STIs that are often left untreated, are more exposed to \nreused  needles,  and  more  often  receive  transfusions  of  untested  blood.  HIV-positive  pregnant \nwomen  have  less  access  to  services  that  prevent  transmission  to  babies.  By  increasing  the \nmeans  available  for  reducing  the  risks  of  HIV  infection  among  the  highest-risk  groups,  the \nProject  will  increase  the  likelihood  that  low-income  people  will  reduce  their  own  risks  for \ninfection. While generally men, women, and children will benefit equally from greater access to \nhealth  care,  women  and  children  will  be  major  beneficiaries  of  these  expanded  services  in \nenclaves that employ mostly men and do not provide health services to their families. Female \nsex  workers  in  the  communities  will  be  a  major  target  for  behavior  change  programming,  and \nthey will receive greater access to STI treatment and condoms. Children will particularly benefit \nfrom  expanded  immunization  services  provided  by  either  the  enclave  clinics  or  the  restarted \npublic health facilities. Even if households are not poor before a member contracts HIV, loss of \nemployment and the high cost of treatment will push many deep into poverty. \n \n100.  Sustainability.  The  Project  has  been  designed \nfor \nsustainability  given  the  limited  time  of  the  grant  and  the  need  for  greater  Government \ncommitment to the HIV response. Should the efficiencies of the cost-sharing arrangements and \nthe assigned responsibilities under component 1 be respected, and the partnerships prove to be \nbeneficial  to  all  parties,  they  will  more  likely  be  sustainable.  The  partnerships  intend  to \n\u201cformalize\u201d this link between the Government and private sector at the community level, as they \nboth  have  mutually  reinforcing  interests  in  preventing  the  spread  of  HIV.  The  MOAs  between \nthem  will  be  structured  to  encourage  sustainable  cooperation  and  help  strengthen  the \ncommitment  of  each  party.  Under  component  2,  the  behavior  change  strategies  linked  to  the \npublic\u2013private partnerships will be reviewed in terms of reduction in morbidity and mortality. The \nevaluation of the strategies will inform decisions to continue and expand this intervention. \n \n101.  Other measures incorporated to enhance sustainability include the following:  \n \n\nthe  potential \n\nto  maximize \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAn  effective  social  marketing  of  condoms  program  will  be  required  for  the \nduration  of  the  epidemic  (under  component  2).  By  establishing  a  consortium  of \ndevelopment  partners  to  cofinance  and  support  an  independent,  professional \nnot-for-profit  company  to  establish  and  run  the  social  marketing  program,  this \nessential  HIV  prevention  intervention  becomes  a  collaborative  effort  and  less \ndependent on any single partner\u2019s decision to continue after 4 years or not. The \nrelative  levels  of  participation  by  Government  and  individual  development \npartners  may  change  over  time,  while  the  sustainability  of  the  program  is \nensured. \nThe  social  marketing  of  condoms  program,  supported  by  the  Government, \nAusAID, NZAID, and ADB, is an opportunity to work together on a unified public \nhealth intervention supporting concerted and coordinated action. The consortium \nand  cofinance  modalities  and  arrangements  should  be  examined  during  the  \nmidterm review to access their long-term  viability beyond the life of the Project. \nAll cofinanciers should participate in the eventual restructure exercise to ensure \nthe sustainability of the condom social marketing program and its transition to full \nGovernment ownership. \nStrengthening  and  expanding  systems  and  participating  sentinel  sites  comes \nunder  component  3.  The  long-term  sustainability  of  the  systems  will  require \ndeveloping  appropriately  trained  and  committed  NDOH  and  NRI  counterpart \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n\f 22 \n\n(iv) \n\nstaff.  While  the  initial  costs  to  establish  functioning  systems  are  borne  by  the \nProject,  the  long-term  supervisory  and  maintenance  costs  of  the  surveillance \nsystem are important and must be included in NDOH and NRI annual plans and \nrecurrent budgets. \nUnder  component  4,  the  project  coordinator,  procurement  specialist,  field \nsupervisor, and project accountant will work within the HSIP management branch \nwhere  they  will  endeavor  to  strengthen  the  skills  and  competencies  of \ngovernment  staff  through  association  and  participation  in  all  activities.  NDOH \nmanagement  will  be  similarly  associated  with  all  partnership  negotiations  and \narrangements  as  well  as  in  M&E.  The  competencies  developed  by  NDOH  will \nensure the establishment of new (post-project) public-private partnerships in the \nGovernment\u2019s continued comprehensive response to the HIV epidemic. \n\n \n102.  Social and Gender Analysis. Gender issues loom large in the HIV situation. The social \nand  economic  status  of  women  is  very  low,  and  poverty  motivates  many  women  to  sell  or \nexchange  sex  for  cash  and  other  goods  or  services.  The  epidemic  has  been  rather  evenly \ndivided among males and females from its inception, but recently infections among females of \nthe age group 15\u201325 have been rising disproportionately. The burden of caring for the sick and \nproviding  food  for  families  falls  heavily  on  women.  A  few  organizations  have  been  working  to \nimprove women\u2019s rights but little progress is evident.  \n \n103.  Environment. The Project is categorized as \u201cC\u201d and should not have significant adverse \nenvironmental effects. In general, the Project will finance preventive medical activities and rapid \nblood testing, which leave limited by-products. The Government also has regulations on medical \nwaste management. Project supervision will closely monitor the issue of medical wastes. \n \nB. \n\nRisks  \n\n104.  Health  Sector  Improvement  Program.  The  Project  will  strive  to  work  within  and \nstrengthen HSIP systems, but an alternative mechanism may be needed if the HSIP becomes \ndysfunctional. \n \n105.  Commitment  to  Health  Sector  Reform.  PNG\u2019s  health  system  over  the  past  several \nyears  has  become  less  and  less  able  to  provide  services,  especially  at  the  community  level, \nbecause  of  insufficient  supplies,  inadequate  supervision,  and  large  numbers  of  nonperforming \nhealth  staff  members  on  the  payroll.  Extensive  reform  of  the  health  system  is  necessary  but \nunlikely  to  occur  soon.  The  new  public\u2013private  partnership  approach  to  be  initiated  under  the \nProject  is  a  new  strategy  for  PNG  to  overcome  the  limitations  of  public  health  finance  and \nnonperforming  health  staff  members.  The  partnership  approach  must  have  full  Government \nbacking to ensure its success. \n \n106.  Limited  Absorptive  Capacity.  A  major  concern  is  the  Government\u2019s  absorptive \ncapacity  for  the  large  influx  of  funds  from  the  Global  Fund,  ongoing  AusAID  support,  and  the \nproposed  ADB  Asian  Development  Fund  grant.  The  amount  of  funds  to  be  dispersed  and  the \nnumber  of  program  and  project  activities  under  the  health  sector  could  pose  significant \nchallenges to the Government at all levels. \n \n107. \nIncreasing  Economic  Hardship.  A  worsening  economic  situation  will  drive  more \nwomen  into  transactional  sex  and  high-risk  behavior.  Behavioral  change  programming  in \ncommunities and for targeted groups such as sex workers is expected to be effective in altering \n\n\fhigh-risk  behavior.  Behavioral  change  will  be  reinforced  by  the  widespread  availability  of \ncondoms through the social marketing program. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecial Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government will give, or cause to be given, \n\n108. \ncertain assurances for inclusion in the Grant Agreement. Among these will be the following: \n \n\nAnnual  national  budgets.  The  Government,  through  the  Department  of \nTreasury  and  Department  of  National  Planning  and  Rural  Development  has \nensured/will  ensure  that  $3.9  million  (in  kina  equivalent),  including  its  own \ncounterpart funds, has appeared/will appear in the national budget for FY2006 as \nbeing allocated for the Project. The Government will take the required measures \nat the appropriate times to ensure that the Project\u2019s budget is taken into account \nin the Government\u2019s annual planning and budgeting process, and included in all \nnational budgets through to and including FY2010. \n\nHIV  surveillance  system  and  surveillance  personnel.  The  Government, \nthrough  NDOH,  will  support  and  maintain  at  least  the  same  number  of \nsurveillance  sites  and  surveillance  personnel  as  exist  at  the  completion  of  the \nProject for a minimum of 4 years after the Project\u2019s completion. \n\n \n(iii)  Waiver  of  import  duties  and  taxes.  The  Government,  through  the  Internal \nRevenue Commission, will ensure that all health hardware items (e.g., condoms \nand  personal  lubricants)  for  the  Project\u2019s  social  marketing  component  are \nimported  into  PNG  free  of  all  taxes  and  duties,  and  released  promptly  to  the \nconsulting company engaged by ADB to administer this subcomponent. \n\nRecurrent  budget  for  HIV/AIDS  prevention.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \nits recurrent allocation for HIV/AIDS prevention in its annual budget will increase \nby 20% year on year throughout the life of the Project. \n\nProject  steering  committee.  The  CCM  created  for  the  Global  Fund  will \nconstitute a steering committee for the Project. The Government will ensure that \nthe  CCM  will  at  regular  intervals  review  progress  and  guide  implementation \nunder the Project. \n\nHospital  referral  centers.  The  Government  will  roll  out  three  regional  referral \ncenters for STIs and HIV/AIDS at Mt. Hagen, Angau Memorial, and Nonga Base \nHospitals, in addition to Heduru Clinic at PMGH. \n\nLocal  health  facilities  and  the  private  sector.  The  Government  will  take  all \nsteps  to  ensure  the  smooth  and  timely  delivery  of  all  management  and \nsupervisory assistance pledged to local health facilities by economic operators in \nparticipating rural development enclaves pursuant to their respective MOAs with \nthe Government. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\n\f 24 \n\n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental considerations. The Government, through NDOH, will ensure that the \nrehabilitation and operation of all health facilities involved in the Project comply with all \napplicable laws and regulations of Papua New Guinea and ADB\u2019s environment policy.21  \n\nCondition for Grant Effectiveness \n\n109.  Grant effectiveness will be dependent upon ADB, AusAID, and NZAID reaching mutually \nsatisfactory  understandings  with  each  other  and  with  the  Government  with  regard  to  the \nnecessary  cofinancing.  The  execution  of  a  written  agreement  or  agreements  recording  the \nagreed arrangements will be a condition for the effectiveness of the Grant Agreement. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n110. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nthe grant not exceeding the equivalent of $15,000,000 to the Independent State \nof  Papua  New  Guinea,  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund,  for  the  HIV/AIDS \nPrevention and Control in Rural Development Enclaves Project, with terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nGrant Agreement presented to the Board; \n\nthe administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $3,500,000 \nto  the  Independent  State  of  Papua  New  Guinea  for  the  purpose  of  the  social \nmarketing  of  condoms  subcomponent  of  the  Project  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of Australia on a grant basis; and \n\nthe administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $3,500,000 \nto  the  Independent  State  of  Papua  New  Guinea  for  the  purpose  of  the  social \nmarketing  of  condoms  subcomponent  of  the  Project  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of New Zealand on a grant basis. \n\n(i)  \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n28 March 2006 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n                                                 \n21   ADB. 2002.

Moreover,  there  has  been  little  coordination  among  external  agencies.  The  Project \nstrives to achieve greater harmonization with other development partners\u2014AusAID and NZAID\u2014\nthrough a cofinanced, nationwide social marketing of condoms program, while also coordinating \nactivities and resource inputs from other major projects or programs such as the Global Fund and \nWHO\u2019s health staff training and protocol development for HIV testing and treatment. Efforts have \nbeen  made  to  bring  together  the  Project,  Global  Fund  (through  NDOH),  and  WHO\u2019s  respective \nactivities  at  the  participating  development  enclaves  to  ensure  efficient  use  of  resources  and \nharness comparative advantages (see model in Supplementary Appendix 3). \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nSOCIAL MARKETING OF CONDOMS FOR PAPUA NEW GUINEA  \n \n\nWhy Social Marketing? \n\n1. \nWith  a  rapidly  increasing  HIV  epidemic,  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  has  inadequately \ninvested  in  effective  modes  of  prevention.1  Despite  over  a  decade  of  HIV  control  activities, \nprevalence  continues  to  rise.  Transmission  through  unsafe  sex  is  the  primary  mode  in  PNG, \nindicating  a  great  need  of  increased  and  improved  condom  use.  In  spite  of  a  recent  effort  at \nsocial  marketing  for  both  condom  use  and  reduction  of  stigma,  condom  use  has  not  risen \nsignificantly  and  over  half  of  all  people  surveyed  in  follow-up  market  surveys  believe  HIV-\npositive  people  \u201cdeserve  what  they  get.\u201d  Churches  and  others  continue  to  resist  the  use  of \ncondoms; accredited voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) centers can be found that refuse to \npromote or give out condoms even to positive persons married to negative spouses. This lack of \nsupport  for  condom  promotion  is  evidence  of  the  positioning  of  ideology  over  evidence-based \nto  PNG  but  one  with  dangerous \npublic  health  strategies,  a  situation  not  restricted \nconsequences.  Active  education  of  stakeholders  and  the  populace  requires  a  major  effort  to \ncounter such negative influences. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nIn  a  rigorous  review  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention  strategies,  the  Cochrane  Collaboration,  a \nnonpartisan  international  organization  that  prepares  and  promotes  scientific  reviews  of  public \nhealth strategies, found that programs that included the distribution of male condoms for AIDS \nprevention were effective interventions in high-risk groups and the general population.2 \n \n3. \nThe concept of social marketing was invented by a public health expert in India over 30 \nyears ago and adapted by a person working for CARE in India. The first demonstration was with \nfamily planning commodities. It has evolved and grown, and now has several iterations. Social \nmarketing of one or more branded condoms, carried out by professionals, has had remarkable \nsuccess in many countries. Internationally successful social marketing companies work with the \nprivate sector and cooperate with government. \n \n4. \nThe  main  aim  is  to  make  a  health  product  attractive  and  commonly  used,  just  as  a \ncompany might do with toothpaste. The aim is not to scare people into using the product, nor is \nit to moralize about their behavior; it is very simply driven by the aim to sell the product, with the \nknowledge that doing so, in the case of condoms, means providing protection against HIV and \nSTIs for whole populations. For this reason, delivering condoms into every possible outlet in all \nurban and rural areas is extremely important as it helps to desensitize the product on a national \nbasis.  \n \n5. \nSocial  marketing  messages  or  packaging  are  not  determined  by  bureaucrats  or \nauthorities.  They  are  determined  by  the  consumer  through  research,  segmented  into  different \nmarkets, in order to follow the best practices of marketing in the private sector. These products \nare  for  sale  in  the  formal  and  informal  marketplace  and  have  to  compete  with  others  in  that \nmarket.  The  largest  social  marketing  companies  have  managed  to  be  successful  even  in \nCatholic  and  Islamic  countries  where  objections  have  been  loud  and  vocal.  The  best  social \nmarketing  companies  find  ways  to  manage  their  relationships  with  government  and  other \nstakeholders to enable the success of a product.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   A full version of this appendix is in the supplementary appendixes, which are available upon request. \n2   The Cochrane Collaborative Review Group on HIV Infection and AIDS. 2004.

In less at-risk groups, both partner reduction \nand condom use contribute to a significant reduction in risk.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nCondom use, in conjunction with the reduction of partners, has repeatedly been shown \nto have significant impact on generalized HIV epidemics. Various mechanisms have been tried \nfor the distribution and sale of condoms to increase use, and gradually key lessons learned from \naround the world and in PNG have been accumulated.  \n \n8. \nThe  purchase  of  condoms  at  low,  subsidized  prices  is  more  effective  and  more \nsustainable  than  free  distribution.  When  people  purchase  condoms  at  easily  accessible  and \nconvenient locations, their use is more likely than when they are distributed free. This has been \nshown in a national study in Cameroon that examined the issue and found that free condoms \nwere easier to access for those who never had tried condoms before, but socially marketed low-\nprice  condoms  were  preferred  by  all  others  and  was  associated  with  greater  actual  use.3  In \nPNG,  free  public  sector  condoms  are  often  not  distributed  at  all  and  sit  on  shelves  until  they \nexpire. \n \nFor  a  large  social  marketing  program  to  be  successful,  government  must  be  fully \n9. \ncommitted  and  supportive.  Greater  understanding  of  the  nonprofit  nature  of  this  type  of  effort \nmust  be  assured.  Funding  mechanisms  must  be  simplified  and  smooth,  with  no  chance  of \ndelays  that  will  interrupt  activities  or  supplies.  Condom  and  other  commodities  must  be \npurchased by the social marketing company in order to maintain control of supply and quality. \nAnd there must be long-term commitment. \n \n10. \nResistance to the promotion of condoms among village leaders and church spokesmen \nis widespread. The alternative they offer, abstinence, has not been shown to be a preferred or \nstatistically  effective  strategy.4  Also,  there  are  no  studies  or  other  evidence  to  support  the \nideologically  motivated  assertion  that  condoms  promote  promiscuity.  A  recent  review  of  the \nresearch in condom distribution, condom promotion, and sexual health education interventions \nand their effects on sexual behavior by Christian Aid, the official relief and development agency \nof 40 British and Irish church denominations, found ample evidence that these interventions do \n\u201cnot  hasten  sexual  debut  or  increase  the  number  of  sexual  partners\u201d  and  that  \u201cused  correctly, \ncondoms  are  effective  in  preventing  HIV  infection  among  young  people  who  are  sexually \nactive.\u201d5 \n \n11. \nAnother lesson learned is that social marketing programs that aim to recoup costs have \na  record  of  failure,  including  an  earlier  project  run  by  the  Futures  Group  in  PNG.  The  better \nprograms  depend  on  donor  subsidies  but  use  the  full  panoply  of  private  sector  marketing \ntechniques,  including  extensive  in-depth  research  repeated  throughout  the  entire  life  of  the \nproject. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  D.

First, when \n12. \nbegun  in  2000,  it  was  located  within  the  NACS  and  had  an  intermittent  consultant.  Message \ndevelopment  was  reportedly  highly  constrained  in  that  WHO  prescribed  what  should  be  the \nmain  message  (ABC:  abstinence,  be  faithful,  or  use  condoms)  rather  than  permitting  the \ndevelopment  of  messages  from  the  minds  and  voices  of  the  populace.  Abstinence  may  have \nhad  multilayered  meanings  to  the  WHO  or  the  consultant  (e.g.,  delay)  but  the  message  was \ntranslated into \u201dNo ken kuap,\u201d which in Pidgin simply means \u201cDon\u2019t have sex\u201d\u2014not a preferred \noption  in  any  study  of  responses  to  AIDS  education,  despite  numerous  countries\u2019  attempts  to \nuse this message.  \n \n13. \nUniversally, a  \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to communication about sexual behavior has \nbeen repeatedly shown to fail. The ABC message does not suit the vast majority of adults, tends \nto be sex-negative, only promotes condom use for those with multiple partners, and incorrectly \nleads people to believe that simply being faithful to one partner is protective. Other messages \nused  in  the  current  program  reinforce  the  often-heard  incorrect  notion  that  pamuk  pasin \n(promiscuity)\u2014as  opposed  to  unsafe  sex\u2014is  the  culprit  in  the  spread  of  HIV,  further \nstigmatizing and marginalizing those in greatest need of services. Overall, the messages used \ndo not reflect the real nature of sexual behavior in PNG and therefore have not \u201cstruck home.\u201d \n \n14. \nThe  current  campaign  in  PNG  has  been  largely  urban-biased  (as  has  been  the \nmonitoring) and has never directed any messages, visually or verbally, to the conditions of life in \nmost rural areas, where most HIV-infected people live. While sports stars were used in media \ncampaigns, their influence can hardly be considered national, in that TV media reaches a very \nsmall proportion of the country. \n \n15. \nAt least an equally great problem appears to be the availability of condoms where and \nwhen people need them. Distribution of the branded \u201cKaramap\u201d condom has been problematic. \nIt is difficult to find these condoms in stores in larger urban areas, such as Madang or Daru, let \nalone  in  rural  spots.  The  latest  survey  (March  2005)  from  the  NHASP-supported  social \nmarketing campaign found that 29% of people surveyed disagreed and 37% agreed they could \nfind condoms when they perceived they needed to. Even trained peer educators, trained under \neither  the  European  Union  Sexual  Health  or  the  NHASP  programs,  have  no  steady  supply  of \ncondoms to sell.  \n \n16. \n \n\nOther key lessons learned so far in PNG include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nPrices were not controlled, and at some places in Port Moresby the supposedly \nsubsidized condom pack was being sold for K2.  \nFrequently NGOs purchase condoms and then give them to retail outlets to give \nout free, as do provincial AIDS committees. Retailers complain that it makes no \nsense  for  people  to  purchase  condoms  if  the  same  branded  condom  is  widely \ndistributed  free.  Much  confusion  and  uncontrolled  pricing  as  well  as  the \npositioning  of  public  versus  private  sector  condoms  have  marred  this  recent \nsocial marketing effort. \nOther reasons for the lack of progress in condom acceptability and usage appear \nto be related to the frequently documented discordance between knowledge and \nbehavior as well as intention and behavior. \nThe  social  marketing  work  was  further  handicapped  by  directing  part  of  its \nresources  to  a  media  campaign  to  diminish  stigma.  Worldwide  this  has  never \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nworked  and  the  most  effective  means  has  been  shown  in  numerous  studies  to \ninvolve face-to-face contact with HIV-positive people.6  \n\nRestarting the effort \n\n \n17. \nIt  is  fair  to  say  that  an  inadequate  investment  in  highly  professional  social  marketing \nexpertise underlies the results of the program. Although the major components were similar to \nthat done elsewhere, the level of investment did not allow the intensity of high-quality research, \nor  the  number  of  personnel  needed  for  promotion,  sales,  and  distribution  that  might  have \ndirected decision making in a different way at an earlier date. It is also clear that prior research \non  the  same  topics  were  not  used  in  preparing  the  research  and  message  development \ncomponents.  \n \nC. \n \n18.  While  the  promotion  of  condom  use  may  not  be  the  only  valuable  behavioral  strategy, \nwithout a massive effort at getting condoms to the people where and when they need them at \nvery  low  prices,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  epidemic  can  be  contained.  It  is  proposed  that  a  large \ninvestment in social marketing is made so as to attract an internationally known social marketing \nagency. For several reasons, a major aim must be the promotion and distribution of condoms in \nrural areas: (i) nearly all major economic enclaves, sites of high risk, are in rural or even remote \nrural areas; (ii) studies conducted under the auspices of the WHO Global Programme on AIDS \nshowed little difference in levels of risk behavior among young people in rural and urban areas \nin PNG and elsewhere;7 and (iii) most people living with HIV/AIDS are in the rural areas. \n  \n19. \nSocial  marketing  is  a  very  culturally  sensitive,  consumer-oriented  enterprise.  Repeated \nsurveys  and  other  forms  of  research,  including  in-depth  qualitative  research  and  size \nestimations  of  at-risk  groups,  are  needed  to  understand  the  potential  consumers\u2019  beliefs  and \npreferences  in  detail  and  coverage  needs.  Advertising  can  include  but  not  be  dependent  on \nmass  media.  Events  can  be  staged, \nface-to-face \ncommunication methods through teams of communicators, mobile video units, boats on rivers or \nother  waterways,  outdoor  media,  cartoons,  clothing,  and  other  printed  media  are  the  more \ncommon modes of advertising. Many more can be invented as needed. \n \n20.  Monthly  marketing  statistics  must  also  be  retrieved  from  a  country-wide  monitoring \nsystem.  A  wide  variety  of  distribution  points,  both  traditional  (wholesalers,  pharmacies,  food \nstores, hotel shops) and nontraditional (guest houses, small kiosks, night clubs, bars, markets) \nare required for success. Many thousands of such distribution points will be required. Setting up \nsuch  a  distribution  system  requires  considerable  expertise  in  management  and  large  national \nand  local  teams.  Internal  social  marketing  within  high-risk  group  interventions  is  also  an \nexcellent method of distribution, with sex workers selling to other sex workers or clients in the \ncontext  of  targeted  outreach  programs.  Such  programs  often  have  drop-in  centers,  dedicated \nclinics and other services that attract persons who are selling sex, permit the development of a \nsense of solidarity, and promote norm change. Similar targeted programs for youth or men who \nhave  sex  with  men  are  also  included  within  the  range  of  market  sub-segments  in  large  social \nmarketing programs.  \n \n\ntheatrical  methods  used,  multiple \n\n                                                 \n6   Brown, L., K.

It is suggested that funds be secured on the order of $2 million\u2013$3 million per year \nfor 4 years, in the first instance, in order to make such a contract attractive to an internationally \nreputable company.  \n \n22. \nThe  strategies  of  social  marketing  companies  differ  as  do  their  levels  of  success.  For \nfruitful  HIV  investment,  it  is  important  to  hold  a  company  accountable  for  assuring  that  its \ncondoms are reaching the most at-risk people, as each sexual act covered by condoms among \npeople with a large number of multiple partners (about 15% of the population), has the greatest \nimpact  on  the  epidemic.  Therefore,  while  the  number  of  condoms  sold  is  a  valuable  indicator, \nother indicators are also required.  \n \nThe  monitoring  of  behavior  change  related  to  condom  use  requires  excellent  sampling \n23. \nas small changes may not be significant and one can only be certain there is success (or failure) \nbased  on  the  production  of  sound  90%  or  95%  confidence  intervals.  Obtaining  these  means \nevery  person  interviewed  in  a  survey  must  have  an  equal  chance  of  being  selected  as  every \nother person. If registration of selected sections of the population is needed for this, as is done \nfor the demographic and health surveys, then it is done for social marketing as well.  \n \n24. \nFairly large numbers of local persons are usually hired, trained and supervised as local \nteams for these activities. Sales teams are also hired, trained and supervised by geographical \narea. Therefore, funds for local staff on various levels must be nearly equal to that of expatriate \nstaff. \n \nThose companies that bid will describe their methods and should demonstrate their prior \n25. \nsuccess  rates  using  those  methods.  The  terms  of  reference  must  not  set  out  a  detailed  list  of \nactivities,  but  those  who  will  be  reading  these  bids  should  have  prior  experience  with  large \nsocial  marketing  investments.  Much  depends  upon  the  skills  and  knowledge  of  the  person \nselected as country director, and the TOR should specify that CVs of potential country directors \nare submitted for comment or even that candidates visit the country. Even very well-known and \nusually successful companies have poor programs if the wrong person is placed in-country. \n \nSocial marketing companies soon become a major part of the national response to HIV \n26. \nin all countries where their methods are sound and successful. They sit on the CCMs in most of \nAsia and Africa and take part in national strategic planning and other discussions involving all \nthe stakeholders.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nIMPROVING HIV SURVEILLANCE IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA \n \n\n1. \nIn  1998,  UNAIDS  and  others  revamped  the  classification  of  HIV  epidemics  and \nrecommended  surveillance  methods.  The  resulting  format  was  called  \u201csecond-generation \nsurveillance\u201d  and  included  behavioral  surveillance  as  well  as  markers  of  other  sexually \ntransmitted  diseases  in  addition  to  HIV.1  In  2004  another  meeting  was  held  to  review  more \nrecent  experiences  and  new  techniques  for  surveillance,  and  to  discuss  their  strengths  and \nweaknesses.2 For PNG, where surveillance has not been rationalized in relation to its epidemic, \nthe opportunity exists to update the methodology and develop skills in-country, which will enable \nPNG to collect the data needed to guide and develop prevention programs intelligently.  \n \n2. \nSurveillance worldwide has had a large impact by keeping the epidemic in the spotlight. \nImproving  surveillance  in  PNG  will  enable  better  formulation  of  policy,  improved  national \nestimates, more rational advocacy, guidance for programs on prevention and care, identification \nof research questions, delineation of marginalized groups, and the use of these data for broader \nmonitoring and evaluation purposes. The purpose of surveillance is to enable an effective public \nhealth  response  to  the  HIV  epidemic,  and  all  populations  under  surveillance  must  be  offered \neffective  prevention  and  care  programs.  Surveillance  must  combine  behavioral  data  on  the \nsame  groups  and  catchment  areas  in  which  HIV  sero-sampling  takes  place.  Recently,  linked \nbehavioral  and  serological  data  have  proved  acceptable  to  collect  (without  individual \nidentification)  among  youth,  antenatal  mothers,  and  other  groups.  An  increasing  number  of \nnational household surveys have been carried out as well. Some surveys have had high levels \nof refusals, but others have not. \n \nOver  the  past  decade,  PNG\u2019s  surveillance  has  depended  largely  on  the  passive \n3. \ncollection  of  samples,  often  unreported  or  very  tardily  reported  in  the  national  figures.  More \nrecently a lapsed attempt at sentinel surveillance has been revived with the annual collection of \nblood  samples  at  several  urban,  hospital-based  antenatal  clinics  (ANCs).  ANC  data  are  not, \nhowever, as representative as often implied. ANC data are inadequately adjusted for age, male-\nfemale ratios, and rural vs. urban prevalence differences. In some countries, the average ANC \nprevalence levels are close to those found in national household surveys. However, in PNG only \n40% of all HIV samples have ages recorded and approximately 60% of pregnant women never \nattend  a  clinic.  Under  these  conditions,  it  is  likely  that  the  difference  between  actual  national \nprevalence  and  urban  ANC  prevalence  will  differ.  Recent  experience  shows  that,  where  most \nnational  surveys  are  carried  out,  they  show  that  the  epidemic  is  not  as  generalized  as \nestimated. \n\n \n\n4. \nThese  findings  have  important  implications  for  the  allocation  of  resources.  While  there \nare  data  to  show  that  some  rural  areas  along  main  roads,  for  example  in  the  Asaro  Valley  of \nEastern  Highlands  in  PNG,  have  very  high  levels  of  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs) \namong  women,  other  community-level  studies  in  other  rural  areas  (e.g.,  Hawain  area  of  East \nSepik  Province)  do  not  exhibit  as  high  STI  levels.  No  surveillance  among  the  most  at-risk \ngroups  such  as  sex  workers  or  their  clients  has  begun.  Targeting  resources  where  they  will \nhave the most impact requires adequate data. PNG does not have adequate data on HIV/STI \nprevalence  or  risk  behaviors  among  urban  youth;  urban  or  rural  sex  workers;  or  documented \nclient  groups  such  as  government  workers,  police,  security  men,  miners,  or  loggers.

Addis Ababa. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n37 \n\nsentinel surveillance would cover these groups and use the surveillance as a way to monitor the \nimpact of targeted behavior change interventions.  \n \n5. \nPNG  has  not  yet  been  able  to  conduct  the  targeted  interventions  with  high-risk  people \nthat would provide venues through which sentinel surveillance could be achieved. This must be \ndeveloped  as  soon  as  possible.  For  the  next  several  years,  however,  reliance  on  ANC  and \nsexually  transmitted  disease  clinic  data  will  be  insufficient  to  estimate  with  accuracy  the \ndistribution and rates of infection throughout the country. A national survey, attached to a much \nneeded Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), is required at this time. PNG is greatly in need \nof characterizing its epidemic accurately. \n \n6. \nThe  principal  limiting  factor,  however,  is  capacity  to  plan  surveillance  systems,  collect \ndata,  use  data,  advocate  with  data,  and  to  design  and  implement  effective,  targeted  behavior \nchange  programs  for  the  people  the  data  reveal  need  them.  To  build  that  capacity,  long-term \ntechnical assistance by highly competent persons in serological and behavioral epidemiology is \nneeded.  Experience  in  other  countries  (e.g.,  Bangladesh)  has  demonstrated  that  a  well-\nconducted annual surveillance can be implemented and institutionalized in 2\u20133 years. A person \nwith advanced skills will be needed to consolidate and analyze all the collected data for many \nyears  to  come,  but  there  are  ways  to  train  such  persons  over  time.  Several  Papuan  New \nGuineans with backgrounds in social science and epidemiology should be selected to learn all \nthe  skills  needed  to  carry  out  surveillance  and,  ideally,  their  institutions  should  maintain  their \nposts into the future. \n \n7. \nA  recent  DHS+  in  Cameroon  revealed  that  levels  of  HIV  were  twice  as  high  among \neducated  than  uneducated  women  and  men,  a  finding  that  may  be  counter-intuitive  to  some \nobservers. In South Africa, HIV surveillance among youth showed 60% of those saying they had \nno  risk  of  HIV  were  already  infected.  PNG  is  a  complex  nation,  and  its  epidemic,  if  well \ndescribed,  is  likely  to  be  complex  in  its  distribution,  intensity,  and  nature  as  well.

Although most of the poor live in rural \nareas, urban poverty has worsened because of growing rural\u2013to-urban migration, which, in turn, was prompted by the \npoor  delivery  of  basic  social  services  and  rising  unemployment  of  school  leavers  in  rural  areas.  The  principal \nchallenges for poverty reduction in PNG are the restoration of economic growth and the continued provision of basic \nservices. These are in line with the priorities of the poor identified during the participatory assessment of hardship in \n2001: access to jobs and income opportunities as well as improved service delivery and infrastructure.  \n \nOver 30% of the population live in poverty, and government capacity to provide basic services is under great strain. \nEconomic and social infrastructure is in disrepair, particularly for rural residents, denying them access to basic social \nand  economic  services.  The  national  and  provincial  governments  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  primary  health \ncare and other services, and the provincial system is being reformed to address this problem of service delivery. This \nhas  left  the  burden  of  rural  health  service  provision  largely  to  the  churches,  with  limited  but  regular  funding  from \ngovernment.  Increasing  unemployment  and  the  stark  absence  of  economic  opportunities  contribute  to  urban \nmigration, squatter communities, and high levels of crime.  \n \nAccess  to  basic  social  services  is  poor.  Health  service  is  declining  at  all  levels  of  delivery,  as  is  basic  service \ninfrastructure, particularly health aid posts. Disease control is inadequate, with low immunization coverage, increasing \nnumbers of tuberculosis patients, and increasing HIV prevalence estimated at 1.6% among the 15\u201349 age group. The \nHIV/AIDS epidemic continues to grow  unabated,  with prevalence  estimated  at up to 4% in urban  areas, and 1% in \nrural areas. The response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic has thus far been weak and ineffective, and unless the spread is \ncontrolled, economic growth and the fight against poverty will suffer.  \n \nAfter  steadily  improving  in  the  1980s,  people\u2019s  health  has  deteriorated  overall  since  the  1990s  mainly  because  the \nhealth  system,  especially  in  rural  areas  and  at  the  district  level,  is  dysfunctional.  A  2001  review  found  rural  health \nservices to be in a state of \u201cslow breakdown and collapse\u201d.1 Hundreds of rural health facilities are either closed or not \nfully  functioning.  District  health  services  are  equally  poor,  with  health  centers  shut  down  or  delivering  extremely \nlimited services at best. District health facilities face extensive problems: low capacities of health staff, limited training, \na lack of supervision and support, inadequate equipment and supplies, and insufficient financial resources. \n \nThe Project will help strengthen government leadership and implement strategies to contain the spread of HIV among \nrural  populations.  The  Project  will  extend  support  for  a  government  leadership  role  to  establish  public-private \npartnerships  with  rural  development  enclaves  focused  on  improving  and  extending  health  services  to  surrounding \ncommunities.  The  Project  will  develop  local  civil  society  organizations\u2019  competency  to  work  directly  with  affected \ncommunities to address issues related to the epidemic. A national surveillance system covering all provinces will be \nestablished, and home-based care mechanisms as well as a condom social marketing program developed. By 2015, \nthe Project will have helped PNG control and by 2020 stabilize the spread of HIV/AIDS. Support of the health sector \nand the increasingly organized fight against HIV/AIDS are integral to the strategy to strengthen the delivery of basic \nservices, especially to the rural poor.  \n \nAchieving  PNG\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy  goal  for  controlling  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  will  require \nincreased and sustained public investment in education and health. Levels of social indicators remain extremely poor, \nespecially for women. Low life expectancy, high infant mortality, poor adult literacy, and low enrolment at all levels of \neducation combine with low per capita income to make PNG\u2019s human development level the lowest of ADB\u2019s Pacific \nmember countries. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  World Health Organization. 2004.

Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nSocioeconomic conditions in  PNG place its  people in  a vulnerable state and pose challenges to the  government in \nmeeting its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. On a global scale, PNG ranks in the lowest one third \nof  all  nations,  and  lowest  among  its  Pacific  neighbors,  on  the  human  development  index2.  The  country  has  a  high \nfertility rate (4.8%) and a young population, with 42.0% under the age of 15. The infant mortality rate (82/1,000 live \nbirths) and maternal mortality rate are among the highest in the world. Literacy is also very low, with only around 25% \nof the population functionally literate (footnote 2).   Around 85% of the population live in rural areas. The generally low \nstatus of women and the special health risk they face, as well as sexual violence, places them at a higher risk of HIV \ninfection. \n \nAn  estimated  40%  of  the  population  now  lives  on  less  than  $1  a  day,  up  from  25%  in  1996.3  Prospects  for  formal \nemployment  are  minimal,  and  it  has  risen  by  only  1.5%  since  1996.  The  complex  land  tenure  system  and  the  low \nprospects for land reform offer few alternatives in the informal sector. Rising poverty is linked to high levels of crime \nand violence. General development continues to be hampered by the poor nationwide peace-and-order situation. The \nhighlands remain unstable, and security in urban areas appears to have worsened. In response, the Government has \nproduced a national poverty reduction strategy, which has been used in the formulation of the Government\u2019s Medium-\nTerm Development Strategy (MTDS), which has a strong poverty focus.  \n \nIndicators  for  the  health-related  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  between  1990  and  present  demonstrate \nmixed results. Poverty has not been reduced over the past 10 years, and the national target for reduction between \n1996  (baseline  year)  and  2015  is  a  modest  3%  instead  of  the  MDG  target  of  50%.  The  HIV  prevalence  rates  in \npregnant  women  and  the  general  adult  population  have  been  growing  at  a  considerable  pace  since  HIV/AIDS  was \nfirst  discovered  in  PNG  and  show  no  signs  of  slowing  down.  The  figure  of  infants  with  low  birth  weight  from  1998-\n2003 was 11% of all births, and 35% of children under 5 were reportedly moderately or severely underweight in 1995-\n2003.4 \n \nCommunicable diseases are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in PNG, and they account for approximately \n50%  of the country\u2019s mortality.5 The leading  diseases  have been  pneumonia, hepatitis,  malaria, diarrheal  diseases, \ntuberculosis, and meningitis. Malaria and pneumonia combined account for one-third of all recorded deaths (footnote \n5)  However, HIV/AIDS is also one of the leading causes of hospitalization (and subsequently deaths), accounting for \n60% of bed occupancy at Port Moresby General Hospital. \n \nSocioeconomic  realities,  behaviors  molded  by  cultural  and  sexual  practices,  and  the  gender  dimensions  of  the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic in PNG present ideal conditions for the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted \ninfections  (STIs).  This  is  already  evident  with  the  exponential  growth  of  the  epidemic  over  the  last  15  years.  All \nsectors of society need to work together by taking positive steps in addressing the epidemic in the next 5\u201310 years.  \n \nThe goal of the grant is to assist the Government in its fight against HIV/AIDS and its effort to meet the MTDS target \nfor  HIV/AIDS  control.  The  grant  will  help  the  Government  take  the  fight  against  HIV/AIDS  to  the  rural  population \nsurrounding development enclave sites. Many of PNG's economic sectors typically comprise discreet rural enclaves \nwhich  generate  local  employment  and  a  cash  economy  in  stark  contrast  to  surrounding  populations  which  rely  on \nsubsistence  farming.  These  development  enclaves  foster  the  exchange  of  goods  and  cash  for  sex  among  the \nperipheral  populations.  High-risk  sex  behavior  is  characteristically  associated  with  the  surrounding  populations  of \nrural enclave development sites. \n \nThe  poverty  analysis  will  help  ensure  that  the  investments  proportionally  benefit  the  poor  and  disadvantaged.  The \nProject reduces vulnerability risks of the poor and disadvantaged from becoming further marginalized. The analysis \nshould  also  include  a  needs  assessment  that  identifies  (i)  the  existing  burden  of  disease  of  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  groups,  (ii)  possible  strategies  to  optimize  their  use  of  services,  and  (iii)  the  current  capacity  of  the \nhealth system to effectively address their health needs. The analysis should also examine partnership arrangements \nto enhance the sustainability of the regional delivery of basic health services. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2 UNDP. 2004.

Participation Process \n\n No \n\n No  \n\n Yes \n\n Yes  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  to  identify  key  project  stakeholders,  their  project-related  interests,  and  the \nways  in  which  they  affect  or  complement  project  feasibility  and  success.  The  Project  design  also  linked  with  the \nmechanisms  used  for  the  Global  Fund,  which  released  the  first  tranche  for  HIV/AIDS  in  August  2005.  ADB  was \nrecently  included  as  a  member  of  the  Global  Fund  Country  Consultative  Mechanism  (CCM).  Primary  institutional \nstakeholders  include  the  National  Department  of  Health,  the  National  AIDS  Council,  the  Special  Parliamentary \nCommittee  on  HIV/AIDS  Advocacy,  churches,  NGOs,  private  sector,  and  business  associations  involved  in  fighting \nHIV/AIDS. Other institutional stakeholders are the various development partners, such as AusAID, New Zealand AID, \nUNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, and World Health Organization. Primary non-institutional stakeholders include the \npoor, children, other vulnerable groups, and sex workers and their clients. The preparation of the Project involved an \nanalysis of the community-based organizations involved in HIV/AIDS prevention and care, and the establishment of \nlinkages with these organizations to ensure comprehensive community programs. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nA  participation  strategy  is  integrated  into  the  overall  project  design.  The  Project  entails  various  types  of  formal \npartnerships  to  ensure  widespread  participation.  Several  partnership  agreements  will  be  signed  between  the \nGovernment and participating development enclave operators for primary health care and HIV/AIDS prevention and \ncare.  There  will  also  be  a  formal  agreement  among  the  development  partners  for  pooling  funds  for  the  social \nmarketing of condoms. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \nThe  Project  will  deal  with  these  issues  directly  as  part  of  the  enclave-oriented  design.  First,  an  assessment  will  be \nmade to understand how women in the workplace, as well as those in settlements (in-migrants) and the surrounding \nvillages  are  affected  by  the  HIV  epidemic.  Second,  specific  activities  will  be  developed  to  work  with  the  economic \noperators,  families,  men,  and  women  to  reduce  the  differential  impact  on  women  and  girls.  The  behavioral  change \nstrategies in the communities and in peer groups (e.g., sex workers) will benefit women and reduce their exposure to \nHIV  by  reducing  high-risk  behavior  among  women  and  their  male  partners.  Promoting  condom  use  and  making \ncondoms available in rural areas will further protect women from the risk of HIV. The Project will provide women with \nSTI  treatment.  Greater  accessibility  to  STI  treatment  and  drugs  is  an  important  aspect  in  HIV  prevention.  Men \nemployed in the development enclaves are normally provided access to health services from the operator\u2019s clinic, but \ntheir family members are not always included. By expanding the private operators\u2019 health services to more people in \nthe  community  and  rehabilitating  nonoperational  public  health  clinics  in  rural  areas,  far  more  women  will  receive \nprimary health care, STI treatment, and HIV care. \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nPNG is a diverse nation with many different cultures, languages, traditions, and sexual practices that expose women \ndifferentially to the risk of HIV infection. In many cultures, women form an underclass, with reduced access to food, \ncash,  and  other  resources.  Women\u2019s  representation  at  all  levels  of  the  economy  and  Government  is  limited.  The \nchurches have played a significant role in social change, reaching the remotest rural areas and providing almost 50% \nof  health  and  educational  services,  but  they  usually  encourage  male  dominance  as  a  Christian  value.  Levels  of \ndomestic and sexual violence are high, with few services to address the needs of affected women. \n \nWhile almost equal numbers of men and women are reported to have HIV in PNG, women are increasingly infected \nat  a  younger  age.  Women  are  disadvantaged  by  greater  levels  of  illiteracy  and  lack  of  access  to  cash  incomes. \nBecause  of  the  difficulties  of  economic  survival,  many  women  trade  sex  for  money  or  other  goods.  In  some \ncircumstances,  sexual  transactions  are  brokered  by  male  relatives,  in  traditional  fashion,  although  more  organized \nAsian-style prostitution has begun to be seen.  \n \nIn rural areas, some women walk many hours to reach a government center where men with paychecks may pay for \nsex, in order to purchase used clothes for their children or pay school fees. Rural poverty in many areas is extreme \nand  drives  many  women  to  migrate  into  cities  or  settle  near  economic  enclaves.  Sex  workers  are  stigmatized  and \ntheir  social  capital  is  reduced  with  families  and  communities.  When  these  women  develop  AIDS,  they  are  often \nabandoned by their families. Many other women are faithful wives but acquire infections from unfaithful husbands, yet \nit is they who are shut out from family support. In some cases, these women have been burned, neglected, and killed. \nIn Port Moresby, their children are abandoned at the hospital in increasingly large numbers. Catholic and a few other \nfaith-based  agencies  are  working  to  reduce  this  impact  at  the  village  level,  but  their  services  only  reach  a  small \nproportion  of  those  in  need.  Although  a  national  media  campaign  tries  to  reduce  the  stigma  associated  with \nHIV/AIDS, it has little impact, particularly in rural areas.  \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\nE.
