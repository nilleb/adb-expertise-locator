The \ncommunities will provide $12,000 through participation and in-kind contributions. At the time of \nthe grant approval, the total estimated project cost was $820,500. The grant became effective \non 19 January 2010 and is expected to be completed by 19 January 2014. \n \nThe  project  has  experienced  cost  overruns  and  additional  financing  is  needed.  An \n2. \nadditional  $195,894 2  cofinancing  grant  from  the  Department  for  International  Development \n(DFID) of the United Kingdom is available. Approval of the ADB Board of Directors is sought on \na  no-objection  basis  for  ADB  to  administer  the  grant  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Operation \nManual (section H.5: Additional Financing).3  The additional financing will not entail a change in \nthe project scope and implementation. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\n \n3. \nPoverty in Nepal is characterized by the exclusion of poor and vulnerable groups\u2014such \nas low castes, ethnic groups, and women\u2014from access to resources and opportunities. Nepal\u2019s \nTenth  Plan  (FY2003\u2013FY2007)4 and  the  following  3-year  interim  development  plan  (FY2008\u2013\nFY2010) 5  recognize  that  overcoming  low  levels  of  human  development  requires  ensuring \ndevelopment addresses the needs of women, the very poor, and deprived communities, castes, \nand regions. \n \nThe high incidence of crimes against women and children, including domestic and other \n4. \nviolence, exacerbates the difficulties these groups face in participating in development. Violence \nagainst  women  and  children  is  unacceptable  from  a  social  justice  standpoint,  and  has  an \nassociated economic cost, as both women and their dependent children experience (i) reduced \n(a)  productivity,  (b)  participation  in  community  and  development  activities,  (c)  control  over \nresources,  and  (d)  self-confidence;  and  (ii)  increased  (a)  homelessness  and  helplessness,  (b) \ndemand  for  medical  and  community  support  services,  and  (c)  expenditures  on  police  and \njudicial services. In addition, child abuse, early child labor, and child marriage prevent affected \nchildren  from  participating  in  education,  thereby  decreasing  their  chance  of  later  elevating \nthemselves out of poverty. \n \n5. \nThe central WCSC was established in 1996 at police headquarters and a district WCSC \nwas  established  in  Kathmandu  with  the  main  task  of  investigating  crimes  against  women  and \nchildren, in close cooperation with various government agencies, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs),  and  civil  society.  The  central  WCSC  is  under  the  direct  command  of  the  crime \ninvestigation department of the Nepal Police. Its objective is to create a conducive environment \nin  which  women  and  child  victims  of  crimes  feel  safe  in  filing  complaints  against  offenders.  It \nformulates policy and programs for all service centers. Prior to the establishment of WCSCs, the \nvictims of such crimes were reluctant to lodge their complaints against offenders, in particular to \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2009.

Nepal: Three-Year Interim Plan (FY2008\u2013FY2010). \n\n\f2 \n\nmale  investigating  officers,  because  of  privacy  and  sensitivity  issues  and  the  risk  of  further \nverbal  and/or  physical  attacks.  This  situation  highlighted  the  need  for  a  special  investigative \nteam composed of female police officers. \n \nTo date, there are 27 WCSCs, mostly in Kathmandu Valley and in border districts, where \n6. \nthe focus is on trafficking. Major issues faced by the existing central and district WCSCs are the \nlack  of  (i)  recognition  of  their  status  as  an  independent  department  within  the  police;  (ii) \nseparate  allocation  of  a  budget  and  human  resources;  (iii)  systematic  staff  training  to  help \nWCSCs  assist  women  and  child  victims  of  highly  sensitive  crimes;  (iv)  systematic, \ninstitutionalized  coordination  with  NGOs,  communities,  and  civil  society,  and  of  a  clear \nunderstanding  by  all  stakeholders  of  the  different  roles  and  responsibilities  of  police  and  civil \nsociety;  and  (v)  awareness  by  the  public  at  large  of  their  existence  and  role.  The  project  is \nintended to address these issues and establish new WCSCs. \n \n7. \nThe  goal  of  the  project  is  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  and  helplessness  of  women  and \nchildren  in  five  districts  of  Nepal  through  the  provision  of  professional  and  coordinated \nprotection  and  assistance  to  women  and  children  who  are  victims  of  rape,  domestic  violence, \npolygamy, alleged witchcraft, child abuse, child marriage, and trafficking. This will increase their \nchances of reintegration into mainstream society and thus their participation in the development \nprocess, leading eventually to poverty reduction.  \n \n8. \nThe  project  is  under  implementation  through  its  five  components:  (i)  civil  society \nconsultation prior to establishing WCSCs, (ii) establishment of five WCSCs in rural districts and \none  for  central  Kathmandu,  (iii)  capacity  development,  (iv)  outreach  and  networking,  and  (v) \nproject  management.  The  Nepal  Police  Headquarters  is  the  executing  agency  and  its  central \nWCSC is the implementing agency, together with district-level WCSCs.  \n \n9. \nA  minor  change  was  approved  on  19  October  2010  reducing  the  target  districts  from \nseven to five.6 Four out of five were replacements based on changes in need as evidenced by \nreported  crime  incidence  since  the  project  was  designed.  All  remain  within  the  original  project \narea  which  represents  the  poorest  and  most  disadvantaged  areas  of  Nepal  where  gender \ndiscrimination is pervasive. The change in districts did not change the project\u2019s objective, scope, \nimplementation and benefits. \n \n10. \nAll  procurement  under  the  project  is  being  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). International project consultants \nwill  be  recruited  by  the  executing  agency  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Local NGOs and consultants are contracted \nby  the  grant  implementation  unit  (GIU)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Grant  funds  are  being  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government  is  maintaining  separate \naccounts  and  records  for  the  project  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  the \nFinancial Management Guidelines of ADB7. \n \n\nIII. \n\nPROJECT PERFORMANCE  \n\n11. \nDuring  the  inception  mission  in  March  2010,  it  was  found  that  the  funding  for  the  civil \nworks  under  this  project  was  insufficient  to  cover  the  construction  costs  for  all  of  six WCSCs.  \nThe  current  fund  allocation  would  allow  completion  of  only  three  out  of  the  six  WCSCs  to  be \n\n                                                 \n6  Districts are Bara, Dhanusha, Doti (retained), Jumla, and Rautahat. \n7  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nconstructed.  The staff assessment of this cost overrun was that (i) 51%8 was due to an initial \ncost  estimate  found  to  be  based  on  an  inappropriate  model;  (ii)  39%9 was  due  to  significant \nincrease in costs of materials, transportation, and labor during the 6 years lapsed between the \nproject design and implementation and (iii) the Nepalese rupee has appreciated against the US \ndollar during this period.10 \n \n12. \nAfter a slow start-up and despite the cost overrun, the pace of implementation started to \naccelerate when the project coordinator and management consultant joined the GIU in October \n2010  to  assist  in  project  coordination  and  monitoring.  The  project  is  performing  well  with \nphysical  progress  as  of  February  2011  at  12%  against  the  elapsed  period  of  36%.  Major \nperformance aspects are summarized below: \n\n(i) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nlaunching  an  advance  public \n\n  The JFPR progress report (Appendix 3) rated the project not at risk and on track \nto meet its output targets with major activities including: (a) establishing the GIU \nand  the  national  project  advisory  committee  in  2010;  (b)  holding  consultation \nworkshops  in  Bara,  Doti,  Jumla,  and  Rautahat  before  establishment  of  the \nWCSCs;  (c) \ninformation  campaign\u2014using \nawareness-raising  radio  dramas,  short  films,  information  posters,  and  a  video \ndocumentary\u2014in  the  project  districts  to  sensitize  people  about  the  objectives  of \nestablishing  the  WCSC  and  its  services;  (d)  forwarding  expressions  of  interest \nand  short-listed  organizations  for  the  recruitment  for  the  baseline  survey  on \nviolence  against  women  and  children  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval;  and  (e) \napproving  bidding  documents  for  the  construction  of  the  WCSCs  in  Bara,  Doti, \nand Rautahat. \n\n(ii) \n\n  Contract  awards  totaled  $72,000  (9.6%)  and  disbursement  $66,000  (8%).  The \n\ndisbursement represents the initial advance to the imprest account. \n\n  The project has not encountered any safeguard issues. \n  The  executing  agency  has  reiterated  its  commitment  to  managing  risk  by \nagreeing  to  (a)  have  strict  financial  controls  including  annual  external  audits  of \nthe  project  accounts;  (b)  have  special  arrangements  regarding  the  use  of \nequipment  (which  is  intended  only  for  the  WCSCs),  and  have  the  executing \nagency  replace  it  in  case  of  disappearance;  (c)  assign  women  recruits  to  the \nWCSCs who have special training in crimes against women and children; (d) not \ntransfer  trained  staff  for  at  least  3  years;  and  (e)  facilitate  the  assignment  of \nwomen staff who can communicate in local languages.  \n\nThe  project  will  deliver  significant  economic  and  social  benefits  to  the  women  and \n\n \n13. \nchildren of Nepal, especially those who are poor and disadvantaged.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED CHANGES \n\nADB approached DFID for additional financing to make up for the shortfall in the cost of \n14. \nconstruction of the WCSCs. DFID responded by committing $195,894 in cofinancing, which will \nsupport completion of the remaining three WCSCs. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  The cost was taken from a community building at village level from the ADB (2004) L2143:-NEP Gender Equality \nand Empowerment of Women project (Manila). That building was considerably smaller, built using local materials \n(e.g., mud), and had no provision for utilities. This original design-cost error accounts for 51% of the cost overrun. \nThe budget also had no provision for escalation since all construction was expected to take place in Year 1. \n\n9   ADB.  Jan  2011.  Domestic  Cost  Escalation  Factors,  2010-2014  (percent).  Manila.  Average  inflation  in  Nepal \nbetween FY2000 and FY2010 was 5.7%.  Implementation was delayed by 6 years due to heavy insurrection in the \nproject areas during this period.  \n\n10 Exchange rate in April 2004 was 1 USD = NRs 73 vs. exchange rate in March 2011 of 1 USD, = NRs 71.6 which \n\naccounts for 2% of the cost overrun. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nArrangements for implementation and monitoring and evaluation will remain the same as \n15. \nin  the  original  design.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  The  project \nimplementation  period  will  remain  at  4  years,  with  no  change  in  the  implementation  schedule. \nRegarding  public  relations  and  financing  acknowledgement,  of  the  six  WCSCs  to  be \nconstructed, three will have the JFPR logo exclusively, and three will have both the JFPR and \nDFID  logos.  JFPR  will  still  finance  the  project  management  cost,  and  all  communication  will \nmention JFPR before DFID. \n \nThe  additional  $195,894  contribution  from  DFID  will  increase  the  overall  project  cost \n16. \nfrom  $820,500  to  $1,016,394.  The  rest  of  the  funding  allocation  will  remain  unchanged.  The \nrevised cost tables by component and fund sources are in Appendix 2.

The additional financing of \n$195,894 will be used to meet the cost overrun to be incurred above the project cost estimate \nas  originally  approved  by  the  President  and  enable  the  project  to  deliver  its  benefits  and \ndevelopment objectives.  \n \n\nVI.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n\n18. \nThe President recommends that the Board approve the administration by ADB of a grant \nnot  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $195,894  as  additional  financing  to  Nepal  for  Establishing \nWomen  and  Children  Service  Centers,  to  be  provided  by  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom. \n \n19. \nas needed to reflect the changes where appropriate. \n \n\nIf the Board approves the recommended changes, the grant agreement will be amended \n\n \n\n\fREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets and/or \nIndicators with Baselines \n\nImpact  \nReduced vulnerability and \nhelplessness of women and \nchildren in fivea rural districts \nof Nepal as victims of crimes \nsuch as rape, domestic \nviolence, polygamy, \nallegations of witchcrafts, child \nabuse, child marriage, and \ntrafficking. \n\n \nThe number of convictions for \nreported crimes against women \nand children in the target districts \nincreased by 30% (from 2009 \nbaseline). \n \nThe number of crimes against \nwomen and children decreased \nby 20% by the end of the project \n(from 2009 baseline). \n \n50% of the women and children \nvictims that report crimes are \nreintegrated into the community. \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nPolice statistics at \nnational level \n \nPolice books and district \npolice court reports \n \nDuty books and police \njournals of WCSCs staff \n \nADB evaluation study \n \nEvaluation and research \nreports from donors \n(e.g., World Bank and \nDFID) on social \ninclusion \n\nOutcome \nImproved access by Nepalese \nwomen and children in five \nrural districts of Nepal to \nprofessional and coordinated \nprotection from and assistance \nwith crimes committed against \nthem \n\n \nPolice crime reports at \ndistrict level \n \nPublic opinion surveys \n \nVictim surveys \n \nProgress reports from \nthe executing agency \n \nReports from ADB TA \nreview missions \n\n \nIncrease of 30% in the number of \nreported crimes against women \nand children in the first 2 years of \nimplementation (from 2009 \nbaseline). \n \n50% increase in confidence in \nWCSCs and supporting agencies \nby the end of the project. \n \nAt least 60% of crimes against \nwomen and children reported in \nthe last 2 years of the project are \nsatisfactorily handled by WCSCs \nand the supporting agencies. \n \nBy the end of the project, the \nnumber of reported crimes \nagainst women and children that \nare prosecuted has increased by \n50%. \n\nOutputs \n1.
