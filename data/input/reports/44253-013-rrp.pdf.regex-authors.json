THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Local Government Finance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform \nProgram,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  policy-based  loan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for \nsubprogram 1 of the Local Government Finance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform Program.1  \n \n2.  The  program  aims  to  improve  service  delivery  in  the  Philippines  by  assisting  the \ndevelopment of efficient and transparent local governments within an adequate and equitable \nfiscal framework. In close alignment with the government\u2019s reforms, the program assists efforts \ntoward improved efficiency of public expenditure, enhanced accountability of local government \nadministration, and the creation of a fiscal framework conducive to job creation.2  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Efficient service delivery for inclusive growth. The Philippine Development Plan, \n2011\u20132016 identifies specific challenges for local government units (LGUs) in the achievement \nof  its  main  goals:  promoting  inclusive  growth  and  generating  employment,  improving \ngovernance  and  human  development  standards,  and  achieving  macroeconomic  and  fiscal \nsustainability.3  Reducing  local  disparities  in  access  to  services  is  critical  to  achieving  the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of inclusive growth and poverty reduction. The poverty incidence was 27.9% \nin 2012 (a decrease from 28.6% in 2009), which is above the prevailing rates in neighboring \ncountries  in  Southeast  Asia.4  Although  recent  high  economic  growth  (6.8%  in  2012)  is \nencouraging,  earlier  growth  spurts  in  the  Philippines  have  not  been  effective  in  reducing \npoverty. Geographically, the poor remain concentrated in the southern Philippines and in rural \nareas. The poverty incidence in the Visayas and Mindanao regions is double that in Luzon, and \ntwo-thirds of the poor live in rural areas. Provincial poverty disparities are even larger, with \nseveral provinces in Eastern Visayas and Mindanao reporting rates of over 40%, while poverty \nincidence in several southern Luzon provinces remains below 10%. Similar disparities are found \nin terms of access to services. The average infant mortality rates in 2008 in the Eastern Visayas \n(45 deaths per 1,000 births) and Cagayan Valley (38 per 1,000) were more than 50% above the \nnational average. In 2009, six regions of the country reported that less than 80% of their \npopulation had access to electricity, compared to almost 99% in the national capital region; and \nless than 70% of the population of Central Visayas and Zamboanga had access to potable \nwater in 2009, compared to some 97% in Central Luzon. \n \n4.   Inadequate and inequitable distribution of financial resources. Flaws in the design \nof the revenue base of LGUs are partly responsible for the geographical disparities observed in \naccess to services. Following the first drive of decentralization after the approval of the Local \nGovernment Code 1991 (LGC), subnational government expenditures have remained stable. \nBetween 2001 and 2011, subnational expenditure (including provinces, cities, municipalities, \nand barangays) stayed at about 4% of gross domestic product, and represented some 17% of \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian Development Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance for  Local  Government    \n     Finance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform Program (TA 8390). \n3  Government of the Philippines, National Economic Development Authority. 2011. Philippine Development Plan \n2011\u20132016. Manila. \n4  Report from the National Statistical Coordination Board. 2012. (http://www.nscb.gov.ph/pressreleases/2013/PR- \n201304-NS1-04_poverty.asp)  \n ", "2 \ntotal public expenditure in 2011 (25% if debt amortization is excluded). The composition of LGU \nexpenditures shows a worrisome declining trend in terms of the allocations made to health, \neducation, and other basic services between 2001 and 2011. Against this background, LGUs \ncollected an average of 24% of their operating income from their own revenue sources between \n2008 and 2011 (the remaining income derived from transfers and revenue sharing). The share \nof local tax and non-tax as a proportion of LGU revenues is stagnating because of outdated and \nunproductive tax and non-tax instruments, as well as limited tax efforts from local governments. \nAs  expected,  large  differences  exist  in  revenue  collection  capacity,  with  the  top  province \ncollecting more than four times the national average from its own revenue sources in 2011.  \n \n5.   Incomplete system of transfers to local government units. The increasingly complex \ndistribution of service delivery responsibilities across levels of government in the Philippines has \nnot been matched by a system of transfers that assists the equitable and efficient distribution of \nfinancial resources. The internal revenue allotment (IRA) has limited fiscal equalization power, \nresulting in very significant disparities in LGU expenditures per capita. The implementation of \nperformance-based transfers that encourages LGU governance and efficiency upgrades has \nlagged behind, and the coordination between central and local authorities in service delivery is \ncompromised by the absence of a system of conditional grants.  \n \n6.  Outdated regulatory framework. There is widespread agreement among stakeholders \nthat the LGC has structural deficiencies that need to be addressed through a government-led \nreview.5  The  deficiencies  include  lack  of  clarity  in  functional  assignments,  limited  and \nunproductive sources of local revenues, and inadequate and inequitable transfer mechanisms. \nIn addition, the LGC requires a review of the criteria defined for jurisdictional formation, and the \nsimplification of procedures for LGUs to access commercial sources of credit.   \n \n7.   Improved transparency of the local government units through efficient local public \nfinancial management systems. Recent reforms to local public financial management (PFM) \nsystems have increased the predictability of revenues to LGUs, established the foundations of \nfinancial  management  information  systems,  and  improved  the  capacity  of  LGUs\u2019  financial \nmanagement personnel. The latter efforts need to be continued, however, and undertaken \nwithin  the framework  of  a medium-term  plan for  local  PFM  reforms that  consolidates  and \nharmonizes  current  initiatives.  Policy  priorities  include  the  improvement  of  local  revenue \nforecasting systems and LGU credit worthiness assessments. In addition, there is a need to \nclarify  the  legal  status  of  local  economic  enterprises  (to  prevent  these  enterprises  from \njeopardizing  the  fiscal  stability  of  LGUs  due  to  unclear  accounting  practices)  and  of  LGU \nalliances (currently formed by non-legally binding agreements that limit long-term cooperation in \nservice delivery). \n   \n8.   Strengthening accountability of the local government units to their constituencies. \nThe implementation of participatory planning, budgeting, and monitoring systems that improve \nthe accountability of the national government and LGUs to their citizens is still ongoing. These \nsystems  will  allow  improvements  to  allocative  efficiency  in  public  expenditure  by  aligning \nnational and local development priorities for service delivery. A number of parallel local planning \nprocesses need to be harmonized around the comprehensive development plan system to allow \nfor more efficient links between planning and budgeting. Additional efforts are required in the \ndevelopment  of  LGU  performance  measurement  systems.  The  foundations  of  a  local \ngovernment performance measurement system (LGPMS) are in place, but significant work is \n                                                \n5  The  code  instructs  regular  reviews  every  5  years,  but  none  has  taken  place  since  its  enactment.  The \nrecommendation for the review of the LGC was included in the statement of the recent Philippines Development \nForum 2013. \n ", "3 \nrequired to expand and increase the system\u2019s analytical capacity and its integration with other \nlocal government performance tools. Because these systems are normally based on LGUs\u2019 self-\nreported information, instruments that directly channel local constituents\u2019 views and preferences \non service delivery are also required to enhance the efficiency of local budget formulation. \n \n9.   Sustaining and expanding local government reforms. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) supported government efforts in local government finance reforms in the Philippines \nthrough the Local Government Finance and Budget Reform (LGFBR) Program, consisting of \ntwo policy-based loans and several technical assistance (TA) projects.6 LGFBR support focused \non  strengthening  national  and  local  PFM  systems,  improving  the  efficiency  of  budgeting \nprocesses, assisting access to credit by LGUs, and laying the basis of LGU performance \nmonitoring systems. The completeness, timeliness, and transparency of the release of LGU \nshares in national government revenues was improved, and LGU revenues increased by 30% \n(mostly from transfers) between 2007 and 2009. Regulations were passed providing for the \nautomatic appropriation of the IRA from 2007 and for the timely estimation and certification of \nthe IRA shares. Under the LGFBR, support was provided for the development, computerization, \nand  implementation  of  the  electronic  statement  of  receipts  and  expenditures  (ESRE),  the \nfinancial reporting system for LGUs. These efforts are being sustained in the proposed program. \nThe LGFBR supported the development of the government\u2019s performance-based grant policy, \nwhich has materialized upon the establishment of performance-based grants. Also, the LGFBR \nsupported the development of the LGPMS, while the proposed program will assist the further \ndevelopment of accountability mechanisms for LGUs.     \n \n10.   Lessons learned. The experience gained from the LGFBR and subsequent country \nanalytic work on critical development constraints, decentralization, and local governance in the \nPhilippines has generated a number of important lessons. First, the implementation of the \nLGFBR program underlined the need to sustain a long-term commitment to reforms, ensuring \nfuture initiatives are demand-driven. Second, the importance of local government reforms in the \nachievement of high, inclusive, and sustainable growth needs to be made more explicit. Thus, \nthe  program  will  support  high  and  sustainable  growth  through  several  channels,  including  \n(i) improved service delivery by LGUs, (ii) the rationalization of local revenue frameworks to \nassist local business development, and (iii) strengthened PFM systems. Third, earlier work on \ndecentralization has shown that the reform program needs to be anchored in a rich institutional \nframework. The first government-led review of the LGC since 1991 will be articulated through \nrobust consultative mechanisms that will include all stakeholders. Lastly, during program design, \nADB drew upon its experiences from supporting decentralization in other countries in the region. \nAs a result, attention has been focused on supporting capacity development, strengthening \naccountability mechanisms, and encouraging LGUs\u2019 tax effort for enhanced fiscal autonomy and \nlower transfer dependence.7 \n \n11.   Programmatic approach and innovative features. The comprehensive nature of the \nreforms needed requires a lending modality that offers a flexible and long-term framework for \nADB support. The programmatic approach is favored based on past experiences supporting \nsimilar reforms in the region. The Philippines displays an adequate institutional setting for \nintergovernmental  relations  and  a  rich\u2014although  inconsistent\u2014policy  framework,  making \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2007.

The program adopts, in comparison with \nthe LGFBR, a more ambitious approach to local government reforms, including (i) a review of \nthe  regulatory  framework  for  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations;  and  (ii)  an  emphasis  on \ndemand-side  aspects  of  local  governance  and  performance-based  monitoring  approaches, \nwhile fostering incremental progress made through earlier PFM reform initiatives.  \n \n12.   The  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132016  identifies  supporting  local  government \nfinance and fiscal decentralization reforms as priority.8 The program has been designed by the \nGovernment of the Philippines, ADB, and the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). It is \ninformed by the sectoral assessments produced jointly by ADB and AFD by the lessons from \nthe implementation of TA projects,9 and by the dialogue sustained with national government \ninstitutions, local government representatives, private sector organizations, academe, and civil \nsociety.  The  processing  team  is  coordinating  the  program  design  with  the  European \nCommission\u2019s LGU public financial management reform program and the Decentralization and \nLocal Government (DIALOG) Trust Fund. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact will be improved delivery of services by LGUs. The outcome will be efficient \nand  transparent  local  governments  with  an  adequate  and  equitable  fiscal  framework.  The \nGovernment has completed all of the 35 reform actions (7 policy triggers and 28 milestones) for \nsubprogram 1. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.   The  program  includes  two  subprograms  structured  around  four  policy  outputs:  \n(i) creating a conducive fiscal framework for inclusive growth; (ii) developing an adequate and \nequitable  resource  framework  for  fiscal  sustainability;  (iii)  strengthening  public  financial \nmanagement to assist efficient LGU service delivery; and (iv) fostering good local governance, \ntransparency, and accountability. \n \n15.   Conducive fiscal framework for inclusive growth. The government is reviewing the \noutdated regulatory framework for intergovernmental fiscal relations. For the first time since it \nwas  approved,  the  LGC  will  undergo  a  government-led  substantive  review  led  by  the \nDepartment of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). The review is articulated under the \nCoordinating Committee on Decentralization (CCD).10 The scope of the review includes LGU \nexpenditure and revenue assignments, and fiscal transfers; and it will be supported by an ADB \nTA.11 For subprogram 2, the proposed amendments to the LGC will be submitted through the \nCabinet  Cluster  on  Good  Governance  and  Anti-corruption  to  the  Oversight  Committee  on \nDevolution (OCD) and to the Legislative- Executive Development Advisory Council. The OCD \nincludes representation from national agencies, the leagues of local governments, 12 and the \nlegislature (House of Representatives and Senate). \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

There \nis a league for each level of local government (provincial, cities, municipalities, and barangays).  \n ", "5 \n16.  Adequate and equitable resource framework for fiscal sustainability. As part of the  \ngovernment\u2019s drive toward good governance and fiscal sustainability, the DILG has developed \nperformance-based  financing  mechanisms  for  LGUs,  incentivizing  efficient  and  transparent \nfinancial  management  under  subprogram  1.  The  Performance  Challenge  Fund  (PCF), \nestablished in 2010, is a performance-based transfer that requires, as an eligibility condition, \nthat LGUs be awarded the Seal of Good Housekeeping.13 For the seal to be awarded, LGUs are \nrequired to obtain a no adverse or disclaimer opinion from the Commission on Audit and to \ncomply with the Full Disclosure Policy. In 2013, the PCF already budgeted over P1 billion for \ncapital development projects at the local level, for which LGUs must provide cofinancing. The \nDILG approved, in addition, new guidelines for the appropriation and utilization of the 20% of the \nIRA that is devoted to capital investment projects.  \n \n17.  The Department of Finance (DOF) has improved the revenue collection capacity of \nLGUs. A new computer module including a tax payer database and a system for the estimation \nof  the  business  tax  has  been  developed.  The  system  assists  accurate  estimates  of  local \ngovernment revenues. The DOF has developed uniform valuation standards of real estate for \nthe local assessors\u2019 manual, and requested all assessors to be licensed as a condition for \nappointment. In addition, the flow of information between the Bureau of Internal Revenue and \nthe LGUs for tax collection purposes has been improved, and the DILG has produced guidelines \nfor the preparation of local revenue codes and local incentives codes with the aim of improving \nconsistency between them. The lack of consistency in local regulations has been highlighted \nregularly by the private sector as one of the major constraints to investment at the local level.  \n  \n18.  Substantive  improvements  to  financial  information  systems  have  been  achieved, \nallowing for enhanced access to credit by LGUs. The DOF has developed a creditworthiness \nsystem that assists evaluations of prospective LGU borrowers by creditors. This represents an \nimportant step toward the improved transparency of LGUs. In addition, the DOF has developed \nan  LGU  debt  certification  system  that  facilitates  the  issuance  of  certificates  on  maximum \nborrowing and debt service capacities.  \n \n19.   For  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  continue  to  improve  the  quality  of  local \nexpenditure with the implementation of a monitoring system for the LGU capital investment \nprojects and through the full development of the Seal of Good Governance for LGUs (including \nthe seals of competitiveness, disaster preparedness, and environment). The DOF will improve \nthe collection performance of the real property tax by assisting the updating of the revised \nLGU\u2019s schedules of market values. These schedules define the base of the property tax and in \nmany  cases  have  not  been  updated  for  years.  The  government  will  explore  options  for \nexpanding LGUs\u2019 revenue assignments, including green taxes,14 and will work toward ensuring \nthe timely and equitable release of mining revenue shares to LGUs. Efforts will continue toward \nthe rationalization of national fiscal incentives to investment, with a view toward ensuring their \npositive impact on local economic development and fiscal revenues. Finally, the government will \ncomplete the roll out of the new modules on credit worthiness and debt certification to DOF \nregional offices and will work toward establishing a single agency LGU loan monitoring system. \n \n                                                \n13 The  Seal  of  Good  Housekeeping  for  LGUs  aims  to  recognize  LGUs  with  good  performance  in  internal   \nhousekeeping focusing in four areas: (i) good planning; (ii) sound fiscal management; (iii) transparency and \naccountability; and (iv) valuing of performance information. The Seal of Good Housekeeping is a component of the \nsystem of Seal of Good Governance. \n14 Green taxes (also called \"environmental taxes\" or \"pollution taxes\") are excise taxes on environmental pollutants or \non  goods  whose  use  produces  such  pollutants  (http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/key-elements/ \nenvironment/what-is.cfm).  \n ", "6 \n20.  Strengthened public financial management for efficient service delivery of local \ngovernment units. Under subprogram 1, the government\u2014in coordination with all relevant \nagencies\u2014is developing the strategic planning framework for local PFM reforms. In particular, \nthe Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has initiated the drafting of the medium-term \nLGU public financial management road map, which is expected to be completed early in 2014 \nand will contain the policy actions incorporated in subprogram 2.  \n \n21.  The  alignment  of  national  and  local  expenditure  priorities  has  been  improved  by  a \nnumber of initiatives. The DBM has implemented the bottom-up budgeting (BUB) and planning \ninitiative, encouraging participatory planning processes at LGUs and gender-sensitive project \nselection.15 In 2013, P8 billion was budgeted, with 595 LGUs participating in the initiative. The \nDILG has developed guidelines for the allocation and utilization of the Disaster Risk Reduction \nManagement Fund, and has finalized the compendium of planning documents required for the \npreparation of LGUs\u2019 comprehensive development plans. \n \n22.  The  accuracy  of  revenue  target  setting  by  LGUs  has  been  strengthened  with  the \ndevelopment of an ESRE module on LGU revenue forecasting. This instrument allows for the \nreconciliation of LGU targets with the assessment from DOF regional offices, thereby improving \nthe credibility of budget preparation. In addition, a limitation to the use of certain LGU transfers \nfor personnel salaries of local economic enterprises and public utilities has been issued. \n \n23.   During subprogram 2, the government will produce the first implementation report of the \nmedium-term road map for LGU PFM reforms. Efforts will be made to harmonize the LGU \nplanning  processes  and  to  integrate  participatory  planning  principles  in  the  consolidated \nguidelines. The implementation of the BUB initiative will proceed, including the preparation of a \ngovernment-led evaluation of it and the review of its budgetary allocation formula. The DBM will \ninitiate the revision of the Budget Operations Manual16 to incorporate policies in participatory \nbudgeting, performance-based mechanisms, and policy changes to the Special Education Fund \nand the regime of local economic enterprises. The DBM will incorporate an expenditure module \nto  the  ESRE  and  work  toward  the  approval  of  the  new  guidelines  for  the  establishment, \ndivestiture, and operations of local economic enterprises. \n \n24.  Good  local  governance,  transparency,  and  accountability.  Assisting  inter-local \ncooperation for economic development and service delivery is a government priority. Under \nsubprogram 1, the DILG has undertaken a review of the financing framework for LGU alliances \nto guide the implementation of a new policy framework that defines the corporate powers of \nLGU alliances, clarifies their legal personality, and defines their financing options. \n \n25.  The  DILG  has  improved  the  transparency  and  accountability  of  LGUs  toward  their \nconstituents by issuing the Full Disclosure Policy, mandating LGUs to publicly disclose key \noperations reports. In addition, through the Civil Society Participation Fund, the government is \nfacilitating the capacity building of civil society organizations to improve their analytical capacity. \nTo generate feedback from constituents on LGU service delivery performance, and thus assist \nwith budget formulation and policy design, the DILG is piloting the Citizens\u2019 Satisfaction Index \nSystem, which should become a key tool for measuring LGU performance.  \n \n                                                \n15 The BUB is a conditional grant from line agencies to LGUs to assist national development priorities through locally \nimplemented projects. It encourages local good governance (through the Seal of Good Housekeeping) and \nparticipatory planning and budgeting practices.   \n16 The  manual  systematizes  methods  and  procedures  in  budget  preparation,  authorization,  execution,  and \naccountability for LGUs (Department of Budget and Management. 2012. Operations Budget Manual. Manila). \n ", "7 \n26.  The  capacities  of  local  government  officials  and  local  government  political \nrepresentatives continue to improve. The Newly Elected Officials program trained 100% of \nnewly elected officials after the 2010 elections. The program has since undergone substantive \nredesign, and full participation of all new officials has been pursued after the 2013 elections.  \n \n27.  Important steps toward assisting women representation at LGU committees have been \ntaken, and the government remains committed to the implementation of gender-responsive \nplanning and budgeting systems, such as through the recent BUB initiative. In addition, LGUs \nhave adopted a referral system on violence against women.  \n \n28.  The government continues to strengthen performance monitoring systems to assist local \naccountability relationships. In particular, the DILG has improved the coverage of the LGPMS \nwhere over 90% of LGUs now provide data that is used in preparing their comprehensive \ndevelopment  plans.  The  information  provided  is  also  used  to  prepare  the  state  of  local \ngovernance and the state of local development reports, which are regularly uploaded into the \nLGPMS website and are publicly available.  \n \n29.   During  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  implement  the  reviewed  policy  on  LGU \nalliances and will integrate compliance to the full disclosure policy as a condition of eligibility to \nLGU  financing  programs  such  as  the  PCF,  or  the  BUB  initiative.  Efforts  to  improve  the \ncapacities of local officers will continue with the development of a performance evaluation \nsystem for local budget officers. The improved assessment of gender and development plans \nand budget implementation from LGUs will be pursued,  with a view toward increasing the \ngender responsiveness of LGU budgets. The LGPMS will be substantially revised with two main \ngoals: (i) it will be integrated with the Seal of Good Governance, and (ii) its analytical capacity \nwill be improved in order to assist LGU decision making.     \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n30.  The  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $802  million.  Subprogram  1  is  estimated  at  \n$401 million, including cofinancing, and an equal amount is estimated for subprogram 2 (Table \n1). The loan size is based on the financing needs of the Philippines, the strength of the policy \nreform package, and its development impact. The Philippines\u2019 gross financing needs remain \nhigh. In 2013, with a budget deficit target of 2%, the government will need to borrow P735 billion \n($16.5  billion).  In  2012,  deficit  financing  was  obtained  from  domestic  sources  (84%)  and \nexternal  sources  (16%).  About  38%  of  external  borrowing  was  accounted  for  by  official \ndevelopment assistance. In 2013, the government expected to borrow an estimated $1.5 billion \nthrough  official  development  assistance  to  close  the  budget  gap.  The  subprogram  1  loan \nproceeds will support key development spending in the 2013 budget, including the BUB initiative  \n(approximately $190 million) and the PCF (approximately $20 million). \n \n31.  The  government  has  requested  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $250  million  from  ADB's \nordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  1,  which  will  be  disbursed  in  two \ninstallments of $125 million each during 2014. The government requested two installments in \norder to ensure efficient cash flow management by minimizing the incidence of negative carry \nthat may occur due to a potential mismatch in timing between disbursement of the full loan \namount and its full utilization. The government also aims to minimize the burden of financing \ncharges that would arise due to higher interest payments payable on a fully disbursed loan as \ncompared to lower commitment charges payable on a loan disbursed in two installments. The \nloan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years (30% annuity amortization \nmethod), an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other \n ", "8 \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on this, the average loan \nmaturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The financing plan is \nin Table 1. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full \nexchange cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources, in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.17 The proceeds of the policy-based \nloan will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as the borrower. Subprogram 1 will \nreceive parallel cofinancing of $150 million from the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.  \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nSubprogram 1  Subprogram 2 \n Amount   Amount   Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank    250.00  250.00  62.30 \nOrdinary capital resources (loan)       \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (loan)a  150.00  150.00  37.40 \nGovernment of the Philippines (in kind)      1.00  1.00  0.30 \nTotal    401.0  401.00  100.00 \na  Negotiations with the Department of Finance on the cofinancing agreement were being finalized at the time of Board \ncirculation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n   \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n32.   The subprogram 1 period is from September 2010 to June 2013, and the subprogram 2 \nperiod is from July 2013 to June 2015. The DOF will be the executing agency for the program \nand will be responsible for the overall implementation of both subprograms and the medium-\nterm results framework. The CCD will serve as the steering committee for the program, as it \nincludes all the implementing agencies and relevant stakeholders. The CCD will lead the review \nof the LGC, and the recommendations will be submitted to the OCD for consideration. The \nprogram\u2019s  implementing  agencies  include  the DOF,  the  DILG, the  DBM,  and  the  National \nEconomic and Development Authority. The implementing agencies will be responsible for the \nday-to-day  implementation  of  subprogram  1.  The  DOF  will  coordinate  with  implementing \nagencies and meet with them as required to monitor the progress on subprogram 1 reforms.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n33.   The implementation of the reform program include the cost of implementation of the BUB \ninitiative, the PCF, the associated funds to the Seal of Good Governance, and costs related to \npolicy development and implementation. The benefits expected include allocative efficiency \ngains from the reassignment of financial resources to local government budgets, the expected \nimpact of increased local government expenditure on regional gross domestic product, and \nsavings from financial management efficiency.18   \n                                                \n17  ADB. 1998.

Manila.  \n18 The Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides  \ndetails on the expected costs and benefits associated with the program.   \n ", "9 \nB.  Governance \n \n34.   Good governance and anticorruption remain permanent priorities of the government. \nThe government\u2019s PFM plan was announced in February 2011, and its local counterpart\u2014the \nmedium-term LGU public financial management reform plan\u2014is currently being drafted, with the \nsupport of development partners.19 ADB has assisted local government finance and budget \nreforms since 2007, starting with the LGFBR reform program loan completed in 2009. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the DOF, \nthe DILG, the DBM, and the National Economic and Development Authority.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n35.   The program will assist the government to reduce poverty and achieve inclusive growth \nby (i) helping prioritize and improve the coordination of pro-poor expenditures at national and \nlocal governments; (ii) assisting in the creation of predictable and transparent LGU revenue \npolicies that support private entrepreneurship and business investment; and (iii) developing \nparticipatory and accountable planning, budgeting, and monitoring systems for LGUs that allow \nfor good project selection and good governance practices in implementation.20 The impact on \nefficient service delivery is expected to be felt over the medium term, and particularly upon low \nincome individuals. Implementation of reforms will greatly assist the government\u2019s rehabilitation \nstrategy of local governments in areas affected by the Yolanda typhoon. Subprogram 1 is \nclassified as having some gender elements. Key gender designs include the mainstreaming of \ngender  issues  in  local  expenditure  programs,  women\u2019s  participation  in  local  governance \nprocesses,  inclusion  of  gender  indicators  in  the  LGPMS,  and  the  inclusion  of  women  in \ncapacity-development initiatives. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n36.   In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  1  is \nclassified under category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE.
