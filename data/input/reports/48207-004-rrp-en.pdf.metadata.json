FMDIP  uses  a  programmatic \napproach, which aligns ADB\u2019s support with the government\u2019s reform program over a medium-to \nlong-term  horizon.  The  programmatic  approach  which  consisted  of  three  subprograms  and \nsubprogram  1  amounting  to  $400  million  were  approved  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  in \nSeptember 2015.4 Subprogram 1 included 23 policy actions, focused on institutionalizing OJK as \nan  integrated  and  independent  financial  services  regulator  and  implementing  best  practices  in \ncapital market development. Subprogram 2 was approved in June 2017 with a loan of $400 million \nand comprised of 25 policy actions. It supported the development of OJK\u2019s consolidated finance \nsector master plan, which focused on making the sector stable, inclusive, and contributive to the \neconomy.  It  also  advanced  OJK\u2019s  fiscal  independence  and  legal  immunity,  and  began  ADB\u2019s \nengagement  in  financial  inclusion.5 All  completed  policy  actions  in  subprograms  1  and  2  have \nbeen  sustained.  The  focus  of  Subprogram  3  is  on  implementing  the  master  plan,  expanding \ncapital  market  products  and  services,  and  advancing  financial  inclusion  using  financial \ntechnology.  The  inclusion  of  the  post-program  partnership  framework  (P3F),  2019\u20132024  will \nenable  ADB  to  continue  supporting  finance  sector  reforms  and  provides  the  platform  for  a \nsubsequent financial inclusion-focused program in 2021.   \n \n4. \nThe  development  problem.  Indonesia\u2019s  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) growth \naveraged 5.0% during 2014\u20132017. Growth picked up to 5.2% in 2018 from 5.1% in 2017, with \npotential growth estimated at 5.7% for 2020\u20132024.6 However, the government needs to balance \nsustained growth with stability, while reducing inequality to meet the development targets in its \nnational medium-term development plan.7 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2018.

National Medium-Term Development Plan: RPJMN, 2015\u20132019. Jakarta.  \n \n\n\f2 \n\nHigh  inequality  remains  a  major  development  challenge.  Income  inequality  as \n5. \nmeasured by the Gini coefficient declined from 0.410 in 2014 to 0.384 in 2018, while the poverty \nrate  declined  from  11.3%  in  2014  to  9.7%  in  2018,  reaching  single  digits  for  the  first  time. \nNevertheless, close to 40% of the population remains close to the national poverty line and are \nvulnerable  to  slipping  back  into  poverty.  In  addition,  regional  disparity  remains  a  significant \nproblem. For example, the per capita income in Jakarta (about Rp158 million) is 13 times higher \nthan  in  East  Nusa  Tenggara.  Recent  improvements  in  revenue  mobilization  has  enabled  the \ngovernment to significantly expand social assistance programs and regional transfers. However, \nthe fiscal impact of large external shocks, such as the natural disasters in Central Sulawesi and \nLombok in 2018 can put this at risk.8 \n \n6. \nFinancial exclusion is directly linked to inequality. Lack of access to financial products \nand  services  deprives  the  poor  of  income  and  livelihood  opportunities  and  exposes  them  to \nfinancial  risks  arising  from  natural  disasters  and  economic  shocks.9 Indonesia  has  increased \nfinancial  inclusion  more  than  its  regional  comparators  from  2011  to  2017  (Figure  1).  The \nproportion of the adult population with a formal bank account was 49% in 2017, compared with \n36% in 2014 and 20% in 2011.10 Similarly, access to formal bank accounts by the poorest 40% \nof population in Indonesia increased to 37% in 2017 from 22% in 2014, and Indonesia has made \nimpressive gains  in women\u2019s  access  to finance  (51%  in 2017 from  38%  in  2014).  Despite  this \nprogress, over half of the adult population remains financially excluded. Inclusion levels among \nthe  poorest  40%  of  the  population  and  women  are  considerably  lower  than  in  Malaysia  and \nThailand  (Figure  2).  Over  one  third  of  the  unbanked  adult  population  in  Indonesia  considers \ndistance  to  be  a  key  reason  for  not  having  a  formal  bank  account.  Close  to  70%  own  mobile \nphones,  highlighting  the  significant  opportunity  for  the  use  of  mobile  phone-based  financial \ntechnology  to  overcome  geographical  barriers  and  increase  financial  inclusion,  with  a  view  to \nreaching the target of 75% by 2019. \n \nFigure 1: Financial Inclusion in Indonesia \nand Selected Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations Countries (2011\u20132017) \n\nFigure 2: Financial Inclusion in Indonesia and \nSelected Association of Southeast Asian \nNations Countries (2017) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: A.

Washington, DC: World Bank. \n\n\f3 \n\n7. \nA deep and resilient finance sector is essential for efficient financial intermediation \nand  stable  economic  growth.  Indonesia\u2019s  finance  sector  has  become  more  developed  and \nstable over the program\u2019s implementation period (2013\u20132018). The finance sector (bank credit, \nstock market capitalization, and bonds) has grown from 103% of GDP in 2013 to about 117% of \nGDP in 2017. The trading volume of the bond market has also improved from an average of $66 \nbillion in 2015 to an average of $94 billion in 2018. Similarly, indicators of financial stability such \nas credit default swap spreads have declined from 2014 to 2018. However, some factors may still \nsubject  the finance  sector  to  instability;  it  is  heavily  reliant  on  bank  intermediation,  and foreign \nownership  of  the  government  bond  market  remains  relatively  high  at  about  38%.  Financial \ninstability disrupts economic growth and impacts poor households disproportionately as they have \nfewer  and  less-diversified  assets.  Further  reforms  to  diversify  the  finance  sector,  including  by \ndeveloping the capital market, are required to deepen the finance sector, strengthen its stability, \nand make it more inclusive. \n \n8. \nBinding  constraints.  The government  and  OJK  recognize  these  challenges  and  have \nidentified three primary constraints: (i) an incomplete framework and coordination mechanism for \nfinancial stability; (ii) the shallow finance sector; and (iii) financial exclusion of poor households.11 \nThese constraints are discussed in paras. 9\u201313. \n \n9. \nIncomplete framework and coordination mechanism for financial stability. The Law \non Prevention and Resolution of Financial System Crisis (Financial Stability Law) enacted in 2016 \nwas a significant reform in providing OJK with legal immunity that allows supervisors to perform \ntheir duty without fear of litigation. The law also provides OJK with the authority to require systemic \nbanks to increase their capital to mitigate financial crises. However, several constraints remain. \nFirst, implementing regulations, including those governing recovery plans and resolutions, need \nto be adopted. Similarly, the borrowing criteria for the deposit insurance corporation (LPS) in the \nbank resolution process needs to be clarified. Second, integrated implementation of OJK\u2019s master \nplan is required so that financial service providers offering the same services are treated similarly \nto avoid distortions  and regulatory  arbitrage. This  requires  coordination  through a crosscutting \nsecretariat with a focus on the priority reform actions. Third, integrated supervision needs to be \nmore holistic so that financial conglomerates are better supervised. Indonesia\u2019s finance sector is \ncharacterized  by  the  strong  presence  of  financial  conglomerates,  some  having  a  horizontal \nownership structure, which complicates supervision. Under the current regulatory framework, OJK \ndoes not  have access to information on  nonfinancial  holding  companies  because they  are  not \nlicensed or regulated by OJK. \n \nShallow finance sector. Notwithstanding recent finance sector growth (para. 7), it is still \n10. \ndominated by banks. The size of the equity market in 2017 (51% of GDP) and market liquidity as \nmeasured by share turnover velocity (26%) are small relative to Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) comparators. Similarly, the size of the bond market equals 18% of GDP, with \ncorporate bonds representing only 3% of GDP. \n \n11. \nDespite  strong  potential,  Indonesia\u2019s  corporate  sukuk  (sharia  compliant  bond)  market \nrepresents just 4% of its overall sukuk market. A key constraint is uncertainty in relation to tax \ntreatment.  Specifically,  to  comply  with  Islamic  finance  principles,  issuance  of  sukuk  requires \nmultiple asset transfers; given the lack of clarity on tax treatment, there is a risk that value-added \ntax  (VAT)  will  be  charged  each  time  the  asset  is  transferred.  For  investors,  sukuk  investment \nreturns may not be eligible for the same income tax deductions as their conventional counterparts. \nTherefore, corporate sukuks are less attractive to both potential issuers and investors. A recent \n\n                                                \n11 Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nADB survey of underwriters and investors suggests that VAT neutrality and income tax deductions \nfor sukuk investments would provide impetus and incentives for the sukuk market to expand. \n \n12. \nThe government is committed to developing municipal bond markets, but the lack of legal \ncertainty on audit requirements has constrained subnational government bond issuances. OJK\u2019s \n2016  announcement  that  it  would  exempt  municipal  governments  from  undergoing  additional \naudits from private auditors registered with OJK has yet to be codified in regulation. This potential \ndouble audit requirement increases the issuance cost for subnational governments. There is also \na  need  for  clarity  on  the  content  of  the  bond  prospectus,  legal  documents  to  be  submitted  by \nsubnational governments, and their post-issuance reporting obligations. \n \n13. \nFinancial exclusion. With over 17,500 islands, Indonesia faces significant geographical \nchallenges to  achieving financial  inclusion.  Constraints  include:  (i)  coordination  among  various \ngovernment agencies and other stakeholders is lacking and limits the implementation of financial \ninclusion activities; (ii) the regulatory framework covers only peer-to-peer lending, with no overall \nregulatory framework for the financial technology industry; (iii) the number of branchless banks \nand  agents  is  insufficient  given  the  large  number  of  people  that  are  financially  excluded;  and  \n(iv) a low level of financial literacy. The national financial literacy rate is 29%, with women having \nlower  literacy  than  men.  Furthermore,  the  lack  of  bank  services  in  marginalized  provinces, \ndisproportionately affects women as they have greater mobility constraints.     \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe government\u2019s reform agenda. The government\u2019s reform agenda is anchored in the \nNational  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  for  2015\u20132019,  which  seeks  to  reduce  the  Gini \ncoefficient to 0.36 and lower the poverty rate to 7%\u20138% by 2019 (footnote 7). The government \nrecognizes  that  promoting  financial  stability,  deepening  the  financial  market,  and  improving \naccess to financial services for the poor are integral to meeting these targets. The government\u2019s \nstrategy  consists  of  a  series  of  reforms,  including  implementing  OJK\u2019s  mandate  as  an \nindependent  and  integrated  regulator,  enacting  the  Financial  Stability  Law,  and  implementing \nregulations to safeguard financial stability. These reforms will be followed by measures to develop \nnew  instruments  in  the  capital  market  and  a  stronger  focus  on  financial  inclusion  for  poor \nhouseholds. The government launched the National Financial Inclusion Strategy in August 2016, \nwhich sets an ambitious target for 75% of the adult population to have access to financial services \nby  2019. 12 In  addition,  based  on  the  recommendations  in  the  Financial  Sector  Assessment \nProgram of 2017, the government also launched the National Financial Market Development and \nDeepening Strategy, 2018-2024 to anchor reforms in the finance sector.13 \n \n15. \nProposed  policy  reforms.  The  program  supports  the  following  reform  areas:  \n(i)  regulatory  structure  for  financial  stability  strengthened;  (ii)  financial  market  deepened;  and  \n(iii)  financial  inclusion  enhanced.  At  the  inception  of  subprogram  3,  the  government  agreed  to \ncomplete 10 prior actions (or triggers) and 12 policy milestones as the basis for subprogram 3.14 \nDuring the processing of subprogram 3, a new prior action was added to reflect OJK\u2019s approval \nof  green  bond  regulations  and  the  issuance  of  the  first  sovereign  green  sukuk.  The  policy \nmilestones on municipal bonds and the expansion of national health insurance were upgraded to \nprior actions to emphasize the importance of coordination between the government and OJK to \n                                                \n12 Government of Indonesia. 2016.

National  Financial  Market  Development  and  Deepening  Strategy,  2018\u20132024. \n\nJakarta. \n\n14 Prior  actions  are  considered  loan  disbursement  conditions,  while  policy  milestones  strengthen  the  program. \nComparison of Original and Revised Subprogram 3 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f5 \n\nresolve  constraints  on  the  issuance  of  municipal  bonds  and  to  recognize  the  importance  of \nnational health insurance to developing the demand side (investment) of the capital market. The \nchanges in the policy matrix are reflected in the revised design and monitoring framework (DMF) \n(Appendix 1). Subprogram 3 now contains 23 policy actions (13 prior actions representing high \nimpact reforms, and 10 policy milestones) all of which have been accomplished. \n \n16. \nRegulatory structure for financial stability strengthened. This reform area builds on \naccomplishments  in  subprograms  1  and  2 that  established  OJK  as  an  independent  integrated \nregulator,  enacted  the  Financial  Stability  Law  that  provided  OJK  with  legal  immunity,  and \ndeveloped OJK\u2019s consolidated master plan 2015\u20132019. There were three main accomplishments \nin subprogram 3. First, OJK advanced implementation of its master plan and completed 90% of \npriority reforms ahead of schedule, including thematic risk-based surveillance, and simplification \nof both the process and documentation for small-scale capital market issuances. The reforms in \nthe master plan benefit women through the focus on financial inclusion and literacy. Monitoring of \nthe master plan is coordinated through a central secretariat with quarterly reporting to the Board \nof Commissioners.  \n \n17. \nSecond, OJK issued three regulations to implement the Financial Stability Law adopting \na risk-based approach to supervision by: (i) determining level of supervision based on the risk \nprofile of each bank; (ii) providing procedures to establish bridge banks for orderly resolution of \nbanks that cannot be recapitalized; and (iii) introducing a comprehensive regulatory framework \non how systemic banks report to OJK. The Center of Financial Sector Policies (PKSK), Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) led government coordination efforts to safeguard financial stability, including \nthe  issuance  of  regulations  (i)  to  allow  the  deposit  insurance  corporation  to  borrow  from  the \ngovernment, and (ii) on procedures to write off assets for banking restructuring. Third, OJK has \ndrafted  a  regulation  requiring  that  all  financial  conglomerates  set  up  holding  companies, \neffectively  converting  conglomerates \ninto  vertical  structures  (a  holding  company  with \nsubsidiaries). Integrated supervision, especially of financial conglomerates, provides OJK with a \nframework to monitor and mitigate operational and systemic risks. The outcome is an integrated \nrisk rating for each financial conglomerate. \n \n18. \nin \nsubprograms 1 and 2, including implementation of international prudential standards for Islamic \nfinance  related  to  governance  and  collective  investment  schemes.  There  were  four  key \naccomplishments in subprogram 3. First, the government and OJK took concrete steps to facilitate \nthe issuance of municipal bonds. OJK issued regulations to eliminate overlapping requirements \nand provided clear guidance on issuance requirements, which: (i) accept audits performed by the \nSupreme Audit Board for issuances, eliminating the need for a second audit by a private auditor; \n(ii) require subnational governments to disclose projects that will be funded by the issuance; and \n(iii)  simplify  reporting  requirements.  The  Central  Java  subnational  government  subsequently \nmade preparations to issue bonds by allocating funds in its budget and preparing a prospectus. \n \n19. \nSecond, OJK issued green bond regulations that require potential issuers to disclose the \ncredentials  of  external  reviewers  who  validate  that the  projects  will  be environmentally  friendly \nthroughout the tenure of the bond. This is consistent with the Green Principles of the International \nCapital  Market  Association  and  the  ASEAN  Green  Bond  Principles.  In  February  2018,  the \ngovernment  took  the  lead  with  the  issuance  of  the  world\u2019s  first  sovereign  green  sukuk  of  \n$1.25 billion. The issuance will fund green infrastructure, including renewable energy, sustainable \ntransport, and waste management projects. The third accomplishment is on Islamic finance. The \nMOF has finalized revisions to the VAT law that will exempt the underlying assets of corporate \nsukuk  from  VAT,  providing  the  needed  tax  neutrality.  Concurrently,  OJK  has  implemented  all \n\nFinancial  market  deepened.  This  reform  area  builds  on  accomplishments \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\ninternational  Islamic  finance  prudential  standards  for  capital  market  as  issued  by  the  Islamic \nFinancial  Services  Board.  This  provides  a  regulatory  environment  to  enable  Islamic  finance  to \ndevelop and grow in a sustainable manner in line with international standards. Finally, the national \nhealth insurance reforms increased the number of beneficiaries from about 177 million in 2017 to \n208 million in 2018, including 103 million women. Strengthening domestic institutional investors, \nsuch as insurance and pension, is crucial for capital market development. \n \n20. \nFinancial  inclusion  enhanced.  This  reform  area  builds  on  accomplishments  during \nsubprograms  1  and  2,  including  the  launch  of  the  branchless  banking  initiative  and  the \nestablishment  of  the  National  Council  for  Financial  Inclusion  (NCFI).  There  were  four  major \naccomplishments under this output during subprogram 3. First, OJK approved expansion of the \nbranchless banking initiative with a significant increase in the number of agents, cities and districts \nserved,  which  help  provide  financial  services  to  marginalized  provinces  and  populations.  OJK \nalso revised information collection for branchless banking to include sex-disaggregated data for \nagents  and  customers.  This  will  enable  banks  to  analyze  the  gender  profiles  of  agents  and \ncustomers to help banks improve their services. Measures were also taken to balance expansion \nand consumer protection. Participating banks are required to comply with strict security measures \nin the recruitment of agents, and to train and monitor them in order to prevent fraudulent activities. \nThe effect of these reforms can be seen in the number of new account holders which increased \nsignificantly from approximately 5 million in 2017 to 22 million in 2018. \n \n21. \nSecond, to improve financial literacy, OJK implemented online e-modules based on the \ntextbooks approved by the Ministry of National Education for elementary, junior high, and senior \nhigh school students; and conducted 40 financial literacy programs targeting women, youth, and \nmigrant workers. Third, OJK consolidated its financial inclusion and financial technology activities \nby  launching  the  OJK  Infinity  (Innovation  Centre  for  Digital  Financial  Technology)  to  promote \ncollaboration among regulators, the government, and industries. Finally, OJK also issued digital \nfinance  regulations  that  map  out  the  requirements  for  financial  technology  companies  to \nparticipate in the regulatory sandbox and detail the licensing and reporting requirements for equity \ncrowd funding.  \n \n22. \nPost-program partnership framework. The P3F provides for a structured dialogue over \nthe medium term and represents a tripartite partnership between ADB, the government, and OJK \nto advance finance sector reforms supported by ADB\u2019s technical assistance (TA).15 Key activities \nunder the P3F include the development of a geospatial financial services mobile application to \nenhance  access  to  finance  by  enabling  consumers  to  locate  the  agents  providing  branchless \nbanking, and the development of a 5-year financial technology road map. In addition, the P3F will \nfocus  on  youth  and  include  activities  such  as  the  development  of  a  national  youth  financial \ninclusion strategy to promote access to finance for youth between 16 and 30 years of age. \n \n23. \nfinance  sector \ndevelopment  recognizes  the  need  to  adopt  a  building-block  approach  based  on  sequential \ndevelopment of the sector. This approach allowed ADB to engage and channel critical support \nbased on the different stages and evolution of the sector (Figure 3). One of the most significant \nmilestones is the establishment of the OJK as a unified and independent regulator in 2012, which \ncan be traced back to ADB\u2019s assistance starting in 1999. ADB\u2019s assistance started by supporting \nthe basic legal requirements for Indonesia\u2019s finance sector covering all subsectors. This included \ndesigning  the  know  your  customer  rules  for  the  banking  sector,  developing  a  corporate \n\nADB  experience.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  with \n\nthe  government  on \n\n                                                \n15 Support for the PPPF will be provided through ADB. 2017.

This \nwas followed by focused support to develop the capital market by strengthening surveillance and \ndeveloping the primary dealer system for government debt securities. After OJK was established \nin 2012, the government requested ADB to focus on the institutional governance reforms of OJK \nand the coordination capacity of MOF. This was accomplished by developing OJK\u2019s technical and \nregulatory capacities as an independent and unified regulator. ADB also helped the government \ndevelop and coordinate finance sector policies through the newly established PKSK. Given the \nimportance of financial inclusion to reducing poverty and inequality, the FMDIP program began \nADB\u2019s engagement in financial inclusion. Looking ahead, ADB will continue focusing on reforms \nto  improve  access  to  financial  services  especially  through  financial  technology,  innovative \nfinancial  literacy  programs  and  stronger  consumer  protection.  ADB\u2019s  finance  sector  reform \nprograms complement ADB\u2019s other programs on public finance linked to sustainable development \ngoals and the investment climate.16 \n \n\nFigure 3: ADB\u2019s Engagement in Finance Sector Development in Indonesia \n\n2017\nSuprogram 2\nTA - Dedicated \nsupport for financial \ninclusion\n\n2015 \nFinancial Market \nDevelopment and \nInclusion Program, \nsubprogram 1\nTA - Support \ngovernment OJK \non finance sector \nreforms\n\n2012          \n\nFinancial \nDevelopment \nand \nIntegration \nProgram \n\n2007   \nCapital \nMarket \nDevelopment \nProgram \n\n2002 \nFinancial \nGovernance \nand Social \nSecurity \nProgram  \n\n2019 \nProposed \nsubprogram \n\n2021 \nDedicated financial \ninclusion sector \ndevelopment \nprogram (planned) \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  FI  =  financial  inclusion,  OJK  =  Otoritas  Jasa  Keuangan  (Financial  Services \nAuthority), TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \nLessons.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  finance  sector  has  informed  the  program  design \n24. \nthrough  four  key  lessons.  First,  developing  an  integrated  finance  sector  regulator  requires \nsequential  steps,  beginning  with  issuing  legislation,  and  providing  the  regulator  with  legal  and \nfiscal autonomy, as well as legal immunity to enable it to perform its supervisory function. ADB \nprovided support during the subprograms in setting up and operationalizing OJK as an integrated \nregulator. Second, even independent regulators require strong and coordinated support from the \ngovernment, especially for passing enabling legislation. The PKSK has taken the lead in providing \nsuch support.  Third, developing the capital market should be guided by a roadmap comprising \n\n                                                \n16 ADB.  2018.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Programmatic \nApproach and Policy-Based Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for Subprogram 2 of the Fiscal and Public Expenditure \nManagement  Program.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2018.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nboth supply-side and demand-side reforms.17 The FMDIP subprograms are anchored on OJK\u2019s \nconsolidated  masterplan,  and  supported  both  supply-side  (enabling  regulations)  and  demand-\nside (tax neutrality) reforms for the development of municipal bonds and corporate sukuk. Fourth, \nfinancial  inclusion,  literacy  and  consumer  protection  reforms  must  consider  advances  in \ntechnology.  While  financial  technology  provides  new  opportunities  to  enhance  access,  it  also \nposes its own challenges, especially in terms of regulation, supervision and consumer protection. \nTherefore, the development of financial technology requires not just specific product or service-\nlevel regulations but an overarching financial technology framework. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s value addition to the program  design and implementation. ADB\u2019s long-term \nengagement and structured policy dialogue with the government and OJK helped prioritize and \nsequence legal, policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms in support of an efficient, resilient, and \ninclusive finance sector. The TA associated with the programmatic approach has helped to ensure \nthat  policy  actions  are  well  formulated  and  coordinated  among  the  different  stakeholders,  and \nproperly  sequenced  in line  with best  practice,  local  context  and capacities.18   Through the TA, \nADB  supported  the  implementation  of  OJK\u2019s  consolidated  master  plan,  including  providing \ncapacity-building  support to  the  cross-sector  secretariat to  monitor  implementation  of the  plan. \nADB  also  helped  the  government  develop  Islamic  finance  through  an  analysis  of  the  tax \nimplications  of  corporate  sukuk,  based  on  surveys  and  engagements  with  the  private  sector \n(underwriters and issuers), and investors. ADB extended support at the subnational government \nlevel by helping the Central Java government prepare its first issuance of municipal bonds. ADB \nsupported the PKSK and OJK in several key areas, which included leveraging digital technology \nto  convert  financial  literacy  material  into  game-based  online  modules  for  students.  In  addition, \nADB\u2019s  assessment  of  the  role  of  digital  finance  directly  informed  several  policy  measures. 19 \nFinally, regional TA for capital market integration mapped OJK\u2019s corporate governance and green \nbond  regulations  against  international  standards,  including  the  ASEAN  Corporate Governance \nScorecard and the ASEAN Green Bond Standards, which were jointly launched by ADB and the \nASEAN Capital Market Forum.20 \n \n26. \nDevelopment partner coordination. Close coordination between ADB, the International \nMonetary Fund, the World Bank, and other development partners has resulted in programmatic \nsynergies  in  the  finance  sector.  Coordination  is  demonstrated  by  ADB\u2019s  support  to  implement \nselected  recommendations  from  the  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program  undertaken  by  the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Coordination for the program is based on the \ngovernment\u2019s process through PKSK. ADB supports the NCFI together with the World Bank and \nother development partners. The financial inclusion division of the PKSK, which ADB supports, \nleads the working group on policies and regulations. ADB also jointly reviews proposed revisions \nto national laws with development partners, including the World Bank and the Australia-Indonesia \nPartnership for Economic Development. Finally, ADB also coordinates with the advisor from the \nUnited States Department of the Treasury on public\u2013private partnership infrastructure projects, \nincluding developing the framework for necessary capital market products. \n \n \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 2017.

The \nsize of the finance  sector  as  a  percentage  of GDP  has grown  by  approximately  14% (2014 to \n2017). Access to financial services for the poorest 40% has improved from 22% in 2014 to 37% \nin 2017. Therefore, the DMF targets for 2020 have been revised upwards. The program impact \nassessment estimates that the potential net present value of benefits of the program ranges from \nabout $2.7 billion to $5.7 billion.21 Benefits are derived from reforms such as removal of VAT from \nsukuk, and reduction in government\u2019s cost of borrowing through financial stability. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe government has requested a single tranche loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 3.22 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years with straight-line repayment method; an annual interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement.  The  average  loan  maturity  is  9.25  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium \npayable to ADB. The loan size is based on Indonesia\u2019s financing needs, the development impact \nof the policy reform package, and development spending arising from the reforms. For 2019, the \ngovernment\u2019s projected total gross borrowing requirement is estimated at $59.6 billion. To finance \nthe  deficit,  the  government  plans  to  raise  approximately  $53.4  billion  from  the  issuance  of \nsecurities, and approximately $5.9 billion from official development assistance. \n \nE. \n \n29. \nThe  implementation  period  for  subprogram  3  is  from  April  2017  to  January  2019.  The \nFiscal Policy Agency in the MOF is the executing agency while OJK is the implementing agency. \nThe PKSK in coordination with OJK\u2019s International Department will monitor implementation of the \npolicy actions under the policy matrix. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n30. \nSafeguards.  Subprogram  3  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified as category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous people. \n \n31. \nPoverty and social. Subprogram 3 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming at \nentry.  One  of  the  key  components  of  the  program  concerns  enhancing financial  inclusion  and \nensuring improved access to finance for the poor; unbanked; and micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises. Women entrepreneurs face unique challenges because of limitations in time, mobility, \nand resources. OJK completed a diagnostic study on the role of financial technology for financing \nit  can  benefit  women \nof  micro,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \nmicroentrepreneurs.  The  assessment  provided  OJK  with  policy  recommendations  to  address \nchallenges faced by women in getting access to financial services. In addition, branchless banking \nbrings financial services to remote households and benefits women. The government and OJK \n\nincluding  how \n\n                                                \n21 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of link documents in Appendix 2). \n22 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nissued \n\nin  2017  mandating  coordination  between \n\nhave paid special attention to increasing access by and the literacy of women. OJK\u2019s targeted \nprograms for women have contributed to 51% of women having access to formal bank accounts. \nContinued efforts have also been made to enhance production of sex-disaggregated data through \nthe National Health Insurance and branchless banking information systems. \n \n32. \nGovernance.  In  2017,  Indonesia  scored  either  A  or  B  (both  considered  above  basic \nalignment with international good practice) on 17 out of 31 indicators in the World Bank\u2019s Public \nExpenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment Report.23 Indicators with particularly good \nassessment  results  include  transparency  of  public  finance,  and  accounting  and reporting.  The \nlegal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  public  financial  management  were  strengthened  by \ngovernment  regulations \nthe  National \nDevelopment  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  and  the  MOF  in  planning  and  budgeting.  ADB \nsupports  the  government\u2019s  governance  reform  through  its  Fiscal  and  Public  Expenditure \nManagement Program (footnote 16). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government. \n \nRisk and mitigating measures. Three key risks have been identified in the program. First \n33. \nis  macroeconomic  risk,  particularly  in  relation  to  tighter  global  financial  conditions.  This  is \nmitigated  by  Indonesia\u2019s  sound  macroeconomic  fundamentals,  and  appropriate  monetary  and \nfiscal policies. Second, changes in Indonesia\u2019s political economy may slow the pace of reform; \nthis risk is mitigated by OJK\u2019s legal and operational independence from the government, with its \ncommissioners being only in the second year of their 5-year terms. Finally, the risk of insufficient \ncoordination  on finance sector reforms  may affect  the  pace  and quality of  reforms.  In financial \ninclusion, this risk is mitigated by the establishment of the NCFI in 2017 to coordinate all financial \ninclusion activities. In addition, reforms on stability and capital market development are closely \ncoordinated between OJK and PKSK in the MOF. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n34. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the  loan \nagreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n35. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $500,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  3  of  the  Financial  Market \nDevelopment  and  Inclusion  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  regular  terms, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n5 March 2019\n\n                                                \n23 World Bank. 2017.
