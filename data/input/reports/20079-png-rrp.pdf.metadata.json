The proposed\nloan has a term of 20 years, including a grace period of three years, at\nan interest rate determined in accordance with Bank's pool-based variable\nlending rate system, and a commitment charge of 0.75 per cent in\naccordance with the current Bank policy.\n\nAt the request of the Government of the Independent State of\n2.\nPapua New Guinea (PNG), a technical assistance was provided by the Bank\nin November 1986 for a feasibility study for the proposed Project. 1/ The\nfinal report of the study was submitted to the Bank by the consultant,\nMacdonald Wagner, Australia, in June 1988. After the Government confirmed\nthe need for the Project during the High-Level talks held in Manila in\nDecember 1988, a Fact-Finding Mission was fielded in February 1989 to\ndiscuss with the Government and the Executing Agency the scope of the\nproposed Project as well as the financing and implementation arrangements.\nFrom 4-12 April 1989 a Bank Appraisal Mission visited PNG and confirmed\nthat the Government accorded high priority to the Project and that it was\nsuitable for Bank financing. Formal loan negotiations with authorized\nrepresentatives of the Government and the Executing Agency were held in\nManila from 30 to 31 May 1989. If approved, the proposed loan will be\nthe Bank's twentyninth loan to PNG and the fifth loan for the power\nsubsector in the country.\n\nI. THE ECONOMY\n\nAn Economic Survey of PNG (Report No. PNG: EC-5s) was circulated\n3.\nto the Board of Directors in September 1987. Also a Board Information\nPaper entitled \"Papua New Guinea: Economic Review and Bank Operations\"\n(Report No. EBO PNG 89006) was circulated in June 1989.\n\nA.\t\n\nThe Energy Sector and the Power Subsector\n\n1.\t\n\nThe Energy Sector\n\nSituated about 160 km north of Australia and with a land area\n4.\nof 461,700 sq km, PNG comprises the eastern half of the New Guinea island\nand about 600 offshore islands. With a population of around 3.7 million\n(mid-1988), the country is sparsely inhabited with a population density\nof only eight persons per sq km. PNG is a land of great geographical\n\n1/\n\nTA No. 823-PNG: Luwini (Divune) Hydropower, approved on 27 November\n1986 in the amount of '$150,000.\n\n\t\n\t\n\f2\n\ndiversity with high mountains ) volcanoes, many rivers and low-lying\nswamps. The country is marked by rugged terrain rendering a large part\nof the highlands inaccessible and thereby resulting in fragmented small\npopulation centers in the hinterlands, often completely isolated from each\nother. Therefore, development of large hydropower resources has not been\nviable, and so far only 189 MW, or a little over one per cent of the\nabundant hydropower potential estimated at over 14,000 MW, has been\ndeveloped. Furthermore, most of the hydropower projects in operation are\nrun-of-the-river power stations with very little firm energy potential.\n\nSignificant oil and gas discoveries have been made in various\n5.\nparts of the country. PNG's hydrocarbon reserves are estimated at about\n18 trillion cubic feet of gas, 167 million barrels of condensates and 270\nmillion barrels of oil. Part of these reserves are being developed for\npower generation for new gold mines as well as for export. PNG has also\na significant biotnass potential with forests covering about 33 million\nhectares. Surface manifestations of geothermal energy have been observed\nin several parts of the country, and coal deposits have been reported in\nthe Gulf and Morobe provinces, but so far no serious attempts have been\nmade to inventory and exploit these resources because of the anticipated\nhigh development costs.\n\nThe energy sector of PNG has developed alongside the various\n6.\nenclaves, notably in the two major ones, viz. Bougainville Copper Limited\n(BCL) in Bougainville island (North Solomons Province), and the Ok Tedi\nMine in the north-western part of the mainland (Western Province), which\ntogether in 1987 accounted for about 35 per cent of the country's total\ncommercial energy consumption. However, both these enclaves are isolated\nfrom the country's other major demand centers, and while most of the\npopulation has little or no access to commercial energy, some 15 per cent\nof the population in the modern sector account for about 60 per cent of\ntotal energy consumed.\n\nThe total primary energy consumption in 1987 was estimated at\n7.\nabout 1.6 million tons of oil equivalent. Of this, petroleum products\naccounted for about 55 per cent, non-commercial fuels (mainly fuel wood)\nfor 37 per cent, and hydropower for eight per cent. At present, 87 per\ncent of the commercial energy needs are met by oil products and the\nbalance of 13 per cent by hydropower generation. All oil products to date\nhave been imported, at a cost in 1986 of K 83.30 million, representing\nmore than nine per cent of the country's total imports and equivalent to\n8.3 per cent of the export earnings in that year.\n\n2.\t\n\nThe Power Subsector\n\nElectric power in the country is provided through: (i) the\n8.\nfacilities of ELCOM, supplying electricity to most of the domestic,\ncommercial and industrial consumers; (ii) Government owned power supply\nfacilities (based mostly on small diesel generating units) in remote areas\nfor providing limited power supply to important rural centers (\"C\"\ncenters); and (iii) privately owned captive generating plants. Of the\nabout 548 NW installed generating capacity in the power subsector by the\n\n\f3\n\nend of 1988, 200 MW (36.5 per cent) were owned by ELCOM, 8 MW (1.5 per\ncent) by the Government and 340 MW (62 per cent) by the private sector.\n\nAt present, ELCOM is serving 26 urban centers through 18\n9.\nindependent power systems, and of its total installed generating capacity\nby end 1988 (200 MW), hydropower accounted for 130 MW (65 per cent),\ndiesel for 55 MW (27 per cent) and gas turbines for 15 MW (8 per cent).\nELCOM's transmission and distribution systems comprise 880 kin of htgh\nvoltage lines, about 2,000 km of medium voltage and 1,000 km of low-\nvoltage lines, as well as distribution transformers with a total capacity\nof about 285 MVA. In 1988, ELCOM generated 555 GWh and purchased 55 GWh\nfrom the private sector, with sales in that year totalling 547 GWb. The\nsystem energy losses were about 10 per cent.\n\nDuring the last ten years, the annual load growth averaged five\n10.\nper cent, with a decline in the early 1980s, mainly due to capacity\ndeficits in the system as well as the unreliability of power supply\nbecause of the inadequacy of the transmission systems. This resulted in\nconsiderable suppressed demand in ELCOM's systems and a significant\nIncrease in captive generation. With the Improvements In the subsequent\nyears, and with the planned addition to the generating capacity and\nreinforcement of the transmission systems, ELCOM's energy sales are\nprojected to increase from 589 GWh in 1989 to 982 GWh by 1998. After an\nexpected load Increase in 1991 and 1992 of 12.6 per cent and 11.2 per\ncent, respectively, due to the incidence of a large load (viz, the Hidden\nValley gold mine), the annual growth rate Is conservatively projected at\nabout 3.6 per cent over the following years. However, in view of the\nstill low level of consumption, the suppressed load demand and the various\ndevelopment programs recently Initiated by the Government (see paras. 19-\n20), this forecast might be an underestimate, particularly in the longer\ntime frame.\n\nDespite supply constraints and unreliable supply due to the\n11.\nageing of the existing diesel units, ELCOM's energy sales in the Project\narea (Popondetta) have grown from 2.92 GWh in 1981 to 4.47 GWh in 1988.\nAs a result of the proposed Project, which envisages also the connection\nof various settlements, a number of saw mills and other large loads, most\nof which have their own captive power plants, electricity sales in the\nProject area are projected to increase to 8.45 GWh in 1992, the first year\nof operation of the Project. Thereafter, the sales are projected to\nincrease at an average rate of about 3.6 per cent per annum.\n\nB.\t\n\nGovernment's Development Plan and Sectoral Strateg1\n\nGovernment's most recent Development Plan (Economic Policy and\n12.\nFiscal Strategy) for the period 1989-1993, which was approved by\nParliament in December 1988 along with the 1989 budget, has the following\nobjectives: (I) the achievement of sustained economic growth, based on\nthe country's abundant natural resources; (ii) the creation of income-\nearning employment opportunities particularly in rural areas; (iii) the\nestablishment of fiscal self-reliance; and (iv) the reduction of social\nTo achieve these medium-term development\nand economic Inequalities. \t\n\n\fobjectives, the Government is pursuing the following strategies: to\n(i) improve its resource allocation by redirecting expenditure away from\nconsumption towards investment projects in the economic and infrastructure\nsectors; (ii) improve the effectiveness of resource management;\n(iii) increase the effectiveness and improve the management of external\nassistance; and (iv) promote and support private sector investment\ninitiatives.\n\nAlong with the Development Plan and the 1989 budget, the\n13.\nParliament also approved a Public Investment Program (PIP) for the years\n1989-1993, which anticipates total expenditures of about K 1,557 million\n($1,790 million) over the Plan period. In line with above-mentioned\ndevelopment objectives, the bulk of investments will be in the\ninfrastructure sector, including those of the Commercial Statutory\nAuthorities (CSAs) in the fields of electricity, ports, post and\ntelecommunications, and national water supply and sewerage, with an amount\nof K 675.9 million or about 43.4 per cent of total budget allocations.\nOf the overall allocations for CSAs in the amount of K 223.6 million (or\n14.35 per cent of total investments), about K 132.5 million have been\nallocated for ELCOM, including provisions for the proposed Project.\n\nThe main objective of the Government's energy policy is to\n14.\nreduce dependence on imported fuels through the development of domestic,\npreferably renewable, energy resources. However, despite the country's\nvast hydropower and hydro-carbon resources, there are several practical\nconstraints in their development, due to the low domestic demand for\nenergy and the geographical fragmentation of the energy market with a\nconcentration of commercial energy consumption in isolated mining and\nurban enclaves.\n\nAfter having initially emphasized the role of unconventional\n15.\nenergy resources like ethanol, wood pyrolysis, solar and photo voltaic\nenergy for transport, industrial and household purposes, and having to\nsome extent neglected the conventional energy resources, the Government,\nsince 1982, has placed more emphasis on the electricity subsector which\naccounts for 44 per cent of total consumption of petroleum products, and\nwhere options are at hand for the substitution of imported oil used in\npower generation. Thus, the focus of the Government's energy strategy in\nthe power subsector has been reoriented towards developing the country's\nvast hydropower resources for displacing imported oil. The Government's\npresent policy regarding indigenous gas resources is restricted to\ndeveloping them to displace imported oil-based generation in cases where\nthere is no export market for the product.\n\nThe scattered islands and the rugged, and In some places\n16.\ninaccessible, mountain ranges on the mainland eliminate any possibility\nof full integration of ELCOM's power system. As a result, and despite the\ncountry's vast and cheap hydropower resources, it is only possible to\ndevelop medium and mini potential sites commensurate with the relatively\nlow demand levels in the isolated systems. The only exception is the\ninterconnection of the Ramu and Port Moresby systems, which provides an\nopportunity for achieving economies of scale with regard to future\n\n\f5\n\nhydropower projects on the mainland. A recent study indicates that such\nan interconnection is unlikely to become economically viable until the\nlatter part of the 1990s.\n\nIn the past, poor reliability of power supply has resulted in\n17.\nextensive growth of diesel-based captive power generation. The Government\nand ELCOM are therefore placing considerable emphasis on improving the\nreliability of supply along with the development of hydropower resources,\nso that those with uneconomic diesel-based captive power plants will\nconvert to utility supply. The tariff policy is also designed to\ndiscourage such captive generation, and consumers of ELCOM with captive\npower plants are thus required to pay 50 per cent standby charges.\n\n18.\nThe vast majority of PNG's population (about 85 per cent) live\nin rural areas. There are about 90 isolated villages (\"C\" centers) and\n40 institutional centers (mainly hospitals) where electricity is supplied\nby small diesel generating units, with the stations being administered by\nthe Government. These \"C\" centers are the only source of public\nelectricity supply in key centers in rural areas with commercial, health,\neducational and administrative institutions serving the surrounding areas.\nHowever, the cost of extending electricity supply to rural areas in most\nparts of PNG is high due to the long distances, difficult terrain and low\nload density. As ELCOM's investment decisions are based on strict\nfinancial criteria (10 per cent FIRR and EIRR in real terms), its\noperations are largely confined to urban centers. The Government, because\nof resource constraints, has decided not to increase the number of \"C\"\ncenters and has requested ELCOM to study viable options for providing\nelectricity in rural areas. A recent study carried out by consultants\nindicates that for such purpose it would be necessary to modify ELCOM's\nurban-oriented technical standards for developing more cost-effective\ndesigns for rural distribution. The recommendations of the consultants\nas well as the financial and policy implications of undertaking a large-\nscale rural electrification program are currently being reviewed by the\nGovernment and ELCOM.\n\nSince 1985, the Government has also been pursuing a \"Diesel\n19.\nPower Displacement Program\" for developing micro-hydropower sites to\ndisplace diesel-based generation in \"C\" centers with a view to reducing\nthe supply costs and improving the quality of electricity supply. Under\nthe program, which was to be implemented over a five-year period with an\nestimated cost of K 10 million, it was envisaged to develop 10 mIni-\nhydroelectric schemes and two transmission line schemes, to prepare\nfeasibility studies for future sites and to provide for training.\nHowever, because of the high development costs and low financial returns\nthe Government has been relying mainly on grant-financing of the program,\nand so far only one site has been developed (with EEC funding), and two\nmore sites are expected to be completed in 1989.\n\nIn early 1989, the Government also initiated a \"Rural Energy\n20.\nDevelopment Program\", whose main objectives are: to (I) introduce\ndomestic renewable energy sources to rural areas, viz, solar, wind and\nbiomass; (ii) further reduce dependence on imported fuels; and (iii) to\n\n\f6\n\nmeet the basic energy needs of rural communities through appropriate\ntechnologies. Initially, it is intended to establish a nation wide data\nbase for the renewable energy resource potential, conduct a technical and\neconomic evaluation of previous and present renewable energy projects and,\ndepending on the availability of funds, to implement projects aimed at\nproviding for the basic energy needs of the rural coinnitinities.\n\nC.\t\n\nInstitutional Framework and Executing Agency\n\n1.\t\n\nDepartment of Minerals and Energy\n\n21. The Department of Minerals and Energy (DOME) is responsible for\nthe assessment and development of the country's mineral and energy\nresources, the issuance and monitoring of mining and petroleum licenses,\nthe formulation of national energy policies and the implementation of\nselected renewable energy projects. Within DOME, the Energy Planning Unit\n(EPU), established in 1978 to assist the Government in its efforts to\ndiversify the sources of energy, has the responsibility for energy\nplanning. So far, EPU has mainly provided advice on key energy projects,\ninitiated the compilation and collection of sector-related data, and\npromoted the use of renewable energy resources.\n\n2.\t\n\nThe PNG Electricity Commission (ELCOM)\n\n22.\nEstablished under the PNG Electricity Commission Act of 1961,\nELCOM became a Commercial Statutory Authority (CSA) in October 1983.\nUnder the policy framework established by the Government for CSAs, ELCOM\nis responsible for the planning, construction, operation an maintenance\nof public electricity supply throughout the country, as well as for the\nefficient management of its power supply facilities, its investments, and\nits borrowings directly or through the Government from domestic and\ninternational capital markets. Regarding the structure and level of its\ntariffs, ELCOM, as a CSA, is subject to the approval by the Government's\nPrice Controller, who is the Secretary of the Department of Finance and\nPlanning (DOFP).\n\n23.\nAlthough responsibility for ELCOM is vested in the Minister for\nMinerals and Energy, government control and supervision is exercised\nprimarily through ELCOM's Board of Commissioners. The Board consists of\nthe Secretary of DOME (as Chairman), one member each of the DOFP and the\nDepartment of Lands and Physical Planning (DOLPP), and four members\nrepresenting private enterprises. Headed by a General Manager, ELCOM's\norganizational structure consists of four main departments, viz.\nAdministration, Commercial, Operations and Engineering, and three offices\n(provincial management and two special project offices). A Corporate\nSecretary is in charge of safety, internal audit, public relations and the\nBoards administration units. The General. Manager, the Deputy General\nManager, the four Department Heads, and the Corporate Secretary constitute\nthe top management of ELCOM, being responsible for the Implementation of\nthe policy directives and all operational matters. The area managers In\neach of the 26 urban centers are also responsible for the operation and\nmaintenance of the electricity generation units at the Government centers\n\n\f7\n\n(\"C\" centers) in their respective areas. ELCOM's organization structure\nis considered adequate for Its current and future functional requirements.\n\nDuring the 1980s, ELCOM made significant efforts to improve its\n24.\norganizational, structure, its staff's technical skills in power system\noperations and maintenance, and financial and Information systems. In\nthese efforts ELCOM was assisted, among others, through a Bank financed\ntechnical assistance for the enhancement of ELCOM's accounting, financial\nand management information systems and procedures !/, and through a human\nresources development project financed by IBRD in conjunction with the\nYonki Hydroelectric Project loan. Since mid-1980s, ELCOM has been\nstriving to rationalize its staffing, which resulted in the reduction of\nits workforce by 17 per cent from 2,316  in 1984 to 1,928 in 1988. The\nnumber of expatriate staff has been reduced from 136 in 1986 to 120 in\n1988, with further reductions envisaged in line with the Government's\npolicy guidelines for the public service.\n\nELCOM has progressively computerized its commercial operations,\n25.\nand with the Bank's technical assistance for the institutional study (see\npara. 24), completed its accounting and financial planning system in 1987,\nwhich is now considered adequate and in conformity with modern power\nutility procedures and practices and international accounting standards.\n'ntil 1981 the external audit was performed by the Auditor General's\nOffice, and since then, due to staff constraints, by external auditors,\nwhose reports are reviewed and certified by the Auditor General. ELCOM\nhas so far complied with Bank's covenants regarding the timely submission\nof its audited annual accounts to the Bank.\n\nIn January 1982, the Government had implemented regional cost-\n26.\nbased tariffs, which closely followed the recommendations of a Bank-\nfinanced tariff study. 2/ However, due to equity considerations and since\nelectricity sales in the higher cost diesel generation centers comprised\nonly 10 per cent of ELCOM's total sales, the Government subsequently\nreintroduced a uniform national tariff. The present tariff structure is\nconsidered to be generally satisfactory. ELCOM is required to inform the\nBank promptly of any proposed changes in its tariffs.\n\nSince 1982, ELCOM's financial performance has been satisfactory,\n27.\nand its revenues from energy sales increased until 1987 at a rate of about\n7 per cent per annum, mainly due to an annual increase of 5.3 per cent in\nenergy sales. The total operating expenses increased from K 35.7 million\nin 1982 to K 46.0 million in 1987, representing likewise an annual\nincrease of 5.3 per cent, but still less than the average annual inflation\nrate of 6 per cent over the period.\n\n1/\t\n\nTA No. 559-PNG: Institutional Study of PNG Electricity Commission,\napproved on 5 December 1983 in the amount of $250,000.\n\n2/ TA No. 307-PNG: Electricity Tariff Review, approved on 27 September\n\n1979 in the amount of $70,000.\n\n\f8\n\nUnder the Bank's (and IBRD's) existing loans, ELCOM agreed to\n28.\nset its tariffs so as to achieve a 10 per cent rate of return (ROR) on\nhistorically valued net fixed assets in operation, as well as to maintain\na debt-service ratio (DSR) of at least 1.5 times and a self-financing\nratio (SFR) of at least 30 per cent. Despite being subject, since 1983,\nto a 35 per cent income tax, and paying dividends to the Government at a\nrate of about 7 per cent on its equity capital since 1984, ELCOM has still\nbeen able to comply with all of the Bank's financial loan covenants in the\npast. However, in the absence of further Government equity infusion since\n1985, ELCOM had to depend mainly on debt-financing for its capital\nexpansion, resulting in an increase of the ratio of total debt to equity\ncapital from 48:52 in 1982 to 58:42 as of end of 1987, which, however, is\nstill considered acceptable. Based on ELCOM's financial forecast for the\nyears 1989-1998, the debt to equity ratio is expected to decrease by the\nend of the period to 41:59. During 1988-1998, ELCOM's profitability,\ndebt-service capability and capital structure are expected to be\nmaintained at satisfactory levels, and to enable ELCOM to comply with the\nBank's financial covenants, except for a slightly lower than covenanted\nself-financing ratio in 1988 and 1989, mainly due to the higher than\nanticipated level of expenditure for the Yonki Dam Project as a result of\nchange of design of the project.\n\nELCOM's current ten-year plan (1989-1998) envisages the addition\n29.\nof about 166 MW of generating capacity including 93 MW of hydropower\ncapacity - 60 MW at the Port Moresby hydropower project, 30 MW at the\nYonki Hydroelectric project (expected to be completed in 1991), and 3 MW\nat the proposed Project. The ten-year plan anticipates total capital\nexpenditures of about K 413 million (In constant 1988 prices), with the\nbulk of foreign exchange cost expected to be provided by multilateral\nbanks such as the Bank, IBRD and the European Investment Bank (EIB),\nbilateral aid primarily from OECF, and commercial banks. Financing of\nlocal currency cost is expected to come mainly from ELCOM's internal cash\nresources.\n\nTo meet the substantial debt-service requirements and to provide\n30.\nadequate funds for the sizeable capital expansion program envisaged under\nits current ten-year plan, ELCON needs to increase its tariffs at about\n6.0 per cent per annum. However, a more realistic assessment of future\ntariff increases is expected to be available on completion of the Power\nSystem Planning Study to be shortly undertaken by ELCOM (see para. 31).\n\nRecent developments have significantly altered the basic\n31.\nplanning assumptions on which ELCOM's present ten-year plan is based.\nThese include: (i) the programs recently initiated by the Government for\naccelerated development of non-mineral industries, fisheries and agro-\nbased industries, dispersal of economic growth centers, and for increased\nassistance to the private sector, all of which will have a significant\nimpact on the load growth; (ii) the actual and potential discoveries of\non-shore and off-shore oil and gas reserves; and (iii) the lower-than-\nanticipated prices of imported oil in recent years. Based on these\ndevelopments there is an urgent need for a systematic planning study for\nall ELCOM systems with updated data so that future investments in system\n\n\f9\n\nexpansion will be optimized. This will be addressed by a recently\napproved Bank technical assistance 1/, which also provides for the further\nupgrading of ELCOM's institutional capabilities in system planning through\ntraining and technology transfers.\n\nD.\t\n\nExternal Assistance for the Energy Sector\n\nAs of 31 March 1989, PNG has received external assistance for\n32.\nthe energy sector totalling about $255.7 million, comprising about $242.3\nmillion in loans and about $13.4  In grants. The loans focussed primarily\non the development of ELCOM's hydropower projects, with nearly 50 per cent\n(about $126.2 million) having been provided for the Yonki Hydroelectric\nProject. Grants were provided mainly for feasibility studies, non-\nconventional energy resources, advisory technical assistance projects and\nequipment. Multilateral assistance was provided by IBRD ($63.5 million),\nthe Bank ($35.9 million) and EIB/EEC ($21.0 million). Among bilateral\ndonors Japan (OECF) ranks first with about $113.0 million, followed by the\nCommonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) with $13.0 million, Norway\n($7.75 million), Australia ($ 1 . 1 7 million) and New Zealand ($0.25\nmillion). Details of the external assistance are set out in Appendix 1.\n\nII. BANK OPERATIONS IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA\n\nA Board Information Paper providing general information on\n33.\noverall Bank Operations in PNG was circulated to the Board of Directors\nin June 1989 (see para. 3).\n\nA.\t\n\nBank's Operational Strategy\n\nThe primary development objective of the Government is to\n34.\npromote income growth and employment generation with the strengthening\nand bro&dening of domestic resource-based production capacities (see para.\n12). This translates in PNG into a continuing emphasis on agriculture,\nwhere the bulk of economic activities takes place. In view of this, and\nin line with Bank's \"lead role\" in the sector, the Bank will give greater\nattention to broadening the agricultural base through diversification and\nintensification in the treecrops and foodcrops subsectors and to the\ndevelopment of the livestock, forestry and fisheries subsectors. While\nthe manufacturing sector is still at a early stage of development, the\nBank will, to the extent possible, assist in the country's\nindustrialization process, focussing on agro-industries and on small-and\nmedium-scale enterprises, and Indirectly assist private sector industrial\nprojects through the development of industrial estates. In social\ninfrastructure, the Bank will continue its prominent role in the health\nsubsector and will also continue its involvement in the urban water supply\nand sewerage subsectors to improve the living conditions of the increasing\nurban population of the country. Since substantial assistance from other\n\n1/\t\n\nTA No. 1131-PNG:\t\nFebruary 1989 in the amount of $515,000.\n\nPower System Planning Study, approved on 27\n\n\f10\n\ndonors is available for the education subsector, mostly on highly\nconcessional terms, the Bank's role in this area will be only\ncomplementary, likewise in the urban infrastructure and housing\nsubsectors.\n\nRegarding the development of physical infrastructure, a critical\n35.\nrequirement for the socio-economic integration of the country, the Bank\nhas, in the past, played an important role In the power, roads, and ports\nsubsectors through sector studies, Investment projects and related\ninstitutional strengthening. Within the sector, about 12 per cent of\nBank's total lending to the country and about 17 per cent of its technical\nassistance have been provided to the power subsector (see para. 36). In\nline with Government's medium-term Investment program for the subsector\n(see para. 13), and in accordance with Its energy policy, which aims to\nharness the energy potential of the country and provide adequate and\nreliable power supply to meet the country's development needs, the Bank\nwill continue its involvement in the subsector on a selective basis, among\nothers through the proposed Project. Other areas of Bank assistance\ninclude manpower development, institutional support and contributing to\nincreasing the country's absorptive capacity.\n\nB.\t\n\nBank Assistance to the Power Subsector\n\nSince 1977, the Bank has provided four loans totalling $34.6\n36.\nmillion for the power subsector in PNG. Three of the loans were for\nhydropower projects, one of which (the Upper Warangoi Hydropower Project\n(Loan Nos. 414/415 (SF)-PNG)), was co-financed by OECF ($14.5 million) and\nNorway ($7.75 million). In addition, technical assistance has been\nprovided for six projects with a total amount of $1.308 million,\ncomprising two PPTAs and four AOTAs, the latter focussing mainly on power\nplanning, tariffs and institutional strengthening (for details see\nAppendix 2).\n\nThe implementation of the Upper Warangoi Hydropower Project, the\n37.\nonly project so far completed and post-evaluated, has been satisfactory.\nThe post-evaluation of the project concluded that the project had been\nsuccessfully completed with only a minor delay and a modest cost overrun.\nFollow-up action was recommended in the PPAR to increase the energy sales\nby providing special tariffs to potential industrial consumers and\nimproving the power supply reliability. In line with these\nrecommendations, ELCOM reintroduced industrial tariffs which had been\nsuspended in 1981, and the proposed Project will contribute to Improving\nsupply reliability.\n\nDelays, however, were experienced in the implementation of the\n38.\nProvincial Mini-Hydropower Project (Loan No. 318-PNG) and the Ramu Grid\nReinforcement Project (Loan No. 805-PNG). Of the four schemes originally\ncomprising the Provincial Mini-Hydropower Project two were delayed due to\nthe unavailability of suitable local construction plant and equipment,\nand were commissioned only in 1981 and 1982, respectIvely. Because of the\nresulting cost overrun, the viability of the remaining two schemes was re-\nevaluated by ELCOM, and one of the schemes was cancelled, whereas\n\n\f11\n\nimplementation of the remaining one resumed in 1986, with completion now\nenvisaged for September 1989. Due to frequent changes in the decision on\nthe source of power supply for the Porgera mining complex, the Ramu Grid\nReinforcement Project was also delayed. However, the implementation of\nthe Project was resumed in May 1988, when the Porgera power supply was\nfinalized. The contract for the major project component, the Ramu-Goroka-\nMt. Hagen 132 kV transmission line, has since been awarded and the line\nis now scheduled to be completed in mid-1991.\n\nSome of the earlier delays were caused by external factors\n39.\t\nbeyond the control of ELCOM. However, the proposed Project is well\nprepared, with the tender documents for civil and electro-mechanical works\nproposed to be finalized and issued in July 1989, subject to Board\napproval of the proposed Project (see para. 51). Also, the land\nacquisition process, in other projects frequently the cause for prolonged\ndelays, is scheduled to be completed in mid-1989 (see para. 49). Thus,\nthe Implementation delays which occurred in earlier Bank-financed power\nprojects in the country, are not expected with the proposed Project.\n\nIII. THE PROJECT\n\n40.\nin Papua New Guinea' (Report No. LAP:PNG-20079) is circulated herewith.\n\nA report entitled \"Appraisal of the Divune Hydropower Project\n\nA.\t\n\nProject Objectives, Scope and Description\n\nThe main objectives of the proposed Project are to displace the\n41.\nhigh-cost imported diesel-based power generation in Popondetta (Oro-\nProvince) with lower-cost indigenous, renewable and reliable hydropower\nand to extend the power supply facilities to other important load centers\nin the area. Popondetta is the administrative and commercial center of\nthe province, which has a total population of about 97,200 people. Of\nthis, about 17,190 are living in the Popondetta district, including 8,000\nin the township. The economy of the district is primarily based on\nagriculture and timber, with major crops being cocoa, coconut and oil\npalm, and minor crops including coffee, cardamom and chillies. Efforts\nare being made by the Government to broaden the economic base of the area\nby encouraging cattle farming in the district, which has also some agro-\nand timber based industrial enterprises like saw-mills, agro-processing\nplants etc.\n\nAt present, Popondetta is provided with 24-hour power supply\n42.\nfrom ELCOM's diesel power station with a total installed capacity of\n1,780 kW. However, the units are old and have an aggregate site rating\nof only 1,400 kW. Some smaller settlements in the district have also\naccess to limited power supply through small diesel units, and, in\naddition, some of the larger plantations and industries have their own\ncaptive power plants. Based on two consultant studies, carried out in\n1984 and 1988, the development of the Divune (Luwini) creek with a 3 MW\nhydropower station, is considered to be the least cost power supply option\nfor the Popondetta area. The design and detailed engineering for the\n\n\fproposed Project were completed in February 1989.\n\n12\n\n43. The proposed Project will have the following components:\n(1) the construction of a hydropower station with two units of 1.5 MW each\nand associated civil works; (ii) the construction of about 85 km of 22 kV\nlines with associated step-down transformer substations for transmitting\nthe hydropower to the various load centers in the Project area; and\n(iii) consulting services for engineering assistance during the\nconstruction phase.\n\nB.\t\n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan\n\n44. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $12.29 million,\nof which $8.43 million (69 per cent) is the foreign exchange cost,\nincluding $1.0 million for interest and other charges during construction\n(IDC) on the Bank loan. The local currency cost is estimated at $3.86\nmillion (31 per cent), including taxes and duties. These cost estimates\nare based on early 1989 prices and include appropriate provisions for\nphysical and price contingencies.\n\n45. It is proposed that the Bank provides a loan of $8.43 million,\nrepresenting about 69 per cent of total Project cost, which will finance\nthe entire foreign exchange cost of the Project including IDC on the Bank\nloan. The local currency cost of about $3.86 million equivalent will be\nmet out of ELCOM's own resources. The proposed Bank loan will be from\nthe Bank's ordinary capital resources (OCR), with interest to be\ndetermined in accordance with the Bank's pool-based variable lending rate,\nand a commitment charge of 0.75 per cent per annum in accordance with the\nBank's current policy. The loan would have a repayment period of twenty\nyears, including a grace period of three years. The Borrower would be the\nIndependent State of Papua New Guinea. The Borrower would relend the\nproceeds of the loan to ELCOM as the Executing Agency under a subsidiary\nloan agreement with a relending rate set at the standard rate applicable\nto CSAs in PNG (currently 10.35 per cent per annum), but not less than the\nOCR rate of the Bank at the time of the loan approval by the Bank. 1/ The\nBorrower would bear the foreign exchange risk. These terms and conditions\nare deemed to be appropriate, taking into consideration the economic life\nof the Project and its implementation period.\n\nC.\t\n\nProject Implementation\n\n1.\t\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n46.\t\nThe Executing Agency for the proposed Project will be ELCOM (see\nparas. 22 to 31). ELCOM has substantial experience in implementing\nsimilar projects financed by multilateral and bilateral donors, including\nthose of the Bank (see paras. 32 and 36), and is considered suitable to\nimplement the proposed Project. \t\nELCOM will designate an engineer\n\n1/\t\n\nThe same re-lending conditions applied for Loan No. 805-PNG: Ramu\nGrid Reinforcement Project, approved in November 1986.\n\n\f13\n\nacceptable to the Bank as Project Manager for providing coordination\nbetween ELCOM, the consultants and contractors. The Project Manager will\nbe assisted by adequate and qualified staff. ELCON will also be\nresponsible for construction supervision and contract management.\n\n2.\t\n\nConsulting Services\n\n47.\t\nIt is estimated that about two man-months of consulting services\nwould be required for engineering assistance during the construction phase\nof the Project. It is proposed that in the interest of timely and\neconomic Project implementation and in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, the consultant who was responsible\nfor the final feasbility studies and detailed engineering of the Project\nbe retained for providing these services.\n\n3.\t\n\nProcurement\n\n48. Procurement of goods and services to be financed from the\nproceeds of the proposed Bank loan will be carried out by ELCOM in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. For the civil\nworks and the electro-mechanical works components of the Project,\ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures will be adopted.\nBecause of the estimated small contract values, international shopping\n(IS) procedures will be applied for the transmission component. For this\npurpose, four packages for procurement have been identified, namely:\n(1) conductors and accessories; (ii) 22 kV transformers; (iii) poles; and\n(iv) electrical hardware including insulators. While the construction of\nthe civil works and the electro-mechanical works are proposed to be\nundertaken by contractors, with the latter on supply-and-erect basis, the\n22 kV system is proposed to be constructed by ELCOM, which has developed\nthe requisite technical expertise for such undertaking.\n\n4.\t\n\nLand Acquisition and Right-of-Way\n\nThe land survey for the proposed Project has already been\n49.\t\ncompleted and the land owners identified. In view of the expected\nbenefits the land owner's response to the Project is reportedly favorable,\nwith the DLOPP currently assessing the appropriate compensation amount.\nAlthough the land acquisition process is presently envisaged to be\ncompleted by August 1989, due to the importance of timely acquisition of\nall lands, right over land and water and other property rights for\nimplementing the Project as per schedule, the completion of land\nacquisition has been stipulated as a condition for the award of the first\ncontract for civil works.\n\n5.\t\n\nReports, Accounts and Audit\n\n50. ELCON will maintain separate accounts for all goods and services\nfinanced from the proceeds of the Bank loan and will have these accounts\naudited annually by its external auditors. The audited accounts and the\nrelated financial statements, after appropriate review and certification\nby the Auditor General's Office, will be submitted to the Bank, in the\n\n\f14\n\nEnglish language, not later than nine months after the end of the\nrespective fiscal year. ELCOM will also give the Bank quarterly progress\nreports on the execution of the Project, and will submit a project\ncompletion report not later than three months after the completion of the\nProject.\n\n6.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nSubject to the approval of the proposed Project by the Bank, the\n51.\t\ntender documents for the civil works and electro-mechanical works are\nproposed to be finalized and issued in July 1989. The respective\ncontracts are scheduled to be awarded by January 1990 and the civil works\n(including the construction of the access road) to be completed within two\nyears. The Project is expected to be commissioned in early 1992.\n\n7.\n\nOp eration and Maintenance\n\n52.\nELCOM will be responsible for the appropriate operation and\nmaintenance (0&M) of the Project. ELCOM has considerable experience in\nO&M of small and medium-sized hydropower plants and 22 kV systems, and\nthe electro-mechanical tender for the Project also provides for training\nof selected ELCOM staff by the supplier in the specific skills required\nfor 0&M of the units supplied. With these additional inputs, ELCOM's\nexisting O&M organization and staffing is considered adequate for\noperating and maintaining the power plant and the transmission system\ncovered under the Project.\n\nD.\t\n\nEnvironmental Aspects\n\nThe catchment area of the proposed Project is uncultivated and\n53.\nis expected to remain so due to the steepness and ruggedness of the\nterrain. The exuberant rain forest provides good protection to the soil\nand no signs of soil erosion or excessive sedimentation have been found.\nSince the Project is a run-of-the-river type not needing extensive civil\nworks or a dam, and the associated transmission system involves only the\nconstruction of pole-mounted 22 kV lines routed along the existing roads,\nthe Project will not have any significant impact on the environment. The\nEnvironmental Plan for the Project submitted by ELCOM has already been\napproved by the Minister of Environment and Conservation.\n\nF.\t\n\nBenefits and Justification\n\nThe proposed Project supports the Government's objective of\n54.\ndisplacing high-cost imported diesel-based power generation with low-cost,\nindigenous, and renewable hydropower and to improve the supply reliability\nin the Project area. The Project is designed as the least-cost power\ngeneration option for meeting the existing and future power demand in\nPopondetta and the adjacent load centers. The Project will directly\nbenefit about 17,000 people in Popondetta and nearby load centers and\nindirectly benefit about 80,000 people in the Oro Province by stimulating\neconomic growth and providing the necessary infrastructure. The economic\n(1) cost savings due to the\nbenefits from the Project comprise: \t\n\n\f15\n\ndisplacement of existing diesel based power generation; (ii) revenue from\nthe sale of electricity to additional consumers; and (iii) consumer's\nsurplus in respect of (ii). The EIRR for the Project is estimated at 13.8\nper cent, and the FIRR at about 12.7 per cent, which are considered\nsatisfactory given the nature of the Project.\n\nF.\t\n\nPolicy Issues and Related Matters\n\n55. In view of the continuing dialogue between the Bank, the\nGovernment and ELCOM on sector-related issues along with the\nimplementation of the previous Bank-financed loans and technical\nassistance projects, there are no major policy issues regarding the\nproposed Project. The Bank has impressed on ELCOM the need to reach as\nsoon as possible the covenanted self-financing ratio of 30 per cent, which\nhad been stipulated under the Ramu Grid Reinforcement Project (Loan No.\n805-PNG) and is expected to be slightly lower in 1988 and 1989 due to the\nhigher than anticipated level of expenditure on the Yonki Dam Hydropower\nProject (see para. 28).\n\nG.\t\n\nProject Risks\n\n56.\t\nNo major technical or economic risks are foreseen regarding the\nProject's physical components, all of which involve proven and\nconventional technologies of relatively simple design. Although the\nProject site lies close to the Owen Stanley fault and is therefore located\nin a zone classified as being between medium and low risk, the Project\ncomponents have been designed for medium risk conditions so as to maximize\nthe ductility of the structures, minimize the damage and keep the Project\noperational in the event of any major seismic disturbance. The adopted\ntechnology is a proven one and poses no significant technical risk. There\nis still a risk of possible delays in Project implementation due to delays\nin land acquisition. However, although the land acquisition process is\npresently anticipated to be completed by August 1989 (see para. 49), it\nhas been stipulated that no contracts will be awarded until the process\nis completed, thereby minimizing any impact such delay might have on the\neconomic and financial viability of the Project. Since major additions\nto the load are envisaged through the conversion of diesel-based captive\npower generation to supply from ELCOM once the Project is completed, and\nexpanding economic activities in the Project area are expected in the\nmedium-term, any economic risks of energy sales remaining below the\npresent forecast are also minimal.\n\nIV. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY\n\n57.\t\n\nDrafts of the following documents are circulated herewith:\n\n(i) Loan Agreement (Ordinary Operations) between the Independent\n\nState of Papua New Guinea and the Bank; and\n\n(ii) Project Agreement between the Bank and the Papua New Guinea\n\nElectricity Commission (ELCOM).\n\n\f16\n\n58. The provision of the Bank's Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations\ndated 1 July 1986 are incorporated in the draft Loan Agreement, subject\nto the modifications set forth in Section 1.01 thereof.\n\n59. The Independent State of Papua New Guinea is empowered under its\nconstitution and laws to borrow from the Bank. ELCOM is authorized to\nenter into and to implement its obligations under the proposed Project\nAgreement.\n\n60.\t\nArticles of Agreement of the Bank.\n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the\n\nV.
