The loan will meet FEH\u2019s \nfunding  requirements  for  longer-term  funding,  support  health  care  finance  to  underserved \nsegments,  improve  readiness  for  managing  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  outbreaks,  and \nsupport gender-based violence (GBV) victims. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  health  sector  overview.  Rapid economic  development  since  the  1980s  has  been \naccompanied  by  a  significant  rise  in  health  care  expenditures  in  the  PRC.  However,  such \nexpenditures continue to lag global averages, and the health sector still faces significant resource \nconstraints. The PRC\u2019s health care expenditure per capita was $688 in 2018 (calculated based \non  purchasing  power  parity) 1 ,  well  below  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment  average  of  $3,994. 2  Since  2000,  the  PRC  has  made  significant  progress  in \ndeveloping its national medical insurance system. By the end of 2019, basic medical insurance \nhad more than 1.35 billion recipients nationwide, representing a coverage rate of more than 95%.3 \nWith the Rural Cooperative Medical System covering more than 95% of the rural population and \nreimbursing about 80% of medical expenditures, improvement of local county hospitals becomes \nthe key to improving rural health care standards. As of December 2019, there were about 16,175 \ncounty-level  hospitals,  36,000  town  and  township  health  centers,  and  616,000  village  clinics \nnationwide.  However,  further  investment  in  health  care  infrastructure  is  required,  especially  in \nrural regions. There are still wide urban\u2013rural disparities in access to health care and quality of \nhealth care services. In 2016, the annual health care expenditure per capita was CNY4,472 in \nurban areas compared with CNY1,846 in rural areas.4 As of 2018, the number of beds in medical \nand health institutions for every 10,000 people in urban areas was 87, while in rural areas it was \n46.  As  of  2018,  there  were  109  health  care  professionals  and  51  registered  nurses  for  every \n10,000 people in urban areas, while in rural areas there were 46 health care professionals and \n18 registered nurses for every 10,000 people.5 \n \n4. \nFinancial Leasing industry. Hospitals often have difficulties accessing bank finance, as \nbanks  typically  do  not  accept  medical  equipment  and  land  (which  is  typically  owned  by  the \ngovernment) as collateral. Leasing provides a good solution, whereby hospitals can directly lease \n\nHealthcare 2019. Beijing. \n\n \n\n1  Government of the PRC, National Health Commission of the PRC. 2020.

The PRC\u2019s leasing industry has been growing rapidly since 2008, targeting \nthis  financing  gap  that  traditional  bank  financing  does  not  address.  Despite  rapid  growth,  the \nPRC\u2019s financial leasing industry still needs further development. The lease penetration rate in the \nPRC was 1.90% in 2018, ranking 19th out of the top 50 global leasing markets.6 \n \n5. \nImpact of COVID-19 pandemic on the health sector. The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan \nstretched the local health care system to the breaking point, with many hospitals overwhelmed by \npatients. The entire country was subsequently put under lockdown in varying degrees. COVID-19 \nalso had enormous indirect impacts on the health care system by reducing its ability to provide \neffective medical services to other patients, some with life-threatening diseases such as cancer, \nbecause of reduced capacity or suspension of treatment for non-COVID-19 patients in many large \nhospitals, and because of the general lockdown. While 4,746 people have died from COVID-19 \nin the PRC as of 1 October 2020, probably more lives were lost because of the delay in receiving \nmedical care for other conditions. To contain the outbreak, the government has identified a list of \nhospitals as \u201cfever clinics\u201d that receive patients with such symptoms and has designated a small \nnumber  of  hospitals  per  city  as  COVID-19  treatment  hospitals.  These  COVID-19  treatment \nhospitals are mainly in urban areas, and not all rural counties have hospitals included on the list. \nAfter the major COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, the PRC has experienced several local outbreaks \nin Beijing, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Xinjiang provinces, which were successfully brought under \ncontrol by strict targeted lockdowns, extensive testing, and effective contact tracing. However, the \nrisk of further outbreaks persists. Therefore, it is important to continue to enhance the capacity of \ndesignated COVID-19 treatment hospitals, as well as those providing critical medical services to \nnon-COVID-19 patients during the pandemic and particularly in underserved rural areas. \n \n6. \nGender  impacts.  While  the  PRC\u2019s  growth  and  development  have  led  to  notable \nsocioeconomic  progress,  gender  inequality  remains,  including  in  the  area  of  GBV.7 In  2010, \n24.7% of women aged 24\u201360 reported experiencing domestic violence in the 12 months prior.8  \nThe first law in the PRC to specifically target domestic violence was passed in 2015 and, despite \nconsiderable progress, there are still challenges to its effective implementation, such as a lack of \nawareness  and  capacity  among  frontline  anti-domestic  violence  service  providers,  including \nhealth care providers.9 As a result of COVID-19 lockdowns, many women are confined with their \nabusers,  with  limited  options  for  seeking  help  in  confidence,10 leading  to  an  increase  of  GBV \nincidents. \n \n7. \nRationale.  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  projects  in  the  PRC\u2019s  finance  sector  have \nactively supported leasing, targeting diverse subsectors focusing on underdeveloped segments, \nincluding health care.11 The $75 million ADB loan disbursed to State Grid International Leasing \n\n \n\n6  White  Clarke  Group.  2020.

In  December  2019,  ADB  fully \ndisbursed $150 million to FEH for health care finance in underdeveloped regions.12 The COVID-\n19  outbreaks  have  also  exposed  significant  challenges  in  pandemic  control  that  call  for  a \ncorrespondingly  large  increase  in  health  care  infrastructure  investments,  particularly  for  public \nhospitals  in  rural  county  areas.  ADB  considers  FEH,  with  more  than  20  years  of  health  care \nleasing experience and an existing relationship with ADB, a good financial intermediary partner. \nCONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED.  The  project  will  help  expand  FEH\u2019s  financing \ncapacity to public hospitals in rural counties, which aims to reduce the urban\u2013rural disparity in \nhealth care standards, widen access to quality health care for the rural population, and improve \nreadiness for managing COVID-19 outbreaks in rural areas.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nFEH started operations in 1991 and was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2011. \nFEH is rated BBB\u2013 by Standard & Poor\u2019s.13  It is the third-largest financial leasing company (FLC) \nin the PRC by assets with total assets of CNY289.3 billion as of June 2020. Financial leasing, \nconducted through IFEL, is the core activity of FEH\u2019s businesses.14 With operations covering 30 \nprovinces, financial leasing comprised 91% of FEH\u2019s total interest-earning assets as of the end \nof June 2020, reaching CNY203 billion. FEH operates in health care, urban public utilities, culture \nand tourism (including education), engineering construction, machinery, chemicals and medicine, \nelectronic  information,  livelihood  consumption,  and  transport  and  logistics.  FEH  traditionally \nfocuses  on  mid-tier  clients  with  stable  cash  flows  and  good  growth  potential,  offering  them \nspecialized  and  integrated  services.  In  addition  to  financial  leasing,  FEH  also  has  industrial \noperations, including (i) full-service operating leases where leased equipment is operated by FEH \nstaff, which ensures efficient operation and maintenance; and (ii) investment and management of \nhospitals  and  schools.  FEH  has  the  largest  equipment  operating  lease  asset  portfolio  among \nFLCs in the PRC, and it has gradually scaled up investments in and management of hospitals \nand schools since 2014. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n9. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nOwnership. FEH is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. As  of 30 June 2020, its \nlargest shareholder was Sinochem Group, with a 23.20% ownership stake. Sinochem Group is a \n100%  state-owned  enterprise  with  operations  in  oil,  chemicals,  and  agriculture.  The  second \nlargest shareholder, with a 10.44% ownership stake, is DCP, Limited, a private equity fund.15 The \noperating subsidiary, IFEL, is wholly owned by FEH.

ADB\u2019s review of FEH \ndoes  not  give  ADB  cause  to  believe  that  it  is  being  used  for  money  laundering  or  terrorism \nfinancing. ADB has revalidated the findings of enhanced tax integrity due diligence conducted for \nthe previous loan in 2018,17 and ADB has obtained reasonable assurance that the transaction is \nnot being used for the purpose of tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud, and that the tax integrity \nrisks are low and acceptable to ADB. \n \n11.  Management.    FEH  is  led  by  an  experienced  management  team  (which  is  the  same \nmanagement team for IFEL), comprising a chief executive officer, a chief financial officer, a senior \nvice-president,  four  vice-presidents,  and  two  assistant  vice-presidents.  The  chief  executive \nofficer, Kong Fanxing, also serves as vice chair of the board and is an executive director. Kong \nFanxing  has  more  than  20  years  of  experience  in  the  international  trade  and  financial  leasing \nindustries. He joined IFEL in 2001 and has remained the general manager since then.18 \n \nGovernance  structure.  FEH  has  a  well-defined  corporate  governance  structure.  The \n12. \nboard sets the overall strategy and is supported by three board committees: the audit and risk \nmanagement committee, remuneration and nomination committee, and strategy and investment \ncommittee. The board of directors consists of 11 members, consisting of 2 executive directors, 5 \nnonexecutive  directors,  and  4  independent  nonexecutive  directors.  All  board  members  have \nextensive experience in finance and management. The chair, Ning Gaoning, also serves as the \nboard  chair  of  Sinochem  Group.  Prior  to  this,  Ning  Gaoning  was  the  board  chair  of  COFCO \nCorporation and has held several senior positions in banking, real estate, and agribusiness. \n \nD. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nADB  will  provide  a  senior  unsecured  loan  to  FEH  of  up  to  $75  million  (or  its  yuan \n\n \nA. \n \n13. \nequivalent) with a tenor of up to 5 years.  \n \nB. \n \nUse of proceeds.

CT scanners and X-ray machines are used to diagnose COVID-\n19 infections as well as other conditions. Given the wide range of medical equipment that can be used for COVID-\n19 and non-COVID-19 purposes, the project will support the financing of medical equipment leased by hospitals, \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nEvaluation. ADB will prepare monitoring reports regularly and at least annually. The first \n\nlease or sale and leaseback transactions.20, The equipment financed by the loans will be used \nexclusively for county-level public hospitals, 21 which primarily serve the population in surrounding \nrural areas. At least 60% of the proceeds will be deployed to finance leases to designated COVID-\n19 treatment hospitals in rural counties. Based on the use of proceeds requirement, the proposed \nloan is classified as a direct COVID-19 response project with 60% of the loan amount considered \nas ADB\u2019s COVID-19 response finance.  \n \n15. \nReporting  arrangements.  FEH  will  provide  ADB  with  financial  and  other  reports  at \npredetermined regular  intervals  and as  requested,  including  (i)  semiannual  unaudited  financial \nstatements; (ii) annual audited financial statements; (iii) semiannual compliance certificates for \nfinancial covenants; (iv) periodic reports on the underlying leases financed by IFEL through the \nloan; and (v) annual reports on selected development indicators and the safeguards and social \ndimensions policy agreed between ADB and FEH. \n \n16. \nreport will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nProvide long-term stable finance. The majority of FEH\u2019s bank borrowings are shorter \nterm  (para.  15).  For  long-term  finance,  the  company  issues  bonds,  which  are  capped  by  the \nannual  foreign  bond  issuance  quota  granted  by  the  government,  and  registration  with  the \ngovernment is required for each issuance. The pandemic further reduced the availability of long-\nterm finance from commercial sources. Compared to the first half of 2019, in the first half of 2020 \nthe total amount of bond issuances in the PRC with tenors of 3\u20135 years dropped by 27.45%, while \nbond issuances with tenors of up to 3 years increased by 30.68%.22 Long-term funding from ADB \nwill help support the company\u2019s longer-tenor lease products for health care (the majority of health \ncare lease finance provided by IFEL has a tenor of 5 years), and increase the company\u2019s capacity \nto expand its rural health care leasing operations. \n \n18. \nStrengthen rural health care and pandemic resilience through leasing. Leasing is an \neffective modality for equipment finance, particularly for borrowers that lack eligible collateral. As \nnoted, however, the leasing sector in the PRC remains underdeveloped. By supporting medical \nequipment leasing during the pandemic, ADB helps promote leasing as an effective financing tool \nthat will enable rural public hospitals to fill their funding gap, enhance their medical capacity and \nimprove readiness for managing COVID-19 outbreaks. \n \n19. \nSupport effective gender mainstreaming. The lack of awareness and capacity among \nfrontline health care providers hampers effective implementation of the PRC\u2019s domestic violence \n\n \n\nwhich  will  assist  the  hospitals\u2019  medical  services  for  COVID-19  and  help  improve  the  overall  provision  of  health \nservices. \n\n20  Under  a  sale  and  leaseback  transaction,  the  hospital  sells  the  medical  equipment  already  procured  to  IFEL  and \nobtains financing in the form of sale proceeds. At the same time, it signs a financial lease contract with IFEL to lease \nthe equipment back. Financial lease contracts signed within 9 months before the signing date of the ADB loan are \neligible for financing, provided that they meet eligibility criteria and ADB\u2019s safeguards requirement. This provision \nallows IFEL to develop its lease project pipeline while the ADB loan is being processed to expedite disbursement. \n21 Including public hospitals in county-level cities beyond the boundary of any provincial capital city and with large rural \n\npopulations. \n\n22 China Central Depository & Clearing Co., Ltd. Bond statistics. The Issuance Amount of Bonds Per Maturity. Most \ncorporate bonds have tenors of up to 5 years, and it is very rare to see senior corporate bonds with tenors of more \nthan 7 years. Unlike corporates, the PRC government increased the issuance of bonds with tenors of over 7 years.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nlaw. 23  COVID-19  restrictions  are  exacerbating  these  issues  by  both  increasing  incidents  of \ndomestic violence while reducing victim access to support services. With support from ADB, FEH \nhas  developed  a  gender  action  plan  and  has  committed  to  implement  for  the  first  time:  (i) \ndeveloping  processes  to  work  with  law  enforcement  agencies  to  support  GBV  victims; \n(ii) publicizing information in their hospitals to promote public awareness, developing guidelines \nand building capacity for its frontline workers on how to  better support GBV victims; and (iii) a \ncorporate anti-sexual harassment policy. \n \nD. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nImpacts.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  rural  medical  and  health \nservice system improved; (ii) capabilities regarding emergency medical assistance, and disease \nprevention and control strengthened;  and (iii)  financial  leasing  industry  developed.  The  project \nwill  improve  county-level  hospitals\u2019  access  to  finance,  and  thus  enhance  the  rural  health  care \nsystem\u2019s  capacity  and  reduce  the  urban\u2013rural  area  disparity  in  health  care  standards.  By \nproviding longer-tenor finance to a major FLC, ADB will be contributing to the development of the \nPRC\u2019s underdeveloped leasing sector.24 \n \n21. \nOutcome.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  health  care  capacity  in  rural \ncounties  strengthened,  including  improved  readiness  for  managing  COVID-19  outbreaks  and \nsupporting GBV victims. \n \n22. \nOutputs. The project will have three outputs: (i) FEH\u2019s health care leasing operations in \nrural counties expanded. FEH, through IFEL, will disburse $75 million (or its yuan equivalent) of \nlease finance to public hospitals in rural counties, of which at least $45 million will be provided to \nfinance leases to designated COVID-19 treatment hospitals in rural counties. (ii) Support for GBV \nvictims enhanced. FEH will promote public awareness and provide appropriate staff training to \nenhance  support for GBV  victims  in  its  operated  hospitals. (iii)  Gender  equality  of  FEH\u2019s  work \nenvironment enhanced. FEH will introduce an anti-sexual harassment policy and related training \nfor its own staff. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030  operational  priority  5  (promoting  rural  development  and  food  security)  and \noperational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality).25 By financing hospitals in rural \ncounties, the project will help address inequalities in health care access in the PRC. By promoting \nprivate sector finance for public health care investment, ADB will help develop a suitable solution \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nviolence crimes in 2016.  \n\n \n\n23 According to the PRC\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate statistics, only 5,134 offenders were charged with domestic \n\n24 Government  of  the  PRC,  State  Council.  2019.

The project is in \nline with ADB\u2019s operational plan for health, 2015\u20132020, which supports universal health coverage \nand  identifies  investing  in  health  infrastructure  and  financing  health  service  delivery  as  key \npriorities.28 Finance sector development is also a key focus of development assistance for ADB. \nThe  project  builds  on  previous  ADB  support  for  the  PRC\u2019s  leasing  industry  and  health  sector \n(para. 7). By supporting the health sector and businesses negatively affected by the pandemic, \nthe project is aligned with ADB\u2019s strategy for COVID-19 response under private sector operations. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nADB has categorized the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \n(2009).29 \n \nCategory  FI  (treated  as  C).

The  loan\u2019s  potential  environmental  and \nsocial (E&S) impacts, and its risks associated with FEH\u2019s use of proceeds and capacity for E&S \nmanagement,  have  been assessed  based  on  performance in the  implementation  of  the  active \nADB loan to FEH to support financial leasing of medical equipment in underdeveloped regions \n(footnote  12).  The  E&S  measures  and  the  institutional  capacity  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  E&S \nimpacts  are  deemed  adequate.  The  project  will  only  finance  the  lease  or  purchase  of  medical \nequipment through direct lease or sale and leaseback transactions. ADB funds will not be used \nto  finance  any  construction  or  expansion  activities  that  may  lead  to  adverse  environmental, \ninvoluntary resettlement, or indigenous peoples impacts. \n \nFEH has an organizational structure for E&S management involving a top manager with \n27. \na dedicated E&S team. It has developed a corporate management system framework for health, \nenvironment,  and  safety  (HES)  that  operates  under  an  HES  manual  developed  based  on  the \nNational  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  Management  Requirements  GB/T28001-2001  and \nNational Standards of Environmental Management Systems GB/T 24001-2004.

FEH  has  achieved  gender  balance  in  staffing  with \nwomen representing 51% of its 17,903 staff. The company has a policy of performance-based \nremuneration with an explicit clause of nondiscrimination based on gender. The company does \nnot have an anti-sexual harassment policy. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), FEH has committed to incorporate measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s \nempowerment  in  its  business  activities.  Key features  of  the  gender  action plan  are  as follows: \n(i) hospitals  operated  by  FEH  develop  a  process  to  work  with  law  enforcement  agencies  to \nsupport GBV victims; (ii) hospitals operated by FEH promote public awareness on GBV support \nservices for victims, including hotlines; (iii) FEH develops guidelines for hospital staff on how to \nsupport GBV victims; (iv) FEH conducts annual training to frontline staff in hospitals operated by \nFEH on how to identify and support GBV victims; and (v) FEH develops and implements an anti-\nsexual harassment policy and trains staff both at induction and annually.
