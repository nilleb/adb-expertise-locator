THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $75,000,000 (or its yuan equivalent) to Far East Horizon Limited (FEH) for the Far East \nHorizon Health Care Finance in Rural Areas for COVID-19 Response Project in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing longer-tenor financing \nto FEH for lease finance offered through its wholly owned subsidiary, International Far Eastern \nLeasing Co., Limited (IFEL), to rural county public hospitals in the PRC. The loan will meet FEH\u2019s \nfunding  requirements  for  longer-term  funding,  support  health  care  finance  to  underserved \nsegments, improve readiness for managing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks, and \nsupport gender-based violence (GBV) victims. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  The health sector overview. Rapid economic development since the 1980s has been \naccompanied by a significant rise in health care expenditures in the PRC. However, such \nexpenditures continue to lag global averages, and the health sector still faces significant resource \nconstraints. The PRC\u2019s health care expenditure per capita was $688 in 2018 (calculated based \non purchasing power parity)1, well below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment  average  of  $3,994.2 Since  2000,  the  PRC  has  made  significant  progress  in \ndeveloping its national medical insurance system. By the end of 2019, basic medical insurance \nhad more than 1.35 billion recipients nationwide, representing a coverage rate of more than 95%.3 \nWith the Rural Cooperative Medical System covering more than 95% of the rural population and \nreimbursing about 80% of medical expenditures, improvement of local county hospitals becomes \nthe key to improving rural health care standards. As of December 2019, there were about 16,175 \ncounty-level hospitals, 36,000 town and township health centers, and 616,000 village clinics \nnationwide. However, further investment in health care infrastructure is required, especially in \nrural regions. There are still wide urban\u2013rural disparities in access to health care and quality of \nhealth care services. In 2016, the annual health care expenditure per capita was CNY4,472 in \nurban areas compared with CNY1,846 in rural areas.4 As of 2018, the number of beds in medical \nand health institutions for every 10,000 people in urban areas was 87, while in rural areas it was \n46. As of 2018, there were 109 health care professionals and 51 registered nurses for every \n10,000 people in urban areas, while in rural areas there were 46 health care professionals and \n18 registered nurses for every 10,000 people.5 \n \n4.  Financial Leasing industry. Hospitals often have difficulties accessing bank finance, as \nbanks typically do not accept medical equipment and land (which is typically owned by the \ngovernment) as collateral. Leasing provides a good solution, whereby hospitals can directly lease \n \n1  Government of the PRC, National Health Commission of the PRC. 2020.

The PRC\u2019s leasing industry has been growing rapidly since 2008, targeting \nthis financing gap that traditional bank financing does not address. Despite rapid growth, the \nPRC\u2019s financial leasing industry still needs further development. The lease penetration rate in the \nPRC was 1.90% in 2018, ranking 19th out of the top 50 global leasing markets.6 \n \n5.  Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the health sector. The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan \nstretched the local health care system to the breaking point, with many hospitals overwhelmed by \npatients. The entire country was subsequently put under lockdown in varying degrees. COVID-19 \nalso had enormous indirect impacts on the health care system by reducing its ability to provide \neffective medical services to other patients, some with life-threatening diseases such as cancer, \nbecause of reduced capacity or suspension of treatment for non-COVID-19 patients in many large \nhospitals, and because of the general lockdown. While 4,746 people have died from COVID-19 \nin the PRC as of 1 October 2020, probably more lives were lost because of the delay in receiving \nmedical care for other conditions. To contain the outbreak, the government has identified a list of \nhospitals as \u201cfever clinics\u201d that receive patients with such symptoms and has designated a small \nnumber of hospitals per city as COVID-19 treatment hospitals. These COVID-19 treatment \nhospitals are mainly in urban areas, and not all rural counties have hospitals included on the list. \nAfter the major COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, the PRC has experienced several local outbreaks \nin Beijing, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Xinjiang provinces, which were successfully brought under \ncontrol by strict targeted lockdowns, extensive testing, and effective contact tracing. However, the \nrisk of further outbreaks persists. Therefore, it is important to continue to enhance the capacity of \ndesignated COVID-19 treatment hospitals, as well as those providing critical medical services to \nnon-COVID-19 patients during the pandemic and particularly in underserved rural areas. \n \n6.  Gender  impacts.  While  the  PRC\u2019s  growth  and  development  have  led  to  notable \nsocioeconomic progress, gender inequality remains, including in the area of GBV.7 In 2010, \n24.7% of women aged 24\u201360 reported experiencing domestic violence in the 12 months prior.8  \nThe first law in the PRC to specifically target domestic violence was passed in 2015 and, despite \nconsiderable progress, there are still challenges to its effective implementation, such as a lack of \nawareness and capacity among frontline anti-domestic violence service providers, including \nhealth care providers.9 As a result of COVID-19 lockdowns, many women are confined with their \nabusers, with limited options for seeking help in confidence,10 leading to an increase of GBV \nincidents. \n \n7.  Rationale. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations projects in the PRC\u2019s finance sector have \nactively supported leasing, targeting diverse subsectors focusing on underdeveloped segments, \nincluding health care.11 The $75 million ADB loan disbursed to State Grid International Leasing \n \n6  White Clarke Group. 2020.

In December 2019, ADB fully \ndisbursed $150 million to FEH for health care finance in underdeveloped regions.12 The COVID-\n19 outbreaks have also exposed significant challenges in  pandemic control that call for a \ncorrespondingly large increase in health care infrastructure investments, particularly for public \nhospitals in rural county areas. ADB considers FEH, with more than 20 years of health care \nleasing experience and an existing relationship with ADB, a good financial intermediary partner. \nCONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED.  The  project  will  help  expand  FEH\u2019s  financing \ncapacity to public hospitals in rural counties, which aims to reduce the urban\u2013rural disparity in \nhealth care standards, widen access to quality health care for the rural population, and improve \nreadiness for managing COVID-19 outbreaks in rural areas.  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  FEH started operations in 1991 and was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2011. \nFEH is rated BBB\u2013 by Standard & Poor\u2019s.13  It is the third-largest financial leasing company (FLC) \nin the PRC by assets with total assets of CNY289.3 billion as of June 2020. Financial leasing, \nconducted through IFEL, is the core activity of FEH\u2019s businesses.14 With operations covering 30 \nprovinces, financial leasing comprised 91% of FEH\u2019s total interest-earning assets as of the end \nof June 2020, reaching CNY203 billion. FEH operates in health care, urban public utilities, culture \nand tourism (including education), engineering construction, machinery, chemicals and medicine, \nelectronic information, livelihood consumption, and transport and logistics. FEH traditionally \nfocuses on mid-tier clients with stable cash flows and good growth potential, offering them \nspecialized and integrated services. In addition to financial leasing, FEH also has industrial \noperations, including (i) full-service operating leases where leased equipment is operated by FEH \nstaff, which ensures efficient operation and maintenance; and (ii) investment and management of \nhospitals and schools. FEH has the largest equipment operating lease asset portfolio among \nFLCs in the PRC, and it has gradually scaled up investments in and management of hospitals \nand schools since 2014.

As of 30 June 2020, its \nlargest shareholder was Sinochem Group, with a 23.20% ownership stake. Sinochem Group is a \n100% state-owned enterprise with operations in oil, chemicals, and agriculture. The second \nlargest shareholder, with a 10.44% ownership stake, is DCP, Limited, a private equity fund.15 The \noperating subsidiary, IFEL, is wholly owned by FEH.

ADB\u2019s review of FEH \ndoes not give ADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering or terrorism \nfinancing. ADB has revalidated the findings of enhanced tax integrity due diligence conducted for \nthe previous loan in 2018,17 and ADB has obtained reasonable assurance that the transaction is \nnot being used for the purpose of tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud, and that the tax integrity \nrisks are low and acceptable to ADB. \n \n11.  Management.  FEH is led by an experienced management team (which is the same \nmanagement team for IFEL), comprising a chief executive officer, a chief financial officer, a senior \nvice-president,  four  vice-presidents,  and  two  assistant  vice-presidents.  The  chief  executive \nofficer, Kong Fanxing, also serves as vice chair of the board and is an executive director. Kong \nFanxing has more than 20 years of experience in the international trade and financial leasing \nindustries. He joined IFEL in 2001 and has remained the general manager since then.18 \n \n12.  Governance structure. FEH has a well-defined corporate governance structure. The \nboard sets the overall strategy and is supported by three board committees: the audit and risk \nmanagement committee, remuneration and nomination committee, and strategy and investment \ncommittee. The board of directors consists of 11 members, consisting of 2 executive directors, 5 \nnonexecutive directors, and 4 independent nonexecutive directors. All board members have \nextensive experience in finance and management. The chair, Ning Gaoning, also serves as the \nboard chair of Sinochem Group. Prior to this, Ning Gaoning was the board chair of COFCO \nCorporation and has held several senior positions in banking, real estate, and agribusiness. \n \nD.

CT scanners and X-ray machines are used to diagnose COVID-\n19 infections as well as other conditions. Given the wide range of medical equipment that can be used for COVID-\n19 and non-COVID-19 purposes, the project will support the financing of medical equipment leased by hospitals, \n \n ", "5 \nlease or sale and leaseback transactions.20, The equipment financed by the loans will be used \nexclusively for county-level public hospitals, 21 which primarily serve the population in surrounding \nrural areas. At least 60% of the proceeds will be deployed to finance leases to designated COVID-\n19 treatment hospitals in rural counties. Based on the use of proceeds requirement, the proposed \nloan is classified as a direct COVID-19 response project with 60% of the loan amount considered \nas ADB\u2019s COVID-19 response finance.  \n \n15.  Reporting arrangements. FEH will provide ADB with financial and other reports at \npredetermined regular intervals and as requested, including (i) semiannual unaudited financial \nstatements; (ii) annual audited financial statements; (iii) semiannual compliance certificates for \nfinancial covenants; (iv) periodic reports on the underlying leases financed by IFEL through the \nloan; and (v) annual reports on selected development indicators and the safeguards and social \ndimensions policy agreed between ADB and FEH. \n \n16.  Evaluation. ADB will prepare monitoring reports regularly and at least annually. The first \nreport will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n17.  Provide long-term stable finance. The majority of FEH\u2019s bank borrowings are shorter \nterm (para. 15). For long-term finance, the company issues bonds, which are capped by the \nannual  foreign  bond  issuance  quota  granted by  the  government,  and  registration  with  the \ngovernment is required for each issuance. The pandemic further reduced the availability of long-\nterm finance from commercial sources. Compared to the first half of 2019, in the first half of 2020 \nthe total amount of bond issuances in the PRC with tenors of 3\u20135 years dropped by 27.45%, while \nbond issuances with tenors of up to 3 years increased by 30.68%.22 Long-term funding from ADB \nwill help support the company\u2019s longer-tenor lease products for health care (the majority of health \ncare lease finance provided by IFEL has a tenor of 5 years), and increase the company\u2019s capacity \nto expand its rural health care leasing operations. \n \n18.  Strengthen rural health care and pandemic resilience through leasing. Leasing is an \neffective modality for equipment finance, particularly for borrowers that lack eligible collateral. As \nnoted, however, the leasing sector in the PRC remains underdeveloped. By supporting medical \nequipment leasing during the pandemic, ADB helps promote leasing as an effective financing tool \nthat will enable rural public hospitals to fill their funding gap, enhance their medical capacity and \nimprove readiness for managing COVID-19 outbreaks. \n \n19.  Support effective gender mainstreaming. The lack of awareness and capacity among \nfrontline health care providers hampers effective implementation of the PRC\u2019s domestic violence \n \nwhich will assist the hospitals\u2019 medical services for COVID-19 and help improve the overall provision of health \nservices. \n20 Under a sale and leaseback transaction, the hospital sells the medical equipment already procured to IFEL and \nobtains financing in the form of sale proceeds. At the same time, it signs a financial lease contract with IFEL to lease \nthe equipment back. Financial lease contracts signed within 9 months before the signing date of the ADB loan are \neligible for financing, provided that they meet eligibility criteria and ADB\u2019s safeguards requirement. This provision \nallows IFEL to develop its lease project pipeline while the ADB loan is being processed to expedite disbursement. \n21 Including public hospitals in county-level cities beyond the boundary of any provincial capital city and with large rural \npopulations. \n22 China Central Depository & Clearing Co., Ltd. Bond statistics. The Issuance Amount of Bonds Per Maturity. Most \ncorporate bonds have tenors of up to 5 years, and it is very rare to see senior corporate bonds with tenors of more \nthan 7 years. Unlike corporates, the PRC government increased the issuance of bonds with tenors of over 7 years.  \n ", "6 \nlaw.23 COVID-19 restrictions are exacerbating these issues by both increasing incidents of \ndomestic violence while reducing victim access to support services. With support from ADB, FEH \nhas developed a gender action plan and has committed to implement for the first time: (i) \ndeveloping  processes  to  work  with  law  enforcement  agencies  to  support  GBV  victims; \n(ii) publicizing information in their hospitals to promote public awareness, developing guidelines \nand building capacity for its frontline workers on how to better support GBV victims; and (iii) a \ncorporate anti-sexual harassment policy. \n \nD.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n20.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) rural medical and health \nservice system improved; (ii) capabilities regarding emergency medical assistance, and disease \nprevention and control strengthened; and (iii) financial leasing industry developed. The project \nwill improve county-level hospitals\u2019 access to finance, and thus enhance the rural health care \nsystem\u2019s  capacity  and  reduce  the  urban\u2013rural  area  disparity  in  health  care  standards.  By \nproviding longer-tenor finance to a major FLC, ADB will be contributing to the development of the \nPRC\u2019s underdeveloped leasing sector.24 \n \n21.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: health care capacity in rural \ncounties strengthened, including improved readiness for managing COVID-19 outbreaks and \nsupporting GBV victims. \n \n22.  Outputs. The project will have three outputs: (i) FEH\u2019s health care leasing operations in \nrural counties expanded. FEH, through IFEL, will disburse $75 million (or its yuan equivalent) of \nlease finance to public hospitals in rural counties, of which at least $45 million will be provided to \nfinance leases to designated COVID-19 treatment hospitals in rural counties. (ii) Support for GBV \nvictims enhanced. FEH will promote public awareness and provide appropriate staff training to \nenhance support for GBV victims in its operated hospitals. (iii) Gender equality of FEH\u2019s work \nenvironment enhanced. FEH will introduce an anti-sexual harassment policy and related training \nfor its own staff. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n23.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project supports ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030  operational  priority  5  (promoting  rural  development  and  food  security)  and \noperational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality).25 By financing hospitals in rural \ncounties, the project will help address inequalities in health care access in the PRC. By promoting \nprivate sector finance for public health care investment, ADB will help develop a suitable solution \n \n23 According to the PRC\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate statistics, only 5,134 offenders were charged with domestic \nviolence crimes in 2016.  \n24 Government of the PRC, State Council. 2019.

The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, which emphasizes inclusive and \nsustainable growth and targeted interventions in the finance sector.26 The project also aligns with \nADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u20132020.27 \n \n24.  Consistency with the sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is in \nline with ADB\u2019s operational plan for health, 2015\u20132020, which supports universal health coverage \nand identifies investing in health infrastructure and financing health service delivery as key \npriorities.28 Finance sector development is also a key focus of development assistance for ADB. \nThe project builds on previous ADB support for the PRC\u2019s leasing industry and health sector \n(para. 7). By supporting the health sector and businesses negatively affected by the pandemic, \nthe project is aligned with ADB\u2019s strategy for COVID-19 response under private sector operations. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n25.  ADB has categorized the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).29 \n \n26.  Category FI (treated as C). FEH\u2019s business activities using ADB\u2019s proceeds will have \nminimal or no adverse environmental or climate change impacts and are unlikely to entail impacts \non involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The loan\u2019s potential environmental and \nsocial (E&S) impacts, and its risks associated with FEH\u2019s use of proceeds and capacity for E&S \nmanagement, have been assessed based on performance in the implementation of the active \nADB loan to FEH to support financial leasing of medical equipment in underdeveloped regions \n(footnote 12). The E&S measures and the institutional capacity to manage the project\u2019s E&S \nimpacts are deemed adequate. The project will only finance the lease or purchase of medical \nequipment through direct lease or sale and leaseback transactions. ADB funds will not be used \nto finance any construction or expansion activities that may lead to adverse environmental, \ninvoluntary resettlement, or indigenous peoples impacts. \n \n27.  FEH has an organizational structure for E&S management involving a top manager with \na dedicated E&S team. It has developed a corporate management system framework for health, \nenvironment, and safety (HES) that operates under an HES manual developed based on the \nNational Occupational Health and Safety Management Requirements GB/T28001-2001 and \nNational Standards of Environmental Management Systems GB/T 24001-2004. The HES manual \nspecifies procedures, requirements, and responsibilities covering leadership, risk assessment \nand control, legal compliance, organizational structure and responsibilities, resource distribution, \ncapacity building, document control, operational control, contractor and supplier management, \nemergency preparedness, noncompliance and remediation, incident management, internal audit, \nand management review. Regular monitoring is carried out by asset managers who often have \nrelevant  industry  compliance  experience  and  are  aware  of  HES  issues.

Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), FEH has committed to incorporate measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: \n(i) hospitals operated by FEH develop a process to work with law enforcement agencies to \nsupport GBV victims; (ii) hospitals operated by FEH promote public awareness on GBV support \nservices for victims, including hotlines; (iii) FEH develops guidelines for hospital staff on how to \nsupport GBV victims; (iv) FEH conducts annual training to frontline staff in hospitals operated by \nFEH on how to identify and support GBV victims; and (v) FEH develops and implements an anti-\nsexual harassment policy and trains staff both at induction and annually.
