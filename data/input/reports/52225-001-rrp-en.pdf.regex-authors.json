THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Promoting Economic Diversification Program, and (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based  grant  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Promoting  Economic \nDiversification Program.  \n \n2.  The proposed program aims to support the government\u2019s efforts to diversify the Kyrgyz \neconomy gradually away from gold extraction and remittance-led consumption. The program will \naccomplish this by building on longstanding support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ngovernment-led reforms that aim to achieve broad-based economic growth through improving \ntrade  and  investment  competitiveness,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs) \ndevelopment,  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  development  and  industry-linked  skills \ndevelopment.1 The programmatic approach, with two subprograms in 2019 and 2021, recognizes \nthat reforms of this nature are complex and require sustained political support over election cycles \nand leadership changes, as well as a medium-term view to reform that allows institutional capacity \nto develop and implement policies, laws, and regulations in a stepwise, chronological manner. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints  \n3.  Development  context.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  a  landlocked  lower  middle-income \neconomy in Central Asia with a population of more than 6.3 million and estimated gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) per capita of $1,255 (at the lower end of countries in the region).2 Although \neconomic growth averaged 4.3% during 2000\u20132018, slightly above the regional average, it has \nbeen  volatile\u2014reflecting  the  effect  of  exogenous  shocks,  domestic  events,  and  heavy \ndependence on gold production and exports (about 6%\u201310% of GDP each year) and private \nconsumption based on remittance inflows (about 30% of GDP).3 The structure of the economy \nhas changed since the mid-1990s, with significant impacts on labor market dynamics, especially \nformal and informal employment, and job creation. Agriculture\u2019s share of GDP, for example, more \nthan halved from 2000 to 2016, falling from 36.6% to 14.4%, with excess labor either migrating to \nlow-skilled jobs abroad, especially to the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan, or moving to \ninformal jobs in the main urban centers of Bishkek and Osh. On the other hand, the services share \nhas doubled over the same period, rising from 32.1% to 57.3%, driven mainly by large remittance \nflows into construction, real estate, and trade.4 The unemployment rate has been relatively high, \nabout 7%\u20138% in recent years, though the extent of underemployment has improved somewhat. \nCurrently, about half of employees are in services, 29% are in agriculture, and about 21% are in \nindustry and construction. In 2018, women constituted 30.0% of managers of small firms and \n41.0% of managers of medium-sized firms, 34.9% of individual entrepreneurs were women, and \n19.2% of agricultural enterprises were headed by women.

In addition, most of the population lives just above the poverty line although poverty \nlevels have declined significantly.5 The government aims to increase the economy\u2019s growth \npotential. Its national development agenda, including the National Development Strategy of the \nKyrgyz  Republic  for  2018\u20132040  (NDS  2040),  has  focused  on  decreasing  the  country\u2019s \ndependence on migration-led remittances and gold extraction.6 The government recognizes that \nthis is an ambitious medium- to long-term reform agenda and has requested ADB\u2019s analytical, \ntechnical, and financial support.  \n \n4.  Macroeconomic performance. Economic growth slowed in 2018 in tandem with smaller \ngains in mining and manufacturing. According to the 2019 Asian Development Outlook, growth is \nprojected to recover in 2019 and continue accelerating in 2020 on recovery in gold production \nand continued growth in the region (footnote 3). The March 2019 Article IV consultations of the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  concluded  that  the  country\u2019s  macroeconomic  and  fiscal \nsituation was stable, but emphasized the importance of improving the business climate and rule \nof law to put the economy on a higher and more inclusive growth path. The IMF recommended \ncementing macroeconomic stability and building buffers by ensuring the fiscal deficit does not \nexceed 2.5% of GDP in the medium term.7 In line with this recommendation, the government\u2019s \nfiscal deficit target is 1.7% of GDP for 2019 and 1.4% of GDP for 2020.8 \n \n5.  Core development problems. The government and development partners recognize that \neconomic diversification will be a gradual process and that, in the short term, the country\u2019s \ndevelopment will continue to rely on gold extraction and remittances. Under the NDS 2040, a new \ninclusive, broad-based, and sustainable development model is being implemented to help the \ntransition to a dynamic, globally oriented, market economy. Under this model, the agriculture and \nmanufacturing sectors will be reenergized to avoid the heavy reliance on remittance-driven \nservices. The government will prioritize improving the business climate and overcoming corruption. \nReforms  addressed  through  the  Promoting  Economic  Diversification  Program  will  help  the \ngovernment achieve (i) increased foreign trade and improved movement of labor, capital, and \nservices to the European Union (EU) and Eurasian Economic Union (EEU); (ii) a competitive \nbusiness  environment  that  supports  SME  development  and  entrepreneurship;  (iii)  a \ncomprehensive approach to developing and implementing bankable PPP projects; and (iv) \nstronger links between the education system and the labor market through demand-driven and \nlearning  outcomes-based  curricula.  The  program  will  help  address  the  following  core, \ninterconnected development constraints. 9 \n  \n6.  Weak trade and foreign direct investment competitiveness. In 2017, foreign trade \ntotaled $6.3 billion, up 12.5% from 2016. However, exports were concentrated on a few products \n(mainly precious metals and mineral commodities and three major markets [Kazakhstan, the \nRussian Federation, and Switzerland]). Several agricultural products have considerable export \n \n5  ADB. Kyrgyz Republic: Improving Growth Potential. Unpublished.  \n6  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2018.

In addition, despite a relatively open foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) regime, the sources of FDI remain concentrated in a few countries (mainly the \nRussian Federation). Policy and institutional reforms are needed to (i) improve the policy, legal, \nand  regulatory  environment  for  trade  and  business,  including  access  to  trade  and  market \nintelligence; (ii) strengthen the capacity of local laboratories; (iii) streamline and simplify the export \nprocess; and (iv) strengthen the capacity of SMEs to comply with international market access \nrequirements.11 Laws are in line with standards but are not being applied consistently, which is \ndeterring foreign investors.12 13  \n \n7.  Limited small and medium-sized enterprise development. In 2017, SMEs employed \nonly 2% of the economically active population and their share of GDP was 11% (compared with \n50% and 60% for large firms). The SME share of gross value added in GDP shows that, in 2016, \nlarge firms and individual entrepreneurs contributed more value addition to GDP than SMEs.14 \nThis low level of productivity undermines the capacity of SMEs to be regionally competitive and \nto integrate successfully into regional and global value chains.15 Access to EU and EEU markets \nwill require higher and more consistent volumes and compliance with quality standards, which \ncould transform the sector, accelerate the shift to the formal economy, and increase value addition. \nContributing factors the program will help address include (i) overlapping laws and regulations \nand fragmented institutions, (ii) the high cost of credit, (iii) lack of long-term financial products and \ninstruments,  (iv)  lack  of  incentives  for  SMEs  to  formalize  and  adhere  to  labor  laws,  (v) \noverregulation in some sectors, and (vi) high taxes on wages. 16  \n \n8.  Lack of infrastructure and public\u2013private partnership investments. The quality of \ninfrastructure in the Kyrgyz Republic is among the lowest in the world. The Kyrgyz Republic ranks \n107 out of 140 countries with regard to overall infrastructure quality.17 Since its first PPP law in \n2012, it has continued to expand and define its policy through bylaws and regulations, including \na 2016 amendment.18 The country has made significant progress. In 2018, The Economist \nIntelligence Unit Infrascope assessment report ranked the Kyrgyz Republic 9th out of 19 Asian \ncountries and 1st in Central Asia,19 but noted slow implementation of PPP projects.20 The main \nfactors include (i) lack of interest of the partners in initiating projects, (ii) limited PPP sensitization \nand awareness, (iii) slow expansion of the PPP pipeline, (iv) ineffective gateway reviews, (v) \nlimited access to nonrecourse finance, and (vi) limited attention to the gender and social impact \n \n10 D.

The labor market of the \nKyrgyz Republic is characterized by skilled workers and technicians from the Soviet era who are \napproaching retirement. The current technical and vocational education and training (TVET) \nsystem is not able to meet the labor force replacement rate, which is up to five times higher than \nthe number of skilled workers entering the workforce.22 The government recognizes that workers \nwho are unprepared for the changing skills requirements are less likely to find employment and \nmore likely to be in volatile, low wage jobs. In the absence of a national qualifications system and \nnational qualifications framework, unstructured TVET system variations have developed. The \nquality and relevance of vocational education thus requires attention. Innovative TVET finance \nreforms are needed to accompany increased enrollment and graduation, such as the introduction \nof per capita financing (PCF) and incentive funds to improve administration and operations.23 \nVocational education enrollment has a gender imbalance, with 57% female and 43% male \nstudents,24 but gender stereotypes affect the choice of subject. For example, women and girls \ncontinue to choose traditionally female-dominated fields: education (87%), humanities and social \nsciences (75%), and services (67%). Specific measures, such as revising qualification standards \nto eliminate gender stereotypes and discrimination in competencies, qualifications, and curricula, \nare needed to create an enabling environment for the enrollment of girls in nontraditional fields of \neducation.25 \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s past engagement in the sector. ADB has been helping the government with \ncritical structural reforms to help diversify the economy since 2007 (Figure). Despite many \nchallenges, including macroeconomic shocks and two major political crises that have absorbed \nadministrative effort and slowed reform implementation, ADB-supported reforms have resulted in \nsignificant improvements in policies and institutions. These include (i) reduced tax compliance \ncosts  for  businesses  through  risk-based  inspections  and  electronic  tax  declarations, \n(ii) automated pre-customs clearance processes through the single window for foreign trade, \n(iii) improved access to finance by reducing credit risks and making new products available, \n(iv) increased SME access to finance through establishing and capitalizing a guarantee fund that \ncovers part of a loan\u2019s default risk and motivates lenders to extend credit to groups that would not \nhave access to finance under normal circumstances, (v) a strengthened institutional framework \nfor market-driven skills development, and (vi) an improved enabling environment for PPPs.26  \nBiennial country performance assessments have shown improvements in the quality of policies \nand institutions as a result of ADB policy-based lending programs. The Kyrgyz Republic performs \nwell above the average for ADB\u2019s Group A developing member countries for structural policies \n \n21 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management\u2014Public\u2013Private Partnership Development (accessible \nfrom the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB.

TVET in the Kyrgyz Republic comprises of two levels: primary vocational education (PVE) and \nsecondary vocational education. PVE is provided in lyceums to train (semi-) skilled blue-collar workers in occupations \nwhile secondary vocational education is provided in colleges to prepare specialized technicians.  \n23 PCF is a new form of education finance that is considered international good practice. Funding is based on student \nnumbers rather than the continuation of lump-sum projections (largely based on historic budgeting). \n24 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2018.

Lessons. Key lessons from past interventions and ADB\u2019s experience with policy-based \nlending in Central Asia and other regions have been incorporated into the program design.28 \nThese include the following:  \n(i)  ADB should continue to support investment climate reforms and simultaneously \nexpand the portfolio of private sector investments and PPPs. In particular, the use \nof  long-term  programmatic  assistance  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  is \nrecommended to support the medium-term view to reform.  \n(ii)  ADB  should  develop  guidelines  and  templates  for  preparing  blueprints  for \ninstitutional reforms since these are critical for the successful implementation of \npolicy-based loans.  \n(iii)  Government and ADB should pursue a small number of critical and realistic policy \nactions to help ensure the reform program can be carried out effectively and that \nimplementing agencies\u2019 technical staff remain fully connected to the process. \nBuilding on lessons learned, subprogram 2 will include a post-partnership engagement framework \nthat would enable a working-level commitment to jointly prepare the next phase of associated, \nand more substantive, reforms to support the programs sustainability beyond 2021.  \n \nB.

It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 and its focus on strengthening governance and institutional capacity through supporting \npublic management reforms and financial sustainability, improving infrastructure and service \ndelivery, and strengthening capacity and standards.30 Subprogram 1 comprises 12 policy actions, \nall of which have been accomplished. All subprogram 2 actions are indicative and subject to \nfurther discussion with Government. \n \n13.  Reform area 1: Trade and investment competitiveness to develop non-mineral \nsector and diversify exports and investments improved. The actions under this reform area \naim to develop the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, and diversify exports and types and \nsources of FDI. Under subprogram 1, the government approved the national Food Security and \nNutrition Program, 2019\u20132023 to improve the country\u2019s nutritional status, ensure consistency of \nfood supply in the domestic market, and guarantee compliance with export market consumer \nquality and consumer protection standards. The Food Security and Nutrition Program envisions \nspecial measures to ensure that (i) women producers have access to finance; (ii) businesses \nwhere women dominate, such as poultry and dairy, are prioritized for support; (iii) women are \ninvolved in the management of pastures; and (iv) special measures on nutrition targeting for girls \nand women of reproductive age, infants, and children are introduced. The government approved \nthe Creation and Development of Trade and Logistics Centers for Agricultural Products Program \n2019\u20132023 to reduce storage, distribution, and transport costs for agricultural producers. Ministry \nof Economy implemented the Export Development Program, 2019\u20132023 by (i) designating a \ndedicated body to administer the Registration of Export System for exporting to the EU within the \nframework of the Generalized System of Preferences plus (or GSP+), which provides preferential \nmarket access; (ii) obtaining the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation for the Kyrgyz \nCenter of Accreditation to enhance product standardization and compliance with EU and EEU \nmarket access conditions; (iii) signing an agreement with the Islamic Development Bank on the \npreparation of feasibility study to establish the integrated supply chain park for Halal product \ndevelopment and export; and (iv) the Kyrgyz Center of Accreditation obtaining the status of a full \nmember of the International Forum on Halal Accreditation. To enhance the enabling environment \nfor promoting FDI, the government adopted and implemented an action plan to improve the \ncountry\u2019s ranking in the annual Doing Business survey, a benchmark used by foreign companies \nas a decision-making tool in evaluating and pricing the risks of investing in developing countries.31 \nThe International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, introduced the Fifth \nFreedom of the Air rules and regulations. These will liberalize the aviation sector and help develop \ntourism, trade, and transport logistics industries by allowing more international airlines to operate \nin the Kyrgyz Republic, thus helping to lower business costs for exporters.32 \n \n \n29 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2018.

Subprogram  2  will  build  on  these  improvements  in  the  enabling  and  operational \nenvironment and support the government to implement high-priority follow-on reforms, including \n(i) the approval of the law on organic agricultural production, which will provide the legal basis for \nthe production, certification, and regulation of organic agricultural products; (ii) the establishment \nof at least two trade and logistics centers; (iii) the annual allocation of at least Som250 million for \nthe implementation of projects for financing export-oriented enterprises; and (iv) becoming a party \nto the World Trade Organization\u2019s Agreement on Government Procurement, which will allow firms \nto bid for foreign government tender contracts. \n \n15.  Reform area 2: Small and medium-sized enterprise development to broaden the \neconomic base and promote entrepreneurship improved. The actions under this reform area \naim to broaden the economic base and promote entrepreneurship. Under subprogram 1, the \ngovernment improved SME access to finance and services through (i) Parliamentary approval of \nthe Law on Guarantee Funds 2019 to determine the authorized body for regulating the activities \nof guarantee funds; (ii) the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) approval of a capital \nincrease for the Guarantee Fund by up to 49% (about Som500 million); and (iii) NBKR approval \nof changes to its regulatory requirements to increase access to financing by optimizing collateral \nrequirements for the provision of loans, establishing a credit rating system, and introducing \nelectronic signatures for online lending to improve financial intermediation. MOE approved the \nConcept for Development of Business Service Centers for 2019\u20132022. The centers will serve as \na central contact point for SMEs and provide services including obtaining approvals for permits, \nlicenses and, patents; capacity building and training; legal and marketing services; trade and \nlogistics support; and loans and other financial instruments for SMEs and entrepreneurs. \n \n16.  Subprogram  2  will  build  on  these  improvements  in  the  enabling  and  operational \nenvironment and support the government to implement high-priority follow-on reforms, including \n(i)  developing  an  infrastructure  connection  system\u2014electricity,  water,  and  sewage\u2014with  a \nstandardized and transparent connection schedule and corresponding fees; (ii) implementing a \nsystem  for  issuing  electronic  permits,  licenses,  and  patents;  and  (iii)  NBKR  adopting  new \nregulations on mobile financial services to expand access to alternative forms of payment for \nSMEs. \n  \n17.  Reform  area  3:  Public\u2013private  partnership  to  develop  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure improved. The actions under this reform area aim to develop critical social and \neconomic infrastructure. PPP will allow the government to accelerate infrastructure investment \nand deliver infrastructure services more efficiently. Under subprogram 1, MOE published five \ntenders for consulting services for preparing PPP projects, including feasibility studies and tender \ndocuments, and completed and approved two ongoing feasibility studies. The completion of these \nconsultancy services and feasibility studies will strengthen the pipeline of PPP projects and \nemphasize the need for sound project preparation. The Ministry of Economy (MOE) adopted a \nPPP  manual,  which  includes  model  tender  documents  and  gender-sensitive  operational \nguidelines on the identification, preparation, and implementation of PPP projects. This will provide \noperational  guidance  and  ensure  proper  project  governance,  sound  project  preparation, \ntransparent  procurement  of  projects,  and  efficient  monitoring  of  PPP  arrangements.  The \ngovernment approved the establishment and operationalization of the Center for Public\u2013Private \nPartnership, with budgetary allocation of Som7 million for 2019 to support and accelerate the \ndevelopment of PPP projects. The center is essential for ensuring successful PPPs, as it will \npromote  PPP;  provide  TA  and  quality  control  for  the  identification,  preparation,  and \n ", "8 \nimplementation of PPP projects; and disseminate knowledge on PPP and support the necessary \ncapacity building.33 \n \n18.  Subprogram  2  will  build  on  these  improvements  in  the  enabling  and  operational \nenvironment and support the government to implement high-priority follow-on reforms, including \n(i) budgetary allocation of Som14 million each for 2020 and 2021 for the operations of the Center \nfor PPPs, (ii) the publication of at least 10 tenders for consulting services to prepare PPP projects \nand issuance of the request for qualification for at least three PPP projects, and (iii) the approval \nof  the  PPP  Development  Program,  2021\u20132026  to  continue  the  government\u2019s  approach  to \ndeveloping  PPP  projects  by  focusing  on  institutional  checks  and  balances,  strengthening \ninstitutional capacity, and operationalizing financial instruments. \n \n19.  Reform  area  4:  Industry-linked  skills  development  through  enhanced  internal \nefficiency and qualifications structure improved. The actions under this reform area aim to \npromote economic diversification and productivity by improving the quality and relevance of the \ncurrent and future workforce. Under subprogram 1, (i) Ministry of Education introduced PCF in \nprimary vocational education (PVE) institutions to improve the efficient allocation of funds to the \nsubsector, that is, funding is based on the actual cost of competency-based teaching for given \noccupations and enrollment numbers in contrast to the historic lump-sum allocations when PVE \ninstitutions based their costing largely on the approved budgets of previous years; and (ii) Ministry \nof Education established incentive funds in each PVE institution under PCF, which allow flexible \nand performance-related remuneration of PVE staff and occupation-differentiated provision of \nconsumables and supplies. A legislative foundation is provided for the national qualifications \nsystem, including the national qualifications framework, to improve the matching of qualifications\u2019 \nsupply and demand. The Agency of Vocational Education (AVE) has developed and approved \nthe model center guidelines and an action plan that provides for model centers to be established \nin the form of legal entities to offer work-based learning opportunities and gradually carry out \nentrepreneurial activities to generate and retain income. A partially self-funding TVET institution \nis better able to fulfil its mandate of delivering improved and more relevant education and \nemployability outcomes. \n \n20.  Subprogram 2 will build on these improvements and support (i) rolling out the PCF scheme \nand incentive funds system-wide in TVET; (ii)  developing and approving a coherent methodology \nof competencies, qualifications, and curricula in at least three priority sectors for economic \ndiversification; and (iii) establishing all established model centers (three outside Bishkek) as legal \nentities and making them fully operational, in accordance with the approved AVE guidelines and \naction plan.  \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s experience and strong relationship with the government \nplayed an important role in identifying and implementing critical reforms (footnote 26). Strong \nvalue addition is demonstrated through (i) identifying possible policy, legal, and institutional \nsolutions  and  international  good  practices;  (ii)  conducting  policy  dialogue  and  generating \nknowledge products such as diagnostic studies; and (iii) having long-standing experience in \ndesigning and implementing TA and policy-based loans in support of economic diversification \nreforms (footnotes 1, 26-27). Developing and implementing reforms in the program would have \nbeen difficult and costly without ADB\u2019s analytical, technical, and financial support. \n \n \n33 Capacity building will continue to feature in ADB\u2019s support, given the technical nature of preparing and implementing \nPPP and the introduction of the ADB-supported Certified PPP Professional Program. \n \n ", "9 \n22.  Development  partner  coordination.  Although  no  other  development  partners  are \nproviding general budget support in 2019, support for the government\u2019s economic diversification \nefforts continues through policy dialogue and TA.34 ADB has closely coordinated the development \nof the program with development partners\u2019 interventions.35 Coordination and consultation with the \nIMF has been particularly strong. The IMF, through its resident representative in Bishkek, has \nformally expressed support for the program and welcomed its scope and coverage given the focus \non structural reforms, which will help reduce the economy\u2019s reliance on gold extraction and \nremittances. Budget support grants from ADB and other development partners will help ensure \nthat the government is able to build room for significant infrastructure investments and stabilize \npublic debt over the medium term, which is consistent with the IMF\u2019s policy advice (footnote 7). \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n23.  The country\u2019s overarching development objective is to create jobs and provide decent \nemployment and stable income for people. The effect of the reforms supported under the program \nwill be the achievement of broad-based economic growth. These reforms will primarily work \nthrough four transmission channels: (i) the agriculture sector developed, exports diversified, and \ndomestic and foreign investments increased; (ii) entrepreneurship promoted and the economic \nbase broadened through increased SME access to formal financial services, products, and \nbusiness support services; (iii) the quality and pace of PPP project selection, screening, and \npreparation improved; and (iv) economic productivity improved through skills development linked \nto industry needs.36  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n24.  The government has requested two grants not exceeding $100.0 million, comprising $50.0 \nmillion each for Subprograms 1 and 2 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund) to help finance the program. The program will help the government to meet its total \nfinancing requirements from 2019 to 2021, which are estimated at $429.3 million.37 The remaining \ngap will be filled by external financing ($30.0 million in general budget support from the Russian \nFederation  and  concessional  project  loans)  and  domestic  borrowing.  ADB  determined  the \nproposed grant size after considering the government\u2019s commitment to economic diversification \nreforms, the country\u2019s development financing needs, and the availability of financing from other \ndevelopment partners. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  The MOE is the executing agency for the program. The MOE, Ministry of Finance, Ministry \nof Agriculture, Ministry of Education, and NBKR are the implementing agencies. The program \nimplementation period is August 2018\u2013July 2021, with subprogram 1 being implemented from \nAugust 2018 to July 2019. Subprogram 2 is expected to be implemented from August 2019 to \nJuly 2021. The proceeds of the policy-based grant will be withdrawn upon effectiveness in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).38 \n \n \n \n34 The EU is providing \u20ac30 million to the sector as earmarked budget support. \n35 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2019\u20132021 Medium Term Budget Framework.

Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified category C \nfor the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities will be \nconfined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or lead to involuntary \nresettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. In addition, the program \nis classified effective gender mainstreaming. It supports the improvement of gender outcomes \nacross all four key reform areas. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  MOE.  ADB  completed  a  governance  risk  assessment  in  2018  according  to  the \nimplementation guidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.39 The \nassessment  found  that  the  country\u2019s  public  financial  management  and  public  procurement \nsystems were functioning well overall. The government, with support from development partners \nsuch as the IMF, the World Bank, and EU, is making a concerted effort to address weaknesses \nin these systems through iterative reform strategies and action plans. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.40 To \nmitigate the risks, the program focuses on areas where the government has a strong record \n(paras. 10-11) and has selected options for policy actions from the NDS 2040 that would help \nmaintain reform momentum beyond 2021 (footnotes 6 and 28), and where ADB TA has been \ndeployed to supplement the technical capacity of the implementing agencies to ensure that priority \nreforms are implemented.41  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n28.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \nagreement. As a condition to the effectiveness, all policy actions completed by the government \nas specified in the policy matrix relating to the program will have to continue to be in effect. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n29.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based grant would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Promoting Economic Diversification Program, \nand  \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $50,000,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) for subprogram 1 of the Promoting \nEconomic Diversification Program, on terms and conditions that are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the \n \nBoard.\nTakehiko Nakao \n20 August 2019  President \n \n39 ADB. 2014.
