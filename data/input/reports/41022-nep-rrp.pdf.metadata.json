Impacts on indigenous peoples \nhave  been  addressed  in  the  resettlement  framework  and  gender \nequality and social inclusion action plan.  \n \nThe  proposed  Project  has  three  components.  Component  1  will \ndevelop  an  efficient,  effective,  and  accountable  urban  water \nsupply  and  sanitation  sector  by  establishing  and  implementing \npolicies,  establishing  service  standards,  and  enhancing  sector \ncoordination.  Component  2  will  entail  development  of  safe, \naccessible, and adequate water supply and sanitation facilities in \nabout  20  small  towns.  Component  3  will  strengthen  governance \nand capacity for project management and operation. \n \nAlthough  Nepal \nits  Millennium \nis  considered  ahead  of \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) target of 73% (95% for urban and 72% \nfor  rural)  in  terms  of  access  to  an  improved  water  source,  the \nNepal  Millennium  Development  Goals:  Progress  Report  by  the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  published  in \n2005  cautions  against  optimism  because  of  serious  functionality \nproblems. Based on a survey in 2002, it was reported that water \navailability was only intermittent in many areas, half of the gravity \nflow systems in the hills needed major repair, and more than half \nof the tubewells in the Terai were contaminated. UNDP concludes \nthat  Nepal's  coverage  could  be  considerably  lower  if  the  strict \ndefinition of access to safe drinking water were applied. Access to \nimproved  sanitation  services  was  estimated  to  be  only  27%  in \n2006  according  to  the  World  Health  Organization  and  United \nNations  Children's  Fund,  and  the  MDG  target  of  53%  (67%  for \nurban and 52% for rural) for sanitation will not be met, if the rate of \nincrease in coverage between 2000 and 2006 is maintained until \n\n \nGrant Recipient  \n \nClassification  \n \n \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n \n\n \n\n\f \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n\nii \n\n \n\n2015.  Currently,  265  towns  (153  Terai  and  112  hill  towns)  are \nclassified  as  small  towns  in  Nepal,  with  a  total  population  of  3.6 \nmillion.  These  towns  are  being  developed  haphazardly,  although \nthey  are  playing  an  important  role  in  creating  economic  links \nbetween the rural areas and the country's urban economy. Water \nsupply in many small towns is deficient both in terms of coverage \nand  water  quality.  There  is  serious  and  urgent  need  to  improve \nwater supply and sanitation services in small towns.  \n \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved  health  and \neconomic  and  environmental  living  conditions  of  people  in  small \ntowns in Nepal. The expected outcome of the Project is improved, \naffordable,  and  sustainable  water  supply  and  sanitation  services \nwhich  are  governed  and  managed  by \nlocally  accountable \nrepresentative bodies.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $71.7  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $7.5 million.  \n \nA  grant  of  $45.1  million  will  be  provided  under  ADB's  Special \nFunds resources to finance 62.9% of the total project cost.  \n \nThe  Government  will  lend  a  portion  of  the  grant  proceeds, \nestimated to be about $17 million, to the Town Development Fund \n(TDF)  at  a  proposed  interest  rate  of  2%\u20133%  per  annum  with  no \nless  than  20  years  maturity,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years. \nThe  TDF  will  onlend  the  funds  to  water  users  and  sanitation \ncommittees  (WUSCs)  at  an  interest  rate  not  exceeding  5%  per \nannum  with  a  maturity  of  20  years  including  a  grace  period  of  5 \nyears. \n \nUntil 31 March 2016  \n \nSeptember 2015 \n\n \nThe  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW),  with \nresponsibility for subproject execution delegated to its Department \nof Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS). \n \nA sector efficiency improvement unit (SEIU) in the MPPW will take \nthe  lead  in  advancing  the  sector  development  (component  1).  A \nproject  management  office  (PMO)  established  in  the  DWSS  will \nbe  responsible  for  the  overall  project  planning  and  management \nfor  component  2,  including  selection  of  towns,  assistance  for \ndesign,  construction  supervision  and  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M),  and  overseeing  safeguard  compliance.  The  water  supply \nand sanitation divisional or subdivisional offices (WSSDOs) of the \nDWSS,  under  the  guidance  of  the  PMO,  will  carry  out  overall \nmanagement  of  individual  subprojects,  such  as  supporting  the \nthe \nfeasibility  studies  and  detailed  designs,  managing \n\n\f \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n \n\n \n\nthe  services  provided  by \n\nperformance  of  design  and  supervision  consultants  (DSCs), \nengaging  and  supervising \nlocal \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  providing  technical \nsupport for O&M. The regional monitoring and supervision offices \nof the DWSS will supervise and support the WSSDO in the region. \nWUSCs  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities constructed.  \n \nAll procurement to be financed under an ADB grant will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  civil  works  contract,  which  will \ninclude  the  technical  operation  of  the  system  for  1  year  after \ncompletion  of  the  construction,  will  be  made  for  each  town, \ncombining  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities.  Civil  works \ncontracts  valued  at  more \nthan  $1  million  equivalent  and \nequipment  contracts  valued  at  more  than  $500,000  will  be \nundertaken  through  international  competitive  bidding  procedures, \nwhile  civil  works  contracts  valued  at  $1  million equivalent  or  less \nand  equipment  contracts  valued  at  $500,000  or  less  will  be \nfollowing  national  competitive  bidding  procedures \nprocured \nthe  Government\u2019s  Public \nin  accordance  with \ngenerally \nProcurement Regulations 2007 and Public Procurement Act 2007 \nand acceptable to ADB. Packages valued at $100,000 or less will \nbe procured under shopping procedures. \n \nConsultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided \nto  (i)  support  sector \ndevelopment;  (ii)  support  project  management,  monitoring,  and \nlevel;  (iii)  carry  out  design  and \nevaluation  at \nconstruction  supervision \nincluding \nmonitoring  for  safeguards  compliance;  and  (iv)  provide  training \nand  capacity  development  programs  for  WUSCs  and  other \ninstitutions  on  financial,  technical,  and  managerial  aspects.  An \nestimated  2,170  person-months  (56  international  and  2,114 \nnational) of consulting services are needed.  \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  provide  a  high  level  of  water  supply \nservices  to  about  240,000  people  in  about  20  small  towns. \nSanitation  services\u2014such  as  on-site  sanitation  (private  latrines), \npublic  toilets,  wastewater  management  facilities  (if  justified),  and \nstorm  water  drainage\u2014will  also  be  provided  in  the  same  towns \nthrough  an  integrated  approach.  About  270,000  people  will  have \naccess to and use improved sanitation facilities. Supplemented by \nhealth  and  hygiene  education  programs  in  these  towns,  the \nProject will bring significant health benefits, to be measured by the \nreduction in the occurrence of waterborne diseases. Time saving \nfor water collection, in particular in hill towns, will be another major \nbenefit expected from the Project, mainly for women and children. \n \n\nindividual  subprojects, \n\nthe  central \n\nfor \n\niii\n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe  Government  is  currently  in  a  transition  to  a  new  federal \nstructure.  The  peace  process  remains  complex  and  challenging, \nand  the  ongoing  movement  in  the  Terai  region  demanding \nautonomy and adequate representation in key state institutions is \nlikely to continue. This could affect the Government's commitment \nto  sector  development  as  well  as  the  process  of  decentralization \nand  devolution  of \nthe  Government's \nfunctions.  However, \ncommitment  to  sector  efficiency  improvement  is  currently  strong \nand is expected to remain so in the near future, and the direction \nof  federalism  being  debated  is  in  line  with  increased  roles  and \nfunctions of local governments and community organizations. \n \nThe unstable security situation is likely to continue, in particular in \nthe  Terai,  and  there  is  a  risk  of  delay  in  subproject  design  and \nconstruction  due  to  difficulties  in  fielding  the  Government  staff, \nconsultants,  and  contractors.  The  Project \nimplementation \nschedule  has  taken  into  account  some  potential  delay,  but \nexperiences in the previous project show that, due to the nature of \nthe  Project\u2014which  is  provision  of  water  supply  and  sanitation \nservices to communities\u2014risks for disturbance are expected to be \nmuch smaller than projects in other sectors.  \n \nThe Project's financial sustainability assumes an appropriate tariff \nlevel  to  recover  at  least  necessary  capital  and  O&M  costs. \nAwareness raising about tariff payment and use of safe water will \nbe  started  early  in  the  project  preparation  stage  for  water  users \nand  WUSC  members,  and  realistic  assessment  will  be  made \nregarding  the  amount  of  water  to  be  used,  based  on  which  the \nappropriate tariff level will be proposed. More concessional terms \nof  subloans  from  the  TDF  to  WUSCs  will  significantly  ease  the \nburden of cost recovery.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the Second Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nUrbanization.  In  2001  Nepal  had  a  relatively  low  urbanization  level,  with  an  urban \npopulation  of  14%.  However,  internal  migration  into  urban  areas  is  rapidly  increasing  and  the \nurban  population  is  expected  to  reach  24%  by  2017.  Due  to  lack  of  proper  planning  and \nhaphazard  urban  development,  severe  deficiencies  in  all  kinds  of  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices have become a major problem for the economic and social development of the country.  \n \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation.  The  Government  of  Nepal,  with  the  assistance  of  a \n3. \nvariety  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  partners  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs),  has  made  considerable  efforts  to  provide  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation \nservices  to  people  living  in  both  the  urban  and  rural  areas  of  Nepal.  The  main  resource  for \ndomestic supplies in the Terai1 is groundwater from the shallow and deeper aquifers, whereas in \nthe hills people rely on springs and streams. The quantity and quality of, and therefore access \nto, water, however, is compromised by population and development pressures, competing uses, \nlack  of  infrastructure,  and,  in  some  cases,  poor  water  resource  management.  Shallow \ngroundwater and surface streams are the most vulnerable to contamination, including arsenic in \nsome areas. In addition, there are acute shortages during dry periods. \n\n4. \nThe  Three-Year  Interim  Plan  (FY2008\u2013FY2010)  of  the  Government  reports  that  76.6% \nof  the  population  had  access  to  basic  drinking water  services  and  45.8%  had  access  to  basic \nsanitation services in 2006. The plan sets the target of 85% for access to basic drinking water \nservices and 60% for access to basic sanitation services by the end of the interim plan period. \nThe  most  recent  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  United  Nations  Children's  Fund \n(UNICEF) joint monitoring report2 indicates even better coverage for water supply, with 94% of \nthe  urban  population  and  88%  of  the  rural  population  estimated  to  have  access  to  improved \ndrinking  water  sources  in  2006,  although  the  figures  are  substantially  lower,  at  49%  in  urban \nareas  and  11%  in  rural  areas,  in  terms  of  house  connections.  The  WHO  and  UNICEF  joint \nmonitoring  report  shows  that  improved  sanitation  is  available  to  only  27%  of  the  population \n(45% for urban and 24% for rural) in 2006. Sector analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n5. \nSmall  Towns.  In  Nepal,  small  towns  have  been  emerging  due  to  internal  migration \ncaused by inadequate economic opportunities and services and facilities in rural areas and the \nrecent conflict. In order to improve water supply and sanitation services in these small towns, in \nJanuary 2000 the Government endorsed the 15-year Development Plan for Small Towns Water \nSupply  and  Sanitation.  It  quantified  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  needs  of  small  towns, \nestimated the cost of providing the improved services, and proposed an institutional framework. \nTwo  hundred  and  nine  towns  were  identified  as  small  towns,  with  a  total  population  of  2.14 \nmillion.  In  the  8  years  to  2008,  however,  major  improvement  of  water  supply  services  was \n\n                                                 \n1  The Terai is the southern plain area bordering India. \n2  WHO and UNICEF. 2008. Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. Progress on Drinking Water \n\nand Sanitation: Special Focus on Sanitation. New York and Geneva. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nprovided  to  only  32  towns,  out  of  which  29  were  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank's \n(ADB's)  Small  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (STWSSSP-I),  and  the \nremaining three by a grant from the Government of Japan.  \n\nIn the technical assistance for preparing the Project,3 the 15-year development plan has \n6. \nbeen updated and small towns have been redefined within the framework of the National Urban \nPolicy  (2007)  as  follows:  (i)  population  of  5,000\u201340,000;  (ii)  located  on  a  road  linked  to  the \nstrategic  road  network;  and  (iii)  having  at  least  one  secondary  school  and  a  health  post  in \naddition to grid electricity, basic telecommunications, and banking. Two hundred and sixty five \ntowns  (153  Terai  towns  and  112  hill  towns)  with  a  total  population  of  3.6  million  satisfy  the \ncriteria. These towns are being developed haphazardly, although they are playing an important \nrole  in  creating  economic  links  between  the  rural  areas  and  the  country's  urban  economy. \nAccording to the original plan, only 45% of the population in small towns had access to piped \nwater supply, irrespective of the water quality,  and the current coverage is likely to be similar. \nOn  sanitation,  coverage  of  three  towns  studied  ranged  from  36%  to  81%.  Although  there  is \nserious and urgent need, support to improve water supply and sanitation services in small towns \nfrom both the Government and from development partners has been severely limited.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nService Quality of Water Supply. Although the access ratio on water supply mentioned \n7. \nabove  shows  that  Nepal  is  ahead  of  its  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  target  of  73% \n(95% for urban and 72% for rural) in 2015, the Nepal Millennium Development Goals: Progress \nReport  by  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP) 4 cautions  against  optimism \nbecause  of  serious  functionality  problems.  Based  on  a  survey  conducted  in  2002,  it  was \nreported that water availability was only intermittent in many areas, half the gravity flow systems \nin  the  hills  needed  major  repair,  and  more  than  half  the  tubewells  in  the  Terai  were \ncontaminated.  Arsenic  contamination  is  also  a  major  issue  in  some  areas  in  the  Terai  where \nwater  supply  depends  on  shallow  wells.  UNDP  concludes  that  Nepal's  coverage  could  be \nconsiderably lower if the strict definition of access to safe drinking water were applied. Taking \ninto  account  functionality  and  water  quality,  the  implication  would  be  that  Nepal  is  seriously \nbehind in achieving its MDG target for water supply. \n \n8. \nSanitation  Coverage.  There  is  strong  need  to  improve  sanitation  services  delivery, \nparticularly in small towns which are similar in terms of rural access figures, in order to meet the \nMDG  target  of  53%  (67%  for  urban  and  52%  for  rural).  Assuming  that  the  rate  of  increase  in \ncoverage between 2000 and 2006 is maintained until 2015, it appears that the MDG target for \nsanitation will not be met in either urban or rural areas.  \n \n9. \nLessons. In 2000, ADB provided a loan of $35 million for the STWSSSP-I to assist the \nGovernment in providing water supply and sanitation services in 29 small towns. The detailed \nanalysis of phase I is in Supplementary Appendix A. The STWSSSP-I, completed in November \n2008, has brought about substantial benefits in terms of (i) successfully introducing community \ninvolvement  and  strong  ownership,  (ii)  introducing  the  principle  of  cost  sharing  to  water  users \neven for the capital cost, (iii) significantly reducing the occurrence of waterborne diseases, (iv) \ngreater involvement of women in particular in community mobilization and decision making, and \n(v) savings in time and labor to fetch water, which is normally the work of women and children. \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2007.  Preparing  the  Improved  Water  Quality,  Sanitation  and  Service  Delivery  Sector  Development  Program. \n\n4  UNDP. 2005. Nepal Millennium Development Goals: Progress Report. New York.  \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\nShortcomings  observed  are  described  in  the  following  paragraphs,  together  with  the  changes \nthat have been reflected in the design of the Project.  \n \n10. \nthe \nTechnical  Sustainability.  Some  water  supply  systems  constructed  under \nSTWSSSP-I  faced  problems  such  as  poor  construction  quality,  lack  of  technical  expertise  of \nwater  users  and  sanitation  committees  (WUSCs),  and  inadequate  backup  support,  which  is \nadversely  affecting  the  effective  operation  of  the  system.  In  the  Project,  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation  divisional  or  subdivisional  offices  (WSSDOs) 5  will,  under  the  guidance  and \nsupervision of the project management office (PMO), carry out overall management of individual \nsubprojects from the planning stage, instead of establishing a town project office in each town, \nwhich  lasts  only  during  the  project  period.  The  WSSDOs  will  also  strengthen  construction \nsupervision,  assisted  by  design  and  supervision  consultants  (DSCs),  and  will  work  as  a \ntechnical  backstop  agency  for  WUSCs  even  after  completion  of  construction.  Technical \noperation of the system in the first year will be entrusted to the contractor, and this is expected \nto improve the quality of construction work.   \n \nFinancial  Sustainability.  Delay  in  construction  as  well  as  the  low  number  of  tap \n11. \nconnections  is  putting  a  number  of  WUSCs  in  the  STWSSSP-I  towns  in  a  difficult  situation  in \nrepaying  the  loan  to  the  Town  Development  Fund  (TDF)  on  time.  In  Terai  locations,  easy \navailability  of  groundwater  to  the  households  at  their  premises,  though  often  unsafe  due  to \ncontamination,  seems  to  be  the  main  reason  for  the  low  number  of  tap  connections  and  low \nwater use. Another significant reason is the high tap connection fee6 for drinking water supply. \nTo  overcome  these  bottlenecks,  subloans  from  the  TDF  in  the  Project  will  be  made  more \nconcessional, with a longer grace period (proposed to be 5 years), a longer repayment period \n(15  years  after  grace  period)  and  a  lower  interest  rate  (proposed  to  be  not  exceeding  5%  per \nannum).  Output-based  aid  (OBA)\u2014performance-based  grants  to  be  provided  primarily  to \nfacilitate  the  connection  of  poor  people's  houses  to  the  water  supply  and  to  sanitation \nservices\u2014will increase the connection of the poor without compromising financial viability.  \n \n12. \nFifteen  percent  in-kind or  cash  contribution,  on  top  of  5%  upfront  cash  contribution,  by \nWUSCs  for  the  water  supply  component  was  reported  problematic  in  the  STWSSSP-I.7 In  the \nProject,  WUSCs  will  be  given  flexibility,  with  a  choice  between  increased  borrowing  from  the \nTDF  and  its  own  initial  contribution,  depending  on  the  willingness  and  capability  of  the \nbeneficiaries. The cash contribution will be 5%\u201315%, including 5% upfront contribution, and the \nremaining 35%\u201345% will be a loan from the TDF. A reduced initial cash contribution will enable \nthe connection fee to be lowered, if not eliminated. A 50% contribution from WUSCs is in line \nwith the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy (UWSSSP) that requires communities \nand/or  municipalities  to  contribute  not  less  than  30%,  depending  upon  the  socioeconomic \nstatus. Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs will be fully recovered through tariff collection.  \n \nTraining  and  Capacity  Building. Under the STWSSSP-I, the TDF, DSC, and national \n13. \nNGOs  provided  various  types  of  technical,  financial,  and  social  training  programs  to  WUSC \nmembers. While trainings given by the TDF on financial aspects and by the DSC on technical \n\n                                                 \n5  Forty two divisional offices, 28 subdivisional offices, and 5 regional monitoring and supervision offices in 75 districts \n\nare hereinafter collectively referred to as WSSDOs.  \n\n6  The connection fee  was in the range of $100\u2013$150 per household in most towns under the STWSSSP-I. This  was \n\nseparately charged from connection costs of about $60\u2013$70 per household.  \n\n7  In reality, there was little in-kind contribution, and many towns collected high connection fees and connection costs, \namong other charges, to satisfy the total 20% requirements. Another problem observed was difficult synchronization \nbetween  the  main  contractor's  work  and  the  community  work  carried  out  using  the  community  contribution,  which \nresulted in delay and poor quality.     \n\n \n\n\faspects  were  generally  found  effective  and  appreciated  by  WUSCs,  observations  have  been \nmade that (i) training programs were not held in a timely manner, (ii) trainings were not frequent \nenough  to  create  results,  and  (iii)  participants  who  received  training  did  not  remain  in  the \nrelevant posts. The PMO, its consultants, and the DSC will plan more carefully and implement \nthe capacity building programs for WUSC members and WUSC's employees in accordance with \nthe construction schedule and progress. A monitoring mechanism to measure the effectiveness \nof  training  programs  will  be  established  by  the  PMO.  The  Central  Human  Resources \nDevelopment  Unit  (CHRDU),  under  the  Department  of  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  (DWSS), \nwill also be brought in and strengthened so that it can help equip WUSCs with more business-\noriented  management  skills,  in  addition  to  technical  and  financial  management  capabilities, \neven beyond the Project period.   \n \nPolicy and Legal Framework. Development of the legislative and policy framework for \n14. \nNepal\u2019s  water  and  sanitation  sector  is  a  relatively  recent  phenomenon,  taking  place  primarily \nover  the  last  10  years  to  2009.  The  policy  and  legal  framework  has  developed  incrementally \nwith  separate  policies  and  regulations  adopted  and  enacted  for  water  resources,  national \nsanitation, rural water supply and sanitation, water quality, and urban development. Major acts \nand  regulations  relevant  to  the  Project  include  the  Drinking Water  Regulation  (1998),  National \nWater Supply Sector Policy (1998), Local Self Governance Act (1999), Local Self Governance \nRegulations  (1999),  National  Water  Plan  (2005),  National  Drinking  Water  Quality  Standards \n(NDWQS)  (2005),  and  National  Urban  Policy  (2007).  Some  inconsistencies  are  observed \namong the acts and regulations, and translating policies and plans into actions in the context of \ndecentralization and community empowerment is a key challenge.  \n\nThe Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) has finalized and the Government \n15. \nhas subsequently approved the UWSSSP. As a next step, an action plan will be developed to \nfacilitate  policy  implementation.  The  Government  currently  does  not  have  policies  and \nguidelines  focused  on  wastewater  management,  which  will  be  another  priority  action  of  the \nMPPW.  The  Government  intends  to  develop  an  umbrella  water  supply  and  sanitation  act  by \nconsolidating  existing  acts,  although  adequate consideration  needs  to be  made  with  regard  to \nthe finalization of Nepal\u2019s new political structure and constitution which is anticipated to provide \nadditional  powers  to  local  governments  under  a  new  federated  structure  beyond  2010.  As  a \nmajor  development  partner  in  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  as  well  as  in  the  urban \nsector,  it  is  critical  that  ADB  remains  engaged  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  and \nprovides necessary support for smooth and effective sector development.  \n\nExternal Assistance. In recent years, ADB has been the largest development partner in \n16. \nthe urban water supply and sanitation sector, followed by the Government of Japan through the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and German development cooperation through \nKfW and GTZ. ADB has been chairing the development partners' group for urban development, \nand assisted the Government in drafting the UWSSSP and updating the 15-year Small Towns \nDevelopment Plan.8 External assistance is outlined in Appendix 3. JICA has recently agreed to \nprovide  technical  cooperation  for  capacity  development  on  water  supply  in  semi-urban  areas, \nunder which the technical support system of the DWSS to WUSCs is to be improved in a few \ndistricts.  GTZ  has  been  providing  support  for  strengthening  the  financial  and  management \ncapacity of the TDF under the Urban Development through Local Efforts program.  \n\n                                                 \n8  Technical  assistance  was  provided  through  the  Preparing  the  Improved  Water  Quality,  Sanitation  and  Service \n\nDelivery Sector Development Program.   \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\nSector  Lending.  The  Project  will  follow  a  sector  lending  modality.9 This  is  considered \n17. \nappropriate because (i) the Government has prepared the 15-year Development Plan for Small \nTowns Water Supply and Sanitation (2000\u20132015) and in May 2009 endorsed the updated 15-\nyear plan that is satisfactory to ADB; (ii) the MPPW and DWSS have the institutional capacity to \nimplement  the  updated  15-year  plan  with  substantial  experience  gained  through  past  ADB-\nassisted  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects  including  the  STWSSSP-I;  and  (iii)  the  MPPW \nfinalized  the  UWSSSP  in  May  2009,  also  satisfactory  to  ADB,  and  the  Government \nsubsequently  approved  it  in  August  2009.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in \nimplementing the updated 15-year plan and the UWSSSP.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n18. \nThe expected impact of the Project is improved health and economic and environmental \nliving  conditions  of  people  in  small  towns  in  Nepal.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  Project  is \nimproved, affordable, and sustainable water supply and sanitation services which are governed \nand managed by locally accountable representative bodies.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n19. \nThe Project has three components. Component 1 will develop an efficient, effective, and \naccountable  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  by  establishing  and  implementing \npolicies,  establishing  service  standards,  and  enhancing  sector  coordination.  Component  2  will \nentail  development  of  safe,  accessible,  and  adequate  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  in \nabout 20 towns. Component 3 will strengthen governance and capacity for project management \nand operation. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Developing an Efficient, Effective, and Accountable Urban \nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector \n\n20. \nThe output of component 1 is developing an efficient, effective, and accountable urban \nwater supply and sanitation sector. The Project will support sector development spearheaded by \nthe  MPPW,  in  particular  the  sector  efficiency  improvement  unit  (SEIU)  established  in  July \n2009.10  \n \n21.  While  the  legal  and  policy  framework  of  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  has \ngradually been developed over the last 10 years to 2009, the sector needs further improvement \nin terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. Initial tasks of the SEIU will include (i) \nsupporting  the  implementation  of  the  UWSSSP,  with  its  clear  monitoring  and  evaluation \nmechanism  put  in  place;  (ii)  establishing  water  supply  and  sanitation  service  standards  and \nmeasuring and monitoring performance of service levels provided by all utilities (including local \ngovernments and WUSCs); (iii) enhancing sector coordination; and (iv) assisting the formulation \nof new laws, policies, and guidelines that fall under the responsibility of the MPPW, including the \numbrella  water  supply  and  sanitation  act  and  national  technical  standards  for  sewerage  and \nwastewater  management.  This  component  will  cover  incremental  recurrent  costs  in  the  SEIU, \nequipment, and consultancy support to the SEIU. \n\n                                                 \n9  The term used in the ADB's Operations Manual (OM Section D3) was followed, although the Project is funded on a \n\ngrant basis.  \n\n10  Monitoring and Evaluation Unit for rural water supply and sanitation in the MPPW will be integrated into the SEIU. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Improvement. The SEIU will establish service standards \n22. \nfor water supply and sanitation services, performance indicators and targets, and a performance \nevaluation  system,  followed  by  actual  collection  and  compilation  of  indicators,  performance \nevaluation for improvement of the services in the medium-to-long term, and documentation and \npublication of the assessment results. In addition, the SEIU will review the governance structure \nof  WUSCs  and  other  water  supply  and  sanitation  service  providers  and  provide  guidelines  for \nimproved  governance  in  the  context  of  decentralization  and  devolution.  As  needed,  the  roles \nand  functions  of  central government  agencies,  including  the  DWSS,  will  be  redefined  to  focus \nmore on policy implementation, sector planning and monitoring, and establishment of regulation \nand technical standards. Promotion of private sector participation, including as an operator for \nservice delivery, will be examined.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Developing Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities \n\n23. \nThe  output  of  component  2  is  developing  safe,  accessible,  and  adequate  water  supply \nand sanitation facilities in about 20 towns, with an average population of 16,000 per town. This \ncomponent will be implemented in two batches, with each batch consisting of about 10 towns.11 \nThe criteria for selecting small towns and subprojects are in Appendix 4.  \n \n24.  Water Supply. Water supply in many small towns is deficient in terms of both coverage \nand quality. Coverage needs to be expanded with augmented water supply from surface water \nsources  (normally  in  the  hills)  or  from  groundwater  sources  (normally  in  the  Terai).  Even  in \nareas  where  water  is  supplied  through  a  piped  system  or  shallow  tubewells,  current  water \nsupply is usually intermittent, limited in quantity, and the quality is not suitable for drinking. The \nProject will support the development of additional water sources, construction of water treatment \nfacilities 12  and  storage  tanks,  and  rehabilitation  and/or  expansion  of  transmission  and \ndistribution systems in about 20 small towns. It is intended that the piped water supply system \nwill achieve the following service level:13 (i) increased per capita water supply (90\u2013100 liters per \ncapita per day for private house connections), (ii) 24-hour water supply with adequate residual \npressure, (iii) at least 90% coverage of the service area after 5 years of operation, (iv) treated \nwater satisfying the NDWQS, and (v) predominantly private house connections. Public\u2013private \npartnerships, through such options as service or management contracts, will be piloted in a few \ntowns.     \n \n25. \nis  essential, \nparticularly as water supply will be augmented. In Nepal, wastewater management is still in its \ninfancy and currently implemented only in a small number of large towns. In order to maximize \nthe Project benefits in terms of improving the health of beneficiaries, an integrated water supply \nand  sanitation  subproject14 will  be  planned  and  implemented  in  all  towns  under  the  Project. \nLocal NGOs will be engaged in each town for public awareness raising and health and hygiene \neducation. The Project will support construction of sanitation facilities, such as public toilets and \n                                                 \n11 For  batch  1,  towns  that  have  completed  at  least  feasibility  studies  will  be  selected.  Currently  the  detailed  design  is \navailable for 12 towns, and the feasibility study is available for 11 more towns (including 3 sample subprojects studied \nunder the project preparatory technical assistance).  \n\nSanitation.  Addressing  sanitation  and  wastewater  management \n\n12 Depending on the raw water quality, expected water treatment could include sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection \n\n(chlorination) to satisfy the NDWQS.  \n\n13 There is a minor difference from the high level of services defined in the UWSSSP which has the following criteria: (i) \nmore  than  100  liters  per  capita  per  day  of  water  supply,  (ii)  quality  meeting  NDWQS,  (iii)  fully  plumbed  within  the \nhouse,  (iv)  24  hours  supply,  and  (v)  12  months  continuity.  The  level  of  services  provided  under  the  Project  is  also \nconsidered high as the difference is minor and the Project takes account of the situation in small towns in terms of \nwater demand. \n\n14 In each town, a subproject is referred to as a town project.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\nsludge drying beds for septic tank sludge disposal, in about 20 small towns. Where population \ndensity is high and investment is economically justified, wastewater management systems will \nbe  introduced  as  pilot  projects  in  several  towns.  The  type  of  treatment  to  be  used  largely \ndepends  on  the  available  funds  and  the  land,  but  natural  treatment  systems  such  as  waste \nstabilization  ponds  or  the  reed  bed  treatment  method  are  generally  preferred  due  to  the \nrelatively small operation costs and past experiences. Each household is principally responsible \nfor on-site sanitation (private latrines), but grants through the OBA approach will be provided to \nhouseholds  to  facilitate  construction  of  private  latrines,  in  association  with  awareness  raising \nactivities.  \n \n26. \nStorm  water  drainage  is  a  major  problem  in  most  of  the  Terai  towns.  The  Project  will \nsupport  construction  of  drainage  systems  in  the  core  areas  of  the  project  towns.  Solid-waste \nmanagement will be included to ensure effective operation of sanitation facilities, with focus on \ncommunity 3R (reduce, reuse, and recycle) activities. \n \nOutput-Based  Aid.15 The  Project  proposes  a  strategy  for  using  explicit  performance-\n27. \nbased grants to deliver water supply and sanitation services primarily to the poor and vulnerable \ngroups. Under the OBA, grants will be given to service providers, i.e., WUSCs, after delivery of \nthe household connections has been verified by an independent verification agent. Grants will \nbe  provided  to  carefully  selected  households16 for  water  supply  and  sanitation  services,  the \ndetails  of  which  will  be determined  by  each  WUSC.  This will  enhance  service  delivery  without \ncompromising financial viability. The framework of the OBA is in Appendix 5.  \n \n28. \nThis  component  will  include  civil  works  and  equipment  in  about  20  towns,  OBA,  and \nproject  planning  and  implementation  support  from  the  DSC  and  local  NGOs.  To  ensure  more \neffective  and  long-term  involvement,  local  NGOs  will  be  engaged  in  each  town  to  promote \ncommunity awareness and implement a gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan \n(by contrast, national NGOs were used in the STWSSSP-I).  \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Strengthening Governance and Capacity for Project \nManagement and Operation  \n\nThis component will support smooth and effective Project implementation and operation. \n29. \nAdequate  training  and  capacity  building  programs  will  be  provided  to  WUSCs,  WSSDOs,  and \nregional  monitoring  and  supervision  office  by  the  PMC,  DSC,  TDF,  CHRDU,  and  local  NGOs. \nThe  PMO  in  DWSS,  with  the  support  from  the  PMC,  will  manage  and  monitor  overall  project \nimplementation through the project performance management system (PPMS) to be developed \nfor the Project. This component will cover the PMC, equipment, and incremental recurrent costs \nin  the  PMO  and  WSSDOs.  To  assist  WUSCs  in  getting  proactively  involved  in  construction \nmanagement  and  in  taking  over  the  system  smoothly,  the  administrative  cost  for  engaging \nmanagement  staff  to  be  retained  by  WUSCs  (who  will  take  operational  responsibility  for  the \nsystem),  will  be  partially  paid  from  this  component. 17 The  PMO,  assisted  by  the  PMC,  will \nensure  that  five  regional  water  quality  and  meter  calibration  laboratories 18  become  fully \n\n                                                 \n15 The  UWSSSP  addresses  the  OBA  to  facilitate  the  access  of  poor  people  to  water  supply  and  sanitation  services. \n\nSpecific guidelines will be prepared by the SEIU. \n\n16 It is intended that the poor will be targeted and selected for the water supply connection, while even non-poor may be \n\neligible for grants for the construction of private latrines.  \n\n17 It is proposed that 50% of the recurrent cost for engaging up to two technical and/or financial managers will be paid \n\nby the Project for a maximum of 2 years, if not later than 1 year after the completion of construction.  \n\n18 Necessary equipment has been provided under STWSSSP-I, but staff recruitment is still in progress. It is expected \n\nthat meters to be procured in the Project will have to be certified in these laboratories.   \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\noperational  so  that  these  laboratories  conduct  water  quality  testing  and  meter  calibration \nservices for WUSCs.   \n \n30. \nThe  PMO,  its  consultants,  and  the  DSC  will  plan  and  implement  the  capacity  building \nprograms  for  WUSC  members  and  employees  in  accordance  with  the  construction  schedule \nand progress.19 A monitoring mechanism to measure the effectiveness of training programs will \nbe established by the PMO as part of the PPMS. The CHRDU, under the DWSS, will be brought \nin and strengthened so that it can help equip WUSC members and/or employees with business-\noriented  management  skills,  in  addition  to  technical  and  financial  management  capabilities, \neven beyond the Project period.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n31. \nIntroduction  of  Output-Based  Aid.  OBA,  a  strategy  for  using  explicit  performance-\nbased  grants  to  deliver  basic  services  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation  where  policy \nconcerns would justify public funding to complement or replace user contribution, will be applied \nto facilitate connection of mainly poor people's houses to water supply and sanitation services. \nOBA, as an approach to help improve aid effectiveness, is increasingly being utilized by other \ndevelopment partners such as the World Bank. In the Project, WUSCs will pre-finance a part of \nthe connection costs for those eligible for OBA grants, mainly through membership fees and/or \ninitial contributions from the non-poor, and ensure the connection of poor people's houses to the \nwater  supply  and  the  construction  of  private  latrines  with  appropriate  designs.  WUSCs  will  be \nreimbursed  the  grant  amounts  by  the  Government  after  the  intended  outputs  have  been \nconfirmed by local NGOs working as verification agents. As this is the first attempt of its kind, \nspecific  guidelines  for  OBA  will  be  prepared  by  the  SEIU,  with  assistance  from  the  SEIU \nconsultants.   \n \n32. \nConstruction and First-Year Operation Contract. Smooth start-up of the operation is \nconsidered a key to the success of the Project. Inclusion of technical operation of facilities in the \nfirst year in the main civil works contract, in particular incorporating operational performance in \npayment  conditions,  is  expected  to  (i)  speed  up  the  construction,  (ii)  ensure  good  quality  of \nconstruction  work,  and  (iii)  ensure  smooth  operation  of  the  facilities.  During  the  first  year  of \noperation, management staff to be engaged by WUSCs taking operational responsibility for the \nsystem will receive full on-the-job training from the contractors to ensure the seamless transition \nafter the first year of operation.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe Project investment cost is estimated at $71.7 million, including taxes and duties of \n\n33. \n$7.5 million. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6.   \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n19 Capacity building programs would include members and/or employees of WUSCs in the STWSSSP-I towns. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\nA. \n\n \nBase Costa \n1.

The  provision  of  grant  assistance  is  justified  by  (i)  the \nnature of the Project, which is to satisfy basic needs of water supply and sanitation; (ii) the fact \nthat  it  has  pro-poor  orientation;  and  (iii)  the  country's  tight  fiscal  position.  The  grant  will  cover \n62.9% of the total project cost. The Government will provide $20.5 million equivalent to cover (i) \ntaxes  and  duties,  (ii)  a  part  of  civil  works  costs,  (iii)  a  part  of  OBA  grants,  and  (iv)  a  part  of \nincremental  recurrent  Government  staff  costs.  WUSCs  (beneficiaries)  and  local  governments \nwill contribute $6.1 million equivalent.  \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment  \nBeneficiaries and Local \nGovernments  \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount\n($ million)\n45.1 \n20.5 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.1 \n\n71.7 \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n62.9 \n28.6 \n\n8.5 \n\n100.0 \n\n \n35. \nThe  Government  will  lend  a  portion  of  the  grant  proceeds,  estimated  to  be  about  $17 \nmillion,20 to the TDF at a proposed interest rate of 2%\u20133% per annum with no less than 20 years \nmaturity,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  Final  lending  terms  and  conditions  between  the \nGovernment  and  the  TDF  will  be  mutually  agreed  upon.  All  payments  received  from  the  TDF \nunder the subsidiary loan agreement will be used for country poverty reduction programs. It has \nbeen proposed that the TDF will onlend the funds to WUSCs at an interest rate not exceeding \n\n                                                 \n20 Assumed to be 40% of the civil works and equipment cost, excluding the cost for private latrine construction.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n5% per annum with a maturity of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years. While reducing \nthe interest rates from the TDF to WUSCs from the level in the STWSSSP-I, the introduction of \na late payment charge will be examined to provide incentives for on-time payment. The balance \nof  the  grant  amount  (about  $28  million)  will  be  channeled  through  the  Government  as  a  grant \nportion,  to  be  used  for  subproject  investment  costs,  consulting  services,  and  other  costs  in \nrespect of the Project. \n \n36. \nIn each project town, water supply systems will be financed by WUSCs (50%) and the \nGovernment (50%). The initial cash contribution of WUSCs may range between 5% and 15% of \nthe  civil  works  contract,  including  a  5%  upfront  cash  contribution, 21  depending  upon  its \nwillingness  and  capability,  with  the  remaining  35%\u201345%  to  be  borrowed  from  the  TDF. 22 \nIncreasing the proportion of TDF borrowing, compared to the STWSSSP-I, will ease the burden \nof  collection  of  initial  contribution,  and  enable  gradual  recovery  through  tariff  collection. \nMoreover, the payment method will be changed to alleviate the financial burden during the initial \nyears.23 Public  sanitation  facilities24\u2014which  include  public  toilets,  sludge  drying  beds,  storm \nwater  drainage,  and  wastewater  management  (if  justified)\u2014  will  be  financed  by  WUSCs  and \nlocal governments25 (15% in total26) and the Government (85%).27 On-site sanitation will be the \nresponsibility of individual households, but grants through the OBA approach will be provided to \nhouseholds  to  facilitate  construction  of  private  latrines.  All  other  related  costs\u2014including \nconsulting  services,  NGO  services,  training,  capacity  building,  and  incremental  administrative \nexpenses\u2014will be financed by the Government using Project funds. \n \n37. \nO&M costs for water supply will be fully recovered by WUSCs, while those for sanitation \nservices (sludge management, off-site sanitation, and drainage) will be paid for by WUSCs and \nlocal governments through a mutual agreement. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n38. \nThe  MPPW  will  be  the  executing  agency,  with  responsibility  for  subproject  execution \ndelegated to the DWSS. The SEIU established in the MPPW will take the lead in advancing the \nsector  development  (component  1),  with  support  from  SEIU  consultants.  The  SEIU  will  be \n                                                 \n21 In the STWSSSP-I, an upfront 5% cash contribution and additional 15% contribution (in-kind or cash) were required. \nIn  reality,  there  was  little  in-kind  contribution,  and  many  towns  collected  high  connection  fees  ($100\u2013$150  per \nhousehold) and connection costs ($60\u2013$70 per household), among others, to satisfy the requirements. This created \nproblems,  such  as  difficult  synchronization  between  the  main  contractor's  work  and  the  community  work  (using  the \n15%  contribution)  resulting  in  delay  and  poor  quality,  and  less  connection  by  the  poor  due  to  high  initial  costs. \nSubproject costs that will not be included in the civil works contract, such as compensation for land acquisition and \nresettlement, if any, will be separately collected and paid by WUSCs. It is expected that 5%\u201315% initial contribution \nwill be made mainly through collection of connection costs.   \n\n22 This will be repaid from tariffs to be collected by WUSCs.   \n23 An  alternative  payment  method,  under  which  the  sum  of  principal  repayment  and  interest  payment  will  be  equal  in \neach  installment  throughout  the  repayment  period,  may  be  adopted  by  WUSCs,  which  is  different  from  the  equal \nprincipal  repayment  method.  These  changes  will  enable  the  tariff  level  for  recovering  payment  or  repayment  to  the \nTDF  and  full  O&M  expenditure  to  be  set  at  an  affordable  level  of  less  than  3%  of  income  even  for  low-income \nhouseholds in three sample subprojects studied under the project preparatory technical assistance. \n\n24 No cash contribution is expected from WUSCs and local governments for solid-waste management, as the scope is \n\nmostly focused on awareness raising and community mobilization for 3R activities.  \n\n25 \"Local governments\" refers to municipalities and village development committees (VDCs).  \n26 Share between WUSC and local government will be agreed upon in each town before the commencement of detailed \n\ndesign. WUSC may borrow from the TDF a part of its share.   \n\n27 Sanitation will require a higher contribution from the Government as there are limited demands from the public due to \n\nfear of high investment costs, but inclusion in the system will bring significant public health benefits. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nheaded  by  the  joint  secretary  of  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  division  and  consist  of \ndedicated staff including one at undersecretary level. The PMO established in the DWSS will be \nresponsible  for  the  overall  project  planning  and  management  for  component  2,  including \nselection  of  towns;  recruitment  of  PMC  and  DSC;  procurement  of  civil  works  contractors; \nassistance  for  design,  construction  supervision,  and  O&M;  and  overseeing  safeguard \ncompliance. The PMO will be headed by an experienced full-time project director, supported by \ntwo  full-time  deputy  project  directors.  The  WSSDO  of  the  DWSS,  under  the  guidance  of  the \nPMO,  will  carry  out  overall  management  of  individual  subprojects,  such  as  supporting  the \nfeasibility studies and detailed designs, managing the performance of the DSCs, recruiting and \nsupervising  local  NGOs,  and  providing  technical  support  for  O&M.  For  each  subproject,  a \ndedicated core group headed by a qualified engineer under the supervision of the WSSDO head \nwill  undertake  day-to-day  project management.  The  regional  monitoring  and  supervision  office \nof  the  DWSS  will  supervise  and  support  WSSDO  in  the  region.  The  implementation \narrangement is in Appendix 7.   \n \nFunctions of Water Users and Sanitation Committees.28 WUSCs will be responsible \n39. \nfor O&M of the water supply and sanitation facilities constructed. When a WUSC does not exist \ninitially, an interim service area committee (ISAC) will be first established in the feasibility stage \nby representing potential consumers. The ISAC will assist the DSC in undertaking a feasibility \nstudy, make inputs into and agree with the technical proposals, and decide on the boundaries of \nthe service areas. WUSCs will be developed from ISACs at the detailed design stage, and will \nbe responsible for (i) working with the DSC in finalizing the detailed design; (ii) land acquisition \nand  resettlement,  if  any;  (iii)  participating  in  the  bidding  evaluation  process  and  signing  the \ncontact with the main civil works contractor as a witness; (iv) fulfilling required contribution; (v) \nconcluding a subsidiary loan agreement with the TDF; (vi) supervising the construction work and \nendorsing  the  payment;  (vii)  setting  water  tariffs  at  a  level  to  cover  necessary  payment  or \nrepayment  to  the  TDF,  O&M  expenditures,  and  replacement  and  future  expansion  in \naccordance  with  the  UWSSSP;  and  (viii)  ensuring  smooth  house  connections.  After  the \nconstruction  completion,  WUSCs  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  operating  and  maintaining  the \nsystem, and expanding the system, when appropriate; (ii) collecting the tariff; and (iii) repaying \nthe  debt  to  the  TDF.  WUSCs  normally  consist  of  nine  executive  members,  at  least  three  of \nwhom are women. An operation or supervision unit is to be established under the WUSC before \nthe  construction  completion,  and  this  unit  will  operate  the  system  or  supervise  the  operator,  if \noutsourced.  After  the  first  year  of  technical  operation  by  the  contractor,  WUSCs  will  be  given \noptions  as  to  whether  they  (i)  continue  to  engage  the  same  operator  with  agreed  fees,  (ii) \nengage a separate operator through competitive bidding, or (iii) operate the system through the \nunit. \n \n40. \nLocal  Governments. Local governments, i.e., village development committees (VDCs) \nand  municipalities,  are  responsible  for  ensuring  effective  and  efficient  operation  of  the  system \nby WUSCs, and will facilitate the access of WUSCs to a TDF loan as well as the loan recovery \nfrom  the  WUSC  to  the  TDF.  They  will  also  contribute  a  part  of  investment  and  O&M \nexpenditures  for  off-site  sanitation  facilities,  in  agreement  with  WUSCs.  The  following \nagreements  will  be  concluded  for  subproject  implementation:  (i)  a  general  agreement  among \nlocal governments, WUSCs, PMO, and TDF specifying, among other things, (a) the proportion \nof cost sharing both for water supply and sanitation systems; and (b) the principle of integrated \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  tariff  collection,  and  the  OBA,  before  the  commencement  of \n\n                                                 \n28 WUSCs  are  to  be  registered  with  the  district  water  resources  committee  as  a  user  association  under  the  Water \n\nResources Act (1992).  \n\n \n\n\fdetailed design work;29 (ii) an agreement among the same four parties specifying, among other \nthings,  (a)  the  amount  of  contribution  from  each  party;  (b)  the  proposed  level  of  tariff  to  be \ncollected by WUSCs; (c) the commitment of WUSCs to recover payment and repayment, O&M \nexpenditures, replacement, and future expansion in accordance with the UWSSSP; and (d) the \ntarget  and  level  of  grant  to  be  given  under  the  OBA,  before  the  contract  award;  and  (iii)  a \nsubsidiary loan agreement between the TDF and WUSC before the contract award.  \n \n41. \nTown  Development  Fund.  The  TDF  is  a  Government-owned  autonomous  body  that \nprovides  financial,  technical,  and  institutional  support  to  the  institutions  engaged  in  town \ndevelopment. The TDF has been strengthened by gaining experiences from KfW grants and the \nSTWSSSP-I.  The  TDF  will  be  responsible  for  the  financial  sustainability  of  subprojects,  and  it \nwill (i) examine the subproject costs in connection with the repayment capabilities of the WUSCs \nin  coordination  with  the  DSCs  and  PMO;  (ii)  recommend  and  monitor  tariffs  to  cover  O&M \nexpenditures, debt service payment, and replacement and future expansion in accordance with \nthe  UWSSSP;  (iii)  provide  training  in  tariff  setting,  bookkeeping,  accounting,  and  financial \nmanagement to members and/or employees of WUSCs; and (iv) disburse and collect loans. The \nTDF may, in consultation with the DWSS, send the records of payment and/or repayment from \nWUSCs  and  the  performance  of  local  governments  as  a  facilitator  to  the  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment (MLD) to seek necessary support from the ministry. Assessment of the TDF is in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \n42. \nCentral  Human  Resources  Development  Unit. The CHRDU was established in 1987 \nwithin the DWSS to work as the center for human resource development for water supply and \nsanitation  services.  The  CHRDU  will  provide  training  on  technical  matters  and  management \nskills  such  as  business  plan  development,  management  of  outsourcing,  and  customer \nrelationships.  The  PMO  will  support  strengthening \nthrough \ndevelopment of appropriate programs and training of resource persons.   \n \nCoordination Committees. At the central level, a project coordination committee will be \n43. \nset up with the secretary of the MPPW as the chair and the joint secretary of the MPPW as the \nalternate  chair.  The  committee  will  comprise  the  director  general  of  the  DWSS,  the  executive \ndirector  of  the  TDF,  and  senior  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  MLD,  the \nMinistry  of  Health  and  Population,  the  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice,  and  the  National  Planning \nCommission.  The  PMO  director  will  serve  as  member-secretary.  The  project  coordination \ncommittee will meet at least twice a year to review the overall progress and discuss key issues \nto  be  addressed  at  the  central  level.  In  each  town,  a  town  project  coordination  committee \n(TPCC)  will  be  established.  If  a subproject  is  implemented  in  a  municipality,  the  TPCC  will  be \nchaired  by  the  mayor 30 of  the  municipality,  and  represented  by  the  executive  officer  of  the \nmunicipality,  WSSDO,  and  WUSC.  If  it  is  located  in  a  VDC,  the  TPCC  will  be  chaired  by  the \nhead of the WSSDO, and represented by the WUSC and the VDC, until political leadership31 is \nin place in the VDC, after which time the VDC chair will co-chair the TPCC. Representatives of \neducation and health units of local governments will also be members of the TPCC, to ensure \nthe  sustained  efforts  for  health  and  hygiene  education  beyond  the  construction  period. \nRepresentatives  from  the  district  development  committee,  PMO,  regional  monitoring  and \nsupervision office, TDF, the contractor, DSC, and local NGO will also be invited when needed. \nTPCCs  will  meet  quarterly,  or  as  often  as  necessary,  to  oversee  the  subproject  progress  and \n\nthe  CHRDU \n\nfunctions  of \n\n                                                 \n29 This will mean the commencement of detailed design review for towns where the detailed design is already available. \n30 Until the mayor is elected, the chief executive officer deputed from the MLD, acting as mayor, will chair the TPCC.   \n31 Political leadership refers to either the elected chair, or the chair selected via consensus among political parties.  \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\neffectiveness of all relevant activities and discuss any issues to ensure smooth implementation \nand operation. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n44. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  and  is  expected  to  end  in  September \n2015. Start-up activities will include establishing the PMO and SEIU, recruiting consultants and \nproject  staff,  and  selecting  towns  under  batch  1.  Component  2  will  be  implemented  in  two \nbatches, each consisting of about 10 towns, and the construction period is expected to be from \nJuly 2011 to June 2013 for batch 1 and from July 2012 to June 2014 for batch 2. The Project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n45. \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  under  an  ADB  grant  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  civil  works \ncontract, which will include the technical operation of the system for 1 year after completion of \nthe  construction,  will  be  made  for  each  town,  combining  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities. \nCivil works contracts valued at more than $1 million equivalent and equipment contracts valued \nat more than $500,000 will be undertaken through international competitive bidding procedures, \nwhile  civil  works  contracts  valued  at  $1  million  equivalent  or  less  and  equipment  contracts \nvalued  at  $500,000  or  less  will  be  procured  following  national  competitive  bidding  procedures \ngenerally  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Regulations  2007  and \nPublic Procurement Act 2007 and acceptable to ADB. Packages valued at $100,000 or less will \nbe  procured  under  shopping  procedures.  The  procurement  plan  is  in  Appendix  9,  and  the \nprocurement capacity assessment report and recommendations are in Supplementary Appendix \nC. \n \nthe \nAdvance  Contracting  and  Retroactive  Financing.  ADB  has  approved \n46. \nGovernment's  request  of  advance  contracting  for  engaging  the  PMC,  DSC,  SEIU  consultants \nand local NGOs, and retroactive financing for (i) the services to be provided by the consultants \nand NGOs, and (ii) the operation of the PMO and SEIU. Retroactive financing will be up to 20% \nof the total ADB grant amount for eligible expenditures incurred prior to grant effectiveness but \nnot earlier than 12 months prior to the signing of the grant agreement and in accordance with \nADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  for  the \nrecruitment  of  PMC,  DSC,  SEIU  consultants,  and  local  NGOs.  The  Government  has  been \nadvised that ADB's approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing would not commit \nADB to subsequently approve and finance the Project.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n47. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  to  (i)  support  project  management,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation  at  the  central  level;  (ii)  support  sector  development;  (iii)  carry  out  design  and \nconstruction  supervision  for  individual  subprojects,  including  monitoring  for  safeguards \ncompliance; and (iv) provide training and capacity development programs for WUSCs and other \ninstitutions  on  financial,  technical,  and  managerial  aspects.32 The  PMC,  to  be  recruited  by  the \nPMO,  will  require  24  person-months  of  international  expertise  and  308  person-months  of \n\n                                                 \n32 Training may include overseas field visits for government officials, including project staff, for issues such as service \n\nlevel benchmarking, water safety, and wastewater management.  \n\n \n\n\fnational  expertise.  The  SEIU  will  recruit  the  SEIU  consultant,  which  will  require  32  person-\nmonths of international expertise and 120 person-months of national expertise. Three DSCs will \nbe  engaged  in  each  batch,  all  to  be  recruited  by  the  PMO,  with  each  contract  covering  3\u20134 \ntowns. In total, all contracts for the DSCs will require 1,686 person-months of national expertise. \nThe  proposed  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  D,  E,  and  F.  All \nconsulting  firms  will  be  selected  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method  with  a \nstandard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. \n \nLocal NGOs will be engaged for each town by the WSSDO to (i) inform communities and \n48. \nassist  with  the  formulation  of  ISACs  and/or  WUSCs,  (ii)  conduct  socioeconomic  surveys  and \nidentify those eligible for OBA grants, (iii) provide health and hygiene education, (iv) implement \nthe GESI action plan, (v) support the implementation of house connections under the OBA, and \n(vi)  assist  with  the  implementation  of  resettlement  plans.  Local  NGOs  will  also  act  as  an \nindependent  verification  agent  under  the  OBA  framework  to  verify  that  agreed  outputs  have \nactually been delivered. The WSSDO will engage local NGOs using selection criteria including \n(i)  experience  relevant  to  the  project  objectives,  (ii)  ties  with  the  project  town,  (iii)  financial \nintegrity, and (iv) record of proven competence in group formation. The proposed outline terms \nof reference are in Supplementary Appendix G.   \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n49. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n50. \nTransparency. The Project intends to maximize transparency. The DWSS will set up a \nwebsite  within  2  months  from  the  grant  effectiveness  and  disclose  all  key  project-related \ninformation, including the main framework of the Project, criteria for selecting small towns and \nsubprojects,  results  of  town  selection,  project  safeguard  reports  such  as  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  and  resettlement  plans,  and  project  progress  such  as  procurement  and \ncontract  award.  WUSCs  will  also  fully  disclose  town  project-related  information\u2014such  as \nsubproject  cost,  cost-sharing  arrangement,  progress  of  construction,  connection  cost  and  fee, \nfinancial status, available grant scheme (OBA), and the endorsed list of those eligible for OBA\u2014\nthrough  public  briefings,  bulletin  boards,  or  at  the  general  assembly  of  the  WUSC.  Full \ninformation disclosure and participatory monitoring are expected to be effective in reducing the \nrisk  of  corruption  and  improving  governance  at  central  and  local  levels.  Grievances  regarding \nsubprojects will be first addressed at WUSCs, but if not completely redressed, they will then be \ndiscussed at the TPCC.    \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n51. \nGrant  disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. To ensure the timely release of grant proceeds and to expedite project \nimplementation, the Government will, immediately after grant effectiveness, establish an imprest \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\naccount  at  the  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  for  the  Project  for  the  MPPW.  The  initial  and  maximum \namount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  estimated  ADB-financed \nexpenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the grant, whichever is less.  \n \nThe  imprest  account  will  be  established,  maintained,  audited,  and  liquidated  in \n52. \naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements between the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  adopted  to \nreimburse  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidate  advances  provided  into  the  imprest  account.  Any \nindividual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  SOE  procedure  will  not  exceed  the \nequivalent of $100,000.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n53. \nThe DWSS will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on project implementation. It \nwill  prepare  information  on  the  Project's  physical  progress  and  status  of  project  management \n(components  2  and  3),  and  consolidate  them  with  other  issues  (mainly  component  1)  and \nsubmit a combined report to ADB within 1 month of the end of the applicable period. Within 6 \nmonths of physical completion of the Project, the DWSS will submit to ADB a project completion \nreport. \n \nFinancial  management  assessment  undertaken  for  the  DWSS  and  TDF  has  revealed \n54. \nthat they have satisfactory financial management arrangements and project accounting systems \nin  place,  gained  through  experience  of  working  on  ADB  projects  in  the  past.  The  DWSS  will \nmaintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  to  facilitate  identification  of  all  goods  and \nservices financed by the grant proceeds and counterpart funds. The PMO will be staffed with an \nadequate number of suitably qualified accounting personnel. Consolidated project accounts and \nrelated financial statements will be audited annually by the auditor general. The Government will \nsubmit  to  ADB,  within  9  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year,  audited  reports  and  related \nfinancial statements, which include a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account \nand  SOE  procedure.  The  TDF  will  be  subject  to  annual  audit  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB, \nand  will  submit  to  ADB  a  copy  of  the  audited  statements  of  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements  within  9  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  Furthermore,  ADB  reserves  the \nright to verify the financial accounts of the DWSS and TDF to confirm that the share of ADB\u2019s \nfinancing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures.  Financial  management \ncapacity of WUSCs needs to be strengthened, and the TDF and consultants will provide support \nfor their capacity development.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n55. \nThe PMO will establish a PPMS, with the support of the PMC, in line with ADB's PPMS \nframework.  The  system  will  ensure  that  the  project  components  are  managed  efficiently  and \nbenefits  are  maximized.  The  PPMS  developed  by  the  DWSS  in  the  STWSSSP-I  will  be \nimproved  in  terms  of  better  collection  of  baseline  data\u2014such  as  incidence  of  water-related \ndiseases  and  quality  and  quantity  of  water  supply  services  available,  and  the  level  of  on-site \nsanitation  facilities\u2014disaggregated  by  income  levels,  sex,  caste,  and  ethnicity.  Under  the \nguidance of the SEIU, the PMO will conduct a benchmark survey for batch 1 towns and submit \nfor  ADB's  review  and  concurrence  an  implementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and \npreparing  benchmark  information  within  9  months  of  grant  effectiveness.  These  baseline \nsurveys will be conducted in accordance with the design and monitoring framework and provide \nthe basis for preparing the benchmark information and targets. After the initial survey, the PMO \n\n \n\n\fwill  submit  annual  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  to  ADB  throughout  project \nimplementation, and a comprehensive completion survey.   \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n56. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  the  Project  at  least  twice  a  year.  This \nincludes  (i)  the  performance  of  the  SEIU,  DWSS,  TDF,  PMO,  regional  monitoring  and \nsupervision  offices,  WSSDOs,  WUSCs,  consultants,  NGOs,  and  contractors;  (ii)  progress  of \nsector  development,  physical  progress  of  subprojects,  and  capacity  building;  (iii)  inclusion  of \npoor  and  vulnerable  groups  in  subproject  planning  and  implementation;  (iv)  compliance  with \ngrant  assurances;  and  (v)  assessment  of  subproject  sustainability  in  technical  and  financial \nterms.  In  addition  to  the  regular  reviews,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive midterm review in the third year of project implementation to identify problems \nand  constraints  encountered  and  suggest  measures  to  address  them.  Specific  items  to  be \nreviewed  will  include  (i)  appropriateness  of  scope,  design,  implementation  arrangements,  and \nschedule of activities, including the OBA; (ii) assessment of implementation pace against project \nindicators;  (iii)  effectiveness  of  training  and  capacity  building;  (iv)  evaluation  of  the  policy \nimplementation, establishment, and monitoring of service standards and sector coordination for \neffective and efficient sector development; (v) compliance with safeguard measures; (vi) extent \nto  which  the  GESI  is  being  met  in  subprojects;  (vii)  lessons  learned,  good  practices,  and \npotential for replication; and (viii) changes recommended.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Benefits and Impacts  \n\n57. \nThe Project is expected to provide a high level of water supply services to about 240,000 \npeople in about 20 small towns by the end of the Project. Sanitation services, such as on-site \nsanitation  (private  latrines),  public  toilets,  wastewater  management  facilities  (if  justified),  and \nstorm water drainage, will also be provided in the same towns through an integrated approach. \nAbout 270,000 people will have access to and use improved sanitation facilities by the end of \nthe  Project.  Supplemented  by  health  and  hygiene  education  programs  in  these  towns,  the \nProject will bring significant health benefits, to be measured by the reduction in the occurrence \nof  waterborne  diseases.  Time  savings  for  water  collection,  particularly  in  hill  towns,  will  be \nanother  major  benefit  expected  from  the  Project,  and  this  will  mainly  benefit  women  and \nchildren.  \n \n58.  Water  supply  and  sanitation  subprojects  will  bring  significant  economic  benefits, \nalthough health and environmental benefits in particular from sanitation subprojects are hard to \nquantify due to the lack of area-specific data. The economic analysis of subprojects has been \nconducted  for  the  three  sample  subprojects,  and  these  subprojects  have  been  found  to  be \neconomically viable (Supplementary Appendix H), with economic internal rates of return ranging \nfrom  15.6%  to  20.9%.  These  subprojects  have  also  been  found  to  be  financially  sustainable \n(Supplementary Appendix I). The financial analysis found that the tariff level to cover O&M costs \nand loan repayments throughout the project period would be within 3% of the monthly income, \neven for poor households.  \n \n59. \nGender  Equality  and  Social  Inclusion.  The  Project  will  implement  the  GESI  Action \nPlan  (Appendix  10)  to  address  different  impacts  on,  and  needs  of,  women,  the  poor,  and \nvulnerable  groups.  Gender  mainstreaming  in  overall  project  planning,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  processes  will  be  effectively  applied  for  gender-responsive  service \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\ndelivery.  Women  will  directly  benefit  from  the  Project  in  terms  of  their  participation  in  WUSCs \nand in decision-making processes. It is expected that the piped water system will lead to time \nand labor savings for collecting water\u2014especially for women and children\u2014thereby increasing \nthe  possibility  of  women's  engagement \nin  productive  economic,  social,  and  capacity \ndevelopment activities.  \n \n60. \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  socially  and  economically  vulnerable  caste  and \nindigenous groups. Dalits,33 indigenous peoples, Muslims, and other minorities will be given due \nattention  to  equally  benefit  from  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems.  The  OBA \napproach will ensure that the poor among these groups are adequately included and connected \nto water supply and sanitation services. Social mobilization through local NGOs will help raise \nawareness  among  these  groups  and  facilitate  their  effective  participation  in  WUSCs.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11.  \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\nEnvironmental  Safeguards.  The  Project  is  classified  category  B  in  accordance  with \n61. \nADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The \nDWSS has prepared IEEs for three sample subprojects (Supplementary Appendix J) as part of \nthe  feasibility  study,  and  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  (EARP).  The \nEARP  has  specified  the  requirements  for  project  screening  and  classification,  environmental \ncriteria  for  selection  of  subprojects,  information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  the  affected \npeople including the establishment of grievance redress committees, environmental assessment, \nand  development  of  an  environmental  management  plan.  Following  the  EARP,  the  DSC  will \nprepare an IEE or an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and monitor the implementation \nof the environmental management plan, with guidance from the WSSDO and PMO. IEEs will be \napproved  by  the  MPPW,  while  EIAs  (if  needed)  will  be  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  the \nEnvironment. EIA reports of category A and IEE reports of category B-sensitive subprojects (if \nany) will also be submitted to ADB for review and concurrence. The PMO will be responsible for \nensuring  that  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  will  be  implemented  to  meet  the \nGovernment laws and regulations and ADB's Environment Policy.  \n \nThe  summary  environmental  assessment  of  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  12  and  the  full \n62. \nEARP  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K.  The  IEE  reports  found  that  the  planned  subprojects \nwould  have  only  small  and  localized  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment  and  these  can  be \nmitigated. Mitigation measures and monitoring plans have been proposed in the IEE. Because \nof the small size of the subprojects and scattered location of towns to be selected, cumulative \nand  long-term  negative  environmental  impacts  are  not  anticipated.  Improvement  in  sanitation \nand solid-waste management, together with wastewater management in a few pilot towns, will \nhave significant positive impacts on community hygiene and sanitary conditions.  \n \n63. \nSocial  Safeguards.  The  Project's  category  for  involuntary  resettlement  is  B  in \naccordance with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Out of three sample subprojects \nstudied,  two  require  small-scale  land  acquisition  for  water  and/or  wastewater  treatment  plants \nand  reservoir  tanks,  and  thus  short  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  (Supplementary \nAppendix  L).  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  Government's  and  ADB's  policy  requirements,  a \nresettlement  framework  to  guide  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  subprojects  has  been \nformulated by the DWSS. Its summary is in Appendix 13 and the full resettlement framework is \nin Supplementary Appendix M. If any subprojects require land acquisition and/or resettlement, a \n\n                                                 \n33 Dalit refers to the lowest caste (\"untouchable\") in the Hindu caste system. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nresettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  based  on  the  resettlement  framework.  WUSCs  will  be \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  and  the  DWSS  will  ensure  that \nWUSCs  comply  with  the  resettlement  framework  and  the  resettlement  plan.  Local  NGOs  will \nundertake the external monitoring for the resettlement plan implementation. Subprojects that will \ncause  significant  resettlement  impacts  will  not  be  selected,  although  such  impacts  are  not \nanticipated because of their nature and scale.34 Special compensation measures for vulnerable \ngroups, including indigenous people, are also included in the resettlement framework. \n \nThe  Project's  category  for  indigenous  people  is  B  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on \n64. \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998).  The  Government  has  recognized  59  different  ethnic  groups  as \nindigenous people, and they comprise 37% of the total population. All three sample subprojects \nidentified indigenous people in the subproject areas, and the same is likely for most subprojects. \nWith  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  improvement,  subprojects  are  expected  to  result  in \nimproved  health  and  time  savings  benefits  for  indigenous  people.  Some  indigenous  people \nmaintain  distinct  social and  cultural  traditions, but  most  indigenous  people  in  subproject  areas \nare economically and politically integrated into the mainstream society. Considering the nature \nand scale of these subprojects, impacts are considered minor and specific actions favorable to \nindigenous people will be a part of the integrated GESI action plan.  \n \nC. \n\nMajor Assumptions and Risks \n\n65. \nPolitical  Stability  and  Commitment. The Government is in transition to a new federal \nstructure, with the new constitution expected to be finalized and approved in 2010. The peace \nprocess  remains  complex  and  challenging,  and  the  ongoing  movement  in  the  Terai  region \ndemanding autonomy and adequate representation in key state institutions is likely to continue. \nThis could affect the Government's commitment to sector development as well as the process of \ndecentralization and devolution of functions. However, the Government's commitment to sector \nefficiency  improvement  is  strong  and  is  expected  to  remain  so  in  the  near  future,  and  the \ndirection  of  federalism  being  debated  is  in  line  with  increased  roles  and  functions  of  local \ngovernments and community organizations.  \n \n66. \nSecurity in the Terai. The unstable security situation is likely to continue, particularly in \nthe Terai, and there is a risk of delay in subproject design and construction due to difficulties in \nfielding  the  Government  staff,  consultants,  and  contractors.  The  Project  implementation \nschedule has taken into account some potential delay, but experiences in the STWSSSP-I show \nthat, due to the nature of the Project\u2014which is provision of water supply and sanitation services \nto  communities\u2014risks  for  disturbance  are  expected  to  be  much  smaller  than  projects  in  other \nsectors.  \n \n67. \nProblems  of  intimidation  and  collusion  in  procurement  are  reportedly  widespread,  and \nthe  extent  appears  to  be  greater  in  the  Terai.  It  is  reported  that  change  in  the  bid  submission \nvenue  from  districts  to Kathmandu  would  considerably  reduce  such  risks.  Accordingly,  the  bid \nsubmission venue for the Project will be Kathmandu, as contractors are centrally procured. An \ninternational  procurement  and  contract  management  specialist  will  be  engaged  in  the  initial \nperiod  of  the  Project,  to  ensure  that  risks  of  collusion  and  intimidation  in  procurement  are \nminimized. The Government, led by the Ministry of Finance, has also taken this issue seriously \n\n                                                 \n34 Involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  considered  significant  when  200  or  more  people  experience  major  impacts. \n\"Major impacts\" is defined as involving affected people (i) being physically displaced from housing; and/or (ii) having \n10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets lost.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\nand  started  discussions  on  specific  actions  with  various  line  ministries  and  development \npartners including ADB.   \n \n68. \nTariff  Setting  and  Cost  Recovery.  The  Project's  financial  sustainability  assumes  an \nappropriate tariff level to recover necessary capital and O&M costs. WUSCs have the tendency \nto  keep  the  tariff  level  lower  than  that  proposed  by  the  consultant  and  the  TDF  during  the \ndetailed design stage. Water users, especially those in the Terai, may continue to use cheaper \nbut unsafe water sources (e.g., shallow tubewells), which would lower the total amount of tariff \ncollected. Awareness raising about tariff payment and use of safe water will be started early in \nthe project preparation stage for water users and WUSC members, and realistic assessment will \nbe made regarding the amount of water to be used, based on which the appropriate tariff level \nwill be proposed. More concessional terms of subloans from the TDF to WUSCs will significantly \nease  the  burden  of  cost  recovery.  More  effective  capacity  building  programs  for  WUSCs  are \nexpected to improve business planning, technical operation, and financial management.   \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n69. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nMOF  will  lend  a  portion  of  ADB  funds  to  TDF  under  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement, \nwith proposed terms of an interest rate of 2%\u20133% per annum with not less than 20 \nyears maturity including a grace period of 5 years, to be mutually agreed upon by the \nGovernment and TDF. TDF will onlend such funds to WUSCs with proposed terms of \nan interest rate not exceeding 5% per annum and for a repayment period of 20 years \nincluding a 5-year grace period. \nMOF and TDF will finalize the lending agreement and TDF will finalize the standard \nonlending agreement with WUSCs, prior to the first disbursement in respect of civil \nworks  and  goods  with  respect  to  component  2,  ensuring  that  both  agreements  are \nacceptable to ADB. \nThe  Government  will  provide  all \nimplementation on a timely and regular basis. \nThe  Government  will  provide  adequate  support  and  assistance  to  SEIU  so  as  to \nensure proper implementation of the UWSSSP and the sector development referred \nto in paragraph 21. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  necessary  technical  and  financial  support  will  be \nprovided to WUSC for O&M of the schemes developed under the Project. \nThe Government will ensure that there will be no overlap of activities between ADB-\nfunded subprojects and projects funded by other development partners. \n\nrequired  counterpart \n\nfor  project \n\nfunds \n\n(vii)  MPPW will ensure that all subprojects are selected and implemented in accordance \nwith the town and subproject selection criteria agreed between ADB and MPPW and \nset out in Appendix 4. \n\n(viii)  MPPW  will  ensure  that  framework  and  guidelines  regarding  the  establishment  and \noperation  of  OBA,  to  be  developed  in  accordance  with  Appendix  5,  will  be \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \nDWSS  will  ensure  that,  within  1  year  of  grant  effectiveness,  five  regional  water \nquality and meter calibration laboratories will become fully operational. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  funds  to  cover  the  costs  of  land \nacquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner.  All \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\fland  and  right-of-way  required  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner,  and \ncompensation  at  replacement  value  and  other  entitlements  will  be  paid  to  affected \npeople  prior  to  the  award  of  any  civil  works  contract.  Any  involuntary  resettlement \nand land or asset acquisition will be carried out in compliance with ADB's Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), the resettlement framework agreed between MPPW and \nADB,  the  resettlement  plan  for  the  subproject,  and  relevant  national  laws  and \nregulations.  \n\n(xi)  MPPW  will  ensure  compliance  with  ADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002),  relevant \nnational  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  and  the  EARP.  All  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  mechanisms  set  out  in  the  IEEs  or  EIAs,  as  well  as  EARPs,  will  be \ncomplied  with  throughout  Project  implementation.  DWSS  will  ensure  environmental \nrequirements  are  incorporated  in  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts,  and \nthat environmental monitoring is undertaken by DSC and its results are incorporated \ninto quarterly progress reports. \n\n(xii)  MPPW will ensure compliance with ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable \nlabor  laws,  do  not  employ  child  labor  as  defined  in  national  legislation  for \nconstruction  and  maintenance  activities,  and  do  not  differentiate  wages  between \nmen and women for work of equal value.  \n\n(xiv)  Within 9 months of grant effectiveness, DWSS will conduct a benchmark survey for \nbatch 1 towns and submit for ADB's review and concurrence an implementation plan \nfor monitoring performance and preparing benchmark information.  \n\n(xv)  DWSS  will  ensure  that  the  following  agreements  will  be  concluded  for  subproject \nimplementation: (a) a general agreement among local governments, WUSCs, PMO, \nand  TDF  specifying,  among  other  things,  the  proportion  of  cost-sharing  both  for \nwater supply and sanitation systems, and the principle of integrated water supply and \nsanitation,  tariff  collection,  and  the  OBA,  before  the  commencement  of  detailed \ndesign work; (b) an agreement among the same four parties specifying, among other \nthings, the amount of contribution from each party, the proposed level of tariff to be \ncollected  by  WUSCs,  the  commitment  of  WUSCs  to  recover  payment  and \nrepayment,  O&M  expenditures,  replacement,  and  future  expansion  in  accordance \nwith  the  UWSSSP,  and  the  target  and  level  of  grant  to  be  given  under  the  OBA, \nbefore  the  contract  award;  and  (c)  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the  TDF \nand WUSC before the contract award. Standard agreements satisfactory to ADB are \nprepared before such steps are taken for the first subproject. \n\n(xvi)  The Government will ensure that the TDF will maintain its own financial sustainability \nby (a) making adequate provisions for nonperforming assets, (b) maintaining a debt \nservice  coverage  ratio  of  at  least  1.1  times,  and  (c)  exercising  such  other  due \ndiligence and good banking practices as required for a prudent financial institution.  \n\n(xvii)  MPPW  will  ensure  that  GESI  are  duly  considered  and  incorporated  in  project \nplanning  and  implementation  in  accordance  with  the  Project's  GESI  action  plan  set \nout in Appendix 10.  \n\nCondition for First Disbursement  \n\n70. \nThe subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory  to ADB, will have been duly executed and \ndelivered between MOF and TDF prior to the first disbursement in respect of any civil works and \ngoods with respect to component 2. \n \n \n \n\n20 \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\n71. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding  $45,100,000  to  Nepal  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  for  the  Second  Small \nTowns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project,  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Grant  and  Project  Agreements \npresented to the Board. \n\n25 August 2009 \n\n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \nImproved health and \neconomic and \nenvironmental living \nconditions of people \nin small towns in \nNepal \n\nOutcome \nImproved, \naffordable, and \nsustainable water \nsupply and \nsanitation services \nwhich are governed \nand managed by \nlocally accountable \nrepresentative \nbodies  \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\u2022  Health statistics \nfrom clinics and \nhealth centers in \ntowns \n\n\u2022  Government survey \ncompiled in MDG \nreports  \n\u2022  Town data \n\npublished in SEIU \nreports \n\n \n \n\u2022  Household surveys \ncompiled in BME \nreports \n\n\u2022 Data from each \n\ntown compiled in \nADB project \ncompletion report  \n\u2022  Government/SEIU \n\nreports \n\n\u2022  Household surveys \n\nand national \ncensuses \nassembled in JMP\u2013\nMDG reports \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators\nIn 20 towns: \n\u2022  Reduction in reported cases of \nwater- and sanitation-related \ndiseases (by 30% by 2017) \n\u2022  Quality of Life (QOL) index to \nbe developed by SEIU and \ncompared between pre- and \npost-project period  \n\n \n\u2022  240,000 people in 20 small \ntowns have access to higha \nlevel water service by 2015 \n\n\u2022  Reduced time for fetching water \n(essentially to zero in all towns) \nby 2015 \n\n\u2022  270,000 people have access to \nand use improved sanitationb \nfacilities by 2015 \n\n\u2022  Wastewater in at least three \n\ntowns is disposed of in a way \nthat meets environmental \nstandardsc by 2015 \n\n\u2022  Operation of water supply and \nwastewater services with full \nO&M cost recovery is \nimplemented by WUSCs in 20 \ntowns by 2015 \n\n \n\nOutputs \n1.

The Three-Year Interim Plan (FY2008\u2013FY2010) of the Government reports that 76.6% \nof  the  population  had  access  to  basic  drinking water  services  and  45.8%  had  access  to  basic \nsanitation  services  in  2006,  and  sets  the  target  of  85%  of  the  population  with  access  to  basic \ndrinking  water  services  and  60%  with  access  to  basic  sanitation  services  by  the  end  of  the \ninterim  plan  period.  The  most  recent  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  United  Nations \nChildren's  Fund  (UNICEF)  joint  monitoring  report 1 indicates  even  better  coverage  for  water \nsupply,  with  94%  of  the  urban  population  and  88%  of  the  rural  population  estimated  to  have \naccess to improved drinking water sources in 2006, although the figures are substantially lower, \nat 49% in urban areas and 11% and rural areas, in terms of house connections.  \n\n2. \nAlthough  these  figures  show  that  Nepal  is  ahead  of  its  Millennium  Development  Goal \n(MDG) target of 73% (95% for urban and 72% for rural) for access to improved water source in \n2015,  the  Nepal  Millennium  Development  Goals:  Progress  Report  by  UNDP  cautions  against \noptimism because of serious functionality problems.2 Based on a survey in 2002, it was reported \nthat water availability was only intermittent in many areas, half of the gravity flow systems in the \nhills needed major repair, and more than half of the tubewells in the Terai were contaminated. \nArsenic  contamination  is  also  a  major  issue  in  some  areas  in  the  Terai  where  water  supply \ndepends on shallow wells. UNDP concludes that Nepal's coverage could be considerably lower \nif  the  strict  definition  of  access  to  safe  drinking  water  were  applied.  Taking  into  account \nfunctionality  and  water  quality,  the  implication  would  be  that  Nepal  is  seriously  behind  in \nachieving its MDG target for water supply. \n \n3. \nThe  WHO  and  UNICEF  joint  monitoring  report  shows  that  improved  sanitation  is \navailable to 45% of the urban population but only to 24% of the rural population in 2006. As the \nsituation in small towns is likely to be much closer to the rural figures, there is strong need to \nimprove sanitation services delivery to meet the MDG target of 53% (67% for urban and 52% for \nrural).  Assuming  that  the  rate  of  increase  in  coverage  between  2000  and  2006  is  maintained \nuntil 2015, it appears that the MDG target for sanitation will not be met in either urban or rural \nareas.  \n \n4. \nFor  the  households  that  do  have  sanitary  latrines,  these  are  usually  pour-flush  latrines \nconnected to a disposal pit or to a septic tank. The liquid effluent either infiltrates into the ground \nor  is  discharged  to  surface  water  drains  as  there  are  no  sewer  systems  in  the  smaller  urban \nareas.  Using  storm  water  drainage  as  sanitary  sewers  in  this  way  is  a  widespread  practice  in \nNepal,  and  is  a  principal  factor  in  pollution  of  the  nation\u2019s  watercourses.  Wastewater \nmanagement  is  still  in  its  infancy  and  currently  implemented  only  in  a  small  number  of  large \ntowns.  \n\nB. \n\nSmall Towns Water Supply and Sanitation \n\nThe  15-year  Development  Plan  for  Small  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  was \n5. \nendorsed  by  the  Government  in  January  2000.  It  defined  small  towns  (209  towns  with  a  total \npopulation  of  2.14  million),  quantified  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  needs  of  small  towns, \nestimated the cost of providing the improved services, and proposed an institutional framework. \n\n                                                 \n1  WHO and UNICEF. 2008.

Nepal Millennium Development Goals: Progress Report. New York.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n27\n\nSmall towns were further classified in terms of water supply coverage as good (existing piped \nwater supply coverage equal to or higher than 75%), satisfactory (between 30% and 75%), and \npoor  (less  than  30%).  In  the  8  years  to  2008,  however,  improved  water  supply  services  were \nprovided  to  only  32  towns,  out  of  which  29  were  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank's \n(ADB's)  Small  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (STWSSSP-I)  and  the \nremaining three by a grant from the Government of Japan.  \n\n6. \nIn  the  project  preparatory  work,  the  15-year  plan  has  been  updated  and  small  towns \nhave  been  redefined  within  the  framework  of  the  National  Urban  Policy  (2007)  as  follows:  (i) \npopulation of 5,000\u201340,000; (ii) located on a road linked to the strategic road network; and (iii) \nhaving  at  least  one  secondary  school  and  a  health  post  in  addition  to  grid  electricity,  basic \ntelecommunications, and banking. Two hundred and sixty five towns (153 in the Terai and 112 \nhill  towns),  with  a  total  population  of  3.6  million,  satisfy  the  criteria.  These  towns  are  being \ndeveloped haphazardly, although they are playing an important role in creating economic links \nbetween the rural areas and the country's urban economy. According to the original plan, only \n45% of the population in small towns had access to piped water (irrespective of water quality) \nand  the  current  coverage  is  likely  to  be  similar.  Although  there  is  serious  and  urgent  need, \nsupport  to  improve  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  in  small  towns,  both  from  the \nGovernment and from development partners, has been severely limited.  \n \nC. \n\nPolicy and Legal Environment  \n\nDevelopment  of  the  legislative  framework  for  Nepal\u2019s  water  and  sanitation  sector  is  a \n7. \nrelatively recent phenomenon taking place primarily over the last 10 years to 2009. The policy \nand  legal  framework  has  developed  incrementally  with  separate  policies  and  regulations \nadopted and enacted for water resources, national sanitation, rural water supply and sanitation, \nwater  quality,  and  urban  development.  Major  acts  and  regulations  relevant  to  the  Project  are \nshown in Table A2.1.  \n\nTable A2.1: Water Sector Legislation, Policy, and Plan \n\nAct or Regulation \n\nWater Resources Act \n1992  \n\nAreas Addressed \n\n\u2022  The umbrella act governing water resource management. \n\n\u2022  Declares the order of priority of water use. \n\n\u2022  Vests ownership of water in the state. \n\n\u2022  Provides  for  the  formation  of  water  user  associations  and  establishes  a  system  of \n\nlicensing. \n\n\u2022  Prohibits water pollution. \n\n\u2022  Allows ownership of completed projects to be transferred to users associations. \n\nNational Water Supply \nSector Policy 1998 \n\n\u2022  Makes  clear  the  objective  of  providing  safe,  convenient,  and  adequate  water  supply  to \n\nall, with sanitation as its integral component. \n\n\u2022  Decreases  direct  involvement  of  the  Government  in  implementation  and  strengthens \n\ninstitutions for decentralized service delivery. \n\n\u2022  Sets  the  target  of  expanding  the  national  coverage  of  water  supply  to  all  by  2002  (but \n\nDrinking Water \nRegulation 1998  \n\nthe target was not achieved). \n\n\u2022  Regulates the use of drinking water. \n\nprocedure for registration. \n\n\u2022  Deals with licensing of use drinking water. \n\n\u2022  Provides  for  the  formation  of  drinking  water  user  associations  and  sets  out  the \n\n\u2022  Deals  with  the  control  of  water  pollution  and  maintenance  of  quality  standards  for \n\ndrinking water. \n\n\u2022  Sets out the conditions of service utilization by consumers. \n\n\u2022  Provides for the acquisition of house and land and compensation. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nAct or Regulation \n\nLocal Self Governance \nAct 1999  \n\n\u2022  Provides for formation of service fee fixation committee. \n\n\u2022  Establishes a decentralized governance structure. \n\nAreas Addressed \n\n\u2022  Sets  out  the  powers,  functions,  and  duties  of  the  VDCs,  municipalities,  and  DDCs  in \n\n\u2022  Sets out which natural resources are assets of local bodies and empowers local bodies \n\nrelation to water and sanitation. \n\nto levy a natural resource tax. \n\n\u2022  Allows local bodies to transfer assets to consumer groups. \n\nLocal Self Governance \nRegulation 1999  \n\nto water and sanitation. \n\n\u2022  Sets out the powers, functions, and duties of VDCs, municipalities, and DDCs in relation \n\n\u2022  Establishes  the  procedure  for  the  formulation  of  water-related  plan  and  project \n\nNational Drinking \nWater Quality \nStandards 2005  \n\nWater Supply \nManagement Board \nAct 2006 \n\nWater Supply Tariff \nFixation Commission \nAct 2006  \n\nimplementation \n\n\u2022  Sets standards for water quality. \n\n\u2022  Service providers responsible for monitoring. \n\n\u2022  Local offices of the Ministry of Health and Population responsible for surveillance.  \n\n\u2022  Guidelines specify methods and frequency of sampling and testing. \n\n\u2022  Establishes WSMBs to manage services in municipal areas. \n\n\u2022  Authorizes  WSMBs  to  issue  licenses  and  enter  into  agreements  with  service  providers \n\nto collect tariffs.  \n\n\u2022  Constitutes Kathmandu WSMB. \n\n\u2022  Establishes the commission. \n\n\u2022  Provides for appointments to the commission. \n\n\u2022  Authorizes the commission to fix tariffs to be charged by service providers. \n\n\u2022  Authorizes  the  commission  to  monitor  service  providers  to  ensure  compliance  with \n\nstandards. \n\nNational Water Plan \n2005 (2002\u20132027) \n\n\u2022  Sets national coverage and service level targets for water and sanitation for all by 2017. \n\nAims to provide universal basic service first then focus on upgrading.  \n\n\u2022  Describes  need  for  clearly  defined  roles  and  responsibilities,  improved  coordination, \nincreased  resources,  improved  cost  recovery  in  urban  schemes,  improved  monitoring, \nand effective regulation.  \n\nDDC = district development committee, VDC = village development committee, WSMB = water supply management \nboard. \nSource: Asian Development Bank assessment. \n \n8. \nSome  inconsistencies  are  observed  among  the  acts  and  regulations,  and  translating \npolicies and plans into actions in the context of decentralization and community empowerment \nis a key challenge.  \n\n9. \nThe  National  Water  Supply  Sector  Policy  1998  did  not  adequately  specify  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  central  government  agencies  and  local  governments  and  issues  of  cost \nsharing  and  recovery.  The  policy  was  never  updated,  while  the  Rural  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation  Sector  Policy  was  adopted  in  2004,  with  specific  provisions  for  community \ncontribution  and  responsibilities  for  operation  and  maintenance.  Under  such  context,  the \nMinistry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW)  has  finalized  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation  Sector  Policy,  which  has  been  assisted  by  ADB's  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance.  As  a  next  step,  an  action  plan  will  need  to  be  developed  to  facilitate  the \nimplementation of the policy. The Government intends to develop an umbrella water supply and \nsanitation act by consolidating existing acts and regulations.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nD. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n29\n\n10. \nIn  the  1990s,  political  liberalization  and  a  focus  on  decentralization  saw  important  new \nparticipants emerge in the sector, in particular community groups and local governments. New \nworking  methods,  including  a  demand-led,  community-based  participatory  approach,  were \nintroduced  and  communities,  particularly  in  rural  schemes,  were  encouraged  to  take  full \nownership and contribute to the capital costs. \n\nThe  MPPW  has  overall  responsibility  for  water  supply  and  sanitation,  within  which  the \n11. \nDepartment of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) is designated as the lead agency for the \ndrinking water and sanitation sector. The DWSS operates through 10 technical divisions based \nin Kathmandu and offices in the five development regions, and has regional and divisional (or \nsubdivisional) offices in all 75 districts of the country.3 As the lead agency, the functions of the \nDWSS include sector planning and coordination, developing technical standards, and managing \ndesign and construction activities for both the urban and rural parts of the sector. The role of the \nDWSS  has  been  shifting  from  an  implementing  agency  to  a  facilitator  and  coordinator  in  line \nwith  decentralization.  The  DWSS  has  strengthened  its  institutional  capacity  with  substantial \nexperiences  gained  through  past  ADB-assisted  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects,  such  as \nthe Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project and the STWSSSP-I. \n\n12. \nThe  Ministry  of  Local  Development  (MLD)  is  the  lead  government  body  for  promoting \nlocal development and decentralization. The ministry achieves this through supporting capacity \nbuilding  in  local  bodies,  i.e.,  district  development  committees,  municipalities,  and  village \ndevelopment  committees  (VDCs).  Under  the  MLD,  the  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Agriculture Roads is responsible for small-village schemes through the district \ntechnical offices and VDCs.  \n\nThe main role defined for district development committees, municipalities, and VDCs in \n13. \npromoting the development of water and sanitation facilities is developing local plans, programs, \nand projects, and also providing the materials and financial support to match the projects\u2019 cost \nand technical support. In many cases, actual service provision has been left to water users and \nsanitation  committees  (WUSCs)  in  accordance  with  the  Local  Self  Governance  Act  and  the \nWater  Resources  Act.  WUSCs,  as  elected  representatives  of  the  water  users  association \nmembers,  work  as  investors  of  infrastructure  as  well  as  operators  of  the  completed \ninfrastructure, under the supervision of municipalities or VDCs. The water supply and sanitation \ndivisional and subdivisional offices of the DWSS provide technical support to local governments \nand WUSCs in the development and operation of facilities. \n\n14. \nThe  Water  Supply  Tariff  Fixation  Commission  was  established  in  2007  and  is \nresponsible  not  only  for  fixing  water  tariffs  but  also  for  ensuring  quality  standards  in  service \ndelivery  in  relation  to  the  level  of  tariff.

Data  for  assessing  applications  and  prioritizing  projects  to  be  considered  for  funding \nshould be gathered during a prefeasibility study. These studies should be carried out strictly in \naccordance  with  the  procedures  in  the  implementation  guidelines,  so  that  applications  can  be \ncompared fairly, based on standard data sets.  \n\n2. \n\nScoring for Town Selection. Scores will be given in the following manner to select towns: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nIf a town does not fit the definition of a small town,1 it is automatically excluded.  \nThe  district  development  committee,  with  an  endorsement  from  the  village \ndevelopment  committee  (VDC)  or  municipality  where  the  subproject  is  located, \nhas  included  or  agreed  to  include  the  subproject  in  the  district  plan  and  has \nsubmitted a formal subproject application to the Department of Water Supply and \nSewerage (DWSS). \nPoverty is weighted so that towns with a higher proportion of poor people score \nmore.  The  lowest  band  is set  at  the  poverty  line  (i.e.,  people  below  the  poverty \nline).2  \nIf a town does not have a piped system, it should be awarded maximum points. If \nit has a piped system, the scoring is according to the proportion of the population \nnot served by it. \nAs  a  measure  of  hardship,  intermittent  systems  providing  less  than  10  hours \nservice  per  day  are  scored  inversely  by  the  number  of  hours.  Waiting  time  for \nwater would be too complex to assess over a whole town. \nQuality  is  scored  according  to  whether  or  not  the  water  meets  the  National \nDrinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS). \nSanitation  is  scored  proportionate  to  the  number  of  households  not  having \nsanitary latrines. \nAdditional points are given if the town does not have any system of wastewater \ndrainage.  If  the  town  has  wastewater  drainage  but  the  effluent  is  discharged \nwithout treatment, it scores fewer points. \nCommunity demand is assessed by the interest shown by people by participating \nin  a  public  meeting  at  the  prefeasibility  stage.  It  assumes  that  the  publicity \nprocess during the prefeasibility study to inform people about the potential project \nhas been carried out in accordance with the implementation guidelines. \nProject readiness and population growth are measured. Towns that have already \nmade  necessary  land  available  and  collected  upfront  cash  contributions  will  be \ngiven  additional  points.  Towns  with  high  population  growth  rates  will  also  be \nawarded additional points.  \nFair  and  equitable  consideration  will  be  given  to  geographical  and  regional \nbalances. In any event, and unless otherwise agreed by ADB, 2\u20136 towns will be \nselected  from  each  region,  and  not  more  than  two-thirds  of  subprojects  will  be \nlocated either in the Terai or hills. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   A small town is defined as (i) population of 5,000\u201340,000; (ii) located on a road linked to the strategic road network; \nand  (iii)  having  at  least  one  secondary  school  and  a  health  post  in  addition  to  grid  electricity,  basic \ntelecommunications, and banking. \n\n2  Nepal  Living  Standards  Survey  in  FY2004  set  the  average  national  poverty  line  as  NRs7,696  per  year.    With  a \nhousehold  size  of  five  people,  this  gives  a  household  income  level  of  NRs3,200  per  month,  rounded  down  to \nNRs3,000.  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTable A4.1: Priority Scoring \n\nCriterion/Indicator \n\nMeets definition of small town: \nDDC, VDC/Municipality approval \nPoverty: \nMatrix  scoring  based  on  percent  in  income  brackets \nshown in Table A4.2 below \nWater Supply \nPiped system \n\n \n\n \n\nDetails \nYes/No \nYes/No \n \n \n\nPoints  \nInclude/exclude \nInclude/exclude \n \n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n% of population not served by piped system \n\n \n25 \n10x %/100 \n10x %/100 \n \n5 \n5 \n4 \n3 \n2 \n1 \n0 \n5 \n \n20x %/100 \n7 \n3 \n \n10x no./HH \n \n5 \n10 \n7 \n\n \nNo \n \n \n \n \n0\u20132 hours \n2\u20134 hours \n4\u20136 hours \n6\u20138 hours \n8\u201310 hours \n> 10 hours \nNo \n \n \nNo \n \n \n \n \nYes \n25% and above \n15%\u201325% \n\n% of poor areas not served by piped system \nExisting water supply \nQuantity < 45 liters per capita per day \nNumber of hours supply per day \n \n \n \n \n \nQuality to National Standard \nSanitation \n% of population without sanitary latrines \nWastewater drainage \nWastewater drainage but without treatment \nCommunity Interest \nProportion of people at meeting out of total households \nProject Readinessa \nLand availability (for treatment plants etc.) \nCollection of upfront cash \n(%  as  against  the  required  minimum  5%  contribution  of \nsubproject cost) \n \n \n \nUrbanization and Growth Potential \nPopulation growth in the last decade  \n(% per annum) \n \nTotal Score \na  For  selection  of  batch  2  towns,  since  the  same  indicators  are  not  available  or  appropriate  without \nfeasibility  studies,  indicators  will  be  modified  to  be  percentage  of  population  willing  to  pay  a  certain \nlevel of monthly tariff, with a proposed maximum score of 10 points. \n\n5%\u201315% \n1%\u20135% \nLess than 1% \n \n5% and above \n3\u20135% \nLess than 3% \n \n\n5 \n3 \n0 \n \n5 \n3 \n1 \n\n \n\nSource: Department of Water Supply and Sewerage assessment. \n\nTable A4.2: Poverty Scoring Matrix \n% of population \n\nPoints \n\nIncome band \n(per month) \n\n   Score \n    % population x Points \n>  NRs7,000 \n \n    NRs5,000 \u2013 7,000 \n \n    NRs3,000 \u2013 5,000 \n \n<  NRs3,000 \n \n \n \nSource: Department of Water Supply and Sewerage assessment. \n\n0 \n8 \n16 \n20 \nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\n3. \nFor  batch  1,  towns  that  have  already  completed  at  least  the  feasibility  studies  will  be \nconsidered.

When the town selection has been made for each batch, the \nproject  management  office  (PMO)  will  send  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence  (i)  a  narrative \nsummary of town selection together with the score of towns considered, (ii) a location map, and \n(iii) salient features of each subproject.  \n\nSubproject Selection \n\nB. \n \n4.  General  Criteria.  Before  the  subproject  is  implemented,  the  PMO  will  ensure  that  the \nspecific criteria, including the following, have been satisfied: \n\nThe subproject has been identified and designed in a participatory manner during \nthe prefeasibility, feasibility, and detailed design stages. \nThe  design  of  the  subproject  ensures  the  least-cost  of  capital  and  of  operation \nand maintenance (O&M) expenditures in achieving its objectives. \nThe  subproject  complies  with  all  requirements  of  relevant  national  laws  and \nregulations  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB's)  policies,  including, \namong  others,  the  Government's  Environmental  Protection  Rules  (1997)  and \ntheir  amendment  in  2007,  and  ADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002),  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \nThe  subproject  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedures  and  the  resettlement  framework  for  the \nProject.  Subprojects  that  will  cause  significant3 resettlement  impacts  will  not  be \nselected.  \nThe  design  of  the  facilities  has  been  made  in  accordance  with  the  relevant \nGovernment guidelines and standards. \nA  general  agreement  among  local  governments,  water  users  and  sanitation \ncommittees  (WUSCs),  PMO,  and  Town  Development  Fund  (TDF)  specifying, \namong  other  things,  the  proportion  of  cost  sharing  for  both  water  supply  and \nsanitation  systems,  and  the  principle  of  integrated  water  supply  and  sanitation, \ntariff  collection,  and  output-based  aid  (OBA),  has  been  signed  before  the \ncommencement of detailed design work.4 \nBefore the contract award, an agreement among the same four parties has been \nsigned specifying, among other things, (a) the amount of contribution from each \nparty;  (b)  the  proposed  level  of  tariff  to  be  collected  by  WUSCs;  (c)  WUSC's \ncommitment \nrepayment,  O&M  expenditures, \nreplacement,  and  future  expansion  in  accordance  with  the  Urban  Water  Supply \nand Sanitation Sector Policy (UWSSSP); and (d) the target and level of grant to \nbe given under the OBA. \n\nrecover  payment  and \n\nto \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n5.  Water Supply. The specific criteria include the following:  \n\nThe  WUSC  has  agreed  with  the  design  of  the  subproject,  initial  community \ncontribution  of  5%\u201315%  of  the  capital  cost  (including  5%  upfront  cash \ncontribution),  the  collection  of  tariff  at  a  level  to  cover  necessary  repayment  of \nthe  TDF,  all  O&M  expenditures, \nto \nprincipal  and  payment  of \nreplacement,  and  future  expansion  in  accordance  with  the  UWSSSP,  and  the \nresponsibility for O&M of the scheme. An ability-to-pay survey has confirmed that \nthe tariff is affordable for most users.  \n\ninterests \n\n                                                 \n3  Involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  considered  significant  when  200  or  more  people  experience  major  impacts. \n\"Major impacts\" is defined as involving affected people (i) being physically displaced from housing; and/or (ii) having \n10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets lost. \n\n4  This will mean the commencement of detailed design review for towns where the detailed design is already available. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n6. \n\n7. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nThe subproject has an economic internal rate of return of 12% or higher.  \nWhen the required quantity of raw water needs to be supplied from surface water \nsources, necessary agreement and approval have been obtained in accordance \nwith relevant laws and regulations of the country.  \n\nSanitation,  including  Solid-Waste  Management.  The  specific  criteria  include  the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i) \n\nThe WUSC has agreed with the design of the subproject, and the responsibility \nfor O&M of the scheme.  \nThe  design  of  the  facilities  suits  the  requirements  of  women,  children,  and  the \ndisabled.  \nThe  WUSC  and  the  VDCs  or  municipalities  where  the  proposed  system  serves \nhave agreed to jointly contribute 15% of the capital cost5 and cover 100% of the \nO&M cost. Details of the arrangement will be included in para 4 (vi)\u2013(vii) above.  \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n \nBefore  the  subproject  implementation,  the  PMO  will  submit  to  ADB  for  review  and \nconcurrence  (i)  a  summary  sheet  showing  that  the  criteria  have  been  met;  (ii)  salient \nfeatures  of  each  subproject;  (iii)  subproject  resettlement  plans  if  any  subproject  involves \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and/or  land  acquisition;  (iv)  other  safeguard  documents,  if \nrequested by ADB; and (v) feasibility studies and/or detailed design reports, if requested \nby ADB.  \n\n                                                 \n5  WUSCs may make contributions either in cash or in kind.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\nFRAMEWORK OF OUTPUT-BASED AID  \n \n\n1. \nOutput-based  aid  (OBA)  is  a  method  for  using  explicit  performance-based  grants  to \nsupport delivery of basic services where policy concerns justify public funding to complement or \nreplace  user  charges.  The  Project  proposes  a  strategy  for  using  OBA  to  deliver  water  supply \nand  sanitation  services  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  in  Project  towns.  Under  the  OBA, \ngrants will be given to service providers, i.e., water users and sanitation committees (WUSCs), \nafter  achievement  of  specific  outputs  have  been  duly  verified.  The  specific  outputs  are  piped \nhousehold  connections  for  water  supply  and  construction  of  private  latrines  for  sanitation. \nGrants will be provided only to poor households for water supply services, and to both poor and \nnon-poor (though at different levels) for sanitation services.  \n \nB. \n\nUnit Costs of Water Supply House Connection and In-house Latrine \n\n2. \nThe  cost  of  providing  house  connection  to  a  household  depends  upon  the  distance  of \nthe  household  from  the  pipe  network.  The  estimated  costs  for  various  distances  are  given  in \nTable A5.1. \n \n\nTable A5.1: Estimated Unit Cost for Water Supply House Connection \n\nDistance (meters) of the User Household from Pipeline \n\nParticulars \n\nPipe (NRs per meter) \nCost for pipe (NRs) \nAccessories (30% of pipe) (NRs) \n\n10 \n140 \n1,400 \n800 \n\n25\n140 \n3,500 \n800 \n\n50 \n140 \n7,000 \n800 \n\n75 \n140 \n10,500 \n800 \n\n1,200 \n5,500 \n40 \n\n1,200 \n3,400 \n10 \n\n1,200 \n9,000 \n35 \n7,565 (say 8,000 including miscellaneous costs) \n\nWater meter (NRs) \nTotal (NRs) \nEstimated proportion of poor households (%)  \nWeighted average cost (NRs) \nNote: Labor cost not included assuming household will provide own labor. \nSource: ADB estimates based on the hearing from the DWSS. \n \n3. \nAs can be seen from Table A5.1, the cost of individual house connection varies greatly \ndepending on the distance from the pipeline. Accordingly, it is considered appropriate to provide \ngrants based on the actual cost of house connection. \n \n4. \ncost of constructing a latrine is given in Table A5.2.  \n \n\nThe  cost  of  constructing  latrines  in  a  household  is  likely  to  be  uniform.

A  fixed  unit  grant  amount1 multiplied  by  the  number  of  households  without  access  to \nsanitation services will be provided. Distribution of grant among beneficiaries will be determined \nby each town. As construction of a latrine by a household is essentially an individual choice, it is \ndesirable  that  construction  be  done  by  individual  householders  as  per  his  or  her  choice. \nHowever,  the  Project  and  the  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  will  give  all  information  and \nwill support the household in making an informed decision regarding the type of model, cost of \nmodel, sourcing the material, etc.  \n \n7. \nGrants  to  poor  households  for  water  supply  house  connections  will  be  provided  at  the \nrate of 50% of actual cost, or NRs6,500, whichever is less. In any project town, the maximum \nproportion of households eligible for grants is equivalent to the district-level poverty ratio in the \nbase year (current year). For example, if a district has a poverty ratio of 30%, then a grant in a \nproject town in such a district will be limited to 30% of total households.  \n \n8. \nIn order to ensure the quality of house connection, minimize leakages at the connection \npoint,  and  reduce  occurrences  of  frequent  road  cuts,  it  is  desirable  that  house  connection  for \nwater  supply  be  executed  by  the  main  civil  works  contractor.  Grants  under  the  OBA  will  be \nadmissible  only  if  connections  are  made  by  the  main  civil  works  contractor  during  the \nconstruction period and the first 6 months of the operation and maintenance (O&M) period.  \n \n9. \nbeen verified, as prescribed. \n \nD. \n\nPayment  of  the  grant  amount  will  be  made  to  the  WUSC  after  house  connection  has \n\nTarget Group and Expected Utilization \n\n10.  Water  Supply. In the proposed towns, there are approximately 55,000 households, out \nof which about 30%, i.e., 17,000 households, are poor. Assuming a weighted average amount \nof  actual  cost  as  NRs8,000  per  poor  household  for  house  connection  for  water  supply  as \ncalculated in Table A5.1, grant expenditure (50%) for connections to poor households is likely to \nbe NRs68 million (17,000 x NRs4,000). \n \nSanitation.  Assuming  that  25%  of  the  poor  households  and  50%  of  the  general  (non-\n11. \npoor)  households  already  have  latrines,  13,000  (75%  of  17,000)  poor  households  and  19,000 \n(50% of 38,000) non-poor households will need to be supported by the Project. The total grant \nis likely to be NRs38.4 million (32,000 x NRs1,2002).  \n \n12. \nsupply and sanitation from the Project.  \n \nE. \n\nAccordingly, NRs106.4 million ($1.33 million) will be required for grant support for water \n\nEligibility Criteria \n\n13. \n\nPoor households will be identified using a broad framework outlined in Table A5.3. \n\n                                                 \n1  In the draft national guidelines for promoting improved sanitation, the unit grant amount per household is NRs1,000 in \n\nthe Terai, NRs1,200 in the hills, and NRs1,500 in the mountains.    \n\n2  NRs1,200 per household was assumed, in line with the draft national guidelines mentioned in footnote 1. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n37 \n\nTable A5.3: Eligibility Criteria for Identifying Beneficiaries Under Output-Based Aid \n\nFamily members without reliable income and employment-generating opportunities or a wage earner. \n\nEligibility Criteriaa \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Possesses house with separate kitchen, but only one room to stay and without telephone, TV, or refrigerator. \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Possesses few (1\u20132) large productive cattle and buffalo. \n\u2022  Any  member  of  the  household  should  not  be  a  regular  or  retired  government  servant  or  a  regular  or  retired \n\nLand holding less than 0.25 hectares.  \nFood sufficiency up to 6 months of the year. \n\nemployee of any private sector organization, or should not be a public representative.  \n\na At least four out of six criteria, including the last criterion, have to be met.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank assessment. \n \nF. \n\nIdentification of Target Beneficiaries \n\n14. \nIdentification  of  target  beneficiaries  will  be  done  by  local  NGOs  in  collaboration  with \nWUSCs and design and supervision consultants (DSCs), and under the overall superintendence \nof the project management consultant (PMC) and project management office (PMO). It is very \nimportant  to  properly  identify  the  eligible  households  so  that  the  benefits  are  delivered  to  the \ndeserving persons and the grant is not misused. Some indicative (rather than comprehensive) \nparameters for target beneficiaries are given below. The actual parameters to be used and the \nprocess to be followed will depend on the context and prevailing circumstances of a town and \nwill be determined by DSCs, NGOs, and WUSCs, and approved by the PMC and/or PMO well \nbefore the actual process of identification. The process has to be participatory and consultative. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nHousing index. This index uses external housing conditions as a proxy for poverty, \nand  can  be  very  effective  in  conditions  where  there  is  a  consistent  relationship \nbetween poverty and housing conditions. Typical factors to be analyzed will include \nuse of construction materials for walls, roofs, etc.; and space in the house such as \nseparate kitchen, separate rooms for children and parents, etc. This method relies on \nthere being a strong correlation between housing conditions and poverty; there is not \na universal relationship\u2014it is very much defined by the context. Where the housing \nindex is adapted to local conditions, perhaps even including other externally visible, \nnonhousing indicators, there is a greater chance of this index being applicable to a \nwider range of contexts. \nParticipatory  wealth  ranking.  This  tool  uses  a  community's  own  definitions  and \nperceptions  of  poverty,  and  employs  rigorous  cross-checking  methods  to  ensure \nconsistency and accuracy of results. This method relies on detailed knowledge of a \ncommunity of itself, and is unlikely to work in contexts where the community is weak, \nor where there are high levels of conflict or mistrust.  \nPerceptions  of  important  community  leaders.  Sometimes,  important  community \nleaders such as local priests, tailors, school teachers, chairperson of ward, etc., can \ngive useful information about economic status of households. They may be involved \nin the process of identification of target beneficiaries. \nCheck-list  approach. Under this approach, a list of poverty proxies or indicators is \nbuilt on, based on a local understanding of poverty and in consultation with WUSCs. \nScores are then assigned to each indicator, or a poverty-line level determined. The \npoverty  level  of  a  household  can  then  be  calculated  from  their  score,  or  number  of \nqualifying indicators. \n\n \n15. \nIn  general,  all  four  methods  build  on  existing  information,  collect  the  minimum  data \nnecessary for reliable targeting, and follow-up targeting with a motivation process to encourage \nthe  poor  to  benefit  from  the  subproject.  Thus,  these  methods  must  not  be  applied  blindly  but \nadapted  to  local  needs  and  conditions.  A  number  of  choices  need  to  be  made  which  will \ndetermine which tool is used. It has been suggested that all four methods of poverty targeting \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nare  adopted,  the  findings  are  triangulated,  and  the  poor  identified,  integrating  all  findings  in  a \nparticipatory way and through consensus. \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n16. \n \n\n1. \n \n\nThe following process will be followed in the implementation of OBA: \n\nIdentification, Endorsement, and Application \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n2. \n \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  PMO,  PMC,  DSCs,  WUSCs,  and  NGOs  should  be  in  place  and  fully \nfunctional. \nAs required in the terms of reference of NGOs, it is the responsibility of the \nNGO, in collaboration with the WUSC, to carry out the socioeconomic survey \nof all the households in the town.  \nThe NGO, in collaboration with the WUSC, identifies the poor households as \nthe  eligibility  criteria  and  participatory  consultative  process  of \nper \nidentification mentioned in this framework.  \nAfter identification of target beneficiaries, the WUSC, in collaboration with the \nNGO,  should  organize a  meeting  of  water  users  associations  and  the list  of \ntarget beneficiaries should be read out in this meeting, objections invited and \ncorrected,  and  the  final  list  endorsed.  Representatives  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation  divisional  or  subdivisional  offices  (WSSDOs)  and  DSCs  should \nalso attend this meeting.  \nThe NGO should explain the OBA framework to target beneficiaries in the list, \nincluding  the  level  of  grant,  extent  of  coverage,  and  process  of  delivery  of \nwater supply and sanitation services, etc. The details of house water supply \nconnection\u2014including  length  of  pipe,  fixtures,  water  meters,  and  valves\u2014\nmethod  of  construction  by  the  main  contractor,  and  responsibility  of  the \nhousehold for oversight and quality control in this regard should be explained \nto the target beneficiary household.  \nThe details of different types of latrine models, cost of each model, type and \nunit  costs  of  material  required,  level  of  grant,  method  of  payment  of  grant, \netc., should be explained by the NGO and the choice of the model should be \nascertained  and  documented.  The  responsibility  of  construction  by  the \nbeneficiary has to be clearly explained to the household by the NGO and the \nlikely time frame of construction by the household should also be ascertained \nand documented.  \nVoluntary  application  by  the  target  beneficiary  to  the  WUSC  should  be \nobtained by the NGO, verified, compiled, and recommended to the WUSC by \nthe NGO for approval. \n\nWater Supply After Application \n\nA  list  of  eligible  approved  target  beneficiaries  will  be  prepared  by  the  NGO \nand a copy will be made available to the main civil works contractor.  \nThe  actual  work  of  house  connection  is  carried  out  by  the  main  civil  works \ncontractor for house connection.  \nThe contractor should submit a periodic running claim (for example, monthly \nor when a substantial number of connections are made) to the WUSC along \nwith  details  of  work  carried  out  for  the  target  beneficiaries  such  as  name, \naddress, length of pipe used for connection, fixtures and fittings, water meter, \nvalve, etc., user\u2019s contribution, and the amount claimed for each household. \nThe  signature  of  the  user  indicating  satisfactory  completion  of  the  work \nshould be obtained by the contractor. The DSC should certify the claim of the \ncontractor.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n39 \n\n \n3. \n \n\nSanitation After Application \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe WUSC will get the list of beneficiaries verified through the local NGO so \nas  to  ascertain  that  the  house  connections  have  actually  been  made  to  the \nintended  beneficiaries  and  that  the  desired  outputs  have  been  achieved.  At \nthe same time, the 50% user's contribution should be collected by the WUSC \nwith the help of the NGO.  \nThe  WUSC  should  make  full  payment  to  the  contractor  from  the  funds \navailable  from  various  sources  such  as  initial  upfront  connection  fee  and \nactual connection costs recovered from the users.  \nThe  WUSC  will  periodically  get  reimbursement  from  the  WSSDO  based  on \nthe  payments  actually  made  to  the  contractor.  Such  reimbursement  may  be \nused as revolving funds by the WUSC for making payments to the contractor \nfor further connections.  \n\nThe WUSC will provide grants to the household, either in cash or in the form \nof  materials  needed,  together  with  some  guidance  for  procurement  of \nmaterials, if the household chooses to procure materials on its own.  \nThe  actual  work  of  latrine  construction  is  carried  out  by  the  concerned \nhousehold. \nOnce  a  latrine  has  been  constructed  and  made  operational  by  an  individual \nhousehold, such household will send a statement to the WUSC informing it of \nthe  completion  of  the  work.  (The  NGO  will  provide  the  format  for  this \napplication.) \nThe WUSC will ask the NGO to verify that the latrine has been constructed, \nthe  quality  and  workmanship  of  construction,  and  whether  it  is  operational, \nand issue a verification report.  \nThe WUSC will send a request for reimbursement of the grant to the WSSDO \ntogether with a verification report and have it reimbursed.  \n\nH. \n\n \nEvaluation  \n\n17. \nEvaluation  of  OBA  will  be  carried  out  on  a  random  sampling  basis  by  an  independent \nagency appointed by the PMO for this purpose. It may be appropriate to engage the department \nof sociology, anthropology, management, or economics, etc. of any renowned university for this \npurpose.  \n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A6.1: Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n \n\nItem \nA.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe National Living Standard Survey (NLSS II) in FY2004 indicated that incidence of poverty declined sharply\u2014from 41.8% in \nFY1996  to  30.8%  in  FY2004.  This  decline  was  mainly  driven  by  growth  in  both  per  capita  consumption  expenditure  and \nincome  by  an  annual  average  of  4.5%,  supported  by  increased  remittance  inflows,  higher  agricultural  wages,  increased \nconnectivity,  and urbanization. Nepal has also made notable  progress in various  aspects of human  development. The child \n(under 5-years old) mortality rate has declined from 118 per 1,000 live births in 1996 to 61 in 2006, the infant (below 1-year) \nmortality rate has decreased from 79 per 1,000 live births to 52 in the same period, and the maternal mortality rate has been \nnearly  halved  from  539  per  100,000  live  births  in  1995  to  281  in  2006.  Despite  the  notable  progress  in  overall  poverty \nreduction and human development, the NLSS shows a marked increase in income inequality\u2014the Gini coefficient increased \nfrom  34.2%  in  FY1996  to  41.4%  in  FY2004.  The  reduction  in  poverty  has  been  unevenly  distributed.  Inequalities  across \ngeographic  regions  and  ecological  zones  and  between  rural  and  urban  areas  remain  significant,  as  do  inequalities  across \ngender, ethnic, and caste lines.  \n \nIn the context of Nepal, poverty has always been a rural phenomenon. However, the increasing migration of the people from \nrural  villages  to  urban  centers  for  better  livelihoods  has  presented  a  great  challenge  to  the  system  to  fulfill  the  growing \ndemands  being  made  of  the  basic  services.  The  water  and  sanitation  coverage  has  drastically  increased  in  both  rural  and \nurban areas from 1990 onwards. In 2006, 76.6% of the total population had access to basic drinking water services; the figure \nwas  46%  in  1990.  Access  to  sanitation  services  was  available  to  45.8%  of  the  population  in  2006.  Although  there  was \ndecreasing gaps in water and sanitation coverage between rural and urban areas, the increasing population in urban centers \nalso  increased  demands  which  the  current  system  has  not  been  able  to  respond  to.  Small  towns,  emerging  from  rural \ncharacteristics,  lack  basic  infrastructure.  The  poor  settlements  in  these  towns  are  mostly  on  the  periphery  and  generally \ndenied  basic  infrastructure  including  water  and  sanitation  services.  Generally,  the  poor  have  less  access  to  safe  drinking \nwater and sanitation facilities, are not connected to piped systems, and depend upon poor-quality water sources. Women and \nchildren  are  mainly  responsible  for  the  collection  of  water,  and  consequently  women  are  adversely  affected  in  situations \nwhere water is scarce and sanitation is poor, and it increases the burden on them for household and health maintenance.  \n \nThe  water  sector  policy  of  the  Government's  Three-Year  Interim  Plan  (FY2008\u2013FY2010)  aims  to  contribute  to  raising  living \nstandard and the status of public health by making sustainable and equitable water supply and sanitation services available. \nThe country poverty analysis describes the provision of basic services for the poor, including  water-related needs, as being \nfundamental to poverty reduction. The plan includes that the drinking water projects will be made gender friendly and women \nwill be involved institutionally and at all levels. The national Water Plan 2005 has set the target of achieving total population \ncoverage of basic drinking water supply and sanitation services by 2017. Nepal adopted the Millennium Declaration in 2000, \ncommitting to work towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  \n \nThe urban water supply and sanitation sector policy, which has recently been finalized, has as its goal that the policy would be \nto  ensure  the  socioeconomic  development  and  improved  health  status  of  urban  populations,  including  the  poor  and \nmarginalized,  through  the  provision  of  sustainable  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities.  The  Asian  Development  Bank's \n(ADB's)  country  strategy  and  program  for  Nepal  (2005\u20132009)a  emphasizes  the  role  of  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  urban \ndevelopment  infrastructure,  and  the  need  to  target  the  poor  to  reduce  both  poverty  and  inequalities.  Following  these  policy \nframeworks, the Project will contribute to helping achieve the Government's goal to provide sustainable and equitable drinking \nwater supply and sanitation services through applying pro-poor approaches so that the poor in the service area  will equally \nbenefit  from  piped  water  supply  system  and  sanitation.  The  Project  will  ensure  inclusion  of  the  poor,  women,  and  the \ndisadvantaged  caste  and  ethnic  groups  by  implementing  the  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  (GESI)  action  plan.  Time \nand  economic  savings  gained  from  a  sustainable  water  supply  system  will  contribute  to  economic  returns  and  improved \nlivelihoods.  It  can  be  expected  that  reduced  time  for  fetching  water  will  contribute  into  increased  school  attendance  and \nenrolment of children and increased investment of time for women in productive economic activities. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (MDG-TI) \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe  critical  issue  related  to  poverty  reduction  that  requires  particular  attention  in  Nepal  is  its  unequal  benefits  to  different \ncaste,  ethnic  groups,  and  those  from  different  geographical  regions.  The  exclusionary  practices  embedded  through  strong \nfeudalistic rules and attitudes in the society have historically and systematically excluded women, dalitsb, indigenous people \n(janajatis),  madhesis,c Muslims, religious  minorities, and other vulnerable  groups from politics, governance, and  institutions. \nThe reduction in national poverty between FY1996 and FY2004 led to poverty reduction of 46 percentage points for the upper \ncaste  Brahmin/Chhetri  group.  However,  poverty  declined  by  only  21  percentage  points  among  the  lower-caste  dalits,  10 \npercentage  points  among  the  hill  janajatis,  and  6  percentage  points  among  the  Muslims.  The  NLSS  II  data  shows  that  the \npoverty  incidences  of  historically  marginalized  and  socially  excluded  groups\u2014dalits,  janajatis,  and  Muslims,  who  altogether \nconstitute  more  than  50%  of  the  total  population\u2014are  higher  than  that  of  Brahmins,  Chhetris,  and  Newars,  and  above  the \nnational  average.  The  incidence  of  poverty  is  19%  among  the  Brahmins/Chhetris  and  14%  among  Newars,  compared  with \n46% among dalits, 44% among hill janajatis, and 41% among Muslims. The higher poverty incidences are correlated with the \nlower status of the particular caste and ethnic groups in the social hierarchy.  \n \nIn addition to gender identity, the caste and ethnic identities have historically greatly influenced people's access to services, \nbenefits, and participation in development programs. Social exclusion due to gender, caste, and ethnic identity is very much \nrecognized  in  the  country's  current  political  and  development  discourses.  Those  who  were  left  out  of  the  mainstream \ndevelopment and overall governance and political representation are mostly from the vulnerable communities. Their inclusion \nin  overall  development  and  political  representation  is  crucial  in  the  post-conflict  and  peace  building  processes.  In  changed \npolitical  circumstances,  the  rising  voices  and  calls  of  dalits,  indigenous  people,  madhesis,  women,  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups  for  integration  of  their  issues  into  a  new  constitution  and  new  structural  changes  in  Nepal  clearly  demand  higher \nattention from all concerned. The social inclusion and appropriate representation of these groups is highly recommended in all \nsectors  of  development  interventions.  The  benefits  of  the  development  interventions  need  to  be  diverted  with  conscious \nefforts towards these excluded groups.  \n \nGender-based roles and discrimination are relevant to the water supply system. In Nepal generally, women and children are \nresponsible  for  fetching  water.  This  role  increases  the  burden  on  women  when  there  is  scarcity  of  water.  Time  savings  in \nthree completed STWSSSP-I projects were reported to range from 30 minutes to 90 minutes per household. A shorter time to \ncollect water normally results in increased consumption of water, which results in improved hygiene (more frequent personal \nbathing and washing of clothes and utensils) and better livestock maintenance. Health benefits cited by beneficiaries normally \ninclude  improved  quality  of  life  due  to  better  physical  health,  reduced  mental  stress  (as  a  result  of  less  drudgery),  and  an \nimproved  household  economy.  Improving  the  quality  of  life  by  providing  basic  water  and  sanitation  services  will  have  a \nprofound bearing on reducing women's burden and poverty levels.  \n \nBy providing access to improved drinking water supply and sanitation, the Project will assist the Government in achieving the \nMDGs. The Project beneficiaries are town dwellers who have received no or limited piped water supply system and have no \naccess  to  improved  sanitation.  By  addressing  the  issues  of  gender,  caste,  and  ethnic-based  discrimination,  the  Project  will \nadopt the policy of social inclusion for the excluded and vulnerable while targeting the beneficiary community. These groups \nwill  be  identified  through  household  surveys,  and  their  socioeconomic  situation  will  be  studied  to  include  them  within  the \nProject activities and to provide them with water and sanitation facilities.  \n \n2. Design Features  \nThe Project  will implement a  strategy for using explicit performance-based grants (output-based aid [OBA]) to deliver  water \nsupply  and  sanitation  services  primarily  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  Under  the  OBA,  grants  will  be  paid  to  service \nproviders,  i.e.,  the  water  users  and  sanitation  committees  (WUSCs),  after  delivery  of  the  household  connections  has  been \nverified.  Grants  will  be  provided  to  carefully  targeted  poor  households  for  water  supply  services,  and  at  different  levels \nbetween the poor and the non-poor for sanitation services.   \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nUnder the Project, low-income families are identified on the basis of annual income. The national poverty line for Nepal based \non  consumption  is  NRs7,696  per  household  per  year  (2003).  This  translates  to  NRs3,000\u2013NRs4,000  per  household  per \nmonth, depending on the region. The population below the poverty line for urban areas is 13%, and between 24% and 45% in \nthe various regions in which emerging small towns are located. Central Bureau of Statistics poverty estimates for the Ilakas \n(areas  that  cover  clusters  of  village  development  committees  (VDCs)  and  municipalities)  in  which  the  three  project \npreparatory technical assistance towns are located are 59% for Sukhad, 19% for Duhabi, and 50% for Khandbari municipality. \n\u201cBetter-off\u201d incomes are taken to be those greater than NRs12,844 ($165). Poverty incidence is higher among dalits, highly \nmarginalized  ethnic  minorities  (24  groups  classified  highly  marginalized  by  the  National  Foundation  for  Development  of \nIndigenous People, Ministry of Local Development), and religious minorities (Muslims).  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\nStakeholder analysis for the three project preparatory technical assistance towns found that 10%\u201376% live in urban areas and \n24%\u201390% in the more rural peripheral areas. The wealthy and middle class comprise between 5% and 20%. Dominant caste \ngroups  like  Brahmins,  Chhetris,  and  Newars,  and  traders  from  the  Terai  middle  castes,  account  for  40%\u201350%  of  the \npopulation.  On  average,  between  60%  and  70%  of  the  population  is  in  some  way  disadvantaged  or  vulnerable.  Ethnic \nminorities  account  for  30%\u201345%,  Muslims  0%\u201313%,  and  dalits  7%\u201311%.  Ethnic  minorities  can  be  divided  among  (i)  highly \nmarginalized  ethnic  minorities,  such  as  Majhi,  Tharu  ex-Kamaiya,  and  Dhimal  (0%\u2013  2%);  (ii)  marginalized  groups  such  as \nTharu  and  Tamang  (10%\u201340%);  and  (iii)  disadvantaged  ethnic  minorities  such  as  the  Rai  and  Magar  (2%\u201334%).  Other \ndisadvantaged  categories  are  the  poor  (19%\u201359%  of  whom  are  below  the  poverty  line),  landless  (3%\u201320%),  households \nheaded  by  women  (14%\u201322%),  and  outlying  relatively  remote  villages  that  are  underserved  (10%\u201330%).  The  number  of \nProject-affected people is very low, with only a few households in Duhabi and Khandbari in this category.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nAt  the  central  level,  workshops  were  held  by  inviting  key  stakeholders  (government  departments,  NGOs,  development \npartners, etc.) to discuss the Project design and the draft urban water supply and sanitation sector policy during the project \npreparatory  technical  assistance.  A  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  strategy  has  been  drafted  to  ensure  effective \nparticipation of stakeholders in the Project. In each of the three sample subproject towns, group discussions and workshops \nwere  organized  to  solicit  views  from  potential  beneficiaries  of  the  Project,  including  vulnerable  groups  such  as  dalits  and \nindigenous people. Strong support for the Project has been confirmed at these workshops, and suggestions and comments \nmade have been reflected in the design of subprojects.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nA C&P plan was not prepared because the gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) implementation plan to be developed \nand implemented in each town by a local NGO will ensure sufficient consultation and participation of beneficiaries, including \nwomen, the poor, and vulnerable groups.  \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. Gender issues focus on women's subordinated role in households. Their responsibility to manage water for \ndrinking, cooking, and cleaning make them the primary users and managers of water. Hence, women are at the core of the \nProject and its success as they are the main participants and users of water supply facilities. Gender-sensitive processes are \nimportant  to  all  community  mobilization  and  scheme  implementation  plans.  Gender  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  GESI \nframework  and  all  components  of  the  Project.  To  have  gender  as  integral  to  project  success,  the  institutional  capacity  and \nstructures  are  prerequisite  in  government  agencies,  the  Department  of  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  (DWSS),  the  regional \nmonitoring  and  supervision  offices,  and  the  WSSDOs.  Similarly,  WUSCs  need  to  be  gender  balanced  and  their  operations \nneed  to  be  gender  responsive.  Women  from  vulnerable  groups\u2014dalits,  marginalized  indigenous  groups,  and  poorest \nhouseholds\u2014need extra attention to ensure their participation in WUSCs and sanitation activities. \n \nBenefits accruing to women will be: \n\n(cid:131)  significant time and energy savings through provision of water points at house; \n(cid:131)  participation in decision making on the location and design of water points and latrines so as to meet the full practical \n\nneeds of women; \n\n(cid:131)  priority for paid positions such as health motivators, sanitation masons, and maintenance caretakers; \n(cid:131)  33% representation on WUSCs;  \n(cid:131)  improved community awareness on GESI through training of WUSC members; \n(cid:131)  participation of men as well as women in hygiene promotion sessions; recruitment of male as well as female hygiene \n\npromoters. \n\n \nGender plan prepared? Yes (as Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan) \n\n2.  Key  Actions.

Special \ncompensation measures \nfor vulnerable groups, \nincluding indigenous \npeople, are also included \nin the resettlement \nframework. \nIndigenous people will \nlikely be found in most \nsubprojects. With water \nsupply and sanitation \nservices improvement, \nsubprojects are expected \nto result in improved health \nand time savings for water \ncollection for indigenous \npeople. Considering the \nnature and scale of these \nsubprojects, impacts are \nconsidered minor, and \nspecific actions favorable \nto indigenous people will \nbe a part of the integrated \nGESI action plan.  \nThe Project will create \nshort-term employment \nopportunities in \ninfrastructure construction \nand maintenance for poor \nunskilled and skilled \nlaborers. It will benefit both \nwomen and men. \nTariff  will  be  within  3%  of \nthe  monthly  income  even \nfor the poor households.

As  part  of  the  feasibility  study,  three  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs) \nwere prepared for sample subprojects in Duhabi, Sukhad, and Khandbari. IEE reports conclude \nthat the planned subprojects would have only small-scale, localized impacts on the environment \nand these can be mitigated. Mitigation measures and monitoring plans have been proposed in \nthe  IEE  and  are  summarized  below.  Improvement  in  sanitation  and  solid-waste  management, \ntogether  with  wastewater  management,  will  substantially  improve  health,  economic,  and \nenvironmental  living  conditions  of  these  areas.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedure (EARP) is also summarized herein.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe three IEEs (Supplementary Appendix J) show that sample subprojects will result in \nlarge net environmental benefits. The Project is designed to improve environmental quality and \nliving  conditions  in  selected  small-town  areas  through  the  provision  of  basic  water  supply  and \nsanitation  services, \nIEEs \nconducted for the Project show that net subproject environmental benefits would be positive and \nlarge,  and  include  (i)  increased  availability  of  adequate  potable  water  at  appropriate  pressure \nfrom water supply subprojects; (ii) better public health, particularly reduction in waterborne and \ninfectious  diseases;  (iii)  reduced  pollution  resulting  from  sewage  treatment  and  solid-waste \nmanagement focused on community-level 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle); and (iv) improved \naesthetics from the improvement of sewage treatment and solid-waste management. \n \n3. \nThere  are  no  adverse  cumulative  impacts  as  potential  negative  subproject  impacts \nduring  construction  and  operation  will  not  be  significant,  and  most  impacts  are  localized  and \ntemporary.  Environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  (Table  A12.2)  further  ensure  that \nsubprojects will not have significant negative environmental impacts. Impacts that are potentially \nsignificant  and  permanent  in  nature  are  identified,  and  environmental  subproject  selection \ncriteria  will  not  allow  subprojects  with  such  impacts.  Potential  negative  impacts  and  mitigation \nmeasures are summarized in Table A12.1 and no further environmental impact assessment is \nrequired.   \n\nincluding  solid-waste  management.

Design Impacts \nImpacts due to downstream \nusers based on extraction of \nwater for project \n\n \n\nMitigation Activities and Method \n\n \nNo  significant  resettlement  impacts  are  envisioned  for  the  Project,  and  any  land \nacquisition  is  small  scale.  Two  subprojects  require  small-scale  land  acquisition  (two \nhouseholds in Duhabi and seven households in Khandbari), and are addressed through \nshort  resettlement  plans  granting  compensation  and  rehabilitation  entitlements  to \naffected people. Resettlement plans are prepared based on the resettlement framework \nagreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Any  subprojects  within  this  sector \nproject  that  are  determined  to  cause  significant  resettlement  impacts  will  not  be \nselected.   \nSubprojects will not result in destruction of or encroachment onto protected areas. Any \nsubprojects  located  near  sensitive  ecosystems  will  minimize  impacts  through  proper \nsiting, design, and construction techniques. \n\nProper siting to avoid flood-prone areas. Project design to include appropriate drainage \nscheme  to  withstand  rainy  season,  as  well  as  include  physical  protection  works  to \nprotect from river flooding.   \n \nConsultation  with  all  downstream  users  will  occur  as  part  of  the  project  to  ensure \nadequate  water  resources  are  available  for  continued  activity  and/or  users  receive \nbenefits from the project through negotiations with WUSCs.   \n \n\nArsenic in groundwater supply  Bore holes and water sampling at appropriate depths to ensure arsenic-free water.  \nImpacts due to flooding \n\n\f \n\nPotential Negative Impacts \nPoor water quality from \ninadequate treatment design \nand technology \nImpacts due to disposal of \nuntreated or partially treated \nsewage from sewage \ntreatment facilities \nImpacts due to sludge \ndisposal from STPs and WTPs \nTree cutting and clearance of \nvegetation \n\nNuisance due to odor, and \ninflux of rodents and insects \nfrom sewage treatment \nfacilities and solid-waste \noperations \nFacility breakdown (i.e., high \npressure filters, chlorinators, \netc.) leading to untreated \nwater  \nHealth and safety risk for \nworkers  \n\nC.

Prepare  O&M  manual  for \nsewage treatment facilities. Monitoring of effluent will be conducted by DWSS.  \n\nDesign proper sludge collection, treatment, and disposal system.  \n\nTree cutting  will be minimized to the extent possible complying  with all tree felling and \nforest clearance requirements of the Government. Utilize trees in the design as buffer. \nPlant  25  trees  for  each  tree  cut  as  a  mitigation  measure  as  per  Government \nrequirement.  \nSewage treatment and solid-waste facilities are to be sited away from inhabited areas. \nDevelop a physical barrier and visual screen in the form of greenbelt around the sites.  \n\nO&M  manuals  to  be  prepared  as  a  reference  tool  to  handle  emergency  situations. \nEnsure  a  service  tool  kit  with  necessary  spare  parts.  Install  standby  generators  to \nensure continuous treatment process operations. \n\nPrepare O&M manuals for water and sewage treatment facilities to include operational \nsafety,  particularly  for  handling  chlorine  and  lime.  Provide/procure  maintenance \nequipment with adequate safety design features for safe cleaning or maintenance works \nof sewers and septic tanks. \n \nIdentify beneficial use of waste soil such as construction.  \n\nContractor  to  use  equipment  that  meets  Government  air  quality  and  emissions \nstandards (2003).

A project management office (PMO) established in the DWSS \nwill  be  responsible  for  overall  environmental  coordination  and  management  of  the  Project. \nTowards  this,  the  PMO  will  be  assisted  by  an  environmental  expert  consultant  responsible  for \nsupporting and overseeing EARPs at the national level. The expert will support the PMO in the \ninitial screening of subprojects to ensure compliance with subproject selection criteria. He or she \nwill review all IEEs and environmental impact assessments (EIAs), and ensure all government \nand ADB procedures are met including, but not limited to, the ADB Environment Policy (2002) \nand  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines,(2003)  and  the  Government's  Environmental \nProtection  Act  (1997)  and  Environmental  Protection  Rules  (1997,  amended  2007).  The  expert \nwill take corrective actions where necessary. He or she will also provide environmental training \nto build capacity within the PMO, regional monitoring and supervision offices, water supply and \nsanitation  divisional  and  subdivisional  offices  (WSSDOs),  and  water  users  and  sanitation \ncommittees (WUSCs), and submit bi-annual environmental progress reports to the MPPW and \nADB.  \n \n5. \nThe WSSDO of the DWSS will be engaged between the PMO, regional monitoring and \nsupervision  offices,  and  WUSCs,  and  will  provide  technical  support  to  the  design  and \nsupervision  consultant  (DSC)  during  IEE  or  EIA  preparation.  The  WSSDO  will  also  work  as  a \ntechnical  backstop  agency  for  WUSCs,  even  after  construction  completion,  to  assist  in  the \nsupervision of environmental monitoring during operation and maintenance (O&M).  \n \n6.   \nAn  environmental  specialist  within  the  DSC  will  prepare  IEEs  and  EIAs  in  parallel  with \nthe  detailed  design,  and  supervise  the  construction  process,  in  accordance  with  government \nand ADB requirements. IEEs will be approved by the MPPW through the DWSS, while EIAs (if \nneeded) will be approved by the Ministry of the Environment. EIA reports of category A and IEE \nreports  of  category  B  subprojects  (if  any)  will  also  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \nconcurrence. The DSC will ensure that all mitigation requirements are integrated into contractor \nbidding documents and that construction works carried out by the contractors strictly follow the \nenvironmental  specifications  detailed  in  environmental  management  plans.  Nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) will assist the WSSDO and WUSC in raising environmental awareness of \nthe  local  residents.  The  WUSC  is  responsible  for  O&M  of  all  facilities  constructed  under  the \nProject and will receive necessary water quality training from the WSSDO. \n \n \n \n7.   \nEnvironmental  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  during  construction  and  operation  of  the \nProject.  The  PMO  and  WSSDO  are  responsible  for  monitoring  the  overall  compliance  with \ngovernment and ADB policies and procedures. The DSC environmental specialist, with support \nfrom  the  WSSDO  and  WUSC,  will  monitor  environmental  mitigation  requirements  during \nconstruction to ensure that mitigation is provided and effective in reducing impacts. The WUSC \nwith  support  from  the  WSSDO  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  and  water  quality \nmonitoring  during  operation.  As  per  government  requirements,  WUSCs  are  to  provide  water \nquality monitoring reports to the district public health office concerned. Under the Project, each \nWUSC  will  receive  water  testing  kits  with  upfront  training  from  the  DSC  and  ongoing  support \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring and Reporting \n\n2. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n57 \n\nfrom  the  WSSDO.  Regional  DWSS  laboratories  will  conduct  regular  water  testing  to  ensure \ncompliance with Nepal National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS). 2 \n \n8. \nThe  environmental  specialist  in  the  DSC  is  to  prepare  and  submit  quarterly \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  implementation  progress  reports  to  the  WSSDO  and  PMO  who \nwill  initiate  necessary  follow-up  actions,  if  any.  The  PMO  will  review  the  environmental \nperformance  of  the  Project  through  these  reports,  and  submit  biannual  environmental \nmonitoring progress reports to the MPPW and ADB.   \n \n \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure  \n\n3. \n\n9. \nStakeholder  consultation  is  an  integral  part  of  the  environmental  assessment  process. \nDuring Project preparation, consultations are to be undertaken by the DSC as an integral part of \nIEE and EIA preparation with various stakeholder groups including government representatives, \nWUSCs, NGOs, and residents of project areas. Consultations for subprojects are to be mainly \nconducted  locally,  employing  various  methods  (e.g.,  socioeconomic  surveys  of  households, \nformal  meetings,  individual  and  structured  discussions,  and focus  group  discussions).  Regular \nand continued stakeholder participation at all stages of project design and implementation is to \noccur.  \n \n10. \nDuring subproject preparation, the DWSS is required to provide public notices regarding \ninformation on the Project\u2019s environmental issues as per the government rules. IEEs and EIAs \nwill also be made available upon request. Moreover, a grievance redress committee, chaired by \nthe WSSDO, shall be set up to register grievances of the people regarding technical, social, and \nenvironmental aspects. The process is designed to be transparent, gender responsive, culturally \nappropriate,  and  commensurate  to  the  risks  and  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project,  as  well  as \nreadily  accessible  to  all  affected  people,  who  are  to  be  appropriately  informed  about  the \nmechanism  through  media  and  public  outlets.  This  participatory  process  shall  ensure  that  all \nviews  of  the  people  are  adequately  reviewed  and  suitably  incorporated  into  the  design  and \nimplementation process. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Selection Criteria for Subprojects \n\n \n11. \nTo  help  ensure  compliance  with  Government  and  ADB  policies,  environmental \nsubproject  selection  criteria  have  been  prepared  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future \nsubprojects. A summary of the environmental subproject selection criteria is provided in Table \nA12.2. \n \nThe full EARP, based on provisions of the Government\u2019s environmental policies and the \n12. \nenvironmental  assessment  requirements  of  ADB,  is  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K. \nThe EARP details (i) the environmental assessment and review procedures, (ii) responsibilities \nand authorities involved in environmental assessment and review, and (iii) staffing requirements \nand budgets. \n \n\nTable A12.2.

The Second \nSmall  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  further  minimizes  impacts  through \ncareful  design  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition,  and  utilizes  public  land  and  existing \nfacilities wherever possible. \n \nShort  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  two  out  of  three  sample  subprojects  in \n2. \nDuhabi  and  Khandbari  (Supplementary  Appendix  L),  where  resettlement  impacts  were \nidentified.1 As  indicated  by  these  sample  subprojects,  the  nature  of  land  acquisition  is  small, \nimpacting  two  households  in  Duhabi  and  seven  households  in  Khandbari.  Impacts  occur \nprimarily to agricultural plots with no structures. The resettlement framework aims to restore the \nlives of any affected person to pre-project levels, with special provisions to improve the status of \nvulnerable  groups.  Any  subprojects  determined  to  cause  significant2 resettlement  impacts  will \nnot  be  considered  for  implementation.  This  summary  captures  the  salient  points  of  the \nresettlement framework.  \n \nB. \n \nThe resettlement framework outlines the objectives, policy principles, and procedures for \n3. \nland acquisition (if required), compensation, and other assistance measures for affected people. \nThe resettlement framework is based on national laws including the Land Acquisition Act 2034 \n(1977)  and  the  Land  Reform  Act  2021  (1964),  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995).  The  three  important  elements  of  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  are  (i) \ncompensation  to  replace  lost  assets,  livelihood,  and  income;  (ii)  assistance  for  relocation, \nincluding provision of relocation sites with appropriate facilities and services; and (iii) assistance \nfor  rehabilitation  to  achieve  at  least  the  same  level  of  well-being  with  the  project  as  without  it. \nThe  entitlement  matrix  (Table  A13.1)  summarizes  the  main  types  of  losses  and  the \ncorresponding nature and scope of entitlements. Where the entitlement matrix does not cover a \nparticular  impact,  it  can  be  enhanced  in  the  resettlement  plans  based  on  the  findings  of  the \nsocial assessment and detailed measurement survey. Standards described will not be lowered \nbut can be enhanced in the subproject resettlement plans as required. \n \n \n\nResettlement Framework Policies and Principles \n\n                                                 \n1  The Duhabi subproject will impact two households (25 affected people) and Khandbari subproject seven households \n(41  affected  people).  For  each  subproject,  land  ownership  and  usage  are  known.  All  affected  people  were  closely \nconsulted in resettlement plan preparation. No resettlement impacts will occur in Sukhad.  \n\n2  Resettlement is significant when 200 or more people experience major impacts defined as involving affected people \nbeing  physically  displaced  from  housing  and/or  having  10%  or  more  of  their  productive,  income-generating  assets \nlost. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fType of \nLoss \nLoss of land \n\nNo. \n1a \n\nApplication \nFull/partial  permanent \nloss  of  homestead, \nagricultural, \nvacant \nland \n\nEntitled \nPerson \nOwner(s)  with \nlegal title \n\n1b \n\nLoss of land \n\nFull/partial  permanent \nloss  of  homestead, \nagricultural, \nvacant \nland \n\nTenant(s), \nleaseholder(s), \ntenant \nfarmer(s) \n\n1c \n\nLoss of land \n\nloss  of \n\nSharecropper \n\nPermanent \nagricultural land \n\nTable A13.1: Entitlement Matrix \n\nto \n\ncompensation  equivalent \n\nEntitlement \nLand-for-land  arrangements,  if  government  land  available, \nof equal productive capacity satisfactory to affected person, \nor  \n \nCash \ncurrent  market \nrate/replacement value.

Local  language \nversions of the summary resettlement framework and resettlement plans will be made available in \nthe  WSSDOs,  VDCs,  district  development  committees,  WUSCs,  and  other  public  locations.  The \nresettlement framework and resettlement plans will be posted on ADB\u2019s website and Government \nwebsite,  and  information  dissemination  and  consultation  will  continue  throughout  program \nimplementation.  Grievances  of  affected  people  will  first  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  WUSCs. \nGrievances not adressed by the WUSC will be brought to the grievance redress committee (GRC) \nestablished in each town. Further grievances will be handled by the Ministry of Home Affairs which \ncan  exercise  legal  authority  through  the  district  court.  Records  will  be  kept  of  all  grievances \nreceived including contact details of complainant, date that the complaint was received, nature of \ngrievance, agreed corrective actions and the date these were effected, and final outcome. \n \nF. \n \nResettlement  plan  implementation  will  be  closely  monitored  to  provide  the  executing \n7. \nagency  with  an  effective  basis  for  assessing  resettlement  progress  and  identifying  potential \ndifficulties and problems. Internal monitoring will be undertaken by the DWSS (PMO and WSSDO) \nand  will  involve  (i)  administrative  monitoring  to  ensure  that  implementation  is  on  schedule  and \nproblems  are  dealt  with  on  a  timely  basis;  (ii)  socioeconomic  monitoring  during  and  after  any \nresettlement  impact  utilizing  baseline  information  from  subproject  preparation;  (iii)  overall \nmonitoring to assess the status of affected people; and (iv) preparation of monthly progress reports \nto be submitted to the PMO, reporting actual achievements against the targets fixed and reasons \nfor  shortfalls,  if  any.  The  selected  local  NGO  will  work  as  an  external  monitoring  agency  to \ndocument  (i)  restoration  of  income  levels;  (ii)  changes  in  occupation  pattern;  (iii)  changes  in \naffected people's type of housing; (iv) assessment of affected people's access to amenities, such \nas  water,  electricity,  and  transportation;  and  (v)  performance  of  WUSCs  in  resettlement \nimplementation. The independent agency (i.e., NGO) will monitor subprojects and submit a report \ndirectly  to  the  WSSDO  and  PMO  upon  completion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The \nexecuting agency will submit the external monitoring report to ADB for review.  \n \nG. \n \n8. \nDetailed  budget  estimates  for  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  prepared  for  each \nresettlement plan by the DSC resettlement specialist and will be included in the overall subproject \ncost  estimate.  The  resettlement  cost  estimate  includes  all  costs  related  to  resettlement \nincluding  compensation,  relocation,  transfer  costs,  displacement  allowances,  rehabilitation \ncosts, administrative costs, special assistance for vulnerable households, and consultation. All \nland acquisition funds will be paid to affected people by the WUSC, and backed by DWSS. Grant \nassurances  will  guarantee  that  affected  people  are  compensated  for  all  losses  as  per  the \nresettlement plan before the award of civil contracts, and NGOs will verify whether compensation \nwas  paid  and  the  satisfaction  of  the  affected  person.  Land  acquisition,  compensation,  relocation, \nand rehabilitation of income and livelihood will be considered as an integral component of project \ncosts. \n\nResettlement Budget \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 21 July 2009) \n \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Nepalese rupee/s (NRe/NRs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "NRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.01295 \nNRs77.22  \n", " \n", " \n", "ADB \nCHRDU \nDSC \nDWSS \nEARP \nEIA \nGESI \nIEE \nISAC \nJICA \nMDG \nMLD \nMOF \nMPPW \nNDWQS \nNGO \nOBA \nO&M \nPMC \nPMO \nPPMS \nSEIU \nSOE \nSTWSSSP \nTDF \nTPCC \nUNDP \nUNICEF \nUWSSSP \nVDC \nWHO \nWSSDO \nWUSC \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \nAsian Development Bank \nCentral Human Resources Development Unit  \ndesign and supervision consultant \nDepartment of Water Supply and Sewerage \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure \nenvironmental impact assessment \ngender equality and social inclusion \ninitial environmental examination \ninterim service area committee \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Millennium Development Goal \n\u2013  Ministry of Local Development \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  Ministry of Physical Planning and Works  \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  World Health Organization \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "National Drinking Water Quality Standards \nnongovernment organization \noutput-based aid \noperation and maintenance \nproject management consultant \nproject management office \nproject performance management system \nsector efficiency improvement unit \nstatement of expenditure \nSmall Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \nTown Development Fund \ntown project coordination committee \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nUnited Nations Children's Fund \nUrban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy \nvillage development committee \n", "water supply and sanitation divisional or subdivisional office \nwater users and sanitation committee  \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n"]}
