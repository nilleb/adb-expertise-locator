The project will assist the Government of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic to improve testing, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 cases to reduce transmission \nand improve clinical management of patients. The project will also improve government resilience \nto future health pandemics and disasters. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic.  In December  2019, COVID-19 emerged and  quickly spread \naround the world, causing a surge in fatalities, especially among people with comorbidities.1 The \nWorld Health Organization  (WHO) declared a global pandemic on  11  March  2020. Since then, \nover 6 million people had been infected globally and over 373,000 had died as of 2 June 2020.2 \nThe  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  announced  the  first  three  cases  of  COVID-19  on  17 \nMarch 2020 and declared a state of emergency on 24 March 2020. By 2 June 2020, there were \n1,845  infected  people,  of  whom  20%  were  health  workers.  With  83%  of  health  workers  being \nfemale,  women  outnumber  men  among  the  infected  people.  A  model  of  the  global  impact  of \nCOVID-19 predicts that many more people could become infected and require hospital care, with \ndevastating  health  and  socioeconomic  impacts.3  The  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  currently \nanticipates the pandemic will peak in the second quarter of 2020, but a second or third wave is \nalso possible as the country considers loosening restrictions and restarting economic activity. \n \n4. \nSocioeconomic impact. The Kyrgyz Republic, with a population of about 6.3 million and \nestimated gross national income per capita of $1,220 (Atlas method, 2018 prices), is one of the \nmost integrated and open economies in Central Asia.4 The country is at high risk to the impacts \nof  the  pandemic  through  its  significant  migrant  population  and  exposure  to  cross-border \ncontamination stemming from high volumes of travel within neighboring countries.5 The economic \ndisruption caused by border closures and emergency lockdown measures have created a large \nfiscal deficit, estimated at $722 million by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).6  \n \n5. \nThe pandemic has resulted in widespread job losses, particularly for those involved in the \nindustry and service sectors (which account for 70% of all employment).  The Ministry of Social \nProtection and Labor identified around 1.8 million people (about 30% of the population) who will \nneed direct social protection support during the economic downturn, including about 1.0 million \n\n \n\n1  Comorbidities are defined as the simultaneous presence of multiple conditions in a patient. Patients with diabetes, \nhypertension, and other cardiovascular conditions appear more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19.  \n\n2  WHO. COVID-19 Dashboard.

The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) estimates that the poverty rate could increase by 26% because of COVID-19 and result in \nan additional 200,000 people falling into poverty.8 \n \n6. \nGovernment response. The government adopted its first legislation to address COVID-\n19 on 29 January 2020. 9 The government requested ADB for emergency assistance on 6 April \n2020. To coordinate the COVID-19 response, the Republican Headquarters for the Prevention of \nthe Spread of COVID-19 was established in the Ministry of Emergency Services with the Prime \nMinister of the Kyrgyz Republic as chair and representatives of all ministries and state agencies \nas members.  To respond to the substantial adverse impact of COVID-19, the  government has \ndeveloped  a  $248  million  COVID-19  countercyclical  plan  and  health  sector  response  plan \ncovering  population  security  and  food  security,  business  entities,  state  budget  stability,  and \nhealth. A separate COVID-19 headquarters was established in  the MOH to manage the health \nsector response.10 The government prepared the National Contingency Action Plan (NCAP) for \nCOVID-19  response  with  partners  led  by  WHO  and  activated  intersector  and  interagency \ncoordination mechanisms.11 \n\n \n7. \nDamage and needs assessment. The NCAP is the first part of the government\u2019s strategic \nresponse,  focused  on  the  health  sector,  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  It \nemphasizes reducing transmission, mortality, and socioeconomic impact, and is expected to cost \n$88 million to implement, assuming 4,000 cases. As stated in the NCAP, the government aims to \n(i) ensure early identification of cases and their safe and effective management; (ii)  reduce the \nseverity  of  disease  by  providing  clinical  care,  especially  to  vulnerable  populations;  (iii)  ensure \ncontingencies are in place  to  avoid disruption of essential medical services; and (iv)  minimize \nsocietal disruption by guiding business continuity.  \n \n8. \nThe capacity of the government and the overall health system to deal with the outbreak \neffectively is low. Therefore as an immediate first step, the country instituted drastic measures to \nprevent the further spread of the pandemic by imposing border restrictions; instituting a lockdown \non the population; closing most businesses, shopping areas, and banks across the country; and \nsuspending  international  and  domestic  flights.  The  MOH  also  introduced  risk  communication \nmeasures and isolation and quarantine of people suspected of having COVID-19 infection, and \ntheir contacts. Development partners have supported expansion of the  COVID-19 surveillance \nand testing system from two laboratories to seven. Laboratory staff have been trained in technical \nand safety procedures. However,  more contact  tracing and testing capacity will be required to \ncontain the predicted surge in cases and before the lockdown can be relaxed. 12  \n\n \n\n7   Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD).  2018.

The  Headquarters  consists  of  all  ministries  and  state  agencies,  including  the  MOH,  Ministry  of \nEmergency Situations, Ministry of Interior, State National Security Agency, State Committee for Defense, Security \nCouncil,  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Economy,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Culture  and  Tourism, \nMinistry  of  Transportation  and  Roads,  State  Border  Service,  State  Custom  Service,  Veterinary  Service,  and \nPhytosanitary Agency. \n\n10 The deputy minister of health is the executive representative and a secretariat in the Department of State Sanitary \n\nand Epidemiology Control. \n\n11 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2020.

COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor: Policy Responses for Kyrgyzstan.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fFor stage one of the pandemic, the government designated 12 hospitals in the cities of \n9. \nBishkek and Osh and four regions (Chui, Jalal-Abad, Batken and Osh) as COVID-19 treatment \ncenters, with a total capacity of 950 beds including 87 intensive care beds. For stage two of the \npandemic,  an  additional  21  hospitals  have  been  identified  throughout  the  country,  with  an \nadditional 1,315 beds including 139 intensive care beds. With effective lockdown, these facilities \nshould, with some adaptation, be enough to handle a slow surge in COVID-19 inpatients, but a \nshortage of intensive care beds  is projected as the  pandemic progresses.  While the  MOH can \nmobilize more health  workers, there is a shortage of  trained intensive care staff.13 The Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s public health spending of about 6.2% of gross domestic product in 2017 is insufficient \nto  handle  a  surge  in  COVID-19  inpatients.14  Health  facilities  are  overwhelmed,  which  also \nthreatens the delivery of essential health services including vaccinations. \n \nFurthermore, these facilities are not up to safety and quality standards for COVID-19 case \n10. \nmanagement  in  terms  of  quarantine  and  waste  management,  medical  supplies,  and  personal \nprotective equipment (PPE). WHO\u2019s assessment of hospitals in the Kyrgyz Republic found that \nstaff  and  visitors  were  ill-informed  about  risks  and  quarantine  and  care  protocols.15  Medical \npersonnel  account  for  21%  of  confirmed  infections,  suggesting  that  the  capacity  to  prevent \ntransmission  in  facilities  may  be  very  low.  Additional  detail  can  be  found  in  the  Summary \nAssessment of Damage and Needs.16 \n \nEmergency  assistance  coordination.  ADB  is  coordinating  with  other  development \n11. \npartners  on  all  potential  areas  for  support. 17  In  February  2020,  the  government  reached  out \nthrough the Development Partners Coordination Council to mobilize resources. The IMF approved \ntwo consecutive loans totaling $241.80 million to address the fiscal gap of the government budget. \nOn 3 April 2020,  the World Bank  approved  a $12.15 million loan  primarily for the purchase of \nmedical supplies and equipment for intensive care units (ICUs) as part of its COVID-19 response, \nand  will  allocate  $9.00  million  from  its  ongoing  Enhancing  Resilience  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic \nProject to support social protection measures. 18 ADB approved a $50.00 million budget-support \nCOVID-19  Active  Response  and  Expenditure  Support  Program  on  4  May  2020.19  Other \ndevelopment partners have established crisis responses such as training and provision of medical \nsupplies. ADB and World Bank teams have preliminarily agreed to conduct joint review missions \nand  will  be  supporting  separate  treatment  facilities,  while  WHO  ensures  overall  emergency \ncoordination in line with the NCAP to fight COVID-19. \n \n12. \nLessons  learned.  The  government  and  development  partners  are  learning  lessons \nthrough  regular  communication  and  coordination  given  the  unique  nature  of  the  COVID-19 \npandemic. The World Bank project for COVID-19 has shown the need for maintaining flexible \nprocurement and implementation arrangements, and that health facilities require  flexible funds \nwhich can be used to respond to emerging needs resulting from the pandemic. ADB\u2019s experience \nin supporting countries during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak shows the \n\nworkers. \n\n \n\n13 There  are  29,502  health  workers  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  including  8,322  physicians  and  21,180  mid-level  health \n\n14 WHO.

During the first critical months, ADB \npartnered  with  technical  agencies  such  as  WHO  to  assist  governments  to  develop  rapid  and \neffective responses while longer-term capacity building needs were identified. 20  \n \nProposed ADB assistance.  This project will provide the most urgently needed supplies \n13. \nand  equipment  and  strengthen  the  health  sector  to  address  the  top  priorities  of  mortality  and \nmorbidity. This project will support the priorities of (i) increasing testing and diagnostic capacity; \n(ii) supporting the protection of health care workers including appropriate specifications of PPE \nand  related  support  for  the  high  proportion  of  female  health  care  workers;  (iii)  strengthening \ninstitutional capacity and accountability mechanisms of government to respond to the crisis; and \n(iv) supporting expansion of treatment capacity including for severely ill patients. The proposed \nproject  aligns  with  five  operational  priorities  within  Strategy  2030:  (i)  addressing  poverty  and \nreducing inequalities, through improved health access; (ii) accelerating gender equality, through \noccupational  safety  and  training  targets  for  women;  (iii)  tackling  climate  change  and  building \nclimate  and  disaster  resilience  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability,  through  improving \nhealth sector capacity; (iv) strengthening governance and institutional capacity; and (v) fostering \nregional cooperation, through reducing risks of cross-border disease transmission. 21 \n \nB. \n \nImpact and outcome. The project is aligned with the following impact: to strengthen the \n14. \npublic health system and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Kyrgyz Republic \n(footnote 11). The project will have the following outcome: capacity in the health system to mitigate \nCOVID-19 improved.22   \n \n15. \nOutput  1:  Capacity  of  surveillance  and  response  services  to  COVID-19 \nstrengthened. The project will help mitigate the surge in COVID-19 cases by increasing health \nsystem capacity to identify and diagnose potentially infected people and improve contact tracing \nfor isolation  of cases.  The output will support the  procurement of PPE, test kits, reagents,  and \nother supplies to increase screening, testing, and prevention of COVID-19 for the sanitary  and \nepidemiological services of the MOH, the COVID-19 laboratories, and other key health facilities \nas agreed with the MOH. Health workers and facility staff who are at highest risk of infection will \nhave increased access to diagnostic services.  \n \n16. \nOutput 2: Capacity for infection prevention control and quality of care for COVID-19 \npatients improved. This output is aligned with the Government\u2019s objective to mitigate the impact \nof  the  epidemic,  by  providing  improved  clinical  care  of  COVID-19  and  avoiding  disruption  of \nessential services. The project will improve eight hospitals that have been designated as COVID-\n19 treatment centers. These comprise five hospitals for stage one in Bishkek, Osh, and Jalalabad \nrequiring  additional  support;  and  three  hospitals  for  stage  two  in  Naryn,  Talas,  and  Issyk-Kul \nregion. These hospitals currently have 792 beds with 81 intensive care beds. The hospitals were \nselected on the basis of COVID-19 cases, geographical coverage, existing capacity to manage \ninfectious diseases, support from other donors, and projected need for additional ICU beds.  \n\nThe project will assist these hospitals to function as COVID-19 treatment centers including \n17. \nstaff training, quarantine, and infection prevention control arrangements and expansion of ICU by \n\n \n\n \n\n20 ADB.  2011.

The proposed emergency assistance loan and grant \nmeets the eligibility criteria for ADB\u2019s emergency assistance financing as (i) it helps refurbish high-\npriority  physical assets, such as  hospitals and medical facilities,  and  restore economic, social, \nand  governance  activities  by  improving  confidence  in  public  health  capacity  so  that  regular \nactivities may resume; (ii) it is designed to mitigate immediate losses to priority assets, capacity, \nor  productivity  (such  as  health  care  workers);  (iii)  it  provides  immediate  short-term  transitional \nassistance; (iv) it is restricted to the transition phase and is exclusively for priority rehabilitation; \nand (v) it complements efforts by other development partners to ease the transition from relief to \nnormal development. \n\n \n\nValue Added by ADB  \n\nC. \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s overall support to the government will mitigate economic losses and help close the \nfinancing gap in the government\u2019s budget to meeting essential expenditures in 2020. This project \nis  part  of  a  comprehensive  package  of  support  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  including  immediate \nsupport  in  the  form  of  (i)  a  $200,000  technical  assistance  grant  and  additional  financing  of \n$700,000 from ADB regional technical assistance to procure emergency supplies including PPE;26 \n(ii) a joint ADB\u2013\u2013United Nations Development Programme socioeconomic study of the impact of \nthe pandemic on the country\u2019s poor and vulnerable communities; and (iii) an approved $50 million \nCOVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program, under the countercyclical support \nfacility\u2013\u2013COVID-19  pandemic  response  option.  ADB  and  the  government  are  discussing  an \nadditional  $50  million  policy-based  loan  in  2020  for  social  protection  and  fiscal  resilience. 27  In \naddition, ADB will provide additional medium-term support to the government through the regional \ntechnical  assistance  for  Addressing  Health  Threats  in  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  \nCooperation Countries and Central West Region Developing Member Countries. 28 As a trusted \npartner in the Kyrgyz Republic, ADB is providing financing, knowledge and technical support. \n\n \n\n23 The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic issued regulation No.194, dated 3 April 2020, \u201cRegulation of the ordinance \nof the spending of the funds received for the support of the pandemic measures and its operating mechanism,\u201d which \nadds a hardship allowance to health and other workers supporting facilities fighting COVID-19. The allowance in a \nform of nonrefundable payment is payable through the Mandatory Health Insurance Fund (MHIF), which supports a \nsingle payer system in health care and has adequate facilities to track transactions and e-procurement.  \n\n24 Minor repairs and refurbishment of facilities cover repair of handwashing and hygiene facilities, electrical and sewage \nrepairs, staff and patient safety, repair of health wards to convert them to ICUs where new equipment will be placed, \nand meeting temporary housing needs for health workers. \n\n25  Support  for  health  workers  allowances  beyond  the  8  facilities  will  be  considered  depending  on  the  scale  of  the \n\noutbreak and once detailed costs for supporting the 8 facilities are determined during implementation. \n\n26  ADB.  2020.

The \nloan  and  grant  are  expected  to  be  financially  closed  by  30  June  2022.  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and- described in detail in the PAM (footnote 29). The \nMOH will be the executing agency and will appoint a senior staff member as the project director. \nThe  MOH  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  the  primary  implementing  agency,  while \nfiduciary and disbursement functions will be provided by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The PIU \nwill  report  both  to  the  MOH  and  the  MOF.  The  MOH  will  be  responsible  and  accountable  for \nprocurement,  coordinating  with  other  development  partners,  monitoring  and  evaluating  project \nindicators, and gender targets. Individual consultants will be recruited by the MOH as needed to \nsupport with  monitoring and evaluation, procurement, civil works monitoring, procurement,  and \nother  implementation  activities.  The  MOF  will  be  responsible  for  financial  management, \ndisbursements,  contract  management,  financial  reporting,  project  records  management,  and \naudits management.  \n \nThe Mandatory Health Insurance Fund (MHIF) will administer funds for refurbishment of \n24. \neight  hospital  and  top-up  salary  and  hardship  allowances  to  health  workers  under  output  2, \namounting to $2 million. The MHIF\u2019s role will be limited to transferring funds; collecting supporting \ndocuments  from  the  eight  hospitals;  recording  individual  contracts  for  refurbishment  and \nmonitoring  the  contractual  payment  compliance;  recording  additional  payments  to  individual \nhealth workers; and  preparing financial reporting  of activities at the hospital level for the  eight \nproject facilities.30 The arrangements for funds transfer will follow the same mode agreed between \nthe government and the World Bank, subject to ADB\u2019s review and approval, and will be updated \nin the PAM.31 Eligible items to be financed include refurbishment and repair of  health facilities, \nand installation of equipment and related utilities. The funds may also be used to top up the salary \nand hardship allowance to health workers engaged in the COVID-19 response.  \n \nProcurement. Considering the unique nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing \n25. \nglobal shortage of goods required to respond to the health crisis, value for money will be achieved \nby balancing the time, quality, and cost. Direct contracting with MOH established suppliers, World \nBank suppliers, and/or United Nations agencies will be conducted to assure consistent quality of \nproducts and to attain the best price. Goods will be procured using the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended  from  time  to  time),  as  well  as  the  additional  exemptions  as  endorsed  per  ADB\u2019s \ncomprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic.32 Procurement could involve suppliers from \nnon-ADB member countries, and at government request ADB will apply universal procurement \n(footnote 32).

Project  activities  are  based  on  key  mitigation  priorities \nidentified in the NCAP and are based on global best practices, tailored for the local context. By \nfocusing  on  a  small  number  of  facilities  for  treating  COVID-19,  resources  and  staff  can  be \ndeployed more efficiently. Equipment and infrastructure provided to facilities will be standardized \nwith those provided by other donors to ensure compatibility and minimize training requirements. \nThe project has  a low climate  risk category as project sites will be in  urban and/or semi-urban \nareas with limited to no direct risks from climatic conditions. The activities supported by this project \nwill contribute to increased resilience to future pandemics by increasing the capacity of hospitals \nand the health workforce on infection prevention control and clinical management of patients. \n\n \n\n\fSustainability \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nB. \n \n27. \nPreliminary  analysis  by  ADB  shows  that  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  will  suffer  significant \neconomic  impact  because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  with  estimated  losses  of  up  to  $529 \nmillion.33 The project outputs will save lives and address short-term gaps in the health system. \nFinancial viability assessment is not necessary since project outputs are public service goods with \nno  opportunity  for  cost  recovery  as  testing  and  treatment  of  COVID-19  are  sponsored  by  the \nGovernment  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.34  Because  of  the  short  processing  time  available  for  the \nemergency  response,  due  diligence  following  ADB  guidelines  on  economic  analysis will  be \nconducted during project implementation within 3 months of project effectiveness.35 The MOF will \nprovide necessary information to ADB to undertake the project economic analysis, in compliance \nwith ADB requirements. \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  the  project  assets  will  be  funded  through  the \nMOH\u2019s recurrent budget. While the contracts for procurement of equipment under the project will \nensure  supplier-provided  maintenance  over  the  short  term,  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to \nensure adequate budget allocations for operations and maintenance post-COVID-19 project will \nbe covenanted in the financing agreement and monitored during project implementation. In view \nof expected adverse macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Kyrgyz Republic, \npublic debt levels are expected to peak at 66% of gross domestic product in 2020.36 Therefore, \nduring  implementation  a  loan  covenant  will  ensure  that  the  MOH  submits  a  comprehensive \nfinancial analysis of the operation and maintenance costs for project assets. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nADB completed a governance risk assessment in 2018 according to the implementation \nguidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. The  assessment found \nthat the country\u2019s public financial management systems were functioning well overall and  had \nimproved in the  areas of  budgeting, transparency,  Treasury  functions, tax administration, debt \nmanagement, financial reporting, and legislative framework (new budget code). However, several \nweaknesses  remain,  including  investment  planning  and  estimation  of  expenditures,  off-budget \nfunds,  financial  management  information  system,  and  internal  and  external  audits,  which  are \nbeing addressed through a 3-year World Bank and European Union technical assistance project. \n \nThe financial management assessment concluded that project financial management risk \n30. \nis substantial, because of the emergency nature of the project; the potential adverse impacts of \nweak  internal  and  external  audit  arrangements  on  the  internal  controls  framework;  the  limited \nstrength of finance  and internal audit staff within  the  MOF, MOH, and MHIF; and the potential \nmisuse of funds by target hospitals and staff incentive payments. Key risk mitigating strategies \nare  set  out  in  the  financial  management  assessment.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.

Washington, DC. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nAs per ADB\u2019s project procurement risk assessment, procurement risk is medium mainly \n31. \nbecause  of  limited  experience  with  ADB  procurement  procedures  and  the  smaller  size  of \npackages. Accordingly, capacity of the PIU will be enhanced with additional consultants and close \nsupervision  by  project  staff,  and  direct  contracting  through  United  Nations  agencies  will  be \nencouraged  to  leverage  buying  power.  The  government  is  also  planning  to  strengthen \nprocurement rules to enhance transparency, including subjecting all  procurement of emergency \nsupplies to an ex-post audit by the Audit Chamber with results published on the MOF website.  \n \nE. \n \nDuring 2012\u20132018, the poverty rate in the Kyrgyz Republic dropped from 38% to 22%.37 \n32. \nIn the Kyrgyz Republic as elsewhere, the COVID-19 pandemic will have a much higher impact on \nthe poor and near-poor as a result of lower access to information and services, lockdown resulting \nin loss of jobs during and after the pandemic, and the increasing cost of food and medical and \nother services. The project will benefit all  citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic including the poor by \npreventing or mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and comorbidity through provision of inclusive \nhealth services and improved well-being.  \n \nF. \n\nGender \n \n\nThe  project\u2019s  gender  categorization  is  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Initial  evidence \n33. \nsuggests that, globally, COVID-19 affects men more than women. However, infections in women \noutnumber men in the Kyrgyz Republic, with  53% of cases in females. Women predominate in \nthe health services, with 83% of the health workers being female, placing women most at risk of \ncontracting an occupational COVID-19 infection. The government is developing testing protocols \nthat will proactively increase access to testing for health workers, and prioritize testing based on \nrisk.  The  government  has  also  approved  a  resolution  (footnote  23)  that  outlines  additional \nremuneration for health workers involved in COVID-19 treatment and control. These measures \nare  expected  to  benefit  and  compensate  health  workers  for  the  additional  risks  and  workload \ncaused by the COVID-19 response. \n\n34. \nEquipment designed for men may not fit women properly. Adequate and gender-sensitive \nfacilities are also important. This project will support provision of sanitation measures for medical \nstaff; separate changing rooms for men and women; and rest areas for female doctors, nurses, \nand other facility staff. Training and retraining for medical personnel involved in COVID-19 patient \ncare will be provided to quickly train staff to safely care for patients and themselves. To ensure \neffective gender mainstreaming in the project, the following gender designs and targets have been \nagreed with the  MOH: (i)  equal access to testing; (ii)  targets for  providing incentives to female \nhealth workers; (iii) capacity building and training on appropriate use of PPE, infection prevention, \nand patient management; (iv) gender-sensitive changing and rest areas for health workers; and \n(v) provision of appropriate PPE and sanitary supplies.  \n\n \n\n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\nG. \n \n35. \ncategories are as follows.38 \n \n\n \n37 ADB.

The  proposed  project  will  cover  urgent  priorities,  such  as \n36. \nPPE,  medical  equipment  for  ICUs,  and  laboratory  supplies.  There  may  be  very  small-scale \nrefurbishment works for preparing the infrastructure for the equipment within the existing facilities. \nHence, minimal environmental impacts are envisaged. Category C for environmental safeguards \nhas therefore been proposed. A code of construction practice has been prepared and attached to \nthe PAM and will be implemented to address the limited environmental impacts. \n \n37. \nInvoluntary resettlement  and indigenous  peoples  (category C).  The project will not \nresult  in  any  new  land  acquisition  as  civil  works  will  entail  minor  refurbishment  and  repair  of \nexisting medical facilities. Site-based social due diligence will be performed based on a screening \nchecklist to confirm no impacts related to economic displacement and restriction of access in land \nuse.  Should  due  diligence  confirm  occurrence  of  adverse  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts, the project will be recategorized accordingly and measures will be taken to mitigate such \nimpacts.  Ethnic  minorities  in  the  proposed  urban  project  sites  constitute  about  10%  of  the \npopulation and are economically fully integrated and at parity with the Kyrgyz. These minorities \nare  not  considered  indigenous  as  defined  by  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  for  project \noperation purposes.   \n\n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nH. \n \n38. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan. 39  \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nRisks \nLimited capacity of MOH to adequately assess \nneeds and capacities at the facility level \nweakens the relevance of the project activities \n\nHigh infection rate among health workers (21% \nof all cases) together with low salaries and \nunclear health and life insurance schemes will \nleave the system with a severe shortage of \ndoctors at the peak of the contagion  \n\nRisk posed by mismanagement of funds \ntransfers through the MHIF   \n  \n \n \n\nMitigation Measures \nPIU  staff will  be  engaged  to  support  the  MOH  to  assess  needs \nand  capacities  at  facility  level.
