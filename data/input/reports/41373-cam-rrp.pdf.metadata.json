Cambodia\u2019s growth has been unevenly concentrated in urban \nareas; a key thrust of the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) \n2006\u20132010  is  to  reduce  rural  poverty,  particularly  through  policy  and \nfinancial support to the agriculture sector. Agriculture employs 70% of \nthe rural population and accounts for about one-third of gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP).  Yet  the  public  financial  management  (PFM)  system \nthat  manages  and  delivers  the  resources  for  rural  development  is \nconstrained in a number of areas. Most critically, government capacity \nis  limited  in  the  area  of  PFM,  where  a  scarcity  of  qualified  and \ncompetent  finance  specialists  and  line  managers  severely  affect  the \nquality and effectiveness of the budget process. \n \nThe  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  (PFMRP)  was \nlaunched in December 2004 by the Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(MEF)  to  address  weaknesses  in  the  PFM  system.  PFMRP  aims  to \nestablish  a  strong  PFM  system  to  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the \nNSDP.  It  has  been  designed  as  a  long-term  rolling  program,  building \non  a  series  of  platforms.  The  four  platforms  specify  a  package  of \nreform  activities,  including  complementary  institutional,  capacity  and \nincentive reforms that, when completed, will provide a comprehensive \nPFM system for Cambodia. Platform 1 has already been implemented. \nIts objective was to make the budget more credible as an instrument of \nstrategic  management  of  public  resources  and  to  hold  budget \nmanagers accountable for efficient use of these resources. \n \nOf  particular  concern  for  rural  development,  is  the  fact  that  the  line \nministries which support rural development in Cambodia are currently \nsome  of  the  weakest  and  most  underfunded  of all  the  ministries.  The \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nThe Program \nObjectives \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n\nin \n\npublic \n\nexacerbate \n\n(i)  strengthening \n\nunderfunded,  which \n\nthree  policy  areas  by: \n\nthree ministries are the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), Ministry \nof  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries  (MAFF),  and  Ministry  of  Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM).  In  addition,  there  are \noverlaps  of  responsibilities  in  the  three  ministries.  They  suffer  from \nweak interministerial and intraministerial coordination mechanisms and \nshortages  of  qualified  staff.  Critically,  their  budgets  also  tend  to  be \ngrossly \nexpenditure \ninefficiencies and contribute directly to low levels of service delivery in \nrural  areas  and  to  reduced  economic  opportunities  for  the  rural  poor. \nIncreasing  the  quality  of  PFM  systems  in  these  ministries is  a  priority \nfor the Government and also for the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nwhich  currently  provides  sizeable  investment  resources  to  these \nsectors. \n \nThe  program\u2019s  objective  is  to  assist  in  implementing  the  PFMRP, \nparticularly  in  the  three  aforementioned  rural  development  ministries. \nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  the  program  will  support  government \nreforms \nfinancial \nmanagement  and  increasing  accountability,  (ii)  strengthening  PFM  in \nrural  development  ministries,  and  (iii)  improving  external  auditing. \nADB-financed PFMRDP will target (i) the capacity development needs \nof  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  in  budget  planning,  preparation  and \nexecution; procurement; and internal audit for better service delivery to \nrural  communities;  and  (ii)  the  capacity  development  needs  of  the \nNational  Audit  Authority  (NAA)  to  improve  the  overall  governance \nframework of the Cambodian public sector. \n \nIt is proposed that the ADB provides a program grant of $6.71 million \nfrom  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance  subprogram  1  of  the \nPFMRDP,  subject  to  such  other  terms  and  conditions  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement. \n \nThe implementation period for subprogram 1 is from  June 2006 to 31 \nDecember 2008, with a single tranche of $6.71 million to be disbursed \nunder subprogram 1 when the Government has met the conditions for \nthe grant to become effective. The closing date of the grant will be 90 \ndays  from  the  date  the  Government  has  met  the  conditions  for  the \ngrant to become effective. Policy actions for subprogram 2 are subject \nto  revision  and  refinement  following  ADB\u2019s  assessment  of  the \nmacroeconomic  environment,  lessons  learned  from  implementing \nsubprogram 1, and the overall progress of PFM reforms. Subprogram \n2,  currently  estimated  at  $15.0  million,  will  be  presented \nfor \nconsideration and approval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors based on the \nprogress achieved in implementing subprogram 1, including the status \nof  compliance  with  the  proposed  policy  actions,  and  the  readiness  of \nthe Government to undertake the succeeding policy reform measures. \nThe  implementation  period  for  subprogram  2  is  within  24  months  of \nsubprogram 1 grant effectiveness agreement. \n \nThe  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \nto  primarily  meet  program \ngenerated  by \n\nthe  grant  proceeds \n\n\fexpenditures and associated reform costs. \n \n\n \nExecuting Agencies  MEF and NAA for the audit component. \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\niii \n\nto \n\n \nThe  coordination  and  program  management  structures  established  by \nthe  Government  for  its  public  financial  management  reform  program \n(PFMRP),  and  as  described  below,  shall  be  used \nfacilitate \nimplementation  of  the  Program.  The  Government\u2019s  Economic  and \nFinancial  Policy  Committee  chaired  by  the  deputy  prime  minister  and \nMinister of the Ministry of Economy and Finance and comprising other \nkey  ministers  and  secretaries  of  state  of  line  ministries  shall  provide \noverall policy guidance. The  Government\u2019s steering committee on PFM \n(PSC), chaired by the secretary of state of the MEF and comprising the \nDeputy  Governor  of  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia,  the  secretary \ngeneral  of  the  Cambodia  Rehabilitation  and  Development  Board,  and \nsenior  representatives  in  charge  of  finance  at  the  level  of  secretary \ngeneral  or  director  general  in  charge  of  finance  shall  be  the  program \nsteering  committee  (PSC)  for  PFMRDP  responsible  for  coordinating \nprogram  implementation  and  sustaining  of  subprogram  1  actions  by \nrelevant ministries and agencies of the Government. The PFM working \ngroups  established  at  each  of  the  spending  ministries,  and  chaired  by \nthe  relevant  member  of  the  PSC  for  PFM  shall  support  Program \nimplementation  at  the  ministry  level.  The  PSC  for  PFM  shall  meet  as \nrequired to: (a) review progress reports from the PFM working groups; \n(b)  monitor  progress  and  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  Program; \nand (c) provide guidance and direction to relevant line agencies of the \nGovernment  involved  in  Program  actions  and  activities.  The  PSC  for \nPFM  shall  ensure  that  the  reforms  are  undertaken  in  line  with  the \nagreed timetable and may invite ADB to participate in its meetings as an \nobserver  The  PSC  for  PFM  will  provide  the  link  between  two \nsubprograms. MEF shall be the Program Executing Agency and will be \nresponsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  pillars  1  and  2  of \nsubprogram  1,  including  compliance  with  all  policy  actions,  program \nadministration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records, \nreporting to ADB. NAA will be the Executing Agency for the audit pillar \nof PFMRDP. \n \nThe  program  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member \ncountries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. The grant proceeds will be disbursed \nto \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements \nfor Program Loans. \n \nThe  PFMRDP  will  support  Cambodia's  efforts  to  reduce  poverty  by \nintroducing  prioritization  and  optimality  in  resource  allocation.  The \nProgram will: \n(i) \n\nimprove  institutional  arrangements  and  management  practices  to \nsupport  incentives  for  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  public \nservices; \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nthe  Borrower \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nGrant Assistance  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nincrease  fiscal  discipline  by  allocating  resources  in  accordance \nwith  strategic  priorities  and  ensure  reallocation  from  lesser  to \nhigher priorities; \n\n(iii)  ensure  operational  efficiency  in  public  expenditure  management \nthrough streamlined procurement and expenditure processes;  \n(iv)  improve  accountability  by  putting  more  focus  on  performance, \n\naccountability, audit oversight, and internal control; \n(v)  strengthen NAA as a pillar of national integrity; and \n(vi)  improve  PFM  systems,  which  are  critical  to  optimizing  donor \nassistance,  since  aid  is  increasingly  being  provided  through \nmodalities \nthat  depend  on  well-functioning  development, \nexecution, and control of budgets. \n\nis \n\n(ii) \n\nfirmly  embedded \n\nimplementation  of \n\nfor  Government-wide \n\nin  NSDP  and  PFMRP, \n\n \nThe  Program \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda.  However,  the  following  risks  and \nmitigation measures have been identified.  \n \n(i)  Political  risks  is  a  risk  to  the  sustainability  of  PFMRDP.  There  is \nstrong ownership in MEF, but the existing incentives for some line \nministries may not be sufficient to garner wide-ranging institutional \nthe  reform \nsupport \nprograms  and  to  ensure  expected  outcomes  across  all  levels  of \nGovernment. However, given the strong commitment to reforms at \nthe  highest  level  of  political  leadership  and  the  broad  consensus \non  the  nature  of  those  reforms,  there  is  little  risk  that  the \nmomentum for reform will wane. \nImplementation may be undermined by excessive centralization in \ndecision  making  without  adequate  financial  resources.  Mitigating \nthis  risk  will  involve  taking  measures  to  strengthen  technical  and \nadministrative  capacity  within  the  ongoing  reform  program  and \nthrough  sector \ninvestments.  Performance  monitoring  and \nenhancing  Implementing  Agency  ownership  of  the  program  and \nidentifying reform champions will also be used to mitigate risk. \n(iii)  The  current  global  economic  slowdown  may  cause  the  current \naccount balance to widen and disrupt macroeconomic stability, as \nCambodia  depends  heavily  on  exports.  Weaker  growth  may  in \nturn  worsen  the  institutional  environment,  thereby  limiting  the \nopportunity  for  reform.  However,  in  the  near  term,  continued \nemphasis  on  increasing  tax  revenue  collections  can  improve  the \nfiscal  position,  including  limiting  supply-side  effects  of  reduced \ngrowth prospects on institutional incentives for PFM reforms. \n\nto  support \n\ninstitutional  and  capacity  development \n\n \nA  project \nis \nestimated to cost $4.54 million equivalent. ADB will finance $4.1 million \non a grant basis from its Special Funds resources and the Government \nwill  finance  $445,000  equivalent  by  providing  counterpart  staff, \naccommodation,  and  other  facilities.  All  taxes  and  duties  will  be \nfinanced by ADB.  \n \nThe  project  will  be  the  key  instrument  supporting  roll-out  of  PFM \nreforms  in  rural-development  ministries.  Four  project  components  will \n\n\fv \n\nin \n\nrecording,  and \n\nsupport PFM reforms in the medium-term. One component will support \nrural  development  ministries  (MAFF,  MRD,  and  MOWRAM) \nto \nimplement  and  monitor  key  PFM  reforms,  with  a  focus  on  enhancing \nbudget  planning,  budget  execution \n(including  procurement), \nreporting.  Another  component  will \naccounting, \nstrengthen  internal  audit  mechanisms  in  these  ministries,  which  will \nincrease  management  efficiency  and  improve  financial  controls  and \nprocedures.  Strengthening  public  debt  management \nthe \nGovernment will be another critical area of support (following on from \nprogress achieved from a recently concluded ADB TA project on debt \nmanagement).  In  addition,  the  project  will  support  NAA  to  improve  its \naudit  capacity  and  operational  efficiency,  as  NAA  has  a  fundamental \nrole  in  improving  the  quality  of  financial  governance,  reinforcing \ninstitutional  oversight,  and  providing  checks  and  balances  in  the \nmanagement of public finances. Implementation of PFM reforms under \nsubprogram 2 will also require technical inputs and targeted on-the-job \nsupport  to  equip  the  key  Government  agencies  with  the  knowledge \nand  skills  to  ensure  that  the  reforms  will  be  sustained  beyond \nPFMRDP and that reform triggers under subprogram 2 are achieved. \n \nThe Project is estimated to cost $4.54 million including estimated taxes \nand  duties  of  $25,000.

The PFMRDP was prepared by a joint team of representatives of the Government \nof Cambodia (the Government) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The program design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT \n\n \nThe Macroeconomic Context \n \n2. \nSustained High Economic Growth. Cambodia is at a crossroads as it transits from the \nlegacy  of  its  conflict-ridden  past  and  attempts  to  build  institutions  of  democratic  governance. \nStrengthening  institutions  in  a  range  of  areas  and  economic  policies  is  important  not  only  for \nreducing the risk of future conflict, but also for attracting foreign investments to support broad-\nbased economic recovery. Cambodia has recorded double-digit economic growth over the last 4 \nyears,  averaging  11%  annually  (Table  1  overleaf).  This  growth  has  been  driven  primarily  by \nindustry  (garments  and  construction  in  particular).  Economic  growth  reached  10.2%  in  2007, \nwith  the  services  sector  growing  faster  than  the  industrial  sector.  Up  to  mid-2007,  economic \ngrowth  occurred  in  an  environment  of  modest  inflation,  with  rates  fluctuating  between  4%  and \n6%  between  2005  and  2007.  Exports\u2014mainly  garments\u2014grew  by  11%  in  2007  while  imports \nexpanded by 14%, reflecting increased demand for investment goods. Overall, the trade deficit \nwas 15.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 and 15.4% for the first 7 months of 2008. \nWith tourism reaching new heights, the current account deficit was 8.1% of GDP for the first 7 \nmonths  of  2008  and  rapid  capital  inflows  took  the  balance  of  payments  to  a  surplus  of  4%  of \nGDP in 2007. \n \n3. \nFiscal  Policy  Has  Generally  Been  Prudent.  Given  its  importance  to  macroeconomic \nmanagement,  fiscal  policy  has  been  the  key  to  the  pro-growth  investment  environment  in \nCambodia.  The 2007 budget results did not vary substantially from past budgets, as revenue \ncollections  were  above  target  and  expenditures  were  contained  close  to  target  levels.  The \nbudget\u2019s  primary  balance  showed  a  healthy  surplus,  while  the  overall  deficit,  incorporating \ninvestment outlays, amounted to a deficit of only about 0.4% of GDP for the first 7 months of \n2008, continuing the trend over the last few years. However, the Government budget continued \nto  be  contractionary,  while  Government  deposits  in  the  banking  system  have  continued  to \nincrease.  While  the  macroeconomic  variables  of  economic  growth  and  balance  of  payments \nwere still clearly robust in 2007, there is cause for concern in 2008 and beyond unless inflation \nis brought under control. \n\n \n\n4. \nChallenges  to  Sustaining  Economic  growth  in  2008  and  2009.  Recent    global \neconomic  problems  have  negatively  affected  demand  for  Cambodian  exports.  The  sharp \nslowdown in the US economy, for example, is affecting US demand for garment exports from \nCambodia, which fell by 1% in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same period of 2007. \nThe unexpected recent surge in international food and energy prices has translated to double-\ndigit  rates  of  inflation  in  2008;  this  in  turn  is  slowing  household  consumption  and  economic \ngrowth. Recent increases in oil prices may cut the economic growth rate by as much as three \npercentage points in 2008 (to about 6.5%), as production costs in Cambodia tend to have high \nfuel components. ADB forecasts that Cambodia\u2019s economic growth may slow by as much as 3 \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\npercentage points in 2008, mostly because of increased fuel costs. This forecast is consistent \nwith the Government\u2019s own forecasts, which put economic growth in the range of 6\u20138% in 2008. \nHigh  inflation  will  have  a  negative  impact  on  poverty  incidence  in  urban  centers,  and  if  it \npersists may also affect Cambodia\u2019s Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of a poverty \nrate of 28% by 2010.  \n\n \nTable 1: Country Economic Indicators, 2004\u20132008 \n \n\n2004 \n\na.

In 2004, the Government announced its long-term \n5. \ndevelopment  strategy\u2014the  Rectangular  Strategy\u2014that  sets  out  the  country\u2019s  development \npriorities  and  policy  agenda  as  a  series  of  four  interlocking  rectangles  with  governance  at  its \ncore.  The  overarching  priority  of  the  strategy  is  better  governance  and  institution  building, \nincluding  fighting  corruption  and  public  administrative  reforms.  The  Rectangular  Strategy \nstresses  governance  as  critical  to  economic  growth  through  agriculture,  infrastructure,  private \nsector  growth,  employment,  and  human  resource  development.  In  2006,  the  Government \nannounced its second 5-year National Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 (NSDP) which \naimed to streamline, prioritize and operationalize the Rectangular Strategy, and to help achieve \nthe Cambodian Millennium Development Goal interim targets (2010) through implementation of \nidentified  programs  and  projects  for  development.  The  Public  Financial  Management  Reform \nProgram (PFMRP) was also launched in 2004 by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) \nin  response  to  weaknesses  in  the  public  financial  management  (PFM)  system.  Drawing  on \nPublic Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) best-practice, the PFM reform program \nhas  been  designed  as  a  long-term  rolling  program,  building  on  a  series  of  four  interlinking \nplatforms  that  specify  a  package  of  reform  activities,  including  complementary  institutional, \ncapacity,  and  incentive  reforms.  When  completed,  the  PFMRP  will  provide  a  comprehensive \nPFM system for Cambodia and serve as a basis for subsequent platforms.1 Figure 1 highlights \nthe links between Government and ADB strategies.  \n \nThe ADB country strategy and program 2005\u201320092 for Cambodia has highlighted good \n6. \ngovernance  as  critical  to  improving  the  responsiveness,  cost  effectiveness,  efficiency,  and \nquality of public service delivery, especially to the poor. The country operations business plan \nfor  Cambodia  for  2007\u20132009 3  further  seeks  to  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  support  of \ngovernance  activities,  as  it  is  widely  recognized  that  significant  strides  in  long-term  poverty \nreduction  is  only  possible  with  far-reaching  fundamental  reforms  in  PFM.  Within  this  context, \nthe  country  strategy  and  program  is  focusing  on  PFM  as  a  primary  area  of  concentration, \nbuilding upon past and ongoing ADB activities. This policy emphasis is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nSecond  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan,  which  has  PFM,  procurement,  and \nanticorruption  as  central  themes  for  improving  governance.  Figure  1  show  linkages  between \nthe Government\u2019s reform programs and PFM for rural development. \n \nPartnership  with  Development  Partners.  To  maximize  harmonization  and  minimize \n7. \ntransaction costs, development partners are using a sector-wide approach to support PFM. The \nconsensus  among  development  partners  is  that  the  PFM  reform  program  should \nemphasize:  (i)  aligning  the  PFM  work  with  the  country\u2019s  capacity  and  priorities  and  ensuring \nstrong  country  ownership  of  PFM  reforms,  (ii)  appropriate  prioritization  and  sequencing  of \nreforms within a multiyear time horizon, (iii) close coordination among development partners in \nsupporting PFM reforms, and (iv) using the internationally agreed PEFA PFM indicators for an \nintegrated and harmonized approach to measuring and monitoring performance and progress. \nThe  PFMRDP  is  consistent  with  PFMRP,  reflecting  the  shared  understanding  of  the \ndevelopment  partners  of  the  PFM  problems  in  Cambodia. 4 The  PFMRDP  is  built  around  a \n                                                 \n1 The PEFA Program, comprising eight multilateral organizations as partners, aims to strengthen recipient and donor \nability to assess the status of country public expenditure, procurement, and financial accountability systems. It has \nabout 28 indicators intended to assist in the evaluation of public financial management systems. \n\n2  ADB. 2005. ADB Country Strategy and Program ( 2005\u20132009): Cambodia.

Economic growth has been \nthe  main  driver  of  social  and  economic  development  in  Cambodia.  The  national  poverty  rate \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\ndeclined  from  47%  in  1994  to  34%  in  2004.  While  the  benefits  of  growth  have  been  widely \nspread  across  Cambodia,  the  rural  poverty  rate  has  not  declined  as  expected,  and  was \nestimated at 39% in 2004. With 80% of the population residing outside the main urban centers, \nthis translates to more than 4 million persons living below the poverty line in rural areas. Rural \npoverty in Cambodia has other dimensions besides low incomes. The poor have limited access \nto  basic  goods  and  services  such  as  clean  water,  education,  and  health  services.  These  are \nproblems  that  Cambodia  needs  to  overcome  to  achieve  several  of  its  key  MDGs  (Table  1). \nCambodia\u2019s  MDG  target  for  poverty  is  24%  of  the  population  by  2015.  To  achieve  this  target \nwill  require  average  economic  growth  of  7.5%  per  annum  from  2008  to  2015,  inflation  in  the \nrange of 3%, and no change in the distribution of income between urban and rural families. If \ninequality  between  rural  and  urban  areas  increases,  higher  growth  may  be  necessary  to \nachieve  this  target. 5  Thus,  increasing  the  efficiency  of  public  resources  targeted  for  rural \ndevelopment  and  increasing  private  sector-led  economic  opportunities  in  rural  areas  will  be \ncrucially important to accomplishing Cambodia\u2019s MDG for poverty reduction. \n \n\n9. \nIncome  Inequality  (Figures  2  and  3).  Cambodia\u2019s  average  living  standards  as \nmeasured by consumption of goods and services per capita per day, increased by 32% in real \nterms between 1994 and 2004 (Figure 2). However, the increase in rural living standards was \nslower than in Phnom Penh and other major urban centers. Consequently, inequality measured \nby  the  Gini  coefficient  increased  from  0.35  in  1994  to  0.4  in  2004.  The  increase  in  inequality \nhas primarily been caused by rapid urban growth, much of which occurred between 1994 and \n1997. Some widening of inequality is expected as a country develops, since growth tends to be \nurban-driven.  Some  of  the  gap  also  arose  because  of  unequal  access  to  public  services  and \nresources, but this  gap has narrowed since 1997. Various measures of school enrollment and \nmortality  rates  in  rural  areas  have  fallen  over  time.  The  disparity  in  access  to  infrastructure \n(roads), amenities (clean water and electricity), and basic services (schooling, healthcare) also \nnarrowed between 1997 and 2004, as did gender gaps in literacy and schooling.  \n\n \nBudget Allocations to the Rural Sector. NSDP seeks to achieve economic growth and \n10. \nreduce  poverty  through  measures  that  promote  development  of  agriculture,  and  rapid \nimprovement  in  infrastructure  and  human  development.  NSDP  also  emphasizes  improved \ngovernance  and  public  expenditure  efficiency.  All  these  measures  if  effectively  delivered  will \npositively  impact  rural  development,  reduce  rural  poverty,  and  reduce  income  inequality \nbetween  rural  and  urban  areas.  Yet  Cambodia\u2019s  budget  resources  remain  scarce  and  donor \ninvestment  funding  is  inadequate  in  most  areas.  Insufficient  resources  for  recurrent  and \ninvestment  expenditures  continue  to  adversely  affect  operational  planning,  resulting  in \nunderfunded  implementation  for  development  projects  in  the  country.  Cambodia\u2019s  budget  is \nseparated  between  the  capital  and  recurrent  budgets,  reflecting  that  the  Ministry  of  Planning \n(investment)  and  the  MEF  (current)  prepare  separate  budgets.  But  the  majority  of  investment \nactivities  are  financed  by  donors  off-budget.  The  domestically  financed  and  on-budget  donor-\nfinanced  investment  budget  is  essentially  a  project  budget  with  some  recurrent  expenditure \nlinked  to  project  financing.  The  fragmentation  between  recurrent  and  investment  budget \nallocation processes and high degree of off-budget donor flows has led to inefficient investment \nplanning and allocations. \n \n11.  While  there  are  major  difficulties  in  accurately  estimating  what  portion  of  public \nresources  go  to  rural  development  or  the  rural  population,  it  is  estimated  that  about  4.4%  of \nrecurrent  budget  allocations  are  provided  to  the  three  departments  involved  in  rural \n\n                                                 \n5   Oum,  S.  2007. A  Recursive  Dynamic  CGE  Assessment  of  the  Cambodian  Millennium  Poverty  Reduction  Target. \n\nCenter for Policy Studies. Melbourne, Australia: Monash University.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ndevelopment\u2014the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD);  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry, \nand Fisheries (MAFF); and the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM). This \nhas increased over time from 0.5% in the mid-1990s. MRD, MAFF, and MOWRAM currently use \nan  incremental  approach  to  planning  and  budgeting  that  limits  their  expenditures  to  new  and \npredominantly investment projects financed by donors. The recurrent expenditure arising out of \nexisting  and  proposed  activities  (mostly  donor  financed),  through  require  priority  budgeting,  is \nunderfunded, adversely impacting on service delivery to the poor. The focus of these ministries \nis on projects, which creates a vacuum for policy and budget strategizing.  \n \n\nTable 2: Progress on Millennium Development Goals \u2013 Regional Comparison \n \n\n1 \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGoal \n\n \n\n \nn\ne\nr\nd\n\nl\ni\n\nh\nc\n \nt\n\ni\n\nh\ng\ne\nw\nr\ne\nd\nn\nU\n\n\u2207  \n\n\u2207  \n\nl\n\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\no\nr\nn\nE\n \ny\nr\na\nm\n\ni\nr\n\nP\n\n \n5\n \ne\nd\na\nr\ng\n \ng\nn\nh\nc\na\ne\nR\n\ni\n\n\u2022   \u0398  \n\u2022   \u0398  \n\n \ny\nt\nr\ne\nv\no\np\n \ny\na\nd\n/\n1\n$\n\n\u2022  \n\n \n\nl\n\n \ne\nt\na\nr\n \nn\no\ni\nt\ne\np\nm\no\nc\n \ny\nr\na\nm\n\ni\nr\n\nP\n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n \ny\nr\na\nd\nn\no\nc\ne\ns\n \nr\ne\nd\nn\ne\nG\n\n \ny\nr\na\nm\n\ni\nr\np\n \nr\ne\nd\nn\ne\nG\n\n \ny\nr\na\ni\nt\nr\ne\nt\n \nr\ne\nd\nn\ne\nG\n\n\u0394  \u0398   \u0398   \u2207   \u2207  \n\u2022   \u0398   \u0394 \n\u2022  \n\u0394 \n\u0394 \n\u2022  \n\n \ny\nt\ni\nl\n\na\nt\nr\no\nm\n \n5\n \nr\ne\nd\nn\nU\n\n\u0394 \n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n \n \ne\nt\na\nr\n \ne\nc\nn\ne\na\nv\ne\nr\np\n \nB\nT\n\nl\n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n \ny\nt\ni\nl\n\na\nt\nr\no\nm\n\n \nt\nn\na\nf\nn\nI\n\nl\n\n \ne\nc\nn\ne\na\nv\ne\nr\np\n \nV\nH\n\nI\n\n\u2022  \n\n\u0394 \n\n\u0394 \n\u0394 \n\u2022   \u2207  \n\u0394 \n\u0394 \n\u2022  \n\u0394 \n\u2022   \u2207  \n\n \ne\nt\na\nr\n \nh\nt\na\ne\nd\n \nB\nT\n\n \nn\na\nb\nr\nu\n \nr\ne\nt\na\nW\n\n \nl\na\nr\nu\nr\n \nr\ne\nt\na\nW\n\n \nn\na\nb\nr\nu\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\nt\ni\nn\na\nS\n\n \nl\na\nr\nu\nr\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\nt\ni\nn\na\nS\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  \n\u2022   \u2207   \u0398   \u0398   \u0398  \n\u2022  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022   \u2207   \u0398   \u0394  \u0398  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u0394 \n\nCambodia \n\n \n\nIndonesia \n\nLao PDR \n\nMalaysia \n\n\u2207   \u0398   \u0394  \u0398   \u0398   \u0394  \u0398   \u0394 \n\u2022   \u0398  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2022  \n\nPhilippines  \u0398   \u0398   \u2207   \u2207  \nThailand \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u0394 \n\n \n\n\u2022  \n\nViet Nam \n\n \n\n\u2022  \n\n\u2207   \u0394  \u2207   \u0398  \n\n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022   \u2207  \n\n\u2022  Early achiever,  \u0394 On track,  \u0398  Slow,  \u2207 No progress/regressing. \nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank/Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific/United Nations Development \nProgramme. 2007. Philippines Midterm Progress Report on the Millennium Development Goals. Manila. \n \n12. \nThe Government has prioritized the education and health sectors for larger shares of the \nnational  Government  budget.  This  will  benefit  rural  schools  and  health  clinics.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  broad  policy  on  allocation  of  expenditures  to  achieve  growth  and  development \nwas to increase and then stabilize social-sector spending at current levels relative to GDP. To \ndate the Government has prioritized social-sector spending over providing significant increases \nin expenditure on economic sectors (agriculture and infrastructure). From Figure 4 (overleaf) it \ncan  be  seen  that  expenditures  on  core  Government  activities  decreased  from  62%  to  45%  of \nthe  executed  state  budget  between  1995  and  2007.  This  may  have  resulted  partially  from \nincreased  expenditures  on  health  (from  4.6%  to  10.51%)  and  on  education  (from  9.1%  to \n14.81%)  over  the  same  period.  Expenditures  on  economic  services,  on  the  other  hand, \nincreased from 10.8% of executed expenditures in 1995 to 16.9% in 2001, before declining to \n7.3%  in  2007.  However,  given  that  rural  poverty  persists,  the  Government  is  now  looking  to \nredress the balance between social- and economic-sector spending. Agriculture in particular will \nbenefit from an increased share of Government investment from 2009. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nA key thrust of the NSDP 2006\u20132010 is to encourage growth in rural areas, in particular \n13. \nin the agriculture sector. Agriculture, which employs 70% of the rural population and accounts \nfor  about  one-third  of  GDP,  remains  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  and  unfavorable  weather \nconditions.  Productivity  in  the  agriculture  sector  is  also  low.  The  NSDP  aims  to  reduce  the \nvulnerability of the agriculture sector and increase agricultural productivity through land reforms \nand expansion of rural credit, among other measures. Improving rural infrastructure will also be \ncritical to reducing rural poverty and income inequality between rural and urban areas. Improved \nrural  infrastructure  will  increase  rural  dwellers'  access  to  services  and  markets  for  goods  and \nservices. However, rural development ministries  will require increased resources to implement \nthese reforms.  \n \n14. \nThe challenge for Cambodia will be to sustain economic growth in the range of 7\u20139% per \nannum, accelerate the creation of productive jobs, and reduce poverty. This will be no easy task \nwith  half  the  population  under  20  years  of  age  and  more  than  85%  of  employment  in  the \ninformal sector (mainly subsistence agriculture), not to mention the relatively high rural poverty \nrate  of  around  39%.  The  Government  recognizes  that  the  key  to  sustaining  high  economic \ngrowth and reducing poverty is to diversify sources of economic growth from its current narrow \nbase  in  construction,  garments,  and  tourism,  which  accounts  for  42% of  non-agriculture  GDP. \nSustaining  high  economic  growth  over  the  long  term  will  require  economic  diversification  and \ncloser  links  between  agriculture  and  service  sectors.  Promoting  economic  diversification  will \nrequire  further  reforms  at  several  levels  of  the  economy,  including:  (i)  reforms  in  agriculture, \ninvestment climate, and trade policy to improve competitiveness at all levels of the supply chain, \nfrom  agriculture  to  the  customs  border  transit  points;  (ii)  increases  in  public  capital  spending, \nespecially  in  rural  areas,  in  agriculture,  and  in  the  energy  sector  (rural  electrification);  and  (iii) \npublic  expenditure  management  reforms  to  align  strategic  objectives  with  budget  outputs  and \nthe medium-term expenditure framework; and to improve budget execution, reporting, efficiency \nand  transparency.  The  Government\u2019s  economic  strategies,  such  as  those  articulated  in  its \nDiagnostic  Trade  Integrated  Strategy,  underline  the  critical  importance  of  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment as the key to economic diversification.  \n \n15. \nDonor-financed  capital  allocations  for  the  rural  sector  are  also  expected  to  scale  up \nresources in the near term, in line with the Government's priority to support the development of \nproductive  sectors  and  further  reduce  rural  poverty  rates.  Rolling  out  PFM  reforms  to  rural \ndevelopment agencies will be crucial to ensuring that priority spending is carried out efficiently \nand  transparently,  and  will  ultimately  lead  to  economic  diversification  and  reduced poverty.  Of \nparticular concern for rural development is the fact that the three line ministries\u2014MAFF, MRD, \nand  MOWRAM\u2014are  not  sufficiently  resourced.  Low  levels  of  funding  and  unskilled  human \nresources  further  exacerbates  public  expenditure  inefficiencies  and  contributes  directly  to  low \nlevels of service delivery in rural areas, which subsequently reduces economic opportunities for \nthe rural poor.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ni\n\nl\n\ni\n\n0\n\nt\ni\n\nI\n \nl\n\n(\n \n.\n\n0.04 \n\n0.084 \n\n0.135 \n\n0.115 \n\n951\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n1026\n\n8000\n\n4000\n\n1994\n\n2004\n\n3770\n\n7067\n\n5501\n\n4367\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n4833\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n2303\n\n7000\n\n1857\n\n2782\n\n0.35\n\n0.25\n\n0.15\n\n0.05\n\n0.04\n\nd\nt\ns\n \ng\nn\ni\nv\ni\nl\n\n \n.\nc\n.\np\nn\na\ne\nm\n\n0.135\n\n0.115\n\n \nt\nn\na\nt\ns\nn\no\nc\n \n,\n\n)\ns\nl\ne\ni\nr\n \n4\n/\n3\n9\n9\n1\n\n0.084 \n\n0.135 \n\n0.084 \n\nRichest\nquintile\n\nPoorest\nquintile\n\nn\no\ni\nt\np\nm\nu\ns\nn\no\nc\n \ny\nl\ni\na\nd\n\n       Rural\u2013urban \n       Inequality within urban areas \n      Inequality with rural areas \n\nFigure 3: Inter and Intra Rural\u2013Urban \nInequality \n \nrural-urban\ninequality within urban areas\ninequality with rural areas\n\n)\nx\ne\n \nd\nn\n \nei\nh\n \nT\n(\nn \n \no\npt\n0.084\nm\n                                 \nu\ns\n \nn\no\nc\n \ny \nai\n \nd\nc.\n \np.\nn \n \ny \nal\n \nu\nq\ne\n \nn\n \n \n \nCSES = Cambodian Socio-Economic Survey,  \nSESC = Socio-Economic Survey of Cambodia. \nSource: SESC 1993/2004 and CSES 2004.  \n\n \nFigure 2: Comparison between Rural and \n \nUrban Living Standards \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCSES = Cambodian Socio-Economic Survey,  \n \nSESC = Socio-Economic Survey of Cambodia. \n \nSource: SESC 1993/2004 and CSES 2004.  \n \n16. \nadopted  PFM  planning tools  to  implement  the NSDP.

In \norder  to  meet  the  objectives  for  rural  development  outlined  in  the  NSDP,  these  sectors  will \nrequire  (i)  sustained  funding  from  external  sources,  including  budget  support  proposed  under \nthis  program; 6  (ii)  an  increase  in  resource  mobilization  efforts  of  the  Government;  and  (iii) \nconsideration by the Government of a feasible reallocation of expenditures into agriculture and \nrural  infrastructure.  The  Government  and  development  partners  need  to  increase  support  for \nrural  infrastructure,  agricultural  extension,  and  credit  and  marketing  initiatives,  as  nearly  three \nquarters  of  the  population  continue  to  depend  on  subsistence  agriculture.  The  proposed \nProgram,  structured  as  a  program  cluster,  aims  to  help  the  Government  achieve  its  medium-\nterm goals of sustained economic growth in the range of 7\u20139% per annum, rural development, \nand poverty reduction through improved governance in public expenditure management at the \nthree  key  ministries  dealing  with  rural  development.  Reforms  leading  to  effective  budget \nexecution through timely release of funds to pro-poor sectors will improve expenditure targeting \nfor the rural population and increase value for money from spending of scarce resources. At the \nsame  time,  a  strengthened  PFM  system  enhances  accountability  of  service  providers  to \ntargeted beneficiaries by rationalizing expenditure policy, and improves financial accountability \nby reducing fiduciary risks to public funds. \n\nIV. \n\nISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n\n18. \nNotwithstanding the Government\u2019s commitment, implementation of the NSDP objectives \nto support rural development is constrained by (i) Cambodia\u2019s weak PFM system, (ii) capacity \nand resource constraints in the MEF, which hinder rollout of the full PFMRP to line ministries, \nincluding the rural development ministries, (iii) limited human resource capacity in line ministries \nto manage and deliver services, (iv) scarcity of resources available to implement policy priorities, \nand (iv) governance challenges that undermine the effectiveness of the budget as an instrument \nto  affect  rural  poverty.  The  rollout  of  ongoing  PFM  reforms  to  the  three  rural  development \nministries is, therefore, critical to NSDP objectives. In the three rural development  ministries it \nwill be important to build commensurate capacity by rolling out the training program and other \nmeasures  designed  under  the  PFMRP  on  a  priority  basis.  As  such,  involvement  of  rural \ndevelopment  ministries  and  a  sense  of  ownership  of  the  PFMRP  by  these  ministries  is  a \nprerequisite for the realization of an effective system-wide PFM structure in Cambodia\u2014that is, \na  PFM  system  that  can  deliver  efficient  public  sector-funded  outcomes.  In  addition  to  the \nfollowing discussion, Appendix 5 analyses in detail the underlying issues. \n \nPFM  Policy  Framework.  A  strong  PFM  system  leads  to  aggregate  control  of  budget \n19. \nresources,  prioritization,  accountability,  and  efficiency  in  the  management  of  public  resources \nand delivery of services, all of which are critical to the achievement of public policy objectives, \nincluding  the  MDGs.  Effective  PFM  systems  are  also  critical  for  ensuring  the  effectiveness  of \ndonor financial assistance, since aid is increasingly provided through modalities that make use \nof  national  PFM  systems.  They  are  also  required  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  rural \ndevelopment and economic growth in the long term. Effective PFM systems moderate fiduciary \nrisks  by  increasing  transparency  and  thereby  reducing  the  scope  for  irregularities.  However, \nbudget  control  effectiveness  could  still  be  limited  by  other  factors,  such  as  a  weak  legal  and \nregulatory framework or human resource capacity constraints.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6 Cambodia currently receives around 10% of its external assistance in budget support which is fungible to support all \n\nsectors of the state budget, dependant on the policy priorities of the Government.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nIn an effort to establish an effective and efficient PFM system, the Government instituted \n20. \nthe multi-stage PFMRP to reform Cambodia\u2019s PFM system, in December 2004. With a 10-year \nplanning  and  implementation  horizon,  the  PFMRP  is  being  supported  through  a  sector-wide \napproach with financing from a number of development partners, primarily through a multi-donor \ntrust  fund.7 However,  other  donors,  such  as  ADB,  will  be  supporting  the  sector-wide  approach \nthrough  a  proposed  budget  support  grant  to  Cambodia  to  strengthen  rural  PFM  systems.  The \nfirst  stage  of  the  PFMRP,  platform  1,  was  completed  in  2007.  Platform  1  was  rolled  out  to \nimprove  budget  credibility  and  the  day-to-day  management  of  public  resources  by  delivering \nreliable  and  predictable  resources  to  individual  managers.  Activities  undertaken  included \nimproving budget formulation and execution; improving sustainability of the budget; developing \na  revenue  strategy;  improving  the  macroeconomic  framework;    developing  debt-management \ntools and streamlining the ability of budget entities to spend in line with their budget approvals; \nstreamlining  the  resource  commitment  and  payment  process,  including  outsourcing  of  MEF \nfinancial  controllers  to  selected  line  ministries;  reforming  the  procurement  processes  of  line \nministries; increasing use of the banking system and reducing the use of cash for Government \ntransactions; commencing the consolidation of Government bank accounts into a treasury single \naccount; and eliminating arrears.  \n\n \n\n21. \nFor  the  second  stage  of  the  program,  the  Government,  with  assistance  from \ndevelopment  partners,  has  prepared  'platform  2'  for  implementation  between  late  2008  and \n2011.  The  goal  of  platform  2  is  to  improve  financial  management  accountability  so  that  civil \nservants at all levels feel responsible for how they manage and control public finances. Building \ninternal  audit  capacity  has  been  identified  as  a  key  objective  of  the  PFMRP  toward  achieving \nthis  goal.  An  effective  internal  audit  function  will  ensure  that  (i)  adequate  control  systems  are \nestablished so that assets are safeguarded; (ii) financial reports are reliable; (iii) laws, policies, \nand  procedures  are  complied  with;  (iv)  resources  are  used  efficiently;  (v)  and  the  overall \nobjectives  of  the  spending  entity  are  achieved.  Internal  audit  units  face  the  challenge  of \nensuring that capacity is built so that they can deliver a professional service.  \n \n22. \nThe  Government  is  fully  aware  that  substantial  improvements  in  public  services  will \nrequire  more  realistic  budgets  and  better  allocation  of  resources.  First,  Cambodia  will  have  to \nimprove  resource  mobilization  to  ensure  aggregate  fiscal  sustainability.  Despite  the  need  for \nhigher  revenues  to  finance  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  Cambodia\u2019s  fiscal  revenue  ratios, \nespecially  tax  revenue,  remain  among  the  lowest  in  the  world.  Cambodia\u2019s  total-revenue-to-\nGDP ratio stood at 11.3% in 2007. Without significant increases in revenues, there are risks to \nboth  medium-term  macroecomic  sustainability  and  to  implementation  of  the  NSDP.  To  reduce \nthe risk of debt distress and finance higher levels of public spending, revenues will have to be \ngreatly increased. In addition, under PFMRP, issues concerning debt servicing and the cost of \ndebt  servicing  will  be  addressed  within  the  context  of  the  budget.  The  priority  must  be  to \nminimize  long-term  financing  costs  while  maintaining  prudent  risk  levels.  This  will  require  a \n\n                                                 \n7   The  sector-wide  approach  has  established  joint  reform  objectives,  an  agreed  reform  vision  and  strategy,  agreed \npartnership  principles  and  coordinated  funding  and  support  arrangements  between  development  partners  (DPS), \nwhich  provides  financial  support  for  the  implementation  of  PFMRP.  Currently  13  development  partners  are \ncoordinating  their  assistance  and  the  program  is  cofinanced  by  a  multidonor  trust  fund  supported  by  four \ndevelopment  partners  (Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  [AusAID],  Department  for  International \nDevelopment, [DFID], European Union [EU], and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency [SIDA], \nand a grant from the World Bank. Total funding is equivalent to approximately $32 million, of which the Government \nexecutes some $30 million for the 5 years 2005\u20132010. Some development partners also support PFMRP through \nadditional TA-based bilateral support.

There  is  virtually  no  domestic  debt  (including \ntreasury bills) and no external commercial borrowing. The debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 31% \nin  2006  to  29.4%  in  2007  primarily  because  of  economic  growth.  However,  the  Government \nanticipates  that,  over  the  longer  term,  a  more  complicated  debt  structure  will  evolve  as  the \neconomy develops and begins to raise finances from other sources beyond official development \nassistance (ODA) Going forward, strengthening capacity at the debt management office (DMO) \nwill  require  a  functioning  middle  office,  capacity  building  of  staff  in  producing  a  debt-\nmanagement  strategy  and  starting  regular  debt  reporting,  and  drafting  decrees  in  the  area  of \npublic  debt  management  to  establish  a  clear  set  of  rules,  responsibilities,  and  obligations  in \npublic debt management.  \nSupport to rural development ministries.   \n24. \nPFM  Reforms  Priority:  Support  to  Rural  Development  Ministries.  Platform  1,  of \nnecessity,  placed  heavy  emphasis  on  building  capacity  first  in  MEF  by  internally  restructuring \nthe  ministry  and  introducing  a  merit-based  pay  initiative  (MBPI)  to  provide  incentives  to  civil \nservants to facilitate the reform process. For the second stage, PFMRP rollout to line ministries \nis a primary priority. Line ministries will receive support from core advisors in different areas of \nspecialization from MEF and from the training and skill development programs developed by the \nEconomic  and  Finance  Institute  (EFI).  Much  of  this  training  will  be  funded  through  the  multi-\ndonor  trust  fund.  In  association,  ADB  will  design  a  project  to  support  MAFF,  MRD,  and \nMOWRAM in implementation of the PFMRP to address current weaknesses in PFM, as these \nthree ministries supporting rural development remain constrained by PFM weaknesses. These \nweaknesses  must  be  addressed  urgently  so  that  these  ministries  will  be  capable  of  more \nefficient management and of increasing service delivery in rural areas. Increasing the quality of \nPFM systems in these ministries is a policy priority for the Government, and also for ADB, which \ncurrently provides sizeable investment resources to the rural development sector that includes \nagriculture  and  natural  resources  sector.9 The  key  areas  of  weakness  related  to  PFM  in  the \nthree line ministries targeted under the PFMRDP are as follows: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\nThere  is  a  limited  link  between  annual  expenditure  planning  and  medium-term \nplanning and financing in MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM. Whereas the health and \neducation  sectors  have  relatively  strong  budget  planning  frameworks,  the  rural \ndevelopment  ministries  are  still  in  the  early  stages  of  developing  links  between \ntheir  policies,  programs,  and  the  budget  process.  Moreover,  weak  coordination \nbetween  the  three  ministries  in  the  area  of  rural  development  policy  has  led  to \nexamples  of  program  duplication  in  the  past,  a  weakness  that  could  be \n\n                                                 \n8  The Government requested that ADB anchor this component of PFMRP within the PFMRDP in view of ADB\u2019s past \n\ntechnical assistance that supported public debt management reforms and this will involve working with MEF. \n\n9  From the resumption of ADB operations in 1993 to the end of 2007, ADB had supported the agriculture and natural \nresources sector with a total approved amount of $125.5 million (five loans, one grant project, and 25 TAs). At the \nend  of  2007,  continuing  loans  and  grants  (three  project  loans,  one  program  loan,  and  one  project  grant)  for \nagriculture and natural resources aggregated $83.59 million or 15.9% of ADB\u2019s active portfolio in Cambodia. Also, \nin late 2007, there were nine active TA portfolios in the agriculture and natural resources sector for a total value of \n$7.05 million.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nintroduction \n\naddressed  if  planning  processes  were  better  coordinated  between  the  three \nministries. \nBudget  planning  exercises  produce  unrealistic  budget  estimations,  which \nfrequently  do  not  have  identified  sources  of  funding,  and  ultimately  lead  to \nunderfunded  service  delivery  outcomes.  There  is  also  a  limited  link  between \nmedium-term  planning,  annual  expenditure  planning  and  financing  needs  and \nactual budget allocations in MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM. \nThe  agriculture,  water,  and  rural  development  ministries  currently  rely  on  an \nincremental  approach  to  budget  preparation,  and  as  such  annual  budget \npreparation  is  largely  based  on  the  previous  year\u2019s  expenditure  patterns  rather \nthan on budgeted costs for planned sector activities, projects, and programs as \nestablished under sector planning exercises at the beginning of the budget cycle. \nThe  budget  execution  process  is  delinked  from  the  actual  budget  proposal \nprepared  by  rural  ministries  for  the  capital  budget.  However,  this  should  be \npartially  overcome  in  the  future  through  the  implementation  of  the  budget \nstrategic plan (BSP).10 Budget execution and accounting have been improved by \nline  ministries  of  new  economic  and  administrative \nthe \nclassifications.11 The  budget  classification  system  is  being  extended  further  to \ninclude a standardized functional and program classification from 2009. \nProcurement  processes  lack  effective  control  mechanisms.  Although  some \nprogress in legislation has been made, changes on the ground have been limited. \nThere  is  an  inadequate  regulatory  framework  at  the  central  level  to  monitor \nprocurement practices and this situation is mirrored in sector ministries. An ADB \nAssessment  of  MRD  conducted  in  May\u2013June  2007  found  that  MRD\u2019s  financial \nand  accountability  systems  needed  urgent  strengthening.  Significant \nprocurement  risks  for  donor-assisted  projects  were  also  identified.  The  ADB \n(Office  of  the  Auditor  General)  findings  on  NRDP  raised  concerns  across  the \nboard  (works,  goods,  services,  running  costs). 12 Over  the  years,  lessons  from \nongoing  projects  also  underlined  major  weaknesses  in  internal  control  and \nprocurement practices.13  \nInternal audit departments in MOWRAM and MAFF were established in 2007 and \nin  MRD  in  2008.  However,  the  capacity  for  effective  internal  audit  in  line \nministries  remains  low,  and  extensive  training  will  be  provided  to  MAFF, \nMOWRAM, and MRD under the program to improve their capacity to undertake \neffective internal audit evaluations. \n\nin \n\n \nGovernance Indicators. The weaknesses identified above pose significant governance \n25. \nrisks  and  need  to  be  addressed  urgently  through  the  rollout  of  PFM  reforms  to  the  three \nministries.

Weak governance is the foremost \nchallenge  that  contributes  to  failures  in  service  delivery  to  the  poor.  In  a  broader  context,  it  is \nalso the most fundamental constraint to improving the weak investment climate and diversifying \nthe economy. In a regional comparative perspective, Cambodia has not performed well in five \nout  of  six  World  Bank  Governance  Indicators  (Table  3).  Improvements  are  being  made, \nespecially  in  PFM  reform.  The  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth,  Employment,  Equity  and \nEfficiency, 14 adopted  by  the  Government  of  Cambodia,  describes  governance  as  the  \u201cmost \nimportant  precondition  to  economic  development\u201d  in  Cambodia. In  2001,  the  Government \napproved a Governance Action Plan (GAP I) to promote multi- and cross-sectoral governance \nreforms. On the basis of that experience, GAP II was formulated in 2005. The National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan (NSDP) 2006\u2013201015 outlines a clear set of measurable and prioritized goals \nfor  achievements  of  the  governance  objectives  embodied  in  the  Rectangular  Strategy. \nCambodia\u2019s  decision  to  join  the  ADB-OECD  Anti-Corruption  Initiative and  Action  Plan  for  Asia \nand  the  Pacific  in  200316 is  demonstrable  evidence  of  its  resolve  to  further  the  governance \nagenda.  \n \n\nTable 3: Governance Indicators in 2007 \u2013 Regional Comparison \n(Percentile ranking)a \n \n\n \nCountry \nPhilippines \nIndonesia  \nMalaysia  \nThailand  \nViet Nam  \nCambodia \nLao PDR \n\nVoice and \nAccountability \n43.3 \n42.8 \n31.3 \n29.8 \n  6.7 \n24.0 \n  6.3 \n\nPolitical \nStability \n10.1 \n14.9 \n52.4 \n16.8 \n56.3 \n28.8 \n42.8 \n\nGovernment \nEffectiveness \n56.4 \n41.7 \n82.9 \n61.6 \n41.2 \n20.9 \n21.3 \n\nRegulatory \nQuality \n50.5 \n43.7 \n67.0 \n56.3 \n35.9 \n30.6 \n15.0 \n\nRule of \nLaw \n33.8 \n27.1 \n65.2 \n52.9 \n38.6 \n13.8 \n17.1 \n\nControl of \nCorruption \n22.2 \n27.1 \n62.3 \n44.0 \n28.0 \n  8.2 \n13.0 \n\nPDR =  People\u2019s Democratic Republic \na  Note: 2007 data the latest.

Governance Matters 2008: Worldwide Governance Indicators. Washington, DC. \n \n26. \nCapacity  Development  in  PFM  in  MAFF,  MRD,  and  MOWRAM.  The  Government \nrecognizes the challenge of rolling out PFM reforms to the rural development ministries. Yet the \ncapacity of the Government to address these issues is severely constrained by the scarcity of \nqualified finance specialists and line managers. The EFI of MEF has prepared a PFM capacity \ndevelopment plan covering a wide range of training and personnel development activities to be \nundertaken during PFMRP Platform 2. MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD staff will participate fully in \nthese  activities,  with  training  to  be  provided  by  the  EFI.  In  addition,  EFI  will  support  capacity \ndevelopment measures under an ongoing ADB regional TA.17 However, it is widely recognized \nthat other capacity-building initiatives will be required to supplement EFI training in order to build \nenduring PFM capacity in rural development ministries. The fundamental lesson that emerged \nfrom  an  institutional  assessment  of  the  PFM  capacity  in  these  three  ministries  (undertaken \nunder ADB Technical Assistance for Preparing the Strengthening of PFMRDP Project, 2008)18 \nis that capacity development is critical to rolling out PFM to these rural development ministries. \n\n                                                 \n14  RGC. 2004.

In the long-term, this will build stronger \ncountry  systems  to  enable  a  phased  reduction  in  the  number  of  ring-fenced  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  established  for  externally  assisted  projects  in  these  three \nministries.19 On  internal  audit,  the  report  noted  that  support  to  strengthen  the  internal  audit \nfunction in the three priority ministries will be crucial to improving accountability in the delivery of \nservices to rural recipients. Establishing procedures for senior management within the ministries \nto take effective action to implement internal audit recommendations will also be important.20 In \nview  of  this,  the  capacity  development  envisaged  under  the  proposed  project  assistance  will \nsupplement  the  centralized  efforts  of  EFI  and  the  Public  Policy  Training  Program  under  the \nregional  TA.  The  Government  and  ADB  are  also  aware  that  capacity  building  will  require \nsufficient  incentives  to  motivate  government  employees  and  ensure  their  commitments  to  the \nreform  programs.  Presently,  these  issues  are  duly  addressed  by  the  Government  under  the \nbroader  Cambodian  public  administration  reform  program.21 In  addition  the  establishment  of  a \nlonger-term  view  on  civil  service  salary  reform  can  help  address  the  current  incentive \nweaknesses in the three line ministries.  \n \n27. \nDecentralized Service Delivery. Following the Commune Council elections in February \n2002, the Government has engaged in a broad range of decentralization initiatives. An organic \nlaw on administrative arrangements for subnational level of Government was passed in March \n2008  and  a  subnational  financial law  drafted  by  MEF.  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  will  assist \nthe  Ministry  of  Interior  and  MEF  in  planning  for  the  assignment  or  delegation  of  roles  and \nresponsibilities for service delivery to provinces and districts. MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD will \nalso  be  involved  in  implementing  new  financial  arrangements,  including  assigned  and  shared \nrevenues and fiscal grants for subnational administrations. \n \n28. \nOnce  the  Government  has  determined  and  found  support  for  the  framework  for  fiscal \ndecentralization, assistance will be required to (i) strengthen decentralization capacity building, \n(ii)  strengthen  overall  PFM  control  and  fiscal  decentralization  structure,  and  (iii)  increase  local \nrevenue generation and improve local service delivery. In this context, there will be a need for \ncapacity  building  and  strengthening  institutions  at  subnational  levels  in  Cambodia.  Specific \nattention will be required in progressively improving capacity of MRD, MAFF, and MOWRAM to \nsupport fiscal decentralization in the near term outside the central ministries. The Government \nwill  need  to  accelerate  complementary  reforms  so  that  laws  are  not  just  enacted,  but  actually \nimplemented and enforced. \n\n \nStrengthening  External  Audit  and  Accountability  Mechanisms.  Improved  external \n29. \naccountability,  achieved  through  strengthening  the  NAA,  will  play  a  critical  role  in  improving \nfinancial  governance  and  in  detecting  and  reporting  incidences  of  misuse  of  resources  and \nfinancial  irregularities  in  the  public  sector.  The  NAA  was  established  in  2000  as  an  external, \nindependent  pillar  of  accountability.  ADB  was  instrumental  in  preparing  the  audit  law  and \nestablishing the NAA in Cambodia as the supreme audit institution (SAI) of Cambodia. SAIs are \na  pivotal  part  of  the  public  expenditure  management  processes.  SAIs  help  ensure  strong \ncommitments  to  poverty  reduction  and  service  delivery  through  the  budgetary  process,  as \n\n                                                 \n19 PIUs  follow  the  procurement  and  financial  management  procedures  of  donor  agencies  instead  of  the  national \n\nsystems to minimize fiduciary risks to project implementation. \n\n20 Internal  auditing  is  in  the  early  stages  of  development  in  Cambodia.  The  Law  on  Auditing  of  2000  requires  each \nministry  and  state  enterprise  to  establish  an  internal  auditing  department.  An  internal  auditing  subdecree  was \npassed in 2005 and 23 of the 35 budget-funded agencies have established an internal auditing department. \n\n21 Cambodia\u2019s civil service is not adequately compensated; salary is very low and often is an outright disincentive for \n\nefficient performance and outcome. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\nthey have a mandate to audit resources channeled through the national budget system. As an \nincreasing amount of development assistance is provided as budget support, an effective SAI \nhas dual accountability both towards citizens and donors. However, in Cambodia NAA has not \nperformed  effectively  as  an  independent  pillar  of  governance  and  accountability  because  of \nsignificant  capacity  constraints  and  a  shortage  of  auditors.  Capacity  development  for  NAA  to \neffectively  undertake  financial  and  subsequently  value-for-money  audit  should  be  long-term. \nBesides, NAA has a role in overseeing internal auditing processes in the line ministries. There \nare  no  substantial  or  formalized  interactions  so  far  between  the  NAA  and  the  newly \nestablished  internal  audit  offices  within  the  line  ministries.  Within  the  ambit  of  the  Audit  Law \n2000, NAA will support effective internal auditing, following international best practices.  \n \nLessons \n \n30. \nOwnership  and  capacity  building  are  the  themes  that  have  underpinned  ADB \ngovernance-reform assistance and public expenditure management assistance over the years. \nThey are the same themes that will inform the design of the proposed Program. In Cambodia\u2019s \ninstitutional  and  political  reform  context,  donor  coordination  is  necessary  for  successful \nimplementation.  An  important  lesson  learned  from  previous  PFM  interventions  in  Cambodia  is \nthat  introducing  complex  PFM  reforms  in  a  capacity-constrained  environment  such  as \nCambodia  requires  a  step-by-step  approach  to  reform.  Another  lesson  is  that  introducing  the \nbroader  institutional  and  organizational  changes  needed  for  certain  technical  PFM  reforms  to \nwork  requires  high-level  Government  commitment  and  engagement  with  the  reform  program. \nThe stage-by-stage approach being used for the PFM reform program allows PFM changes to \nbe introduced gradually, while complementary capacity and skills development will feature as a \nkey  component  of  the  final  PFM  reform  program.  The  key  lesson  is  that  it  is  necessary  to \nengage  for  a  longer  period  of  time  and  to  respond  flexibly  to  changes  in  priorities  during \nimplementation. Resident PFM consultants or peripatetic advisers that are actively advising or \nproviding hands-on assistance will help ensure that priority reforms are implemented. \n \n31. \nLessons from two ADB studies (by the Operations Evaluation Department) also suggest \nthat (i) policy reforms involving passage of legislation need sufficient time to allow for consensus \nbuilding  and  explanation  to  stakeholders,  so  delays  in  the  achievement  of  some  expected \noutcomes are likely; (ii) technical assistance for capacity development to institutionalized skills \ntransfer; (iii) it is necessary to pursue governance issues not only at the project/program level, \nbut also at the level of donors\u2019 collective policy dialogue to ensure Government commitment to \naddressing widespread corruption; (iv) support for capacity development should focus not only \non institutionalizing skills transfer, with a clear exit strategy, but also on improving organizational \nmanagement  and  budgeting  systems;  and  (v)  the  existing  deterrence  factor  in  terms  of  low \npublic salary structure tends to deter some expected outcomes by reducing the retention and/or \nutilization  of  trained  staff.22 These  studies  also  suggest  that  it  takes  time  to  fully  integrate  the \nmedium-term expenditure framework into the annual budget cycles.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n \nObjectives  and  Scope.  The  program\u2019s  objective  is  to  assist  in  implementing  the \n32. \nPFMRP,  particularly  in  the  three  rural  development  ministries.  To  achieve  these  objectives \nwithin the ongoing PFM reform program, the program will support Government reforms in three \n\n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2004 Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Cambodia.

The PFMRDP will target (i) the capacity development needs of \nMAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD in the areas of budget planning, budget preparation and execution, \nprocurement,  and  internal  audit  with  the  goal  of  ensuring  better  service  delivery  to  rural \ncommunities;  and  (ii)  the  capacity  development  needs  of  the  NAA  to  improve  the  overall \ngovernance  framework  of  the  Cambodian  public  sector.  Overall,  the  objective  is  to  strengthen \nfinancial  governance  and  public  expenditure  efficiency  as  an  enabling  condition  for  poverty \nreduction. Besides, the objective is also to strengthen external auditing capacity to improve the \neffectiveness  of  NAA  as  a  pillar  of  accountability  in  Cambodia,  as  highlighted  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter addressed to the President of ADB (Appendix 2).  \n \nADB\u2019s  Contribution  to  Subprogram  1  Core  Policy  Actions.  ADB  has  contributed \n33. \nsignificantly  since  2005  to  strengthening  PFM  in  Cambodia.  ADB  assisted  the  Government  in \n2004 and 2005 with the following: (i) setting up an internal audit function, initially in MEF; and (ii) \nstrengthening  the  institutional  structure  of  the  NAA  (through  TA  for  Strengthening  Public \nFinancial  Management). 23  Also,  the  project  assisted  MEF  with  establishing  a  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  and  improving  its  macroeconomic  forecasting  capability.  ADB  also \nsupported  MEF  to  establish  a  debt  management  function  (under  TA  for  Support  to  Public \nFinancial Management Program).24 A monitoring and evaluation framework has been prepared, \nand MAFF has been employing the new monitoring procedure since 2007 to keep track of the \nperformance  of  five  of  its  programs.  This  has  contributed  to  increased  accountability  and \nimproved service delivery within MAFF (ADB 2004/05, TA for Strengthening National Program \nBudgeting  for  the  Agriculture  Sector). 25 An  ADB  TA  (Preparing  the  Strengthening  of  Public \nFinancial  Management  for  Rural  Development  Project)26 has  made  detailed  recommendations \non  training  for  MAFF,  MRD,  MOWRAM,  and  NAA  to  provide  the  basis  for  institutional  and \ncapacity development in PFM in rural development ministries. \n \nProgram Cluster Modality. The proposed Program comprises a grant component of $6.71 \n34. \nmillion  for  subprogram  1.  The  second  subprogram  of  the  overall  cluster  is  currently  estimated  at \n$15.0 million. Structured in two sequential subprograms under the program cluster modality with two \nsingle  tranche  operations  (subprogram  1:  June  2006\u2013December  2008;  subprogram  2:  January \n2009\u2013December 2010), the Program is anchored in a coherent, medium-term framework specified at \nthe  outset,  including  completed  reforms  prior  to  Board  consideration  under  subprogram  1;  and  (ii) \nexpected  triggers  for  subprogram  2  to  facilitate  a  continuous  dialogue  with  the  Government. \nSubprogram 2 will be further refined during a subprogram impact review to allow flexibility to adjust \nthe  Program  based  on  progress  made  and  changes  in  the  external  environment.  This  does  not \nobligate  ADB  to  provide  an  additional  grant  for  subprogram  2,  which  will  be  subject  to  Board \napproval. It is expected that subprogram 2 will be submitted to the ADB Board for consideration in \n2010 upon completion of the key triggers. Appendix 3 presents the proposed policy matrix for the \ncluster program. It details the policy actions for subprogram 1 and policy triggers and milestones \nfor subprogram 2.  \n\n                                                 \n23  ADB.  2001.

It  provides  a  legal  framework  for  the  stage-by-stage  implementation  of \nPFMRP to improve Cambodia\u2019s PFM system, with the goal of bringing it in line with international \nstandards.  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  all  established  their  PFM  working  groups  and \ncommenced  PFM  reform  planning  by  the  end  of  June  2008.  These  working  groups  have \nbecome  the  focal  points  for  accelerating  PFM  reforms  in  these  ministries.  Thus,  a  key \nrequirement under subprogram 1 that all ministries establish PFM working groups to plan and \nimplement their ministries\u2019 involvement in PFMRP stage 2 already has significant momentum. \n \n36. \nOne major activity has been streamlining the ability of line agencies to spend in line with \ntheir budget provisions. To that end, MEF has decentralized procurement to spending agencies \nunder  a  new  procurement  decree  and  prakas  and  implemented  annual  procurement  plans.28 \nWithin  certain  monetary  thresholds,  ministries  are  now  free  to  make  their  own  procurement \ndecisions  without  prior  MEF  approval.  In  preparation  for  further  procurement  reforms,  the \nprogram  has  considered  the  preparation  of  terms  of  reference  for  a  procurement  auditing \nfunction to be established in MEF\u2019s department of public procurement. \n\n \n\n37. \nThe  budget  execution  rate  is  being  improved  and  fiduciary  risks  reduced  through \nincreased  use  of  the  banking  system  (rather  than  cash)  for  Government  transactions. \nImprovements  in  cash  management  have  been  made,  including  further  consolidation  of \nGovernment  bank  accounts  and  streamlining  of  Government  expenditure  commitments  and \npayments processes. Budget preparation and budget execution are being improved through the \nintroduction  of  new  economic  and  administrative  classifications  in  the  chart  of  accounts  and \nbudget classification, commencing  in 2007. Fiscal transparency is being improved  through the \npublication of an annual budget summary. Further transparency reforms are planned, including \npublication of an annual budget document, in-year budget execution reports, and public release \nof  audited  public  financial  accounts  after  they  have  been  submitted  to  the  National  Assembly. \nThe Annual Finance Law for 2008 includes a budget summary of total revenues, the budgets for \nrecurrent  expenditures,  including  the  Public  Investment  Program  (PIP)  project  lines  for  capital \nexpenditure, as an initial step towards budget integration.  \n \nRevised  MBPI  Subdecree  29,  which  provides  a  framework  for  all  ministries  to  provide \n38. \nincentives  to  civil  servants  for  improved  performance  and  to  participate  in  the  PFM  reform \nprogram, was approved by the Prime Minister in April 2008.29 The Government plans to expand \nthe MBPI scheme to encompass a broader range of recipients from the line ministries. Initially \n\n                                                 \n27 Subprograms  1  and  2  have  drawn  upon  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  inputs  and \nfor  Rural \n\nthe  Strengthening  of  Public  Financial  Management \n\nrecommendations  (4988-CAM:  Preparing \nDevelopment Project). \n\n28 Prakas  are  ministerial  or  inter-ministerial  regulations  that  are  used,  like  Sub-Decrees,  to  implement  and  clarify \nspecific provisions within higher-level legislative documents. They are also often used for the creation of guidelines \nthat are necessary for the implementation of Laws or Sub-Decrees. \n\n29 The MBPI was initially piloted in MEF in 2005. The essence of the MBPI is to introduce into the civil service higher \npay coupled with meritocratic selection and performance management on a sustainable basis to support agencies\u2019 \nmissions.  MBPI  is  anchored  in  official  Government  pay  policy  (Subdecree  98),  supported  by  a  specific \nmemorandum  of  understanding  for  the  management  of  MBPI  from  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund.  Management  of \nMBPI is based on MBPI Manual developed by MEF (and endorsed by development partners). MBPI is supervised \nby MEF\u2019s Reform Committee\u2019s Incentives and Recruitment Subcommittee.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nthe scheme will target representatives of the PFM working groups entrusted with implementing \nPFMRP in the ministries. \n \n39. \nThe  Debt  Management  Office  within  the  MEF,  set  up  with  ADB  TA,  is  fully  operational \nand  integrated  with  other  departments  within  MEF  responsible  for  macroeconomic  policy  and \nbudgets.  Under  the  ADB  TA,  the  MEF  strengthened  the  Debt  Management  Office  (DMO)  by \nproducing  a  model  debt  management  strategy  and  made  recommendations  on  improving  the \nlegal  framework  for  public  debt  management.  Core  recommendations  were  included  in  the \nrevised Public Financial System Law promulgated in May 2008. The Debt Management Office \ninstalled  a  debt  management  and  financial  analysis  system,  and  prepared  standard  operating \nprocedures (SOPs), including a debt management manual. In addition, under the ADB TA, debt \nmanagement  capacity  was  strengthened  to  enhance  budget  resource  mobilization  and  to \nimprove budget sustainability.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Strengthened Financial Management in the Rural Sector \n\n \nSignificant  progress  has  been  made  in  PFM  reform  in  the  rural  ministries  (MAFF, \n40. \nMOWRAM,  and  MRD)  during  the PFMRDP  implementation  period. Budget  planning  has  been \nimproved through the introduction of budget strategic plans (BSPs), which link preparation of the \nbudget to ministries\u2019 strategic goals at a number of pilot ministries, including MAFF and MRD. \nThe  BSP  has  been  used  as  an  instrument  to  integrate  the  current,  capital,  and  development \npartner\u2019s budgets. BSPs improve budget integration and comprehensiveness. All line ministries \nare  required  to  prepare  and  submit  their  BSPs  to  MEF  in  mid-May  each  year.  BSPs  form  the \nbasis  for  budget  estimates  and  help  link  policy  to  budget  allocation.  A BSP  is  a  bottom-up,  3-\nyear budget plan that includes both capital and recurrent budgets. The three rural development \nministries have been preparing BSPs since 2007.   \n \n41. \nPlanning  for  a  Government-wide  financial  management  information  system  (FMIS)  has \nprogressed  in  platform  1.  MAFF  and  MRD  are  piloting  FMIS  action  plans,  which  will  be \nintroduced in several other ministries and provincial treasuries from 2010. The FMIS is expected \nto significantly improve the efficiency of budget execution and budget reporting. The PFMRDP \nwill supplement MEF capacity development efforts and will facilitate client-side capacity building \nin  the  areas  of  budget  accounting,  budget  classification,  and  Information  Technology  (IT) \nsystems. Capacity building will be implemented in phases and will target senior-level, technical, \nand operational-level MAFF staff. Specialist training will be provided where required. \n\n \n\nThe  Memorandum  of  Understanding  between  the  Government  and  the  ADB  signed  in \n42. \nApril  2007  concluded  that  the  overall  performance  of  ADB\u2019s  finance  portfolio  is  in  need  of \nimprovement.  Since  2003,  annual  contract  awards  and  disbursement  achievements  have \nremained  significantly  below  annual  projections.  The  majority  of  ongoing  projects  is  behind \nschedule and will likely need to be extended. The slow pace of project implementation increases \nthe  Government\u2019s  costs  and  delays  the  realization  of  project  benefits.  In  light  of  these  delays, \nwhich  have  added  to  the  governance  challenges  in  Cambodia,  all  national  programs  and \nprojects for Cambodia, including those of MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM, are required to prepare \nand comply with good governance frameworks (GGFs). Further, the ADB-financed projects for \nCambodia  have \nthe  standard  ADB \nrequirements\u2014to deter corruption and increase transparency. First, ADB-financed projects now \nincorporate  disclosure  and  grievance  redress  measures,  including  (i)  a  project  website  to \ndisclose information about procurement and other project activities, and (ii) a grievance redress \nmechanism  to  encourage  more  stakeholder  vigilance  and  ensure  greater  accountability.  The \ngovernment  has  signed  the  GGF  in  respect  to  ADB-financed  projects  in  2007  (Tonle  Sap \n\nincorporated  several  requirements\u2014in  addition \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\nLowland Rural Development Project, Enhancing Education Quality Project and Financial Sector \nProgram  II  cluster).  A  website  is  being  set  up  in  MOWRAM  (this  is  near  completion).  The \nPFMRDP  will  complement  ongoing  efforts  under  PFMRP  to  establish  a  Government-wide \nprocurement website. \n \n43. \nFor ADB- and World Bank-assisted projects, Cambodia has adopted a variety of project- \nand/or  program-level  mitigation  measures,  including  the  application  of  Government  SOPs  and \nprocurement  manuals  in  the  administration  of programs  and  projects (Supported  under  TA  for \nHarmonizing  Loan  Project  Implementation  Procedures). 30  For  externally  aided  loans  and \nprojects, MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD are adopting these measures and will be applying them \nto the execution of all ADB funded projects and programs. Compliance with these procedures \nwill  strengthen  efforts  to  promote  responsibility  for  procurement  planning  and  processing,  and \nwill  constitute  a  major  step  in  achieving  the  harmonization  envisaged  in  the  2005  Paris \nDeclaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness. 31 The  proposed  ADB  project  under  PFMRDP  will  provide \ntraining  and  continuous  mentor  support  to  the  project  management  units  to  comply  with   \nprocurement manuals and consistently observe the SOPs in project implementation. \n  \n44. \nInternal  auditing,  which  is  necessary  for  efficient  management  control  and  reduction  of \nfiduciary  risks  is  in  the  early  stages  of  introduction  in  Cambodia.  MAFF,  MRD  and  MOWRAM \nhave established internal audit departments. The internal audit department (IAD) is mandated to \nundertake financial and compliance audits. In addition, the internal audit department is required \nto  ensure  compliance  with  the  ministry\u2019s  internal  control  systems;  to  verify  the  accuracy  of \nfinancial and operational reports; besides guaranteeing the adequacy of the systems in place to \nsafeguard  assets.  The  IAD  is  also  required  to  coordinate  internal  audit  findings  with  the  NAA, \nand to submit copies of internal audit reports to the NAA. Twenty-two staff members have been \nappointed  to  IAD  in  MAFF,  and  19  staff  members  have  been  recruited  to  join  the  IAD  in \nMOWRAM.  In  2007  MAFF  completed  40  assignments  and  MOWRAM  completed  five \nassignments. \n \n45. \nThe EFI of MEF has prepared a PFM capacity development plan covering a wide range \nof  training  and  personnel-development  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  PFMRP  platform  2. \nThe  PFM  capacity  development  plan  was  approved  in  August  2008.  Of  the  23  courses \nproposed  by  EFI  to  support  the  activities  of  platform  2,  15  courses  have  been  finalized  and  8 \ncourses  still  need  to  be  developed.  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  staff  will  participate  fully  in \nthese activities, with training to be provided by the EFI or by ADB-funded advisers to the rural \ndevelopment  ministries.  In  conjunction  with  the  recommendations  of  ADB  TA,  capacity \ndevelopment will become a central focus of PFM roll-out to MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD. \n \n46. \nDecentralization  reforms  will  strengthen  the  impact  of  development  projects  through \nparticipation  of  rural  communities  in  the  decision  making  process  on  issues  that  impact  their \nlives.  In  addition,  provision  of  adequate  resources  to  the  subnational  levels  of  Government \nthrough the envisaged fiscal decentralization (by designated and shared taxes and fiscal grants) \nwill contribute to improved service delivery. An organic law on administrative arrangements for \nsubnational  levels  of  government  was  passed  in  March  2008,  and  a  subnational  financial  law \nwas  drafted  by  MEF.  The  three  rural  development  ministries\u2014MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD\u2014\nwill be engaged with the Ministry of Interior and MEF in planning the assignment or delegation \n\n                                                 \n30 ADB.  2004.

MAFF,  MOWRAM, \nand MRD will also be involved in implementing new financial arrangements, including assigned \nand shared revenues and fiscal grants, for subnational administrations. \n \nThe management of water resources and irrigation is one of the priority actions under \n47. \nthe  2004  National  Water  Resources  Policy  and  the  NSDP  2006\u20132010.  MOWRAM  is \ncommitted  to  translating  this  national  policy  and  strategic  direction  on  farmer  water  user\u2019s \ncommunities (FWUC) into action. The collective aim is to have a regulatory framework that \nprovides a sound legal basis for FWUC that will formally define its roles and responsibilities. \nThe Law on Water Resources Management was enacted in July 2007. The passage of the \n\u201cWater Law\u201d has cleared the way for MOWRAM to proceed with the final preparation of the \ndraft subdecree on FWUC to strengthen and expand FWUC, to enable them to participate in \nirrigation \nwater  management  and  allocation  and \ninfrastructure. \n \n\nthe  effectiveness  of \n\nto  maintain \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Strengthened External Audit \n\n \n48. \nPFMRDP recognizes the NAA as the key institution that will report independently to the \nparliament and the public on whether public resources have been accounted for and managed \neffectively. To enable NAA to discharge its functions properly, it is essential that the NAA has \nthe  skills  and  competence  to  undertake  audits  effectively.  NAA  prepared  a  Strategic \nDevelopment  Plan  2007\u20132011  in  2007.  This  provides  the  basis  for  its  current  audit  planning, \nincluding training and capacity building. The NAA is being provided with project assistance and \na peer review will be undertaken by another reputable SAI to enable it to develop an action plan \nfor improving its performance. The NAA has endorsed the terms of reference for the audit peer \nreview (APR). The NAA\u2019s willingness to accept an APR is evidence of its commitment to adopt \ninternational best practices. To ensure timely and audited accounts, over the last year the NAA \ncompleted  audits  of  the  Government\u2019s  accounts.  These  audits  covered  several  years  through \n2005. The NAA is currently working on the 2006 accounts. The completed audited accounts for \n2002, 2003, and 2004 have been submitted to the National Assembly, but not published. \n \nB. \n \n49. \nThe PFMRDP outlines major elements of the Government\u2019s PFM reform agenda for rural \ndevelopment  ministries  for  the  next  2  years,  building  on  the  momentum  from  subprogram  1. \nIndicative policy actions for subprogram 2 are included in the policy matrix in Appendix 3.  \n \n\nPFMRDP Medium Term Program: Subprogram 2 Indicative Policy Actions \n\n1. \n\nComponent  1:  Strengthening  the  Financial  Management  Framework  to \nIncrease Accountability \n\n \nFive  triggers  are  proposed  for  component  1  of  subprogram  2.  The  establishment  of  a \n50. \nrural development subworking group (under the economic sector working group) will be the first \ntrigger.  This is essential to achieving proper focus and coordination of PFM reform measures in \nMAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD. Effective implementation of the ministry action plans are among \nother  actions  envisaged  to  give  operational  guidance  to  implement  PFM  reforms  in  MAFF, \nMOWRAM,  and  MRD  by  2009.  The  program  will  allow  the  release  of  resources  to  assist  the \nPFM working groups that have been formed in MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD with implementing \ntheir reform tasks.  \n \n51. \nProcurement reform is expected to receive legal sanction with the proposed passage by \nthe  legislature  of  the  Procurement  Law.  New  implementing  rules  and  regulations  are  also \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21 \n\nenvisaged. There will be procurement oversight by the MEF through regular ex-post reviews of \nprocurement activities undertaken by line ministries. In addition, there will be further training of \nprocurement staff in line ministries. The second trigger of this component proposes drafting the \nProcurement Law by 2009. MEF will increase the transparency of the procurement process by \nsetting  up  a  procurement  website  to  advertise  all  Government  bidding  opportunities,  and  by \nrequiring line ministries to post all bidding opportunities to the website. Training will be provided \nto MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD staff on accessing the website.  The third trigger is proposed in \nthe  context  of  improving  civil  service  incentives,  and  it  is  expected  that  the  Council  for \nAdministrative  Reform  will  accomplish  broader  salary  reform  initiatives  within  the  PFM  reform \nframework.32 The subprogram will also include preparation of implementing instructions for the \nnew public financial system law (the organic budget law) by 2009. \n \nTwo triggers in this component relate to further reforms in public debt management.  The \n52. \nfirst  is  to  complete  the  drafting  by  2009  of  the  proposed  Public  Debt  Subdecree,  which  will \ninclude  provisions  for  debt  and  risk  management,  government  on-lending,  and  government \nguarantees. The second trigger is preparation of a debt management strategy by 2010. Both of \nthese  reforms  are  essential  for  establishing  a  proper  institutional  basis  for  debt  management. \nOther debt management reforms that are to be implemented include establishment of a middle-\noffice  function  in  the  Debt  Management  Office  in  MEF  (to  improve  risk  analysis,  debt  portfolio \nmanagement,  and  other  functions)  and  enhanced  training  in  the  use  of  the  debt-management \ndatabase.  As  an  efficient  debt-management  system  is  essential  to  a  well-functioning  public \nsector, ADB will continue its involvement in this area by providing significant further assistance \nfor institutional and capacity development under the program cluster. \n \nFor  increased  efficiency  of  budget  execution  and  improved  budget  reporting  it  is \n53. \nproposed  that  (i)  the  use  of  the  banking  system  for  Government  revenue  and  expenditure \ntransactions  be  expanded  further  by  2010;  and  (ii)  quarterly  and  annual  budget  reports, \nincluding the audited annual financial statements which are submitted to the National Assembly, \nbe publicly released. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Strengthened Financial Management in the Rural Sector \n\n \nFive  triggers  are  proposed  for  component  2  of  subprogram  2.  The  first  trigger  is  that \n54. \nMAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  will  comply  with  an  existing  requirement  to  submit  monthly \nprocurement  activity  reports  to  MEF  from  2009.  This  reporting  requirement  is  essential  to \nimproving budget execution rates and reducing fiduciary risks. In order to increase transparency \nin procurement, it is also proposed under the program that MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD post all \nof their procurement bidding opportunities to the Government procurement website by the third \nquarter of 2010. \n \nBy 2010, MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD will be fully applying the SOPs, the harmonized \n55. \nprocurement  manual,  and  the  financial  management  manual  mandated  in  2007  (supported \nunder ADB  TA for Harmonizing Loan Project Implementation Procedures) for all ADB projects \n(second trigger). In the third trigger, it is proposed that the three rural development ministries will \ncomply with the requirements of good governance frameworks (GGFs) in implementation of all \ncurrent  and  future  ADB  programs  and  projects.  These  will  be  effective  measures  to  reduce \nfiduciary  risks  to  project  implementation.  Budget  comprehensiveness  and  transparency  will  be \n\n                                                 \n32 Council for Administrative Reform (CAR) is a high-level group located in the Council of Ministers and responsible \n\nto determine a comprehensive policy for administrative reform.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nimproved  by  requiring  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  to  include  all  Government-funded \nexpenditures  and  at  least  50%  of  donor-financed  expenditures  in  their  budgets  by  2010. \nResources  for  sustainable  management  of  the  national  water  system  are  also  expected  to  be \nmade available to MOWRAM by 2009 from the proposed water user charges subdecree.  \n \n56. \nStrengthening the financial management system will improve the effectiveness of service \ndelivery  to  the  rural  population.  The  new  FMIS  will  be  piloted  in  selected  ministries,  including \nMAFF  and  MRD,  by  2010.  Full  adoption  of  the  new  functional  and  program  classifications  for \nbudget classification and chart of accounts by MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD will improve budget \npreparation and execution by the fourth quarter of 2009. The adoption and implementation of a \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  framework  by  MOWRAM  and  MRD  by  2010  will  improve \naccountability and service delivery. \n \n57. \nThe fourth trigger of this component will be completion of training by internal audit staff in \nMAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  by  2011.  The  training  under  PFMRDP  will  build  on  the \nrecommendations of ADB TA (4988-CAM). Other internal audit reforms are operationalizing the \nexisting  internal  audit  units  in  MAFF,  MRD,  MOWRAM  fully  by  the  fourth  quarter  of  2010  and \nestablishing  procedures  for  effective  follow-up  of  internal  audit  recommendations  by  MAFF, \nMOWRAM,  and  MRD  senior  management  by  2010.  To  ensure  accountability,  MAFF, \nMOWRAM,  and  MRD  internal  audit  units  will  submit  their  reports  to  MEF  and  NAA  for  quality \ncontrol  purposes  by  2010.  To  meet  reporting  requirements  under  the  audit  law  and  generally \naccepted audit standards, internal audit report mechanisms and procedures will be introduced. \n \n58. \nTo improve service delivery to rural communities, it is expected that MAFF, MOWRAM, \nand  MRD  will  delegate  new  roles  and  responsibilities  to  provinces  and  districts  by  2010  with \ncommensurate  financial  resources.  These  financial  provisions  are  intended  to  give  provincial \ndepartments  under  rural  development  ministries  sufficient  resources,  in  the  form  of  assigned \nand shared revenues and fiscal grants, to meet their service delivery mandates. The fifth trigger \nof  this  component  is  that  at  least  75%  of  the  training  component  of  the  PFM  Capacity \nDevelopment  Plan  will  be  delivered  in  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  by  the  fourth  quarter  of \n2010. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Strengthened External Audit \n \n\n59. \nThere  is  one  trigger  in  this  component  which  relates  to  the  Audit  Peer  Review  (APR), \nproposed  to  be  undertaken  in  2009  by  another  SAI.  The  adoption  and  implementation  of  an \naction plan arising from the recommendations of the APR by 2010 will contribute to improving \nNAA\u2019s performance. The recommendations of the APR will support the overarching objectives \nof NAA\u2019s Strategic Development Plan and contribute to NAA institutional strengthening over the \nmedium  term.  Implementation  subdecrees  for  the  Audit  Law  will  be  developed  that  will  clarify \nthe role and functions of NAA. With capacity development support, it is envisaged that NAA will \nbe  strengthened  to  effectively  undertake  financial,  compliance,  and  performance  audits  of \nprojects funded by overseas development assistance. Procedures will be in place to strengthen \nmechanisms  for  improved  interface  between  internal  audit  offices  and  NAA.  Considering  the \nenormity  and  complexities  of  training  staff  to  be  professional  auditors,  much  more  assistance \nneeds to be provided if NAA is to become an effective SAI.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23 \n\nFigure 5: Overview of the PFMRDP \n\nStrategic Framework: Public Financial Management Reform Program \n\nPFMRDP Cluster \u2013 \nSeries of 2 single-\ntranche grants from \n2008 to 2010 \n\nGovernment's PFM \nSector Strategies \n\nADB's Sector \nPrograms and \ngrant-financed \nprojects \n\n\u2022  Fiscal consolidation, and increased \n\n\u2022  Support to debt \n\nCore Area 1 \n \n\u2022  Strengthen PFM Policy \n\nFramework and Incentive \nSystem \n\n\u2022  Improve Expenditure \n\nEfficiency \n\n\u2022  Strengthen Debt \nManagement \n\n \n\nCore Area 2 \n \n\u2022  Improve budget planning and \n\ncomprehensiveness \n\n\u2022  Strengthen budget execution, \n\nincluding procurement \n\n\u2022  Improve budget accounting, \nmonitoring and Reporting \n\n\u2022  Improve internal audit \n\noversight \n\n\u2022  Improve service delivery \n\u2022  Sustain capacity \n\ndevelopment in PFM \n\nmanagement through the \nproposed Project \n\n\u2022  Financial Sector Program \n\nCluster \n\n\u2022  Promoting Economic \n\nDiversification Program \n\n\u2022  PFM support to rural \n\ndevelopment \n\n\u2022  Support  to  public  financial \nin  MRD, \n\nmanagement \nMAFF, and MOWRAM \n\u2022  Capacity  development  in \n\n\u2022  Sector \n\ninvestment \nprogram  (earlier  ADB  TA \nfor  strengthening  national \nprogram  budgeting  for  the \nagriculture sector) \n\nrevenue collection \n\n\u2022  Continue capacity building in the \nfunction of the debt management \noffice, and associated procedures and \nmanuals  \n\n\u2022  Promulgation of Revised Public \n\nFinancial System Law \n\n\u2022  Strengthen PFM reform monitoring \n\ncoordination mechanism \n\u2022  Procurement deconcentration \n\u2022  Greater use of the banking system \nand streamlined cash management \n\n\u2022  Continue improvement of budget \n\nstrategic framework \n\n\u2022  Improve budget comprehensiveness \n\nand integration \n\nbudget classification \n\n\u2022  Improved budget execution and \n\ntransaction process \n\n\u2022  Systematic procurement plan and \ncompliance with procurement \nprocedures, SOPs, PM, and FMM \n\n\u2022  Adoption of good governance \n\n\u2022  Piloting FMIS in MAFF \n\u2022  Adoption of monitoring and evaluation \n\nframework \n\nframework \n\n\u2022  Improve internal audit oversight  \n\n\u2022  Strengthen implementation of revised \n\ninternal audit \n\nCore Area 3 \n \n\u2022  Strengthen role, \n\nindependence and \neffectiveness of NAA  \n\n \n\n\u2022  Audit Law \n\u2022  Strategic Development Plan 2007\u2013\n\n2011 \n\n\u2022  Improve audit capacity for audit of \n\nexternally aided projects  \n\n\u2022  Institutional framework improved for \ninternal and external audit interface \n\n\u2022  Support to NAA in \n\nundertaking an external \npeer review \n\n\u2022  Capacity development in \n\nexternally assisted \nprojects \n\u2022  Facilitating \n\nImplementations decrees \nunder the Audit Law \n\nFMIS = Financial Management Information System, NAA = National Audit Authority, PM = Procurement Manual, \nFMM  =  Financial  Management  Manual,  PFM  =  Public  Financial  Management,  SOP  =  Standard  Operating \nProcedures. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nImportant Features \n\nC. \n \n60. \nThe  PFMRDP  has  several  distinctive  features.  First,  it  strengthens  ADB\u2019s  partnership \nwith  the  Government.  By  basing  financial  assistance  on  completed  actions  derived  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s own reform program, PFMRDP strengthens Government ownership of strategies \nrecommended by development partners. Second, the inclusion of policy triggers and milestone \nactions for subprogram 2 helps facilitate broad-based dialogue on PFM in the rural development \nministries in the medium term context, with reforms flowing sequentially on from the first to the \nsecond subprogram. Third, the PFMRDP helps establish an institutional mechanism to achieve \nbetter interagency coordination and implementation of reforms right across the central and line \nministries  of  the  Government.  Finally,  the  program  cluster  approach  helps  lay  out  a \ncomprehensive  set  of  complex  reforms  in  a  well-sequenced  fashion.  The  single-tranche \nprogram  cluster  funding  gives  good  flexibility  to  adjust  to  changing  circumstances  within  the \nlonger-term  cluster  concept,  while  focusing  on  achievable  up-front  outcomes,  including \ncompletion of high-impact outcomes prior to each respective Board consideration of financing. \n  \nD. \n \n61. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $6.71  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources to help finance subprogram 1 of the PFM program, with such terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to \nthe Board. Cambodia has been classified as a category A borrower since ADB resumed lending \noperations  in  1992,  and  could  receive  up  to  50%  of  its  total  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) in the form of grants under the ADF IX grants allocation framework, \nas  spelled  out  in  ADF  IX  Donor\u2019s  Report:  Development  Effectiveness  for  Poverty  Reduction. \nThe  ADF  funds  are  to  support  the  reform  measures  outlined  in  the  development  policy  letter \n(Appendix 2) and policy matrix (Appendix 3). The grant size was determined by the strength of \nthe  policy  package,  its  development  impact,  the  importance  of  the  sectors  covered,  and  the \ndevelopment financing needs of the Government, as estimated by MEF. \n \n62. \nPeriod and Tranching. The implementation period for subprogram 1 is from June 2006 \nto  31  December  2008,  with  a  single  tranche  grant  of  $6.71  million  to  be  disbursed  under \nsubprogram 1. The closing date of the grant will be 90 days from the date the Government has \nmet  the  conditions  for  grant  effectiveness.  Policy  actions  for  subprogram  2  are  subject  to \nrevision  and  refinement  following  ADB\u2019s  assessment  of  the  macroeconomic  environment, \nlessons  learned  from  implementing  subprogram  1,  and  the  overall  progress  of  PFM  reforms. \nSubprogram  2  will  be  presented  for  Board  consideration  and  approval  based  on  the  progress \nachieved in implementing subprogram 1, including the status of compliance with the proposed \npolicy actions, and the readiness of the Government to undertake the succeeding policy reform \nmeasures.  The  implementation  period  for  subprogram  2  is  expected  to  be  within  24  months \nfrom subprogram 1 grant effectiveness.  \n \n63. \nCounterpart  Funds.  The  Government  will  use  the  local-currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the grant proceeds to primarily meet program expenditures and associated costs \nof reform. \n \n64. \nProgram  Grant  Reflects  the  Development  Financing  Needs  of  the  Government \n(Table  4).  Given  the  narrow  revenue  base,  selective  and  focused  grant  assistance  will \nrepresent  a  major  addition  to  resource  availability.  The  program  cluster  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  increase  the  primary  budget  surplus  by  mobilizing  more  domestic \nresources, thereby striking a balance between containing inflation in 2008 and meeting priority \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25 \n\ndevelopment  spending.  However,  the  Government\u2019s  gross  and  net  financing  needs  will  be \nsignificant  if  it  is  to  sustain  economic  growth  of  more  than  7%  over  the  medium  term  and \nreduce  poverty  to  28%  by  2010.  The  Government  aims  to  increase  development  and  social \nspending  in  2008  and  2009.  According  to  MEF  budget  estimates,  the  net  financing  (primarily \nexternal)  requirements  for  2008  are  estimated  at  $451.3  million.  Over  the  longer  term,  the \nGovernment  envisages  reducing  external  debt  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  as  the  economy \ncontinues  to  expand.  A  recently  updated  debt  sustainability  assessment  (DSA)  by  the  IMF \nconcluded that Cambodia\u2019s debt is sustainable and that the country faces only a moderate risk \nof debt distress over a medium-term period up to 2027, provided GDP growth remains robust \nand  large-scale  concessional  financing  from  both  traditional  donors  and  new  development \npartners is sustained. The proposed grant of $6.71 million, along with project assistance of $4.1 \nmillion will help close the financing gap for 2008, as well as support the Government\u2019s reforms \nin  PFM,  including  strengthening  the  debt  management  office  and  developing  a  debt \nmanagement strategy.  \n \n\nTable 4: Government of Cambodia\u2019s Projected Financing Requirements for 2008 \n($ million) \n \n\nFinancing Mix                                                                \n1.

The  Government\u2019s  Economic  and  Financial \nPolicy Committee chaired by the deputy prime minister and minister of the Ministry of Economy \nand Finance and comprising other key ministers and secretaries of state of line ministries shall \nprovide overall policy guidance. The  Government\u2019s steering committee on PFM (PSC), chaired \nby the secretary of state of the MEF and comprising the deputy governor of the National Bank of \nCambodia,  the  secretary  general  of  the  Cambodia  Rehabilitation  and  Development  Board,  and \nsenior representatives in charge of finance at the level of secretary general or director general in \ncharge  of  finance  shall  be  the  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  for  PFMRDP  responsible  for \ncoordinating  program  implementation  and  sustaining  of  subprogram  1  actions  by  relevant \nministries and agencies of the Government. The PFM working groups established at each of the \nspending  ministries,  and  chaired  by  the  relevant  member  of  the  PSC  for  PFM  shall  support \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nProgram  implementation  at  the  ministry  level.  The  PSC  for  PFM  shall  meet  as  required  to:  (a) \nreview  progress  reports  from  the  PFM  working  groups;  (b)  monitor  progress  and  oversee  the \nimplementation of the Program; and (c) provide guidance and direction to relevant line agencies \nof the Government involved in Program actions and activities.

NAA will be the Executing Agency for the audit pillar of PFMRDP. \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements \n\n \n66. \nThe grant of $6.71 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness (i.e., all \nconditions in the subprogram 1 policy matrix in Appendix 3 must be satisfactorily complied with \nprior  to  release  of  the  tranche).  The  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible \nitems,  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  proceeds  of  the \nprogram  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  with  the  Government  as  the \nBeneficiary. 33  In  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements  for  program  loans,  all  goods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB \nmember  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the  Government  will  open  or  nominate  a  deposit \naccount with the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) to receive the grant proceeds. The account \nwill  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB. \nSubprogram  1  will  provide  for  retroactive  financing  for  eligible  expenditures  incurred  by  the \nGovernment up to 180 days prior to grant effectiveness.  \n \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n\n3. \n \n67. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program  and  related  project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the program grant and grant-financed project shall include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the \nexecuting agencies and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. \n \nThe  design  of  the  PFMRDP  is  anchored  in  the  governance  framework.

For  ADB  projects,  Cambodia  has  adopted  a  variety  of \nproject- and/or program-level mitigation measures including the application of the Government's \nSOPs and the procurement manuals in the administration of program and projects (Supported \nunder TA for Harmonizing Loan Project Implementation Procedures). ADB-financed projects for \nCambodia  have  incorporated  several  additional  measures,  on  top  of  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency. First, ADB-financed projects now \nincorporate disclosure and grievance redress measures, including (i) development of a project \nwebsite  to  disclose  information  about  procurement  and  other  project  activities;  and  (ii) \nestablishing  a  grievance-redress  mechanism  to  encourage  more  stakeholder  vigilance  and \nensure  greater  accountability  Second,  all  ADB-financed  projects  for  Cambodia  have  also \nincorporated  good  governance  frameworks  (GGFs),  which  the  Government  has  been  signing \nsince 2007.  \n  \n\n4. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nADB retains the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \n69. \nthe  Government\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  application.  The  Executing  Agencies  will  be \nrequired  to  submit  a  final  report  on  the  progress  of  subprogram  1  implementation  for \nincorporation with an overall program cluster report. ADB will, in cooperation with the Executing \nAgencies, carry out periodic reviews of progress with the program cluster implementation, and \nassess  its  impact.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcome  of  policy \ndiscussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for the program \ncluster implementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting \npolicy proposals.  \n\nPerformance Evaluation and Program Review \n\n \nIn  coordination  with  the  Program  Steering  Committee,  ADB  will  carry  out  periodic \n70. \nreviews  of  the  progress  of  implementation  and  assess  the  impact  of  the  Program.  The \nGovernment will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral \nand bilateral agencies that have implications for program implementation, and will provide ADB \nwith the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. Based on regular progress \nreports from Executing Agencies and the PSC, ADB will also monitor progress over the baseline \ndata and coordinate monitoring and evaluation of the program given the many implementation \nagencies  involved.  ADB  will,  in  collaboration  with  the  PSC,  undertake  a  review  of  program \nperformance  12  months  after  grant  effectiveness  to  review  the  outcome  of  subprogram  1  and \nprepare  for  subprogram  2.  The  Executing  Agencies  will  submit  within  30  days  of  the  grant \neffectiveness  of  subprogram  1,  a  report  that  will  evaluate  implementation  of  the  policy  reform \nmeasures  under  subprogram  1,  and  assess  the  impact  of  subprogram  1,  describe  lessons \nidentified  during  the  subprogram  period,  and  outline  reforms  and  assistance  needed  for  the \ndevelopment of the economy, to enable processing of subprogram 2. \n \n71. \nADB, in cooperation with MEF, will review the progress of program implementation and \nassess the Program\u2019s impact on the structure and development of PFM. The Government and \nADB will continue to engage in active policy dialogue on sector issues, policy reforms, and other \n                                                 \n34 These  reform  areas  are  highlighted  in  key  policy  documents  including  the  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth, \nEmployment,  Equity,  and  Efficiency  for  the  third  mandate  of  the  RGC,  2003\u20132008;  the  subsequent  National \nStrategic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010;  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program\u2013Strengthening \nGovernance  Through  Enhanced  Public  Financial  Management,  2004;  and  the  Second  Governance  Action  Plan \n2005\u20132008.    \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nmeasures during the cluster program period and on additional reforms that may be considered \nnecessary or desirable. The Government (MEF) will prepare and provide ADB with a program \ncompletion  report  on  the  overall  impact  of  the  policy  reforms  implemented  within  3  months  of \ncompletion of the Program. \n \n\nVI. \n\nGRANT ASSISTANCE \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n72. \nTo support the implementation of the PFMRP, the Government of Cambodia requested \nthat  ADB  provide  grant  assistance  to  support  institutional  and  capacity  development  over  the \nmedium term. Implementation of PFMRP reforms will also require technical inputs and targeted \non-the-job  support  to  equip  the  key  Government  agencies  with  the  required  knowledge  and \nskills  to  ensure  that  the  results  of  the  reforms  will  be  sustained  beyond  PFM,  and  that  reform \ntriggers  under  subprogram  2  and  milestones  are  achieved.  The  institutional  and  capacity \nbuilding  project  has  been  designed  to  support  PFM  reforms  over  the  medium-term.  The \nsequencing of the project activities will be coordinated with the platform approach of the PFMRP, \nand will provide for appropriate sequencing, required synchronization, and desired flexibility to \nensure  success.  Building  on  the  capacity  development  recommendations  made  under  earlier \nADB TA support, the proposed project will complement the capacity development action plan of \nthe EFI, and the efforts of core advisors and consultants under PFMRP in strengthening PFM \nreform  measures  in  MAFF,  MRD,  and  MOWRAM.2  In  addition,  the  project  objectives  will \ncomplement  the  proposed  public  policy  training  program  2007\u20132010  under  the  ongoing  ADB \nRETA financed by the Japan Fund for Public Policy Training.  \n \n73. \nThe  project  will  be  the  key  instrument  supporting  rollout  of  PFM  reforms  in  rural \ndevelopment ministries and will have four components to support PFM reforms in the medium-\nterm.  Appendix  7  details  the  project  components  and  outputs.  One  of  the  project  components \nwill  support  rural  development  ministries  (MAFF,  MRD,  and  MOWRAM)  to  implement  and \nmonitor  key  reforms  to  PFM  with  the  focus  on  enhancing  budget  planning,  budget  execution \nincluding procurement, accounting, recording and reporting. Another major component will be to \nstrengthen  internal  audit  in  these  ministries  as  a  useful  management  tool  to  improve  financial \ncontrols and procedures. Strengthening public debt management in the Government will also be \na critical area of support, following up the progress achieved from the recently concluded ADB \nTA on debt management. In addition, NAA will be supported to improve its audit capacity as it \nhas a fundamental role in improving the quality of financial governance, reinforcing institutional \noversight  and  providing  critical  checks  and  balances  in  the  management  of  public  finances. \nImplementation  of  PFM  reforms  under  subprogram  2  will  also  require  technical  inputs  and \ntargeted  on-the-job  support  to  equip  the  key  Government  agencies  with  the  knowledge  and \nskills  to  ensure  that  the  results  of  the  reforms  will  be  sustained  beyond  PFM,  and  that  reform \ntriggers under subprogram 2 and milestones are achieved. Types of assistance common to all \ncomponents  will  be  in  form  of  inputs  such  as:  (i)  engagement  of  international  and  national \nconsultants with relevant competencies in core PFM areas; (ii) peripatetic visits by experts and \nlong-term mentor support; (iii) seminars, conferences, and study tours; (iv) formal training and \nother workshops; and (v) provisions of materials and equipment, including IT database systems \nand computer hardware and software. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nB. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \n\n29 \n\n74. \nThe  project is  estimated  to  cost  $4.54  million  equivalent  including  estimated  taxes  and \nduties  of  $25,000.

The  PFM \nReform  Working  Group  and  any  additional  necessary  counterpart  staff  within  each  of  the  IAs \nshall act as the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for the respective activities with the Director of \nthe relevant IA\u2019s Department of Internal Audit, responsible for Component 2 activities. NAA shall \nbe the EA for Component 4 and the NAA\u2019s PMU comprising a senior staff member as the head \nand relevant counterpart staff shall implement Component 4.The PSC for PFM shall also act as \nthe  Project  steering  committee  to  oversee  the  Project  and  provide  overall  direction  and  policy \nguidance. Further, the financial management and fiduciary arrangements in MEF, MAFF, MRD, \nand MOWRAM, based on assessment of the project preparatory TA, is deemed satisfactory for \nthe purpose of project implementation. \n \n77. \nPeriod  of  Implementation.  The  project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  3  years. \nProject activities are scheduled to commence in April 2009 and be completed by March 2012. \nThe project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 9. \n \n78. \nConsulting Services and Procurement. The grant assistance will finance a team of 8 \ninternational  (86  person-months)  and  15  national  consultants  (213  person-months)  to  build \ncapacity while helping to implement the ongoing PFM reform measures. The terms of reference \nfor the consulting services and their duration are in Supplementary Appendix A. The consultants, \nincluding the team leader, will be selected by ADB through a consulting firm(s) (including joint \nproposal  with  domestic  firms)  through  full  technical  (for  component  1)  and  simplified  (for \ncomponent  3)  proposals  using  quality  and  cost  ratio  for  Quality-  and  Cost-Based  Selection \n(QCBS)  process  (80:20)  for  components  relating  to  strengthening  PFM  for  rural  development \nand  for  strengthening  debt  management.  One  international  consultant  and  one  national \nconsultant  for  component  2  (internal  audit)  and  one  international  consultant  and  one  national \nconsultant for component 4 (external audit) will also be selected by ADB following consultation \nwith the Government, on an individual basis, as the distinct areas of expertise involved may not \nbe  available  through  a  single  firm.  At  the  request  of,  and  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  the \nconsultants will be selected by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  As  the \nproposed project deals with MEF and three line ministries of which three have overlapping and \nsupporting functions in rural development, the Government feels that ADB administration of the \nproject would ensure PFM priorities and reforms are effectively synchronized across agencies. \n \n79. \nTo  support  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  portfolio  management \ndatabase, project component 3 supporting debt management will finance an IT system that will \nallow  MEF  to  record  and  provide  project-specific  information,  including  disbursement  and \ncontract awards of both development partner- and Government-funded projects. The functional \nspecifications  of  the  system  will  be  designed,  including  specifying  hardware  and  software \nsystem  requirements,  for  commissioning  and  implementation  by  a  team  of  IT  national  experts \nworking  under  the  supervision  of  international  consultants.  Information  and  communication \ntechnology  (IT),  related  equipment  and  two  vehicles  (for  NAA  and  the  Department  of  Internal \nAudit  for  audit-related  travel  to  inaccessible  provinces)  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n80. \nDisbursement Arrangements. The ADB grant proceeds will be disbursed according to \nthe procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nTo  speed  up  project  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  grant  proceeds  for  eligible \nexpenditures, each of the Project Executing Agencies will establish a project imprest account in \ndollars  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  managed  and \nadministered by the MEF and NAA respectively. The maximum amount to be deposited to each \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n31 \n\nof the project imprest accounts will be based on the estimated expenditures to be financed from \nthe project imprest account for the first six months of project implementation, or 5% of the Grant \namount whichever is lower. In addition, MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM will each establish Second \nGeneration  Imprest  Accounts  (SGIAs)  at  the  commercial  bank,  or  branch  thereof,  where  the \nMEF  project  imprest  account  is  to be  established.  The  maximum  amount  to  be  deposited  into \neach  SGIAs  shall  be  equivalent  to  6  months\u2019  estimated  expenditures  to  be  funded  from  SGIA \nbut in any event not exceeding the amount of $5,000.The project imprest accounts and each of \nthe SGIAs will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements as agreed between the Government \nand  ADB.  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  when  seeking \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures and liquidating advances made into the project imprest \naccounts.  Each  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE  will  not  exceed  the \nequivalent  of  $10,000.  SGIA  will  be  liquidated  and  replenished  based  on  submission  of  full \nsupporting documentation. \n \n81. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  MEF and NAA, assisted by the team leader of \neach  project  component,  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  in \naccordance with the provisions of the Grant Agreement and ADB guidelines (Guidelines for the \nFinancial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB,  2002)  and \nwill  have  them  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  During  project \nimplementation,  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year,  MEF  and  NAA  will  submit  to \nADB certified copies of the annual audited project accounts and financial statements, as well as \nthe auditor\u2019s report, which will include a separate opinion on the use of the imprest account and \nstatement of expenditures procedures, and management letter, all in English. MEF and NAA will \nindicating  progress  made,  problems \nsubmit  semiannual  and  annual  reports \nencountered,  and  steps  taken  to  remedy  the  problems,  a  program  of  activities,  and  expected \nprogress during the implementation period. The reports will incorporate the project performance \nmonitoring  data  and  all  relevant  financial  data.  MEF  and  NAA  will  also  provide  reports  and \ninformation  relating  to  the  Project  as  ADB  may  reasonable  request.  Within  3  months  after \nproject  completion,  MEF  and  NAA  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  detailing \ninformation on project implementation, and accomplishment of the project activities. \n \nPerformance  Monitoring,  Evaluation,  and  Reporting. The Government and ADB will \n82. \nundertake  joint  reviews  of  the  Project  every  6  months  to  assess  progress  in  component \nactivities, the quality of activities and the outputs produced, the performance of the project, and \nidentify issues and challenges. MEF, NAA, and ADB will conduct a midterm review covering a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  achievements  against  the  Project\u2019s  expected  impact  and \noutcomes,  and  the  modification  of  implementation  arrangements  where  necessary  for  the \nsuccessful completion of the Project.  \n\nto  ADB, \n\nVII. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n\n \n\nBenefits \n\nA. \n \nThe  program  is  expected  to  yield  significant  benefits  as  effective  PFM  systems  are \n83. \ncrucial  for  Cambodia  in  making  progress  in  reducing  poverty.  Sound  PFM  leads  to  affordable \nand  optimal  resource  allocation  and  improves  institutional  arrangements  and  management \npractices  to  support  effective  delivery  of  services.  The  program  will  likewise  foster  greater \naccountability  and  efficiency  in  the  management  of  public  resources  and  delivery  of  services, \nwhich  are  critical  to  the  achievement  of  public policy  objectives  and  the  MDGs.  Strengthening \ninstitutions like the NAA will improve fiduciary oversight. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nImpacts \n\n \n84. \nEconomic and Financial Benefits. ADB estimates the main direct economic benefit in \nthe near term will be the cost saving for the Government in terms of procuring consultants and \nproviding  materials and equipment, including IT database systems and computers\u2014hardware \nand  software.  Government  contracts  face  significantly  higher  than  market  prices  as  supplies \nbuild into the contract price the cost of delayed payment, time costs in terms of efforts made in \ndealing  with  cumbersome  processes  and  procedures  and  some  level  of  uncertainty  over \npossible forfeiture of payment (a risk payment). The benefit quantified to the Government of the \nADB  project  is  therefore  between  $615,000  and  $820,000  for  2009. 35 Procurement  of  all  the \ninputs  for  the  project  will  take  place  in  2009;  benefits  to  the  Government  are  in  the  form  of  a \none-off savings. \n \nB. \n \n85. \nHigher Economic and Poverty Impacts. The program is expected to have substantial \npositive economic impacts. Strong PFM systems contribute to macroeconomic stability through \nimproved  management  of  fiscal  expenditures  to  reduce  public  deficits  and  uncontrolled \nincreases  in  the  money  supply.  Strengthening  the  PFM  system  for  rural  development  will \ncontribute  to  better  planning,  management,  and  usage  of  budget  resources,  which  will  have  a \npositive  impact  on  the  rural  sector  and  employment  generation.  This  in  turn  will  ensure  a \nbroadening of the tax base and will therefore contribute directly to increasing the fiscal space of \nthe Government. In line with the better fiscal management, resources for sector investment will \nincrease; the Program will therefore enhance the increased fiscal space for increased allocation \nfor  social  sector  spending,  especially  in  rural  development  sectors,  including  agriculture,  rural \nwater supply, sanitation, irrigation, and rural roads. \n \nC. \n \nPolitical  Risks.  Political  governance  is  a  key  risk  to  the  sustainability  of  PFM  reform. \n86. \nHowever, given the strong commitment at the highest level of political leadership and the broad \nconsensus  on  the  direction  of  reforms  among  the  major  political  leaders,  the  risk  that  the \ntrajectory and momentum of reform will be reversed is low.  \n \n87. \nInstitutional  Risks.  The  comprehensive  nature  of  the  program  will  place  significant \ndemands  on  the  Government\u2019s  weak  institutions.  In  PFMRP  stage  2,  the  envisaged  capacity \ndevelopment  plan  is  comprehensive  and  includes  technical,  organizational  development,  and \nmotivational and change management issues.  \n \n88. \nImplementation Risks. The PFMRDP may be undermined by continued and excessive \ncentralization in decision making without adequate financial resources. Measures to strengthen \ntechnical  capacity  within  the  scope  of  the  PFMRDP  and  through  ADB  sector  investments \ninclude  establishment  of  a  subworking  group  proposed  under  PFMRDP,  which  will  ensure \nappropriate  coordination  arrangements  between  MEF  and  rural  development  ministries.  Close \nperformance monitoring will help reduce implementation delays.  \n \n91. \nExternal Risks. The immediate impact of the financial crisis in the US and Europe, and \nthe  drying  up  there  of  liquidity  in  the  commercial  paper  and  related  money  and  interbank \nmarkets  pose  neither  significant  direct  risks  nor  significant  indirect  risks  to  the  Cambodian \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                 \n35 It is estimated that on average prices to the Government of Cambodia are between 15% and 20% higher than the \n\nmarket.

Phnom Penh. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n33 \n\neconomy, as Cambodian banks do not have significant exposure to borrowing from international \nbanks, and capital markets do not yet exist in Cambodia. However, the slowdown in the global \neconomy  resulting  from  the  fall  in  US  and  European  growth  rates  has  impacted  Cambodia\u2019s \ngrowth  rate,  initially  through  reduced  demand  for  Cambodian  garments,  which  has  reduced \nexport growth. Rising fuel and food prices pose a major threat and will exert pressure on budget \nresources,  worsening  the  fiscal  and  macroeconomic  environment.  The  impact  of  food  price \nincreases  on  poverty  is  being  mitigated  through  emergency  assistance  approved  for  this \npurpose.36 In  the  medium  to  long  term,  continued  business  environment  reforms,  trade  policy \nreforms and improvements in cross border facilitation aimed at enhancing Cambodia\u2019s external \ncompetitiveness will improve growth prospects.  \n \n90. \nOverall  Assessment. Given the magnitude of rural poverty in Cambodia, and the fact \nthat its growth is narrowly based on garments and tourism, suitable policies and institutions are \nneeded  to  sustain  growth  and  reduce  poverty  over  the  medium  term.  Public  financial \nmanagement reforms and private sector development reforms collectively provide a stable and \npredictable  environment  necessary  for  growth  and  broad-based  development.  Such  reforms \naddress  endemic  governance  challenges  in  the  stewardship  of  scarce  public  resources  and \nhelp  target  and  prioritize  those  resources  transparently  toward  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \n \n \n91. \ntranche conditions, as specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 3).  \n \n\nConditions for Grant Effectiveness. The Program will become effective on meeting all \n\nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n\n \n92. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. During the PFMRDP period, the \nGovernment, on the basis of supporting the PFMRDP, will: \n \n\npromptly  adopt  and  implement  in  a  timely  manner  the  polices  and  program \nactions  indicated  under  subprogram  1  of  the  PFMRDP  as  specified  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 2) including the policy matrix, and will ensure \nthat such policies and actions are sustained; \n\nactively  assist  and  support  the  PFM  reform  steering  committee  (MEF)  and  the \nPFM  working  groups  in  MAFF,  MRD,  and  MOWRAM  to  undertake  ongoing \nPFMRDP monitoring and evaluation by facilitating consultation with agencies and \nother key stakeholders as appropriate; \n\nkeep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other  stakeholders  about \nmeasures to ensure effective implementation of the PFMRDP; \n\ngive  ADB  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  relevant  studies  and  draft  laws  or \ndecrees that are likely to impact on PFMRDP objectives and implementation; and \n\n                                                 \n36 ADB. 2008.

From 6.4% at end-September \n2007, year-on-year inflation had risen to 10.8% by end-December 2007 and to 20.7% by end-\nSeptember 2008. While inflation has been largely imported through higher international prices \nof  oil  and  food  items,  and  exchange-rate  effects,  inflation  has  been  driven  also  by  higher \ndomestic  food  prices,  including  for  rice  (20%),  pork,  chicken,  and  fish  (30%\u201360%)  which \ntogether  with  transportation  have  a  combined  weight  of  over  43%  in  the  revised  CPI  basket. \nRapidly  rising  commercial  bank  credit  to  the  private  sector  (85.8%  at  end-August  2008  on  a \nyear-on-year basis), also contributed to the boost in private domestic demand. In addition to its \nadverse macroeconomic effects, the spike in inflation risks undermining growth and slowing, or \neven reversing the trend, and progress achieved in reducing poverty over the last decade or so. \nPreliminary  evidence  suggests  that  as  many  as  2  million  people  may  have  slipped  below  the \npoverty line as a result of food price increases (in addition to the 4\u00bd million already below the \npoverty line), and that the poverty rate in the rural areas of eight provinces, mostly around the \nTonle  Sap  basin  where  most  of  the  poor  live,  has  reached  38%.  The  authorities  have \nannounced a series of measures to combat inflation and requested emergency food assistance, \nincluding  from  ADB,  to  help  compensate  the  most  severely  affected  vulnerable  groups.  The \nGovernment has been building up its stocks of deposits in the banking sector to offset liquidity \ngrowth.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  also  announced  a  series  of  measures  to  help  curb  food \ninflation  through  special  financing  to  increase  rice  stocks  and  production.  To  date  there  have \nnot  been  any  announced  contractionary  curbs  on  Government  expenditure.  The \nreestablishment  of  macroeconomic  stability  is  crucial  for  Cambodia  to  meet  its  development \nobjectives. \n \n\n2. \n\nExpenditure Profile \n\n \n5. \nTable  A5.1  (below)  presents  a  breakdown  of  central  Government  operations  for  the \nperiod  2001\u20132007  in  billion  of  riels.

Total  expenditure  increased  from  KR2,366 \nbillion  to  KR4546  billion,  an  average  annual  increase  of  16.13%.  Debt  financing  levels  were \nequivalent  to  about  1%  of  total  expenditure  on  an  annual  basis.  The  majority  of  the  capital \nbudget was financed externally. The Government received around 10% of its annual budget in \ndirect budget support, which was also used to finance gaps for recurrent expenditure. \n \n\nTable A5.1: Government Operations: 2001\u20132007 \n(KR billion, nominal) \n\nItem \n\nGDP \nTotal Revenuea \nTotal Expenditurea \nCurrent Expenditure \nCapital  Expenditure  (Local  + \n\nExternal Financing) \n\nLocal Capital Financing \nExternal \n\nCapital \n\nFinancing \n\nProvincial \n(net of subsidy) \n\nExpenditure \n\n2001 \n\n15,617 \n\n  1,561 \n\n 2,366 \n\n 1,391 \n\n     974 \n\n     262 \n\n2002 \n\n16,756 \n\n  1,762 \n\n  2,833 \n\n 1,579 \n\n  1,253 \n\n    338 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n18,508 \n\n21,343 \n\n25,693 \n\n1,776 \n\n3,011 \n\n1,843 \n\n1,996 \n\n333 \n\n   2,209 \n\n   2,653 \n\n  3,183 \n\n  1,901 \n\n  1,282 \n\n     296 \n\n  3,513 \n\n   2,073 \n\n   1,441 \n\n      315 \n\n2006 \n\n29,809 \n\n  3,431 \n\n  4,016 \n\n  2,378 \n\n 1,639 \n\n    381 \n\n2007 \n(Budget) \n\n31,137 \n\n  3,261 \n\n  4,546 \n\n  2,861 \n\n  1,685 \n\n     526 \n\n     712 \n\n    915 \n\n863 \n\n     985 \n\n   1,126 \n\n 1,258 \n\n 1,110 \n\nDebt Financing \na Excludes provincial revenue and expenditure data. \nSources: Ministry of Economy and Finance, and International Monetary Fund estimates (2007). \n\n        55 \n\n       49 \n\n      22 \n\n    28 \n\n34 \n\n       37 \n\n     23 \n\n85 \n\n     110 \n\n      130 \n\n       11 \n\n       50 \n\n     118 \n\n       50 \n\nTable A5.2: Distribution of Expenditure by Sector for the Executed State Budget by \nFunction and Economic Sector 1996\u20132007 \n(% of total expenditure) \n\nItem \n\n1996 \n\n1997 \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\nCore Government \nGeneral Administration \nDefense, Security and Judiciary \nEconomic Services \nAgriculture \nTransport \nPublic Works \nOther Transport \nOther Economic Services \nEnvironmental Protection \nRural Development \nSocial Services \nHealth \nRecreation, Culture & Religion \nEducation \nSocial Protection \nOther \nDebt payments \nCapital Expenditure \nOther not classified \nTotal \n\u2014 = data not available \na  The  methodology  for  reporting  budget  expenditure  changed  in  2001.

From Table A5.2 it can be seen that expenditures on core \nGovernment activities decreased from 62% to 45% of the executed state budget between 1995 \nand 2007. Over the same period, expenditures on health increased from 4.6% to 10.51%, and \nexpenditures on education increased from 9.1% to 14.81%. Expenditures on economic services, \non the other hand, increased from 10.8% in 1995 to 16.9% in 2001, before declining to 7.3% in \n2007.  The  increased  expenditures  on  health  and  education  made  sense  following  the \nresumption  of  peace  in  the  mid-1990s  as  the  provision  of  adequate  social  services  to  the \npopulation with a limited resource base had to be the key priority of the Government.  \n \nHowever,  in  the  current  social,  institutional,  and  economic  environment,  if  the  RGC \n7. \nwants  to  sustain  its  current  growth  trajectory,  then  expenditures  on  economic  sectors \n(agriculture, transport, infrastructure, and rural development) is inadequate to meet the pressing \nneed  for  spending  on  public  goods  to  stimulate  rural-based,  labor-intensive,  poverty-reducing \ngrowth. Many countries in post-conflict situations have also experienced high growth rates and \npoverty reduction following the resumption of peace, and have increased expenditures on social \nactivities.  However,  international  experience  suggests  that  sustained  growth  requires  large-\nscale  increases  in  investment  in  the  economic  sectors  to  increase  the  productivity  of  the  real \nsector. This increase in productivity will in turn reduce poverty in agriculture-based economies \nthrough job creation opportunities for the rural population in the agriculture sector. Thus, from an \neconomic  perspective,  the  current  level  of  spending  on  economic  sectors  is  a  weakness  both \nthe RGC and development partners need to address. \n \n8. \nBased  on  available  data  it  is  estimated  that  total  expenditure  for  rural  development \ncalculated as the sum executed by the three line ministries (MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD) was \n4.4%  of  recurrent  expenditure  in  2006.  However,  analyzing  expenditure  patterns  for  rural \ndevelopment as a sector on its own is very difficult in Cambodia and it is unlikely that this figure \nis wholly accurate. In reality, it is nearly impossible given the paucity of existing data to define \nexactly how much of the Government's and donor\u2019s resources is allocated to rural development \nto support the joint sector budgets and strategies of the three priority ministries. In the area of \nrural  development  there  are  multiple  agencies  responsible  for  broadly  similar  policy  and \nprogram areas, resulting in fragmentation and even program duplication. Rural development is \nalso  not  limited  to  the  activities  of  the  three  ministries  of  Rural  Development  (Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Ministry of Rural Development and Ministry of Water Resources and \nMeteorology),  so  suggesting  a  figure  that  only  takes  these  ministries  into  account  does  not \nprovide an accurate picture of the real level of expenditure for rural development sector priorities. \nFinally,  it  is  very  difficult  to  determine  expenditure  patterns  at  the  central  line  ministry  (sector) \nlevel  because  parallel  negotiations  also  take  place  between  provincial  departments  under  line \nministries  and  MEF.  As  incremental  adjustments  are  made  throughout  the  year  to  cover  cash \ndeficits at the provincial level, the actual budget execution levels presented by the MEF for the \nsectors are likely to be inaccurate. However, increasing expenditures in productive areas will not \nlead  to  an  optimum  result  in  the  absence  of  serious  investment  in  capacity  development  and \nstrong  support  for  PFM  reforms  in  these  ministries  by  the  Government  and  the  development \npartners. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n55 \n\nthe  public \n\nfinancial  management  system,  civil  service \n\nPublic Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) \n\nB. \n \nThe Public Financial Management Program (PFMRP) was adopted in December 2004. 2 \n9. \nThe  2003  Integrated  Fiduciary  Assessment  and  Public  Expenditure  Review  (IFAPER)  \u2014the \nmost comprehensive pre-PFM reform assessment undertaken in Cambodia\u2014focused on three \nlevels  of  public  expenditure  policy  and  management:  (i)  aggregate  fiscal  sustainability;  (ii) \nprioritization of resource allocation; and (iii) effective use of resources for service delivery within \nthe  context  of \nreform,  and \ndecentralization. 3  The  IFAPER  concluded  that  it  had  become  increasingly  apparent  that \nweaknesses in PEFM not only had high costs in terms of allocative and operational efficiency in \nCambodia, but it has also created unacceptably high levels of fiduciary risk to public funds. The \nreport identified several weaknesses, including poor cash management, weak levels of budget \nexecution, and weak deficient accounting and reporting systems. Overall, Cambodia\u2019s financial \nmanagement  system  suffered  from  weak  control  (e.g.,  internal  and  external  audit).  The  report \nfound that, compared to other low-income countries, the PEFM system in Cambodia was below \naverage and needed to be improved. \n \n10. \nIn  response  to  the  above  findings,  the  Cambodian  Government,  in  partnership  with \ndevelopment  partners,  designed  a  platform  approach  to  reform  the  existing  PFM  system. \nPFMRP  was  established  as  a  10-year  reform  program.  At  the  aggregate  the  Public  Financial \nManagement  Reform  Program  (PFMRP)  platforms  have  been  designed  to  impact  two  key \nvisions of the Government. First, the Government has recognized that a strong PFM system is \nvital  to  achieving  the  objectives  identified  in  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (NPRS). \nSecond, the PFMRP will help Cambodia achieve international best practice in PFM, as defined \nthrough the adoption of 15 characteristics of an effective PFM system (based on adaptation of \nPublic  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  [PEFA]  PFM  performance  measurement \nframework).  The  PFMRP  adopts  a  platform  approach,  with  appropriate  sequencing.  Each \nindividual  platform  provides  a  clear  basis  for  launching  to  the  next  platform,  based  on  the \npremise that a certain level of PEFA competence is required to enable further progress to take \nplace  (diagram  at  page  59).  The  design  and  implementation  of  the  platform  approach  is \nconsistent with contemporary best practices for donor coordination.4 In Cambodia there are four \nplatforms. They aim to achieve the following objectives between 2005 and 2015: Platform 1 will \nintroduce a credible budget delivering predictable resources; platform 2 will ensure an improved \ninternal  control  environment  that  holds  managers  to  account;  platform  3  will  improve  the  link \nbetween  policy  priorities  and  budget  planning;  and  finally,  platform  4  will  ensure  integration  of \naccountability and review processes for both financial and performance management. To date, \nonly platform 1 has been rolled out (between 2005 and 2008). Platform 2 will be rolled out from \n2009 to 2011. \n \n11. \nExternal assessment of the design of the PFMRP in Cambodia considers the PFMRP to \nbe  credible.  Development  partners  agree  that  the  reform  program  has  moved  beyond  theory \ninto  concrete  implementation;  there  are  tangible  outputs.  Major  outputs  of  stage  1  of  the \n\n                                                 \n2  MEF.  2004  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program:  Strengthening  Governance  in  Cambodia  through \n\nEnhanced Public Financial Management.

PEFA  is  a  partnership  between  the  World  Bank,  IMF,  European \nCommission,  DFID,  Swiss  State  Secretariat  for  Economic  Affairs,  the  French  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  and  the \nStrategic Partnership with Africa. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nprogram  included  (i)  establishment  of  a  revenue  mobilization  strategy,  together  with  improved \nplanning  for  macroeconomic  context;  (ii)  improved  resource  flows  from  improved  revenue \ncollection  techniques  in  the  National  Treasury  (also  assisted  by  strong  economic  growth); \nimproved cash management and increased use of the banking system; (iii) incorporation of off-\nbudget revenues into the budget; (iv) implementation of a debt management function in MEF; (v) \nredesign of the chart of accounts and budget classification; (vi) initial design of a Government-\nwide  financial  management  information  system,  and  (vii)  completion  of  a  PFM  capacity \ndevelopment plan. \n\n12.  While much of the focus of stage 1 was on activities in MEF, line ministries also had a \nmajor role in the implementation of stage 1. The involvement of line ministries\u2014including MAFF, \nMOWRAM,  and  MRD\u2014in  stage  1  has  resulted  in  (i)  streamlining  the  commitments  and \npayments  system  (by  removing  prior  approval  from  MEF  for  salaries),  removing  ad-hoc \nprocurement  practices,  and  positioning  financial  controllers  to  selected  ministries);  (ii) \nconsolidation  of  ministries'  bank  accounts  in  the  Treasury  Single  Account  in  the  National \nTreasury  to  improve  cash  management  and  reduce  fiduciary  risks;  (iii)  reducing  ministries\u2019 \npayment arrears  to improve their ability to meet current year expenditures, (iv) deconcentration \nof procurement by introducing new purchasing procedures, including raising the thresholds for \nline  ministries  to  do  their  own  procurement  without  prior  MEF  approval,  (v)  introduction  of \ninternal  audit  units  in  line  ministries,  (vi)  introduction  of  program  budgeting  on  a  pilot  basis  in \nseven  ministries  (including  MAFF  and  MRD,  but  not  MOWRAM),  and  (vii)  introduction  of \nstrategic  budget  plans  in  the  budget  preparation  process  as  a  first  step  to  linking  budget \nplanning to policy priorities. \n\n13.  While there has been significant progress with the platform 1 objective (improved budget \ncredibility),  revenue  out-turns  are  now  within  5%  of  budget  estimates.  MAFF\u2019s  expenditure \nexecution  rate  increased  from  94%  to  97%  between  2005  and  2007,  MRD\u2019s  increased  from \n90%  to  93%,  and  MOWRAM\u2019s  increased  from  89%  to  93%.  Many  reforms,  particularly  at  the \nline ministry level, have had limited impact and may not be sustainable in the long term without \nreinforcement.5 For example, while 23 of 35 budget-funded agencies have established internal \naudit units, it is unclear which, if any, are producing quality audit reports. Furthermore, despite \nefforts  to  rationalize  the  number  of  Government  bank  accounts,  ministries  still  hold  a  large \nnumber of accounts (about 1,800). However, the rural development ministries hold few accounts. \nDuring the PFMRP platform 1 period of 2005\u20132007, budget planning was improved through the \nintroduction of budget strategic plans that link preparation of the budget to ministries\u2019 strategic \ngoals at a number of pilot ministries, including MAFF and MRD. Further improvements in budget \nplanning  will  be  introduced  during  platform  2  by  extending  the  use  of  the  medium-term \nexpenditure framework to most budget agencies and by including all donor-funded program and \nproject funding in the state budget from 2009.  \n\n14. \nIn planning for PFMRP stage 2, MEF has recognized the need for greater involvement of \nline ministries in the program in order to (i) meet the platform 2 objective of \u201cincreased financial \naccountability\u201d, and (ii) deepen the reforms that were introduced in platform 1. There will also be \na need to commence or strengthen activities which are prerequisites for platforms 3 and 4. The \nassistance to be provided under the PFMRDP will be directed at meeting these objectives. \n\n15.  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  have  been  brought  into  PFMRP  implementation  more \nclosely in platform 2 by including them (along with representatives of all other line ministries) on \n\n                                                 \n5 MEF. 2007.

Also, all line ministries will be required to prepare their own PFM \nministry action plan and a PFM capacity building plan. \n\nFurther  enhancements  of  platform  1  activities,  to  be  implemented  between  2008  and \n16. \n2010,  will  include  (i)  further  improvement  of  revenue  policy  and  collection  (It  is  expected  that \nministries  such  as  MAFF,  which  have  significant  non-tax  revenues,  should  review  and \nperiodically  adjust  the  rates  of  their  fees  and  charges);  (ii)  further  improvements  in  debt \nmanagement, including developing a debt-management strategy and legislation, and enhanced \nuse  of  the  debt-management  database;  (iii)  further  improvements  in  cash  management  and \nexpanded  use  of \nfurther \nimprovements  in  public  procurement,  including  implementation  of  procurement  rules  and \nregulations  and  standard  bidding  documents,  MEF  ex-post  monitoring  of  ministries\u2019 \nprocurements, and greater transparency of bidding opportunities. (All ministries will be required \nto participate in the further procurement reforms.)  \n\ntransactions;  and  (iv) \n\nthe  banking  system \n\nfor  Government \n\nOther  stage  2  activities  in  which  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  will  participate  are  (i) \n17. \nimproving accountability by defining appropriate financial responsibilities between management \nlevels  in  ministries  (and  between  levels  of  Government);  (ii)  implementing  the  new  economic \nand administrative classifications in the chart of accounts and budget classification by 2009 and \nthe new functional classification by 2010; (iii) improved and more frequent budget reporting; (iv) \nfurther  deepening  of  the  internal  audit  procedures  introduced  in  platform  1,  including  MEF \nquality control of internal audit reports; and (v) implementation of new financial arrangements at \nthe  subnational  level  pursuant  to  the  deconcentration  and  devolution  organic  law  passed  in \n2008. \n\n18. \nFurther  work  will  be  undertaken  in  preparation  of  activities  that  are  to  be  fully \nimplemented  in  platforms  3  and  4  from  2011  to  2015.  MRD  and  MAFF  as  pilot  ministries  for \nprogram budgeting will be required to review and amend their program structures and budgeting \nprocedures in light of lessons learned in platform 1. All ministries will be required to bring donor-\nfunded programs and projects into their budget preparation cycle to the greatest extent possible.  \n\n19. \nThe  PFMRP  recognizes  capacity  building  as  the  most  important  element  for  sustained \nsupport.  A  major  focus  of  platform  2  will  be  capacity  building  in  line  ministries  under  the  PFM \ncapacity  development  plan  prepared  by  the  Economics  and  Finance  Institute  of MEF  in  2007, \nand  approved  by  the  Government  as  the  blueprint  for  PFM  capacity  building  until  2010.  The \nplan provides for (i) extensive (up to 8,000 participants across the public sector) training in 33 \ndifferent PFM technical skills; (ii) broader skills development training (leadership, management); \nand  (iii)  new  human  resources  policies  (accelerated  advancement,  job  rotation,  overseas \nscholarships, and study tours). It is also proposed that the merit-based pay initiative be available \nto all line ministries to extend incentives to staff to improve their performance and to participate \nin the PFMRP. The capacity development proposed under PFMRDP will have synergy with the \nPFM capacity development plan of EFI.  \n\n20. \nCountry ownership has been the most significant feature of the PFMRP and the reform \nprocess  represents  a  number  of  sound  aid  management  practices,  including  common \npartnership principles, around a sector-wide approach that maximizes donor collaboration and \noptimizes transaction costs.  \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nC. \n\nDecentralization \n\nresponsibilities \n\nThe Government is pursuing a comprehensive program to reform the structure of roles \n21. \nand \nfiscal \narrangements for subnational levels. The program forms part of the good governance strategy \nof the National Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010. \n\nfor  subnational  administration  and \n\ninstitute  appropriate \n\nto \n\n22. \nIt is particularly important for efficient service delivery to the rural sector that appropriate \nlocal  administrative  arrangements  are  put  in  place.  Currently,  the  proportions  of  MRD,  MAFF, \nand  MOWRAM  staff  that  are  situated  in  provincial  departments  are  72%,  66%,  and  51% \nrespectively.  However,  significant  administrative  problems  have  been  found  to  exist  at \nsubnational levels.6 These include (i) budget execution rates are too low, (ii) shares of spending \n(relative to central offices) are too low, (iii) insufficient numbers of civil servants (despite the high \nproportions  noted  above),  and  (iv)  weak  institutional  capacity  at  provincial  and  lower  levels.  It \nwas also found that central offices of line ministries have little control of local budget planning, \npreparation, and execution (which are largely linked to governors\u2019 offices and provincial finance \ndepartments).  This  makes  it  extremely  difficult  to  implement  national  policy  mandates  through \nthe budget system.  \n\n23. \nIn March 2008 an organic law on subnational administration was passed by the National \nAssembly.  The  law  establishes  a  framework  for  (i)  instituting  three  levels  of  subnational \nadministration (provinces, municipalities or districts, and sangkats or communes) with elected or \nappointed councils (communes and sangkats are to be administered under the existing Law on \nthe  Administrative  Management  of  Communes  and  Sangkats  except  for  some  specific \nprovisions in the organic law); (ii) appointing boards of governors to act as both chief executives \nof the councils and supervisors of the provincial departments of national ministries; (iii) enabling \ncouncils to appoint their own staff, including an administration director and chief of finance; (iv) \nenabling councils to be responsible for their own financial administration, but with budgets to be \napproved by the governors and MEF, and (v) establishing a National Committee on Devolution \nand Deconcentration (NCDD) within the Ministry of Interior to review ministries\u2019 functions and to \ndetermine which functions are to be assigned or delegated to subnational levels. \n\n24. \nA  draft  law  on  subnational  finance  has  been  drafted  by  MEF.  This  draft  law  proposes \nthat council revenue sources include local taxes, fees and charges, and voluntary contributions. \nThe law also proposes that revenue will be provided to councils from national sources and will \ninclude  (i)  shared  revenues,  (ii)  conditional  and  unconditional  grants,  and  (iii)  agency  fees  for \nservices supplied on behalf of national agencies. A high-level interministerial working group has \nbeen  tasked  with  preparing  implementation  arrangements  for  the  D&D  organic  law.  it  is \nestimated that 32 new laws and decrees are required to implement the provisions of the D&D \nlaw). \n\n28. \nThe organic law provides a strong framework but leaves the detail of implementation to a \nlarge  number  (32)  of  further  laws,  decrees  and  sub-decrees.  A  high  level  officials\u2019  group  with \nrepresentation  from  most  ministries  is  developing  options  for  assigned  or  delegated  roles  and \nresponsibilities, appropriate fiscal arrangements and other implementation issues. It is expected \nthat  the  officials\u2019  group  will  continue  until  late  2008  or  early  2009.

NAA  is  a  key  player  in \nstrengthening  the  quality  of  financial  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  providing \nindependent  institutional  oversight  and  critical  checks  and  balances  in  the  management  of \npublic finances. As the supreme audit institution in Cambodia, the NAA forms a vital link in the \nchain  of  accountability.  An  effectively  functioning  NAA  can  be  a  powerful  force  to  combat \nfinancial malfeasance and a potent deterrent to waste and misuse of public funds.  \n\n \n27. \nto \nstrengthening  auditing  methodology,  auditing  procedures,  broader  coverage,  audit  planning, \n\nfurther  capacity  development \n\nthe  assessment \n\nis  essential \n\nOverall, \n\nthat \n\nis \n\n \n\nD. \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nand  audit  reporting.  Low  capacity  constrains  completion  of  planned  audits  and  results  in \nexcessive  delays.  Audit  reports  are  not  yet  published  regularly,  and  the  processes  for \nparliamentary and senate oversight of the NAA have not been clearly established. In view of this, \nthere  is  a  real  risk  that  NAA  may  not  be  able  to  reach  the  level  of  proficiency  and \nprofessionalism  expected  of  a  supreme  audit  institution  (SAI)  in  the  near  future.    Under  these \ncircumstances,  achievement  of  the  development  goals  of  NSDP  will  be  elusive  without  an \nimproved audit system. For the SAI to perform effectively, its institutional capabilities must be \nsound.  SAI's  mandate,  resources,  and  human  capacity  should  be  sufficient  to  undertake  its \nexpected  tasks,  and  independence  from  the  executive  should  be  guaranteed.  ADB  is  aware \nthat institutional strengthening and capacity building in NAA is a gradual process, and that NAA \nshould  be  assisted  in  developing  audit  capacity  in  a  multiyear  horizon.  Emphasis  should  be \ninitially on financial and compliance audits, gradually moving to performance audits. \n\n \n2. \n\nAudit Peer Review \n\n \n28. \nADB  will  specifically  encourage  and  assist  an  audit  peer  review  (APR)  of  NAA,  to  be \nundertaken by an independent SAI in 2009\u20132010, that will establish a clear baseline from which \nthe roadmap for long-term capacity development can be implemented. An international external \npeer  review  process  involves  a    team  of  external  counterparts  evaluating  the  SAI\u2019s  working \npractices, comparing them with best international practice. The fact that the peer review will be \ncarried out by an independent SAI will add credibility to the process and ensure that it has the \nfull acceptance of all stakeholders. NAA\u2019s commitment to improving its operations and quest to \ndeliver high quality auditing services is further reinforced by NAA agreeing to have this review \ncarried  out.  NAA  is  aware  that  its  image  and  reputation  as  an  effective  SAI  is  of  paramount \nimportance and realizes that the technical assistance support of its development partners is vital \nfor its success.  \n \n\n3. \n\nAudit Law and Assisting NAA in Drafting of Audit Subdecrees \n\n \n29. \nAll  of  the  essential  features  of  a  sound  and  independent  law  are  reflected  in  the  2000 \nAudit Law that established the NAA. The law requires the auditor general to report directly to the \nnational assembly and senate; the appointment of the auditor general requires a 51% majority \nof the national assembly; the auditor general has the authority to determine the salaries of NAA \naudit  staff;  the  law  extends  the  powers  of  the  auditor  general  to  conduct  audits  of  not  only  all \nGovernment  agencies,  provinces,  ministries,  state  enterprises,  and  public  authorities  but  also \nprivate enterprises and NGO\u2019s that receive tax concessions from the Government, suppliers of \ngoods and services to the Government under contracts and expenditures on loan projects; the \nrank of the auditor general is equivalent to that of a senior minister; NAA has its own separate \nfinancial budget; NAA is empowered to conduct financial, performance, and compliance audits; \nthe appointments of the auditor general and deputy auditor generals are restricted to two terms \nof 5 years each; reports issued by the auditor general are deemed to be public documents. \n \n30. \nHowever,  there  are  areas  where  audit  law  can  be  improved  and  strengthened.  These \nrelate to strengthening the independence of NAA, and establishing interfaces between the NAA \nand  other  Government  agencies  that  form  a  link  in  the  chain  of  accountability.  A  new  audit \nsubdecree  will  be  required  to  clarify  NAA\u2019s  mandate  to  address  these  shortcomings.  ADB  will \nassist  in  the  drafting  of  the  implementing  subdecrees  under  the  audit  law  of  2000.  The \nsubdecree will need to look into the following: deadlines for preparation and submission of the \naudited  financial  statements  and  budget  settlement  accounts  to  the  national  assembly;  NAA\u2019s \nrole  in  the  context  of  ongoing  reforms  in  financial  management  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration;  the  relationship  between  the  NAA  and  the  Commission  of  Finance,  Banking \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n61 \n\nand Audit (CFBA) of parliament and the senate; a more objective and transparent process for \nidentifying  suitable  candidates  for  the  position  of  auditor  general  and  deputy  auditor  general; \nstrengthening article 19 of the law relating to holding positions in any political party; the process \nfor  tabling  and  publishing  audit  reports;  the  provisions  of  the  law  relating  to  restriction  of \ndisclosure  of  information  contrary  to  public  interest;  the  process  of  selecting  an  independent \nauditor;  and  the  interface  between  internal  audit  and  the  NAA.  The  subdecree  will  serve  as  a \nbasis to clarifying definition of the processes, procedures, and organizational interfaces for NAA; \nstrengthening the independence of the NAA; and improving communication between the various \nexternal agencies and the institutions the NAA deals with. \n \n\n4. \n\nImproved Interface between Internal Audit and NAA \n\n \n31.  Member countries of International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) \nhave  underscored  the  key  role  supreme  audit  institutions  play  in  (i)  establishing  internal  control \nstandards, (ii) creating a solid internal control framework, (iii) working with internal auditors, and (iv) \nevaluating internal controls as an integral part of both their financial and performance audits.7 In \nCambodia, a key and unique feature of the audit law is the requirement that each ministry, state-\nowned  enterprise,  and  Government  agency  establishes  an  internal  audit  department  and \nsubmits copies of all internal audit reports to the NAA. An internal audit subdecree was issued \non  15  February  2005,  and  since  then  24  ministries  have  established  internal  audit  offices. \nHowever, no effective interaction and knowledge sharing takes place between the internal audit \noffices and NAA.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAudit of Externally Aided Projects \n\n \n32. \nIt is necessary to strengthen NAA's capacity to effectively audit donor-financed projects \nto  ensure  effective  project  implementation  and  minimize  fiduciary  risks.  To  date  only  four  loan \nproject  audits  have  been  undertaken  of  the  37  ADB,  26  World  Bank, 33 bilateral,  five \nOrganization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC), and four International Fund for Agriculture \nDevelopment  (IFAD)-funded  projects.  Significant  funds  are  being  expended  on  these  projects, \nwhich  have  not  been  subject  to  adequate  audit  coverage  because  of  a  lack  of  capacity.  The \nnature  of  these  projects  makes  them  vulnerable  to  procurement  irregularities  and  financial \nmismanagement.  The  slow  pace  of  project  implementation  continues  to  be  an  issue  for  the \nmajority  of  ADB-  and  World  Bank-funded  projects.  Poor  project  preparation;  insufficient \nadvanced actions; slow start-up; delays in procurement; lack of competency in applying project \nmanagement, procurement, and contract management principles; and delays in and recruitment \nof  unsuitable  consultants  and  project  staff  continue  to  hamper  the  effectiveness  of  major \nprograms  and  projects.  Despite  a  new  subdecree  issued  on  26  February  2007  to  comply  with \nStandard  Operating  Procedures  (SOPs),  the  Procurement  Manual  (PM),  and  the  Financial \nManagement Manual (FMM), compliance is not satisfactory because of a lack of experience and \ntechnical capability. There is therefore an urgent need to assist NAA to build capacity in this area \nand to undertake effective auditing of these projects, thus adding value both to the donors and to \nthe Government\u2019s objectives for development and capital infrastructure spending.  \n\n                                                 \n7  INTOSAI's general and detailed standards are reiterated in chapters II and III. To help achieve control objectives and \nan  orderly  and  effective  internal  control  structure,  INTOSAI's  internal  control  guidelines  provide  detailed  standards \ncovering  (i)  documentation,  (ii)  prompt  and  proper  recording  of  transactions  and  events,  (iii)  authorization  and \nexecution of transactions and events, (iv) separation of duties, (v) supervision, and (v) access to and accountability for \nresources and records. \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \nGrant \n \n\nADF \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Cambodia/Public Financial Management for Rural Development \n\nProject/Sector/Multitranche  Financing  Facility/ \nPolicy-Based, Others (please specify) \nProgram Grant \n \n\n \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nSoutheast Asia Department/ \nGovernance,  Finance,  and  Trade \nDivision \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nCambodia\u2019s  high  income  poverty  and  non-inclusive  growth  makes  it  one  of  the  poorest  countries  of  the  world,  resulting  in \ninequalities  that  are  deep-seated  and  most  pronounced  in  the  urban\u2013rural  divide.  The  upside  is  that  according  to  the  2004 \nNational Socio-Economic Survey and a number of specially commissioned studies, there has been a steady decline in poverty \nin Cambodia since the end of the civil war. The percentage of Cambodians living below the poverty line fell from an estimated \n47% in 1994 to about 35% in 2004 (source: Asian Development Bank, 2007, Country Strategy and Program Midterm Review, \nCambodia 2005\u20132009).a However, over the same period Cambodia has witnessed a sharp rise in income inequality, and an \nincreasing gap between the rich and the poor. Despite a marked decline in the poverty level during the period 1994\u20132004, a \nWorld  Bank  poverty  assessment  in  2006  (Cambodia:  Halving  Poverty  by  2015)b  highlighted  the  growing  incidence  of  rural \npoverty. The rise in consumption inequality has been attributed to the uneven spread of economic growth across Cambodia, \naccording  to  the  World  Bank  report  Sharing  Growth:  Equity  and  Development  in  Cambodia  (2007)c.  Cambodia  lags  behind \nmany developing countries on several human development indexes due in part to limited access to roads, markets, and basic \nservices by rural residents (which comprise  90% of Cambodia\u2019s  poor). Cambodia faces  daunting challenges in its efforts to \nachieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  It  is  ranked  129th  out  of  177  countries  in  the  United  Nations  (UN) \nHuman  Development  Report  (2006).  The  human  poverty  index,  which  looks  beyond  income  deprivation,  similarly  ranks \nCambodia 73rd among 102 developing countries. This signifies that the country is probably not on track in many critical areas \nof  food  security,  poverty  reduction,  and  sustainable  social  and  economic  development.  There  is  a  need  for  fundamental \ninstitutional and policy changes if the country is to achieve the goal of halving poverty by 2015. Given these socioeconomic \nindicators, the Government of Cambodia continues to list rural development and improving the lives of the rural poor as its top \npriorities.  The  Government  launched  the  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  (PFMRP)  in  December  2004.  This \nProgram  aims  to  establish  a  strong  public  financial  management  (PFM)  system  that  will  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy. \n \nContribution  of  the  Sector  or  Subsector  to  Poverty  Reduction  in  Cambodia.  PFM  reforms  help  reduce  poverty  by \nenhancing the effectiveness of public expenditures and improving public spending efficiency and accountability. Robust PFM \nmechanisms  improve  allocative  efficiency  and  the  investment  climate.  PFM's  impact  on  economic  growth  is  significant,  as \ngood  PFM  practices  promote  pro-poor  growth  by  directing  public  expenditures  to  the  rural  development  sector.  Identifying \npoverty-reducing spending in the budget and providing commensurate resources require appropriate policies and institutions. \nThe  national  budget  is  therefore  the  principal  vehicle  for  efficient  resource  management.  To  make  a  dent,  an  efficient  and \nfunctional financial management system should raise, allocate, and spend adequate resources for programs that strengthen \nthe  human  capital  of  the  poor,  provide  for  their  physical  security,  and  ensure  adequate  public  infrastructure  to  facilitate \neconomic growth\u2014and hence reduce poverty. \n \nPFM  and  Rural  Development.  Implementation  of  poverty  reduction  measures  requires  a  realistic  budget  and  adequate \nallocation of resources. The National Strategic Development Plan regards rural development as a major crosscutting issue, \ncovering health, education, agriculture, water, sanitation, etc. Promotion of economic growth policies, leading to increased per \ncapita  income  of  the  rural  household  (who  are  proportionally  poorer  than  urban  dwellers  in  Cambodia)  will  be  realized  by \novercoming  binding  constraints  in  these  sectors.  Improvements  in  the  operational  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  ministries \ndealing with rural development will lead to timely and predictable release of funds to all targeted beneficiaries. This in turn will \ndirectly support the effectiveness of reforms aimed at improving rural growth prospects. For example, budget execution rates \nfor pro-poor sectors will increase, as will the value for money of spending for scarce resources. At the same time, strong PFM \nsystems  strengthen  accountability  of  service  providers  to  targeted  beneficiaries  by  rationalizing  expenditure  policy,  and \nenhance financial accountability by reducing fiduciary risks to public funds. As such, reform of PFM is key to reducing rural \npoverty and for promoting more equitable growth trajectories in Cambodia. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nAll  elements  of  the  PFMRDP  are  concerned  with  strengthening  the  national  PFM  system  and,  as  suggested  above,  reform \nmeasures supported by this Program do not have a direct impact on poverty. Public financial management reforms contribute \nindirectly  to  poverty  reduction.  Specifically,  they  improve  the  effectiveness  of  service  delivery  in  rural  development  and \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n63 \n\nimprove expenditure management and control mechanisms, thereby contributing to the Government\u2019s strategy for enhancing \ngrowth, generating employment, and reducing poverty. Therefore, no direct social impacts are expected from the program. On \nthe  other  hand,  indirect  social  impacts  are  significant,  manifested  in  improvements  in  the  quality  and  quantity  of  public \nservices  and  improved  governance  resulting  from  more  transparent  and  accountable  management  of  public  resources. \nTherefore, no adverse impacts requiring mitigating measures have been identified. In light of this, no specific poverty analysis \nis required or appropriate for s system-development investment of this type. \n \n\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nC. Social Issues \n \nThere is no foreseen social risk associated with the Program. Indirect social impacts include: improvement in the quality and \nquantity of public services and improved governance through more transparent, predictable, and accountable management of \npublic resources. The Program has been assigned category C in terms of impact on indigenous people. \n \nD.   Environmental Aspects \n \nNo environmental issues or concerns that result from the activities under this Program. \n \nE.  Consultation and Participation \n \n While formal stakeholder analysis or a participation strategy was not produced as a discrete output, the scope of the Program \nwas conceptualized and formulated based on extensive formal and informal stakeholder consultations. However, as a part of \nthe processing for the grant support, extensive consultations were held  with a  wide range of stakeholders, including central \nministries and development partners. \n \nF.  Gender and Development \n \nThe  envisaged  program  design  indicates  that  there  will  be  no  negative  impact  on  women.  The  PFM  outcome  will  promote \ninclusive  growth,  and  will  identify  gender-responsive  policy  changes,  based  on  assessment  and  feedback  during  the \nimplementation process. \n \n\nIII.

The  project \nactivities  will  assist  to  implement  activities  under  the  Public  Financial  Management  Reform \nProgram (PFMRP) consolidated action plan and ministry action plans. Specific project activities \nrelating  to  budget  planning  and  execution\u2014including  procurement,  budget  accounting,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation\u2014will build upon capacity development recommendations made under \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA).  A  capacity  development  plan \nformulated by the Economic and Finance Institute for stage 2 of the PFMRP will be tied to the \npublic  policy  training  initiative  under  the  upcoming  regional  TA.  Outputs  will  be  training, \nworkshops,  mentor  support,  manuals,  and  guidance  notes.  Change  management, \norganizational improvements will be major training focus.  \n \n3. \nComponent  2:  Strengthening  Capacity  for  Internal  Auditing  in  Ministry  of \nEconomy  and  Finance;  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology;  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Forestry,  and Fisheries; and Ministry of Rural Development. In implementing \nactivities  for  internal  audit  under  PFMRP,  and  building  on  the  internal  audit  training  plan \ndeveloped under ADB TA (CAM:4988), this component will provide assistance in the form of on-\nthe-job training, workshops, and seminars; preparation of manuals; drafting of procedures and \nreporting  formats;  preparation  of  reports;  field  audits;  ensuring  compliance  with  standard \noperating procedures; drafting procurement manuals and the financial management manual for \ndonor-assisted projects; etc.  \n \n4. \nComponent  3:  Strengthening  Debt  Management.  This  component  will  assist  in  (i) \nreviewing  the  legal  framework  of  debt  management,  (ii)  drafting  the  debt-management \nsubdecree,  (iii)  preparing  a  debt-management  strategy,  and  (iv)  training  in  the  use  of  debt \ndatabases  and  other  debt  management  procedures.  Training  and  workshops  and  regular \nmentor  support  will  be  provided.  Project  will  contribute  to  improvements  in  the  system  for \ncapturing and analyzing information on capita spending of all investment projects by assisting in \ndesigning, installing and training in  a portfolio management database. \n \n5. \nComponent  4:  Strengthening  the  Effectiveness  of  the  National  Audit  Authority. \nAssistance  will  be  provided  to  the  National  Audit  Authority  (NAA)  in  the  form  of  training  and \nworkshops,  preparation  of  manuals,  drafting  of  procedures,  and  reporting  formats  for \nstrengthening capacity to undertake externally assisted loan project audits. Support to NAA for \nseconding auditors to one of the regional supreme audit institutions for peer learning, especially \nfocusing  on  audit  of  externally  assisted  projects  will  be  provided  by  ADB.  The  NAA  will  be \nassisted in drafting audit subdecrees for implementation of the Audit Law and operationalizing \nthe  institutional  arrangement  between  NAA  and  internal  audit  departments,  following  from  the \nprovisions in the 2000 Audit Law. Other outputs will be supporting NAA to coordinate an audit \npeer review and resultant recommendations, and organizing an open forum in 2009 or 2010 for \nhigh-level exchange of information and audit experiences for policy dialogue, with participation \nof selected stakeholders. Study tours will also be supported. \n\n                                                 \n1 Project  components  1,  2,  and  4  will  implement  recommendations  of  ADB.  2007.
