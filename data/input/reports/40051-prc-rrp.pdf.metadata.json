An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment  undertaken  for  each  of  the  investment  components  under  the \nProject. A regional environmental impact assessment (REIA) was \nundertaken  for  Southern  Baiyin  industrial  zone  (SBIZ).  The \nsummary EIA was circulated to the Board of Directors of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and uploaded on the ADB website on \n29 June 2007. \n   \nProject Description  Baiyin  city  (Baiyin)  is  a  medium-sized  city  located  in  Gansu \nprovince. The city was established in 1950s under the planned \neconomy mainly to support copper mining production. Baiyin used \nto be the top copper miner of the PRC, accounting for one third of \nthe national production. After continued exploitation, the copper \nmines in Baiyin had been exhausted and were abandoned. Mining \nof  the  other  associated  minerals  is  also  on a  declining  trend. \nBaiyin is one of the 18 mining cities classified by the Government \nas resource-exhausted. Under the 11th Five- Year Program (FYP) \nfor 2006\u20132010, the Government has decided to provide special \nsupport, as a national priority, for the resource-exhausted mining \ncities to facilitate their economic transformation. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  support  to  facilitate  economic \ntransformation  in  Baiyin  by  strengthening  urban  services  and \ninfrastructure, and promoting capacity development. The Project \nhas five components: (i) Southern Baiyin infrastructure, (ii) Baiyin \nroad improvements, (iii) Pingchuan road improvements, (iv) Baiyin \ndistrict  heating  services,  and  (v)  capacity  cevelopment  and \ninstitutional strengthening. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nUrban Sector Strategy and the strategic focus of ADB operation in \nPRC as identified and discussed with the Government during the \nongoing country partnership strategy consultation process. All the \ninvestment  components  under  the  project  are  included  in  the \nBaiyin Urban Development Master Plan (2001\u20132020) endorsed by \nthe Baiyin People\u2019s Congress. \n   ", "ii   \nRationale  Baiyin is one of the 18 mining cities classified by the Government \nas resource-exhausted. In PRC, Baiyin stands for a new model of \neconomic transformation from a resource-exhausted mining city \ninto a new industrial center through technology upgrading and \nextension, and diversification of the existing production chains. \nADB  involvement  in  the  Project  will  provide  not  only  financial \nsupport needed to accelerate economic transformation, but also \ninternational knowledge and policy advice for the Baiyin municipal \ngovernment  (BMG)  to  help  ensure  that  the  economic \ntransformation  will  be  accomplished  in  a  sustainable  and \nenvironment-friendly manner. The Project will also play a role in \ndemonstrating  economic  transformation  for  other  resource-\nexhausted mining cities. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be the sustainable and environment- \nfriendly urban development of Baiyin. The outcome will be the \nfacilitated economic transformation and improved quality of life in \nBaiyin. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The total project cost is estimated at $161.53 million equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties of $4.7 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan   \nAmount \nSource  % \n($ million equivalent) \nAsian Development Bank Loan  80.00     49.5 \nDomestic Bank  12.08       7.5 \nBaiyin Municipal Government  55.48     34.3 \nPingchuan District Government    5.59       3.5 \nMinyue District Heating Corporation    8.38       5.2 \n                        Total             161.53   100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nThe Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $80 \nmillion to finance 49.5% of the project cost, including financing \ncharges  during  construction.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nbalance through a combination of BMG and Pingchuan district \ngovernment (PDG) budget resources, domestic loans from PRC \nbanks,  and  equity  investment  from  Minyue  District  Heating \nCorporation (MDHC). \n   \nThe ADB loan of $80 million will be provided from the ordinary \ncapital  resources  under  its  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n   ", "  iii\nAllocation and Relending  The Government of PRC will relend the loan proceeds to the \nTerms  Gansu  provincial  government,  which  will  onlend  to  BMG,  the \nExecuting Agency, on the same terms and conditions as those of \nthe ADB loan. Relevant portions of the loan proceeds will be \nfurther onlent, on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB  loan,  by  BMG  to  PDG  and  MDHC,  the  implementing \nagencies  (IAs),  for  the  Pingchuan  district  road  improvements \ncomponent and district heating Services component, respectively. \nAs the end-borrowers BMG, PDG, and MDHC will assume, for \ntheir relevant portions of the loan proceeds, the foreign exchange \nand interest variation risks of the ADB loan.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Baiyin Municipal Government \n   \nImplementation  BMG has established a project leading group (PLG), headed by \nArrangements  the mayor to direct the Project and provide policy guidance during \nproject implementation. Under the PLG, BMG has set up a project \nmanagement office (PMO) to coordinate the implementation of \nproject  activities  on  behalf  of  BMG.  The  PMO  will  (i)  ensure \nadequate  interdepartmental  and  interagency  coordination,  (ii) \nmonitor  the  progress  of  project  implementation,  and  (iii) \ncoordinate communication with ADB and the agencies concerned. \n \nThere are four IAs for the Project: (i) Baiyin High-Tech Industrial \nPark  (BHTIP)  Management  Commission,  responsible  for \nimplementing the Southern Baiyin infrastructure component; (ii) \nBaiyin  City  Construction  Bureau  (BCCB),  responsible  for \nimplementing the Baiyin road improvements component; (iii) PDG, \nresponsible for implementing the Pingchuan road improvements \ncomponent;  and  (iv)  MDHC,  responsible  for  implementing  the \ndistrict heating services component. Among the four, BHTIP and \nBCCB are part of the BMG. PDG is a local government unit under \nthe jurisdiction of BMG. MDHC is a state share-controlled public-\nprivate  corporation.  A  project  implementation  unit  will  be \nestablished in each IA and will report to the respective IA for \nundertaking detailed implementation activities. \n   \nProcurement  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  shall  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive  bidding, \nnational competitive bidding, or shopping procedures will be used, \ndepending on the circumstances of each contract package. \n   \n ", "iv   \nConsulting Services  About 18 person-months of international and 116 person-months \nof national consulting services will be provided for the capacity \ndevelopment  and  institutional  strengthening  component.  The \nconsultants  will  help  BMG  (i)  design  and  establish  an \nenvironmental management system for the SBIZ, (ii) develop a \ngeographic information system-based urban management system \nto improve urban planning and road and bridge management, and \n(iii)  provide  project  management  and  construction  supervision \nsupport.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  more  than  475,000  urban \nBeneficiaries  presidents  in  the  project  areas  through  construction  of  urban \ninfrastructure for economic transformation, improved urban roads, \nand expanded and enhanced district heating supply. The Project \nwill provide the infrastructure and consulting service inputs to help \nBMG manage and accomplish the economic transformation in a \nsustainable and environment-friendly manner. When completed, \nthe SBIZ is expected to provide more than 5,400 permanent jobs \nfor skilled laborers whose jobs are being affected by the decline of \nthe mining resources.  \n \nThrough the district heating services component, the Project will \nreplace 63 small polluting coal-fire heating boilers with a more \nefficient  and  environment-friendly  centralized  district  heating \nsystem. By the year 2015, the heating service area will expand by \n2.6 million square meters and benefit about 20,000 households \namong whom about 10% are low-income families. The district \nheating services component will also help reduce the emission of \nsulfur dioxide by 185 tons per year, reduce consumption of coal \nby 5,700 tons per year, and improve public health and indoor air \nquality by eliminating numerous indoor coal-burning stoves and \nswitching to district heating, particularly for the poor.  \n \nThe road improvement components will build up the basic urban \nroad frameworks in the two urban centers of Baiyin\u2014Baiyin and \nPingchuan districts\u2015to meet their long-term development needs. \nThe improved road systems will help strengthen public transport \nservice  and  improve  road  safety  by  providing  public  transport \nfacilities, increasing bus lines, and reducing the road accident \nfatalities in 2011 by about 10% from the 2005 baseline. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks. \nConventional  engineering  designs  and  technology  with  proven \nrecords of reliable performance are adopted for all the investment \ncomponents. Consulting services will be provided to support the \nPMO and IAs to ensure timely implementation of the Project in \naccordance with the design requirements and quality standards. \n \n ", "  v\nThe risk may arise from the induced environmental impact due to \nthe intensified industrial activities in the SBIZ. To mitigate the risk \nin a systematic manner, BMG has undertaken a REIA to assess \nthe environmental impact from the industrial activities in both the \nexisting BHTIP and the SBIZ to be developed under the Project. \nAn environmental management plan (EMP) has been developed \nunder the REIA to mitigate the identified environmental risks. In \naddition to the EMP, consulting services will be provided to help \nBMG design and introduce an urban environmental management \nsystem to ensure that the urban economic transformation will be \nconducted and accomplished in a sustainable and environment- \nfriendly manner. \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "o107  00'E GANSU BAIYINN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTIN THEOPLE' REPUBLIC OF CHINA Huan Huachi Qingyang Heshuio36  00'N ZhenyuanQingGaozhaiPingliangZhengningNingLuohandongChongxinJingchuto HuatingXi'aLingtain SHAANXI o107  00'E ooMONGOLIAXINJIANG96  00'E106  00'EUYGURAUTONOMOUSREGION INNER    MONGOLIA oo40  00'N40  00'NYumen Zhangye GANSU NINGXIAWuweio33  00'NBaiyin QINGHAIPingliangLANZHOULinxiaSHAANXITianshuioo34  00'N34  00'N oo96  00'E106  00'ESICHUAN\nA E hui\no103  00'EINNER  MONGOLIA URB PJingtaiZizhixian YongdengPingchuan JingyuanBaiyinHongguGaolanNINGXIA AnningLANZHOUYongjingXiguDongxiang YuzhongChankouZizhixianPingfengHuiningLinxiaQiliheDingxiGuangheLinxia JingningHezhengKangleLintaoHoujiachuanZhuanglangXiaheWeiyuanTongweiGANSUHezuoZhangjiachuanLongxiQinanLintanZhang QingsGanguWushanLuquZhuoniTianshuiBeidaoMinHonghe LixianDiebuKuanchuanYanchangKihe XiheLiangdangEr'ling ChuanguChengxianHuixianChangheba SijiabaSICHUANWangguanWuduBaihegouKangxianTianchiGanjiangbaRailway RiverYangbaZhaojiabaWenCounty Boundary Prefecture Boundary Provincial Boundary International Boundary undaries are not necessarily authoritative.o103  00'E\no\nB\nI\nA\nH\nG\nQIN N 5075100 meters Maqu Project City Project District Provincial Capital City/Town County Seat National Road Provincial Road\no\nKil\n5\n2\n0\nN N\n0' 0'\n0 0\no6   o3  \n3 3\n07-1970 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Gansu Baiyin Urban Development Project. \n \n2.  The Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help strengthen the \nurban  sustainability  of  Baiyin  City  (Baiyin)  in  Gansu  province,  by  facilitating  the  economic \ntransformation of this resource-exhausted mining city. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nMedium-Term Strategy (2006-2008) and Urban Sector Strategy.1 This report is based on the \nresults  of  the  Loan  Appraisal  Mission,  as  well  as  discussions  with  the  central  and  local \ngovernments, relevant agencies, and community organizations.2 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Since the PRC initiated economic reforms in 1978, rapid urbanization has accompanied \nsignificant economic progress. The urban population has nearly tripled from about 190 million in \n1980 to more than 560 million in 2005, and now accounts for more than 43% of the national \npopulation. The Government\u2019s agenda for economic reform and social development aims to \naccelerate urbanization and to achieve a balanced development of the large and medium-sized \ncities as well as the small cities and towns. Consequently, the urban population is expected to \nreach 47% of the total population by 2010, thereby increasing the demand for urban services.3 \nThe increasing urban population, industrialization, and economic development are straining the \noverloaded infrastructure, and contributing to widespread pollution and environmental threats in \nPRC  cities.  Without  significant  investment,  the  urban  environment  will  degrade,  economic \ndevelopment will be encumbered, and the people\u2019s quality of life will deteriorate. \n \n4.  Within the urban sector, PRC has identified 118 cities that were developed, depending \non mining of particular natural resources of their localities. They account for 18% of the total \ncities in the PRC and provide livelihood for a total urban population of 154 million. Many of these \nmining cities are located in the remote and less developed western PRC. They share a very \nsimilar history and common characteristics: (i) they were established in the 1950s or 1960s \nunder the planned economy with sole responsibility for supporting mining production, with little \nattention  given  to  urban  sustainability;  (ii)  in  the  past,  the  state  through  central  planning \nallocated all their outputs  for national development, leaving little resources for local investments \non urban development; and (iii) the natural resources they depend on are now diminishing or \nare being exhausted after decades of mining production. As a consequence, most of these \nmining  cities  have  encountered  great  difficulties  in  the  urbanization  process  due  to  their \nremoteness, their imbalanced economic structures, their limited financial capacity, their poor \nurban infrastructure, and their limited development prospects. Of those cities, 47 are under \nthreat of resource exhaustion, and 18 are classified as resource-exhausted cities, thereby \nposing a special challenge to urbanization in the PRC. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

These include abandoning the \ntown  when  mining  becomes  uneconomical,  converting  the  abandoned  mines  and  mining \nfacilities  into  a  museum  or  cultural  heritage  sites  that  may  have  an  educational  and \nentertainment function while providing livelihood for a small population, or developing alternative \nindustries in the nonmining sectors as the new engine for continued growth and sustainable \ndevelopment. Given their sizes and the populations they support, most of these mining cities in \nthe PRC would have to explore the possibilities to develop alternative industries for sustainable \ndevelopment.  Under  the  11th  Five-Year  Program  (FYP)  for  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment  (2006\u20132010),  the  Government  has  decided  to  provide  special  support,  as  a \nnational priority, for these resource-exhausted cities to facilitate their economic transformation \nfrom the traditional mining bases established under the planned economy into dynamic and \nsustainable urban centers under a market economy. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  Project Background. Baiyin is a medium-sized city in Gansu province, one of the 12 \nless developed western provinces and autonomous regions targeted by the Government for \nsupport under the National Strategy for Development of the West (NSDW). Like many other \nmining cities, Baiyin was established in the 1950s under the planned economy, mainly to \nsupport the development and production of Baiyin Nonferrous Metal Corporation (BNMC), which \nused to be the PRC\u2019s top copper mine, accounting for about one third of national copper \nproduction. Over the past 50 years, Baiyin has been developed into an important national center \nfor nonferrous metal mining, smelting, and initial processing, and an energy and chemical \nproduction center of Gansu province. Baiyin now covers a total land area of 21,158 square \nkilometers (km2) and has a population of 1.75 million (2005). Most of the land under the \njurisdiction of the Baiyin municipal government (BMG) are uncultivated and undeveloped arid \nland without any human settlement. Baiyin has two urban districts: (i) Baiyin district, which has a \nland area of 1,373 km2, a population of about 279,000, and where the BMG is seated; and (ii) \nPingchuan district with a land area of 2,106 km2 and a population of about 196,300. The two \nurban districts are about 78 kilometers (km) apart. They are connected by a newly constructed \nexpressway that is well-integrated with the surrounding national and provincial expressway \nsystems, most of which have been built as part of the NSDW.  \n \n7.  Rapid development of the basic infrastructures in the west, supported under the NSDW \nover the past few years, has provided Baiyin, which used to be geographically remote and \nrelatively isolated, with the basic means to integrate itself with the national and world market \nthrough  road,  railway,  air  transport,  and  telecommunication  services.  Investors  have  been \nattracted to this mining city by its advantages including adequate supply of skilled labors, low-\ncost land, and its easy access to both market and resources. Such advantages have resulted in \na steady gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 11.4% a year during the 10th FYP \nperiod (2001\u20132005) and a reduction in the proportion of the people living below the government \npoverty line from 12.4% to 10.8%.    \n \n8.  Along with continued growth of mining production, the carrying capacity of Baiyin\u2019s urban \ninfrastructure  has  been  stretched  to  its  limit,  leading  to  severe  environmental  and  social \ndevelopment problems that affect not only the living standards of the city dwellers but also its \ndevelopment prospects. The most acute challenge to future development of Baiyin is the urgent \nneed to diversify its economic base in view of the diminishing mining resources after decades of \nexploitation.  The  two  main  copper  mines  of  BNMC  have  already  been  exhausted  and \nabandoned.  Mining  of  the  other  associated  minerals  is  also  on  the  decline,  with  closure \n ", "3 \nprojected in less than two decades. Thousands of highly skilled workers are looking for new \nemployment opportunities to survive.  \n \n9.  To  set  the  direction  for  long-term  development  of  Baiyin,  BMG  conducted  a \ncomprehensive study in 2001 to formulate the Baiyin Urban Development Master Plan (2001\u2013\n2020). By careful examination of the local advantages, the study has identified the potential of \nthe city to develop into a diversified economic center for sustained growth through economic \ntransformation.  Based  on  the  master  plan,  BMG  has  identified  nonferrous  metal  industry, \nelectricity power, coal mining, and chemical industry\u2015four leading industries\u2015as the engines \nfor sustained economic growth, which are further supported by eight supporting industries \nincluding rare earth, fine chemical, new energy, agroprocessing, and tourism (Appendix 2). \n \n10.  BMG has recognized that success in economic transformation needs the joint effort of \nthe public and private sectors and should be based on local advantages and market forces. In \nthis context, BMG has developed a partnership with the enterprises and industrial investors \nthrough  which  BMG  will  make  an  initial  investment  (including  providing  the  basic  public \ninfrastructure  and  the  industrial  land)  to  provide  an  enabling  environment  for  economic \ntransformation, while the enterprises and the industrial investors will make industrial investment \nto upgrade technology and to diversify and extend the existing production chains. Through this \nmechanism, with support from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, BMG has achieved initial \nsuccess in establishing the Baiyin High-Tech Industrial Park (BHTIP) as the platform to foster \neconomic  diversification  and  transformation.  Since  2003,  the  BHTIP  has  attracted  43  new \nenterprises, most of which are privately owned or jointly owned by the public and private \ninvestors, that have made $436 million in investments and created 1,850 permanent jobs. Given \nthe initial success of the BHTIP, a pipeline of new applicant enterprises has been developed \nwaiting for new industrial land. Encouraged by the promising potential, BMG has decided to \ndevelop  the  Southern  Baiyin  industrial  zone  (SBIZ)  in  accordance  with  the  Baiyin  Urban \nDevelopment Master Plan (2001\u20132020). The SBIZ has an approved land area of 14.05 km2 \ncomprising the BHTIP (8.05 km2) and another 6 km2 of new industrial land to be developed \nunder the Project. The SBIZ is expected to be the home of the extended industrial production \nchains in the fields of nonferrous metal materials, fine chemicals, new energy materials, and \nagroprocessing. \n \n11.  In addition, BMG has decided to make further investments to strengthen and upgrade \nthe basic urban infrastructure of the city, particularly to strengthen the road systems in the two \nurban districts and to expand the district heating service in Baiyin district. The investments in the \nroad systems will help the two urban districts to each complete a basic urban road framework to \nsupport its long term urban development needs up to 2030. Heating is one of the essential \nsocial services during winter in northern PRC. The investment for expanding the district heating \nservice will significantly improve the quality of life of the people of Baiyin district by providing \nreliable  and  cleaner  heating  service  through  a  centralized  district  heating  system.  The \ncentralized system will replace the unreliable, low-efficiency, and polluting small community \ncoal-fire heating boilers, which are a major source of air pollution during winter. \n \n12.  Project Rationale. Resource dependent mining cities established under the planned \neconomy form a special vulnerable group of cities in the rapid urbanization process of the PRC. \nAn established national priority under the 11th FYP is to provide special support for these \nmining cities to facilitate their economic transformation. Baiyin is one of the 18 cities classified \nby the Government as resource-exhausted. In the PRC, Baiyin stands for a new model of \neconomic transformation from a resource-exhausted mining city into a new industrial center \nthrough  a  well  functioning  public  and  private  partnership  for  technology  upgrading  and \n ", "4 \nextension,  and  diversification  of  the  existing  production  chains.  The  Project  will  serve  a \ndemonstration role for economic transformation of the other resource-exhausted mining cities. \nMore detailed analyses of PRC urbanization and Baiyin\u2019s strategy for economic transformation \nare in Appendix 2. \n \n13.  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Urban Sector Strategy and the strategic focus of \nADB operations in PRC as identified and discussed with the Government during the ongoing \ncountry partnership strategy consultation process. All the investment components of the Project \nare included in the Baiyin Urban Development Master Plan (2001-2020) endorsed by the Baiyin \nPeople\u2019s Congress. ADB involvement in the Project will provide not only the financial support \nneeded to accelerate economic transformation, but also international knowledge and policy \nadvice for BMG to help ensure that the economic transformation will be accomplished in a \nsustainable and environmentally friendly manner.    \n \n14.  Policy Dialogue. The integrated nature of the Project enables ADB to further its ongoing \npolicy dialogue with the Government on urban development issues, particularly on the following \nproject-related issues: (i) sustainable urban development and environmental management, (ii) \nintegrated urban transport planning and management, and (iii) heating service reforms.  \n \n15.  Given its decades-long copper mining background, Baiyin is known as one of the major \nindustrial polluters in western PRC. With financing support from the central and provincial \ngovernments, BMG has undertaken many initiatives to address the environmental concerns. \nDetails  of  the  domestically  funded  environmental  improvement  projects  in  Baiyin  are  in \nAppendix  3.  The  ongoing  economic  transformation  has  provided  the  city  with  a  unique \nopportunity to diversify its economy, away from highly polluting industries. It is important that the \neconomic transformation be managed and accomplished in a sustainable and environment- \nfriendly manner, to build a clean and environment-friendly new Baiyin. In this context, BMG has \nundertaken the initiative to conduct a regional environmental impact assessment (REIA) for \nSBIZ covering both the existing BHTIP and the new industrial land to be developed under the \nProject to assess the potential environmental risks and introduce, under an environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), appropriate mitigation measures. One special focus of policy dialogue \nunder the Project is on reviewing the adequacy of the proposed EMP and introducing an \neffective  environmental  management  system  (EMS)  to  ensure  timely  and  effective \nimplementation of the EMP. \n \n16.  The  urban  transport  sector  in  the  PRC  is  generally  constrained  by  a  fragmented \ninstitutional system, under which urban planning, road construction and maintenance, transport \nservice, vehicle emission control, and traffic management are managed by different agencies \nwith limited cooperation and interagency coordination. In some cities, these institutional barriers \nhave  significantly  constrained  the  emergence  of  integrated  urban  planning  and  transport \nmanagement.  BMG  has  made  good  progress  in  resolving  this  problem.  An  interagency \ncommittee for transport and road safety has been established under the leadership of the \nmayor. Policy dialogue on the urban transport issues is focused mainly on improving public \ntransport  service  and  road  safety  as  well  as  further  strengthening  enforcement  of  vehicle \nemission control.     \n \n17.  ADB has been active in promoting heating service reforms in the PRC. Its efforts include \nto (i) promote centralized district heating in cities to improve energy efficiency and reduce air \npollution,  (ii)  introduce  urban  heating  tariff  reforms,  (iii)  encourage  the  private  sector  to \nparticipate in service provision, and (iv) ensure that low-income families have access to the \n ", "5 \nimproved  heating  service.4 Under  the  Project,  63  low-efficiency  and  highly  polluting  small \ncommunity boilers will be replaced by a centralized district heating system with significant \nenergy conservation effect and environmental benefits. The expanded district heating service \nwill be provided by the Minyue District Heating Corporation (MDHC), a state share-controlled \ncompany that won the concession for providing district heating service for west Baiyin district \nthrough open competition in 2005. Unlike the traditional government-run utilities in many other \ncities, which are suffering from obsolete equipment and redundant workers, MDHC is operated \nby a team of professional and skilled laborers at a low cost with very high operational efficiency. \nPolicy dialogue in the heating sector under the Project is focused on ensuring access of low-\nincome families to the improved heating service.  \n \n18.  External  Assistance. The Project will be the first urban development project to be \nfunded  by  a  multilateral  development  bank  in  Gansu  province.  Following  the  smooth \nimplementation of the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Project, the Gansu \nprovincial government (GPG) requested, through the Government, another loan of $150 million \nfrom ADB for strengthening and upgrading the urban transport system in Lanzhou, the capital \ncity of Gansu province. The project preparatory TA and the proposed loan for this second urban \ndevelopment project in Gansu province are programmed for 2007 and 2009, respectively. ADB \nassistance for urban development in the PRC is in Appendix 4.   \n \n19.  Lessons  Learned.  ADB-financed  urban  development  and  urban  environmental \nmanagement projects in the PRC generally perform well. Urban development usually requires \nan integrated and multisector approach. One major lesson learned is the need for integrated \nand strategic urban planning, which is usually in the form of a well-prepared city development \nmaster  plan  to  guide  specific  development  activities.  The  Project  includes  several  sector \ncomponents  (basic  urban  infrastructure,  roads,  and  district  heating).  ADB  has  engaged  in \nextensive policy dialogue with the Government and BMG to confirm that these components are \nconsistent with the Baiyin Urban Development Master Plan (2001\u20132020) and will contribute to \nthe outcome of the Project to facilitate economic transformation and improve the quality of life in \nBaiyin. Lessons identified from ADB\u2019s post-evaluation exercises (e.g., ADB\u2019s Special Evaluation \nStudy on Urban Sector Strategy and Operations)5 highlight the importance of integrating both \nsupply  and  demand  concerns  into  the  project  design.  Other  lessons  include  the  need  to \nencourage  broad  reforms,  to  introduce  appropriate  pricing  policies  and  tariff  setting  and \nadjustment mechanism to ensure cost recovery and counterpart funding for operation and \nmaintenance, to consult the public and involve the community in project design, to educate the \npublic on the need for environmental awareness, and to address the resettlement issue early. \nThese lessons have been considered in policy dialogue with the Government and BMG, and \nincorporated in the design of the proposed Project. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  the  sustainable  and  environment-friendly  urban \ndevelopment of Baiyin. The project impact will be measured by the achievement of sustained \neconomic growth, the employment opportunities created in the SBIZ, the improvement in urban \ntransport  service  and  road  safety,  the  improvement  in  district  heating  services,  and  the \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

The outcome of the \nProject will be the facilitated urban economic transformation and improved quality of life in \nBaiyin.  The  outcome  will  be  measured  by  the  performance  of  the  SBIZ  in  attracting  new \ninvestments, the effectiveness of the newly introduced EMS for the SBIZ, the improved capacity \nin the urban transport system, the increased service coverage by the district heating services for \nurban dwellers including the low-income families, and the performance in demolishing the low-\nefficiency and polluting small community coal-fire heating boilers. \n \nB.  Outputs \n21.  The Project will have five components: (i) Southern Baiyin infrastructure, (ii) Baiyin road \nimprovements, (iii) Pingchuan road improvements, (iv) district heating services, and (v) capacity \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening. The five components are summarized below. \n \n22.  Component 1: Southern Baiyin Infrastructure. Under this component, the Project will \ndevelop 6 km2 of industrial land with basic public infrastructure including about 24.9 km long \nprimary  and  secondary  roads  and  related  water  supply  pipelines,  drainage  pipelines  and \nsewers, heating supply pipelines, optical-fabric cable and electricity distribution lines, lighting, \nand public green areas. \n \n23.  Component 2: Baiyin Road Improvements. Under this component, the Project will (i) \nconstruct nine new roads with a total length of 23.1 km; and (ii) build connected water supply \npipelines, drainage pipelines, sewers, heating supply pipelines, lighting, bus rider/pedestrian \nand bicycle facilities. This component will also (i) build 14 bridges/culverts and (ii) rehabilitate \nand widen three existing roads with a total length of 6.1 km. \n \n24.  Component 3: Pingchuan Road Improvements. Under this component, the Project \nwill construct (i) seven new roads with a total length of 12.6 km; and (ii) the related drainage \npipelines, sewers, and water supply pipelines. This component will also (i) build three bridges \nand (ii) rehabilitate and widen one road 3.5 km long. \n \n25.  Component  4:  District  Heating  Services.  Under  this  component,  the  Project  will \nexpand the heating service area in Baiyin district by 3.2 million square meters (m2) by (i) \nbuilding a new heating source plant with 4x58 megawatts capacity, (ii) laying down 12.6 km of \nheat transmission pipelines, and (iii) installing 29 heat exchange stations for connection with the \ncommunity heat distribution systems. \n \n26.  Component V: Capacity Development and Institutional Strengthening. Under this \ncomponent, the Project will provide consulting services and financial support for BMG to: (i) \ndesign and introduce an EMS for SBIZ, (ii) develop a geographic information system (GIS)-\nbased urban planning and road and bridge management system for integrated urban transport \nplanning and management, (iii) provide consulting services during project implementation, and \n(iv) provide support and training for institutional strengthening of BMG, PMO, and IAs on urban \nplanning and management.   \n \nC.  Special Features \n27.  Environmental Management System. A major challenge is to manage the induced \nenvironmental impact of the intensified industrial activities related to the development of the \nSBIZ. BMG\u2019s initiative to develop a REIA for the SBIZ is commendable. The Project will provide \ncapacity development support to help BMG establish the EMS for the SBIZ. The assistance will \n ", "7 \ninclude (i) designing the detailed institutional structure and operational mechanism for the EMS, \n(ii)  preparing  and  developing  the  environmental  management  regulatory  framework  for  the \nindustrial  zone,  (iii)  designing  and  establishing  a  centralized  environmental  management \ninformation system including the early warning system for emergency response, (iv) providing \nbasic  environmental  monitoring  equipment,  and  (v)  providing  training  for  environmental \nmanagement.  \n \n28.  Integrated  Urban  Transport  Planning  and  Management.  Baiyin  is  at  a  relatively \nadvanced stage in addressing the institutional barriers to integrated urban transport planning \nand management (para. 16). A sophisticated traffic control system has been established by the \ntraffic police. The city has been chosen by the Ministry of Construction as the pilot city in Gansu \nprovince to apply a computer-based urban management system to improve urban planning and \nmanagement.  A  basic  GIS-based  urban  management  system  with  limited  information  has \nalready been developed. Under the Project, assistance will be provided to help BMG upgrade \nthis initial GIS-based urban management system to make it an integrated urban management \ninformation system, which will serve, among others, as a platform to integrate urban planning, \ntransport planning, and asset management. Assistance will also be provided to help establish \nthe link between the traffic control system, public transport operations, and the proposed urban \nmanagement information system. \n \n29.  Access  of  Low-Income  Families  to  District  Heating  Service. Under the planned \neconomy, employers traditionally provided heating service to their employees on a cost-sharing \nbasis, through community heating systems. With expansion of the district heating system, the \nemployers will stop running the small community heating boilers. But this may leave the low-\nincome  families,  particularly  the  unemployed,  vulnerable  and  unprotected.  To  resolve  the \nproblem, BMG has agreed to introduce a special heating assistance program, which will ensure \nprovision of a basic volume of quality heat supply for low-income families as an essential social \nservice. The program will be financed by (i) an appropriate subsidy from BMG, and (ii) the \nsubsidy fund as a portion of the revenue generated by MDHC. Operational details of the \nassistance program are under study. BMG has given its assurance that the assistance program \nfor low-income families will be put in operation before the full operation of the heating system \nconstructed under the Project.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n30.  The total project cost is estimated at $161.53 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties of $4.7 million. The project investment plan is summarized in Table 1.

Financing charges have been computed at the 5-year \nforward London interbank offered rate plus a lending spread of 0.60% and commitment charge of \n0.35%.  On 7 December 2007, the Board of Directors (R 210-07) approved a credit of 0.40% for the \nduration of the loan, to result in a contractual spread of 0.20% and a reduction of commitment charge \nto 0.15%.  The financing charges presented in the table will be recalculated in accordance with the \nnew loan charges and the loan savings will be reallocated during Project implementation.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n31.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $80.0 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15%6 \nper  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \n32.  The ADB loan will finance about 49.5% of the total cost of the Project. Counterpart \nfunding will be provided by BMG, Pingchuan district government (PDG), MDHC, and domestic \ncommercial bank loans. The ADB loan will cover civil works, equipment and supplies, consulting \nservices and training, and financial charges on the loan during construction, while contingencies \nwill be financed by the Government. The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2 \nand details are in Appendix 5.   \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)  80.00    49.5 \nDomestic Bank Loana  12.08      7.5 \nBaiyin Municipal Governmenta  55.48    34.3 \nPingchuan District Governmenta   5.59      3.5 \nMinyue District Heating Corp.a   8.38      5.2 \n  Total       161.53         100.0 \na Commitments for counterpart funding have been provided. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n33.

BMG will relend on the same terms and conditions the relevant amounts of the loan \nproceeds to PDG and MDHC for implementing the Pingchuan road improvements component \nand district heating services component, respectively. BMG, PDG, and MDHC will assume, as \nthe end-borrowers for their relevant portions of the loan proceeds, the foreign exchange and \ninterest variation risks of the ADB loan. The flow of funds and onlending arrangements are \ndescribed in Appendix 6.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n34.  BMG will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A project leading group (PLG) headed \nby the mayor of BMG has been established and will be responsible for directing the project and \nproviding policy guidance during implementation. The PLG will comprise representatives from \nBaiyin  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Baiyin  Finance  Bureau,  Baiyin  Land \nManagement Bureau (BLMB), Baiyin Environmental Protection Bureau, BCCB, Baiyin Foreign \nAffairs  Administrative  Bureau,  Baiyin  Urban  Comprehensive  Development  Bureau,  Baiyin \ndistrict government, and PDG. The PLG will meet at least once a month. A PMO has been set \nup  under  the  PLG.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  operations  and  for \ncoordinating the implementation of project activities on behalf of BMG. The PMO will (i) ensure \nadequate interdepartmental and interagency coordination, (ii) monitor the progress of project \nimplementation,  and  (iii)  coordinate  communication  with  ADB  and  the  other  agencies \nconcerned. The PMO will be headed by a director appointed by BMG. The PMO will comprise of \n10 staff, including at least two engineers/procurement specialists, two financial specialists, two \nsafeguard specialists, and one English translator. Four staff members will be appointed by BMG \nand the rest will be hired on a competitive basis. The PMO will establish a Project-specific \nwebsite containing Project-specific information. \n \n35.  The Project will have four implementing agencies (IAs): (i) the BHTIP Management \nCommission for the Southern Baiyin infrastructure component, (ii) BCCB for the Baiyin road \nimprovements component, (iii) PDG for the Pingchuan road improvements component, and (iv) \nMDHC for the district heating services component. Among the four, BHTIP and BCCB are part \nof BMG. PDG is a local government entity under the jurisdiction of BMG. MDHC is a state \nshare-controlled company. A project implementation unit (PIU) will be established within each IA \nand will report to the respective IA in undertaking detailed implementation activities. Appendix 7 \ngives the details of the overall organization of project implementation at PMO and PIU levels. A \nfinancial management assessment was conducted for each IA. The conclusion is that all the IAs \nhave the capacity for project implementation and sustainable operation, but will need extensive \ntraining due to lack of ADB-related experience. Details of the financial management assessment \nare in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n36.  The Project will be implemented over a 4-year period from 2008 to 2011 (Appendix 8). \nThis  schedule  is  considered  realistic  and  achievable  because  the  project  implementation \nstructure is already in place and preparatory works are under way.  \n \n ", "10 \n3.  Procurement \n37.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated \nto  exceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10.0  million  will  be \nprocured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and for \nworks estimated to cost equal to or less than the above ICB values but more than $100,000 will \nbe procured on the basis of national competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the \nPRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999),  subject  to  clarifications  agreed  upon  with  ADB. \nContracts for goods and works estimated to cost $100,000 or less will be procured using \nshopping procedures. More details are in Appendix 9. \n \n4.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n38.  To expedite project implementation, ADB has approved the Government\u2019s request for \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing to cover recruitment of consulting services and \nprocurement of goods and civil works. The issuance of invitations to bid or to pre-qualify under \nadvance contracting will be subject to ADB approval. All advance contracting will be undertaken \nin conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines or Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The amount to be retroactively financed will not exceed \n20% of the loan amount. The expenditures must have been incurred before loan effectiveness \nbut not earlier than 12 months before the loan agreement is signed. The Government and BMG \nhave been advised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to finance the ensuing Project. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n39.  The  Project  will  fund  18  person-months  of  international  and  116  person-months  of \nnational  consulting  services  to  support  capacity  development  for  BMG  in  the  areas  of \nenvironmental  management,  integrated  urban  planning  and  management,  and  institutional \nstrengthening for project implementation and management. The consulting services will be \nrecruited through a consulting firm selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm will be selected in \naccordance with the quality- and-cost-based selection method at the quality-to-cost ratio of \n80:20 using full technical proposal procedures. Consulting services are required for (i) designing \nand introducing a well functioning EMS for the SBIZ, (ii) developing the GIS-based urban \nplanning and road and bridge management system, and (iii) providing project implementation \nmanagement  support  for  the  PMO  and  IAs.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting \nservices is in Appendix 10. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n40.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  GPG,  BMG  and  the  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy has been included in \nthe loan covenants and will be included in the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, \nall contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of GPG, BMG, IAs, and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. For \n ", "11 \nthe Project, GPG and BMG will undertake the following anticorruption actions: (i) involve full \ntime officials from the discipline and Inspection bureau in monitoring bidding and construction \nand operations of Project operations; (ii) introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works \ncontract winner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iii) periodically \ninspect the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n41.  The ADB loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures set out in \nADB\u2019s Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite \nproject implementation through timely release of loan proceeds, GPG will establish an imprest \naccount, promptly after loan effectiveness, at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The initial \namount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed the estimated expenditures for \nthe next 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. To expedite funds flow and \nsimplify documentation process, the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used for \nliquidating  and  replenishing  the  imprest  account  and  reimbursing  eligible  expenses  not \nexceeding $100,000 per individual payment. The payments in excess of the SOE ceiling will be \nreimbursed, liquidated, or replenished based on a full supporting documentation process. Such \ndocumentation will demonstrate, among other things, that goods and/or services were produced \nin and procured from ADB members, and are eligible for ADB financing. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n42.  The PMO will prepare regular semiannual progress reports indicating progress made, \nproblems encountered during the period under review, steps taken or proposed to remedy the \nproblems, the proposed program of activities, and progress expected in the next half year. The \nIAs will keep records to allow the identification of goods and services financed out of the loan \nproceeds, following accounting principles and practices prescribed by the Accounting Law of the \nPRC.  The  law  requires  enterprises  to  prepare  financial  statements  and  generally  follow \ninternationally accepted accounting standards. The IAs will maintain separate project accounts \nand records. The financial statements of the project accounts and the annual corporate financial \nstatements for IAs will be subject to external audit by the BMG Audit Bureau, the Gansu \nProvincial Audit Bureau, and the State Audit Administration. The audits will be carried out in \naccordance with regulations for auditing approved by the State Council and will meet ADB \nrequirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of \nexpenditure will be part of the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual audited financial statements and \naudited project accounts will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the \nfiscal year for the entire implementation period. The Government, GPG, and BMG were advised \nof  ADB\u2019s  requirement  of  timely  submission  of  audited  projects  accounts  and  financial \nstatements, and the suspension of disbursements of the proposed ADB loan in case of non-\ncompliance with the requirement. BMG and the IAs will submit reports and information to ADB \nconcerning the use of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and IA performance. These \nreports  will  include  (i)  semiannual  progress  reports  on  project  implementation;  (ii)  annual \nreports; and (iii) a project completion report, not later than 3 months after the completion of the \nproject. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n43.  The project performance monitoring system (PPMS) indicators will include (i) occupation \nrate of the SBIZ, (ii) additional employment opportunities created by the SBIZ, (iii) adequacy \nlevel of the EMS for the SBIZ, (iv) service level of the improved road systems in Baiyin and \n ", "12 \nPingchuan districts, (v) enforcement of vehicle emission control, (vi) reduction in fatalities from \nroad accidents, (vii) service level of district heating service, and (viii) improvement in air quality. \n \n44.  No later than 6 months after project inception, the PMO and the IAs, with assistance \nfrom  the  consultants,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  generate  data \nsystematically on the inputs and outputs of each component, as well as the agreed-upon socio-\neconomic, environmental, and health indicators to be used to measure project impacts. The \nPMO will (i) refine the PPMS framework, (ii) confirm achievable targets, (iii) finalize monitoring \nand recording arrangements, and (iv) establish systems and procedures. Under the PPMS \nframework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite time intervals by the IAs, \nincluding semiannual reporting of the EMP. The PMO will be responsible for analyzing and \nconsolidating the data. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt \nremedial action regarding project design, schedule, activities, and development impacts. The \nPMO, with the assistance of the consultants, will monitor and assess activities, and submit \nannual reports to ADB on the physical implementation and financial aspects to ensure that the \nproject impact is monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n10.  Project Review \n45.  ADB and the Government will review project implementation jointly at least once a year. \nIn addition, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years \nafter the start of project implementation. This midterm review will include a detailed evaluation of \nthe scope, implementation arrangements, and achievement of scheduled targets; progress on \nthe  agenda  for  policy  reform;  capacity  development  measures;  financial,  institutional, \nresettlement, social, environmental aspects; and all other aspects that may have an impact on \nproject implementation progress and sustainability. From the findings of the midterm review, a \nknowledge product on economic transformation would be developed for dissemination. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n46.  The Project will directly benefit more than 475,000 urban residents in the project areas \nthrough construction of urban infrastructure for economic transformation, improved urban roads, \nand expanded and enhanced district heating supply. With support from the Project, despite the \ndeclining share of mining-related production, Baiyin is envisaged to maintain its GDP growth at \na double-digit annual rate from 2005 to 2015. When completed, the SBIZ is expected to provide \nmore than 5,000 permanent jobs for the skilled workers whose jobs are affected by the decline \nin  the  mining  resources.  With  support  from  the  Project,  development  of  the  SBIZ  will  be \nmanaged  and  accomplished  by  an  effective  EMS  designed  in  accordance  with  the \ninternationally  accepted  environmental  management  standards  issued  by  the  International \nStandards Organization (ISO 14000 standards).  \n \n47.  The  road  improvements  component  will  improve  significantly  the  urban  transport \nsituation in both Baiyin and Pingchuan districts and provide the two urban centers of Baiyin with \nthe basic road framework with the capacity to meet their long-term development needs up to \n2030. The road improvements component will expand the public transport service coverage \nthrough increased bus lines, divert downtown traffic to the outer ring road, and reduce road \naccident fatalities from the 2005 baseline by about 10% by 2011. Through the district heating \nservices component, the Project will replace 63 inefficient and highly polluting small community \nheating boilers with an efficient and environment-friendly centralized district heating system. By \n ", "13 \nthe year 2015, the heating service area will expand by 2.6 million m2 and benefit about 20,000 \nhouseholds,  about  10%  of  whom  are  low-income  families.  The  district  heating  services \ncomponent  will  also  help  reduce  emission  of sulfur  dioxide  by  185  tons  per  year,  reduce \nconsumption of coal by 5,700 tons per year, and improve public health and indoor air quality by \neliminating numerous indoor coal-burning stoves and facilitating the switch to district heating.   \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n \n48.  Overall, the land acquisition and resettlement impacts of the Project will be significant. In \ntotal, about 730.4 hectares (ha) of land will be permanently acquired by the Project, of which \n153.6  ha  or  21%  is  classified  as  farmland.  Permanent  land  acquisition  will  affect  1,619 \nhouseholds or 6,272 people. The Project will also require the temporary acquisition of 13.5 ha of \nland, all of which is unoccupied state-owned land along roads to be improved. A total of 328 \nhouseholds or 1,450 people will be relocated, about 61,012 m2 of residential houses will be \ndemolished, 42 enterprises with a total of 1,378 employees will be affected, and 28,814 m2 of \nnonresidential  structures  will  be  dismantled.  In  addition,  some  productive  assets,  ground \nattachments,  and  public  infrastructure  facilities  will  also  be  affected.  No  ethnic  minority \nhousehold will suffer any land acquisition or resettlement impacts.  \n \n49.  For  permanent  land  acquisition,  compensation  will  be  paid  in  cash  to  the  village \ncollective and the affected persons (APs). The resettlement subsidy, and compensation for \nstanding crops, trees, ground attachments, and income losses suffered by enterprises will be \npaid directly to the APs. For residential houses and nonresidential houses to be demolished, \ncompensation at replacement value will be paid to owners. Households who need to relocate \nwill  also  receive  a  relocation  allowance.  The  measures  for  economic  rehabilitation  include \nproviding jobs during the project construction and operational phases; redistributing farmland \namong affected groups wherever possible; upgrading  existing low-yield farmland to intensify \nagricultural production; developing off-farm opportunities; and providing technical training to the \nAPs to increase their skills. For the vulnerable people, the respective IAs will pay an additional \none-time grant to improve their living standards. The PMO and IA will supervise implementation \nto  ensure  the  vulnerable  persons  receive  adequate  compensation,  are  helped  in  making \nhousing arrangement; and are assisted to restore their living conditions and incomes. Individual \nresettlement plans (RPs) have been prepared for each investment component under the Project \nin accordance with PRC Land Administration Law (1998), State Council Decision on Deepen \nReform and Strictly Enforce Land Administration (2004) and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) and associated operational procedures. RPs have been distributed to the affected \ndistricts, counties, villages, and APs. The resettlement information booklets were disseminated \nto the APs on 20 June 2007. The estimated cost of land acquisition and resettlement is $15 \nmillion, equivalent to CNY116.99 million in 2007 prices, including contingencies. The summary \nRP is in Appendix 11. \n \n2.  Poverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n \n50.  The  Project  supports  the  achievement  of  the  NSDW  for  promoting  economic \ndevelopment in western PRC. Of the total 475,000 direct beneficiary population, 45,126 persons \nor 15.35% of the total urban population live under the Minimum Living Guarantee (MLG)7 in the \nproject  areas  (33,096  persons  in  Baiyin  district  and  12,030  in  Pingchuan).  Improved  road \n                                                 \n7  The municipal poverty line is CNY156 per capita per month. \n ", "14 \nnetworks will increase mobility, reduce traffic congestion, reduce road accidents, and enhance \nroad  safety.  The  beneficiary  population,  especially  the  poor,  will  benefit  from  improved \ntransportation facilities and increased access to employment, schools, as well as other social \nservices.  The  development  of  the  SBIZ  will  also  attract  increased  foreign  and  domestic \ninvestments and lead to increased employment opportunities. The poor will also benefit from \ntemporary jobs during the construction phase as well as permanent jobs during the operational \nphase. Improvement of the central heating supply will reduce the incidence of environmental \nhealth impacts, especially for poor households as they will be able to access the heating \nfacilities through the BMG assistance program.   \n \n51.  The Project will create 3,640 person-years of direct and indirect short-term employment \nopportunities, with earnings totaling CNY49.09 million during the construction phase. The poor, \nwomen, and ethnic minorities will be given priority in the short-term employment opportunities. \nThose temporarily employed in construction will benefit from the training and experience gained \nunder the Project, which is expected to enhance their opportunities for employment in other \ninfrastructure projects. Another 1,350 person-years of long-term employment opportunities will \nbe  created,  with  wages  totaling  CNY18.14  million  per  annum  during  the  operation  phase. \nPriority in these mid- to long-term employment opportunities will also be given to the poor, \nwomen,  ethnic  minorities,  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  To  maximize  the  project  benefits, \nwomen will be given priority in employment and training during the construction and operation \nphases. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12.  \n  \nC.  Financial Analysis, Sustainability, and Affordability Aspects \n \n52.  The Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. A financial impact analysis \nwas  undertaken  for  the  two  revenue-generating  components  (district  heating  services  and \nSouthern Baiyin infrastructure). These are further discussed in Appendix 13.  The detailed \nfinancial impact analysis is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n53.  MDHC is a new company that obtained from BMG a concession contract to provide \ndistrict heating service for west Baiyin through open competition in August 2005. With initial the \ninvestment, MDHC has already built a heat source plant and associated transmission lines, and \nstarted providing heating service at an expansion rate of 200,000 m2 per year in accordance \nwith its heating service expansion program. Over the 2 years of operation since November \n2005, MDHC has generated a net income of CNY4.26 million. With support from the Project, \nMDHC  will  be  able  to  accelerate  the  service  expansion  to  achieve  full  coverage  of  the \nconcession area. Detailed financial analysis and assessment reveal that MDHC has sufficient \nequity fund to maintain the debt-to-equity ratio at a level not higher than 70:30 throughout the \noperation period of the Project. At the current tariff level (constant price), MDHC can maintain its \nfinancial  sustainability.  Investment  for  service  expansion,  heating  operation  and  system \nmaintenance, and debt service can be financed by the increased revenue generated from the \nexpansion of the customer base. Over the project period of 25 years, MDHC will generate a \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 6.4%, compared with the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC) at 3.02%.  \n \n54.  The  current  tariff  for  residential  consumers  in  Baiyin  is  CNY13  per  m2,  which  is \nconsidered  adequate.  It  reflects  the  local  costs  of  heating  service  and  is  generally  found \naffordable to the residents. A social survey reveals that 39% of the surveyed households would \naccept a minor increase in heating tariff for improved heating service, and 61% would not \naccept an abrupt tariff increase due to their limited resources. Of the 61%, 47.5% indicated their \nwillingness to accept a gradual tariff increase if it is introduced over a 5-year period. The survey \n ", "15 \nresults have been discussed with BMG and MDHC. MDHC is comfortable with the current tariff \nand does not have any plan to request an increase. In the case of significant increase in the \ncosts of MDHC operation inputs which may affect its financial sustainability, MDHC may request \nBMG for a tariff review. BMG will, if the request is considered reasonable, use its best efforts to \nprovide support to MDHC to maintain its financial sustainability. In case tariff adjustment is \nconsidered  the  best  option,  BMG  will  organize  public  consultation  with  key  stakeholders \nincluding the representative of the low income families or other mechanisms as provided for in \nthe laws and regulations on utility tariff setting before adjusting tariff. The affordability concern is \ncurrently concentrated on the low-income families below the MLG. Results of social survey \nindicate that heating expenditures at the current tariff level will account for about 15% of their \nincome. To ensure that low-income families have access to the improved heating service, BMG \nhas agreed to introduce a special heating assistance program for them. The program will \nprovide a basic volume of quality heating supply for the low-income families as an essential \nsocial service, which will be financed by (i) an appropriate subsidy from BMG, and (ii) the \nsubsidy fund as a portion of the revenue generated by MDHC (para. 29). \n \n55.  Although the BHTIP is not a self-financing entity, financial analysis has been undertaken \nfor  the  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure  component  because  this  component  will  generate \nrevenues from the lease of developed industrial land. BMG will decide on a lot price at different \nlevels, ranging from the minimum price for industrial land set by the Government to a level that \nachieves full cost recovery. Using the current promotion price, the financial analysis concludes \nthat the Southern Baiyin infrastructure component will have an FIRR of 8.7%, compared with a \nWACC of 3.13%. \n \n56.  Results of the assessment of financial management indicate that the Project will not \naffect the financial sustainability of BMG and the IAs. BHTIP, BCCB, and MDHC have an \nadequate  internal  financial  management  system  and  enough  financial  management \nprofessionals to manage the Project. The PIU at PDG is relatively weak. None of the IAs has \nexperience in working with international financial institutions. Special training programs have \nbeen arranged for the IAs with support from the project preparatory TA to help them understand \nADB policy and project management requirements. Further training is included in the capacity \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening component of the Project.  \n \nD.  Economic Aspects \n \n57.  Economic  analysis  provides  the  rationale  and  justification  for  the  Project  based  on \npolicy, sector, and in-depth analysis of BMG\u2019s strategy for economic transformation. It considers \nthe Project, not as a stand-alone investment, but as an integral part of the strategy to transform \nBaiyin from a traditional mining city to a sustainable and environment-friendly urban center. A \nleast-cost analysis was conducted for each of the four investment components, followed by an \neconomic evaluation of each component and of the Project as a whole. For the Southern Baiyin \ninfrastructure component, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated based on \nthe quantification of the incremental land value and incremental labor income. The EIRR is \n12.98%,  which  is  higher  than  the  economic  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  For  the  two  road \nimprovement  components,  the  EIRR  is  14.23%  based  on  the  quantification  of  savings  on \nvehicle operation cost, savings in travel time, and reduction of road accidents. The EIRR for the \ndistrict heating services component was calculated based on both energy efficiency benefits \nand environmental benefits under two scenarios: taking into account or not taking into account \nthe reduction in environmental costs. The economic evaluation concludes that the EIRR for this \ncomponent will be 19.70% without taking into account the reduction in environmental costs, and \n23.78%  after  taking  into  account  the  reduction  in  environmental  costs.  All  the  investment \n ", "16 \ncomponents have an EIRR higher than 12%, the economic opportunity cost of capital. The \nProject\u2019s overall EIRR is 14.26% shows that the Project is economically viable. The summary \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 14. Detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix \nC. \n \nE.  Environmental Aspects \n \n58.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was  prepared  for  the  Southern  Baiyin \ninfrastructure and the district heating services components, respectively. A combined EIA was \nprepared  for  the  two  urban  road  improvements  components.  All  EIAs  were  prepared  in \naccordance with relevant laws and regulations of the PRC. All the investment components were \nexamined  against  the  procedures  and  criteria  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy, \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  and  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected \nInfrastructure Projects. In addition, a REIA was prepared for the SBIZ covering both the BHTIP \nand the 6 km2 industrial land to be developed under the Project. The REIA was prepared to \nassess and manage the induced environmental impacts that may arise from the intensified \nindustrial activities as a result of the economic transformation. Extensive public consultations \ninvolving a survey, meetings with stakeholders, and focus group discussions were undertaken \ntwice during the preparation of the EIAs and the REIA.  The EIAs and the REIA were endorsed \nby the Baiyin Environmental Protection Bureau (BEPB) and approved by the Gansu Provincial \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau. A copy of the REIA is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n59.  A summary EIA (SEIA) was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and posted on the \nADB website on 29 June 2007. The SEIA confirms that all the investment components will have \npositive environmental impacts and will contribute to the strengthening of the project impact for \na  sustainable  and  environment-friendly  urban  development  in  Baiyin.  The  district  heating \nservices component will significantly improve air quality and energy efficiency in Baiyin by \nexpanding the service coverage of centralized district heating to replace the inefficient and \nhighly polluting small community heating boilers. Coal burned for heating will be reduced by \n5,700 tons each year, thus reducing significantly the emission of coal-based pollutants, the \noccurrence of respiratory disease during winter, and the traffic hazards caused by the transport \nof coal in urban areas. \n \n60.  The two road improvement components will provide an efficient and safe urban transport \nframework for each of the two urban centers of the city to meet their long-term development \nneeds.  These  components  will  bring  environmental  benefits  by  improving  motor  vehicle \noperating efficiency, rationalizing the traffic flow passing through the city for better interaction \nbetween the urban transport system and the surrounding national and provincial road networks, \nreducing motor vehicle emissions, and reducing the number of road accident fatalities. The \nSouthern  Baiyin  infrastructure  component  will  provide  a  platform  for  Baiyin  to  accelerate \neconomic diversification and transformation to achieve the goal to build a sustainable and \nenvironment-friendly new Baiyin. The SEIA confirms that sufficient and appropriate mitigation \nmeasures to manage and alleviate the adverse environmental impacts have been introduced \nthrough the preparation of the REIA and EIAs. The mitigation measures are summarized in the \nEMP attached to the SEIA. The SEIA and the EMP are in Supplementary Appendix E and F, \nrespectively. \n \nF.  Project Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n61.  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Conventional  engineering \ndesigns and technology with proven records of reliable performance are adopted for all the four \n ", "17 \ninvestment components. Consulting services will be provided to support the PMO and IAs to \nensure timely implementation of the Project in accordance with the design requirements and \nquality  standards.  The  SEIA  has  concluded  that  the  Project  has  met  the  environmental \nsafeguard requirements of ADB and the Government of the PRC. \n \n62.  The Project will not be a success if the SBIZ, after land development, fails to attract \ninvestors to support the economic diversification and transformation because of a mismatch \nbetween the transformation strategy and Baiyin\u2019s competitive advantages. Under the project \npreparatory TA, a strategic review was undertaken together with economic analysis to assess \nBMG\u2019s strategy for urban economic transformation. The review confirmed the SBIZ\u2019s advantage \nand potential to develop extended production chains for chemical research and production, and \nnonferrous processing. The involvement of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in developing and \noperating  the  BHTIP  has  also  provided  the  SBIZ  with  advanced  knowledge  inputs  and \ntechnology  advantages  to  attract  high  quality  investors  for  technology  upgrading.  These \nadvantages have also been confirmed by the success of the BHTIP and the pipeline of new \ninvestors waiting for industrial land (para. 10). \n \n63.  The project risk may arise from the induced environmental impact due to the intensified \nindustrial  activities  in  the  SBIZ.  To  mitigate  this  risk  in  a  systematic  manner,  BMG  has \nundertaken a REIA to assess the environmental impact from the industrial activities in both the \nexisting BHTIP and the SBIZ to be developed under the Project. An EMP has been developed \nunder the REIA and EIAs to mitigate the identified environmental risks. In addition to the EMP, \nBMG has decided to establish an environmental management committee (EMC) for the SBIZ to \nbe chaired by the Chairman of the Economic and Finance Committee of the Baiyin People\u2019s \nCongress. The EMC will comprise deputies of the Baiyin People\u2019s Congress, independent \nscholars  and  environmental  specialists,  representatives  of  tenant  enterprises,  the  head  of \nBEPB, and head of Baiyin Quality Control and Production Safety Office. The EMC will provide \npolicy guidance on environmental management for economic transformation at the SBIZ. Under \nthe supervision of the EMC, BEPB will set a satellite office at the BHTIP to take care of day-to-\nday environmental monitoring and enforcement. At the same time, each tenant enterprise at the \nSBIZ  will  be  requested  to  set  up  an  internal  environmental  management  office  or  unit \nresponsible  for  the  enterprise\u2019s  compliance  with  all  the  environmental  management \nrequirements. Furthermore, consulting services will be provided under the Project to help BMG \ndesign the regulatory framework (including entrance criteria, detailed operational mechanism of \nthe  proposed  three-tier  EMS),  and  provide  related  training  to  ensure  that  the  economic \ntransformation  is  conducted  and  accomplished  in  a  sustainable  and  environment-friendly \nmanner. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES8 AND CONDITION \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n64.

GPG through BMG will ensure that all land and rights-\nof-way needed under the Project are made available in a timely manner prior to \ncommencement of civil works and in accordance with the RPs.  \n \n(iii)  Closure of small coal-fire heating boilers. GPG through BMG will ensure that \nall the 63 small community coal-fire heating boilers identified for demolition under \nthe  Project  are  closed  in  accordance  with  the  boiler  demolition  plan  to  be \nprepared in consultation with ADB when the engineering design for the District \nHeating Services component becomes available. \n \n(iv)  Heating assistance to the poor. GPG through BMG will ensure that a special \nheating assistance program for the low-income families is developed in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB for implementation before the full operation of the \nheating system constructed under the Project. The program will ensure provision \nof a basic volume of quality heating supply for the low-income families as an \nessential social service, which is to be jointly financed by (a) appropriate subsidy \nfrom BMG, and (b) subsidy fund as a portion of the cash revenue generated by \nthe MDHC. \n \n(v)  Anticorruption. GPG and BMG will ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Projects include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of BMG and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other services providers as they relate to the Project. During the \nProject implementation, GPG and BMG will, and will cause each PIA to ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date).  GPG \nand  BMG  will,  and  will  cause  each  PIA  to  ensure  that  (i)  officials  from  the \nDiscipline and Inspection Bureau of GPG and BMG monitor bidding of contracts \nand construction and operations of Project facilities; (ii) an internal audit unit is \nestablished in BMG; (iii) a dual-signing system is adopted where the winner of \nthe civil works contract also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer; \n(iv) periodic inspections on the contractors\u2019 activities are undertaken to ensure \nthat fund withdrawals and settlements procedures are followed; and (v) the status \nof  procurement  and  awards  of  contracts  is  published  on  BMG\u2019s  website,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \nB.  Condition for Disbursement \n \n65.  Disbursement of the loan proceeds for each component of the Project will be conditional \non the Government\u2019s certification, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, that BMG and the \nconcerned IAs have executed and delivered the relevant onlending agreements, and which \nhave become fully effective and binding upon the parties thereto in accordance with their terms. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "19 \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n66.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$80,000,000 to

Baiyin Strategy for Sustainable Development through Economic Transformation \n1.  Baiyin used to be the major nonferrous metal base in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), especially for copper mining. In 1984 and 1988, as two of the major copper mines \nbecame exhausted and closed, the copper mine supply has dropped to 15% of the smelting and \nprocessing capacity. Mining of the associated mineral resources, such as lead and zinc, is also \non a declining trend. Baiyin Nonferrous Metal Corporation (BNMC), which employs about half of \nthe entire work force in Baiyin City, is in serious financial condition with over CNY4.7 billion \ncumulative deficits. Seven of its associated companies have filed for bankruptcy. As for the \nentire city, the total industrial assets are estimated at about CNY24.0 billion, whereas the total \ndebt is at about CNY19.6 billion. The city has been identified as one of the 18 most resource-\nexhausted cities in the PRC, and is facing serious challenges to maintain sustainable economic \ndevelopment for the region. \n \n2.  Facing the challenges, the Baiyin Municipal Government (BMG) has been exploring the \nstrategy of maintaining a sustainable economic development through economic transformation \nand diversification. Considering the special condition of rich industrial resources in Baiyin, the \nBMG has developed the strategy of economic transformation with the emphasis on industrial \ndevelopment. BMG has identified four leading industries (nonferrous metal, power, chemical \nindustry, and coal mining) and eight supporting industries (nonferrous metal materials, fine \nchemical  industry,  mining  material  recycling,  new  energy  materials,  machinery  and \nmanufacturing,  nonmetal  material,  agricultural  product  processing,  and  tourism)  as  the \ndirections of continuous economic growth. Details of the four leading industries are summarized \nbelow. \n \n(i)  Nonferrous  metal  industry.  Upgrade  and  improve  the  equipment  and \ntechnology of the traditional nonferrous metal productions, develop new alloy and \nfunctional materials. \n \n(ii)  Power industry. Develop hydropower, coal-based fusel power, as well as wind \npower in the region so as to develop the Baiyin area as one of the energy bases \nin the Northwest Region.    \n \n(iii)  Coal mine industry. Improve the existing coal mine industry with better mining \nstrategy  to  protect  the  mining  resource  and  improve  the  mining  efficiency.  \nDevelop and promote the utilization of coalbed methane (CBM) and coalmine \nmethane (CMM).   \n \n(iv)  Chemical  industry.  Based  on  the  TDI  (toluene  diisovyanateI),  extend  the \nproduction chains to form production of MDI (diphenylmethane diisocyanate), \nPVC (polyvinyl chloride), chlor-alkali complexes, etc..   \n \n3.  The plan for developing the eight supporting industries includes the following. \n \n(i)  Nonferrous metals and rare earth. Extend the production chains of the existing \nnonferrous metal including copper, aluminum, lead, as well as rare earth group to \ndevelop new nonferrous metal and rare earth products. \n \n ", "    Appendix 2       25     \n(ii)  Mine resource reuse. Explore the existing mine resources to be fully utilized, \npromote technology improvement and equipment upgrade, and develop CBM \nand CMM. \n \n(iii)  Fine chemical industry. Develop fine chemical production clusters based on the \nexisting TDI production. \n \n(iv)  Energy and new energy materials. Further develop hydropower, fusel power \nand wind power to form an energy base in the Northwest. Develop lithium based \nbattery production. \n \n(v)  Agricultural product processing. Develop agricultural product productions in \nfood, vegetable and fruit, and special local products. \n \n(vi)  Nonmetal materials. Based on nonmetal mining materials, such as limestone to \ndevelop nonmetal materials. \n \n(vii)  Machinery  and  manufacturing.  Introduce  machinery  and  manufacturing \nproductions to Baiyin area. \n \n(viii)  Yellow River tourism. Promote tourism along Yellow River and develop tour \nroutes based on Yellow River cultural heritages.         \n \nB.  Effort and Achievements in Economic Transformation \n4.  Since 2002, BMG has started implementing the economic transformation strategy in the \narea. As part of the effort to improve the investment environment and attract more outside \ninvestments,  BMG  has  developed  three  economic  development  zones:  Baiyin  High-tech \nIndustrial Park (BHTIP), West Baiyin Economic Development Area, and Pingchuan Economic \nDevelopment Area. Since the implementation of the economic transformation strategy, the \neconomy of Baiyin City has grown steadily at a double-digit rate. \n \n1.  Baiyin High-tech Industrial Park (BHTIP) \n5.  The BHTIP is located in the south of Baiyin district. The total approved industrial park \narea is about 8.05 square kilometers (km2). The development of the area has been staged in \ntwo phases. Phase 1 has been completed, and phase 2 is currently under construction. Since \nthe completion of phase 1, the BHTIP was developed as the site of plants for fine chemical \nindustry, new materials, and pharmaceuticals, and has become the new home of about 43 new \ninvestments,  including  nonferrous  metal  material,  new  battery  material,  chemical  and  fine \nchemical industry, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment. The total investment for the new \nproduction and industries is about CNY3.4 billion, and total production is about CNY300 million. \nNew jobs number 1,850. With the proposed Project, the BHTIP will be expanded and merged \ninto the Southern Baiyin industrial zone (SBIZ) that has an approved land area of 14.05 km2. It \nis anticipated that when  the entire SBIZ is completed, the total annual production value will be \nabout CNY4.0 billion and the estimated tax revenue for the city will be CNY600 million. \n \n2.  West Baiyin Economic Development Area \n6.  The West Baiyin Economy Development Area is located in the west of Baiyin district with \na total area of about 20 km2. All major infrastructure construction has been completed since \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nimplementation began in 2002. Currently there are about 70 new enterprises with a total of \nCNY5.2 billion in investments in the area. In the past 5 years, the total production value has \nreached about CNY9 billion, and the tax revenue for the city has totaled about CNY400 million. \nSome roads under the proposed Baiyin road improvements component are located in the area \nand will add new infrastructure that will facilitate economic development. \n \n3.  Pingchuan Economic Development Area \n7.  The Pingchuan Economic Development Area is located in the west of Pingchuan district. \nIt has been designated as the new industrial area for construction materials, agricultural product \nprocessing,  and  coal-chemical  production.  The  total  investment  was  CNY410  million  and \nconstruction started in 1998. Currently there are about 22 large enterprises and 120 small \nbusinesses employing about 19,000 people. The estimated tax revenue is about CNY30 million. \nSome roads under the Pingchuan road improvements component are located in the area. They \nwill add new infrastructure and provide support for the city\u2019s economic transformation. \n \nC.  Resource and Challenges in Economic Transformation \n8.  BMG has made significant progress in the economic transformation in the last 5 years. \nHowever, more efforts and investments will be required for sustainable economic development \nin the region. As an old industrial city, Baiyin has its own special resources that will be fully \nutilized in the economic transformation. These resources include the following:  \n \n(i)  Industrial resources. Baiyin used to be the national industrial base for mining, \nwith  numerous  mining  and  processing  facilities.  Even  though  some  of  the \nequipment and technologies are out-of-date, the infrastructure and facilities could \nbe modified and renovated for new productions. \n \n(ii)  Land, power, and water resources. Baiyin is rich in land and power supply. It \nalso  has  adequate  water  resources.  All  these  are  essential  for  industrial \nproduction and new economic development. \n \n(iii)  Skilled labor and human resources. Baiyin has a large pool of skilled labor and \nengineering  and  technical  personnel.  The  city  is  also  the  home  of  several \neducational and research institutes. BMG has initiated training programs that will \nteach the labor force new skills and technologies so that they can find positions \nin new productions and industries. \n \n(iv)  Location  and  transportation.  Baiyin  is  located  about  70  kilometers  (km) \nnortheast of Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu province, and is one national \nchemical production center. The two cities are connected by several national and \nprovincial highways, and share one airport. An effective transportation system is \nfundamental condition in reaching out for economic development.  \n \n(v)  Agricultural resource. Baiyin has abundant land resources and is suitable for \ndryland farming and horticulture. In addition to conventional farm production, new \ntechnologies and a diversified agroprocessing business are being developed and \nintroduced in line with the ongoing economic transformation. \n \n(vi)  Government policy support. The central Government has classified Baiyin as \none of the 18 most resource-exhausted cities. The city also benefits from the \n ", "    Appendix 2       27     \nnational policy of developing the vast northwest area. The favorable policies will \nhelp the city\u2019s plan of economic transformation. \n               \n9.  BMG  has  made  achievements  in  the  last  5  years,  but  the  city  is  facing  serious \nchallenges to continue its economic transformation and to maintain its economic development. \nThere are four challenges. \n \n1.  Exhausting Mining Resources Hindering Sustained Economic Growth \n \n10.  Many state-owned large enterprises in mining and traditional industries are deep in debt. \nBNMC, for example, had CNY4.7 billion in debt in 2005 and the liability-to-asset ratio reached \n160%. Most equipment and technologies are out-of-date, have low efficiency, use much energy, \nand  cause  heavy  pollution.  The  unemployment  rate  has  remained  high  for  years.  Many \ncompanies also carry heavy burdens for pensions, social welfare, unemployment benefits, etc. \nThe city has made efforts to reorganize the companies of the traditional industries, develop new \nmining-related  productions,  and  shut  down  factories  that  are  no  longer  sustainable.  New \nstrategy and policies will be developed to promote the market-oriented new production and the \ndevelopment  of  private-owned  enterprises  for  the  traditional  industries.  The  reform  and \nrevitalization of these traditional industries are keys to a successful economic transformation. \n \n2.  Lack of New Technologies and New Investments \n \n11.  Historically, like many \u201ccompany towns\u201d developed under the planned economy, Baiyin \ndepended heavily on mining and mining-related production. The local economy is isolated and \nself-independent  with  little  connection  to  the  outside  economy.  Along  with  economic \ntransformation,  the  city\u2019s  economy  had  to  adapt  itself  from  an  enclosed  production  to  a \ncompetitive open market. Economic survival will have to rely on improved productivity through \nadopting new technologies that have high efficiency and low energy consumption, and cause \nless environmental pollution to produce more competitive and marketable products.  Technology \nupgrading requires tremendous investment. New investments are also needed to develop new \nindustries and economic sectors such as agriculture and agroprocessing, tourism, finance, and \ngeneral services. \n \n3.  Environmental Pollution \n \n12.  Having been a mining city for more than five decades, Baiyin suffers from environmental \npollution due to industrial emissions. In winter, smoke from heating stoves and small boilers \ncontributes significantly to air pollution. In addition to the measures and actions undertaken to \ncontrol and reduce industrial emissions (see Appendix 3), expanding the coverage of the district \nheating services is one effective means to reduce air pollution while strengthening the city\u2019s \ncapacity to provide improved heating service for its residents.  \n \n4.  Low Living Standards \n \n13.  Compared with living standards in the other more developed cities in the PRC, those in \nBaiyin  are  relatively  low.  Living  standards  can  be  measured  by  household  incomes  and \nexpenses; type of housing; access to roads, utilities and other infrastructure; education; medical \ncare condition; cultural life; prices of foods and other goods, etc. To improve the investment \nenvironment, Baiyin needs to improve living standards by adding new urban infrastructure \nincluding roads and public facilities, increasing district heating coverage, improving schools and \nthe medical care system, enriching the cultural life, etc. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n \nD.  Proposed Project in Promoting Sustainable Urban Development \n14.  The  proposed  Project  includes  four  investment  components:  (i)  Southern  Baiyin \ninfrastructure, (ii) Baiyin road improvements, (iii) Pingchuan road improvements, and (iv) district \nheating services. \n \n15.   The  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure  component  will  develop  an  additional  6  km2  of \nindustrial land south of Baiyin, to be equipped with roads; facilities for storm water, sewer, \npower, and heating; and communication facilities for new production and investments. The \nproposed  area  is  adjacent  to  the  BHTIP,  and  is  planned  in  accordance  with  the  city\u2019s \ndevelopment master plan. The component will provide additional sites for new production and \nindustries to support the economic transformation of the city. \n \n16.  The Baiyin and Pingchuan road improvement components will construct new roads and \nimprove existing roads in the urban areas in both districts. Some new roads are in the West \nBaiyin Economic Development Area and the Pingchuan Economic Development Area, which \nwere developed a few years ago as part of the city\u2019s economic transformation plan. The roads in \nthe economic development areas will provide additional infrastructure to satisfy the need of the \nnew plants and investments. The roads in the urban areas will improve traffic conditions and \naccess for businesses and residents, improve overall urban living conditions, and promote more \nbusiness development on the roadsides.  \n \n17.  The district heating service component will increase the coverage of district heating in \nwest Baiyin, and replace the existing low-efficiency and heavily polluting small heating boilers to \nsave energy and reduce air pollution. This component will improve living standards and help \npromote urban development. \n \nE.  Recommendations for Continuous Economic Transformation \n1.  Role of Government, Public and Private Sector  \n18.  The joint effort of the government, and the public and private sectors will help achieve \nthe goal of economic transformation. BMG will provide an enabling environment for investments \nand comfortable living conditions to encourage the participation of public and private sector \nenterprises  in  economic  activities  and  to  attract  external  investors  to  the  city.  Economic \ntransformation needs to follow market forces through competition to ensure its sustainability. \n \n2.  Upgraded City Infrastructure  \n19.  The construction of infrastructure will provide necessary facilities for new businesses \nand production, for improving the city traffic condition and living standards, and for improving the \noverall investment environment. New infrastructure will effectively promote new investments in \nthe area. The proposed Southern Baiyin infrastructure component will develop an approximately \n6 km2 area for industrial productions and new investments, which will serve as an engine to \neffectively help the city maintain sustainable economic growth. The proposed road improvement \nand district heating components will improve the urban traffic condition and living standards, \nwhich will facilitate the city\u2019s economic development and attract new investments. \n \n ", "    Appendix 2       29     \n3.  New Technologies, Products, and Concepts  \n20.  The success of economic transformation depends heavily on the introduction of new \ntechnologies, new products, and new concepts. For example, for the proposed SBIZ, Baiyin has \nthe  advantage  to  develop  fine  chemicals  and  nonferrous  metal  materials  based  on  local \nresources and markets. Furthermore, among the TDI and aromatic compounds as well as chlor-\nalkali complexes and fluoride compounds are the most promising productions for Baiyin.  \n \n4.  Small Businesses and the Private Sector \n21.  Successful growth in small businesses and the private sector will generate a significant \nimpact  for  economic  transformation.  BMG  will  continue  to  encourage  the  growth  of  small \nbusinesses to diversify the city\u2019s economy. BMG will strengthen the agency for promotion of \nsmall  businesses,  and  provide  networking  and  investment  opportunities,  and  train  the \nunemployed so that they can learn new skills and find new jobs. BMG will set up programs to \nhelp the growth of small businesses and the private sector. \n \n5.  Tertiary Sectors  \n22.  The GDP ratio of the primary, the secondary, and the tertiary sectors for Baiyin is \n14.4:50.5:35.1 in 2005. The ratio for Gansu province is 15.7:43.4:40.9, and that for the entire \ncountry is 12.5:47.3:40.3. The percentage of the tertiary sector in Baiyin is lower than the \naverage percentage for Gansu province. The BMG will promote and encourage the growth of \nthe tertiary sector as one of the directions for the economic transformation. A strategy for \ndeveloping the tertiary sector will be developed, based on the special conditions in Baiyin and \nthe market needs. BMG will play an active role in planning and promoting the development of \nthe sector, and provide funding support to encourage the development of service sectors such \nas tourism, information, banking, etc. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nDOMESTICALLY FUNDED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS IN BAIYIN \n \n1.  Having been a copper mining city for decades, Bayin is known as a major industrial \npolluter in the western part of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Apart from requesting \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  support,  Baiyin  has  initiated  a  number  of \nenvironmental  improvement  projects  with  funding  support  from  the  national  and  provincial \ngovernments. This appendix summarizes a few typical ongoing interventions and a briefing on \ntheir  links  to  Baiyin  municipal  government\u2019s  (BMG)  efforts  to  achieve  the  mandatory \nenvironmental control targets set by the Government for 2007. \n \nA.  Major Ongoing Domestically Funded Environmental Improvement Projects \n \n(i)  Baiyin Nonferrous Metal Corporation Acidifying System Improvement Project. \nTotal investment is CNY250 million (about $33 million at current exchange rate). The \npurpose  is  to  upgrade  the  processing  technology,  thus  increasing  the  sulfur \nutilization rate from 60% to 90% and reducing annual sulfur emission by 50,000 tons, \nreducing the annual discharge of acid industrial wastewater by 660,000 tons, and \nreducing the discharge of heavy metal pollutants including copper, lead, and arsenic \nby 300 tons; \n \n(ii)  Gansu Rare Earth Corporation Industrial Wastewater Treatment Project Phase \nII. Total investment is CNY7.21 million (about $950,000 at current exchange rate). \nThe purpose is to establish an industrial wastewater treatment pond with a capacity \nof 3 million cubic meters (m3). The pond will collect and treat all the industrial \nwastewater from the rare earth processing, thus achieving \u201czero discharge\u201d by this \nindustry to the Yellow River, reducing annual discharge of industrial wastewater by \n600,000  tons  and  decreasing  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD)  and  chemical \npollutant discharge by 2,502 tons per year; \n \n(iii)  Baiyin  Municipal  Wastewater  Treatment  Plant  Project.  Total  investment  is \nCNY101 million ($13 million at current exchange rate). The purpose is to increase \nthe municipal wastewater treatment capacity by 40,000 tons a day and to install \nwastewater  recycling  facilities  to  use  the  recycled  wastewater  and  stop  direct \ndischarge of municipal wastewater into the Yellow River. \n \nB.  Baiyin Mandatory Pollution Control Targets and Actions to Achieve Them \n \n2.  Under the 11th Five-Year Development Program for 2006\u20132010, the PRC has set 10% \nreduction  of  sulfur  dioxide  (SO )  emission  and  10%  reduction  of  COD  discharge  as  the \n2\nmandatory pollution control target for the nation as a whole. The central Government has \ndisaggregated national targets and assigned them to local governments at various levels as \ntheir annual mandatory targets for pollution control and environmental improvement. The targets \nspecified for Baiyin for 2007 are reduction of SO  emission by 33,000 tons and reduction of \n2\nCOD discharge by 1,500 tons. These targets will be mainly achieved by the domestically funded \nprojects above mentioned.   \n \n3.  Reduction of SO  Emission by 33,000 Tons.

Project Background \n1.  Baiyin city (Baiyin) is a medium-sized city located in Gansu province. The city was \nestablished  in  the  1950s  under  the  planned  economy  mainly  to  support  copper  mining \nproduction. Baiyin used to be the top copper mining area of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), accounting for one third of national production. After continued exploitation, the copper \nmines in Baiyin have been exhausted and abandoned. Mining of the other associated minerals \nis also on the decline, with closure projected in less than two decades. Baiyin is classified by the \nGovernment as one of the 18 resource-exhausted mining cities. Under the 11th Five-Year \nProgram (FYP) for 2006\u20132010, the Government has decided to provide special support, as a \nnational  priority,  for  these  resource-exhausted  mining  cities  to  facilitate  their  economic \ntransformation. \n \n2.  The  Project  will  provide  support  to  facilitate  economic  transformation  in  Baiyin  by \nstrengthening the urban services and infrastructures, and promoting capacity development. The \nProject  has  five  components:  (i)  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure,  (ii)  Baiyin  district  road \nimprovements, (iii) Pingchuan district road improvements, (iv) Baiyin district heating services, \nand (v) capacity development and institutional strengthening. \n \n3.  Baiyin municipal government (BMG) will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the Project. \nBMG  has  established  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  responsible  for  day-to-day \ncoordination and implementation of the Project. The four investment components of the Project \nwill be implemented by four implementing agencies (IAs).  \n \n4.  The details of the five components are summarized below: \n \n(i)  Component  1: Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure. Under this component, the \nProject will develop 6 square kilometers (km2) of industrial land with the basic \npublic infrastructure including about 24.9 kilometers (km) long of primary and \nsecondary  roads  and  related  water  supply  pipelines,  drainage  pipelines  and \nsewers, heating supply pipelines, optical-fabric cable and electricity distribution \nlines, lighting, and public green areas. \n \n(ii)  Component 2: Baiyin district road improvements.

Background \n \n1.  The proposed Project has four subprojects: (i) Southern Baiyin infrastructure; (ii) Baiyin \ndistrict  road  improvements;  (iii)  Pingchuan  district  road  improvements;  and  (iv)  Baiyin  district \nheating services. The proposed Project will provide additional sites for new production in southern \nBaiyin, improve the road and traffic conditions in Baiyin and Pingchuan districts, and increase the \narea covered by district heating in west Baiyin. \n   \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  Overall, the land acquisition and resettlement impacts of the Project will be significant. The \nimpacts by component are summarized in Table A11. In total, about 730.4 hectares (ha) of land \nwill be permanently acquired by the Project, of which 21% is classified as farmland (153.6 ha). \nPermanent land acquisition will affect 1,619 households or 6,272 people. The Project will also \nrequire the temporary acquisition of 13.5 ha of land, all of which is unoccupied state-owned land \nalong roads to be improved. A total of 328 households or 1,450 people will be relocated and about \n61,012 square meters (m2) of residential houses will be demolished. Forty-two enterprises and \nshops with a total of 1,378 employees will be affected, and 28,814 m2 of nonresidential structures \nwill  be  dismantled.  In  addition,  some  productive  assets,  ground  attachments,  and  public \ninfrastructure and facilities will be affected including electric poles, toilets, fences, hand-pumped \nwells, doors, pigpens, platform, barns, greenhouses, concrete and asphalt roads, and trees. Of the \ntotal affected population, 1,619 households or 6,272 people are rural residents, and 1,584 are \nurban residents, owners of structures with or without certificates, private business owners, and staff. \nThere are no ethnic minority people among the affected persons (APs). The resettlement plans \n(RPs) for the components will be updated based on a detailed design and submitted to the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for approval during implementation. \n \nC.  Policy and Legal Framework \n \n3.  The compensation for permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (1998) and the State Council Decision to Deepen Reform and \nStrictly Enforce Land Administration (Document 28 dated November 2004). House demolition is \nbased on the Provincial and Municipal Urban Housing Demolishment Administration Regulations. \nThe RPs for the investment components comply with PRC laws and regulations of resettlement \nand  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  Based  on  consultations  with  local \ngovernments and those affected, a set of compensation standards was adopted by the city project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  and  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  The  resettlement  principles \nestablished for the Project are as follows: (i) land acquisition and involuntary resettlement should \nbe avoided or minimized, where feasible, through alternative design options; (ii) compensation and \nentitlements must be based on replacement value and must be adequate to allow those affected to \nat least maintain their preproject standard of living, with the prospect of improvement; (iii) land \ntemporarily occupied and the period of disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) all the APs, \nlegal  and  illegal,  are  to  be  taken  into  consideration  and  accounted  for;  (v)  the  per  capita \nlandholding after land acquisition should be sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standard; \n(vi) where land allocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standards, \nother income-generating activities will be provided; (vii) a preferential policy will be applied to \n ", "     Appendix 11       47 \nvulnerable  groups  with  regard  to  compensation,  payment  of  special  fund,  minimum  living \nguarantee,  and  employment;  (viii)  all  APs  will  be  adequately  informed  about  eligibility, \ncompensation rates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, project implementation \nschedule; and (ix) close monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to identify and resolve any \nproblems.  \n \nD.  Compensation, Income, and Livelihood Restoration Scheme \n \n4.  For permanent land acquisition, a small portion of the land compensation will be given to \nthe village collective and the balance will be paid in cash to the APs. The resettlement subsidy and \nthe compensation for standing crops, trees, and ground attachments will be paid to the APs. For \nresidential  houses  and  nonresidential  (enterprises  and  shops)  houses  to  be  demolished, \ncompensation at replacement value will be paid to owners. The households that have to relocate \nwill  also  receive  a  relocation  allowance.  The  resettlement  strategy  encompasses  (i)  the \nreplacement of housing, and (ii) the restoration of livelihood and income. For people losing rural \nhousing, the township government and the village committees will arrange new sites and allocate \nnew house plots in advance to the APs. The APs will continue to live in their old houses until the \nnew houses are built. For households losing urban housing, compensation will be in cash at \nreplacement value or through house exchange. The township government and IAs will help the \nAPs find available housing close to their original homes, if preferred. The respective municipal \nPMO,  IAs,  and  township/local  governments  will  provide  necessary  assistance  for  house \nconstruction  and  relocation  during  resettlement  implementation,  especially  for  the  vulnerable \ngroups. \n \n5.  The measures for economic rehabilitation include (i) providing employment opportunities \nduring the project construction and operational phases; (ii) redistributing farmland within affected \ngroups/villages  wherever  possible;  (iii)  upgrading  existing  low-yield  farmland,  intensifying \nagriculture,  and  improving  irrigation  facilities;  (iv)  developing  off-farm  opportunities;  and  (v) \nproviding technical training to the APs to increase their skills. Relocated enterprises will have the \noptions  of  compensation  and  resettlement.  The  same  enterprises  will  reemploy  the  affected \nemployees. For vulnerable APs, the IAs will establish a special fund of CNY2,000 per household \nfor them to improve their living standards and assistance to restore their living conditions and \nincomes.   \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangement and Implementation Schedule \n \n6.  Each PMO and IA will have at least two full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and \nresettlement, respectively. The staff from each component\u2019s resettlement unit will take the lead \nresponsibility  for  coordinating  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  monitoring  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  They  will  work  closely  with  relevant  village  officials,  land \nadministration bureaus, and house demolition offices, and will be responsible for supervising and \nmonitoring resettlement (e.g., delivery of entitlements, selection of new housing sites, restoration of \nincomes, provision of replacement land, and other economic measures). A training program will be \norganized for the resettlement officers. Resettlement implementation will be scheduled to precede \nthe construction schedules of the components. Most resettlement activities will occur between \nMarch 2008 and December 2009. All compensation and assistances will be paid to APs before civil \nworks begin.  Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in each village, neighborhood, and \nenterprise and the compensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with village committees, \nhouseholds, and enterprises.  \n \n ", "48  Appendix 11 \nF.  Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance Procedures \n \n7.  In accordance with PRC national, provincial, and municipal policies and regulations for land \nacquisition, house demolition and resettlement, and in line with ADB policies and guidelines, the \nPMO/IAs conducted public consultations and disseminated information about the project to the \nAPs,and village governments during the project preparation stage. During meetings, interviews, \nfocus group discussions, public consultation workshops, and community consultation meetings, \nlocal representatives participated in the planning and their concerns have been integrated into the \nRPs. The draft RP was disclosed and distributed to the affected townships, villages, APs, and \nresettlement information booklets were disseminated to the APs on 20 June 2007. This booklet \nconfirms  the  project-affected  areas,  the  implementation  schedule  and  framework,  the \ncompensation standards for land acquisition and other assets, relocation assistance, livelihood \nrehabilitation strategy, and dispute resolution procedures. The RPs were posted on the ADB \nwebsite in June 2007. The RPs will be updated and finalized upon completion of engineering \ndesigns, and will be posted on the ADB website in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Information \nDisclosure Policy. The respective project IAs will establish project resettlement units for supervising \nimplementation, continuing public consultation, monitoring progress, and responding to grievances. \nThe grievance redress procedures are well-established and explanations will be included in the \nresettlement information booklets. \n \nG.  Budget \n \n8.  The  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  $15  million,  equivalent  to \nCNY116.99 million in 2007 prices, including contingencies. The cost estimates include costs of \ncompensation for land acquisition, house demolition, reestablishment of special facilities, planning, \nmanagement, training, and monitoring and evaluation. The government will provide a counterpart \nbudget  for  resettlement  activities,  including  support  where  fund  shortage  occurs  during \nresettlement implementation. \n \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n9.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  RP  implementation  will  be  conducted.  Monitoring \nmethodologies are specified in the RPs.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People Republic of China (PRC): \n \nBaiyin is a medium-sized city located in Gansu Province, one of the 12 less developed western provinces and \nautonomous regions that are targeted by the Central Government for support under the National Strategy for \nDevelopment of the West. The City consists of two urban districts (Baiyin and Pingchuan) and three counties \n(Huining, Jingtai, and Jingyuan) with 1.746 million people and a total area of 21,158 square kilometers (km2). \nThe Project will directly benefit 0.5 million people living in Baiyin and Pingchuan, especially the poor, through (i) \nimproved infrastructure including road networks and better road conditions; (ii) increased mobility, reduced \ntraffic congestion and improved public transportation; (iii) improved road safety and reduced traffic accidents; \n(iv) increased foreign and domestic investments resulting from the improved environment; (v) improved living \nenvironment and quality of life; (vi) better and quicker access to employment and schools, as well as social \nservices; (vii) increased employment and income-generation opportunities, especially for the poor who will \nbenefit from temporary jobs created during the construction phase and permanent jobs created during the \noperational phase; (viii) improved central heating supply; (ix) reduced air emissions of sulfur dioxide, carbon \ndioxide, nitrogen oxide, total suspended particulates, and solid wastes; (x) improved air quality; and (xi) reduced  \nuse of coal and coal briquettes that cause environmental and health impacts, particularly for the poor. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe poverty analysis is based on published statistical data, a socioeconomic questionnaire survey of 300 \nhouseholds, focus group discussions, and key informants interview in the project areas. Baiyin city has an \naverage municipal poverty line of CNY156 per capita per month for urban districts (Baiyin and Pingchuan). On \nthe basis of these poverty lines, 64,619 people or 25,406 households were classified as urban poor and were \nentitled to receive the minimum living guarantee (MLG) from the Baiyin Civil Affairs Bureau in 2005. The total \nurban  poor  population  living  under  MLG  in  2005  included  laid-off  workers  (40.65%),  retirees  (1.95%), \nunemployed  (10.46%),  \u201cthree-no\u2019s\u201d1 (0.59%),  working  employees  (16.16%),  and  the  others  (30.20%).  In \naddition, there were 436 urban people and 664 rural people that received temporary lowest cost-of-living,and \n4,319 rural people received lowest cost-of-living in a fixed period. By the current definition of the poor line, \napproximately 15.35% persons of the total urban population live under the MLG in the project areas, including \n33,096 persons in Baiyin and 12,030 in Pingchuan. People under the MLG receive MLG fund from the Civil \nAffairs Bureau of Baiyin city and Pingchuan district. The rural poverty population in Baiyin city decreased from \n163,500 in 2000 to 147,800 at the end of 2005, and the poverty ratio declined from 12.30% to 11.12%. With the \nenhancement of integrated agricultural development, the net income of the farmer increased from CNY1,601 in \n2001 to CNY2,023 in 2005, with an increase of CNY422. In Huining, the key national poverty county, the net \nincome of farmers increased from CNY1,165 in 2001 to CNY1,575 in 2005, an increase of CNY410.  \nVarious poverty reduction measures are being implemented by the Baiyin municipal government (BMG), \nincluding (i) extending to the elderly insurance coverage, health and  employment benefits; and (ii) establishing \nand improving the guarantee mechanism for land-losing farmers and resettled people. In 2005, BMG disbursed \nCNY5 million as medical assistance, CNY22.79 million as reemployment assistance, CNY52.06 million as basic \nprovision protection, and CNY15.32 million as relief from natural disasters. In addition, BMG implemented \nprograms to waive agricultural taxes, increase the provision of inputs to agriculture, formulate favorable policies \nof subsidies for farmers, which resulted in a CNY98 per capita increase in farmers\u2019 benefits. The income of \nfarmers in the poor area has been further increased. At the end of 2005, the average net income per capita \nreached CNY2,023, CNY128 over the previous year, an increase of 6.75%. All these efforts have achieved \npositive results toward poverty reduction in Baiyin city. \n                                                 \n1 The term \u201cthree no\u2019s\u201d means no jobs, no ability to work, and no financial support from family and other resources. \n ", "Appendix 12       51 \nThe  Project  will  create  3,640  person-years  direct  and  indirect  short-term  employment  opportunities,  with \nearnings  totaling  CNY49.09  million  during  the  construction  phase,  and  1,350  long-term  employment \nopportunities, with wages totaling CNY18.14 million per annum during the operation phase. The poor, women, \nand  ethnic  minorities  will  be  given  priority  in  both  short-term  and  the  mid-  and  long-term  employment \nopportunities. In addition, local procurement of the materials required for the Project is expected to create \nadditional jobs. A health benefit analysis was conducted to estimate the health benefits associated with the \nimproved central heating supply services. It is estimated that the direct annual health benefit from the urban \nenvironmental improvement is CNY4.66 million. Improved heating infrastructure will reduce morbidity and \nmortality rate from air-related diseases, associated medical costs, particularly for poor, women, children and the \nelderly. It will also reduce women\u2019s burden of housework and facilitate longer study hours for children/students \nduring winter. However, for the full health benefits to be realized, the following will be required: (i) parallel \nimprovements in public health education, (ii) higher standards of personal hygiene, (iii) prevention and control, \nand (iv) improved housing and living conditions. These will be particularly important for the poor, who are likely \nto suffer most from the incidence of pollution-related diseases. The arrangements for monitoring health benefits \nwill be incorporated in the project performance management system to be established for comprehensive \nmonitoring of the project impact.  \n \nThus the project will benefit the poor, women, the elderly, and the floating population through improved roads \nand public transportation services, environmental quality and health benefits. Poor households that tend to \nreside in areas with poor service levels and are less able to cope with the disruption and illness caused by poor \nservices will gain significant benefits. The proposed tariff reforms for heating services and provision of heating \nsubsidies to poor households will significantly benefit the beneficiary population, especially poor households.  \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?                   Yes          No  \n \nStakeholder analysis was conducted during the poverty and social assessment. The primary stakeholders of the \nProject area include urban residents, affected persons (APs), industries and businesses, the executing agency \n(EA) and implementing agencies (IAs); the secondary stakeholders include relevant government agencies, such \nas Civil Affairs Bureau, Poverty Reduction Office, Health Bureau etc. During the project preparation, a socio-\neconomic survey of 300 households, stakeholder consultation workshops, focus group discussions, and key \ninformant interviews were conducted to gain a better understanding of the demand, needs, and interests of the \nstakeholders. Several rounds of public consultations in the project areas were carried out to prepare the \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  the  resettlement  plans  (RPs).  The  public  consultations  and \ninformation disclosure included (i) introducing the project components to the stakeholders; (ii) soliciting ideas, \nsuggestions, comments on the potential social and environmental impacts of the Project; and (iii) presenting the \nfindings of the EIA and RPs, summarizing potential social and environmental impacts and mitigation measure, \nand providing answers raised by workshop participants. Public consultations and information disclosure of the \nRPs were conducted during surveys, community meetings, interviews, and workshops. The results of these \nmeetings and concerns of the APs, particularly the poor and women, were integrated into the RPs.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                    Yes          No \n \nPublic consultation and participation have been the core element of the project design and will continue during \nproject implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Ongoing consultations will also be carried out by the IAs to \nunderstand and meet the evolving needs and expectations of the users as well as increase the awareness of \nthe public, especially the beneficiaries, about the benefits of the Project, and encourage the active involvement \nof local communities to maximize their support to the Project. Public consultation and participation will be \ncarried  out  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  RP  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The \nconsultations, including a grievance mechanism, will continue during land acquisition and resettlement so that \nthe problems and needs of APs are properly addressed in a timely manner.  \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nResults from the household survey and focus group discussion indicate that women are primarily responsible \nfor heating provision and caring for the sick and the elderly. Time and efforts spent on these activities will be \nreduced with the improvement of transportation and heating facilities, easy access to social services. Thus, \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \npeople will have time to engage in income-generating activities, to have fun with the family, and to have \nadequate  leisure  time.  Inadequate  public  transportation  and  central  heating  supply  contribute  to  gender \ninequities in the burden of household work. The poverty and social assessment indicated that women strongly \nsupport  the  Project.  Women  believe  that  the  Project  will  improve  the  urban  living  environment,  create \nemployment opportunities, and reduce the incidence of airborne diseases. To maximize the project benefits, \nwomen will be given priority in employment and training opportunities during the project construction and \noperation phases. A proactive employment program for women will be adopted by the IAs.  \nHas an output been prepared?                     Yes          No \nE.

Among the four investment components, the district heating services component and the \nSouthern  Baiyin  infrastructure  component  will  generate  operating  revenues.  The  financial \nfeasibility of these two components was assessed by calculating the financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) as the measure of financial benefits and comparing this indicator to the weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC). All revenue and cost flow streams were expressed in constant \nprices. The FIRR was calculated on an incremental basis. The differences in revenue and cost \nstreams between a \u201cwith-project and without-project scenarios were evaluated and discounted \nto present value over the projection period. \n \n2.  Based on the 2 years\u2019 operation of Minyue District Heating Corporation (MDHC) and the \nfinancial projection provided by the Design Institute based on the District Heating Expansion \nProgram for the MDHC concession area, the FIRR for the district heating services component is \n6.4%. \n  \n3.  The WACC for the component was calculated at 3.02% using the following assumptions: \n(i) the relending agreement between the Baiyin municipal government (BMG) and MDHC will \nadopt the same terms as the loan between Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), with an estimated interest rate of 5.71%; (ii) risk premium of equity \nover debt is 8%; (iii) the domestic inflation rate is 3.0%; (iv) income tax remains at 33%; and (v) \nthe foreign exchange risk premium is 2.4%. \n \n4.  The Baiyin High-Tech Industrial Park (BHTIP) is part of BMG, but is not a financially \nindependent entity. Financial analysis was conducted for the Southern Baiyin infrastructure \ncomponent  to  assess  the  financial  viability  of  this  revenue-generating  component  and  its \nfinancial implications for economic transformation. The main revenue is generated through fees \ncollected by the BHTIP, which leases or transfers the land use right of the fully developed \nindustrial land to tenant enterprises. The FIRR was calculated using the current promotion rate.  \n \n5.  The financial analysis was conducted on the assumptions that (i) the total land area \navailable for leasing will be approximately 7,817 mu (667 square meters [m2]) after deducting \nthe land areas allocated for roads, buffer zones, and other public infrastructure including green \nareas; and (ii) industrial land will be leased out or the land use right will be transferred in 5 years \nafter development. The FIRR throughout the project period of 25 years will be at 8.7%. The \nWACC is calculated at 3.13%, using the same parameters as those adopted for the district \nheating services component. \n \n6.  Sensitivity analysis was conducted for the FIRR of these two components (Tables A13.1 \nand A13.2). \n \nTable A13.1: District Heating Services Component \nVariables  FIRR (%)  Sensitivity Index \nBase Case  6.4   \n10% increase in capital cost overrun  5.5  1.46 \n10% decrease in revenue  3.8  4.10 \n20% decrease in revenue  0.6  4.52 \n10% increase in operation cost  5.2  1.90 \nOne-year delay in project completion  4.6   \n10% decrease in revenue plus 10% increase in operation cost  1.2  8.06 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "Appendix 13        55 \n \n7.  Sensitivity analysis reveals that the district heating services component can generate a \nFIRR higher than the WACC if adverse impacts do not exceed 10%. With an existing collection \nrate of 95%, the track record of MDHC in revenue collection is encouraging. Since coal and \nelectricity account for 80% of the operation cost of MDHC, the FIRR of this component will be \nsensitive to changes in the prices of electricity and coal. The financial sustainability of MDHC is \nprotected  under  the  Government\u2019s  heating  reform  policy  and  regulations,  which  allow \nnegotiation of tariff adjustments if the changes in energy prices exceed 10%. In the case of \nsignificant increase in the costs of MDHC\u2019s operation inputs leading to a cost recovery ratio \nbelow 1.2:1, MDHC may request BMG for a tariff review. BMG will, if the request is considered \nreasonable, use its best efforts to provide support to MDHC to maintain its financial viability. In \ncase tariff adjustment is considered the best option, BMG will organize public consultation with \nkey stakeholders including the representative of the low income families or other mechanisms \nas provided for in the laws and regulations on utility tariff settings before adjusting the tariff. The \ncomponent is also sensitive to revenues. If the proposed district heating system fails to achieve \nfull-scale service expansion, it will be difficult to make the system financially viable without a \ntariff increase. \n \nTable A13.2: Southern Baiyin Infrastructure Component \nVariables  FIRR (%)  Sensitivity Index \nBase Case  8.7   \n10% increase in capital cost overrun  7.7  1.10 \n10% decrease in land revenue  7.8  1.04 \n10% decrease in tax revenue  7.5  1.31 \n10% decrease in both land and tax revenues  6.6  2.37 \n20% decrease in both land and tax revenues  4.4  2.45 \n10% increase in operation cost  8.4  0.29 \n1-year delay in project completion  6.4   \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8.  From the financial analysis, it can be concluded that the Southern Baiyin infrastructure \ncomponent is financially viable. This component will be able to maintain a FIRR higher than the \nWACC under a combined adverse impact of 1-year implementation delay, 10% decrease in \nrevenue, and 10% increase in operation cost. Sensitivity analysis reveals that this component is \nsensitive to revenues. If the industrial land developed under the Project fails to attract investors, \nthis component will run into financial difficulty. \n \n \n ", "56   Appendix 14 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  Economic  analysis  was  conducted  for  each  investment  component  and  the  Project \nfollowing the steps of demand forecast, least-cost analysis, assessment of economic costs and \nbenefits, and calculation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). Project risks were \nassessed  through  sensitivity  analysis  under  different  risk  scenarios.  Baiyin  is  a  resource-\nexhausted mining city that is in a process of economic transformation. Demand forecast was \nconducted based on a sector review in line with the Baiyin Urban Development Master Plan \n(2001\u20132020) endorsed by the Baiyin People\u2019s Congress. \n \nA.  Least-Cost Analysis \n \n2.  The  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure  component  is  to  expand  the  Southern  Baiyin \nindustrial zone (SBIZ) by developing 6 square kilometers (km2) of industrial land. Given its \ngeographic location, the SBIZ has only two alternatives for expansion: to the west or to the \nsouth. Expansion to the south is the least-cost option, because it will enable the SBIZ to better \nutilize existing urban infrastructure including the road network, wastewater treatment facilities, \nand power supply system, and will require less land acquisition and resettlement. Analyses for \nthe  two  road  improvements  components  were  undertaken  to  compare  two  alternatives:  (i) \nbuilding  a systematic road  transport  framework  for long-term  urban  development  (with  the \nProject), or (ii) relying on strengthened road maintenance of the existing urban roads (without \nthe Project). \n \n3.  Least-cost  analysis  for  district  heating  services  component  compared  the  costs  of \nalternative heating systems including individual electric boiler (1.8 megawatts [MW]), individual \ngas-fired heating facility (7 MW), small coal-fired community heating boiler (less than 7 MW), \nand large coal-fired heating boiler (58 MW). These alternatives are technically feasible but \nmutually exclusive for the Project. Alternative analysis concludes that centralized district heating \nbased on a large coal-fired heating boiler is the least-cost option. Alternative analysis took into \nconsideration the observations that (i) coal will remain as the main source of energy for heating \nsupply because Gansu province is short of gas or oil supply; and (ii) power-heat co-generation \nwill not be financially viable due to the adequate supply of electricity power on the local market, \nwhich leaves no room for a relatively small power and heat co-generation plant to survive \nwithout a subsidy. \n \nB.  Economic Evaluation \n \n4.  Economic Costs. Financial costs, including physical contingencies, are converted, after \ndeducting taxes and duties, by applying the conversion factors to present the economic costs in \ndomestic  price  numeraire.  Economic  costs  include  (i)  the  costs  of  construction  including \nphysical contingencies and the cost of land acquisition and resettlement, and (ii) the costs of \noperation and maintenance. \n \n5.  Economic  Benefits.  The  economic  benefits  for  the  different  components  were \ncalculated with different approaches. Economic benefits of the Southern Baiyin infrastructure \ncomponent were calculated based on (i) increased land value, and (ii) incremental wages and \nother incomes generated by the employment opportunities created in the SBIZ. \n \n6.  The economic benefits of the two road improvements components were calculated in \nterms of savings resulting from the improved roads and traffic conditions under the with-Project \nscenario against the alternative without-Project scenario. The economic benefits consist of (i) \n ", "Appendix 14         57 \nsavings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) savings in travel time, and (iii) savings due to reduced \ncosts of road accidents.    \n \n7.  The economic benefits for the district heating services component include savings from \nthe improved energy efficiency in the form of reduced coal consumption, and environmental \nimprovement  resulting  from  reduced  environmental  costs  due  to  the  reduction  in  pollutant \nemissions  such  as  sulfur  dioxide,  total  suspended  particulates,  and  carbon  dioxide.  The \nincremental economic benefits were calculated as the difference between the centralized district \nheating system proposed for the Project and the existing small community heating boilers. \n \n8.  EIRR Calculation. The EIRR was calculated for the investment components and the \nProject, respectively. The EIRR for the Southern Baiyin infrastructure component is 12.98%. \nThe EIRR for the two road improvements components is 14.23%. The EIRR for the district \nheating services component, calculated under two scenarios, is (i) 19.70% if the benefits from \nreduction in environmental costs are not included, or (ii) 23.78% if the benefits The  EIRR \ncalculation shows that the Project is economically viable.  \n \nC.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n9.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  to  test  the  impact  of  unfavorable  changes  of \nvariables on the calculated economic net present value and the EIRR of the Project. Sensitivity \nanalysis  confirms  that  the  Project  will  remain  economically  viable  despite  an  unfavorable \nchange in variables: 20% cost increase, 20% benefits decrease, or 1-year delay in project \ncompletion (Table  A14)  More  detailed  analyses  for  specific  investment  components  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \nTable A14: Sensitivity Analysis for Economic Viability of the Overall Project \n  ENPV   EIRR  \nVariables  (CNY million)  (%) \nBase Case  216.71  14.26 \n10% cost increase  135.91  13.33 \n20% cost increase   55.10  12.51 \n10% benefit decrease  114.24  13.24 \n20% benefit decrease   11.76  12.13 \n1-year delay in project completion  112.84  13.47 \nENPV = economic net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080102101151+08'00'", "Author": "AG4", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rrp: prc 40051, china, chinese urban development project, gansu baiyin project, water", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080124161357+08'00'", "Title": "Gansu Baiyin Urban Development Project"}}
