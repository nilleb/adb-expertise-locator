An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  was \nundertaken  for  each  of  the  investment  components  under  the \nProject. A regional environmental impact assessment (REIA) was \nundertaken  for  Southern  Baiyin  industrial  zone  (SBIZ).  The \nsummary EIA was circulated to the Board of Directors of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  uploaded  on  the  ADB  website  on \n29 June 2007. \n \nBaiyin  city  (Baiyin)  is  a  medium-sized  city  located  in  Gansu \nprovince.  The  city  was  established  in  1950s  under  the  planned \neconomy mainly to support copper mining production. Baiyin used \nto be the top copper miner of the PRC, accounting for one third of \nthe  national  production.  After  continued  exploitation,  the  copper \nmines in Baiyin had been exhausted and were abandoned. Mining \nof  the  other  associated  minerals  is  also  on  a  declining  trend. \nBaiyin is one of the 18 mining cities classified by the Government \nas resource-exhausted. Under the 11th Five- Year Program (FYP) \nfor  2006\u20132010,  the  Government  has  decided  to  provide  special \nsupport, as a national priority, for the resource-exhausted mining \ncities to facilitate their economic transformation. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  support \nfacilitate  economic \ntransformation  in  Baiyin  by  strengthening  urban  services  and \ninfrastructure,  and  promoting  capacity  development.  The  Project \nhas five components: (i) Southern Baiyin infrastructure, (ii) Baiyin \nroad improvements, (iii) Pingchuan road improvements, (iv) Baiyin \ndistrict  heating  services,  and  (v)  capacity  cevelopment  and \ninstitutional  strengthening.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nUrban Sector Strategy and the strategic focus of ADB operation in \nPRC as identified and discussed with the Government during the \nongoing country partnership strategy consultation process. All the \ninvestment  components  under  the  project  are  included  in  the \nBaiyin Urban Development Master Plan (2001\u20132020) endorsed by \nthe Baiyin People\u2019s Congress. \n \n\nto \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthat \n\n(BMG) \n\nBaiyin is one of the 18 mining cities classified by the Government \nas resource-exhausted. In PRC, Baiyin stands for a new model of \neconomic  transformation  from  a  resource-exhausted  mining  city \ninto  a  new  industrial  center  through  technology  upgrading  and \nextension,  and  diversification  of  the  existing  production  chains. \nADB  involvement  in  the  Project  will  provide  not  only  financial \nsupport  needed  to  accelerate  economic  transformation,  but  also \ninternational knowledge and policy advice for the Baiyin municipal \nthe  economic \nto  help  ensure \ngovernment \ntransformation  will  be  accomplished \nin  a  sustainable  and \nenvironment-friendly  manner.  The  Project  will  also  play  a  role  in \ndemonstrating  economic \nfor  other  resource-\nexhausted mining cities. \n \nThe impact of the Project will be the sustainable and environment- \nfriendly  urban  development  of  Baiyin.  The  outcome  will  be  the \nfacilitated economic transformation and improved quality of life in \nBaiyin. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $161.53  million  equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties of $4.7 million.  \n \n \n\ntransformation \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank Loan \nDomestic Bank \nBaiyin Municipal Government \nPingchuan District Government \nMinyue District Heating Corporation \n                        Total \n\nAmount \n($ million equivalent) \n80.00 \n12.08 \n55.48 \n  5.59 \n  8.38 \n           161.53 \n\n% \n\n   49.5 \n     7.5 \n   34.3 \n     3.5 \n     5.2 \n 100.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  of  $80 \nmillion  to  finance  49.5%  of  the  project  cost,  including  financing \ncharges  during  construction.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nbalance  through  a  combination  of  BMG  and  Pingchuan  district \ngovernment  (PDG)  budget  resources,  domestic  loans  from  PRC \nbanks,  and  equity  investment  from  Minyue  District  Heating \nCorporation (MDHC). \n \nThe  ADB  loan  of  $80  million  will  be  provided  from  the  ordinary \ncapital  resources  under \ninterbank  offered  rate \nits  London \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n\nlending \n\n\fAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe  Government  of  PRC  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the \nGansu  provincial  government,  which  will  onlend  to  BMG,  the \nExecuting Agency, on the same terms and conditions as those of \nthe  ADB  loan.  Relevant  portions  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \nfurther onlent, on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB  loan,  by  BMG  to  PDG  and  MDHC,  the  implementing \nagencies  (IAs),  for  the  Pingchuan  district  road  improvements \ncomponent and district heating Services component, respectively. \nAs  the  end-borrowers  BMG,  PDG,  and  MDHC  will  assume,  for \ntheir relevant portions of the loan proceeds, the foreign exchange \nand interest variation risks of the ADB loan.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2012 \n \n31 December 2011 \n\nimplementation,  and \n\nthe  progress  of  project \n\n(BHTIP)  Management  Commission, \n\n \nBaiyin Municipal Government \n \nBMG  has  established  a  project  leading  group  (PLG),  headed  by \nthe mayor to direct the Project and provide policy guidance during \nproject implementation. Under the PLG, BMG has set up a project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  to  coordinate  the  implementation  of \nproject  activities  on  behalf  of  BMG.  The  PMO  will  (i)  ensure \nadequate  interdepartmental  and  interagency  coordination,  (ii) \nmonitor \n(iii) \ncoordinate communication with ADB and the agencies concerned. \n \nThere  are  four  IAs  for  the  Project:  (i)  Baiyin  High-Tech  Industrial \nPark \nfor \nimplementing  the  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure  component;  (ii) \nBaiyin  City  Construction  Bureau \nfor \nimplementing the Baiyin road improvements component; (iii) PDG, \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  Pingchuan  road  improvements \ncomponent;  and  (iv)  MDHC,  responsible  for  implementing  the \ndistrict  heating  services  component.  Among  the  four,  BHTIP  and \nBCCB are part of the BMG. PDG is a local government unit under \nthe jurisdiction of BMG. MDHC is a state share-controlled public-\nprivate  corporation.  A  project \nimplementation  unit  will  be \nestablished  in  each  IA  and  will  report  to  the  respective  IA  for \nundertaking detailed implementation activities. \n \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  shall  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive  bidding, \nnational competitive bidding, or shopping procedures will be used, \ndepending on the circumstances of each contract package. \n \n\nresponsible \n\nresponsible \n\n(BCCB), \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nAbout 18 person-months of international and 116 person-months \nof  national  consulting  services  will  be  provided  for  the  capacity \ndevelopment  and  institutional  strengthening  component.  The \nconsultants  will  help  BMG \n(i)  design  and  establish  an \nenvironmental  management  system  for  the  SBIZ,  (ii)  develop  a \ngeographic information system-based urban management system \nto improve urban planning and road and bridge management, and \n(iii)  provide  project  management  and  construction  supervision \nto  ADB\u2019s \nsupport.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  according \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  more  than  475,000  urban \npresidents  in  the  project  areas  through  construction  of  urban \ninfrastructure for economic transformation, improved urban roads, \nand expanded and enhanced district heating supply. The Project \nwill provide the infrastructure and consulting service inputs to help \nBMG  manage  and  accomplish  the  economic  transformation  in  a \nsustainable  and  environment-friendly  manner.  When  completed, \nthe SBIZ is expected to provide more than 5,400 permanent jobs \nfor skilled laborers whose jobs are being affected by the decline of \nthe mining resources.  \n \nThrough  the  district  heating  services  component,  the  Project  will \nreplace  63  small  polluting  coal-fire  heating  boilers  with  a  more \nefficient  and  environment-friendly  centralized  district  heating \nsystem. By the year 2015, the heating service area will expand by \n2.6  million  square  meters  and  benefit  about  20,000  households \namong  whom  about  10%  are  low-income  families.  The  district \nheating services component will also help reduce the emission of \nsulfur  dioxide  by  185  tons  per  year,  reduce  consumption  of  coal \nby 5,700 tons per year, and improve public health and indoor air \nquality  by  eliminating  numerous  indoor  coal-burning  stoves  and \nswitching to district heating, particularly for the poor.  \n \nThe  road  improvement  components  will  build  up  the  basic  urban \nroad  frameworks  in  the  two  urban  centers  of  Baiyin\u2014Baiyin  and \nPingchuan districts\u2015to meet their long-term development needs. \nThe  improved  road  systems  will  help  strengthen  public  transport \nservice  and  improve  road  safety  by  providing  public  transport \nfacilities,  increasing  bus  lines,  and  reducing  the  road  accident \nfatalities in 2011 by about 10% from the 2005 baseline. \n \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual \ntechnical  risks. \nConventional  engineering  designs  and  technology  with  proven \nrecords of reliable performance are adopted for all the investment \ncomponents.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  support  the \nPMO  and  IAs  to  ensure  timely  implementation  of  the  Project  in \naccordance with the design requirements and quality standards. \n \n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nThe risk may arise from the induced environmental impact due to \nthe intensified industrial activities in the SBIZ. To mitigate the risk \nin  a  systematic  manner,  BMG  has  undertaken  a  REIA  to  assess \nthe environmental impact from the industrial activities in both the \nexisting  BHTIP  and  the  SBIZ  to  be  developed under  the  Project. \nAn  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  has  been  developed \nunder  the  REIA  to  mitigate  the  identified  environmental  risks.  In \naddition  to  the  EMP,  consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  help \nBMG design and introduce an urban environmental management \nsystem  to  ensure  that  the  urban  economic  transformation  will  be \nconducted  and  accomplished  in  a  sustainable  and  environment- \nfriendly manner. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n

a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Gansu Baiyin Urban Development Project. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  strengthen  the \nurban  sustainability  of  Baiyin  City  (Baiyin)  in  Gansu  province,  by  facilitating  the  economic \ntransformation  of  this  resource-exhausted  mining  city.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nMedium-Term  Strategy  (2006-2008)  and  Urban  Sector  Strategy.1 This  report  is  based  on  the \nresults  of  the  Loan  Appraisal  Mission,  as  well  as  discussions  with  the  central  and  local \ngovernments,  relevant  agencies,  and  community  organizations. 2 The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nSince the PRC initiated economic reforms in 1978, rapid urbanization has accompanied \nsignificant economic progress. The urban population has nearly tripled from about 190 million in \n1980  to  more  than  560  million  in  2005,  and  now  accounts  for  more  than  43%  of  the  national \npopulation.  The  Government\u2019s  agenda  for  economic  reform  and  social  development  aims  to \naccelerate urbanization and to achieve a balanced development of the large and medium-sized \ncities as well as the small cities and towns. Consequently, the urban population is expected to \nreach 47% of the total population by 2010, thereby increasing the demand for urban services.3 \nThe increasing urban population, industrialization, and economic development are straining the \noverloaded infrastructure, and contributing to widespread pollution and environmental threats in \nPRC  cities.  Without  significant  investment,  the  urban  environment  will  degrade,  economic \ndevelopment will be encumbered, and the people\u2019s quality of life will deteriorate. \n \n4. \nWithin the urban sector, PRC has identified 118 cities that were developed, depending \non  mining  of  particular  natural  resources  of  their  localities.  They  account  for  18%  of  the  total \ncities in the PRC and provide livelihood for a total urban population of 154 million. Many of these \nmining  cities  are  located  in  the  remote  and  less  developed  western  PRC.  They  share  a  very \nsimilar  history  and  common  characteristics:  (i)  they  were  established  in  the  1950s  or  1960s \nunder the planned economy with sole responsibility for supporting mining production, with little \nattention  given  to  urban  sustainability;  (ii)  in  the  past,  the  state  through  central  planning \nallocated all their outputs  for national development, leaving little resources for local investments \non  urban  development;  and  (iii)  the  natural  resources  they  depend  on  are  now  diminishing  or \nare  being  exhausted  after  decades  of  mining  production.  As  a  consequence,  most  of  these \nmining  cities  have  encountered  great  difficulties  in  the  urbanization  process  due  to  their \nremoteness,  their  imbalanced  economic  structures,  their  limited  financial  capacity,  their  poor \nurban  infrastructure,  and  their  limited  development  prospects.  Of  those  cities,  47  are  under \nthreat  of  resource  exhaustion,  and  18  are  classified  as  resource-exhausted  cities,  thereby \nposing a special challenge to urbanization in the PRC. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

Beijing.  \n\n\fExperience  worldwide  indicates  that  resource-dependent  mining  cities  may  have \n5. \ndifferent  options  in  response  to  a  diminishing  mining  resource.  These  include  abandoning  the \ntown  when  mining  becomes  uneconomical,  converting  the  abandoned  mines  and  mining \nfacilities  into  a  museum  or  cultural  heritage  sites  that  may  have  an  educational  and \nentertainment function while providing livelihood for a small population, or developing alternative \nindustries  in  the  nonmining  sectors  as  the  new  engine  for  continued  growth  and  sustainable \ndevelopment. Given their sizes and the populations they support, most of these mining cities in \nthe PRC would have to explore the possibilities to develop alternative industries for sustainable \ndevelopment.  Under  the  11th  Five-Year  Program  (FYP)  for  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment  (2006\u20132010),  the  Government  has  decided  to  provide  special  support,  as  a \nnational  priority,  for  these  resource-exhausted  cities  to  facilitate  their  economic  transformation \nfrom  the  traditional  mining  bases  established  under  the  planned  economy  into  dynamic  and \nsustainable urban centers under a market economy. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nProject  Background.  Baiyin  is  a  medium-sized  city  in  Gansu  province,  one  of  the  12 \n6. \nless  developed  western  provinces  and  autonomous  regions  targeted  by  the  Government  for \nsupport  under  the  National  Strategy  for  Development  of  the  West  (NSDW).  Like  many  other \nmining  cities,  Baiyin  was  established  in  the  1950s  under  the  planned  economy,  mainly  to \nsupport the development and production of Baiyin Nonferrous Metal Corporation (BNMC), which \nused  to  be  the  PRC\u2019s  top  copper  mine,  accounting  for  about  one  third  of  national  copper \nproduction. Over the past 50 years, Baiyin has been developed into an important national center \nfor  nonferrous  metal  mining,  smelting,  and  initial  processing,  and  an  energy  and  chemical \nproduction  center  of  Gansu  province.  Baiyin  now  covers  a  total  land  area  of  21,158  square \nkilometers  (km2)  and  has  a  population  of  1.75  million  (2005).  Most  of  the  land  under  the \njurisdiction  of  the  Baiyin  municipal  government  (BMG)  are  uncultivated  and  undeveloped  arid \nland without any human settlement. Baiyin has two urban districts: (i) Baiyin district, which has a \nland area of 1,373 km2, a population of about 279,000, and where the BMG is seated; and (ii) \nPingchuan  district  with  a  land  area  of  2,106  km2  and  a  population  of  about  196,300.  The  two \nurban districts are about 78 kilometers (km) apart. They are connected by a newly constructed \nexpressway  that  is  well-integrated  with  the  surrounding  national  and  provincial  expressway \nsystems, most of which have been built as part of the NSDW.  \n \n7. \nRapid development of the basic infrastructures in the west, supported under the NSDW \nover  the  past  few  years,  has  provided  Baiyin,  which  used  to  be  geographically  remote  and \nrelatively  isolated,  with  the  basic  means  to  integrate  itself  with  the  national  and  world  market \nthrough  road,  railway,  air  transport,  and  telecommunication  services.  Investors  have  been \nattracted to this mining city by its advantages including adequate supply of skilled labors, low-\ncost land, and its easy access to both market and resources. Such advantages have resulted in \na  steady  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  averaging  11.4%  a  year  during  the  10th  FYP \nperiod (2001\u20132005) and a reduction in the proportion of the people living below the government \npoverty line from 12.4% to 10.8%.    \n \nAlong with continued growth of mining production, the carrying capacity of Baiyin\u2019s urban \n8. \ninfrastructure  has  been  stretched  to  its  limit,  leading  to  severe  environmental  and  social \ndevelopment  problems  that  affect  not  only  the living  standards  of  the  city  dwellers but  also  its \ndevelopment prospects. The most acute challenge to future development of Baiyin is the urgent \nneed to diversify its economic base in view of the diminishing mining resources after decades of \nexploitation.  The  two  main  copper  mines  of  BNMC  have  already  been  exhausted  and \nabandoned.  Mining  of  the  other  associated  minerals  is  also  on  the  decline,  with  closure \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\ffor \n\nTo  set \n\nthe  direction \n\nprojected  in  less  than  two  decades.  Thousands  of  highly  skilled  workers  are  looking  for  new \nemployment opportunities to survive.  \n \n9. \nlong-term  development  of  Baiyin,  BMG  conducted  a \ncomprehensive study in 2001 to formulate the Baiyin Urban Development Master Plan (2001\u2013\n2020). By careful examination of the local advantages, the study has identified the potential of \nthe  city  to  develop  into  a  diversified  economic  center  for  sustained  growth  through  economic \ntransformation.  Based  on  the  master  plan,  BMG  has  identified  nonferrous  metal  industry, \nelectricity  power,  coal  mining,  and  chemical  industry\u2015four  leading  industries\u2015as  the  engines \nfor  sustained  economic  growth,  which  are  further  supported  by  eight  supporting  industries \nincluding rare earth, fine chemical, new energy, agroprocessing, and tourism (Appendix 2). \n \nBMG  has  recognized  that  success  in  economic  transformation  needs  the  joint  effort  of \n10. \nthe public and private sectors and should be based on local advantages and market forces. In \nthis  context,  BMG  has  developed  a  partnership  with  the  enterprises  and  industrial  investors \nthrough  which  BMG  will  make  an  initial  investment  (including  providing  the  basic  public \ninfrastructure  and  the  industrial  land)  to  provide  an  enabling  environment  for  economic \ntransformation, while the enterprises and the industrial investors will make industrial investment \nto upgrade technology and to diversify and extend the existing production chains. Through this \nmechanism,  with  support  from  the  Chinese  Academy  of  Sciences,  BMG  has  achieved  initial \nsuccess  in  establishing  the  Baiyin  High-Tech  Industrial  Park  (BHTIP)  as  the  platform  to  foster \neconomic  diversification  and  transformation.  Since  2003,  the  BHTIP  has  attracted  43  new \nenterprises,  most  of  which  are  privately  owned  or  jointly  owned  by  the  public  and  private \ninvestors, that have made $436 million in investments and created 1,850 permanent jobs. Given \nthe  initial  success  of  the  BHTIP,  a  pipeline  of  new  applicant  enterprises  has  been  developed \nwaiting  for  new  industrial  land.  Encouraged  by  the  promising  potential,  BMG  has  decided  to \ndevelop  the  Southern  Baiyin  industrial  zone  (SBIZ)  in  accordance  with  the  Baiyin  Urban \nDevelopment  Master  Plan  (2001\u20132020).  The  SBIZ  has  an  approved  land  area  of  14.05  km2 \ncomprising  the  BHTIP  (8.05  km2)  and  another  6  km2  of  new  industrial  land  to  be  developed \nunder the Project. The SBIZ is expected to be the home of the extended industrial production \nchains  in  the  fields  of  nonferrous  metal  materials,  fine  chemicals,  new  energy  materials,  and \nagroprocessing. \n \n11. \nIn  addition,  BMG  has  decided  to  make  further  investments  to  strengthen  and  upgrade \nthe basic urban infrastructure of the city, particularly to strengthen the road systems in the two \nurban districts and to expand the district heating service in Baiyin district. The investments in the \nroad systems will help the two urban districts to each complete a basic urban road framework to \nsupport  its  long  term  urban  development  needs  up  to  2030.  Heating  is  one  of  the  essential \nsocial services during winter in northern PRC. The investment for expanding the district heating \nservice  will  significantly  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  the  people  of  Baiyin  district  by  providing \nreliable  and  cleaner  heating  service  through  a  centralized  district  heating  system.  The \ncentralized  system  will  replace  the  unreliable,  low-efficiency,  and  polluting  small  community \ncoal-fire heating boilers, which are a major source of air pollution during winter. \n \nProject  Rationale.  Resource  dependent  mining  cities  established  under  the  planned \n12. \neconomy form a special vulnerable group of cities in the rapid urbanization process of the PRC. \nAn  established  national  priority  under  the  11th  FYP  is  to  provide  special  support  for  these \nmining cities to facilitate their economic transformation. Baiyin is one of the 18 cities classified \nby  the  Government  as  resource-exhausted.  In  the  PRC,  Baiyin  stands  for  a  new  model  of \neconomic  transformation  from  a  resource-exhausted  mining  city  into  a  new  industrial  center \nthrough  a  well  functioning  public  and  private  partnership  for  technology  upgrading  and \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nextension,  and  diversification  of  the  existing  production  chains.  The  Project  will  serve  a \ndemonstration  role  for  economic  transformation  of  the  other  resource-exhausted  mining  cities. \nMore detailed analyses of PRC urbanization and Baiyin\u2019s strategy for economic transformation \nare in Appendix 2. \n \n13. \nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Sector  Strategy  and  the  strategic  focus  of \nADB  operations  in  PRC  as  identified  and  discussed  with  the  Government  during  the  ongoing \ncountry partnership strategy consultation process. All the investment components of the Project \nare included in the Baiyin Urban Development Master Plan (2001-2020) endorsed by the Baiyin \nPeople\u2019s  Congress.  ADB  involvement  in  the  Project  will  provide  not  only  the  financial  support \nneeded  to  accelerate  economic  transformation,  but  also  international  knowledge  and  policy \nadvice  for  BMG  to  help  ensure  that  the  economic  transformation  will  be  accomplished  in  a \nsustainable and environmentally friendly manner.  \n \n14. \nPolicy Dialogue. The integrated nature of the Project enables ADB to further its ongoing \npolicy dialogue with the Government on urban development issues, particularly on the following \nproject-related  issues:  (i)  sustainable  urban  development  and  environmental  management,  (ii) \nintegrated urban transport planning and management, and (iii) heating service reforms.  \n \n15. \nGiven its decades-long copper mining background, Baiyin is known as one of the major \nindustrial  polluters  in  western  PRC.  With  financing  support  from  the  central  and  provincial \ngovernments,  BMG  has  undertaken  many  initiatives  to  address  the  environmental  concerns. \nDetails  of  the  domestically  funded  environmental  improvement  projects  in  Baiyin  are  in \nAppendix  3.  The  ongoing  economic  transformation  has  provided  the  city  with  a  unique \nopportunity to diversify its economy, away from highly polluting industries. It is important that the \neconomic  transformation  be  managed  and  accomplished  in  a  sustainable  and  environment- \nfriendly manner, to build a clean and environment-friendly new Baiyin. In this context, BMG has \nundertaken  the  initiative  to  conduct  a  regional  environmental  impact  assessment  (REIA)  for \nSBIZ covering both the existing BHTIP and the new industrial land to be developed under the \nProject  to  assess  the  potential  environmental  risks  and  introduce,  under  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), appropriate mitigation measures. One special focus of policy dialogue \nunder  the  Project  is  on  reviewing  the  adequacy  of  the  proposed  EMP  and  introducing  an \ntimely  and  effective \neffective  environmental  management  system \nimplementation of the EMP. \n \n16. \nThe  urban  transport  sector  in  the  PRC  is  generally  constrained  by  a  fragmented \ninstitutional system, under which urban planning, road construction and maintenance, transport \nservice,  vehicle  emission  control,  and  traffic  management  are  managed  by  different  agencies \nwith limited cooperation and interagency coordination. In some cities, these institutional barriers \nhave  significantly  constrained  the  emergence  of  integrated  urban  planning  and  transport \nmanagement.  BMG  has  made  good  progress  in  resolving  this  problem.  An  interagency \ncommittee  for  transport  and  road  safety  has  been  established  under  the  leadership  of  the \nmayor.  Policy  dialogue  on  the  urban  transport  issues  is  focused  mainly  on  improving  public \ntransport  service  and  road  safety  as  well  as  further  strengthening  enforcement  of  vehicle \nemission control.     \n \n17. \nADB has been active in promoting heating service reforms in the PRC. Its efforts include \nto  (i)  promote  centralized  district  heating  in  cities  to  improve  energy  efficiency  and  reduce  air \npollution,  (ii)  introduce  urban  heating  tariff  reforms,  (iii)  encourage  the  private  sector  to \nparticipate  in  service  provision,  and  (iv)  ensure  that  low-income  families  have  access  to  the \n\nto  ensure \n\n(EMS) \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fimproved  heating  service. 4  Under  the  Project,  63  low-efficiency  and  highly  polluting  small \ncommunity  boilers  will  be  replaced  by  a  centralized  district  heating  system  with  significant \nenergy  conservation  effect  and  environmental  benefits.  The  expanded  district  heating  service \nwill  be  provided  by  the  Minyue  District  Heating  Corporation  (MDHC),  a  state  share-controlled \ncompany  that  won  the  concession  for  providing  district  heating  service  for  west  Baiyin  district \nthrough open competition in 2005. Unlike the traditional government-run utilities in many other \ncities, which are suffering from obsolete equipment and redundant workers, MDHC is operated \nby a team of professional and skilled laborers at a low cost with very high operational efficiency. \nPolicy  dialogue  in  the  heating  sector  under  the  Project  is  focused  on  ensuring  access  of  low-\nincome families to the improved heating service.  \n \n18. \nExternal  Assistance.  The  Project  will  be  the  first  urban  development  project  to  be \nfunded  by  a  multilateral  development  bank  in  Gansu  province.  Following  the  smooth \nimplementation of the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Project, the Gansu \nprovincial government (GPG) requested, through the Government, another loan of $150 million \nfrom ADB for strengthening and upgrading the urban transport system in Lanzhou, the capital \ncity of Gansu province. The project preparatory TA and the proposed loan for this second urban \ndevelopment project in Gansu province are programmed for 2007 and 2009, respectively. ADB \nassistance for urban development in the PRC is in Appendix 4.   \n \nLessons  Learned.  ADB-financed  urban  development  and  urban  environmental \n19. \nmanagement  projects  in  the  PRC  generally  perform  well.  Urban  development  usually  requires \nan  integrated  and  multisector  approach.  One  major  lesson  learned  is  the  need  for  integrated \nand strategic urban planning, which is usually in the form of a well-prepared city development \nmaster  plan  to  guide  specific  development  activities.  The  Project  includes  several  sector \ncomponents  (basic  urban  infrastructure,  roads,  and  district  heating).  ADB  has  engaged  in \nextensive policy dialogue with the Government and BMG to confirm that these components are \nconsistent with the Baiyin Urban Development  Master Plan (2001\u20132020) and will contribute to \nthe outcome of the Project to facilitate economic transformation and improve the quality of life in \nBaiyin. Lessons identified from ADB\u2019s post-evaluation exercises (e.g., ADB\u2019s Special Evaluation \nStudy  on  Urban  Sector  Strategy  and  Operations)5 highlight  the  importance  of  integrating  both \nsupply  and  demand  concerns  into  the  project  design.  Other  lessons  include  the  need  to \nencourage  broad  reforms,  to  introduce  appropriate  pricing  policies  and  tariff  setting  and \nadjustment  mechanism  to  ensure  cost  recovery  and  counterpart  funding  for  operation  and \nmaintenance, to consult the public and involve the community in project design, to educate the \npublic on the need for environmental awareness, and to address the resettlement issue early. \nThese  lessons  have  been  considered  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  BMG,  and \nincorporated in the design of the proposed Project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n20. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  the  sustainable  and  environment-friendly  urban \ndevelopment  of  Baiyin.  The  project  impact  will  be  measured  by  the  achievement  of  sustained \neconomic growth, the employment opportunities created in the SBIZ, the improvement in urban \ntransport  service  and  road  safety,  the  improvement  in  district  heating  services,  and  the \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

The outcome of the \nProject  will  be  the  facilitated  urban  economic  transformation  and  improved  quality  of  life  in \nBaiyin.  The  outcome  will  be  measured  by  the  performance  of  the  SBIZ  in  attracting  new \ninvestments, the effectiveness of the newly introduced EMS for the SBIZ, the improved capacity \nin the urban transport system, the increased service coverage by the district heating services for \nurban dwellers including the low-income families, and the performance in demolishing the low-\nefficiency and polluting small community coal-fire heating boilers. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n21. \nThe Project will have five components: (i) Southern Baiyin infrastructure, (ii) Baiyin road \nimprovements, (iii) Pingchuan road improvements, (iv) district heating services, and (v) capacity \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening. The five components are summarized below. \n \n22. \nComponent 1: Southern Baiyin Infrastructure. Under this component, the Project will \ndevelop  6  km2 of  industrial  land  with  basic  public  infrastructure  including  about  24.9  km  long \nprimary  and  secondary  roads  and  related  water  supply  pipelines,  drainage  pipelines  and \nsewers,  heating  supply  pipelines,  optical-fabric  cable  and  electricity  distribution  lines,  lighting, \nand public green areas. \n \nComponent 2: Baiyin  Road Improvements. Under this component, the Project will (i) \n23. \nconstruct  nine  new  roads  with  a total  length  of  23.1  km;  and  (ii)  build connected water  supply \npipelines,  drainage  pipelines,  sewers,  heating  supply  pipelines,  lighting,  bus  rider/pedestrian \nand  bicycle  facilities.  This  component  will  also  (i)  build  14  bridges/culverts  and  (ii)  rehabilitate \nand widen three existing roads with a total length of 6.1 km. \n \n24. \nComponent  3:  Pingchuan  Road  Improvements.  Under  this  component,  the  Project \nwill  construct  (i)  seven  new  roads  with  a  total  length  of  12.6  km;  and  (ii)  the  related  drainage \npipelines,  sewers,  and  water  supply  pipelines.  This  component  will  also  (i)  build  three  bridges \nand (ii) rehabilitate and widen one road 3.5 km long. \n \n25. \nComponent  4:  District  Heating  Services.  Under  this  component,  the  Project  will \nexpand  the  heating  service  area  in  Baiyin  district  by  3.2  million  square  meters  (m2)  by  (i) \nbuilding a new heating source plant with 4x58 megawatts capacity, (ii) laying down 12.6 km of \nheat transmission pipelines, and (iii) installing 29 heat exchange stations for connection with the \ncommunity heat distribution systems. \n \n26. \nComponent  V:  Capacity  Development  and  Institutional  Strengthening.  Under  this \ncomponent,  the  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  and  financial  support  for  BMG  to:  (i) \ndesign  and  introduce  an  EMS  for  SBIZ,  (ii)  develop  a  geographic  information  system  (GIS)-\nbased urban planning and road and bridge management system for integrated urban transport \nplanning and management, (iii) provide consulting services during project implementation, and \n(iv) provide support and training for institutional strengthening of BMG, PMO, and IAs on urban \nplanning and management.   \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n27. \nEnvironmental  Management  System.  A  major  challenge  is  to  manage  the  induced \nenvironmental  impact  of  the  intensified  industrial  activities  related  to  the  development  of  the \nSBIZ. BMG\u2019s initiative to develop a REIA for the SBIZ is commendable. The Project will provide \ncapacity development support to help BMG establish the EMS for the SBIZ. The assistance will \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\finclude (i) designing the detailed institutional structure and operational mechanism for the EMS, \n(ii)  preparing  and  developing  the  environmental  management  regulatory  framework  for  the \nindustrial  zone,  (iii)  designing  and  establishing  a  centralized  environmental  management \ninformation  system  including  the  early  warning  system  for  emergency  response,  (iv)  providing \nbasic  environmental  monitoring  equipment,  and  (v)  providing  training  for  environmental \nmanagement.  \n \n28. \nIntegrated  Urban  Transport  Planning  and  Management.  Baiyin  is  at  a  relatively \nadvanced  stage  in  addressing  the  institutional  barriers  to  integrated  urban  transport  planning \nand management (para. 16). A sophisticated traffic control system has been established by the \ntraffic police. The city has been chosen by the Ministry of Construction as the pilot city in Gansu \nprovince to apply a computer-based urban management system to improve urban planning and \nmanagement.  A  basic  GIS-based  urban  management  system  with  limited  information  has \nalready been developed. Under the  Project, assistance will be provided to help BMG upgrade \nthis  initial  GIS-based  urban  management  system  to  make  it  an  integrated  urban  management \ninformation system, which will serve, among others, as a platform to integrate urban planning, \ntransport  planning,  and  asset  management.  Assistance  will  also  be  provided  to  help  establish \nthe link between the traffic control system, public transport operations, and the proposed urban \nmanagement information system. \n \nAccess  of  Low-Income  Families  to  District  Heating  Service.  Under  the  planned \n29. \neconomy, employers traditionally provided heating service to their employees on a cost-sharing \nbasis,  through  community  heating  systems.  With  expansion  of  the  district  heating  system,  the \nemployers  will  stop  running  the  small  community  heating  boilers.  But  this  may  leave  the  low-\nincome  families,  particularly  the  unemployed,  vulnerable  and  unprotected.  To  resolve  the \nproblem, BMG has agreed to introduce a special heating assistance program, which will ensure \nprovision of a basic volume of quality heat supply for low-income families as an essential social \nservice.  The  program  will  be  financed  by  (i)  an  appropriate  subsidy  from  BMG,  and  (ii)  the \nsubsidy  fund  as  a  portion  of  the  revenue  generated  by  MDHC.  Operational  details  of  the \nassistance program are under study. BMG has given its assurance that the assistance program \nfor  low-income  families  will  be  put  in  operation  before  the  full  operation  of  the  heating  system \nconstructed under the Project.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n30. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $161.53  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and \nduties  of  $4.7  million.  The  project  investment  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  1.  Detailed  cost \nestimates are in Appendix 5. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n \n\nSouthern Baiyin Infrastructure \nBaiyin Road Improvements \nPingchuan Road Improvements \nDistrict Heating Services \nCapacity Development and Institutional Strengthening \nSubtotal (A) \n\nAmounta\n \n48.07\n47.07\n22.82\n22.50\n1.89\n142.34\n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nItem \nB. \n\n \nContingenciesc \n\nAmountsa\n11.79\n\n \n\nFinancing Charges during Implementationd \nTotal (A+B+C) \n \nIncluding taxes and duties of $4.7 million. \nIn mid-2007 prices. \n\nC. \n  \na \nb \nc   Physical contingencies computed at 5% for civil works; and 5% for field research and development, \ntraining, surveys, and studies.

On 7 December 2007, the Board of Directors (R 210-07) approved a credit of 0.40% for the \nduration of the loan, to result in a contractual spread of 0.20% and a reduction of commitment charge \nto 0.15%.  The financing charges presented in the table  will be recalculated in accordance with the \nnew loan charges and the loan savings will be reallocated during Project implementation.  \n\n7.37\n161.53\n\nd  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n31. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  of  $80.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%6 \nper  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  about  49.5%  of  the  total  cost  of  the  Project.  Counterpart \n32. \nfunding will be provided by BMG, Pingchuan district government (PDG), MDHC, and domestic \ncommercial bank loans. The ADB loan will cover civil works, equipment and supplies, consulting \nservices and training, and financial charges on the loan during construction, while contingencies \nwill be financed by the Government. The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2 \nand details are in Appendix 5.   \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) \nDomestic Bank Loana \nBaiyin Municipal Governmenta \nPingchuan District Governmenta \nMinyue District Heating Corp.a \n \nTotal \na Commitments for counterpart funding have been provided. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nTotal \n80.00 \n12.08 \n55.48 \n 5.59 \n 8.38 \n\n   161.53 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n% \n49.5 \n  7.5 \n34.3 \n  3.5 \n  5.2 \n\n     100.0 \n\n \nThe  Government  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to  GPG,  which  will  relend  the  loan \n33. \nproceeds  to  BMG  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.

BMG will relend on the same terms and conditions the relevant amounts of the loan \nproceeds  to  PDG  and  MDHC  for  implementing  the  Pingchuan  road  improvements  component \nand district heating services component, respectively. BMG, PDG, and MDHC will assume, as \nthe  end-borrowers  for  their  relevant  portions  of  the  loan  proceeds,  the  foreign  exchange  and \ninterest  variation  risks  of  the  ADB  loan.  The  flow  of  funds  and  onlending  arrangements  are \ndescribed in Appendix 6.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n34. \nBMG will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A project leading group (PLG) headed \nby the mayor of BMG has been established and will be responsible for directing the project and \nproviding  policy  guidance  during  implementation.  The  PLG  will  comprise  representatives  from \nBaiyin  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Baiyin  Finance  Bureau,  Baiyin  Land \nManagement  Bureau  (BLMB),  Baiyin  Environmental  Protection  Bureau,  BCCB,  Baiyin  Foreign \nAffairs  Administrative  Bureau,  Baiyin  Urban  Comprehensive  Development  Bureau,  Baiyin \ndistrict government, and PDG. The PLG will meet at least once a month. A PMO has been set \nup  under  the  PLG.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  operations  and  for \ncoordinating the implementation of project activities on behalf of BMG. The PMO will (i) ensure \nadequate  interdepartmental  and  interagency  coordination,  (ii)  monitor  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation,  and  (iii)  coordinate  communication  with  ADB  and  the  other  agencies \nconcerned. The PMO will be headed by a director appointed by BMG. The PMO will comprise of \n10 staff, including at least two engineers/procurement specialists, two financial specialists, two \nsafeguard specialists, and one English translator. Four staff members will be appointed by BMG \nand  the  rest  will  be  hired  on  a  competitive  basis.  The  PMO  will  establish  a  Project-specific \nwebsite containing Project-specific information. \n \n35. \nThe  Project  will  have  four  implementing  agencies  (IAs):  (i)  the  BHTIP  Management \nCommission  for  the  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure  component,  (ii)  BCCB  for  the  Baiyin  road \nimprovements component, (iii) PDG for the Pingchuan road improvements component, and (iv) \nMDHC for the district heating services component. Among the four, BHTIP and BCCB are part \nof  BMG.  PDG  is  a  local  government  entity  under  the  jurisdiction  of  BMG.  MDHC  is  a  state \nshare-controlled company. A project implementation unit (PIU) will be established within each IA \nand will report to the respective IA in undertaking detailed implementation activities. Appendix 7 \ngives the details of the overall organization of project implementation at PMO and PIU levels. A \nfinancial management assessment was conducted for each IA. The conclusion is that all the IAs \nhave the capacity for project implementation and sustainable operation, but will need extensive \ntraining due to lack of ADB-related experience. Details of the financial management assessment \nare in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n36. \nThe Project will be implemented over a 4-year period from 2008 to 2011 (Appendix 8). \nThis  schedule  is  considered  realistic  and  achievable  because  the  project  implementation \nstructure is already in place and preparatory works are under way.  \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n37. \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated \nto  exceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10.0  million  will  be \nprocured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and for \nworks estimated to cost equal to or less than the above ICB values but more than $100,000 will \nbe  procured  on  the  basis  of  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  the \nPRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999),  subject  to  clarifications  agreed  upon  with  ADB. \nContracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using \nshopping procedures. More details are in Appendix 9. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n38. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB  has  approved  the  Government\u2019s  request  for \nadvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  to  cover  recruitment  of  consulting  services  and \nprocurement of goods and civil works. The issuance of invitations to bid or to pre-qualify under \nadvance contracting will be subject to ADB approval. All advance contracting will be undertaken \nin  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  or  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The amount to be retroactively financed will not exceed \n20% of the loan amount. The expenditures must have been incurred before loan effectiveness \nbut not earlier than 12 months before the loan agreement is signed. The Government and BMG \nhave  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the ensuing Project. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n39. \nThe  Project  will  fund  18  person-months  of  international  and  116  person-months  of \nnational  consulting  services  to  support  capacity  development  for  BMG  in  the  areas  of \nenvironmental  management,  integrated  urban  planning  and  management,  and  institutional \nstrengthening  for  project  implementation  and  management.  The  consulting  services  will  be \nrecruited through a consulting firm selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  in \naccordance  with  the  quality-  and-cost-based  selection  method  at  the  quality-to-cost  ratio  of \n80:20 using full technical proposal procedures. Consulting services are required for (i) designing \nand  introducing  a  well  functioning  EMS  for  the  SBIZ,  (ii)  developing  the  GIS-based  urban \nplanning  and  road  and  bridge  management  system,  and  (iii)  providing  project  implementation \nmanagement  support  for  the  PMO  and  IAs.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting \nservices is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n40. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  GPG,  BMG  and  the  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy has been included in \nthe loan covenants and will be included in the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, \nall contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying \nthe  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  GPG,  BMG,  IAs,  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. For \n\n \n\n\fthe  Project,  GPG  and  BMG  will  undertake  the  following  anticorruption  actions:  (i)  involve  full \ntime  officials  from  the  discipline  and  Inspection  bureau  in  monitoring  bidding  and  construction \nand operations of Project operations; (ii) introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works \ncontract  winner  also  signs  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the  employer;  and  (iii)  periodically \ninspect the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  ADB  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  set  out  in \n41. \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite \nproject implementation through timely release of loan proceeds, GPG will establish an imprest \naccount, promptly after loan effectiveness, at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The initial \namount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  expenditures  for \nthe next 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. To expedite funds flow and \nsimplify documentation process, the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used for \nliquidating  and  replenishing  the  imprest  account  and  reimbursing  eligible  expenses  not \nexceeding $100,000 per individual payment. The payments in excess of the SOE ceiling will be \nreimbursed, liquidated, or replenished based on a full supporting documentation process. Such \ndocumentation will demonstrate, among other things, that goods and/or services were produced \nin and procured from ADB members, and are eligible for ADB financing. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n42. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  regular  semiannual  progress  reports  indicating  progress  made, \nproblems encountered during the period under review, steps taken or proposed to remedy the \nproblems, the proposed program of activities, and progress expected in the next half year. The \nIAs will keep records to allow the identification of goods and services financed out of the loan \nproceeds, following accounting principles and practices prescribed by the Accounting Law of the \nPRC.  The  law  requires  enterprises  to  prepare  financial  statements  and  generally  follow \ninternationally accepted accounting standards. The IAs will maintain separate project accounts \nand records. The financial statements of the project accounts and the annual corporate financial \nstatements  for  IAs  will  be  subject  to  external  audit  by  the  BMG  Audit  Bureau,  the  Gansu \nProvincial  Audit  Bureau,  and  the  State  Audit  Administration.  The  audits  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  regulations  for  auditing  approved  by  the  State  Council  and  will  meet  ADB \nrequirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of \nexpenditure  will  be  part  of  the  audit  reports.  The  IAs\u2019  annual  audited  financial  statements  and \naudited project accounts will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the \nfiscal year for the entire implementation period. The Government, GPG, and BMG were advised \nof  ADB\u2019s  requirement  of  timely  submission  of  audited  projects  accounts  and  financial \nstatements,  and  the  suspension  of  disbursements  of  the  proposed  ADB  loan  in  case  of  non-\ncompliance with the requirement. BMG and the IAs will submit reports and information to ADB \nconcerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  and  IA  performance.  These \nreports  will  include  (i)  semiannual  progress  reports  on  project  implementation;  (ii)  annual \nreports; and (iii) a project completion report, not later than 3 months after the completion of the \nproject. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe project performance monitoring system (PPMS) indicators will include (i) occupation \n43. \nrate  of  the  SBIZ,  (ii)  additional  employment  opportunities  created  by  the  SBIZ,  (iii)  adequacy \nlevel  of  the  EMS  for  the  SBIZ,  (iv)  service  level  of  the  improved  road  systems  in  Baiyin  and \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fPingchuan districts, (v) enforcement of vehicle emission control, (vi) reduction in fatalities from \nroad accidents, (vii) service level of district heating service, and (viii) improvement in air quality. \n \n44. \nNo  later  than  6  months  after  project  inception,  the  PMO  and  the  IAs,  with  assistance \nfrom  the  consultants,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  generate  data \nsystematically on the inputs and outputs of each component, as well as the agreed-upon socio-\neconomic,  environmental,  and  health  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure  project  impacts.  The \nPMO will (i) refine the PPMS framework, (ii) confirm achievable targets, (iii) finalize monitoring \nand  recording  arrangements,  and  (iv)  establish  systems  and  procedures.  Under  the  PPMS \nframework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite time intervals by the IAs, \nincluding  semiannual  reporting  of  the  EMP.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and \nconsolidating  the  data.  The  PPMS  will  be  designed  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt \nremedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedule,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  The \nPMO,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  will  monitor  and  assess  activities,  and  submit \nannual reports to ADB on the physical implementation and financial aspects to ensure that the \nproject impact is monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n45. \nADB and the Government will review project implementation jointly at least once a year. \nIn addition, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years \nafter the start of project implementation. This midterm review will include a detailed evaluation of \nthe  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  and  achievement  of  scheduled  targets;  progress  on \nthe  agenda \ninstitutional, \nresettlement, social, environmental aspects; and all other aspects that may have an impact on \nproject implementation progress and sustainability. From the findings of the midterm review, a \nknowledge product on economic transformation would be developed for dissemination. \n \n\nfor  policy  reform;  capacity  development  measures; \n\nfinancial, \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\nA. \n \nThe Project will directly benefit more than 475,000 urban residents in the project areas \n46. \nthrough construction of urban infrastructure for economic transformation, improved urban roads, \nand expanded and enhanced district heating supply. With support from the Project, despite the \ndeclining share of mining-related production, Baiyin is envisaged to maintain its GDP growth at \na double-digit annual rate from 2005 to 2015. When completed, the SBIZ is expected to provide \nmore than 5,000 permanent jobs for the skilled workers whose jobs are affected by the decline \nin  the  mining  resources.  With  support  from  the  Project,  development  of  the  SBIZ  will  be \nmanaged  and  accomplished  by  an  effective  EMS  designed \nthe \ninternationally  accepted  environmental  management  standards  issued  by  the  International \nStandards Organization (ISO 14000 standards).  \n \n47. \nThe  road  improvements  component  will  improve  significantly  the  urban  transport \nsituation in both Baiyin and Pingchuan districts and provide the two urban centers of Baiyin with \nthe  basic  road  framework  with  the  capacity  to  meet  their  long-term  development  needs  up  to \n2030.  The  road  improvements  component  will  expand  the  public  transport  service  coverage \nthrough  increased  bus  lines,  divert  downtown  traffic  to  the  outer  ring  road,  and  reduce  road \naccident  fatalities  from  the  2005  baseline  by  about  10%  by  2011.  Through  the  district  heating \nservices component, the Project will replace 63 inefficient and highly polluting small community \nheating boilers with an efficient and environment-friendly centralized district heating system. By \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fthe year 2015, the heating service area will expand by 2.6 million m2 and benefit about 20,000 \nhouseholds,  about  10%  of  whom  are  low-income  families.  The  district  heating  services \ncomponent  will  also  help  reduce  emission  of  sulfur  dioxide  by  185  tons  per  year,  reduce \nconsumption of coal by 5,700 tons per year, and improve public health and indoor air quality by \neliminating numerous indoor coal-burning stoves and facilitating the switch to district heating.   \n \nB. \n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n \n48. \nOverall, the land acquisition and resettlement impacts of the Project will be significant. In \ntotal,  about  730.4  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be  permanently  acquired  by  the  Project,  of  which \n153.6  ha  or  21%  is  classified  as  farmland.  Permanent  land  acquisition  will  affect  1,619 \nhouseholds or 6,272 people. The Project will also require the temporary acquisition of 13.5 ha of \nland,  all  of  which  is  unoccupied  state-owned  land  along  roads  to  be  improved.  A  total  of  328 \nhouseholds  or  1,450  people  will  be  relocated,  about  61,012  m2  of  residential  houses  will  be \ndemolished, 42 enterprises with a total of 1,378 employees will be affected, and 28,814 m2 of \nnonresidential  structures  will  be  dismantled.  In  addition,  some  productive  assets,  ground \nattachments,  and  public  infrastructure  facilities  will  also  be  affected.  No  ethnic  minority \nhousehold will suffer any land acquisition or resettlement impacts.  \n \n49. \nFor  permanent  land  acquisition,  compensation  will  be  paid  in  cash  to  the  village \ncollective  and  the  affected  persons  (APs).  The  resettlement  subsidy,  and  compensation  for \nstanding  crops,  trees,  ground  attachments,  and  income  losses  suffered  by  enterprises  will  be \npaid  directly  to  the  APs.  For  residential  houses  and  nonresidential  houses  to  be  demolished, \ncompensation  at  replacement  value  will  be  paid  to  owners.  Households  who  need  to  relocate \nwill  also  receive  a  relocation  allowance.  The  measures  for  economic  rehabilitation  include \nproviding  jobs  during  the  project  construction  and  operational  phases;  redistributing  farmland \namong  affected  groups  wherever  possible;  upgrading    existing  low-yield  farmland  to  intensify \nagricultural production; developing off-farm opportunities; and providing technical training to the \nAPs to increase their skills. For the vulnerable people, the respective IAs will pay an additional \none-time grant to improve their living standards. The PMO and IA will supervise implementation \nto  ensure  the  vulnerable  persons  receive  adequate  compensation,  are  helped  in  making \nhousing arrangement; and are assisted to restore their living conditions and incomes. Individual \nresettlement plans (RPs) have been prepared for each investment component under the Project \nin  accordance  with  PRC  Land  Administration  Law  (1998),  State  Council  Decision  on  Deepen \nReform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land  Administration  (2004)  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) and associated operational procedures. RPs have been distributed to the affected \ndistricts, counties, villages, and APs. The resettlement information booklets were disseminated \nto  the  APs  on  20  June  2007.  The  estimated  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  $15 \nmillion, equivalent to CNY116.99 million in 2007 prices, including contingencies. The summary \nRP is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n\nThe  Project  supports \n\n \n50. \nfor  promoting  economic \ndevelopment in western PRC. Of the total 475,000 direct beneficiary population, 45,126 persons \nor 15.35% of the total urban population live under the Minimum Living Guarantee (MLG)7 in the \nproject  areas  (33,096  persons  in  Baiyin  district  and  12,030  in  Pingchuan).  Improved  road \n\nthe  achievement  of \n\nthe  NSDW \n\n                                                 \n7  The municipal poverty line is CNY156 per capita per month. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fFinancial Analysis, Sustainability, and Affordability Aspects \n\nnetworks will increase mobility, reduce traffic congestion, reduce road accidents, and enhance \nroad  safety.  The  beneficiary  population,  especially  the  poor,  will  benefit  from  improved \ntransportation  facilities  and  increased  access  to  employment,  schools,  as  well  as  other  social \nservices.  The  development  of  the  SBIZ  will  also  attract  increased  foreign  and  domestic \ninvestments  and  lead  to  increased  employment  opportunities.  The  poor  will  also  benefit  from \ntemporary jobs during the construction phase as well as permanent jobs during the operational \nphase.  Improvement  of  the  central  heating  supply  will  reduce  the  incidence  of  environmental \nhealth  impacts,  especially  for  poor  households  as  they  will  be  able  to  access  the  heating \nfacilities through the BMG assistance program.   \n \n51. \nThe Project will create 3,640 person-years of direct and indirect short-term employment \nopportunities, with earnings totaling CNY49.09 million during the construction phase. The poor, \nwomen, and ethnic minorities will be given priority in the short-term employment opportunities. \nThose temporarily employed in construction will benefit from the training and experience gained \nunder  the  Project,  which  is  expected  to  enhance  their  opportunities  for  employment  in  other \ninfrastructure  projects.  Another  1,350  person-years  of  long-term  employment  opportunities  will \nbe  created,  with  wages  totaling  CNY18.14  million  per  annum  during  the  operation  phase. \nPriority  in  these  mid-  to  long-term  employment  opportunities  will  also  be  given  to  the  poor, \nwomen,  ethnic  minorities,  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  To  maximize  the  project  benefits, \nwomen will be given priority in employment and training during the construction and operation \nphases. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12.  \n  \nC. \n \nThe Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. A financial impact analysis \n52. \nwas  undertaken  for  the  two  revenue-generating  components  (district  heating  services  and \nSouthern  Baiyin  infrastructure).  These  are  further  discussed  in  Appendix  13.    The  detailed \nfinancial impact analysis is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n53.  MDHC  is  a  new  company  that  obtained  from  BMG  a  concession  contract  to  provide \ndistrict heating service for west Baiyin through open competition in August 2005. With initial the \ninvestment, MDHC has already built a heat source plant and associated transmission lines, and \nstarted  providing  heating  service  at  an  expansion  rate  of  200,000  m2  per  year  in  accordance \nwith  its  heating  service  expansion  program.  Over  the  2  years  of  operation  since  November \n2005,  MDHC  has  generated  a  net  income  of  CNY4.26  million.  With  support  from  the  Project, \nMDHC  will  be  able  to  accelerate  the  service  expansion  to  achieve  full  coverage  of  the \nconcession  area.  Detailed  financial  analysis  and  assessment  reveal  that  MDHC  has  sufficient \nequity fund to maintain the debt-to-equity ratio at a level not higher than 70:30 throughout the \noperation period of the Project. At the current tariff level (constant price), MDHC can maintain its \nfinancial  sustainability.  Investment  for  service  expansion,  heating  operation  and  system \nmaintenance,  and  debt  service  can  be  financed  by  the  increased  revenue  generated  from  the \nexpansion  of  the  customer  base.  Over  the  project  period  of  25  years,  MDHC  will  generate  a \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  6.4%,  compared  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital (WACC) at 3.02%.  \n \nThe  current  tariff  for  residential  consumers  in  Baiyin  is  CNY13  per  m2,  which  is \n54. \nconsidered  adequate.  It  reflects  the  local  costs  of  heating  service  and  is  generally  found \naffordable to the residents. A social survey reveals that 39% of the surveyed households would \naccept  a  minor  increase  in  heating  tariff  for  improved  heating  service,  and  61%  would  not \naccept an abrupt tariff increase due to their limited resources. Of the 61%, 47.5% indicated their \nwillingness to accept a gradual tariff increase if it is introduced over a 5-year period. The survey \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fresults have been discussed with BMG and MDHC. MDHC is comfortable with the current tariff \nand  does  not  have  any  plan  to  request  an  increase.  In  the  case  of  significant  increase  in  the \ncosts of MDHC operation inputs which may affect its financial sustainability, MDHC may request \nBMG for a tariff review. BMG will, if the request is considered reasonable, use its best efforts to \nprovide  support  to  MDHC  to  maintain  its  financial  sustainability.  In  case  tariff  adjustment  is \nconsidered  the  best  option,  BMG  will  organize  public  consultation  with  key  stakeholders \nincluding the representative of the low income families or other mechanisms as provided for in \nthe laws and regulations on utility tariff setting before adjusting tariff. The affordability concern is \ncurrently  concentrated  on  the  low-income  families  below  the  MLG.  Results  of  social  survey \nindicate  that  heating  expenditures at  the  current  tariff  level  will  account  for  about  15%  of  their \nincome. To ensure that low-income families have access to the improved heating service, BMG \nhas  agreed  to  introduce  a  special  heating  assistance  program  for  them.  The  program  will \nprovide  a  basic  volume  of  quality  heating  supply  for  the  low-income  families  as  an  essential \nsocial  service,  which  will  be  financed  by  (i)  an  appropriate  subsidy  from  BMG,  and  (ii)  the \nsubsidy fund as a portion of the revenue generated by MDHC (para. 29). \n \nAlthough the BHTIP is not a self-financing entity, financial analysis has been undertaken \n55. \nfor  the  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure  component  because  this  component  will  generate \nrevenues from the lease of developed industrial land. BMG will decide on a lot price at different \nlevels, ranging from the minimum price for industrial land set by the Government to a level that \nachieves full cost recovery. Using the current promotion price, the financial analysis concludes \nthat the Southern Baiyin infrastructure component will have an FIRR of 8.7%, compared with a \nWACC of 3.13%. \n \nResults  of  the  assessment  of  financial  management  indicate  that  the  Project  will  not \n56. \naffect  the  financial  sustainability  of  BMG  and  the  IAs.  BHTIP,  BCCB,  and  MDHC  have  an \nadequate \nfinancial  management \nprofessionals  to  manage  the  Project.  The  PIU at  PDG  is  relatively  weak.  None  of  the  IAs  has \nexperience  in  working  with  international  financial  institutions.  Special  training  programs  have \nbeen arranged for the IAs with support from the project preparatory TA to help them understand \nADB policy  and project management requirements. Further training is included in the capacity \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening component of the Project.  \n \nD. \n \n57. \nEconomic  analysis  provides  the  rationale  and  justification  for  the  Project  based  on \npolicy, sector, and in-depth analysis of BMG\u2019s strategy for economic transformation. It considers \nthe Project, not as a stand-alone investment, but as an integral part of the strategy to transform \nBaiyin  from  a  traditional  mining  city  to  a  sustainable  and  environment-friendly  urban  center.  A \nleast-cost analysis was conducted for each of the four investment components, followed by an \neconomic evaluation of each component and of the Project as a whole. For the Southern Baiyin \ninfrastructure component, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated based on \nthe  quantification  of  the  incremental  land  value  and  incremental  labor  income.  The  EIRR  is \n12.98%,  which  is  higher  than  the  economic  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  For  the  two  road \nimprovement  components,  the  EIRR  is  14.23%  based  on  the  quantification  of  savings  on \nvehicle operation cost, savings in travel time, and reduction of road accidents. The EIRR for the \ndistrict  heating  services  component  was  calculated  based  on  both  energy  efficiency  benefits \nand environmental benefits under two scenarios: taking into account or not taking into account \nthe reduction in environmental costs. The economic evaluation concludes that the EIRR for this \ncomponent will be 19.70% without taking into account the reduction in environmental costs, and \n23.78%  after  taking  into  account  the  reduction  in  environmental  costs.  All  the  investment \n\nfinancial  management  system  and  enough \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\ninternal \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fEnvironmental Aspects \n\ncomponents  have  an  EIRR  higher  than  12%,  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital.  The \nProject\u2019s  overall  EIRR  is  14.26%  shows  that  the  Project  is  economically  viable.  The  summary \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 14. Detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix \nC. \n \nE. \n \n58. \nAn  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was  prepared  for  the  Southern  Baiyin \ninfrastructure and the district heating services components, respectively. A combined EIA was \nprepared  for  the  two  urban  road  improvements  components.  All  EIAs  were  prepared  in \naccordance with relevant laws and regulations of the PRC. All the investment components were \nexamined  against  the  procedures  and  criteria  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy, \nfor  Selected \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  and  Environmental  Guidelines \nInfrastructure Projects. In addition, a REIA was prepared for the SBIZ covering both the BHTIP \nand  the  6  km2  industrial  land  to  be  developed  under  the  Project.  The  REIA  was  prepared  to \nassess  and  manage  the  induced  environmental  impacts  that  may  arise  from  the  intensified \nindustrial  activities  as  a  result  of  the  economic  transformation.  Extensive  public  consultations \ninvolving a survey,  meetings with stakeholders, and focus group discussions were undertaken \ntwice during the preparation of the EIAs and the REIA.  The EIAs and the REIA were endorsed \nby the Baiyin Environmental Protection Bureau (BEPB) and approved by the Gansu Provincial \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau. A copy of the REIA is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n59. \nA  summary  EIA  (SEIA)  was  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  and  posted  on  the \nADB website on 29 June 2007. The SEIA confirms that all the investment components will have \npositive environmental impacts and will contribute to the strengthening of the project impact for \na  sustainable  and  environment-friendly  urban  development  in  Baiyin.  The  district  heating \nservices  component  will  significantly  improve  air  quality  and  energy  efficiency  in  Baiyin  by \nexpanding  the  service  coverage  of  centralized  district  heating  to  replace  the  inefficient  and \nhighly  polluting  small  community  heating  boilers.  Coal  burned  for  heating  will  be  reduced  by \n5,700  tons  each  year,  thus  reducing  significantly  the  emission  of  coal-based  pollutants,  the \noccurrence of respiratory disease during winter, and the traffic hazards caused by the transport \nof coal in urban areas. \n \n60. \nThe two road improvement components will provide an efficient and safe urban transport \nframework  for  each  of  the  two  urban  centers  of  the  city  to  meet  their  long-term  development \nneeds.  These  components  will  bring  environmental  benefits  by  improving  motor  vehicle \noperating  efficiency,  rationalizing  the  traffic  flow  passing  through  the  city  for  better  interaction \nbetween the urban transport system and the surrounding national and provincial road networks, \nreducing  motor  vehicle  emissions,  and  reducing  the  number  of  road  accident  fatalities.  The \nSouthern  Baiyin  infrastructure  component  will  provide  a  platform  for  Baiyin  to  accelerate \neconomic  diversification  and  transformation  to  achieve  the  goal  to  build  a  sustainable  and \nenvironment-friendly  new  Baiyin.  The  SEIA  confirms  that  sufficient  and  appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures  to  manage  and  alleviate  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  have  been  introduced \nthrough the preparation of the REIA and EIAs. The mitigation measures are summarized in the \nEMP  attached  to  the  SEIA.  The  SEIA  and  the  EMP  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E  and  F, \nrespectively. \n \nF. \n \n61. \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Conventional  engineering \ndesigns and technology with proven records of reliable performance are adopted for all the four \n\nProject Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\finvestment  components.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  support  the  PMO  and  IAs  to \nensure  timely  implementation  of  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  design  requirements  and \nquality  standards.  The  SEIA  has  concluded  that  the  Project  has  met  the  environmental \nsafeguard requirements of ADB and the Government of the PRC. \n \n62. \nThe  Project  will  not  be  a  success  if  the  SBIZ,  after  land  development,  fails  to  attract \ninvestors  to  support  the  economic  diversification  and  transformation  because  of  a  mismatch \nbetween  the  transformation  strategy  and  Baiyin\u2019s  competitive  advantages.  Under  the  project \npreparatory  TA,  a  strategic  review  was  undertaken  together  with  economic  analysis  to  assess \nBMG\u2019s strategy for urban economic transformation. The review confirmed the SBIZ\u2019s advantage \nand potential to develop extended production chains for chemical research and production, and \nnonferrous processing. The involvement of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in developing and \noperating  the  BHTIP  has  also  provided  the  SBIZ  with  advanced  knowledge  inputs  and \ntechnology  advantages  to  attract  high  quality  investors  for  technology  upgrading.  These \nadvantages  have  also  been  confirmed  by  the  success  of  the  BHTIP  and  the  pipeline  of  new \ninvestors waiting for industrial land (para. 10). \n \n63. \nThe project risk may arise from the induced environmental impact due to the intensified \nindustrial  activities  in  the  SBIZ.  To  mitigate  this  risk  in  a  systematic  manner,  BMG  has \nundertaken a REIA to assess the environmental impact from the industrial activities in both the \nexisting BHTIP and the SBIZ to be developed under the Project. An EMP has been developed \nunder the REIA and EIAs to mitigate the identified environmental risks. In addition to the EMP, \nBMG has decided to establish an environmental management committee (EMC) for the SBIZ to \nbe  chaired  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Economic  and  Finance  Committee  of  the  Baiyin  People\u2019s \nCongress.  The  EMC  will  comprise  deputies  of  the  Baiyin  People\u2019s  Congress,  independent \nscholars  and  environmental  specialists,  representatives  of  tenant  enterprises,  the  head  of \nBEPB, and head of Baiyin Quality Control and Production Safety Office. The EMC will provide \npolicy guidance on environmental management for economic transformation at the SBIZ. Under \nthe supervision of the EMC, BEPB will set a satellite office at the BHTIP to take care of day-to-\nday environmental monitoring and enforcement. At the same time, each tenant enterprise at the \nSBIZ  will  be  requested  to  set  up  an  internal  environmental  management  office  or  unit \nresponsible \nthe  environmental  management \nrequirements. Furthermore, consulting services will be provided under the Project to help BMG \ndesign the regulatory framework (including entrance criteria, detailed operational mechanism of \nthe  proposed  three-tier  EMS),  and  provide  related  training  to  ensure  that  the  economic \ntransformation  is  conducted  and  accomplished  in  a  sustainable  and  environment-friendly \nmanner. \n \n\nthe  enterprise\u2019s  compliance  with  all \n\nfor \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES8 AND CONDITION \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n64. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the Loan and Project Agreements:  \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  BMG  have  given  the \n\n(i) \n\nEnvironmental  management  system.

GPG through BMG will ensure that all land and rights-\nof-way needed under the Project are made available in a timely manner prior to \ncommencement of civil works and in accordance with the RPs.  \n\nClosure of small coal-fire heating boilers. GPG through BMG will ensure that \nall the 63 small community coal-fire heating boilers identified for demolition under \nthe  Project  are  closed  in  accordance  with  the  boiler  demolition  plan  to  be \nprepared  in  consultation  with  ADB  when  the  engineering  design  for  the  District \nHeating Services component becomes available. \n\nHeating  assistance  to  the  poor. GPG through BMG will ensure that a special \nheating assistance program for the low-income families is developed in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB for implementation before the full operation of the \nheating system constructed under the Project. The program will ensure provision \nof  a  basic  volume  of  quality  heating  supply  for  the  low-income  families  as  an \nessential social service, which is to be jointly financed by (a) appropriate subsidy \nfrom BMG, and (b) subsidy fund as a portion of the cash revenue generated by \nthe MDHC. \n\nAnticorruption. GPG and BMG will ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Projects include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  BMG  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other services providers as they relate to the Project. During the \nProject  implementation,  GPG  and  BMG  will,  and  will  cause  each  PIA  to  ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date).  GPG \nand  BMG  will,  and  will  cause  each  PIA  to  ensure  that  (i)  officials  from  the \nDiscipline and Inspection Bureau of GPG and BMG monitor bidding of contracts \nand  construction  and  operations  of  Project  facilities;  (ii)  an  internal  audit  unit  is \nestablished  in  BMG;  (iii)  a  dual-signing  system  is  adopted  where  the  winner  of \nthe  civil  works  contract

\n\nSTRATEGY FOR ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION \n\nBaiyin Strategy for Sustainable Development through Economic Transformation \n\nBaiyin  used  to  be  the  major  nonferrous  metal  base  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n1. \n(PRC),  especially  for  copper  mining.  In  1984  and  1988,  as  two  of  the  major  copper  mines \nbecame exhausted and closed, the copper mine supply has dropped to 15% of the smelting and \nprocessing capacity. Mining of the associated mineral resources, such as lead and zinc, is also \non a declining trend. Baiyin Nonferrous Metal Corporation (BNMC), which employs about half of \nthe  entire  work  force  in  Baiyin  City,  is  in  serious  financial  condition  with  over  CNY4.7  billion \ncumulative  deficits.  Seven  of  its  associated  companies  have  filed  for  bankruptcy.  As  for  the \nentire city, the total industrial assets are estimated at about CNY24.0 billion, whereas the total \ndebt is at about CNY19.6 billion. The city has been identified as one of the 18 most resource-\nexhausted cities in the PRC, and is facing serious challenges to maintain sustainable economic \ndevelopment for the region. \n \nFacing the challenges, the Baiyin Municipal Government (BMG) has been exploring the \n2. \nstrategy of maintaining a sustainable economic development through economic transformation \nand  diversification.  Considering  the  special  condition  of  rich  industrial  resources  in  Baiyin,  the \nBMG  has  developed  the  strategy  of  economic  transformation  with  the  emphasis  on  industrial \ndevelopment.  BMG  has  identified  four  leading  industries  (nonferrous  metal,  power,  chemical \nindustry,  and  coal  mining)  and  eight  supporting  industries  (nonferrous  metal  materials,  fine \nchemical \nrecycling,  new  energy  materials,  machinery  and \nmanufacturing,  nonmetal  material,  agricultural  product  processing,  and  tourism)  as  the \ndirections of continuous economic growth. Details of the four leading industries are summarized \nbelow. \n \n\nindustry,  mining  material \n\nNonferrous  metal \nthe  equipment  and \ntechnology of the traditional nonferrous metal productions, develop new alloy and \nfunctional materials. \n\nindustry.  Upgrade  and \n\nimprove \n\nPower  industry. Develop hydropower, coal-based fusel power, as well as wind \npower in the region so as to develop the Baiyin area as one of the energy bases \nin the Northwest Region.    \n\nCoal  mine  industry. Improve the existing coal mine industry with better mining \nstrategy  to  protect  the  mining  resource  and  improve  the  mining  efficiency.  \nDevelop  and  promote  the  utilization  of  coalbed  methane  (CBM)  and  coalmine \nmethane (CMM).   \n\nChemical  industry.  Based  on  the  TDI  (toluene  diisovyanateI),  extend  the \nproduction  chains  to  form  production  of  MDI  (diphenylmethane  diisocyanate), \nPVC (polyvinyl chloride), chlor-alkali complexes, etc..   \n\nThe plan for developing the eight supporting industries includes the following. \n\nNonferrous metals and rare earth. Extend the production chains of the existing \nnonferrous metal including copper, aluminum, lead, as well as rare earth group to \ndevelop new nonferrous metal and rare earth products. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n3. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2       25   \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(viii) \n\n \n\nMine  resource  reuse.  Explore  the  existing  mine  resources  to  be  fully  utilized, \npromote  technology  improvement  and  equipment  upgrade,  and  develop  CBM \nand CMM. \n\nFine chemical industry. Develop fine chemical production clusters based on the \nexisting TDI production. \n\nEnergy  and  new  energy  materials.  Further  develop  hydropower,  fusel  power \nand wind power to form an energy base in the Northwest. Develop lithium based \nbattery production. \n\nAgricultural  product  processing.  Develop  agricultural  product  productions  in \nfood, vegetable and fruit, and special local products. \n\nNonmetal materials. Based on nonmetal mining materials, such as limestone to \ndevelop nonmetal materials. \n\nMachinery  and  manufacturing. \nproductions to Baiyin area. \n\nIntroduce  machinery  and  manufacturing \n\nYellow  River  tourism.  Promote  tourism  along  Yellow  River  and  develop  tour \nroutes based on Yellow River cultural heritages.         \n\nB. \n\nEffort and Achievements in Economic Transformation \n\n4. \nSince 2002, BMG has started implementing the economic transformation strategy in the \narea.  As  part  of  the  effort  to  improve  the  investment  environment  and  attract  more  outside \ninvestments,  BMG  has  developed  three  economic  development  zones:  Baiyin  High-tech \nIndustrial  Park  (BHTIP),  West  Baiyin  Economic  Development  Area,  and  Pingchuan  Economic \nDevelopment  Area.  Since  the  implementation  of  the  economic  transformation  strategy,  the \neconomy of Baiyin City has grown steadily at a double-digit rate. \n \n\n1. \n\nBaiyin High-tech Industrial Park (BHTIP) \n\n5. \nThe  BHTIP  is  located  in  the  south  of  Baiyin  district.  The  total  approved  industrial  park \narea  is  about  8.05  square  kilometers  (km2).  The  development  of  the  area  has  been  staged  in \ntwo phases. Phase 1 has been completed, and phase 2 is currently under construction. Since \nthe  completion  of  phase  1,  the  BHTIP  was  developed  as  the  site  of  plants  for  fine  chemical \nindustry, new materials, and pharmaceuticals, and has become the new home of about 43 new \ninvestments,  including  nonferrous  metal  material,  new  battery  material,  chemical  and  fine \nchemical  industry,  pharmaceuticals,  and  medical  equipment.  The  total  investment  for  the  new \nproduction and industries is about CNY3.4 billion, and total production is about CNY300 million. \nNew jobs number 1,850. With the  proposed Project, the BHTIP will be expanded  and merged \ninto the Southern Baiyin industrial zone (SBIZ) that has an approved land area of 14.05 km2. It \nis anticipated that when  the entire SBIZ is completed, the total annual production value will be \nabout CNY4.0 billion and the estimated tax revenue for the city will be CNY600 million. \n \n\n2. \n\nWest Baiyin Economic Development Area \n\n6. \nThe West Baiyin Economy Development Area is located in the west of Baiyin district with \na  total  area  of  about  20  km2.  All  major  infrastructure  construction  has  been  completed  since \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nimplementation  began  in  2002.  Currently  there  are  about  70  new  enterprises  with  a  total  of \nCNY5.2  billion  in  investments  in  the  area.  In  the  past  5  years,  the  total  production  value  has \nreached about CNY9 billion, and the tax revenue for the city has totaled about CNY400 million. \nSome roads under the proposed Baiyin road improvements component are located in the area \nand will add new infrastructure that will facilitate economic development. \n \n\n3. \n\nPingchuan Economic Development Area \n\nThe Pingchuan Economic Development Area is located in the west of Pingchuan district. \n7. \nIt has been designated as the new industrial area for construction materials, agricultural product \nprocessing,  and  coal-chemical  production.  The  total  investment  was  CNY410  million  and \nconstruction  started  in  1998.  Currently  there  are  about  22  large  enterprises  and  120  small \nbusinesses employing about 19,000 people. The estimated tax revenue is about CNY30 million. \nSome roads under the Pingchuan road improvements component are located in the area. They \nwill add new infrastructure and provide support for the city\u2019s economic transformation. \n \nC. \n\nResource and Challenges in Economic Transformation \n\n8. \nBMG has made significant progress in the economic transformation in the last 5 years. \nHowever, more efforts and investments will be required for sustainable economic development \nin  the  region.  As  an  old  industrial  city,  Baiyin  has  its  own  special  resources  that  will  be  fully \nutilized in the economic transformation. These resources include the following:  \n \n\nIndustrial  resources. Baiyin used to be the national industrial base for mining, \nwith  numerous  mining  and  processing  facilities.  Even  though  some  of  the \nequipment and technologies are out-of-date, the infrastructure and facilities could \nbe modified and renovated for new productions. \n\nLand,  power,  and  water  resources. Baiyin is rich in land and power supply. It \nalso  has  adequate  water  resources.  All  these  are  essential  for  industrial \nproduction and new economic development. \n\nSkilled labor and human resources. Baiyin has a large pool of skilled labor and \nengineering  and  technical  personnel.  The  city  is  also  the  home  of  several \neducational and research institutes. BMG has initiated training programs that will \nteach the labor force new skills and technologies so that they can find positions \nin new productions and industries. \n\nLocation  and  transportation.  Baiyin  is  located  about  70  kilometers  (km) \nnortheast  of  Lanzhou,  the  capital  city  of  Gansu  province,  and  is  one  national \nchemical production center. The two cities are connected by several national and \nprovincial highways, and share one airport. An effective transportation system is \nfundamental condition in reaching out for economic development.  \n\nAgricultural  resource.  Baiyin  has  abundant  land  resources  and  is  suitable  for \ndryland farming and horticulture. In addition to conventional farm production, new \ntechnologies and a diversified agroprocessing business are being developed and \nintroduced in line with the ongoing economic transformation. \n\nGovernment  policy  support.  The central  Government  has  classified Baiyin  as \none  of  the  18  most  resource-exhausted  cities.  The  city  also  benefits  from  the \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2       27   \n\n \n\nnational policy of developing the vast northwest area. The favorable policies will \nhelp the city\u2019s plan of economic transformation. \n\n               \n9. \nBMG  has  made  achievements  in  the  last  5  years,  but  the  city  is  facing  serious \nchallenges to continue its economic transformation and to maintain its economic development. \nThere are four challenges. \n \n\n1. \n\nExhausting Mining Resources Hindering Sustained Economic Growth \n\n \n10.  Many state-owned large enterprises in mining and traditional industries are deep in debt. \nBNMC, for example, had CNY4.7 billion in debt in 2005 and the liability-to-asset ratio reached \n160%. Most equipment and technologies are out-of-date, have low efficiency, use much energy, \nand  cause  heavy  pollution.  The  unemployment  rate  has  remained  high  for  years.  Many \ncompanies also carry heavy burdens for pensions, social welfare, unemployment benefits, etc. \nThe city has made efforts to reorganize the companies of the traditional industries, develop new \nmining-related  productions,  and  shut  down  factories  that  are  no  longer  sustainable.  New \nstrategy and policies will be developed to promote the market-oriented new production and the \ndevelopment  of  private-owned  enterprises  for  the  traditional  industries.  The  reform  and \nrevitalization of these traditional industries are keys to a successful economic transformation. \n \n\n2. \n\nLack of New Technologies and New Investments \n\nlittle  connection \n\n \n11. \nHistorically, like many \u201ccompany towns\u201d developed under the planned economy, Baiyin \ndepended heavily on mining and mining-related production. The local economy is isolated and \nthe  outside  economy.  Along  with  economic \nself-independent  with \ntransformation,  the  city\u2019s  economy  had  to  adapt  itself  from  an  enclosed  production  to  a \ncompetitive open market. Economic survival will have to rely on improved productivity through \nadopting  new  technologies  that  have  high  efficiency  and  low  energy  consumption,  and  cause \nless environmental pollution to produce more competitive and marketable products.  Technology \nupgrading requires tremendous investment. New investments are also needed to develop new \nindustries and economic sectors such as agriculture and agroprocessing, tourism, finance, and \ngeneral services. \n \n\nto \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Pollution \n\n \n12. \nHaving been a mining city for more than five decades, Baiyin suffers from environmental \npollution  due  to  industrial  emissions.  In  winter,  smoke  from  heating  stoves  and  small  boilers \ncontributes significantly to air pollution. In addition to the measures and actions undertaken to \ncontrol and reduce industrial emissions (see Appendix 3), expanding the coverage of the district \nheating  services  is  one  effective  means  to  reduce  air  pollution  while  strengthening  the  city\u2019s \ncapacity to provide improved heating service for its residents.  \n \n\n4. \n\nLow Living Standards \n\n \nCompared with living standards in the other more developed cities in the PRC, those in \n13. \nBaiyin  are  relatively  low.  Living  standards  can  be  measured  by  household  incomes  and \nexpenses; type of housing; access to roads, utilities and other infrastructure; education; medical \ncare  condition;  cultural  life;  prices  of  foods  and  other  goods,  etc.  To  improve  the  investment \nenvironment,  Baiyin  needs  to  improve  living  standards  by  adding  new  urban  infrastructure \nincluding roads and public facilities, increasing district heating coverage, improving schools and \nthe medical care system, enriching the cultural life, etc. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \nD. \n\nProposed Project in Promoting Sustainable Urban Development \n\n14. \nThe  proposed  Project  includes  four  investment  components:  (i)  Southern  Baiyin \ninfrastructure, (ii) Baiyin road improvements, (iii) Pingchuan road improvements, and (iv) district \nheating services. \n \nThe  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure  component  will  develop  an  additional  6  km2  of \n15.  \nindustrial  land  south  of  Baiyin,  to  be  equipped  with  roads;  facilities  for  storm  water,  sewer, \npower,  and  heating;  and  communication  facilities  for  new  production  and  investments.  The \nproposed  area  is  adjacent  to  the  BHTIP,  and  is  planned  in  accordance  with  the  city\u2019s \ndevelopment  master  plan.  The  component  will provide  additional  sites  for  new  production  and \nindustries to support the economic transformation of the city. \n \n16. \nThe Baiyin and Pingchuan road improvement components will construct new roads and \nimprove  existing  roads  in  the  urban  areas  in  both  districts.  Some  new  roads  are  in  the  West \nBaiyin  Economic  Development  Area  and  the  Pingchuan  Economic  Development  Area,  which \nwere developed a few years ago as part of the city\u2019s economic transformation plan. The roads in \nthe economic development areas will provide additional infrastructure to satisfy the need of the \nnew  plants  and  investments.  The  roads  in  the  urban  areas  will  improve  traffic  conditions  and \naccess for businesses and residents, improve overall urban living conditions, and promote more \nbusiness development on the roadsides.  \n \n17. \nThe  district  heating  service  component  will  increase  the  coverage  of  district  heating  in \nwest Baiyin, and replace the existing low-efficiency and heavily polluting small heating boilers to \nsave  energy  and  reduce  air  pollution.  This  component  will  improve  living  standards  and  help \npromote urban development. \n \nE. \n\nRecommendations for Continuous Economic Transformation \n\n1. \n\nRole of Government, Public and Private Sector  \n\nThe  joint  effort  of  the  government,  and  the  public  and  private  sectors  will  help  achieve \n18. \nthe goal of economic transformation. BMG will provide an enabling environment for investments \nand  comfortable  living  conditions  to  encourage  the  participation  of  public  and  private  sector \nenterprises  in  economic  activities  and  to  attract  external  investors  to  the  city.  Economic \ntransformation needs to follow market forces through competition to ensure its sustainability. \n \n\n2. \n\nUpgraded City Infrastructure  \n\nThe  construction  of  infrastructure  will  provide  necessary  facilities  for  new  businesses \n19. \nand production, for improving the city traffic condition and living standards, and for improving the \noverall investment environment. New infrastructure will effectively promote new investments in \nthe area. The proposed Southern Baiyin infrastructure component will develop an approximately \n6  km2  area  for  industrial  productions  and  new  investments,  which  will  serve  as  an  engine  to \neffectively help the city maintain sustainable economic growth. The proposed road improvement \nand  district  heating  components  will  improve  the  urban  traffic  condition  and  living  standards, \nwhich will facilitate the city\u2019s economic development and attract new investments. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2       29   \n\n \n\n3. \n\nNew Technologies, Products, and Concepts  \n\n20. \nThe  success  of  economic  transformation  depends  heavily  on  the  introduction  of  new \ntechnologies, new products, and new concepts. For example, for the proposed SBIZ, Baiyin has \nthe  advantage  to  develop  fine  chemicals  and  nonferrous  metal  materials  based  on  local \nresources and markets. Furthermore, among the TDI and aromatic compounds as well as chlor-\nalkali complexes and fluoride compounds are the most promising productions for Baiyin.  \n \n\n4. \n\nSmall Businesses and the Private Sector \n\n21. \nSuccessful growth in small businesses and the private sector will generate a significant \nimpact  for  economic  transformation.  BMG  will  continue  to  encourage  the  growth  of  small \nbusinesses  to  diversify  the  city\u2019s  economy.  BMG  will  strengthen  the  agency  for  promotion  of \nsmall  businesses,  and  provide  networking  and  investment  opportunities,  and  train  the \nunemployed so that they can learn new skills and find new jobs. BMG will set up programs to \nhelp the growth of small businesses and the private sector. \n \n\n5. \n\nTertiary Sectors  \n\n22. \nThe  GDP  ratio  of  the  primary,  the  secondary,  and  the  tertiary  sectors  for  Baiyin  is \n14.4:50.5:35.1  in  2005.  The  ratio  for  Gansu  province  is  15.7:43.4:40.9,  and  that  for  the  entire \ncountry  is  12.5:47.3:40.3.  The  percentage  of  the  tertiary  sector  in  Baiyin  is  lower  than  the \naverage  percentage  for  Gansu  province.  The  BMG  will  promote  and  encourage  the  growth  of \nthe  tertiary  sector  as  one  of  the  directions  for  the  economic  transformation.  A  strategy  for \ndeveloping the tertiary sector will be developed, based on the special conditions in Baiyin and \nthe market needs. BMG will play an active role in planning and promoting the development of \nthe sector, and provide funding support to encourage the development of service sectors such \nas tourism, information, banking, etc. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nDOMESTICALLY FUNDED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS IN BAIYIN \n\n \n1. \nHaving  been  a  copper  mining  city  for  decades,  Bayin  is  known  as  a  major  industrial \npolluter  in  the  western  part  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Apart  from  requesting \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  support,  Baiyin  has  initiated  a  number  of \nenvironmental  improvement  projects  with  funding  support  from  the  national  and  provincial \ngovernments. This appendix summarizes a few typical ongoing interventions and a briefing on \ntheir  links  to  Baiyin  municipal  government\u2019s  (BMG)  efforts  to  achieve  the  mandatory \nenvironmental control targets set by the Government for 2007. \n \nA. \n \n\nMajor Ongoing Domestically Funded Environmental Improvement Projects \n\nBaiyin Nonferrous Metal Corporation Acidifying System  Improvement Project. \nTotal investment is CNY250 million (about $33 million at current exchange rate). The \npurpose  is  to  upgrade  the  processing  technology,  thus  increasing  the  sulfur \nutilization rate from 60% to 90% and reducing annual sulfur emission by 50,000 tons, \nreducing  the  annual  discharge  of  acid  industrial  wastewater  by  660,000  tons,  and \nreducing the discharge of heavy metal pollutants including copper, lead, and arsenic \nby 300 tons; \n\nGansu Rare Earth Corporation Industrial Wastewater Treatment Project Phase \nII.  Total  investment  is  CNY7.21  million  (about  $950,000  at  current  exchange  rate). \nThe purpose is to establish an industrial wastewater treatment pond with a capacity \nof  3  million  cubic  meters  (m3).  The  pond  will  collect  and  treat  all  the  industrial \nwastewater  from  the  rare  earth  processing,  thus  achieving  \u201czero  discharge\u201d  by  this \nindustry  to  the  Yellow  River,  reducing  annual  discharge  of  industrial  wastewater  by \n600,000  tons  and  decreasing  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD)  and  chemical \npollutant discharge by 2,502 tons per year; \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nBaiyin  Municipal  Wastewater  Treatment  Plant  Project.  Total  investment  is \nCNY101  million  ($13  million  at  current  exchange  rate).  The  purpose  is  to  increase \nthe  municipal  wastewater  treatment  capacity  by  40,000  tons  a  day  and  to  install \nwastewater  recycling  facilities  to  use  the  recycled  wastewater  and  stop  direct \ndischarge of municipal wastewater into the Yellow River. \n\nBaiyin Mandatory Pollution Control Targets and Actions to Achieve Them \n\n \nB. \n \n2. \nUnder the 11th Five-Year Development Program for 2006\u20132010, the PRC has set 10% \nreduction  of  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  emission  and  10%  reduction  of  COD  discharge  as  the \nmandatory  pollution  control  target  for  the  nation  as  a  whole.  The  central  Government  has \ndisaggregated  national  targets  and  assigned  them  to  local  governments  at  various  levels  as \ntheir annual mandatory targets for pollution control and environmental improvement. The targets \nspecified  for  Baiyin  for  2007  are  reduction  of  SO2  emission  by  33,000  tons  and  reduction  of \nCOD discharge by 1,500 tons. These targets will be mainly achieved by the domestically funded \nprojects above mentioned.   \n \n3. \nReduction of SO2 Emission by 33,000 Tons. This target is to be achieved by a set of \nenvironmental  improvement  projects  including  the  Baiyin  Nonferrous  Metal  Corporation \nAcidifying System Improvement Project, which will start to reduce SO2 emission by 30,000 tons, \nand install a desulfurization device at four coal-fired power plants. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3       31   \n\n \n\nReduction of COD Discharge by 1,500 Tons This is to be achieved by the Gansu Rare \n4. \nEarth  Corporation  Industrial  Wastewater  Treatment  Project  Phase  II  and  Baiyin  Municipal \nWastewater Treatment Plant Project, which will start to reduce COD discharge by 300 tons and \n1,200 tons, respectively, this year. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND THE ENVIRONMENT

The  city  was \n1. \nestablished  in  the  1950s  under  the  planned  economy  mainly  to  support  copper  mining \nproduction.  Baiyin  used  to  be  the  top  copper  mining  area  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC), accounting for one third of national production. After continued exploitation, the copper \nmines in Baiyin have been exhausted and abandoned. Mining of the other associated minerals \nis also on the decline, with closure projected in less than two decades. Baiyin is classified by the \nGovernment  as  one  of  the  18  resource-exhausted  mining  cities.  Under  the  11th  Five-Year \nProgram  (FYP)  for  2006\u20132010,  the  Government  has  decided  to  provide  special  support,  as  a \nnational  priority,  for  these  resource-exhausted  mining  cities  to  facilitate  their  economic \ntransformation. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  provide  support  to  facilitate  economic  transformation  in  Baiyin  by \nstrengthening the urban services and infrastructures, and promoting capacity development. The \nProject  has  five  components:  (i)  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure,  (ii)  Baiyin  district  road \nimprovements,  (iii)  Pingchuan  district  road  improvements,  (iv)  Baiyin  district  heating  services, \nand (v) capacity development and institutional strengthening. \n \n3. \nBaiyin  municipal  government  (BMG)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  of  the  Project. \nBMG  has  established  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  responsible  for  day-to-day \ncoordination and implementation of the Project. The four investment components of the Project \nwill be implemented by four implementing agencies (IAs).  \n \n4. \n \n\nThe details of the five components are summarized below: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nComponent  1:  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure.  Under  this  component,  the \nProject  will  develop  6  square  kilometers  (km2)  of  industrial  land  with  the  basic \npublic  infrastructure  including  about  24.9  kilometers  (km)  long  of  primary  and \nsecondary  roads  and  related  water  supply  pipelines,  drainage  pipelines  and \nsewers,  heating  supply  pipelines,  optical-fabric  cable  and  electricity  distribution \nlines, lighting, and public green areas. \n \nComponent 2: Baiyin district road improvements. Under this component, the \nProject  will  (a)  construct  nine  new  roads  with  a  total  length  of  23.1  km;  and  (b) \nbuild  connected  water  supply  pipelines,  drainage  pipelines,  sewers,  heating \nsupply  pipelines,  lighting,  bus  rider/pedestrian  and  bicycle  facilities.  This \ncomponent  will  also  build  14  bridges/culverts;  and  rehabilitate  and  widen  three \nexisting roads with a total length of 6.1 km. \n \nComponent 3: Pingchuan district road improvements. Under this component, \nthe Project will construct seven new roads with a total length of 12.6 km; and the \nrelated drainage pipelines, sewers, and water supply pipelines. This component \nwill also build three bridges, and rehabilitate and widen one road 3.5 km long. \n \nComponent 4: district heating services. Under this component, the Project will \nexpand  the  district  heating  service  area  in  Baiyin  district  by  3.2  million  square \nmeters  (m2)  by  building  a  new  heating  source  plant  with  4x58  megawatts \ncapacity,  laying  down  12.6  km  of  heat  transmission  pipelines,  and  installing  29 \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n(v) \n\nheat  exchange  stations  for  connection  with  the  community  heat  distribution \nsystems. \n \nComponent 5: capacity development and institutional strengthening. Under \nthis component, the Project will provide consulting services and financial support \nfor  BMG  to  (a)  design  and  introduce  an  environmental  management  system \n(EMS)  for  the  Southern  Baiyin  industrial  zone  (SBIZ),  (b)  develop  a  geographic \ninformation  system  (GIS)  based  urban  planning  and  road  and  bridge \nmanagement  system  for  integrated  urban  transport  planning  and  management, \n(c)  provide  consulting  services  during  project  implementation,  and  (d)  provide \nsupport  and  training  for  institutional  strengthening  of  BMG,  PMO,  and  IAs  on \nurban planning and management. \n\n \nB. \n\nGeneral Requirements of Consulting Services  \n\n5. \nThe  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  for  the  capacity  development  and \ninstitutional  strengthening  component.  The  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  through  a \nconsulting  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The consulting firm will be selected through the quality- and-cost-\nbased selection method using full technical proposal procedures. The consulting services will be \ngrouped  into  three  subcomponents:  (i)  project  implementation  support,  (ii)  EMS  for  the  SBIZ, \nand (iii) GIS-based urban planning and roads and bridges management system.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProject Implementation Support \n\n6. \nThe Project will be the first for BMG to implement as an Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfunded  project.

The proposed Project will provide additional sites for new production in southern \nBaiyin, improve the road and traffic conditions in Baiyin and Pingchuan districts, and increase the \narea covered by district heating in west Baiyin. \n   \nB. \n \n2. \nOverall, the land acquisition and resettlement impacts of the Project will be significant. The \nimpacts  by  component  are  summarized  in  Table  A11.  In  total,  about  730.4  hectares  (ha)  of  land \nwill  be  permanently  acquired  by  the  Project,  of  which  21%  is  classified  as  farmland  (153.6  ha). \nPermanent  land  acquisition  will  affect  1,619  households  or  6,272  people.  The  Project  will  also \nrequire the temporary acquisition of 13.5 ha of land, all of which is unoccupied state-owned land \nalong roads to be improved. A total of 328 households or 1,450 people will be relocated and about \n61,012  square  meters  (m2)  of  residential  houses  will  be  demolished.  Forty-two  enterprises  and \nshops with a total of 1,378 employees will be affected, and 28,814 m2 of nonresidential structures \nwill  be  dismantled.  In  addition,  some  productive  assets,  ground  attachments,  and  public \ninfrastructure  and  facilities  will  be  affected  including  electric  poles,  toilets,  fences,  hand-pumped \nwells, doors, pigpens, platform, barns, greenhouses, concrete and asphalt roads, and trees. Of the \ntotal  affected  population,  1,619  households  or  6,272  people  are  rural  residents,  and  1,584  are \nurban residents, owners of structures with or without certificates, private business owners, and staff. \nThere  are  no  ethnic  minority  people  among  the  affected  persons  (APs).  The  resettlement  plans \n(RPs) for the components will be updated based on a detailed design and submitted to the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for approval during implementation. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe compensation for permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (1998) and the State Council Decision to Deepen Reform and \nStrictly  Enforce  Land  Administration  (Document  28  dated  November  2004).  House  demolition  is \nbased on the Provincial and Municipal Urban Housing Demolishment Administration Regulations. \nThe  RPs  for  the  investment  components  comply  with  PRC  laws  and  regulations  of  resettlement \nand  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  Based  on  consultations  with  local \ngovernments and those affected, a set of compensation standards was adopted by the city project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  and  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  The  resettlement  principles \nestablished for the Project are as follows: (i) land acquisition and involuntary resettlement should \nbe avoided or minimized, where feasible, through alternative design options; (ii) compensation and \nentitlements must be based on replacement value and must be adequate to allow those affected to \nat  least  maintain  their  preproject  standard  of  living,  with  the  prospect  of  improvement;  (iii)  land \ntemporarily  occupied  and  the  period  of  disruption  are  to  be  kept  to  a  minimum;  (iv)  all  the  APs, \nlegal  and  illegal,  are  to  be  taken  into  consideration  and  accounted  for;  (v)  the  per  capita \nlandholding after land acquisition should be sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standard; \n(vi) where land allocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standards, \nother  income-generating  activities  will  be  provided;  (vii)  a  preferential  policy  will  be  applied  to \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n Appendix 11       47 \n\nCompensation, Income, and Livelihood Restoration Scheme \n\nvulnerable  groups  with  regard  to  compensation,  payment  of  special  fund,  minimum  living \nguarantee,  and  employment;  (viii)  all  APs  will  be  adequately \ninformed  about  eligibility, \ncompensation rates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, project implementation \nschedule; and (ix) close monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to identify and resolve any \nproblems.  \n \nD. \n \nFor  permanent  land  acquisition,  a  small  portion  of  the  land  compensation  will  be  given  to \n4. \nthe village collective and the balance will be paid in cash to the APs. The resettlement subsidy and \nthe compensation for standing crops, trees, and ground attachments will be paid to the APs. For \nresidential  houses  and  nonresidential  (enterprises  and  shops)  houses  to  be  demolished, \ncompensation at replacement value will be paid to owners. The households that have to relocate \nwill  also  receive  a  relocation  allowance.  The  resettlement  strategy  encompasses  (i)  the \nreplacement  of  housing,  and  (ii)  the  restoration  of  livelihood  and  income.  For  people  losing  rural \nhousing, the township government and the village committees will arrange new sites and allocate \nnew house plots in advance to the APs. The APs will continue to live in their old houses until the \nnew  houses  are  built.  For  households  losing  urban  housing,  compensation  will  be  in  cash  at \nreplacement  value  or  through  house  exchange.  The  township  government  and  IAs  will  help  the \nAPs  find  available  housing  close  to  their  original  homes,  if  preferred.  The  respective  municipal \nPMO,  IAs,  and  township/local  governments  will  provide  necessary  assistance  for  house \nconstruction  and  relocation  during  resettlement  implementation,  especially  for  the  vulnerable \ngroups. \n \n5. \nThe  measures  for  economic  rehabilitation  include  (i)  providing  employment  opportunities \nduring  the  project  construction  and  operational  phases;  (ii)  redistributing  farmland  within  affected \ngroups/villages  wherever  possible;  (iii)  upgrading  existing \nintensifying \nagriculture,  and  improving  irrigation  facilities;  (iv)  developing  off-farm  opportunities;  and  (v) \nproviding technical training to the APs to increase their skills. Relocated enterprises will have the \noptions  of  compensation  and  resettlement.  The  same  enterprises  will  reemploy  the  affected \nemployees. For vulnerable APs, the IAs will establish a special fund of CNY2,000 per household \nfor  them  to  improve  their  living  standards  and  assistance  to  restore  their  living  conditions  and \nincomes. \n \nE. \n \n6. \nEach PMO and IA will have at least two full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and \nresettlement,  respectively.  The  staff  from  each  component\u2019s  resettlement  unit  will  take  the  lead \nresponsibility  for  coordinating  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  monitoring  of  land \nland \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  They  will  work  closely  with  relevant  village  officials, \nadministration bureaus, and house demolition offices, and will be responsible for supervising and \nmonitoring resettlement (e.g., delivery of entitlements, selection of new housing sites, restoration of \nincomes, provision of replacement land, and other economic measures). A training program will be \norganized for the resettlement officers. Resettlement implementation will be scheduled to precede \nthe  construction  schedules  of  the  components.  Most  resettlement  activities  will  occur  between \nMarch 2008 and December 2009. All compensation and assistances will be paid to APs before civil \nworks begin.  Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in each village, neighborhood, and \nenterprise and the compensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with village committees, \nhouseholds, and enterprises.  \n \n\nInstitutional Arrangement and Implementation Schedule \n\nfarmland, \n\nlow-yield \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nthe \n\nframework, \n\nthe  project-affected  areas, \n\nimplementation  schedule  and \n\nInformation Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance Procedures \n\nF. \n \n7. \nIn accordance with PRC national, provincial, and municipal policies and regulations for land \nacquisition,  house  demolition  and  resettlement,  and  in  line  with  ADB  policies  and  guidelines,  the \nPMO/IAs  conducted  public  consultations  and  disseminated  information  about  the  project  to  the \nAPs,and  village  governments  during  the  project  preparation  stage.  During  meetings,  interviews, \nfocus  group  discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings, \nlocal representatives participated in the planning and their concerns have been integrated into the \nRPs.  The  draft  RP  was  disclosed  and  distributed  to  the  affected  townships,  villages,  APs,  and \nresettlement  information  booklets  were  disseminated  to  the  APs  on  20  June  2007.  This  booklet \nconfirms \nthe \ncompensation  standards  for  land  acquisition  and  other  assets,  relocation  assistance,  livelihood \nrehabilitation  strategy,  and  dispute  resolution  procedures.  The  RPs  were  posted  on  the  ADB \nwebsite  in  June  2007.  The  RPs  will  be  updated  and  finalized  upon  completion  of  engineering \ndesigns,  and  will  be  posted  on  the  ADB  website  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Information \nDisclosure Policy. The respective project IAs will establish project resettlement units for supervising \nimplementation, continuing public consultation, monitoring progress, and responding to grievances. \nThe  grievance  redress  procedures  are  well-established  and  explanations  will  be  included  in  the \nresettlement information booklets. \n \nG. \n \n8. \nThe  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  $15  million,  equivalent  to \nCNY116.99  million  in  2007  prices,  including  contingencies.  The  cost  estimates  include  costs  of \ncompensation for land acquisition, house demolition, reestablishment of special facilities, planning, \nmanagement, training, and monitoring and evaluation. The government will provide a counterpart \nbudget \nfund  shortage  occurs  during \nresettlement implementation. \n \nH. \n \nInternal  and  external  monitoring  of  RP  implementation  will  be  conducted.  Monitoring \n9. \nmethodologies are specified in the RPs. Internal supervision and monitoring will be done by each \nIA to ensure compliance with the provisions of the RP. The PMO and IAs have agreed to a set of \nsupervision  milestones  with  ADB,  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  implementation  of  resettlement \nactivities. External monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by an independent agency under \ncontract  to  the  PMO/IAs,  and  semiannual  reports  will  be  submitted  directly  to  both  the  PMO  and \nADB.  \n \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nfor  resettlement  activities, \n\nincluding  support  where \n\nBudget \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nTable A11: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\nEngineering Works \n\nPermanent Land Acquisition \n\nTemporary Land Acquisition \n\nResidential House \nDemolition \n\nQty \n\nUnits \n\nOf which \nFarmland \n(ha) \n\nTotal \nArea \n(ha) \n590 \n\nAffected \nHH \n\nAP \n\nOf which \nFarmland \n(ha) \n\nTotal \nArea \n(ha) \n0 \n\nAffected \nHH \n\nAP \n\nAffected \nHH \n\nAPa \n\nTotal \nArea \n(m2)2 \n0 \n\n590 \n\nha \n\n36.7 \n\n506  2,090 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\nProject \nComponent \n\nSouthern \nBaiyin \nInfrastructureb \n\nBaiyin District \nRoad \nImprovements \nPingchuan \nDistrict Road \nImprovements \nDistrict \nHeating \nServices \n\nProject \nActivities \n\n(i)  Level off \narea; \n\n(ii)  Roads; \n(iii)  Pipeline of \n\nwastewater, \nstorm \nwater, \nheating; \n(iv)  Power and \ncommunica\n-tion cables \n\n(i)  Roads \n(ii)  Bridges \n\n(i)  Roads \n(ii)  Bridges \n\nHeating boilersc \nPipeline network \nHeating \nexchange \nstationd \n\n29.91 \nkm \n10,651  m2 \n\nkm \n17.67 \n8,325  m2 \n\n4X58  MW \nkm \n\n21 \n\n29 \n\nset \n\n96.21\n\n74.25 \n\n857  2,899 \n\n6.67 \n\n0 \n\n0  60,553 \n\n237\n\n1,963 \n\n44.19\n\n42.61 \n\n256  1,283 \n\n6.67 \n\n0  29,273 \n\n91\n\n865 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n\n0  89,826 \n\n328  2,828 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \nAP = affected person, ha = hectare, HH = household, km = kilometer, km2 = square kilometer, m2= square meter, MW = megawatt. \na The house area of enterprises is included.

The City consists of two urban districts (Baiyin and Pingchuan) and three counties \n(Huining, Jingtai, and Jingyuan) with 1.746 million people and a total area of 21,158 square kilometers (km2). \nThe Project will directly benefit 0.5 million people living in Baiyin and Pingchuan, especially the poor, through (i) \nimproved  infrastructure  including  road  networks  and  better  road  conditions;  (ii)  increased  mobility,  reduced \ntraffic  congestion  and  improved  public  transportation;  (iii)  improved  road  safety  and  reduced  traffic  accidents; \n(iv)  increased  foreign  and  domestic  investments  resulting  from  the  improved  environment;  (v)  improved  living \nenvironment  and  quality  of  life;  (vi)  better  and  quicker  access  to  employment  and  schools,  as  well  as  social \nservices;  (vii)  increased  employment  and  income-generation  opportunities,  especially  for  the  poor  who  will \nbenefit  from  temporary  jobs  created  during  the  construction  phase  and  permanent  jobs  created  during  the \noperational  phase;  (viii)  improved  central  heating  supply;  (ix)  reduced  air  emissions  of  sulfur  dioxide,  carbon \ndioxide, nitrogen oxide, total suspended particulates, and solid wastes; (x) improved air quality; and (xi) reduced  \nuse of coal and coal briquettes that cause environmental and health impacts, particularly for the poor. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n\nThe  poverty  analysis  is  based  on  published  statistical  data,  a  socioeconomic  questionnaire  survey  of  300 \nhouseholds,  focus  group  discussions,  and  key  informants  interview  in  the  project  areas.  Baiyin  city  has  an \naverage municipal poverty line of CNY156 per capita per month for urban districts (Baiyin and Pingchuan). On \nthe basis of these poverty lines, 64,619 people or 25,406 households were classified as urban poor and were \nentitled to receive the minimum living guarantee (MLG) from the Baiyin Civil Affairs Bureau in 2005. The total \nurban  poor  population  living  under  MLG  in  2005  included  laid-off  workers  (40.65%),  retirees  (1.95%), \nunemployed  (10.46%),  \u201cthree-no\u2019s\u201d 1  (0.59%),  working  employees  (16.16%),  and  the  others  (30.20%).  In \naddition,  there  were  436  urban people and  664  rural  people  that  received  temporary  lowest  cost-of-living,and \n4,319  rural  people  received  lowest  cost-of-living  in  a  fixed  period.  By  the  current  definition  of  the  poor  line, \napproximately 15.35% persons of the total urban population live under the MLG in the project areas, including \n33,096  persons  in  Baiyin  and  12,030  in  Pingchuan.  People  under  the  MLG  receive  MLG  fund  from  the  Civil \nAffairs Bureau of Baiyin city and Pingchuan district. The rural poverty population in Baiyin city decreased from \n163,500 in 2000 to 147,800 at the end of 2005, and the poverty ratio declined from 12.30% to 11.12%. With the \nenhancement of integrated agricultural development, the net income of the farmer increased from CNY1,601 in \n2001 to CNY2,023 in 2005, with an increase of CNY422. In Huining, the key national poverty county, the net \nincome of farmers increased from CNY1,165 in 2001 to CNY1,575 in 2005, an increase of CNY410.  \n\nVarious  poverty  reduction  measures  are  being  implemented  by  the  Baiyin  municipal  government  (BMG), \nincluding (i) extending to the elderly insurance coverage, health and  employment benefits; and (ii) establishing \nand improving the guarantee mechanism for land-losing farmers and resettled people. In 2005, BMG disbursed \nCNY5 million as medical assistance, CNY22.79 million as reemployment assistance, CNY52.06 million as basic \nprovision  protection,  and  CNY15.32  million  as  relief  from  natural  disasters.  In  addition,  BMG  implemented \nprograms to waive agricultural taxes, increase the provision of inputs to agriculture, formulate favorable policies \nof  subsidies  for  farmers,  which  resulted  in  a  CNY98  per  capita  increase  in  farmers\u2019  benefits.  The  income  of \nfarmers  in  the  poor  area  has  been  further  increased.  At  the  end  of  2005,  the  average  net  income  per  capita \nreached  CNY2,023,  CNY128  over  the  previous  year,  an  increase  of  6.75%.  All  these  efforts  have  achieved \npositive results toward poverty reduction in Baiyin city. \n\n                                                 \n1 The term \u201cthree no\u2019s\u201d means no jobs, no ability to work, and no financial support from family and other resources. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12       51 \n\n   No  \n\n              \n\n  Yes      \n\nThe  Project  will  create  3,640  person-years  direct  and  indirect  short-term  employment  opportunities,  with \nearnings  totaling  CNY49.09  million  during  the  construction  phase,  and  1,350  long-term  employment \nopportunities, with wages totaling CNY18.14 million per annum during the operation phase. The poor, women, \nand  ethnic  minorities  will  be  given  priority  in  both  short-term  and  the  mid-  and  long-term  employment \nopportunities.  In  addition,  local  procurement  of  the  materials  required  for  the  Project  is  expected  to  create \nadditional  jobs.  A  health  benefit  analysis  was  conducted  to  estimate  the  health  benefits  associated  with  the \nimproved  central  heating  supply  services.  It  is  estimated  that  the  direct  annual  health  benefit  from  the  urban \nenvironmental  improvement  is  CNY4.66  million.  Improved  heating  infrastructure  will  reduce  morbidity  and \nmortality rate from air-related diseases, associated medical costs, particularly for poor, women, children and the \nelderly. It will also reduce women\u2019s burden of housework and facilitate longer study hours for children/students \nduring  winter.  However,  for  the  full  health  benefits  to  be  realized,  the  following  will  be  required:  (i)  parallel \nimprovements in public health education, (ii) higher standards of personal hygiene, (iii) prevention and control, \nand (iv) improved housing and living conditions. These will be particularly important for the poor, who are likely \nto suffer most from the incidence of pollution-related diseases. The arrangements for monitoring health benefits \nwill  be  incorporated  in  the  project  performance  management  system  to  be  established  for  comprehensive \nmonitoring of the project impact.  \n \nThus the project will benefit the poor, women, the elderly, and the floating population through improved roads \nand  public  transportation  services,  environmental  quality  and  health  benefits.  Poor  households  that  tend  to \nreside in areas with poor service levels and are less able to cope with the disruption and illness caused by poor \nservices will gain significant benefits. The proposed tariff reforms for heating services and provision of heating \nsubsidies to poor households will significantly benefit the beneficiary population, especially poor households.  \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nStakeholder analysis was conducted during the poverty and social assessment. The primary stakeholders of the \nProject area include urban residents, affected persons (APs), industries and businesses, the executing agency \n(EA) and implementing agencies (IAs); the secondary stakeholders include relevant government agencies, such \nas  Civil  Affairs  Bureau,  Poverty  Reduction  Office,  Health  Bureau  etc.  During  the  project  preparation,  a  socio-\neconomic  survey  of  300  households,  stakeholder  consultation  workshops,  focus  group  discussions,  and  key \ninformant interviews were conducted to gain a better understanding of the demand, needs, and interests of the \nstakeholders.  Several  rounds  of  public  consultations  in  the  project  areas  were  carried  out  to  prepare  the \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  the  resettlement  plans  (RPs).  The  public  consultations  and \ninformation disclosure included (i) introducing the project  components to the stakeholders; (ii) soliciting ideas, \nsuggestions, comments on the potential social and environmental impacts of the Project; and (iii) presenting the \nfindings of the EIA and RPs, summarizing potential social and environmental impacts and mitigation measure, \nand providing answers raised by workshop participants. Public consultations and information disclosure of the \nRPs  were  conducted  during  surveys,  community  meetings,  interviews,  and  workshops.  The  results  of  these \nmeetings and concerns of the APs, particularly the poor and women, were integrated into the RPs.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nPublic consultation and participation have been the core element of the project design and will continue during \nproject implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Ongoing consultations will also be carried out by the IAs to \nunderstand and meet the evolving needs and expectations of the users as well as increase the awareness of \nthe public, especially the beneficiaries, about the benefits of the Project, and encourage the active involvement \nof  local  communities  to  maximize  their  support  to  the  Project.  Public  consultation  and  participation  will  be \ncarried  out  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  RP  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The \nconsultations, including a grievance mechanism, will continue during land acquisition and resettlement so that \nthe problems and needs of APs are properly addressed in a timely manner.  \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nResults from the household survey and focus group discussion indicate that women are primarily responsible \nfor heating provision and caring for the sick and the elderly. Time and efforts spent on these activities will be \nreduced  with  the  improvement  of  transportation  and  heating  facilities,  easy  access  to  social  services.  Thus, \n\n   Yes      \n\n              \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\npeople  will  have  time  to  engage  in  income-generating  activities,  to  have  fun  with  the  family,  and  to  have \nadequate  leisure  time.  Inadequate  public  transportation  and  central  heating  supply  contribute  to  gender \ninequities in the burden of household work. The poverty and social assessment indicated that women strongly \nsupport  the  Project.  Women  believe  that  the  Project  will  improve  the  urban  living  environment,  create \nemployment  opportunities,  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  airborne  diseases.  To  maximize  the  project  benefits, \nwomen  will  be  given  priority  in  employment  and  training  opportunities  during  the  project  construction  and \noperation phases. A proactive employment program for women will be adopted by the IAs.  \nHas an output been prepared? \n              \nE.

Affordability  to  the  poor  was \nassessed  based  on  the  existing tariffs  and \nhousehold  income  data  of  the socioeconomic \nhousehold survey. The average households in \nthe  lowest  income  class  have  no  problems \nwith the existing tariff on heating.  \nTo  ensure \nfamilies  have \naccess  to  the  improved heating  service,  BMG \nintroduce  a  special  heating \nagreed \nassistance  program  for  such families.  The \nprogram  will  ensure  provision  of  a  basic \nvolume  of  quality  heating  supply  for  low-\nincome families as an essential social service, \nwhich  is  to  be  financed  by  (i)  an  appropriate \nsubsidy from BMG, and (ii) the subsidy fund as \na portion of the revenue generated by Minyue \nDistrict Heating Corporation.  \nThe Project will create 3,400 person-years of \ndirect  short-term  employment  opportunities, \nwith earnings totaling CNY49.09 million during \nthe  construction  phase,  and  1,350  long-term \nemployment opportunities, with wages totaling \nCNY18.14  million  per  annum  during \nthe \noperation  phase.  The  closure  of  63  small \nboilers  will  affect  about  200  workers.  Re-\nemployment  plans  were  prepared  by  the  IAs \nto  ensure  that  all  he  affected  workers  will  be \nreassigned  to  other  similar  jobs  or  retrained \nfor  other  jobs  in  the  new  heating  plant  and \nheat exchange stations. The affected workers \nwill  not  be  financially  disadvantaged  as  they \nwould  have  been  without  the  Project.

The  financial \nfeasibility  of  these  two  components  was  assessed  by  calculating  the  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn (FIRR) as the measure of financial benefits and comparing this indicator to the weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC). All revenue and cost flow streams were expressed in constant \nprices. The FIRR was calculated on an incremental basis. The differences in revenue and cost \nstreams between a \u201cwith-project and without-project scenarios were evaluated and discounted \nto present value over the projection period. \n \n2. \nBased on the 2 years\u2019 operation of Minyue District Heating Corporation (MDHC) and the \nfinancial  projection  provided  by  the  Design  Institute  based  on  the  District  Heating  Expansion \nProgram for the MDHC concession area, the FIRR for the district heating services component is \n6.4%. \n  \nThe WACC for the component was calculated at 3.02% using the following assumptions: \n3. \n(i)  the  relending  agreement  between  the  Baiyin  municipal  government  (BMG)  and  MDHC  will \nadopt the same terms  as the loan between Asian Development Bank  (ADB) and the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC),  with  an  estimated  interest  rate  of  5.71%;  (ii)  risk  premium  of  equity \nover debt is 8%; (iii) the domestic inflation rate is 3.0%; (iv) income tax remains at 33%; and (v) \nthe foreign exchange risk premium is 2.4%. \n \n4. \nThe  Baiyin  High-Tech  Industrial  Park  (BHTIP)  is  part  of  BMG,  but  is  not  a  financially \nindependent  entity.  Financial  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure \ncomponent  to  assess  the  financial  viability  of  this  revenue-generating  component  and  its \nfinancial implications for economic transformation. The main revenue is generated through fees \ncollected  by  the  BHTIP,  which  leases  or  transfers  the  land  use  right  of  the  fully  developed \nindustrial land to tenant enterprises. The FIRR was calculated using the current promotion rate.  \n \n5. \nThe  financial  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  assumptions  that  (i)  the  total  land  area \navailable  for  leasing  will  be  approximately  7,817  mu  (667  square  meters  [m2])  after  deducting \nthe land areas allocated for roads, buffer zones, and other public infrastructure including green \nareas; and (ii) industrial land will be leased out or the land use right will be transferred in 5 years \nafter  development.  The  FIRR  throughout  the  project  period  of  25  years  will  be  at  8.7%.  The \nWACC  is  calculated  at  3.13%,  using  the  same  parameters  as  those  adopted  for  the  district \nheating services component. \n \n6. \nand A13.2). \n \n\nSensitivity analysis was conducted for the FIRR of these two components (Tables A13.1 \n\nVariables \nBase Case \n10% increase in capital cost overrun \n10% decrease in revenue \n20% decrease in revenue \n10% increase in operation cost \nOne-year delay in project completion \n10% decrease in revenue plus 10% increase in operation cost \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTable A13.1: District Heating Services Component \nFIRR (%) \n6.4 \n5.5 \n3.8 \n0.6 \n5.2 \n4.6 \n1.2 \n\nSensitivity Index \n\n \n\n1.46 \n4.10 \n4.52 \n1.90 \n \n8.06 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13        55 \n\n \n7. \nSensitivity analysis reveals that the district heating services component can generate a \nFIRR higher than the WACC if adverse impacts do not exceed 10%. With an existing collection \nrate  of  95%,  the  track  record  of  MDHC  in  revenue  collection  is  encouraging.  Since  coal  and \nelectricity account for 80% of the operation cost of MDHC, the FIRR of this component will be \nsensitive to changes in the prices of electricity and coal. The financial sustainability of MDHC is \nprotected  under  the  Government\u2019s  heating  reform  policy  and  regulations,  which  allow \nnegotiation  of  tariff  adjustments  if  the  changes  in  energy  prices  exceed  10%.  In  the  case  of \nsignificant  increase  in  the  costs  of  MDHC\u2019s  operation  inputs  leading  to  a  cost  recovery  ratio \nbelow 1.2:1, MDHC may request BMG for a tariff review. BMG will, if the request is considered \nreasonable, use its best efforts to provide support to MDHC to maintain its financial viability. In \ncase tariff adjustment is considered the best option, BMG will organize public consultation with \nkey stakeholders including the representative of the low income families or other mechanisms \nas provided for in the laws and regulations on utility tariff settings before adjusting the tariff. The \ncomponent is also sensitive to revenues. If the proposed district heating system fails to achieve \nfull-scale  service  expansion,  it  will  be  difficult  to  make  the  system  financially  viable  without  a \ntariff increase. \n \n\nTable A13.2: Southern Baiyin Infrastructure Component \n\n \n\nSensitivity Index \n\nFIRR (%) \n8.7 \n7.7 \n7.8 \n7.5 \n6.6 \n4.4 \n8.4 \n6.4 \n\nVariables \nBase Case \n10% increase in capital cost overrun \n10% decrease in land revenue \n10% decrease in tax revenue \n10% decrease in both land and tax revenues \n20% decrease in both land and tax revenues \n10% increase in operation cost \n1-year delay in project completion \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8. \nFrom the financial analysis, it can be concluded that the Southern Baiyin infrastructure \ncomponent is financially viable. This component will be able to maintain a FIRR higher than the \nWACC  under  a  combined  adverse  impact  of  1-year  implementation  delay,  10%  decrease  in \nrevenue, and 10% increase in operation cost. Sensitivity analysis reveals that this component is \nsensitive to revenues. If the industrial land developed under the Project fails to attract investors, \nthis component will run into financial difficulty. \n \n \n\n1.10 \n1.04 \n1.31 \n2.37 \n2.45 \n0.29 \n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nEconomic  analysis  was  conducted  for  each  investment  component  and  the  Project \nfollowing the steps of demand forecast, least-cost analysis, assessment of economic costs and \nbenefits,  and  calculation  of  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  Project  risks  were \nassessed  through  sensitivity  analysis  under  different  risk  scenarios.  Baiyin  is  a  resource-\nexhausted  mining  city  that  is  in  a  process  of  economic  transformation.  Demand  forecast  was \nconducted  based  on  a  sector  review  in  line  with  the  Baiyin  Urban  Development  Master  Plan \n(2001\u20132020) endorsed by the Baiyin People\u2019s Congress. \n \nA. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n \nThe  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure  component  is  to  expand  the  Southern  Baiyin \n2. \nindustrial  zone  (SBIZ)  by  developing  6  square  kilometers  (km2)  of  industrial  land.  Given  its \ngeographic  location,  the  SBIZ  has  only  two  alternatives  for  expansion:  to  the  west  or  to  the \nsouth. Expansion to the south is the least-cost option, because it will enable the SBIZ to better \nutilize  existing  urban  infrastructure  including  the  road  network,  wastewater  treatment  facilities, \nand power supply system, and will require less land acquisition and resettlement. Analyses for \nthe  two  road  improvements  components  were  undertaken  to  compare  two  alternatives:  (i) \nbuilding  a  systematic  road  transport  framework  for  long-term  urban  development  (with  the \nProject),  or  (ii)  relying  on  strengthened  road  maintenance  of  the  existing  urban  roads  (without \nthe Project). \n \n3. \nLeast-cost  analysis  for  district  heating  services  component  compared  the  costs  of \nalternative heating systems including individual electric boiler (1.8 megawatts [MW]), individual \ngas-fired  heating  facility  (7  MW),  small  coal-fired  community  heating  boiler  (less  than  7  MW), \nand  large  coal-fired  heating  boiler  (58  MW).  These  alternatives  are  technically  feasible  but \nmutually exclusive for the Project. Alternative analysis concludes that centralized district heating \nbased on a large coal-fired heating boiler is the least-cost option. Alternative analysis took into \nconsideration the observations that (i) coal will remain as the main source of energy for heating \nsupply because Gansu province is short of gas or oil supply; and (ii) power-heat co-generation \nwill not be financially viable due to the adequate supply of electricity power on the local market, \nwhich  leaves  no  room  for  a  relatively  small  power  and  heat  co-generation  plant  to  survive \nwithout a subsidy. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nEconomic Costs. Financial costs, including physical contingencies, are converted, after \ndeducting taxes and duties, by applying the conversion factors to present the economic costs in \ndomestic  price  numeraire.  Economic  costs  include  (i)  the  costs  of  construction  including \nphysical  contingencies  and  the  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  (ii)  the  costs  of \noperation and maintenance. \n \n5. \nEconomic  Benefits.  The  economic  benefits  for  the  different  components  were \ncalculated  with  different  approaches.  Economic  benefits  of  the  Southern  Baiyin  infrastructure \ncomponent were calculated based on (i) increased land value, and (ii) incremental wages and \nother incomes generated by the employment opportunities created in the SBIZ. \n \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  two  road  improvements  components  were  calculated  in \n6. \nterms of savings resulting from the improved roads and traffic conditions under the with-Project \nscenario  against  the  alternative  without-Project  scenario.  The  economic  benefits  consist  of  (i) \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14         57 \n\nsavings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  (ii)  savings  in  travel  time,  and  (iii)  savings  due  to  reduced \ncosts of road accidents.    \n \n7. \nThe economic benefits for the district heating services component include savings from \nthe  improved  energy  efficiency  in  the  form  of  reduced  coal  consumption,  and  environmental \nimprovement  resulting  from  reduced  environmental  costs  due  to  the  reduction  in  pollutant \nemissions  such  as  sulfur  dioxide,  total  suspended  particulates,  and  carbon  dioxide.  The \nincremental economic benefits were calculated as the difference between the centralized district \nheating system proposed for the Project and the existing small community heating boilers. \n \n8. \nEIRR  Calculation.  The  EIRR  was  calculated  for  the  investment  components  and  the \nProject,  respectively.
