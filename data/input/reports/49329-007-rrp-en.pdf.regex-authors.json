THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to\nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Khulna Sewerage System Development Project.1\n2. The project aims to establish a sustainable and inclusive sewerage system in Khulna, the\nthird largest city in Bangladesh, to contribute to ensuring that the basic needs of the people are\nmet amid rapid urbanization and growth under the Perspective Plan of Bangladesh 2010\u20132021:\nMaking Vision 2021 a Reality.2  The project will support the establishment of an organized\nsewerage system, strengthen institutional capacity in delivering sewage management services,\nand  increase  public  awareness  on  safe  sanitation  services  in  accordance  with  national\ndevelopment programs.3\nII. THE PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n3. Bangladesh\u2019s urbanization. Rapid urbanization featured prominently in Bangladesh\nduring 2009\u20132018, exacerbating challenges in a country that has one of the highest population\ndensities in the world.4 Annual urban population growth averaged 3.17% during 2015\u20132018,\nsignificantly higher than the national average of 1.37%. In 2018, about 61 million people, or 37%\nof the total population of 164 million, lived in urban areas.5 Rapid urbanization spurs economic\nproductivity through agglomeration advantages, but places severe strain on the environment and\non basic urban services. Only the capital city Dhaka has a piped sewer network, which serves\n18% of its residents.6 Vast quantities of untreated sewage are discharged into rivers, canals, and\ngroundwater, posing threats to the environment and to public health.7\n4. Sewerage problems in Khulna. Khulna has a population of about 1.5 million and a\npopulation density of 6,877 people per square kilometer (km2), well above the national average\nof 1,240 people per km2. The city is expected to see increased commercial and industrial activity\nupon completion of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge, which will provide improved connectivity with\nDhaka.8 Khulna\u2019s residents experience persistent urban service limitations, particularly in sewage\nmanagement. There is no centralized sewerage system in Khulna and no sewerage tariffs. Most\nhouseholds depend on on-site sanitation systems such as pit latrines or septic tanks, and the city\nlacks a systematic service approach for collection, treatment, and disposal of fecal sludge from\n1  The project is listed in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019.

Washington, DC. \n7  Development partners including the World Bank and the Islamic Development Bank are supporting sewerage \nimprovement in Bangladesh. Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Other Urban Infrastructure and Services \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  This multipurpose road\u2013rail bridge across the Padma River, which is expected to be completed in 2021, will link the \nsouthwest part of the country to the northern and eastern regions. When completed, it will be the longest bridge in \nBangladesh, with a main bridge length of 6.15 km. ", "2 \non-site systems\u2014known as fecal sludge management (FSM).9 As a result, sewage and fecal \nsludge  enter  groundwater  or  surface  drains,  causing  clogging  and  serious  environmental \nproblems, including contamination of rivers near Khulna. About 0.5 million people living in low-\nincome communities (LICs) are most vulnerable to the impacts of poor sanitation services. \nMoreover, the lack of access to sewage places particular burden on women, given that they are \nprimarily responsible for household sanitation. Two institutions provide sanitation services in \nKhulna: (i) the Khulna City Corporation (KCC), which is responsible for FSM;10 and (ii) the Khulna \nWater Supply and Sewerage Authority (KWASA), which is in charge of developing, constructing, \nand operating the sewerage system.11 KWASA does not have any sewerage system to manage \nat present, hence, coordination between KWASA and KCC is not in place.  \n \n5.  Sewerage problems exacerbated by climate change and increasing disaster risk. \nBangladesh is highly vulnerable to natural hydrometeorological hazards.12 Monsoon flooding, \ntropical cyclones, and droughts are the most common natural disasters, and are becoming more \nfrequent and intense because of climate change.13 Khulna is located on the coastal belt of \nBangladesh and is part of the Ganges\u2013Brahmaputra Delta, which is known for its vulnerability to \nrising seas and floods. Most areas of Khulna are prone to fluvial and coastal flooding, and the \nwater quality in nearby rivers is affected by salinity intrusion, posing high disaster risks and health \nhazards to residents. Urban infrastructure and services urgently need to be improved to adapt to \nthese  threats.  A  sustainable  sewerage  system  will  be  critical  to  (i)  mitigate  water  quality \ndeterioration, and (ii) decongest the existing drainage system from uncontained septic tank \ndischarge.14 \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s engagement in Khulna\u2019s water supply and sewerage systems. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) supported KWASA to prepare its two 5-year business plans\u2014one in \n2011 and one in 2016. The business plans focused on (i) switching the water source from \ngroundwater to surface water, (ii) introducing sewerage systems, and (iii) expanding water supply \nsystems. Launched in 2011 and completed in 2019, the Khulna Water Supply Project supported \nthe switch from groundwater to surface water based on the recommendations of KWASA\u2019s \nbusiness plans.15 The project increased Khulna\u2019s water supply to 113 liters per capita per day, \nwith  875,000  beneficiaries,  through  the  establishment  of  65  district  metering  areas  and \nconstruction of a water treatment plant with a capacity of 110,000 cubic meters (m3) per day. The \nimproved water supply has led to more sewage being generated in Khulna, requiring urgent \nintervention in sewerage. Supported by ADB technical assistance, KWASA in 2016 prepared a \nWastewater Management Master Plan to establish a sustainable and comprehensive sewerage \nsystem in Khulna by 2035.16 The master plan recommends a phased intervention to address \nchallenges in sewage management, recognizing that a 100% piped network may not be realistic \n \n9  Of Khulna\u2019s population, 64% use septic tanks (average volume: 16.6 cubic meters [m3]), and the remaining 36% use \npit latrines (average volume: 2.0 m3). Most septic tanks are not connected to soak pits and discharge directly into \nopen drains. The one operational FSM system, in the northern part of Khulna, covers only 2% of the city\u2019s population. \n10 Government of Bangladesh. 2015.

Dhaka. \n11 KWASA was established in 2008 as an independent organization responsible for water supply and sewage \nmanagement in Khulna city, under the Water Supply and Sewerage Act 1996. \n12 Cyclones and floods have killed nearly 520,000 since 1980. Cyclone Sidr (2007) alone killed about 15,000 people \nand caused about $1.7 billion in damages and losses. https://www.gfdrr.org/en/region/bangladesh. \n13 Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Environment and Forests. 2009.

Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for Supporting the Khulna Water Supply \nProject. Manila. The master plan suggested (i) division of the entire Khulna city into 10 sewage districts and (ii) \ndevelopment of the city\u2019s sewerage system in three phases by 2035. The project will include seven sewerage districts \nwholly or partially under phases 1 and 2 of the master plan.  \n ", "3 \ngiven technical, socioeconomic, and financial constraints. Further institutional support is required \nto strengthen KWASA\u2019s capacity for managing the sewerage system including operation and \nmaintenance (O&M), and to explore possible reuse of wastewater. \n \n7.  Alignment with ADB and country priorities. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020, which aims to ease infrastructure constraints in \nurban development.17 It will contribute to the following ADB Strategy 2030 operational priorities \n(OPs): (i) making cities more livable (OP4) and tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability (OP3) by improving Khulna\u2019s \nsanitation through climate-resilient sewerage infrastructure; (ii) strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity (OP6) by improving KWASA\u2019s capacity to deliver sewage management \nservices; (iii) accelerating progress in gender equality (OP2) by targeting women in trainings and \nawareness raising; and (iv) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (OP1) by \nproviding employment to poor and vulnerable groups during construction and O&M.18 \n \n8.  Project relevance amid pandemic. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has \nhad a devastating health, social, and economic impact on Bangladesh.19 The economic downturn \nhas seriously affected people\u2019s livelihoods, especially for the poor and vulnerable. ADB estimated \nthat job losses could be as high as 3.7 million in the future, and that 85.1% of the informal \nworkforce  lost  their  livelihoods  as  a  result  of  lockdowns.20 High  population  density,  rapid \nurbanization, a high proportion of the urban population living in slums, and unsanitary conditions \nin cities make the country highly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks. The project is highly \nrelevant to addressing COVID-19 and future pandemics,21 as it will establish a climate-resilient \nsewerage  system,  which  is  essential  for  safe  sanitation  and  hygiene.22 Implementation  of \nbehavior change communication on sanitation will be prioritized for immediate improvement of \nhygienic conditions in Khulna. The project will contribute to creating employment during the \nconstruction and O&M phases, especially for the poor and vulnerable who may have lost jobs \nbecause of COVID-19 impacts. \n \n9.  Lessons. The project will be ADB\u2019s first sewerage intervention in Bangladesh. ADB will \nbring  extensive  experience  and  lessons  from  implementing  infrastructure  development, \ninstitutional  capacity  building,  and  reforms  in  Dhaka,23 other  South  Asian  countries,  and \nelsewhere.24 The key lessons from sewerage system development projects (footnote 24) and the \ncompleted  Khulna  Water  Supply  Project  (footnote  15)  indicate  that  (i)  up-front  capacity \ndevelopment  on  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  accelerates  project  start-up,  (ii)  close \ncoordination  with  relevant  government  departments  and  local  municipalities  facilitates  the \napproval  process,  and  (iii)  integrating  water  supply  or  sewerage  systems  with  available \ninterventions results in improved health benefits. \n \n \n17 ADB. 2016.

The project is aligned with the following impact: basic needs of the people ensured in a \nsustainable manner without damaging the environment (footnote 2). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: project areas in Khulna city gained access to sustainable sewerage services.25 \n \n11.  Output 1: Climate-resilient centralized and organized sewerage system for Khulna \ncity established. The project will support the development of a new sewerage system which will \nbenefit  880,000  people  (150,000  households)  living  in  commercial  and  densely  populated \nresidential areas in Khulna by 2028. The project will establish a centralized sewerage system \nconsisting of a 269-kilometer sewer network, eight pumping stations, two sewage treatment plants \n(STPs) (52,000 m3 per day and 28,000 m3 per day), and about 27,000 property-level sewer \nconnections.26 A fecal sludge treatment plant with the capacity to treat 160 m3 per day will be \nincluded in one of the STPs for co-treatment, to provide fecal sludge treatment service for about \n30,000 of these households in central and southern parts of the city where a piped sewer network \nis not feasible.27 ADB will finance the O&M of the sewer network and pumping stations (for 2 \nyears from commissioning date), and the STPs (for 3 years from commissioning date) by qualified \ncontractors to ensure professional operation in the initial years, and transfer O&M skills to \nKWASA. The project will have an immediate positive impact on the city\u2019s environment, enhance \nits climate and disaster resilience by increasing sewage treatment capacity, provide sanitation \nsolutions for residents in LICs, and open the door to future partnerships with the private sector.28 \n \n12.  Output 2: Institutional capacity of the Khulna Water Supply and Sewerage Authority \nin sewerage service delivery, and community awareness on safe sanitation improved. The \nphysical investments will be complemented by targeted institutional reforms, capacity building, \nand sustainability enhancement, which will build on ongoing reforms of KWASA (footnote 3). To \nensure sustained delivery of sewage management services, the loan consultants will implement \na skills development program for the sewerage system using a facility-specific O&M manual, \nstrengthen asset management by installing a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) \nsystem, formulate a sewerage tariff policy to ensure that O&M costs are adequately financed by \nuser charges, and strengthen the project management capacity of KWASA to monitor contractor \nperformance and safeguard standards.29 To address future needs for water supply and sewage \nmanagement services, the project will support the preparation of potential projects30 and identify \nopportunities for public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). To improve citywide sanitation and hygiene, \nthe project will support the development of a sustainable and inclusive sanitation plan, and KCC \nand  KWASA  will  jointly  conduct public-awareness  campaigns  on the benefits  of  sewerage \nservices.31 The project will also support enhancing women\u2019s decision-making capacity and \n \n25 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n26 The sewer network under the project will be separate from the drainage system and will be connected to existing \ninternal connections (master traps) that link households to property septic tanks. Septic tanks, the primary existing \nsanitation option in the project area, will be permanently decommissioned. Before providing service connection, \nKWASA, supported by loan consultants, will prepare guidelines on decommissioning septic tanks. \n27 KCC will collect and transport fecal sludge from property septic tanks to the treatment plant. The Bill & Melinda Gates \nFoundation is currently providing technical support to KCC to improve the city\u2019s on-site sanitation service delivery. \n28 Inadequate tariffs for cost recovery combined with large up-front investment costs have prevented private investment \nin sewerage in Bangladesh. \n29 Project management capacity development programs for KWASA will be financed by ADB. 2019.

Value Added by ADB  \n \n13.  The project will introduce innovative technologies, mitigate the effects of and strengthen \nresilience to climate change, support citywide inclusive sanitation, and provide holistic support to \nKhulna through the following: \n(i)  Technology and innovation. STPs will operate on a SCADA system with online \nanalyzers for automatic data logging. The sewer network will be geographic \ninformation system (GIS)-mapped with a computerized hydraulic model and will be \nintegrated with the existing GIS for KWASA\u2019s water assets. \n(ii)  Climate mitigation and resilience. The project will support the use of energy-\nefficient pumps and equipment and corrosion-resistant pipes with a low carbon \nfootprint.  Selection  of  construction  materials  will  consider  salinity  levels  in \nproject areas. \n(iii)  Citywide inclusive sanitation. The project will support the establishment of a \ncentralized sewerage system and fecal sludge treatment plant. It will develop an \ninclusive sanitation plan to be jointly prepared by KCC and KWASA. As KCC is \nstrengthening collection and transportation of fecal sludge in areas with no sewer \nnetwork, the project will lead to citywide sanitation improvement. \n(iv)  Holistic support from ADB. This project aligns with KWASA\u2019s 5-year business \nplan (para 6) and follows through the successfully completed Khulna Water Supply \nProject by strengthening KWASA\u2019s capacity to operate and manage a sewerage \nsystem.  \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements  \n \n18.  A project management unit (PMU) will be established in KWASA and will be supported by \nloan consultants on (i) project management and supervision; and (ii) institutional development, \nawareness, and design. \n \n19.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 33). The COVID-19 pandemic is not expected to affect implementation \narrangements and cost estimates because (i) the works under the project are labor intensive, \nrequiring a significant number of unskilled and semiskilled labor, which are available in Khulna;  \n \n34 The maturity premium is based on loan terms and the government\u2019s choice of repayment option and dates. \n35 Mitigation measures include use of energy-efficient equipment, solar power generator to run the STPs, and \ntrenchless technology for installation of sewer pipes. Adaptation measures comprise household sewer connections \nand STPs, awareness generation and capacity-building activities, GIS data mapping and interception, and diversion \nand treatment of wastewater discharge. \n36 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n(ii) the main construction materials are available within the country, limiting dependency on global \nsupply chains; and (iii) the 7-year implementation period and cost estimates provide adequate \ncushion for potential delays. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2020\u2013December 2027 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2027 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2028 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Interministerial project steering committee \nSecretary, LGD under MLGRDC (chair) \nRepresentatives of LGD, Planning Commission and Implementation \nMonitoring and Evaluation Division under the Ministry of Planning, \nEconomic Relations Division and Finance Division under the Ministry \nof Finance, Department of Environment under the Ministry of \nEnvironment and Forest, KCC, and KWASA (members) \n(ii)  Sponsoring ministry  LGD \n(iii) Executing agency  KWASA \n(iv) Key implementing agency  KWASA \n(v)  Implementation unit  Project management unit, 29 staff \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  4 contracts  $195.94 million \n(internationally advertised) \n  Open competitive bidding  3 contracts  $1.25 million \n(nationally advertised)  \n  Request for quotations  1 contract  $0.02 million \nConsulting services  PMSC\u2013QCBS (90:10)  569 person-months  $8.50 million \nIADC\u2013QCBS (90:10)  456 person-months  $7.38 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting will be used to recruit consultants and procure \nadvance contracting  works.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n  \n20.  The technical due diligence included a comprehensive review of the project\u2019s feasibility \nstudies, detailed and/or outline engineering designs, cost estimates, and site investigations. The \nproject will support innovative and high-level technologies, including (i) installation of household \nsewerage connections within property boundaries; (ii) provision of pre-cast segmented manhole \nconstruction to improve the output quality and reduce installation time; (iii) establishment of a \nSCADA system and development of a comprehensive GIS database to improve monitoring and \nfacilitate O&M; (iv) simple but effective means of sewage treatment to absorb fluctuating sewage \nloads, and of semiautomated operations to improve functionality of STPs taking into account local \n ", "8 \ncapacity for implementation and O&M; and (v) installation of a solar power generation system to \nsubstantially cover power costs. The incorporation of FSM into the system will increase the \ncoverage of sanitation services to areas where sewer connections are not feasible or planned. All \nchosen technologies were confirmed after life cycle and least-cost analysis.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n21.  Economic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound, \nas the project will provide more resilient and sustainable urban basic services focusing on \nsewerage system in Khulna. The economic internal rate of return of the project is estimated at \n13.7%, which is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital estimated at 9.0%, indicating \nsignificant economic returns. The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the overall results \nremain satisfactory for all scenarios except for the one combining all downside risks. The project\u2019s \neconomic viability is expected to further increase if unquantifiable benefits such as environmental \nimprovements are included in the analysis.37 \n \n22.  Financial analysis. A financial analysis was conducted for the project in accordance with \nADB guidelines.38 Sewerage tariffs are not collected in Khulna because there are no operational \nsewerage systems, but the government and KWASA have committed to introducing sewerage \ntariffs at the level of water tariffs, with provisions to gradually increase them before O&M of STPs \ncommences.39 The analysis found that revenues generated through the proposed tariffs will be \nsufficient to cover O&M costs in full, but insufficient to cover debt service and interest. Overall, \nthe project is not expected to be financially viable, which categorizes the financial risk of the \nproject as substantial. A cash-flow analysis of KWASA was conducted to assess its capacity to \nabsorb debt service and interest from its own revenues. KWASA can enhance its revenue base \nby (i) setting up desludging charges to treat fecal sludge, (ii) reusing treated wastewater from \nSTPs for commercial and agricultural purposes, (iii) improving tariff collection efficiency, and (iv) \nobtaining additional financial support from the government. ADB will provide continued policy \nadvice  and  capacity  development  under  the  project  to  help  KWASA  enhance  its \nfinancial strength.40 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n23.  The project\u2019s benefits will be sustained over the long term through a combination of project \ninterventions. To ensure operational sustainability, the project will include (i) 2\u20133 years of O&M \nfor sewage conveyance and treatment facilities by experienced and qualified contractors to \nensure  professional  operations  in  the  initial  years,  and  transfer  of  skills  to  KWASA;  (ii) \ndevelopment of a facility-specific O&M manual for sewerage system by contractors to ensure \nefficient O&M beyond the contractor\u2019s O&M period; (iii) installation of a solar power generation \nsystem to partially run the STPs to reduce O&M costs; and (iv) identification of an appropriate \nPPP modality for future water supply and sewerage services in Khulna. Financial sustainability \nwill be enhanced by (i) connecting the sewer network to commercial and densely populated areas \nto ensure high billing and collection efficiency; (ii) providing free sewer connections to poor and \nvulnerable households to increase the number of customers by ensuring that connection fees are \n \n37 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 ADB. 2019.

Governance \n \n24.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  for \nKWASA,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines. 42  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement risk is substantial mainly because (i) the PMU has not yet been established, (ii) \nthere is no designated internal audit officer at KWASA, and (iii) the entity financial statements are \nnot audited annually. These risks will be mitigated by KWASA through (i) assigning a full-time \naccounts officer to the PMU, (ii) providing the PMU with continuous training on ADB\u2019s financial \nmanagement requirements, (iii) improving the quality of project financial reports, (iv) assigning an \nofficer as a focal to develop an internal audit function,  and (v) ensuring that its entity financial \nstatements are audited annually by an independent auditor. Furthermore, loan consultants will \nstrengthen KWASA\u2019s financial management capacity and systems. \n \n25.  Procurement. Procurement of goods and works and recruitment of consultants will \nadhere  to  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Two years \nof O&M for the sewer network and pumping stations and 3 years of O&M for STPs by contractors \nwere selected as offering the best fit for this project. This arrangement will enable private sector \nparticipation in addressing KWASA\u2019s capacity gap for sustainable O&M of the sewerage system, \nand for transferring skills to KWASA. Larger packages were formed to attract more experienced \ncontractors to provide works and international best practices for O&M. The above arrangements \nwill maximize value for money. \n \n26.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and KWASA. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 33). \n \n27.  Integrity due diligence. Integrity due diligence on KWASA was conducted. No significant \nintegrity risks were identified. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  The summary poverty reduction and social strategy describes measures to address social \nimpacts and enhance the distribution of project benefits.43 The project will directly support \nSustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 (access to clean water and sanitation for all) and SDG 5 \n(gender equality), and will indirectly support SDG 1 (reducing poverty). Economic shocks resulting \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to deepen poverty for those who are already poor and \nvulnerable. Pro-poor designs under the project include (i) providing free sewer connections to \nLICs, (ii) improving sanitation services in slums by establishing a fecal sludge treatment plant, \nand (iii) conducting awareness campaigns on sanitation and hygiene for LICs. Additionally, the \npoor will benefit from short-term employment opportunities in the construction of the sewer \nnetwork and STPs. \n \n41 KWASA will identify the poor and vulnerable groups to be connected to sewer network free-of-charge during the \nconstruction period based on the latest data. \n42 ADB. 2015.

The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  KWASA  has\ndeveloped a GAP and corresponding GAP implementation budget (footnote 32). Based on\n \nlessons from the Khulna Water Supply Project, the project will adopt good practices that directly\nbenefit destitute women through employment generation and skills development. For instance,\nthe project will use construction techniques that enable women to comprise at least 20% of\nunskilled and semiskilled workers. The project will enhance women\u2019s decision-making capacity\nand reduce gender inequality by ensuring 30% female participation in consultations on project\nbenefits, construction, sewer connections, and land acquisition and resettlement. The same level\nof female participation will be ensured in awareness-raising programs on water, sanitation, and\nsewerage management. The PMU will monitor the implementation of the GAP and prepare\nquarterly progress reports.\nF. Safeguards\n30. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard\ncategories are as follows.44\n31. Environment (category B). KWASA has prepared an initial environmental examination\n(IEE) report for the project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements\nand the applicable laws of the government. The project is composed of two packages for the\nsewer network and one package for two STPs, which will comprise an integrated sewage\ncollection, conveyance, and treatment system for Khulna. Three environmental management\nplans (EMPs), corresponding to the three packages, were also prepared and included in the IEE.\nBased on the IEE, no significant adverse impacts are envisioned under the project. The potential\nimpacts are site-specific, few are irreversible, and most can be readily mitigated and minimized\nusing  proven mitigation measures consistent with  internationally recognized  best  practices.\nStakeholders were involved through meaningful consultations and their views were incorporated\ninto the IEE and project designs. The meaningful consultation process will continue during project\nimplementation. The IEE and EMPs will be (i) updated based on detailed engineering designs, (ii)\nincluded as part of the bid and contract documents, and (iii) disclosed on the ADB and project\nwebsites. No contract will be awarded until ADB approves the updated or final IEE and EMPs.\nPrior to execution of civil works, contractors will prepare site-specific EMPs, which will be\napproved by KWASA. All statutory clearances and no-objections must be obtained prior to the\nstart of construction activities. The project includes a program to strengthen the capacity of\nKWASA. Loan consultants will enhance KWASA\u2019s capacity to manage environmental impacts\nthat  arise  during  project  implementation.  Grievances  will  be  handled  following  the  project\ngrievance redress mechanism, as stated in the PAM. During project implementation KWASA will\nalso prepare semiannual environmental monitoring reports for ADB to review and disclose on the\nADB and project websites.\n32. Involuntary resettlement (category B). KWASA has prepared a draft resettlement plan\nin line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements and the applicable laws of the\ngovernment, based on which it is assessed that the project would cause the following impacts: (i)\nphysical displacement of 24 affected households (108 family members) because of loss of\nresidential structures; (ii) economic displacement of 8 households (36 family members); (iii) loss\nof private land (35.53 acres) for 210 landowners (945 persons), 95% of whom (200 landowners,\n900 family members) are projected to lose less than 10% of their total landholdings, while the\nremaining 5% (10 landowners, 45 family members) are projected to lose more than 10% of their\n44 ADB. Safeguard Categories. ", "11 \nlandholdings, but which will not be their primary livelihood source; and (iv) temporary economic \nimpacts  during  construction.  The  measures  in  the  draft  resettlement  plan  and  monitoring \narrangements are adequate for mitigating the identified risks. The resettlement plan will form part \nof the contract documents, will be updated based on detailed measurement and surveys, and will \nbe submitted to ADB for review prior to contract award. The draft and the updated resettlement \nplans will be disclosed to affected people, and on the ADB and project websites. KWASA \ndemonstrated during the Khulna Water Supply Project that it has the capacity to manage social \nsafeguards. For that project, KWASA implemented a category A resettlement plan and met ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement requirements. Drawing on lessons from that project, this project has \ninitiated early land acquisition.45 Institutional arrangements for social safeguards at the PMU will \nbe in place, and a property valuation advisory committee and grievance redress committee will \nbe  constituted  prior  to  award  of  the  first  contract  to  ensure  timely  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan. Loan consultants will support KWASA in enhancing its capacity to manage \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts. KWASA will prepare and disclose semiannual social monitoring \nreports during project implementation. \n33. Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples impact, involving direct or\nindirect impacts to the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or territories or natural or cultural\nresources that are used, owned, occupied, or claimed by indigenous peoples as their ancestral\ndomain or asset, is anticipated. Census data of 2011 published by the Bangladesh Bureau of\nStatistics does not report the presence of any small ethnic minorities in Khulna city area. No\npopulation or population group in the project impact zone qualifies as indigenous peoples as per\nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. None of the affected persons surveyed belongs to small\nethnic communities. No component with any adverse impact on small ethnic communities will be\nincluded in the project.\nG. Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan\n34. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in\ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.46\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nKWASA\u2019s lack of experience  Civil works contracts will include 2\u20133 years of O&M for sewer network and STPs to \nin managing sewerage  ensure professional operation in the initial years, and to transfer O&M skills to \nsystems results in  KWASA. A facility-specific O&M manual will also be developed by contractors to \ninadequate O&M of assets  ensure efficient O&M beyond the contractor\u2019s O&M period. Loan consultants will \nalso strengthen capacity of KWASA to handle O&M of sewerage system. \nIneffective collection and  KCC, as a member of the project steering committee, will confirm its support for \ntransport of fecal sludge by  the project through a written commitment, focusing on fully utilizing a fecal sludge \nKCC lead to lower  treatment plant and relevant approvals on implementation.

Progress is at an advanced stage for the two STPs. The government and \ntimely project  KWASA are committed to timely transfer of funds to the deputy commissioner\u2019s \nimplementation  account to compensate owners for land required for the project. KWASA will \nensure that the resettlement plan is updated before the first contract is awarded. \nADB will provide an independent monitor to mitigate this risk. \n45 Compensation against land and resettlement impacts has yet to be paid and no physical or economic displacement \nhas taken place at project sites. The property valuation advisory committee will propose any top-up payment required \nover and above the cash compensation under the law to ensure compensation at replacement cost. \n46 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS\n35. The government and KWASA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall\nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures,\nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement\nas described in detail in the PAM and loan documents.\n36. The government and KWASA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project,\nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreements and project agreement.\n37. As  conditions  to  loan  effectiveness,  the  government  has  to  submit  to  ADB  a  draft\nsubsidiary loan agreement, in form and substance acceptable to ADB.\nV. RECOMMENDATION\n38. I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve\n(i) the loan of $50,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Khulna\nSewerage System Development Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in\nregular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London\ninterbank  offered rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  25  years,\nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are\nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project\nagreements  presented to the Board; and\n(ii) the loan of $110,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Khulna\nSewerage System Development Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in\nconcessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2.0% per year during the\ngrace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5\nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with\nthose set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board.\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n7 September 2020 ", "Appendix 1  13 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nBasic needs of the people ensured in a sustainable manner without damaging the environment \n(Perspective Plan of Bangladesh 2010\u20132021: Making Vision 2021 a Reality)a \nData Sources \nPerformance Indicators with Targets and  and Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2028: \nProject areas in  a.Service coverage of sewage collection and a.\u2013c.
