With the aim of transforming Indonesia into a developed \n3. \ncountry  by  2025,  the  government  in  May  2011  launched  a  14-year  master  plan  to  accelerate \neconomic  development  throughout  the  archipelago. 3  Infrastructure  development,  including \npower infrastructure, is essential in supporting national connectivity required in the development \nactivities of all the sectors identified in the above master plan, hence infrastructure development \nis  a  key  component  of  Indonesia's  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  2010\u20132014 \n(RPJMN).4   \n \nPower  sector  assessment. Peak power demand in Indonesia averaged 30,000 MW in \n4. \n2012  and  is  expected  to  grow  at  an  average  rate  of  9.4%  annually  up  to  2021.5 The  current \naverage electrification ratio is about 72% in Indonesia, and the government's target is to achieve \n90%  electrification  by  2020.  Power  shortage  has  been  a  critical  infrastructure  bottleneck \nthroughout the  country  and fast-track generation programs  are being  implemented  to  increase \nthe power generation capacity.6 In addition, transmission and distribution systems have limited \ncapacities  to  transmit  additional  power  because  of  inadequate  investments  in  the  past. \nTherefore,  the  transmission  and  distribution  networks  need  to  be  developed  in  a  coordinated \nmanner to realize the benefits of the new generation capacities and to achieve the government\u2019s \nelectrification targets. \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2   ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Jakarta. \n6    In  2006,  the  government  launched  an  accelerated  coal-based  power  development  program  to  reduce  the \ndependency  on  expensive  oil-based  generation.  The  program  aimed  at  adding  10,000  MW  of  new  generation \ncapacity by 2010. Nearly 70% of this target was largely achieved and completion is expected in 2014. A second \naccelerated  program  was  launched  in 2009  for  adding  an additional 10,000  MW of  generation capacity  by  2018. \nThis program foresees 60% of the generation from renewable energy sources, mainly geothermal and hydro.   \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nBali  power  supply  situation.  Bali  is  Indonesia's  top  tourism  showpiece. 7  The \n5. \ncommercial  sector  accounts  for  about  46%  of  the  total  energy  consumption  in  Bali,  which \nincludes  the  hotel  industry  and  associated  services.  However,  the  Bali  power  system  suffers \nfrom  frequent  outages  and  blackouts  due  to  low  generation  reserve  margin  and  transmission \nbottlenecks. The peak demand in Bali in 2012 was 618 MW and supply capacity was 633 MW, \nresulting  in  a  generation  reserve  margin  of  only  15  MW  (2.4%).  The  demand  is  projected  to \ngrow at an average rate of 9.6% per year during 2012\u25002022 and expected to reach 1,619 MW \nby 2022. The Java\u2013Bali power system is linked by two existing 150 kV undersea cables with a \ntotal  capacity  of  200  MW.  In  addition,  two  150  kV  undersea  cables  are  being  installed  by  the \nState Electricity Company (PLN),8 to add another 200 MW by 2014. There are 526 MW of diesel \npower generators operating in Bali that will be eventually phased out due to (i) a policy decision \nby  the  Bali  provincial  government  to  reduce  carbon  dioxide  emissions  and  minimize  noise \npollution  in  Bali;  and  (ii)  the  phasing  out  of  diesel-based generation  by  PLN  because  they  are \nsignificantly more expensive to operate than other forms of generation. Therefore, investments \nare  required  to  augment  the  power  system  in  Bali  by  strengthening  the  transmission  capacity \nfrom Java to Bali and install more economical, less polluting generating plants in Bali itself.  \n \n6. \nTechnically  and  economically  feasible  development  option. Transmission of power \nfrom  East  Java  to  Bali  at  500 kV  has  been  determined  as  the  optimal  solution  to  improve  the \npower supply in Bali based on the power system studies carried out in the preparation of least-\ncost  generation  expansion  plan  and  long-term  transmission  development  plan. Therefore,  this \nproject is included in PLN\u2019s power supply business plan (footnote 5). As the power demand in \nBali  is  only  about  2.5% of  the total  demand  of  the  Java\u2013Bali  power grid,  coupling  it  with more \nefficient generation capacity in Java, transmitting power from Java would be a more technically \nand  economically  feasible  option  before  installing  new  generation  plants  in  Bali.  Accordingly, \nPLN has conducted the initial design of a 500 kV double circuit overhead transmission line from \nJava  to  Bali,  with  a  total  transmission  capacity  of  3,600  megavolt-amperes  (MVA)  with  power \ncapacity  of  3,000  MW  to  be  operational  by  2016. 9  The  project  will  alleviate  the  imminent \nshortage  of  power  supply  capacity  in  Bali.  The  project  is  also  included  in  the  government\u2019s \nGreen Book 2013, which lists planned priority external loans.10 \n \n7. \nProject relevance. The project will contribute to long-term power supply security in Bali \nand  ensure  the  provision  of  adequate  and  reliable  power  supply  that  is  vital  for  economic \ndevelopment activities identified in Bali under the Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of \nIndonesia Economic Development  (MP3EI)  (footnote  3). The  project  will  strengthen the  power \ntransmission  system  by  connecting  Bali  with  a  500  kV  link  to  Java\u2013Bali  grid,  thus  facilitating \nefficient  utilization  of  existing  and  planned  large  power  generation  plants  in  Java.  Hence,  the \nproject  will  enable  transmitting  comparatively  cheaper  power  to  Bali.  Currently,  PLN  relies \nmainly  on  expensive  diesel-based  generation  to  supply  electricity  in  Bali.  The  proposed \ntransmission  line  will  reduce  operational  expenditures,  which  will  also  reduce  the  subsidy \npayments  made  to  PLN  by  the  government.  PLN\u2019s  investment  in  the  project  is  also  part  of  its \nnationwide  plan  to  increase  electrification.11 The  development  of  the  150/20  kV  substations \n\n                                                \n7   Bali  is  an  internationally  renowned  tourist  and  cultural  destination  that  contributes  6%  of  the  national  gross \ndomestic product. Tourism generates 67% of  Bali's gross regional domestic product, and about 70% of residents \nare directly or indirectly dependent on the tourism industry. \n\n8   PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listrik Negara.  \n9  Technical losses are less in 500 kV transmission lines and power transfer capacity is higher compared to 150 kV \n\nand 275 kV transmission lines, which are the standard high voltage transmission voltages in Indonesia. \n\n10 National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  2013.  Daftar  Rencana  Prioritas  Pinjaman  (Green  Book) \n\n2013. Jakarta. \n\n11 The electrification ratio in Bali in 2012 was 69%; the government aims to achieve 90% electrification by 2020. \n\n \n\n\funder  the  project  along  the  proposed  route  of  the  transmission  line  also  ensures  improved \naccess to electricity to the local rural communities in the project area. \n \n8. \nADB  energy  sector  strategy.  The  development  of  power  infrastructure  required  to \nrelieve  power  supply  constraints  and  regional  transmission  interconnection  projects  are  an \nintegral  part  of    ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  to  reduce  the  overall  generation  reserve \nrequirements, improve system stability and reliability, and enable transmission of comparatively \ncheaper  power  from  one  area  to  another.12 In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  project  will \nensure  strict  compliance  in  the  implementation  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards \nrequirements in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project is well \naligned  to  ADB\u2019s  present  energy  sector  strategy  and  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014  and  country  operations  business  plan,  2013\u20132014  for \nIndonesia.13  \n \n9. \nADB\u2019s  continued  support  in  the  energy  sector  and  experience.  To date,  ADB has \nfinanced 30 projects in Indonesia totaling about $3.3 billion and 36 technical assistance projects \ntotaling  about  $14  million  focusing  on  power  generation  and  transmission  subsectors.  In  the \ntransmission subsector, ADB is also providing strategic public\u2013private financing for strengthening \nthe  West  Kalimantan  power  grid  to  facilitate  power  trade  with  Sarawak,  Malaysia. 14 \nFurthermore,  development  of  renewable  energy,  particularly  hydro  and  geothermal  and  the \nSumatra\u2013Peninsular  Malaysia  500  kV  undersea  interconnection  is  currently  under  discussion. \nThe ADB\u2019s portfolio and sector work is well coordinated  among other development partners  in \nIndonesia.15 Based  on  the  lessons  learned,  to  mitigate  the  project  delays,  the  project  design \nwas  enhanced  incorporating  advance  contracting;  efficient  procurement  procedures;  project \nimplementation consultants; and on-the-job training for the PLN staff in project implementation, \nand preparing and implementing safeguard measures effectively. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  long-term  power  supply  security  to  support  sustained \nsocioeconomic growth  in  Bali. The  outcome  will  be  increased  capacity  of  the  Java\u2013Bali  power \ntransmission network. \n  \nC. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe    project  has  three  outputs:  (i)  development  of  220  km  of  500  kV  transmission \nnetwork  between  Java  and  Bali  (a  new  double  circuit  transmission  line,  which  includes  the \nfollowing subcomponents:  131 km line between the Paiton substation and Watudodol in Java, 4 \nkm  line  across  the  Bali  Strait  between  Watudodol  and  Segara  Rupek,  10  km  line  between \nSegara  Rupek  and  Gilimanuk,  and  75  km  line  between  Gilimanuk  and  Antosari);  (ii) \ndevelopment  of  500/150  kV  and  150/20  kV  substations  in  Java  and  Bali  (the  extension  of  the \nexisting  500  kV  Paiton  substation  in  East  Java,  the  construction  of  a  new  500/150  kV,  2x500 \nMVA capacity substation at Antosari in Bali, and the upgrading of eleven 150/20 kV substations \nwith  600  MVA  additional  capacity);  and  (iii)  support  project  management  (construction \nsupervision, supervision and monitoring of safeguards, and capacity building). \n\n                                                \n12 Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13  ADB.  2012.

Wien \nAutomatic  System  Planning  was  the  software  used  for  the  least-cost  generation  expansion \nstudies  and  Power  System  Simulator  for  Engineering  was  used  for  the  transmission  system \nstudies.18  \n \n18. \nDue  diligence  during  project  preparation  have  confirmed  adequate  project  design. \nExhaustive  engineering  design  and  power  system  calculations  ensure  robust  and  optimal \ntransmission  network  development  based  on  internationally  proven  extra  high  voltage \nalternating current transmission technology. Technical due diligence covers the overall project, \nincluding  the  4  km  overhead  crossing  across  the  Bali  Strait,  which  confirms  the  overhead \ntransmission  line  crossing  to  be  the  preferred  option  than  undersea  cable  option  due  to  the \ntechnical  risks,  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  higher  costs  involved  with  undersea \ncables and their installation. Technical design of this transmission crossing will involve two towers \neach with a height of about 376 meters, making them marginally the world\u2019s tallest power pylons. \nThere exist other similar transmission line crossings that use high towers with proven technology.19 \nThe project\u2019s technical concept and design meet international standards. \n \nB. \n \n19. \nFinancial viability was assessed by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of the \nproject. The incremental benefits were calculated based on PLN\u2019s revenue stream from power \nsales  while  costs  include  capital  investments,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  taxes \nincurred  to  install  and  operate  the  project.  The  post-tax  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  the \nproject is 10.5%, which compares favorably with the estimated weighted average cost of capital \nof 2.5%, confirming the project\u2019s financial viability.20 ADB reviewed PLN\u2019s financial performance \nand  projections,  including  its  capacity  to finance  its  investment  needs  and  the  adequacy  of  its \ncapital structure to meet its debt service requirements.21 \n \n20. \nThe economic analysis confirms that the project is economically beneficial. The analysis \nyields an  economic  internal  rate of  return  of 25.5%  and the  sensitivity  analyses  show  that  this \nexpected economic performance is robust.22 The economic internal rate of return compares the \nannual  streams  of  economic  capital  and  operating  costs  against  incremental  benefits  and \nresource  savings  due  to  displacement  of  the  expensive  diesel-based  power  being  supplied  at \npresent. All costs, benefits, and revenues are expressed in 2013 constant prices. The analysis \nperiod includes the construction period of 4 years in addition to 25 years of operation.  \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n18 Both are state-of-the art software commonly used by many power utilities across the world. \n19 Zhoushan Island Overhead Power line (370 meters), People\u2019s Republic of China; Jiangyin Crossing (346 meters), \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China;  Nanjing  Crossing  (257  meters),  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China;  Orinoco  Crossing  (240 \nmeters), Venezuela; Elbe Crossing (227 meters), Germany; Chusi Crossing (226 meters), Japan;  Osaki Channel \nCrossing (223 meters), Japan; and Suez Canal Crossing (221 meters), Egypt. \n20 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n21 Financial Performance and Projections of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2).  \n\n22 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government  and  PLN. The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \n22. \nTo ensure transparency and good governance, PLN will publicly disclose information on \nhow  loan  proceeds  are  being  used  on  its  website.  For  each  procurement  contract,  PLN  will \ndisclose (i) the list of participating bidders, (ii) the name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details \non bidding procedures adopted, (iv) the amount of the contract awarded, (v) a list of goods and \nservices  purchased,  and  (vi)  the  intended  and  actual  utilization  of  loan  proceeds.  ADB  will \norganize  special  training  for  PLN  staff  on  ADB  procedures,  including  implementation, \nprocurement,  use  of  consultants,  disbursement,  reporting,  monitoring,  and  prevention  of  fraud \nand  corruption.  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  project  will  be  subject  to \nprior ADB approval and will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine \nthe  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agency,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the project.   \n \nD. \n \nThe  poverty  and  social  analysis  assessed  impacts  at  the  sector  level,  since  identifying \n23. \nspecific consumers is challenging in the context of transmission network expansion. The project \nwill  benefit  poor  households  in  the  rural  areas  of  Bali  and  Java  when  the  government\u2019s  rural \nelectrification  program  is  implemented.  The  current  electrification  ratio  in  Bali  is  69%.  The \nproject area is located in East Java and in Bali  while the project\u2019s main beneficiary area is Bali. \nThe  project  will  ensure  adequate  and  reliable  power  supply  that  will  enable  industrial  and \ncommercial  growth,  especially  in  the  tourism  industry,  and  increased  trading  activities  that \ncreate  jobs  especially  for  low  income  groups. 23  Basic  public  services,  including  education, \nhealth,  and  water  supply,  will  improve  because  of  increased  access  to electricity.24 The  social \nimpact  assessment  carried  out  in  June  2011  indicates  that  the  project  will  benefit  the  entire \npopulation of 4 million people in Bali. Nearly 20% of the total beneficiary population is below the \nnational poverty line. Further, an estimated 2.6 million foreign tourists and floating population in \nBali will also benefit from reliable power supply.   \n \n24. \nTransmission  projects  are,  by  their  nature,  unlikely  to  provide  opportunities  to \nincorporate gender elements into their design, but there will be direct and substantial benefits to \nwomen  from  improved  energy  supply.  The  project  preparatory  due  diligence  did  not  highlight \nspecific gender issues, although the project will benefit women and does not have any adverse \nimpacts  or  widen  the  gender  inequality.  The  benefits  from  electricity  will  accrue  largely  in  the \nform  of  labor  savings,  enhanced  social  interaction,  and  broadened  options  for  work  and  other \nactivities.  The  resettlement  plans  for  the  project  include  specific  actions  to  ensure  women  are \nincluded  effectively  in  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  process  (e.g.,  female-headed \nhouseholds and poor women).25  \n \n\n                                                \n23 Bali  is  the  largest  tourist  destination  in  the  country  and  is  renowned  for  its  highly  developed  small-scale  private \nenterprises  that  encompass  activities  such  as  art,  music,  dance,  sculpture,  painting,  leather,  and  metalworking. \nThe availability of reliable power supply in Bali will help these small-scale private enterprises create additional job \nopportunities. \n\n24 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe risk  of  spreading  HIV  due to the project  is  very  low.  Nevertheless,  to address  any \n25. \nthreats  during  project  implementation,  information  dissemination campaigns will  be  carried  out \nin the project areas, which will be supervised by independent monitoring consultants. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  \u201cA\u201d  due  to  some \nsections  of  the  proposed  alignment  passing  through  two  national  parks.  An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  has  been  undertaken  covering  all  project  components,  including \nfacilities  funded  by  PLN  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). 26 \nRelevant Indonesian environmental policies, regulations, and guidelines were also considered in \nthe  EIA.  The  draft  EIA  report  was  uploaded  for  public  disclosure  on  the  ADB  website  on  13 \nAugust 2012 and updated with a supplementary biodiversity study in June 2013. In accordance \nwith  the  government\u2019s  project  readiness  criteria,  PLN  prepared  a  separate  EIA  (Analisis \nMengenai  Dampak  Lingkungan),  which  was  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment  on  16 \nApril 2013. \n \n27. \nDue consideration has been given to minimize environmental impacts in the selection of \nthe interconnection options and the selection of the final alignment of the transmission line and \nsites for substations. The most environmentally sensitive aspects of the project are the sections \nof  the  alignment  through  Baluran  National  Park  in  Java  and  Bali  Barat  National  Park.  In  the \nBaluran National Park, the alignment will pass through 63 hectares (ha) of wilderness zone and \nspecial  utilization  zone.  This  includes  a  modified  area  of  teak  plantation  that  functions  as  a \nseasonal  wildlife  corridor  for  a  small  population  of  endangered  banteng  (Bos  javanicus). 27 \nApproximately  12  km  of  the  alignment  will  pass  through  the  wilderness  zone  of  Bali  Barat \nNational Park. The park\u2019s wilderness zone includes several endangered species, but as per the \nEIA, the presence of wildlife other than birds is rare along the transmission line corridor and in \nthe vicinity. While Gilimanuk Bay may provide seasonal habitat for migratory birds, survey and \nexpert consultants indicated that there are no records of migratory birds in the bay. \n \n28. \nA  comprehensive  package  of  environmental  mitigation  and  offset  measures  has  been \ndesigned  to  support  biodiversity  conservation  in  the  two  national  parks.  Specifically,  the  EMP \nincludes  measures  to  (i)  avoid  negative  impacts  to  sensitive  wildlife  species  through  careful \nscheduling  of construction  timing  and poaching prevention;  (ii)  minimize  vegetation  clearing to \ntransmission line foundations, with limited or no clearing along the project right-of-way; and (iii) \noffset vegetation clearing through targeted restoration actions and the management of invasive \nspecies.  In  addition,  PLN  will  provide  financial  resources  to  the  two  national  parks  through \ncollaborative  agreements,  which  will  include  (i)  captive  breeding  programs,  release,  and \nmonitoring in the wild; (ii) habitat monitoring and restoration in the transmission line right-of-way \narea; (iii) control of invasive species; (iv) compensation planting; and (v) provision of new water \nsources that are supportive of the parks\u2019 management plans.   \n \n29. \nA  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  developed  to  receive  affected  persons \nconcerns  about  the  project\u2019s  environmental  performance  and  facilitate  resolution.  While  PLN \nhas  extensive  experience  in  transmission  line  construction  and  operation  in  Indonesia,  its \nproject management unit, contractors, and park authorities will be trained on all aspects of the \nEMP,  including  mitigation  requirements,  health  and  safety  requirements,  and  monitoring.

Regular implementation \nprogress  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB.  In  the  event  of  any  change  of  alignment  or  the \nidentification  of  unanticipated  environmental  impact  during  project  implementation,  PLN  will \nrevise the EMP. To assist PLN, project implementation consultants will be engaged. In addition, \nindependent safeguards monitoring consultants will also be engaged for independent monitoring \nof  the  implementation  of  the  EMP.  Comprehensive  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants, \nincluding  biodiversity  experts,  are  indicated  in  the  PAM  (footnote  17).  Further,  ADB  will \nimplement a small-scale technical assistance to provide long-term conservation benefits through \nstrengthening of operational management, monitoring, and capacity of the park authorities. \n \n30. \nInvoluntary  resettlement. No physical relocation of houses will be required as a result \nof the project. There are no houses or structures that will be totally or partially demolished due \nto  the  project  except  several  boundary  walls.  A  total  of  717  ha  of  land  will  be  affected  by  the \nproject  (56  ha  of  permanent  acquisition  and  661  ha  of  restricted  land  use  under  the  right-of-\nway), comprising 172 ha of forestry land and 545 ha of private or company land. A total of 1,200 \nhouseholds  (about  4,000  people)  will  be  affected  by  the  project,  of  which  305  affected \nhouseholds are considered vulnerable, including 143 severely affected households (about 472 \npeople).  \n \n31. \nThe project\u2019s involuntary resettlement category is \u201cA\u201d as the number of severely affected \npeople  exceeds  200.  A  detailed  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in \nconsultation  with  the  affected  people  in  2012  and  an  updated  plan  was  disclosed  on  ADB \nwebsite on 11 November 2013. In accordance with the land acquisition and resettlement plan, \npeople who are displaced will be given compensation at full replacement cost for their affected \nassets, including crop compensation for the land at the tower locations. The project authorities \nwill arrange training for the displaced people, including specific programs for skills development \nrequired  in  restoration  activities  that  may  be  implemented  in  conjunction  with  nongovernment \norganizations. All relevant information regarding the project was disseminated and the opinions \nof the displaced persons were taken into consideration in developing the entitlement matrix. No \nindigenous people will be affected by the project.  \n \nF. \n \n32. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the risks. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.28 \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nProject implementation delays due \nto issues in land acquisition and \nresettlement. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nPLN has identified the land acquisition requirements for the transmission line \nhas put in place a comprehensive LARP in compliance with Asian Development \nBanks\u2019 safeguards policy statement. The LARP will be updated during detailed \ndesign phase with participation and consultation of all affected people. \nImplementation of LARP will start before the awarding of contracts. Capacity \nbuilding of PLN staff will be conducted and project implementation consultants \nwill be tasked to assist PLN in the implementation of LARP. \nAdvanced procurement actions and retroactive financing will help mitigate the \nrisk of procurement delays. Project implementation consultants will be recruited \nto assist the executing agency in contract management and issue resolution. \n\nProject implementation delays \nowing to procurement delays and \ncontractual issues.  \nLARP = land acquisition and resettlement plan, PLN = Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Company) \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n33. \nThe  government  and  PLN  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n34. \nThe  government  and  PLN  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreements (A-Loan agreement and B-Loan agreement) and the \nproject agreement. \n \n35. \nThe  following  conditions  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  A-Loan  are  set  forth  in  the  A-Loan \nagreement: (i) the subsidiary loan agreement relating to the proceeds of the A-Loan has been \nexecuted by the government and PLN and has become effective; and (ii) the B-Loan agreement \nhas been executed and has become effective.
