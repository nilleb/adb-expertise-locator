It \nconsists of (i) a program cluster for the FMPARP of $105 million; \n(ii)  a  program  loan  of  $48  million  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Special  Funds  resources  for  fiscal  management \nand  public  administration  policy  reforms  for  subprogram  1  (the \nProgram);  and  (iii)  a  grant  for  Capacity  Building  for  Institutional \nDevelopment  (the  Project  or  Grant)  of  $7  million  to  support \ntargeted interventions to implement the Program. \n \nTargeting Classification: General intervention \nSector: Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector: Public finance and expenditure management \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, governance  \nSubthemes: Promoting macroeconomic stability, financial and \neconomic governance \n \nCategory C \n\n \nThe Government is in the midst of finalizing its interim Afghanistan \nnational  development  strategy  (I-ANDS).  A  major  focus  of  this \nwork is laying the foundations for sound institutions and effective \npolicies  to  support  the  implementation  of  a  sustainable  medium-\nterm development framework. \n  \nTwo key reform initiatives will be strengthening fiscal reforms and \nestablishing  and  implementing  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework \nfor  a  new  civil  service.  Strengthening  fiscal  reforms\u2014including \nimproving revenue collection, establishing medium-term fiscal and \nbudgeting  frameworks,  and  developing  a  public  expenditure \nmanagement  system\u2014is  essential  to  strengthen  the  budget  so  it \ncan  become  the  central  instrument  of  policy  making.  The  ANDS \nneeds  to  be  linked  to  the  public  investment  program  (PIP)  if  the \nGovernment\u2019s  development  priorities  are \nto  be  achieved. \nEstablishing  and  implementing  a  legislative  and  administrative \nframework,  including  reforming  and  restructuring  key  agencies, \ndeveloping  human  resource  management,  and  determining  the  \nstructure  for  a  new  pay  and  grading  system\u2014will  enhance  the \nabsorptive capacity of the civil service. \n \nThese reforms will help to address the current situation where (i) a \nlarge  proportion  of  the  external  budget  is  funded  directly  by \ndonors and executed beyond Government budgetary controls and \n(ii)  weak  Government  capacity \nto  a  more \nGovernment-owned budget linked to policy priorities, including the \n\nis  an  obstacle \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nto \n\nthem \n\nimprove \n\nto  channel  more \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  overall \n\nachievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs). \nStrengthening  fiscal  management  will  mean  more  resources  will \nbe  available  for  key  public  goods  such  as  education  and  health, \nwhich will benefit poverty reduction.  \n \nMeasures \nfinancial \nmanagement accountability framework, including strengthening of \nfiduciary controls, will help reduce corruption and the diversion of \nresources from intended recipients. This will reassure donors and \nencourage \nthe \nGovernment budget.  \n   \nSubprogram 1 will develop systems and procedures to strengthen \nfiscal  management  and  public  administration.  These  measures \nwill complement the integrated government financial management \ninformation  system  (IGFMIS)  to  be  financed  by  the  World  Bank. \nSubprogram 2 will build on these reforms and focus on improving \nprovision  and  delivery  of  public  goods  and  services  in  order  to \nachieve \nthe  country\u2019s  social  development  objectives\u2014as \nentrenched in the MDGs. \n \nFMPARP  subprogram  1  is  to  be  completed  by  December  2008. \nSubprogram 2 is expected to be completed by December 2011. \n \n\nresources \n\nthrough \n\n \nEstimated FMPARP \nCompletion Date \n \nProgram Loan Objectives  The Program will develop systems and procedures\u2014supported by \nincreased  capacity\u2014to  improve  budget  programming,  strengthen \nresource mobilization, develop the civil service, and enhance the \nmonitoring of public finances.  \n \nIt  will  strengthen  (i)  the  budgeting  framework,  (ii)  the  public \ninvestment  program,  (iii)  revenue  mobilization,  (iv)  civil  service \nmanagement,  (v)  the  functioning  of  provincial  administrations, \n(vi) the  transparency  and  accountability  of  public  finances,  and \n(vii) treasury management. \n \nA  loan  of  $48  million  from  the  Special  Funds  resources  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  40-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the repayment period and \nsuch other conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The \ntotal amount of the interest charge during the grace period will be \ncapitalized and charged to the loan account. \n \nSubprogram  2,  which  will  be  presented  separately \nfor \nconsideration  and  approval  by  the  Board  and  will  depend  on \nprogress with subprogram 1, is expected to require a loan of $50 \nmillion  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  Subprogram  2  is \nexpected  to  be  implemented  from  December  2008  to  December \n2011.  \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiii \n\nThe  Program  period  will  be  3  years,  from  December  2005  to \nDecember 2008. The loan will be released in two equal tranches \nof  $24 million  each.  The  first  tranche  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness  or  shortly  thereafter,  upon  compliance  with  first \ntranche  release  conditions.  The  second  is  expected  to  be \nreleased  within  24  months  of  the  release  of  the  first  tranche, \nsubject to compliance with second tranche release conditions.  \n \nDecember 2011 \n\nthe \n\nto  ensure \n\nreforms  are  being \n\n \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  of  the  Program  loan  will  be  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF).  MOF  will  set  up  an  interagency \nimplementation and coordination committee (IICC) headed by the \nDeputy  Minister  of  Finance-Budget  and  Treasury  Management \nand  comprising  representatives  from  the  Budget  Department, \nTreasury  Department,  fiscal  policy  unit,  Revenue  Department, \nCustoms  Department,  Public  Enterprises  Department,  and \nIndependent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission \n(IARCSC).  Heads  of  Moustufiats  of  major  provinces  (provincial \noffices at the MOF responsible for revenue collection and carrying \nout  treasury  functions)  shall  be  co-opted  as  a  member  as  and \nwhen necessary. ADB will be invited to attend the IICC meetings \non a \u201cas needs basis\u201d when relevant issues are to be discussed. \nRegular reporting of minutes of IICC will be provided to ADB. The \nIICC  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  to  monitor  and  coordinate  the \nFMPARP \nimplemented \neffectively. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member \ncountries,  excluding  ineligible  items,  and  imports  financed  by \nother  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of \nthe  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Government  as  the  Borrower. \nThe  Government  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports \nexceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the \nloan for the given period. It is expected that the loan proceeds will \nbe  utilized  over  a  period  of  36  months  from  the  date  of  loan \neffectiveness. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s \ncertification.  Loan  proceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible \nimports for which expenditures were incurred 180 days before the \nloan becomes effective. \n \nCounterpart  funds  generated  from  the  loan  will  be  used  to  meet \nProgram expenditures and associated costs.  \n \n\nPeriod and Tranching \n\nEstimated Program \nCluster Completion Date \n \nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nGrant Objectives \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nSubprogram 1 Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\nthe  moustufiats; \n\nthe  capacity  of \n\nThe grant will support capacity building of the MOF, IARCSC, and \npriority  ministries.

The  grant  will  be subject  to  conditions  set  forth in  the \ndraft grant agreement. \n \nMOF and IARCSC will oversee and coordinate the implementation \nof  the  Project  through  delegation  to  (i)  the  IICC,  and  (ii)  the \nprogram  director  (a  domestic  consultant)  who  will  work  with \ndesignated  department  coordinators  and  who  will  report  to  the \nDeputy Minister of Finance-Budget and Treasury Management. \n \nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants.  A  total  of  172  person-months  of \ninternational  and  300  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \ninputs will be required. The quality-based selection (QBS) method \nwill be used to select consultants for specific components.   \n \nSubprogram 1 will improve the capacity of the MOF, IARCSC, and \nmoustufiats  to  (i)  collect  revenues  efficiently,  (ii)  direct  public \nresources  effectively  to  meet  priority  needs,  and  (iii)  monitor  the \nflow of resources and evaluate the impact of public spending.  \n \nfiscal  management  and  public \nSubprogram  1  will  support \nadministration reforms that will enable the country to manage the \ntransition  from  emergency  response  to  long-term  sustainable \ndevelopment.  Improvements  in  the  budget  process,  financial \nmanagement  processes,  and  fiduciary  control  mechanisms  are \nlikely  to  encourage  more  donors  to  channel  funding  through  the \nGovernment  budget.  This  will,  in  turn,  lead  to  further  institutional \nstrengthening  and  state  building,  which  is  essential  to  the \nconsolidation of peace. FMPARP will encourage the Government \nto adopt a more participatory approach to the budgeting process, \nenhancing  ownership,  and  promoting  a  more  efficient  resource \nallocation  process.  More  efficient  allocation  of  public  resources \nwill be essential for poverty reduction and the achievement of the \nMDGs.  \n \nDirect beneficiaries will include the Government itself and officials, \nwho  will  gain  valuable  exposure  to  consultants  in  implementing \nthe reform  agenda and will benefit from training. Nongovernment \norganizations will benefit from the system of standards that will be \ndeveloped  under  subprogram  2  to  strengthen  outsourcing  of \nservice delivery. \n \n\n\fv \n\nfrom \n\nrisks \n\ninclude \n\nresulting \n\ninclude \nrisks. \n\nthese  services, \n\n(ii)  political,  and \n\n(iii) \n(i)  capacity \n\n(i)  security, \nInternal \n\nOver  the  longer  term,  FMPARP  will  strengthen  governance  in \nAfghanistan, including greater involvement by the state in raising \nrevenues  and  financing  development.  Taxpayers  and  importers \nwill benefit from a clearer, simplified, and more balanced tax and \ncustoms  administration.  Those  segments  of  the  population  most \ndependent  on  public  goods  and  services\u2014including  people  in \nmore  remote  areas\u2014can  expect  an  eventual  improvement  in  the \nquality  of \nreduced  waste, \nduplication, and other nonproductive use of public resources. The \nprivate  sector  will  gain  from  improved  public  services.  Overall, \nFMPARP will contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction \nin Afghanistan. \n \nExternal \nrisks \nmacroeconomic \nconstraints, (ii) governance, and (iii) donor coordination.   \n \nSecurity  concerns  pose  the  largest  risk.  A  worsening  security \nsituation would have many impacts on FMPARP, including limiting \nthe extension of reforms to the subnational level of government. If \nthe security situation deteriorates, operations will be restricted and \nfielding consultants and monitoring missions will be more difficult.  \n \nPolitical  risks  appear  to  be  contained,  following  successful \nparliamentary  and  provincial  elections.  However,  in  a  more \npoliticized  environment,  decisive  policy  decisions  may  not  be \nbased on technical merit alone. \n \nMacroeconomic  risks  have  been  reduced,  following  progress  in \neffective \nbuilding \nmacroeconomic  management  and  overall \nin \nmacroeconomic stabilization efforts.  \n \nCapacity  constraints  are  the  most  significant  internal  risks, \nbecause  of \nto \nthe \nimplement the reform program.  \n \nGovernance risks include the power of vested interests. Revenue \nadministration officials may be co-opted by interests that refuse to \nembrace change or by enterprises that want to override the legal \nsystem. There may also be scope for corruption. \n \nDonor coordination risks are acute in Afghanistan, where there is \na  significant  donor  presence  in  most  ministries.  Unless  there  is \nstrong Government ownership of the reforms, combined with well- \ncoordinated programs, there is a risk of duplication and ineffective \nassistance. \n \nThese  risks  will  be  mitigated  in  the  following  ways.  FMPARP  will \ndevelop  human  resource  management  policies  across  key \nministries  that  directly  address  the   weak   capacity.   The grant \n\nlimited  availability  of  skilled  resources \n\ninfrastructure \n\nimprovement \n\nsupporting \n\nensure \n\nto \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\ncomponent  is  particularly  designed  to  strengthen  capacity  and \ninstitutional development. \n \nFMPARP  will  support  efforts \nto  strengthen  macroeconomic \nstability through improving revenue collection and fiscal discipline. \nEnhancing  revenue  mobilization  will  reduce  the  risk  of  disruption \nand dependence on foreign assistance over the medium term.  \n \nOther safeguards include coordinated and complementary reform \nprograms  supported  by  other  donors,  including  an  IMF  Staff \nMonitored Program that is likely to be extended for another year, \nand may be upgraded to a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. \nThe  World  Bank  is  expected  to  approve  a  second  Programmatic \nSupport  for  Institution  Building  loan.  This  would  cover  a  broad \nrange  of \nfinancial \nmanagement.  The  World  Bank  is  also  expected  to  approve  a \nsecond Public Administration and Capacity Building loan for public \nadministration  reforms  and  support  for  the  procurement  of  an \nIGFMIS.  In  addition,  the  World  Bank  has  approved  a  Public \nFinancial  Management  Performance  Report  for  Afghanistan  that \nmonitors  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  performance \nacross  28  public \nindicators.  The \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom, \nand  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \nprograms  are  involved  in  areas  closely  related  to  FMPARP, \nincluding  revenue  administration  and  reforms  to  the  civil  service \nand state-owned enterprises.   \n\nfrom  procurement  policy \n\nfinancial  management \n\nreforms \n\nto \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  the  Fiscal \nManagement and Public Administration Reform Program (FMPARP) in the Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan  comprising  (i)  a  proposed  program  cluster  on  fiscal  management  and  public \nadministration  reforms  in  Afghanistan,  (ii)  a  proposed  program  loan  for  subprogram  1  of  the \nFMPARP  (the  Program)  and  (iii)  a  proposed  grant  for  Capacity  Building  for  Institutional \nDevelopment (the Project or the Grant).    \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n \n2. \nAfghanistan has made significant progress in achieving macroeconomic stability over the \nlast 3 years. Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown by 28.6% in fiscal year \n(FY)  2003  and  by  15.7%  in  FY2004.  In  FY2005,  growth  is  estimated  to  have  slowed  to  8.0%, \nlargely  because  of  a  decline  in  agricultural  output  as  a  result  of  a  drought.  The  economy  is \nhighly reliant on agriculture (37.2% of GDP, excluding opium production, in FY2005) and on the \nservice  sector  (38.3%).  Sectors  linked  to  the  reconstruction  effort,  such  as  construction  and \ntelecommunications,  continued  to  perform  well  in  FY2005.  Since  the  successful  currency \nconversion  in  early  2003,  prices  have  remained  broadly  stable  and  the  exchange  rate  has \nfluctuated  around  AF45\u201350  per  dollar,  reflecting  widespread  acceptance  of  the  new  currency \nand prudent macroeconomic and monetary policies. However, the opium economy has grown to \nrecord  levels  and  this  poses  one  of  the  country's  most  difficult  development  challenges. \nAccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), opium cultivation in 2004 \nincreased by 64%, which amounted to about 60% of the country's official GDP (see Appendix 1 \nfor key economic indicators). In 2005, opium production has fallen because of lower farm-gate \nprices and initial successes in the antinarcotics campaign. \n \n3. \nThe  operating  budget  for  FY2005  was  set  at  $609  million,  with  $300  million  to  be \ngenerated  from  domestic  revenue  and  $309  million  to  be  covered  by  foreign  assistance. \nDomestic  revenues  met  the  more  conservative  target  under  the  International  Monetary  Fund \n(IMF) Staff Monitored Program (SMP), although they were below the budget forecast. Custom \nduties,  which  represent  about  55%  of  total  revenues,  rose  by  20%.  As  in  the  previous  year, \noperating expenditures also fell short of the budget targets. For instance, because of continued \ndelays  in  recruiting  teachers  and  in implementing  the  main  civil  service  restructuring  program, \nexpenditures  were  AF2.4  billion  short  of  the  midyear  review  projection  of  AF29.1  billion.  The \ndevelopment  budget,  approved  with  a  delay,  increased  from  $1.8  billion  in  FY2004  to  $4.2 \nbillion  in  FY2005.  Development  budget  spending  has  been  very  slow  and  continues  to  be \nhampered  by  the  volatile  security  situation;  capacity  constraints,  particularly  in  line  ministries; \nand the long lead time required for project design. \n \nThe  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  rose  by  16.3%  in  FY2005  (year-on-year  change) \n4. \nreflecting  the  above  average  price  of  wheat  because  of  the  drought  and  sharp  increases  in \nhousing  prices.  Monetary  policy  continues  to  focus  on  keeping  inflation  under  control  and  on \nensuring  a  relatively  stable  exchange  rate.  A  regime  of  foreign  exchange  auctions  is  in  place. \nThe  Central  Bank  successfully  introduced  a  short-term  capital  note  in  September  2004  and \nreserve  requirements  for  commercial  banks  have  been  adopted.  Afghanistan's  financial \ninfrastructure,  including  savings  and  investment  instruments,  is  still  largely  undeveloped.  The \namount of currency in circulation is estimated to have grown by 40.9% in FY2004 and by 37.5% \nin  FY2005,  reflecting  strong  inflows  of  development  assistance  funds  while  maintaining  a  5% \nexchange rate trading band. Foreign reserves amounted to approximately $1.3 billion at the end \n\n\f2 \n\nof FY2005, reflecting 3.7 months of import coverage, an increase from $815 million the previous \nyear.  \n \n5. \nReliable balance of payment data are not available. Exports of goods (excluding opium, \nand  including  re-exports)  reached  $1.66  billion  in  FY2005.  Total  imports  amounted  to  $3.87 \nbillion.  According  to  UNODC,  the  value  of  opiate  exports  to  neighboring  countries  increased \nfrom $2.3 billion in 2003 to $2.8 billion in 2004. The current account deficit (excluding grants) is \nexpected to amount to $2.7 billion (45.0% of GDP) in FY2005. The deficit was covered mainly \nby grants (if grants are included, the deficit was 0.7% of GDP).1  \n \n6. \nDespite the strong economic recovery and progress in structural reforms, the remaining \nchallenges  are  huge.  If  Afghanistan  is  to  shift  from  recovery-related  growth  to  long-term \nsustainable  development,  it  will  require  new  drivers  of  growth,  continued  commitment  to  the \nambitious reform agenda, and sustained support from the international community. With a per \ncapita GDP of only $253 per annum in FY2005, reducing poverty, or even attaining the income \nlevels of neighboring countries, will require strong economic growth over the medium and long \nterm  and  substantial  international  assistance. Given  the  size  of  the  opium  economy,  a  holistic \nstrategy that creates alternative livelihoods in the rural economy, combined with interdiction and \neradication measures and legal reform, is needed, supported by broad-based economic growth \nand sustained donor commitment. Finally, because of its limited capacity to deliver public goods \nand  services,  the  Government  will  require  concerted  actions  with  donors  and  civil  society  to \ncreate a sustainable environment of good governance to ensure effective service delivery. This \nwill contribute to improved livelihoods and poverty reduction.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nSector Description and Government\u2019s Reform Program \n\n \nA. \n \nFollowing  the  collapse  of  the  Taliban  regime  in  2001,  the  transitional  administration, \n7. \nassisted  by  a  large  donor-funded  reconstruction  program,  embarked  on  rebuilding  the  core \nfunctions  of  government.  In  the  immediate  postconflict  stage,  the  strategic  challenge  for  the \nGovernment  was  to  move  swiftly  to  strengthen  security  and  stability  while  creating  the \nfoundations  for  effective  government  based  on  strong  economic  management  and  improved \ndelivery of public goods and services.  \n \n8. \nOn  the  economic  management  front,  key  achievements  in  the  early  years  included \nestablishing  (i)  a  two-tier  banking  system,  centered  on  the  Central  Bank  overseeing  inflation \nstabilization  and  the  issuance  of  a  new  currency,  the  afghani;  (ii)  a  budget  formulation  and \nimplementation  process;  (iii)  an  expenditure  framework  based  on  national  priority  programs; \n(iv) a revenue administration centered on the customs department and a large-taxpayer office; \nand (v) a treasury management system that operates at the provincial level through moustufiats2 \nand is based on expenditure controls through the treasury single account (TSA).  \n \n9. \nTo  improve  delivery  of  public  goods  and  services,  the  Government  focused  on \nstrengthening the capacity of the executive and key line ministries at the central level. This was \ncombined with the outsourcing of service delivery to nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and \nother  arrangements  as  required.  An  important  pillar  of  this  strategy  was  the  strengthening  of \npublic administration through greater incentives to attract and retain qualified staff, such as the \n\n                                                 \n1  If opium trade were included, both current and capital accounts would show large surpluses. \n2  Ministry of Finance (MOF) provincial office. \n\n\f3 \n\nPerformance \n\nPublic  Administration  Reform  and  Economic  Management  (PAREM)  Program  and  the  Priority \nReform and Restructuring Program (PRR).  \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  strong  economic  growth  performance  over  the  last  few  years  was  supported  by  a \ncommitment  to  an  ambitious  reform  agenda.  The  structural adjustment  reforms  (para.  8)  have \nled to a stronger economy with GDP growth averaging just over 17% per annum from FY2003 \nto  FY2005.  This  reflects  the  effects  of  donor-driven  development  assistance  combined  with \nimproved\u2014although still somewhat tenuous\u2014security conditions spurring consumption demand \nand  \u2013  through  better  business  opportunities  \u2013  investment.  Consumption  remains  strong,  and \nwas  estimated  to  have  been  105%  of  GDP  in  FY2005.  Gross  fixed  capital  formation  was \nestimated to have been 39% of GDP during the same period.  \n \n11. \nOn the political front, the country's first democratic presidential elections in October 2004 \nwere  met  by  high  voter  turnout  and  without  major  security  incidents.  Incumbent  interim \nPresident Hamid Karzai was confirmed as Afghanistan's first democratically elected President. \nThis was followed by parliamentary and provincial council elections in September 2005.3 These \nelections are expected to further advance the democratic process in Afghanistan and to lay the \nfoundations for greater political stability. \n \n12. \nIn  April  2002,  the  Government  adopted  a  national  development  framework  (NDF).  The \nNDF  focuses  on  three  pillars:  (i)  security  and  human  development,  (ii)  physical  infrastructure, \nand (iii) an enabling environment for development. For each pillar, broad sector programs have \nbeen  developed  and  in-country  consultative  groups  (CGs)  have  been  established  to  select \nprojects  and  coordinate  foreign  aid  flows.  National  priority  strategies  and  public  investment \nprograms  (PIPs)  across  16  sectors  have  laid  the  groundwork  for  prioritized  public  investment \nand  sustainable  medium-term  growth.  The  NDF  also  formed  the  basis  for  Securing \nAfghanistan's  Future:  Accomplishments  and  the  Strategic  Path  Forward,  the  Government\u2019s \nprevious development strategy, which was presented at the Berlin Conference on Afghanistan \nin March 2004. In mid-2005, the Government started work on the interim Afghanistan national \ndevelopment strategy (I-ANDS) which will also constitute the interim poverty reduction strategy. \nA  full  ANDS  will  be  developed  over  the  course  of  2006.  The  ANDS  will  update  and  integrate \nstrategies  for  (i)  reducing  poverty,  (ii)  generating  wealth  and  sustained  economic  growth,  and \n(iii)  promoting  social  inclusion.  The  process  will  include  widespread  consultation  and  the \ndevelopment  of  a  3-year  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  framework.  A  draft  I-ANDS  is  expected  to \nbe developed by December 2005 and presented formally at a donors\u2019 conference in London in \nJanuary 2006.  \n \n13. \nSecuring Afghanistan\u2019s Future (SAF), argued that an average of 9% growth per annum \nin the non-drug economy (10\u201315% in the short term and 7\u20139% in the long term) is needed over \nthe next 15 years to ensure a visible improvement in economic and social conditions while the \ndrug economy is gradually eliminated. During the Berlin conference, donors pledged $8.2 billion \nfor March 2004\u20132007, equivalent to 69% of the $11.9 billion Government target. Under SAF, the \nprivate  sector  is  expected  to  be  the  primary  engine  of  growth  and  employment  opportunities. \nSupport mechanisms for the private sector will have to be strengthened and progress made to \nstrengthen  legal  foundations  for  property  rights,  contract  enforcement,  bankruptcy,  and \n\n                                                 \n3  The new Parliament is scheduled to hold its first session in early December 2005 with the ratification of the cabinet \n\nbeing one of the first items on the agenda.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ntransport \n\ninvestments \n\nin  power  and \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\nindustries,  combined  with  sustained \n\nextractive \ninfrastructure.  \n \n14. \nTo achieve the Government's growth targets over the medium term and to replace opium \nproduction gradually, development needs to be more broad-based and sustainable. Decreasing \ndonor funds and increasing demands on the Government budget mean that domestic revenue \nefforts  need  to  be  stepped  up  significantly.  The  Government\u2019s  ability  to  meet  the  many \nchallenges will depend on the continuation of political and legal reforms, an improving security \nsituation,  and  sound  fiscal  and  economic  policies.  Improving  capacity  throughout  the \nGovernment will be essential for all of these reforms.   \n \n15. \nSince  March  2004,  the  Government  has  been  implementing  the  IMF-led  SMP  to \nmaintain  macroeconomic  and  financial  stability,  pursue  structural  reforms,  and  build  statistical \ncapacity. Performance during the first year of the SMP was strong and most targets were met. \nThe fifth quarterly review (April\u2013June 2005) confirmed that the Program remains on track and it \nhas  been  extended  another  year  to  September  2006.  It  may  be  upgraded  to  a  Poverty \nReduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in 2006 following approval of the ANDS. \n \nC. \n \nOver  the  past  4  years,  development  assistance  has  concentrated  on  building  the \n16. \nsupporting infrastructure for economic management in Afghanistan. In this period and given the \nfocus on emergency management, trade-offs were made that may have led to capacity building \nbeing substituted by international consultancy inputs. There is now a growing perception of the \nneed  to  move  towards  a  medium-term  sustainable  development  framework  with  increasing \ncountry  ownership  of  policies  and  greater  domestic  capacity.  Day-to-day  management  in  key \nministries  needs  to  be  reoriented  toward  forward-looking  strategies.  More  effective  institutions \nwill  be  needed  and  capacity  strengthened  throughout  Government.  There  will  be  a  gradual \nmovement towards a greater focus on sustainable development. \n \n17. \nThe  success  of  this  transition  will  largely  depend  on  two  key  initiatives:  deepening \nstructural  reforms  and  strengthening  capacity  throughout  the  civil  service.  The  deepening  of \nimproving  revenue  collection,  establishing  a  medium-term \nstructural  reforms\u2014including \nbudgeting framework, and developing a public expenditure management system\u2014are to sustain \neconomic growth and attain poverty reduction objectives. Strengthening capacity throughout the \ncivil  service  will  enhance  the  Government\u2019s  capability  to  implement  and  deepen  reforms  and \npromote  sound  economic  management.  The  Government  recognizes  that  these  reforms  will \nneed  to  be  designed  under  a  structured  and  programmatic  approach  under  a  common  policy \nframework if they are to have a lasting impact on the provision of public goods and services. A \nvision paper was prepared by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in collaboration with various donors \nthat sets out the strategic challenges and objectives for the ministry over the next 5 years.  \n \n18. \nsummary sector analysis in Appendix 2). The proposed reforms are discussed in Section IV.  \n \n\nThe  following  section  analyzes  the  critical  constraints  on  FMPARP  (see  also  the \n\n1. \n\nFiscal Management \n\n \n19. \nThe Government has stressed the importance of the budget as the principal instrument \nof policy and reform and has urged donors to increasingly channel funds through the budget. In \nFY2005,  only  $1.7  billion  out  of  a  total  of  $5.1  billion  was  implemented  directly  by  the \nGovernment through the budget ($1.3 billion of which remained under direct donor supervision \n\n\f5 \n\nand  fiduciary  oversight).  Most  donors  continue  to  channel  resources  directly  to  NGOs  and/or \nprivate  agencies  through  special  funds  and  other  arrangements.  This  is  particularly  evident  in \nthe health sector, where NGOs, directly funded by donors, run the health care services in most \nprovinces.  The  percentage  of  funding  that  lies  outside  Government  budgetary  controls, \ncombined  with  weak  Government  capacity,  makes  it  difficult  to  move  towards  a  more  policy-\noriented  budget.4  To  address  this  issue,  the  budget  process  will  have  to  be  strengthened. \nFiduciary  controls  and  overall  financial  management  must  be  strengthened,  so  donors  feel \nconfident  enough  to  channel  more  resources  through  the  Government  budget.  At  the  same \ntime,  Government  capacity  and  coordination  mechanisms  will  have  to  be  enhanced  so \ndevelopment plans can be translated into properly designed investment programs and projects. \n \n20.  Weak  Policy  Formulation  and  Implementation  Capacity.  Sound  macroeconomic \nmanagement  is  critical  to  support  stabilization  in  any  postconflict  transition  phase.  In \nAfghanistan, (i) managing large inflows of donor funds; (ii) pursuing structural reforms, including \nprice liberalization; and (iii) rooting out the underground opium economy are challenging for any \npolicy  maker.  Policy  instruments  are  in  many  cases  at  an  early  stage  of  development \n(e.g., liquidity management instruments) or are being adopted in parallel with the introduction of \nthe  legal  and  regulatory  framework  (e.g.,  budget,  tax,  customs,  and  civil  service  laws  and \nsupporting regulations). \n \nSlow  Disbursement/Weak  Budget  Implementation.  Limited  absorptive  capacity \n21. \nconstrains  Government  efforts  to  roll  out  service  delivery  and  make  effective  use  of  public \nresources for reconstruction. Operating expenditures and \u201ccore\u201d budget development spending, \nwhich includes donor-funded projects administered through Government accounts, continue to \nbe below budget targets. In FY2005, for instance, delays in recruiting national teachers and in \nthe civil service restructuring program led to significant underspending. Similarly, development \nbudget  spending  has  been  consistently  behind  target  and  continues  to  be  hampered  by  the \nvolatile  security  situation  and  capacity  constraints,  particularly  in  line  ministries  and  at  the \nprovincial  level.  Further,  multiyear  projects  are  typically  characterized  by  a  lengthy  start-up \nperiod (e.g., for the preparation of feasibility studies).  \n \n22. \nParallel Budget Processes. The budget currently consists of an operating core budget \nwhere funds are channeled through the Treasury and a donor-funded external budget. The core \nbudget  is  divided  into  the  operating  budget  and  the  development  budget.  The  development \nbudget  is  wholly  dependent  on  external  sourcing  and,  because  of  delays  in  confirming  donor \ncommitments,  is  prepared  and  approved  after  the  beginning  of  the  fiscal  year.  This  creates \nsignificant difficulties as resources are unpredictable and timely project preparation very difficult. \nThe budget cycles for the operating and development budgets are still not synchronized, which \ncauses  difficulties  in  budget  programming,  including  proper  identification  of  resources  for  the \nrecurrent  costs  of  investment  projects.  Budgeting  for  multi-year  investment  projects  is  very \ncomplicated.  Currently  the  implications  of  investment  expenditure  on  the  operating  budget  are \nnot considered when making the decision to invest through the development budget. Delays in \nbudget preparation and approval have led to delays in wage payments at the start of the fiscal \nyear, although this should not be an issue following the approval of the interim operating budget \nfor FY2006 before the start of the fiscal year.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  In  most  countries,  donor  assistance  is  channeled  through  the  recipient  country\u2019s  national  budget.  This  serves  to \nreinforce the Government\u2019s priorities under its national development strategy. If resources are not coursed through \nthe  budget,  the  degree  of  Government  ownership  and  commitment  is  undermined  as  it  is  not  fully  in  control  of \ndevelopment expenditures. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nLack of a  Multi-Year  Framework. While significant progress has been made over the \n23. \nlast  2  years,  budget  programming  is  still  in  its  early  stages.  There  is  a  need  to  develop  a \nmedium-term fiscal program that attempts to project expenditure and revenues over the medium \nterm  (i.e.,  the  next  3  years).  Multi-year  aggregate  fiscal  forecasts  are  updated  annually. \nHowever,  current  expenditure  estimates  are  only  at  the  aggregate  level.  Domestic  revenue \nprojections are targets rather than tight estimates based on forecasting models that would take \ninto account the economic results of specific policy actions. Accordingly, midyear reviews often \nreduce programmed spending and revenues. For the first time, in FY2006 line ministries will be \nrequired  to  prepare  multiyear  projections  as  part  of  budget  preparation.  There  is  also  limited \nanalysis  of  how  policy  decisions  (e.g.,  wage  increases  or  pension  commutation)  or  external \nfactors (e.g., oil price shocks or security constraints) can affect spending plans. \n \nLack  of  Budget  Comprehensiveness.  Revenues5  and  expenditures6  of  public \n24. \nenterprises  are  considered  to  be  outside  the  national  budget.  However,  public  enterprises \nrepresent a significant financial holding, and the state as the sole or majority owner bears the \nimpact of their financial operations. In Afghanistan, public enterprises control essential physical \nassets in almost all sectors of the economy.7 According to a survey in October 2004, the public \nenterprise sector is composed of 78 enterprises:8 6 banks, 1 insurance company, and 71 non-\nfinancial enterprises engaged in agriculture, manufacturing, industry, and services. In addition, \nthere are a number of other non-financial Government-controlled commercial entities, including \nAriana  Airlines,  as  well  a  broad  range  of  activities  of  commercial  nature  that  are  being \nundertaken by various Government departments. However, there is very limited information on \nthese entities. The MOF has little consolidated information on the transfer of public finances to \npublic  enterprises  and  other  Government-controlled  commercial  entities,  partly  because  of  a \nlack of financial reporting, and partly because of inconsistencies in the Government\u2019s treatment \nof them. The lack of a governance framework allows room for corruption. \n \n25. \nCurrent  incomplete  data  indicate  that  transfers  (i.e.,  subsidies)  to  public  enterprises \namounted to an estimated AF25 million in FY2003, AF128 million in FY2004, and AF28 million \nin the first half of FY2005. In addition to the declared transfers, there are likely to be untracked \ntransfers, such as salaries of staff of public enterprises which are included as part of ministries\u2019 \npayrolls and possible contingent liabilities such as arrears on payment of salaries and pensions, \nand  Government  guarantees.  \u201cSubsidies\u201d  may  also  arise  when  ministries  are  obliged  to  buy \nfrom public enterprises and public enterprises receive preference when they bid on Government \ncontracts. Without fiduciary controls in place, resources may be diverted and corrupt practices \nencouraged. \n \n26. \nBudget  Allocations  across  Provinces.  The  current  budget  process  does  not  include \nallocation  mechanisms  to  distribute  resources  to  provinces.  In  essence,  this  is  done  by  line \nministries,  which  decide  on  expenditure  allocations  for  each  province.  This  raises  several \nissues.  The  Government  is  not  making  full  use  of  its  tax  and  spending  powers  to  meet  socio-\neconomic  regional  development  objectives,  including  powers  to  distribute  resources.  Although \n\n                                                 \n5  The state-owned (public) enterprises (SOE) Law stipulates that up to 37.5% of net profits are to be transferred to \n\nthe Government (after deducting 25% for special expenditures and 37.5% for working capital, etc.). \n\n6  In some cases, payroll of public enterprises are included in a line ministry payroll. Similarly, expenditure related to \n\ncommercial activities managed and operated by Government agencies may also be included in the budget. \n\n7  A  number  of  investments  in  SOEs  have  been  planned  through  the  development  budget,  notably  in  the  power \nsector. If contributions from development partners are  included, roughly $150 million  has been invested in SOEs \nfrom FY2003 to the mid-FY2005.  \n\n8  Recent  analysis  by  Bearing  Point  (a  consulting  firm)  has  revealed  that  earlier  estimates  of  more  than  150  SOEs \n\nreflected the inclusion of many subsidiaries of the major SOEs. \n\n\f7 \n\ntax  revenues  collected  at  the  provincial  level  are  still  relatively  modest,  there  is  a  need  to \naddress  the  moral  hazard  problem  related  to  aligning  provinces\u2019  incentives  in  revenue \ngeneration \u201ceffort\u201d and resulting additional spending \u201cbenefits\u201d from the center. Hence, from both \na  social  welfare  and  efficiency  perspective,  there  will  be  gains  from  developing  a  more \nsystematic and transparent revenue allocation system.  \n \n27. \nLimited Capacity at Moustufiats. Any effective extension of public goods and services \nwill require strengthening of provincial administrations to ensure that essential public goods and \nservices reach people throughout the country. Currently, a small share of potential tax revenues \nis  collected  by  moustufiats.  About  60%  of  national  tax  revenue  is  collected  at  customs \ncheckpoints  at  province  borders.  These  revenues  are  remitted  to  moustufiats  or  provincial  tax \ncollection  offices  and  subsequently  deposited  in  the  TSA.  Effective  revenue  collection  implies \nclearer coordination between the Customs Department in Kabul, the moustufiats, and the actual \ncheckpoints, in addition to better enforcement capabilities. Moustufiats are also responsible for \npayment and treasury functions at the provincial level.  \n \nBudget  Coherence  with  Development  Strategy  and  PIPs.  The  transition  from \n28. \nemergency  response  to  long-term  sustainable  development  needs  to  be  underwritten  by  a \nrobust  economic  development  strategy.  The  NDF  of  April  2002,  which  was  subsequently \nconfirmed  and  further  refined  in  Securing  Afghanistan\u2019s  Future  (SAF)  in  2004,  outlines  the \nGovernment\u2019s  development  strategy.  The  NDF  contains  a  list  of  national  priority  programs \n(NPPs). At present, the Government is finalizing an NDF update that will also form the basis of \nthe I-ANDS.  \n \nNPPs operate within the framework of 16 public investment programs (PIPs). They are \n29. \norganized  around  (i)  security  and  human  development,  (ii)  physical  infrastructure,  and  (iii) an \nenabling  environment  for  development.  The  NPPs  are  steered  by  budget,  steering,  and \noversight  committees.  Program  implementation  units  (PIU)  for  each  NPP  are  responsible  for \ncoordination as well as for financial and operational performance. The consultative group (CG) \nwill continue to serve as the principal consultative forum for discussions on progress, policies, \nand  cross-cutting  concerns  that  affect  a  particular  NPP.  A  review  of  the  CG  is  currently \nunderway. See Appendix 3 for a more detailed description of CGs. \n \n30. \nThe  NPPs  are  meant  to  provide  a  strategic  framework  for  donor-funded  investment \nprojects and for the development budget. Similarly, the PIP represents a menu of projects that is \nonly gradually being prioritized. In many cases, criteria for including projects on PIP are based \non the ministry\u2019s capacity to implement the Project, rather than on economic returns or strategic \ncomplementarities from the investment.  \n \n31.  Limited  Revenue  Mobilization  Capacity.  The  Government\u2019s  objective,  according  to \nSAF, is to cover the wage bill by FY2009 and all operating expenditures by FY2014. According \nto  the  more  recent  medium-term  fiscal  framework  (MTFF),  domestic  revenue  as  a  share  of \noperating expenditure, is projected to reach 98.7% by FY2010. In FY2005, the revenue to GDP \nratio  was  about  4.5%  and  it  is  projected  to  reach  12.5%  by  FY2015.  However,  achieving  this \nambitious  target  will  require  a  substantial  increase  in  revenue  collection  efforts  and  careful \nmacroeconomic management. Progress has been made in domestic revenue generation, which \nincreased  from  $132  million  in  FY2003  to  $207  million  in  FY2004  and  reached  about  $265 \nmillion in FY2005. New tax policy reform measures were enacted in early 2004 including a final \nwage  withholding  tax  on  higher  income  employees,  an  improved  income  tax  regime,  and  a \nlimited  range  of  consumption  taxes  on  services  such  as  telecommunications,  air  travel,  hotels \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nand restaurants. A large-taxpayer office has been established, although there has been limited \nsuccess  on  corporate  income  tax  collection.  According  to  the  FY2006  midyear  budget  review, \ntotal domestic revenue is projected at $468 million, corresponding to an increase of 41% over \nthe $333 million in projected revenues at the beginning of the fiscal year.9 Approximately 50% of \nthe  operating  budget  and  100%  of  the  development  budget  are  expected  to  be  financed  by \nforeign assistance.10 \n \n32. \nGrowth in the overall wage bill has far outpaced growth in domestic revenue generation. \nThe  wage  bill  (already  about  60%  of  the  operating  budget)  is  expected  to  increase  more \nmoderately  over  the  coming  years  despite  pressures  from  the  recruitment  of  teachers,  civil \nservice  pay  increases11  related  to  the  implementation  of  the  PRR,  and  police  pay  increases. \nMoreover,  it  has  been  proposed  that  funding  for  the  Afghan  National  Army  (ANA),  currently \nfinanced by external grants, be incorporated into the core budget over the coming years, which \nwill pose problems for the Government unless external funding continues. \n \n33. \nAs  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  shore  up  revenues,  a  new  customs  code  and \namendment to the Revenue Law were recently approved. The amendment includes provisions \non:  (i)  access  powers,  penalties,  offences,  collection  enforcement,  and  record-keeping \nrequirements; (ii) corporate tax reforms and provisions for extractive industries; and (iii) a new \nairport departure fee. These measures are expected to place revenue collection on a sounder \nand more sustainable footing.12  \n \n \n \nThe public administration reform (PAR) program has seven major components, including \n34. \ninstitutional  and  functional  streamlining,  the  civil  service  legal  framework,  and  personnel \nmanagement.  The  objective  of  the  PAR  is  to  build  a  sound  legal,  administrative,  and  physical \nenvironment  so  civil  servants  can  function  effectively  and  be  held  accountable  for  their \nperformance.  Overall  responsibility  and  coordination  of  PAR  rests  with  the  Independent \nAdministrative  Reform  and  Civil  Service  Commission  (IARCSC).  The  priority  reform  and \nrestructuring  (PRR)  initiative  provides  a  framework  for  implementing  the  first  generation  PAR \nprogram.  \n \n35. \nPAR  has  two  subprograms:  public  administration  reform  and  governance  (PARG)  and \neconomic  and  financial  management.  The  strategic  priority  of  PARG  is  to  strengthen  policy \ndevelopment capacity within ministries and to focus on the core functions of government. Over \n8,000 civil service posts in \u201creformed\u201d departments will became eligible for higher salaries and \nof these, about 600 senior posts are being filled through an open competitive process under the \nsupervision  of  the  Independent  Appointments  Board  (IAB).  The  strategic  priority  of  economic \nand financial management is to complete the annual operating and development budgets based \n\nPublic Administration  \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n9  The increase in revenue reflects an expected one-off revenue of $80 million from the sale of a telecommunication \nlicense. Netting out this  windfall gain, the  projected revenues for FY2006  would be $388 million  equivalent to an \nannual growth rate of 46% (compared with an annual real GDP growth rate of 12% and annual inflation of 10%). \n10 The  core  development  expenditure  (or  the  part  of  the  development  expenditure  that  is  channeled  through  the \ntreasury\u2019s  accounts)  is  projected  at  approximately  $1  billion  for  FY2006,  equivalent  to  21%  of  a  projected  $4.8 \nbillion total development budget requirement. \n\n11 In FY2006, the Government approved (i) wage increases reflecting a markup of 50% of inflation across all sectors \nand  (ii)  non  wage  increases  reflecting  a  mark-up  of  inflation  plus  10%  for  the  ministries  of  education,  health, \nagriculture, interior and defense and inflation plus 5% for the rest. \n\n12 The  IMF  estimates  that  tax  forgone  as  a  result  of  the  old  tax  regime  with  its  generous  tax  exemptions  and \nconcessions is $14.6 million for FY2006 (4.4% of budgeted domestic revenue) and $30.2 million since FY2003/04. \n\n\f9 \n\non a medium-term expenditure framework. The legal framework underpinning the development \nof activities under the two subprograms are included under the Civil Service Law and the Public \nExpenditure  and  Financial  Management  Law,  which  were  approved  in  September  and  June \n2005, respectively.  \n  \n36. \nThe PRR program is an asymmetric and incremental civil service reform program  and, \nmore generally, a promoter of change management in Government. It is supported by the World \nBank.  Approved  PRR  proposals  range  from  creating  new  agencies  to  restoring  basic \noperational  services.  PRR  is  built  around  creating  short-term  capacity  within  ministries  to \npromote  policy  reform,  while  setting  the  groundwork  for  institutional  strengthening.  The  PRR \nfollows  a  two-stage  approach.  In  stage  1,  ministries  make  proposals  to  be  considered  for  the \nPRR to the IARCSC. Proposals highlight function, skills mix, and the task force that is in place \nto lead and manage the restructuring process. The administrative reform service evaluates the \nproposal and submits recommendations to the chairman, IARCSC, who, in consultation with the \nministerial  advisory  committee  makes  a  final  decision  on  whether  or  not  to  present  the \napplication  for  stage  2  consideration.  Stage  2  consists  of  ministries  making  proposals  for \nincreased pay levels according to the interim additional allowance (IAA) scale. Proposals should \nbe based on a detailed proposal on expected improvements in efficiency and cost-effectiveness \nand  should  have  been  agreed  by  MOF.  Recently,  the  ministerial  advisory  committee  has \nrequired that the applying ministry should have in place a broader strategic plan for the ministry. \nPositions  are  filled  by  open  competition  and  appointments  are  made  by  the  IAB.  There  are \nprobationary periods and annual reviews of performance. A super-scale category in excess of \nIAA has also been introduced for individuals with exceptional qualifications.  \n \nThe  PRR  has  provided  insights  on  specific  challenges  and  opportunities  for  rebuilding \n37. \nthe  machinery  of  government  and  on  the  appropriate  institutional  mechanisms  for  political \noversight  of  PAR.  The  Government  is  developing  a  second-generation  PAR  program  as  an \nintegral  part  of  the  development  of  the  ANDS.  New  institutional  mechanisms  for  political \noversight and for strengthened donor coordination will be an integral part of the next generation \nof PAR and will be supported by the World Bank and others. The legal framework provided by \nthe  recently  approved  Civil  Service  Law  will  feature  heavily  in  the  second  generation  PAR \nprogram and help formalize and strengthen many reforms initiated through the PRR process.  \n \n38. \nLack of Coordination Mechanisms and Capacity. Coordination of reconstruction and \ndevelopment activities remains weak. Some ministries, including the Ministry of Interior and the \nMinistry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development have established coordination mechanisms at \nprovincial  and  district  levels.  These  mechanisms  strengthen  coordination  within  specific \nprograms,  but  they  do  not  address  the  need  for  more  comprehensive,  Government-led \ncoordination. Such coordination is essential for prioritizing and sequencing investments across \nall national programs.  \n \n39. \nLimited  Capacity  at  Provincial  Administration.  Provincial  administrations  are  critical \nelements  in  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  implement  effective  service  delivery  and  to  fulfill  the \nfuture ANDS. Currently, public spending is undertaken through provincial representatives of line \nministries. There is limited capacity to assess how the public spending of the line ministries can \nfulfill key provincial development goals. There is also limited stakeholder consultation to ensure \nprovincial  needs  are  reflected  in  national  budget  formulation.  Any  effective  roll-out  of  public \ngoods and services will thereby imply strengthening provincial administrations to increase their \ninvolvement in development planning over the medium term and in budget formulation over the \nlonger term. The creation of a parliament and provincial councils is expected to lead to further \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nreforms  of  provincial  administrations  and  to  strengthen  their  role  in  provincial  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. \n \n\n3. \n\nPublic Financial Management \n\n \n40. \nThe  legislative  framework  which  governs  public  financial  management  (PFM)  in \nAfghanistan is composed of numerous laws and regulations that are applied selectively and do \nnot  clearly  delineate  PFM  roles  and  responsibilities.  Moreover,  contradictory  provisions \nundermine  compliance  and  its  implementation.  To  address  this,  a  Public  Finance  and \nExpenditure  Management  (PFEM)  Law  was  approved  in  June  2005.  The  law  covers  the \nGovernment  sector13  (although  rules  for  center\u2013province  relationships  will  have  to  be  clarified \nunder regulations to be developed). It (i) provides clearly defined PFM roles and responsibilities, \n(ii)  requires  adequate  reporting,  (iii)  provides  for  independent  review,  and  (iv)  holds  public \nofficials  accountable.  The  Government\u2019s  program  of  financial  management  improvements, \nwhich  is  supported  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s  recently  completed  Public  Finance  Review,  will  have \nfar-reaching consequences for the processes (recording, accounting, and reporting) of financial \ntransactions over the next few years. \n \n41. \nThe  MOF  is  the  lead  agency  in  the  development  of  the  Government\u2019s  financial \nmanagement  system.  It  is  responsible  for  budget  preparation,  execution  and  control,  revenue \nadministration  (customs  and  non-customs  revenue),  payroll,  accounting,  financial  reporting, \ndebt  management,  cash  management,  as  well  as  a  range  of  functions  for  Government  asset \nadministration. To date, the MOF has focused on critical elements of the Government\u2019s financial \nmanagement  system.  Since  2002,  public  financial  management  roles,  rules,  and  information \nhave  evolved,  and  significant  steps  have  been  undertaken  with  donor  support  to  implement \nemergency arrangements for public financial management and to build capacity in the key areas \nof budget implementation and treasury, procurement, and external auditing.  \n  \nAccordingly,  information  technology  (IT)  applications  have  been  developed  and \n42. \nimplemented to support: (i) the national budget process; (ii) treasury functions, which comprise \nbudget  execution  and  control,  accounting,  and  financial  reporting;  (iii)  payroll;  (iv)  customs \nadministration; and (v) some functions of asset administration and management. Each of these \nhas been developed as a separate management information system (MIS) with varying degrees \nof coordination. They operate for all practical purposes as separate systems. In addition to the \nMOF\u2019s  efforts,  many  line  ministries  are  investing  in  IT  to  support  their  specific  financial \nmanagement  requirements.  As  the  Government  moves  into  the  next  phase  of  development,  it \nbecomes critical that a strategic and structured approach to the investment and implementation \nof  Government  financial  management  IT  systems  is  undertaken.  A  strategic  approach  is \nrequired to enable appropriate and cost effective investment, and to avoid duplication of effort. \nThe  adoption  of  a  strategic  approach  is  of  particular  importance  now,  with  the  extension  of \nexisting systems to the line ministries and provinces under consideration.  \n \nTreasury  Management.  Effective  cash  management14  remains  a  major  challenge  in \n43. \nAfghanistan. Cash flow forecasts are prepared for the operating budget for the fiscal year and \nupdated monthly. However, revenue and expenditure projections are drawn from targets rather \nthan from historical patterns and procurement plans, and have resulted in large idle balances in \n\n                                                 \n13 PFEM does not apply to SOEs, which operate under the Companies Act. \n14 In  accordance  with  the  Constitution,  all  public  revenue  and  all  expenditure  for  the  operations  are  managed  by \nTreasury  under  a  treasury  single  account  (TSA).  The  special  disbursements  unit,  in  Treasury,  manages  278 \nspecial accounts for earmarked donor programs. \n\n\f11 \n\nEffective  cash  management  requires  synchronization  of  cash \n\nprovincial offices. Revenue information is inputted from the actual data and there are difficulties \nin  reconciling  accounts  between  the  central  treasury  and  line  ministries.  In  the  balance  of \nexpenditures, donor contributions to the operational budget are based on existing commitments. \nMoreover, development budgets are for the most part outside cash planning and consolidation \narrangements.  \n \n44. \nflow  needs  and \nborrowing,15  to  avoid  unnecessary  public  debt  charges.  However,  there  is  no  formal  debt \nstrategy,  and  the  MOF  has  to  develop  capacity  to  support  debt  sustainability  analyses. \nSpreadsheet records of debt are maintained and reports on debt stock and service are prepared \nperiodically. However, these do not include records on guarantees, or support budgeting of debt \nservice for existing loans, forecasting for new loans and disbursements, analysis under different \nscenarios, or allows for checks on reporting and costing. As the debt register is not integrated \nwith  the  treasury  system,  (i.e.,  the  Afghanistan  management  information  system  [AFMIS]) \nreliance is placed on manual checks for data integrity, manual reporting, and audit trails.   \n \nCash  management  needs  to  ensure  that  there  are  no  imbalances  resulting  from  a \n45. \nsudden  overrun  on  expenditures  or  shortfall  in  revenues.  While  the  overriding  \u201cno  overdraft\u201d \npolicy  is  a  safeguard  against  accumulated  imbalances,  there  have  been  occasions  when  the \nTreasury Department has had to draw down on the proceeds from budgetary support loans in \norder  to  correct  a  mismatch  between  expenditure  and  receipts,.  More  recently,  a  prudential \nreserve has been introduced in the budget. Despite this reserve, as there is no predictable and \nseparate  revenue  stream  (in  the  absence  of  a  market  for  treasury  management  instruments, \nsuch as treasury bills, in Afghanistan), using part of loan proceeds as a revenue buffer may be \njustified.  However,  the  current  system  is  far  from  an  ideal  solution  and  entails  significant \nopportunity costs on the use of available loan funds.  \n \nD. \n \n \n \n46. \nIn  general,  development  effectiveness  principles  recognize  the  Government\u2019s  central \nrole  in  managing  the  development  process.16  This  implies  Government  ownership  from  the \nnational  development  strategy  to  the  public  expenditure  review  and  public  investment \nprogramming.  Although  there  are  limits  on  \u201cownership\u201d  in  postconflict  economies,  the  sooner \nwell-run economic management is transferred to the Government, the greater is the scope for \nGovernment accountability for use of resources and overall results. In Afghanistan, where about \n30%  of  total  planned  spending  is  channeled  through  the  operational  budget  and  where  some \nGovernment  functions  are  almost  fully  outsourced  to  NGOs,  donor  assistance  should  strive  to \nbuild capacity to ensure greater ownership. \n \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\nLessons Learned \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n15 Afghanistan\u2019s total stock of publicly guaranteed debt in 2003/2004 is estimated at $617 million, equivalent to 13% \nof GDP. Of this amount, $323 million is multilateral debt and $294 million is bilateral debt. However, a substantial \nportion of the debt still needs to be verified and reconciled as several countries have provided generous debt relief \non  old  claims  while  in  other  countries  there  are  still  disputed  claims.  As  highlighted  by  the  IMF,  in  view  of  the \nnarrow base for domestic resource mobilization, Afghanistan will need to rely primarily on grants over the coming \nyears. Over the medium-term, with increasing absorptive capacity and improved fiscal discipline, there may likely \nbe a gradual shift towards concessional financing as the grant funding declines.  \n\n16 See  for  example,  Development  Assistance  Committee  Guidelines  and  Reference  Series,  Organization  for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 2003. Harmonizing Donor Practices for Effective Aid Delivery. \nFrance: OECD Publication Service. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n47.  More  effective  Government  ownership  of  economic  management  (supported  by  a \nprivate-sector-led growth strategy) requires institutional strengthening, in particular, developing \n(i)   a  medium-term  strategy  to  achieve  development  objectives  consistent  with  the  institutional \nvision; (ii) human resource policies that are consistent with results-based management, based \non an incentives framework, and  responsive to changing circumstances; and (iii) management \ninformation systems that strengthen transparency and accountability and can facilitate functional \nreforms  and  change  management.  In  Afghanistan,  provincial  administrations  and  local \ngovernment,  where  capacity  during  the  years  of  war  was  almost  completely  destroyed,  are \nparticularly  weak.  Reforms  with  the  objective  of  extending  public  goods  and  services  nation-\nwide will need to address these institutional constraints.   \n \n48. \nReforms will need to be supported by strong communication policy both with regard to \noutside  stakeholders  (why  is  it  important  to  change?)  and  insiders  (how  will  staff  benefit  from \nchange?). \n \n49. \nFMPARP seeks to strengthen Government ownership of the budget process\u2014ultimately \nthe  most  important  policy  instrument\u2014in  order  to  translate  Government  priorities  into \ndevelopment  projects.  Measures  will  seek  to  strengthen  fiscal  management  by  focusing  on \n(i) systems  and  procedures  consistent  with \ninternational  standards;  and  (ii)  strategic \ndevelopment  through  human  resource  practices  and  modern  integrated  IT  systems.  The \nproposed grant under FMPARP will play a critical role in training and capacity building, drawing \non  Government  officials  and  other  domestic  consultants  to  be  retained  under  special  public \nadministration reform programs.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSequencing of Reforms \n\n \n50. \nThe  World  Bank  has  analyzed  the  sequencing  of  public  sector  reforms  for  service \ndelivery.17 The largest payoffs result from a few key actions such as (i) setting the framework for \nspending effectively and predictably in line with priorities and ensuring this is well coordinated \nacross sectors; (ii) devolving administrative systems so they are close to the end users of public \ngoods  and  services;  and  (iii)  enhancing  administrative  capacity  to  manage  and  implement  the \nGovernment\u2019s policies and priorities efficiently. FMPARP draws on this analysis and recognizes \nthat  sustainable  improvements  in  service  delivery  need  to  be  based  on  efficient  revenue \ncollection, clear prioritizing of spending, and effective monitoring of impact. Once this foundation \nis  in  place,  there  can  be  more  sustainable  and  targeted  reforms  for  improved  service  delivery \nunder subprogram 2.  \n \n \n \nDrawing on recent work by the IMF,18 building fiscal institutions in postconflict countries \n51. \nrequires: (i) creating a legal and/or regulatory framework for fiscal management, (ii) establishing \nand/or  strengthening  the  fiscal  authority,  and  (iii)  designing  appropriate  revenue  and \nexpenditure  policies,  while  simultaneously  strengthening  revenue  administration  and  public \nexpenditure  management.  Key  strategies  include  focusing  on  a  large  number  of  intermediate \nmeasures  over  the  short  term  that  will  gradually  transform  budgetary  practices  from  a  crisis \nmode  to  a  more  normal  state  of  affairs.  Local  capacity  needs  to  be  built;  without  appropriate \n\nLeveraging Fiscal Management  \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n17 See  World  Bank.  2004.

Accordingly, the proposed policy \nmeasures  have  set  out  various  intermediate  policy  actions  under  a  cluster  approach  spread \nacross  two  subprograms.  FMPARP  adopts  public  administration  reform  as  a  cross-cutting \ntheme  and  identifies  various  capacity  strengthening  actions.  It  recognizes  the  link  between \nconflict  and  poverty  and  that  institution  building  creates  a  virtuous  cycle  that  allows  for \ndeepening of reforms and thereby more potential for economic growth. \n \n \n \n53. \nImproving  a  country\u2019s  public  financial  governance  framework  by  putting  in  place \ntransparent  budget  processes,  automation  of  revenue  administration,  and  merit-based \nappointments  in  the  civil  service  are  crucial  steps  towards  a  system  of  accountability  in \nthat  corruption  and  other \ngovernment.  While  such  measures  cannot  guarantee \nmisappropriations  of  resources  will  not  occur,  they  are  critical  in  the  fight  against  fraud  and \ncorruption.19  \n \n\nAnticorruption and Governance \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\nPast Experience   \n\n \n54. \nADB has considerable experience in other countries of responding to similar problems. A \nFiscal  Management  Reform  Program20  for  another  postconflict  country,  Sri  Lanka,  was \napproved  in  December  2004.  The  programs  in  Afghanistan  and  Sri  Lanka  have  similar  policy \nobjectives,  including  strengthening  revenue  administration  and  developing  a  medium-term \nbudgeting framework. However, given the more severe institutional constraints in Afghanistan, \nthe achievement of these objectives is likely to take longer. ADB will also build on its experience \nof  public  resource  management  projects  in  India,  including  those  in  Gujarat,  Kerala,  and \nMadhya  Pradesh.  In  view  of  the  greater  external  risks  facing  the  project  in  Afghanistan,  the \nFMPARP aims for flexibility and sets few hard quantitative targets. It opts instead for laying the \nbuilding  blocks \ntargets  will  be  considered  under \nsubprogram 2. \n \n55. \nIn  implementing  the  FMPARP,  ADB  will  draw  on  experience  gained  from  the  Public \nAdministration Reform Program in Afghanistan,21 the PRR review, and ADB support for similar \nreforms in Mongolia, Nepal, and Vietnam. The key lesson of previous initiatives is the need to \nsupport country-led initiatives through an incremental process of change that takes into account \nthe country context. Public administration reform in FMPARP will focus on the implementation of \nthe  new  Civil  Service  Law  and  will  aim  to  develop  capacity  at  institutional,  organizational  and \nindividual  levels.  Tracking  capacity  development  will  draw  on  ADB\u2019s  operational  policy  in  this \narea  (which  is  still  being  developed)  and  guiding  principles  from  the  Development  Assistance \n\nfiscal  management.

The IMF SMP has been \nextended  to  September  2006  and  its  support  for  macroeconomic  stabilization  will  complement \nFMPARP.  The  World  Bank  will  support  broad  reforms  under  a  Programmatic  Support  for \nInstitution  Building  (PSIB2)  program  for  approximately  $80  million  and  a  Second  Public \nAdministration  and  Capacity  Building  (PACB2)  program  for  $30  million,  which  will  include \nsupport  for  the  procurement  of  an  integrated  government  financial  management  information \nsystem (IGFMIS). The DFID and USAID programs also cover areas closely aligned to FMPARP, \nincluding revenue administration and civil service and SOE reforms. Appendix 4 contains a list \nof partner agencies with programs related to FMPARP. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nObjective and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n58. \nAs part of the I-ANDS, the Government is focusing on strengthening fiscal management \ninstitutions  by:  (i)  expanding  absorptive  capacity  in  priority  sectors,  (ii)  making  more  effective \nuse  of  development  assistance,  and  (iii)  increasing  country  ownership  of  development \nobjectives and priorities. In order to support the Government\u2019s strategy and priorities, FMPARP \nemphasizes (i) developing systems and procedures to support improved effectiveness of public \nresources  and  overall  fiscal  management,  and  (ii)  expanding  measures  to  strengthen  civil \nservice management through selected programs. \n \n59. \nFMPARP is a cluster program that will include a policy reform component (the Program) \ntogether  with  a  grant  component  (the  Grant)  to  support  implementation  of  the  Program  and \ncapacity building initiatives. The cluster consists of subprogram 1 and subprogram 2 (the design \nof  which  will  depend  on  the  outcome  of  subprogram  1  and  the  Government\u2019s  emerging \npriorities).  This  report  deals  mainly  with  subprogram  1,  but  some  indicative  components  of \nsubprogram 2 are also covered.  \n\n                                                 \n22 DAC is the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. \n23 The  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness  on  ownership,  harmonization,  alignment,  results  and  mutual \naccountability,  endorsed  by  60  partner  countries  and  more  than  50  multilateral  and  bilateral  development \ninstitutions (including ADB) provides the frame of reference for the program-based approach.   \n\n24 ADB.  2004.

Manila (TA 4637-Afghanistan \napproved on 26 August 2005). \n\n\f15 \n\nImportant Features \n\n \nB. \n \n60. \nAn  important  feature  of  the  cluster  program  is  the  tailoring  of  the  reform  program \napproach  to  the  circumstances  in  Afghanistan.  In  view  of  the  sharp  institutional  constraints, \nFMPARP  carefully  addresses  sequencing  considerations  by  emphasizing \ninstitutional \ndevelopment  under  subprogram  1.  Public  administration  reforms  will  provide  cross-cutting \nsupport to ministries and set the foundations for effectively fulfilling their institutional mandates. \nIn  addition,  a  relatively  large  grant  component  will  assist  in  developing  capacity.  Unless  this \ncapacity  is  developed  under  subprogram  1,  there  will  be  limited  scope  for  deepening  of \neconomic  reforms  or  even  ensuring  sustainability  of  reforms  to  be  further  pursued  under \nSubprogram 2. \n \n61. \nThe  FMPARP  will  serve  to  promote  good  governance  through  such  measures  as \nparticipatory budgeting, comprehensive and transparent budget formulation and execution, and \npromoting merit based appointments throughout the civil service. These reforms will enable the \ncountry  to  better  manage  the  transition  from  emergency  response  to  long-term  sustainable \ndevelopment.  Measures \nfinancial  management \naccountability  framework,  including  strengthening  of  fiduciary  controls,  will  help  reduce \ncorruption  and  the  diversion  of  resources  from  intended  recipients.  This  will  reassure  donors \nand  encourage  them  to  channel  more  resources  through  the  Government  budget,  in  turn, \nleading  to  further  institutional  strengthening  and  state  building,  which  is  essential  to  the \nconsolidation of peace. FMPARP will encourage the Government to adopt a more participatory \napproach  to  the  budgeting  process,  enhancing  ownership,  and  promoting  a  more  effective \nresource  allocation  process.  More  effective  allocation  of  public  resources  will  be  essential  for \npoverty reduction and the achievement of the MDGs. \n \nC. \n \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  overall \n\nProgram Loan \n\nimprove \n\nto \n\nObjectives \n\n1. \n \n62. \nThe FMPARP will develop systems and procedures\u2014supported by increased capacity\u2014\nto improve budget programming, strengthen resource mobilization, develop the civil service and \nenhance the monitoring of public finances.   \n \n\n2. \n\nGoals and Output \n\n \nFMPARP has three goals, to strengthen (i) fiscal management, (ii) public administration, \n63. \nand (iii) public financial management. To achieve the first goal, FMPARP will support improving \nthe budgeting framework, the public investment program, and revenue mobilization. To achieve \nthe  second  goal,  FMPARP  will  support  strengthening  civil  service  management,  provincial \nadministrations, and service delivery. To achieve the third goal, FMPARP will support improving \ntransparency and accountability across government and strengthening of treasury management.  \n \n64. \nlist  of  policy \nrecommendations  has  been  drawn  up.  The  development  policy  letter  and  a  set  of  proposed \ntime-bound policy actions are included in Appendix 6. The FMPARP framework is in Appendix 7 \nand the \u201cProgram Tree\u201d is in Appendix 8.  \n\nrounds  of  consultation \n\n(see  Appendix  5)  a \n\nFollowing  several \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n \n65. \nThe program loan (policy component) focuses on key measures to strengthen systems \nand procedures under fiscal management, implementation of the Civil Service Law, and public \nfinancial management. The proposals are fully consistent with the thrust of Government reforms \nas identified in the Ministry of Finance vision paper and other Government priority programs.  \n \n\na. \n\nStrengthening Fiscal Management \n \ni. \n\nImproving the Budgeting Framework \n\nlink  budget \n\n \nProper  Budget  Classification.  The  Public  Finance  and  Expenditure  Management \n66. \n(PFEM) Law was enacted in June 2005. FMPARP will support implementation of the law, which \nprescribes  roles  and  responsibilities  and  broad  policies  and  guidelines  consistent  with  sound \nbudget practices and overall financial management. It will support the preparation of the FY2007 \nbudget, which will be based on a new chart of accounts that will present expenditures according \nto  standard  government  financial  statistics  (GFS)  classifications,  including  classification  of \nfunctions of government (COFOG). Subprogram 1 of FMPARP will work with the Government to \nreconcile  the  current  classification  system,  which  accounts  for  operating  expenditures  by \n\u201cministry\u201d and development expenditures by \u201cprograms.\u201d  \n \n67. \nDeveloping a Medium-Term Budgeting Framework. The failure to link policy making \nand  planning  with  budgeting  may  be  the  most  important  factor  contributing  to  poor  budgeting \noutcomes.  MOF  is  seeking  to  develop  a  closer  link  between  the  ANDS,  the  PIPs,  and  the \nbudget.  Budget  programming  will  aim \nformulation  with  underlying \nto  (i) \nmacroeconomic  trends,  (ii)  allocate  resource  envelopes  across  sectors,  (iii)  prioritize  PIPs, \n(iv) strengthen  analysis  to  develop  public  expenditure  policies,  and  (v)  improve  evaluation  of \nbudget outcomes to achieve the goals of the ANDS.   \n \n68.  MOF is focusing on the preparation of multi-year frameworks, including a medium-term \nfiscal framework (MTFF) that sets expenditure and revenue targets over a 3-year  horizon and \ncan  base  planned  expenditure  on  anticipated  revenues.  The  introduction  of  3-year  rolling \nexpenditure  and  revenue  projections  under  the  MTFF  (Appendix  2)  will  underpin  the \ndevelopment  of  a  medium-term  budgeting  framework  (MTBF)  under  subprogram  1  (Appendix \n9). The MTBF is a useful public expenditure management tool that will ensure transparency and \naccountability, and support better-targeted resource allocations and more effective expenditure.  \n \n69. \nSubprogram  1  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  fiscal  coordination  committee  (FCC) \nthat  will  link  the  various  MOF  departments  involved  in  the  budget  process.  Subprogram  2  will \nbuild  on  the  MTBF  in  order  to  achieve  (i)  accurate  revenue  forecasts  and  aggregate  resource \nenvelope,  (ii)  effective  allocation  of  budgets  to  line  ministries,  and  (iii)  accurate  expenditure \nmonitoring.  Subprogram  2  will  support  the  adoption  of  best  practices  in  defining  expenditure \nceilings for spending units that are consistent with the multi-year framework. \n  \n70. \nIntegrating  Operating  and  Development  Budgets.  A  better  integration  of  the \noperating  and  development  budgets  is  another  key  step  to  improving  budget  outcomes.  The \nGovernment is committed to achieving a unified budget by FY2011.  \n \n71. \nDeveloping capacity to unify the budget will be a major challenge for Treasury officials.  \nIt will require moving from the current stage, where the budget is mainly based on donor-driven \n\n\f17 \n\nexpenditure,  to  the  next  stage,  where  donor  programs  are  channeled  into  the  general  budget \nthrough the TSA. In other words, the Treasury will have to manage to a move from a \u201csupply-\ndriven\u201d approach to development expenditure to a \u201cdemand-driven\u201d approach. This will require \nclear  articulation  of  sector  development  strategies  and  coordinated  sector-based  financial \nplanning  that  is  linked  to  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework,  as  well  as  a  responsive \ncentral\u2013provincial fiscal system. To begin this transformation, subprogram 1 will support budget \npreparation  measures  that  will  identify  the  operating  costs  of  development  projects  in  the \noperating  budget  using  a  multi-year  framework.  Subprogram  2  will  improve  the  alignment  of \noperating and development budgets by establishing the budget preparation guidelines that will \nlead to a fully unified national budget. \n \n72. \nAvoiding  Fiscal  Risks.  Effectively  managing  fiscal  risks  is  part  of  sound  fiscal \nmanagement. Fiscal risks typically arise from developments that are not properly accounted for \n(e.g.,  a  sudden  surge  in  oil  prices  or  a  state-owned  enterprise  that  defaults  on  a  payment). \nCorrective  actions  can  be  taken  through,  for  example,  midyear  budget  reviews  and \nsupplementary budgets. The strengthening of financial reporting requirements is a prerequisite \nfor  safeguarding  against  fiscal  risks.  State-owned  enterprises  will  be  required  to  strengthen \nfinancial reporting. Following on from an inventory of public enterprises and other Government \nentities  (including  Government  controlled  funds),  subprogram  1  will  establish  a  system  to \nmonitor revenues of these entities as well as subsidies and transfers to them. Subprogram 2 will \nconsolidate  these  entities  and  funds  through  closures  and  mergers.  Under  subprogram  2, \nguidelines on contingent liabilities, including guarantees, will be drawn up.  \n \n73.  Moving  towards  a  Participatory  Budget  Process.  Currently,  civil  society  and  the \nprivate sector have no formal role in budget formulation or in the development of public policy. \nHowever,  in  view  of  their  significant  involvement  in  funding  and  implementing  the  external \nfunded  budget,  donors  and  NGOs  are  asked  to  provide  information  on  the  following  year\u2019s \nexpenditure plans, and their link to public investment priorities. The consultative groups (CGs) \nprovide  forums  for  discussion  on  development  programs  and  associated  budgets,  and  these \nhave implications for succeeding operating budgets. With the establishment of Parliament, the \ndegree of scrutiny of the FY2006 and subsequent budgets will be much greater than in the past. \nGreater  stakeholder  consultation  will  be  encouraged  to  strengthen  overall  support  and  ensure \nswift  approval  of  the  budget.  Subprogram  1  will  help  the  Government  to  draft  a  time-bound \nstrategy and action plan that includes extensive consultation with key stakeholders in the budget \nprocess. Subprogram 2 will support approval and implementation of this action plan. \n \nSeparating Revenue and Treasury Functions at Moustufiats. To strengthen lines of \n74. \nresponsibilities and reporting requirements from the provinces to the center, the MOF proposes \nseparating revenue functions from payment and treasury functions. This will strengthen fiduciary \nresponsibilities  and  reduce  the  influence  of  \u201ccaptive\u201d  interests  at  the  provincial  level.  It  will \nthereby  (i)  limit  revenue  leakage,  and  (ii)  ensure  consistency  of  expenditures  according  to  the \npolicy  priorities  set  forth  in  the  national  budget.  Subprogram  1  will  support  the  preparation  of \nguidelines on the role of the moustufiats of the MOF, including clear lines of responsibilities on \nrevenue collection functions at provincial offices and at the Customs and Revenue Departments \nat MOF, and on payment and treasury functions at provincial offices and at the Director General \nof  Treasury.  Subprogram  1  will  also  prepare  a \nfor  phased \nimplementation  of  the  guidelines,  starting  with  seven  priority  moustufiats  and  covering  all \nprovinces by the time the guidelines are finalized under subprogram 2.  \n \n75. \nEnhancing Capacity for Fiscal Analysis. A fiscal policy unit (FPU) has recently been \nestablished  within  the  MOF.  In  line  with  international  best  practice,  subprogram  1  will  support \n\ntime-bound  action  plan \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nthe  strengthening  of  the  FPU  consisting  of  technical  experts  who  can  provide  objective \nassessments to the Minister of Finance.25 The FPU will be charged with preparing an MTFF\u2014\nand eventually an MTBF\u2014that is consistent with the underlying macroeconomic framework and \nthat  will  underscore  the  budget  process.  The  principal  responsibilities  of  the  FPU  will  include \n(i) general  budget  year  and  medium-term  fiscal  trend  analyses,  (ii)  assessments  of  the  fiscal \nsustainability of public expenditure policies, and, eventually, (iii) debt sustainability analyses.  \n \n76. \nIn addition to the main tasks referred to above, there is an urgent need for the FPU to \nanalyze the budgetary implications of the pay and grading system currently under review and its \nimpact on the wage and pensions bills. The FPU could provide input on the implications of the \neventual  phased-in  integration  of  expenditure  on  the  national  army\u2014which  is  currently  funded \nfrom external sources\u2014into the national budget. FPU could also provide analysis on revenues \nand  expenditures  by  province,  as  the  budget  process  will  need  to  address  subnational \nconsiderations, following the establishment of Parliament and provincial councils. FPU will also \nneed  to  consider  how  revenue  transfers  to  the  provinces  can  be  identified,  evaluated,  and \nmonitored.  Under  subprogram  2,  consideration  will  be  given  to  preparing  a  policy  paper  to \ndevelop an operating framework for inter-governmental revenue transfers.  \n \n77. \nIntroducing Performance Monitoring. At present, there are no performance indicators \nand limited capacity for budget evaluation or for determining whether public policy outcomes are \nbeing  achieved.  The  budget  process  and,  in  particular,  expenditures,  tend  to  follow  simple \nincremental  rules  based  on  notional  growth  rates.  Subprogram  1  will  support  the  piloting  of \nresult-based indicators in priority sectors such as energy, transport, and agriculture with a view \nto moving towards a more result-based budgeting system. Towards the end of subprogram 2, \nand  subject  to  progress  achieved,  MOF  may  be  able  to  link  performance  indicators  to  some \nbudget appropriations. \n \n\nii. \n\nImproving the Public Investment Program \n\n \n78. \nThe public investment program (PIP) is the key link between the ANDS and the budget. \nAccordingly,  successful  achievement  of  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  ANDS  will  depend  on \nthe formulation and successful implementation of the PIPs under the NPPs. The national priority \nprograms  (NPPs)  will  therefore  need  to  establish  clear  criteria  based  on  economic  returns, \nsocial  welfare  considerations,  or  other  objective  criteria  to  determine  prioritization  of  PIP. \nHowever,  ultimately  the  Budget  Committee  will  decide  on  which  PIPs  are  included  in  the \nBudget.  Subprogram  1  will  support  the  strengthening  of  the  Budget  Committee  so  it  can  (i) \nidentify investment programs and projects that are consistent with ANDS, (ii) establish a clear \nranking  system  for  such  programs  and  projects,  (iii)  classify  the  implementation  of  individual \nprograms and projects according to an overall risk assessment, and (iv) publish results.   \n \nSubprogram 1 will support efforts by the Budget Committee and MOF to (i) evaluate the \n79. \ncontribution  of  PIPs  to  the  MDGs,  (ii)  develop  a  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation \nframework  for  ANDS  and  PIPs,  and  (iii)  publish  an  analysis  of  results.  Subprogram  2  will \nconsider how performance can be linked to expenditure, and, in particular, how a performance-\nbased  fund  release  system  for  NPP  allocations  can  be  introduced.  This  will  enable  the \nGovernment  to  improve  its  assessment  of  policy  interventions  and  eventually  link  its \ndevelopment policies with expenditure and investment priorities and fiscal policies.  \n \n\n                                                 \n25 The  work  will  build  on  assistance  under  previous  TA4637-Afghanistan  (footnote  24)  that  will  allow  consultants  to \n\nenhance capacity for fiscal analysis. \n\n\f19 \n\niii. \n\nEnhancing Revenue Mobilization \n\n \n80. \nIn March 2005, the Government gazetted the Revenue Law, a major accomplishment in \nits  efforts  to  override  the  main  tax  holidays  granted  under  the  Investment  Law.  The  Revenue \nLaw  was  amended  in  September  2005  to  include  provisions  on:  (i)  access  powers,  penalties \nand  offenses,  collection  enforcement  powers,  and  record-keeping  requirements;  (ii)  corporate \ntax reforms and provisions for extractive industries; and (iii) a new airport departure fee (which \ncame  into  force  in  October  2005).  Subprogram  1  will  support  the  issuing  of  implementation \nprocedures for the Revenue Law and focus on strengthening enforcement measures.  \n \n81.   Subprogram  1  supports  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  of  consolidating  and  simplifying  tax \nmeasures,  including  reducing  the  \u201cnuisance\u201d  taxes  that  undermine  effective  tax  collection  and \ntaxpayer  morale.  FMPARP  will  support  ongoing  efforts  to  undertake  an  inventory  of  existing \ntaxes,  soukes  (licenses),  and  fees  at  the  provincial  level  as  a  means  of  moving  towards  a \nsimpler  tax  code  and  transferring  responsibility  to  MOF.  This  inventory  should  include  all  fees \nlevied  by  public  enterprises  or  administered  by  line  ministries.  The  focus  should  be  on  tax \nmeasures that are easy to implement and enforceable. Subprogram 2 will seek to build on these \nreforms and support an MOF study on consumption taxes and on the scope of a national value-\nadded tax (VAT).  \n \n82.  While the legislative framework for customs and revenue is being developed, increasing \nattention will have to be paid to tax administration and enforcement. Tax collectors need to be \ntrained  and  audit  capacity  developed,  based  on  carefully  focused  risk-based  assessments. \nImproving tax collection through a modernization action plan that will include: (i) establishing a \ntaxpayer  register;  (ii)  educating  citizens  through  mass  media  campaigns  on  the  importance  of \npaying  taxes;  (iii)  automating  tax  administration,  initially  at  the  large-taxpayer  office  and \nimportant  customs  checkpoints  through  a  tax  identification  number  (TIN)-based  system  of \nshared tax files; and (iv) following-up on registration and filing of businesses previously eligible \nfor  tax  holidays.  These  initiatives  will  be  supported  under  subprogram  1.  To  ensure  swift \nimplementation  of  the  modernization  plan,  subprogram  1  will  establish  some  intermediate \ntargets, including (i) 35,000 registered taxpayers with assigned TIN, (ii) requiring electronic tax \nfiling  by  the  50  largest  taxpayers,  and  (iii)  registering  at  least  1000  businesses  previously \neligible for tax holidays.   \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening Public Administration \n \ni. \n\nStrengthening Civil Service Management \n\n \n83. \nAction  Plan  for  Implementation  of  Phase  1  of  Civil  Service  Law.  A  detailed  2-year \nplan for the implementation of phase 1 (covering the first 2 years) of the Civil Service Law was \nfinalized by IARCSC. Phase 1 will focus on articles 22\u201324 of the law on reviewing, modifying, \ncreating  posts;  job  evaluation,  post  grading,  and  occupational  classifications;  merit-based \nrecruitment  and  selection;  appointments;  probation;  performance  management;  promotion; \nattendances;  leave;  transfers  and  secondments;  discipline;  appeals;  health,  welfare,  and  work \nenvironment; training and development; and termination of service. Implementation of the plan \nwill be supported under subprogram 1. \n \n84. \nIn  particular,  the  plan  provides  for:  (i)  setting  up  and  making  operational  an \nestablishment  register  and  human  resources  management  (HRM)  information  system  in  the \nMinistry  of  Public  Health,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  and  the  IARCSC;  (ii)  establishing  HRM \nunits  in  these  two  ministries;  and  (iii)  organizing  the  IARCSC  so  it  is  responsive  to  the \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nrequirements  of  the  law  and  its  supporting  regulations  and  procedures.  These  measures  will \ncreate  an  enabling  environment  for  the  MOF  and  IARCSC  to  reconcile  the  establishment \nregister, personnel data, and payroll data routinely. \n \nThe  law  requires  the  IARCSC  to  lead,  regulate,  formulate  and  implement  structural \n85. \npublic  administration  policies.  It  also  requires  the  Chairman,  IARCSC,  to  report  on  the \nperformance of the IARCSC to the President\u2019s Office. The plan makes provision for appropriate \nperformance management systems to be established and implemented progressively.  \n \n86. \nImplementation  of  Pay  and  Grading  Policy.  Policy  on  salary  and  allowances  will  be \ncritical and will require finalization and approval by Government. Although some work has been \nundertaken, MOF and IARCSC need to continue this before a draft policy can be submitted to \ncabinet for consideration and approval. In addition to determining the resource envelope for civil \nservice  pay  in  the  medium-term  budgeting  framework,  key  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed \ninclude  the  policy  on  surplus  staff  identified  by  the  priority  reforms  and  restructuring  (PRR) \nprogram; the interim additional allowance (IAA) and other temporary benefits provided through \nPRR;  and  policy  on  pensions.  The  IAA  introduced  by  the  PRR  process  is  too  expensive  for \nGovernment-wide  application.  This  makes  it  even  more  important  for  Government  to  consider \nthe  implications  of  any  further  roll-out  of  the  current  IAA  and  its  impact  on  the  changeover  to \npermanent salary and benefits arrangements. Subprogram 1 will support implementation of the \npay and grading policy and in particular the links with the activities in the plan.  \n \n87. \nThe  plan  takes  into  consideration  possible  delays  in  the  pay  and  grading  policy  and \nfocuses on laying the foundations for its implementation. It adopts a program-based approach to \nfacilitate  donor  coordination.  It  is  based  on  ministries  taking  responsibility  for  and  being  held \naccountable  for  implementation,  with  the  IARCSC  providing  the  framework,  guidance,  and \noversight.  Expected  results  after  24  months  are  deliberately  modest,  but  can  be  increased \nshould  the  enabling  operating  environment  improve.  With  support  from  the  World  Bank, \nIARCSC has identified a programmatic approach to building the institutional structure for public \nadministration.  This  identifies  building  blocks  which  will  be  financed  by  donors,  including  the \nWorld Bank, ADB, the European Commission, and DFID. Implementation of the plan, together \nwith other donor-funded activities, will support the Government\u2019s efforts to achieve its vision of \npublic administration in Afghanistan (Appendix 10).  \n \n\nii. \n\nImproving Provincial Administrations and Service Delivery \n\n \nThe  provincial  administrations  are  critical  to  effective  government  and  service  delivery. \n88. \nFMPARP  supports  the  institutional  strengthening  of  the  moustufiats.  More  generally,  the \nGovernment  needs  to  develop  a  strategy  on  the  role  of  Government  and  NGOs  in  service \ndelivery.  As  a  first  step,  a  law  governing  the  NGOs  was  approved  in  July  2005.  The  law \nprovides an operational framework for NGOs and focuses on the provision of social services. All \nNGOs are required to re-register by end of December 2005. This will improve understanding of \nthe  extent  to  which  NGOs  and  civil  society  are  involved  in  service  delivery.  While  it  is \nrecognized that NGOs have provided critical support at a time  when the Government was not \nable to provide alternatives, a better balance may be reached over the medium term, allowing \nthe  Government  to  encourage  competition  or  to  facilitate  access  to  service  delivery  for  other \nentrants. It may be helpful for the Government to establish minimum standards and to improve \nits  oversight  of  outsourced  service  delivery  providers.  Subprogram  2  will  support  measures  to \nimprove monitoring of the use of public resources as they are disbursed across the provinces, \nincluding  tracking  systems  to  gauge  how  provinces  are  faring  in  achieving  poverty  reduction \nobjectives and progress towards the MDGs. \n\n\f21 \n\nc. \n\nStrengthening Public Financial Management \n\n \n89. \nThe goal of the public financial management system is to ensure fiduciary standards are \nappropriately implemented. The Afghan public and international donors need to feel secure that \nGovernment resources and donor funds are being used for the purposes intended and that they \nare  subject  to  appropriate  allocation  and  expenditure  controls.  An  integral  part  of  this  goal  is \ncomplying  with  international  standards  of  financial  management,  including  the  use  of \ninternationally recognized accounting, auditing, and reporting standards. \n \n\ni. \n\nImproving  Accountability \nGovernment  \n\nand \n\nTransparency  Across \n\n \n90. \nThe PFEM Law lays the foundations for an improved financial accountability framework. \nSubprogram 1 will support measures to strengthen this framework. It will work with MOF and the \nControl and Audit Office (CAO) to develop government operations manuals that contain explicit \npolicies,  guidelines,  and  procedures  across  government.  Operations  manuals  will be  prepared \nto  support  public  financial  management,  including  planning  and  budgeting,  accounting  and \nfinancial reporting, and internal audit. The initial focus will be on the broad dissemination of the \nmanuals,  accompanied  by  training.  As  they  are  implemented  more  widely,  the  focus  under \nsubprogram  2  will  then  shift  to  the  internal  audit  process  and  assessment  of  procedural \ncompliance and the reliability of internal control measures. A risk-based internal audit strategy \nthat identifies high-risk activities and government entities will be needed.  \n \nIntegration  of  the  budget  and  accounting  systems  will  ensure  the  sustainability  of \n91. \nspending  by  strengthening  budget  management  and  accounting  controls.  Full  integration  of \nsystems  and  databases  will  also  improve  transparency  in  government  financial  reporting \n(including  reporting  of  the  Afghan  Reconstruction  Trust  Fund  [ARTF]  at  the  central  and \nprovincial levels). A fully automated payroll system, based on a verified payroll plan and linked \nto  a  human  resources  management  system,  will  support  full  budget  discipline  in  the \nimplementation of public administration reforms. Integration of revenue administration systems \nwill  support  improved  fiscal  and  cash  management  by  strengthening  monthly  revenue  and \nexpenditure reporting that incorporates transactions processed in provinces. Integration of debt \nmanagement  will  improve  fiscal  and  cash  management.  Integration  will  require  a  carefully \nplanned and structured approach that recognizes the level of capacity and practical challenges \nfaced  in  Afghanistan.  Subprogram  2  will  pilot  implement  selected  modules  under  IGFMIS  in \nMOF and selected ministries and provinces. \n \n92.  MOF,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank,  is  undertaking  a  study  to  define  the  overall \nsystems  architecture  to  support  the  Afghanistan  financial  management  information  system \n(AFMIS) at central, provincial, and possibly district levels in Afghanistan, which will be used for \nimplementation.  An  appropriately  structured,  phased  and  manageable \nits  phased \nimplementation  plan \ntoward  a  more \ncomprehensive  IGFMIS.  Subprogram  1  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  a \nphased strategy for implementation of the IGFMIS (Appendix 11), through review of accounting \npolicies and cash management practices with a view to ensuring integration. \n \n93. \nSubprogram  2  will  also  support  enactment  of  fiscal  management  responsibility \nlegislation. This will strengthen the Government\u2019s commitment to fiscal discipline and strengthen \naccountability to Parliament and the public at large.   \n \n\nfor  AFMIS  will  help  coordinate  donor  support \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\nii. \n\nStrengthening Treasury Management  \n\n \n \n94. \nStrengthening cash and debt management under subprogram 1 will improve the orderly \nexecution of the budget by making resources available in a more timely way and reducing public \ndebt  charges.  Cash  management  will  be  strengthened  through  the  integration  of  cash  flow \nmanagement  system  with  the  treasury  accounting  system  (AFMIS).  This  will  enable  improved \nand more efficient tracking of the TSA and provincial cash flows, and preparation of cash flow \nforecasts for management review purposes. It will thereby assist in the reconciling of accounts. \nDebt management will be strengthened through a debt strategy and a policy on guarantees, and \nthe integration of the debt management system with the AFMIS under subprogram 2. Integration \nof the systems will enable proper recording and reporting of debt and guarantees, and regular \nanalysis of debt management performance.  \n \n95. \nIn accordance with discussions with the IMF, the Government will consider the possible \npiloting  of  a  treasury  bills  market.  The  introduction  over  the  medium-term  of  Afghani-\ndenominated, tradable, treasury bills will strengthen cash management. A treasury bills market \nunderwritten by a fiscal management law and a continued commitment to fiscal discipline would \nalso assist in the development of an interest rate structure. In turn, this would be an important \nstep  toward  the  establishment  of  a  benchmark  to  price  other  debt  and  would  promote  the \ndevelopment of the financial markets more generally. Over the longer term, this will lead to more \nmarket  discipline  in  Government  spending  and  better  asset-liability  management  capacity  at \ncommercial  banks  and  other  prime  subscribers.  Subprogram  1  will  support  MOF  to  prepare  a \npolicy paper on treasury bills. Subject to the recommendations of the paper, subprogram 2 may \nconsider piloting a treasury bills auction market. \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n96. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  Program  loan  of  $48 million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources to support the Government\u2019s policy reforms. The borrower will be the Islamic \nRepublic  of  Afghanistan.  The  loan  will  be  made  on  concessional  terms  based  on  the  ADB \nDisaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy,26  which  provides  for  a  40-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 10 years, an interest charge of 1% per annum during the repayment period and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The total amount of the \ninterest charge during the grace period will be capitalized and charged to the loan account. \n \n97. \n$51 million and include the following: \n \n\nThe  costs  of  the  reforms  under  the  FMPARP  are  tentatively  estimated  at  about \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nimplementation of phase 1 of the Civil Service Law ($23 million), \nimplementation of restructuring of moustufiats ($8 million), \ninstitutional strengthening of Budget Department ($5 million), \nrestructuring  of  the  Treasury  Department,  including  an  improved  financial \naccountability  framework  covering  state-owned  enterprises  and  funds  ($4 \nmillion), \nmodernization of the revenue administration ($4 million), \nimplementation of performance audits of key departments ($2.5 million), \nfinancing the issuance (interest payment) of pilot treasury bills ($2.5 million), and \nestablishment of a fiscal policy unit ($2 million). \n\n \n\n                                                 \n26 ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila (approved on 1 June 2004). \n\n\f23 \n\n5. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  of  the  FMPARP  will  be  the  MOF.  The  Deputy  Minister  of \n98. \nFinance for Budget and Treasury Management will be the focal point and will work closely with \nthe  Deputy  Minister  of  Finance  for  Revenue  and  Customs,  the  Deputy  Minister  of  Finance  for \nAdministration, and the Director General of Civil Service Management. MOF will set up an inter-\nagency  implementation  and  coordination  committee  (IICC)  headed  by  the  Deputy  Minister  of \nFinance-Budget  and  Treasury  Management  and  comprising  representatives  from  the  Budget \nDepartment,  Treasury  Department, \nfiscal  policy  unit,  Revenue  Department,  Customs \nDepartment,  Public  Enterprises  Department,  and  IARCSC.  Heads  of  Moustufiats  of  major \nprovinces  (provincial  offices  of  the  MOF  responsible  for  revenue  collection  and  carrying  out \ntreasury functions) will be co-opted as a member as and when necessary. ADB will be invited to \nattend  the  IICC  meetings  on  a  \u201cas  needs  basis\u201d  when  relevant  issues  are  to  be  discussed. \nRegular  reporting  of  minutes  of  IICC  will  be  provided  to  ADB.  The  IICC  will  meet  at  least \nquarterly  to  monitor,  coordinate  and  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  the  proposed \nreforms. \n \n99. \neffective implementation and coordination of the consulting inputs.  \n \n\nA  program  director  (a  domestic  consultant)  will  be  funded  under  the  grant  to  oversee \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n \n100.  The  implementation  period  of  the  Program  will  be  3  years.  It  will  be  completed  by \nDecember 2008. \n \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Withdrawal Procedure \n\n \n101.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \nduties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources (Appendix 12). In \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements \nfor Program Loans,27 the proceeds of the Program loan will be disbursed to the Islamic Republic \nof Afghanistan as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, if, during \neach  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  total \nimports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \nunder other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during that year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify \nthe  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s  certification.  It  is  expected  that  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \nutilized over a period of 36 months from the date of loan effectiveness.  \n \n\nd. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n102.  The Government will use the local currency funds generated by the FMPAR loan to meet \nFMPAR expenditures and associated costs of reform. In particular, MOF shall ensure to allocate \nfor  IARCSC  sufficient  resources  to  be  able  to  implement  its  part  of  the  FMPAR  subject  to \nsatisfactory performance by IARCSC. \n                                                 \n27 ADB.  1995.

The loan will be released in two equal tranches of $24 million each.28 The first tranche \nwill  be  disbursed  upon  loan  effectiveness  or  shortly  thereafter,  subject  to  Government\u2019s \ncompliance  with  all  prior  actions  under  the  FMPARP.  The  second  tranche  is  expected  to  be \nreleased within 24 months from release of the first tranche, subject to satisfactory compliance \nwith  second  tranche  release  conditions.  Following  the  second  tranche  release,  activities \n(including grant support) will focus on laying the foundations for subprogram 2. \n \n\nf. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n104.  The program director, who will serve as secretary to the IICC, will establish and maintain \na  program  performance  monitoring  system  that  will  include  a  database  on  the  status  of  policy \nmeasures  and  program  indicators,  based  on  the  policy  matrix.  This  will  be  linked  with  the \nprogram performance management system (para.115).  \n \n\ng. \n\nProgram Review  \n\n \n105.  ADB  will  monitor  program  implementation  through  quarterly  reviews  and  periodic \nprogress reports. These will help to identify further actions to improve fiscal management, public \nadministration, and financial management. In addition, the Government and ADB will conduct a \ncomprehensive  midterm  review  at  the  end  of  year  2  to  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  reform \nmeasures and their impact on fiscal management. A review of subprogram 1 will also take place \nat the end of year 3. That review will recommend a more refined set of indicative policy actions \nand set the course for subprogram 2. \n \n\nh. \n\nAccounting, Auditing and Reporting \n\n \n106.  Loan closing date is 2015, or the end of the grace period. An audit of the use of the loan \nproceeds will be undertaken if requested by ADB. ADB retains the right to (i) audit any account, \nand  (ii)  verify  the  validity  of  the  certification  issued  by  the  Government  for  each  withdrawal \napplication. Prior to withdrawal, the Government will open an account at Da Afghanistan Bank \n(DAB or The Central Bank) to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated \nand liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nD. \n \n\nThe Grant \n\n1. \n\nObjective \n\n \n107.  The  grant  for  the  Capacity  Building  for  Institutional  Development  Project  will  support \ncapacity building initiatives for the MOF and IARCSC to support effective implementation of the \nProgram loan and develop capacity through training activities.   \n \n    \n \n108.  There will be four areas of support under the Project:  \n \n\nFocus and Outputs \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n28 The  actual  disbursement  under  the  second  tranche  will  be  $24  million  minus  the  estimated  capitalized  interest \n\ncharge during the grace period. \n\n \n\n\f25 \n\n(i) \n\nComponent I: Strengthening the Budget Process.   \n(a) \n\n(b) \n(c) \n\nStrengthening  the  link  between  ANDS,  PIPs,  and  the  medium-term \nbudgeting framework (MTBF). \nSupporting budget appraisal. \nSupporting  the  identification  and  monitoring  of  results-based  indicators \nwith a view to developing foundations for results-based budgeting (focus \non agriculture, energy and transport sectors). \n\nComponent II: Strengthening the Capacity of the Moustufiats.  \nImplementing restructuring plans for the moustufiats.  \n(a) \nDeveloping  operations  manuals \n(b) \nfunctions.  \nCapacity building for revenue and treasury operations at the  moustufiats \nthrough on-the-job training, workshops (including on-site training, regional \nworkshops, and training in Kabul).  \n\nimprove  revenue  and \n\ntreasury \n\n(c) \n\nto \n\n(iii)   Component III: Implementing the Civil Service Law.  \nCross-cutting support to program management.  \nSupport for human resource management, communication policy, and \nperformance management.  \n\n(a) \n(b) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iv) \n \n\nComponent IV: Unallocated Pool of Funds.  \nThis will be used for short-term assignments and may include:  \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n\na cash management expert, \nan accounting policy expert, \na contingent liabilities fiscal expert, \na treasury bills development expert, and \nothers to be defined later. \n\n \n109. \nIt is proposed that separate international consulting firms be recruited by ADB to execute \ncomponents  I\u2013III.  Under  component  II,  a  capacity  development  unit  consisting  of  international \nand  domestic  consultants  will  be  established.  It  will  have  two  sub-units:  sub-unit  I  will  support \nTreasury  operations  and  sub-unit  II  will  support  revenue  operations  at  the  moustufiat  level. \nUnder  component  IV,  a  pool  of  unallocated  resources  will  be  available  to  support  the \nimplementation of the FMPARP. The EA through the program director\u2014in association with the \ninterested departments and in consultation with the ADB\u2014will be responsible for identifying and \nrecruiting individual consultants under Component IV. The program director will provide overall \ngrant  coordination,  backstopping  support  and  will  assist  in  identifying  and  recruiting  additional \nconsultants  to  be  defined  at  a  later  stage  (see  Appendix  13).  This  arrangement  will  provide \ngreater  flexibility  in  use  of  consulting  resources,  drawing  from  lessons  learned  in  Section  III \nabove. \n \n\n3. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n\n \n110.  The  total  cost  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $7.3 million  equivalent,  including \ncontingencies. It comprises $6.1 million in foreign exchange cost and $1.2 million equivalent in \nlocal currency cost. A summary of cost estimates is given in Table 1. ADB will contribute a grant \nof  $7  million  to  the  Project,  to  be  funded  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  and  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGovernment  will  contribute  $300,000  in  kind.

MOF in association with IARCSC will oversee and coordinate the implementation of the \nProject through (i) the IICC, headed by the Deputy Minister of Finance for Budget and Treasury \nManagement  and  comprising  senior  representatives  of  the  fiscal  management  team  and \nselected  public  administration  institutions  (see  para.  98  for  the  composition  of  the  IICC);  and \n(ii) a program director (a domestic consultant) recruited under the grant, who will  report to the \nDeputy Minister of Finance. The program director will have the authority in coordination with the \nDeputy Minister of Finance and IICC to make decisions essential to ensuring the progress of the \nProgram  loan  and  grant,  including  facilitating  coordination  with  the  ADB  Afghanistan  Resident \nMission  and  ADB  headquarters  on  implementation,  assisting  with  selecting  and  recruiting \nconsultants  under  components  I  to  III,  and  recruiting  consultants  under  component  IV.  The \nprogram  director  will  submit  quarterly  reports  in  compliance  with  international  accounting \npractices  and  will  ensure  internal  controls.  Activities  related  to  specific  components  of  fiscal \nmanagement  will  fall  under  the  responsibility  of  the  respective  directors  general  in  MOF  while \nthose in public administration will come under the responsibility of the Chairman of the IARCSC.  \n\n                                                 \n29 According  to  ADB\u2019s  Extension  of  the  Waiver  of  the  Cost-Sharing  Limits  for  Loans  and  TA  Operations  for \nAfghanistan, (January 2005, R60-05), due to Afghanistan\u2019s precarious economic and fiscal situation, the waiver of \nthe  cost-sharing  limits  for  ADB  loans  and  TA  operations  be  extended  for  a  further  2-year  period  covering  2005\u2013\n2006. \n\n\f27 \n\n \n\nb. \n\n \n \n \n112.  The implementation period of the grant will be 3 years. It will be completed by December \n2008. \n \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\nc. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nThe  grant  for  the  Capacity  Building  for  Institutional  Development  Project  will  finance  a \n113. \ntotal  of  up  to  31  experts,  representing  172  person-months  of  international  and  300  person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services (Appendix 13). Consulting services will comprise $5.61 \nmillion  of  the  total  $7.3  million  available  under  the  grant.  All  international  and  domestic \nconsultants under components I-III will be engaged by ADB, while all international and domestic \nconsultants  under  Component  IV  will  be  engaged  by  the  EA  through  the  program  director,  in \nclose consultation with the EA and ADB. Up to 50% of the total costs of the consulting services \nare  to  be  allocated  for  recruitment  by  quality-based  selection  (QBS)  because  (i) the  security \nrisks  in  Afghanistan  warrant  special  considerations  in  terms  of  selection  and  recruitment  of \nconsultants, especially in provincial posts; (ii) institutional constraints in Afghanistan pose risks \nfor the favorable outcome of the FMPARP and, therefore, quality-based consulting inputs, which \nare critical in capacity-building initiatives under FMPARP, need to override other considerations; \n(iii) the assignments are complex, highly specialized and process oriented, which does not allow \nthe writing of very detailed terms of reference; and (iv) there is a high downstream impact and \nrisk  of  Program  failure  if  the  best  consultants  are  not  selected.  QBS  recruitment  will  apply  to \nComponents  I  and  II  and  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  for  components  III  and  IV.  All \ninternational and domestic consultants will be engaged in accordance with the ADB Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  The  Government  of  Afghanistan  will  be  responsible  for  funding  project \nadministration, including counterpart staff, office space and secretarial support. All other funding \nof consultants will be financed by ADB.  \n \n \n \nImmediately  after  grant  effectiveness,  MOF  (the  EA)  will  establish  an  imprest  account \n114. \nwith DAB, denominated in US dollars. The imprest account will be operated and maintained in \naccordance with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Loan  Disbursement.30\n  The  initial  advance  to  the  imprest \naccount will not exceed the equivalent of 6 months\u2019 estimated expenditure, or 10% of the loan \namount, whichever is lower. The imprest account may be used to pay contractors, suppliers and \nothers for ADB\u2019s share of eligible project expenditures, incurred in local or foreign currency. The \nADB statement of expenditures procedure will be used to reimburse or to liquidate and replenish \nthe imprest account for individual payments not exceeding $50,000. \n \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\nd. \n\n \n\ne. \n\nAccounting, Auditing and Reporting \n\n \n115.  The Program Director will send quarterly progress reports on the Project to ADB within 1 \nmonth of the end of each quarter in accordance with ADB\u2019s Program Performance Management \nSystem (PPMS) Guidelines.31 The Government will maintain records and accounts for the grant \nexpenditure, in accordance with sound accounting principles and will have such accounts and \n\n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2001.

The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nsubmission of project reports, audited accounts, and financial statements are in compliance with \nADB's guidelines. Audited annual accounts, by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 6 months of the reporting period. The annual audit will include an audit \nof the imprest account and a statement of expenditure procedures. A separate audit opinion on \nthe use of the imprest account and a statement of expenditure procedures should be included in \nthe Annual Audit Report. \n \n\nf. \n\nProject Review  \n\n \n116.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  periodically  review  project  implementation.  The  reviews \nwill include evaluation of the Project scope, implementation arrangements, consultation with the \nMOF  and  the  program  director,  progress  with  the  policy  reform  agenda,  and  capacity  building \nmeasures. ADB will also field regular review missions, including a midterm review mission, and \nproject completion review missions. A comprehensive mid-term review at the end of year 2 will \nbe undertaken to evaluate actual and financial progress. Based on this review, modifications and \nimprovements will be considered. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\n \nA. \n \n117.  The  FMPARP  will  strengthen  public  finances  in  Afghanistan,  including  improving \ncapacity  to  carry  out  the  reform  agenda  according  to  the  policy  outcomes  identified  under \nSection IV.  \n \n118. \nIt  will  develop  an  enabling  environment  within  the  MOF  and  IARCSC  and  gradually \nacross  provincial  counterparts  that  will  improve  capacity  to  (i)  collect  revenues  efficiently, \n(ii) direct  public  resources  to  meet  priority  needs,  and  (iii)  monitor  the  flow  of  resources  and \nevaluate the impact of public spending. \n \n119.  FMPARP will support fiscal management and public administration reforms that are key \npillars  of  the  Government\u2019s  overall  reform  program.  These  reforms  will  enable  the  country  to \nmanage  the  transition  from  responding  to  emergency  needs  and  recovery-related  growth  to \nlong-term  sustainable  development. \nfinancial \nImprovements \nmanagement, and fiduciary control mechanisms are likely to encourage more donors to channel \nfunding  through  the  Government  budget.  This  will,  in  turn,  lead  to  further  institutional \nstrengthening and state building, which is essential to the consolidation of peace.  \n \n120.  FMPARP will encourage the Government to adopt a more participatory approach to the \nbudgeting process, enhancing ownership, and promoting more efficient resource allocation and \nthe achievement of the MDGs. A more efficient allocation of public resources will be essential \nfor  poverty  reduction.  Beneficiaries  of  public  goods  and  services  will  include  lower-income \ngroups  and  individuals  below  the  poverty  line  (see  Appendix  14  for  the  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy). \n \n121.  Direct beneficiaries will include the Government itself, which will benefit from time-bound \npolicy  actions  that  will  lead  to  defined  outcomes.  Other  beneficiaries  will  include  government \nofficials  who  will  gain  valuable  experience  from  working  with  consultants  in  implementing  the \nreform agenda and who will benefit from direct training under the capacity building component \n\nthe  budget  process, \n\nin \n\n\f29 \n\nRisks  \n\nfrom  clearer,  simplified,  and  more  balanced \n\nof  the  FMPARP.  NGOs  will  benefit  over  the  longer  term,  as  a  system  of  standards  will  be \ndeveloped under subprogram 2 to strengthen the outsourcing of service delivery. \n \n122.  Over  the  longer  term,  the  policy  reforms  will  be  deepened  under  subprogram  2. \nFMPARP  will  serve  to  strengthen  governance  in  Afghanistan,  including  supporting  greater \ninvolvement of the state in raising revenues and financing development needs. Taxpayers and \nimporters  will  benefit \ntax  and  customs \nadministration.  In  addition,  the  people  most  dependent  on  the  provision  of  public  goods  and \nservices, including people living in remote areas, should expect an eventual improvement in the \nquality of these services as a result of reduced waste, duplication, and other nonproductive use \nof public resources.   \n \n123.  FMPARP  is  classified  as  category  C  under  ADB\u2019s  environmental  classification  system. \nIts environmental impact is expected to be minimal. FMPARP will not trigger ADB\u2019s policies on \ninvoluntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. \n \nB. \n \n124.  Risks to FMPAR are multiple and can be classified according to the Program\u2019s ability to \naffect or mitigate these risks.  \n \n125.  External  risks  include:  (i)  security,  (ii)  political,  and  (iii)  macroeconomic  risks.  Internal \nrisks include: (i) capacity constraints, (ii) governance, and (iii) donor coordination.   \n \n126.  Security concerns pose the largest risk. A worsening security situation would have many \nimpacts  on  the  FMPARP,  including  limiting  extending  reforms  to  the  subnational  level  of \ngovernment.  If  the  security  situation  deteriorates,  operations  will  be  restricted  and  fielding \nconsults  and  monitoring  will  be  more  difficult.  Political  risks  appear  to  be  contained,  following \nsuccessful parliamentary and provincial elections. However, in a more politicized environment, \ndecisive policy decisions may not be based on technical merit alone. Macroeconomic risks have \ndecreased, following significant progress in building supporting infrastructure to ensure effective \nmacroeconomic  management  and  overall  improvement  to  the  macroeconomic  stability \nframework.  \n \n127.  Capacity  constraints  are  the  most  significant  internal  risks,  because  of  the  limited \navailability of skilled resources to implement the reform program. Governance risks include the \npower  of  vested  interests.  Revenue  administration  officials  may  be  co-opted  by  interests  that \nrefuse to embrace change or by enterprises that want to override the legal system. There may \nalso be scope for corruption. Donor coordination risks are acute in Afghanistan, where there is a \nsignificant donor presence in most ministries. Unless there is strong Government ownership of \nthe reforms, combined with well coordinated programs, there is a risk of duplication ineffective \nassistance. \n \n128.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  in  the  following  ways.  FMPARP  will  develop  human \nresource  management  policies  across  key  ministries  that  would  directly  address  the  weak \ncapacity.  The  grant  component  is  particularly  designed  to  enhance  capacity  and  institutional \ndevelopment. \n \n129. \ntailored  set  of  policy  reforms \nsubprogram 1 and ensuring these are built upon in subprogram 2.  \n\nIn  addition, the  policy  framework  design  has  factored  in  potential  risks by  presenting  a \nfoundations  under \n\nfocused  on  developing \n\ninstitutional \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \nA. \n \n\n \n\n \n130.  FMPARP  will  support  efforts  to  reduce  macroeconomic  risks  by  improving  revenue \ncollection and supporting measures to improve fiscal discipline. In addition, enhancing revenue \nmobilization  will  reduce  the  risk  of  disruption  and  dependency  on  foreign  assistance  over  the \nmedium term, as other development challenges outside Afghanistan may arise.    \n \n131.  Safeguards  include  coordinated  and  complementary  reform  programs  supported  by \nother donors (para. 57). \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe Program \n\n1. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n132.

The core \nbudget reflects funds that are channeled through the Government\u2019s treasury account, including \nGovernment revenue collection and semi- or fully discretionary donor funding through budgetary \nsupport  programs  that  covers  mostly  operating  expenditures.  The  external  budget  is  wholly \ndonor-funded  and  is  channeled  directly  to  consulting firms,  nongovernment  organizations,  and \nother implementing parties. The external budget covers the development budget and operating \ncosts associated with capital spending.   \n \n2. \nThe  first  post-conflict  national  budget  for  Afghanistan  (fiscal  year  [FY]  2005)  was \nadopted by presidential decree in June 2004\u2014about 3 months after the start of the fiscal year \n(FY) on 21 March. This was followed by a midyear review of the national development budget \napproved in December 2004. The Government approved its operating budget for FY2006 on 15 \nMarch  2005,  before  the  start  of  the  fiscal  year.  This  was  an  important  achievement,  as  it \nenabled  the  Government  to  address  payment  delays  and  operating  expenditure  arrears  that \noccurred  the  previous  year.  An  interim  development  budget  was  approved  on  2  April  2005  to \nensure  continuity  of  funding  to  ongoing  development  projects.  The  final  development  budget \nwas approved in June 2005 to incorporate additional donor-funded projects. A midyear review of \nthe FY2006 budget was finalized in November 2005. \n \nThe  external  development  budget  is  a  commitment  of  resources  based  on  a  list  of \n3. \nindividual  projects  that  are  classified  under  three  pillars:  pillar  1\u2014human  capital;  pillar  2\u2014\ninfrastructure;  and  pillar  3\u2014enabling  environment,  for  development.  These  three  pillars  are \nbroken into 16 consultative working groups composed of government officials and donors, and 6 \ncrosscutting  advisory  groups.  Because  of  differences  in  donors\u2019  budget  cycles,  commitments \nare not available before the start of Afghanistan\u2019s fiscal year. As a result, the resource envelope \nremains  an  indicative  figure.  This  explains  why  an  interim  development  budget  is  approved \nbefore the final development budget.   \n \n4. \nIn the revised FY2006 budget, the total planned expenditure is estimated at $5.7 billion \n(approximately  82%  of  GDP),  of  which  $4.8  billion  (84%  of  total)  will  be  for  the  development \nbudget and $693 million (14% of total) will be for the operating budget (Table A2.1). Of the total \nplanned development expenditure, approximately $1 billion or 21% will be disbursed through the \ncore  budget  and  $2.2  billion  or  46%  directly  by  donors  to  implementing  agencies,  leaving  a \nfunding gap of $1.6 billion or of 33% of the total. According to the revised FY2006 budget, 58% \nof the total budget is allocated for pillar 3 (up from 48% last year), compared with 27% for pillar \n2, and 14% for pillar 1. Allocations for both pillars 1 and 2 have declined since last year.    \n \n5. \nAbout two-thirds of the operating budget is funded by domestic revenues and the other \nthird  from  ARTF  and  LOTFA  (Table  A2.2).  The  operating  budget  is  nominally  in  balance1  and \nfiscal  expansion  remains  subject  to  prudent  growth  rates.  This  reflects  a  limited  absorptive \ncapacity, unstable security conditions, and an overstretched cadre of qualified civil servants. At \nthe same time, this shows potential for domestic revenue generation. A contingency provision of \nnearly $17 million is meant to operate as a reserve for unplanned expenditures within the year, \nand to maintain fiscal discipline. There is also a multiyear reserve of $183 million for the funding \n\n                                                 \n1  Excluding grants, the operating budget is approximately 10% of GDP.  \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n Expenditure  \n\nof  multiyear  contracts.  Key  expenditure  items  such  as  funding  of  the  Afghan  National  Army \n(ANA)  and  the  police  are  outside  the  budget  despite  government  commitment  to  bring  them \ngradually into the budget over the coming years. \n   \nB. \n \n6. \nUnder  the  core  budget  (Table  A3.3),  wages  and  salaries  comprise  62%  of  operating \nexpenditures.  In  the  past,  wages  and  salaries  had  been  growing  at  above  30%  per  year  and \ncontributing to mounting fiscal stress. The rapid expansion of priority reform and restructuring, \nand  the  spillover  effects  on  wages  and  salaries  of  other  civil  servants,  in  part  to  offset  steep \nincreases  in  housing  rentals,  may  explain  these  rapid  increases.  Purchase  of  goods  and \nservices  are  the  next  most  important  item,  accounting  for  close  to  20%  of  operating \nexpenditures. Finally, transfers and subsidies, and pension payments remain small at under 3% \nof operating expenditure, reflecting the limited safety nets in Afghanistan. \n \n7. \nAccording  to  the  FY2006  midyear  budget  review,  operating  expenditure  for  FY2006  is \nprojected  to  increase  to  10%  of  GDP  from  9.4%  of  GDP  in  FY2005.  This  is  a  contained \nincrease,  in  line  with  the  operating  principles  on  fiscal  prudence  set  forth  in  the  budget,  and \ncomes against the backdrop of a 22% increase in nominal GDP and a 19% increase in domestic \nrevenue. Planned development expenditure under the midyear FY 2006 budget is $4.8 billion, \ncompared with $4.4 billion at the time of budget approval.  \n \n8. \nThe  budget  for  FY2006  was  developed  under  a  new  chart  of  accounts  that  will  allow \nfunctional  classification  according  to  expenditure  items  in  the  following  year.  In  the  meantime, \noperating  expenditures  are  accounted  for  by  the  ministries,  while  development  expenditure  is \nreported by program. The breakdown of expenditures in the FY2006 operating budget reveals \nthat the Afghan National Army and National Police and Enforcement account for approximately \n43% of the total operating expenditure of ministries and agencies. This is followed by education \nand vocational training at approximately 20%, and health and nutrition at below 5%. \n \nC. \n \nThe  total  operating  revenues  for  FY  2006  is  projected  at  $816  million.  This  comprises \n9. \ndomestic revenue (tax and non-tax) collection, projected at $468 million (equivalent to 6.8% of \nGDP),  ARTF  funds  for  $280  million,  and  LOTFA  funds  for  $68  million.  Funding  to  and \nallocations  from  the  Counter-Narcotics  Trust  Fund  are  still  to  be  determined.  Total  revenue  in \nFY2006 is projected to increase by 46% compared to the previous year.  \n \n10.  MOF  is  currently  implementing  a  five-year  tax  administration  plan  with  donor  funding \navailable for the first 3 years. Under the plan, the large-taxpayer office will become operational. \nThe  office  will  remove  impediments  to  revenue  collection  by  removing  nuisance  taxes  and \neliminating tax holidays and other exemptions. In addition, tax identification numbers (TIN) will \nbe  issued  more  vigorously  to  facilitate  compliance  with  and  enforcement  of  tax  laws.  As  of \nSeptember  2005,  nearly  19,000  TINs  have  been  issued  in  Kabul  and  close  to  6,000  in  the \nprovinces. Money changers, customs brokers licensing processes, and motor vehicle purchase \nwill now require TIN registration.  \n \n11. \nAn  amendment  to  the  Revenue  Law  was  approved  in  May  2005.  Under  the  law,  the \ncorporate  tax  rate  is  set  at  20%  for all  businesses.  Income  tax  is  set  at  a  two-tier  structure  of \n10% for annual income of up to AF1.2 million and 20% for income over AF1.2 million. The tax-\nfree  income  tax  threshold  is  set  at  AF150,000  per  annum.  Withholding  tax  on  wages  will  be \n\n Revenues \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\nimposed. \u201cServices\u201d and \u201crental services\u201d taxes were also introduced. The services tax is a 10% \nbusiness  receipts  tax  on  the  gross  receipt  of  service  providers  in  telecommunications, \nrestaurants  and  hotels,  while  the  rental  services  tax  creates  a  legal  withholding  obligation  on \nlegal entity tenants, to eliminate non-reporting on rental income by property owners. \n \n12. \nDespite the measures adopted, taxes on international trade continue to take the largest \nshare, and account for approximately 70% of total tax collection. Revenue collection is uneven, \nwith the provinces of Herat, Kabul, Kandahar, and Nangarhar accounting for nearly 60% of total \nrevenue collection (see Table A2.4 for a breakdown of expenditure and revenue by provinces).  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Afghanistan National Budget \n($ million) \n \n\n \n\n  \n\nChange \n\nFY2006 \nBudget \n\nTotal Core budget (B+C) \n\nFY2006 \nMYR \nBudget \n\nCompensation of Employees \nNon wage \n\nDiscretionary Projects Expenditures \nNon discretionary Projects Expenditures \nReserve \n\nB2.

The  NDF  contains  a  list  of  16  national  priority  programs  (NPPs),  with  one  consultative \ngroup  (CG)  for  each  national  program.  Additionally,  six  advisory  groups  have  been  established  for \ncrosscutting issues (gender, environment, humanitarian affairs, human rights, monitoring and evaluation, \nand  counter-narcotics).  The  CGs  consists  of  representatives  of  ministries,  donors,  and  implementing \npartners. The main tasks of the CGs are to (i) advise the Government on the development of long-term \nstrategic policies for the 16 NPPs, including identifying resources necessary for policy development; (ii) \ncoordinate  the  implementation  of  programs  and  projects  through  the  annual  budget  cycle;  (iii)  monitor \nand  evaluate  implementation;  and  (iv)  facilitate  information  sharing.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  chairs  the \nConsultative Group Standing Committee (CGSC). \n \n \n\nFigure A4:  Current Consultative Group Structure \n\nAfghanistan Development Forum (ADF) (National Budget) \n\n \n\nConsultative Group Standing Committee (CGSC)\n\nConsultative Groups \n\nAdvisory Groups \nCross Cutting Issues \n\nPillar 2** \n\n2.1.

While some \nCGs  meet  regularly,  others  meet  sporadically.  Some  focus  on  information-sharing  about  the  budget \nprocess,  others  engage in  policy  and  strategy  issues.  The review  revealed  that  the  CGs\u2019  effectiveness \nsuffered because of poor leadership, lack of clear understanding as to their purpose, and lack of support \nto  capacity  building  for  policy  development,  program  monitoring,  and  management  of  the  CG  process \nwithin ministries. Much of the discussions of the CGs focused on the budget process, while inadequate \nattention was paid to policy, program development, and prioritization. \n \n3. \nAs a large proportion of the development budget is outside the Government\u2019s direct control and \ndisbursed directly to implementing partners, a forum for consultation with donors and other stakeholders \nis crucial to ensure that the assistance is directed toward the Government\u2019s priorities. The Government \nintends  to  review  the  CG  structure  as  part  of  the  national  development  strategy  process.  Some  of  the \nrecommendations of the working group on aid coordination include (i) mainstreaming the advisory groups \ninto  the  CG  structure,  (ii)  placing  greater  emphasis  on  supporting  the  capacity  for  policy  and  planning \nwithin ministries to engage in the CG discussions, and (iii) restructuring the current clusters of ministries \nwithin the CGs. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n41 \n\nLIST OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INVOLVEMENT ACROSS ACTIVITIES AND DONORS \nRELATED TO FISCAL MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM PROGRAM \n\nTable A4.1: Ministry of Finance Technical Assistance-Mapping \n \n\nOngoing Technical Assistance Projects \n\nPolicy Action \nStrengthening Fiscal Management \nImproving the budget \n.framework \n \nBudget functions as \nprincipal instrument of \npublic resource \nmanagement \n\u2022  Fiscal and budgetary \n\ncoordination \nmechanisms in operation \n\n\u2022  Fiscal analysis capacity \nestablished at MOF \n\nADB: TA 3874 - Advisor to the head of budget assisted in drafting Budget Law; TA 4502 - \nLegal advisor to the minister of finance, advisor to the deputy minister of finance (budget and \ntreasury); TA 4637- Capacity Building for Economic Management (approved in August 2005) \nto assist in establishing the fiscal policy unit. \nUNDP: Support to the budget team and/or development budget unit through a team of seven \nadvisors \nDFID/ Maxwell Stamp \nUS Treasury: Budget advisor (integration of operating and development budget, strategy for \npublic expenditure management, budget policy, interface between MOF, line ministries and \nprovinces) \nIMF: Budget and treasury advisor \nUSAID: Bearing point team (until summer 2005) \nWB: Emergency public administration Project (EPAP) \n \nUNDP: See above. \n\nDFID/Adam Smith Institute \nUSAID: Bearing point team (until end 2005) \n \n\nImproving the Public \nInvestment Program \n\u2022  Identification of \n\ninvestment priorities \nstrengthened. \n\n \nEnhancing Resource \nMobilization \n\u2022  Taxation legal and \n\nadministrative framework \nstrengthened. \n\n\u2022  Tax policy is better able \nto support development \nand economic objectives. \n\n\u2022  Tax administration is \n\nimproved. \n\naccountability framework \nin place. \n\n\u2022  Public enterprise \nfinancial reporting \nstrengthened. \n\n \nTreasury management \nstrengthened \n \n\n \n Strengthening Public Financial Management \nImproving transparency \nand accountability \n\u2022  Government \n\nWB: EPAP \n \n\nWB: EPAP I and II \nOne domestic consultant in the cash management unit \nUS Treasury: Government debt and cash management advisor (cash flow forecasting, \ndeveloping public debt law, assisting in debt settlement, advising on creating framework for \ndebt issuance, developing debt management system) \nIMF: Budget and treasury advisor \n \n\nDFID = Department for International Development, EPAP = Emergency Public Administration Project, IARCSC = Independent \nAdministrative  Reform  and  Civil  Service  Commission,  MOF  =  Ministry  of  Finance,  UNDP  =  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme, USAID = United States Agency for International Development, WB = World Bank.  \nNote:  The  table  contains  only  a  preliminary  list  of  ongoing  TAs  in  the  MOF.

The \nattached figure briefly describes the MTBF.  \n \n2. \nThe Need for Accurate Revenue Forecasts and an Aggregate Resource Envelope. \nThe resource and expenditure allocations of commitments should be sustainable in the medium \nterm. This implies that resource allocation should not exceed the aggregate of public revenues \nand  \u201csustainable\u201d1  borrowing.  Accordingly,  estimates  and  forecasts  for  public  revenues  should \nbe accurate, consistent, and unbiased. \n \n3. \nAllocating Budgets to Line Ministries. In a traditional budgetary management system, \nbudget allocations to line ministries tend to be closely tied to previous annual allocations, with \nministries  tending  to  spend  all  of  their  budgets  to  avoid  potential  cuts  in  the  following  years. \nHowever,  under  the  MTBF,  budgetary  allocations  to  line  ministries  are  driven  by  the  broader \npolicy  objectives  of  the  Government,  as  guided  by  the  national  development  strategy  or  its \nequivalent.  Under  this  MTBF,  the  line  ministries  must  prioritize  expenditure  options  to  meet \npolicy  objectives.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)\u2014at  times  in  coordination  with  Ministry  of \nEconomy  and  Planning\u2014must  assess  the  various  prioritized  budgetary  requests  from  line \nministries within the context and constraints of the aggregate resource envelope. The decision \nof  the  MOF  is  based  on  objective  criteria\u2014proposed  expenditures  delivering  broad  policy \nobjectives  of  the  Government\u2014rather  than  on  the  subjective  outcomes  of  face-to-face \nnegotiations. \n \nroles,  and \n4. \nresponsibilities of MOF and the line ministries. Instead of simply enforcing expenditure control, \nMOF oversees and coordinates expenditure policy. The line ministries enjoy greater freedom to \nformulate  their  own  budgets,  while  becoming  more  responsible  for  ensuring  that  expenditure \nprograms deliver the desired outputs effectively and efficiently. \n \n5. \nfor  Effective  and  Accurate  Expenditure  Monitoring.  Traditional \nexpenditure systems emphasize ex-post expenditure monitoring. In contrast, public expenditure \nreviews under MTBF focus on whether the funds have been spent efficiently and according to \nthe original budget, and on assessing whether outcomes were delivered or objectives achieved. \nIn  this  context,  the  MTBF  budgeting  system  must  be  linked  to  the  expenditure  monitoring \nsystem  though  the  budget  classification  system.  This  allows  actual  expenditures  under  this \nclassification to be mapped back to the original budget. \n \n6. \nFeedback of Learning and Development of Next Year\u2019s Budget. Each year\u2019s budget \nprocess will result in new experiences and lessons learned by both the MOF and line ministries, \nand  with  reference  to  both  expenditure  monitoring  and  public  expenditure  reviews.  These \nlessons will feed back into the development of the following years\u2019 budget. \n \n\nThe  new  budgetary  allocation  process  changes \n\nrelationship, \n\nThe  Need \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n1   The  level  of  \u201csustainable\u201d  borrowing  depends  on  the  annual  GDP  growth  rates  and  existing  debt  service \n\ncommitments. \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nReview of Progress in the Medium-Term Budgeting Framework \n\nB. \n \n7. \nDeepening  of  the  MTBF  should  begin  with  a  review  of  the  existing  public  expenditure \nmanagement  system  relative  to  the  benchmark  discussed  above.  This  should  include  an \nassessment  of  the  progress  in  each  of  the  key  stages  highlighted  in  the  diagram  (including \nrevenue  forecasting  and  procedures,  and  systems  for  setting  of  resource  envelopes, \nexpenditure  evaluation  and  prioritization  systems,  cash  management  systems,  expenditure \ncontrol and reporting systems, and expenditure evaluation and monitoring systems). \n \n8. \nReview  of  Budget  Formulation  System.  Initially,  the  existing  public  expenditure \nmanagement system should be reviewed. The purpose of this review is to identify the strengths \nand  weaknesses  in  the  existing  resource  allocation  system  and  to  identify  the  areas  and \npriorities for reform. The review would include both the operating and the development budgets, \nand  the  expenditure  management  systems  and  the  implications  of  the  recent  changes  in  the \nbudgeting  system,  particularly  the  outcome  of  the  Public  Expenditure  Management  (PEM) \nproject.  The  review  will  help  establish  a  pathway  to  achieve  transparent  budgeting  and \nexpenditure  procedures,  strengthen  public  resource  allocation  decisions,  and  promote  fiscally \nresponsible allocation policies.  \n \n9. \nReview  of  Revenue  Estimates  and  Setting  of  Resource  Envelopes.  The  existing \nrevenue  forecasting  capacity  and  process  in  the  MOF  should  be  reviewed.  This  review  would \ntake  into  account  existing  technical  capacity  within  the  department,  data  availability,  and \nrevenue  policy  regime,  etc.  The  aim  of  this  review  would  be  to  develop  recommendations  to \nimprove revenue forecasts and the setting of resource envelopes, both aggregate and for each \nline  ministry.  From  these,  guidelines  would  be  developed  for  each  revenue  source.  Such \nguidelines  will  help  fiscal  policy  departments  to  strengthen  existing  forecasting  procedures, \nsystems  and  models  and  thus  develop  more  accurate  and  consistent  forecasts,  within  the \nexisting absorptive capacity and data constraints. \n \n10. \nReview of Progress to Unify Operating and Development Budgets. The objective of \nthis component is to examine current linkages between the operating and development budget \nprocesses with a view to improving coordination and integration between the two budgets. The \nreview would involve in-depth interviews with officials and a review of relevant documentation to \nunderstand the theoretical and practical relationships between the two processes. This will lead \nto identification of areas for closer coordination between the two budget processes, as well as \nconstraints to coordination. \n \n11. \nReview  of Expenditure  Controls  and  Expenditure  Ceilings.  The  budget  department \nmust assess the various prioritized requests within the aggregate resource envelope. Prioritizing \nsuch  requests  should  be  done  based  on  analyses,  supporting  assumptions,  and  scenarios \nunderlying  the  establishment  of  these  ceilings.  Through  this  process,  the  role  of  the  budget \ndepartment begins to change from one that reviews line item expenditures to one that monitors \nwhether  ministries  allocate  and  use  their  resources  in  line  with  Government\u2019s  priorities  in  the \nmost cost-effective manner.  \n \nReview  of  Systems  for  Classification  of  Off-Budget  Liabilities.2  This  component \n12. \ninvolves  a  comprehensive  audit  of  the  number  and  value  of  guarantees  that  are  currently  in \n\n                                                 \n2  To  better  manage  off-budget  liabilities,  it  is  advisable  for  the  Government  to  periodically  compile  an  inventory  of \noutstanding contingent liabilities and report on the volume of these liabilities, their legal basis and the probability of \nlosses; to promote cost-and risk-sharing to discourage moral hazard, ensure the economic viability of guarantees, \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n69 \n\nplace  and  when  they  were  granted.  This  will  provide  the  basis  for  developing  a  clear  set  of \nguidelines  and  procedures  for  effectively  classifying  off-budget  expenditures  and  liabilities  as \ncontingent  or  actual.  International  best  practices  for  accounting  should  provide  the  basis  for  a \nrevised classification system for such liabilities.  \n \n13. \nReview of Systems for Administration of Statutory and Non-Statutory Funds. This \ncomponent  includes  a  comprehensive  inventory  of  the  number  and  value  of  these  funds.  In \naddition, a key task would be to investigate and review the legislation under which these funds \nhave  been  formed.  Depending  on  whether  the  legislation  is  broad-based  or  fund-specific, \nguidelines  and  detailed  administration  arrangements  for  board  membership,  reporting,  etc. \nwould need to be drawn up or revised.  \n \nReview of Cash and  Asset Management System. In  many developing countries, the \n14. \ncurrent  cash  management  system  hinders  the  disbursement  of  funds  for  foreign-financed \nprojects,  given  that  required  counterpart  funds  are  not  available  when  needed.  Typically  the \nsolution  to  this  mismatch  entails  linking  the  development  assistance  information  systems  with \nthose of the budget department.  \n \n15. \nResults-based  Budget  Pilot  Plan.  Moving  towards  a  more  results-based  budget \nprocess  entails  identifying  programs.  Each  program  would  be  accompanied  by  a  statement  of \nobjectives  to  be  achieved,  e.g.,  improving  relevant  social  indicators.  Detailed  financial  and \nnonfinancial information for all outputs, activities, programs, and comparable information for the \nprevious year would be part of the budget documentation.   \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nand reduce the probability and amount of loss; and to limit the amount of guarantee and other contingent liabilities \nin the budget, etc. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nFigure A9:  The Medium-Term Budgeting Framework \n \n\n \n\nAccurate and reliable \nrevenue forecasts\n\nDevelopment resource \nenvelope \n\n \n\nAllocation of budgets to line \nMinistries \n\nPublic expenditure \nstrategy \n\nPolicy and development \nstrategy: NDS, PRSP, etc.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                        Planning  &  \n &                                                                l                                                                                                    line ministries \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEffective project and \nexpenditure appraisal tools \nin planning and line \nministries \n\nPrioritization of expenditure \nplans by planning and line \nministries \n\nAppraisal of expenditure \noptions by planning, line \nministries, etc. \n\nExpenditure control and \nmonitoring systems \n\nExpenditure by planning \nand line ministries \n\nMOF  \n     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nMOF  \n& \n\n  \n\nEffective and detailed \n \nbudget classification \nsystem \n\n \n\n \n\nExpenditure monitoring \nsystem and MTEF \nbudgeting system \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDetailed ex-post monitoring \n \n \nof expenditure outcomes \n\n \n\n \n\n                                 line ministries \n\nPublic expenditure \nreviews\n\nCash flow \nmonitoring \n\nAnnual financial statements \nand reporting \n\nDevelopment of new \nbudget for next financial \nyear \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNDS  =  national  development  strategy,  MOF  =  Ministry  of  Finance,  MTEF  =  medium-term  economic  framework,  PRSP  =  poverty \nreduction strategy paper. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n71 \n\nTHE GOVERNMENT\u2019S VISION OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN AFGHANISTAN \n\n \n1. \nAfter  years  of  war  and  centralized  state  control,  management  and  administrative \nsystems and skills in Afghanistan are lacking, and Government infrastructure has been severely \ndamaged.  The  Government\u2019s  success  in  implementing  policies  depends  substantially  on  the \ncompetence, efficiency, and effectiveness of the civil service. A concerted and focused program \nfor  the  renewal  and  transformation  of  public  administration  started  in  2000  to  remedy  these \nshortcomings.   \n \n2. \nThe  Independent  Administrative  Reform  and  Civil  Service  Commission  (IARCSC)  has \nbeen  designated  as  the  focal  point  for  a  comprehensive  and  strategic  approach  for  rebuilding \nthe  public  service  involving  the  whole  Government.  The  approach  is  based  on  the  following \nprinciples: (i) the civil service must be (and must be perceived to be) loyal to the Government \nand  the  people  of  Afghanistan;  (ii)  short-term  priorities  must  be  tackled  first  and  urgently,  and \nlonger-term  and  deeper  reforms  must  be  initiated;  and  (iii)  implementation  will  be  undertaken \ncollaboratively, with close cooperation between IARCSC and other key agencies.  \n \n3. \nThe  public  administration  reform  (PAR)  program  is  expected  to  build  a  sound,  ethical, \nand lawful public administration that can contribute to the future peace, stability, and economic \nprosperity of Afghanistan, and the reduction of poverty among the Afghan people. The specific \nobjectives of the PAR program are the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nEstablish  a  sound  legal  framework  for  a  professional,  ethical,  equitable  and \npolitically impartial civil service. \nEstablish  effective  civil  service  management  systems  to  attract,  retain  and \nmotivate qualified employees on the basis of merit. \nDevelop  functional  structures  and  administrative  procedures  that  enable  the \nGovernment to fulfill its commitments. \nDevelop managerial and administrative capacity within the civil service. \n\n \n4. \nThe immediate actions taken in the first phase of the PAR program have provided some \nstability to the public sector and arrested further deterioration. It has also paved the way for the \nmedium to longer-term strategy, with planning undertaken for institutional reform and capacity-\nbuilding, \u201cpay and grading\u201d reforms, reform of personnel and financial management policies and \nprocedures, machinery of Government reforms, and Government infrastructure improvements.  \n \n5. \nIn  the  short  term,  there  has  been  concrete  progress  on  (i)  drafting  a  new  Civil  Service \nLaw;  (ii)  initial  restructuring  and  upgrading  of  critical  Government  functions;  (iii)  paying  an \ninterim  additional  allowance  for  specified  posts  in  departments  that  carry  out  urgent \nrestructuring and reform of critical functions; and (iv) building the capacity and resources of the \nIARCSC  to  enable  it  to  fulfill  its  mandate.  Initial  work  has  been  undertaken  in  developing \nroles  and \nmodern  personnel  management  policies  and  practices;  clarifying  central \nresponsibilities for administrative reform; establishing requirements for a long-term civil service \nmanagement  and  administration  training  facility;  and  improving  policy  formulation  and \nmachinery of Government mechanisms. \n \n6. \nThe  Government  is  conscious  that  Afghanistan\u2019s  long  administrative  tradition  stretches \nback many years before the conflicts and turbulence of recent years. In implementing the reform \nprogram, the Government is building on the best aspects of these traditions, while introducing \nmodern policies and practices that will serve the country well in the future. The Government also \nrecognizes  that  most  civil  servants  themselves  are  keen  to  see  improvements,  and  is  actively \n\n \n\n\f72 \n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\ntaking  their  views  into  account.  The  Government  is  actively  promoting  the  participation  of  civil \nservants in the reform process. \n \n7. \nIn  the  medium  term,  the  Government  is  planning  to  undertake  a  more  comprehensive \nset  of  second  generation  reforms  to  tackle  the  deep-seated  and  long-standing  problems \nafflicting  public  administration.  These  include  institutional  reform  and  rationalization  of  the \nministries,  and  streamlining  administrative  procedures.  Each  of  the  reforms  will  include  a \ncapacity-building  component.  These  reforms  are  expected  to  result  to  an  effective,  efficient, \nequitable, accessible, and affordable public service, and an enabling environment for pro-poor \neconomic growth. These reforms include the following: \n  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nMerit-based  appointments  will  replace  the  patronage-based  appointments  as \nstandard practice in Afghanistan\u2019s public sector. \nThe  \u201cpay  and  grading\u201d  system  will  be  adequate  to  attract,  retain,  and  motivate \nskilled civil servants. Donor supplements are phased out; donor-supported posts \nwithin the Government payroll are regularized; \u201cpay and grading\u201d structure, which \nreflects fiscal realities and provides career incentives to all civil servants and all \nexisting posts are assigned to new grading structure. \nSeasoned professionals are recruited through special schemes in Government to \nhelp the state respond quickly to the dislocation and desperate poverty faced by \nmillions of Afghans. High caliber staff appointed to key posts on the Government \npayroll. \nGovernment agencies pay for staff in accordance with authorized in the budget, \nand  all  state-owned  enterprise  staff  should  be  outside  the  central  Government \npayroll. \nThe role and functions of the civil service, the principles and the ethical standards \ngoverning  its  activities,  and  the  basic  terms  on  which  civil  servants  will  be \nemployed are clear. Government structures are clear with minimal overlapping of \nfunctions and ministerial accountability is clear. \nPolicy  formulation  structures  and  systems  at  the  center  of  Government  and  in \nministries are effective. Timely and well-informed policy decisions are made and \nimplemented effectively, and the legislative program gives precedence to priority \nissues. \n\n(vii)  Head  of  Government\u2019s  office  focuses  on  priority  issues  and  provides  well-\ninformed advice to support decision making. The Office of Administrative Affairs \nprovides effective, efficient and timely support to the cabinet. \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  A  comprehensive  Government  payroll  system  with  a  nominal  roll  of  all \nGovernment  employees  is  in  place,  and  timely  payments  in  Kabul  and  the \nprovinces made. \nA  personnel  management  handbook  providing  instruction  and  guidance  on  the \napplication  of  common  standards  of  good  personnel  practices  across  the  civil \nservice is available. \nSenior  managers  and  personnel  staff  are \nmanagement policies and procedures. \nA  comprehensive  database  to  support  civil  service  personnel  planning  and \ntraining, sustainable on a long-term basis, is in place. \nThe IARCSC fulfills its mandate efficiently and effectively.  \n\n(xii) \n(xiii)  A  sound  and  affordable  operational  plan  for  civil  service  management  training, \ngood  local  management  training  institution/s,  and  effective  management  and \nadministration of training and development is provided to key staff across the civil \nservice.\n\nto  apply  personnel \n\ntrained \n\n(xi) \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n73 \n\n \n \nCONSIDERATIONS FOR MOVING TOWARD A STRATEGIC APPROACH TO \nGOVERNMENT FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT \n \n\n1. \nSubstantial  savings  can  be  achieved  by  adopting  a  standard  platform  for  software  and \nhardware to be implemented across all areas of government. Use of defined software for shared \nfinancial  management \nincluding  budgeting, \nfunctions  across  ministries  and  provinces, \naccounting, payroll, procurement, and project management, will benefit from volume discounts. \nIn  addition,  shared  use  of  hardware\u2014multifunctional  terminals,  servers,  video-satellite  (VSAT) \nconnections,  etc.,  will  substantially  reduce  the  overall  requirement  for  hardware  investments \n(which already have a relatively short economic life). The Government, with donor support, has \nalready  invested  a  significant  amount  in  software,  software  customization  and  implementation \nsupport, hardware, and connectivity to support government financial management functions. To \nroll out applications to the line ministries and provinces will require much more.  \n\nTo achieve savings and facilitate the integration of systems and databases, government-\n2. \nwide  standards  for  software  and  hardware  need  to  be  defined  and  adopted,  and  an  overall \nsystem  architecture  for  the  hardware  infrastructure  required  to  connect  the  ministries  and \nprovinces outlined. The Ministry of Commerce, with the support of USAID, is spearheading this \ninitiative and has already presented a proposal to the cabinet for a national steering committee \nfor information and communication technology to be established for this purpose. The MOC has \nalso  developed  a  plan  for  basic  hardware  to  support  connectivity  across  ministries  and \nprovinces, which it is the process of implementing. \n\n3. \nInvestments in MOF software and hardware to date are significant and need to be fully \nutilized.  The  existing  systems  have  been  successfully  established  and  are  operational. \nMoreover,  they  serve  as  the  basic  foundation  for  the  Government\u2019s  existing  financial \nmanagement  and  financial  control systems.  Thus,  options  that  can  be expanded  or  built  upon \nexisting systems to the greatest degree possible need to be identified and assessed. This will \nrequire  a  critical  review  of  the  existing  systems,  the  level  of  functionality  that  is  presently \nsupported, and the level of functionality that is anticipated to meet the Government\u2019s short- to \nmedium-term needs that, in turn, will serve as the platform for long-term needs. The Ministry of \nFinance with the support of the World Bank, is in the process of undertaking a study to define an \noverall  systems  architecture  to  support  the  Afghanistan  management  information  system \n(AFMIS) at the central, provincial, and district levels. This study is anticipated to serve as a road \nmap for phased implementation of AFMIS. \n\n4. \nIt will be critical that the proposed solution is capable of delivering all the requirements \nset out in the new Public Expenditure and Financial Management (PEFM) Law, and in achieving \nthe  government\u2019s  long-term  financial  management  goals.  The  options  should  have  sufficient \nflexibility  to  fully  support  priority  reforms  and  improvements  that  are  targeted  to  strengthening \nbudget  and  expenditure  performance  management,  and  accounting,  financial  reporting,  and \ninternal  controls.  These  options  include  (i)  strengthening  the  chart  of  accounts  (and  use  of \ngovernment  financial  statistics  and  classification  of  the  functions  of  Government  structured \nformats); (ii) integrating budget preparation (ordinary and development budgets) and the budget \napproval  and  commitment  process  with  the  accounting  system;  (iii)  implementing  a  fully \nautomated  payroll  system  linked  to  a  human  resource  management  system;  (iv)  integrating \nrevenue  administration  with  treasury  functions;  and  (v)  integrating  debt  management  with \ntreasury functions (expenditure and payment management and cash management).  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n74 \n \n\n \n\n \nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\n1. \nLoan proceeds will finance the

a national priority in country \npoverty analysis?  \nNo country poverty analysis available \n\n \n\nSector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty partnership agreement?  \nNot available \n\n \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan:  \n \nThe Fiscal Management and Public Administration Reform Program (FMPARP) will contribute to poverty \nreduction  by  strengthening  fiscal  management  and  public  administration  and  supporting  reforms  to \nimprove fiduciary standards. Improvements in the budget process, financial management processes, and \nfiduciary  control  mechanisms  are  likely  to  encourage  more  donors  to  channel  funding  through  the \nGovernment  budget.  This  will,  in  turn,  lead  to  further  institutional  strengthening  and  state  building, \nessential to the consolidation of peace and economic recovery. FMPARP will also assist in enabling the \ncountry to better meet the challenges of the transition from responding to emergency needs and recovery- \nrelated growth to long-term sustainable development. \n \nThe  Program  encourages  the  Government  to  adopt  a  more  participatory  approach  to  the  budgeting \nprocess, enhancing ownership and resource allocation. A more efficient allocation of public resources will \nbe essential for poverty reduction. The reforms also aim to strengthen the public investment program with \nclearer prioritization and alignment with the National Development Strategy. This will help the Government \nto  more  effectively  direct  public  resources  to  meet  priority  needs,  to  monitor  the  flow  of  resources  and \nevaluate the impact of public spending. Assistance to the fiscal policy unit under FMPARP will also look at \nequity issues in relation to revenue transfers to provinces. \n \nCapacity building under the project grant of FMPARP will assist the Government in deepening its reform \nprogram  and  in  extending  its  services  beyond  Kabul,  which  is  crucial  for  progress  towards  poverty \nreduction, consolidation of the peace-building process, and government control. \n \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThere  are  limited  available  data  on  poverty  incidence  and  distribution.  Under  an  ADB  TA  (Poverty \nAssessment  and  Socioeconomic  and  Macroeconomic  Statistical  Capacity  Building)1  an  integrated  living \nstandards survey is currently being conducted with preliminary results expected in mid-2006.  \n \nSocial  indicators,  while  improving,  are  still  very  low.  Delivery  of  essential  services  remains  largely \ndependent  on  continued  donor  support  and  poses  extreme  difficulties.  Basic  services  are  still  largely \nlacking,  particularly  in  remote  areas  and  areas  affected  by  continued  unrest.
