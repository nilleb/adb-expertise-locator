By  contributing  to  an  efficient,  integrated,  and  sustainable  MRT \nsystem,  the  project  will  support  the  objective  of  the  HCMC\u2019s  Urban  Transport  Master  Plan \n(HUTMP) to increase the use of public transport and reduce dependency on private vehicles. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  planned  and  is  making  major  public  transport \ninfrastructure investments to induce a substantial switch by urban citizens from private to public \nmodes  of  transport.6 A  failure  to  invest  in  public  transport  infrastructure  and  to  encourage  this \nshift away from the use of private vehicles in Viet Nam\u2019s large cities will hurt economic growth \nand accelerate the degradation of the urban environment. The government is supporting climate \nchange  mitigation  efforts  by  adopting  a  low-carbon  transport  growth  path  that  will  be  more \nenergy efficient and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ADB\u2019s 2012\u20132015 country partnership \nstrategy  for  Viet  Nam  supports  the  government's  program  to  improve  urban  transport \ninfrastructure and promote the use of public transport systems.7 \n \n4. \nHCMC is the largest city in Viet Nam, with a greater urban area population of more than \n9.0 million that is expected to grow to 13.8 million by 2025. Urban transportation is dominated \nby private vehicles, mostly motorcycles, which account for 85% of all vehicles. The dominance \nof  private  vehicle  use,  combined  with  an  inadequate  road  system,  creates  severe  congestion \nand  peak  hour  travel  speeds  on  many  routes  that  average  less  than  10  kilometers  per  hour. \nRoad  safety  is  poor  and  the  traffic  accident  rate  high.  The  city\u2019s  urban  transport  problem  is \nworsening  as  incomes  rise  and  many  Vietnamese  become  able  to  shift  from  motorcycles  to \ncars. The overall number of vehicles in HCMC is growing by more than 10% a year.  \n \n5. \nThe  rapid  growth  of  private  vehicle  traffic  is  partly  due  to  HCMC\u2019s  inadequate  public \ntransport system. It currently consists of a poorly integrated, inefficient bus network that cannot \ncompete  with  transportation  by  motorcycles  and  cars.  Poor  institutional  arrangements  for \n                                                \n1  Financed by the Clean Technology Fund.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nestablishing, allocating, and operating bus routes and providing reliable service limits ridership, \nwhich  is  part  of  the  reason  the  system  does  not  recover  its  operating  costs.  In  addition,  bus \nfares are kept low through heavy government subsidies. Planning, management, and control of \ntraffic in the city are weak, and few policies or regulations exist that seek to reduce reliance on \nprivate vehicles or encourage the use of public transit. Even the pedestrian walkways in HCMC \nare often congested, frequently because they are obstructed by unregulated motorcycle parking \nand other unauthorized private use. \n \nHCMC  is  addressing  these  problems  through  the  HUTMP,  which  also  seeks  to  reduce \n6. \ngreenhouse gas emissions  and  other  pollution,  improve  the  urban  environment,  and  cut  down \nthe  number  of  traffic  accidents.  The  HUTMP  proposes  the  development  of  a  city  wide  mass \ntransit system.  Three MRT lines and a rapid transit bus line are currently under development.8 \nPhase 1 of MRT Line 2 is being financed by ADB and is expected to be operational in 2020.9 If \nthe  MRT  network  is  to  be  fully  beneficial  to  users,  however,  complementary  development  is \nneeded to integrate it with other modes of public transit and private vehicle transport and ensure \nthat  it  is  attractive,  accessible,  and  affordable  for  the  city\u2019s  residents.  The  project  will  help \nintegrate  the  MRT  Line  2  into  the  HCMC\u2019s  overall  public  transport  network  by  constructing \ninfrastructure  and  facilities  at  all  stations  that  will  improve  designed  access  to  the  MRT  and \nstrengthen  the  MRT\u2019s  connectivity  with  other  modes  of  transport  used  by  the  public  to \nstrengthen connectivity. The project will also support policy and regulatory reforms in the pricing \nfor  urban  transport  and  in  the  management  of  traffic  and  parking  that  will  define  clear \ninstitutional responsibilities for effective enforcement. \n \n7. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  in  close  coordination  with  the  activities  of  other \ndevelopment partners that are supporting urban transport improvements in HCMC (footnote 8). \nJoint  development  partner meetings  with relevant  HCMC  public  transport  agencies  will  ensure \nthat policy and regulatory measures are consistent with other key initiatives currently underway, \nsuch as the development of integrated fare and ticketing systems, operations and maintenance \nsystems, and a public transport authority. \n \n8. \nPrevious  urban  transport  infrastructure  projects  in  Viet  Nam  have  shown  that  strong \ngovernment  support  is  needed  to  avoid  implementation  delays,  ensure  that  quality  works  are \ndelivered,  and  make  institutions  sustainable.10 Advanced  action  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of \ndistrict  resettlement  offices  is  essential  for  timely  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement and to avoid start-up delays. These lessons have been incorporated in the design \nof this project. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  an  enhanced  public  transport  system  serving  six \ndistricts of HCMC.11 The outcome will be the improved integration of MRT Line 2 stations with \n                                                \n8  These  are  the  MRT  Line  1  from  Suoi  Tien  to  Ben  Thanh,  cofinanced  by  the  Government  of  Japan,  under \nconstruction; the MRT Line 2 from Ben Thanh to Tam Luong, cofinanced by ADB, the European Investment Bank, \nand KfW, under procurement; and the MRT Line 5 from Bay Hien to Sai Gon Bridge, expected to be cofinanced by \nthe ADB, the European Investment Bank and Government of Spain, under design.  \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9  ADB.  2010.

MRT  Line  2  station  accessibility  improved.  These  improvements,  including  public \ntransport  facilities,  will  be  constructed  along  the  first  stage  of  MRT  Line  2  from  Ben  Thanh  to \nTham  Luong  stations,  primarily  within  100  meters  of  nine  underground  and  one  elevated \nstations  along  the  10.3  kilometer  line.  Civil  works  will  include  pedestrian  subways  and \nfootbridges,  bus  stops  and  feeder  links,  dedicated  taxi  stands,  park-and-ride  facilities  for  two-\nwheeled  vehicles,  and  waiting  areas  for  other  public  transport  service  providers.  All \ninfrastructure and other facilities will have gender-sensitive and universal accessibility features \nand  safe  passageways  for  pedestrians.  The  project  will  also  establish  a  station  access \nmanagement  system  to  facilitate  the  efficient  flow  of  people  and  traffic  around  MRT  Line  2 \nstations.  Traffic  police  enforcement  measures  will  be  improved  to  ensure  clear  pedestrian \naccess  and  smooth  traffic  flow  and  to  manage  parking  of  private  vehicles  around  the  MRT \nstations.  The  project  will  finance  consulting  services  for  detailed  design  and  supervision  of \nconstruction  of the civil  works  and goods and  services contracts,  as  well  as for  overall  project \nmanagement. \n \n12. \nPublic  transport  information  system  established.  The  project  will  develop  an \ninformation system along MRT Line 2. It will be linked to the main bus control center in HCMC to \nprovide  real-time  bus  and  train  arrival  information  that  will  make  the  public  transport  system \nmore convenient and reliable. The system will complement city-wide bus network improvements \nto  be  undertaken  with  the  support  of  the  World  Bank.12 The  project  will  be  responsible  for \ninstalling the equipment for the information system at the MRT Line 2 stations. The equipment \nrequired  on  buses  and  bus  stops  for  the  system  will  be  financed  and  installed  by  the  Ho  Chi \nMinh City people\u2019s committee (HCMC PC), which administers the city, and bus operators. \n \nPublic transport policy and systems developed. To support the HUTMP\u2019s objectives \n13. \nand  make  public  transport  more  financially  sustainable,  the  project  will  provide  consulting \nservices  to  develop  (i)  a  station  access  management  system  and  enforcement  measures  to \nensure clear pedestrian access and proper use of public space by venders around the stations; \n(ii) a station parking policy to provide for the efficient flow of vehicles to and from the MRT Line \n2 stations; and (iii) a policy framework on the pricing of public and private transport in HCMC to \npromote  a  modal  shift  from  private  vehicles  to  the  public  transport  system.  The  project  will \ninclude capacity development and training to enable the HCMC transport agencies to implement \nand  enforce  the  new  policies  and  regulations.  It  will  also  provide  equipment  and  consulting \nservices  to  establish  comprehensive  multimodal  transport  and  traffic  management  modeling \nsystems  that  will  be  used  to  develop  detailed  pilot  schemes  to  improve  the  integration  of  the \npublic system under the project.  \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $65  million,  comprising  $52.6  million  in  base  costs \n(including local taxes and duties), $11.3 million for contingencies, and $1.1 million for financing \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n                                                \n12 The World Bank\u2019s proposed Green Transport Project is expected to be approved in 2014. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ncharges  during  construction  (Table  1).

The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 13).  \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2014\u2013December 2019 \n31 December 2019 \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\n \n\nDisbursement \n\n6 contracts \n\nDirector  General,  Foreign  External  Relations  Department, \nMinistry of Planning and Investment \nHo Chi Minh City People\u2019s Committee \nUTMD1 \nPMU to be set up in UTMD1, 16 staff  \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nNational competitive \nbidding \n1262 person-months \nQCBS \nIndividual \n36 person-months \nAll  consulting  services  will  be  financed  by  the  ADB  Clean \nTechnology Fund loan. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the \ngovernment and ADB. \n\n$9.2 million \n$0.2 million \n\n$32.2 million \n\n$3.18 million \n\n1 contract \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  PMU  =  project  management  unit,  QCBS  =  quality-  and  cost-based  selection, \nUTMD1 = Urban Transport Management Department 1 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                \n15 UTMD1  is  under  the  HCMC  PC\u2019s  Department  of  Transport  but  will  report  directly  to  the  HCMC  PC  for \n\nimplementation. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n19. \nThe  project  implementation  schedule  will  be  closely  aligned  with  progress  made  by \nADB\u2019s  ongoing  MRT  Line  2  project  (footnote  9).  Most  of  the  civil  works  as  well  as  the \nprocurement  of  systems  and  equipment  will  be  carried  out  once  the  MRT  Line  2  station \nconstruction work is near completion, particularly for facilities above the underground stations.16 \nThis  will  require  close  coordination  between  the  MRT  Line  2  project  implementation  agency\u2014\nthe  Management  Authority  for  Urban  Railways\u2014and  UTMD1,  as  well  as  between  their \nrespective contractors and consultants. The HCMC PC Official Development Assistance Project \nDivision,  chaired  by  a  HCMC  PC  vice-president,  will  be  responsible for both  projects. This  will \nensure a high degree of coordination and cooperation. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nThe  project\u2019s  public  transport  improvement  measures  and  the  MRT  Line  2  station \ninterchange  and  access  facilities  will  be  innovative  and  are  designed  to be  replicated  in  other \nparts of the city to make public transit sustainable. Pedestrian access within 500 meters of MRT \nstations,  particularly  in  local  alleyways,  will  be  enhanced  by  upgrading  sidewalks.  This  will \ninclude  protection  measures  for  pedestrian  safety  and  support  for  bicycle  usage.  Physical \nmeasures  will  include  park-and-ride facilities  at three  stations,  bus feeder  lines,  and  dedicated \nparking areas for public transit vehicles. The non-physical measures, such as the station access \nmanagement system, will include controls on parking and the use of public space in and around \nthe stations. The public transport information system will enhance integration between the MRT \nand bus services. \n \n21. \nPolicies and regulations to support the public transit system will be developed under the \nproject  to manage  pedestrians  and  vehicles around the  MRT  Line  2  stations.  UTMD1 and  city \ntransport agencies will be introduced to modern multimodal transport and traffic modeling tools \nto  enable  development  of  advanced  solutions  to  urban  transport  problems.  The  new  policies \nand regulations, combined with institutional capacity-building measures, will bring the benefits of \nan integrated, multimodal public transport system to the city and its residents. The combination \nof physical infrastructure and policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms provided by the project \nis  expected  to  increase  ridership  on  MRT  Line  2  by  more  than  10%  over  current  forecast \nridership  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  more  than  15%,  or  the  equivalent  of \n586,500  tons  carbon  dioxide  over  the  project\u2019s  20-year  lifetime  over  emissions  without  these \nimprovements. \n \nB. \n \nThe  main  economic  benefits  will  be  the  reduction  of  travel  time for  public  transit  users \n22. \nthrough  improving  proposed  access  and  egress  at  MRT  stations,  less  congestion  around \nstations, enhancing comfort and convenience, and savings in vehicle operating costs due to an \nenvisaged  shift  from  the  use  of  private  transport  to  the  public  system. 17 A  reduction  in  the \ncongestion on city roads, improvements to the environment, and fewer fatalities from accidents \ninvolving  private  vehicles  will  be  important  indirect  benefits,  even  though  they  are  minor  in \neconomic terms. The economic analysis estimates the project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n16 Works above the underground MRT Line 2 stations cannot commence until the MRT Line 2 stations reach the final \n\nstage of surface level works, including road pavement reinstatement. \n\n17 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f(EIRR)  to  be  13.3%  and  the  economic  net  present  value  discounted  at  12%  at  $4.7  million. \nSensitivity testing showed that the EIRR would remain equal to or above 12% if the capital costs \nrose by not more than 14% over the base case projection, the projected benefits did not fall by \nmore than 13%, or the capital costs rose by 5% and the project benefits fell by 5% at the same \ntime.  The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  is  due  largely  to  assumptions  based  on  projections  for \nhigh MRT Line 2 passenger traffic.  \n \n23. \nThe  projected  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  2.2%,  which  is  above  the  estimated \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  0.4%. 18  This  is  due  mainly  to  revenue  capture  from \npassengers using the MRT Line 2 stations and the very low cost of capital under the ADB CTF \nloan.  Use  of  CTF  financing  decreases  the  weighted  cost  of  capital  by  1.1%.  However,  the \nfinancial sustainability of the public transport system faces challenges posed by its current low \nfares, poor revenue capture, inability to recover operational costs, and heavy subsidization. The \nproject  will  support  the  development  and  implementation  of  the  policy,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional  reforms  that  government  public  transport  policy  development  program  needs  to \nimplement  to  address  these  problems.  HCMC\u2019s  municipal  budget  is  financed  directly  through \nnational  and  city  taxes,  duties,  and  other  revenue  sources.19 HCMC  will  assign  a  share  of  the \npublic transport funding that is within the city\u2019s budget resources for operation and maintenance \nof the project components. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n \nLoan  disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n24. \n(2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements between the government, the \nHCMC  PC,  and  UTMD1.  UTMD1  will  maintain  separate  financial  records  and  accounts  to \nidentify  financing  resources  received  and  project  expenditures,  including  goods,  works,  and \nservices  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  local  funds.  The  loan  accounts  and  related \nfinancial statements will be audited annually, in accordance with sound auditing standards by an \nauditor  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  made  public.    Further  details  on  disbursement,  auditing,  and \nfinancial management are provided in the PAM, Section V (footnote 13). \n \n25. \nA  financial  management  assessment  found  that  UTMD1  has  acceptable  financial \nmanagement  capacity  and  experience  in  managing  and  implementing  similar  projects  but \nlimited experience and knowledge of ADB\u2019s financial management requirements. To improve its \nfinancial  management  capacity  for  implementing  the  project,  UTMD1  will  engage  external \nfinancial management consultants to provide support and assistance to the PMU. The financial \nmanagement  consultants  will  train  the  PMU\u2019s  accounting  staff  in  ADB\u2019s  loan  disbursement \nprocedures  and  financial  management  practices.  If  needed,  UTMD1  will  ensure  that  sufficient \naccounting  staff  are  available  for  effective  financial  management  during  implementation  by \nrecruiting and/or mobilizing extra accountants. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  the  HCMC  PC,  and  UTMD1.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n18 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The city retains 28% of all national revenue against future budgetary support transfers from Ministry of Finance. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n27. \nA  social  action  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  project,  based  on  a  social  impact \nassessment.20   The  smooth  accessibility  to  the  MRT  Line  2  stations  and  the  integration  of  the \nMRT with the bus system and other modes of transport will benefit women,  students, children, \nand older people, who are identified as the primary users of public transport. By improving the \nareas around MRT Line 2 stations and developing a public transport pricing framework to make \npublic transport fares affordable, the project will improve economies in the MRT Line 2 localities \nby  creating  business  opportunities,  reducing  congestion,  and  improving  quality  of  life.  The  six \nproject districts will benefit from temporary construction jobs and local employment in operations \nand maintenance. \n \nHigher safety risks for the larger numbers of pedestrians expected to travel along roads \n28. \nnear  the  stations  constitutes  a  potential  adverse  social  impact.  Pedestrian  safety  risks  will  be \nmitigated by providing footbridges and pedestrian subways and good traffic control around the \nstations.  The detailed design will follow universal accessibility and pedestrian safety guidelines. \n \n29. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  action  plan  is \ndetailed  in  the  PAM  (footnote  13).  The  plan  ensures  that  the  detailed  design  of  the  project\u2019s \nMRT Line 2 station accessibility elements will include measures to address gender concerns for \nusing  public  transit  services.  Proposed  measures  include  women-only  waiting  spaces  at  bus \nterminals;  adequate  lighting  around  stations,  bus  stops  and  walkways;  separate  toilets  for \nwomen;  and  spaces  allocated  for  women  vendors  to  operate  around  the  stations.  The  public \ntransport  information  system  and  transit  scheduling  are  to  be  based  on  an  analysis  that  will \nexamine traffic patterns and needs by gender. The plan provides that trip schedules be linked to \nother  types  of  multimodal  public  transport  to  support  accessibility  for  women.  The  plan  will \nensure  multimodal  public  transport  ticket  pricing  and  an  integrated  ticketing  system  to  support \naffordability and increase access for women. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n30. \nUnder  the  ADB  and  CTF  framework  agreement,  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) will apply to all project components financed by the CTF. The project is \nassessed as category B for environment. The draft initial environmental examination, which has \nbeen prepared based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, has been reviewed by ADB and is \nbeing  revised.21 The  approved  initial  environmental  examination  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite upon receipt from the HCMC PC. No natural ecosystems exist in the project area, which \nis  heavily  populated.  Land  use  is  predominantly  commercial  or residential. The  project  will  not \ninvolve major civil works and is not likely to result to significant adverse environmental impacts \nduring  construction  and  operation.  Public  consultations  with  affected  people  were  conducted \nduring  preparation  of  the  initial  environmental  examination,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \ninformation  disclosure  and  consultation \nthe \nenvironmental management plan is included in all bid documents.  \n \nA  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  prior  to  commencement  of  site \n31. \nworks. The construction supervision consultant will conduct environmental management training \nfor  UTMD1  in  monitoring  and  reporting  and  help  UTMD1  monitor  the  environmental \nperformance of contractors. \n\nrequirements.  UTMD1  will  ensure \n\nthat \n\n                                                \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n32. \nThe project is assessed as category B for involuntary resettlement. The 1.6 hectares of \nland  acquisition  required  will  affect  only  government-owned  land.  An  estimated  63  roadside \nstalls  and  small  shops  with  77  employees  near  three  MRT  Line  2 stations  will  be  affected,  as \nwell as two gas stations owned by the government and employing 23 people. \n \n33. \nA  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  that  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  and  relevant  legislation  and  policies  in  Viet  Nam.  The  draft  resettlement  plan  was \nposted  on  the  ADB  website  on  1  August  2013  and  will  be  updated  following  detailed  design. \nAffected  businesses  will  be  provided  with  compensation  at  replacement  cost  and  transitional \nand relocation assistance. One workshop and nine consultation meetings in which 283 affected \nbusiness  owners  and  employees  participated  were  conducted  in  December  2012,  January \n2013,  March  2013  and  July  2013.  The  meetings  provided  an  overview  of  the  project  and \noutlined  key  elements  of  the  resettlement  plan,  such  as  anticipated  impacts,  mitigation \nmeasures, entitlements, consultation, and the grievance redress mechanism. In July 2013, key \ninformation  from  the  draft  resettlement  plan  was  disclosed  to  all  65  affected  business \nestablishments.  The agreed resettlement plan will be made available in the district offices and \non  ADB\u2019s  website.  All  social  monitoring  reports  will  be  disclosed.  The  project  is  assessed  as \ncategory C for indigenous peoples\u2019 safeguards. \n \nUTMD1 will be responsible for ensuring compliance with ADB safeguards policies during \n34. \nupdating,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  UTMD1  will  work  closely  with  and  provide  capacity \nbuilding  to  HCMC  PC,  districts\u2019  boards,  and  wards.  The  resources  to  conduct  such  capacity \nbuilding will be included in the design and construction supervision contract. \n \nF. \n \n35. \nThe  project  faces  risks  related  to  its  innovative  character,  demands  on  executing  and \nimplementing agency capacity, dependence on timely execution by and coordination with other \nprojects, and need for effective transport reforms to fully achieve the project impact. These risks \nwill be mitigated through provision of international expert support to UTMD1 for development of \ndesigns,  specifications,  and  project  management.  In  response  to  UTMD1\u2019s  limited  experience \nwith  ADB  guidelines  and  policies,  mitigation  measures  to  address  associated  public  financial \nmanagement  and  procurement  risks,  as  detailed  in  the  PAM,  will  require  careful  monitoring  to \nensure effective implementation of proposed support measures. \n \nThe project must be sequenced with implementation progress on the MRT Line 2 itself. \n36. \nThe implementation delay risk this poses will be mitigated through the government\u2019s institutional \narrangements, project management support, and close coordination with development partners \nsupporting  public  transport.  Because  the  viability  of  the  project  relies  on  achieving  the \npassenger  levels  and  patronage  projected  for  the  MRT  Line  2,  insufficient  government \ncommitment  to  implement  the  policy  and  regulatory  reforms  under  the  project  to  promote  a \nmodal  shift  from  private  to  public  transport  is  a  key  risk.  This  will  be  mitigated  by  providing \nadvisory services and training to public transport agencies under the project to modernize and \nintegrate the public transport system. The HCMC PC is responsible for ensuring that its plans to \nmodernize  the  city\u2019s  bus  fleet  and  its  operations  to  provide  efficient  links  and  an  effective \ninterchange  system  with  the  new  MRT  lines  are  developed  on  time.  Risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.22  Overall, \nthe benefits and positive impacts of the project are expected to outweigh any mitigation costs. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n37. \nThe  government  and  the  HCMC  PC  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  detail  in the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.
