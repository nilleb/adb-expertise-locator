This will be achieved by \nsaving energy, increasing capacity, deferring distribution capacity \nexpansion  by  distribution  network  rehabilitation,  and  reducing \npeak  demand  from  use  of  efficient  lighting  by  residential \ncustomers.  \n \nThe efficient lighting program will pilot the use of 500,000 compact \nfluorescent  lamps  (CFLs)  and  light-emitting  diodes  (LEDs)  in \nselected isolated and islands grids.  \n \nRationale  Indonesia ranks among the top 20 polluters in the world. The \ncountry's CO  emissions per capita have grown significantly since \n2\nthe  1980s,  a  large  part  of  which  is  from  the  burning  of  oil. \nEmissions will get worse in the short term, as the Government \nplans to rapidly expand the use of coal for power generation to \nreduce its reliance on imported oil.  \n \nThe  Government's  energy  conservation  and  energy  efficiency \ninitiatives will offset part of these emissions, and these efforts \nneed to be part of mainstream planning to have larger impact. PT \n(Persero) Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation \n[PLN]),  the  state-owned  power  utility,  has  invested  in  energy \nefficiency projects for its power distribution, which has reduced \noverall distribution losses and CO  emissions. To maintain the \n2\nmomentum, PLN has an ambitious plan to invest about $1.2 billion \nin distribution between 2010 and 2014. A large part of this plan \nwill be financed by internal resources, and loans from bilateral and \nmultilateral partners.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "ii \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will engage with PLN in its \noverall energy efficiency improvement initiative, with the proposed \nsmall  Project  covering  the  entire  Java\u2013Bali  network  with \ncofinancing from the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). \nThe proposed project components could be implemented within 2 \nyears. If the proposed Project and the partnership in financing is \nsuccessful, ADB will scale up this operation with a sector project \n(using a multitranche financing facility) and support part of PLN's \nfinancing needs for the energy efficiency strategy.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s objective is to reduce the peak load demand and \nsystem losses by implementing distribution network rehabilitation \nand an efficient lighting program that will also contribute towards \ngreenhouse gas reduction. Carbon credits will be sought following \nthe  approved  methodology  of  the  Clean  Development \nMechanism\u2019s (CDM) executive board. This investment is in line \nwith ADB's commitment to clean energy and energy efficiency \nacross Asia.  \n \n  About  200  megawatts  (MW)  equivalent  in  distribution  system \ncapacity will be freed and about 400 gigawatt-hours (GWh) will be \nsaved annually through energy efficiency at a cost well below the \ncost of developing equivalent new capacity. This will reduce the \nemissions of Indonesia's power sector by about 330,000 tons (t) \neach year.   \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the proposed Project will be reduced CO  emissions \n2\nby the power sector. The outcome of the Project is to contribute to \nPLN's overall power distribution efficiency and quality of power \nsupply.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $120.0 million, \nincluding  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest  and  other \ncharges  during  implementation,  and  taxes  and  duties  of  $9.0 \nmillion. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $50,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill be provided to the Republic of Indonesia under ADB's London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. AFD will cofinance the Project in the amount \nof $50 million. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, and an interest rate in LIBOR equivalent to a \nEuro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR)-flat rate and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "iii \nA cofinancing agreement will be entered into by ADB and AFD \nunder which the parties will jointly finance the investment costs. \nADB  will  administer  the  AFD  loan  including  procurement, \nrecruitment of consultants, and disbursement, according to the \ncofinancing agreement to be signed. \n \nA grant from the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility  will  be  provided  to  PLN  in  the \namount of $1.0 million equivalent to be administered by ADB.  \n \nPLN will finance $19.0 million of the Project costs, including all \nlocal taxes and duties.  \n \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  50.0  41.67 \nAFD a  50.0  41.67 \n     \nMulti-Donor Clean Energy Fund \n   \nunder the Clean Energy Financing \n   \nPartnership Facilityb \n1.0  0.83 \nPT (Persero) Perusahaan Listrik     \nNegara  19.0  15.83 \nTotal  120.0  100% \na Agence Francaise de D\u00e9veloppement. \nb Established by the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and \nSweden; and administered by ADB. \n         Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  Under a subsidiary loan agreement that will be on terms and \nTerms  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  AFD,  the  Government  will \nrelend to PLN the proceeds of the ADB and AFD loans.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  November 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  May 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  PLN will be the executing agency and has overall responsibility for \nArrangements  the implementation of the Project.

The \nadvance action will cover tendering and bid evaluation up to the \nstage of ADB\u2019s approval of PLN's recommendation for award of \ncontract  before  the  effective  date  of  the  loan  agreement.  The \nretroactive financing for goods will cover the 12 months prior to \nthe date of the loan agreement with a ceiling of $5 million, or 10% \nof the ADB loan amount. The Government was advised that ADB \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does \nnot commit ADB to approve the proposed loan and that ADB \nfinancing will be dependent upon the Government's compliance \nwith  all  aspects  of  ADB's  procedural  requirements,  including \ncompliance with the relevant provisions of the loan agreement and \nADB's guidelines. \n \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB and AFD loans \nand  CEF  Grant  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), \nand the procurement plan prepared and agreed upon between the \nGovernment and ADB. Ten contract packages will be procured \nunder the Project through either international competitive bidding \nor national competitive bidding. Equipment for the pilot project for \nefficient  lighting  will  be  procured  though  limited  international \nbidding.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be selected and engaged under the Project in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). An international consulting \nfirm will be engaged to manage implementation of the Project. \nThe firm will deliver 105 person-months of consulting services (15 \nperson-months of international and 90 person-months of national \nconsulting)  following  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod and using full technical proposal. Individual consultants \nwill deliver 18 person-months of consulting services (6 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  12  person-months  of  national \nconsulting)  for  implementation  of  the  pilot  project  for  efficient \nlighting.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  reduce  the  power  sector's  CO emissions  by \n2 \nBeneficiaries  330,000 t per year. It will also support registration of the proposed \nProject with the regulatory authorities to capture the value of the \navoided emissions as cash flows under the CDM. The value of the \navoided CO  emissions will be around $3.5 million each year. \n2\n  \nThe  proposed  Project  will  improve  the  efficiency  of  power \ndistribution in all of its five regions on the islands of Java and Bali. \nPLN will save energy by reducing its distribution losses and at the \nsame time improve power supply voltage to its feeders in west, \ncentral, and east Java. \n \n ", "v \n \n \nOverall, about 400 GWh of electricity will be saved annually\u2014\nabout 100 GWh in Jakarta, 40 GWh in central Java, 50 GWh in \nwest Java, 180 GWh in east Java, and 30 GWh in Bali. The value \nof the 400 GWh of saved power (assuming a marginal cost of \n$0.15 per kilowatt-hour) is about $60 million each year. \n \nAbout 200 MW of equivalent distribution system capacity will be \nfreed and, using the saved energy, PLN will be able to connect \nabout 1.2 million additional customers to the Java\u2013Bali network.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  This Project involves no new technology and PLN has all the \nnecessary skills to design and implement the project components, \nhence  risks  related  to  design  and  implementation  are  low. \nShortage of power generation in the system is another risk, as \ndistribution  investment  alone  will  not  improve  power  supply \nreliability and quality unless there is sufficient power to distribute. \nHowever, PLN's efforts in mobilizing financing from both internal \nand external resources is showing results as about 2,500 MW of \nadditional  generation  capacity  in  Java  will  be  commissioned \nbetween 2010 and 2012.  \n \nPLN  has  also  identified  a  range  of  specific  risks:  (i)  stronger \ngrowth  in  electricity  demand,  resulting  in  overuse  of  existing \nequipment  (reducing  its  lifespan);  (ii)  a  worsening  financial \nsituation, if revenues are lower than expected because of delays \nin  the  payment  of  subsidies  by  the  Government;  and  (iii) \ninsufficient investment from independent power producers (IPPs) \ndelaying the much-needed investments in generation. PLN has \ndeveloped a range of mitigation measures to address these risks, \nsuch as (i) planned investments to rehabilitate and optimize the \ndistribution network to reduce overloading and promote demand-\nside management to reduce demand, (ii) arrangements to raise \ncapital from the domestic market and through borrowings (bilateral \nand multilateral lenders) so that investments can be implemented \nin a timely manner, and (iii) introduction of higher tariffs and terms \nto  secure  primary  energy  requirements  through  long-term \ncontracts, etc. ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Republic of Indonesia, (ii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) to the Republic of Indonesia, and (iii) proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility to PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listrik Negara, for the Java\u2013Bali \nElectricity Distribution Performance Improvement Project. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Indonesia ranks among the top 20 polluters in the world. The country's carbon dioxide \n(CO ) emissions per capita have grown significantly since the 1980s, a large part of which is \n2\ndue to the burning of oil. As a strategy to reduce its reliance on imported oil, the Government \nplans to rapidly expand the use of coal for power generation, which will increase CO  emissions \n2\nfrom the power sector. At the same time, the Government has taken initiatives to implement \nenergy  conservation  and  energy  efficiency  policies  to  reduce  emissions.  PT  (Persero) \nPerusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation [PLN]), the state-owned power utility, \nhas invested in energy efficiency projects for power distribution, which has reduced overall \ndistribution losses and CO  emissions. PLN has an ambitious plan to invest about $1.2 billion in \n2\nthe distribution sector between 2010 and 2014 to further reduce distribution losses and CO  \n2\nemissions. A large part of this plan will be financed by loans from bilateral and multilateral \npartners.  \n \n3.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  engage  with  PLN  in  its  energy  efficiency \nimprovement initiative, with the proposed small Project covering the entire Java\u2013Bali network \nwith  cofinancing  from  AFD.  If  the  proposed  Project  and  the  partnership  in  financing  are \nsuccessful, ADB will scale up this operation with a sector project (using a multitranche financing \nfacility) and support PLN's financing needs for pursuing its energy efficiency strategy. This \ninvestment will supplement ADB ongoing policy work in the power sector, and will reduce \nenergy  sector  emission  by  reducing  distribution  losses,  promoting  energy  efficient  lighting \nalternatives to customers, and making customers aware of energy efficiency measures.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n4.  Geographically Indonesia is unique with its huge number of islands and vast coastlines. \nAbout 65% of the population of Java island lives in coastal regions, and they are therefore \nvulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise. Indonesian islands are vulnerable to earthquakes and \nhigh waves because of their geographic location\u2014between two shelves of the Asian landmass \nand the combined Australian and New Guinean landmass. Indonesia's forest areas are also \nprone to natural disasters, and events such as volcanic and tectonic earthquakes and tsunamis \nare fairly common. In addition, the islands are subject to extreme weather events, such as long \ndry  seasons  and  floods.  According  to  the  International  Disaster  Database  (2007),1 the  10 \nbiggest natural disasters in Indonesia in the last 100 years took place after 1990, and most of \nthese  disasters  were  weather-related:  flood,  drought,  forest  fire,  and  increase  of  endemic \ndiseases. The Government estimates that the economic losses from the 10 biggest disasters to \nbe about $26 billion, of which around 70% is climate related. \n                                                 \n1  Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED). 2007. The International Disaster Database. \nAvailable: http://www.emdat.be/ ", "2    \n \n5.  As Indonesia is vulnerable to the threat of climate change, the Government plans to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector, and from land use, land-use change, \nand forestry. Indonesia ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nthrough Act No.6 in 1994, and ratified the Kyoto Protocol through Act No. 17 in 2004. It also \nplans to invest in carbon sequestration activities. The Government plans to work with its bilateral \nand multilateral partners to tackle the threat of climate change. \n \n6.  According to the World Resource Institute's publication2 in 2007, Indonesia\u2019s emissions \nper capita have grown by about 150% since the 1980s, and by about 67% since the 1990s. \nAbout 56.5% of annual CO  emission is from oil burning, 35% is from coal, and 18.5% is from \n2\ngas. Estimates for annual emissions vary from 250 million tons (t) to 280 million t. The power \nsector is a major emitter, and this will increase further with the Government's plan to expand the \nuse of coal for power generation. \n \n 7.  According to a Government study,3 if no effort is made to reduce emissions, total CO  \n2\nemissions from the energy sector could reach 1,200 million t by 2025. The Government could \nsignificantly reduce these emissions using three simple strategies: (i) energy diversification, (ii) \nenergy conservation; and (iii) implementation of clean technology. The immediate solutions are \nincreased use of renewable energy, energy  efficiency, and conservation. According to the \nNational  Energy  Conservation  Master  Plan4,  Indonesia  could  save  about  10%\u201330%  of  its \nenergy demand through conservation and efficiency measures. A detailed analysis of climate \nchange issues and overall emissions in Indonesia is discussed in Appendix 2. \n \n8.  Despite the Government's plan to diversify energy resources and mainstream energy \nefficiency, it is compelled to build more coal-fired power stations to meet immediate energy \ndemands. These short-term decisions are prompted by the many problems faced by the power \nsector, some of which are discussed in section B.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Problems and Constraints  \na.  Growing Power Demand, Supply Shortage, and Lack of Investment \n9.  Indonesian electricity demand is growing rapidly; demand growth peaked at about 16% \nper annum during 1994\u20131995, with a maximum demand of about 12,800 megawatts (MW) in \n1997. This demand was met by power purchase contracts with independent power producers \n(IPPs); most contracts were 30-year \"take-or-pay\"5 agreements in dollars. When demand growth \nslowed in 1997, these take-or-pay obligations led PLN into a severe financial crisis and, as a \nresult, investments in the power sector fell considerably. New investments have not kept pace \nwith the growing demand for electricity; since 2001, electricity sales have grown by about 7% \nand the peak demand by 6%, but during the same period PLN\u2019s power system grew by less \nthan half of that amount\u2014the transmission network grew by 3.2%, the distribution network grew \nby 1.7%, and new generation capacity grew by 1.4%. Distribution rehabilitations were delayed. \nThe  deferral  of  rehabilitation  has  no  immediate  impact  on  the  distribution  system  but  as \ninvestments are delayed (due to budget shortfall), the distribution systems were overloaded and \n                                                 \n2 Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT).

", "    3 \nlosses increased. Because of lack of investments in the power sector, the main islands of Java \nand Bali are experiencing power outages. With the high demand, the system reserve margin \nhas become smaller, causing frequent load shedding with blackouts lasting for 2\u20133 hours each \nday. In December 2008, the maximum system demand was 15,570 MW (compared with 16,300 \nMW in 2007) in the Java\u2013Bali grid and during the same month PLN had to shed between 80 \nMW and 860 MW every day from the peak demand. Detailed analysis of the power sector is in \nAppendix 3.  \n \nb.  Dependency on Oil and High Cost of Power \n10.  Oil is one of the most expensive fuels for power generation. As more than 30% of power \ngeneration in Indonesia is based on either diesel or fuel oil, the cost of power generation is high. \nIn 2008, PLN's average cost of production was $0.13 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while the cost of \npower generation in neighboring countries was between $0.03/kWh6 and $0.11/kWh. Since PLN \nis fully exposed to the international market price of oil, its reliance on oil also creates large \nfluctuations in its power generation cost, while the tariff remains fixed.  \n \nc.  Lack of Incentives and Policy Support for Renewable Energy \n11.  Indonesia has great potential for renewable energy, especially hydro and geothermal. \nSolar technologies are becoming more attractive in Indonesia as price of solar panels has come \ndown and panel efficiencies have improved. In addition, there is scope for low-carbon emission \nenergy sources based on coal seam methane and coal mine methane. These sources improve \nenergy security as they are not exposed to international supply or pricing risks. The Government \nhas to provide direct incentives for renewable energy development, so that in isolated off-grid \nareas and in remote islands, small-scale renewable energy generation could be established, \ndespite its high cost, rather than the ubiquitous stand-alone diesel generation. \n \nd.  Lowest Electrification Rate in the Region \n12.  About  90  million  people,  or  38%  of  the  Indonesian  population,  have  no  access  to \nelectricity and most of the rural population relies on biomass for their primary fuel for cooking \nand kerosene for their lighting needs. Because of the lack of incentives for private investment \nand shortage of capital for public investment, access to electricity by the Indonesian population \nremains one of the lowest in the region.  \n \ne.  Inefficient Lighting Contributing to High Energy Intensity \n13.  Indonesia's energy consumption per capita is much smaller than it is in both Thailand \nand Malaysia, while Indonesia's energy intensity is significantly higher than that of its neighbors. \nUse of relatively inefficient appliances by residential consumers contributes to this. Although \nelectricity consumption by the residential sector varies widely across different income classes in \nrural and urban areas, on average more than 50% of the electricity is used for lighting by \nresidential  customers.  Consumers  are  aware  of  the  benefits  of  energy  efficient  compact \nfluorescent lamps (CFLs), however they continue using incandescent bulbs which are cheaper \nbut consume about five times more energy. Consumers are concerned about the cost and \nquality of CFLs, but unaware of the quality, standard, or regulated labeling for CFLs. While good \nquality CFLs can last for 8,000\u201315,000 hours, poor quality ones often fail within 100 hours. \nWhen cheap ones fail after a short time, consumers are reluctant to replace them. \n                                                 \n6  The average wholesale electricity price in the National Electricity Market of Australia.  ", "4    \n \nf.  Main Cause of the Problems \n14.  Most problems described in paras. 9-13 stem from the following main causes: (i) low \ntariffs and high subsidies, (ii) policy gaps as a result of poor coordination and decision making, \n(iii)  barriers  to  private  sector  investment  and  lack  of  regulatory  clarity,  (iv)  PLN's  overall \nmonopoly position, and (v) the absence of a rural electrification strategy and financing. In \naddition, the Indonesian power tariff is one of the lowest in Asia and, because of the low tariffs, \nPLN only recovers part of its cost of electricity production and supply from its sales revenue. \nElectricity tariffs have remained the same7 since 2003, although the cost of supply has more \nthan doubled from $0.056 to $0.132 per kWh during the same period. Since the Government \nhas maintained these low tariffs for social reasons, it provides direct subsidies to PLN to meet \nthe financing gap. In 2008, subsidies to PLN became a major drain on Government budget and \nreached  the  all  time  high  of  $7.6  billion,  increasing  from  $315  million  in  2004.  Detailed \ndiscussion on tariffs and subsidies is in Appendix 4. The low tariffs and associated subsidies \nhave created a range of disincentives for PLN, consumers, and other stakeholders, leading to \nthe main problems in the sector.  \n \n2.  Government\u2019s Policies and Plans \n \n15.  As Indonesia is an oil producing country, the Government has always faced the policy \nissue of allocating the right amount of oil for local consumption and for export, especially during \nperiods of high prices. For example, after the oil crisis of the 1970s it progressively reduced the \nproportion of oil for power generation from about 70% in the 1980s to about 54% in 1993 and to \n21% in 1998. However, this proportion rose back to about 36% in 2005, and the high domestic \nconsumption made Indonesia a net importer of oil. This prompted immediate policy change, and \nthe Government increased domestic oil prices by 49% in March 2005 and by 105% in October \n2005, causing the price of high-speed diesel to triple, from $0.18 per liter in 2004 to $0.55 per \nliter in 2006.  \n \n16.  In addition to raising prices, the Government initiated a fast-track program8 to reduce \ndependency on oil for power generation. Under this program, it plans to develop 10 coal-fired \npower plants in Java\u2013Bali (7,520 MW) and 23 coal-fired power plants outside Java\u2013Bali (1,963 \nMW). A second fast-track program that includes about 60% renewable energy generation will be \nimplemented between 2009 and 2014. These initiatives will address the immediate problems of \npower shortage, the high cost of power (and dependency on oil), and low use of renewable \nenergy. As a policy support to encourage these investments, in April 2009 the Government \nissued ministerial decree No.5/2009, which removed the previous price cap of $0.045/kWh for \npower purchase from IPPs, and gave PLN the exclusive authority to decide on IPP prices. PLN \nhas increased the price for new IPPs to between $0.065/kWh and $0.085/kWh, and since then \nhas acted as a single buyer of electricity from the IPPs. ADB's engagement in the power sector \nwill help the Government to switch to clean coal technologies and renewable energy options for \nfuture power generation (discussed in paragraph 29). \n \n17.  The overall sector strategy is reflected in the Government\u2019s Blueprint of National Energy \nManagement  2005\u20132025,  which  recognizes  the  high  share  of  oil  in  the  energy  mix  and \ndependence on oil imports, and sets the following targets for 2025: to reduce the use of oil to \n                                                 \n7  In real terms, the tariffs have actually been reduced by about 50% since 2003, as the Indonesian consumer price \nindex increased to 161.73 in 2008 from 105.65 in 2003.

The Government is addressing the issue of lowest electrification in the region in its \nNational Electricity Development Plan, which aims to increase the electrification ratio to 90% by \n2020. PLN plans to connect around 10 million new customers between 2010 and 2014 to \nachieve the Government\u2019s commitment to increasing the electrification rate, and has a long list \nof investment plans with an estimated cost of about $14.4 billion.  \n \n3.  Opportunities \n19.  In some respects the power sector in Indonesia has significantly improved in recent \nyears compared to the 1990s and early 2000s. These improvements are in line with broader \ntrends to better economic management and governance in Indonesia. For example, PLN has \nintroduced  greater  transparency  in  reporting,  established  good  corporate  governance  and \nindependent audit, and strengthened financing to support issuance of international bonds. It is \nalso moving from an engineering-dominated culture to one with greater emphasis on other \ndisciplines.  For  example,  losses  have  been  reduced  gradually  since  2004.  In  2007,  the \ngigawatt-hours sold per employee increased to 3.8 GWh from 1.7 GWh in 2002, and the \nnumber of customers served per employee increased to 941 from 648 in 2002. PLN has also \ndeveloped  separate  accounting  reports  for  the  operations  of  its  distribution  businesses  in \ngeographic regions. Sector issues are discussed in details in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n20.  In relation to energy efficiency, the energy policy currently being developed should set \nout principles that guide priorities, identify specific areas for immediate attention, and consider \nbudget implications. ADB's sector study recommends the setting up of a separate directorate \ngeneral for energy efficiency and renewables to lead implementation of the energy efficiency \npolicy.   \n \n21.  As Indonesia\u2019s subsidized energy sector contributes to inefficient public spending and \nimpedes  investment  to  modernize  the  sector,  there  is  a  strong  economic  justification  for \ninvesting in projects that mitigate climate change. In addition, because the subsidies are linked \nto world energy (and price shocks), potential carbon payments for emission reductions will not \nonly provide economic benefits but also reduce exposure to oil prices\u2014sufficient incentives to \npromote energy efficiency.   \n \n22.  PLN is committed to increasing efficiency in its distribution network. During 2004\u20132008 \nPLN invested about $730 million in the Java\u2013Bali distribution network, averaging about $175 \nmillion each year, except in 2008 when the investment level dropped to about $33 million \nbecause  of  the  high  price  of  fuel.  Investments  were  made  in  electrical  equipment  and  in \nreplacing old equipment that did not meet load specifications. Networks were optimized to meet \nthe changing needs of growing power demand and changing load flow conditions, and to avoid \noverloading  of  equipment  and  bottlenecks  in  the  network.  These  investments  reduced \ndistribution losses. PLN management is committed to reducing distribution losses to 6% (the \ninternational norm is 3%\u20135%) by investing about $1.2 billion between 2010 and 2014. In 2008, \nthe distribution system loss was about 8.4%\u2014its lowest level ever\u2014as a result of PLN's network \noptimization investments since 2003.  \n \n23.  Through the proposed Project, ADB will establish a partnership with the AFD to support \nPLN's energy efficiency initiative. It will also bring in expertise and processes to quantify and ", "6    \n \ncapture the benefit of the avoided CO  emissions as a financial benefit to the project, and \n2\nparticipate in the global efforts to mitigate the threat of climate change. If this approach and \npartnership  is  successful  and  progress  is  made  on  implementation  of  some  of  the  policy \nrecommendations, ADB will scale up this small investment with a sector project for energy \nefficiency and renewable energy to meet the growing local investment need and to generate the \nglobal public good of emission reduction to tackle the threat of climate change.   \n \n4.  Clean Development Mechanism Credits  \n \n24.  Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Clean Development Mechanism9 (CDM) was developed to \nset targets for emissions and create a market for emission reduction with economic value. The \nCDM allows emission reduction (or emission removal) projects in developing countries to earn \ncertified emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to 1 ton of CO  and these CERs can \n2\nbe traded, sold, and used by industrialized countries to meet part of their emission reduction \ntargets set under the Kyoto Protocol. Indonesia has large potential to reduce emissions either \nby energy saving or through energy efficiency. As Indonesia relies heavily on oil and coal for its \npower production, it is, theoretically, a country with high CDM potential in the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. An emission factor of more than 0.8 tons of CO  per \n2\nMWh implies that each megawatt-hour of avoided power generation in Indonesia produces \nabout 60% more emission credit than it does in the Philippines, which has an emission factor of \nabout 0.5 tons of CO  per MWh. Despite this large incentive, according to the database of the \n2\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as of October 2009 only \n24 projects had been registered from Indonesia with the executive board of the CDM and about \n224,000 CERs had been issued, indicating that Indonesia had only been able to capture about \n2% of the global CDM market.  \n \n5.  ADB Strategy  \n25.  The developing countries of Asia are gradually developing strategies and programs for \nboth their climate change and adaptation measures. To mitigate energy-associated emissions, \nenergy efficiency improvements and low-carbon and zero-carbon solutions are being adopted. \nAlready, ADB is working with new financing mechanisms and capacity building for energy \nefficiency improvements, renewable energy, waste to energy, sustainable transport, and other \nemission mitigation projects. This will be achieved through ADB's clean energy and environment \nprograms,  including  the  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative,  Carbon  Market  Initiative  (CMI),  and \nSustainable Transport Initiative. \n \n26.  ADB has initiated a range of energy programs including the Energy Efficiency Initiative10 \nto increase the number of clean energy projects in Asia and the Pacific. One of the key \ncomponents of the program is the CMI, which provides technical support and up-front financing \nfor clean energy projects with greenhouse gas mitigation benefits. The CMI is a value-added \nservice extended to renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in Asia and the Pacific that \nare suitable for ADB financing. It contributes to ADB\u2019s sustainable development efforts by \nproviding additional financial incentives to project developers and sponsors to construct and \noperate clean energy projects. In Indonesia, ADB provided technical assistance to develop \ninstitutional capacity to process and promote CDM projects.11 \n                                                 \n9   More information is available at http://cdm.unfccc.int/index.html \n10 Launched in July 2005, with the aim of investing $1 billion per year on clean energy from 2008 to 2010 \n11 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Institutionalizing the Clean Development \nMechanism. Manila.  ", "    7 \n \n27.  ADB has had a long relationship with the Government of Indonesia and PLN. ADB \nstarted its lending in 1970 and has financed 30 power projects totaling about $3.4 billion and 36 \ntechnical  assistance  projects  totaling  about  $14  million.  The  lending  has  focused  on  the \ngeneration and transmission sectors. ADB Independent Evaluation Department studies for the \nsector show that ADB has a comparative advantage in providing loans for energy, transport, \ncommunications,  social  infrastructure,  and  finance  projects.  The  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment noted that in the power subsector, with few exceptions, the completed loan projects \nsucceeded in achieving their expected outputs and immediate objectives, including the provision \nof additional capacity to match load growth, the removal of transmission system constraints, \nimprovement in system efficiency and reliability, increase in the use of indigenous energy \nresources (hydropower and geothermal), and contribution to socioeconomic development. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for 2006\u2013200912 and country operations business \nplan 2009\u2013201113 support a medium-term growth rate of 6% per annum and highlight the \nimportance  of  removing  infrastructure  bottlenecks  in  the  power  sector  and  establishing \nattractive, effective, and transparent incentives for private sector participation.  \n \n29.  Clean energy and energy efficiency will be the target of ADB's future investments in \nIndonesia.  Investment  in  the  generation  sector  will  be  either  in  the  form  of  public\u2013private \npartnerships  (to  encourage  private  sector  investments)  or  through  the  use  of  guarantee \ninstruments  to  mobilize  commercial  cofinancing  that  will  be  limited  to  renewable  energy \n(hydropower or geothermal power) and efficient thermal power plants14 (with supercritical or \nultra-supercritical boiler combined-cycle gas-fired power plants). ADB's involvement will play a \ncatalytic role by attracting other investors. ADB's interest will be limited to strategic transmission \ninvestments that will (i) link different islands to reduce the overall need for reserve capacity to \nimprove system reliability, remove transmission bottlenecks, and transmit cheaper power from \none area to the other; or (ii) connect two transmission grids across national boundaries where \nboth countries will benefit from cross-border power trading with ADB playing the role of an \nhonest broker. In addition, ADB will promote political-risk guarantees or other guarantees to \nreduce the risk of private investments in power transmission. ADB's focus on distribution will \ncover both rehabilitation for loss reduction and reliability improvement, and new investments to \nsupport new connections.  \n \n30.  Recently the Government requested the International Energy Agency (IEA) to undertake \nan energy policy review for Indonesia, which suggested six areas for priority attention: (i) \ndomestic  energy  pricing  and  subsidies;  (ii)  policy  coordination,  decision  making,  and \nimplementation;  (iii)  energy  sector  investment;  (iv)  independence  and  authority  of  energy \nregulators; (v) harnessing of a sustainable development agenda particularly through renewable \nenergy implementation; and (vi) mainstreaming of energy efficiency and conservation policy. As \na necessary next step of the IEA study, ADB has finalized a detailed sector diagnostics and a \nsector strategy. These studies are in Supplementary Appendixes A and B.  \n \n6.  Development Coordination \n31.  The World Bank's strategic focus is on strengthening the technical and operational \ncapacities of state institutions such as PLN. Together with ADB and Japan, the World Bank is \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2006. Indonesia Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132009). Manila. \n13 ADB 2008.

The policy loans of ADB and the World Bank have the objective of increasing private \ninvestments in the energy sector through public\u2013private partnerships, focusing on clean and \nrenewable energy projects (such as geothermal power investments together with Pertamina \nGeothermal Energy and the $500 million Upper Cisokan pumped storage project), and power \ntransmission and distribution projects including gas distribution.  \n \n32.  Japan's  lending  to  Indonesia  has  been  similar.  About  26%  of  its  total  portfolio  in \nIndonesia is for the energy sector; \u00a5377 billion of development assistance was lent to the sector \nduring 1996\u20132006. Japan has also prepared a geothermal sector master plan, which was \ncompleted in December 2007, and an energy efficiency study, finalized in 2008. Project lending \nby Japan has mainly focused on generation, including both small-scale geothermal and gas-\nfired power plants. In 2009, Japan International Cooperation Agency signed an agreement with \nPLN to finance the $1.8 billion high-voltage direct current link connecting Sumatra with Java to \nmeet the growing demand for power in the Java\u2013Bali grid. Cooperation and harmonization of \ndevelopment partners in the power sectors has been generally fluid with regular invitations from \neach of the key players to participate in meetings or missions and exchange of information and \ndocuments.  Policy  dialogue  was  undertaken  jointly  on  several  occasions  and  this  is  well \nreceived by the Government in light of the Paris Declaration. Key activities and strategies of \nmajor development partners are described in Appendix 5. \n \n7.  Lessons Learned \n33.  During  and  after  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  many  components  of  the  then  ongoing \nprojects had to be cancelled due to inadequate counterpart financing. ADB's last energy sector \nproject  loan15 had  sufficient  allocation  for  counterpart  financing.  However,  difficulties  in \ncomplying with ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguards policies and slow processing of \ncontract awards delayed the implementation of these projects. Although both the projects were \ndesigned to be completed by March 2008, less than 30% of the combined loan amount had \nbeen disbursed as at February 2010. Land acquisition and resettlement has been the main \ncause of implementation delay of these two projects. The proposed Project will not face these \ndelays as it involves no new civil works. \n \n34.  The risk of procurement delays has been addressed through advance procurement \naction for consultant selection and for preparation of bidding documents. ADB's procurement \nspecialists have been involved in designing the procurement plan and its contract packages to \nminimize the risk of future delays. Because the project components involve rehabilitation, they \nwill not trigger any of the social and environmental policy safeguards of ADB.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n35.  The impact of the proposed Project will be reduced CO  emissions by the power sector. \n2\nThe reduction will be about 330,000 tons each year for about 15 years\u2014 a small amount \ncompared with the total annual emission by the Indonesian power sector. Despite its small \nimpact,  nationally  the  Project  will  demonstrate  the  ability  to  (i)  defer  large  investments  in \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2002.

Once successful, a larger operation of a similar type will reduce \nlarge emissions by the power sector.  \n \n36.  The outcome of the Project will be to contribute to PLN's corporate effort to improve \noverall distribution efficiency and improve quality of power supply. Overall loss will be reduced \nto 7.0% from 8.4% by 2013. Customers' power supply voltage will improve in all regions, \nespecially in rural areas. In 2008, on average, each customer\u2019s power supply was interrupted \nabout  6.8  times.  The  project  will  contribute  to  reducing  the  average  number  of  power \ninterruptions per year to three interruptions by 2013. Reliable and higher quality power in the \nhouse will have a positive impact on household income and social activities, especially in the \nevening.  The  increased  longevity  of  appliances  (in  households,  schools,  or  hospitals)  will \nincrease service delivery and economic activities.  \n  \nB.  Outputs \n37.  The  proposed  Project  has  five  outputs:  (i)  reduced  losses  in  the  Java\u2013Bali  power \ndistribution system, (ii) incremental sales resulting from increased distribution capacity, (iii) \nincreased access to power by new customer connections, (iv) reduced peak demand and \nincreased awareness of efficient lighting options in isolated grids and selected islands, and (v) \nefficient project implementation.  \n \n  1.  Part 1: Reduction of Distribution Losses  \n \n38.  Output  1.  The  Project  will  reduce  distribution  losses  by  (i)  reconfiguring  electrical \nequipment through optimization of its location and size, (ii) reconductoring or replacing old low- \nand medium-voltage overhead distribution lines, (iii) replacing overloaded low- and medium-\nvoltage transformers with new transformers of appropriate specifications, (iv) inserting additional \ntransformers (splitting feeders into two) in long low-voltage overloaded distribution lines, (v) \ninstalling cubicles that will operate within design parameters, and (vi) new switching stations and \ncapacitors. By 2012, the total savings from loss reduction will be about 400 GWh each year\u2014\ncomprising about 100 GWh in Jakarta, 40 GWh in central Java, 50 GWh in west Java, 180 GWh \nin east Java, and 30 GWh in Bali. The value of the 400 GWh of saved power (assuming a \nmarginal cost of $0.15/kwh) is about $60 million each year.  \n \n39.  Output 2. Incremental sales are the additional energy the distribution network will be \nable to distribute to customers because of the optimization of its distribution system. As some of \nthe bottlenecks will be removed, the network's overall capacity will increase because of the \nProject. Incremental sales will be the result of (i) reconfiguring the equipment, (ii) reconductoring \nboth low- and medium-voltage overhead lines, (iii) additional transformer capacity, and (iv) \ncapacitors that will reduce reactive power. The overall incremental sales will be about 635 GWh \nper year, with about 175 GWh in Jakarta where, for each square kilometer (km), PLN's load \ndensity is about 2.2 MW serving about (6,800 people), and about 85 GWh in central Java, \nwhere the load density is 68 kilowatts (kW), serving about 980 people. \n \n40.  Output 3. Increased access to power is an indirect output of this Project. The energy \nsaved in output 1 will be enough to connect about 1.2 million new customers to the grid in \nJakarta (275,000), central Java (110,000), west Java (110,000), east Java (620,000), and Bali \n(85,000). As a result, the waiting time for new connection will be reduced. The waiting list for \nnew connection has grown from 414,000 in 2004 to about 800,000 in 2008. At the end of 2008, \nwhile PLN connected about 800,000 new customers, another 819,000 were on the waiting list\u2014", "10   \n \n225,000 in west Java, 200,000 in Jakarta, 210,000 in central Java, 160,000 in east Java, and \n24,000 in Bali. Larger numbers of customers will be connected through incremental sales. \n \n  2.  Part 2: Efficiency Lighting Pilot  \n \n41.  Output 4. Reduced peak demand in pilot areas will be achieved by promoting energy \nefficient lighting solutions to residential customers. Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are a \nwell-established alternative to incandescent light bulbs. According to recent IEA studies,16 about \n25% of the energy consumed by CFLs is converted to visible light compared with just 5% for a \nconventional incandescent lamp. Hence a typical CFL consumes about 20%\u201325% of the energy \nused  by  an  incandescent  light  bulb  for  the  same  level  of  light.  Put  simply,  if  1  million \nincandescent bulbs are replaced with CFLs at a cost of about $1.0 million, the electricity \ndemand will be reduced by 50 MW. The impact on the power system will be the same as \nbuilding a new 50 MW power station, which may cost at least $50 million, another $2 million\u2013$3 \nmillion each year to operate, and take 3\u20134 years to construct. \n \n42.  Electricity consumption by Indonesia\u2019s residential sector varies widely across different \nincome classes in rural and urban areas. However, more than 50% of the electricity is used for \nlighting by residential customers, making efficient lighting the main focus for immediate energy \nefficiency gains. Under this Project about 500,000 CFLs and LEDs will be distributed in selected \nisolated and island grids covering the entire country. Multiple sites (either island grid or isolated \nsystems within the main islands) will be part of the pilot. This will include the distribution of about \n30,000 CFLs on the island of Nusa Penida, which will have a large visible and quantifiable \noutput. Nusa Penida has an installed capacity of about 3,400 kW, of which about 900 kW is \ngenerated  by  wind  and  solar  and  the  remainder  by  diesel  that  is  shipped  to  the  island. \nPreliminary estimates suggest that the maximum demand of 1,900 kW of the island could be \nreduced  by  300  kW  if  efficient  lighting  is  used  by  its  7,000  users.  The  marginal  cost  of \ngeneration on Nusa Penida is about $0.30/kWh that involves burning about 7,000 liters of diesel \nfuel each day at a cost of $7,000, including transport cost. This could be reduced by 30%\u2014a \npotential saving of $800,000 each year\u2014if each family on the island replaced their incandescent \nbulbs  with  low-wattage  CFLs  or  equivalent  LEDs.  A  detailed  description  of  this  in \nSupplementary Appendix F.  \n \n  3.  Part 3: Project Implementation \n \n43.  Output 5. The Project will also provide consultants to support Project implementation, \npreparation and evaluation of bidding documents, and construction supervision. Although PLN \nhas  the  technical  competency  to  design  and  implement  similar  projects,  implementation \nconsultants will support PLN to implement the project within the tight 2-year time frame. In \naddition, the consultant will assist PLN in all aspects of procurement and will also ensure that \nthe design is the least-cost solution for the individual region.  \n \nC.  Investments \n44.  Under the Project, the following investments will be made in the five regions of Java\u2013\nBali. The investment in equipment will be supported by implementation consultants to ensure \ntimely delivery of the outputs.  \n \n                                                 \n16 International Energy Agency. 2006.

Jakarta Region  \n45.  The distribution network in the Jakarta region has been progressively overloaded over \nthe years and needs urgent rehabilitation. The medium-voltage feeders are short and the main \npart of the network is underground. The sustained heavy feeder loads have damaged parts of \nthe  distribution  network.  Hence,  system  reconfiguration,  including  reinforcement  by  new, \nefficiently located urban substations, is required to reverse this situation. In Jakarta and the \nTangerang region the Project will (i) install around 226 additional distribution transformers with \n315 kilovolt-amperes (kVA), 400 kVA, 630 kVA, and 1,000 kVA ratings; (ii) upgrade 77 existing \ndistribution transformers and connecting low-voltage lines; (iii) lay about 180 km of medium-\nvoltage underground cables and about 25 km of overhead distribution lines; and (iv) connect 21 \nadditional distribution transformers on the medium-voltage overhead line in the industrial areas \nof Tangerang and Kebayoram. \n \n2.  West Java  \n46.  In west Java and Banten, most feeder lines are long, resulting in high losses and a \nnetwork that operates on a poor power factor of less than 0.85.17 The city of Bandung faces a \nlarge number of outages each year as feeder lines are overloaded. The Project will procure new \nefficient transformers, and shorten the length of feeder lines to reduce losses to improve the \nquality of supply, especially in the main industrial areas. The Project will cover Bandung (the \ncapital city of west Java), Banten (the capital of Banten province), Bekasi, Depok and Karawang \n(industrial areas near Jakarta), and Bogor.  \n \n47.  The Project will (i) add 15 new switching stations on land already owned by PLN; (ii) \ninstall new medium-voltage feeder lines (about 249 km of underground cables and 45 km of \nmedium-voltage overhead distribution lines); (iii) reconductor around 160 km of medium-voltage \ndistribution lines; (iv) install or replace 62 medium-voltage cubicles in switching stations; (v) \nmotorize 110 remote-controlled reclosers, load break switches,18 and cubicles; (vi) install around \n350 new pole-mounted distribution transformers, and 6  transformers (400 kVA and 630 kVA) \nconnected by 150 km of low-voltage distribution lines equipped with twisted cable; (vii) upgrade \n108  distribution  transformers;  (viii)  replace  around  50  km  of  low-voltage-line  conductors, \nchanging from 35 square millimeter bare conductors to low-voltage twisted cable; and (ix) \nreplace 915 low-voltage panels in the distribution transformers.  \n \n3.  Central Java \n48.  The central Java distribution system supplies large rural areas and some big cities. In \nrural areas, the single-phase system is unable to cope with load density and growth. The long \nfeeder length, which in some cases exceeds 60 km, causes large voltage drops and high \nlosses. The power factor (about 0.8) is also seen as a problem in this region. In central Java \n(central  Java  and  Jogyakarta),  the  Project  will  (i)  transform  about  85  km  of  single-phase \nmedium-voltage lines to three-phase lines; (ii) upgrade about 61 km of three-phase medium-\nvoltage lines; (iii) upgrade 2,888 pole-mounted distribution transformers according to the above \nupgrading; and (iv) install 13 capacitors banks along 13 medium-voltage feeder lines. \n \n                                                 \n17 Power factor is the ratio of the real power to the apparent power, and is a number between 0 and 1 expressed as a \npercentage. \n18 An electric switch designed to operate (open or close) a circuit with several hundred thousand volts. ", "12   \n \n4.  East Java  \n49.  The distribution system in east Java is characterized by two different types of networks: \none supplying large industrial customers and the other supplying residential consumers through \nlong feeders. The network is old and overloaded. The Project will upgrade urgently needed \noverloaded feeders and (i) reconfigure around 445 km of medium-voltage lines so that they can \nsupply the main feeder loads to two different switching stations; (ii) upgrade about 510 km of \nmedium-voltage distribution lines; (iii) upgrade about 970 km of low-voltage distribution lines; \nand (iv) upgrade about 1,055 distribution transformers and reconfigure the corresponding low-\nvoltage systems. \n \n5.  Bali \n50.  The island of Bali has many commercial (large hotels and resorts) and high-revenue \nresidential customers, mostly in south Bali; the population in east and north Bali is more rural. \nTwo challenges are faced in Bali: (i) rehabilitating the aged network in the southern part to meet \nquality of supply expectations of the tourism industry, and (ii) improving the reliability of the \nunderground system. The Project will (i) replace about 100 km of low-voltage distribution line \nconductors  and  4  km  of  underground  cables,  (ii)  install  296  pole-mounted  distribution \ntransformers  and  equip  the  corresponding  new  connecting  low-voltage  lines,  and  (iii) \nreconfigure the feeders from New Kuta and Payangan switching stations to optimize the spindle \nsystem. This will need about 18 km of new medium-voltage lines.   \n \nD.  Special Features \n51.  PLN is operating in an environment where the cost of power generation is high and, \ndepending on international oil price variations, the generation cost may even increase further. \nTherefore, there is a strong argument for improving energy efficiency to reduce the volume of \nhigh-cost  (and  subsidized)  energy  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Indonesia  has  large \nnumbers of incandescent bulbs in operation and consumers\u2014especially poor ones\u2014have not \nshifted to energy efficient CFLs to reduce energy consumption. While some consumers have \nswitched to CFLs, others have opted for inexpensive CFLs (three for $1), which are often of \npoor quality and last only about 1,000 hours. On an overall life cycle cost basis these are more \nexpensive than ordinary incandescent bulbs. Hence there is a need to demonstrate and quantify \nthe benefits of CFLs to policy makers and end consumers.  \n \n52.  This project will demonstrate that (i) good quality CFLs can last 10,000\u201315,000 hours \nand can reduce lighting energy demand by 80%, (ii) through competitive bulk procurement the \ncost of high-quality CFLs can be reduced to $1.00\u2013$1.50, and (iii) CDM credit may bring more \nrevenue than the cost of a CFL and its free distribution to end consumers. The planned 500,000 \nCFLs under the proposed pilot in isolated and island grids will save about 20,000 tons of CO  \n2\nemissions each year, and the overall value of CDM credit could be close to $200,000 each year \nfor the next 5\u20137 years, almost offsetting the total cost of the CFLs. Once these benefits are \ndemonstrated and a methodology for receiving CDM credit is secured, PLN may scale up CFL \ndistribution to customers across the nation.  \n \n53.  In 2007, a PLN plan to distribute about 50 million CFLs would have achieved demand \nreduction of at least 1,200 MW of peak system capacity plus associated transmission, avoiding \ninvestment of $1.3 billion of power generation capacity and saving $450 million a year in fuel \ncosts.19  \n                                                 \n19  Saving 500,000 tons of oil at about $900 per ton. ", "    13 \n \nE.  Project Investment Plan  \n54.  The project investment cost is estimated at $120.0 million, including taxes and duties of \n$9.0 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, and interest and other \ncharges during implementation. Table 1 has the overall investment plan.

Financing Plan  \n55.  The Government has requested a loan of $50.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n ", "14   \n \n56.  The Government has also sought a loan from the AFD of $50.0 million. The loan will \nhave a 15-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate in LIBOR \nequivalent to a EURIBOR-flat rate and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement.  ADB  will  administer  the  AFD  loan  in  regard  to  procurement,  recruitment  of \nconsultants, and disbursement, according to the cofinancing agreement to be signed. \n \n57.  The Government and PLN will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement that will be on \nterms and conditions satisfactory to ADB and AFD, whereby the Government will relend the \n$100 million to PLN. The Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility20 will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $1.0 million to PLN to finance \nPart 2, which is on the distribution of CFLs and LEDs. PLN will finance $19.0 million of the \nproject costs including all local taxes and duties. \n \nTable 2: Tentative Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  50.0  41.67 \nAFD a  50.0  41.67 \n     \nMulti-Donor Clean Energy Fund \n   \nunder the Clean Energy Financing \n   \nPartnership Facilityb \n1.0  0.83 \nPT (Persero) Perusahaan Listrik     \nNegara  19.0  15.83 \nTotal  120.0  100% \na  Agence Francaise de D\u00e9veloppement. \nb  Established by the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden; \nand administered by ADB. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements  \n1.  Project Management \n58.  PLN will be the executing agency and has overall responsibility for the implementation of \nthe Project. PLN will appoint the deputy director for distribution and commercial for Java\u2013Bali to \nsupervise the implementation of the Project. The deputy director for distribution and commercial \nfor Java\u2013Bali will appoint a project director who will be supported by qualified staff. The project \ndirector and staff will: (i) monitor the progress of the Project; (ii) supervise the consultants and \ncontractors  under  the  Project;  (iii)  submit  the  necessary  documentation  to  ADB  for  the \nwithdrawal of Loan and Grant proceeds; (iv) prepare periodic reports to ADB, including the \nProject completion report and annual audited project accounts report; (v) manage the Project \naccounts and financial records for auditing; and (vi) monitor the socioeconomic impact of the \nProject. \n \n59.  In each of the five participating regions, the existing technical staff of PLN will implement \nthe Project. The regional manager will appoint a project manager who will be supported by \nseveral technical staff and will be responsible for (i) managing the implementation of the Project \nat the regional level, (ii) carrying out the procurement activities in the region, (iii) supervising the \ncontractors working in the region, (iv) providing support to the consultants recruited under the \nProject, and (v) preparing the necessary documentation for the withdrawal of loan proceeds. \nThe project managers of each region will coordinate the day-to-day activities through the project \n                                                 \n20 Established by the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden; it is administered by ADB. ", "    15 \ndirector in PLN headquarters but will report on their overall activities to their respective regional \nmanager. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n60.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 2 years and will be completed by May \n2012. The detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement  \n61.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB and AFD loans and CEF Grant will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime), and the procurement plan prepared and agreed upon between the Government and ADB. \nTen  contract  packages  will  be  procured  under  the  Project  through  either  international \ncompetitive bidding or national competitive bidding. Equipment for the pilot project for efficient \nlighting will be procured though limited international bidding. All procurement contracts will \ncontain anticorruption provisions as specified by ADB and will address environmental and social \nissues  in  compliance  with  ADB  and  AFD  rules.  Procurement  details  are  provided  in  the \nprocurement plan (Appendix 8). \n \n4.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing  \n62.  The Government requested, and ADB management approved, (i) advance action for \nprocurement of goods and related services, and (ii) retroactive financing for goods and related \nservices. The advance action will cover tendering and bid evaluation up to the stage of ADB\u2019s \napproval of PLN\u2019s recommendation for award of contract before the effective date of the loan \nagreement. The retroactive financing for goods will cover the 12 months prior to the date of the \nloan agreement, with a ceiling of $5 million or 10% of the ADB loan amount. The Government \nwas advised that ADB approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to approve the proposed loan and that ADB financing will be dependent upon the \nGovernment's  compliance  with  all  aspects  of  ADB's  procedural  requirements,  including \ncompliance with the relevant provisions of the loan agreement and ADB guidelines. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n63.  Consultants will be selected and engaged under the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). An international \nconsulting firm will be engaged to manage implementation of the Project. The firm will deliver \n105 person-months of consulting services (15 person-months of international and 90 person-\nmonths of national consulting) following ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method and \nusing full technical proposal. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix \n9. Individual consultants will deliver 18 person-months of consulting services (6 person-months \nof international and 12 person-months of national consulting) for implementation of the pilot \nproject for efficient lighting. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n64.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  PLN.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. ", "16   \n \nThe Government and PLN will also (i) undertake necessary measures to create and sustain a \ncorruption-free environment for activities under the Project; (ii) institute, maintain and ensure \ncompliance with internal procedures and controls for activities under the Project, following \ninternational best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money laundering \nactivities, and the financing of terrorists, and shall require all relevant ministries and agencies to \nrefrain from engaging in any such activities; (iii) comply with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date); and (iv) where appropriate, ensure that relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in all bidding documents for the Project. The Government and \nPLN (i) acknowledge ADB\u2019s right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive and coercive practices relating to the Project, and (ii) agree to \ncooperate fully with any such investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including \nproviding access to all relevant books and records, as may be necessary for the satisfactory \ncompletion of any such investigation. All external costs related to such investigations will be met \nby the Project resources. \n \n65.  To ensure transparency and good governance, PLN will publicly disclose on its website \ninformation on how loan proceeds are being used. For each procurement contract, PLN will \ndisclose (i) the list of participating bidders, (ii) the name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details \non bidding procedures adopted, (iv) the amount of the contract awarded, (v) a list of goods and \nservices purchased, and (vi) the intended and actual utilization of loan proceeds under each \ncontract being awarded. PLN will ensure that all project staff are fully aware of ADB procedures, \nincluding  procedures  for  implementation,  procurement,  use  of  consultants,  disbursement, \nreporting, monitoring, and prevention of fraud and corruption. ADB will organize special training \nfor PLN staff covering all aspects of project implementation and ADB procedures, including \nprocedures  for  implementation,  procurement,  use  of  consultants,  disbursement,  reporting, \nmonitoring, and prevention of fraud and corruption. \n  \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n66.  Withdrawal of ADB and AFD loan and CEF Grant proceeds will be in accordance with \nADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  with \narrangements  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  All  payments  including  payments  for \nconsultants, contractors, and suppliers of the main procurement packages will be paid by direct \npayment. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n67.  The Government and PLN will maintain records and accounts to identify all goods and \nservices financed by loan proceeds. PLN will maintain separate accounts by funding source \n(ADB and AFD and CEF Grant). Each of the regional offices will maintain similar records and \nsubmit annual accounts and financial statements to PLN headquarters for further submission to \nADB. The Government and PLN will ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited \nannually, in accordance with sound accounting principles. The annual Project account will \ncontain detailed descriptions of the sources of receipts and expenditures. The annual financial \nstatements will consist of income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows and related \nnotes to the financial statements. The annual financial statements shall be consolidated for all \nPLN's operations. The audits will be conducted by independent auditors that will be selected in \naccordance with competitive selection procedures acceptable to ADB. PLN will furnish to ADB \nand AFD, not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of audited \nproject accounts and audited financial statements, and ensure that the auditors provide an ", "    17 \nopinion on PLN's compliance with the agreed financial covenants and indicate the details of the \nactual calculation for all ratios.  \n \n68.  PLN will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit them to ADB and AFD within 20 \ndays of the end of the quarter. The reports will be prepared in a format acceptable to ADB and \nwill include, among other things, (i) project progress in each project area, (ii) the status of \ninstitutional development activities, (iii) delays and problems encountered and actions taken to \nresolve them, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, and (v) expected progress during the next 6 \nmonths. Within 6 months of the Project's physical completion, the Government and PLN will \nprepare and submit to ADB and AFD a project completion report in ADB's standard format, \nincluding costs and status of compliance with loan covenants. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n69.  Within 3 months of the loan effectiveness date the project management unit will develop \na project performance management system on the basis of the project design and monitoring \nframework to examine the Project\u2019s technical performance; evaluate delivery of project facilities; \nassess achievement of project objectives; and measure the Project\u2019s social, economic, financial, \nenvironmental, and institutional impacts. \n \n10.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation during Implementation \n70.  As part of its own requirements, PLN will meet stakeholders in each of the five regions \nduring  implementation  with  support  from  implementation  consultants.  During  the  feasibility \nstudy, focus group interviews were conducted with customers to identify the potential impact of \nthe Project in terms of access to reliable electricity and its impact on daily life, social services, \nand business. ADB and AFD missions will meet stakeholders during project inception and \nreview missions.  \n \n11.  Project Review \n71.  In addition to regular monitoring, ADB, AFD, and the Government will jointly review \nproject performance at least twice a year. The review will assess implementation performance \nand achievement of project outcomes and objectives, review financial progress, identify issues \nand constraints affecting the Project, and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution \nand  monitoring  of  compliance.  In  2010,  ADB,  AFD  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a \nmidterm  review  to  assess  implementation  status;  review  project  parameters;  and  take \nappropriate measures including modifying the scope and implementation arrangements, and \nreallocating  loan  and  grant  proceeds,  as  appropriate  given  implementation  experience,  to \nachieve the project objectives. \n \n12.  Financial Performance of PLN and Financial Management \n72.  PLN\u2019s operational and financial performance over the past 5 years has strengthened \nconsiderably. Its net sales (revenue from customers and subsidies) increased by about 170%, \nfrom Rp62 trillion in 2004 to Rp169 trillion ($17 billion) in 2008. PLN\u2019s earnings before interest, \ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) were Rp15.85 trillion in 2008 with an EBITDA \nmargin of 9.6% in 2008. However, overall net income\u2014net of taxes, interests, and payments \nrelated to exchange rates\u2014has been negative for all years during 2004\u20132008. Government \nsubsidies, under the public service obligations (PSOs), contributed a significant part of the ", "18   \n \nrevenue.21 If tariffs are increased to achieve full cost recovery, PLN will be able to continue its \noperations, as it has the overall human resources, systems, and financial, accounting, and \ntechnical infrastructure to run the power sector in Indonesia. Each PLN distribution branch has \nfinance, budget, accounting, and revenue control divisions with experienced staff. Each branch \nhas a computerized enterprise resource planning system to control financial management, \nbudget planning, and human resource management. Each branch produces individual annual \nfinancial statements and budget reports. The financial reports include the balance sheet, profit \nand loss reports, and cash-flow reports. All the reports and activities are regularly audited by \nPLN  branch  or  headquarters  internal  auditors,  external  auditors,  and  state  auditors.  The \nfinancial management system and PLN distribution office staff are considered adequate for \naccounting purposes. Detail assessment of PLN's financial performance is in Appendix 10. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Financial Analysis \n \n73.  The financial analysis of the Project was carried out in real terms using 2009 prices. The \ncosts  include  capital  investment,  physical  contingency,  and  operation  and  maintenance. \nFinancial benefits in the financial analysis were based on (i) the value of the energy saved using \nthe average fuel cost of $0.035 per kWh, and (ii) the value of the incremental sales from the \nincreased capacity of the distribution system. Incremental sales are multiplied by a projected \nPSO margin of 4.5%. The average financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 19.1%, which \nexceeds  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  2.0%.  The  robustness  of  the \ninvestment  was  evaluated  by  carrying  out  a  sensitivity  analysis  for  changes  in  major \nassumptions. The Project is thus considered financially viable and sustainable. Details are in \nAppendix 11. Detailed explanation of the valuation of the benefits and the methodology for \ncalculation is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n74.  The estimation of the project net present value and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nis carried out in two cases: (i) a conservative case, using only the loss-reduction benefits; and (ii) \nusing both incremental sales and loss reduction. For case (i), the Project's EIRR is estimated at \n35.9%. The net economic present value at a 12% discount rate is $202 million. When the benefits \nof increased, sales are added to the benefits of loss reduction and the economics of the project \nbecome even stronger. With the proxy value of increased sales at almost Rp1,000/kWh (the \ndifference between the captive power price and supply cost) the EIRR is more than 100% and the \nproject's net present value is about $1.4 billion. The detailed economic analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nC.  Environmental Benefits and Social Safeguards \n \n1.  Environmental Aspects \n75.  ADB has discussed with PLN the types of distribution lines and devices that will be \ninstalled, the types of waste that could be generated during the implementation of the project, \nand PLN's corporate management strategy for handling such waste materials. Most capacitors \nand transformers will be newly installed and some will be reinforced, new distribution lines will \nbe installed, mostly pole-mounted transformers will be added, and no new substations will be \nbuilt.  Waste  generated  will  be  minimized  and  contain  no  hazardous  materials.  PLN  also \n                                                 \n21 Subsidy as percentage of total revenue: 5.6% in 2004 and 49.6% in 2008. ", "    19 \nconfirmed that no circuit breakers and capacitors will be decommissioned under the Project. \nSuch activities do not require UKL/UPL (environmental management certificate) according to \nthe Government's AMDAL or environmental impact assessment process law. The Project is \nassessed environment category C, and as such, according to ADB's Environment Policy (2002) \nand Operations Manual Section F1/OP (2006), an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or \nInitial Environmental Examination (IEE) is not required.  \n \n2.  Resettlement  \n76.  The  Project  will  not  involve  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  All  rehabilitation \nactivities will be undertaken on land already owned or leased by PLN or within premises of \nexisting facilities. Idle land owned by the Government is often occupied by squatters, but PLN \nhas confirmed that no such cases are involved in this project. PLN also confirmed that the \nproject activities in central and east Java will not involve any involuntary resettlement.  \n \n77.  ADB's Project Appraisal Mission visited both of these sites and confirmed this claim. On \nthe basis that no resettlement impacts are envisaged, the resettlement impact of the Project will \nbe category C and therefore no resettlement plan is required. If the Project changes and needs \nto be recategorized, a resettlement plan will be prepared at that time.  \n \n3.  Social Aspects \n \n78.  The Project will not have any negative impact on ethnic minority groups; overall the \neffects will be significantly positive because customers from all ethnic groups will benefit from \nthe Project. Therefore, ADB's indigenous peoples policy will not be triggered. Appendix 13 \nprovides a summary poverty reduction and social strategy.  \n \nD.  Sustainability \n \n79.  The Project covers investments and activities that are part of the core business activities \nof a power distribution business. PLN has the technical ability to maintain its network and has \nplans for it. Financing is also not constrained as the Government has been providing subsidies \nwhich consistently cover the shortfall in revenue. The only remaining risk is high oil prices in \nfuture if the reliance on oil continues.  \n \nE.  Risks \n \n80.  This Project involves no new technology and PLN has all the necessary skills to design \nand implement the project components, making it a less risky project in terms of design and \nimplementation.  \n \n81.  Lack of power generation in the system is a risk. Distribution investment alone will not \nimprove  power  supply  reliability  and  quality  unless  there  is  sufficient  power  to  distribute. \nHowever,  PLN's  efforts  to  mobilize  financing  from  both  internal  and  external  resources  is \nshowing  results,  as  about  2,500  MW  of  additional  generation  capacity  in  Java  will  be \ncommissioned between 2010 and 2012. PLN has also identified the following specific risks: (i) a \nstronger growth of electricity demand would result in an overuse of existing equipment (reducing \nits lifespan), (ii) a worsening financial situation would exist if revenues are lower than expected \nbecause  of  delay  in  the  payment  of  subsidies  by  the  Government,  and  (iii)  insufficient \ninvestment  from  IPPs  would  delay  the  much-needed  investments  in  generation.  PLN  has \nestablished the following mitigation measures: (i) investments to rehabilitate and optimize the ", "20   \n \ndistribution  network  to  reduce  overloading  and  promote  demand  management  to  reduce \ndemand; (ii) arrangements to raise capital from the market and through borrowing so that \ninvestments can be implemented in a timely manner; and (iii) the introduction of higher tariffs \nand terms to secure primary energy requirements through long-term contracts, etc. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n82.  In addition to standard assurance, the Government and PLN have given the following \nproject-specific assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government and PLN will ensure that throughout the implementation of the \nProject, adequate budgetary allocation of the required counterpart funds are \napproved and released in a timely manner to ensure proper implementation of \nthe Project. \n \n(ii)  The Government and PLN will ensure that the implementation of the Project will \n(a) be conducted in a manner that will not cause any adverse environmental \nimpact,  and  (b)  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  laws  and \nregulations, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).  \n \n(iii)  The Government and PLN will ensure that the implementation of the Project will \nnot require any land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. Nevertheless, in \nthe  event  that  any  project-related  activity  will  cause  land  acquisition  and/or \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  the  Government  and  PLN  will  promptly  prepare  a \nresettlement  plan  and  other  requirements  set  out  in  ADB's  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995).  \n  \n(iv)  PLN will perform all actions necessary to ensure that, beginning 1 January 2012, \nit will achieve a self-financing ratio of at least 15% (fifteen percent) and produce, \nfor each of its fiscal years after fiscal year ending on 31 December 2011, cash \nfrom internal sources equivalent to not less than 15% (fifteen percent) of the \nannual  average  of  PLN's  capital  expenditures  incurred,  or  expected  to  be \nincurred, for that year and the succeeding fiscal years. \n \n(v)  PLN will perform all actions necessary to ensure that, (a) it will not incur any \ndebt, unless its net revenues for the twelve (12) months prior to the date of \nsuch incurrence will be at least 1.2 times for the period beginning 1 January \n2011 and at least 1.5 times for the period beginning 1 January 2012, of its \nestimated maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding fiscal year \non all its debt, including the debt to be incurred \n \n(vi)  PLN will maintain, for its fiscal year ending on (a) 31 December 2011, a ratio of \ntotal operating expenses to total operating revenue not higher than 87% (eighty \nseven percent), and (b) 31 December 2012, a ratio of total operating expenses to \ntotal operating revenue not higher than 80% (eighty percent). \n \n(vii)  By  July  2010,  PLN  will  publicly  disclose  on  its  website  the  breakdown,  by \ncustomer class, of its cost of its electricity supply for fiscal year 2009 into three \n(3) components, namely generation, transmission, and distribution and make \nsimilar disclosure in July of the succeeding years for the relevant fiscal year. \n ", "    21 \n(viii)  The  Government  and  PLN  will  continue  their  cost  reduction  initiatives  by \nchanging the generation mix and improvement of energy efficiency. In addition \nPLN will have (a) a gradual increase in the amount of its cost of operation that \ncan be recovered from its customers, and (b) a gradual decrease in its reliance \non government subsidies.  \n \n83.  Prior to the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement, the following will have occurred: \n \n(i)  the Loan Agreement between AFD and the Government will have been duly \nexecuted and delivered, and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other \nthan  a  condition  requiring  effectiveness  of  the  Loan  Agreement)  fulfilled  or \narrangements satisfactory to ADB have been made for the fulfillment thereof \nwithin a period of time satisfactory to ADB;  \n \n(ii)  the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and PLN, in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB and AFD, have been duly executed and delivered \nand  become  fully  effective  and  binding  upon  the  Government  and  PLN  in \naccordance with its terms; and \n \n(iii)  the Grant Agreement between ADB and PLN will have been duly executed and \ndelivered and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other than a condition \nrequiring effectiveness of the Loan Agreement) fulfilled. \n \n \nVI.

Background \n1.  Indonesia  is  an  archipelagic  country  consisting  of  17,508  islands  (6,000  of  them \ninhabited), with a population of about 235 million. Geographically, Indonesia is unique with its \nhuge number of islands and vast coastlines. About 65% of the population of the island of Java \nlives in coastal regions, making them vulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise. Indonesian \nislands are vulnerable to earthquakes and high waves because of their geographic location\u2014\nsituated  between  shelves  of  the  Asian  landmass  and  the  combined  Australian  and  New \nGuinean landmass. Indonesia's forest areas are also prone to natural disasters, and volcanic \nand tectonic earthquakes and tsunamis are fairly common. In addition, the islands are subject to \nextreme weather events such as long dry seasons and floods. \n \n2.  Indonesia is vulnerable to the threat of climate change, and therefore it is important that \nit takes part in the global effort to mitigate global warming and climate change. Indonesia plans \nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector, land use, land-use change, and \nforestry. It also plans to invest in carbon sequestration-related activities. The Government plans \nto work with its bilateral and multilateral partners to tackle the threat of climate change. \n \nB.  Contributions to Emissions and the Clean Development Mechanism \n1.  Emissions and Energy Sector \n3.  Indonesia\u2019s emissions per capita have grown almost 150% since the 1980s, and 67% \nsince 1990 (World Resource Institute1, 2007). Up to 56.5% of annual carbon dioxide (CO ) \n2\nemissions are from the burning of oil, followed by coal (25%) and gas (18.5%).2 In 2003, the \nMinistry of Energy and Mineral Utilization published a report which stated that the annual \nemission is 243 million tons of CO  (Pusat Informasi Energi, 2005). In 2004, total CO  emissions \n2 2\nfrom the energy sector were 275.37 million tons of CO . The largest share of CO  emission from \n2 2\nthe energy sector in Indonesia (about 40% of the average annual emissions in 2004) was from \nindustry. This was followed by electricity plant (27%), transportation (23%), and household and \ncommercial use (10%).3 To meet the demand, Indonesia plans to rapidly expand the use of coal \nfor power generation, including building more than 10,000 megawatts (MW) of new coal-fired \npower generation capacity. The expanded used of coal will significantly increase the emission of \npollutant such as sulfur oxide, nitrous oxide, and particulate matter. \n \n2.  Clean Development Mechanism and Government's Action \n4.  Indonesia  ratified  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change \n(UNFCCC) through Act No.6, in 1994, and in 2004 it ratified the Kyoto Protocol through Act No. \n17. The Ministry of Environment established Indonesia\u2019s designated national authority in July \n2005. Several consultation meetings with ministries, the private sector, and nongovernment \norganizations have been conducted. The main ministries related to the CDM are the Ministry of \nEnvironment,  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources,  Ministry  of  Forestry,  Ministry  of \nTransportation and Communication, Ministry of Industry and Trade, and Ministry of Agriculture. \n \n                                                 \n1 Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT). Available: http://cait.wri.org/ \n2  Indonesia and Climate Change: current status and policies. Jakarta, 2007.  \n3 Energy statistic (year 2005) from the Energy Information Center, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources \n ", "    Appendix 2  25\n3.  Project  Registered  by  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on \nClimate Change for Indonesia  \n5.  Indonesia\u2019s CDM progress is rather slow compared to other countries, such as the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and India. There are 24 projects in Indonesia registered with the \nexecutive board of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), \nwith total emission reductions of 9,085,392 tons of CO  equivalent (tCO2eq) by 2012, and 127 \n2\nprojects  are  at  or  beyond  the  validation  stage.  Most  of  the  registered  projects  are  in  the \nrenewable energy and waste sectors\u2014seven are biomass projects, five are biogas projects, and \ntwo are energy efficiency projects. By comparison, India has 420 registered projects which \ngenerate 237,934,238 tCO2eq of emission reduction, while the People\u2019s Republic of China has \n530 registered projects which account for 869,778,233 tCO2eq of emission reduction. \n \nC.  Sustainability and Energy Sector Emissions  \n6.  According to a Government study,4 the business-as-usual scenario could see annual \nCO  emissions from the energy sector in Indonesia reach 1,200 million tons by 2025. With \n2\ndiversification of energy sources (the target for new and renewable energy is 17% of national \nenergy  composition)  and  conservation  efforts,  the  CO   emission  reduction  target  from  the \n2\nbusiness-as-usual  scenario  is  17%.  If  nuclear  electric  power  generation  exceeds  the \nPresidential Instruction target of 2% and reaches 11.5%, CO  emissions could be reduced \n2\nfurther by 20%. Optimizing geothermal electric power to 8.4% of national energy could reduce \nthe  figure  further  by  23%,  while implementing  carbon capture  and  storage technology  will \nreduce the figure by 40% of CO  emissions in 2025. \n2\n \n7.  The government supports three mitigation efforts: (i) energy diversification, (ii) energy \nconservation,  and  (iii)  implementation  of  clean  technology  (such  as  carbon  capture  and \nstorage). Solutions that could be immediately implemented are energy diversification, renewable \nenergy,  and  energy  conservation.  Energy  conservation  would  cover  (i)  disseminating \ninformation about energy conservation to energy consumers; (ii) introducing incentives and \ndisincentives through financial mechanisms; (iii) regulating to implement energy conservation by \nall users and implement an energy saving standard; (iv) reducing energy intensity, including \nimplementing  carbon  labeling  in  industry;  (v)  utilizing  science  and  technology  to  develop \nfunctional, efficient, and good quality products; and (vi) formulating and implementing energy-\nsaving building standards. \n \n8.  The National Energy Conservation Master Plan5 quantifies the energy savings potential \nas 15%\u201330% for the industry sector, 25% for the transportation sector, and 10%\u201330% for \nhouseholds and commercial buildings. The Government expects that Indonesia could save \nabout 10\u201330% overall through conservation. Therefore, the demand-side management, with the \nobjective of increasing energy consumers' awareness of conservation and energy efficiency, is \ngiven priority in national energy management. \n                                                 \n4 Republic of Indonesia. 2007.

Indonesia is a country rich in energy resources. It has large reserves of oil, gas, and \ncoal, and it is the world's largest liquefied natural gas producer. Indonesia had 4.3 billion \nbarrels1 of proven oil reserves as of January 2007, however production has decreased over the \nlast  decade  because  of  declining  output  from  mature  oil  fields,  lack  of  investments  in \nmaintaining existing oil wells, and lack of new exploration. Indonesia was the only Southeast \nAsian  country  to  join  the  Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  in  1962,  but \nwithdrew its membership as it became a net oil importer in 2008. Because of its abundance of \nfossil fuel reserves, the economy has always been energy-intensive compared with those of its \nneighbors.  \n \n2.  Indonesian power sector is vertically integrated, and the state-owned power utility, PT \nPerusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation [PLN]), is responsible for developing \nand operating the sector. PLN started its power business in 1965 with about 300 megawatts \n(MW) of power generation capacity and in 2008 it supplied electricity to 34 million customers for \ntotal revenue of $15.5 billion. PLN directly employs about 25,000 people. While PLN maintains \nits geographical monopoly in power transmission and distribution, it shares its power generation \nwith 27 privately owned independent power producers and about 5,500 captive power plants \nthat supply power to PLN under retail contract. In addition, various electricity cooperatives own \nand operate power generation capacity in islands other than Java and Bali.  \n \n1.  PLN and Its Power System \n3.  In 2008, the total power generating capacity, including captive generation, was about \n36,500 MW, of which PLN and the independent power producers owned 29,000 MW. Almost \nthree-quarters of PLN\u2019s generating capacity is located in the Java\u2013Bali system, with the rest \nspread over 600 isolated systems in the islands outside Java\u2013Bali. Despite the Government's \nvarious  initiatives  to  diversify  the  generation  mix,  expensive  fuel  oil  continues  to  be  the \ndominant2 fuel for power generation. The power sector is also a major contributor to carbon \ndioxide (CO ) emissions.  \n2\n \n4.  The  islands  of  Java  and  Bali  account  for  about  80%  of  Indonesia's  total  power \nconsumption, servicing the needs of 60% of the total population, or about 140 million people. \nThe Java\u2013Bali grid is fully interconnected by 70 kilovolt (kV), 150 kV, and 500 kV transmission \nlines, and has a peak demand of 16,300 MW. The peak demand load is expected to grow by an \naverage annual rate of 9.4% up to 2030. The current installed capacity of 22,336 MW in Java\u2013\nBali, including about 3,865 MW from the independent power producers, is not adequate to meet \ndemand growth because of transmission constraints. Hence, the Java\u2013Bali grid needs about \n2,500 MW of additional generating capacity each year to meet the forecast demand.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Source: Energy Information Association. Available http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/Indonesia/Oil.html \n2  Fuel oil represents 25% of generation in 2008, down from 36% in 2007 as a result of high oil prices. In 2008, \nhowever, oil represented about 57% of PLN's cost of power generation.  \n ", "    Appendix 3  27\n \nTable A3.1: PLN's Power Generation Capacity, MW \n \nPower Plant  Outside Java  Java-Bali  Total  % \nHydro  1,052  2,386  3,438  11.8 \nCombine         \n- Gas Fire  884  4,007  4,891  16.8 \n- Oil Fired  0  2,136  2,136  7.3 \nSteam         \n- Gas Fire  0  1,000  1,000  3.4 \n- Oil Fired  1,100  800  1,900  6.5 \n- Coal  0  5,520  5,520  18.9 \nGeothermal  40  360  400  1.4 \nGas Turbine  659  2,086  2,745  9.4 \nDiesel  2,602  76  2,678  9.2 \nSubtotal  6,337  18,371  24,708  84.8 \nIPP  576  3,865  4,441  15.2 \n    Total  6,913  22,236  29,149  100.0 \nMW = megawatts, PLN = PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State \nElectricity Corporation) \nSource: PLN \n \n5.  PLN serves customers over a large area which stretches more than 3,000 kilometers \n(km) from east to west with 31,600 circuit-km of transmission lines and about 566,000 circuit-km \nof medium- and low-voltage distribution lines. In 2008, total transmission and distribution losses \nwere 10.6%, of which 8.4% was distribution loss. The power transmission loss is relatively low \nin  Indonesia  as  its  power  generation  facilities  are  located  close  to  the  load  centers.  The \ndistribution losses vary across the region: 9.3% in west Java, 10.1% in Jakarta, 7.2% in central \nJava, 8.1% in east Java, and 7.4% in Bali. In 2008, the system average interruption frequency \nindex (SAIFI, the commonly used power supply reliability indicator) also varied significantly \nacross the region: 4.7 in west Java, 6.1 in Jakarta, 12.7 in central Java, 3.9 in east Java, and \n7.5 in Bali. A technical assessment of PLN's regional distribution network is in Supplementary \nAppendix C.   \n \n2.  Legal Regulatory Framework  \n6.  The Electricity Act (Law No. 15 of 1985) sets out the overall legal framework for the \nsector.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  is  responsible  for  power  sector \ndevelopment policies and discharges its control and regulatory functions through the Directorate \nGeneral for Electricity and Energy Utilization (DGEEU). The DGEEU is also the sector regulator, \nand its role is to (i) ensure achievement of the National General Plan for Electricity; (ii) formulate \nsector policy and strategy; (iii) optimize the utilization of various energy sources; (iv) establish \nand develop electricity supply, utilization, and operational management; (v) regulate the selling \nprice of electricity subject to parliamentary approval; and (vi) facilitate private investment.  \n \n7.  The Energy Law No. 30 of August 2007 created a National Energy Council chaired by \nthe  President  with  the  authority  to  design  and  formulate  energy  policy  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment; the policy then must be endorsed by Parliament. The main provisions of the law \nare: (i) increase utilization of new renewable energy, (ii) development of incentives for promoting \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency, (iii) market based pricing for energy, and (iv) targeted \nsubsidies for low income customers. The law also requires synchronization of national and \nregional plans, and encourages research and development in energy.  ", "28  Appendix 3 \n \n8.  In September 2009, a new electricity law was passed, which enables local authorities in \nthe  country  to  provide  electricity  to  their  region  from  private  companies,  bypassing  PLN's \nnetworks. Although the state-owned companies will have the right of first refusal to develop new \npower generation projects, the local authorities will be able to approve new projects and private \npower producers will be allowed to propose tariffs reflecting the true cost of power generation. \nThe new law will also (i) abolished the uniform postage stamp pricing3 and allows electricity \ntariffs to be determined by the cost of generation in each region; (ii) developed a role for \nregional governments in setting regional power tariffs; and (iii) allows for a higher price for better \npower supply quality and reliability. \n \nB.  Future of the Power Sector and Sector Projections  \n1.  Power Demand \n9.  Electricity demand is growing in various regions of the country at between 7% and 9%. \nThe DGEEU and PLN predict that this demand growth will continue at an average of about 9.7% \nto 2018. Given this rapid growth rate and declining performance of PLN\u2019s aging power plants, \nlow reserve margins are already causing supply problems, and most regions are experiencing \nload  shedding  and  blackouts.

\nANALYSIS OF TARIFFS, SUBSIDIES, AND SECTOR ROAD MAP \n \nA.  Tariff and Subsidy Issues \n1.  Indonesia has one of the lowest electricity tariffs in Asia. Electricity tariffs have remained \nthe same since 2003, although the cost of supply has more than doubled from $0.056 to $0.132 \nper kilowatt-hour (kWh) between 2004 and 2008. In real terms, the tariffs have actually reduced1 \nby  about  50%  between  2003  and  2009,  while  over  the  same  period  tariffs  for  residential \ncustomers in countries across the region have increased\u201433% in the Philippines, 20% in \nMalaysia, 18% in Viet Nam, and 11% in Singapore.  \n \n2.  Despite  the  low  tariffs,  PT  Perusahaan  Listrik  Negara  (State  Electricity  Corporation \n[PLN])  has  remained  financially  viable  because  of  direct  subsidies  from  the  Government. \nSubsides are an integral part of PLN\u2019s operation, and a key element for its financial viability. For \nexample, in 2008 from a typical residential customer consuming about 100 kWh/month PLN \nreceived about $5 as revenue, which is less than half the overall cost of production and supply \nof about $13; Government subsidy would have paid for the gap of about $8. A customer with the \nsame consumption would have paid about $18 in Manila and about $13 in Singapore. While a \ndirect subsidy has made PLN financially viable and sustainable, the Government has struggled \nwith these subsidy commitments, especially in 2008 when the subsidy level reached about $7.6 \nbillion (up from $315 million in 2004) because of record high international oil prices.  \n \n3.  The fuel subsidy was originally designed to shield low-income groups from the impacts \nof the high oil price, but over time it has benefited all users. Based on government data, the \n40% of high-income earners receive 70% of the subsidy, and the 40% of poor families\u2014the \nintended recipients\u2014receive only 15%. The subsidies have created a vicious circle\u2014every time \nthe price of oil increases, PLN cost of generation in its oil plants increases, forcing it to delay its \npreventive maintenance, which in turn increases losses, increasing the need for more subsidies. \nThe subsidy in 2008 would have been about $13 billion if the entire population had access to \nelectricity.  \n \n4.  In  April  2008,  the  Government  introduced  a  penalty  (or  discount)  mechanism  for \nconsumption above (or below) the agreed threshold within a tariff class. This initiative for \nreducing subsidies was introduced for large residential customers; it also demonstrated the \nGovernment's appreciation of the need for across-the-board tariff increases for PLN. Overall, \nthe financial impact of this initiative was insignificant considering the compound effects of input \nprice increases. Nevertheless, the Government recognizes that restoring PLN\u2019s financial viability \nin the medium term is crucial to enhancing its creditworthiness and avoiding requests by IPPs \nand their lenders for government guarantees against this off-take risk. PLN has published on its \nwebsite a breakdown of the 2007 public service obligation (PSO) by region and customer \ncategory. A new practice to be adopted by PLN will involve greater coordination and dialogue \nwith other Government agencies to develop a 3-year PSO plan to be published on its website. \nThis  will be  closely  monitored  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral \nResources, Ministry of Planning, and other government departments. \n \n5.  The  Government  is  cognizant  of  the  need  to  target  subsidies.  In  2008,  residential \ncustomers received 50% of all subsidies, followed by industry customers (32%) and commercial \ncustomers (12%). Within the residential customer group, only 36% went to customers who \n                                                 \n1  The Indonesian consumer price index increased to161.73 in 2008 from 105.65 in 2003. Source: Statistics \nIndonesia. \n ", "    Appendix 4  31\nconsumed small amounts of electricity. These low-consumption residential customers only paid \n10%\u201320% of the cost of supply.  \n \n6.  Indonesia became a net importer of oil in 2005 due to natural maturation of producing \nfields combined with slower reserve replacement rates. The Government increased domestic oil \nprices by 49% in March 2005 and 105% in October 2005. The price of high-speed diesel tripled \nfrom Rp1,650 per liter in 2004 to Rp5,000 per liter in 2006, making diesel-fuelled generation of \nelectricity extremely costly at about $0.22/kWh. The Government has deferred electricity tariff \nincreases since late 2003, opting to heavily subsidize electricity tariffs until social and economic \nconditions  allow  resumption  of  appropriate  cost-recovery  tariff  adjustments.  The  average \nelectricity tariff was increased by 29% in April 2000, 17% in July\u2013October 2001, and through \nquarterly adjustments of 6% during 2002\u20132003. These increases brought the average tariff from \nabout $0.025/kWh in 1998 to $0.068/kWh in late 2003, but no further tariff increases have \nsubsequently been approved. The average cost of generation is about $0.09/kWh in the Java\u2013\nBali grid and considerably higher in the outer islands where generation is mainly provided by \ndiesel units.   \n \nB.  Sector Reform and Policy Issues  \n7.  At the Consultative Group on Indonesia meeting in January 2005, the Government \nasked  ADB  to  provide  medium-term  support  for  infrastructure  reforms  and  thereby  help \nimplement the country's medium-term development plan. This request led to an intensification of \nADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government and other development partners. ADB, the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank jointly prepared six policy briefs on \nissues and constraints facing the main infrastructure sectors (including the power sector) and on \nreforms needed to address them. Building on these efforts, the Government took a range of \ncritical steps to set the pace for reforms. In February 2006, it released the infrastructure policy \npackage and this resulted in the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (IRSDP) \nloan series consisting of three subprograms starting in 2006 and ending in 2010. Looking at the \npower  sector  alone,  the  IRSDP  includes  eight  policy  actions  leading  to  20  outputs  to  be \nachieved during the 5-year program cycle.  \n \n8.  The reforms for the power sector are challenging but progress has been achieved under \nthe first two subprograms (the second one was approved in November 2008) with the third one \nscheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2010. This policy loan mandates an active and \nongoing dialogue between the Government and ADB, and is conditional on progress being \nmade. Therefore, ADB, together with the DGEEU, PLN, and Ministry of Energy and Mineral \nResources, frequently discusses the policy actions and the progress. A summary of the power \nsector reforms included under the IRSDP is in Table A4.1. \n \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \n \nTable A4.1: Targeted Power Sector Reforms by ADB under the Infrastructure Reform \nSector Development Program \n \nPolicy Action  Implementation Status \nPolicy Action No. 1  1.

Road Map for the Sector  \n10.  The  sector  strategy  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  plan  to  target  subsidies  more \naccurately based on affordability by consumer groups, and help the Government to establish \ncredible and effective regulatory bodies responsible for overseeing the setting of electricity \ntariffs  and  ensuring  that  the  electricity  tariff  balances  the  needs  of  the  public  and  private \ninvestors. On the conventional energy side, the medium-term strategy will be to attract more \nprivate  investors  for  generation  through  improved  regulatory  certainty  and  clearly  targeted \nsubsidies, which will be equally passed to the operators\u2014private or publicly owned\u2014that are \nasked to meet PSO obligations. Support for developing clean coal, coal-based methane, and \ncoal-mine  methane  generation  will  be  a  priority.  The  transmission  sector  will  cover  new \ntransmission lines to remove transmission bottlenecks and improve connectivity across regions \nto deliver power at least cost. Distribution network investment will target rehabilitation of old \ndistribution networks. Off-grid distribution will be used for isolated remote areas, making power \naccessible to the rural poor. Maximum support will be given to regions experiencing electricity \ncrises  where  power  rehabilitation  and  re-powering  generation  will  bring  rapid  benefits. \nIncentives will be established for captive power producers and for PLN to enter into load-sharing \ncontracts to use surplus captive power.  \n \n11.  Aggressive energy efficiency programs and demand-side management initiatives are the \npaths that offer most hope in the meantime for easing the power shortages at an affordable \ncost. Six building blocks will be used to streamline action and plans for energy efficiency: \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \n \n(i)  Promote efficient lighting in all areas. Promote use of compact fluorescent \nlighting for all residential customers, especially the poor customers in rural areas; \nimprove the overall quality of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) through better \nlabeling and monitoring; improve efficiency in public lighting; and make financing \navailable for efficient public lighting programs. \n \n(ii)  Develop  appliance  and  equipment  labeling  and  minimum  energy \nperformance  standards.  Implement  mandatory  labeling  for  all  household \nappliances, establish testing laboratories for certification and monitoring, and \nreduce standby losses.  \n \n(iii)  Make  buildings  more  energy  efficient.  Establish  minimum  performance \nstandards for new and renovated buildings, revise residential and commercial \nbuilding  codes  for  better  lighting  and  heat  management,  develop  minimum \nenergy performance standards integrated into the mandatory product quality and \nsafely  standards,  and  develop  action  plans  to  improve  energy  efficiency  for \ncommercial  and  government  office  buildings,  especially  load-shifting  for \ncentralized airconditioning and cogeneration.  \n \n(iv)  Make  power  generation  and  distribution  more  efficient.  Improve  energy \ntransformation losses in generation from an average rate of 40% or lower to the \ninternational benchmark of about 60%, improve energy conversion efficiency in \npower generation from an average rate of 40% or lower to international best \npractice  of  about  50%,  and  reduce  losses  in  electricity  transmission  and \ndistribution.  \n \n(v)  Facilitate financing of energy efficiency investments. Offer revolving fund \nand other financing packages for small and medium-sized enterprises, establish \nelectricity service companies for energy audit and energy efficiency programs \nbased  on  fair  benefits  sharing  schemes,  support  system  and  process \noptimization for industrial projects, develop targeted use of tax benefits for priority \nenergy efficiency and environmental projects, promote certified energy efficient \nappliances and equipment using tax incentives, and develop appropriate tariff-\nbased incentives for energy efficiency.  \n \n(vi)  Raise  energy  efficiency  awareness.  Raise  awareness  of  current  product \nlabeling to customers, especially policy makers and business leaders; develop \neducation and training plans and programs for energy managers in industry and \nutilities; develop teaching aids for primary, secondary, and vocational educational \ncurricula  through  community  programs;  and,  through  cooperation  with  local \ncommunity groups, develop and publish industrial and commercial benchmarking \naudit programs. \n ", "    Appendix 5  35\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION \n \nA.  Major Development Partners: Strategic Foci and Key Activities  \n \n1.  Asian Development Bank (ADB). ADB financed seven projects with loans totaling \n$1,987 million for the energy sector. ADB's supported strategies for competitive power sector \nthrough sector restructuring. After the financial crisis that hit Indonesia in 1997, ADB provided \nfive quick-disbursing loans, which included $400 million for two loans for the energy sector with \npurposes to (i) restructure the power sector, (ii) develop a competitive electricity market with \nmultiple  sellers  and  multiple  buyers  in  the  Java-Bali  region,  and  (iii)  build  capacity  for \nestablishment of competitive electricity markets. In 2002, ADB financed two loans: one loan1 for \nrenewable  energy  development,  which  packaged  a  variety  of  subprojects  (8  miniature \nhydropower plants, 2 small hydropower plants, 2 geothermal plants); and a second loan2 for \nexpansion of PLN\u2019s transmission capacity, which are currently under implementation.   \n \n2.  Since 2005, ADB, joined Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank \nand have been the Government\u2019s principal development partners in the power sector. Given the \nimportance of power sector reforms for the medium and long term plans of the Government, the \nthree donors joined hands to work on the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \ninitiated  in  2005  and  set  to  be  completed  in  2010  focusing  on  key  policy  action  items \nharmonized into a common agenda covering a review of tariffs, targeted subsidies, possibility of \na  proper  regulator,  and  transparency  in  public-private  partnerships  for  independent  power \nproducer contracts.  \n \n3.  Australian Aid (AusAID). The Government of Australia's overseas aid comprehensive \nplan follows the $1 billion Australia Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development \nprogram  (AIPRD),  which  articulated  Australia\u2019s  long-term  commitment  to  Indonesia\u2019s \ndevelopment. Australia plans to incorporate climate change principles across the program. \nAustralia  has  made  small  but  significant  gains  towards  addressing  Indonesia\u2019s  poor \ninfrastructure and low investment in the water and sanitation area, which has been a significant \narea of Australia\u2019s development assistance to Indonesia since the 1970s. It recently provided \nADB $3.5 million\u2013$2.0 million for water and sanitation area and $1.5 million for geothermal \ndevelopment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector. Australia\u2019s primary \nintervention for Indonesia is to reduce greenhouse emissions from deforestation and support \nsustainable forest management through the forests and climate initiative. Australia will work with \ngovernments and local communities in Kalimantan to trial approaches to reducing deforestation, \nhelping to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n4.  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  financed  a  $500  million  loan  ($200 \nmillion in 2008 and $300 million in 2009) under the umbrella of \u201cClimate Change Program Loan\u201d \njointly with the Government of Japan. The loan has been disbursed and fully blended into \nGovernment's  budget.  Its  purpose  is  to  support  policy  reforms  in  favor  of  climate  change \nmitigation and adaptation. The agreed policy matrix covers a range of issues: (i) reduction of \nemissions of greenhouse gases (forestry, energy and industry), (ii) adaptation to climate change \n(water and agriculture) and (iii) cross-cutting activities (spatial planning, CDM, etc.). The policy \nmatrix encompasses all expected regulatory reforms and public actions to tackle the threat of \nclimate change: laws and decrees, pilot projects, master plans, etc.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB 2002.

European Union. European Union conducted in December 2009, a national conference \nworkshop on Solar Photovoltaic development in potential for Indonesia including overview of \npolicies on energy and rural development. The scope covers development of design of solar \npower and installation Tool Kit and developing awareness among end users.  \n \n6.  Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). About 26% of Japan's total portfolio \nin Indonesia is for the energy sector; \u00a5377 billion of development assistance was lent to the \nsector during 1996\u20132006. Japan has also prepared a geothermal sector master plan, which was \ncompleted in December 2007, and an energy efficiency study, finalized in 2008. Project lending \nby Japan has mainly focused on generation, including both small-scale geothermal and gas-\nfired power plants. In 2009, Japan International Cooperation Agency signed an agreement with \nPLN to finance the $1.8 billion high-voltage direct current link connecting Sumatra with Java to \nmeet the growing demand for power in the Java\u2013Bali grid.  \n \n7.  World Bank. The World Bank's strategic focus is on strengthening the technical and \noperational capacities of the state institutions such as PLN. Together with ADB and Japan, the \nWorld  Bank  is  supporting  effective  targeting  of  electricity  subsidies  and  development  of  a \nsustainable pricing policy. The policy loans of ADB and the World Bank have the objective of \nincreasing  private  investments  in  the  energy  sector  through  public\u2013private  partnerships, \nfocusing on clean and renewable energy projects (such as geothermal power investments \ntogether  with  Pertamina  Geothermal  Energy  and  the  $500  million  Upper  Cisokan  pumped \nstorage project), and power transmission and distribution projects including gas distribution.  \n \nB.  Institutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination  \n   \n8.  The government is committed to mitigating climate change and has identified GHG \nreduction  priorities  in  the  energy  sector,  including  (i)  energy  efficiency,  particularly  in  the \nindustrial sector; (ii) renewable energy for power generation (geothermal, hydro and biomass); \nand (iii) low-carbon transport, especially public transport, vehicle efficiency improvements, and \nclean fuels. There has also been a reasonable degree of harmonization of multilateral and \nbilateral assistance for geothermal development. In this respect, World Bank, JICA, and KfW \nhave all joined in their efforts to finance a large-scale geothermal power development program. \nThis includes (a) up to 260 MW geothermal power by Pertamina Geothermal Energy to be \nfinanced by the World Bank; (b) up to 250 MW geothermal by PLN to be financed by the ADB; \nand (c) private sector geothermal projects to be financed by IFC and ADB Private Sector \nOperations Department.  \n \n9.  Cooperation and harmonization of development partners in the power sectors has been \ngenerally fluid with regular invitations from each of the key players to participate in meetings or \nmissions and exchange of information and documents. Policy dialogue was undertaken jointly \non several occasions, which is well received by the Government in light of the Paris Declaration. \n \nC.  Achievements and Issues  \n \n10.  ADB's  support  for  clean  development  mechanism  had  been  mostly  in  areas  of \nsupporting Clean Development Mechanism project preparation, capacity building and Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism finance facility. It is working together with the World Bank to finance a \nrange of projects in the energy sector using the Clean Technology Fund.

Goods and Works Contracts Estimated to Cost More Than $1 Million \n3.  Procurements will be undertaken in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). ADB\u2019s single-stage, two-\nenvelope  procurement  procedure,  wherein  bids  with  separate  envelopes  for  technical  and \nfinancial proposals are submitted simultaneously will be used. ADB's and its standard bidding \ndocument will be applicable throughout the project for all ICB packages whilst PLN's or national \nbidding document may be used for the NCB packages provided that they comply with ADB and \nthe  Government  of  Indonesia's  requirements.  The  procurement  committee  will  open  the \ntechnical proposal first and review the responsiveness of the bidding documents. Only financial \n ", "    Appendix 8  41\nproposals of bidders with responsive technical proposals will be opened for evaluation and \ncomparison. The financial proposals of bidders whose technical proposals are not responsive \nwill be returned unopened. All contracts will be awarded following ICB or NCB procedures and \nthe tender documents will be in English. \n4.  For supplying the main goods (conductors, cables, and transformers), PLN may use a \n\u201cJoint Procurement\u201d platform for bid registration and submission  and one single region will have \nthe responsibility to issue the tender documents, to evaluate the offers and to choose the \nselected supplier on a lowest evaluated cost basis at the time financial proposal is opened based \non the proposal submitted through single-stage, two-envelope procurement procedure, after \nchecking the technical specifications fulfill the bidding documents requirements. An agreement \nwill be signed with the selected manufacturers fixing the unit price of the items. Then each region \nwill  sign  a  contract  with  the  selected  bidders  for  its  specific  needs.  Thus  a  single  tender \ndocument will be issued for each of the main equipment items, i.e.; then 5 contracts will be \nsigned between the 5 PLN regions and the selected manufacturers.  \n5.  The e-procurement procedure presently in service in PLN could be used for the goods to \nbe  supplied  as  per  the  \u201cJoint  Procurement\u201d  system,  provided  that  ADB  single-stage,  two-\nenvelope  procurement  procedure  is  adopted:  (i)  first  the  commercial,  administrative  and \ntechnical responsiveness of the bidders is checked, and (ii) the financial proposals will be \nopened only for the responsive bidders and contract will be awarded to the lowest evaluated \nsubstantially responsive Bid.  \n6.  The main goods to be supplied following the \u201cJoint Procurement\u201d procedure will be \ngathered  in  four  packages:  underground  and  twisted  MV  cables,  OHL  MV  conductors, \ntransformers.  Each  item  of  each  package  could  be  awarded  to  a  different  manufacturer, \nfollowing the lowest unit price of this item. \n7.  All  goods  will  comply  with  the  relevant  international  standards.  In  addition  to  the \nprocurement of the main goods, the other contracts will be Supply and construction.  The \ncontractor will propose a price including the supply of the minor items (joints and dead-end, \nterminal  boxes  and  warning  screens  for  cables,  poles  and  fitting,  insulators,  fuse  cut-out, \nlightning arresters, connectors, etc) and their installation in the network.  \n8.  The Supply and Construction contracts might be divided into several lots, each of them \ncould be awarded to a different contractor. The following table, lists preliminary goods and works \ncontracts for which procurement activity is expected to commence within the next 6 months. \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n9.  Consultants will be selected and engaged under the Project in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).

The highlights \nare (i) no tariff increase since 2003, (ii) the cost of supply increased significantly from Rp615 per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh) to Rp1,318/kWh because of higher fuel costs, (iii) the Government subsidy \nincreased from Rp3,470 billion ($315 million) to Rp83,914 billion ($7.6 billion) under the public \nservice obligation (PSO) scheme, and (iv) increase of debt from 33% to 46% of total assets. \nTable A10.1 summarizes the financial performance of PLN. \n \nTable A10.1: Summary Financial Performance of PLN \n(Rp billion) \n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\nItem Actual Actual Actual Actual Unaudited\nIncome Statement\nRevenues\nSale of Electricity        58,232        63,246        70,735        76,286         8 3,836\nGovernment Subsidy          3,470        12,511        32,909        36,605         8 3,914\nTotal Revenues        62,273        76,543      104,727      114,043       1 69,092\nOperating Expenses\nFuel Costs        24,491        37,355        63,401        65,560       1 12,168\nIPP        11,971        13,598        14,845        16,947         2 0,255\nMaintenance          5,202          6,511          6,629          7,269           7 ,603\nTotal Operating Expense        59,711        76,024      105,228      111,506       1 65,521\nIncome (Loss) from Operations          2,562             519           ( 502)          2,537           3 ,571\nOther income (Interest)        ( 1,118)        ( 2,694)           ( 584)        ( 5,635)          ( 2,929)\nTax Expense        ( 3,185)        ( 2,746)        ( 2,973)        ( 2,547)          ( 1,774)\nExtraordinary Item (FX)           ( 282) 0 2130 0          ( 4,695)\nNet Income (Loss)        ( 2,021)        ( 4,921)        ( 1,928)        ( 5,645)          ( 5,828)\nBalance Sheet\nTotal Asses      211,794      220,843      247,918      273,480       2 91,037\nCurrent Liabilities        17,109        25,897        27,698        40,276         4 4,284\nNoncurrent Liabilities        52,336        55,192        80,381        96,791       1 32,787\nTotal Equity      142,349      139,754      139,838      136,413       1 58,250\nTotal Equity and Liabilities      211,794      220,843      247,918      273,480       2 91,037  \n        ( ) = negative, FX = foreign exchange, IPP = independent power producers \n        Source: PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation). \n \nC.  Issues \n3.  Price Gap between Cost of Supply and Sales Tariff. As shown in Table A10.2, the gap \nbetween PLN's cost of supply and the tariff has grown significantly over the last 5 years. For \nexample, in 2004, the gap for each kWh of Rp33 (cost of Rp582/kWh and tariff of Rp615/kWh), \n ", "    Appendix 10  49\nincreased to Rp692/kWh (cost of Rp1,318/kWh and tariff of Rp626/kWh) in 2008. The cost of \nsupply increased because of the higher cost of fuel, as PLN relies on oil-fired plants. However, \nthe Government has increased subsidies since 2004 to offset rising fuel costs and to maintain \nregulated tariff rates. \n \nTable A10.2: Price Gap and Government Subsidies to PLN \n(Rp/kWh) \nItem  Unit  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 \n(Actual)  (unaudited)  (estimate) \nGovernment Subsidy  Rp trillion  3.4  12.5  32.9  36.6  83.9  45.0 \nAverage Price  Rp/kWh  582  591  628  624  626  626 \nCost of Supply  Rp/kWh  615  726  925  934  1,318  1,081 \nAverage Subsidy  Rp/kWh  (33)  (135)  (297)  (310)  (692)  (455) \n  ( ) = negative.  \n  Source: PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation). \n \n4.  Government Subsidy. The Ministry of Finance has established the rules for subsidy \ncalculation under the Government's PSO scheme. The PSO amount is theoretically calculated \nusing the following formula:  supply cost + margin (%) = electricity sales revenue + subsidy \n \n5.  The  supply  cost  of  PLN  covers  (i)  purchase  of  electricity  from  independent  power \nproducers (IPPs); (ii) fuel and lubricants; (iii) maintenance expense for generation, transmission, \nand distribution assets; (iv) personnel expense; (v) administrative expense; (vi) depreciation \nexpense; and (vii) interest expense and financing charges. A margin is calculated by PLN to \nmeet  PLN's  financial  ratio  covenants,  including  interest  coverage  ratio,  for  its  global  and \ndomestic bonds, and PLN estimates the required margin to be 4.5% in 2009. The subsidy \namount is proposed by PLN to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources as a part of \nGovernment budget and is approved by Parliament. Ninety five percent of approved budget is \nprovided to PLN monthly and remainder is given to PLN after the state auditor has conducted its \naudit. As shown in Table A10.2, PLN received Rp83.9 trillion in 2008. In 2009, PLN budgeted \nPSO subsidy of Rp45 trillion reflects lower fuel costs than in 2008. \n \n6.  10,000 MW Fast-Track Program. PLN is mandated by the Government to promote a \nfast-track program to develop 10,000 MW of coal-fired plants. As shown in Table A10.3, the cost \nof oil-fired plants is extremely high compared with coal- and gas-fired plants. The fast-track \nprogram will reduce PLN's reliance on oil by replacing it with coal. PLN estimates the capital \nrequirements  for  the  program  to  be  more  than  $9  billion.  The  fast-track  program  is  being \nimplemented by PLN, which expects to complete the construction of all the projects by FY2011.1 \n \nTable A10.3: Variable Costs by Plant Type, 2007 \n \n    Variable Cost \nPlant Type  Fuel Type  (Rp/kWh)  (cents/kWh) \nThermal  Coal  263  2.89 \nGas Turbine  Gas  225\u2013387  2.45\u20134.26 \nOil-Fired  Oil (MFO)  1,859  20.42 \nMFO = medium fuel oil. \nSource: PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation). \n                                                 \n1  32 contracts for 10 locations in Java\u2013Bali (7,520 MW) and 22 locations (1,861 MW) outside Java\u2013Bali have been \nsigned (13 contracts were signed in 2007 and 19 contracts in 2008). The total capacity is approximately 9.5 \ngigawatts (GW), amounting to $9 billion. \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \n \n7.  By implementing the fast-track program, PLN projects to reduce the share of oil-fired \nplants from 30.5% in 2008 to 4.5% in 2011, and to increase the share of coal-fired plants from \n38.3% in 2008 to 63.9% in 2011 (Table A10.4). As a result, PLN estimated that average fuel \ncosts would decrease by about 55%, from Rp758/kWh in 2008 to Rp335/kWh in 2012. \n \nTable A10.4: Fuel Mix and Average Fuel Costs Estimates \n(%) \nEnergy/Fuel Mix 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nOil    30.5    23.1     6 .6      4.5      3.7      3.0      3.2      3.7      4.1\nCoal    38.3    40.4    61.1    63.9    61.9    61.0    61.0    61.3    58.7\nGeothermal      3.1      2.9      2.2      3.3      4.2      4.6      5.1      4.8      4.6\nGas    19.9    26.3    22.1    20.7    22.0    23.9    22.7    22.5    24.7\nHydro      8.2      7.3      7.9      7.6      8.3      7.5      7.9      7.7      7.9\n   Total 1 00.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0\nAverage fuel costs per kWh  758.1  502.0  364.1  337.5  335.0  347.7  350.3  371.9  383.6  \nSource: PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation)  estimates. \n \n8.  Effects of Rupiah Depreciation. Following the global financial crisis in late 2008, the \nrupiah has depreciated by about 20% against the US dollar, from Rp9,000 to Rp11,000. A \nweakening of the rupiah will increase PLN's financial burden, because PLN needs to pay foreign \ncurrency denominated expenses and debt services whereas its revenue is denominated in \nrupiah. The PSO subsidy will cover part of the foreign costs, such as fuel, IPP costs, operation \nand maintenance, and interest payments, but PLN has to repay the actual principal of the dollar-\ndenominated loans. About 40% of PLN\u2019s total liabilities are denominated in US dollars and other \nforeign currencies. For the forthcoming bond repayment in 2011, PLN has set up a hedging \ncommittee to mitigate the foreign exchange fluctuation risk, and has conducted a sensitivity \nanalysis of rupiah depreciation to demonstrate its financial robustness. \n \nD.  Projected Financial Performance of Perusahaan Listrik Negara \n \n9.  Projected  financial  statements  from  2009  to  2016  are  prepared  by  PLN.  The  main \nassumptions are that \n \n(i)  the average tariff is Rp620 per kWh in 2009 onward; \n(ii)  fuel costs are Rp4,673 per liter for medium fuel oil; \n(iii)  the average projected exchange rate for 2009\u20132016 is Rp9,250 per $1; \n(iv)  the inflation rate is 5.8% annually for local costs and 2.7% annually for foreign \ncosts; \n(v)  energy sales growth averages 9.9% per annum; \n(vi)  the PSO margin is 5.0%; and \n(vii)  as shown in Table A10.5, the total requirement for capital expenditure from 2008 \nto  2016  is  $60  billion,  and  PLN  plans  to  raise  $40  billion  through  external \nborrowing and $20 billion through equity and internal resources. \n \n10.

Financial Management Assessment of PLN Distribution Branches \n \n11.  Each  PLN  distribution  branch  has  finance,  budget,  accounting,  and  revenue  control \ndivisions with experienced staff. Each branch has computerized enterprise resource planning \nsystems to control financial management, budget planning, and human resource management, \nand produces branch annual financial statements and budget reports. The financial reports \ninclude the balance sheet, profit and loss reports, and cash-flow reports. All the report and \nactivities are regularly audited by PLN internal auditors, external auditors, and state auditors. \nThe financial management system and PLN distribution office staff are considered adequate for \naccounting purposes. However, it is recommended that implementation consultants support PLN \nfinance  and  accounting  staff  to  follow  ADB's  requirements  and  procedures  for  preparing \nwithdrawal applications and maintaining project accounts, because PLN distribution branch staff \nhave no experience in implementing ADB projects. \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nA.

Capital Costs and Financial Benefits  \n \n3.  The project costs include capital investment and operation and maintenance costs. The \ncapital costs for the Java\u2013Bali distribution projects include capacitor banks, medium-voltage and \nlow-voltage transformers, distribution lines, and substations. All capital costs are expressed in \nreal terms using constant 2009 prices. The FIRR was calculated on the basis of the base costs, \nexcluding price contingency and financial charges during implementation. \n \n4.  The financial benefits were measured by (i) the reduction of distribution loss as a result of \nthe improved distribution system, and (ii) the incremental sales from the additional capacity of \nthe new distribution system. Loss reduction and incremental sales in kilowatt-hours (kWh) were \ncalculated by each project component from each PLN\u2019s regional office (Jakarta, west Java, \ncentral Java, east java, and Bali). The calculation for kilowatt-hour savings was conducted by \nusing  a  loss-reduction  formula  by  each  project  component  including  reconductoring, \nreconfiguration,  transformer,  and  capacitor.  The  financial  benefits  from  loss  reduction  were \ncomputed from the volume of loss reduction from the projects multiplied by fuel costs. The \nprojected average fuel cost of $0.032/kWh (Rp356/kWh) was used during the period of analysis. \nThe financial benefits from incremental sales were computed from the volume of incremental \nsales from the projects multiplied by a sales margin of Rp46/kWh. \n \nD.   Financial Internal Rate of Return  \n \n5.  The  FIRR  was  calculated  for  the  Java\u2013Bali  distribution  projects.  The  result  of  the \ncalculation shows that the FIRR is 19.1%. As this is higher than the estimated WACC of 2.0%, \nthe Project is financially viable. \n \n6.  The robustness of the investment was evaluated by carrying out a sensitivity analysis for \nchanges  in  major  assumptions.  Sensitivity  testing  was  conducted  for  the  case  of \noverexpenditure, increase of operation and maintenance costs, and lower benefits in megawatt-\nhours (MWh). Details of the FIRR calculation and sensitivity analysis are in Table A11.2. The \nresults show that all the tests, including the worst-case scenario (combination of all sensitivity \ntests), achieve higher FIRRs than the WACC, and therefore the Project is financially viable. \n \nTable A11.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return for Base Case \n and Result of Sensitivity Analysis \n \nVariables  FIRR \nBase Case  19.1% \nCapital Expenditure (+10%)  17.4% \nO&M (+10%)  17.3% \nBenefit Reduction (-10%)  18.8% \nWorst Case  15.4% \nO&M = operation and maintenance, FIRR = financial internal rate \nof return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n \n \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \n \n \nTable A11.3: Financial Analysis of the Java\u2013Bali Distribution Projects \n \n \nCosts Benefits Net\nInvestment O&M Total Loss Incremental Fuel Profit Loss Incremental Total Benefits\nCosts Costs Costs reduction Sales Costs Margin Reduction Sales Benefits\nYear Rp million Mil Rp Rp million MWh MWh Rp/kWh Rp/kWh Rp million Rp million Rp million Rp million\n0 2010       9 97,321    29,920      1,027,240     5 1,102          9 4,980         356         46       18,179           4,369        22,548     (1,004,693)\n1 2011           4 ,875    30,066           34,941   3 83,739        5 69,614         356         46     136,508         26,202      162,711         127,770\n2 2012    30,066           30,066   4 05,203        6 34,495         356         46     144,144         29,187      173,331         143,265\n3 2013    30,066           30,066   4 13,231        7 36,847         356         46     147,000         33,895      180,895         150,829\n4 2014    30,066           30,066   4 21,873        8 54,188         356         46     150,074         39,293      189,367         159,301\n5 2015    30,066           30,066   4 46,158        9 66,451         356         46     158,713         44,457      203,170         173,104\n6 2016    30,066           30,066   4 72,554     1 ,066,557         356         46     168,103         49,062      217,165         187,099\n7 2017    30,066           30,066   5 03,093     1 ,194,278         356         46     178,967         54,937      233,903         203,838\n8 2018    30,066           30,066   5 31,359     1 ,325,516         356         46     189,022         60,974      249,995         219,929\n9 2019    30,066           30,066   5 61,457     1 ,466,811         356         46     199,729         67,473      267,202         237,136\n10 2020    30,066           30,066   5 86,053     1 ,724,297         356         46     208,478         79,318      287,796         257,730\n11 2021    30,066           30,066   6 01,371     2 ,069,738         356         46     213,927         95,208      309,135         279,069\n12 2022    30,066           30,066   6 06,792     2 ,434,587         356         46     215,856       111,991      327,847         297,781\n13 2023    30,066           30,066   6 06,909     2 ,789,797         356         46     215,897       128,331      344,228         314,162\n14 2024    30,066           30,066   6 06,438     3 ,061,801         356         46     215,730       140,843      356,573         326,507\n15 2025    30,066           30,066   6 03,261     3 ,348,510         356         46     214,600       154,031      368,631         338,565\n16 2026    30,066           30,066   5 99,614     3 ,661,961         356         46     213,302       168,450      381,752         351,687\n17 2027    30,066           30,066   6 00,052     3 ,858,860         356         46     213,458       177,508      390,966         360,900\n18 2028    30,066           30,066   6 00,208     4 ,024,041         356         46     213,513       185,106      398,619         368,553\n19 2029    30,066           30,066   5 98,181     4 ,215,559         356         46     212,793       193,916      406,708         376,642\n20 2030    30,066           30,066   5 95,998     4 ,414,750         356         46     212,016       203,079      415,095         385,029\n21 2031    30,066           30,066   5 96,573     4 ,606,275         356         46     212,221       211,889      424,109         394,043\n22 2032    30,066           30,066   5 98,089     4 ,810,146         356         46     212,760       221,267      434,026         403,961\n23 2033    30,066           30,066   5 99,970     5 ,027,260         356         46     213,429       231,254      444,683         414,617\n24 2034    30,066           30,066   6 01,555     5 ,234,998         356         46     213,993       240,810      454,802         424,737\n25 2035    30,066           30,066   6 02,721     5 ,251,383         356         46     214,407       241,564      455,971         425,905\nFIRR 19.1%\nNPV    4 ,369,143 Rp million \n             4 48 $ million   \n \n() = negative, O&M = operation and maintenance, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n ", "    Appendix 12 55\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Project Rationale \n1.  The Project focuses on the efficiency and reliability improvement in the distribution \nsystem of the five regions of the Java\u2013Bali grid: west Java region, Jakarta area, central \nJava  region,  east  Java  region,  and  Bali  distribution  systems.  The  Project  directly \ncontributes to the Indonesian national distribution efficiency and reliability improvement \nprogram. The national program (also called distribution road map) follows the five-point \nstrategy  (Straegi  53,  Direksi  No.  003/2005).  These  include  quality  of  materials  and \nconstruction,  protection  system  improvement,  interruption  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nquality improvement for transaction points, and supply and improvement of distribution \nlosses. Three main objectives of distribution are achieving high reliability, high quality of \nsupply, and high efficiency. The distribution road map identifies indicators for each of \nthese three main objectives: improvement in the system average interruption duration \nindex (SAIDI) and system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI) for high reliability, \nmaintaining voltage and frequency within the standards for high quality, and reducing \nlosses for efficiency. Improved distribution efficiency and reliability in the above-mentioned \nregional distribution networks will be achieved by installing capacitors, reconfiguring the \ndistribution systems, changing the conductor capacity to reduce losses, and upgrading \ntransformers  and  medium-voltage  cubicles.  According  to  the  PT  Perusahaan  Listrik \nNegara (State Electricity Corporation [PLN]), the distribution road map has been prepared \nas part of the overall sector plan based on least-cost analysis. The analysis is voluminous \nand is not presented in this paper. \n \n2.  The existing transmission system of the Java\u2013Bali grid is already fully utilized; \ntherefore,  the  Project  releases  transmission  capacity  to  meet  the  growing  electricity \ndemand. Additionally, the Project improves the reliability and quality of power which has \nsignificant  benefits  for  PLN  customers.  The  Project  will  create  efficient  and  viable \ninfrastructure that improves access to electricity in a region that is experiencing growth in \ndemand. It also saves foreign exchange spent on fuel imports, and will have a positive \nimpact on the environment. Overall, the poorer households are more vulnerable to power \noutages and thus indirectly benefit more from the Project. The cost and benefits of the \nproject components have been individually estimated and justified at the system level as \nthe least-cost alternatives. \n \nB.  Estimation of Costs \n3.  The economic analysis assesses the economic viability of the Project from the \nsocietal  resource  utilization  perspective.  Such  analysis  compares  the  social  benefits \ngenerated by the Project against its economic costs. The economic analysis compares the \nwith-project and without-project scenarios. The economic analysis is being carried out with \nthe following input information: \n \n(i)  All costs are expressed in 2009 prices. \n(ii)  The Project is analyzed over a 25-year period and no residual values are \nassumed, making the analysis a conservative estimation of benefits.  \n(iii)  Capital  costs  include  physical  contingencies,  but  exclude  price \ncontingencies and interest during construction. \n(iv)  Cost estimates exclude all taxes and duties.  \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \n(v)  There are no nontraded goods in the Project and it is assumed that there \nare  no  significant  distortions  in  the  wage  rate  for  skilled  labor.  The \ncomponent of unskilled labor is negligible in the Project. Therefore, no \nstandard conversion factor or shadow wage rate for unskilled labor is \nrequired. \n(vi)  Operating and maintenance costs are estimated at 2.5% of capital costs \nfor the entire analysis period.  \n \n4.  The total project costs consist of investment in the medium-voltage and low-\nvoltage lines (rewiring, reconductoring, etc.), transformers, and capacitors, and the cost \nof installation and consulting services. The investments are in five distribution branches \nof PLN and the consulting services are in PLN headquarters.

Estimation of Benefits \n5.  Technical losses of electricity in the distribution systems manifest through heat \nlosses in the conductors and transformers. By rewiring and reconfiguring the medium- and \nlow-voltage networks, losses will be reduced. In addition, the systems after the Project \nwith new transformers, new cubicles, etc, will be strengthened, and thus be able to carry \nhigher loads. The benefits of the Project will be evaluated through loss reductions and \nincreased carrying capacity. The kilowatt-hour (kWh) savings for each of the measures\u2014\nreconfiguring,  reconductoring,  installing  capacitors  to  improve  the  power  factor,  and \nupgrading  transformers\u2014are  estimated  based  on  the  methodologies  and  using \nmathematical formulae discussed in Supplementary Appendix D. The physical benefit of \nthe Project are the number of kilowatt-hours of loss reduction (saved) and the number of \nkilowatt-hours of increased sales due to the higher carrying capacity of the system. \n \n6.  The  economic  value  of  a  kilowatt-hour  saved  due  to  loss  reduction  can  be \nevaluated from the supply and end-use angles. In the without-project situation, the loss is \nheat lost in the system. The value of such heat waste is equivalent to the supply costs of \nthe lost kilowatt-hour. In the with-project situation, loss is reduced. Moreover, given that \nthe Java\u2013Bali grid is fully loaded and utilized, each kilowatt-hour saved is being consumed \nby end users. So the economic value of each kilowatt-hour loss reduction is the value of its \nsupply (which is lost anyway without the Project) and the incremental consumer surplus of \nthe end user who consumes this kilowatt-hour. For the increased sale due to a stronger \n ", "    Appendix 12 57\nsystem, the economic value of a kilowatt-hour is the difference between the willingness to \npay and the cost of supply such kilowatt-hour. \n \n7.  According to PLN, the costs of supply of a kilowatt-hour of electricity vary by region \nand by delivery point. It is lower for higher-voltage-level consumers and higher for low-\nvoltage-level consumers. The true costs of supply in 2008 are in Table A12.2.  \n \nTable A12.2: Cost of Electricity Supply at Delivery Point \n(Rp/kWh) \n \nHigh  Medium  Low \n Item  Voltage  Voltage  Voltage  Average \nJakarta  783  850  1005  881.0 \nWest (Bandung)  783  853  1024  887.2 \nCentral (Semarang)  783  849  1011  881.4 \nEast (Surabaya)  783  855  1030  890.0 \nBali  783  859  1012  889.6 \n  Average         885.84 \n \nkWh = kilowatt hour. \nSource: PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation) provincial branches (compiled by the \nAsian Development Bank). \n \n8.  In addition, PLN indicated that the supply by captive producers is very expensive \nbecause it is based on diesel generators, and ranges from Rp3,000/kWh to Rp3,500/kWh. \nAt present, consumers are paying this high price for captive power. Had there been \nenough supply, grid the consumers would be using the grid electricity. As consumers are \npaying for the electricity now, this price of captive power represents current willingness to \npay for the electricity. Thus in this economic analysis, the price of captive power is used as \na proxy for the willingness to pay to value increased sales.  \n \n9.  The Project not only saves energy but also improves the quality and reliability of \npower supply. This results in longer life for electrical equipment and uninterrupted power \nsupply. These benefits are greater for poor households as their capacity to invest in back-\nup power and in voltage regulation and stabilization equipment is lower. Other benefits \nthat have not been quantified are the positive environmental impacts of the Project. This is \nparticularly important given that Java has a high concentration of industry and use of \ncleaner fuels will result in better air quality and fewer pollution-related health impacts. \nOther indirect benefits are that the availability of reliable electricity supports industrial \ngrowth, which in turn creates avenues for employment.  \n \nD.

The estimation of the project net present value (NPV) and the economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) is carried out in two cases: (i) a conservative case, meaning only \nloss-reduction benefits are being monetized; and (ii) increase of sales is monetized in \naddition to the loss reduction. For case (i), the Project's EIRR is estimated at 35.9%. The \nnet economic present value at a 12% discount rate is $202 million. Details of flows of costs \nand benefits over the project life are shown in Table A12.3.   \n \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \n11.  When the benefits of increased sales are added to the benefits of loss reduction, \nthe economics of the project become even stronger. With the proxy value of increased \nsales at almost Rp1,000/kWh (the difference between captive power price and supply \ncost), the EIRR is about 110% and the Project's NPV is $1.4 billion. \n \n \nTable A12.3: Economic Analysis for Efficiency Improvement in Distribution \nNetworks \n \nCosts Benefits Net\nInvestment O&M Total Loss Incremental Avoided Loss Total Benefits Benefits\nCosts Costs Costs reduction Sales Costs Reduction\nYear Rp million Rp million Rp million MWh MWh Rp/kWh Rp million Rp million Rp million\n0 2010        9 97,321      29,920      1,027,240      51,102           9 4,980         886     4 5,268          45,268   ( 981,972)\n1 2011            4 ,875      30,066           34,941    383,739         5 69,614         886   3 39,931        339,931     304,990\n2 2012      30,066           30,066    405,203         6 34,495         886   3 58,945        358,945     328,879\n3 2013      30,066           30,066    413,231         7 36,847         886   3 66,056        366,056     335,990\n4 2014      30,066           30,066    421,873         8 54,188         886   3 73,712        373,712     343,646\n5 2015      30,066           30,066    446,158         9 66,451         886   3 95,225        395,225     365,159\n6 2016      30,066           30,066    472,554      1 ,066,557         886   4 18,607        418,607     388,542\n7 2017      30,066           30,066    503,093      1 ,194,278         886   4 45,660        445,660     415,594\n8 2018      30,066           30,066    531,359      1 ,325,516         886   4 70,699        470,699     440,633\n9 2019      30,066           30,066    561,457      1 ,466,811         886   4 97,361        497,361     467,295\n10 2020      30,066           30,066    586,053      1 ,724,297         886   5 19,149        519,149     489,084\n11 2021      30,066           30,066    601,371      2 ,069,738         886   5 32,719        532,719     502,653\n12 2022      30,066           30,066    606,792      2 ,434,587         886   5 37,521        537,521     507,455\n13 2023      30,066           30,066    606,909      2 ,789,797         886   5 37,625        537,625     507,559\n14 2024      30,066           30,066    606,438      3 ,061,801         886   5 37,207        537,207     507,141\n15 2025      30,066           30,066    603,261      3 ,348,510         886   5 34,393        534,393     504,327\n16 2026      30,066           30,066    599,614      3 ,661,961         886   5 31,162        531,162     501,096\n17 2027      30,066           30,066    600,052      3 ,858,860         886   5 31,550        531,550     501,484\n18 2028      30,066           30,066    600,208      4 ,024,041         886   5 31,688        531,688     501,622\n19 2029      30,066           30,066    598,181      4 ,215,559         886   5 29,893        529,893     499,827\n20 2030      30,066           30,066    595,998      4 ,414,750         886   5 27,959        527,959     497,893\n21 2031      30,066           30,066    596,573      4 ,606,275         886   5 28,468        528,468     498,403\n22 2032      30,066           30,066    598,089      4 ,810,146         886   5 29,811        529,811     499,745\n23 2033      30,066           30,066    599,970      5 ,027,260         886   5 31,478        531,478     501,412\n24 2034      30,066           30,066    601,555      5 ,234,998         886   5 32,881        532,881     502,815\n25 2035      30,066           30,066    602,721      5 ,251,383         886   5 33,914        533,914     503,848\nEIRR 35.9%\nNPV     1 ,973,114 Rp million\n              2 02 $million  \n \n( ) = negative, O&M = operation and maintenance, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present \nvalue.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n ", "                                                                                                            Appendix 12  59\nE.  Sensitivity Analysis \n12.  An analysis has been undertaken to test the sensitivity of the estimated EIRR of the \nProject to adverse changes in key variables. The key risk factors that may affect the \neconomics of the project are cost overrun (increase in project costs as result of bidding \nprocess)  and  reduced  level  of  benefit  realization.  The  benefit  reduction  may  occur \nbecause (i) the calculation of increased sales assumed that all the projected demand \nwould be met after rehabilitation of the distribution system, and (ii) lower generating \ncapacity. To test these factors, two variables are designed: one related to capital costs \nand one reflecting benefits. These have been done with an increase of 20% in capital and \noperating  and  maintenance  costs,  a  reduction  in  project  benefits  by  40%,  and  a \ncombination of the increase in costs and decrease in benefits. As shown in Table A12.4, \nthe EIRR is 17.5% even for the combined negative risk scenario where benefits are lower \nand costs are higher.  \n \nTable A12.4: Sensitivity Analysis of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \nSensitivity  Percentage \n    EIRR (%) \nParameter   Change \n \nBase Case    35.9 \n(i)  Increase in capital cost  +20  29.8 \n(ii)  Benefits reduction  -40  21.3 \n(iii)  Combination of (i)-(ii)    17.5 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "60  Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry and Project Title: Indonesia: Java\u2013Bali Electricity Distribution Performance Improvement Project \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Southeast Asia Department/ \nProject \nModality:  Division:  Energy and Water Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Government  of  Indonesia  has  incorporated  the  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper  in  its  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan, as poverty reduction is a major concern for the Government. The 2005 country poverty assessment for \nIndonesia also found that improved quality social services and infrastructure access are central to poverty reduction and \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. These make access to energy infrastructure\u2014and promotion of economic \nopportunities\u2014the fundamental building block for reducing long-term poverty. The proposed project will reduce energy losses \nin distribution allowing PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation [PLN]) to connect more customers with the \nsame amount of power generation.  \n \nIndonesia suffers from a deteriorating infrastructure sector, with the lowest electrification rates (62%) in the region. The poor \nstate of the power sector severely constrains economic growth. The Government, as a priority, seeks to develop the power \nsector to support the country\u2019s economic development. The main reason for poor reliability and deteriorating quality of \nelectricity is lack of funds for new investment and poor maintenance in the face of continued demand growth. The present \noverload distribution system and higher losses are a direct result of old equipment and poor network and inefficient use of \nelectricity by end users (customers). The power sector needs immediate investment in generation, transmission, and \ndistribution. PLN owns and controls all public electricity infrastructure in Indonesia, and distributes and sells electricity. The \ngrowing demand for electricity can only be met by developing new generation resources or by using existing resources more \nefficiently. Energy efficiency has become a key theme for the Indonesian power sector because of the high cost of energy \nsubsidy to the national budget, low tariff compared to marginal cost of power generation, and a looming supply shortage in the \nJava\u2013Bali system.  \n \nAbout 48% of Indonesia\u2019s 235 million people live in rural areas and most do not have reliable access to modern forms of \nenergy such as electricity, gas, and liquid fuels. Even those who are connected to the Java\u2013Bali grid receive electricity of poor \nquality. The proposed Project will distribute good quality and reliable power to the existing consumers with lower losses.  \n \nThe Project will reduce the power sector's CO  emissions by 330,000 t per year. It will also support registration of the \n2\nproposed Project with the regulatory authorities to capture the value of the avoided emissions as cash flows under the CDM. \nThe proposed Project will improve the efficiency of power distribution in all of its five regions on the islands of Java and Bali. \nPLN will save energy by reducing its distribution losses and at the same time improve power supply voltage to its feeders in \nwest, central, and east Java. \n \nThe Project\u2019s objective in terms of contribution to the sector to reduce poverty was assessed. The Project will not have direct \nsignificant impact on economic growth and poverty reduction since it will not provide electricity in new areas. However, about \n200 MW of equivalent distribution system capacity will be freed as a result of the Project and, using the saved energy, PLN \nwill be able to connect about 1.2 million additional customers to the Java\u2013Bali network. The Project\u2019s contribution to the \nenergy sector will be mainly on loss reduction, which will reduce the cost of power generation for PLN. At present the fuel cost \nof PLN is subsidized by the Government. With reduced fuel subsidies to PLN, there will be savings in Government \nexpenditure, which could be targeted for pro-poor public sector expenditure. High quality and reliable electricity would \ndecrease production costs and increase production for industry. It is assumed that the low production cost and increase in \nproduction would generate more revenue for industry, which could lead to increased labor recruitment.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe Project is classified as general intervention. The Project\u2019s objective was assessed in terms of social impact.  \n \nThe poverty head count in Indonesia has been steadily falling since the post-Asian Financial Crisis level of 23.4% of the \npopulation in 1999. In 2004 the official poverty incidence was just 16.7%. Indonesia\u2019s poor continue to be concentrated in \nrural areas and the rural poverty head count was 20.1% in 2004. The percentage of poor people living in the project provinces \nranges from 3.18% in Jakarta to 21.11% in central Java. The second-highest concentration of poor people (20.08%) is in east \n ", "          Appendix 13 61\nJava (National Socio-economic Survey, 2004). In 2003, Indonesia lost its Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries \nmembership and became an oil importer. Customers in Indonesia are not directly exposed to high oil prices as the \ngovernment subsidizes fuel and electricity. These subsidies are not sustainable when oil prices soar, as was the case in 2008 \nwhen the subsidies were close to $8 billion just for PLN. High levels of subsidies also mean that PLN is left with no additional \nfunds to connect new customers, even though about 38% of the population still does not have access to electricity.  \n \nIn 2005, fuel subsidies made up 25% of Indonesia\u2019s budget, and increased energy subsidies have reduced the Government\u2019s \nability to support education, health, small business credit facilities, and infrastructure development. Although the subsidies \nwere designed for the poor, in 2008 the 40% of high-income families benefited from 70% of the subsidies. a \n \nIn October 2005, the Government increased fuel prices by 114%, which increased the price of kerosene by 186% and led to \nincreases in the prices of household goods. The large increase in the kerosene price had a large negative impact, as about \n110 million people live on less than $2 a day (2007) and many do not have access to electricity. While the Government has \nundertaken many initiatives to mitigate the impacts of reduced fuel subsidies, including a series of targeted community-driven \ndevelopment interventions to establish and improve safety nets, increased investment is still needed. The proposed Project \nwill free up power generation to connect more new customers in the Java\u2013Bali distribution network of PLN.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \n \nThe Part 2, Efficient Lighting Pilot, of the Project will also assist residential customers to reduce their electricity bills by using \nefficient lighting. Some households will be able to save about 80% of their cost of electricity for lighting.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nReliable and improved house lighting will have a positive impact on economic and social activities in the evening. A high \nquality and reliable source of electricity will also increase the life of household appliances for upper and middle-income \ngroups. Hospitals, schools, and other social service institutions will benefit from a high quality and reliable source of electricity, \nand the efficiency of their services will increase.   \n \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nDuring the feasibility study, focus group interviews were conducted with customers to identify the potential impact of the \nProject in terms of access to reliable electricity, and its impact on daily life, social services, and business.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nC&P will be prepared by implementation consultants working with PLN during implementation. \n \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key Issues. It is expected that a better quality and more reliable source of electricity will have a positive impact on \nuse of household equipment, especially kitchen equipment. This could lessen the workload of women in upper and middle-\nincome households. Women running home industries, businesses, and other enterprises might experience lower production \ncosts and increased revenue. \n \n \n2.  Key Actions.
