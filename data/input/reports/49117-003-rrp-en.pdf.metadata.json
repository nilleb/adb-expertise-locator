THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on: (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan (PBL) to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the Facilitating \nYouth School-to-Work Transition Program; and (ii) the proposed inclusion of subprogram 3 in the \nprogrammatic approach. \n \n2.  The program supports government efforts to improve the employability of at-risk youth and \nfacilitate young Filipinos\u2019 transition to the workforce by: (i) improving youth labor market programs; \n(ii) enhancing youth training systems; and (iii) strengthening labor market policies for the benefit \nof the youth. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Subprogram 2 is included in \nthe country operations business plan for the Philippines, 2019\u20132021 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB).1 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Programmatic approach and budget support. The use of a programmatic approach \nwith a PBL and technical assistance (TA) aligns ADB support with the government\u2019s reform \nagenda. Lending provides leverage to catalyze support for difficult reforms, while TA ensures that \ntechnical issues are addressed effectively. In May 2017, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved the \nprogrammatic  approach  and  a  $300  million  loan  for  subprogram  1.2  Through  \n14 policy actions, subprogram 1 implemented reforms to restructure public employment services \nand strengthen labor market activation and skills development programs for the youth. This \nprovided a foundation for the reforms in subprogram 2. Through 15 policy actions, subprogram 2 \nrolled out innovative labor market programs and facilitated access to training opportunities to \nacquire the skills, knowledge, and competencies to enhance the youth\u2019s ability to secure and \nretain a job. \n \n4.  The program was designed to comprise two subprograms with the possibility of including \na third subprogram. This approach allows ADB to pace its support for the government\u2019s reform \nefforts. Demonstrating its long-term commitment to labor market reforms, on 18 February 2019 \nthe government requested subprogram 3 (and a $300 million loan indicative) to continue the \nreform momentum. Subprogram 3 will be implemented from April 2019 to April 2021 and will \ninclude 17 policy actions that focus on expanding  job facilitation services to workers from \nmarginalized sectors to reduce poverty and vulnerability, increasing the institutional capacity of \npublic employment service offices (PESOs), and promoting and facilitating workforce learning in \nkey job-generating sectors. \n \n5.  Background. The Philippines has been one of the fastest-growing economies among the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations member countries since the global financial crisis in 2008. \nEconomic growth averaged 6.3% per year during 2010\u20132018, a substantial increase from the \n4.5% average annual growth rate recorded during 2000\u20132009 and the 2.4% average annual \ngrowth posted during 1980\u20131999. In addition, the unemployment rate substantially declined from \na peak of 11.8% in 2014 to 5.3% in 2018. At the same time, poverty incidence declined from \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2019\u20132021. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2017. Philippines: Facilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition Program (Subprogram 1). Manila. \n \n ", "2 \n26.6% in 2006 to 21.6% in 2016. To maintain this momentum, the Philippine Development Plan, \n2017\u20132022 continues the government\u2019s strong emphasis on inclusive growth.3 \n \n6.  Development  problem.  While  the  Philippines  shows  the  usual  inverse  correlation \nbetween economic growth and poverty incidence, this is weaker than in other economies in \nSoutheast Asia. For example, household income inequality (as reflected by the Gini coefficient) \nis higher in the Philippines than in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nand Viet Nam. Weak labor market performance in the Philippines is largely responsible for the \nlimited decline in the poverty rate despite strong economic growth. Nonwage workers account for \n40% of all employed, and households relying on nonwage incomes are significantly more likely to \nbe poor than households headed by individuals with formal wage employment. Labor market \nperformance also varies between demographic groups, with the unemployment rate of the \nyouth\u2014people between 15\u201324-years old who are mostly entering the job market for the first \ntime\u2014a dominant problem in the labor market. The government has undertaken education and \nlabor market reforms that have led the youth unemployment rate to decline from 15.3% in 2014 \nto 13.4% in 2018. \n \n7.  However, the youth unemployment is still twice that of the national rate. An indicator of the \ndynamism of the labor market is the time it takes for young people to transition from school to a \nwage  job.  In  the  Philippines,  it  takes  up  to  four  years  for  a  high  school  graduate  and  \nup to two years for a college graduate to find a permanent wage job. Young women and youths \nfrom low-income households have the most difficult time integrating into the labor market.4 The \nslow transition reflects a widening skills mismatch. The consequence of slower school-to-work \ntransition  for  young  people  is  rapid  depreciation  of  their  skills  and  difficulty  in  integrating \nproductively into the labor market. \n \n8.  Because it takes the youth so long to find employment, there are high levels of youth not \nin  employment,  education,  or  training  (NEET).  The  NEET  rate  includes  the  unemployed, \ndiscouraged job seekers, or those unable to work because of family responsibilities or disability.5 \nIn Southeast Asia and the Pacific, about 18% of young people are NEET. In 2008 the NEET rate \nin the Philippines was 24.4% and by 2017 it had declined to 21.7%.6 The NEET rate is twice as \nhigh in low-income households than in well-off households and is higher among young women \n(28.4%) than young men (15.2%) (Figure 1). This implies that one in four people aged 15\u201324 \nyears old, or about 4.4 million young Filipinos, are underused and their skills are not being \nenhanced by education, training, or employment. The higher female NEET rate is the result of \nyoung women\u2019s economic inactivity, as they are the household caretakers who are not looking for \nwork or who remain out of the workforce. Young women without college degrees have higher \nNEET rates as well. College education motivates women to enter the labor market earlier and \nstay longer.7 In 2017 young women in the Philippines were almost twice as likely as young men \nto be out of school, not be gainfully employed, or not have finished college or post-secondary \n                                                \n3  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

The high youth unemployment rate increases the risk that the youth group will become \nsocially excluded, with income below the poverty line and without the skills needed to improve \ntheir economic situation. The central policy challenge for the Philippines is to accelerate inclusive \ngrowth by improving the youth\u2019s employability and increasing decent work opportunities to reduce \npoverty. To meet these goals, it is vital to establish appropriate job facilitation and skills strategies. \n \n10.  Binding  constraints.  The  government  recognizes  the  challenges  to  increasing  the \nincome-earning ability of young Filipinos, including the need to: (i) improve job facilitation services; \n(ii) enhance skills development and training systems; and (iii) strengthen labor policies. \n \n11.  Low coverage and quality of public employment services. Individuals from poor \nhouseholds find jobs through informal contacts, which tend to channel a high concentration of the \npoor into informal, low-paying jobs. Job seekers, especially those from poor households, need \nbigger, more formal networks to go beyond the limited opportunities offered by the informal sector \nin their local communities. Therefore, it is important for cities and municipalities to provide quality \nemployment  services.  Improving  the  effectiveness  of  public  employment  services  in  a \ndecentralized  institutional  setup  will  require  three  reforms.  First,  the  government  needs  to \ninstitutionalize the provision of job facilitation services, such as job search assistance and career \nguidance, in key municipalities and cities through local government unit (LGU) PESOs. PESOs \nprovide  access  to  job  facilitation  services  such  as  referrals,  training,  reintegration,  and \nentrepreneurial  services.  These  services  ease  the  burden  for  women  and  members  of \nmarginalized groups (the poor and persons with disabilities) in searching for jobs. Second, budget \nallocations are needed to support PESOs in their core operations, including implementing critical \nlabor market and livelihood programs. Third, PESO managers and personnel should meet \nminimum qualification standards to ensure technical proficiency. \n \n12.  Furthermore, reliable labor market information is not available locally. PESOs have limited \nability to collect labor market information and inform job seekers and students about future labor \nmarket conditions by occupation, in-demand jobs, and skills shortages. The Philippines has been \ndeveloping its national labor market information system through its National Skills Registry \nSystem and a vacancy database known as PhilJobNet.9 However, the various labor market \nsystems have not been integrated to form a comprehensive database to monitor the different job \n                                                \n8  Government of the Philippines, Philippine Statistics Authority. 2018.

Weak skills development and training systems. Skills mismatch is still an issue. Given \nrapid technological changes, jobs increasingly demand more complex and sophisticated skills. \nSocio-behavioral skills, such as managerial, leadership, interpersonal, and communication skills, \nare equally important. Two primary constraints have widened the skills mismatch between young \njob seekers and the skills demanded by enterprises. First, the government has not institutionalized \na reference system of national standards of qualifications earned by individuals educated and \ntrained in the Philippines. This type of system is necessary to support worker mobility, encourage \nlifelong learning, and build employment\u2013industry linkages. Second, closer collaboration with \nemployers is required to better tailor interventions to market needs, including investing in sector-\nspecific training and incentivizing employers to recruit young people by fostering enterprise-based \ntraining programs such as internships and apprenticeships.10 Moreover, workers are unable to \nupgrade their skills regularly. Most young workers, mainly low-skilled, do not have access to work-\nbased learning opportunities and are stuck in low-paying and temporary jobs that lack decent \nprospects for career growth. For example, while the Philippine Employment Projections Model, \n2013\u20132022 identified 10 key job-generating sectors, adequate support has not been provided to \nfacilitate training and upskilling for these sectors.11 \n \n14.  Weak labor policies. Creating decent work and ensuring income security are essential \npreconditions to inclusive growth. There are three primary constraints. First, workers are not \nguaranteed basic income security in case of involuntary unemployment and lack income support \nduring job-to-job transitions, thus increasing their susceptibility to income poverty. Second, \nemployers\u2019 noncompliance with occupational safety and health standards, including the provision \nof gender-sensitive workers\u2019 welfare facilities, is contributing to the rising number of cases of \ndisease and injury in the workplace. Third, the labor dispute mechanism needs to be implemented \nmore effectively to reduce the cost of disputes, which will particularly benefit women and workers \nfrom marginalized groups. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n15.  The government\u2019s reform agenda. The Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022 lays \nthe foundation for inclusive growth. It emphasizes accelerated human capital development as \ncritical for making growth inclusive and reducing poverty and income inequality. Its three-pronged \nstrategy is to (i) increase income-earning ability, (ii) ensure lifelong learning opportunities for all, \nand (iii) improve nutrition and health for all (footnote 3). In addition, a new government blueprint \nfor decent job creation prioritizes entrepreneurship, youth unemployment reduction, education, \nand training. It aims to create 7.5 million jobs mainly in key job-generating sectors such as tourism, \ninformation technology and business process management, construction, and manufacturing.12 \n \n                                                \n10 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and ADB. 2017.

Manila.. \n ", "5 \n16.  Programmatic approach and subprogram 2. The programmatic approach supports the \nfollowing reform areas:(i) improving public employment facilitation services, (ii) enhancing skills \ndevelopment and training systems, and (iii) strengthening labor market policies. At the inception \nof  the  programmatic  approach,  the  government  agreed  to  accomplish  seven  prior  actions \nrepresenting high-impact reforms and eight policy milestones as the basis for subprogram 2. All \nseven prior actions have been fully accomplished, with two exceeding expectations (the national \nroll-out of Job Start Philippines (JSP) program and the enactment of the Philippine Qualifications \nFramework). A new prior action was added to capture the efforts to establish an unemployment \ninsurance benefit. \n \n17.  Regarding policy milestones, during processing of subprogram 2: (i) two complementary \npolicy milestones were merged (the PESO Employment Information System was set up as an \nenhanced labor market information system that can also monitor implementation of job programs); \n(ii) a new policy milestone was added at the government\u2019s request to recognize efforts to enact \nlegislation on occupational safety and health standards; and (iii) certain policy milestones were \nrefined at the government\u2019s request to streamline the policy matrix. One policy milestone on the \nrationalization of job programs was partially accomplished, as more time is needed to perform \nanalytics  on  which  to  base  the  rationalization.  The  government  requested  that  this  policy \nmilestone be moved to subprogram 3. Subprogram 2 now comprises eight prior actions and seven \npolicy milestones, all of which have been accomplished.13 \n \n18.  Government employment facilitation services. This reform area supports the effective \ndelivery  of  employment  services,  particularly  to  young  job  seekers,  including  women  and \nmembers of marginalized groups, such as poor men and women and persons with disabilities. \nUnder the Public Employment Service Office Act of 1999 and its 2015 amendments, all provinces, \ncities, and municipalities should establish PESOs that will be operated and maintained by LGUs. \nPESOs are linked to the regional offices of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for \ncoordination, technical supervision, and capacity development. Subprogram 2 accomplishments \ninclude  increasing  the  number  of  operational  PESOs  to  1,253,  of  which  496  are  fully \ninstitutionalized.14 This represents an increase from 390 fully institutionalized PESOs in 2015, \nwhich has improved the quality and coverage of employment services across the country. The \nnational budget allocated funds to support adequate supervision and training of PESOs by the \nDOLE, totaling \u20b184.5 million in 2017 and 2018. This funding is supplemented by LGU budget \nallocations to PESOs through the internal revenue allocation. In addition, the DOLE and the \nTechnical  Education  and  Skills  Development  Authority  (TESDA)  developed  competency \nstandards for PESO managers as a basis for developing national qualifications to enhance the \nprofessionalization of PESOs. The government implemented the PESO Employment Information \nSystem to provide up-to-date labor market information and monitor major job facilitation programs. \n \n19.  To enhance youth employability, the government pilot-tested the JSP program in 2014\u2013\n2015 and enacted the JobStart Philippines Act in 2016 to institutionalize the program. Under \nsubprogram 2, JSP has been expanded to 35 LGUs. JSP provides full-cycle job facilitation \nservices, including training on life and technical skills, career coaching, and paid internships. JSP \nhas benefited 17,537 out-of-school youths since its inception, of whom 57% are female and more \nthan 70% are from low-income households. More than 200 employers have partnered with JSP \nto provide technical training, internships, and jobs to the youth beneficiaries. The government \n                                                \n13  Summary Assessment of Policy Actions under Subprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n14  A PESO is operationalized when it performs at least one core function of employment services. A PESO is considered \ninstitutionalized when it complies with the requirements of the Public Employment Service Office Act of 1999, \nincluding permanent positions, budgetary allocations, office space, and a full set of employment services. \n ", "6 \nintroduced reforms to the Special Program for the Employment of Students (SPES), targeting to \nincrease the number of beneficiaries to 393,500, of whom 59% are female. The SPES is an \nemployment-bridging program that provides subsidized short-term job opportunities during school \nbreaks to poor but deserving students and out-of-school youths to augment their family\u2019s income \nand help beneficiaries complete their education. Enrollment in the SPES has led to a 70% \nincrease in job opportunities after program completion mainly because students continue working \nwith their assigned employers.15 \n \n20.  For subprogram 3, the government will increase the number of operational PESOs, \nimprove their operation by preparing competency standards for all PESO staff, expand services \nto cover Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), and implement a job displacement monitoring \nsystem to meet the labor market information needs of vulnerable workers. \n \n21.  Skills  development  and  training  systems.  To  enhance  education\u2013employment \nlinkages, the government has institutionalized the Philippine Qualifications Framework, which \ndescribes the training standards and qualifications that align with industry requirements. The \nframework informs employers on workers\u2019 capabilities to reduce job mismatch and increase \nproductivity. The government has also provided substantial funding (\u20b110.8 billion in 2018) for \nTESDA\u2019s skills training and scholarship programs, such as the Training for Work Scholarship \nProgram, the Special Training for Employment Program, the Private Education Student Financial \nAssistance  Program,  and  various  schemes  under the  Universal  Access  to Quality Tertiary \nEducation  Act,  2017.  TESDA  strengthened  enterprise-based  training  by:  (i)  issuing  new \nimplementing rules and regulations to reform the dual training system to include a training \nallowance of at least 75% of the minimum wage, adjustable training hours, a standard training \nplan, and issuance of certificates of dual training;16 and (ii) developing guidelines to implement a \nreformed apprenticeship program to streamline TESDA approval requirements for apprenticeship \ntraining plans and include a mandatory competency assessment, certification requirements, and \ninsurance to trainees. \n \n22.  The Department of Tourism (DOT) pilot-tested a skills development grant scheme from \n2013 to 2015 to create job opportunities in tourism. As a result of the pilot under subprogram 2, \nthe government has allocated \u20b1100 million per year in 2017 and 2018 to roll out and implement \nthe scheme nationwide, targeting at least 45% female beneficiaries. More than 27,000 employees \nand job seekers were trained (48% women) in the tourism sector in 2017 and 2018. \n \n23.  For subprogram 3, the government will partner with employers in priority economic sectors \nto enhance workers\u2019 skills and improve their long-term employment prospects by implementing \nthe  Enterprise-Led  Learning  Networks  initiative.  The TESDA Women\u2019s  Center  will  develop \ntargeted programs to foster women\u2019s participation in the labor market. \n \n24.  Labor market policies. Reforms in this area focus on strengthening the regulatory \nframework to provide income security and decent jobs. Subprogram 2 accomplishments include \nthe  introduction  of  unemployment  insurance  or  involuntary  separation  benefits  through \namendments to the Social Security Act, 2018. This provides an income floor for workers in case \nthey lose their job and allows them time to find a new job while unemployed. The Occupational \nSafety and Health Standards Act, 2017 was also enacted to require employers to comply with \ngender-responsive occupational safety and health standards. This includes informing workers on \n                                                \n15  E. Beam and S. Quimbo. 2019.

The  government  also  continued \nimplementing the Single Entry Approach (SENA) program, which has seen an increasing number \nof filed requests for assistance, benefiting women, workers from marginalized sectors, and \nOFWs.17 SENA provides a fast, impartial, inexpensive, and accessible conciliation\u2013mediation and \nsettlement procedure of labor conflicts before they develop into actual labor cases. It is accessible \nthrough single assistance desks in all regions, including Philippine overseas labor offices. These \ndesks received 188,115 requests in 2017 and 2018, of which 60.4% were resolved and settled. \n \n25.  For  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  operationalize  the  unemployment  insurance \nbenefit, strengthen measures to support displaced workers, and improve services to facilitate \nreintegration of OFWs in the domestic economy. \n \n26.  ADB  experience.  ADB  has  supported  the  employment  and  skills  development \ninterventions of the Government of the Philippines through a mix of modalities, including TA, \nproject financing, and PBLs (Figure 2). Through the Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive \nGrowth Program and associated TA projects funded by the Government of Canada, ADB helped \nthe DOLE pilot-test JSP and roll it out nationwide.18 ADB helped the DOT pilot-test a tourism \nindustry skills development program, which the government has rolled out nationwide. In addition, \nADB provided results-based lending for the Senior High School Support Program to increase \nschool participation and supported the Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program, a conditional cash \ntransfer program where poor households receive grants if children attend school, maintain more \nthan 85% attendance, and get regular health checkups.19 This integrated package of ADB \nassistance  strengthens  the  supply  side  of  the  Philippine  labor  market.  ADB  support  for \ninfrastructure development and economic and financial reforms helps strengthen the demand side \nof the labor market by boosting economic activities and generating productive job opportunities. \n \n \n  Figure 2: ADB\u2019s Past Interventions \n  2010\u20132015  2014\u20132019: Senior \n  Social Protection  High School \n  Support Project (2010)  Support Program\nand additional financing \n  2011\u20132014 (2015) \n \nIncreasing \n  Competitiveness \n2015\u20132019  2015\u20132021 \n  for Inclusive \nTA on  Facilitating Youth \n  2011 Growth Program 2013 National  School-to-Work \n  TA for Strengthening  TA for Employment  Rollout   Transition \n  Institutions for an  Facilitation for Inclusive  of JobStart  Program \nImproved Investment \n  Growth, TA for Increasing  Philippines \nClimate   Competitiveness in Tourism \n   \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n17  The SENA mechanism is very emphatic on the kasambahay (domestic worker) as workers can file a request for \nassistance when aggrieved in the workplace. Notably, kasambahays are predominantly women. Most OFWs are also \nwomen, with the largest proportion aged 25\u201329 years old. \n18  ADB. 2014.

First, new strategies require proof of concept through pilot-testing that \ndemonstrates the feasibility of the strategy and its potential to build stakeholder engagement for \nreforms.20 Second, proactive methods are needed to engage with employers, including providing \nincentives for on-the-job training programs to attract employees with appropriate qualifications \nand experience. Third, addressing the youth unemployment challenge requires a concerted, long-\nterm effort involving government agencies, employers, educational institutions and communities. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. ADB\u2019s structured policy \ndialogue with the government under the PBL helped jointly identify and address legal, policy, and \nregulatory issues to successfully implement job facilitation and skills development programs. The \nrange of improvements and their timing demonstrate a commitment to adjusting approaches to \naddress youth employment in response to changing circumstances. In addition, ADB supported \nthe DOLE in the design, pilot-testing, and rollout of JSP and helped increase the capacity of \nPESOs to provide holistic and integrated job facilitation services. ADB supported the DOT in \nidentifying skills shortages that affect business competitiveness, developing a human resource \ndevelopment plan, and designing and pilot-testing a skills grants scheme. ADB also supported \nDOLE in formulating options for providing social protection for the unemployed. \n \n29.  Strategic alignment. The program supports the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 (Table 1). The program is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the \nPhilippines, 2018\u20132023, particularly on human development and social protection.21 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priority  Facilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition Program, Subprogram 2 \nAddressing remaining  Increasing employability of at-risk youth and facilitating access to wage \npoverty and reducing  jobs; improving education and training opportunities for the youth \ninequalities \nStrengthening  Supporting public management reform by improving labor market policies \ngovernance and  and programs; strengthening the institutional capacity of employment \ninstitutional capacity  services and the professionalization of public employment service office \nstaff \nAccelerating progress in  Increasing women\u2019s participation in the labor market; ensuring equal \ngender equality  access to training opportunities for young women and enhancing \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n30.  Development  partner  coordination.  ADB  forged  a  strong  partnership  with  the \nGovernment of Canada, which has funded two large TA projects.22 ADB jointly developed an \nanalytical study on youth employment and skills development with the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development (footnote 10). The International Labour Organization is helping \nwith policy development, and the United States Agency for International Development is assisting \nthe youth in accessing work-based training positions.23 \n \n                                                \n20  ADB. 2016.

The three reform areas of the program are expected to increase the number of employed \nyouths receiving higher earnings and holding more productive jobs. Economic gains are expected \nmainly through (i) reform of job facilitation services that increases the placement rates of out-of-\nschool youths into wage jobs, and (ii) efficiency gains from the development of public\u2013private \npartnerships in implementing labor market and skills programs. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n32.  The government has requested a regular loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 2.24 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. Based on the annuity repayment \nmethod, the average maturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. In \n2019, the government\u2019s total financing needs are $20.1 billion ($17.4 billion from the issuance of \nsecurities and $2.7 billion from official development assistance). The loan size reflects the \nPhilippines\u2019 financing needs and the development impact arising from the policy reform package. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n33.  The Department of Finance (DOF) is the executing agency for the program. DOLE, DOT \nand TESDA are the implementing agencies. The implementation period is November 2016\u2013March \n2019. The proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n34.  Safeguards. The program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies and is classified \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. \n \n35.  Poverty and social. Subprogram 2 is classified effective gender mainstreaming. There \nare higher inactivity rates among young women, with a NEET rate of 28.4% as compared with \n15.2% among young men. Programs such as JSP and  the SPES help increase women\u2019s \nparticipation in the labor market. Women comprise 57% of JSP beneficiaries and the majority \nbelong to low-income households; 59% of SPES beneficiaries are women. The tourism training \ngrant scheme upskilled tourism employees and job seekers, of whom 48% are women. \n \n36.  Governance. The government strengthened its public financial management. The 2016 \npublic expenditure and financial accountability assessment found that three of the seven core \npublic financial management areas have improved: policy-based budgeting, transparency, and \nasset\u2013liability management. Efforts to improve budget predictability and execution are ongoing. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and the DOF. \n \n37.  Risk and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 \n                                                \n24  The loan amount increased to $400 million from the indicative amount of $300 in the programmatic approach given \nthe substantial development financing needs.

ASSURANCES \n \n38.  The government and DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n(i) the loan of $400,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the Facilitating \nYouth School-to-Work Transition Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular \nterms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  \n3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and (ii) the inclusion of subprogram 3 in \nthe programmatic approach, as described in para. 4. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n12 November 2019 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nWage employment rate for the country\u2019s youth increased (Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022)a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the Reform  By 2022     \nSchool-to-work  a.
