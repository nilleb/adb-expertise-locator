The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Subprogram 2 is included in \nthe country operations business plan for the Philippines, 2019\u20132021 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nloan \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProgrammatic  approach  and  budget  support.  The  use  of  a  programmatic  approach \nwith  a  PBL  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  aligns  ADB  support  with  the  government\u2019s  reform \nagenda. Lending provides leverage to catalyze support for difficult reforms, while TA ensures that \ntechnical issues are addressed effectively. In May 2017, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved the \nfor  subprogram  1.2  Through  \nprogrammatic  approach  and  a  $300  million \n14 policy actions, subprogram 1 implemented reforms to restructure public employment services \nand  strengthen  labor  market  activation  and  skills  development  programs  for  the  youth.  This \nprovided a foundation for the reforms in subprogram 2. Through 15 policy actions, subprogram 2 \nrolled  out  innovative  labor  market  programs  and  facilitated  access  to  training  opportunities  to \nacquire  the  skills,  knowledge,  and  competencies  to  enhance  the  youth\u2019s  ability  to  secure  and \nretain a job. \n \n4. \nThe program was designed to comprise two subprograms with the possibility of including \na third subprogram. This approach allows ADB to pace its support for the government\u2019s reform \nefforts. Demonstrating its long-term commitment to labor market reforms, on 18 February 2019 \nthe  government  requested  subprogram  3  (and  a  $300  million  loan  indicative)  to  continue  the \nreform  momentum.  Subprogram  3  will  be  implemented  from  April  2019  to  April  2021  and  will \ninclude  17  policy  actions  that  focus  on  expanding  job  facilitation  services  to  workers  from \nmarginalized sectors to reduce poverty and vulnerability, increasing the institutional capacity of \npublic employment service offices (PESOs), and promoting and facilitating workforce learning in \nkey job-generating sectors. \n \nBackground. The Philippines has been one of the fastest-growing economies among the \n5. \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations member countries since the global financial crisis in 2008. \nEconomic  growth  averaged  6.3%  per  year  during  2010\u20132018,  a  substantial  increase  from  the \n4.5%  average  annual  growth  rate  recorded  during  2000\u20132009  and  the  2.4%  average  annual \ngrowth posted during 1980\u20131999. In addition, the unemployment rate substantially declined from \na  peak  of  11.8%  in  2014  to  5.3%  in  2018.  At  the  same  time,  poverty  incidence  declined  from \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2019\u20132021. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2017. Philippines: Facilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition Program (Subprogram 1). Manila. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26.6% in 2006 to 21.6% in 2016. To maintain this momentum, the Philippine Development Plan, \n2017\u20132022 continues the government\u2019s strong emphasis on inclusive growth.3 \n \n6. \nDevelopment  problem.  While  the  Philippines  shows  the  usual  inverse  correlation \nbetween  economic  growth  and  poverty  incidence,  this  is  weaker  than  in  other  economies  in \nSoutheast Asia. For example, household income inequality (as reflected by the Gini coefficient) \nis higher in the Philippines than in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nand Viet Nam. Weak labor market performance in the Philippines is largely responsible for the \nlimited decline in the poverty rate despite strong economic growth. Nonwage workers account for \n40% of all employed, and households relying on nonwage incomes are significantly more likely to \nbe  poor  than  households  headed  by  individuals  with  formal  wage  employment.  Labor  market \nperformance  also  varies  between  demographic  groups,  with  the  unemployment  rate  of  the \nyouth\u2014people  between  15\u201324-years  old  who  are  mostly  entering  the  job  market  for  the  first \ntime\u2014a dominant problem in the labor market. The government has undertaken education and \nlabor market reforms that have led the youth unemployment rate to decline from 15.3% in 2014 \nto 13.4% in 2018. \n \n7. \nHowever, the youth unemployment is still twice that of the national rate. An indicator of the \ndynamism of the labor market is the time it takes for young people to transition from school to a \nwage  job.  In  the  Philippines,  it  takes  up  to  four  years  for  a  high  school  graduate  and  \nup to two years for a college graduate to find a permanent wage job. Young women and youths \nfrom low-income households have the most difficult time integrating into the labor market.4 The \nslow  transition  reflects  a  widening  skills mismatch. The  consequence  of slower  school-to-work \ntransition  for  young  people  is  rapid  depreciation  of  their  skills  and  difficulty  in  integrating \nproductively into the labor market. \n \n8. \nBecause it takes the youth so long to find employment, there are high levels of youth not \nin  employment,  education,  or  training  (NEET).  The  NEET  rate  includes  the  unemployed, \ndiscouraged job seekers, or those unable to work because of family responsibilities or disability.5 \nIn Southeast Asia and the Pacific, about 18% of young people are NEET. In 2008 the NEET rate \nin the Philippines was 24.4% and by 2017 it had declined to 21.7%.6 The NEET rate is twice as \nhigh in low-income households than in well-off households and is higher among young women \n(28.4%)  than  young  men  (15.2%)  (Figure  1).  This  implies that  one  in  four  people  aged  15\u201324 \nyears  old,  or  about  4.4  million  young  Filipinos,  are  underused  and  their  skills  are  not  being \nenhanced by education, training, or employment. The higher female NEET rate is the result of \nyoung women\u2019s economic inactivity, as they are the household caretakers who are not looking for \nwork  or  who  remain  out  of  the  workforce.  Young  women  without  college  degrees  have  higher \nNEET rates as well. College education motivates women to enter the labor market earlier and \nstay longer.7 In 2017 young women in the Philippines were almost twice as likely as young men \nto be  out  of  school,  not be gainfully  employed,  or  not  have finished  college  or  post-secondary \n\n                                                \n3  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

The central policy challenge for the Philippines is to accelerate inclusive \ngrowth by improving the youth\u2019s employability and increasing decent work opportunities to reduce \npoverty. To meet these goals, it is vital to establish appropriate job facilitation and skills strategies. \n \n10. \nBinding  constraints.  The  government  recognizes  the  challenges  to  increasing  the \nincome-earning ability of young Filipinos, including the need to: (i) improve job facilitation services; \n(ii) enhance skills development and training systems; and (iii) strengthen labor policies. \n \n11. \nLow  coverage  and  quality  of  public  employment  services.  Individuals  from  poor \nhouseholds find jobs through informal contacts, which tend to channel a high concentration of the \npoor into informal, low-paying jobs. Job seekers, especially those from poor households, need \nbigger, more formal networks to go beyond the limited opportunities offered by the informal sector \nin their local communities. Therefore, it is important for cities and municipalities to provide quality \nemployment  services.  Improving  the  effectiveness  of  public  employment  services  in  a \ndecentralized  institutional  setup  will  require  three  reforms.  First,  the  government  needs  to \ninstitutionalize the provision of job facilitation services, such as job search assistance and career \nguidance, in key municipalities and cities through local government unit (LGU) PESOs. PESOs \nprovide  access  to  job  facilitation  services  such  as  referrals,  training,  reintegration,  and \nentrepreneurial  services.  These  services  ease  the  burden  for  women  and  members  of \nmarginalized groups (the poor and persons with disabilities) in searching for jobs. Second, budget \nallocations are needed to support PESOs in their core operations, including implementing critical \nlabor  market  and  livelihood  programs.  Third,  PESO  managers  and  personnel  should  meet \nminimum qualification standards to ensure technical proficiency. \n \n12. \nFurthermore, reliable labor market information is not available locally. PESOs have limited \nability to collect labor market information and inform job seekers and students about future labor \nmarket conditions by occupation, in-demand jobs, and skills shortages. The Philippines has been \ndeveloping  its  national  labor  market  information  system  through  its  National  Skills  Registry \nSystem  and  a  vacancy  database  known  as  PhilJobNet.9  However,  the  various  labor  market \nsystems have not been integrated to form a comprehensive database to monitor the different job \n                                                \n8  Government of the Philippines, Philippine Statistics Authority. 2018.

Weak skills development and training systems. Skills mismatch is still an issue. Given \nrapid  technological changes, jobs  increasingly  demand more  complex  and  sophisticated  skills. \nSocio-behavioral skills, such as managerial, leadership, interpersonal, and communication skills, \nare equally important. Two primary constraints have widened the skills mismatch between young \njob seekers and the skills demanded by enterprises. First, the government has not institutionalized \na  reference  system  of  national  standards of  qualifications  earned  by  individuals  educated  and \ntrained in the Philippines. This type of system is necessary to support worker mobility, encourage \nlifelong  learning,  and  build  employment\u2013industry  linkages.  Second,  closer  collaboration  with \nemployers is required to better tailor interventions to market needs, including investing in sector-\nspecific training and incentivizing employers to recruit young people by fostering enterprise-based \ntraining  programs  such as internships  and  apprenticeships.10  Moreover, workers  are  unable  to \nupgrade their skills regularly. Most young workers, mainly low-skilled, do not have access to work-\nbased  learning  opportunities  and  are  stuck  in  low-paying  and  temporary  jobs  that  lack  decent \nprospects for career growth. For example, while the Philippine Employment Projections Model, \n2013\u20132022 identified 10 key job-generating sectors, adequate support has not been provided to \nfacilitate training and upskilling for these sectors.11 \n \n14.  Weak labor policies. Creating decent work and ensuring income security are essential \npreconditions  to  inclusive  growth.  There  are  three  primary  constraints.  First,  workers  are  not \nguaranteed basic income security in case of involuntary unemployment and lack income support \nduring  job-to-job  transitions,  thus  increasing  their  susceptibility  to  income  poverty.  Second, \nemployers\u2019 noncompliance with occupational safety and health standards, including the provision \nof  gender-sensitive  workers\u2019  welfare  facilities,  is  contributing  to  the  rising  number  of  cases  of \ndisease and injury in the workplace. Third, the labor dispute mechanism needs to be implemented \nmore effectively to reduce the cost of disputes, which will particularly benefit women and workers \nfrom marginalized groups. \n \nB. \n \nThe government\u2019s reform agenda. The Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022 lays \n15. \nthe  foundation  for  inclusive  growth.  It  emphasizes  accelerated  human  capital  development  as \ncritical for making growth inclusive and reducing poverty and income inequality. Its three-pronged \nstrategy is to (i) increase income-earning ability, (ii) ensure lifelong learning opportunities for all, \nand (iii) improve nutrition and health for all (footnote 3). In addition, a new government blueprint \nfor  decent job  creation  prioritizes entrepreneurship,  youth  unemployment reduction,  education, \nand training. It aims to create 7.5 million jobs mainly in key job-generating sectors such as tourism, \ninformation technology and business process management, construction, and manufacturing.12 \n \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n                                                \n10 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and ADB. 2017.

Manila.. \n\n\fProgrammatic approach and subprogram 2. The programmatic approach supports the \n16. \nfollowing reform areas:(i) improving public employment facilitation services, (ii) enhancing skills \ndevelopment and training systems, and (iii) strengthening labor market policies. At the inception \nof  the  programmatic  approach,  the  government  agreed  to  accomplish  seven  prior  actions \nrepresenting high-impact reforms and eight policy milestones as the basis for subprogram 2. All \nseven prior actions have been fully accomplished, with two exceeding expectations (the national \nroll-out of Job Start Philippines (JSP) program and the enactment of the Philippine Qualifications \nFramework). A new prior action was added to capture the efforts to establish an unemployment \ninsurance benefit. \n \n17. \nRegarding policy milestones, during processing of subprogram 2: (i) two complementary \npolicy  milestones were merged  (the  PESO  Employment  Information  System  was  set  up  as  an \nenhanced labor market information system that can also monitor implementation of job programs); \n(ii) a new policy milestone was added at the government\u2019s request to recognize efforts to enact \nlegislation on occupational safety and health standards; and (iii) certain policy milestones were \nrefined at the government\u2019s request to streamline the policy matrix. One policy milestone on the \nrationalization of job programs was partially accomplished, as more time is needed to perform \nanalytics  on  which  to  base  the  rationalization.  The  government  requested  that  this  policy \nmilestone be moved to subprogram 3. Subprogram 2 now comprises eight prior actions and seven \npolicy milestones, all of which have been accomplished.13 \n \n18. \nGovernment employment facilitation services. This reform area supports the effective \ndelivery  of  employment  services,  particularly  to  young  job  seekers,  including  women  and \nmembers of marginalized groups, such as poor men and women and persons with disabilities. \nUnder the Public Employment Service Office Act of 1999 and its 2015 amendments, all provinces, \ncities, and municipalities should establish PESOs that will be operated and maintained by LGUs. \nPESOs are linked to the regional offices of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for \ncoordination, technical supervision, and capacity development. Subprogram 2 accomplishments \ninclude  increasing  the  number  of  operational  PESOs  to  1,253,  of  which  496  are  fully \ninstitutionalized.14  This  represents  an  increase  from  390  fully  institutionalized  PESOs  in  2015, \nwhich has improved the quality and coverage of employment services across the country. The \nnational budget allocated funds to support adequate supervision and training of PESOs by the \nDOLE,  totaling  \u20b184.5  million  in  2017  and  2018.  This  funding  is  supplemented  by  LGU  budget \nallocations  to  PESOs  through  the  internal  revenue  allocation.  In  addition,  the  DOLE  and  the \nTechnical  Education  and  Skills  Development  Authority  (TESDA)  developed  competency \nstandards for PESO managers as a basis for developing national qualifications to enhance the \nprofessionalization of PESOs. The government implemented the PESO Employment Information \nSystem to provide up-to-date labor market information and monitor major job facilitation programs. \n \n19. \nTo enhance youth employability, the government pilot-tested the JSP program in 2014\u2013\n2015  and  enacted  the  JobStart  Philippines  Act  in  2016  to  institutionalize  the  program.  Under \nsubprogram  2,  JSP  has  been  expanded  to  35  LGUs.  JSP  provides  full-cycle  job  facilitation \nservices, including training on life and technical skills, career coaching, and paid internships. JSP \nhas benefited 17,537 out-of-school youths since its inception, of whom 57% are female and more \nthan 70% are from low-income households. More than 200 employers have partnered with JSP \nto  provide  technical  training,  internships,  and  jobs  to  the  youth  beneficiaries.  The  government \n                                                \n13  Summary  Assessment  of  Policy  Actions  under  Subprogram  2  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n14  A PESO is operationalized when it performs at least one core function of employment services. A PESO is considered \ninstitutionalized  when  it  complies  with  the  requirements  of  the  Public  Employment  Service  Office  Act  of  1999, \nincluding permanent positions, budgetary allocations, office space, and a full set of employment services. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fintroduced reforms to the Special Program for the Employment of Students (SPES), targeting to \nincrease  the  number  of  beneficiaries  to  393,500,  of  whom  59%  are  female.  The  SPES  is  an \nemployment-bridging program that provides subsidized short-term job opportunities during school \nbreaks to poor but deserving students and out-of-school youths to augment their family\u2019s income \nand  help  beneficiaries  complete  their  education.  Enrollment  in  the  SPES  has  led  to  a  70% \nincrease in job opportunities after program completion mainly because students continue working \nwith their assigned employers.15 \n \nFor  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  increase  the  number  of  operational  PESOs, \n20. \nimprove their operation by preparing competency standards for all PESO staff, expand services \nto  cover  Overseas  Filipino  Workers  (OFWs),  and  implement  a  job  displacement  monitoring \nsystem to meet the labor market information needs of vulnerable workers. \n \n21. \nSkills  development  and  training  systems.  To  enhance  education\u2013employment \nlinkages,  the  government  has  institutionalized  the  Philippine  Qualifications  Framework,  which \ndescribes  the  training  standards  and  qualifications  that  align  with  industry  requirements.  The \nframework  informs  employers  on  workers\u2019  capabilities  to  reduce  job  mismatch  and  increase \nproductivity.  The  government  has  also  provided  substantial  funding  (\u20b110.8  billion  in  2018)  for \nTESDA\u2019s  skills  training  and  scholarship  programs,  such  as  the  Training  for  Work  Scholarship \nProgram, the Special Training for Employment Program, the Private Education Student Financial \nAssistance  Program,  and  various  schemes  under  the  Universal  Access  to  Quality  Tertiary \nEducation  Act,  2017.  TESDA  strengthened  enterprise-based  training  by:  (i)  issuing  new \nimplementing  rules  and  regulations  to  reform  the  dual  training  system  to  include  a  training \nallowance of at least 75% of the minimum wage, adjustable training hours, a standard training \nplan, and issuance of certificates of dual training;16 and (ii) developing guidelines to implement a \nreformed apprenticeship program to streamline TESDA approval requirements for apprenticeship \ntraining plans and include a mandatory competency assessment, certification requirements, and \ninsurance to trainees. \n \n22. \nThe Department of Tourism (DOT) pilot-tested a skills development grant scheme from \n2013 to 2015 to create job opportunities in tourism. As a result of the pilot under subprogram 2, \nthe government has allocated \u20b1100 million per year in 2017 and 2018 to roll out and implement \nthe scheme nationwide, targeting at least 45% female beneficiaries. More than 27,000 employees \nand job seekers were trained (48% women) in the tourism sector in 2017 and 2018. \n \n23. \nFor subprogram 3, the government will partner with employers in priority economic sectors \nto enhance workers\u2019 skills and improve their long-term employment prospects by implementing \nthe  Enterprise-Led  Learning  Networks  initiative.  The  TESDA  Women\u2019s  Center  will  develop \ntargeted programs to foster women\u2019s participation in the labor market. \n \nLabor  market  policies.  Reforms  in  this  area  focus  on  strengthening  the  regulatory \n24. \nframework to provide income security and decent jobs. Subprogram 2 accomplishments include \nthe  introduction  of  unemployment  insurance  or  involuntary  separation  benefits  through \namendments to the Social Security Act, 2018. This provides an income floor for workers in case \nthey lose their job and allows them time to find a new job while unemployed. The Occupational \nSafety and Health Standards Act, 2017 was also enacted to require employers to comply with \ngender-responsive occupational safety and health standards. This includes informing workers on \n\n                                                \n15  E. Beam and S. Quimbo. 2019.

The  government  also  continued \nimplementing the Single Entry Approach (SENA) program, which has seen an increasing number \nof  filed  requests  for  assistance,  benefiting  women,  workers  from  marginalized  sectors,  and \nOFWs.17 SENA provides a fast, impartial, inexpensive, and accessible conciliation\u2013mediation and \nsettlement procedure of labor conflicts before they develop into actual labor cases. It is accessible \nthrough single assistance desks in all regions, including Philippine overseas labor offices. These \ndesks received 188,115 requests in 2017 and 2018, of which 60.4% were resolved and settled. \n \n25. \nFor  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  operationalize  the  unemployment  insurance \nbenefit,  strengthen  measures  to  support  displaced  workers,  and  improve  services  to  facilitate \nreintegration of OFWs in the domestic economy. \n \n26. \nADB  experience.  ADB  has  supported  the  employment  and  skills  development \ninterventions  of  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  through  a  mix  of  modalities,  including  TA, \nproject  financing,  and  PBLs  (Figure  2).  Through  the  Increasing  Competitiveness  for  Inclusive \nGrowth Program and associated TA projects funded by the Government of Canada, ADB helped \nthe  DOLE  pilot-test  JSP  and  roll  it  out  nationwide.18  ADB  helped  the  DOT  pilot-test  a  tourism \nindustry skills development program, which the government has rolled out nationwide. In addition, \nADB  provided  results-based  lending  for  the  Senior  High  School  Support  Program  to  increase \nschool  participation  and supported  the  Pantawid Pamilya  Pilipino  Program,  a  conditional  cash \ntransfer program where poor households receive grants if children attend school, maintain more \nthan  85%  attendance,  and  get  regular  health  checkups.19  This  integrated  package  of  ADB \nassistance  strengthens  the  supply  side  of  the  Philippine  labor  market.  ADB  support  for \ninfrastructure development and economic and financial reforms helps strengthen the demand side \nof the labor market by boosting economic activities and generating productive job opportunities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nFigure 2: ADB\u2019s Past Interventions \n2014\u20132019: Senior \nHigh School \nSupport Program\n\n2013\nTA for Employment \nFacilitation for Inclusive \nGrowth, TA for Increasing \nCompetitiveness in Tourism \n\n2010\u20132015 \nSocial Protection \nSupport Project (2010) \nand additional financing \n(2015) \n\n2011\nTA for Strengthening \nInstitutions for an \nImproved Investment \nClimate  \n\n2015\u20132021 \nFacilitating Youth \nSchool-to-Work \nTransition \nProgram \n\n2011\u20132014\nIncreasing \nCompetitiveness \nfor Inclusive \nGrowth Program\n\n2015\u20132019 \nTA on \nNational \nRollout  \nof JobStart \nPhilippines \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n17  The SENA mechanism is very emphatic on the  kasambahay (domestic worker)  as workers can file a request for \nassistance when aggrieved in the workplace.

ADB\u2019s engagement helped inform subprogram 2 by highlighting three \n27. \nkey  lessons  learned.  First,  new  strategies  require  proof  of  concept  through  pilot-testing  that \ndemonstrates the feasibility of the strategy and its potential to build stakeholder engagement for \nreforms.20 Second, proactive methods are needed to engage with employers, including providing \nincentives for  on-the-job  training  programs  to  attract  employees  with  appropriate  qualifications \nand experience. Third, addressing the youth unemployment challenge requires a concerted, long-\nterm effort involving government agencies, employers, educational institutions and communities. \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. ADB\u2019s structured policy \ndialogue with the government under the PBL helped jointly identify and address legal, policy, and \nregulatory issues to successfully implement job facilitation and skills development programs. The \nrange of improvements and their timing demonstrate a commitment to adjusting approaches to \naddress youth employment in response to changing circumstances. In addition, ADB supported \nthe  DOLE  in  the  design,  pilot-testing,  and  rollout  of  JSP  and  helped  increase  the  capacity  of \nPESOs  to  provide  holistic  and  integrated  job  facilitation  services.  ADB  supported  the  DOT  in \nidentifying skills shortages that affect business competitiveness, developing a human resource \ndevelopment plan, and designing and pilot-testing a skills grants scheme. ADB also supported \nDOLE in formulating options for providing social protection for the unemployed. \n \n29. \nStrategic alignment. The program supports the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030  (Table  1).  The  program  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the \nPhilippines, 2018\u20132023, particularly on human development and social protection.21 \n \n\nStrategy 2030 Priority \nAddressing remaining \npoverty and reducing \ninequalities \nStrengthening \ngovernance and \ninstitutional capacity \n\nAccelerating progress in \ngender equality \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nFacilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition Program, Subprogram 2 \nIncreasing employability of at-risk youth and facilitating access to wage \njobs; improving education and training opportunities for the youth \n\nSupporting public management reform by improving labor market policies \nand programs; strengthening the institutional capacity of employment \nservices and the professionalization of public employment service office \nstaff \nIncreasing women\u2019s participation in the labor market; ensuring equal \naccess to training opportunities for young women and enhancing \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment \n\n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  ADB  forged  a  strong  partnership  with  the \n30. \nGovernment  of  Canada,  which  has  funded  two  large  TA  projects.22  ADB  jointly  developed  an \nanalytical study on youth employment and skills development with the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development (footnote 10). The International Labour Organization is helping \nwith policy development, and the United States Agency for International Development is assisting \nthe youth in accessing work-based training positions.23 \n \n\n                                                \n20  ADB. 2016.

Economic gains are expected \nmainly through (i) reform of job facilitation services that increases the placement rates of out-of-\nschool  youths  into  wage  jobs,  and  (ii)  efficiency  gains  from  the  development  of  public\u2013private \npartnerships in implementing labor market and skills programs. \n \nD. \n \n32. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 2.24 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement.  Based  on  the  annuity  repayment \nmethod, the average maturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. In \n2019, the government\u2019s total financing needs are $20.1 billion ($17.4 billion from the issuance of \nsecurities  and  $2.7  billion  from  official  development  assistance).  The  loan  size  reflects  the \nPhilippines\u2019 financing needs and the development impact arising from the policy reform package. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) is the executing agency for the program. DOLE, DOT \nand TESDA are the implementing agencies. The implementation period is November 2016\u2013March \n2019. The proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nSafeguards.

Programs  such  as  JSP  and  the  SPES  help  increase  women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  the  labor  market.  Women  comprise  57%  of  JSP  beneficiaries  and  the  majority \nbelong to low-income households; 59% of SPES beneficiaries are women. The tourism training \ngrant scheme upskilled tourism employees and job seekers, of whom 48% are women. \n \n36. \nGovernance. The government strengthened its public financial management. The 2016 \npublic  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment  found  that  three  of  the  seven  core \npublic financial  management  areas  have improved:  policy-based  budgeting, transparency,  and \nasset\u2013liability management. Efforts to improve budget predictability and execution are ongoing. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and the DOF. \n \n37. \nTable 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 \n\nRisk and mitigating measures.
