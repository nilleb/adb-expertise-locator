It  will  improve  the  quality  of  academic\nsubjects  and  skills  including  English,  mathematics,  science,  and\ncomputer  literacy  needed  to  prepare  15  to  18-year-olds  for  work  in\nthe modern economy and help narrow the digital divide. The Project\nwill upgrade small rural schools to full-curriculum schools to increase\nopportunities \ntheir  educational\nbackground, acquire computer skills, and pass national examinations.\nIt  will  provide  stipends  to  enable  poor  students  to  study  in  full-\ncurriculum schools. The Project will strengthen the delivery system of\nsecondary  education  by  expanding  the  role  of  the  Ministry  of\nEducation and Higher Education (MEHE) to include education quality\nassurance  to  better  manage  and  supervise  secondary  education\nincluding support for school principals, school development societies\n(SDSs),  and  provincial,  district  zonal,  and  divisional  education\nofficers.  The  Project  will  support  institutional  strengthening  of  the\nNational Evaluation Testing Service (NETS) and the National Institute\nof  Education  (NIE).  Institutional  strengthening  will  lead  to  greater\nquality,  access,  and  improved  management  capacity  to  ensure  that\ngreater  numbers  of  academically  qualified  students  will  complete\nsecondary school.\n\nPrimary objective: Human development\nSecondary objective: Poverty reduction\n\nEnvironmental category C\n\nEnvironmental implications were reviewed, and no significant  adverse\nenvironmental impacts were identified.\n\nWhile Sri Lanka has achieved progress in basic human development,\nit has been unable to translate these achievements into broad-based,\nsustainable economic growth. Worse still, the rural poor have not had\nequal  access  to  opportunities  necessary  to  acquire  social  and\nphysical  capital.  A  key  reason  for  this  failure  to  achieve  more  rapid\neconomic growth with greater equity is the deficiency of the education\nsystem.  Strong  state  dominance  and  an \ninflexible  regulatory\nframework  that  limits  choice  have  characterized  the  system.  There\nhave  been  an  overreliance  on  national  tests  as  opposed  to  school-\nbased assessment (SBA) and a mismatch between ability to pay and\nsecondary  school  educational  services  offered.  There  is  little  choice\nin the quality of education, especially for the poor, access to stipends\nor  public-private  partnerships  is  limited  and,  finally,  supervision  and\nmanagement style from the national to the local level are inadequate.\nThese  conditions  have  created  a  secondary  school  system  that\ngraduates  students  unequipped  with  marketable  skills  and\nunprepared  to  participate  in  the  modern  economy.  The  result  are\nrelatively  high  unemployment  among  the  educated  while  emerging\nmodern  sector  employment  opportunities  are  unfilled  for  lack  of\n\nClassification\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\n\fiii\n\nqualified  candidates,  and  an  inefficient  and  inflexible  secondary\neducation  system  that  restricts  curriculum  choice  and  occupational\nopportunities.  Sri Lanka views modernization of secondary education\nas  one  of  the  main  pillars  of  its  drive  for  economic  and  social\ndevelopment  and  a  key \nregional  disparities.\nConsequently, there is no alternative but to improve school quality by\nraising  standards,  increase  access  especially  for  the  poor  through\ngreater  choice  of  quality  offerings  and  raise  administrative  efficiency\nthrough school leadership and decentralization.\n\nreducing \n\nto \n\nthrough \n\nrates  especially \n\nimproved  access \n\nThe  overall  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  assist  the  Government  to\nmodernize  the  secondary  school  system  to  prepare  the  young  to\ncompete in the modern global economy.  Specifically, the Project will\nimprove  the  quality  of  secondary  school  education  to  raise  the  pass\nrate  in  the  national  examination.  Quality  improvement  will  lead  to\nhigher  pass \nfor\ndisadvantaged  students  by  introducing  stipends  and  upgrading\nselected schools to full-curriculum secondary schools in underserved\nareas. The Project will improve school supervision and management\nso  that  teachers  and  principals  will  have  greater  control  over\nclassroom learning, as it affects examination results.  The Project has\nthree  components:  Component  1  will  modernize  secondary  schools\nby introducing modern teaching, learning, and evaluation methods to\nimprove quality. The subcomponents include (i) school-based student\nlearning  activities  and  continuous  assessment  for  grades  10-13\nstudents, and (ii) expanded computer technology-directed learning to\nnarrow  the  digital  divide.  Component  2  will  broaden  educational\nopportunities for disadvantaged students by (i) expanding the number\nof  full-curriculum  schools  in  rural  areas,  (ii)  extending  stipend\nprograms to enable the poor to attend the high-quality full-curriculum\nschools, (iii) introducing career guidance programs to increase career\ninformation \nfor  expanded  opportunities  and  mobility,  and  (iv)\nconducting  research  studies  to  determine  cost-effective  ways  to\naccommodate  public-private  partnerships  in  secondary  education.\nComponent  3  will  improve  the  delivery  of  educational  services\nthrough  (i)  quality  assurance  within  MEHE  and  the  strengthening  of\nlocal  supervision  and  school-based  management  (SBM);  (ii)  SBA  in\nthe  national  examination\ngrades  10-13 \nadministration  at  NETS;  (iii) NIE  curriculum  in-service  training  in  the\nnew  technology  education  stream,  career  guidance,  and  computer\ntraining; and (iv) a project management office.\n\nincluding  modernizing \n\nThe  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $76.0  million  equivalent,  of  which  the\nforeign exchange cost is estimated at $38.8 million (51 percent of the\ntotal cost) and the local currency cost at $37.2 million equivalent (49\npercent of the total cost).\n\nObjectives and\nScope\n\nCost Estimates\n\n\fFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting\nServices\n\niv\n\n_______________________________________________($ million)__\nPercent\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n \n\nADB\nNDF\nGovernment\nBeneficiariesa\n\n   Total\n\n32.8\n6.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n38.8\n\n17.2\n1.0\n17.0\n2.0\n\n37.2\n\n50.0\n7.0\n17.0\n2.0\n\n76.0\n\n66\n9\n22\n3\n\n100\n\n_________________________________________________________\nADB = Asian Development Bank, NDF = Nordic Development Fund.\n\n     a  School development societies.\n\nA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR38,071,000  ($50\nmillion equivalent) from the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Special\nFunds  resources.

Up  to  one  million\nstudents  attending  grades  10-13  each  year  will  benefit  from  the\nprogram  over  the  five-year  project  period  and  the  subsequent  five-\nyear period after project completion. The Project will increase access\nto  100  upgraded  full-curriculum  schools  for  about  5,000  additional\ndisadvantaged  students  annually  over  10  years;  provide  stipends  to\n30,000  disadvantaged  students  to  attend  existing  full-curriculum\nschools  over  five  years;  and  provide  all  students  with  information\nabout education, training, and jobs. The Project will also improve the\ndelivery  of  secondary  education  by  strengthening  the  capacity  of\nMEHE  to  plan  and  coordinate  monitoring  and  supervision  of  quality\nimprovements  at  the  central  and  local  level  for  up  to  6,000\nadministrators.\n\nThe Project will assist NETS to improve the examination system. The\nchange is expected to increase the pass rates at 0 level enabling an\naverage  additional  50,000  students  (age  16)  per  year  over  12  years\nto quality for entry into grade 12, many of whom would otherwise fail\nto quality. About 32 NETS staff will be trained and given fellowships.\nThe  Project  will  also  help  NIE  to  improve  its  teacher  in-service\nprograms  to  strengthen  classroom  instruction  in  key  subjects.  In-\nservice  training  will  benefit  up  to  14,000  secondary  school  teachers:\n800  computer  teachers;  2,300  each  career  guidance,  English,\nmathematics, and commerce teachers; about 2,500 science teachers;\nand  1,500  principals,  supervisors,  and  administrative  and  technical\nstaff.  Together,  the  internal  efficiency  of  the  secondary  education\nsystem  will  increase  by  40  percent  based  on  the  increase  in  pass\nrates from 35 percent to 50 percent. The social rate of return for the\nProject is calculated at 16 percent.\n\nAbout  42  percent  of  the  project  beneficiaries  are  poor  students\nalthough  only  21  percent  of  national  households  are  judged  poor  by\ngovernment indicators. Of the 800 specially targeted project schools,\n60  percent  are  low-performing  schools  where  over  half  of  the\nenrollees  are  poor,  whereas  about  30  percent  of  students  attending\nthe  remaining  40  percent  of  well-performing  schools  are  poor.\nConsequently,  42  percent  of \nthe  project  beneficiaries  are\ndisadvantaged  students.  Of  the  approximately  500,000  additional\ngrade  11  students  qualifying  for  entry  to  grade  12  over  12  years,  at\nleast  20  percent  are  expected  to  graduate  from  the  poorest\nperforming  schools.  These  students  will  have  passed  the  national\nexamination  as  a  result  of  improved  teaching,  transfer  policies  to\ngood schools, and stipends and remedial programs provided to help\npoor students prepare for national examinations.\n\n\fvi\n\n\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Secondary  Education\nModernization Project.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nFollowing  the  release  of  the  Presidential  Task  Force  Report  on  General  Education  in\n1998, the Government of Sri Lanka took steps to modernize the secondary education system.\nModernizing secondary schools will help to increase access to quality education and make the\ncountry  more  competitive.  In  April  1999,  the  Government  requested  the  Asian  Development\nBank  (ADB)  to  support  secondary  education  modernization.  In  response  to  this  request,  ADB\nassisted the Government to undertake a feasibility study1 from October 1998 to January 1999,\nemploying  a  participatory  approach  with  central,  provincial,  district,  zonal,  and  divisional\neducation  officials,  principals,  teachers,  parents,  students,  and  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs).  The  consultative  process  involved  workshops  and  school  meetings  to  confirm  the\ndemand  for  computer  learning,  and  local  involvement  in  monitoring  and  supporting  the  use  of\ncomputer  learning  centers  (CLCs).  Meetings  were  held  among  ADB,  Japan  International\nCooperation  Agency  (JICA),  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  and  the\nGovernment  to  plan  strategies  for  future  widespread  use  of  school  computers.  A  Loan  Fact-\nFinding  Mission  was  conducted  in  April  2000  and  appraisal  in  June  2000.2  This  proposal  is\nbased  on  the  findings  of  the  feasibility  report,  ADB  Missions  and  subsequent  staff  work.\nAppendix 1 presents the project framework.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nSocioeconomic Context\n\n3.\nSri  Lanka\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  5.2  percent  per  annum  during  the\n1990s. In 1998, the per capita GDP averaged $823. Although the GDP growth rate has slowed\nin recent years, the Government has achieved macroeconomic stability with single-digit inflation\nand a fiscal deficit lower than that in the mid-1990s, despite the economic and political instability\nin the region. The Government achieved considerable progress in the structural reform agenda\nthat includes tax reform and the reduction of public sector dominance through increased public-\nprivate sector participation. Curtailing public sector employment already has contributed toward\nprivate sector growth and the reduction of educated unemployment from 29 percent in 1990 to\n19 percent in 1998. The continued emphasis on human resources is needed to prepare a skilled\nlabor force capable of taking advantage of new global trends in technology-based, value-added\njobs,  and  to  promote  labor-intensive  products  in  agriculture,  tourism,  and  manufacturing.\nWithout a strong skill and knowledge base, the Government believes it is unlikely that Sri Lanka\ncan compete in the regional and global economy.\n\n                                                \n1  TA 3241-SRI: Secondary Education Modernization Project, for $250,000, approved on 12 August 1999.\n2  The  Mission  comprised  W.  Loxley,  Education  Specialist/Mission  Leader;  S.  Nanwani,  Senior  Counsel;  K.M.\nTilakaratne, Implementation Officer/Resident Mission; and W.S. Perera, Staff Consultant/Examinations Specialist.\n\n\f2\n\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Index ranks\n4.\nSri  Lanka  84th  among  174  countries.  Sri  Lanka  has  achieved  success  in  building  a  strong\nfoundation in human development including high adult literacy, near-universal school enrollment\nthrough  grade  9  (age  14),  and  gender  parity  in  school  enrollments.  Although  Sri  Lanka  has\nstrong  social  indicators  compared  with  other  countries,  incidence  of  absolute  poverty  is  high\nwith  21  percent    of  the  total  18.8  million  population  still  living  in  poverty.3  However,  several\nproblems remain to be tackled before these achievements can be translated into high economic\ngrowth. The quality of social services is deteriorating due to financial constraints, given the high\ncost of the civil conflict. Substantial regional disparities have arisen where the rural poor have\nless  access  to  quality  basic  services,  especially  to  high-quality  schools.  More  classrooms,\nlibraries,  and  science  laboratories  are  needed  to  upgrade  the  smaller  rural  schools  to  full-\ncurriculum  schools  (e.g.,  grades  12-13  science  stream).  Full-curriculum  schools  needed\nupgrading and expansion so they can accommodate more students from disadvantaged areas.\nThe quality of secondary must be improved and equal access to good schools ensured for the\npoor and other disadvantaged groups. Good schools imply greater social and economic mobility\nfor  the  young  \u2013  especially  for  the  disadvantaged  who  can  score  high  on  the  national\nexamination as a result of improved academic performance in school.\n\n2.\n\nThe Secondary Education System\n\nThe  education  system  in  Sri  Lanka  comprises  nine  years  of  basic  education  and  four\n5.\nyears of secondary education comprising two years of ordinary (O level) study (grades 10-11)\nand two years of advanced (A level) study (grades 12-13). Out of about 4 million students in the\nschool  system  of  10,000  schools,  about  one  million  students  are  in  the  secondary  grades  in\nabout 2,300 schools. About 40,000 of the 180,000 teachers in the system teach in these upper\ngrades.4 Education is compulsory through age 14 to enforce universal basic education and the\nGovernment aims to extend compulsory education to age 16 (grade 11), but at present although\nabout 90 percent of students complete grade 11, only one third continue to grade 12 as most of\nthem  are  unable  to  pass  the  O  level  examination  taken  after  grade  11.  In  fact,  15  percent  of\ngrade  11  students  fail  all  subjects  on  the  O  level  examination.  This  unsatisfactory  academic\nperformance is a key indicator of the poor quality of teaching and learning in secondary schools.\nThe  failure  of  these  students  to  attain  minimum  achievement  levels  results  in  significant\nwastage  of  financial  resources.  Lack  of  educational  facilities,  teaching  materials,  and  learning\nresources  is  the  root  cause  of  the  low  quality  of  teaching  and  limited  coverage  of  secondary\neducation.\n\nCurrently, there are two types of secondary schools: the first consists of about 600 full-\n6.\ncurriculum  secondary  schools  that  offer  courses  in  science,  commerce,  and  the  arts  and  the\nsecond consists of about 1,700 limited-curriculum secondary schools offering courses in either\ncommerce  or  the  arts  or  both.  The  600  full-curriculum  schools  are  often  better  equipped  and\nstaffed  than  the  1,700  limited-curriculum  schools.  The  latter  are  disproportionately  located  in\nrural communities and lack science teachers and facilities for teaching science. Students in the\nlimited-curriculum schools are more likely to perform poorly on national examinations because\n\n                                                \n3  The  Government  has  been  formulating  a  new  framework  for  poverty  reduction  in  Sri  Lanka,  with  participation  of\nmajor stakeholders in the country including the aid agencies.  The framework provides a comprehensive analysis\nof  the  poverty  situation  in  Sri  Lanka  based  on  more  recent  data  and  proposes  a  new  Government  strategy  to\nreduce poverty.  It will be presented at the Development Forum for Sri Lanka in December 2000.\n\n4  There  are  about  75  private  schools  offering  the  national  curriculum  and  preparing  students  for  the  national\nexamination.  Most of these private schools are state-assisted receiving textbooks and teacher salaries. In addition,\nthere are about 30 international schools managed as fee levying private enterprises.  They are outside the national\nschool system and follow various curricula and examination schemes, and provide instruction in English language.\n\n\f3\n\nthe quality of schooling is worse than in the full-curriculum schools.  There is a need to improve\nthe  quality  of  all  schools  so  that  students  in  all  geographical  regions  have  equal  access  to\nquality  education.  One  approach  is  to  upgrade  limited-curriculum  schools  to  full-curriculum\nschools.  Another  approach  is  to  widen  access  to  full-curriculum  schools  by  providing  stipends\nand  targeted  bursaries  to  enable  disadvantaged  students  to  attend  the  better,  full-curriculum\nschools.  School  reforms  are  also  needed  to  ensure  that  students  have  access  to  expanded\ncurriculum programs and a wider choice of options by enabling them to transfer from one school\nto another.\n\n3.\n\nSchool Access and the Poor\n\n7.\nAbout one million students attend secondary school: 350,000 each in grades 10 and 11,\nand  about  150,000  each  in  grades  12  and  13.    Enrollments  are  now  declining  by  about  1\npercent  per  annum  in  the  primary  grades  and  this  will  eventually  lead  to  decline  in  secondary\nschool  enrollments  thereby  removing  budgetary  pressure  to  expand  education  resources.\nCurrently, dropping out occurs only between grades 11 and 12 as students fail the examination\nin great numbers, however, they can repeat grade 11 and sit for the examination a second time.\nThe  same  also  holds  for  the  national  examination  taken  after  grade  13.  Because  over  90\npercent of students aged 15 and 16 attend grades 10 and 11, most students from poor families\nare in school until they drop out after grade 11 when they fail the grade 11 national examination.\n\n8.\nOf  the  2,300  secondary  schools,  about  10  percent  are  large  schools  with  more  than\n1,000  students.  These  schools  are  in  large  cities  and  provincial  capitals.  Another  50  percent\nhave  enrollments  of  about  500.  The  remaining  40  percent  have  small  enrollments,  often  lack\nelectricity  and  teachers,  and  taken  together  do  not  enroll  more  than  20  percent  of  secondary\nschool  students.  For  this  reason,  focusing  on  about  35  percent  of  all  secondary  schools  can\ncover  almost  all  grades  12-13  students  and  up  to  one  third  of  grades  10-11  students.  These\nschools  comprise  both  good  and  bad  performing  schools  and  so  a  careful  rationalization  of\nschool juxtaposition is required to ensure that each community has access to a high-performing\nschool. The well-performing schools generally exclude economically poor students who perform\npoorly on academic tests due to a lack of resources at home. At least half of students in poor\nperforming  schools  are  economically  disadvantaged,  while  about  30  percent  of  students\nattending high-quality schools are economically poor.\n\n9.\nThe problem of access to quality schooling is complicated because students sometimes\nwill not attend schools dominated by those of another cultural background. Also, some schools\ndo  not  offer  a  full  set  of  academic  choices  especially  in  grades  12-13,  so  students  wishing  to\nstudy science, for example, often transfer to another school to study science or else switch to\narts  or  commerce  in  their  own  school.  The  Government  provides  a  stipend  program  for  bright\nstudents in grades 6 through 11, and the President\u2019s office recently initiated a pilot program to\nprovide stipends for students in secondary school who do well on their grade 9 examinations.\nWhat is further needed are stipends targeted to poor but promising students in grades 10 and\n11 to help them to attend better schools and to provide them with remedial assistance so they\ncan  pass  the  O  level  examination.  Other  stipends  can  be  targeted  to  successful  O  level\ncandidates,  who  would  otherwise  drop  out,  to  enable  them  to  attend  grades  12-13.  School\ndevelopment societies (SDSs) provide assistance to needy students in cooperation with school\nprincipals.  The  national  safety  net  Samurdhi  program  also  provides  direct  income  support  to\nnearly  50  percent  of  all  families.  Together  these  programs  help  to  meet  the  needs  of\ndisadvantaged students in schools but despite them, only about half of the students can afford\nthe  voluntary  fees  requested  by  SDS.  The  situation  indicates  the  extent  of  student  poverty  in\nschools.\n\n\f4\n\n4. \n\nThe Secondary School Curriculum and Learning\n\n10.\nSecondary  schools  follow  a  standard  curriculum  and  syllabus  in  each  grade.  However,\nsome  schools  offer  only  the  arts  or  commerce  syllabus,  or  both,  while  others  offer  in  addition\nscience  courses  in  grades  12-13.  The  schools  that  offer  science  require  science  laboratories\nand  must  be  staffed  with  qualified  science  teachers  in  physics,  mathematics,  biology,  and\nchemistry. Typically, students attend classes where the traditional chalk-and-talk method is the\nrule and have access to a school library. To alter classroom teaching and textbook learning, the\nGovernment,  under  the  new  education  reforms,  has  introduced  project  work  and  field  studies\nrequiring  students  to  access  greater  amounts  of  knowledge  and  information  outside  the\nclassroom.  For  example,  in  grades  12-13,  textbooks  are  not  provided  and  teachers  often  lack\nspecific  training.  The  Ministry  of  Education  and  Higher  Education  (MEHE)  plans  to  provide\nmultiple textbooks to be placed in school libraries for reference and include multimedia rooms\nwith  television,  video  cassette  recorder  (VCR)  and  audio  cassettes  to  provide  students  with\nlearning materials separate from the traditional textbook and lecture format. Language cassettes\nto improve pronunciation are another example of the multimedia approach to classroom learning\nin  Sri  Lanka.  The  National  Institute  of  Education  (NIE)  was  established  under  the  National\nEducation  Act  (No.  28  of  1985).  NIE,  which  is  responsible  for  curriculum  development  and  in-\nservice curriculum training, is introducing innovative programs to introduce applied science and\ntechnology  in  grades  12-13  that  allow  students  to  apply  physics  and  biology  in  everyday\nproblem solving.\n\n11.\nNIE  has  produced  a  syllabus  for  computer  literacy  that  emphasizes  both  information\ntechnology  (IT)  and  interactive  learning.  The  Government  would  like  to  include  a  computer\nlaboratory in every school, but at the moment will require the subject to be mandatory only for\ngrades  12-13.  Computer  laboratories  are  expected  to  increase  access  to  electronic  reference\nmaterials, and software materials to supplement science, mathematics, English, and commerce\nlessons, but eventually will allow access to the Internet, tutorials, and other interactive computer\nlearning  activities  that  are  expected  to  change  the  way  students  learn  lessons.  NIE  is\ndeveloping a system to download free academic software off the Internet and provide compact\ndisk-read only memory (CD-ROM) via private service providers to school computer laboratories.\nIn summary, the use of new educational technologies in grades 10-13 is becoming a reality. The\nGovernment  does  not  want  its  schools  left  behind  those  of  other  countries  and  it  regards  the\nbenefits  of  those  technologies  as  important  because  they  can  supplement  the  information,\nknowledge,  and  pedagogical  style  of  classroom  teachers  to  help  improve  student  learning.\nThese  new  technologies  also  offer  additional  avenues  for  study  so  that  teachers  can  easily\nassess individual and group progress.\n\n5.\n\nThe Examination System\n\n12.\nSecondary education follows the traditional British system of two years (grades 10-11) of\nschooling  followed  by  the  O  level  national  examination.  Successful  completion  of  this  national\nexamination allows the student to attend two additional years of secondary school (grades 12-\n13)  followed  by  the  A  level  national  examination.  Currently,  about  35  percent  of  students\nsuccessfully pass the O level examination (up from 24 percent in 1990) and about 45 percent\npass  the  A  level  examination  (this  rate  has  remained  steady  over  the  past  10  years  as  the\nexamination  serves  mainly  as  a  determinant  of  university  entrance  rather  than  a  test  of\nsecondary school completion).\n\n\f5\n\nEach  of  these  one-shot  examinations  evaluates  two  years  of  education  assessed  in\n13.\nseveral  hours  of  testing.  While  the  examination  system  remains  honest  and  highly  respected,\nmany view it as an anachronism that disallows continuous assessment throughout the year for\nassignments,  projects,  and  coursework  graded  by  the  teacher.  Furthermore,  parents  pay  for\nprivate tutoring after school to give an advantage to their children. Only about 50 percent of the\nstudents  can  afford  the  tutorial  costs  and  the  system  detracts  from  ensuring  that  in-school\nteaching  is  maximized.  In  the  past,  the  national  examination  was  thought  to  be  a  meritocratic\nway  to  select  students  for  public  sector  employment.  Today,  public  sector  employment  is\nminimal and those continuing on to the university represent only about 10 percent of successful\nA  level  candidates.  Consequently,  an  examination  system  that  counts  secondary  school\ncoursework,  especially  science  laboratory  work,  student  projects  in  English,  mathematics,\ncommerce, and computer work that can be used by employers to judge student qualifications for\nwork  and  on-job-training  is  preferable  to  the  existing  examination  system  that  labels  students\neither as winners or losers. The Government has mandated school-based assessment (SBA) in\ngrades  6-9  to  allow  teachers  to  evaluate  students  on  both  academic  and  attitudinal  attributes.\nStarting  in  2001,  the  system  will  be  introduced  in  grades  10-13  and  linked  to  the  national\nexamination system. While government officials and academicians view the current system as\nantiquated, the public continues to see the national examination as a highly important measure\nof  student  success.  For  this  reason,  the  public  is  reluctant  to  change  the  examination  system\nthat is seen by many as the only way to be judged competent.\n\n14.\nThe examination system is run by the Department of Examinations (DOE) that recently\nmoved  its  operations  from  18th  century  slave  quarters.  The  unit  responsible  for  national\nexaminations  is  the  National  Evaluation  and  Testing  Service  (NETS),  which  is  presently\nestablished within MEHE. NETS is responsible for conducting the O and A level examinations\neach  year.  The  O  level  examination  is  carried  out  in  December,  results  are  released  in  April,\nand the student resumes schooling in August (a nine-month interruption of studies). Grade 13\ncandidates  take  their  examinations  in  August,  learn  results  in  December,  and  resume  studies\nthe following December (a 15-month interruption in study). NETS staff view the carrying out of\nthe  examinations  as  their  most  important  function.  While  NETS  has  new  equipment  to  secure\ntest printing and distribution, and computers for consolidating scores by test readers, the system\nlacks funding, staffing, and management. Little research is conducted and no one is looking at\nways to improve efficiency in test administration.\n\n6.\n\nSecondary School Management and Supervision\n\nMEHE is responsible for managing the education system, especially for setting policies\n15.\nand  standards.  MEHE  was  recently  reorganized  to  strengthen  its  planning,  policy,  and\nmonitoring  capacity  because  routine  tasks  including  personnel,  budgeting,  etc.  have  been\ndelegated  to  the  local  administration.  Consequently,  the  reorganization  has  stressed  quality\nassurance.  Further,  MEHE  has  increased  its  control  over  teacher  education  institutes  and\nexercises  closer  control  over  curriculum  development  (NIE)  and  school-based  assessment\n(SBA, NETS). Both NETS and NIE are now more closely coordinated and supervised by MEHE,\nwith MEHE taking responsibility for curriculum and examination policies.\n\n16.\nThe  Government  recently  took  steps  to  restructure  MEHE  to  include  a  deputy  director\ngeneral  of  school  management  quality  assurance  responsible  for  line  supervision  and  for\nensuring  that  academic  standards  are  maintained.    The  supervision  component  was\nstrengthened  to  provide  a  greater  line  of  control  from  national,  provincial,  district,  zonal,  and\ndivisional  offices  to  schools.  Under  the  reorganization,  a  deputy  director  general  for  quality\nassurance was designated to oversee quality assurance, and this has taken the form of school-\n\n\f6\n\nbased  management  (SBM)  with  the  principal,  SDS  leader,  and  zonal  officer  pivotal  in  making\nthe system effective. Strong MEHE links with provincial and local schools are needed to ensure\ngood supervision and quality control. Zonal offices are staffed with education officers, but they\nrequire  training.  At  present,  the  top-down  management  structure  allows  for  little  more  than\npassing  down  orders  and  does  not  provide  for  two-way  communication.  The  World  Bank  is\nproviding equipment and training to provincial and zonal offices to improve management for all\n10,000 schools so that school principals and SDS leaders will develop new management styles.\n\n7.\n\nSecondary School Finance\n\n17.\nThe Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) provides funding to the education sector\nthrough  block  grants  directly  to  the  provinces  and  to  the  schools.  In  1998,  approximately  10\npercent of the national budget was allocated for education. Of that amount, less than half went\nto secondary education. Presently, free education from grade 1 through university is available,\nbut  this  will  become  untenable  as  more  students  successfully  complete  the  grade  11\nexamination  and  opt  for  more  education.  The  Government  provides  free  tuition,  textbooks,\nuniforms,  and  subsidized  transport.5  Because  the  poor  within  each  ethnic  and  linguistic  group\ntend  to  live  in  relatively  homogeneous  communities  isolated  from  one  another,  free  education\ncan  make  an  important  contribution  to  promoting  social  cohesion  through  a  commonly  shared\nschooling  experience.  This  is  a  major  reason  given  for  the  continued  strong  Government\nsupport  for  free  education  throughout  the  country  and  for  the  sensitivity  of  communities  to\nchanges in the financing of education.\n\n18.\nIn  1998,  the  Government  spent  2.6  percent  of  GDP  on  education,  which  is  well  below\nthe  3.5  percent  average  for  Asia.  Educational  expenditures  are  also  relatively  low  as  a\nproportion  of  the  overall  government  budget  \u2014  10  percent  in  1998  compared  with  the  14\npercent average for Asia. The trend has been gradually declining over the past 10 years. The\nongoing civil conflict is partly to blame for the low expenditures. External sources finance most\ncapital  investments  while  the  Government  provides  recurrent  costs.    Population  growth  has\nstabilized and so have enrollments. About 55 percent of the education budget covers grades 1-9\nand  45  percent  is  for  grades  10-13.  With  no  growth  in  enrollments  in  grades  1-9,  these\npercentages are likely to remain constant. The education budget has grown at about 10 percent\nper  annum  over  the  past  10  years  but,  after  accounting  for  inflation,  the  increase  is  minimal.\nWith limited funds, it is unlikely that education budgets will increase over the near term. For this\nreason, educators will have to do more with less \u2014 this will pose problems for improving quality\nin the future if funds become scarce.\n\n19.\nBecause  education  is  free,  students  do  not  pay  for  books,  uniforms,  or  subsidized\ntransport.  School  fees  account  for  5  percent  of  school  costs  and  families  often  pay  up  to  20\npercent of discretionary income on education for children because students require more than\nthe  one  uniform  provided  and  because  books  are  only  provided  through  grade  11  and  not\nalways  provided  on  time,  etc.  Parents  also  pay  for  after-school  tutoring  and  facility  fees  in\nsecondary schools, often as a requirement for acceptance into quality schools. Despite the free\neducation  policy,  poor  families'  access  to  quality  education  is  constrained  by  their  inability  to\nmeet the extra costs for books, uniforms, after-school tutoring, and facility fees.\n\n20. When  the  Government  nationalized  schools  in  1968,  it  did  so  to  abolish  the  wide\ndisparities  in  quality  and  attainment.  Over  the  past  40  years,  the  public  system  has  kept\n\n                                                \n5  TA 2441-SRI: A Study of Financing of Social Services, for $350,000, approved on 9 November 1995, documented\n\nin detail the direct and indirect school costs for families and government.\n\n\f7\n\ndifferences  to  a  minimum,  but  has  sacrificed  overall  quality  in  the  process.  In  addition,\nexpenditures have declined over time due in part to the added costs of the civil conflict, leading\nto a general deterioration of the fiscal situation. With declining real budgets and little chance for\nadditional  revenues,  the  education  system  will  have  to  do  more  with  less.  The  decline  in\nenrollment  will  help  to  offset  the  rise  in  costs,6  but  the  Government  will  eventually  have  to\nintroduce public-private participation as a way to reduce the number of public school applicants.\nThinking has to begin now if decisions are to be taken in several years time when the financial\ncrisis  in  education  becomes  critical.  For  example,  it  is  estimated  that  about  50  high-caliber\npublic  schools  in  urban  areas  are  willing  to  withdraw  from  the  public  education  system  if  they\ncould  elect  their  own  board  and  charge  fees.  They  would  retain  the  national  curriculum  and\nparticipate  in  national  examinations.  If  these  schools  were  to  be  given  autonomy,  the\nGovernment  could  save  salaries  for  them.  A  study  is  needed  to  determine  the  potential  for\nsavings  to  the  system  under  this  plan.  Other  public-private  participation  programs  need  to  be\ndeveloped and costs determined as a way to experiment in increasing demand-based education\nto offset the rising cost of secondary education.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n21.\nThe National Education Commission released the report Reforms in General Education\nin  1998.  The  report,  based  on  recommendations  from  the  Presidential  Task  Force,  focused\nmostly on improving quality through improved curriculum relevance, teaching, and educational\nmanagement.  It  also  stressed  extending  educational  opportunities  to  reduce  inequalities\nbetween  students  attending  full-curriculum  and  limited-curriculum  schools.  To  improve  quality\neducation,  the  Government,  with  World  Bank  assistance,  is  rationalizing  teacher  deployment\nand training, privatizing textbook printing and distribution, and consolidating grades 1-9 schools.\nIn planning the Project, ADB has discussed ways to consolidate grades 10-13 into a four-year\nsecondary school cycle instead of the present grades 10-11 and grades 12-13 associated with\nO and A level examinations. There is a policy to introduce SBA to allow teachers to participate\ndirectly  in  evaluating  and  providing  feedback  to  students  on  academic  and  career  matters,\nrather than relying solely on the outcome of national tests.  SBA has already been introduced\nsuccessfully in grades 6-9. Other policies are designed to broaden the range of academic skills,\nincluding  improving  English  language  and  computer  literacy.  Policies  being  considered  to\nimprove educational opportunities include raising compulsory education from grade 9 to grade\n11, consolidating grades 10-13, upgrading a number of limited \u2014 to full-curriculum schools, and\nreforming the O level examination to reduce the failure rate. Other policy considerations include\nintroducing  career  guidance  and  counseling  for  students  and  parents  to  share  information,\npromoting  public-private  partnership  in  education,  and  extending  primary  grades  academic\nstipends  to  upper  grade  late  bloomers.  The  World  Bank  and  ADB  strongly  support  these\ngovernment policies.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n22.\nAttempts  to  address  issues  of  the  quality  of  education  and  sector  management  have\nbeen supported by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies including ADB, the World Bank, JICA,\nSwedish International Development Agency (Sida), German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), and\nthe  British  Council  and  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID).    Most  of  the\nbilateral  assistance  have  been  pilot  programs  targeted  to  primary  education  including\nassistance  for  English  language  learning,  plantation  schools  in  the  mountain  areas,  and  to\n\n                                                \n6  The savings in teacher salaries will be substantial. The World Bank is assisting in developing a rationalization and\n\nteacher redeployment policy for surplus teachers expected to reach 10,000 by the year 2005.\n\n\f8\n\nschools  in  areas  of  social  conflict.  JICA  has  supported  middle  schools  (grades  6-9)  and  is\ninterested in assisting the Government along with support from the Japan Bank for International\nCooperation  (JBIC)  to  provide  computers  to  grades  1-11  schools.  External  support  is\nsummarized in Appendix 2.\n\n23.\nADB has been playing a lead role in the secondary education sector.  The ADB-assisted\nSecondary  Education  Development  Project7  (SEDP)  has  supported  the  Government  in\ndeveloping  curriculum  and  learning  materials  in  grades  6-11,  improving  the  examination  and\nevaluation  system,  including  the  establishment  of  NETS;  and  providing  physical  infrastructure\nand  equipment  for  school  development  and  upgrading,  including  piloting  30  experimental\ncomputer  laboratories,  which  were  judged  successful  by  the  Government  in  its  Project\nCompletion  Report.8  SEDP  also  developed  and  introduced  SBA  in  grades  6-9  and  developed\nprototype  materials  for  SBM  of  principals.  Many  of  these  activities  started  under  SEDP  have\nbeen expanded by the Project and include especially the SBA, SBM, examination reform, and\nquality inputs through CLCs, science laboratory work and student-based learning activities. ADB\ninvolvement in secondary education lays the foundation for a strong general education system\nthat  serves  graduates  of  basic  education  helped  by  the  World  Bank  and  many  bilateral  aid\nagencies.  At  the  same  time,  ADB  efforts  in  secondary  education  provide  the  foundation  for\nongoing ADB projects9 supporting jobs and technology outside the formal education system.\n\nThe World Bank is implementing two education projects. The Teacher Education Project\n24.\n($64  million),  which  is  nearing  completion,  was  designed  to  improve  preservice  teacher\neducation, but also included a component to develop computer education training for teachers\nin  teacher  colleges,  and  administrators  in  district  and  school  principal\u2019s  offices.10  The  General\nEducation Project ($70 million) provides for facilities, equipment, and training mainly for grades\n1-9 schools. Under the World Bank loan, schools benefit from curriculum development, textbook\npublication  with  public-private  sector  participation,  school  facilities  upgrading,  and  education\nplanning  and  financing  development  through  introduction  of  a  unit  cost  resource  allocation\nmechanism  to  address  inequalities  in  resource  allocation.  The  Project  recently  provided\ncomputer laboratories for 400 secondary schools as part of a new strategy to provide computers\nfor interactive learning in the middle grades.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n25.\nThe  lessons  in  project  performance  audit  reports  (PPARs),  project  completion  reports\n(PCRs),  Sector  Synthesis  of  Postevaluation  Findings  in  the  Education  Sector,  and  Country\nSynthesis  of  Postevaluation  Findings  across  all  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  were\ntaken  into  account  in  designing  the  Project.11  Two  relevant  lessons  from  development\nexperience  ADB-wide  apply  to  Sri  Lanka.  First,  at  the  institutional  level,  inadequate\norganizational  arrangements  and  weak  management  often  result  in  inadequate  arrangements\n\n                                                \n7  Loan 1247-SRI(SF): Secondary Education Development Project, for $31 million, approved on 24 August 1993. It\n\nclosed on 30 June 1999.\n\n8  SEDP Project Completion Report, 2000. Project Management Office, Colombo.\n9   Loan  1707-SRI(SF):  Skills Development Project,  for  $18.8  million,  approved  on  28  October  1999;  Loan  1535-\nSRI(SF): Science and Technology Personnel Development, for $20 million, approved on 11 September 1997; and\nTA  3073-SRI: Improving Educational Planning, for $800,000, approved 23 September 1998. The final report of the\nTA  was  used  to  prepare  the  Government\u2019s  Tertiary  Education  Strategy  for  the  Development  Forum  in  Paris  in\nDecember 2000.\n\n10 Computer Studies Report. 1999. World Bank Teacher Education and Teacher Deployment Project.\n11  As  the  secondary  education  portfolio  is  still  new  in  Sri  Lanka,  no  ADB  PCRs  or  PPARs  were  undertaken  for\n\nsecondary education projects.\n\n\f9\n\nfor continuous benefit monitoring and evaluation of projects. Second, a major limitation of policy\ndialogue  in  Sri  Lanka  has  been  the  weakness  among  all  levels  of  government,  local\ncommunities, and the private sector to address long standing education governance problems.\n\nExamples of weaknesses found in organizational administration can be seen in the way\n26.\nMEHE operated in the past. The Ministry spent too much time attending to details of answering\ncomplaints and administering procurement. Under the reorganization, many routine operations\nhave  been  delegated  to  the  local  level,  leaving  time  for  MEHE  to  concentrate  on  setting  and\nmonitoring  standards.  With  World  Bank  assistance,  MEHE  has  established  a  computerized\ndatabase to rationalize school staffing and enrollments, and will allow for continuous monitoring\nof the education system.\n\nSchool effectiveness will be improved by greater community participation and delegation\n27.\nof authority under the MEHE reorganization. Community participation provides ownership for the\neducation system in general and the project components in particular. Previously, the SDS was\nnot  allowed  to  raise  and  spend  funds  without  permission  from  MEHE.  New  rules  give  greater\nflexibility  to  approval  for  small-scale  spending.  The  role  of  the  principal  also  needs  to  be\nexpanded  to  increase  decentralized  decision  making.  Together  the  SDS  and  the  principal  will\nhave  to  make  decisions  on  spending  so  as  to  ensure  an  adequate  supply  of  electricity  and  to\nmaintain  school  learning  resources.  At  present,  these  concepts  are  not  well  understood  by\neducation  officers  and  principals,  and  the  only  way  to  get  schools  to  take  responsibility  is  to\nmake principals accountable to the parents. At the national level, MEHE quality assurance will\nbe critical to introduce decentralized administration to both local education offices and schools.\n\nTo overcome the first weakness, the project management office (PMO) from SEDP will\n28.\nbe  expanded  and  more  closely  integrated  within  the  newly  organized  MEHE.    More  qualified\nstaff will ensure that the day-to-day implementation work is carried out in a scheduled manner\nso  that  contracts  for  procurement  and  consultants  are  prepared  on  time.  This  will  allow  for\nidentification  of  project  schools  in  the  phased  schedule  and  for  coordination  of  training  and\nfellowships in proper sequence. Closer links to the unit in MEHE responsible for monitoring and\nplanning  secondary  education  will  ensure  that  monitoring  takes  place  in  a  simple  but  efficient\nmanner. The MEHE reorganization will go far to streamline the monitoring of school results as\nwell as to introduce SBM.\n\n29.\nThe  second  lesson  pertains  to  the  need  for  MEHE  to  address  long-standing  education\nissues under governance. Under SEDP and the World Bank projects, MEHE often did not follow\nthrough  to  sustain  important  policy  measures  required  to  ensure  project  momentum.  SBM\ncourses were offered to principals under SEDP, but they were too academic in content. A strong\nSBM  program  as  part  of  quality  assurance  under  the  MEHE  reorganization  has  been\nredesigned  to  strengthen  the  existing  supervision  procedures  starting  at  the  provincial  to  the\nzonal level. The SBM system will include a strong awareness program for the principal, school\nstaff, and SDS leaders through the MEHE quality assurance unit, the NETS SBA system, and\nthrough the NIE in-service teacher training. Together, the multiple support system approach of\nNETS,  NIE,  and  MEHE  is  expected  to  provide,  respectively,  examination,  teacher  in-service\ntraining, and administrative supervision that will strengthen the role of the principal and SDS.\n\n30.\nQuality  assurance  requires  MEHE  support  to  improve  classroom  learning.    Lessons\nlearned  from  previous  ADB  secondary  school  science  projects  in  South  Asia  suggest  that\nprincipals  and  administrative  staff  require  awareness  training  to  ensure  commitment  to\nclassroom  learning.    Under  the  Project,  extensive  SBM  and  teacher  training  is  provided  to\n\n\f10\n\nlearning  and  subsequent  SBA,  which \n\nis  closely \n\ntied \n\nto  national\n\nimprove  classroom \nexaminations.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n31.\nADB\u2019s  current  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  was  approved  in  1999.  The  strategy\naims to assist Sri Lanka to reduce poverty and achieve a sustainable higher level of economic\ngrowth by supporting (i) policy and institutional reforms to promote private sector development\nand improved public sector management, (ii) human resource development to address the gap\nin  marketable  skills  and  improve  employment  and  income  levels,  (iii) enhancement  of  the\ncountry\u2019s infrastructure through public and private investment, (iv) preservation of the country\u2019s\nnatural resources base, and (v) measures to mitigate the social and environmental impact of the\ntransition  to  a  higher  growth  path.  The  COS  highlights  the  declining  quality  of  education,  the\nmismatch of skills supplied to the labor market, deteriorating knowledge of English and scientific\nand technical subjects, more emphasis on creative rather than rote learning, refocusing of the\nGovernment\u2019s role from provider to facilitator of development, and a more rational utilization of\nresources including legal provision of funding for private education. In line with the thrust of the\nCOS  and  ADB\u2019s  overarching  objective  of  poverty  reduction,  ADB  continues  to  support  the\nGovernment\u2019s reform initiatives in the education sector as human development is a prerequisite\nfor sustainable economic growth. Education will also help both the rural and urban poor acquire\nsocial and physical capital.\n\n32.\nThe  ADB  education  strategy  in  Sri  Lanka  emphasizes  secondary  and  postsecondary\neducation. The country has made progress in enrolling all students in school through grade 9.\nThe World Bank and other aid agencies have focused on the 7,700 schools providing primary\nand  middle  school  education.  The  ADB  strategy  is  to  encourage  raising  the  compulsory\nschooling level to grade 11 and to ensure that at least half of the students taking the grade 11\nnational examination pass it. This will improve equity and access to secondary education almost\nimmediately.  ADB  also  stresses  improving  teaching  in  grades  12-13  to  raise  the  level  of\nacademic skills in English, science, mathematics, reasoning and computer skills for 17- and 18-\nyear-olds to give them after graduation the choice to continue with schooling or enter the labor\nforce in the modern economy. The strategy also allows for greater equity as access to quality\nschools for the poor is improved. Secondary education is seen as the foundation of a strong and\nequitable education system. In addition to earlier support for general secondary education, ADB\nalready  has  provided  assistance  for  science  and  technology  (S&T)  and  skills  programs  for\nstudents  who  opt  out  of  the  formal  education  system  prior  to  grade  12  (Loans  1707-SRI  and\n1535-SRI, footnote 9). ADB also supports the Government\u2019s need to strengthen postsecondary\neducation in both the public and private sector. This includes open university/distance learning\nand, most important, proprietary education and on-the-job training as a way of increasing public-\nprivate  participation  to  improve  efficiency  and  mobility  opportunities  for  students  after\ncompleting  secondary  school.  In  the  area  of  educational  technologies,  ADB  views  the  level  of\ndevelopment  in  Sri  Lanka  as  sufficient  to  allow  widespread  use  of  computers  in  secondary\nschools to prepare students for the labor market and for postsecondary education and training\nwhere computer use is widespread.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n33.\nADB has been involved in education sector policy dialogue with MEHE under SEDP and\nTA 3073-SRI: Improving Education Planning (footnote 9) designed to improve school efficiency\nand governance. Key issues discussed include (i) provision of full access to quality schooling for\ndisadvantaged  students  attending  small  schools,  in  an  attempt  to  increase  school  attendance\n\n\f11\n\nfor  all  from  age  14  to  age  16;  (ii)  strengthening  NETS  to  improve  the  reliability  and  validity  of\nnational examinations through improved test administration and the introduction of SBA; and (iii)\nrestructuring  of  MEHE  to  focus  on  policy  and  standards  setting  to  assist  the  local  schools  to\nstrengthen management and supervision. In addition to specific policies on school access to be\naddressed  through  the  project  components,  ADB  has  urged  the  Government  to  improve\nefficiency  through  good  governance  and  through  cost  recovery  and  public-private  partnership\ndesigned to guarantee the sustainability of the secondary education system.\n\n1.\n\nImproved Access for the Poor\n\n34.\nADB has pointed out the need to ensure equitable access to schools for the poor. The\nGovernment has provided scholarships, the most common of which is the scholarship program\nstarting in grade 6 for those who successfully pass a special examination. The Government is\nalso interested in piloting a program to provide stipends for late bloomers starting in grade 10.\nUnder the Project, ADB will assist MEHE to introduce two stipend programs (one for grades 10\nand 11 students, and the other for grades 12 and 13 students) through block grants to schools\nto  provide  disadvantaged  students  with  resources  for  undergoing  remedial  tutoring  and/or\nattending better schools nearby. Stipends will be based on academic ability judged by results of\nthe grade 9 examination for recipients of grades 10-11 awards and the results of the grade 11\nexamination for recipients of grades 12-13 stipends. Also, a means test for family income to be\ndetermined by the project steering committee will be applied to select disadvantaged students\nwith high ability who would not pass the grade 11 national examination without assistance. The\nstipend  program  is  intended  to  help  increase  the  number  of  students  passing  the  grade  11\nexamination. Currently, over 90 percent of all students attend grade 11, but only about one third\npass  the  grade  11  examination.  If  the  pass  rate  can  be  increased  through  improved  learning,\nstudents will have the opportunity to complete secondary school. As a consequence, the recent\ngovernment  regulation  to  make  education  compulsory  through  grade  9  (age  14)  should  be\nmodified to apply to grade 11 (age 16), which is considered the minimum for a modern school\nsystem, by 2004. Other activities to improve access to secondary education under the Project\ninclude  career  guidance  programs  by  2002  aimed  at  motivating  students  to  pursue  academic\ncareers  for  good  jobs  and  the  move  to  improve  public-private  partnerships  in  education  to\nreduce the financial pressure on the public education finance.\n\n35.\nA second policy initiative related to increasing access pertains to improving the national\nexamination  system  to  allow  more  students  to  be  successful  in  their  academic  studies.  Under\nSEDP, NETS was established to separate national examinations from civil service examinations\nunder  the  Department  of  Examinations.  NETS  will  require  additional  resources  to  develop\nimproved  testing,  administrative  procedures,  monitoring,  and  research.  The  Government  has\ngiven  assurances  that  NETS  will  be  fully  staffed  and  funded  over  the  coming  years.  This  is\nespecially important because NETS has taken on the new role of training teachers in the use of\nSBA.  SBA  provides  feedback  to  parents  and  students  of  day-to-day  assignments  on  special\nprojects  and  schoolwork.  It  also  assesses  attitudes  and  deportment.    Under  the  Project,  SBA\nwill  be  introduced  in  grades  10-13  so  they  can  be  counted  toward  graduation  along  with  the\nnational  examination.  SBA  is  most  effective  in  making  school  attendance  important  for  both\nteachers  and  students  when  teachers  employ  new  practices  emphasizing  activity-based  study\nthat  applies  theory  with  practice.  Under  the  Project,  support  for  SBA  will  assess  learning\nactivities introduced under the Project to ensure that quality improvements stemming from these\nactivities will contribute to graduation.\n\n\f12\n\n2.\n\nGovernance\n\n36.\nMore than anything else, MEHE\u2019s success in overcoming educational inefficiencies will\ndepend on the quality of its governance, including management and planning linked to regional\nand local education institutions. Especially in education, participation by teachers and parents is\nnecessary  to  generate  ownership  and  sustainability  of  community  resources  in  local  schools.\nMEHE  has  been  restructured  to  strengthen  its  planning  function  and  to  devolve  day-to-day\ndecision making to the local level. ADB encourages this movement through the strengthening of\nthe  school  inspectorate  to  review  the  learning  requirements  of  teaching  and  through\nstrengthening the leadership role of principals, provincial, district, zonal and divisional officers in\nlocal decision making with the assistance of the community.\n\n3.\n\nSustainability\n\n37.\nTo reduce costs, the concept of public-private partnerships has been raised with MEHE.\nSince  nationalization  of  schools  in  the  early  1970s,  education  has  been  almost  exclusively\npublic  and  private  education  has  been  discouraged.  However,  the  Government  is  currently\nunable to expand financial resources for education and other means must be found to pay for\nquality  improvements.  One  possibility  is  to  allow  selected  schools  to  collect  fees  to  pay  for\nteachers\u2019 salaries. However, these schools would appoint their own boards, pay teachers, and\nobserve the national curriculum and examinations. Such a public-private partnership scheme for\nschools  would  be  fair  because  if  children  from  better-off  households  select  private  schools,\nmore public money could be targeted toward the poor.  ADB will encourage a study of public-\nprivate  partnerships  in  education  with  the  expectation  that  decisions  to  remove  the  ban  on\nprivate schools will be forthcoming.\n\n38.\nSustainability  also  requires  cost  recovery.    Parents  already  pay  over  20  percent  of\nsecondary school costs including private tutoring and voluntary school fees. MEHE has agreed\nto  have  schools  charge  facility  fees  for  CLCs  to  cover  the  costs  for  software,  electricity,  and\noperations and maintenance (O&M) charges.  These fees are levied by SDSs and the funds go\nspecifically to pay the costs incurred by CLCs.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n39. While Sri Lanka has achieved progress in basic human development, it has been unable\nto translate these achievements into broad-based, sustainable economic growth. Worse still, the\nrural  poor  have  not  had  equal  access  to  human  resources  necessary  to  acquire  social  and\nphysical  capital.  A  key  reason  for  this  failure  to  achieve  more  rapid  economic  growth  with\ngreater  equity  is  the  deficiency  of  the  education  system.  Strong  state  dominance  and  an\ninflexible  regulatory  framework  that  limits  choice  have  characterized  the  system.  There  is  an\noverreliance on national tests as opposed to SBA, as well as a mismatch between ability to pay\nand  secondary  school  educational  services  offered.  There  is  little  choice  in  the  quality  of\neducation  especially  for  the  poor,  access  to  stipends  or  opportunities  for  public-private\npartnerships  are  limited  and,  finally,  supervision  and  management  style  from  the  national  to\nlocal level are inadequate. These conditions have created an inefficient and inflexible secondary\neducation system that restricts curriculum choice and occupational opportunities, and one that\ngraduates  students  unequipped  with  marketable  skills  and  unprepared  to  participate  in  the\nmodern  economy.  The  result  is  relatively  high  unemployment  among  the  educated  while\n\n\f13\n\nemerging  modern  sector  employment  opportunities  are  unfilled  due  to  lack  of  qualified\ncandidates. Sri Lanka views modernization of secondary education as one of the main pillars of\nits  drive  for  economic  and  social  development  and  a  key  to  reducing  regional  disparities.\nConsequently,  there  is  no  alternative  but  to  improve  school  quality  by  raising  standards,  to\nimprove access especially for the poor through greater choice of quality curriculum offerings and\nto  improve  administrative  efficiency  through  strong  school  leadership  and  administrative\ndecentralization.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n40.\nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  secondary  school  to  raise\nnational examination results for one million grades 10-13 students in 2,300 secondary schools\nnationwide.  Improved  education  will  increase  classroom  learning  and  raise  pass  rates  on\nnational examinations. The Project will also improve access to these quality improvements for\ndisadvantaged students through stipends and by upgrading existing secondary schools to full-\ncurriculum  schools  in  disadvantaged  areas.  This  will  ensure  that  up  to  50,000  additional\nstudents  each  year  for  12  years  will  pass  the  grade  11  national  examination.  The  Project  will\nimprove  management  and  supervision  throughout  the  national,  provincial,  and  local  education\ninstitutions so that teachers and principals will have greater control over classroom learning as it\naffects school efficiency.\n\n41.\nThe  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  quality,  (ii)  access,  and  (iii)  efficiency.  Quality\ninvolves (i) school-based student learning activities and assessment for core subjects in grades\n10-13,  and  (ii)  expanded  computer  technology-directed  learning.  Access  will  (i)  broaden\neducational opportunities by expanding by 100 the number of full-curriculum schools in remote\nareas,  (ii)  extend  stipend  programs  to  over  30,000  academically  qualified  poor  students,\n(iii) introduce  career  guidance  in  all  secondary  schools  to  enhance  students\u2019  educational  and\noccupational  choice,  and  (iv)  conduct  studies  on  cost  recovery  in  secondary  education  and\nbased  on  the  finding  of  the  study  recommend  a  public-private  partnership  model  to  make\nsecondary  education  competitive.  Efficiency  will  improve  the  delivery  of  educational  services\nthrough (i) quality assurance within MEHE and the strengthening of local supervision and SBM,\n(ii) SBA in grades 10-13 including modernizing the national examination administration at NETS;\n(iii) NIE curriculum development and in-service training in new A level technology stream, career\nguidance,  and  computer  training;  and  (iv) project  implementation  at  the  PMO.  The  project\nmanagement structure and design summary are found in Appendix 3.\n\n1.\n\nQuality Improvement in Grades 10-13 (Component 1)\n\na.\n\nStrengthening of Curriculum Subjects\n\nThis  subcomponent  will  strengthen  the  quality  of  teaching  in  grades  10-13  subjects\n42.\nincluding  English,  science,  mathematics,  environmental  studies,  new  technology  courses,  and\ncommerce  while  paying  special  attention  to  schoolwork  that  emphasizes  the  application  of\nacademic  knowledge.  The  activities  include  development  of  learning  materials,  redeployment\nand  training  of  teachers  in  the  application  of  activity-based  learning  including  monitoring,\nstudies, and evaluation of these activities. Multimedia rooms will be provided in 2,300 secondary\nschools  to  allow  the  use  of  television,  VCRs,  and  audiocassettes  for  learning  materials  in  key\nsubjects and digital reference materials. Teachers will be trained in the use of learning materials\nand in evaluating student day-to-day activities in the classroom for use in assessing proficiency\nat  the  end  of  the  year  for  each  grade  and  subject.  About  30  schools  in  regional  areas  with\n\n\f14\n\nadjacent  woodlands  will  be  designated  environmental  learning  parks  and  the  staff  provided\nequipment and training to conduct environmental studies.\n\nb.\n\nComputer Learning Centers\n\n43.\nAs agreed upon by MEHE and ADB, this subcomponent will provide about 800 nationally\ntargeted  secondary  schools  with  CLCs  for  use  in  developing  computer  literacy  and  interactive\nlearning  in  core  subjects.  A  computer  literacy  syllabus  will  be  revised,12  introduced,  and\neventually  made  mandatory  for  A  level  students  and  will  include  IT  and  interactive  learning  in\nschool subjects as well as tutorials for national examinations. There will be civil works to convert\nschool  classrooms  to  CLCs;  furniture,  computer  equipment,  and  air  conditioners;  learning\nmaterials  including  software,  digital  library  reference  materials;  consultancies,  fellowships  and\ntraining;  and  recurrent  costs  to  run  the  CLCs  during  and  after  school  hours.  Depending  on\nschool size, CLCs will be equipped with15, 20, or 25 computers each for use by two students.\nThe provincial education department, principal, and SDS will monitor computer usage on a fee\nbasis during and after school by the school and community.\n\n2.\n\nAccess to Quality Instruction for Disadvantaged Students (Component 2)\n\na.\n\nUpgrading to Full-Curriculum Schools\n\n44.\nThe subcomponent will improve the quality of science education throughout the country,\nparticularly  at  A  level  (Grades  12-13),  through  the  extension  of  science  laboratory  facilities  in\n100 schools in administrative divisions of the country currently lacking facilities. The objective is\nto  provide  A  level  science  laboratories  to  the  schools  selected  for  upgrading  in  administrative\ndivisions  where  (i)  no  full-curriculum  schools  exist  with  grades  12-13  science  laboratories;  (ii)\nmore schools are needed to increase A level science laboratory facilities to satisfy gender and\nethnic  diversity;  (iii) science  laboratory  facilities  are  insufficient  to  meet  student  enrollment\ndemand; or (iv) grades 12-13 science laboratory facilities are inadequate in some existing full-\ncurriculum schools to meet grades 12-13 science student requirements. One science laboratory\nfor  biology  and  chemistry  and  one  for  physics  will  be  provided  along  with  furniture  and\nequipment. School surveys will determine the potential increase in access to upgraded schools.\n\nb.\n\nStipends for Disadvantaged Students\n\ntargeted \n\ninterventions \n\nto  allow  up \n\nThis  subcomponent  will  provide \n\n45.\nto  30,000\ndisadvantaged  students  to  avail  themselves  of  the  expanded  access  by  making  it  possible  for\nstudents from poorer schools  to  attend upgraded, full-curriculum schools.  The transfer to full-\ncurriculum schools is likely to cause some economic stress to the students in the form of travel\ncosts  to  and  from  school.  The  disadvantaged  students  are  also  likely  to  face  some  academic\nstress in adapting to a strenuous and more demanding academic environment.  Stipends will be\ntargeted  first  at  about  10,000  grades  10-11  academically  qualified  students  from  poor  families\nwho can benefit from attending quality schools and receiving remedial instruction and tutorials.\nThey  will  help  poor  students  to  pass  the  grade  11  national  examination.  The  second  set  of\nstipends (about 20,000) are awards for grades 12 and 13 academically qualified poor students\nin  danger  of  not  completing  course  work  due  to  financial  problems.  The  stipends  will  help\nensure  that  poor  students  complete  grades  12-13.    The  stipend  amounts  cover  additional\n\n                                                \n12 Wyburn, D. and K. Karunanayake. 1999. Computer Studies. World Bank.\n\n\f15\n\ntransport, tutoring fees and supplementary books, and in some cases, boarding. The stipends\nwill be administered as a block grant to a school.\n\nc.\n\nCareer Guidance for Educational Opportunities\n\n46.\nThis  subcomponent  will  provide  all  grades  10-13  students  with  access  to  learning\nmaterials  including  video  cassettes  and  computer  software  to  increase  information  about\neducation  and training as  a  means  to income generation. Students will be made aware of the\ndiversity of career opportunities that exist and ways to acquire the skills needed to avail of these\nopportunities.  Career  guidance  will  especially  be  directed  at  girls  to  encourage  careers  in\nscience and commerce subjects that are currently not being adequately accessed by them. At\npresent, 560 schools have each been provided with a teacher trained in career guidance. The\nDepartment  of  Samurdi13  has  assisted  250  of  those  schools  with  furniture  for  the  use  of  the\nteacher and some information booklets. The subcomponent will supplement the existing career\nguidance program in the schools by providing studies, learning materials, and teacher training.\n\nd.\n\nPublic-Private Partnerships and Secondary School Financing\n\n47.\nThe  country  has  exceptional  achievement  in  making  basic  education  accessible  to  all\nchildren  of  school  age  through  an  equitable  system  of  education  that  is  entirely  state  funded.\nHowever, to derive the benefits of a global economy, the focus of the education system needs\nto  shift  from  inculcation  of  basic  educational  skills  to  developing  a  highly  skilled  manpower\ncapable of making the country competitive in the global economy.  The education system in its\npresent form is not equipped to aim for excellence through the quality of education that is being\noffered.    That  there  are  schools  offering  better  quality  education  than  at  present  and  that\nparents  are  willing  to  pay  for  this  is  evident  from  the  very  extensive  demand  for  out-of-school\nsupplemental  tuition.    The  government  recognizes  the  need  to  encourage  public-private\npartnerships  in  education  and  there  is  a  move  toward  a  study  and  review  of  the  legislation\nprohibiting private participation in education. The Project will support the implementation of such\na review and will conduct a study to explore the role that public-private partnerships can play in\neducation to revitalize the sector and make it competitive.\n\n3.\n\nEfficiency in Management and Supervision (Component 3)\n\na.\n\nMinistry of Education and Higher Education\n\nThe  subcomponent  will  assist  with  MEHE  reorganization  to  (i)  strengthen  the  school\n48.\nmanagement  and  supervision  directorate  to  upgrade  the  line  of  command  from  the  national,\nprovincial,  zonal  and  divisional  offices  to  support  secondary  education  supervision;  and  (ii)\nestablish a separate SBM model for the secondary education system under the deputy director\ngeneral of quality assurance and management. Extensive training in SBM for principals, senior\nteachers,  zonal  education  officers,  and  school  management  council  representatives  will  be\nconducted, and workshops and seminars will ensure that various interventions under the Project\nincluding  SBA,  computer  laboratories  and  multimedia  rooms,  career  guidance,  and  stipend\nprograms are efficiently implemented and made sustainable.\n\n                                                \n13 Department for the alleviation of poverty.\n\n\f16\n\nb.\n\nNational Evaluation and Testing Service\n\n49.\nThis subcomponent will strengthen NETS by providing additional resources to implement\nSBA  in  grades  10-13  through  improved  staffing,  staff  development,  and  legislative  changes.\nImprovements will increase the capacity of NETS to reform the O and A level examinations by\nincluding  item  banking,  test  administration,  grading,  and  scheduling  leading  to  improved  test\ndesign and administration. The introduction of SBA into grades 10-13 under the control of NETS\nis essential for improving classroom teaching, widening the learning outcomes of the students,\nand creating a more comprehensive measure of achievement. Training in SBA will help improve\nthe evaluation process and help teachers, students, and parents to realize the importance and\nvalue of schoolwork and study.\n\nc.\n\nNational Institute of Education\n\n50.\nThis  subcomponent  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  NIE  to  carry  out  curriculum  and\ninstructional materials development, and in-service teacher training to implement innovations in\ngrades 10-13. Activities will include upgrading curricula and training secondary school teachers\nin  selected  curricula  subjects  especially  in  activity-based  methodologies  needed  to  strengthen\nSBA. Other training is in career guidance and computer education. Equipment will be provided\nto develop the new technology syllabi for introduction on a pilot basis to about 30 full-curriculum\nschools and the staff upgrading of two computer laboratories with new equipment for the NIE in-\nservice  training  computer  center.  An  office  and  equipment  for  copying  secondary  school\ncurricula off the Internet will be provided along with resources to download and transform these\nlearning materials into CD-ROM for distribution to schools.\n\nd.\n\nProject Management Office\n\n51.\nThe PMO from the recently completed SEDP will be upgraded to take on a greater role\nin  managing  and  supervising  the  proposed  Project.  The  staff  of  the  existing  PMO  are\nconversant  with  ADB  and  Government  procedures  for  foreign-aided  projects  and  have  the\nexperience to successfully implement the follow-up Project.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n52.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $76.0  million  equivalent,  including  taxes,\nduties,  interest  charge  on  the  ADB  loan,  and  physical  and  price  contingencies.  The  foreign\nexchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $38.8  million  (51  percent),  and  the  local  currency  cost  is\nestimated  at  $37.2  million  equivalent  (49  percent)  of  the  total  cost.  A  summary  of  the  cost\nestimates is in Table 1.\n\n\f17\n\nTable 1: Indicative Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nCategory\n\n    \n\n       \n\n          Foreign        Local\n\nTotal\n      Exchange   Currency    Cost\n\nA.

ADB will finance 66 percent of the overall project cost, comprising 85 percent of the\nforeign exchange cost and 46 percent of the local currency cost of the Project. The ADB loan\nwill have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge at the\nrate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The\nNordic Development Fund (NDF) will provide a credit of $7.0 million equivalent as parallel and\ntied  cofinancing  for  the  Project.    NDF  will  finance  consulting  services,  science  equipment  kits,\nand  science  equipment  for  grades  12  and  13.  The  Government  will  provide  $17.0  million\nequivalent  mainly  for  a  portion  of  the  local  currency  costs  of  civil  works,  science  equipment,\nlocal  training,  studies,  project  implementation,  and  O&M  costs.  SDSs  will  provide  $2.0  million\nequivalent  for  operational  expenditure  for  the  multimedia  rooms  and  the  CLCs  (electricity\ncharges,  school  security,  and  furniture  for  the  multimedia  rooms).  The  financing  plan  is\nsummarized in Table 2 and details are in Appendix 4.\n\n\f18\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\n  \n\n Foreign\nExchange\n\n         Local\n      Currency\n\n       \n\n     32.8\n       6.0\n       0.0 \n       0.0\n\n      38.8\n\n17.2\n  1.0\n17.0\n  2.0\n\n 37.2\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n50.0\n  7.0\n17.0\n  2.0\n\n76.0\n\nPercent\n\n   66\n     9\n   22\n     3\n\n 100\n\nSource\n\nADB\nNDF   \nGovernment\nBeneficiariesa\n\nTotal\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, NDF = Nordic Development Fund.\na School development societies.\n\n54.\nThe proposed level of local currency financing by ADB takes into account the uncertain\nmedium-term  economic  prospects  of  the  country  and  the  Government\u2019s  continuing  inability  to\nself  finance  a  substantial  portion  of  the  investment  program  required  to  enable  Sri  Lanka  to\nundergo social and economic transformation and to reduce the high rates of poverty.  Between\n1994 and 1999, the Government succeeded in reducing the budget deficit from 10.5 percent of\nGDP to 8.0 percent.  A significant reduction in outlays was also achieved through the retirement\nof  the  public  debt  in  1997  using  privatization  proceeds.    In  1997  and  again  in  1998,  the\nGovernment  counterguaranteed  private  sector  borrowing  on  the  international  market  under\nADB\u2019s  guarantee  scheme.    Future  efforts  to  improve  fiscal  performance  include  additional\ndivestiture,  establishment  of  a  Revenue  Protection  Unit  to  improve  tax  collection,  and\nappointment  of  an  independent  committee  to  review  public  sector  salaries.    Despite  these\nactions,  the  overall  capacity  of  the  Government  to  self-finance  the  public  sector  investment\nprogram  in  the  coming  years  is  still  limited  as  debt  servicing  and  costs  related  to  the  ongoing\ncivil conflict continue to absorb about 50 percent of budget outlays.  The proposed level of local\ncost  financing  for  the  Project  is  therefore  considered  justified  in  view  of  the  prevailing  difficult\ncountry circumstances and the expected positive impact on poverty reduction.  In addition, local\ncurrency  financing  for  classroom  civil  works  and  school  learning  materials  is  justified  over  the\nshort  term  to  give  the  Government  time  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  public  expenditures  and\nprivate sector participation in revenue-generating education sector projects.\n\nE.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n55.\nThe Ministry of Education and Higher Education will be the Executing Agency. The inter-\nministerial  steering  committee  under  the  chairmanship  of  the  secretary  of  MEHE  will  be\nresponsible  for  policy  guidance,  coordination,  and  implementation  of  the  Project.  It  will  be\nestablished within 3 months after the effectiveness date. MEHE staff on the committee include\nthe  project  director  of  PMO  (recording  secretary),  additional  secretaries  (educational  reform,\nplanning \nquality\nassurance/management  and  school  organization.  Other  institutions  represented  are  the\ncommissioner  general  of  NETS  and  the  director  general  of  NIE,  representatives  from  MOFP\nincluding  the  national  planning,  and  external  resource  departments  and  provincial  education\ndepartments (PEDs). The steering committee will meet at least four times each year to review\nprogress implementation, ensure that resources are made available in a timely manner, monitor\nkey policy decisions, and coordinate between MEHE, NETS, NIE, and PEDs.\n\ndevelopment), \n\neducational \n\ngenerals, \n\ndirector \n\ndeputy \n\nand \n\n\f19\n\nThe PMO in MEHE, established for the ADB Secondary Education Development Project,\n56.\nwill be retained and expanded. It will be responsible for day-to-day operations of the Project. It\nwill  be  headed  by  a  project  director  and  will  include,  on  a  full-time  basis,  an  accountant,  a\ndeputy/assistant  director,  administration  officer,  engineer,  procurement  officer,  and  adequate\nsupport  staff.  The  PMO  will  undertake  activities  in  2000  to  ensure  that  the  Project  begins  full\noperation  by  the  time  of  loan  effectiveness,  which  is  expected  in  December  2000,  so  that  the\nProject can be  completed in five years. The preliminary activities in 2000 include (i) preparing\nschool proposals for about 200 secondary schools by involving principals and zonal officers to\ntake project ownership, (ii) preparing consulting services contracts so bidding can be carried out\nwithin  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  and  (iii)  preparing  civil  works  and  procurement\npackages for the first set of 200 schools to be provided CLCs and multimedia rooms during the\nfirst year of project implementation.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nImplementation Period\n\n57.\nThe Project will be implemented over a period of five years commencing January 2001,\nwith  Project  completion  by  the  end  of  2005.  The  PMO  from  SEDP  will  be  retained  and  made\nfully  operational  by  1  October  2000.    Under  SEDP,  project  implementation  went  well  and  the\nPMO staff were retained for the Project. The indicative implementation schedule is in Appendix\n5.\n\n2.\n\nProcurement\n\na.\n\nCivil Works\n\n58.\nAll  civil  works  contracts  under  the  Project  will  be  awarded  under  local  competitive\nbidding  (LCB)  among  prequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard\nprocurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Civil  works  will  involve  the  rehabilitation  and\nconversion  of  about  3,000  classrooms  into  multimedia  rooms  and  CLCs,  and  rehabilitation  of\nthe PMO.  About 100 secondary schools will be upgraded to full-curriculum schools with science\nlaboratories,  with  at  least  two  science  rooms  provided  where  necessary.      The  civil  works  are\nsmall  and  scattered  throughout  the  country  and  are  not  likely  to  attract  the  interest  of\ninternational  bidders.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  quality  control,  costs,  and\nimplementation.  The proposed procurement packages and their estimated costs are shown in\nAppendix 6.\n\nb.\n\nEquipment\n\nSchool  equipment  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),\n59.\ninternational  shopping  (IS),  or  direct  purchase  (DP),  as  applicable,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. The Project will finance the procurement of standard packages of\nscience equipment for grades 10-13 science laboratories for the upgraded schools (to be fully\nprovided  by  the  Government  for  grades  10-11,  and  by  NDF  for  grades  12-13,  and  additional\npackages  of  grades  12-13  science  kits),  televisions,  VCRs,  and  radio  cassette  players  for\nmultimedia  rooms,  computers,  printers,  and  air  conditioners  for  computer  laboratories;\ntelephone/faxes for schools and zonal offices; and furniture, equipment, vehicles, and recurrent\nbudget  for  PMO,  NETS,  NIE,  and  MEHE.  Computer  equipment  will  be  procured  in  packages\ndivided  by  geographic  region  and  phased  to  meet  schedules  as  schools  are  identified,  and\n\n\f20\n\ncomputer  and  multimedia  laboratories  become  available.  Supply  contracts  for  MEHE,  NETS,\nand NIE equipment costing $500,000 or less will follow IS or DP as applicable (Appendix 6).\n\nc.\n\nLearning Materials\n\nLearning  materials  will  be  procured \n\n60.\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nProcurement.  The  Project  will  finance  the  purchase  of  textbooks  and  learning  materials  for\ngrades 10-13, computer software, video and audio cassettes, library books, teacher guides and\nstudent  laboratory  manuals.  As  the  estimated  package  costs  are  less  than  $500,000,\nprocurement will follow IS or DP as applicable.  Grades 12-13 print materials, career guidance\nmaterials, and evaluation and testing materials may be procured locally in accordance with the\nGovernment\u2019s standard procedures acceptable to ADB as these items are small and available\nlocally (Appendix 6).\n\nd.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nThe project will provide 373 person-months of consulting services (190 international and\n61.\n183  domestic).  The  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  will  be  agreed  upon  by  NDF,  the\nGovernment,  and  ADB.  With  NDF  cofinancing  of  consulting  services,  the  consultants  will  be\nengaged  by  MEHE  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  guidelines  of  NDF.14  ADB  prepared  the\nterms  of  reference  and  will  review  any  changes  prior  to  invitation  of  the  proposals.  The\nconsultants will assist with institutional strengthening of NETS, NIE, and MEHE, and will provide\nassistance to NETS to improve efficiency in day-to-day operations in developing and managing\nthe  examination  system,  introducing  SBA  and  conducting  research  to  improve  examination\nadministration procedures.  NIE will require consultants to develop and implement activity-based\nexercises in core academic subjects that will be linked to SBA and reported back to parents and\nstudents.    Subjects  include  science  and  technology,  mathematics,  English,  and  agricultural\ntechnology including provision of CLC hardware and software and training. MEHE consultants\nwill assist in setting up school management systems and training principals, teachers, and SDS\nleaders.  The  number  of  consultants  is  considered  the  minimum  necessary  to  develop  and\nimplement the new programs in career guidance, computer education, SBA, and SBM.  MEHE\nwill  require  consultants  to  assist  in  the  development  of  the  SBM  system  and  to  train  national,\nprovincial  and  local  administrators,  principals  and  teachers,  and  SDS  representatives.    The\nrequired consulting services and the terms of reference are in Appendix 7.\n\ne. \n\nStaff Training and Development\n\n62.\nThe Project will finance a total of 48 person-months of study visits for 88 persons, and\n211 person-months of international fellowships for 93 persons.  The Project will provide funding\nfor about 19,000 person-months of in-country training, workshops for about 110,000 education\nstaff,  and  about  30,000  scholarships  for  disadvantaged  students  in  grades  10-13  according  to\nthe  indicative  numbers  in  Appendix  8.   MEHE  will  ensure  that  the  candidates  selected  for  the\noverseas  study  visits  and  fellowships  satisfy  the  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and\nADB.  The Government will ensure that the overseas study visits and fellowships are provided\nto  candidates  in  accordance  with  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.    In  accordance  with\nstandard  Government  procedures,  ADB  will  be  provided  with  (i)  a  list  of  the  nominated\ncandidates,  (ii)  candidates\u2019  qualifications,  (iii)  nominated  institutions,  and  (iv)  detailed  costs  of\n\n                                                \n14  Other  examples  of  projects  with  tied  cofinancing  for  consulting  services  include  Loan  1707-SRI(SF):  Skills\nDevelopment Project,  for  $18.8  million,  approved  on  28  October  1999,  and  Loan  1637-MLD(SF): Postsecondary\nEducation Development Project, for $6.3 million, approved on 30 September 1998.\n\n\f21\n\nthe approved courses.  The Government will adapt a strict system of selection and bonding for\nthis  training  to  ensure  that  the  recipients  continue  their  services  in  related  positions  for  a\nreasonable  period  of  time  upon  completion  of  the  training.    Overseas  fellowships  and  study\nvisits  will  be  administered  by  the  PMO.    MEHE  will  ensure  that  local  training  is  provided  to\ncandidates in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB and that the candidates satisfy\nthe criteria agreed upon by the Government and ADB. Student stipends will be approved by the\nPMO and administered by school principals through block grants for transport, learning material,\nand  tuition  payments.    The  procedures  for  selecting  the  participants  will  be  prepared  by  the\nPMO and submitted to ADB during inception.\n\n3.\n\nDisbursements, Reports, Accounts, and Auditing\n\nTo  expedite  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  ADB\u2019s  share  of  funds  for\n63.\neligible expenditures, an imprest account (I/A) for the Project will be established in the Central\nBank  of  Sri  Lanka  in  Colombo.  The  I/A  will  be  operated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook  dated  June  1996  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the\nGovernment and ADB. The initial deposit to the I/A will not exceed the equivalent of $2.0 million.\nStatement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement\nHandbook will be used for claiming replenishment and liquidating expenditures paid out of the\nI/A and for reimbursing expenditures under contracts not exceeding $100,000. The I/A and SOE\nprocedures  will  be  audited  as  part  of  the  regular  audit  of  the  Project\u2019s  account  and  financial\nstatements, and audit opinion on the I/A and SOE should be set out separately.\n\n64.\nThe Government, acting through MEHE, will maintain records and accounts adequate to\nidentify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan.  These  procedures  will  be\nreviewed thoroughly during the Inception Mission. MEHE will maintain separate accounts for the\nProject and ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually in accordance\nwith sound accounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited\naccounts  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  12  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  The\nPMO will prepare quarterly reports on Project implementation and submit them to ADB within 30\ndays of each quarter. The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and will indicate, among\nother  things,  (i)  progress  against  established  targets;  (ii)  status  of  performance  indicators;  (iii)\nproblems  encountered  during  the  quarter,  and  steps  taken  to  resolve  the  problems;  (iv)\ncompliance with loan covenants; and (v) program activities proposed for the following quarter.\nThe PMO will also prepare a project completion report and submit it to ADB not later than three\nmonths following the physical completion of the Project.\n\n4.\n\nProject Performance\n\na. \n\nAnnual Operational Plans\n\n65.\nBy  December  of  each  year  of  project  implementation,  MEHE  will  provide  ADB  with  an\nannual operation plan for the following fiscal year.  The plan will include (i) data on the proposed\nallocations  to  secondary  education  including  certification  that  the  Government  has  allocated\nadequate  resources;  (ii)  status  of  agreed-upon  policy  reforms  and  covenants;  (iii)  fully  costed\nproposed  project  activities  for  each  subcomponent,  with  performance  targets;  and  (iv)  a  list  of\nsecondary schools targeted for upgrading during the year and for establishment of multimedia\nrooms  and  CLCs.  The  plan  will  also  provide  estimates  of  the  O&M  budget  and  ensure  that\nadequate counterpart funds are provided.\n\n\f22\n\nb. \n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n66.\nAn  adequately  developed  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  will  be  installed  in  MEHE\nand  accessed  through  PMO  to  evaluate  beneficiaries,  improve  management  information,  and\nassess  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  improvement  of  secondary  schooling.    Monitoring  will\ninclude  accurate  indicators  of  school  enrollments,  teacher  deployment,  examination  results\nincluding  SBA,  implementation  and  impact  status  of  school  management  councils  and  SBM,\ntraining  of  principals  and  teachers  in  secondary  schools  for  career  guidance,  and  teacher\nsupervision of computer laboratories and multimedia rooms. A baseline for project inputs for the\n800  project  schools  will  be  prepared  at  the  time  of  school  selection.  MEHE  will  monitor  and\nevaluate the benefits of the Project after completion in accordance with the schedule and terms\nof reference to be agreed upon by the Government and ADB (Appendix 9).\n\n67.\nTo  supplement  continuous  routine  monitoring  and  supervision,  ADB  will  conduct  an\nannual review of Project performance during each Review Mission.  The review will include an\nexamination  of  the  budgetary  allocations,  O&M  costs,  staffing  and  other  incremental\nrequirement costs, implementation arrangements, and achievements under the Project.\n\n68.\nA  midterm  review  (MTR)  will  be  carried  out  jointly  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and  NDF\nduring  the  third  year  of  implementation  and  will  focus  on  the  accomplishment  of  the  project\nobjectives, policy, scope, and direction of project impact as indicated by monitoring indicators.\n\n5.\n\nSelection Criteria for Targeted Interventions\n\nA final list of 1,120 secondary schools was identified, in consultation with the provincial\n\n69.\neducation offices, to fit the criteria for CLCs:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\navailable full size classroom for conversion,\navailable full-time teacher to manage the computer laboratory,\nagreement to include computer technology program as an A level subject, and\navailable assured supply of electricity and a security watchman.\n\nThe  list  of  project  schools  is  fixed  and  changes  may  be  made  only  by  MEHE  with  the\n70.\napproval of ADB. Before each school on the list is allowed to participate in the Project, school\nprincipals, district zonal officers, and SDS representatives will be asked to develop a proposal\nhighlighting the school\u2019s need for a computer and multimedia center to improve learning.  The\nproposal will help ensure school ownership through the SBM. The PMO has already prepared\nand translated a questionnaire (Appendix 10), and piloted it in 105 schools. The PMO will review\nthe  proposals  and  prepare  200-300  secondary  schools  annually  to  establish  computer\nlaboratories and multimedia rooms. The first 200 schools are expected to be approved and civil\nworks  and  installation  of  equipment  completed  by  the  end  of  the  first  year  of  project\nimplementation.\n\n71.\nAbout  100  secondary  schools  in  divisions  with  no  full-curriculum  schools  will  be\nupgraded to include grades 12-13 science courses. These schools will require provision of one\nschool  laboratory  for  biology  and  chemistry,  and  one  for  physics.  The  schools  have  already\nbeen  tentatively  selected  in  the  project  formulation  process  and  the  provincial  authorizes  will\nhave  to  guarantee  both  available  enrollments  and  teachers  before  the  PMO  contracts  for  civil\nworks or procurement. These 100 schools are a subset of the 800 schools chosen for CLCs and\nmultimedia rooms. The criteria for selection for upgrading follow:\n\n\f23\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\nexisting full-curriculum school outside the administrative division of the school in\nquestion,  except  in  the  case  of  other  schools  in  the  division  that  are  already\nsaturated;\navailable science teachers redeployed to school; and\na minimum of 15 students for each additional science section in the first year of\noperation.\n\n72.\nThe  Government  has  provided  academic  scholarships  based  on  merit  for  a  long  time\nand the program has remained popular. Under the Project, stipends will be provided to grades\n10-13 students who qualify both academically and financially. The stipends will cover transport,\ntutoring, and other fees related to student transfers to nearby schools providing a wider choice\nof subjects. The stipends will serve as a one-time intervention under the Project to boost access\nfor poor students, but if evaluation of the program finds it successful, recommendations will be\nmade to continue it. The stipends will be administered through block grants to recipient schools,\nwhich will set aside a few places and identify students based on the following criteria:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\nMeans test indicates the family of student is below the poverty line;\nStudent is academically qualified; and\nThe  available  school  is  within  the  administrative  division  or  the  immediate\nneighboring division.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental\n\n73.\nEnvironmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no  significant  adverse  environmental\nimpacts were identified. MEHE will ensure that the location, design, construction, and operation\nof  the  science  laboratories  to  be  established  under  the  Project  follow  ADB\u2019s  Environmental\nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The Project will involve no resettlement or land\nacquisition.  The  design  and  location  of  classroom  rehabilitation  will  consider  measures  to\nmaximize the use of natural light, air flow, heat dispersion and water availability; and to minimize\nmaintenance  costs.  The  PMO  may  employ  consultant  architects  and  engineers  to  review  the\nschool  designs  to  improve  their  quality  and  to  allow  better  space  utilization.  The  curriculum\ncontent  of  science  and  technology  courses  in  grades  12-13  have  been  adapted  to  include\nenvironmental  studies  and  experiments  testing  for  air  and  water  pollution.  The  grades  12-13\nbiology and chemistry program also includes developing up to 30 secondary schools adjacent to\nforest preserves to serve as nature centers for school on-site field studies for students to learn\nabout conservation of natural resources, pollution control, and sustainable nature reserves.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n74.\nSocial assessments under the technical assistance (TA) and information gathered from\ninterviews  and  analyses  under  SEDP  and  during  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  field  visits  indicate\nthat  females  are  well  represented  in  the  school  system.  About  60  percent  are  in  secondary\nschools  and  their  pass  rate  in  national  examinations  is  higher  than  that  of  boys.  About  65\npercent  of  secondary  schoolteachers  are  female.  Females  often  find  it  difficult  to  relocate  to\nremote  schools,  thus  contributing  to  the  shortage  of  qualified  teachers  available  for\nredeployment to rural areas.\n\n75.\nSchools in Sri Lanka cater to clearly defined ethnic and cultural clientele within a given\ngeographic area. In rural areas, poverty is severe especially in the hill plantation regions in the\n\n\f24\n\ncenter  of  the  country  where  many  families  do  not  own  land,  and  poverty  is  widespread.  The\nprovinces suffering from greatest poverty as measured by the United Nation\u2019s Human Poverty\nIndex, include Eastern, Central, Uva, and Sabaragamuwa. Deprivation is measured in terms of\nlack of access to electricity, potable water, health care, and good schools. Government surveys\nsuggest that families residing in poor areas prefer to migrate to towns and urban centers once\nthey attain marketable skills. Because education is near universal for students up to age 15 or\n16,  the  poor  still  attend  school  but  are  in  danger  of  dropping  out  when  they  do  poorly  on  the\ngrade  11  national  examination.    Monitoring  the  number  of  additional  students  passing  the\nnational examinations at age 16 and 18 will indicate the Project\u2019s effectiveness and demonstrate\nhow  changes  in  the  pass  rates  affect  individual  earnings  and  reduce  poverty.  Measures  of\nstipend program success can also provide information on poverty reduction.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n76.\nSri  Lanka  has  done  well  in  keeping  students  in  school  through  grade  11,  but  not  in\nensuring that they learn well or learn relevant materials.  Consequently, the quality of education\nhas suffered and put youth at risk of being unemployable in the modern economy.  As the global\nand  national  economy  improve,  the  demand  for  educated  employment  will  increase  and\nstudents  will  have  more  and  more  opportunities  for  modern  employment  in  the  private  sector\nonly  if  they  can  communicate  well,  and  possess  quantitative  and  analytical  reasoning  skills  to\nsolve problems posed in the modern workplace. As the country must compete more efficiently in\nthe regional and global economy, the youth need education geared to improving language skills,\ncomputer  skills  and  science  and  mathematical  skills  needed  to  expand  opportunities  and\nmobility. Higher pass rates on national examinations can help certify to the quality of what was\nlearned in school.\n\n77.\n  The  major  benefit  arising  from  the  Project  is  the  additional  students  who  successfully\ncomplete grades 11 and 13 examinations. Success will lead to higher income and perhaps an\nopportunity  to  continue  their  education.  Increased  earnings  in  a  competitive  labor  market  are\ntaken  as  a  proxy  for  the  incremental  social  benefit  in  the  economic  analysis.  The  incremental\nincome received by a successful grade 13 examination candidate is the value to the economy of\nthe successful candidate whether or not the candidate continues schooling. It is estimated that\n225,000 students or about two in every three students fail to qualify to enter grade 12 annually\nand are prevented from continuing their formal education. To meet the educational requirements\nof  the  modern  economy,  the  education  system  will  have  to  improve  internal  efficiency  by\nincreasing the number of grade 11 successful examinees by 500,000 over a period of 12 years\n(100,000  in  the  first  four  years  of  the  Project  and  400,000  in  the  following  eight  years).  As\nstandards  cannot  be  lowered  without  jeopardizing  the  credibility  of  the  examination  system,\nincreases  in  percentages  qualifying  to  enter  grade  12  will  have  to  come  from  improved  test\nscores  as  a  result  of  improved  classroom  learning  due  to  better  teacher  pedagogy,  improved\nlearning materials and activities, and continuous student assessment.\n\n78.\nThe economic analysis is found in Appendix 11. For the base case, the rate of return is\n16 percent. The major assumptions are provided in Table A11.1. The analysis is sensitive to the\npercentage of students qualifying to enter grade 12 because the cost remains unchanged, while\nthe  benefit  from  incremental  earnings  either  falls  or  increases  with  the  pass  rates.  The  high\nsensitivity to the pass rate means that the project management must pay very close attention to\nefforts  to  improve  the  quality  of  instruction  so  that  the  anticipated  pass  rates  are  achieved.\n\n\f25\n\nImproved  quality  inputs  to  academic  learning,  along  with  SBA  weighted  in  the  national\nexamination appear to be sufficient to boost the pass rates to meet the project targets. The rate\nof return is not sensitive to small changes in assumptions on earnings or incremental changes in\nproject costs.\n\nimprovements. \n\n79.\nThe  Project  is  easily  sustainable.  Improvements  in  internal  efficiency  of  the  secondary\nschool  system  pay  large  dividends  to  the  many  who  will  pass  the  grades  11  and  13\nexaminations  as  a  result  of  quality \n  The  Project  emphasizes  quality\nimprovements.  Reductions in dropout and repetition will eliminate wastage.  The Project will not\nbuild  new  facilities  but  will  upgrade  existing  facilities,  which  will  reduce  O&M  costs.  After  the\nimplementation period, the recurrent costs of the Project including full funding of the incremental\nstipends  in  the  Project  will  amount  to  SLRs167.4  million  ($2.2  million).  In  contrast,  the  total\nGovernment expenditure on education in 1998 was about SLRs26,500 million ($363 million), of\nwhich recurrent expenditure totaled about SLRs20,500 ($280 million). The recurrent cost of the\nProject  including  new  staff  for  NETS  and  full-curriculum  schools  stipends  amount  to  only  0.6\npercent of the total Government recurrent expenditure on education. As the stipend program is\nunlikely to continue after the Project, the recurrent cost of the Project slips to 0.3 percent of the\ntotal Government recurrent expenditure on education. If recurrent costs of secondary education\nalone are used as a base comparison, then the recurrent cost of the Project excluding stipends\nrises again to 0.6 percent of the secondary school recurrent budget.\n\n80.\nCost  recovery  for  the  CLCs  is  seen  as  the  major  means  to  reduce  the  incremental\nrecurrent  cost  after  project  completion.  The  CLCs  will  require  about  $1.0  million,  or  about\n$1,250  for  each  of  the  800  CLCs,  to  operate  each  year.  Calculations  were  made  to  charge\nSLRs1,000 ($14) annually to students for after-school programs to cover the costs of electricity\nand  teacher  salary.  In  school,  students  will  pay  a  facility  fee  of  about  SLRs75  ($1.00)  per\nacademic year. Fees are sufficient to cover O&M of CLCs, given the numbers expected to use\nthe  laboratories  after  school,  along  with  the  number  of  in-school  grades  12-13  students  using\nCLCs.  Each  CLC  can  operate  1,250  hours  per  year  at  a  unit  cost  of  $1.00  per  hour,  which\nrepresents  a  reasonable  unit  cost  for  the  given  educational  technology.  Outright  purchase  of\ncomputers  as  opposed  to  leasing  is  most  cost-effective  as  computers  for  school  use  can  be\nutilized up to eight years before replacement, and school ownership of computers represents an\nasset for the community.\n\n1.\n\nBeneficiaries\n\nUp  to  one  million  students  attending  grades  10-13  each  year  will  benefit  from  the\n81.\nprogram  over  the  five-year  project  period  and  the  subsequent  five-year  period  after  project\ncompletion.  These  students  will  improve  classroom  learning  in  core  subjects  of  English,\nmathematics,  science,  and  computer  education  that  will  provide  them  marketable  skills  after\ngraduation.  The  Project  will  also  improve  equity  in  access  to  wider  curriculum  choice  by\nensuring that there are schools in every division that provide science and commerce courses for\nstudents. In poor areas, qualified students from poor families will be given stipends to support\ncosts in transferring to quality schools nearby. Up to 5,000 poor students are expected to benefit\nfrom  the program  to upgrade schools each year, improving their chances to pass the national\nexamination.  Career  education  will  provide  marketable  information  and  knowledge  about\neducation  and  work  to  students,  thereby  equalizing  access  to  information  about  jobs.  The\nProject will also provide improved tracking of students through the education system via career\nguidance, and SBA that yields close students-teacher interaction.\n\n\f26\n\nUp  to  30,000  disadvantaged  students  in  grades  11  to  13  will  benefit  from  the  stipend\n82.\nprogram  to  allow  qualified  students  in  grade  11  to  receive  tutoring  and  extra  assistance  to\nimprove  their  studies  and/or  to  transfer  to  nearby  schools  with  facilities.  The  stipends  are\nexpected to result in increased pass rates for qualified students who would otherwise not have\nthe  opportunity  to  study  in  good  schools.  A  smaller  number  of  stipends  will  be  awarded  to\nstudents  who  pass  the  grade  11  national  examination  but  lack  resources  to  attend  grades  12\nand 13. The purpose is to ensure that qualified students who cannot afford further schooling do\nnot drop out.\n\n83.\nFinally,  the  Project  will  provide  the  Government  with  resources  to  identify  options  to\nreduce  expenditures  for  secondary  education  through  public-private  participation  in  secondary\nschooling. This innovation is expected to allow some schools eventually to opt out of the public\neducation system and in so doing free up additional funds for the remaining public schools.\n\n84.\nAbout 40,000 secondary school teachers will benefit from training; about 15,000 of them\nwill receive advanced training in career guidance, computer education, and improved classroom\nteaching  methodologies  in  science  and  technology,  mathematics,  English,  and  commerce\ncourses. Training in instructional delivery will support the SBA system that requires teachers to\ngrade student academic performance on a weekly basis to supplement the national examination\nscore.    About  3,000  principals,  zonal  education  officers,  and  SDS  leaders  will  be  provided\nongoing  training  in  SBM  to  improve  their  ability  to  develop  and  monitor  the  school  academic\nenvironment.  With  the  advent  of  SBA,  computer  training,  multimedia  approaches  to  learning\nEnglish, mathematics, science, and commerce, and introduction of career guidance and stipend\nprograms to attract poor students, school administrators will have to improve their supervision of\nthese  programs.  Finally,  supervision  and  quality  assurance  staff  at  MEHE,  test  developers,\nadministrators  and  markers  at  NETS  and  in-service  teacher  trainers  at  NIE  will  be  provided\nresources to do their jobs more efficiently.\n\n2.\n\nInstitutional Benefits\n\n85.\nMEHE  will  benefit  from  the  Project  through  support  for  its  restructuring  already  under\nway. The Quality Assurance Division that includes support for supervision from the province to\nthe  zonal  levels  and  into  schools  will  be  given  training  and  resources  to  strengthen  ongoing\nsupervision.  The  division  will  be  strengthened  with  the  addition  of  a  quality  assurance  unit  to\ndevelop and implement a SBM system that links zonal education offices with principals and the\ncommunity.  SBM  is  intended  to  provide  a  degree  of  decentralization  to  secondary  schools  so\nthat  management  decisions  for  day-to-day  school  operations  can  be  made  in  the  field.  As\nschool  enrollments  decline,  surplus  secondary  school  teachers  will  be  reassigned  to  do\nguidance  and  counseling  and  handle  computer  education.  Other  teachers  will  improve  their\npedagogical skills to ensure that they do not become obsolete.\n\n86.\nNETS  is  undergoing  institutional  reform  to  move  toward  an  examination  system  that\nprovides  useful  feedback  in  a  timely  manner  to  all  students,  regardless  of  whether  they  will\ncontinue  education  or  enter  the  workforce.  A  reliable  and  legitimate  national  testing  system  is\nthe  basis  of  public  confidence  in  the  education  system  and  therefore  has  to  be  strengthened.\nThe use of SBA carried out in schools throughout the year will give importance to student effort.\nAdministrative efficiency in examination reform will reduce time wasted waiting for examination\nresults  and  subsequent  placement  by  up  to  six  months.  This  has  economic  consequences  as\nstudents do not have to wait around before continuing their classes. NETS will benefit from the\nProject  as  the  expanded  staff  are  trained  and  operations  are  improved  to  provide  greater\nefficiency and autonomy to the institution.\n\n\f27\n\n87.\nNIE  will  benefit  from  the  Project  as  in-service  training  related  to  curriculum  subjects  is\nintensified  and  resources  are  provided  to  improve  the  application  of  theory  to  practice  in  the\nclassroom.  The  introduction  of  computer  education  in  secondary  schools  will  require  follow-up\ntraining  of  teachers  in  software  and  pedagogy.  NIE  will  build  its  capacity  to  service  computer\neducation and provide software on a regular basis.\n\n88.\nAll  secondary  schools  nationwide  will  benefit  from  improvements  to  the  curriculum  and\nteaching, examination reform, and SBM. Over 800 of the 2,300 schools will benefit from specific\ninterventions  in  the  application  of  computer  centers  and  stipend  programs,  while  an  additional\n100 schools will benefit from upgrading the curriculum to include science subjects.\n\n3.\n\nEfficiency Benefits\n\n89.\nThe efficiency of the secondary education system will improve as a result of the Project.\nImproved  test  administration  will  lead  to  faster  turnaround  in  disseminating  test  results  and\nplacement, reducing the time by six months for grade 11 examinees and by 12 months for grade\n13 examinees.  The introduction of SBA will make assessment fairer as classroom performance\nwill  count  toward  the  national  examination.  Another  social  justification  besides  improved\nacademic  test  performance  is  the  value  of  useful  computer  and  language  skills  to  give\nsecondary  school  graduates  access  to  knowledge  and  information.  This  will  help  narrow  the\ndigital  divide  between  communities.  Career  guidance  programs  will  also  provide  students  with\ninformation  leading  to  greater  education  and  occupation  opportunities.  Equity  programs  that\nallow  students  greater  choice  and  mobility  in  attending  schools  are  also  seen  as  promoting\nsystem  flexibility  to  allow  greater  access  to  improved  schooling.  Finally,  improved  school\nadministration  especially  in  school  supervision  and  SBM  is  expected  to  increase  local\nadministrative efficiency, which is essential to a modern school system.\n\nThe  increase  in  learning  as  a  result  of  quality  inputs  and  improved  access  to  full-\n90.\ncurriculum  schools  by  the  poor  is  expected  to  increase  the  number  of  students  qualifying  to\nenter grade 12 by 50,000 each year over a base pass rate of 125,000. The increase is about 40\npercent  per  year  by  project  completion.  This  measure  can  serve  as  an  indicator  of  system\nefficiency due to the Project. The increase in the number of students qualifying to enter grade\n12 can be absorbed into grades 12-13 without much effort because the current teacher/student\nratio in grades 12-13 is only 1:22 and can easily be adjusted up to 40 percent over five years of\nproject implementation to about 1:30. As system efficiency improves, repeaters who sit in grade\n13  will  also  decrease,  thereby  providing  greater  capacity  to  accommodate  the  expected\nincrease. Overall, system internal efficiency will improve.\n\nB.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n91.\nApproximately  21  percent  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  population  live  in  absolute  poverty.  This\npercentage has not declined appreciably over the last decade despite efforts to address equity.\nThis  lack  of  impact  may  be  due  in  part  to  earlier  efforts  that  were  not  socially  targeted  and  in\npart  to  the  civil  conflict  that  has  displaced  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  from  their  homes\nand  source  of  livelihood.  In  1998  the  Government  with  the  assistance  of  the  United  Nations\nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP)  and  the  World  Bank  undertook  an  extensive  poverty  study.\nThe  results  show  that  rural  poverty  continues  to  be  quantitatively  and  qualitatively  worse  than\nurban poverty and that people who live in poverty work in low-skill and low-paying occupations.\nIt  appears  that  while  Central,  North  Central,  Uva,  and  Sabaragamuwa  provinces  have  the\ndeepest poverty, nonetheless, all districts (21 of 25) except five in Western Province combined\n\n\f28\n\nwith  Matale  district  appear  below  the  national  average.15  Appendix  12  presents  the  general\npoverty analysis and project impact.\n\n92.\nThe economic justification for investing in poverty reduction is both long and short term.\nIn the long term, future generations will have the learning skills to compete in the labor market at\nhome  and  abroad.  The  secondary  school  system  will  be  strengthened  to  show  improved\nefficiency in test administration, administrative supervision, and SBM that promotes school and\ncommunity leadership. In the short term, the Project aims to promote greater access to quality\nsecondary  education,  and  this  is  expected  to  increase  the  number  of  students  successfully\ncompleting  the  O  level  examination  and  continuing  to  grade  12.  Streamlining  the  O  level\nexamination  process  including  bringing  forward  A  level  examinations  and  speeding  up  the\ngrading of O levels will cut the waiting period to five months between grades 11 and 12. Finally,\nSBM pays dividends to better governance as principals and parents, respectively, take greater\nresponsibility for the day-to-day teaching and learning of students. As internal rates of return to\ncompletion of O and A level learning are significantly higher than those for noncompletion, the\npotential \nthe  poor  will\ninternal  school  efficiency \ndisproportionately benefit from these improvements, given their exposure to low levels of quality\neducation. Also, the poor will benefit greatly from improved schooling that allows them mobility\nout of depressed economic areas.\n\nlarge  and \n\nimproved \n\nreturn \n\nto \n\nis \n\nC.\n\nRisks\n\n93.\nThe Project is designed to specifically help achieve the Government\u2019s secondary school\nreforms  to  improve  quality,  access  and  efficiency.  Commitment  at  the  national  level  is  strong\ndespite  the  civil  conflict  that  threatens  public  security.  However,  specific  reforms  requiring\nreorganization  of  secondary  school  administration  and  additional  principal  and  teacher  efforts\ndirected at evaluating student achievements may meet with initial resistance from teachers who\nfear  an additional workload. The introduction of SBA in grades 6-9 received a mixed reaction,\nwith  teachers  agreeing  with  the  need  but  finding  the  additional  burden  of  time  constraining.\nModifications  have  been  made  and  under  the  Project  intensive  training  and  follow-up  will  be\nprovided to ensure that teachers are prepared to undertake SBA. Once teacher assessment is\nincluded in the national examination score, parents, students, and teachers will begin to see the\nvalue of the additional assessment and this should lead to overall support. A second risk has to\ndo  with  the  move  to  greater  decentralization  at  the  provincial  and  school  level.  Greater\ndecentralization  will  require  greater  administrative  capacity.  The  Project  proposes  the\nestablishment of a secondary education unit within MEHE to provide increased coordination so\nthat  NETS  and  NIE  are  able  to  accommodate  teacher  training  and  that  PMO  can  administer\nblock grants for school stipends and involve the community in decisions to establish and support\nCLCs  in  project  schools.  As  Sri  Lanka  moves  toward  introducing  IT  and  interactive  learning,\nresource planning at the school level will be required. Under the Project, principals and teachers\nwill  be  trained,  and  SBM  will  be  strengthened  to  ensure  local  financial  support  for  these  new\ntechnologies. Service contracting by suppliers will also ensure computer maintenance.\n\n                                                \n15 ADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Emergency Rehabilitation in NE Province Social Impact Analysis Report confirms high poverty in\n\nthese districts as well.\n\n\f29\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n94.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\n(iii) \n \n\n(iv) \n \n\n(v) \n \n\n(vi) \n \n\n(vii) \n \n\n(viii) \n \n\n(ix) \n \n\nThe  Government  will  increase  the  professional  staff  of  NETS  by  at  least  32\nappointments for SBA, improving test administration efficiency, and examination\nresearch  and  development,  as  follows:  (a)  6  appointments  within  three  months\nafter \nloan\nloan  effectiveness;  (b) 4  appointments  within  one  year  after \neffectiveness; (c) 20 appointments within two years after loan effectiveness; and\n(d)  the  remaining  number  of  appointments  within  three  years  after  loan\neffectiveness.\n\nThe  Government  will  cause  the  concerned  provincial  education  department,\nschool, and SDS to monitor the use of the CLC given to each school under the\nProject,  under  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  including  (a)  levying  a  fee  for\ncomputer  usage;  (b)  depositing  the  fee  into  a  separate  account  in  the  name  of\nthe school; and (c) utilizing the funds in this account for school-related activities,\nincluding the maintenance and operation of the CLC.\n\nWithin  two  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  enact  legislation\nestablishing  NETS  as  an  autonomous  agency  under  MEHE,  responsible  for\ncarrying out school-related public examination and certification, and educational\ntesting in examinations on civil service recruitment and from outside agencies.\n\nWithin  two  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  (a)  complete  a\nstudy on cost recovery in secondary education; and (b) based on the findings of\nthe  study,  recommend  a  public-private  partnership  model  to  make  secondary\neducation competitive.\n\nWithin two years after loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure that MEHE\napproves a policy to implement career guidance for educational opportunities for\nstudents in grades 11 to 13.\n\nWithin  two  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  cause  NETS  to\nintegrate SBA in grades 10 and 11 with the O level examination certification.\n\nWithin  three  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  that\nMEHE  implements  SBM  through  a  supervision  system  in  all  secondary  schools\nfor  principals,  SDSs,  and  provincial,  district,  zonal,  and  divisional  education\nofficers.\n\nWithin  three  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  that\nMEHE offers computer education, with a focus on interactive classroom learning,\nas an elective subject in grades 12 and 13.\n\nThe Government will (a) cause the SDSs participating in the Project to contribute\nadequate  funds  to  carry  out  the  following  Project  activities:  operational\nexpenditure  for  the  multimedia  rooms  and  the  CLCs,  and  furniture  for  the\n\n\f30\n\n(x) \n \n\n(xi) \n \n\n(xii) \n \n\nmultimedia rooms; and (b) provide the necessary funds to carry out these project\nactivities  in  the  event  the  SDSs  concerned  are  not  able  to  contribute  adequate\nfunds.\n\nWithin  four  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  raise  the\ncompulsory age for education to age 16 (grade 11).\n\nWithin  four  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  cause  NETS  to\nintegrate SBA in grades 12 and 13 with the A level examination certification.\n\nWithin  four  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  (a)  the  Government  and  ADB  will\nevaluate the impact of the stipend programs on the pass rate for poor students;\nand (b) the Government will, based on the findings of the evaluation and subject\nto  availability  of  its  resources,  fund  these  stipend  programs  from  its  own\nresources after project completion.\n\nB.\n\nCondition of Loan Effectiveness\n\n95.\nThe NDF Credit Agreement between the Government and NDF will have been signed by\nthe parties and all conditions of effectiveness (other than a condition requiring the effectiveness\nof the ADB loan) will have been fulfilled, or the Government will have made other arrangements,\nsatisfactory to ADB, to fund the amount intended to be provided by the NDF Credit.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n96.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  38,071,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the\nSecondary Education Modernization Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of\n8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially\nin accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n   \n\n    Tadao Chino\n       President\n\n18 August 2000\n\n\fNumber Title\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n31\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nProject Framework\n\nExternal Assistance to the Education Sector\n\nProject Management Structure and Design Summary\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nProcurement of Equipment and Packages\n\nRequirements and Outline Terms of Reference for\nConsultants\n\nStaff Development\n\nIndicative Project Monitoring Indicators\n\nSchool Selection Criteria and Questionnaire\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nNational Poverty Analysis and Project Impact\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\nDetailed List of Project Schools\n\nScience Equipment Lists\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\n32\n\n38\n\n39\n\n43\n\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\n58\n\n59\n\n60\n\n68\n\n73\n\n1, 2\n\n8, 22\n\n13, 41\n\n17, 53\n\n19, 57\n\n19, 58\n\n20, 61\n\n20, 62\n\n22, 66\n\n22, 70\n\n24, 78\n\n28, 91\n\nGovernment Project Completion Report (Secondary Education Development Project)\n\nInitial Social Assessment Including Examination Pass Rates per Province\n\n      E\n\nTabular Basis of the Economic Analysis of Project Benefits\n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\n\nPerformance\nMeasures\n\nMonitoring\nMechanisms\n\nAssumptions/Risks\n\nI.

The  Project  will  provide\nconsultants to develop materials and activities for key subject areas that will allow students to\nbe  graded  by  teachers,  with  coursework  used  for  national  evaluation  at  the  end  of  grades  11\nand 13. Grade 11 materials will include learning activities in English and mathematics. Learning\nactivities for grade 13 will include special laboratory and computer activities in science, English,\nmathematics, and commerce. Grade 13 will include textbooks, as these are not used in grades\n12-13.  Multimedia  rooms  will  be  established  by  renovating  existing  classrooms  and  providing\nthem  with  electricity,  security,  and  furniture  for  teachers  to  use  multimedia  materials  such  as\ntelevision, video, and audio cassettes to practice language instruction, commerce, mathematics,\nand  career  guidance.  Policies  enacted  include  making  career  guidance  and  school-based\nassessment (SBA) mandatory in secondary education.\n\n4.\nComputer  Learning  Centers  (CLCs).  CLCs  are  a  major  innovation  to  introduce\ncomputer  literacy  including  information  technology  (IT)  and  interactive  instruction  using\ncomputers. Existing classrooms will be converted to CLCs and provided with security bars and\ndoor,  electric  wiring,  carpeting,  air  conditioning  and  furniture.  The  laboratory  have  15-25\ncomputers with compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM) depending on the size of the school,\nwith  two  students  sharing  a  computer.  There  will  be  one  central  computer  and  two  printers.\nCapacity for networking computers and the Internet will be included but not installed initially until\nthe CLCs are fully functioning and sustainable. Software (in English) will include windows and\nseveral  spread-sheets  along  with  an  array  of  computer  software  educational  games  and\nreference materials in the key subjects. A full-time professional staff will be assigned to manage\nthe  laboratory  and  one  or  more  grade  13  students  waiting  for  examination  results  will  be\nemployed on a volunteer basis to assist in day-to-day operational management. A fee of SLRs7\nper month will be levied for each student using the facilities. After-school use of computers for IT\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 3, page 4\n\nwill be allowed for a fee of SLRs500 per month. Proceeds will be used to pay for electricity and\nmaintenance  of  equipment  and  materials.  Policies  being  considered  include  making  computer\ncourses mandatory for grades 12-13 students.\n\nStipend Program.   The Project includes stipends of up to SLRs10,000 for grades 10-11\n5.\nand  13,000  for  grades  12-13  per  year  for  tuition,  fees,  transport,  books  and  lodging  (in\nexceptional cases). Funds for stipends will be administered by schools under the supervision of\nthe  principal  and  awarded  to  disadvantaged  students  based  on  economic  means  testing  and\nacademic  ability.  Means  testing  will  be  based  on  minimum  family  income  determined  by  the\nproject steering committee. Preference will be given to students in grades 10-11 with excellent\nattendance  and  scholarship  in  grade  9.  The  stipend  program  will  also  accommodate  students\nwho pass the grade 11 national examination but are in danger of not continuing grade 12 due to\nfinancial reasons. Students in newly established full-curriculum schools and in limited-curriculum\nschools  will  be  given  priority  over  students  in  existing  full-curriculum  schools.    Among  the\npolicies  to  be  proposed  will  be  enactment  of  special  stipend  programs  for  disadvantaged\nstudents  in  danger  of  dropping  out  of  school  after  successfully  completing  the  O  level\nexamination.\n\n6.\nPublic-Private Partnerships.  The concept is new in Sri Lanka and studies to support a\npolicy framework is needed to estimate savings from prospective schools that plan to opt out of\nthe  present  system.  A  second  study  phase  would  review  the  findings  of  the  government\nrecommendations  and  plan  pilot  programs  to  initiate  interventions.  Policies  being  considered\ninclude the allowing public-private partnerships in secondary education.\n\nQuality  Assurance.    Within  MEHE  a  unit  to  monitor  quality  assessment  especially\n7.\nthrough a SBM system will be established. This unit will be within the MEHE hierarchy but will\nhave specific mandate to implement SBM and to strengthen the national, provincial, and local\nchain of command through training and programs to give more day-to-day operational authority\nto local school principals, SDSs, and zonal education offices. Policies being considered include\nMEHE  restructuring  to  include  a  quality  assurance  unit  and  support  for  giving  operational\nauthority to school principals, zonal education officers, and SDSs.\n\nNational  Evaluation  Testing  Service  Restructuring.  For  NETS  to  carry  out  its\n8.\nassigned  tasks  of  SBA  and  examination  reform,  new  staff  and  resources  are  required  to\nstrengthen its day-to-day operations and management.  Policies enacted include revision of the\nAct establishing NETS to make it autonomous and to bolster professionalization of the staff.\n\n9.\nSurveys  and  Studies.    The  PMO  will  undertake  several  surveys  to  monitor  and\nevaluate programs introduced under the Project. These include career guidance, and SBA and\nSBM  training.    The  PMO  will  also  undertake  several  studies  to  determine  the  best  role  for\npublic-private partnerships and to evaluate stipend programs and upgraded school programs.\n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'000)\n\nADB Financing\nLocal \nCurrency\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nNDF Financing\n\nGovernment Financing\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nTotal\nCurrency Cost\n\nTotal Cost\nLocal \n\nItem\n\nA.

Of these, about 2,300 offer grades 10-13. About 600 of these secondary schools offer\ncourses in all subjects (science, arts and commerce) and are called full-curriculum schools. The\nremaining 1,700 schools offer academic courses in either arts and/or commerce. The 600 full-\ncurriculum  schools  and  the  700  largest  of  the  other  schools  accommodate  all  grades  12-13\nstudents and 65 percent of the grades 10-11 students. Under the Project, about 500 of the full-\ncurriculum  schools  and  600  of  the  larger  remaining  secondary  schools  were  selected.  A  final\nselection of 800 of these 1,100 schools will be provided resources under the Project while the\nremaining  300  will  be  provided  computer  learning  centers  (CLCs)  from  other  aid  agencies.\nBetween  them,  they  cover  90  percent  of  the  students  in  grades  12-13  and  70  percent  of  the\nstudents in grades 10-11. The remaining 10 percent of students in grades 12-13 are enrolled in\nwell-off  schools  near  Colombo  and  the  large  provincial  capitals,  and  the  30  percent  of  grades\n10-11  students  are  in  small  schools.  All  secondary  schools  will  benefit  from  the  policies,  and\ninstructional programs introduced under the Project.\n\n2.\nWhile  all  schools  will  receive  general  support  to  strengthen  secondary  education,  the\nschools  selected  under  the  Project  will  receive  support  for  computer  laboratories,  multimedia\nrooms, and a school grant for stipends. The schools were selected according to a set of criteria\nthat ensured that within each administrative division, there is a balance of gender, linguistic, and\ncultural representation. Schools were selected on the basis of:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n(vii)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\ngrades 10-13 enrollment of over 500,\naverage academic performance of school above 50th percentile,\navailable assured supply of electricity and water,\nadequate number of teachers,\navailable  full-size  classrooms  for  conversion  to  computer  laboratory  and\nmultipurpose room,\nprincipal and community agreement to fully utilize the laboratory, and\nopen enrollment policy to allow for transfers.\n\n3.\n\nA subset of about 100 schools will be upgraded to full-curriculum:\n\nthere are existing full-curriculum schools outside the administrative division of the\nschool  in  question,  except  in  cases  where  other  schools  in  the  division  are\nalready overcrowded;\navailable science teacher will be redeployed to the school; and\nthere will be a minimum of 15 students for each additional science section (e.g.,\nphysics/mathematics and biology/chemistry) in the first year of operation.\n\n4.\nStipends will be provided to these schools to accept transfer students. The funds will be\nin  block  grants  and  administered  by  the  school  for  after-school  tutoring,  books,  and  transport\nwhen required. Students in grade 10 may apply for a stipend for use in grade 11 as a means to\ncomplete  grade  11  and  pass  the  national  examination.  Stipends  will  also  be  awarded  to\nsuccessful  candidates  of  the  grade  11  national  examination  who  will  not  be  able  to  go  on  to\ngrades 12-13 without the stipend.  Each candidate applying for a stipend will be evaluated on\nthese criteria:\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\nmeans test indicates family wealth below the poverty line;\nstudent is academically qualified; and\navailable  quality  school  is  within  the  administrative  division  or  the  immediate\nneighboring division.\n\nB.\n\nDraft Letter to Schools Identified for Assistance (English Version)\n\nDate\n\nPrincipal\nSchool\nSchool Address\n\nDear __________________:\n\nSubject:  Loan No. ____-SRI: Secondary Education Modernization Project\n- Questionnaire to Obtain Further Data About Schools Identified for Assistance\n\nThe  above  Asian  Development  Bank \n\nfor\nimplementation  beginning  year  2001  has  the  aim  of  improving  secondary  education  in  grades\n10-11 and 12-13.

Computer  and\nEnglish  education,  improvement  of  Testing  and  Evaluation,  and  through  provision  of  Career\nGuidance.    One  of  the  aims  of  the  Project  is  improvement  of  the  economic  status  of  the\ncountry  through  better  secondary  education  at  grades  10/11  and  12/13  levels.    The  Project\nalso  has  a  poverty  alleviation  focus  and  the  selection  of  schools  for  assistance  kept  this\nconcern  in  view.

The base case (paras. 4-7) has an economic rate of return of 16 percent.  The Project\nwill  impact  the  economy  in  several  ways  -  in  addition  to  the  standard  internal  rate  of  return\ncalculations \u2014 due to the increased number of students passing the grades 11 and 13 national\nexaminations and their added value to the economy due to their improved computer, language,\nscience, and mathematics background.\n\n2.\nSchool-based  assessment  (SBA)  and  examination  reform  will  give  parents,  teachers,\nand students feedback on student academic abilities and allow the students to make informed\nchoices for future educational and occupational decisions.  The examination reform will lead to\nimproved efficiency in test administration and reporting. The waiting period between grades 11\nand 12 will be reduced by six months (from nine months) will reduced from leaving only three\nmonths waiting time, which is similar to an extended end-of-year school vacation.  School-based\nmanagement offers an invaluable contribution to increasing system efficiency, especially at the\nschool level where principals will have greater discretionary powers and the school development\nsociety will be empowered to raise funds and charge fees for school services.  Added to this are\nthe potential savings by allowing public-private partnerships in efficient secondary schools that\nwould like to charge fees in exchange for giving up state subsidies.  About 40 schools at present\nwould  favor  opting  out  of  the  public  education  system  if  permitted.  The  expenditure  regime  of\nthese  40  schools  needs  to  be  analyzed  and  compared  with  the  current  costs  provided  by  the\nGovernment.    Private  partnerships  will  play  an  increasing  role  in  the  future  education  system\nand  information  is  needed  on  the  options  available  to  schools.    Finally,  the  targeting  of\nscholarship  stipends  to  disadvantaged  students  can  be  monitored  and  the  impact  of  the\nintervention costs compared with the number of these students successfully passing the grades\n11 and 13 national examinations and receiving income benefits and further education.\n\nA.\n\nEconomic Return to Investment in Secondary Education\n\n3.\nThe major benefit arising from the Project is enabling additional students (many poor) to\nsuccessfully complete grades 11 and 13 examinations.1  This, in turn, will lead to higher income\nand  perhaps  an  opportunity  to  continue  their  education.    The  incremental  earning  in  a\ncompetitive labor market is taken as a proxy for the incremental social benefit in the economic\nanalysis. The Project was analyzed to determine the economic rate of return. For the base case,\nthe rate is 16 percent.  The major assumptions are given in Table A11.1.\n\n                                                \n1  Due to social targeting of stipends and school upgrading in progress, it is estimated that the pass rate of students in\nlow-performing  schools  will  increase  from  an  average  of  25  percent  in  1999  to  45  percent  in  2005,  and  that  of\nstudents in high-performing schools from 50 to 60 percent in the same period.\n\n\f69\n\nTable A11.1: Base Case Basic Data\n\n \n\nExchange Rate\nStandard Conversion Factor\nWage of laborer with no schoolinga\nWage of laborer with upper secondary educationa\nWage of employed O/L workera\nWage of employed A/L workera\nGrade 11 completely successful exam pass rate\nImplementation year 1 (and without Project)\nImplementation year 5 and thereafter\n\nGrade 11 pass rate for all but one subject\n\n \n\nImplementation year 1 (and without Project)\nImplementation year 5 and thereafter\n\nGrade 13 exam pass rate\nImplementation year 1 (and without Project)\nImplementation year 5 and thereafter\nNumber of students sitting in O/L exams\nAverage lag before employment\nDropout rate for grades 12 and 13 combined\nDirect cost of A/L candidateb\nCareer length of a successful O/L candidate\nwho does not continue education (60-17)\nCareer length of an A/L candidate (60-19)\n\nAppendix 11, page 2 \n\n           $1 = SLRs73.00\n      0.85\n                 SLRs59,579\n     SLRs77,591\n   SLRs105,894\n   SLRs140,987\n\n    \n\n    37.7%\n    50.0%\n\n    13.0%\n    17.2%\n\n    48.0%\n    60.0%\n 350,000\n    1 year\n         5%\n        SLRs7,380\n\n43 years\n41 years\n\nA/L = A level examination (grade 13), O/L = O level examination (grade 11).\na Derived  from  research  conducted  by  Dr.  Harsha  Aturupane  of  the  World  Bank  office  in  Colombo,  using  data\ncollected by the Households Income and Expenditure Survey, 1995/96, conducted by the Department of Census\nand Statistics and reported in Ministry of Finance and Planning, 1999.

After that, it is assumed additional investment in the secondary school system will\nbe  needed  to  maintain  the  number  of  successful  candidates.  For  each  cohort  from\nimplementation year 1 through implementation year 12, the incremental income earned by the\nincremental successful candidates is taken for the entire working life \u2013 that is, for example, an\nincremental  A/L  candidate  is  assumed  to  earn  incremental  income  for  a  period  of  41  years.\nNeither widening nor narrowing of the income differential is assumed in the base case. It will be\nnoted  that  the  incremental  income  received  by  a  successful  A/L  candidate  is  the  value  of  the\nsuccessful candidate to the economy whether or not the candidate goes for further education.\n\n5.\nThe wage data by education level is taken from the Household Income and Expenditure\nSurvey  1995/96  conducted  by  the  Department  of  Census  and  Statistics.    The  amounts  have\nbeen brought to 1999 level using the consumer price index as reported by the Central bank of\nSri Lanka.\n\nB.\n\nSensitivity Tests\n\n6.\nThe base case of the economic analysis was subjected to sensitivity tests for pass rate,\nreduced  income  differentials,  unemployment  and  increased  equipment  expenditure  (most  for\nadditional computers). The Project is sensitive to the pass rate (Table A11.2).  If the pass rate\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 11, page 3 \n\nfor  O/L  candidates  increases  from  37.7  percent  in  implementation  year  1  to  45  percent  in\nimplementation year 5, instead of the 50 percent assumed in the base case, and the pass rate\nfor  A/L  candidates  increases  from  48  to  55  percent  in  implementation  year  instead  of  the  60\npercent  assumed  in  the  base  case,  the  rate  of  return  drops  from  the  base  case  level  of  16\npercent  to  11  percent.    (The  change  in  the  pass  rates  for  the  candidates  passing  all  but  one\nsubject is assumed to be proportional to that for the completely successful candidates.)\n\n           \n\nSensitivity Test\n\nTable A11.2: Sensitivity Analysis\n\n      \n\nResulting Economic\n      Rate of Return\n     (%)\n\nBase case\nReduce O/L pass rate from 50% to 45 % and A/L pass rate from 60% to 55%\nIncrease O/L pass rate from 50% to 55% and A/L pass rate from 60 to 65%\nReduce income differentials by 10% between worker with upper secondary\n  \n     education and O/L worker and between O/L worker and A/L worker\nAssume 10% unemployment among O/L and A/L workers \nIncrease equipment expenditures (mainly computers) by 10%\n\n      16\n      11\n      22\n\n      15\n      15\n      15\n\nA/L = A level examination (grade 13), O/L = O level examination (grade 11).\n\n7.\nIn contrast, if the Project succeeds in increasing the O/L pass rate to 55 percent instead\nof 50 percent and the A/L to 65 percent instead of 60 percent, the economic rate of return rises\nto 22 percent.  The reason for this marked sensitivity is simply that the cost remains unchanged\nwhile  the  benefit  arising  from  the  incremental  earnings  either  falls  or  increases.    This  high\nsensitivity to the pass rate means that project management should pay very close attention to\nefforts to increase the quality of instruction supported by the Project so that the anticipated pass\nrates  are,  in  fact,  achieved.  The  added  inputs  to  academic  learning  along  with  SBA  counted\ntoward the national examination should be sufficient to raise pass rates to the projected levels\nby project completion.\n\n8.\nMany in Sri Lanka are of the view that if there is a substantial increase in successful O/L\nand A/L candidates, the incremental income arising from the additional educational attainment\nwill be reduced.  The Project economic justification was tested to determine its sensitivity to an\nassumed 10 percent narrowing in the differential income between the wage of a worker with an\nupper secondary education and a successful O/L candidate and a similar 10 percent narrowing\nfor the successful A/L candidate over the O/L worker. With this narrowing of the differentials, the\neconomic rate of return falls from the base case of 16 percent to 15 percent, indicating relatively\ninsensitivity.  The  reason  is  that  narrowing  the  income  differential  also  reduces  the  opportunity\ncost  of  education,  which  comes  early  in  the  Project  while  the  narrowed  differential  income\nearned by successful candidates occurs later in the project life.\n\nThe  project  analysis  assumes  a  one-year  lag  between  the  time  a  successful  O/L\n9.\ncandidate completes the examination and finds employment.  Similarly, it is assumed there is a\none-year lag between the time an A/L candidate, whether successful or unsuccessful, takes the\nexamination  and  finds  employment.    Such  delays  are  common  in  Sri  Lanka.    However,  once\nemployed, O/L and A/L workers tend to continue to be employed.  This may change in the future\nas the economy becomes increasingly market oriented.  To determine what effect this change\nmight have on the benefit derived from the Project, a sensitivity test was conducted assuming\n10 percent unemployment among O/L and A/L workers.  The effect was minimal; the economic\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 11, page 4 \n\nrate of return dropped from 16 percent to 15 percent.  This rather insensitive result is due to the\nfact that so much of the benefit stream lies far in the future.\n   \n10.\nThere is considered evidence that computer assisted learning can have a marked impact\non learning outcomes (para. 14).  That being the case, the Project was tested to determine how\nincreasing the equipment expenditure (mainly for computers) would affect the project economic\nrate of return. The Project proved insensitive to this change. Increasing equipment expenditures\nby 10 percent reduced the rate of return to only 15 percent, a negligible difference.  This implies\nthat  were  bilateral  sources  to  provide  additional  computers  and  cost  added  to  the  Project,  the\nProject would still be fully acceptable.\n\nC.\n\nProject Sustainability\n\nThe Project is easily sustainable.  After the implementation period, the recurrent costs of\n11.\nthe Project including the incremental stipends included in the Project will amount to SLRs167.4\nmillion.  In contrast, in 1998 the total government expenditure on education as reported by the\nCentral  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  was  SLRs26,694  million,  of  which  recurrent  expenditure  totaled\nSLRs20,582  million.    Although  estimates  for  the  education  budget  for  the  first  project\nimplementation  year  are  not  available,  the  total  expenditure  on  education  can  be  safely\nassumed  to  be  roughly  equivalent  to  that  in  1998.    If  so,  the  recurrent  cost  of  the  Project\nincluding  stipends  amount  to  only  six  tenths  of  1  percent  of  the  total  Government  recurrent\nexpenditure on education (Table A11.3).\n\nTable A11.3:  Sustainability of Project Expenditure\n(SLRs million)\n\nItem\nGovernment expenditure on education (1998a)\n\nProject recurrent expenditure after implementation period\n\nRecurrent\nCapital\n\nTotal        \n\nStipends\nOther recurrent\n\nTotal              \n\n  Amount\n\n     20,582\n       6,112\n    ----------\n     26,694\n\n            76\n            92\n     ---------\n          168\n\nProject recurrent expenditure as portion of total recurrent expenditure\n(1998)\n\n         0.6% \n\na  Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 1999.

Generally,  the  unit  costs  include  the  purchase,\ndevelopment,  production,  operation,  maintenance,  and  administration  of  computer\ninfrastructure;  and  hardware,  software,  courseware,  and  personnel.  For  example,  equipment\ncosts,  annualized  using  amortization  schedules,  are  added  to  recurrent  costs  to  obtain  a  total\nannual  cost.    That  is,  the  initial  investment  cost  includes  infrastructure,  hardware,  software,\nfor  maintenance,  upgrading\nInternet,  and \n\nrecurrent  cost \n\ntraining.  The \n\nteacher \n\nis \n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 11, page 5 \n\nsoftware/courseware, \nTogether they equal the total annual cost.\n\nteacher \n\ntraining,  personnel,  electricity,  and \n\nInternet  connections.\n\n13.\nThe  total  annual  cost  for  developed  countries  divided  by  the  number  of  students  using\nthe facilities ranges from about $150 to $450, a sum too high for developing countries.  The cost\nper  hour  of  student  computer  interaction  time  that  is  of  greatest  interest  is  determined  by\ndividing the total annual cost by the number of computer hours available in school.   This results\nin an hourly cost of student-computer interaction in the range of $3.00 to $5.00, too expensive\nfor developing countries.  However, certain adjustments are possible to bring down this hourly\nrate in developing countries.  Teacher salaries are, on average, one order of magnitude below\nthose in industrialized nations, building costs are less than half, life expectancy of the equipment\nshould  be  estimated  at  eight  years  (instead  of  four  years)  because  equipment  renewal  is  not\neasy  to  obtain.    It  is  also  possible  to  purchase  equipment  of  a  previous  model  from  reputable\ncomputer firms, instead of the most recent one.  From an instructional standpoint there is almost\nno difference in working with equipment with an average age of four years and one of younger\nvintage.  High school students can also be selected to assist with running the laboratories and\nthis arrangement saves on costs.\n\n14.\nAll  these  changes  reduce  the  hourly  cost  by  60  percent  to  about  $90  per  year  per\nstudent  on  average;  this  amount  corresponds  to  averages  found  for  developing  countries.\nWhile  the  rate  is  still  high  for  developing  societies,  it  can  be  further  reduced  significantly  by\nextending  laboratory  hours  to  improve  computer  contact  time  with  the  community  and  by\nallowing two students to work with one computer at a time.  When this is done by hourly rate,\ninteraction time comes down to about $0.40 per hour per student.  There is no known alternative\nsystem  that  provides  the  benefits  possible  from  integrating  computers  into  the  education\nsystem,  while  at  the  same  time  serving  the  community,  at  a  cost  of  40  cents  per  hour  of\ninteraction. If properly organized and efficiently implemented, computers in education can help\ntransform classrooms in developing countries into efficient learning environments.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nNATIONAL POVERTY ANALYSIS AND PROJECT IMPACT\n\n1.\nPoverty  in  Sri  Lanka  is  a  relative  concept  that  until  now  has  not  been  adequately\nmeasured  and  analyzed.  The  Government  Department  of  Census  and  Statistics  periodically\nconducts  household  income  and  expenditure  surveys.  From  the  data,  it  is  possible  to\ncharacterize  levels  of  poverty  by  region.  The  Government  publishes  findings  measuring\nconsumption poverty, which indicates that Sri Lanka experiences 21 percent poverty. Indicators\nare  provided  for  each  province,  but  they  tend  to  mask  differences  within  provinces.  For  that\nreason,  district analyses are  more pertinent.  Based on the poverty analysis of districts, some\nareas  in  the  interior  are  extremely  poor  due  to  lack  of  infrastructure.  The  Government  is\npreparing  a  new  Framework  for  Poverty  Reduction  in  Sri  Lanka  with  participation  of  major\nstakeholders  in  the  country,  including  aid  agencies.  The  report  will  be  presented  at  the\nforthcoming Development Forum of Sri Lanka in December 2000.\n\n2.\nThe  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  has  also  undertaken  extensive\nanalysis  of  poverty  with  the  assistance  of  the  World  Bank.  The  National  Human  Development\nReport  for  Sri  Lanka  produced  in  1998  utilized  two  indexes:  (i)  the  human  development  index\n(HDI), and (ii) the human poverty index (HPI).  The HDI comprises several subindices including\nlife  expectancy,  literacy,  enrollments,  etc.  and  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  index.\nTogether the life expectancy, education, and standard of living indices portray an average level\nof  achievement  and  fulfillment  for  provinces  and  districts.  The  HPI  measures  deprivation  and\nshortfalls rather than levels of fulfillment. The index comprises indices of mortality rates for 40\nyears  or  younger,  illiteracy  and  nonenrollment,  and  lack  of  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and\nelectricity. Not surprisingly, district rankings vary, depending on the scale used.\n\n3.\nFrom  the  HDI,  it  is  clear  that  Sri  Lanka  has  done  reasonably  well  in  promoting  human\ndevelopment for all its people. Differences do arise but are caused by lack of infrastructure and\nopportunities due to remoteness, etc. An examination of the HPI shows that, again, districts do\nwell  or  poorly  based  often  on  location  vis-\u00e0-vis  roads,  electricity,  and  access  to  good  schools\nand information. Figure A12, taken from the UNDP report, plots the position of each district in\nrelation to the two indices. UNDP did not report on the districts in those provinces undergoing\ncivil strive. However, it is likely that poverty in those areas is significantly lower than the national\naverage.  The  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Social  Analysis  of  Sri  Lankan  Emergency\nRehabilitation in NE Province confirms this hypothesis.\n\n4.\nAn  analysis  of  relative  poverty  deprivation  based  on  Figure  A12  indicates  that  the\ndistricts  of  Ratnapura,  Hambantota,  Kegale,  Puttalam,  Badulla,  and  Moneragala  are  the  worst\noff  of  all  districts  in  terms  of  both  human  development  and  human  poverty.  The  are  generally\nremote regions or arid plains with poor soil and little infrastructure. The districts of Kurunegala,\nAnuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Nuwara Eliya appear below average in human poverty due to\nlack of access to electricity, safe water, and infrastructure, but do well on human development.\nThese regions are generally well-off economically due to abundant natural resources, but are so\nremote as to make it difficult to enter the national grids for water and sanitation, electricity, etc.\nThe  UNDP  report  examines  each  province  and  recommends  economic  strategies  to  eliminate\npoverty.  In  each  case,  whether  it  be  to  improve  agriculture  or  diversify  the  economy,  a  strong\nhuman  resource  base  is  required.  In  many  cases,  poor  provinces  exist  adjacent  to  rich\nprovinces, and as such it may be possible to link the economies so that there is greater mobility\nand  development  between regions.  There are over a million students in the six provinces that\nwill  benefit  from  the  Project.  They  will  benefit  from  the  quality  inputs  to  education  and  will\nespecially qualify for stipend programs, and school upgrading to establish more full-curriculum\nschools in local education divisions.\n\n\f74\n\nt\nn\ne\nm\np\no\nl\ne\nv\ne\nd\nn\na\nm\nu\nh\nn\n\n \n\n \n\ni\n \ne\nc\nn\na\nm\nr\no\nf\nr\ne\np\n \ne\ng\na\nr\ne\nv\na\n \ne\nv\no\nb\nA\n\nt\nn\ne\nm\np\no\nl\ne\nv\ne\nd\nn\na\nm\nu\nh\nn\n\n \n\n \n\ni\n \ne\nc\nn\na\nm\nr\no\nf\nr\ne\np\n \ne\ng\na\nr\ne\nv\na\n \nw\no\ne\nB\n\nl\n\nFigure A12: Comparative Performance in Human Development and Human Poverty\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nKurunegala\n\nKalutara\n\nAnuradhapura\n\nGampaha\n\nColombo\n\nPolonnaruwa\n\nNuwara Eliya\n\nBelow average performance in human poverty\n\nAbove average performance on human poverty\n\nRatnapura\n\nHambantota\n\nKegalle\n\nPuttalam\n\nMatale\n\nBadulla\n\nMoneragala\n\nGalle\n\nMatara\n\nKandy\n\nNote: Also compare with map (page vi).\nSource: United Nations Development Programme. 1998.

Of these students, at least 45 percent\nwill be poor. Of the targeted interventions worth $14.0 million of the $50.0 million loan, the poor\nwill gain stipends, science laboratories, and access to full-curriculum schools and this will help\nthem  to  complete  grade  11  and  pass  the  O  level  national  examination  that  entitles  them  to\ncontinue to grade 12.  Including both targeted and systemwide benefits, about $25 million or half\nof  the  project  loan  will  go  toward  improving  the  education  of  disadvantaged  secondary  school\nstudents.\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\n6.\nSecondary  schools  are  of  two  types:  (i)  full-curriculum  schools  (with  grades  12-13\nscience classes), and (ii) limited-curriculum schools. Based on measures of ability to pay school\nfees  and  afford  after-school  tutorials,  it  is  estimated  that  at  least  50  percent  of  students  in\nlimited-curriculum  schools  are  poor  while  30  percent  of  these  in  full-curriculum  schools  qualify\nas  poor.  When  these  percentages  are  translated  in  terms  of  to  project  schools  of  which  40\npercent  have  full-curriculum  and  60  percent  are  limited-curriculum,  it  is  estimated  that  42\npercent of the project beneficiaries are designated as poor. The pass rates for full and limited\nschools  are  50  percent  and  25  percent,  respectively.  Special  means-tested  stipend  programs\ntargeted  to  poor  students  are  expected  to  benefit  poor  students  taking  the  grades  11  and  13\nexaminations.
