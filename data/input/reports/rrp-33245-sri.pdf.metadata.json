It  will  improve  the  quality  of  academic\nsubjects  and  skills  including  English,  mathematics,  science,  and\ncomputer literacy needed to prepare 15 to 18-year-olds for work in\nthe modern economy and help narrow the digital divide. The Project\nwill upgrade small rural schools to full-curriculum schools to increase\nopportunities  for  poor  students  to  improve  their  educational\nbackground, acquire computer skills, and pass national examinations.\nIt  will  provide  stipends  to  enable  poor  students  to  study  in  full-\ncurriculum schools. The Project will strengthen the delivery system of\nsecondary  education  by  expanding  the  role  of  the  Ministry  of\nEducation and Higher Education (MEHE) to include education quality\nassurance  to  better  manage  and  supervise  secondary  education\nincluding support for school principals, school development societies\n(SDSs),  and  provincial,  district  zonal,  and  divisional  education\nofficers.  The  Project  will  support  institutional  strengthening  of  the\nNational Evaluation Testing Service (NETS) and the National Institute\nof  Education  (NIE).  Institutional  strengthening  will  lead  to  greater\nquality, access, and improved management capacity to ensure that\ngreater  numbers  of  academically  qualified  students  will  complete\nsecondary school.\nClassification Primary objective: Human development\nSecondary objective: Poverty reduction\nEnvironmental Environmental category C\nAssessment\nEnvironmental implications were reviewed, and no significant adverse\nenvironmental impacts were identified.\nRationale While Sri Lanka has achieved progress in basic human development,\nit has been unable to translate these achievements into broad-based,\nsustainable economic growth. Worse still, the rural poor have not had\nequal  access  to  opportunities  necessary  to  acquire  social  and\nphysical capital. A key reason for this failure to achieve more rapid\neconomic growth with greater equity is the deficiency of the education\nsystem.  Strong  state  dominance  and  an  inflexible  regulatory\nframework that limits choice have characterized the system. There\nhave been an overreliance on national tests as opposed to school-\nbased assessment (SBA) and a mismatch between ability to pay and\nsecondary school educational services offered. There is little choice\nin the quality of education, especially for the poor, access to stipends\nor public-private partnerships is limited and, finally, supervision and\nmanagement style from the national to the local level are inadequate.\nThese  conditions  have  created  a  secondary  school  system  that\ngraduates  students  unequipped  with  marketable  skills  and\nunprepared to participate in the modern economy. The result are\nrelatively high unemployment among the educated while emerging\nmodern  sector  employment  opportunities  are  unfilled  for  lack  of", "iii\nqualified  candidates,  and  an  inefficient  and  inflexible  secondary\neducation system that restricts curriculum choice and occupational\nopportunities.  Sri Lanka views modernization of secondary education\nas  one  of  the  main  pillars  of  its  drive  for  economic  and  social\ndevelopment  and  a  key  to  reducing  regional  disparities.\nConsequently, there is no alternative but to improve school quality by\nraising standards, increase access especially for the poor through\ngreater choice of quality offerings and raise administrative efficiency\nthrough school leadership and decentralization.\nObjectives and The overall objective of the Project is to assist the Government to\nScope modernize the secondary school system  to  prepare  the young  to\ncompete in the modern global economy.  Specifically, the Project will\nimprove the quality of secondary school education to raise the pass\nrate in the national examination. Quality improvement will lead to\nhigher  pass  rates  especially  through  improved  access  for\ndisadvantaged  students  by  introducing  stipends  and  upgrading\nselected schools to full-curriculum secondary schools in underserved\nareas. The Project will improve school supervision and management\nso  that  teachers  and  principals  will  have  greater  control  over\nclassroom learning, as it affects examination results.  The Project has\nthree components: Component 1 will modernize secondary schools\nby introducing modern teaching, learning, and evaluation methods to\nimprove quality. The subcomponents include (i) school-based student\nlearning  activities  and  continuous  assessment  for  grades  10-13\nstudents, and (ii) expanded computer technology-directed learning to\nnarrow  the  digital  divide.  Component  2  will  broaden  educational\nopportunities for disadvantaged students by (i) expanding the number\nof  full-curriculum  schools  in  rural  areas,  (ii)  extending  stipend\nprograms to enable the poor to attend the high-quality full-curriculum\nschools, (iii) introducing career guidance programs to increase career\ninformation  for  expanded  opportunities  and  mobility,  and  (iv)\nconducting  research  studies  to  determine  cost-effective  ways  to\naccommodate  public-private  partnerships  in  secondary  education.\nComponent  3  will  improve  the  delivery  of  educational  services\nthrough (i) quality assurance within MEHE and the strengthening of\nlocal supervision and school-based management (SBM); (ii) SBA in\ngrades  10-13  including  modernizing  the  national  examination\nadministration at NETS; (iii) NIE curriculum in-service training in the\nnew technology education stream, career guidance, and computer\ntraining; and (iv) a project management office.\nCost Estimates The total cost is estimated at $76.0 million equivalent, of which the\nforeign exchange cost is estimated at $38.8 million (51 percent of the\ntotal cost) and the local currency cost at $37.2 million equivalent (49\npercent of the total cost).", "iv\nFinancing Plan _______________________________________________($ million)__\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\n_________________________________________________________\nADB 32.8 17.2 50.0 66\nNDF   6.0 1.0 7.0 9\nGovernment 0.0 17.0 17.0 22\nBeneficiariesa 0.0 2.0 2.0 3\n   Total 38.8 37.2 76.0 100\n_________________________________________________________\nADB = Asian Development Bank, NDF = Nordic Development Fund.\n     a  School development societies.\nLoan Amount A  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR38,071,000  ($50\nand Terms million equivalent) from the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Special\nFunds  resources.

Up  to  one  million\nstudents  attending  grades  10-13  each  year  will  benefit  from  the\nprogram over the five-year project period and the subsequent five-\nyear period after project completion. The Project will increase access\nto 100 upgraded full-curriculum schools for about 5,000 additional\ndisadvantaged students annually over 10 years; provide stipends to\n30,000  disadvantaged  students  to  attend  existing  full-curriculum\nschools over five years; and provide all students with information\nabout education, training, and jobs. The Project will also improve the\ndelivery  of  secondary  education  by  strengthening  the  capacity  of\nMEHE to plan and coordinate monitoring and supervision of quality\nimprovements  at  the  central  and  local  level  for  up  to  6,000\nadministrators.\nThe Project will assist NETS to improve the examination system. The\nchange is expected to increase the pass rates at 0 level enabling an\naverage additional 50,000 students (age 16) per year over 12 years\nto quality for entry into grade 12, many of whom would otherwise fail\nto quality. About 32 NETS staff will be trained and given fellowships.\nThe  Project  will  also  help  NIE  to  improve  its  teacher  in-service\nprograms  to  strengthen  classroom  instruction  in  key  subjects.  In-\nservice training will benefit up to 14,000 secondary school teachers:\n800  computer  teachers;  2,300  each  career  guidance,  English,\nmathematics, and commerce teachers; about 2,500 science teachers;\nand 1,500 principals, supervisors, and administrative and technical\nstaff.  Together,  the  internal  efficiency  of  the  secondary  education\nsystem will increase by 40 percent based on the increase in pass\nrates from 35 percent to 50 percent. The social rate of return for the\nProject is calculated at 16 percent.\nAbout  42  percent  of  the  project  beneficiaries  are  poor  students\nalthough only 21 percent of national households are judged poor by\ngovernment indicators. Of the 800 specially targeted project schools,\n60  percent  are  low-performing  schools  where  over  half  of  the\nenrollees are poor, whereas about 30 percent of students attending\nthe  remaining  40  percent  of  well-performing  schools  are  poor.\nConsequently,  42  percent  of  the  project  beneficiaries  are\ndisadvantaged  students.  Of  the  approximately  500,000  additional\ngrade 11 students qualifying for entry to grade 12 over 12 years, at\nleast  20  percent  are  expected  to  graduate  from  the  poorest\nperforming schools. These students will have passed the national\nexamination as a result of improved teaching, transfer policies to\ngood schools, and stipends and remedial programs provided to help\npoor students prepare for national examinations.", "vi", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Secondary  Education\nModernization Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. Following the release of the Presidential Task Force Report on General Education in\n1998, the Government of Sri Lanka took steps to modernize the secondary education system.\nModernizing secondary schools will help to increase access to quality education and make the\ncountry more competitive. In April 1999, the Government requested the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) to support secondary education modernization. In response to this request, ADB\nassisted the Government to undertake a feasibility study1 from October 1998 to January 1999,\nemploying  a  participatory  approach  with  central,  provincial,  district,  zonal,  and  divisional\neducation officials, principals, teachers, parents, students, and nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs). The consultative process involved workshops and school meetings to confirm the\ndemand for computer learning, and local involvement in monitoring and supporting the use of\ncomputer  learning  centers  (CLCs).  Meetings  were  held  among  ADB,  Japan  International\nCooperation  Agency  (JICA),  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  and  the\nGovernment to plan strategies for future widespread use of school computers. A Loan Fact-\nFinding Mission was conducted in April 2000 and appraisal in June 2000.2 This proposal is\nbased  on  the  findings  of  the  feasibility  report,  ADB  Missions  and  subsequent  staff  work.\nAppendix 1 presents the project framework.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. Socioeconomic Context\n3. Sri Lanka\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.2 percent per annum during the\n1990s. In 1998, the per capita GDP averaged $823. Although the GDP growth rate has slowed\nin recent years, the Government has achieved macroeconomic stability with single-digit inflation\nand a fiscal deficit lower than that in the mid-1990s, despite the economic and political instability\nin the region. The Government achieved considerable progress in the structural reform agenda\nthat includes tax reform and the reduction of public sector dominance through increased public-\nprivate sector participation. Curtailing public sector employment already has contributed toward\nprivate sector growth and the reduction of educated unemployment from 29 percent in 1990 to\n19 percent in 1998. The continued emphasis on human resources is needed to prepare a skilled\nlabor force capable of taking advantage of new global trends in technology-based, value-added\njobs,  and  to  promote  labor-intensive  products  in  agriculture,  tourism,  and  manufacturing.\nWithout a strong skill and knowledge base, the Government believes it is unlikely that Sri Lanka\ncan compete in the regional and global economy.\n                                                \n1  TA 3241-SRI: Secondary Education Modernization Project, for $250,000, approved on 12 August 1999.\n2  The Mission comprised W. Loxley, Education Specialist/Mission Leader; S. Nanwani, Senior Counsel; K.M.\nTilakaratne, Implementation Officer/Resident Mission; and W.S. Perera, Staff Consultant/Examinations Specialist.", "2\n4. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Index ranks\nSri Lanka 84th among 174 countries. Sri Lanka has achieved success in building a strong\nfoundation in human development including high adult literacy, near-universal school enrollment\nthrough grade 9 (age 14), and gender parity in school enrollments. Although Sri Lanka has\nstrong social indicators compared with other countries, incidence of absolute poverty is high\nwith 21 percent  of the total 18.8 million population still living in poverty.3 However, several\nproblems remain to be tackled before these achievements can be translated into high economic\ngrowth. The quality of social services is deteriorating due to financial constraints, given the high\ncost of the civil conflict. Substantial regional disparities have arisen where the rural poor have\nless access to quality basic services, especially to high-quality schools. More classrooms,\nlibraries, and science laboratories are needed to upgrade the smaller rural schools to full-\ncurriculum  schools  (e.g.,  grades  12-13  science  stream).  Full-curriculum  schools  needed\nupgrading and expansion so they can accommodate more students from disadvantaged areas.\nThe quality of secondary must be improved and equal access to good schools ensured for the\npoor and other disadvantaged groups. Good schools imply greater social and economic mobility\nfor  the  young  \u2013  especially  for  the  disadvantaged  who  can  score  high  on  the  national\nexamination as a result of improved academic performance in school.\n2. The Secondary Education System\n5. The education system in Sri Lanka comprises nine years of basic education and four\nyears of secondary education comprising two years of ordinary (O level) study (grades 10-11)\nand two years of advanced (A level) study (grades 12-13). Out of about 4 million students in the\nschool system of 10,000 schools, about one million students are in the secondary grades in\nabout 2,300 schools. About 40,000 of the 180,000 teachers in the system teach in these upper\ngrades.4 Education is compulsory through age 14 to enforce universal basic education and the\nGovernment aims to extend compulsory education to age 16 (grade 11), but at present although\nabout 90 percent of students complete grade 11, only one third continue to grade 12 as most of\nthem are unable to pass the O level examination taken after grade 11. In fact, 15 percent of\ngrade 11 students fail all subjects on the O level examination. This unsatisfactory academic\nperformance is a key indicator of the poor quality of teaching and learning in secondary schools.\nThe  failure  of  these  students  to  attain  minimum  achievement  levels  results  in  significant\nwastage of financial resources. Lack of educational facilities, teaching materials, and learning\nresources is the root cause of the low quality of teaching and limited coverage of secondary\neducation.\n6. Currently, there are two types of secondary schools: the first consists of about 600 full-\ncurriculum secondary schools that offer courses in science, commerce, and the arts and the\nsecond consists of about 1,700 limited-curriculum secondary schools offering courses in either\ncommerce or the arts or both. The 600 full-curriculum schools are often better equipped and\nstaffed than the 1,700 limited-curriculum schools. The latter are disproportionately located in\nrural communities and lack science teachers and facilities for teaching science. Students in the\nlimited-curriculum schools are more likely to perform poorly on national examinations because\n                                                \n3  The Government has been formulating a new framework for poverty reduction in Sri Lanka, with participation of\nmajor stakeholders in the country including the aid agencies.  The framework provides a comprehensive analysis\nof the poverty situation in Sri Lanka based on more recent data and proposes a new Government strategy to\nreduce poverty.  It will be presented at the Development Forum for Sri Lanka in December 2000.\n4  There are about 75 private schools offering the national curriculum and preparing students for the national\nexamination.  Most of these private schools are state-assisted receiving textbooks and teacher salaries. In addition,\nthere are about 30 international schools managed as fee levying private enterprises.  They are outside the national\nschool system and follow various curricula and examination schemes, and provide instruction in English language.", "3\nthe quality of schooling is worse than in the full-curriculum schools.  There is a need to improve\nthe quality of all schools so that students in all geographical regions have equal access to\nquality education. One approach is to upgrade limited-curriculum schools to full-curriculum\nschools. Another approach is to widen access to full-curriculum schools by providing stipends\nand targeted bursaries to enable disadvantaged students to attend the better, full-curriculum\nschools. School reforms are also needed to ensure that students have access to expanded\ncurriculum programs and a wider choice of options by enabling them to transfer from one school\nto another.\n3. School Access and the Poor\n7. About one million students attend secondary school: 350,000 each in grades 10 and 11,\nand about 150,000 each in grades 12 and 13.  Enrollments are now declining by about 1\npercent per annum in the primary grades and this will eventually lead to decline in secondary\nschool  enrollments  thereby  removing  budgetary  pressure  to  expand  education  resources.\nCurrently, dropping out occurs only between grades 11 and 12 as students fail the examination\nin great numbers, however, they can repeat grade 11 and sit for the examination a second time.\nThe same also holds for the national examination taken after grade 13. Because over 90\npercent of students aged 15 and 16 attend grades 10 and 11, most students from poor families\nare in school until they drop out after grade 11 when they fail the grade 11 national examination.\n8. Of the 2,300 secondary schools, about 10 percent are large schools with more than\n1,000 students. These schools are in large cities and provincial capitals. Another 50 percent\nhave enrollments of about 500. The remaining 40 percent have small enrollments, often lack\nelectricity and teachers, and taken together do not enroll more than 20 percent of secondary\nschool students. For this reason, focusing on about 35 percent of all secondary schools can\ncover almost all grades 12-13 students and up to one third of grades 10-11 students. These\nschools comprise both good and bad performing schools and so a careful rationalization of\nschool juxtaposition is required to ensure that each community has access to a high-performing\nschool. The well-performing schools generally exclude economically poor students who perform\npoorly on academic tests due to a lack of resources at home. At least half of students in poor\nperforming  schools  are  economically  disadvantaged,  while  about  30  percent  of  students\nattending high-quality schools are economically poor.\n9. The problem of access to quality schooling is complicated because students sometimes\nwill not attend schools dominated by those of another cultural background. Also, some schools\ndo not offer a full set of academic choices especially in grades 12-13, so students wishing to\nstudy science, for example, often transfer to another school to study science or else switch to\narts or commerce in their own school. The Government provides a stipend program for bright\nstudents in grades 6 through 11, and the President\u2019s office recently initiated a pilot program to\nprovide stipends for students in secondary school who do well on their grade 9 examinations.\nWhat is further needed are stipends targeted to poor but promising students in grades 10 and\n11 to help them to attend better schools and to provide them with remedial assistance so they\ncan  pass  the  O  level  examination.  Other  stipends  can  be  targeted  to  successful  O  level\ncandidates, who would otherwise drop out, to enable them to attend grades 12-13. School\ndevelopment societies (SDSs) provide assistance to needy students in cooperation with school\nprincipals. The national safety net Samurdhi program also provides direct income support to\nnearly  50  percent  of  all  families.  Together  these  programs  help  to  meet  the  needs  of\ndisadvantaged students in schools but despite them, only about half of the students can afford\nthe voluntary fees requested by SDS. The situation indicates the extent of student poverty in\nschools.", "4\n4.  The Secondary School Curriculum and Learning\n10. Secondary schools follow a standard curriculum and syllabus in each grade. However,\nsome schools offer only the arts or commerce syllabus, or both, while others offer in addition\nscience courses in grades 12-13. The schools that offer science require science laboratories\nand must be staffed with qualified science teachers in physics, mathematics, biology, and\nchemistry. Typically, students attend classes where the traditional chalk-and-talk method is the\nrule and have access to a school library. To alter classroom teaching and textbook learning, the\nGovernment, under the new education reforms, has introduced project work and field studies\nrequiring  students  to  access  greater  amounts  of  knowledge  and  information  outside  the\nclassroom. For example, in grades 12-13, textbooks are not provided and teachers often lack\nspecific training. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) plans to provide\nmultiple textbooks to be placed in school libraries for reference and include multimedia rooms\nwith television, video cassette recorder (VCR) and audio cassettes to provide students with\nlearning materials separate from the traditional textbook and lecture format. Language cassettes\nto improve pronunciation are another example of the multimedia approach to classroom learning\nin Sri Lanka. The National Institute of Education (NIE) was established under the National\nEducation Act (No. 28 of 1985). NIE, which is responsible for curriculum development and in-\nservice curriculum training, is introducing innovative programs to introduce applied science and\ntechnology  in  grades  12-13  that  allow  students  to  apply  physics  and  biology  in  everyday\nproblem solving.\n11. NIE has produced a syllabus for computer literacy that emphasizes both information\ntechnology (IT) and interactive learning. The Government would like to include a computer\nlaboratory in every school, but at the moment will require the subject to be mandatory only for\ngrades 12-13. Computer laboratories are expected to increase access to electronic reference\nmaterials, and software materials to supplement science, mathematics, English, and commerce\nlessons, but eventually will allow access to the Internet, tutorials, and other interactive computer\nlearning  activities  that  are  expected  to  change  the  way  students  learn  lessons.  NIE  is\ndeveloping a system to download free academic software off the Internet and provide compact\ndisk-read only memory (CD-ROM) via private service providers to school computer laboratories.\nIn summary, the use of new educational technologies in grades 10-13 is becoming a reality. The\nGovernment does not want its schools left behind those of other countries and it regards the\nbenefits of those technologies as important because they can supplement the information,\nknowledge, and pedagogical style of classroom teachers to help improve student learning.\nThese new technologies also offer additional avenues for study so that teachers can easily\nassess individual and group progress.\n5. The Examination System\n12. Secondary education follows the traditional British system of two years (grades 10-11) of\nschooling followed by the O level national examination. Successful completion of this national\nexamination allows the student to attend two additional years of secondary school (grades 12-\n13)  followed  by  the  A  level  national  examination.  Currently,  about  35  percent  of  students\nsuccessfully pass the O level examination (up from 24 percent in 1990) and about 45 percent\npass the A level examination (this rate has remained steady over the past 10 years as the\nexamination  serves  mainly  as  a  determinant  of  university  entrance  rather  than  a  test  of\nsecondary school completion).", "5\n13. Each of these one-shot examinations evaluates two years of education assessed in\nseveral hours of testing. While the examination system remains honest and highly respected,\nmany view it as an anachronism that disallows continuous assessment throughout the year for\nassignments, projects, and coursework graded by the teacher. Furthermore, parents pay for\nprivate tutoring after school to give an advantage to their children. Only about 50 percent of the\nstudents can afford the tutorial costs and the system detracts from ensuring that in-school\nteaching is maximized. In the past, the national examination was thought to be a meritocratic\nway  to  select  students  for  public  sector  employment.  Today,  public  sector  employment  is\nminimal and those continuing on to the university represent only about 10 percent of successful\nA  level  candidates.  Consequently,  an  examination  system  that  counts  secondary  school\ncoursework,  especially  science  laboratory  work,  student  projects  in  English,  mathematics,\ncommerce, and computer work that can be used by employers to judge student qualifications for\nwork and on-job-training is preferable to the existing examination system that labels students\neither as winners or losers. The Government has mandated school-based assessment (SBA) in\ngrades 6-9 to allow teachers to evaluate students on both academic and attitudinal attributes.\nStarting in 2001, the system will be introduced in grades 10-13 and linked to the national\nexamination system. While government officials and academicians view the current system as\nantiquated, the public continues to see the national examination as a highly important measure\nof student success. For this reason, the public is reluctant to change the examination system\nthat is seen by many as the only way to be judged competent.\n14. The examination system is run by the Department of Examinations (DOE) that recently\nmoved  its  operations  from  18th  century  slave  quarters.  The  unit  responsible  for  national\nexaminations  is  the  National  Evaluation  and  Testing  Service  (NETS),  which  is  presently\nestablished within MEHE. NETS is responsible for conducting the O and A level examinations\neach year. The O level examination is carried out in December, results are released in April,\nand the student resumes schooling in August (a nine-month interruption of studies). Grade 13\ncandidates take their examinations in August, learn results in December, and resume studies\nthe following December (a 15-month interruption in study). NETS staff view the carrying out of\nthe examinations as their most important function. While NETS has new equipment to secure\ntest printing and distribution, and computers for consolidating scores by test readers, the system\nlacks funding, staffing, and management. Little research is conducted and no one is looking at\nways to improve efficiency in test administration.\n6. Secondary School Management and Supervision\n15. MEHE is responsible for managing the education system, especially for setting policies\nand  standards.  MEHE  was  recently  reorganized  to  strengthen  its  planning,  policy,  and\nmonitoring  capacity  because  routine  tasks  including  personnel,  budgeting,  etc.  have  been\ndelegated to the local administration. Consequently, the reorganization has stressed quality\nassurance.  Further,  MEHE  has  increased  its  control  over  teacher  education  institutes  and\nexercises  closer  control  over  curriculum  development  (NIE)  and  school-based  assessment\n(SBA, NETS). Both NETS and NIE are now more closely coordinated and supervised by MEHE,\nwith MEHE taking responsibility for curriculum and examination policies.\n16. The Government recently took steps to restructure MEHE to include a deputy director\ngeneral  of  school  management  quality  assurance  responsible  for  line  supervision  and  for\nensuring  that  academic  standards  are  maintained.    The  supervision  component  was\nstrengthened to provide a greater line of control from national, provincial, district, zonal, and\ndivisional offices to schools. Under the reorganization, a deputy director general for quality\nassurance was designated to oversee quality assurance, and this has taken the form of school-", "6\nbased management (SBM) with the principal, SDS leader, and zonal officer pivotal in making\nthe system effective. Strong MEHE links with provincial and local schools are needed to ensure\ngood supervision and quality control. Zonal offices are staffed with education officers, but they\nrequire training. At present, the top-down management structure allows for little more than\npassing down orders and does not provide for two-way communication. The World Bank is\nproviding equipment and training to provincial and zonal offices to improve management for all\n10,000 schools so that school principals and SDS leaders will develop new management styles.\n7. Secondary School Finance\n17. The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) provides funding to the education sector\nthrough block grants directly to the provinces and to the schools. In 1998, approximately 10\npercent of the national budget was allocated for education. Of that amount, less than half went\nto secondary education. Presently, free education from grade 1 through university is available,\nbut  this  will  become  untenable  as  more  students  successfully  complete  the  grade  11\nexamination and opt for more education. The Government provides free tuition, textbooks,\nuniforms, and subsidized transport.5 Because the poor within each ethnic and linguistic group\ntend to live in relatively homogeneous communities isolated from one another, free education\ncan make an important contribution to promoting social cohesion through a commonly shared\nschooling  experience.  This  is  a  major  reason  given  for  the  continued  strong  Government\nsupport for free education throughout the country and for the sensitivity of communities to\nchanges in the financing of education.\n18. In 1998, the Government spent 2.6 percent of GDP on education, which is well below\nthe  3.5  percent  average  for  Asia.  Educational  expenditures  are  also  relatively  low  as  a\nproportion of the overall government budget \u2014 10 percent in 1998 compared with the 14\npercent average for Asia. The trend has been gradually declining over the past 10 years. The\nongoing civil conflict is partly to blame for the low expenditures. External sources finance most\ncapital investments while the Government provides recurrent costs.  Population growth has\nstabilized and so have enrollments. About 55 percent of the education budget covers grades 1-9\nand  45  percent  is  for  grades  10-13.  With  no  growth  in  enrollments  in  grades  1-9,  these\npercentages are likely to remain constant. The education budget has grown at about 10 percent\nper annum over the past 10 years but, after accounting for inflation, the increase is minimal.\nWith limited funds, it is unlikely that education budgets will increase over the near term. For this\nreason, educators will have to do more with less \u2014 this will pose problems for improving quality\nin the future if funds become scarce.\n19. Because education is free, students do not pay for books, uniforms, or subsidized\ntransport. School fees account for 5 percent of school costs and families often pay up to 20\npercent of discretionary income on education for children because students require more than\nthe one uniform provided and because books are only provided through grade 11 and not\nalways provided on time, etc. Parents also pay for after-school tutoring and facility fees in\nsecondary schools, often as a requirement for acceptance into quality schools. Despite the free\neducation policy, poor families' access to quality education is constrained by their inability to\nmeet the extra costs for books, uniforms, after-school tutoring, and facility fees.\n20. When  the  Government  nationalized  schools  in  1968,  it  did  so  to  abolish  the  wide\ndisparities  in  quality  and  attainment.  Over  the  past  40  years,  the  public  system  has  kept\n                                                \n5  TA 2441-SRI: A Study of Financing of Social Services, for $350,000, approved on 9 November 1995, documented\nin detail the direct and indirect school costs for families and government.", "7\ndifferences  to  a  minimum,  but  has  sacrificed  overall  quality  in  the  process.  In  addition,\nexpenditures have declined over time due in part to the added costs of the civil conflict, leading\nto a general deterioration of the fiscal situation. With declining real budgets and little chance for\nadditional revenues, the education system will have to do more with less. The decline in\nenrollment will help to offset the rise in costs,6 but the Government will eventually have to\nintroduce public-private participation as a way to reduce the number of public school applicants.\nThinking has to begin now if decisions are to be taken in several years time when the financial\ncrisis in education becomes critical. For example, it is estimated that about 50 high-caliber\npublic schools in urban areas are willing to withdraw from the public education system if they\ncould elect their own board and charge fees. They would retain the national curriculum and\nparticipate  in  national  examinations.  If  these  schools  were  to  be  given  autonomy,  the\nGovernment could save salaries for them. A study is needed to determine the potential for\nsavings to the system under this plan. Other public-private participation programs need to be\ndeveloped and costs determined as a way to experiment in increasing demand-based education\nto offset the rising cost of secondary education.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n21. The National Education Commission released the report Reforms in General Education\nin 1998. The report, based on recommendations from the Presidential Task Force, focused\nmostly on improving quality through improved curriculum relevance, teaching, and educational\nmanagement.  It  also  stressed  extending  educational  opportunities  to  reduce  inequalities\nbetween students attending full-curriculum and limited-curriculum schools. To improve quality\neducation, the Government, with World Bank assistance, is rationalizing teacher deployment\nand training, privatizing textbook printing and distribution, and consolidating grades 1-9 schools.\nIn planning the Project, ADB has discussed ways to consolidate grades 10-13 into a four-year\nsecondary school cycle instead of the present grades 10-11 and grades 12-13 associated with\nO and A level examinations. There is a policy to introduce SBA to allow teachers to participate\ndirectly in evaluating and providing feedback to students on academic and career matters,\nrather than relying solely on the outcome of national tests.  SBA has already been introduced\nsuccessfully in grades 6-9. Other policies are designed to broaden the range of academic skills,\nincluding  improving  English  language  and  computer  literacy.  Policies  being  considered  to\nimprove educational opportunities include raising compulsory education from grade 9 to grade\n11, consolidating grades 10-13, upgrading a number of limited \u2014 to full-curriculum schools, and\nreforming the O level examination to reduce the failure rate. Other policy considerations include\nintroducing career guidance and counseling for students and parents to share information,\npromoting  public-private  partnership  in  education,  and  extending  primary  grades  academic\nstipends  to  upper  grade  late  bloomers.  The  World  Bank  and  ADB  strongly  support  these\ngovernment policies.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n22. Attempts to address issues of the quality of education and sector management have\nbeen supported by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies including ADB, the World Bank, JICA,\nSwedish International Development Agency (Sida), German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), and\nthe British Council and the Department for International Development (DFID).  Most of the\nbilateral  assistance  have  been  pilot  programs  targeted  to  primary  education  including\nassistance for English language learning, plantation schools in the mountain areas, and to\n                                                \n6  The savings in teacher salaries will be substantial. The World Bank is assisting in developing a rationalization and\nteacher redeployment policy for surplus teachers expected to reach 10,000 by the year 2005.", "8\nschools in areas of social conflict. JICA has supported middle schools (grades 6-9) and is\ninterested in assisting the Government along with support from the Japan Bank for International\nCooperation  (JBIC)  to  provide  computers  to  grades  1-11  schools.  External  support  is\nsummarized in Appendix 2.\n23. ADB has been playing a lead role in the secondary education sector.  The ADB-assisted\nSecondary  Education  Development  Project7  (SEDP)  has  supported  the  Government  in\ndeveloping curriculum and learning materials in grades 6-11, improving the examination and\nevaluation system, including the establishment of NETS; and providing physical infrastructure\nand  equipment  for  school  development  and  upgrading,  including  piloting  30  experimental\ncomputer  laboratories,  which  were  judged  successful  by  the  Government  in  its  Project\nCompletion Report.8 SEDP also developed and introduced SBA in grades 6-9 and developed\nprototype materials for SBM of principals. Many of these activities started under SEDP have\nbeen expanded by the Project and include especially the SBA, SBM, examination reform, and\nquality inputs through CLCs, science laboratory work and student-based learning activities. ADB\ninvolvement in secondary education lays the foundation for a strong general education system\nthat serves graduates of basic education helped by the World Bank and many bilateral aid\nagencies. At the same time, ADB efforts in secondary education provide the foundation for\nongoing ADB projects9 supporting jobs and technology outside the formal education system.\n24. The World Bank is implementing two education projects. The Teacher Education Project\n($64  million),  which  is  nearing  completion,  was  designed  to  improve  preservice  teacher\neducation, but also included a component to develop computer education training for teachers\nin teacher colleges, and administrators in district and school principal\u2019s offices.10 The General\nEducation Project ($70 million) provides for facilities, equipment, and training mainly for grades\n1-9 schools. Under the World Bank loan, schools benefit from curriculum development, textbook\npublication with public-private sector participation, school facilities upgrading, and education\nplanning and financing development through introduction of a unit cost resource allocation\nmechanism  to  address  inequalities  in  resource  allocation.  The  Project  recently  provided\ncomputer laboratories for 400 secondary schools as part of a new strategy to provide computers\nfor interactive learning in the middle grades.\nD. Lessons Learned\n25. The lessons in project performance audit reports (PPARs), project completion reports\n(PCRs), Sector Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in the Education Sector, and Country\nSynthesis of Postevaluation Findings across all developing member countries (DMCs) were\ntaken  into  account  in  designing  the  Project.11  Two  relevant  lessons  from  development\nexperience  ADB-wide  apply  to  Sri  Lanka.  First,  at  the  institutional  level,  inadequate\norganizational arrangements and weak management often result in inadequate arrangements\n                                                \n7  Loan 1247-SRI(SF): Secondary Education Development Project, for $31 million, approved on 24 August 1993. It\nclosed on 30 June 1999.\n8  SEDP Project Completion Report, 2000. Project Management Office, Colombo.\n9  Loan 1707-SRI(SF): Skills Development Project, for $18.8 million, approved on 28 October 1999; Loan 1535-\nSRI(SF): Science and Technology Personnel Development, for $20 million, approved on 11 September 1997; and\nTA  3073-SRI: Improving Educational Planning, for $800,000, approved 23 September 1998. The final report of the\nTA was used to prepare the Government\u2019s Tertiary Education Strategy for the Development Forum in Paris in\nDecember 2000.\n10 Computer Studies Report. 1999. World Bank Teacher Education and Teacher Deployment Project.\n11 As the secondary education portfolio is still new in Sri Lanka, no ADB PCRs or PPARs were undertaken for\nsecondary education projects.", "9\nfor continuous benefit monitoring and evaluation of projects. Second, a major limitation of policy\ndialogue  in  Sri  Lanka  has  been  the  weakness  among  all  levels  of  government,  local\ncommunities, and the private sector to address long standing education governance problems.\n26. Examples of weaknesses found in organizational administration can be seen in the way\nMEHE operated in the past. The Ministry spent too much time attending to details of answering\ncomplaints and administering procurement. Under the reorganization, many routine operations\nhave been delegated to the local level, leaving time for MEHE to concentrate on setting and\nmonitoring standards. With World Bank assistance, MEHE has established a computerized\ndatabase to rationalize school staffing and enrollments, and will allow for continuous monitoring\nof the education system.\n27. School effectiveness will be improved by greater community participation and delegation\nof authority under the MEHE reorganization. Community participation provides ownership for the\neducation system in general and the project components in particular. Previously, the SDS was\nnot allowed to raise and spend funds without permission from MEHE. New rules give greater\nflexibility  to  approval  for  small-scale  spending.  The  role  of  the  principal  also  needs  to  be\nexpanded to increase decentralized decision making. Together the SDS and the principal will\nhave to make decisions on spending so as to ensure an adequate supply of electricity and to\nmaintain school learning resources. At present, these concepts are not well understood by\neducation officers and principals, and the only way to get schools to take responsibility is to\nmake principals accountable to the parents. At the national level, MEHE quality assurance will\nbe critical to introduce decentralized administration to both local education offices and schools.\n28. To overcome the first weakness, the project management office (PMO) from SEDP will\nbe expanded and more closely integrated within the newly organized MEHE.  More qualified\nstaff will ensure that the day-to-day implementation work is carried out in a scheduled manner\nso that contracts for procurement and consultants are prepared on time. This will allow for\nidentification of project schools in the phased schedule and for coordination of training and\nfellowships in proper sequence. Closer links to the unit in MEHE responsible for monitoring and\nplanning secondary education will ensure that monitoring takes place in a simple but efficient\nmanner. The MEHE reorganization will go far to streamline the monitoring of school results as\nwell as to introduce SBM.\n29. The second lesson pertains to the need for MEHE to address long-standing education\nissues under governance. Under SEDP and the World Bank projects, MEHE often did not follow\nthrough to sustain important policy measures required to ensure project momentum. SBM\ncourses were offered to principals under SEDP, but they were too academic in content. A strong\nSBM  program  as  part  of  quality  assurance  under  the  MEHE  reorganization  has  been\nredesigned to strengthen the existing supervision procedures starting at the provincial to the\nzonal level. The SBM system will include a strong awareness program for the principal, school\nstaff, and SDS leaders through the MEHE quality assurance unit, the NETS SBA system, and\nthrough the NIE in-service teacher training. Together, the multiple support system approach of\nNETS, NIE, and MEHE is expected to provide, respectively, examination, teacher in-service\ntraining, and administrative supervision that will strengthen the role of the principal and SDS.\n30. Quality assurance requires MEHE support to improve classroom learning.  Lessons\nlearned from previous ADB secondary school science projects in South Asia suggest that\nprincipals  and  administrative  staff  require  awareness  training  to  ensure  commitment  to\nclassroom learning.  Under the Project, extensive SBM and teacher training is provided to", "10\nimprove  classroom  learning  and  subsequent  SBA,  which  is  closely  tied  to  national\nexaminations.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n31. ADB\u2019s current country operational strategy (COS) was approved in 1999. The strategy\naims to assist Sri Lanka to reduce poverty and achieve a sustainable higher level of economic\ngrowth by supporting (i) policy and institutional reforms to promote private sector development\nand improved public sector management, (ii) human resource development to address the gap\nin  marketable  skills  and  improve  employment  and  income  levels,  (iii) enhancement  of  the\ncountry\u2019s infrastructure through public and private investment, (iv) preservation of the country\u2019s\nnatural resources base, and (v) measures to mitigate the social and environmental impact of the\ntransition to a higher growth path. The COS highlights the declining quality of education, the\nmismatch of skills supplied to the labor market, deteriorating knowledge of English and scientific\nand technical subjects, more emphasis on creative rather than rote learning, refocusing of the\nGovernment\u2019s role from provider to facilitator of development, and a more rational utilization of\nresources including legal provision of funding for private education. In line with the thrust of the\nCOS and ADB\u2019s overarching objective of poverty reduction, ADB continues to support the\nGovernment\u2019s reform initiatives in the education sector as human development is a prerequisite\nfor sustainable economic growth. Education will also help both the rural and urban poor acquire\nsocial and physical capital.\n32. The ADB education strategy in Sri Lanka emphasizes secondary and postsecondary\neducation. The country has made progress in enrolling all students in school through grade 9.\nThe World Bank and other aid agencies have focused on the 7,700 schools providing primary\nand  middle  school  education.  The  ADB  strategy  is  to  encourage  raising  the  compulsory\nschooling level to grade 11 and to ensure that at least half of the students taking the grade 11\nnational examination pass it. This will improve equity and access to secondary education almost\nimmediately.  ADB  also  stresses  improving  teaching  in  grades  12-13  to  raise  the  level  of\nacademic skills in English, science, mathematics, reasoning and computer skills for 17- and 18-\nyear-olds to give them after graduation the choice to continue with schooling or enter the labor\nforce in the modern economy. The strategy also allows for greater equity as access to quality\nschools for the poor is improved. Secondary education is seen as the foundation of a strong and\nequitable education system. In addition to earlier support for general secondary education, ADB\nalready has provided assistance for science and technology (S&T) and skills programs for\nstudents who opt out of the formal education system prior to grade 12 (Loans 1707-SRI and\n1535-SRI, footnote 9). ADB also supports the Government\u2019s need to strengthen postsecondary\neducation in both the public and private sector. This includes open university/distance learning\nand, most important, proprietary education and on-the-job training as a way of increasing public-\nprivate  participation  to  improve  efficiency  and  mobility  opportunities  for  students  after\ncompleting secondary school. In the area of educational technologies, ADB views the level of\ndevelopment in Sri Lanka as sufficient to allow widespread use of computers in secondary\nschools to prepare students for the labor market and for postsecondary education and training\nwhere computer use is widespread.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n33. ADB has been involved in education sector policy dialogue with MEHE under SEDP and\nTA 3073-SRI: Improving Education Planning (footnote 9) designed to improve school efficiency\nand governance. Key issues discussed include (i) provision of full access to quality schooling for\ndisadvantaged students attending small schools, in an attempt to increase school attendance", "11\nfor all from age 14 to age 16; (ii) strengthening NETS to improve the reliability and validity of\nnational examinations through improved test administration and the introduction of SBA; and (iii)\nrestructuring of MEHE to focus on policy and standards setting to assist the local schools to\nstrengthen management and supervision. In addition to specific policies on school access to be\naddressed  through  the  project  components,  ADB  has  urged  the  Government  to  improve\nefficiency through good governance and through cost recovery and public-private partnership\ndesigned to guarantee the sustainability of the secondary education system.\n1. Improved Access for the Poor\n34. ADB has pointed out the need to ensure equitable access to schools for the poor. The\nGovernment has provided scholarships, the most common of which is the scholarship program\nstarting in grade 6 for those who successfully pass a special examination. The Government is\nalso interested in piloting a program to provide stipends for late bloomers starting in grade 10.\nUnder the Project, ADB will assist MEHE to introduce two stipend programs (one for grades 10\nand 11 students, and the other for grades 12 and 13 students) through block grants to schools\nto  provide  disadvantaged  students  with  resources  for  undergoing  remedial  tutoring  and/or\nattending better schools nearby. Stipends will be based on academic ability judged by results of\nthe grade 9 examination for recipients of grades 10-11 awards and the results of the grade 11\nexamination for recipients of grades 12-13 stipends. Also, a means test for family income to be\ndetermined by the project steering committee will be applied to select disadvantaged students\nwith high ability who would not pass the grade 11 national examination without assistance. The\nstipend program is intended to help increase the number of students passing the grade 11\nexamination. Currently, over 90 percent of all students attend grade 11, but only about one third\npass the grade 11 examination. If the pass rate can be increased through improved learning,\nstudents will have the opportunity to complete secondary school. As a consequence, the recent\ngovernment regulation to make education compulsory through grade 9 (age 14) should be\nmodified to apply to grade 11 (age 16), which is considered the minimum for a modern school\nsystem, by 2004. Other activities to improve access to secondary education under the Project\ninclude career guidance programs by 2002 aimed at motivating students to pursue academic\ncareers for good jobs and the move to improve public-private partnerships in education to\nreduce the financial pressure on the public education finance.\n35. A second policy initiative related to increasing access pertains to improving the national\nexamination system to allow more students to be successful in their academic studies. Under\nSEDP, NETS was established to separate national examinations from civil service examinations\nunder  the  Department  of  Examinations.  NETS  will  require  additional  resources  to  develop\nimproved testing, administrative procedures, monitoring, and research. The Government has\ngiven assurances that NETS will be fully staffed and funded over the coming years. This is\nespecially important because NETS has taken on the new role of training teachers in the use of\nSBA. SBA provides feedback to parents and students of day-to-day assignments on special\nprojects and schoolwork. It also assesses attitudes and deportment.  Under the Project, SBA\nwill be introduced in grades 10-13 so they can be counted toward graduation along with the\nnational examination. SBA is most effective in making school attendance important for both\nteachers and students when teachers employ new practices emphasizing activity-based study\nthat  applies  theory  with  practice.  Under  the  Project,  support  for  SBA  will  assess  learning\nactivities introduced under the Project to ensure that quality improvements stemming from these\nactivities will contribute to graduation.", "12\n2. Governance\n36. More than anything else, MEHE\u2019s success in overcoming educational inefficiencies will\ndepend on the quality of its governance, including management and planning linked to regional\nand local education institutions. Especially in education, participation by teachers and parents is\nnecessary to generate ownership and sustainability of community resources in local schools.\nMEHE has been restructured to strengthen its planning function and to devolve day-to-day\ndecision making to the local level. ADB encourages this movement through the strengthening of\nthe  school  inspectorate  to  review  the  learning  requirements  of  teaching  and  through\nstrengthening the leadership role of principals, provincial, district, zonal and divisional officers in\nlocal decision making with the assistance of the community.\n3. Sustainability\n37. To reduce costs, the concept of public-private partnerships has been raised with MEHE.\nSince nationalization of schools in the early 1970s, education has been almost exclusively\npublic and private education has been discouraged. However, the Government is currently\nunable to expand financial resources for education and other means must be found to pay for\nquality improvements. One possibility is to allow selected schools to collect fees to pay for\nteachers\u2019 salaries. However, these schools would appoint their own boards, pay teachers, and\nobserve the national curriculum and examinations. Such a public-private partnership scheme for\nschools would be fair because if children from better-off households select private schools,\nmore public money could be targeted toward the poor.  ADB will encourage a study of public-\nprivate partnerships in education with the expectation that decisions to remove the ban on\nprivate schools will be forthcoming.\n38. Sustainability also requires cost recovery.  Parents already pay over 20 percent of\nsecondary school costs including private tutoring and voluntary school fees. MEHE has agreed\nto have schools charge facility fees for CLCs to cover the costs for software, electricity, and\noperations and maintenance (O&M) charges.  These fees are levied by SDSs and the funds go\nspecifically to pay the costs incurred by CLCs.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n39. While Sri Lanka has achieved progress in basic human development, it has been unable\nto translate these achievements into broad-based, sustainable economic growth. Worse still, the\nrural poor have not had equal access to human resources necessary to acquire social and\nphysical capital. A key reason for this failure to achieve more rapid economic growth with\ngreater  equity  is  the  deficiency  of  the  education  system.  Strong  state  dominance  and  an\ninflexible regulatory framework that limits choice have characterized the system. There is an\noverreliance on national tests as opposed to SBA, as well as a mismatch between ability to pay\nand  secondary  school  educational  services  offered.  There  is  little  choice  in  the  quality  of\neducation  especially  for  the  poor,  access  to  stipends  or  opportunities  for  public-private\npartnerships are limited and, finally, supervision and management style from the national to\nlocal level are inadequate. These conditions have created an inefficient and inflexible secondary\neducation system that restricts curriculum choice and occupational opportunities, and one that\ngraduates students unequipped with marketable skills and unprepared to participate in the\nmodern  economy.  The  result  is  relatively  high  unemployment  among  the  educated  while", "13\nemerging  modern  sector  employment  opportunities  are  unfilled  due  to  lack  of  qualified\ncandidates. Sri Lanka views modernization of secondary education as one of the main pillars of\nits  drive  for  economic  and  social  development  and  a  key  to  reducing  regional  disparities.\nConsequently, there is no alternative but to improve school quality by raising standards, to\nimprove access especially for the poor through greater choice of quality curriculum offerings and\nto  improve  administrative  efficiency  through  strong  school  leadership  and  administrative\ndecentralization.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n40. The objective of the Project is to improve the quality of secondary school to raise\nnational examination results for one million grades 10-13 students in 2,300 secondary schools\nnationwide.  Improved  education  will  increase  classroom  learning  and  raise  pass  rates  on\nnational examinations. The Project will also improve access to these quality improvements for\ndisadvantaged students through stipends and by upgrading existing secondary schools to full-\ncurriculum  schools  in  disadvantaged  areas.  This  will  ensure  that  up  to  50,000  additional\nstudents each year for 12 years will pass the grade 11 national examination. The Project will\nimprove management and supervision throughout the national, provincial, and local education\ninstitutions so that teachers and principals will have greater control over classroom learning as it\naffects school efficiency.\n41. The Project has three components: (i) quality, (ii) access, and (iii) efficiency. Quality\ninvolves (i) school-based student learning activities and assessment for core subjects in grades\n10-13,  and  (ii)  expanded  computer  technology-directed  learning.  Access  will  (i)  broaden\neducational opportunities by expanding by 100 the number of full-curriculum schools in remote\nareas,  (ii)  extend  stipend  programs  to  over  30,000  academically  qualified  poor  students,\n(iii) introduce career guidance in all secondary schools to enhance students\u2019 educational and\noccupational choice, and (iv) conduct studies on cost recovery in secondary education and\nbased on the finding of the study recommend a public-private partnership model to make\nsecondary education competitive. Efficiency will improve the delivery of educational services\nthrough (i) quality assurance within MEHE and the strengthening of local supervision and SBM,\n(ii) SBA in grades 10-13 including modernizing the national examination administration at NETS;\n(iii) NIE curriculum development and in-service training in new A level technology stream, career\nguidance,  and  computer  training;  and  (iv) project  implementation  at  the  PMO.  The  project\nmanagement structure and design summary are found in Appendix 3.\n1. Quality Improvement in Grades 10-13 (Component 1)\na. Strengthening of Curriculum Subjects\n42. This subcomponent will strengthen the quality of teaching in grades 10-13 subjects\nincluding English, science, mathematics, environmental studies, new technology courses, and\ncommerce while paying special attention to schoolwork that emphasizes the application of\nacademic knowledge. The activities include development of learning materials, redeployment\nand  training  of  teachers  in  the  application  of  activity-based  learning  including  monitoring,\nstudies, and evaluation of these activities. Multimedia rooms will be provided in 2,300 secondary\nschools to allow the use of television, VCRs, and audiocassettes for learning materials in key\nsubjects and digital reference materials. Teachers will be trained in the use of learning materials\nand in evaluating student day-to-day activities in the classroom for use in assessing proficiency\nat the end of the year for each grade and subject. About 30 schools in regional areas with", "14\nadjacent woodlands will be designated environmental learning parks and the staff provided\nequipment and training to conduct environmental studies.\nb. Computer Learning Centers\n43. As agreed upon by MEHE and ADB, this subcomponent will provide about 800 nationally\ntargeted secondary schools with CLCs for use in developing computer literacy and interactive\nlearning  in  core  subjects.  A  computer  literacy  syllabus  will  be  revised,12  introduced,  and\neventually made mandatory for A level students and will include IT and interactive learning in\nschool subjects as well as tutorials for national examinations. There will be civil works to convert\nschool  classrooms  to  CLCs;  furniture,  computer  equipment,  and  air  conditioners;  learning\nmaterials including software, digital library reference materials; consultancies, fellowships and\ntraining; and recurrent costs to run the CLCs during and after school hours. Depending on\nschool size, CLCs will be equipped with15, 20, or 25 computers each for use by two students.\nThe provincial education department, principal, and SDS will monitor computer usage on a fee\nbasis during and after school by the school and community.\n2. Access to Quality Instruction for Disadvantaged Students (Component 2)\na. Upgrading to Full-Curriculum Schools\n44. The subcomponent will improve the quality of science education throughout the country,\nparticularly at A level (Grades 12-13), through the extension of science laboratory facilities in\n100 schools in administrative divisions of the country currently lacking facilities. The objective is\nto provide A level science laboratories to the schools selected for upgrading in administrative\ndivisions where (i) no full-curriculum schools exist with grades 12-13 science laboratories; (ii)\nmore schools are needed to increase A level science laboratory facilities to satisfy gender and\nethnic  diversity;  (iii) science  laboratory  facilities  are  insufficient  to  meet  student  enrollment\ndemand; or (iv) grades 12-13 science laboratory facilities are inadequate in some existing full-\ncurriculum schools to meet grades 12-13 science student requirements. One science laboratory\nfor  biology  and  chemistry  and  one  for  physics  will  be  provided  along  with  furniture  and\nequipment. School surveys will determine the potential increase in access to upgraded schools.\nb. Stipends for Disadvantaged Students\n45. This  subcomponent  will  provide  targeted  interventions  to  allow  up  to  30,000\ndisadvantaged students to avail themselves of the expanded access by making it possible for\nstudents from poorer schools to attend upgraded, full-curriculum schools.  The transfer to full-\ncurriculum schools is likely to cause some economic stress to the students in the form of travel\ncosts to and from school. The disadvantaged students are also likely to face some academic\nstress in adapting to a strenuous and more demanding academic environment.  Stipends will be\ntargeted first at about 10,000 grades 10-11 academically qualified students from poor families\nwho can benefit from attending quality schools and receiving remedial instruction and tutorials.\nThey will help poor students to pass the grade 11 national examination. The second set of\nstipends (about 20,000) are awards for grades 12 and 13 academically qualified poor students\nin danger of not completing course work due to financial problems. The stipends will help\nensure that poor students complete grades 12-13.  The stipend amounts cover additional\n                                                \n12 Wyburn, D. and K. Karunanayake. 1999. Computer Studies. World Bank.", "15\ntransport, tutoring fees and supplementary books, and in some cases, boarding. The stipends\nwill be administered as a block grant to a school.\nc. Career Guidance for Educational Opportunities\n46. This  subcomponent  will  provide  all  grades  10-13  students  with  access  to  learning\nmaterials  including  video  cassettes  and  computer  software  to  increase  information  about\neducation and training as a means to income generation. Students will be made aware of the\ndiversity of career opportunities that exist and ways to acquire the skills needed to avail of these\nopportunities.  Career  guidance  will  especially  be  directed  at  girls  to  encourage  careers  in\nscience and commerce subjects that are currently not being adequately accessed by them. At\npresent, 560 schools have each been provided with a teacher trained in career guidance. The\nDepartment of Samurdi13 has assisted 250 of those schools with furniture for the use of the\nteacher and some information booklets. The subcomponent will supplement the existing career\nguidance program in the schools by providing studies, learning materials, and teacher training.\nd. Public-Private Partnerships and Secondary School Financing\n47. The country has exceptional achievement in making basic education accessible to all\nchildren of school age through an equitable system of education that is entirely state funded.\nHowever, to derive the benefits of a global economy, the focus of the education system needs\nto shift from inculcation of basic educational skills to developing a highly skilled manpower\ncapable of making the country competitive in the global economy.  The education system in its\npresent form is not equipped to aim for excellence through the quality of education that is being\noffered.  That there are schools offering better quality education than at present and that\nparents are willing to pay for this is evident from the very extensive demand for out-of-school\nsupplemental  tuition.    The  government  recognizes  the  need  to  encourage  public-private\npartnerships in education and there is a move toward a study and review of the legislation\nprohibiting private participation in education. The Project will support the implementation of such\na review and will conduct a study to explore the role that public-private partnerships can play in\neducation to revitalize the sector and make it competitive.\n3. Efficiency in Management and Supervision (Component 3)\na. Ministry of Education and Higher Education\n48. The subcomponent will assist with MEHE reorganization to (i) strengthen the school\nmanagement and supervision directorate to upgrade the line of command from the national,\nprovincial, zonal and divisional offices to support secondary education supervision; and (ii)\nestablish a separate SBM model for the secondary education system under the deputy director\ngeneral of quality assurance and management. Extensive training in SBM for principals, senior\nteachers, zonal education officers, and school management council representatives will be\nconducted, and workshops and seminars will ensure that various interventions under the Project\nincluding SBA, computer laboratories and multimedia rooms, career guidance, and stipend\nprograms are efficiently implemented and made sustainable.\n                                                \n13Department for the alleviation of poverty.", "16\nb. National Evaluation and Testing Service\n49. This subcomponent will strengthen NETS by providing additional resources to implement\nSBA in grades 10-13 through improved staffing, staff development, and legislative changes.\nImprovements will increase the capacity of NETS to reform the O and A level examinations by\nincluding item banking, test administration, grading, and scheduling leading to improved test\ndesign and administration. The introduction of SBA into grades 10-13 under the control of NETS\nis essential for improving classroom teaching, widening the learning outcomes of the students,\nand creating a more comprehensive measure of achievement. Training in SBA will help improve\nthe evaluation process and help teachers, students, and parents to realize the importance and\nvalue of schoolwork and study.\nc. National Institute of Education\n50. This subcomponent will strengthen the capacity of NIE to carry out curriculum and\ninstructional materials development, and in-service teacher training to implement innovations in\ngrades 10-13. Activities will include upgrading curricula and training secondary school teachers\nin selected curricula subjects especially in activity-based methodologies needed to strengthen\nSBA. Other training is in career guidance and computer education. Equipment will be provided\nto develop the new technology syllabi for introduction on a pilot basis to about 30 full-curriculum\nschools and the staff upgrading of two computer laboratories with new equipment for the NIE in-\nservice  training  computer  center.  An  office  and  equipment  for  copying  secondary  school\ncurricula off the Internet will be provided along with resources to download and transform these\nlearning materials into CD-ROM for distribution to schools.\nd. Project Management Office\n51. The PMO from the recently completed SEDP will be upgraded to take on a greater role\nin  managing  and  supervising  the  proposed  Project.  The  staff  of  the  existing  PMO  are\nconversant with ADB and Government procedures for foreign-aided projects and have the\nexperience to successfully implement the follow-up Project.\nC. Cost Estimates\n52. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $76.0 million equivalent, including taxes,\nduties, interest charge on the ADB loan, and physical and price contingencies. The foreign\nexchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $38.8  million  (51  percent),  and  the  local  currency  cost  is\nestimated at $37.2 million equivalent (49 percent) of the total cost. A summary of the cost\nestimates is in Table 1.", "17\nTable 1: Indicative Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nCategory                Foreign        Local Total\n              Exchange   Currency    Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n53. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $50.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds\nresources. ADB will finance 66 percent of the overall project cost, comprising 85 percent of the\nforeign exchange cost and 46 percent of the local currency cost of the Project. The ADB loan\nwill have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge at the\nrate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The\nNordic Development Fund (NDF) will provide a credit of $7.0 million equivalent as parallel and\ntied cofinancing for the Project.  NDF will finance consulting services, science equipment kits,\nand  science  equipment  for  grades  12  and  13.  The  Government  will  provide  $17.0  million\nequivalent mainly for a portion of the local currency costs of civil works, science equipment,\nlocal training, studies, project implementation, and O&M costs. SDSs will provide $2.0 million\nequivalent  for  operational  expenditure  for  the  multimedia  rooms  and  the  CLCs  (electricity\ncharges,  school  security,  and  furniture  for  the  multimedia  rooms).  The  financing  plan  is\nsummarized in Table 2 and details are in Appendix 4.", "18\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n    Foreign          Local Total Percent\nSource Exchange       Currency Cost\nADB      32.8 17.2 50.0    66\nNDF                   6.0   1.0   7.0      9\nGovernment        0.0  17.0 17.0    22\nBeneficiariesa        0.0   2.0   2.0      3\nTotal       38.8  37.2 76.0  100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, NDF = Nordic Development Fund.\na School development societies.\n54. The proposed level of local currency financing by ADB takes into account the uncertain\nmedium-term economic prospects of the country and the Government\u2019s continuing inability to\nself finance a substantial portion of the investment program required to enable Sri Lanka to\nundergo social and economic transformation and to reduce the high rates of poverty.  Between\n1994 and 1999, the Government succeeded in reducing the budget deficit from 10.5 percent of\nGDP to 8.0 percent.  A significant reduction in outlays was also achieved through the retirement\nof the public debt in 1997 using privatization proceeds.  In 1997 and again in 1998, the\nGovernment counterguaranteed private sector borrowing on the international market under\nADB\u2019s guarantee scheme.  Future efforts to improve fiscal performance include additional\ndivestiture,  establishment  of  a  Revenue  Protection  Unit  to  improve  tax  collection,  and\nappointment of an independent committee to review public sector salaries.  Despite these\nactions, the overall capacity of the Government to self-finance the public sector investment\nprogram in the coming years is still limited as debt servicing and costs related to the ongoing\ncivil conflict continue to absorb about 50 percent of budget outlays.  The proposed level of local\ncost financing for the Project is therefore considered justified in view of the prevailing difficult\ncountry circumstances and the expected positive impact on poverty reduction.  In addition, local\ncurrency financing for classroom civil works and school learning materials is justified over the\nshort term to give the Government time to improve the efficiency of public expenditures and\nprivate sector participation in revenue-generating education sector projects.\nE. The Executing Agency\n55. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education will be the Executing Agency. The inter-\nministerial  steering  committee  under  the  chairmanship  of  the  secretary  of  MEHE  will  be\nresponsible for policy guidance, coordination, and implementation of the Project. It will be\nestablished within 3 months after the effectiveness date. MEHE staff on the committee include\nthe project director of PMO (recording secretary), additional secretaries (educational reform,\nplanning  and  educational  development),  deputy  director  generals,  quality\nassurance/management  and  school  organization.  Other  institutions  represented  are  the\ncommissioner general of NETS and the director general of NIE, representatives from MOFP\nincluding the national planning, and external resource departments and provincial education\ndepartments (PEDs). The steering committee will meet at least four times each year to review\nprogress implementation, ensure that resources are made available in a timely manner, monitor\nkey policy decisions, and coordinate between MEHE, NETS, NIE, and PEDs.", "19\n56. The PMO in MEHE, established for the ADB Secondary Education Development Project,\nwill be retained and expanded. It will be responsible for day-to-day operations of the Project. It\nwill be headed by a project director and will include, on a full-time basis, an accountant, a\ndeputy/assistant director, administration officer, engineer, procurement officer, and adequate\nsupport staff. The PMO will undertake activities in 2000 to ensure that the Project begins full\noperation by the time of loan effectiveness, which is expected in December 2000, so that the\nProject can be completed in five years. The preliminary activities in 2000 include (i) preparing\nschool proposals for about 200 secondary schools by involving principals and zonal officers to\ntake project ownership, (ii) preparing consulting services contracts so bidding can be carried out\nwithin  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  and  (iii)  preparing  civil  works  and  procurement\npackages for the first set of 200 schools to be provided CLCs and multimedia rooms during the\nfirst year of project implementation.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Implementation Period\n57. The Project will be implemented over a period of five years commencing January 2001,\nwith Project completion by the end of 2005. The PMO from SEDP will be retained and made\nfully operational by 1 October 2000.  Under SEDP, project implementation went well and the\nPMO staff were retained for the Project. The indicative implementation schedule is in Appendix\n5.\n2. Procurement\na. Civil Works\n58. All  civil  works  contracts  under  the  Project  will  be  awarded  under  local  competitive\nbidding (LCB) among prequalified contractors in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard\nprocurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Civil  works  will  involve  the  rehabilitation  and\nconversion of about 3,000 classrooms into multimedia rooms and CLCs, and rehabilitation of\nthe PMO.  About 100 secondary schools will be upgraded to full-curriculum schools with science\nlaboratories, with at least two science rooms provided where necessary.   The civil works are\nsmall  and  scattered  throughout  the  country  and  are  not  likely  to  attract  the  interest  of\ninternational bidders. The PMO will be responsible for monitoring quality control, costs, and\nimplementation.  The proposed procurement packages and their estimated costs are shown in\nAppendix 6.\nb. Equipment\n59. School  equipment  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),\ninternational shopping (IS), or direct purchase (DP), as applicable, in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. The Project will finance the procurement of standard packages of\nscience equipment for grades 10-13 science laboratories for the upgraded schools (to be fully\nprovided by the Government for grades 10-11, and by NDF for grades 12-13, and additional\npackages of grades 12-13 science kits), televisions, VCRs, and radio cassette players for\nmultimedia  rooms,  computers,  printers,  and  air  conditioners  for  computer  laboratories;\ntelephone/faxes for schools and zonal offices; and furniture, equipment, vehicles, and recurrent\nbudget for PMO, NETS, NIE, and MEHE. Computer equipment will be procured in packages\ndivided by geographic region and phased to meet schedules as schools are identified, and", "20\ncomputer and multimedia laboratories become available. Supply contracts for MEHE, NETS,\nand NIE equipment costing $500,000 or less will follow IS or DP as applicable (Appendix 6).\nc. Learning Materials\n60. Learning  materials  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nProcurement. The Project will finance the purchase of textbooks and learning materials for\ngrades 10-13, computer software, video and audio cassettes, library books, teacher guides and\nstudent  laboratory  manuals.  As  the  estimated  package  costs  are  less  than  $500,000,\nprocurement will follow IS or DP as applicable.  Grades 12-13 print materials, career guidance\nmaterials, and evaluation and testing materials may be procured locally in accordance with the\nGovernment\u2019s standard procedures acceptable to ADB as these items are small and available\nlocally (Appendix 6).\nd. Consulting Services\n61. The project will provide 373 person-months of consulting services (190 international and\n183 domestic). The terms of reference for the consultants will be agreed upon by NDF, the\nGovernment, and ADB. With NDF cofinancing of consulting services, the consultants will be\nengaged by MEHE in accordance with the applicable guidelines of NDF.14 ADB prepared the\nterms  of  reference  and  will  review  any  changes  prior  to  invitation  of  the  proposals.  The\nconsultants will assist with institutional strengthening of NETS, NIE, and MEHE, and will provide\nassistance to NETS to improve efficiency in day-to-day operations in developing and managing\nthe examination system, introducing SBA and conducting research to improve examination\nadministration procedures.  NIE will require consultants to develop and implement activity-based\nexercises in core academic subjects that will be linked to SBA and reported back to parents and\nstudents.  Subjects include science and technology, mathematics, English, and agricultural\ntechnology including provision of CLC hardware and software and training. MEHE consultants\nwill assist in setting up school management systems and training principals, teachers, and SDS\nleaders. The number of consultants is considered the minimum necessary to develop and\nimplement the new programs in career guidance, computer education, SBA, and SBM.  MEHE\nwill require consultants to assist in the development of the SBM system and to train national,\nprovincial and local administrators, principals and teachers, and SDS representatives.  The\nrequired consulting services and the terms of reference are in Appendix 7.\ne.  Staff Training and Development\n62. The Project will finance a total of 48 person-months of study visits for 88 persons, and\n211 person-months of international fellowships for 93 persons.  The Project will provide funding\nfor about 19,000 person-months of in-country training, workshops for about 110,000 education\nstaff, and about 30,000 scholarships for disadvantaged students in grades 10-13 according to\nthe indicative numbers in Appendix 8.  MEHE will ensure that the candidates selected for the\noverseas study visits and fellowships satisfy the criteria agreed upon by the Government and\nADB.  The Government will ensure that the overseas study visits and fellowships are provided\nto  candidates  in  accordance  with  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.    In  accordance  with\nstandard  Government  procedures,  ADB  will  be  provided  with  (i)  a  list  of  the  nominated\ncandidates, (ii) candidates\u2019 qualifications, (iii) nominated institutions, and (iv) detailed costs of\n                                                \n14 Other examples of projects with tied cofinancing for consulting services include Loan 1707-SRI(SF): Skills\nDevelopment Project, for $18.8 million, approved on 28 October 1999, and Loan 1637-MLD(SF): Postsecondary\nEducation Development Project, for $6.3 million, approved on 30 September 1998.", "21\nthe approved courses.  The Government will adapt a strict system of selection and bonding for\nthis training to ensure that the recipients continue their services in related positions for a\nreasonable period of time upon completion of the training.  Overseas fellowships and study\nvisits will be administered by the PMO.  MEHE will ensure that local training is provided to\ncandidates in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB and that the candidates satisfy\nthe criteria agreed upon by the Government and ADB. Student stipends will be approved by the\nPMO and administered by school principals through block grants for transport, learning material,\nand tuition payments.  The procedures for selecting the participants will be prepared by the\nPMO and submitted to ADB during inception.\n3. Disbursements, Reports, Accounts, and Auditing\n63. To expedite implementation through the timely release of ADB\u2019s share of funds for\neligible expenditures, an imprest account (I/A) for the Project will be established in the Central\nBank  of  Sri  Lanka  in  Colombo.  The  I/A  will  be  operated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Loan\nDisbursement Handbook dated June 1996 and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the\nGovernment and ADB. The initial deposit to the I/A will not exceed the equivalent of $2.0 million.\nStatement of expenditures (SOE) procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook will be used for claiming replenishment and liquidating expenditures paid out of the\nI/A and for reimbursing expenditures under contracts not exceeding $100,000. The I/A and SOE\nprocedures will be audited as part of the regular audit of the Project\u2019s account and financial\nstatements, and audit opinion on the I/A and SOE should be set out separately.\n64. The Government, acting through MEHE, will maintain records and accounts adequate to\nidentify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the loan. These procedures will be\nreviewed thoroughly during the Inception Mission. MEHE will maintain separate accounts for the\nProject and ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually in accordance\nwith sound accounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited\naccounts will be submitted to ADB within 12 months after the close of each fiscal year. The\nPMO will prepare quarterly reports on Project implementation and submit them to ADB within 30\ndays of each quarter. The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and will indicate, among\nother things, (i) progress against established targets; (ii) status of performance indicators; (iii)\nproblems  encountered  during  the  quarter,  and  steps  taken  to  resolve  the  problems;  (iv)\ncompliance with loan covenants; and (v) program activities proposed for the following quarter.\nThe PMO will also prepare a project completion report and submit it to ADB not later than three\nmonths following the physical completion of the Project.\n4. Project Performance\na.  Annual Operational Plans\n65. By December of each year of project implementation, MEHE will provide ADB with an\nannual operation plan for the following fiscal year.  The plan will include (i) data on the proposed\nallocations to secondary education including certification that the Government has allocated\nadequate resources; (ii) status of agreed-upon policy reforms and covenants; (iii) fully costed\nproposed project activities for each subcomponent, with performance targets; and (iv) a list of\nsecondary schools targeted for upgrading during the year and for establishment of multimedia\nrooms and CLCs. The plan will also provide estimates of the O&M budget and ensure that\nadequate counterpart funds are provided.", "22\nb.  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n66. An adequately developed monitoring and evaluation system will be installed in MEHE\nand accessed through PMO to evaluate beneficiaries, improve management information, and\nassess the impact of the Project on the improvement of secondary schooling.  Monitoring will\ninclude  accurate  indicators  of  school  enrollments,  teacher  deployment,  examination  results\nincluding SBA, implementation and impact status of school management councils and SBM,\ntraining of principals and teachers in secondary schools for career guidance, and teacher\nsupervision of computer laboratories and multimedia rooms. A baseline for project inputs for the\n800 project schools will be prepared at the time of school selection. MEHE will monitor and\nevaluate the benefits of the Project after completion in accordance with the schedule and terms\nof reference to be agreed upon by the Government and ADB (Appendix 9).\n67. To supplement continuous routine monitoring and supervision, ADB will conduct an\nannual review of Project performance during each Review Mission.  The review will include an\nexamination  of  the  budgetary  allocations,  O&M  costs,  staffing  and  other  incremental\nrequirement costs, implementation arrangements, and achievements under the Project.\n68. A midterm review (MTR) will be carried out jointly by the Government, ADB, and NDF\nduring the third year of implementation and will focus on the accomplishment of the project\nobjectives, policy, scope, and direction of project impact as indicated by monitoring indicators.\n5. Selection Criteria for Targeted Interventions\n69. A final list of 1,120 secondary schools was identified, in consultation with the provincial\neducation offices, to fit the criteria for CLCs:\n(i) available full size classroom for conversion,\n(ii) available full-time teacher to manage the computer laboratory,\n(iii) agreement to include computer technology program as an A level subject, and\n(iv) available assured supply of electricity and a security watchman.\n70. The list of project schools is fixed and changes may be made only by MEHE with the\napproval of ADB. Before each school on the list is allowed to participate in the Project, school\nprincipals, district zonal officers, and SDS representatives will be asked to develop a proposal\nhighlighting the school\u2019s need for a computer and multimedia center to improve learning.  The\nproposal will help ensure school ownership through the SBM. The PMO has already prepared\nand translated a questionnaire (Appendix 10), and piloted it in 105 schools. The PMO will review\nthe  proposals  and  prepare  200-300  secondary  schools  annually  to  establish  computer\nlaboratories and multimedia rooms. The first 200 schools are expected to be approved and civil\nworks  and  installation  of  equipment  completed  by  the  end  of  the  first  year  of  project\nimplementation.\n71. About  100  secondary  schools  in  divisions  with  no  full-curriculum  schools  will  be\nupgraded to include grades 12-13 science courses. These schools will require provision of one\nschool laboratory for biology and chemistry, and one for physics. The schools have already\nbeen tentatively selected in the project formulation process and the provincial authorizes will\nhave to guarantee both available enrollments and teachers before the PMO contracts for civil\nworks or procurement. These 100 schools are a subset of the 800 schools chosen for CLCs and\nmultimedia rooms. The criteria for selection for upgrading follow:", "23\n(i) existing full-curriculum school outside the administrative division of the school in\nquestion, except in the case of other schools in the division that are already\nsaturated;\n(ii) available science teachers redeployed to school; and\n(iii) a minimum of 15 students for each additional science section in the first year of\noperation.\n72. The Government has provided academic scholarships based on merit for a long time\nand the program has remained popular. Under the Project, stipends will be provided to grades\n10-13 students who qualify both academically and financially. The stipends will cover transport,\ntutoring, and other fees related to student transfers to nearby schools providing a wider choice\nof subjects. The stipends will serve as a one-time intervention under the Project to boost access\nfor poor students, but if evaluation of the program finds it successful, recommendations will be\nmade to continue it. The stipends will be administered through block grants to recipient schools,\nwhich will set aside a few places and identify students based on the following criteria:\n(i) Means test indicates the family of student is below the poverty line;\n(ii) Student is academically qualified; and\n(iii) The  available  school  is  within  the  administrative  division  or  the  immediate\nneighboring division.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental\n73. Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no  significant  adverse  environmental\nimpacts were identified. MEHE will ensure that the location, design, construction, and operation\nof the science laboratories to be established under the Project follow ADB\u2019s Environmental\nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The Project will involve no resettlement or land\nacquisition.  The  design  and  location  of  classroom  rehabilitation  will  consider  measures  to\nmaximize the use of natural light, air flow, heat dispersion and water availability; and to minimize\nmaintenance costs. The PMO may employ consultant architects and engineers to review the\nschool designs to improve their quality and to allow better space utilization. The curriculum\ncontent of science and technology courses in grades 12-13 have been adapted to include\nenvironmental studies and experiments testing for air and water pollution. The grades 12-13\nbiology and chemistry program also includes developing up to 30 secondary schools adjacent to\nforest preserves to serve as nature centers for school on-site field studies for students to learn\nabout conservation of natural resources, pollution control, and sustainable nature reserves.\n2. Social Analysis\n74. Social assessments under the technical assistance (TA) and information gathered from\ninterviews and analyses under SEDP and during the Fact-Finding Mission field visits indicate\nthat females are well represented in the school system. About 60 percent are in secondary\nschools and their pass rate in national examinations is higher than that of boys. About 65\npercent of secondary schoolteachers are female. Females often find it difficult to relocate to\nremote  schools,  thus  contributing  to  the  shortage  of  qualified  teachers  available  for\nredeployment to rural areas.\n75. Schools in Sri Lanka cater to clearly defined ethnic and cultural clientele within a given\ngeographic area. In rural areas, poverty is severe especially in the hill plantation regions in the", "24\ncenter of the country where many families do not own land, and poverty is widespread. The\nprovinces suffering from greatest poverty as measured by the United Nation\u2019s Human Poverty\nIndex, include Eastern, Central, Uva, and Sabaragamuwa. Deprivation is measured in terms of\nlack of access to electricity, potable water, health care, and good schools. Government surveys\nsuggest that families residing in poor areas prefer to migrate to towns and urban centers once\nthey attain marketable skills. Because education is near universal for students up to age 15 or\n16, the poor still attend school but are in danger of dropping out when they do poorly on the\ngrade 11 national examination.  Monitoring the number of additional students passing the\nnational examinations at age 16 and 18 will indicate the Project\u2019s effectiveness and demonstrate\nhow changes in the pass rates affect individual earnings and reduce poverty. Measures of\nstipend program success can also provide information on poverty reduction.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Financial and Economic Analyses\n76. Sri Lanka has done well in keeping students in school through grade 11, but not in\nensuring that they learn well or learn relevant materials.  Consequently, the quality of education\nhas suffered and put youth at risk of being unemployable in the modern economy.  As the global\nand  national  economy  improve,  the  demand  for  educated  employment  will  increase  and\nstudents will have more and more opportunities for modern employment in the private sector\nonly if they can communicate well, and possess quantitative and analytical reasoning skills to\nsolve problems posed in the modern workplace. As the country must compete more efficiently in\nthe regional and global economy, the youth need education geared to improving language skills,\ncomputer  skills  and  science  and  mathematical  skills  needed  to  expand  opportunities  and\nmobility. Higher pass rates on national examinations can help certify to the quality of what was\nlearned in school.\n77.  The major benefit arising from the Project is the additional students who successfully\ncomplete grades 11 and 13 examinations. Success will lead to higher income and perhaps an\nopportunity to continue their education. Increased earnings in a competitive labor market are\ntaken as a proxy for the incremental social benefit in the economic analysis. The incremental\nincome received by a successful grade 13 examination candidate is the value to the economy of\nthe successful candidate whether or not the candidate continues schooling. It is estimated that\n225,000 students or about two in every three students fail to qualify to enter grade 12 annually\nand are prevented from continuing their formal education. To meet the educational requirements\nof  the  modern  economy,  the  education  system  will  have  to  improve  internal  efficiency  by\nincreasing the number of grade 11 successful examinees by 500,000 over a period of 12 years\n(100,000 in the first four years of the Project and 400,000 in the following eight years). As\nstandards cannot be lowered without jeopardizing the credibility of the examination system,\nincreases in percentages qualifying to enter grade 12 will have to come from improved test\nscores as a result of improved classroom learning due to better teacher pedagogy, improved\nlearning materials and activities, and continuous student assessment.\n78. The economic analysis is found in Appendix 11. For the base case, the rate of return is\n16 percent. The major assumptions are provided in Table A11.1. The analysis is sensitive to the\npercentage of students qualifying to enter grade 12 because the cost remains unchanged, while\nthe benefit from incremental earnings either falls or increases with the pass rates. The high\nsensitivity to the pass rate means that the project management must pay very close attention to\nefforts to improve the quality of instruction so that the anticipated pass rates are achieved.", "25\nImproved  quality  inputs  to  academic  learning,  along  with  SBA  weighted  in  the  national\nexamination appear to be sufficient to boost the pass rates to meet the project targets. The rate\nof return is not sensitive to small changes in assumptions on earnings or incremental changes in\nproject costs.\n79. The Project is easily sustainable. Improvements in internal efficiency of the secondary\nschool  system  pay  large  dividends  to  the  many  who  will  pass  the  grades  11  and  13\nexaminations  as  a  result  of  quality  improvements.    The  Project  emphasizes  quality\nimprovements.  Reductions in dropout and repetition will eliminate wastage.  The Project will not\nbuild new facilities but will upgrade existing facilities, which will reduce O&M costs. After the\nimplementation period, the recurrent costs of the Project including full funding of the incremental\nstipends in the Project will amount to SLRs167.4 million ($2.2 million). In contrast, the total\nGovernment expenditure on education in 1998 was about SLRs26,500 million ($363 million), of\nwhich recurrent expenditure totaled about SLRs20,500 ($280 million). The recurrent cost of the\nProject including new staff for NETS and full-curriculum schools stipends amount to only 0.6\npercent of the total Government recurrent expenditure on education. As the stipend program is\nunlikely to continue after the Project, the recurrent cost of the Project slips to 0.3 percent of the\ntotal Government recurrent expenditure on education. If recurrent costs of secondary education\nalone are used as a base comparison, then the recurrent cost of the Project excluding stipends\nrises again to 0.6 percent of the secondary school recurrent budget.\n80. Cost recovery for the CLCs is seen as the major means to reduce the incremental\nrecurrent cost after project completion. The CLCs will require about $1.0 million, or about\n$1,250 for each of the 800 CLCs, to operate each year. Calculations were made to charge\nSLRs1,000 ($14) annually to students for after-school programs to cover the costs of electricity\nand teacher salary. In school, students will pay a facility fee of about SLRs75 ($1.00) per\nacademic year. Fees are sufficient to cover O&M of CLCs, given the numbers expected to use\nthe laboratories after school, along with the number of in-school grades 12-13 students using\nCLCs. Each CLC can operate 1,250 hours per year at a unit cost of $1.00 per hour, which\nrepresents a reasonable unit cost for the given educational technology. Outright purchase of\ncomputers as opposed to leasing is most cost-effective as computers for school use can be\nutilized up to eight years before replacement, and school ownership of computers represents an\nasset for the community.\n1. Beneficiaries\n81. Up  to  one  million  students  attending  grades  10-13  each  year  will  benefit  from  the\nprogram over the five-year project period and the subsequent five-year period after project\ncompletion.  These  students  will  improve  classroom  learning  in  core  subjects  of  English,\nmathematics, science, and computer education that will provide them marketable skills after\ngraduation.  The  Project  will  also  improve  equity  in  access  to  wider  curriculum  choice  by\nensuring that there are schools in every division that provide science and commerce courses for\nstudents. In poor areas, qualified students from poor families will be given stipends to support\ncosts in transferring to quality schools nearby. Up to 5,000 poor students are expected to benefit\nfrom the program to upgrade schools each year, improving their chances to pass the national\nexamination.  Career  education  will  provide  marketable  information  and  knowledge  about\neducation and work to students, thereby equalizing access to information about jobs. The\nProject will also provide improved tracking of students through the education system via career\nguidance, and SBA that yields close students-teacher interaction.", "26\n82. Up to 30,000 disadvantaged students in grades 11 to 13 will benefit from the stipend\nprogram to allow qualified students in grade 11 to receive tutoring and extra assistance to\nimprove their studies and/or to transfer to nearby schools with facilities. The stipends are\nexpected to result in increased pass rates for qualified students who would otherwise not have\nthe opportunity to study in good schools. A smaller number of stipends will be awarded to\nstudents who pass the grade 11 national examination but lack resources to attend grades 12\nand 13. The purpose is to ensure that qualified students who cannot afford further schooling do\nnot drop out.\n83. Finally, the Project will provide the Government with resources to identify options to\nreduce expenditures for secondary education through public-private participation in secondary\nschooling. This innovation is expected to allow some schools eventually to opt out of the public\neducation system and in so doing free up additional funds for the remaining public schools.\n84. About 40,000 secondary school teachers will benefit from training; about 15,000 of them\nwill receive advanced training in career guidance, computer education, and improved classroom\nteaching  methodologies  in  science  and  technology,  mathematics,  English,  and  commerce\ncourses. Training in instructional delivery will support the SBA system that requires teachers to\ngrade student academic performance on a weekly basis to supplement the national examination\nscore.  About 3,000 principals, zonal education officers, and SDS leaders will be provided\nongoing training in SBM to improve their ability to develop and monitor the school academic\nenvironment. With the advent of SBA, computer training, multimedia approaches to learning\nEnglish, mathematics, science, and commerce, and introduction of career guidance and stipend\nprograms to attract poor students, school administrators will have to improve their supervision of\nthese programs. Finally, supervision and quality assurance staff at MEHE, test developers,\nadministrators and markers at NETS and in-service teacher trainers at NIE will be provided\nresources to do their jobs more efficiently.\n2. Institutional Benefits\n85. MEHE will benefit from the Project through support for its restructuring already under\nway. The Quality Assurance Division that includes support for supervision from the province to\nthe zonal levels and into schools will be given training and resources to strengthen ongoing\nsupervision. The division will be strengthened with the addition of a quality assurance unit to\ndevelop and implement a SBM system that links zonal education offices with principals and the\ncommunity. SBM is intended to provide a degree of decentralization to secondary schools so\nthat management decisions for day-to-day school operations can be made in the field. As\nschool  enrollments  decline,  surplus  secondary  school  teachers  will  be  reassigned  to  do\nguidance and counseling and handle computer education. Other teachers will improve their\npedagogical skills to ensure that they do not become obsolete.\n86. NETS is undergoing institutional reform to move toward an examination system that\nprovides useful feedback in a timely manner to all students, regardless of whether they will\ncontinue education or enter the workforce. A reliable and legitimate national testing system is\nthe basis of public confidence in the education system and therefore has to be strengthened.\nThe use of SBA carried out in schools throughout the year will give importance to student effort.\nAdministrative efficiency in examination reform will reduce time wasted waiting for examination\nresults and subsequent placement by up to six months. This has economic consequences as\nstudents do not have to wait around before continuing their classes. NETS will benefit from the\nProject as the expanded staff are trained and operations are improved to provide greater\nefficiency and autonomy to the institution.", "27\n87. NIE will benefit from the Project as in-service training related to curriculum subjects is\nintensified and resources are provided to improve the application of theory to practice in the\nclassroom. The introduction of computer education in secondary schools will require follow-up\ntraining of teachers in software and pedagogy. NIE will build its capacity to service computer\neducation and provide software on a regular basis.\n88. All secondary schools nationwide will benefit from improvements to the curriculum and\nteaching, examination reform, and SBM. Over 800 of the 2,300 schools will benefit from specific\ninterventions in the application of computer centers and stipend programs, while an additional\n100 schools will benefit from upgrading the curriculum to include science subjects.\n3. Efficiency Benefits\n89. The efficiency of the secondary education system will improve as a result of the Project.\nImproved test administration will lead to faster turnaround in disseminating test results and\nplacement, reducing the time by six months for grade 11 examinees and by 12 months for grade\n13 examinees.  The introduction of SBA will make assessment fairer as classroom performance\nwill  count  toward  the  national  examination.  Another  social  justification  besides  improved\nacademic  test  performance  is  the  value  of  useful  computer  and  language  skills  to  give\nsecondary school graduates access to knowledge and information. This will help narrow the\ndigital divide between communities. Career guidance programs will also provide students with\ninformation leading to greater education and occupation opportunities. Equity programs that\nallow students greater choice and mobility in attending schools are also seen as promoting\nsystem  flexibility  to  allow  greater  access  to  improved  schooling.  Finally,  improved  school\nadministration  especially  in  school  supervision  and  SBM  is  expected  to  increase  local\nadministrative efficiency, which is essential to a modern school system.\n90. The increase in learning as a result of quality inputs and improved access to full-\ncurriculum schools by the poor is expected to increase the number of students qualifying to\nenter grade 12 by 50,000 each year over a base pass rate of 125,000. The increase is about 40\npercent per year by project completion. This measure can serve as an indicator of system\nefficiency due to the Project. The increase in the number of students qualifying to enter grade\n12 can be absorbed into grades 12-13 without much effort because the current teacher/student\nratio in grades 12-13 is only 1:22 and can easily be adjusted up to 40 percent over five years of\nproject implementation to about 1:30. As system efficiency improves, repeaters who sit in grade\n13  will  also  decrease,  thereby  providing  greater  capacity  to  accommodate  the  expected\nincrease. Overall, system internal efficiency will improve.\nB. Impact on Poverty\n91. Approximately  21  percent  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  population  live  in  absolute  poverty.  This\npercentage has not declined appreciably over the last decade despite efforts to address equity.\nThis lack of impact may be due in part to earlier efforts that were not socially targeted and in\npart to the civil conflict that has displaced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes\nand source of livelihood. In 1998 the Government with the assistance of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank undertook an extensive poverty study.\nThe results show that rural poverty continues to be quantitatively and qualitatively worse than\nurban poverty and that people who live in poverty work in low-skill and low-paying occupations.\nIt appears that while Central, North Central, Uva, and Sabaragamuwa provinces have the\ndeepest poverty, nonetheless, all districts (21 of 25) except five in Western Province combined", "28\nwith Matale district appear below the national average.15 Appendix 12 presents the general\npoverty analysis and project impact.\n92. The economic justification for investing in poverty reduction is both long and short term.\nIn the long term, future generations will have the learning skills to compete in the labor market at\nhome  and  abroad.  The  secondary  school  system  will  be  strengthened  to  show  improved\nefficiency in test administration, administrative supervision, and SBM that promotes school and\ncommunity leadership. In the short term, the Project aims to promote greater access to quality\nsecondary education, and this is expected to increase the number of students successfully\ncompleting  the  O  level  examination  and  continuing  to  grade  12.  Streamlining  the  O  level\nexamination process including bringing forward A level examinations and speeding up the\ngrading of O levels will cut the waiting period to five months between grades 11 and 12. Finally,\nSBM pays dividends to better governance as principals and parents, respectively, take greater\nresponsibility for the day-to-day teaching and learning of students. As internal rates of return to\ncompletion of O and A level learning are significantly higher than those for noncompletion, the\npotential  return  to  improved  internal  school  efficiency  is  large  and  the  poor  will\ndisproportionately benefit from these improvements, given their exposure to low levels of quality\neducation. Also, the poor will benefit greatly from improved schooling that allows them mobility\nout of depressed economic areas.\nC. Risks\n93. The Project is designed to specifically help achieve the Government\u2019s secondary school\nreforms to improve quality, access and efficiency. Commitment at the national level is strong\ndespite  the  civil  conflict  that  threatens  public  security.  However,  specific  reforms  requiring\nreorganization of secondary school administration and additional principal and teacher efforts\ndirected at evaluating student achievements may meet with initial resistance from teachers who\nfear an additional workload. The introduction of SBA in grades 6-9 received a mixed reaction,\nwith teachers agreeing with the need but finding the additional burden of time constraining.\nModifications have been made and under the Project intensive training and follow-up will be\nprovided to ensure that teachers are prepared to undertake SBA. Once teacher assessment is\nincluded in the national examination score, parents, students, and teachers will begin to see the\nvalue of the additional assessment and this should lead to overall support. A second risk has to\ndo  with  the  move  to  greater  decentralization  at  the  provincial  and  school  level.  Greater\ndecentralization  will  require  greater  administrative  capacity.  The  Project  proposes  the\nestablishment of a secondary education unit within MEHE to provide increased coordination so\nthat NETS and NIE are able to accommodate teacher training and that PMO can administer\nblock grants for school stipends and involve the community in decisions to establish and support\nCLCs in project schools. As Sri Lanka moves toward introducing IT and interactive learning,\nresource planning at the school level will be required. Under the Project, principals and teachers\nwill be trained, and SBM will be strengthened to ensure local financial support for these new\ntechnologies. Service contracting by suppliers will also ensure computer maintenance.\n                                                \n15ADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Emergency Rehabilitation in NE Province Social Impact Analysis Report confirms high poverty in\nthese districts as well.", "29\nVI.

Description of Project Interventions\n3. Curriculum  Materials  and  School-Based  Assessment.  The  Project  will  provide\nconsultants to develop materials and activities for key subject areas that will allow students to\nbe graded by teachers, with coursework used for national evaluation at the end of grades 11\nand 13. Grade 11 materials will include learning activities in English and mathematics. Learning\nactivities for grade 13 will include special laboratory and computer activities in science, English,\nmathematics, and commerce. Grade 13 will include textbooks, as these are not used in grades\n12-13. Multimedia rooms will be established by renovating existing classrooms and providing\nthem with electricity, security, and furniture for teachers to use multimedia materials such as\ntelevision, video, and audio cassettes to practice language instruction, commerce, mathematics,\nand  career  guidance.  Policies  enacted  include  making  career  guidance  and  school-based\nassessment (SBA) mandatory in secondary education.\n4. Computer  Learning  Centers  (CLCs).  CLCs  are  a  major  innovation  to  introduce\ncomputer  literacy  including  information  technology  (IT)  and  interactive  instruction  using\ncomputers. Existing classrooms will be converted to CLCs and provided with security bars and\ndoor,  electric  wiring,  carpeting,  air  conditioning  and  furniture.  The  laboratory  have  15-25\ncomputers with compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM) depending on the size of the school,\nwith two students sharing a computer. There will be one central computer and two printers.\nCapacity for networking computers and the Internet will be included but not installed initially until\nthe CLCs are fully functioning and sustainable. Software (in English) will include windows and\nseveral  spread-sheets  along  with  an  array  of  computer  software  educational  games  and\nreference materials in the key subjects. A full-time professional staff will be assigned to manage\nthe laboratory and one or more grade 13 students waiting for examination results will be\nemployed on a volunteer basis to assist in day-to-day operational management. A fee of SLRs7\nper month will be levied for each student using the facilities. After-school use of computers for IT", "42\nAppendix 3, page 4\nwill be allowed for a fee of SLRs500 per month. Proceeds will be used to pay for electricity and\nmaintenance of equipment and materials. Policies being considered include making computer\ncourses mandatory for grades 12-13 students.\n5. Stipend Program.   The Project includes stipends of up to SLRs10,000 for grades 10-11\nand  13,000  for  grades  12-13  per  year  for  tuition,  fees,  transport,  books  and  lodging  (in\nexceptional cases). Funds for stipends will be administered by schools under the supervision of\nthe principal and awarded to disadvantaged students based on economic means testing and\nacademic ability. Means testing will be based on minimum family income determined by the\nproject steering committee. Preference will be given to students in grades 10-11 with excellent\nattendance and scholarship in grade 9. The stipend program will also accommodate students\nwho pass the grade 11 national examination but are in danger of not continuing grade 12 due to\nfinancial reasons. Students in newly established full-curriculum schools and in limited-curriculum\nschools will be given priority over students in existing full-curriculum schools.  Among the\npolicies  to  be  proposed  will  be  enactment  of  special  stipend  programs  for  disadvantaged\nstudents  in  danger  of  dropping  out  of  school  after  successfully  completing  the  O  level\nexamination.\n6. Public-Private Partnerships.  The concept is new in Sri Lanka and studies to support a\npolicy framework is needed to estimate savings from prospective schools that plan to opt out of\nthe  present  system.  A  second  study  phase  would  review  the  findings  of  the  government\nrecommendations and plan pilot programs to initiate interventions. Policies being considered\ninclude the allowing public-private partnerships in secondary education.\n7. Quality Assurance.  Within MEHE a unit to monitor quality assessment especially\nthrough a SBM system will be established. This unit will be within the MEHE hierarchy but will\nhave specific mandate to implement SBM and to strengthen the national, provincial, and local\nchain of command through training and programs to give more day-to-day operational authority\nto local school principals, SDSs, and zonal education offices. Policies being considered include\nMEHE  restructuring  to  include  a  quality  assurance  unit  and  support  for  giving  operational\nauthority to school principals, zonal education officers, and SDSs.\n8. National  Evaluation  Testing  Service  Restructuring.  For  NETS  to  carry  out  its\nassigned  tasks  of  SBA  and  examination  reform,  new  staff  and  resources  are  required  to\nstrengthen its day-to-day operations and management.  Policies enacted include revision of the\nAct establishing NETS to make it autonomous and to bolster professionalization of the staff.\n9. Surveys  and  Studies.    The  PMO  will  undertake  several  surveys  to  monitor  and\nevaluate programs introduced under the Project. These include career guidance, and SBA and\nSBM training.  The PMO will also undertake several studies to determine the best role for\npublic-private partnerships and to evaluate stipend programs and upgraded school programs.", "DETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'000)\nFGHICDEABte........mS23123I122F1SIS12C1Cnn............uttuoicsaivrprnrtOSECSSSLDSFISIPEDfinvrnnelfesau uexuuuuuqri eeoop-tmWntDuoenCrtrucysunbbbbbmeendvjlrdeeieitssootrrtttttngrpiieisi atooooovcenntcuonrAuanmrsete ttttttkatnunritg a caaaaataoi aelMeslitcoVqoan clllllrlnnSnt     ny ulpade(i((((R d otAeFHaEBaiMnhm s neElrn)S))))aiivacctdeqiugliotu necupeeMnrsteiermrpaisreamevinnlinsstteet i onCnOntoaffnsicctee EF21x1o0381163c,,,,,,,r,h314267714ea273043393ing00080006000200484702AgnDeBC uFL2346326iro,,,,,,,n2902101097r1ce3a3003043044ann50100000050700100307lcc ying22TC1234914619o,,,,,,,,,,o23911025276965ts32370037036447at50810006005904500890l EFx3o242c,,,,rh50500ea00000ing000000000000N00000000gnDeFC FuL11inro,,00race00nan00000000000000000000clc iyngTC3343oo,,,,05500tsa00000tl00000000000000000000 EFxoGcrhoeaving00000000000000000e000gnrnemCeuL422412142nro,,,,,,,,,926446t34r7c e5553123620Fan07004010300110003013ilnc aaaynci422412412TnC,,,,,,,,,og926446347o5553t123620sa07400013000110300013tl EF22x2o133116430c,,,,,,,,,r,h135745721406ea720333009304ing06800000404200007208gnTeoCtauL8254547476lro,,,,,,,,,, 292556105375r7Cce8556460066460oan57002408203080003803lsc ty 311217334544111647TC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,o212553651700250903o8396084t03600004005sa53360084020200000001tl                                                                                                                                43\nIJ..

Criteria for Selection of Secondary Schools\n1. There are over 10,000 public schools in Sri Lanka, which comprise 99 percent of all\nschools.  Of these, about 2,300 offer grades 10-13. About 600 of these secondary schools offer\ncourses in all subjects (science, arts and commerce) and are called full-curriculum schools. The\nremaining 1,700 schools offer academic courses in either arts and/or commerce. The 600 full-\ncurriculum schools and the 700 largest of the other schools accommodate all grades 12-13\nstudents and 65 percent of the grades 10-11 students. Under the Project, about 500 of the full-\ncurriculum schools and 600 of the larger remaining secondary schools were selected. A final\nselection of 800 of these 1,100 schools will be provided resources under the Project while the\nremaining 300 will be provided computer learning centers (CLCs) from other aid agencies.\nBetween them, they cover 90 percent of the students in grades 12-13 and 70 percent of the\nstudents in grades 10-11. The remaining 10 percent of students in grades 12-13 are enrolled in\nwell-off schools near Colombo and the large provincial capitals, and the 30 percent of grades\n10-11 students are in small schools. All secondary schools will benefit from the policies, and\ninstructional programs introduced under the Project.\n2. While all schools will receive general support to strengthen secondary education, the\nschools selected under the Project will receive support for computer laboratories, multimedia\nrooms, and a school grant for stipends. The schools were selected according to a set of criteria\nthat ensured that within each administrative division, there is a balance of gender, linguistic, and\ncultural representation. Schools were selected on the basis of:\n(i) grades 10-13 enrollment of over 500,\n(ii) average academic performance of school above 50th percentile,\n(iii) available assured supply of electricity and water,\n(iv) adequate number of teachers,\n(v) available  full-size  classrooms  for  conversion  to  computer  laboratory  and\nmultipurpose room,\n(vi) principal and community agreement to fully utilize the laboratory, and\n(vii) open enrollment policy to allow for transfers.\n3. A subset of about 100 schools will be upgraded to full-curriculum:\n(i) there are existing full-curriculum schools outside the administrative division of the\nschool in question, except in cases where other schools in the division are\nalready overcrowded;\n(ii) available science teacher will be redeployed to the school; and\n(iii) there will be a minimum of 15 students for each additional science section (e.g.,\nphysics/mathematics and biology/chemistry) in the first year of operation.\n4. Stipends will be provided to these schools to accept transfer students. The funds will be\nin block grants and administered by the school for after-school tutoring, books, and transport\nwhen required. Students in grade 10 may apply for a stipend for use in grade 11 as a means to\ncomplete  grade  11  and  pass  the  national  examination.  Stipends  will  also  be  awarded  to\nsuccessful candidates of the grade 11 national examination who will not be able to go on to\ngrades 12-13 without the stipend.  Each candidate applying for a stipend will be evaluated on\nthese criteria:", "61\nAppendix 10, page 2\n(i) means test indicates family wealth below the poverty line;\n(ii) student is academically qualified; and\n(iii) available quality school is within the administrative division or the immediate\nneighboring division.\nB.

The Project will address numerous issues related to strengthening and improving the\nefficiency of the secondary school system in Sri Lanka, for which economic calculations can be\nmade.  The base case (paras. 4-7) has an economic rate of return of 16 percent.  The Project\nwill impact the economy in several ways - in addition to the standard internal rate of return\ncalculations \u2014 due to the increased number of students passing the grades 11 and 13 national\nexaminations and their added value to the economy due to their improved computer, language,\nscience, and mathematics background.\n2. School-based assessment (SBA) and examination reform will give parents, teachers,\nand students feedback on student academic abilities and allow the students to make informed\nchoices for future educational and occupational decisions.  The examination reform will lead to\nimproved efficiency in test administration and reporting. The waiting period between grades 11\nand 12 will be reduced by six months (from nine months) will reduced from leaving only three\nmonths waiting time, which is similar to an extended end-of-year school vacation.  School-based\nmanagement offers an invaluable contribution to increasing system efficiency, especially at the\nschool level where principals will have greater discretionary powers and the school development\nsociety will be empowered to raise funds and charge fees for school services.  Added to this are\nthe potential savings by allowing public-private partnerships in efficient secondary schools that\nwould like to charge fees in exchange for giving up state subsidies.  About 40 schools at present\nwould favor opting out of the public education system if permitted. The expenditure regime of\nthese 40 schools needs to be analyzed and compared with the current costs provided by the\nGovernment.  Private partnerships will play an increasing role in the future education system\nand  information  is  needed  on  the  options  available  to  schools.    Finally,  the  targeting  of\nscholarship  stipends  to  disadvantaged  students  can  be  monitored  and  the  impact  of  the\nintervention costs compared with the number of these students successfully passing the grades\n11 and 13 national examinations and receiving income benefits and further education.\nA. Economic Return to Investment in Secondary Education\n3. The major benefit arising from the Project is enabling additional students (many poor) to\nsuccessfully complete grades 11 and 13 examinations.1  This, in turn, will lead to higher income\nand  perhaps  an  opportunity  to  continue  their  education.    The  incremental  earning  in  a\ncompetitive labor market is taken as a proxy for the incremental social benefit in the economic\nanalysis. The Project was analyzed to determine the economic rate of return. For the base case,\nthe rate is 16 percent.  The major assumptions are given in Table A11.1.\n                                                \n1  Due to social targeting of stipends and school upgrading in progress, it is estimated that the pass rate of students in\nlow-performing schools will increase from an average of 25 percent in 1999 to 45 percent in 2005, and that of\nstudents in high-performing schools from 50 to 60 percent in the same period.", "69\nAppendix 11, page 2 \nTable A11.1: Base Case Basic Data\nExchange Rate            $1 = SLRs73.00\nStandard Conversion Factor       0.85\nWage of laborer with no schoolinga                  SLRs59,579\nWage of laborer with upper secondary educationa      SLRs77,591\nWage of employed O/L workera    SLRs105,894\nWage of employed A/L workera    SLRs140,987\n  Grade 11 completely successful exam pass rate  \nImplementation year 1 (and without Project)          37.7%\nImplementation year 5 and thereafter     50.0%\nGrade 11 pass rate for all but one subject\nImplementation year 1 (and without Project)     13.0%\nImplementation year 5 and thereafter     17.2%\nGrade 13 exam pass rate\nImplementation year 1 (and without Project)     48.0%\nImplementation year 5 and thereafter     60.0%\nNumber of students sitting in O/L exams  350,000\nAverage lag before employment     1 year\nDropout rate for grades 12 and 13 combined          5%\nDirect cost of A/L candidateb         SLRs7,380\nCareer length of a successful O/L candidate\nwho does not continue education (60-17) 43 years\nCareer length of an A/L candidate (60-19) 41 years\nA/L = A level examination (grade 13), O/L = O level examination (grade 11).\na Derived from research conducted by Dr. Harsha Aturupane of the World Bank office in Colombo, using data\ncollected by the Households Income and Expenditure Survey, 1995/96, conducted by the Department of Census\nand Statistics and reported in Ministry of Finance and Planning, 1999.

The effect of the Project investment in increasing the number of successful O/L and A/L\ncandidates was expected to last seven years following the implementation period, or a total time\nof 12 years.  After that, it is assumed additional investment in the secondary school system will\nbe  needed  to  maintain  the  number  of  successful  candidates.  For  each  cohort  from\nimplementation year 1 through implementation year 12, the incremental income earned by the\nincremental successful candidates is taken for the entire working life \u2013 that is, for example, an\nincremental A/L candidate is assumed to earn incremental income for a period of 41 years.\nNeither widening nor narrowing of the income differential is assumed in the base case. It will be\nnoted that the incremental income received by a successful A/L candidate is the value of the\nsuccessful candidate to the economy whether or not the candidate goes for further education.\n5. The wage data by education level is taken from the Household Income and Expenditure\nSurvey 1995/96 conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics.  The amounts have\nbeen brought to 1999 level using the consumer price index as reported by the Central bank of\nSri Lanka.\nB. Sensitivity Tests\n6. The base case of the economic analysis was subjected to sensitivity tests for pass rate,\nreduced income differentials, unemployment and increased equipment expenditure (most for\nadditional computers). The Project is sensitive to the pass rate (Table A11.2).  If the pass rate", "70\nAppendix 11, page 3 \nfor O/L candidates increases from 37.7 percent in implementation year 1 to 45 percent in\nimplementation year 5, instead of the 50 percent assumed in the base case, and the pass rate\nfor A/L candidates increases from 48 to 55 percent in implementation year instead of the 60\npercent assumed in the base case, the rate of return drops from the base case level of 16\npercent to 11 percent.  (The change in the pass rates for the candidates passing all but one\nsubject is assumed to be proportional to that for the completely successful candidates.)\nTable A11.2: Sensitivity Analysis\n       Resulting Economic\n                  Rate of Return\nSensitivity Test      (%)\nBase case       16\nReduce O/L pass rate from 50% to 45 % and A/L pass rate from 60% to 55%       11\nIncrease O/L pass rate from 50% to 55% and A/L pass rate from 60 to 65%       22\nReduce income differentials by 10% between worker with upper secondary\n     education and O/L worker and between O/L worker and A/L worker          15\nAssume 10% unemployment among O/L and A/L workers        15\nIncrease equipment expenditures (mainly computers) by 10%       15\nA/L = A level examination (grade 13), O/L = O level examination (grade 11).\n7. In contrast, if the Project succeeds in increasing the O/L pass rate to 55 percent instead\nof 50 percent and the A/L to 65 percent instead of 60 percent, the economic rate of return rises\nto 22 percent.  The reason for this marked sensitivity is simply that the cost remains unchanged\nwhile the benefit arising from the incremental earnings either falls or increases.  This high\nsensitivity to the pass rate means that project management should pay very close attention to\nefforts to increase the quality of instruction supported by the Project so that the anticipated pass\nrates are, in fact, achieved. The added inputs to academic learning along with SBA counted\ntoward the national examination should be sufficient to raise pass rates to the projected levels\nby project completion.\n8. Many in Sri Lanka are of the view that if there is a substantial increase in successful O/L\nand A/L candidates, the incremental income arising from the additional educational attainment\nwill be reduced.  The Project economic justification was tested to determine its sensitivity to an\nassumed 10 percent narrowing in the differential income between the wage of a worker with an\nupper secondary education and a successful O/L candidate and a similar 10 percent narrowing\nfor the successful A/L candidate over the O/L worker. With this narrowing of the differentials, the\neconomic rate of return falls from the base case of 16 percent to 15 percent, indicating relatively\ninsensitivity. The reason is that narrowing the income differential also reduces the opportunity\ncost of education, which comes early in the Project while the narrowed differential income\nearned by successful candidates occurs later in the project life.\n9. The  project  analysis  assumes  a  one-year  lag  between  the  time  a  successful  O/L\ncandidate completes the examination and finds employment.  Similarly, it is assumed there is a\none-year lag between the time an A/L candidate, whether successful or unsuccessful, takes the\nexamination and finds employment.  Such delays are common in Sri Lanka.  However, once\nemployed, O/L and A/L workers tend to continue to be employed.  This may change in the future\nas the economy becomes increasingly market oriented.  To determine what effect this change\nmight have on the benefit derived from the Project, a sensitivity test was conducted assuming\n10 percent unemployment among O/L and A/L workers.  The effect was minimal; the economic", "71\nAppendix 11, page 4 \nrate of return dropped from 16 percent to 15 percent.  This rather insensitive result is due to the\nfact that so much of the benefit stream lies far in the future.\n   \n10. There is considered evidence that computer assisted learning can have a marked impact\non learning outcomes (para. 14).  That being the case, the Project was tested to determine how\nincreasing the equipment expenditure (mainly for computers) would affect the project economic\nrate of return. The Project proved insensitive to this change. Increasing equipment expenditures\nby 10 percent reduced the rate of return to only 15 percent, a negligible difference.  This implies\nthat were bilateral sources to provide additional computers and cost added to the Project, the\nProject would still be fully acceptable.\nC. Project Sustainability\n11. The Project is easily sustainable.  After the implementation period, the recurrent costs of\nthe Project including the incremental stipends included in the Project will amount to SLRs167.4\nmillion.  In contrast, in 1998 the total government expenditure on education as reported by the\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka was SLRs26,694 million, of which recurrent expenditure totaled\nSLRs20,582  million.    Although  estimates  for  the  education  budget  for  the  first  project\nimplementation  year  are  not  available,  the  total  expenditure  on  education  can  be  safely\nassumed to be roughly equivalent to that in 1998.  If so, the recurrent cost of the Project\nincluding stipends amount to only six tenths of 1 percent of the total Government recurrent\nexpenditure on education (Table A11.3).\nTable A11.3:  Sustainability of Project Expenditure\n(SLRs million)\nItem   Amount\nGovernment expenditure on education (1998a)\nRecurrent      20,582\nCapital        6,112\n    ----------\nTotal              26,694\nProject recurrent expenditure after implementation period\nStipends             76\nOther recurrent             92\n     ---------\nTotal                         168\nProject recurrent expenditure as portion of total recurrent expenditure\n(1998)          0.6% \na  Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 1999.

Available data for developed countries gives the range of annual cost per student of\nintroducing  computer  learning  centers.    Generally,  the  unit  costs  include  the  purchase,\ndevelopment,  production,  operation,  maintenance,  and  administration  of  computer\ninfrastructure; and hardware, software, courseware, and personnel. For example, equipment\ncosts, annualized using amortization schedules, are added to recurrent costs to obtain a total\nannual cost.  That is, the initial investment cost includes infrastructure, hardware, software,\nInternet,  and  teacher  training.  The  recurrent  cost  is  for  maintenance,  upgrading", "72\nAppendix 11, page 5 \nsoftware/courseware,  teacher  training,  personnel,  electricity,  and  Internet  connections.\nTogether they equal the total annual cost.\n13. The total annual cost for developed countries divided by the number of students using\nthe facilities ranges from about $150 to $450, a sum too high for developing countries.  The cost\nper hour of student computer interaction time that is of greatest interest is determined by\ndividing the total annual cost by the number of computer hours available in school.   This results\nin an hourly cost of student-computer interaction in the range of $3.00 to $5.00, too expensive\nfor developing countries.  However, certain adjustments are possible to bring down this hourly\nrate in developing countries.  Teacher salaries are, on average, one order of magnitude below\nthose in industrialized nations, building costs are less than half, life expectancy of the equipment\nshould be estimated at eight years (instead of four years) because equipment renewal is not\neasy to obtain.  It is also possible to purchase equipment of a previous model from reputable\ncomputer firms, instead of the most recent one.  From an instructional standpoint there is almost\nno difference in working with equipment with an average age of four years and one of younger\nvintage.  High school students can also be selected to assist with running the laboratories and\nthis arrangement saves on costs.\n14. All these changes reduce the hourly cost by 60 percent to about $90 per year per\nstudent  on  average;  this  amount  corresponds  to  averages  found  for  developing  countries.\nWhile the rate is still high for developing societies, it can be further reduced significantly by\nextending  laboratory  hours  to  improve  computer  contact  time  with  the  community  and  by\nallowing two students to work with one computer at a time.  When this is done by hourly rate,\ninteraction time comes down to about $0.40 per hour per student.  There is no known alternative\nsystem  that  provides  the  benefits  possible  from  integrating  computers  into  the  education\nsystem, while at the same time serving the community, at a cost of 40 cents per hour of\ninteraction. If properly organized and efficiently implemented, computers in education can help\ntransform classrooms in developing countries into efficient learning environments.", "73\nAppendix 12, page 1\nNATIONAL POVERTY ANALYSIS AND PROJECT IMPACT\n1. Poverty in Sri Lanka is a relative concept that until now has not been adequately\nmeasured and analyzed. The Government Department of Census and Statistics periodically\nconducts  household  income  and  expenditure  surveys.  From  the  data,  it  is  possible  to\ncharacterize  levels  of  poverty  by  region.  The  Government  publishes  findings  measuring\nconsumption poverty, which indicates that Sri Lanka experiences 21 percent poverty. Indicators\nare provided for each province, but they tend to mask differences within provinces. For that\nreason, district analyses are more pertinent.  Based on the poverty analysis of districts, some\nareas  in  the  interior  are  extremely  poor  due  to  lack  of  infrastructure.  The  Government  is\npreparing a new Framework for Poverty Reduction in Sri Lanka with participation of major\nstakeholders  in  the  country,  including  aid  agencies.  The  report  will  be  presented  at  the\nforthcoming Development Forum of Sri Lanka in December 2000.\n2. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has also undertaken extensive\nanalysis of poverty with the assistance of the World Bank. The National Human Development\nReport for Sri Lanka produced in 1998 utilized two indexes: (i) the human development index\n(HDI), and (ii) the human poverty index (HPI).  The HDI comprises several subindices including\nlife  expectancy,  literacy,  enrollments,  etc.  and  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  index.\nTogether the life expectancy, education, and standard of living indices portray an average level\nof achievement and fulfillment for provinces and districts. The HPI measures deprivation and\nshortfalls rather than levels of fulfillment. The index comprises indices of mortality rates for 40\nyears or younger, illiteracy and nonenrollment, and lack of access to safe drinking water and\nelectricity. Not surprisingly, district rankings vary, depending on the scale used.\n3. From the HDI, it is clear that Sri Lanka has done reasonably well in promoting human\ndevelopment for all its people. Differences do arise but are caused by lack of infrastructure and\nopportunities due to remoteness, etc. An examination of the HPI shows that, again, districts do\nwell or poorly based often on location vis-\u00e0-vis roads, electricity, and access to good schools\nand information. Figure A12, taken from the UNDP report, plots the position of each district in\nrelation to the two indices. UNDP did not report on the districts in those provinces undergoing\ncivil strive. However, it is likely that poverty in those areas is significantly lower than the national\naverage. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Social Analysis of Sri Lankan Emergency\nRehabilitation in NE Province confirms this hypothesis.\n4. An  analysis  of  relative  poverty  deprivation  based  on  Figure  A12  indicates  that  the\ndistricts of Ratnapura, Hambantota, Kegale, Puttalam, Badulla, and Moneragala are the worst\noff of all districts in terms of both human development and human poverty. The are generally\nremote regions or arid plains with poor soil and little infrastructure. The districts of Kurunegala,\nAnuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Nuwara Eliya appear below average in human poverty due to\nlack of access to electricity, safe water, and infrastructure, but do well on human development.\nThese regions are generally well-off economically due to abundant natural resources, but are so\nremote as to make it difficult to enter the national grids for water and sanitation, electricity, etc.\nThe UNDP report examines each province and recommends economic strategies to eliminate\npoverty. In each case, whether it be to improve agriculture or diversify the economy, a strong\nhuman  resource  base  is  required.  In  many  cases,  poor  provinces  exist  adjacent  to  rich\nprovinces, and as such it may be possible to link the economies so that there is greater mobility\nand development between regions. There are over a million students in the six provinces that\nwill benefit from the Project. They will benefit from the quality inputs to education and will\nespecially qualify for stipend programs, and school upgrading to establish more full-curriculum\nschools in local education divisions.", "74\nAppendix 12, page 2\nFigure A12: Comparative Performance in Human Development and Human Poverty\nnt\ne\nm\np\no\nel\nKurunegala ev Kalutara\nd\nn \nAnuradhapura a Gampaha\nm\nu\nh\nPolonnaruwa n  Colombo\ne i\nc\nNuwara Eliya n\na\nm\nr\no\nrf\ne\np\ne \ng\na\nr\ne\nv\na\ne \nv\no\nb\nA\nBelow average performance in human poverty Above average performance on human poverty\nnt\ne\nm\np\nRatnapura o\nel\nv\ne\nHambantota d\nn \na\nm\nKegalle u Galle\nh\nn \nPuttalam e i Matale\nc\nn\nBadulla ma Matara\nr\no\nMoneragala rf Kandy\ne\np\ne \ng\na\nr\ne\nv\na\nw \no\nel\nB\nNote: Also compare with map (page vi).\nSource: United Nations Development Programme. 1998.

Of these students, at least 45 percent\nwill be poor. Of the targeted interventions worth $14.0 million of the $50.0 million loan, the poor\nwill gain stipends, science laboratories, and access to full-curriculum schools and this will help\nthem to complete grade 11 and pass the O level national examination that entitles them to\ncontinue to grade 12.  Including both targeted and systemwide benefits, about $25 million or half\nof the project loan will go toward improving the education of disadvantaged secondary school\nstudents.", "75\nAppendix 12, page 3\n6. Secondary  schools  are  of  two  types:  (i)  full-curriculum  schools  (with  grades  12-13\nscience classes), and (ii) limited-curriculum schools. Based on measures of ability to pay school\nfees and afford after-school tutorials, it is estimated that at least 50 percent of students in\nlimited-curriculum schools are poor while 30 percent of these in full-curriculum schools qualify\nas poor. When these percentages are translated in terms of to project schools of which 40\npercent  have  full-curriculum  and  60  percent  are  limited-curriculum,  it  is  estimated  that  42\npercent of the project beneficiaries are designated as poor. The pass rates for full and limited\nschools are 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Special means-tested stipend programs\ntargeted to poor students are expected to benefit poor students taking the grades 11 and 13\nexaminations. About 40 percent of the increase in pass rates due to quality improvements of the\nproject is expected to go to poor students. Of approximately 50,000 additional students passing\nthe O level examination each year starting in 2005, 20,000 will be disadvantaged students\nattending limited-curriculum schools.\nTable A12:  Percentage of Disadvantaged Students Attending Full-Curriculum Project\nSchools\nSchools with Schools with Schools with Schools with\nNo. of Less than 20% 20-30% 30-40% 40-50%\nProvince Schools Disadvantaged Disadvantaged Disadvantaged Disadvantaged\nWestern 105 16 78 9 2\nCentral 61 7 33 15 6\nSouthern 70 2 28 28 12\nNorthern 52 13 21 13 5\nEastern 41 8 12 15 6\nNorth Western 57 6 27 19 5\nNorth Central 25 0 9 7 9\nUva 47 4 6 22 15\nSabaragamuwa 45 6 13 20 6\nTotal 503 62 227 148 66\nPercentage 100% 12% 45% 30% 13%"], "metadata": {"Author": "ADB", "CreationDate": "D:20000830112344Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "ModDate": "D:20131112185508+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R166-00RRP.doc"}}
