Over \nthe last 5 years, the Government and Ministry of Health  (MOH) \nhave made great progress in replacing the inefficient hospital-\nbased  system,  which  is  biased  toward  curative  care,  with  a \nsystem  based  on  primary  health  care  (PHC)  and  preventive \nservices. In particular, the concept of family medicine has been \nintroduced  and  a  network  of  family  group  practices  (FGPs) \nestablished. However, much remains to be done to embed the \nchanges and deepen their impact; further efforts to improve the \nquality of FGPs and rationalize hospital facilities and overstaffing \nare essential.  \n \nADB will continue its partnership with the Government in helping \n(i) improve rural health service delivery, especially  to  achieve \nMillennium Development Goals  at all levels of the rural health \nsystem;  (ii)  introduce  changes  in  traditional  popular  views  of \nhealth  services;  (iii)  strengthen  the  reform  process  and  MOH \ncapacity to implement reforms; and (iv) study and test initiatives of \npublic sector management and health care financing mechanisms \nto improve sector efficiency, sustainability, and pro-poor focus. \n \nObjectives and Scope  The  goal  of  the  Second  Health  Sector  Development  Project \n(HSDP2) is to  improve the health of  the people, especially the \npoor and vulnerable, including women and  children, in targeted \nrural areas. HSDP2 has two objectives: (i) improve the quality and \nutilization of health services in rural areas, especially for the poor \nand vulnerable; and (ii)  build the capacity of the health sector, \nextending  the  reforms  in  sector  efficiency,  effectiveness,  and \nsustainability, and institutional development initiated by the HSDP.  \n ", "iv \n  HSDP2 has three components: (i) integrated improvement of rural \nhealth services, (ii)  institutional capacity  development, and  (iii) \nproject management. Component (i) will be  implemented in  five \nrural aimags (Bayanhongor, Dornod, Dzavhan, Ovorhangay, and \nHentiy), which were selected for their level and severity of poverty, \nlevels of infant and maternal mortality, and incidence of infectious \ndiseases. Components (ii) and (iii) are nationwide. HSDP2 will \nfocus investment in areas that will have the greatest impact on the \npoor and vulnerable.    \n \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is $17.50 million equivalent, of which $9.26 \nmillion equivalent is the foreign exchange cost, and $8.24 million \nequivalent, the local currency cost.   \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million equivalent) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  % \nA.

The loan will have a \nmaturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years.  Interest \nwill be charged at 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter.  The borrower will be Mongolia.  \n   \nAllocation  and  Lending  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  SDR10.191  million  ($14  million \nTerms  equivalent).  The  balance  of  $3.5  million  equivalent  will  be \nprovided by the Government. The ADB loan will include financing \nof the interest charge. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  5 years  \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A project implementation unit (PIU) will be established in MOH, \nArrangements  based on  the framework of  the  existing  HSDP PIU to ensure \ncontinuity of experienced staff. In each HSDP2 aimag, an aimag \nproject coordinator will be assigned. A national steering committee \nand aimag supervisory groups will be formed for policy guidance \nand coordination. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Health \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of ADB-financed goods, related services, and civil \nworks will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement, and Mongolia\u2019s Public Procurement Law, which was \n ", "  v  \nProcurement, and Mongolia\u2019s Public Procurement Law, which was \nprepared with ADB assistance. Equipment will be procured by \ninternational  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  in  excess  of \n$500,000;  international  shopping  for  contracts  in  excess  of \n$100,000; and direct purchase for contracts less than $100,000. \nCivil works for $1 million  or less will be carried out under local \ncompetitive bidding.  \n   \nConsulting Services  A  total  of  205  person-months  of  consulting  services  (31  of \ninternational  and  174  of  domestic)  will  be  recruited  following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  international  and \ndomestic consultants. International consulting firms or individuals \nwill be engaged.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  A grant of $650,000 will support the Government\u2019s initiatives in \npublic sector management and health care financing mechanisms. \nThe objectives of the technical assistance  are to (i)  strengthen \nMOH  and  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor  capacity  and \nimprove understanding of output-based budgeting for the  new \nPublic  Sector  Finance  Management  Law,  and  (ii)  improve \neffectiveness and sustainability of the Health Insurance Fund.   \n \nProject Benefits and  HSDP2  will  benefit  the  whole  population  indirectly  through \nBeneficiaries  nationwide  components  that  support  health  sector  reform  and \n  sector institutional building.  \n   \n  Under the targeted rural health service component, about 400,000 \n  people  in  five  rural  aimags,  representing  18%  of  the  total \n  population,  will  benefit  directly  from  improved  availability  and \n  quality of rural health services. About 48.5% of the population in \n  these HSDP2 aimags is poor, compared to the national average \n  of 36.0%. The targeted aimags also have endemic diseases and a \n  high infant mortality rate, which are composite proxies for poverty \n  incidence, indicating that most people in the targeted aimags face \n  multiple deprivations.   \n   \n  In the five targeted aimags, HSDP2 will strengthen public health \n  education and preventive works at the  bag (community) level, \n  renovate  and  equip  soum  (district)  health  centers  and  aimag \n  hospitals, train staff at all levels of the health system to improve \n  the quality of service delivery, and set up performance-based \n  incentives in provider payments to improve service management  \n  and  increase   attention  to the poor and vulnerable,  including \n  women and children. HSDP2 will encourage greater participation \n  of stakeholders. \n   \n  HSDP2 will focus its support on PHC, which is an internationally \nproven  best  practice  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable, especially women and children. Rural PHC is provided \nby bag  feldshers (community nurses), soum heath centers, and \naimag  hospitals  for  referral  cases.  HSDP2  will  reinforce  bag ", "vi \naimag  hospitals  for  referral  cases.  HSDP2  will  reinforce  bag \nfeldshers who are primarily responsible for promoting reproductive \nhealth and soum health centers, where the most outpatients are \nwomen of reproductive age, and children. Aimag hospitals will be \nstrengthened  to  provide  quality  services  to  referral  cases  of \npregnant women, and children.  \n \nWomen are crucial in  providing PHC in urban and rural areas. \nMore than 98% of  rural PHC providers (doctors, nurses, and \nfeldshers) are women. In urban areas women also provide PHC. \nBy focusing on PHC, HSDP2 will directly benefit women through \nimproved human development services and empowerment.    \n \nHSDP2 is classified as a core poverty intervention with a focus on \nhuman development and gender and development.      \n   \nRisks and Safeguards  The Government is active in introducing reforms and changes in \npublic sector management and health care financing systems. \nHowever,  if  initiatives  are  not  accompanied  by  a  change  in \ncapacity and capability of stakeholders of the health sector and an \nefficient monitoring and evaluation system, expected outcomes \nare not likely. This risk will be minimized in HSDP2 through strong \ncapacity-building  support,  provision  of  technical  services, and \nstrengthened monitoring systems.  \n \nThe changes being introduced in health service delivery require a \nchange in attitude of staff and clients and in management. HSDP2 \nwill invest in a public information campaign to manage perceptions \nof a responsive health system and will strengthen management.  \n \nInsufficient funds will hamper PHC reform. Hospital rationalization \nshould be accelerated  to reallocate funds to  reform PHC and \nFGP. HSDP2 will support  hospital rationalization  by intensifying \npolicy dialogue, improving efficiency in hospital management, and \nbuilding MOH capacity to plan and monitor hospital restructuring.      \n \n ", " \nv\nii\n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Second Health Sector Development Project (HSDP2). 1  The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for support for health reform, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA.   \n \nII.  RATIONALE:  SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Initial Reform Achievements \n \n2.  Mongolia has been reforming its health care system and health financing mechanisms \nsince the early 1990s. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) through Health Sector Development \nProgram (HSDP)2 has been helping the Government plan and implement sector reforms since \n1997 and has introduced significant and necessary changes in the health system. The aim is to \nreplace  an  old  Soviet  model,  dominated  by  an  extensive  network  of  hospitals  that  were \noverstaffed, emphasized facility-based curative care, and not sustainable after transition, with \none that is more responsive to client needs, based on primary health care (PHC) and preventive \nservices, of good quality, and sustainable.  \n \n3.  One of the major accomplishments under the HSDP was the introduction of family group \npractices (FGPs) to provide PHC. FGPs\u2014teams of doctors and nurses\u2014work as private entities \nthrough  contracts  with  local  administrations.  The  Government  established  237  FGPs  in \nUlaanbaatar  and  in  all  aimag  centers  nationwide  by early 2002. FGPs  receive  capitation \npayment under performance-based contracts that incorporate incentives for FGPs to see the \npoor. The FGP system serves the poor and vulnerable better than other types of services3.  \n \n4.  Other reforms included the introduction of licensing and accreditation. While licensing of \nFGPs has been established and applied nationwide, hospital accreditation has been applied \nonly to a limited extent, reflecting weak reform in the hospital sector. Rationalization of hospitals \nand health personnel has reduced the number of beds and staff by 40% since 1990 (to 7.5 beds \nand 13.4 staff per 1,000 population in 2001). However, these ratios are still much higher than in \ncomparable countries, and rationalization should be pursued. A review of the progress of HSDP \nimplementation is in Appendix 2.   \n \nB.  Key Problems and Opportunities  \n \n5.  The health sector faces considerable challenges. The following key issues must be \naddressed to expand and sustain development progress in health:   \n \n6.  Double Burden of Diseases. People\u2019s health has improved steadily since 1996 but is \nstill poor. The infant mortality rate (IMR) has declined but is still high at 30.2 per 1,000 live births \nin 20014 and is worse in rural than urban areas. The main causes of death among infants and \n                                                 \n1  The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 1997.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nMongolia for the Health Sector Development Program. Manila. This includes a program loan to support policy \nreforms, a project loan for investments, and a TA for support for decentralized health services. \n3  An evaluation report on the FGP system is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n4  Household surveys report higher mortality than does MOH. MOH data is suspected to miss several births, \nparticularly neonatal deaths. ", "2 \nchildren under  5 years of age are respiratory diseases, perinatal conditions,  diarrhea, and \ninfectious  diseases.  Poor  nutrition  among  children  increases  vulnerability  to  disease.  The \ndownward trend in the maternal mortality rate (MMR) has reversed recently and is of particular \nconcern. MMR in rural areas  is twice that in urban areas. Poor nutrition,  particularly among \npregnant women, is another acute problem. Table 1 provides relevant Millennium Development \nGoals (MDG) indicators and the goals that the country aims to achieve.   \n \n7.  Mongolia has rapidly undergone an epidemiological transition in the  past ten years. \nDisease pattern shows the double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. \nThe country faces reemerging infectious diseases. Tuberculosis,  syphilis, and viral hepatitis \nincreased significantly over the last 5 years. So far, 4 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-\npositive cases have been identified, but sexually transmitted infections and risk behavior are \nwidespread, contributing to HIV vulnerability.  In brief, the health system faces challenges in \naddressing communicable and maternal and child health conditions  and noncommunicable \ndiseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, accidents, and injuries.  \n \nTable 1.

Poor Rural Health Sector Development. The health system in rural areas is composed \nof bag feldshers (community nurses), soum health centers, and aimag hospitals. Bag feldshers \nand soum health centers provide PHC for  rural populations, including health education, and \nbasic health services, including maternal services. Aimag hospitals (250\u2013350 beds) provide \nfirst-referral services. For remote areas, inter-soum hospitals are set up as first-referral hospitals. \nAlthough providing PHC  to outpatients, soum health centers are  equipped with beds  mainly \nbecause of the centers' vast catchment areas and severe climate conditions.  \n \n9.  Unequal access to quality health services, and  the worse  health status in rural than \nurban areas are serious constraints in the health sector. Health resources are concentrated in \nurban areas, particularly in Ulaanbaatar, while rural areas have a shortage of physicians and \n ", "  3 \nother  qualified  health  workers,  deteriorated  buildings, and a lack of basic equipment and \nsupplies. Reflecting the low population density and low  service quality, soum health centers \nserve only 2\u20135 outpatients a day and 5-10 deliveries a year. Mortality rates are consistently \nhigher in rural than urban areas, indicating  that rural Mongolians have not  benefited equally \nfrom health service improvement.  \n \n10.  Human resources are scarce  in rural areas. Isolation, lack of opportunity for medical \nconsultation with colleagues, limited practice due to the  small population, lack of up-to-date \ntechnical  material,  limited  opportunity  for  on-the-job training and continuing education with \nappropriate supervision, and difficult transportation and communication conditions are major \nobstacles to attracting and retaining qualified health staff in rural areas. Recently, the Ministry of \nHealth (MOH) prepared a strategy to strengthen soum health centers, proposing to renovate \nand equip health centers, train and retain soum health workers, and pilot capitation payment at \nthe  soum  level.  HSDP2  will  assist  this  MOH  initiative  and  provide  an integrated set of \nimprovements.   \n \n11.  Hospital-Dominated  System  and  Inefficient  Hospital  Management.  Hospital \nrationalization is still a major challenge. HSDP set an initial target of 7.5 hospital beds per 1,000 \npopulation, which was met in 1999, but is still high for Mongolia\u2019s economic level. Much of the \nhealth budget is spent keeping hospitals open and heated, depleting funds to finance care of \npatients. If hospitals are not further rationalized, investment impact will be diluted.   \n \n12.  Rationalization  should  make  hospital  management  more  efficient.  Hospital  care is \ncharacterized by long stays (10.72 days) and relatively high admission rates (20.4% of  the \npopulation are hospitalized annually), leading to high bed occupancy. Long stays are driven by \nperverse funding  arrangements, low quality of services caused by  shortage of drugs and \noutdated treatment protocols, and facility-based protocols for infectious disease control, such as \nfor tuberculosis. Many admissions are for pathologies that would be treated on an outpatient \nbasis in international practice, such as headache, hypertension, and diabetes. Improvement in \nefficiency of hospital  management, including introduction of appropriate admission criteria, \ninternational standard treatment guidelines, and output based provider payment mechanisms, \nwill reduce the required level of accommodation. The quality of PHC should be improved, and \ndemand for it increased to reduce the need and demand for hospitals. \n \n13.  However, resistance is strong to reducing the number of beds and hospitals, not only \namong health personnel and MOH but also among  the people,  who are accustomed to the \nhospital-based  system.  MOH\u2019s  previous  plans  to  close  or  merge  hospitals  have  been \nsuspended due to protests from the people. External assistance has not been coordinated to \nfacilitate rationalization. New hospitals are being built and the number of hospital beds has been \nincreasing  in  Ulaanbaatar  since  2000.  Policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  needs  to  be \nrenewed to pursue rationalization.   \n \n14.  Poor Human Resources Development. The large-scale changes that have taken place \nin  clinical  and  managerial  arrangements  over  the  past  decade  have  created  many  new \nchallenges for staff at all levels of the health system. Overstaffing and staff maldistribution have \ncontinued to hamper sector efficiency. The number of physicians has increased since 1999, \nparticularly in Ulaanbaatar. The current high demand for physician training, and a lack of \ncongruency between service needs and training intakes, has led to significant overproduction of \nphysicians. Medical university students should be reduced, and incentives given to  physicians \nand nurses to stay in rural and remote areas.  \n ", "4 \n15.  Decentralization has become a  government priority. Provincial  governments became \nresponsible  for  delivering  and  financing  health  services,  while  MOH  has  shifted  to  policy \ndevelopment, strategic planning, regulation and standard setting, and monitoring and evaluation. \nHowever, local governments lack experience, and planning and managerial capacity in resource \nallocation in the health sector. Some have diverted resources from health care to other sectors. \nFew have been able to follow MOH\u2019s broad policy of shifting resources from hospitals to PHC. \nDespite  MOH\u2019s  overall  responsibility  for  workforce  planning,  and  the  recently  developed \nNational Health Workforce Plan 2002-2012, local governments continue to recruit, distribute, \nand train staff within the budget framework set by the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) \nin ways that may not always match MOH\u2019s plan. If decentralization is to produce the expected \npositive outcomes, capacity of local governments must be built.     \n \n16.  Since  2002,  the  environment  has  become  conducive  to  linking  policy  setting  with \nimplementation as the Government has decided to delegate decision making in health budget \nallocation to MOH. However, data on health services, personnel, and budget are fragmented, \nand hardly linked with evidence-based decision making. Capacity building of MOH and local \ngovernments, combined with renewal of the health management information system (HMIS) and \noperational research, will have substantial positive impacts on sector efficiency.  \n \n17.  Limited  and  Inefficient  Health  Care  Financing.5 Health  care  spending  is  low by \ninternational standards at 4.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). Thus, the Government must \nensure that its  financial  allocations  are  fair  and  efficient,  and  that  spending is  prioritized \naccording  to  health  needs.  However,  financial  management  knowledge  and  skills  are \ninsufficient; and financing sources and fund flows and use are not understood enough to help \nauthorities to make efficient and effective decisions. In 2003, the World Bank will help establish \nnational health accounts to help the Government analyze health expenditures. \n \n18.  Mongolia  is  undergoing  major  public  sector  reform.  The  Public  Sector  Finance \nManagement Law (PSFML) was passed by Parliament in 2002, and will be effective in 2003. \nFinancial management capacity remains weak, and MOH lacks a comprehensive health sector \nfinance policy and  an implementation plan.  Aimags lack the capacity to develop an efficient \nbudget based on outputs. Training for health care finance at the central and aimag levels is, \ntherefore, required.  \n \n19.  Mongolia has supported the development of the social health insurance scheme since \n1994. The health insurance system provided universal compulsory coverage, and collected \nemployer-employee contributions.  The Government subsidized premiums for those categorized \nas \u201cvulnerable.\u201d With the introduction of the new eligibility criteria in 2001, several people lost \nthese  benefits,  as  compulsory  was  replaced  by  voluntary  coverage.  Further  assessments \nrelated to  the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper in 2001  suggested that households were \nunable to pay premiums due to liquidity constraints or lack of geographical access, such as \namong the nomadic population, and herdsman. \n \n20.  The sources of health care financing in 2001 included government budget (74%), Health \nInsurance Fund (HIF) (23%), and cost sharing (3%). According to PSFML, HIF is expected to \ncontribute up to 32% of the total health budget by 2003. The Government expects HIF to \nimprove its income from premiums, as fewer people  are now categorized under \u201cvoluntary\u201d \ncoverage  and  eligible  for  exemptions  on  premiums.  However,  recent  premium  collection \nindicates that HIF revenue may not improve quickly and that the Government may thus remain \n                                                 \n5  A detailed analysis of heath care financing and public health expenditure is in Supplementary Appendix B.   \n ", "  5 \nthe leading financier of health care. HIF has no  regulations and criteria for service use and \nservice delivery quality control mechanisms. HIF must improve premium collection, set controls, \nestablish checks and balances, and streamline pricing mechanisms.   \n \n21.  People\u2019s Perceptions and Attitudes to Health Reform.6 HSDP identified people\u2019s \ntraditional perceptions of and attitudes to health services\u2014valuing hospital-based curative care, \nfor instance\u2014as a major risk. HSDP aimed to reform the system to emphasize PHC. HSDP \nstrategies included information and education campaigns as well as quality assurance of FGPs, \nwhich  provide  PHC  to  the  urban  population.  Increased  utilization  of  FGPs  and  patient \nsatisfaction with them  were  observed.  However, many people, particularly in Ulaanbaatar, \ncontinue to visit hospitals, bypassing FGPs: 50% of hospital outpatients have gone directly to \nhospitals.  \n \n22.  The information and education campaign supported by HSDP was found to be effective \nin promoting reform and emphasizing the role of FGPs. The campaign was particularly effective \nin  the  early  stages  but  gradually  tapered  off  as  budgets  were  reduced.  Information \ndissemination  was  largely  undertaken  by  project  staff  as  MOH  and  local  government \ninvolvement was not optimal.  Information and education are important components of the \noverall reform agenda and need to have a high priority during all phases of  HSDP2. Local \ngovernments and staff must lead  information campaigns, with  coordination and advice  from \nMOH.  \n \n23.  HSDP helped the  FGP system improve service quality by  (i) introducing a capitation \npayment and performance-based contract, (ii) applying licensing for FGP quality assurance, (iii) \nproviding  training  and  equipment,  and  (iv)  establishing  a  good  working  environment  by \nrehabilitating and rebuilding facilities. However, training consisted of only one short course and \nwas not followed by supervision or on-the-job advice. Similarly, training impacts were not \nanalyzed. Surveys thus reported limited knowledge and practice of standard  protocols. The \npopulation must have confidence in FGP and PHC to reduce dependency on hospitals. Quality \nis a major factor in raising confidence. HSDP2 thus emphasizes improving the service quality of \nFGPs and soum health centers and will provide a comprehensive package of training courses, \non-the-job advice, and systematic impact assessments. These components will be further \nsupplemented by continuing education.   \n \n24.  Lack  of  Harmonized  International  Assistance  and  Its  Limited  Utilization. \nInternational assistance for the public health sector, after peaking in 1994, has since declined in \nabsolute size and in share of public health expenditure, which declined to 12% in 2000 from \n32% in 1994. Appendix 3 provides details of recent health sector investments. The purposes \nand  priorities  of  various  funding  agencies  are  not  always  consistent  with  those  of  the \nGovernment.  For  instance,  external  investment  in  specialized  hospitals  and  advanced \nequipment could divert or even distort Government\u2019s spending priorities in the heath sector if not \ncarefully planned. Inputs are sometimes duplicated. Strategies and approaches used in external \nassistance are not necessarily compatible with each other, thus confusing local governments \nand communities involved in donor programs.  \n \n25.  Many examples of suboptimal use of donor assistance can be cited. The World Health \nOrganization (WHO) has highlighted that goods and services provided by donors are often left \nunused or underutilized. WHO also observed that too many consultants cover the same areas \nand produce too many reports for MOH to digest, leading to unutilized consultant inputs. Impact \n                                                 \n6  Information sources on the FGP evaluation are in Supplementary Appendix A.  ", "6 \nanalysis and  monitoring are not systematically done, either by donors or the Government. \nEffective coordination and monitoring mechanisms are needed to ensure that inputs and policy \nadvice  are  consistent  and  complementary.  External  assistance  must  be  optimally  utilized. \nHSDP2 will help build donor coordination capacity and mechanisms of MOH and will help it \ncreate a conducive environment for effective donor assistance.        \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Goal and Objectives \n \n26.  HSDP2\u2019s goal is to improve the health of people, especially the poor and vulnerable, \nsuch as women and children in target areas. HSDP2 has two objectives:  \n \n(i)  Improve quality and utilization of health services in rural areas, especially for the \npoor and vulnerable. \n \n(ii)  Build  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  health  sector,  based  on  the  reform \nachievements  and  institutional  developments  of  HSDP  in  sector  efficiency, \neffectiveness, and sustainability.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs  \n \n27.  HSDP2 has three components, which were designed through intensive national and \nlocal  consultations  with  key  stakeholders,  paying  attention  to  the  needs  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable:  (i)  integrated  improvement  of  rural  health  services,  (ii)  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment, and (iii) project management.  \n \n28.  Components (ii) and (iii) will  have an impact  nationwide, while component (i) will be \nimplemented in five rural aimags (Bayanhongor, Dornod, Dzavhan, Ovorhangay, and Hentiy), \nwhich were selected for their level and severity of poverty, level of infant and maternal mortality, \nand incidence of infectious diseases. The profiles of the HSDP2 aimags are in Appendix 4. \nHSDP2 will invest in areas that will have the greatest impact on the poor, women, and children.   \n \n1.  Integrated Improvement of Rural Health Services \n \n29.  This component focuses on improving access to, utilization of, and quality of basic PHC \nservices in an integrated way in the HSDP2 aimags. Investments will be made at the bag, soum, \nand  aimag  levels.  Factors  and  challenges  affecting  service  quality  and  utilization  will  be \ncomprehensively addressed by (i) improving working conditions by rehabilitating facilities and \nproviding equipment; (ii) upgrading knowledge and skills of staff; (iii) providing incentives to staff \nto work in rural areas, and  meet the needs of  the poor and vulnerable;  and (iv) providing \nparticipatory and informative public heath campaigns to create demand for quality PHC services, \nand improve community, and family health and nutrition practices.  \n \n30.  Basic health  services strengthened under this component include maternal and child \nhealth (MCH) services and infectious disease control, which contribute to reaching MDGs and \nproviding cost-effective health services to combat prevalent diseases. The scope of these \nservices,7 in line with life-cycle approach, includes immunization; growth monitoring; school \n                                                 \n7 The framework of the package is defined in the government policy in line with the World Development Report, 1993, \nand ADB Policy for the Health Sector, 1999. \n ", "  7 \nhealth; integrated management of child illness; nutrition; reproductive health services; safe \nmotherhood (antenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care); basic neonatal care; breastfeeding; \ntuberculosis control; sexually transmitted infection control; water-borne disease control; and \nprevention of noncommunicable diseases, particularly coronary heart diseases, hypertension, \nand diabetes,  which are related to inappropriate diet  and smoking. Nutrition support should \nalways be a part of an integrated approach. HSDP2 will help all health workers provide these \nservices effectively, in accordance with health workers\u2019 terms of reference.  \n \n31.  Funds for recurrent operating and maintenance costs must be available to make optimal \nuse  of  capital  investments.  The  Government\u2019s  support  for  training  and  public  information \ncampaigns must be secured. Incremental financial requirements associated with HSDP2 will be \nassessed annually and included in the aimag health budget plan.   \n \na.  Soum Health Service Development \n32.  A capitation payment system linked with performance-based contracts will be introduced \nat rehabilitated or rebuilt soum health centers and then rolled out to the remainder of HSDP2 \naimags. The purpose of the capitation system incentives is to promote efficient management by \nservice providers; improve quality performance,  especially in essential health services; and \nincrease responsiveness to the needs of the poor. Capitation rates, performance indicators, and \nmonitoring methods will follow FGP mechanisms but adjusted to rural needs, delivery care, and \ninpatient needs. An international consultant will  help HSDP2 aimag health departments and \nsoum health centers make a detailed action plan to implement a capitation system and establish \nmonitoring mechanisms. A series of workshops and meetings is planned.    \n \n33.  Around 13 soum health centers will be upgraded and around 10 soum health centers \nrebuilt where they are. The requirements for civil works for soum health centers will be met by \nadopting a flexible approach, which  will reflect the services provided (basic clinical services, \npreventive services, and health  education and health promotion); actual utilization; and other \nrequirements such as staff  residences and community rooms  as incentives to rural health \nworkers. Energy-efficient design with appropriate technical services such as telephones, heating, \nwater, sanitation, and waste management will be provided. Renewable energy measures will be \nadopted. Downsizing of facilities and adoption of energy-efficiency measures are expected to \nsubstantially reduce running cost,  particularly heating,  which accounts for 40\u201360% of costs. \nMaintenance requirements will be identified, a plan developed,  and financial arrangements \nagreed on before work commences. During the first year, a civil works survey will be undertaken \nto  assess  these  points,  make  an  inventory,  and  develop  designs.  An  environmental \nmanagement plan will be prepared, together with monitoring systems.  Health center  boards, \nwhich will be set up to promote community participation in health center management, will be \ninvolved in designing the health centers.   \n \n34.  Based on the agreed-on role of soum health centers and the need to provide essential \nservices, a set of basic equipment will be provided to all soum health centers in HSDP2 aimags. \nThe equipment at this level will be similar to that of FGPs and outreach kits of FGP doctors but \nadjusted to rural and obstetric needs as well as for environmental management.     \n \n35.  Information and communication technology (ICT) services will be provided at the soum \nand aimag levels to (i) improve office function and administration, (ii) strengthen HMIS, and (iii) \nsupport distance learning. HMIS at the soum level will focus on collecting and analyzing data on \nhealth status and service utilization, and on improving services delivery. HMIS is expected to \nrecord epidemiological and activity data at source and prepare electronic patient records. For ", "8 \ndistance learning, this component will provide electronic access to health documents, up-to-date \nprotocols and initiatives [initially through compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM) and then \nthrough network]. Soum health centers will be connected through e-mail for online consultations \nwith HSDP2 aimag hospitals. CD-ROMs, to be developed by the MOH Directorate for Medical \nServices  (DMS),  will  supplement  distance  learning.  An  international  training  specialist  will \nprepare a distance-learning plan; develop concepts, training curricula, and training materials for \ndistance learning; and establish a health library.  \n \n36.  Due to poor electricity and telephone  infrastructure, limited budget for operational costs, \nand health workers\u2019  limited ICT experience,  careful and phased approaches are required to \nensure the success of ICT support. International consultants will  help HSDP2 aimag health \ndepartments assess infrastructure status and operational costs and develop  a phased  ICT \naction plan (system, software, supply, and training). Training will be provided.  \n \n37.  Soum health center staff will receive training. Senior staff  will receive training  in the \nbasics of management. Efficient management is especially important to implement a capitation \npayment mechanism. This training will be organized centrally by  DMS, but will be delivered \nlocally through outreach branches.  \n \n38.  Bag  feldshers  will  be  trained  to  improve  public  health  knowledge  and  skills  in \naccordance with their job description, and, where necessary, provided with basic equipment. In \nparticular, feldshers in remote bags will receive motorbikes to increase their outreach range. \nParticular attention will be given to (i) health education and promotion; (ii) routine health check-\nups and consultation, and preventive and public health service in MCH and nutrition; and (iii) \ncollection and analysis of data for HMIS. MCH kits have been distributed to all bag feldshers by \nother agencies, and HSDP2 will help feldshers use these kits more efficiently and enhance the \nimpacts of feldshers\u2019 activities.    \n \n39.  Bag feldshers, with the assistance of soum and aimag staff, will intensively and regularly \norganize a wide range of health education and promotion campaigns to improve community and \nfamily health and nutrition practices and raise public awareness of HSDP2 goals and scope. \nHealth education materials and equipment will be provided to bags and soums.  Campaign \nimpact will be assessed and best performance rewarded. The campaign budget will cover \nprofessional  technical  support,  material  supplies,  operational  and  logistical  costs,  and \nperformance incentives. Feldshers will prepare an annual campaign plan in close consultation \nwith soums and communities.   \n \nb.  Referral System Support \n40.  Inter-soum and aimag hospitals will be strengthened as the first-referral system for \ntargeted essential services, particularly MCH services in HSDP2 aimags. Five inter-soum and \nfive aimag  hospitals will be upgraded and  equipped. The list of equipment follows the first-\nreferral units provided under HSDP, but will be adjusted to meet rural needs. Clinical and \nmanagerial training will be provided to improve quality of referral services.   \n \n41.  Assistance  will  be  provided  to  rehabilitated  facilities  at  the  soum,  inter-soum,  and \nHSDP2 aimag levels in environmental management. A monitoring system will be also set up. \nHSDP2 will procure medical waste containers at rehabilitated/rebuilt soum health centers and \ncover the cost of transporting collected medical waste to aimag hospitals for disposal. A cost-\neffective incinerator will be procured and installed at each HSDP2 aimag hospital. Detailed \nmedical waste management guidelines will be developed and training organized.      \n ", "  9 \n2.  Institutional Capacity Development  \n \n42.  HSDP initiated a reform process that defined the direction, and provided the basis for, \nhealth sector development. To develop the health sector and improve sector efficiency, equity, \nquality,  and  sustainability,  ongoing  reforms  must  be  consolidated  and  sector  capacity \nstrengthened to plan, manage, coordinate, and monitor system development.    \n \na.  Consolidation of Reform in System Development  \n \n43.  HSDP supported the shift to PHC, quality assurance, and sector rationalization (hospital \nand overstaffing), which were major reforms. HSDP2 will continue to pursue and accelerate \nthem, which is indispensable to develop an efficient, effective, and pro-poor health sector.  \n \n44.  The shift to PHC has resulted in the establishment of FGPs in urban areas nationwide. \nUtilization  of  and  users\u2019  satisfaction  with  FGPs  has  been  increasing,  but  strong  support \ncontinues to be required until FGP is firmly rooted. HSDP2 will improve service quality and FGP \nperformance by reviewing FGPs\u2019 performance and identifying  training needs, especially in \nmanagement and finance, and outreach services to the poor, women, children, disabled, and \nunderserved. Based on identified training needs, all FGPs will be retrained and 50 new doctors \ntrained annually in family medicine. Training will be linked with MDGs and prevalent diseases. \nEquipment will be provided to improve quality.  Monitoring of service  quality, management, \nservice  utilization,  affordability,  and  satisfaction  among  the  vulnerable  groups  will  be \nstrengthened. HSDP2 will renew advocacy for PHC.   \n \n45.  Quality  assurance  will  be  enhanced  by  strengthening  licensing  and  accreditation \nmechanisms. Three years have passed since the licensing system of medical doctors, FGPs, \nand other major health workers was established and implemented. HSDP2 will assess licensing \nsystem\u2019s performance and propose mechanisms for greater quality assurance impact. Recent \namendments in health insurance legislation require all hospitals to become accredited. HSDP2 \nwill review and modify the accreditation system to make it not only a stronger quality assurance \ntool but also a more effective management tool. The quality control structures and functions of \nMOH and DMS will be reviewed. Relevant government staff will be trained. HSDP2 will reinforce \nquality  assurance  mechanisms  by  improving  purchaser  and  provider  organizations  and \nsupporting professional associations.  \n \n46.   A critical step for hospital rationalization is efficient hospital inpatient management \nleading to a lower accommodation capacity requirement. HSDP2 will review admission policies \nand inpatient management practices, prepare guidelines on inpatient management, and train \nhospital managers. HSDP2 will assess bed requirements in line with actual utilization rates and \nimproved  management,  and  propose  appropriate  hospital  capacity.  HSDP2  will  also help \nimprove inpatient management and rationalization of beds at hospitals, as pilots, where modern \ntreatment protocols are introduced or where modern equipment is provided by the Government \nor donors.  \n \n47.  HSDP2  will  help  the  Government rationalize staff by developing and implementing \ncareer development support schemes to train those who wish to move to rural areas or leave \nthe public health sector. A career development support unit (CDSU) will be established in DMS \nto provide counseling, training, and social marketing to increase job opportunities for scheme \nparticipants. Posts vacated by participants will not be refilled.  \n ", "10 \nb.  Capacity Building   \n \n48.  HSDP2  will  strengthen  institutional  capacity  in  planning,  budgeting,  staffing, \nmanagement, evaluation, and coordination at the national, aimag and soum levels. HMIS and \noperational researches will be reinforced as management tools. At the national level, support \nwill be given to MOH, including DMS, in undertaking sector reform and development. Critical to \nthe success of HSDP2 is the enhancement of the role of DMS, which will need to take the lead \nin capacity building for the health sector. Under the restructuring of the public health sector, the \nGovernment has decided to convert DMS to an agency under MOH. DMS will become the \nimplementation arm of MOH in improving health care services while MOH will concentrate on \npolicy/strategy development, regulation, and coordination. Training activities will be planned by \nDMS and delivered in close collaboration with other technical institutions. MOH will coordinate \ntraining to avoid duplication with other international agencies. \n \n49.  For training under the component for integrated improvement in rural health services, \nDMS will develop, with the assistance of international consultants, a rural training plan for health \nworkers in HSDP2 aimags. To strengthen decentralized training activities, outreach DMS offices \nwill be set up and equipped in two HSDP2 aimags.   \n \n50.  A series of nationwide training courses are also envisaged under HSDP2, including \ntraining for (i) management  and planning; (ii) human resource development; (iii)  health care \nfinancing, health economics, and policies; (iv) accreditation and quality assurance; and (v) \nclinical areas. HSDP2 will first train trainers at the national level to prepare and monitor health \nmanagement courses and develop guidelines and material. Aimag and soum health managers \nwill be trained in planning, budgeting, managing, and monitoring health services.  \n \n51.  To build institutional capacity in human resource development, HSDP2 will review the \nhuman resource development policy and regulations and project staffing needs for 2004\u20132007. \nBased on this policy, HSDP2 will help MOH develop a workforce plan, covering the number, \nprofiles, geographical, and professional distribution and job description of human resources, and \ntraining needs. The plan will include specific measures to reduce turnover of health workers. \nHSDP2 will provide training and studies to build skills and capacities to plan and monitor a \nperformance-based  salary  scheme,  which  the  Government  plans  to  introduce.  Preservice \ntraining of students from rural areas and those who can  serve underserved areas  will help \nallocate  more  qualified  staff  to  rural  areas.  Continuing  education  plans,  curriculums,  and \nlearning material will be developed.  \n \n52.  To strengthen client responsiveness and participation of the health sector, HSDP2 will \nencourage the development of general information material for patients and clients on health \nservice, education, and promotion. HSDP2 will develop and implement the concepts of patients\u2019 \nrights and responsibilities, with a focus on the requirements of the poor and vulnerable groups. \nComplaint  procedures  will  be  reviewed  and  mechanisms  developed  to  address  clients\u2019 \ncomplaints in a fair and equitable manner.  \n \n53.  HSDP2 will develop MOH capacity and mechanisms to coordinate donor assistance and \npromote  its  optimal  use.  HSDP2  will  help  MOH  engage  donors  in  strategy  and  action \nformulation, consolidate  donor assistance to shared goals and strategies, and maintain a \nmonitoring and policy dialogue. For optimal use of donor assistance, HSDP2 will help MOH \nprepare donor guidelines and set up a  functional structure to advise donors, review their \nproposals,  and  propose  safeguards.  HSDP2  will  enable  MOH  to  create  an  environment \nconducive to effective donor assistance and to mobilizing further donor assistance.         \n ", "  11 \nC.  Project Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n54.  The total cost of HSDP2 is estimated at $17.50 million equivalent, of which an estimated \n$9.26 million, or 53%, is the foreign exchange cost. The local currency  cost is estimated at \n$8.24 million equivalent or 47% of the total cost. A summary is shown in Table 2, and details are \nin Appendix 5. \n \nTable 2.

ADB will provide a loan of $14 million equivalent from Special Funds resources to \nfinance 80% of the total project cost. The loan will be repayable over 32 years with a grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter. The borrower will be Mongolia. ADB will fund 100% of the foreign \nexchange cost, totaling 53% of the estimated project cost, and 58% of the local currency cost. \nThe Government will provide the remaining $3.5 million equivalent as counterpart financing, \nwhich accounts for 20% of total costs, including financing civil works, taxes and duties, training, \nworkshops, and other recurring costs.

Implementation Arrangements   \n \n1.  Project Management and Implementation Period \n \n56.  MOH will be the executing agency for HSDP2. The state secretary of MOH will be the \nproject director. A national steering committee will be established to provide overall guidance, \nchaired by the state secretary of MOH and composed of senior officials from MOH, Ministry of ", "12 \nSocial Welfare and Labor (MSWL), MOFE, Bank of Mongolia, Mongolian Medical University, \nState Social Insurance General Office (SSIGO), DMS, and HSDP2 aimag representatives. The \naimag  supervisory  groups,  chaired  by  the  aimag  governor\u2019s  office,  will  be  composed  of \nrepresentatives of health department, aimag hospitals, soum health centers, and bags. The \ncommittee and  supervisory groups will meet  quarterly and be responsible for  approving the \nannual HSDP2 budget and activity plan and reviewing and advising on implementation progress. \nWorking  groups  will  be  established  for  key  areas\u2014health  insurance,  human  resource \ndevelopment, and HMIS. \n \n57.  A project implementation unit (PIU) will be set up in Ulaanbaatar. MOH and the PIU will \nimplement and coordinate HSDP2, undertake procurement and disbursement related to HSDP2, \nand monitor and report on progress against a set of quantitative and qualitative indicators. The \nPIU will closely consult with relevant health facilities, as appropriate. The PIU will have a project \nmanager and staff for planning, training, administration, accounting, procurement/civil works, \nand equipment.  In  each  HSDP2  aimag  an aimag  project coordinator will be appointed to \noversee the implementation of  HSDP2 at the local level, to be assisted by quality assurance \nstaff and procurement/civil works staff. Project management and monitoring capacities at the \nPIU and aimags will be strengthened. Implementation arrangements (Appendix 6) are generally \nthe  same  as  HSDP  arrangements  that  have  worked  reasonably  well.  HSDP2  will  be \nimplemented over five years, from 2003 to 2008. The HSDP2 implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 7. \n \n2.  Procurement \n \n58.  Procurement of ADB-financed goods, related services, and civil works will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Mongolia\u2019s Public Procurement Law, \nprovided, however, that in the event of any inconsistency between ADB\u2019s guidelines and the \nlaw, ADB\u2019s guidelines will prevail.   \n \n59.  Equipment  will  be  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  over \n$500,000; international shopping for contracts over $100,000; and direct purchase for contracts \nless than $100,000. Civil works valued over $1 million will be carried out through international \ncompetitive bidding, and civil works contracts valued at or less than $1 million will be carried out \nunder  local  competitive  bidding,  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and \nMongolia\u2019s Procurement Law. In accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures, eligible foreign contractors \nmay participate in local competitive bidding. The list of indicative contract packages is in \nAppendix 8. The indicative civil works and procurement are in Supplementary Appendixes C \nand D. \n \n3.  Consulting Services and Training \n \n60.  HSDP2 is designed to reduce reliance on consultants, as core concepts and program \nmechanisms for reform-related activities were developed by HSDP, and MOH and the PIU have \naccumulated managerial experience. A total of 205 person-months of consulting services (31 \ninternational and 174 domestic) will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other procedures acceptable to ADB for the engagement of international and \ndomestic consultants. The consultants will be recruited individually or through a firm. The \nquality-and-cost-based selection method (QCBS) will be applied to consulting firms and detailed \ncosting based on QCBS is presented in Supplementary  Appendix E. The consultants will \nprovide services in (i) capitation payment, (ii)  hospital management standards,  (iii)  human \nresource development, (iv) ICT network development, (v) training, and (vi) civil works and \n ", "  13 \nenvironment. Appendix 9 shows the indicative consultancy requirements. The indicative training \nprogram is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n4.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n61.  An imprest account will be established by the PIU in a commercial bank acceptable to \nADB  to  expedite  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (January 2001) and detailed arrangements between the Government \nand ADB. The Government may make withdrawals from the imprest account for PIU staff costs; \ntraining, seminars, and studies; locally available material; domestic consultant; rationalization \nincentives; and civil works contracts under local competitive bidding. The initial amount to be \ndeposited into the imprest account will not exceed $500,000. Procedures from ADB\u2019s statement \nof expenditure will be followed to liquidate the imprest account and reimburse individual SOE \npayments that do not exceed $50,000. \n \n5.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit \n \n62.  The PIU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation in line with ADB\u2019s \nproject performance report and submit them to ADB and MOH within 30 days after the end of \nthe applicable period. Within three months after physical completion, MOH will submit a project \ncompletion report to ADB. Separate records and accounts for all expenditures financed out of \nthe proceeds of the loan will be maintained by MOH in accordance with sound accounting \nprinciples. Auditors acceptable to ADB will annually audit project accounts, including financial \nstatements, SOEs, and imprest account records. The audit report should be submitted to ADB \nin English not later than six months after the fiscal year to which the report relates.  \n \n6.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System  \n \n63.  MOH will establish a comprehensive  project performance monitoring  and evaluation \nsystem (PPMES) acceptable to ADB. PPMES will (i) assess HSDP2 technical performance; (ii) \nevaluate delivery of planned activities; (iii) measure project impacts; (iv) measure social and \neconomic benefits with a focus on the poor, women, and disabled; and (v) monitor achievement \nof MDGs. PPMES indicators will serve as a basis to prepare reports on project implementation \nand the reform process, and cover fiscal impacts, improved use of resources, change in access \nto  services  (particularly  among  the  poor),  improved  service  quality,  cost  savings  from \nrationalization, client satisfaction,  and  MDG  progress  status. Performance indicators are in \nAppendix 10. Some indicators will be monitored through surveys  financed by HSDP2, while \nothers will be monitored through routine  administrative and financial data.  Where feasible, \nindicators will be disaggregated by socioeconomic level and sex. The monitoring and evaluation \nspecialist and consultants will help MOH and PIU determine the specific indicators and develop \na cost-effective and efficient monitoring system during the first year of HSDP2.  \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n64.  The objectives of the TA  are to (i) strengthen MOH and MSWL capacity and improve \nunderstanding on the output/performance-based budgeting for the new PSFML, and (ii) improve \neffectiveness and sustainability of HIF. The TA will complement HSDP2 in sector strengthening \nby  focusing  on  new  government  initiatives  and  challenges  where  firm  strategies  and \nmethodologies  have  not  been  established.  The  TA  will  finance  16  person-months  of \ninternational  and  48  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  with  expertise  in  health  care \nfinance, health insurance, and HMIS. The TA will be implemented over 18 months. Detailed ", "14 \ninformation on the TA is in Appendix 11. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants;  and  for  domestic  consultants,  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB.     \n \n65.  The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA \nis estimated to cost $764,000 equivalent, comprising $464,000 in foreign exchange costs and \n$300,000 equivalent in local currency expenditures. ADB will provide $650,000 to finance the \nentire foreign currency expenditures and $186,000 of local currency expenditures, the remaining \n$114,000 equivalent being provided in kind by the Government.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n66.  The outcome of HSDP2 should be an improvement in the health status of the population \nin general, and in the  rural HSDP2 aimags in particular.  The project will benefit the whole \npopulation indirectly through nationwide components that support sector reform and institution \nbuilding.  \n \n67.  HSDP2 will focus on improving rural health services. Under the targeted rural health \nservice component, where  most HSDP2 funds are allocated, about 400,000 people in rural \nHSDP2 aimags, representing 18% of the total population, will benefit directly from improved \navailability and quality of rural health services.   \n \n68.  HSDP2 will strengthen public health education and preventive works at the bag level, \nrenovate and equip soum health centers and aimag hospitals, train all health system staff to \nimprove service delivery, and set up incentives in provider payment arrangements to increase \nattention to the poor. HSDP2 will encourage greater participation of stakeholders. HSDP2 will \nsupport decentralization. Transparent and accountable management with well-trained managers \nwill ensure the delivery of quality service to  the poor and vulnerable, including women and \nchildren. Most users of PHC are women and children. Most health providers are women in rural \nareas. Women will thus benefit directly from HSDP2.  \n \n69.  HSDP2  will  (i)  enhance  health  care  institutional  and  individual  capacities  through \nstudies, training, and development activities; (ii) support improvement of the policy capability of \nMOH; (iii) help DMS take a stronger lead in developing institutional capacities throughout the \nhealth sector; (iv) help HIF of SSIGO and its local offices develop their roles and responsibilities; \n(v) train managers and staff at the aimag and soum levels; (vi) support professional associations \nin expanding and deepening reforms; and (vii) strengthen client responsiveness.     \n \nB.  Risks \n \n70.  The Government is introducing reforms and changes in public sector management and \nfinancing systems. However, if initiatives are not  accompanied by a corresponding change in \nthe capacity and capability of stakeholders or by an efficient monitoring and evaluation system, \nexpected outcomes are not likely to be produced. This risk will be minimized in HSDP2 through \nstrong capacity-building support, provision of technical services, and strengthened monitoring \nsystems.  \n \n71.  Reforms require a change in attitude of staff and clients, and the recognition of the need \nto provide quality services. Managing public perceptions will be necessary to ensure that \n ", "  15 \nunrealistic expectations are not encouraged and that changes are introduced in a measured \nway. Change management will be a key aspect of general management. The health sector does \nnot have strength in management. The pace of  change must match that of strengthening \nmanagement capability to redirect resources to health promotion and disease prevention and to \nfocus resources on the delivery of quality PHC. \n \n72.  FGPs  have  been  paid  through  the  government  budget  supported  by  HSDP. \nCommencing in 2003, HIF will pay FGPs. By using HIF to cover FGPs, the allocation to PHC is \nestimated to increase from 14% to 19% of public health expenditures. However, noting the \nshrinking size of HIF and increasing hospital capacity, sustainable funding of the FGP system \nby health insurance is at risk. It is not certain if the planned budget for the FGP system can \naccommodate enough incentives to  improve services, which  are required to raise  people\u2019s \nconfidence in FGPs. Insufficient funds will hamper PHC reform. Hospitals should be rationalized \nto reallocate funds to PHC and FGP. HSDP2 will support hospital rationalization through policy \ndialogue and improvement of efficiency in hospital management and MOH capacity building to \nplan and monitor hospital restructuring.  \n \nC.  Environment \n \n73.  HSDP2 will rehabilitate and rebuild hospitals/health centers in the five HSDP2 aimags. \nEnvironmental benefits will be  realized through  improved medical waste management and \nwastewater  disposal.  HSDP2 will  ensure that  environmental  measures  are  put  in  place, \norganize training for health workers and local governments on medical waste management, and \nset up a environment monitoring mechanism. Details are in Appendix 12. \n \nD.  Social Analysis \n \n74.  HSDP2 focuses on poverty and gender and aims to focus on the health of the rural poor. \nHSDP2 will invest in five aimags, where 48.5% of the people are poor. Appendix 4 provides \ndetails  on  selected  aimags,  and  Appendix  13  provides  the  poverty  and  gender  analysis, \nincluding the gender plan, and other social analyses. \n \n75.  HSDP2 reviewed ethnic differentials in health and social outcomes.  Although Mongolia \ncomprises over 16 distinct clans and ethnic groups, none is  so distinct from  the dominant \nsociety as to be especially disadvantaged in the development process. Therefore, HSDP2 is \nclassified as category C in terms of indigenous peoples. However, to facilitate understanding \nand acceptance of HSDP2 among ethnic minorities, languages familiar to ethnic minorities will \nbe used in information campaigns and local training.  \n \n76.  The population overall has good access to health services, but disparities are evident by \nincome and locations. Health service utilization among the poor is far lower than among the \nwealthy.8 The poor are also more likely to visit soum health centers, primarily because of access \nand costs of care, while higher-income households are more likely to use aimag and private \nhospitals.9 The quality of health services is poorer in rural than urban areas. HSDP2 will, \ntherefore, concentrate on upgrading rural health services and facilitate incentives to attract \nhealth workers to underserved areas.     \n \n                                                 \n8  Kainyam, Tungalag, Protection of Vulnerable Population Groups with a focus on criteria for identification of                  \nvulnerability and its implication for health insurance reform, HMIEC, MOH, Mongolia, 2000.  \n9  Mongolia Poverty Assessment in a Transition Economy, World Bank, 1996 ", "16 \n77.  Rural PHC is provided by bag feldshers in communities and by soum health centers. \nOne major responsibility of bag feldshers is to promote reproductive health. Most soum health \ncenter patients are women of reproductive age, and children. HSDP2 aimag hospitals will be \nstrengthened to provide quality services to referred cases of pregnant women, and children. By \nsupporting PHC,  HSDP2 will also empower women and improve  their working conditions as \nwomen are crucial in providing rural and urban PHC. More than 98% of the bag feldshers, soum \ndoctors and nurses, and aimag nurses are women. About 95% of aimag doctors are women. In \nurban areas, 95% of FGPs are also women. HSDP2 emphasizes assistance to PHC, directly \nbenefiting women as patients and as providers through human resource development. HSDP2 \nthus has a poverty and gender focus.  \n \nE.  Economic Analysis10 \n \n1.  Economic Benefits \n \n78.  Investment  under  HSDP2  is  expected  to  yield  substantial  economic,  social,  and \ninstitutional  benefits.  The  major  benefits  from  HSDP2  are  out-of-pocket  savings,  and \nproductivity gains as more resources are channeled to rural health. HSDP2 will have several \npositive health and welfare impacts that can be quantified in economic terms. HSDP2 is \nexpected to increase the number of persons receiving quality health care and will contribute \ndirectly to improve the productivity of target beneficiaries. Even with relatively conservative \nassumptions, HSDP2 yields an economic internal rate of return of 24.4%. The real rate of return \nis likely to be higher as healthy workers are able to work more productively and earn more than \nunhealthy workers. These benefits exclude externalities that accrue to HSDP2.    \n \n2.  Fiscal Impact \n \n79.  HSDP2 has been designed to minimize recurrent cost implications. The improvement of \nthe health service delivery system is intended to reduce wastage, improve the internal efficiency \nof health service delivery, improve energy efficiency of health facilities, thus reducing the cost of \nhealth care for the individual and society. The incremental recurrent costs of HSDP2 arise \nlargely from increased access to quality health care. Although new construction and renovation \nof health facilities are financed by ADB proceeds, local governments must operate and maintain \nthe premises to ensure sustainability. HSDP invests in PHC that is internationally proven cost-\neffective services that, together with minimized recurrent cost, will increase sustainability.      \n \n80.  The financial sustainability analysis evaluates the impact of HSDP2 on the government \nbudget. From the total project cost of $17.5 million, the Government will finance about $3.5 \nmillion of the total project cost. The Government\u2019s annual share in project costs will average \n$680,000, or 1.1% of the health sector annual budget of $53.9 million. Recurrent costs to be \nborne by the Government during HSDP2 are estimated at $590,000 per year. The budgetary \nimpact of the estimated annual recurrent costs during and after HSDP2 implementation is \nconsidered manageable.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10 Detailed analysis is in Appendix 14 and Supplementary Appendix G.    \n ", "  17 \n \nVI.

Background And Rationale \n \n1.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) developed a national health policy in 1997, but it was not \nformally ratified by Parliament. The  public health policy and other national health programs, \nincluding  the  Soum  Health  Development  Program,  have  been  endorsed  and  provide  a \nframework for strategic development of the health sector. However, in view of rapid change in \nthe  environment,  MOH  needs to review the continued applicability of some programs and \ndevelop policies, particularly those related to health financing and government-wide financial \nreforms, to ensure a comprehensive and coherent health sector strategy.   \n \n2.  The Public Sector Finance Management Law (PSFML) was approved in 2002 and is to \nbe effective from 2003. The Government expects to move rapidly from conventional input- to \noutput-based budgeting. Since PSFML requires public agencies (including hospitals) to be \nfunded based on their outputs or products, the outputs that hospital and health services provide \nneed to be defined and their costs estimated. This process will help identify population needs, \nassess budget needs to address these concerns, and target resources to areas with the \ngreatest need and with the greatest inequity in health outcomes. In the health sector, PSFML \nwould give MOH more control over the budget process and the use of funds to meet overall \nsector  objectives.  PSFML  shifts  the  responsibility  for  health  care  budget  planning  and \nadministration from the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) in Ulaanbaatar and aimag \ngovernors\u2019 offices to MOH central and aimag offices. The PSFML will ensure appropriate \nallocation for health care at the aimag level. The new process can help streamline the health \nsystem, leading to rationalized services and better-targeted interventions. \n \n3.  MOH will have to prepare to administer and monitor reforms, staff will require training in \nmanagement and output-based budgeting, activity and service costs will need estimation based \non output/performance, and performance indicators will need to be identified. MOH lacks staff \nand the skills mix to address this challenge. Staff should be trained and deployed  for these \nfunctions, and the skills mix and capacity strengthened, at the central and aimag levels, to \nensure proper training, administration, and monitoring of the new financial and management \nsystems. \n \n4.  The  role  of  the  Health  Insurance  Fund  (HIF)  in  supporting  public  sector  health \nexpenditures and complementing government budgetary allocations is expected to increase \nsignificantly. In 2002, the sources of health care financing were government budget (74%), HIF \n(23%), and cost sharing by patients (3%). Services covered under HIF include inpatient  and \noutpatient care, and drugs. HIF was established in 1994 and is administered by the State Social \nInsurance General Office (SSIGO) in the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor (MSWL). Health \npolicy and regulations are developed under MOH direction, but health insurance implementation \nand management are under MSWL\u2019s direction. The evolving roles and functions of HIF should \nbe made clear, and the links between  health policy and health insurance implementation \nstrengthened. \n \n5.  HIF aims at universal coverage through a combination of compulsory, voluntary, and \nemployer-employee contributions. Almost 70% of HIF income is from compulsory employer-paid \npremiums. Voluntary contributions were abolished recently and those identified under social \nassistance programs are eligible to receive government subsidies. However, the impact of these \nreforms on the vulnerable, underserved, and poor is unclear. Recent evidence suggests that a \n ", "  Appendix 11  39 \ngrowing number of people, as many as 15% of the population, remain without health insurance \ncoverage, with some groups more affected than others either due to adverse selection or \nliquidity constraints. People\u2019s health could be adversely affected if quality basic health care is \nnot easily accessible and affordable. The system suffers from moral hazard, as appropriate \nregulations and criteria on service use (e.g., hospital admission criteria, length of hospital stay, \netc.) and quality control mechanisms on service delivery are lacking. PSFML has persuaded \nHIF to improve premium collection, streamline pricing mechanisms, set controls, and establish \nchecks and balances. \n \n6.  MOH is working to formalize an essential health care package. The package will focus \non  the  basic  health  needs  of  children  (child  survival  services,  immunization,  integrated \nmanagement of childhood illnesses, nutrition); women (safe motherhood, basic reproductive \nhealth  care,  including  deliveries  and  pre-  and  postnatal  care);  and  adults  (screening  and \ntreatment for tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes). The package has to be refined and its \ncost  estimated  to  provide  the  total  cost  for  package,  which  should  be  supported  by  the \nGovernment.  \n \n7.  An effective health management information system (HMIS) is essential to support \nhealth sector reforms and to monitor project and program outputs. The HMIS framework needs \nreview and streamlining in accordance with changing requirements of the health sector. For \nexample, PSFML will require routine data collection to budget, target, and assess performance. \nTools will have to be developed and timely data collected and analyzed for effective decision \nmaking. To collect and analyze data and routinely monitor financial and health performance \nindicators, a strong HMIS is essential. MOH is trying to refine HMIS but lacks the skills, \ncapacity, and support to do so. \n \nB.  Objectives \n \n8.  The technical assistance (TA) will (i) strengthen MOH and MSWL capacity and improve \nunderstanding of output and performance-based budgeting as required under PSFML, and (ii) \nimprove  HIF\u2019s  effectiveness  and  sustainability.  The  TA  complements  the  project  in \nstrengthening  capacity  to  address  sector  financing,  budgeting,  and  sustainability  issues \ncomprehensively within the framework established by PSFML and health sector strategies; \nproviding strategic planning support; and developing systems to support MOH and HIF through \ntimely and reliable collection and analysis of financial and health performance indicators.   \n \nC.  Scope and Methodology \n \n9.  Drawing on the draft national health policy, public health policy, and other national health \nprograms, the TA will help MOH ensure that health sector strategies are comprehensive and \nconsistent, and define and strengthen the linkages between sector strategies and health care \nfinancing  (including  health  insurance)  policies.  The  TA  will  build  capacity  in  MOH  to \ncomprehensively review and refine the health sector strategy, and build capacity in MOH and \nSSIGO to streamline and formulate pricing and payment mechanisms, including capitation, case \nmix, single purchaser systems, and others. \n \n10.  To support implementation of PSFML, the TA will build capacity in MOH to cost services \nand apply output-based budgeting, through workshops and training. The TA will also help MOH \nfinalize the essential health care package, and cost the package. The TA will help MOH \nstreamline routine HMIS and operational researches, build capacity to handle financial and \n ", "40  Appendix 11 \nnonfinancial data for decision making, and finalize performance-based indicators and targets for \noutput-based budgeting.   \n11.  The TA will help strengthen national consensus on the role and expectations of social \nhealth insurance by supporting a workshop/conference on transition economies\u2019 experiences in \nsocial health insurance. The TA will help strengthen routine working mechanisms between MOH \nand  SSIGO  to  strengthen  the  links  between  health  policy  development,  formulation  of \nregulations, and implementation of health insurance. The TA will build capacity to develop a \npackage  of  health  benefits  (using  principles  of  evidence-based medicine and technology \nassessment); regulations; procedures; provider payment mechanisms; and guidelines on health \ncare use and on quality controls for care provided by health service providers under contract \nwith SSIGO. The TA will also build capacity to reassess the situation among the poor and \nunderserved and to propose mechanisms to protect the poor against catastrophic illness. The \nTA will help improve understanding of international social health insurance models through \nstudy tours, and train staff in social health insurance (procedures, guidelines, and administration \nof social health insurance) through workshops at central and local levels of SSIGO and health \nservice providers.   \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $764,000, of which $464,000 is the foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $300,000  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance $650,000, covering the entire foreign \nexchange  cost  of  $464,000  and  $186,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost  through  the  provision  of \ncounterpart staff, office space for TA administration, and workshop facilities. The TA will be \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s TA funding program on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan of the TA are in Table A11.1.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TA will commence on July 2003 and be completed by December 2004. MOH will be \nthe executing agency. MSWL will be the implementing agency for the TA component on \nstrengthening social health insurance. The TA will have a steering committee headed by the \nstate secretary of MOH, with members including the vice minister; chair of the Social Insurance \nNational Council, MSWL; Director of Economics Operations, Ministry of Finance and Economy; \nand heads of task forces and other relevant persons. The steering committee will oversee \ngovernment coordination, provide timely guidance and management support to the TA, and \nmeet quarterly. \n \n14.  A team of international and local consultants will implement the TA. It will provide 16 \nperson-months of international consultants, who will be specialists in health policy and planning, \nhealth care finance, health insurance, and HMIS. The TA will also provide 48 person-months of \nlocal consultants with expertise in health policy, health economics, public finance, insurance, \npoverty assessment, HMIS, and legal issues.

Introduction  \n \n1.  According to Asian Development Bank (ADB) procedures for environmental and social \nreview of projects, the Second Health Sector Development Project (HSDP2) is in environmental \ncategory B. A limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result from \nHSDP2 implementation but can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized \nperformance standards, guidelines, or design criteria. The following potential environmental, \nhealth, safety, and social impacts of the HSDP2 were analyzed: \n \n(i)  comprehensive  waste  management  plan,  including  handling  and  disposal  of \nmedical and bio-hazardous waste; \n \n(ii)  liquid waste and sewage disposal; \n \n(iii)  management of construction impacts over the planned building period (sediment \nand erosion control, emissions, noise, traffic, worker health and safety); \n \n(iv)  hygiene and implementation of good hospital management practices; and \n \n(v)  employee health and safety training. \n \n2.   HSDP2 will upgrade primary health care (PHC) facilities, including rural  soum health \ncenters, first-referral inter-soum and aimag hospitals, as well as training facilities in five rural \naimags: Bayanhongor, Dornod, Dzavhan, Ovorhangay, and Hentiy.  About 10 soum health \ncenters will be renovated, 10 new soum health centers rebuilt on the existing locations, and 5 \ninter-soum hospitals and 5 existing aimag hospitals renovated. During the first year of HSDP2, a \nlist of facilities for civil works will be finalized and a civil works survey undertaken to assess \nactual needs, make an inventory of facilities and their utilization, and develop flexible standard \ndesigns. Downsizing of facilities, resulting in lower bed capacity, will be pursued in the HSDP2 \ndesign.    \n \n3.  This appendix summarizes  the issues related to  environmental evaluation of aimag \nhospitals and  soum health centers. Aimag hospital issues are based on the aimag hospital at \nChoibalsan, Dornod. The amount of rehabilitation works it needs is typical of the extent of civil \nworks required for the other aimag hospitals included in HSDP2, and also represents the type of \ncivil  works  at  inter-soum and soum  health  centers,  albeit  on  a  much smaller scale.  The \nChoibalsan hospital is the biggest aimag hospital covered by HSDP2. The hospital has a 365-\nbed capacity and offers emergency, inpatient, outpatient, intensive care, maternity, infectious \ndiseases, ophthalmology, dental, and psychiatry services. This study also discusses the scope \nof environmental issues related to soum health care centers, based on  review of Sergelen, \nHulunbuir, Bulgan and Dashbalbar Choibalsan soum health centers, which are representative of \nHSDP2 conditions.  \n \nB.  Assessment \n1.  Climate and Geography \n \n4.  The climate in HSDP2 areas is continental, with very hot, dry summers and long, cold \nwinters. Summer and winter temperatures can vary significantly, due primarily to differences in \n ", "  Appendix 12  43 \nelevation (720\u20132,060 meters above sea level). Average January temperatures range from \u201316 \nto \u201324 degrees Celsius. Mongolia has over 260 sunny days a year, with winds especially strong \nin spring. The rainy season is short, from mid-July to September, with precipitation of less than \n50 millimeters (mm) average per month and a maximum of about 75 mm in July.  HSDP2 areas \nare  not  densely  populated,  have  little  development  activities,  and  are  not  adjacent  to \necologically sensitive areas.  \n \n  2.  Choibalsan Aimag Hospital \n \n5.  Dornod is one of the poorest aimags. It has among the highest levels of infant mortality \nand infectious diseases in the country, and some of the highest death rates due to high \nincidence of liver cancer, tuberculosis, and infectious diseases, and due to high maternal \nmortality and infant mortality.  \u201cHealth Sector of Mongolia 80 Years\u201d indicates the following \nstatistics: liver cancer, 9.33/10,000  people;  tuberculosis,  31.56/10,000;  infectious  diseases, \n227.6/10,000; infant mortality, 46.4/1,000; and maternal mortality, 1.41/1,00. These numbers \nare higher than those other aimags, and other developing countries.  \n \n6.  Choibalsan (population 45,000), the capital of Dornod (population 85,000), is Mongolia\u2019s \nfourth largest city (after Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan, and Erdenet). Apart from animal husbandry, \nseveral important industrial activities are located within the city, including a large abattoir, wool \nproduction, and flour milling.  \n \n7.  The Cholibalsan aimag hospital complex is in the city center and consists of 1\u20134-story \nbuildings  for  inpatients,  maternity,  laundry,  morgue,  pediatrics,  outpatients,  and  infectious \ndiseases. Public transportation connects the hospital to the city. \n \n8.  The  hospital  is  connected  to  the  municipal  wastewater  system,  which  functions \nsatisfactorily.  Electrical  supply  is  provided  through  a  local  grid  system  with  little  or  no \ninterruptions.  No backup power supply is considered for this location but may be needed for the \nother project aimag hospitals and soum health centers if power supply is rated unreliable during \nthe civil works survey. Consideration would then be given to the provision of renewable electric \nsupply measures such as solar panel or wind generators. Solid waste collection and disposal \nare provided by the local city authority. However, the hospital is responsible for the collection \nand disposal of its medical waste. This waste is disposed of on the hospital premises by burning \nin an onsite, locally constructed incinerator.  \n \n9.  Surface Water  and Groundwater.  The hospital is within 500 meters (m) from the \nnearest surface water source (Kherlen River), which is abundant and used to water livestock \nand irrigate vegetables. Surface water quality is acceptable, with direct contamination limited for \nthe most part to unregulated disposal of human excreta and biosediments resulting from \nlivestock traffic upstream. The city water supply system provides Choibalsan aimag hospital with \ngood and abundant water for drinking, washing, and cooking 24 hours a day. Groundwater is \nsufficient, suitable, and used for drinking, washing, cooking, and irrigating.   \n \n10.  Environmentally Sensitive Areas and Hazards. No environmentally sensitive areas \nwere observed near the aimag hospitals. However, inadequate attention to the proper disposal \nof hazardous medical waste does pose a potential problem.   \n \n11.  Air Quality.  Outdoor and indoor air quality is satisfactory for the hospital and health \ncenters.  However,  at  times  airborne  particulates  lower  the  air  quality.  The  movement  of \nlivestock,  pedestrians,  and  vehicles,  as  well  as  strong  winds  may  at  times  cause  slight \n ", "44  Appendix 12 \ndeterioration of indoor air quality, but not frequently or severely enough to cause concern. As \nprotection from extreme winter temperatures, coal ash is used as roof insulation. Given the poor \nstructural integrity of many ceilings and roofs, some suspension of coal ash particles in the air, \nwith subsequent respiration by patients and staff, seems likely.  \n \n12.  Vegetation.  Vegetation around the hospital  and health centers is typically in poor \ncondition due to disturbance by grazing livestock, and vehicular and pedestrian traffic. However, \nthe traffic in the vicinity of the hospital complex is low.  \n \n13.  Endangered Species, Wildlife, and Wildlife Habitat.  There are only a few trees in the \nhospital complex, planted and cared for by hospital staff. Aside from various domestic animals \n(dogs, sheep, horses, goats, and cows), wildlife in and around the hospital is limited to birds, \nsmall  rodents,  and  common  insects  such  as  grasshoppers  and  flies.  The  presence  of \nendangered species is unlikely.  \n \n3.  Soum Health Centers \n \n14.  The average soum population is 3,000, most of whom are herdsmen. A soum health \ncenter consists of a 1\u20132-story building with 5\u201315 beds. It is fenced and about 20\u201350 m away \nfrom the neighboring residential/industrial building. Land use and topography are similar to that \nof the Choibalsan aimag hospital.     \n \n15.  At a soum health center, drinking water is brought from a well onsite maintained by the \nsoum administration. Water quality and quantity are acceptable. Human excrement is collected \nin a pit latrine outside the health center building operated by clinic staff. Wastewater from \nwashing and laundry drains into the ground.  Medical waste is burned in a small locally made \nincinerator outside the building near the latrines. Organs such as placentas are buried deep and \naway from  populated areas. Health centers pay  inadequate attention to proper disposal of \nmedical waste, posing a potential environmental problem. \n \n16.  Surface water is abundant in soums. Groundwater  is sufficient and suitable, and  the \nsource of water for soum health centers. Horses are the main mode of transportation in soums. \nLike hospital areas, soums have no endangered species, wildlife, and wildlife habitat.  \n \n4.  Medical Waste Assessment  \n \n17.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) has regulations on collection, transportation, and disposal \nof medical wastes. Bacteriological laboratory waste should be sterilized in an autoclave, stored \nwith solid waste, and transported for disposal at dedicated solid waste disposal sites. Syringes \nshould be collected in plastic buckets or safety boxes and either burnt or sent to solid waste \nsites. Dressings should be neutralized in chlorine solutions, lysol, or formaldehyde for 24 hours \nand then disposed of with solid waste. Clinical laboratory wastes should be neutralized and then \ndisposed of through the sewerage system. Special medical wastes (body parts, placenta, etc.) \nshould be stored for several days before transport to waste deposal sites and buried. Cytotoxic \nwaste materials (only at aimag hospitals) should be burned only.  \n \n18.  Aimag hospitals and soum health centers do not generally adhere strictly to these \nregulations, mainly due to lack of local budget and, therefore, insufficient waste containers, \nstorage, and collection facilities; insufficient disposal equipment and transport; and lack of staff \ntraining in waste management and safety procedures.   \n ", "  Appendix 12  45 \n19.  Government  Resolution  N256,  2001  proposes  measures  to  strengthen  waste \nmanagement for 2002-2006, including establishment of waste disposal sites in environmentally \nacceptable locations throughout the country. In September 2002,  World Health Organization \n(WHO) consultants assessed medical waste management practices at small, medium-sized, \nand  large  hospitals  and  clinics,  including  on-site  storage,  collection,  and  disposal,  and \nrecommended improvement in waster management.  \n \n20.  MOH has drafted new regulations to guide  medical waste management. They are based \non WHO recommendations. The guidelines will mitigate health and safety hazards to hospital \nworkers  from  toxic  gases,  excessive  radiation,  and  hazardous  solid  waste  such  as  used \ndressings, discarded human body parts, and materials that might contain or have been exposed \nto pathogens. The guidelines will also provide for staff training in safety procedures and medical \nwaste management. \n \n21.  The guidelines will provide standards for collection and disposal of medical waste for \nHSDP2 aimag and inter-soum hospitals and soum health centers, and for design of institutional \narrangements  for  environmental  impact  mitigation.  The  design  of  HSDP2  facilities  for \nconstruction  and  operation  will  follow  these  mitigation  measures.  An  environmental \nmanagement plan, including a  medical waste management plan, will be developed for each \nsubproject.  The  environmental  management  plan  will  summarize  proposed  environmental \nmitigation activities, including a time-bound action plan, and evaluate HSDP2 environmental, \nhealth, and safety activities as reflected in the results of periodic and quantitative sampling and \nmeasuring programs. The aimag health department and MOH will provide technical guidance to \nprepare  the  plan,  following  national  guidelines.  The  assistance  of  Ministry  of  Nature  and \nEnvironment (MONE)2 may be required to identify landfills for medical waste disposal. \n \n22.  The medical waste management plan will cover infectious, hazardous, and other medical \nwaste, which will be segregated in color-coded containers for treatment and disposal. Provisions \nwill be made to store medical waste safely until it can be removed for disposal at off-site \nfacilities. Waste will be transported in custom-built collection bins and transported in special \nvehicles.  Human  anatomical  wastes,  blood  and  fluids,  microbiological  waste,  and  other \nbiotechnical waste will be neutralized and buried. Other wastes will be handled and disposed of \naccording to international standards and procedures laid out in the waste management plan. \nOn-site medical waste disposal sites that do not adhere to the new regulations will be cleaned \nup to required levels.  The plan will also incorporate a health care worker safety and health \nprogram and employee training and orientation. For wastewater collection and treatment, new \ninternal toilets and septic tanks will be provided to treat wastewater for soum health centers that \ndo  not  have  adequate  systems.  The  local  health  departments  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the plan.  \n \n23.  A civil works  quality and environment monitoring committee  will be set up  at each \nHSDP2 aimag to monitor and evaluate HSDP2 compliance with the environmental management \nplan.  The  committee  will  be  composed  of  (i)  the  project  aimag  coordinator;  (ii)  aimag \nprofessional  inspection  services  of  the  MONE;  (iii)  Public  Health  Department,  Policy \nCoordination, and Implementation Division of MOH; and (iv) the aimag health department. The \n                                                 \n1  A  government  decree,  under  preparation,  will define  the  role  of  various  agencies  in different  aspects  of \nenvironmental protection. MONE will regulate issues related to water, air, toxic chemical substances, hazardous \nwastes, etc., while MOH  will be responsible for laws and  regulations associated with health, sanitation, food, \ndrinking water, chemical substances, and medical waste. MONE will establish professional inspection services for \neach aimag and for the various soum centers within them. \n ", "46  Appendix 12 \ncommittee will conduct periodic site supervision visits. The committee\u2019s report will be a part of \nthe project progress report.  \n \n5.  Construction Phase \n \n24.  Adverse environmental impacts due to civil works will be minimal, of short duration, and \nmitigated by design and project management of facilities construction. Trees in HSDP2 aimags \nwill be replanted and other vegetation restored.  \n \n25.  To enhance energy efficiency, building standards will be applied to ensure that building \nenvelopes are tightened, making them resistant to leaks, which will drastically reduce the \namount of heat required by, for example, insulating foundations, and using extruded rigid \npolyurethane insulation, rigid insulation for roofs, and metal thermally glazed windows and \nexternal doors. Coal dust will no longer be used as insulating material. These measures will \nimprove indoor air quality of project health centers. Renewable energy sources will be preferred \nas backup power supply. To prevent potentially harmful emissions from necessary supplemental \nboilers or emergency backup diesel generators, emission stacks will be located downwind of \nbuildings and high enough to minimize exposure of staff and patients to the fumes. \n \nC.  Conclusion \n \n26.  HSDP2  will  meet  the  applicable  ADB  environmental  and  social  policies  and  the \nenvironmental,  health,  and  safety  guidelines  of  the  Government  upon  successful \nimplementation of the agreed-upon mitigation measures. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  47 \nSOCIAL ISSUES \n \nA.  Poverty and Gender Analysis \n \n1.  The Second Health Sector Development Project (HSDP2) has a poverty and gender \nfocus and addresses  health concerns of the rural poor and women, such as infectious and \ncommunicable diseases and reproductive health. HSDP2 will cover five rural aimags with higher \npoverty incidence and worse health outcomes than others: Bayanhongor, Dzavhan, Dornod, \nHentiy, and  Ovorhangay. Poverty, health, and gender considerations justify the selection of \nHSDP2 sites. This section provides an overview of absolute and relative poverty and health \nconditions over time. \n \n2.  Poverty incidence increased from 15% in 19901 to 36% in 1995.2 Absolute poverty has \nstabilized overall since 1995, except in the aimag centers (not including Ulaanbaatar), where \npoverty  incidence  increased  due  to  internal  migration  and  growing  unemployment.  The \npopulation living in extreme poverty increased from 1995 to 1998. Poverty is growing. Urs aimag \nhas the largest population living below poverty, and Dzavhan, the largest population living in \nextreme  poverty.  More  female- than male-headed households live in poverty. Ovorhangay \naimag has the largest proportion of herdsmen.   \n \n3.  The increasing differential in income translates into an increasing differential in the \npopulation\u2019s ability to afford health care. Per capita monthly health expenditure is seven times \ngreater among wealthier  than poorer households. The share of household expenditure for \nhealth among the poor (2.3%) is  substantially larger than  that of the wealthier households \n(1.5%). Several other indirect costs of health are unmeasurable, such as travel cost to health \nfacilities, opportunity cost of time, and drug costs. Many rural health facilities are perceived to \noffer relatively poor quality of care and so patients travel as far as aimag centers and sometimes \nto Ulaanbaatar to attend hospitals. Health insurance subsidies are offered to those defined as \n\u201cvulnerable,\u201d but the income- or food-poor and the unemployed are less likely to be categorized \nas \u201cvulnerable\u201d under the current definition. \n \n4.  The infant mortality rate (IMR) was 64 per 1,000 live births in 2000 (MICS 2000).  MOH \ndata suggest that IMR declined from 64 in 1990 to 35 by 2000, but almost 50% of infant deaths \nare suspected to have been missed through incomplete demographic registration. Rural IMR is \n1.5 times higher than urban IMR, and Dornod aimag has an IMR double that of Dundgobi (which \nhas the lowest IMR). IMR for boys is higher than for girls. \n \n5.  MMR increased to 161 per 100,000 live births in 1996\u20131998 from 119 in 1990 (Maternal \nMortality Survey). In the past decade, MMR increased overall, with rural levels twice those of \nurban areas. Dzavhan, with the largest proportion of extreme poor, has the worst MMR\u2014four \ntimes higher than in Bulgan. Women from herder families are at a higher risk than others, \nrepresenting almost 50% of all maternal deaths. Diseases not related to pregnancy are the \nprimary  cause  of  mortality,  followed  by  pregnancy  complications.3  Abortion  is  a  growing \nconcern. At least 60% of deliveries with complications at aimag hospitals were referred from \nsoum health centers, primarily due to eclampsia. \n \n                                                 \n1 National statistics organization.  \n2 Living Standard Measurement Survey, 1995,1998.   \n3 UNFPA. 2001. Population and Reproductive Health in Mongolia.  \n ", "48  Appendix 13 \n6.  Nutrition of children and adults is extremely poor. Malnutrition and anemia are high \namong children and pregnant women. At least 40% of pregnant women suffered from chronic \nanemia. Poorer households had a higher prevalence of anemia. Poor maternal nutrition leads to \nhigh maternal mortality as well as a growing number of low-weight babies. With promotion of \nbreast-feeding,  undernutrition  among  infants  decreased.  However,  inadequate  household \nfeeding practices have led to relatively poor nutrition among children of 2\u20135 years: 12% of \nunder-5 children were underweight in 1990, and this rate remains the same today. \n \n7.  Tuberculosis, associated with poverty and crowded living conditions, is increasing, with \nthe highest rates reported by Darvhan-uul, Selenge, and Dornod aimags. Respiratory diseases \nare still among the top five diseases. The  health system continues to require resources to \naddress communicable disease concerns. \n \n8.  Health service utilization remains high. Vaccination coverage is almost universal among \nchildren  and  pregnant  women,  and  most  deliveries  are  under  the  care  of  skilled  health \npersonnel. On average, at least five outpatient visits per person per year are reported by public \nsector facilities, with utilization rates at Orkhon aimag at least three times higher than in \nOvorhangay aimag (lowest use).   \n \n9.  Health service utilization among the poor is far lower than among wealthier households4. \nThe poor are more likely to visit soum health centers, primarily because of access and costs of \ncare, whereas the wealthier are more likely to use aimag and private hospitals5. \n \nB.

Improved health will increase opportunities and capacity of the poor to \nparticipate in economic activities, care for their families, and pursue educational opportunities.    \n \n \n2.  Poverty Analysis: Proposed Classification \n   HSDP2 will target poor aimags. Under  the integrated improvement of rural health \nservices component, about 400,000 people in five rural aimags, representing 18% of the \ncountry\u2019s total population, will benefit directly from improved availability and quality of rural \nhealth services. About 48.5% of the  population in these aimags is poor, compared to the \nnational average of 36%. The targeted aimags are not only poorer but also have high endemic \ndisease and infant mortality rates, which are composite proxies for poverty incidence, indicating \nthat most of the population in the aimags faces multiple deprivations.   \n \n \n                                                 \n4 Kainyam, Tungalag. 2000.

HSDP2 will \nalso  facilitate  access  to  PHC  services  among  the  poor.  To  reduce  financial  barriers  and \nproviders\u2019 discriminatory attitudes, HSDP2 plans to introduce incentives for service providers to \nsee  the  poor  through  capitation  payment  mechanisms  weighted  by  the  poverty  rate  and \nperformance-based contracts as for family group practices (FGPs) in urban areas. Subsidies \nand outreach services for the poor and vulnerable groups are stipulated in the contract.   \n \n            HSDP2 is classified as a core poverty intervention.      \n \n \n \n3.  Participation Process   \n            International and local consultants recruited under the project preparatory technical \nassistance carried out a multilevel consultation process with a wide range of stakeholders. Four \nstakeholder  groups  were  identified  and  consulted  across  a  range  of  issues.  Primary \nstakeholders  included  service  users  and  providers  at  the  bag,  soum,  and  aimag  levels. \nSecondary  stakeholders  consisted  of  national  and  local  policy  and  decision  makers.  The \nanalysis of response showed a high degree of concurrence among stakeholders on the causes \nand effects of problems in delivering good-quality and affordable health services, especially to \nthe poor and vulnerable. The main divergence was in perceptions of how the poorest groups are \ntreated, with staff having a much better opinion of their interventions than the recipients, who \nclearly feel discriminated against by individuals and the system. \n \n  The  differences  among  stakeholder  groups  required  a  wide  range  of  participation \nstrategies. For service users and service providers,  the participatory appraisal and planning \nmethod was used. For local and national policy- and decision makers, one-on-one interviews, \ngroup interviews, and  regional workshops were conducted. To deepen participation, project \ncomponent  design  was  done  through  counterpart  groups  in  MOH  and  a  multidisciplinary \nsteering committee (MOH, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance and Economy, Parliament, \nState Social  Insurance  General  Office, university and aimag representatives).  Widespread \nparticipatory discussions took place, particularly to identify needs and demands for capacity-\nbuilding activities to implement reform.    \n \n            Participation input proved to be useful and important to project design, not only because \nof  the  information  provided  but  also  because  of  the  resulting  awareness  of  the  value  of \nparticipation and consultation. The consultation loop set up with stakeholders will be maintained. \n       \n \n4.

Women in Mongolia live longer and are healthier than men. Life expectancy at birth in \n2001 is 61.2 years for men and 68.3 years for women. In terms of healthy life expectancy, which \ntakes into consideration disability in addition to length of life, women have 58.0 years of healthy \nlife, compared to 49.9 years for men.  \n \n11.  However, these better indicators  do not  necessarily mean that women receive better \nsocial and health attention. Maternal mortality, which is largely preventable by the application of \navailable medical knowledge and basic technologies, is unacceptably high and does not show \nany improvement over years. It may even be worsening. Women suffer from an unnecessary \ndisease  burden.  Reproductive  health  conditions  are  the  cumulative  result  of  poverty; \n ", "  Appendix 13  51 \neducational, social, and cultural behavior; and health care factors. This indicates that measures \nto improve reproductive heath must be carefully planned and targeted.        \n \n \n \n12.  HSDP2 is classified under gender and development because of the significant benefits \nthat women receive. HSDP2 pursues health system reform and health service improvement that \nwill equally benefit men and women but includes specific actions to improve women\u2019s health. \nThis gender plan delineates specific approaches to ensure positive impact on women\u2019s health. \nThis gender plan is also expected to help the Government to achieve Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) for women.   \n \n13.  The following scope of the gender plan will be implemented as part of HSDP2: \n \n  (i)  Integrated improvement of rural health services  \n \na.  HSDP2 will focus on PHC; strengthen bag feldshers (community nurses), \nwhose  major  responsibility  is  reproductive  health  and  soum  health \ncenters, where more than 30% of patients are women of reproductive age \nand another 40% are children. Support to the bags and soum levels will \nbenefit women greatly. Aimag hospitals will be strengthened to provide \nquality services to referral cases of pregnant women and children.  \nb.  Through  civil  works  and  equipment  provision,  HSDP2  will  improve \nworking  conditions  in  rural  facilities,  where  most  health  workers  are \nwomen.  \nc.  HSDP2 will train PHC rural health workers, most of whom are women, to \nprovide efficient outreach services to achieve MDGs.    \n \n  (ii)  Institutional capacity development  \n \na.  HSDP2 will provide a refresher course to all FGPs and a basic course to \nnew FGPs. Training will include provision of efficient outreach services to \nachieve MDGs.    \n \nb.  HSDP2 will provide basic equipment and train FGPs, most of whom are \nwomen.   \n \nc.  The  FGP  monitoring  system  will  be  strengthened  to  assess  the \nsatisfaction level of the poor and women.  \n \nd.  HSDP2 will increase MOH and local government capacity in planning a \nhealth system, and services that are efficient, effective, sustainable, and \nresponsive to diverse needs of different client groups, including the poor, \nwomen, men at health risk, and children. \n \n  (iii)  Project management  \n     \nData for project performance monitoring and evaluation system will be gender \ndisaggregated. \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \n \n14.  Through the gender plan, HSDP2 aims to accomplish the following: \n \n(i)  Approximately 120,000 women of reproductive age, living in five HSDP2 rural \naimags, will have improved access to quality reproductive health services. \n \n(ii)  Approximately  200,000  women  living  in  five  HSDP2  rural  aimags  will  be \nencouraged  to  promote  their  health and  adopt  health-seeking behavior for \nthemselves and their families.    \n \n(iii)  More than 7,000 urban and rural women PHC workers will be trained . \n \n(iv)  Working conditions will improve  in rural  facilities in five HSDP2 rural aimags, \nwhere most health workers are women.   \n \n15.  ADB will work with the Government to ensure that the gender plan is implemented and \nwill contribute to achieving the MDGs. Progress of the gender plan will be included in quarterly \nprogress reports.  \n \nD.  Ethnic Minority Assessment \n \n16.  Most Mongolians are Khalkh (81.5%). More than 30 ethnic and minority groups account \nfor  18.2%  of  the  population.  Ethnic  minority  groups  are  concentrated in  three  aimags\u2014\nBayanolgiy, Urs, and Khovd.  \n \n17.  Table A13.1 shows ethnic minority groups in HSDP2 aimags. Substantial ethnic minority \npopulations  exist  in  Dornod  and  Hentiy,  while  in  other  HSDP2  aimags,  minority  group \npopulations are very small.     \n \n18.  No data are available on health status by ethnic minority group. However, information is \navailable on literacy and education (Table A13.2). No significant difference is noticed among \nethnic minorities in education opportunities. The Constitution indicates that no person will be \ndiscriminated against based on ethnic origin, and guarantees equal access to education among \nethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities may thus be assumed not to be disadvantaged in access to \nhealth services, and health status.   \n \n19.  No specific information is collected on occupation by ethnic group. In 2000, 47% of the \npopulation depended on agriculture for their livelihood. Ethnic groups have lived in the same \nplace for centuries\u2014highly concentrated in Bayanolgiy, Urs, and Hovd\u2014with no significant \nchanges in their lifestyle. Ethnic groups participate in community activities with equal rights as \nthe rest of the population. All the population speaks Mongolian, but in Khazakh the ethnic \nminority speaks its own language and, in accordance with article 8 of the Constitution, this \nnational minority is allowed to use its native language in education, communication, and the \npursuit of cultural artistic and scientific activities.   \n \n20.  Given the equal levels of social indicators among ethnic minorities, no  indigenous \npeople\u2019s development plan or special actions in favor of any particular group are needed. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  53 \n \nTable A13.1.

Economic Rates of Return and Project Benefits \n \n1.  The major benefits from the Second Health Sector Development Project (HSDP2) are \nout-of-pocket savings and productivity gains as more resources are channeled to rural health. \nEven with relatively conservative assumptions, HSDP2 yields an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 24.4%. The real rate of return is likely to be higher as healthy workers are more \nproductive and earn higher wages than unhealthy workers. These benefits exclude externalities \nthat accrue to HSDP2. The economic rate of return analysis covers 20 years (2003\u20132022), and \nis carried out in constant 2002 US dollar prices, with domestic prices used as numeraire. \nEconomic  costs  were  calculated  based  on  the  annual  project  cost  disbursements,  and \nincremental recurrent costs estimated at about 0.5%1 of capital costs. Tradable goods of capital \nand operations and maintenance costs were adjusted based on a shadow exchange rate factor \nof 1.1.2 Tradable goods are about 30% of project costs.

HSDP2 will also rehabilitate and rebuild health centers and \nhospitals by downsizing facilities and improving energy efficiency. Rehabilitated facilities under HSDP2 will thus \nrequire lower recurrent costs than before.  \n2  Based on Asian Development Bank guidelines for Mongolia. \n ", "  Appendix 14  55 \n2.  HSDP2 aims to focus on health concerns of the rural poor, such as infectious and \ncommunicable diseases. About 400,000 people in the five aimags will directly benefit from \nHSDP2 interventions. The support to rural primary health in HSDP2 aimags will play a key role \nin decreasing maternal mortality and general morbidity. Health and poverty indicators in HSDP2 \naimags are worse than the national average. These aimags also have poor services. As \nelsewhere in Mongolia, inpatient admission is about 20%. The average visits/person/year in \nmost HSDP2 aimags (2.5) is lower than the national average (4.6). The high use of inpatient \n(curative)  compared  to  outpatient  services  is  prevalent  as  indicated  by  high  utilization  of \nhospitals (98%). HSDP2 therefore aims to provide access and quality at primary health care \n(PHC), thereby freeing capacities at the secondary and tertiary levels. Based on international \nstandards on average length of stay, HSDP2 aimags have excess capacity of 2,200\u20133,000 beds \nper year.  \n \nB.  Benefit Assumptions \n \n3.  HSDP2 will have several positive impacts on the population\u2019s health and welfare that \ncan be quantified in economic terms. HSDP2 is expected to increase the number of persons \nreceiving quality health care and will contribute directly to improving the productivity  of target \nbeneficiaries. The strengthening of these facilities will have an important health and social \nimpact in revitalizing the aimag and soum centers. Economic benefits will potentially include \nhigh social returns from the investment through (i) resource cost savings and (ii) productivity \nbenefits from target beneficiaries.   \n \n4.  Cost savings consist of a reduction in private out-of-pocket expenses for health care as \na result of (i) increased access to rural health services to reduce transport cost; (ii) improved \nhealth service delivery to reduce cost of treatment from public preventive health care in lieu of \nprivate consultation/treatment; and (iii) reforms in health financing to reduce cost of health \nservices, especially the poor. \n \n5.  Productivity gains are the result of less time lost to illness, and increase in productivity of \nadults and children. Improving people\u2019s health will lead to fewer days lost from illness without \nthe health interventions improved by HSDP2. The base case assumes that benefits will accrue \nto  improved  productivity  due  to  efficient  treatment  and  easily  available  services.  In  the \ncalculation of benefits, the target population in the five aimags was used to calculate the number \nof patients that will benefit from HSDP2. The annual number of patients who will incur cost \nsavings and productivity gains is based on the difference between health incidence with and \nwithout HSDP2. The following describe the assumptions in more detail.  \n \n6.  Cost Savings.   These are the annual benefits expected as a result of savings from \naverage out-of-pocket expenses expected to be incurred had the patient been treated at a \nprivate hospital rather than at a public health center. Benefits are calculated based on $100 \nannual incremental costs that a patient will incur to go to a private facility, assuming four visits \nper year, at $25 savings per visit on transport and co-payments. The number of patients who \nvisit PHC facilities covered by HSDP2 are estimated based on the population of each aimag, \ntimes the health incidence related to infectious diseases. The average number of infectious \ndiseases (per 10,000 people) ranged from about 68 (Ovorhangay) to 225 (Dornod) (1996\u2013\n2000). The number of patients is equal to the aimag population times the number of infectious \ndisease/10,000 people times number of outpatient visits per year.   \n \n7.  Productivity. This is the expected benefit from increased earnings or inflows and is \nquantified based on the following:  \n ", "56  Appendix 14 \n  \n(i)  Productivity  benefits  from  HSDP2  will  result  from  increased  lifespan  due  to \nimproved access to quality health care covering infectious diseases. HSDP2 \nbenefits are quantified based on the number of target beneficiaries (five aimags) \nmultiplied by the potential earnings (minimum income level of MNT 22,500 in \n2002).  It  is  assumed  that  over  6,000  people  per  year  will  have  increased \nproductivity due to HSDP2. The targeted improvement in health indicators of \ninfectious diseases is consistent with Ministry of Health (MOH) goals, based on \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) 2015.  \n \n(ii)  Productivity from lives saved is computed based on the number of lives saved \nfrom improved maternal mortality rate (MMR), infant mortality rate (IMR), and \nunder-5 mortality multiplied by the average annual per capita income of $350. \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), (2001), each life year is \nvalued at around three times annual earnings. Lives saved are thus assumed to \nbe equivalent to 3 years\u2019 earnings3 resulting from project interventions related to \nimproved  MMR,  IMR,  and  under-5  mortality  under  HSDP2.  The  targeted \nimprovement in MMR, IMR, and under-5 mortality is based on HSDP2 targets, \nwhich are consistent with MOH goals and MDGs. From 1990 to 2007, MDGs are \nexpected to decrease MMR from 1.2 to 1.02, IMR from 63.4 to 26.8, and under-5 \nmortality from 87.5 to 35.4. The improvements in these health indicators were \nused to calculate the number of patients that will have increased productivity \nunder HSDP2. \n \n8.  The base assumptions used for the economic analysis of benefits are presented in Table \nA14.2. Reasonable assumptions about the coverage and effect of the project have been made \non the cost-and-benefit streams.  \n \n9.  Sensitivity Analysis.  Table A14.3 presents the results of the alternative scenarios to \ntest the sensitivity of HSDP2 to less optimistic assumptions. The \u201cless cost savings\u201d scenario \nassumes that HSDP2 is not successful in reducing out-of-pocket expenses. Finally, the \u201clow \ncase\u201d scenario combines \u201cless cost savings\u201d and \u201clower productivity\u201d from lives saved. Even \nwith more pessimistic assumptions, HSDP2 has a positive return of 18%. \n                                                 \n3 J. Sachs and G.H. Brundtland. 2001.

Fiscal Impact \n \n10.  Mongolia made impressive gains in macroeconomic adjustment in the early transition \nyears. However, during recent years, average growth rate has dropped and high unemployment \ncontinued. The growth in national income declined to 1.1% in 1990\u20132000. Mongolia\u2019s per capita \ngross domestic product (GDP) declined to $390 in 2001. Poverty remains high, and 36% of the \npopulation lives below the poverty line. \n \n11.  The declining economy has translated into a weakening public sector resource base for \nhealth. The transition to a market economy has resulted in a decline in public health expenditure \nas a percentage of GDP, from 5.4% in 1990 to 4.2% in 2000. Total public sector health \nexpenditure was $39.5 million equivalent or only $17 per capita in 2000. This amounts to about \n4.2% of GDP, or about 10.5% of total government expenditures. In real terms, the share and \namount for health have declined in the past decade but trends in recent years have indicated \nincreased spending in the health sector. Despite this, the 2003 health budget reflects long \nstanding weaknesses in the health sector, including an oversized tertiary sector, high utility \ncosts, and inadequate capital investment. The budget also represents changes consistent with \nthe new sector strategies, including greater investment in rural health service, and expanding \nrole for health insurance and greater involvement of the private sector.  \n \n12.  HSDP2 will address these weaknesses and support the proposed reforms. HSDP2 has \nbeen designed to minimize recurrent cost implications for the Government. The improvement of \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \nhealth service delivery systems under HSDP2 is intended to reduce wastage, improve the \ninternal efficiency of health service delivery, thus reducing the cost of health care for the \nindividual and society. The incremental recurrent costs of HSDP2 arise largely from increased \naccess to quality health care. Although new construction and renovation of health facilities are \nbeing  financed,  sustainability  is  being  ensured  by  the  prior  commitment  of  the  local \ngovernments to operate and maintain the premises.  FGP recurrent costs are expected to be \nfinanced through the health insurance fund and have, since 2000, comprised about 9% of public \nhealth expenditure.   \n \n13.  The financial sustainability analysis evaluates the impact of HSDP2 on the government \nbudget. The total financial cost of HSDP2, inclusive of taxes, duties, contingencies, and interest \ncharges, is $17.5 million for around 5 years. The Government\u2019s annual share in HSDP2 costs \nwill average around $680,000 equivalent, or about 1.1% of the health sector average annual \nbudget of about $53.9 million annually. The recurrent costs to be borne by the Government \nduring HSDP2 are estimated to be about $590,000 million per year and include (i) the operating \nexpenses of the project implementation unit, and Directorate for Medical Services; and (ii) \noperational, maintenance, and replacement costs of new and renovated health facilities and \nequipment under HSDP2. FGPs under HSDP2 will continue to be funded by the Government \nduring  and  after  HSDP2  implementation.  The  budgetary  impact  of  the  estimated  annual \nrecurrent costs during and after HSDP2 implementation is considered minimal.   \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R85-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20030515164536Z", "Title": "R85-03", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030606162118+08'00'"}, "author_page": " \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  This report was prepared by a team consisting of T.
