The project \naims to enhance the country\u2019s competitiveness and boost inclusive growth by improving market-\nrelevant  skills  development  for  youth  and  unemployed  job  seekers.  It  will  develop  a  skilled \nworkforce \ninformation  and \ncommunication technology (ICT), agribusiness and food processing, and machinery repair and \nmaintenance. \n \n\nin  five  priority  trades:  construction,  textiles  and  garments, \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nProgress  in  strengthening  economic  growth  and  competitiveness.  With  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  growing  at  an  average  rate  of  7.1%  from  2004  to  2019,1 the  country \ngraduated  to  lower  middle-income  status  in  2011  and  more  than  halved  the  poverty  rate  from \n25.8% in 2005 to 11.4% in 2018. Under significant reforms to trade, tariffs, energy, and exchange \nrates,  the  World  Bank  Ease  of  Doing  Business  ranking  improved from  87th  in  2016  to  69th  in \n2020. Total foreign direct investment more than tripled from $2.9 billion in 2018 to $9.3 billion in \n2019 and exports increased by 26.2% in the same period. Strong investment growth and higher \nagricultural output and construction activity accelerated real GDP growth in Uzbekistan. \n \n3. \nImpediments  to  improving  competitiveness.  Skills  shortages  have  been  a  critical \nconstraint  for  private  sector  growth  and  economic  diversification.  Thirty-five  percent  of  firms \nreported that employee skills posed a \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201cvery severe\u201d obstacle to growth, and industrial \nenterprises  experienced  the  most  difficulty  in  finding  skills  (49%  reported  a  lack  of  qualified \nspecialists).2 Micro and small enterprises (MSEs), concentrated in private sector and the biggest \ncontributor to jobs, suffered from lost business due to lack of suitable skills.3 According to a survey \nof employers, 20% of MSEs reported that they were unable to invest and 23% reported reduced \nbusiness  turnover  because  of  a  shortage  of  skills.4 Large  companies  may  organize  internal  or \ncontracted training for their employees to fill the gap, but MSEs lack the means to do so. \n \n4. \nHigh-growth  economic  sectors.  Some  fast-growing  economic  sectors  have  high \npotential to drive economic growth and create jobs. Food processing, textiles, and garments are \ncompetitive  export  sectors. 5 Construction,  a  main  source  of  migrant  workers,  employed  1.24 \nmillion people in January\u2013September 2019 and grew at 11%\u201312% in 2017\u20132019. ICT grew at \nabout 8% yearly in 2013\u20132019 (footnote 1). ICT companies of India and the Republic of Korea \nregard  Uzbekistan  as  a  hub  for  outsourcing  services  from  member  countries  of  the \nCommonwealth of Independent States.6 However, to realize the potential growth of these sectors, \nskilled  and  semiskilled  workers  are  needed  in  areas  such  as  quality  control,  production  and \nprocessing, machine operation and repair, programming, and system management. \n\n \n\n1  State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics, 2020. \n2  M. Ajwad et al. 2014. The Skills Road: Skills for Employability in Uzbekistan. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n3  Presidential Decree No. 1987 defines MSEs, although the government is proposing a legal definition on medium-\nsized enterprises. In 2017, the public sector contributed 17% of total employment while the private sector 83%; and \nthe MSEs hired 10.5 million people (78%) (State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics, 2019).  \n4  The survey (2018) was supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016.

Washington, DC. \n6  Government of Uzbekistan, Ministry for Development of Information Technologies and Communications, 2020. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n5. \nSocioeconomic  consequences  of  COVID-19.  The  GDP  growth  projection  for  2020 \ndropped to 0.5% from 5.6% in 2019.7 With the returned migrant workers and the reduced labor \nmigration outflow, the number of migrant workers as of June 2020 was 232,000 lower than in the \nfirst quarter of 2020. The number of unemployed people rose sharply from 1.4 million in 2019 to \n1.9 million by June 2020, resulting in a rise in the unemployment rate from 9.0% to 13.2%; and \none out of five youth (aged 16\u201330) were unemployed during January\u2013June 2020.8 Beyond social \nprotection  assistance,  labor  market  interventions  are  in  tremendous  demand,  including  skills \ndevelopment and employment services, especially for youth and unemployed job seekers.  \n \n6. \nEmployment services. The employment services are yet to meet the needs of employers \nand job seekers. Public employment services (PESs) cover the registration of job vacancies and \njob seekers, career counseling and job matching, and referrals to reskilling services. PES centers \nare located in all regions and have staff working within communities. However, PESs have limited \ncapacity, especially in identifying MSEs\u2019 needs and matching job requirements and job seekers\u2019 \nskills profiles.9 This is partly because PES staff have received limited training (mainly initial job \ninduction and follow-up job reaccreditation), which is not in areas to improve their professional \ncapacity. It is also because incomplete labor market information makes it challenging for the PES \ncenters  to  perform  their  duties. 10 Quarterly  labor  force  surveys,  undertaken  by  the  National \nScientific Center for Employment and Labor Protection (NSCELP) since 2018, largely focus on \nobtaining  unemployment  data.  The  main  functions  of  labor  market  analysis  (e.g.,  skills  gap \nestimation) are lacking and cannot inform the planning of training needs.  \n \n7. \nReskilling. Training to reskill workers has increased, but barely meets the needs of the \nsemiskilled and skilled workforce in fast-growing economic trades. Reskilling training has picked \nup  since  2017\u2014about  25,000  unemployed  people  (70%  women)  in  2018  and  33,000  in  2019 \n(81%  women)  were  trained  with  financing  from  the  State  Employment  Promotion  Fund. 11 \nHowever, most reskilling training consists of very short work-based apprenticeships in crafts and \nservice trades. Only 3,900 registered unemployed job seekers (53% women) obtained reskilling \nservices  from  the  six  operating  professional  training  centers  (PTCs)  in  2019.  Private  training \nservice providers are mostly in areas such as languages and accounting, which do not require \nsignificant capital investment; and private employment service agencies concentrate on migration \nservices, highly paid jobs at profitable enterprises, or jobs that require professional qualifications \nnot found in the labor market.12 \n \n8. \nSkills development. The development of skills is in a critical transition. A fixed 3-year, \ncompulsory,  free  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training (TVET),  equivalent to  grades \n10\u201312 for students aged 16 years and above, was provided until 2018.13 However, the approach \nof universal access to TVET did not produce sound labor market outcomes. Only 40.7% of new \n\n \n\n7  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Update: Wellness in Worrying Times. Manila. \n8  Government of Uzbekistan, Ministry of Employment and Labor Relations (MOELR), 2020. \n9  The PES centers reported that about 20% of job information came from MSEs. \n10  A  labor  market  information  system  will  be  established  under  the  World  Bank-financed  Strengthening  the  Social \n\nProtection System Project (2019\u20132024) in the country. \n\n11 The  State  Employment  Promotion  Fund  is  administered  by  the  MOELR.  One  of  its  mandates  is  \u201cfinancing  of \nexpenses related to the organization of the provision of high-quality vocational training services, and retraining and \nsocial protection of the unemployed people, primarily youth, women and persons with disabilities.\u201d Resolution of the \nCabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 1066. \n\n12 A.  Abdusaidov.  2020.  Organizational  Mechanism  of  Interaction  between  the  State  and  Non-State  Employment \n\nStructures in the Labour Market. Journal of Critical Reviews. 7 (11). pp. 510\u2013514. \n\n13 By 2017, 1,064,028 students (48.1% girls) or 87.0% of the general education graduates were enrolled in TVET. The \nTVET reform followed the recent expansion of free and compulsory general education from Grade 9 to Grade 11. \n\n\f 3 \n\nTVET  graduates  were  reported  to  be  employed  in  academic  year  2017/18  in  their  area  of \nspecialization.14 Among those employed, 60% were hired below their levels of qualifications, as \nthe  skills  learned  at  the  technical  and  vocational  educational  institutions  (TVEIs)  were  not \nadequate  for  the  expected  job  performance  (footnote  4).  The  TVET  reform,  started  in  2017, \nsuspended  TVEIs  from  enrolling  new  students  from  2018.  In  2019,  the  number  of  TVEIs  was \ndrastically  reduced  from  1,423  to  630  alongside  the  significant  reduction  of  in-service  TVET \nteachers. 15 TVEIs  are  resuming  enrollment  in  academic  year  2020/21,  but  are  not  ready  to \norganize relevant and quality skills development because of various constraints. \n \n9. \nRelevance  and  quality  of  skills  development.  The  TVET  system  needs  to  improve \ntraining  quality  and  relevance,  as  it  has  mainly  delivered  training  focused  on  knowledge-\nacquisition rather than competency acquisition. TVET teachers have been divided into theoretical \n\u201cteachers\u201d  and  practical  \u201cmasters,\u201d  separating  their  practical  experience  from  their  technical \nknowledge.  Teachers  have  been  mostly  recruited  from  fresh  university  graduates  who  usually \nhave no industry working experience. Every 3 years, teachers undergo compulsory training to be \nreaccredited,  but  such  training  is  often  too  theoretical  and  does  not  help  upgrade  teachers\u2019 \ntechnical  and  workplace  experience.  Equipment  in  TVEIs  is  mostly  outdated  and  assessment \ndoes not reflect industry practices. The often government-led placement arrangements between \nTVEI  graduates  and  employers  are  not  demand-driven.  TVEI  training  can  barely  respond  to \nmarket  needs,  as  TVEIs  are  only  allowed  to  deviate  a  maximum  of  15%  from  the  curriculum \ncontent.  Career  guidance  and  soft  skills  training  are  rarely  in  place,  and  entrepreneurship \ndevelopment  is  preliminary.  Lack  of  effective  collaboration  or  interaction  between  TVET  and \nindustry  is  also  a  main  constraint  behind  these  issues.  The  Ministry  of  Higher  and  Secondary \nSpecialized  Education  (MHSSE),  which  is  in  charge  of  the  curricula,  training  materials,  and \nteacher  development,  needs  to  improve  its  capacity  in  collaborating  with  industry.  The  TVET \nmonitoring  system,  under  the  MHSSE,  is  fragmented  and  unable  to  support  evidence-based \ndecision-making. PTCs, formerly as TVEIs, confront the same problems even if they have initiated \nmarket-responsive training and involving industry professionals in teaching and assessment. \n \n10. \nDistance learning. Following the impact of the COVID-19, demand for distance learning \nis soaring. Only 45% of the population can access 3G internet, compared with an average of 79% \nin  lower  middle-income  countries.  The  monthly  payment  for  1-gigabyte  mobile-broadband \npostpaid computer-based internet is four times as high as the average for lower middle-income \ncountries.16 Nonetheless, a  quick  sample  survey  of the  TVEIs  and  PTCs reveals  that (i)  about \n70% of colleges have internet access; (ii) teachers in 76% of colleges regularly use digital tools \nduring their lessons, and students in 47% of colleges regularly use digital tools to complete their \nassignments; and (iii) about 95% of teachers and 80% of students use a smartphone.17 Various \ntraining programs have been developed with distance learning materials, but not systematically. \nAn e-learning platform to support interactive learning for different learners is lacking, and feasible \nsolutions to improve distance learning for skills development are needed.  \n\n \n\n14 Government of Uzbekistan, Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education (MHSSE), 2018. \n15 TVET is no longer compulsory following the reform. The TVET system now consists of (i) professional schools under \nthe MHSSE, providing 2-year programs for Grade 9 graduates; (ii) professional colleges under sector line ministries, \nproviding 6- to 24-month programs for Grade 11 graduates; and (iii) technikums (technical colleges), some under the \nMHSSE and some under sector line ministries, providing 2- or 3-year programs for Grade 11 graduates. Given the \npressing need to reskill unemployed job seekers, 30 TVEIs were shifted to the MOELR and will be turned into PTCs. \nOther TVEIs were shifted to general education and higher education. \n\n16 Uzbekistan is ranked 69th out of 100 countries on The Inclusive Internet Index 2020. K. Anderson, E. Ginting, and \nK. Taniguchi. 2020. Country Diagnostic Study: Uzbekistan\u2014Quality Job Creation as a Cornerstone for Sustainable \nEconomic Growth. Manila: ADB. \n\n17 The survey (2020) was supported by ADB. 2019. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Preparing \n\nthe Skills Development for a Modern Economy Project. Manila (TA 9727-UZB). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nGender and social disparities in labor market outcomes. Although gender equality has \n11. \nbeen achieved in enrollment for skills development, most females enroll in courses on pedagogy, \nsewing, and health care that lead to low-paying jobs.18 Female labor market participation is 53.4% \ncompared with 78.0% for men.19 The unemployment rate for women in the first half of 2020 was \n17.4%, up from 11.6% in 2018.20 The concentration of women\u2019s jobs in the service sector partly \naccounted for the rise. Persons with disabilities (PWD) lack access to skills development. The \ngovernment estimated that about 162,000 PWD would be able to work in reasonable facilities with \nsufficient  attention  and  support. 21  Nevertheless,  in  2019,  only  135 PWD  obtained  reskilling \ntraining organized by PESs and, among them, 33 were trained in PTCs. The lack of PWD-friendly \nfacilities in regular TVET institutions is a key constraint, among others. \n \n12.  Weak  sector  management  and  governance.  The  Ministry  of  Employment  and  Labor \nRelations (MOELR) coordinates skills development for employability. However, it lacks evidence-\nbased  planning  because  of  its  limited  institutional  capacity  in  data  collection,  analysis,  and \nreporting. The TVET sector is yet to collaborate closely with industry from the onset of the skills \ndevelopment process because of the lack of trade associations or sector skills councils (SSCs). \nFurther,  outdated  occupational  standards  no  longer  reflect  current  professions\u2019  requirements. \nAlthough  a  national  qualifications  framework  (NQF)  was  published  in  May  2020,  it  lacks  a \ncomposition of sector qualifications frameworks, so it may not be aligned with industry practice. \n \nGovernment strategies. Investing in human capital to enable private sector growth and \n13. \nimprove  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  is  the  government\u2019s  top  priority.22 It  plans  to  implement \nemployment programs to ensure the employment of higher and secondary specialized education \ngraduates,  and  organize  training  for  workforce  development.  The  TVET  sector  reform  aims  to \ndevelop market-relevant skills through institutional changes. The Education Sector Plan, 2019\u2013\n2023 stresses the importance of matching skills development with the demand of employers via \neffective  partnership  between  TVET  and  industry.23 In  2020,  the  government  aims  to  increase \nshort-term training and the State Employment Promotion Fund, with aid from the Anti-Crisis Fund, \nto  benefit  access  to  job  and  business  development,  especially  for  PWD.  The  MOELR  has \n(i) initiated subsidies for enterprises whose employees were sent for training during the business \ndownturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) engaged nongovernment organizations to give \nentrepreneurship  training  to  women  in  disadvantaged  areas,  and  (iii) provided  incentives  for \ncompanies  hiring  PWD.  These  actions  are  all  critical  for  building  a  competent  and  adaptive \nworkforce to achieve competitiveness, diversification, and resilience in an inclusive economy. \n \n14. \nAlignment with ADB strategies. The project aligns with the country partnership strategy \nfor Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through (i) supporting private \nsector development by preparing skilled workers, and (ii) reducing economic and social disparities \nby  reskilling  youth  and  unemployed  job  seekers.24 It  mainly  supports  four  ADB  Strategy 2030 \noperational  priorities:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities  by  promoting \nyouth, women, and PWD in developing market-relevant skills; (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality by encouraging women\u2019s skills development for nontraditional jobs; (iii) tackling climate \n\n \n\n18 The wage gap is 35% between women and men.

This output will support  \nthe  skills  development  sector  governance  by  (i)  strengthening  SSCs  and  sector  skills  working \ngroups  (SSWGs)  for  the  priority  trades  to  enhance  the  linkages  between  industries  and  skills \ndevelopment systematically; (ii) updating occupational competency standards in targeted areas \nand sector qualification frameworks for the selected trades to improve the applicability, in line with \nindustry practice; (iii) supporting the NSCELP on labor market information monitoring, analysis, \nand reporting, with national skills gap surveys conducted to inform the evolving demand for skills \nand  guide  the  plan  for  training  needs;  (iv) strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  national  skills \ncompetition under the WorldSkills standards; and (v) enhancing the capacity for the development \nof  distance  learning  materials  in  the  targeted  areas  and  providing  basic  personal  protection \nproducts at the targeted PTCs and TVEIs to ensure skills development service continuity during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The SSWGs and SSCs will provide the institutional force to ensure that \nindustry needs are reflected in skills development and lead in any further review for updating the \ntraining programs. To supplement the skills gap surveys, tracer studies will be done for the project-\ninvolved PTC and TVEI graduates to assess their employability and inform in-time responses for \nimproving the quality of skills development. \n \nC. \n \n19. \nADB has long-standing experience in skills development. Experience and lessons from \nprevious support in the sector and from other projects in the country indicate that (i) to increase \nthe relevance and quality of TVET, companies and industry associations should be involved in all \nsteps,  from  the  definition  of  competency  standards  and  the  development  of  curricula  to  the \nprovision  of  training  and  competency  assessment;  (ii)  continuous  tracking  of  graduates\u2019 \nperformance is needed; (iii) the development of e-learning requires strong ownership, long-term \nintervention,  and  compatibility  of  policies,  infrastructure,  and  institutional  capacity;  and  (iv)  the \ngovernment\u2019s procurement capacity needs solid improvement.33 The project\u2019s key and innovative \nfeatures  include  (i)  a  timely  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  by  supporting  government \nexpenditure on social assistance and labor market interventions, and complementing other ADB \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n32 The facilities include advanced equipment, and renovation and reconstruction with gender- and PWD-inclusive and \nenergy-saving infrastructure, including alternative energy provision (solar panels).

The  first  deputy  minister  of  the  MOELR  will  serve  as  the  project \ndirector.  The  MOELR  and  the  MHSSE  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The  project  will  be \nimplemented  by  two  project  implementation  units  (PIUs).  PIU  1  will  be  established  under  the \nMOELR to support the implementation of project activities related to and/or assigned under the \nMOELR (outputs 1 and 3), and take charge of project coordination. PIU 2 will be established under \nthe MHSSE to support the implementation of project activities related to and/or assigned under \nthe MHSSE (output 2).\n\nA project steering committee, chaired by the MOELR and cochaired by the MHSSE, will \n25.\nbe  established  with representatives from other agencies.  The project steering  committee is an \ninterministerial  consultative  body  that  will  be  responsible  for  providing  policy  or  strategic  level \ndecision-making for the project, and endorsing the annual project budget plan, including ensuring \nthe timely availability of counterpart financing, and monitoring the resolution of any audit findings.\n\nA project implementation support firm (PISF) will be hired to support the PIUs in project \n26.\nimplementation, monitoring,  and reporting. Individual financial management and environmental \nsafeguard consultants will also work at the PIUs. The MOELR and MHSSE, under government \nprocedures,  will  engage  the  single-contracted  authority  in  charge  of  civil  works  under  each \nrelevant hokimiyat (regional government) to contract constructors. Design and quality monitoring \nfirms will be hired to (i) develop detailed designs for renovation and reconstruction, and (ii) support \nthe  MOELR  and  MHSSE,  respectively,  to  coordinate  with  the  single-contracted  authorities  in \nmonitoring and supervising the quality and compliance of the construction process.\n\nImplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \n\n27.\nPAM (footnote 37).\n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nDecember 2020\u2013December 2026 \n31 December 2026 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2027 \nManagement \n\n(i) Oversight body\n\nProject steering committee \nMOELR (chair); MHSSE (co-chair) \nMinistry of Finance; Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade; Ministry of Economic \nDevelopment and Poverty Reduction; Ministry of Agriculture; Ministry of \nConstruction; Ministry for Development of Informational Technologies and \nCommunications; Uzbektextile (Association for Textiles and Garment Industry); \nsector skills councils (members)  \n\n\f 9 \n\nAspects \n\nArrangements \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\nState Inspection for Supervision of Quality in Education (observer) \nMOELR \nMOELR and MHSSE  \n\n \n \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\n$5,374,000  \n\n$52,755,000  \n\nMultiple contracts \n\nMultiple contracts \n\n(iv)  Implementation units  PIU 1 under the MOELR, 8 main staff and 5 support staff \nPIU 2 under the MHSSE, 8 main staff and 5 support staff \nOpen competitive bidding\u2014goods \n(internationally advertised) \nOpen competitive bidding\u2014goods  \n(nationally advertised) \nRequest for quotations \nQuality- and cost-based selection \nLeast-cost selection \nConsultants qualification selection \nIndividual consultants (international \nand national) \nNon-consulting services, request \nfor quotations \nNo retroactive financing.a Advance contracting is planned for the recruitment of \n(i) PIU staff, (ii) design and quality monitoring firms,  (iii) a project implementation \nsupport firm, and (iv) financial management and environmental safeguards \nindividual consultants.b Advance contracting will be undertaken in conformity with \nthe ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe government and ADB. \n\nMultiple contracts \n1,644 (or TBD) person-months \n2 contracts \n157 person-months \n2,583 person-months \n \nMultiple contracts \n\n$525,000  \n$9,800,000 \n$285,000 \n$855,000 \n$1,810,000 \n \n$3,020,000 \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  MHSSE  =  Ministry  of  Higher  and  Secondary  Specialized  Education,  MOELR  = \nMinistry of Employment and Labor Relations, PIU = project implementation unit, TBD = to be determined. \na The  executing  agency  decided  not  to  pursue  retroactive  financing,  given  the  government\u2019s  regulation  that  no \nretroactive financing will be effected before the government\u2019s approval of a project, which follows the approval by the \nADB Board of Directors. \n\nb Terms of reference were developed for the PIUs, consulting firms, and individual consultants.

The \neconomic benefits from the project will mainly flow from (i) the increased number of PTC trainees \nand TVET graduates who will be able to secure jobs, and (ii) the increased productivity of the \ntargeted trades where wages will increase. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the economic \nviability of the project is robust to negative scenarios examined, such as increased investment \nand recurrent costs, and benefit reduction. \n  \n29. \nThe  project  is  financially  viable  (as  it  is  not  for  revenue-earning,  financial  cost\u2013benefit \nevaluation is not relevant). The borrowing is within the fiscal affordability in the sector, based on \nthe projected scale of public expenditures in the TVET and employment policy-related domains. \nThe additional recurrent and capital costs needed for operating the PTCs and TVEIs after project \ncompletion  will  be  low  (a  maximum  of  0.09%  of  government  expenditure  in  2028).  The \ngovernment budget will fund the O&M costs for the project assets after the project period. While \nthe contracts for the procurement of equipment under the project will ensure supplier-provided \npreventive and correct maintenance in the short term, the government\u2019s commitment to ensuring \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nSustainability \n\nadequate  budget  allocations  for  O&M  during  and  after  the  project  will  be  covenanted  in  the \nfinancing agreement and monitored during project implementation. \n \nB. \n \n30. \nThe project design complies with the national building codes and fits the need for energy-\nsaving  facilities  and  alternative  power  provision  by  using  renewable  energy.  The  project-\ndeveloped  e-learning  platform  (with  online  and  offline  materials)  will  support  multiple  learning \nmethods and meet the increasing demand for distance learning.  \n \nC. \n \nFinancial  management.  The  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  substantial \n31. \nmainly because of (i) country governance and public financial management systemic issues, such \nas the weak capacity of public institutions in financial management and in internal and external \naudits; (ii) insufficient financial management capacity of the executing and implementing agencies, \nand the absence of or limited experience in implementing ADB projects; (iii) a need to establish \nnew PIUs and set up a project financial management system, including an ICT accounting system \nin  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies;  and  (iv)  limited  knowledge  of  inventory  and \nequipment management and the potential risk of misuse. The key risk mitigation measures are in \nTable 4. An external audit firm will be hired following the statement of audit needs to ensure timely \nsubmission of audit reports. \n \n32. \nProcurement.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  concluded  that  the  overall  risk \nrating  is  substantial,  mainly  because  of  the  low  capacity  of  the  implementing  agencies.  All \nprocurement of goods and recruitment of services will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as \namended from time to time). Value for money will be achieved through the following procurement \narrangements: (i) goods and large non-consulting services will follow open competitive bidding \n(single-stage, one envelope); (ii) the procurement of consulting services will mainly follow quality- \nand cost-based selection; (iii) packages have been arranged by the scope and characteristics of \nthe goods and services, broken into lots, and will be advertised either internationally or nationally, \ndepending on the scope, value, location, and market capacity; and (iv) award will be based on \nthe lowest-evaluated cost per lot or for a combination of lots. A PISF and additional procurement \nstaff will support the PIUs. The key risk mitigation measures are in Table 4. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n33. \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n34. \nThe  project  is  categorized  gender  equity.  It  is  aimed  at  improving  gender  equality  in \naccessing skills development and participation in nontraditional jobs. The project will promote the \nenrollment of female students in diploma-level TVET, and the capacity building of female trainers \nin teaching and management positions. The gender action plan includes measures to attract more \nwomen to acquire industry-relevant skills in order to obtain jobs in male-dominated trades. The \nproject  will  upgrade  gender-segregated  water,  sanitation, and  hygiene  facilities  in  the  selected \nPTCs  and  TVEIs;  and  develop  gender-inclusive  curricula  and  training  modules.    It  will  also \naddress PWD\u2019s lack of access to reskilling services. The project will initiate PWD reskilling in one \nof the selected PTCs, ensure PWD-friendly accessibility in the infrastructure, and provide PWD \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n\f 11 \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nwith  nontraditional  training  such  as  ICT.  To  support  understanding  of  the  constraints  facing \nindustries in hiring PWD, parallel technical assistance is provided to identify a suitable approach \nto improve the employability of PWD.38  \n \nE. \n \n35. \ncategories are as follows.39 \n \n36. \nEnvironment (category B). The MOELR prepared an initial environmental examination \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  government  environmental  regulations.  The \nproject  will  have  site-specific  environmental  impacts related to  noise  generation,  air  and  water \nquality deterioration, solid waste generation, and community and occupational health and safety \nduring  construction.  These  can  be  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  the  environmental \nmanagement plan. The initial environmental examination study was disclosed on the ADB website \non 2 October 2020. The PIUs will submit the environmental monitoring reports regularly. \n \n37. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). A social due diligence report was developed for \nall  20  PTCs  and  TVEIs.  They  all  have  sufficient  land  area  for  the  planned  renovations  and/or \nreconstructions, and a well-defined boundary with a wall or fence or both. All renovation and/or \nreconstruction works will occur inside the premises; no one will be affected and no land acquisition \nis required. The proposed works for each project site will be reassessed following the detailed \ndesign  before  the  government\u2019s  contract  award  to  contractors,  to  reconfirm  the  absence  of \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts. \n \n38. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples communities are present in \nthe  project  sites,  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  for  operational  purposes. \nTherefore, indigenous peoples safeguards are not triggered for this project. \n \nF. \n \n39. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.40  \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInadequate staff and \ninsufficient capacity on \nprocurement and financial \nmanagement (including \ninternal audit) in executing and \nimplementing agencies \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe project will appoint PIU staff with financial and procurement experience under \nmultilateral  development  bank  projects  and  provide  capacity  development  on \nfinancial  management  and  procurement.  An  international  financial  management \nconsultant will be hired to (i) prepare a project financial management manual and \ninternal audit charter for the PIUs within 3 months from project effectiveness, and \n(ii)  monitor  the  setup  of the project  financial  management system. Two  national \nfinancial management consultants will be hired to review the quarterly unaudited \nproject  financial  statements  prepared  by  PIU  accountants  and  supporting \ndocuments. International and national procurement experts will be hired (under the \nPISF) to develop a procurement manual, provide capacity building, and support \nthe PIUs in the procurement process. \n\n \n\n38 The Proposal for Strengthening the Linkages between Labor Market and Skills Development for Youth and People \nwith Disabilities in Uzbekistan (2020) is supported by ADB. 2017.

The package \nshould include training for PIU staff and monthly services from the supplier. \n\nA  procurement  manual  will  be  prepared  for  the  project  for  training  purposes, \nspecifying the minimum qualifications for the procurement committee members. A \nprocurement committee will be set up under the project with qualified members, \nespecially for bid evaluators. Staff from the executing agency and implementing \nagencies  and  procurement  committee  members  will  be  trained  to  implement \nstandards  acceptable  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  The  PISF  will  provide \nprocurement specialists to support the PIUs. \nQuarterly projection of taxes and duties by the PIUs upon contract awards will be \nestablished to monitor timely tax and duties filing for reimbursement or exemption. \nThe information will be part of the quarterly unaudited project financial statements \nto be reviewed by the national financial management consultants hired under the \nproject. \n\nDelay in project\u2019s contract \nimplementation and financial \nreporting because of delay or \ninadequate monitoring of the \ntax reimbursement and duty \nexemption \nPISF = project implementation support firm, PIU = project implementation unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n40. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement as described \nin  detail  in  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.
