THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Arghandab  Integrated  Water  Resources \nDevelopment Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be \nprovided  by  the International  Fund for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD) for  the  Arghandab \nIntegrated Water Resources Development Project, and if the Board approves the proposed grant, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the IFAD \ngrant. \n \n2.  Water  availability  in  Afghanistan  is  highly  seasonal  and  erratic,  with  frequent  and \nworsening droughts affecting agriculture, living standards, and the local economy. Improved \nreliability of irrigated water supply is crucial to enable the expansion of high value cropping \nenterprises and associated activities. The project will improve the availability and management of \nwater resources in the Arghandab basin in Kandahar province by (i) increasing the storage \ncapacity of the Dahla Dam by raising its height, (ii) increasing the reliability of irrigation water \nsupplies downstream of the dam, (iii) improving agriculture water productivity by providing on-\nfarm support to farmers to improve crop production, and (iv) strengthening institutions in water \nresource management. Additional benefits associated with raising the dam include hydropower \ngeneration, to be undertaken by the private sector; and urban and industrial water supply to \nKandahar City and its surroundings, to be undertaken by World Bank. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Afghanistan is a conflict-affected state and one of the least-developed countries in the \nworld. In 2016, its poverty rate was 55%, while 44.6% of its inhabitants were considered food \ninsecure.1 In 2018, the average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated at $1,951 \nin current US dollars, ranking 202nd out of 217 economies in terms of GDP according to the World \nBank.2 Agriculture is Afghanistan\u2019s major source of livelihood, employing 62.2% of the national \nworkforce of 10.9 million people in 2017 and contributing 21.1% of national GDP, with sector value \naddition of $4.1 billion in 2016.3 However, crop yields are below the world average; the average \nwheat yield in 2017 was 2.0 tons per hectare (ha), compared with a world average of 3.5 tons per \nha.4 Within agriculture, horticulture accounts for 34% of sector GDP. The diverse geographical \nand climatic conditions of Kandahar Province enable a wide range of crops to be produced at \ndifferent times of the year, including apricots, pomegranates, grapes and cereal crops such as \nwheat. While horticulture provides a comparative advantage in terms of revenue for farmers, it \nrequires sufficient availability and reliability of irrigation water. \n \n4.  Water resources. Afghanistan is a dry country with low precipitation: the average annual \nprecipitation in Kandahar is 176 millimeters. Limited access to reliable irrigation water is a key \nconstraint  to  agricultural  productivity,  besides  low-quality  inputs  and  traditional  agricultural \npractices. High summer temperatures, low humidity, and lack of rainfall between April and \nNovember mean that without irrigation, few crops can produce profitable yields. The Dahla Dam, \n                                                \n1  Government of Afghanistan, Central Statistics Organization. 2017. Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey (2016\u2013\n2017). Kabul. \n2  World Bank. World Development Indicators (accessed 2 April 2019). \n3  The Global Economy.com. Afghanistan: GDP Share of Agriculture (accessed 2 April 2019). \n4  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Food and Agriculture Data (accessed 5 June 2019). \n \n ", "2 \nconstructed in 1952, is the second largest dam in Afghanistan with a height of 55 meters and a \ncrest  length  of  535  meters.5  It  is  in  the Shah  Wali  Kot  District of Kandahar \nProvince in Afghanistan, about 40 kilometers north east of the provincial capital Kandahar. Its \ndesign capacity of 478 million cubic meters (MCM) of water provides irrigation water to the \ndownstream Arghandab Irrigation System (AIS), which delivers water to 55 community irrigation \nschemes, and 65 riparian community irrigation schemes, covering five districts of Kandahar \nProvince including Kandahar City. Dahla Dam does not supply water to downstream urban \ncommunities, and its hydropower potential has not been developed. \n \n5.  The Dahla Dam reservoir stores and controls irregular and short duration snowmelt flow \nfrom the Hindu Kush mountains. However, the reservoir has lost 40% of its storage capacity \nbecause of siltation, and its ability to provide regulated downstream flow has been seriously \nconstrained. This has resulted in (i) reduction in cropped area, with only 47% of the command \narea being regularly irrigated; (ii) expansion constraints for high value cropping; (iii) increased \nreliance on groundwater for more reliable irrigation water supplies impacting the water table and \nthe cost of pumping which is borne by farmers; and (iv) cropping patterns which are biased to \nwinter and forage crops of lower value cereal to reduce risk from water shortage. Lack of water \nstorage regulation also increases the risk of flood events. \n \n6.  The AIS has also suffered deterioration, reducing water conveyance efficiency and losing \nwater distribution control. Among farmers, there is limited awareness and low adoption of water-\nefficient on-farm technologies such as laser levelling and drip irrigation, contributing to low yields \nand unproductive use of limited water resources. Current yields of irrigated crops in the project \narea average 30% of good agricultural practice. \n \n7.  Climate change impacts. Current climate change models indicate significant warming \nacross Afghan provinces, and decreased precipitation, particularly spring rainfall.6 Increased \ndrought frequency, extreme weather events, and a raise in the ambient Afghanistan climatic \ntemperature by 4\u00b0C - 6\u00b0C are predicted by 2070, further highlighting the need for improved water \nresources  management,  including  improving  storage  capacities.7  Among  Afghanistan\u2019s  key \nclimate change adaptation priorities are: (a) rehabilitating small- to large-scale water resources \ninfrastructure, (b) increasing irrigated agricultural land area, (c) strengthening hydrological and \nmeteorological  monitoring  networks,  and  (d)  improving  watershed  management.8  Ahead  of \nproject formulation, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) undertook a climate change assessment \nfor agriculture and water resources, and consulted with key government stakeholders including \nthe Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock \n(MAIL) on adaptation investment needs. ADB identified multi-purpose dams with climate-resilient \nirrigation, hydropower, and water resources management as priority project investments to \nmitigate risks associated with a changing climate (e.g. drought and floods).9 \n \n8.  The Arghandab Sub-Basin Agency (ASBA) under MEW handles the management of river \nflows  and  operation  of  the  Dahla  Dam,  and  management  of  the  AIS  main  canal  system. \nCommunity irrigation schemes are managed by mirabs (community-assigned water bailiffs) for \n                                                \n5  Six saddle dams have been built in the periphery of the dam, which together measure 2,040 meters. \n6  M.

Manila (TA 8119-REG). \n ", "3 \nthe various subdivisions and individual farms within the community irrigation schemes. The \ngovernment recognizes the need for effective operating capacity for the Dahla Dam and the AIS. \nTo improve AIS management, it intends to establish two special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for \nwater delivery services and revenue collection, one for Dahla Dam operations and the other for \nAIS operations, to be developed by the project for implementation by MEW. This requires \nrestructuring  support  and  capacity  building,  including  provision  of  suitable  equipment  for \ninfrastructure maintenance. MEW also has limited capacity to forecast water availability and \ncoordinate  delivery  to  meet  irrigation  demand.  Strengthening  capacity  and  regulatory \ndevelopment will enable improved management of the AIS and increased reliability of irrigation \nwater to farmers\u2019 fields.  \n \n9.  By increasing the storage capacity of the Dahla Dam and improving its operations, \ncombined with modernization and improved management of the AIS and farmers\u2019 stronger \ncapacity and skills for more productive agriculture, the area under irrigation is expected to expand \nfrom an average of 54,000 ha to 65,000\u201381,300 ha, with a maximum of 115,00 ha, by 2026, \ndepending on the dam storage and associated flow releases.10 Increased storage capacity will \nalso provide water for municipal supply to Kandahar City, hydropower and environmental flows \nfor the Arghandab River.  \n \n10.  About two-thirds of employed women in Afghanistan are engaged in agriculture, mainly in \nhorticulture, livestock raising, and agro-processing activities. Cultural restrictions limit women\u2019s \nmobility, and sex segregation curbs access to inputs and agriculture extension services. Very few \nwomen own land or have water rights, which further impedes their ability to contribute to improved \nland and water management. The project will build the capacity of female agriculture extension \nworkers to access female farmers, provide scholarships to female government officers for master \nof science degrees in integrated water resources management, and provide female farmers with \ngrants for improving agricultural productivity and economic opportunities. \n  \n11.  Enabling policy environment. The High Council for Land and Water is responsible for \ncoordinating water-related tasks of national institutions, recommending development plans and \nstrategies for cabinet approval; recommending drafted legislation and regulations for approval; \nmonitoring  the  implementation  of  plans  by  line  ministries;  resolving  water-related  disputes \nbetween ministries; and ensuring compliance with the Water Law, 2009 by relevant ministries and \nagencies. The Water Law states that \u201cwater is free,\u201d which has constrained progression to \nimplement water delivery service charges and, therefore, a sustainable budget for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M). Not contradicting this principle, amendments to the Water Law explicitly \nallowing for the charging of water delivery services has been agreed by the Office of the President, \nand legislative changes are in motion. \n \n12.  Government strategies. Government policy for productive water resources is outlined in \nthe Strategic Policy Framework for the Water Sector, which provides directions for the water \nsector in Afghanistan.11 The Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework, 2017\u2013\n2021 supports increased jobs and GDP growth through improved management and use of water \nresources.12 Other key policies are the National Comprehensive Agricultural Development Priority \n                                                \n10 The agricultural (and urban) demand is highest in the months of June to August, and irrigation flow varies according \nto availability and crop water demands. \n11 Government of Afghanistan. 2004.

Kabul. \n \n ", "4 \nProgram13 and the draft National Irrigation Policy.14 These highlight critical issues for the sector, \nincluding (i) land and water productivity in irrigated agriculture not reaching its potential; (ii) weak \nirrigation management institutions (government and community-based); (iii) constrained public \nand private stakeholder capacity; and (iv) legal framework governing irrigation requiring updates \nto further clarify mandates, functions, and responsibilities. \n \n13.  The $1.1 billion National Water and Natural Resources Development Program (2010\u2013\n2013, but continuing) targets to improve access to irrigation, and to establish and strengthen water \nbasin agencies. The National Irrigation Program (2016\u20132025), with an investment requirement \nestimated at $1.5 billion, aims to improve and rehabilitate irrigation services, enhance agricultural \nextension services, and improve on-farm water management and O&M. \n \n14.  Since 1966, ADB has invested about $545 million in water resources, mainly for irrigation. \nADB operations have resulted in 140,000 ha of improved irrigated land, with more than 225,000 \nha under development. Key areas of assistance in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n2019\u20132021 for Afghanistan are irrigation and water resources, agriculture market infrastructure, \nvalue chain development, integrated water resources management, institutional strengthening \nand reforms, and increased participation of women in agriculture.15 \n \n15.  ADB has financed the Western Basins Water Resources Management Project,16 the \nAgriculture  Market  Infrastructure  Project,17  the  Water  Resources  Development  Investment \nProgram,18 the Community-Based Irrigation Rehabilitation and Development,19 the Northern \nFlood-Damaged Infrastructure Emergency Rehabilitation Project,20 the Panj-Amu River Basin \nSector  Project,21  the  Horticulture  Value  Chain  Development  Sector  Project,22  and  regional \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  in \nMountainous River Basins.23 Lessons from these interventions highlight the need to integrate \napproaches to water resources allocation between competing users, increase water productivity, \nadapt to climate change and disaster risk impacts, strengthen and develop agricultural value \nchains for inclusive and equitable development impact, use national contractors to the extent \npossible, and conduct diligent ADB supervision of safeguards compliance. \n \n                                                \n13 Government of Afghanistan, MAIL. 2009.

Development partners have contributed to water resources and agriculture development \nand management, with irrigation and horticulture the main beneficiaries. The Arghandab Irrigation \nRehabilitation  Project  (2008\u20132012,  financed  by  the  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency)24 improved irrigation in about 30,000 ha, and cleared mines around the Dahla Dam.25 \nOngoing relevant projects include the Support to National Priority Programme 2,26 and Community \nLivestock and Agriculture Project,27 both financed by IFAD, and the National Horticulture and \nLivestock Productivity Project financed by the World Bank.28 \n \n17.  The project is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132021,29 as it will \ndevelop agriculture and water resources in support of the government\u2019s strategic priorities, and is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 (footnote 15). The project is \naligned with the objectives of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 through the operational priority on promoting \nrural  development  and  food  security,  and  the  guiding  principles  of  promoting  innovative \ntechnology and delivering integrated solutions.30 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for \nAgriculture and Natural Resources, 2015\u2013202031 and Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020.32 \n \n18.  Fragile and Conflict Affected Situations. Project preparation adopted an approach that \nis sensitive to fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS). During design planning, it was \nessential to (i) conduct meaningful local consultations to the extent permitted by prevailing \nsecurity restrictions, to ensure that local voices were heard and considered; and (ii) take an \nintegrated approach to water resources development so that conflicts over water would be \nminimized  and  all  segments  of  the  community  would,  to  the  extent  possible,  benefit. \nImplementation arrangements needed to (i) place high priority on achieving fair and equitable \nresettlement  of  affected  persons;  (ii)  design  civil  works  contract  packages  to  maximize \nopportunities for national, and preferably local contractors, in line with the Enhanced Project \nDelivery Approach Paper;33 (iii) ensure extensive empowerment of farmer beneficiaries through \ncommunity contracting and grant matching programs; and (iv) place significant efforts on effective \ncommunication by each implementing agency.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n19.  The project is aligned with the following impact: jobs and GDP growth increased (footnote \n12). The project will have the following outcome: management and use of water resources in the \nArghandab River basin improved.34 The project has four outputs.  \n \n20.  Output 1: Dahla Dam capacity increased. This will be delivered through (i) civil works \n                                                \n24 In 2013, the Canadian International Development Agency merged with the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, \nTrade and Development. \n25 Government of Canada.

A \nrecreational facility for families will be developed by ASBA to provide an area for community \nparticipation  and  women\u2019s  inclusion.  Increased  dam  capacity  will  reduce  flood  risks  to \ndownstream areas. Dam operation rules reflecting multiple water use requirements and O&M \nmanuals will be developed under the project. The project will also provide training to dam \noperators to improve their capacity in timely and appropriate dam operation. \n \n21.  Output 2: Reliability of irrigation water supply increased. Reliable supply of irrigation \nwater will be increased through irrigation infrastructure modernization, including by upgrading \ncanals and structures, and introducing monitoring and control systems on the AIS and community-\nmanaged systems. Improved water ordering will allow water on demand to be introduced on the \nAIS. There are two key activities: (i) modernization of the AIS infrastructure and procurement of \nmaintenance equipment for the ASBA so that the irrigation operating entity can ensure timely \ndelivery of irrigation services to community systems; and (ii) support for village communities, \nincluding women, for improvement of community irrigation infrastructures through community \ncontracting. \n \n22.  Output 3: Agricultural water productivity improved. The project will strengthen the \ncapacity of farmers to improve farm management and will adopt climate-smart irrigation and \nagricultural technologies and practices to improve production and sustainability. This will be \ndelivered by demonstrating innovative agricultural practices and investment options, including \nsupport for agricultural extension services; conducting on-farm demonstrations; providing training \nand  advisory  services  to  farmers;  and  conducting  a  grant-matching  scheme  to  facilitate \ninvestment in technologies to improve water productivity.35 Female farmers will have equitable \naccess to agricultural extension services, training opportunities, technology transfer, and advisory \nservices. Women will be trained as local resource persons, and separate training courses for \nfemale farmers will be arranged.  \n \n23.  Output 4: Capacity in water resource management and use strengthened. The \nproject will (i) support the development of policy, legislation, and regulatory options for a system \nof water entitlements and allocation to allow improved management of water resources and \nmultipurpose dams, as well as the development of regulations and a business structure to charge \nfees for water delivery services to strengthen financial sustainability and improve water resources \nmanagement,  resulting  in  improved  irrigation  productivity;  (ii)  provide  water  resources \nmanagement  training  to  government  staff,  including  women;  and  (iii)  establish  a  national \nhydrological modeling platform for integrated water resources policy, planning, operation, and \nmanagement to strengthen water resources management. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n24.  The project design has taken an integrated approach to water resources development. \nDuring project preparation, ADB conducted comprehensive technical analysis and due diligence \n                                                \n35 The grant-matching scheme is a simplified version of the grant-matching scheme used in the ADB-funded \nHorticulture Value Chain Development Sector Project currently under implementation (footnote 22). \n ", "7 \non (i) the Dahla Dam raise; (ii) irrigation and agriculture development; (iii) urban water supply to \nKandahar City and surrounding areas; and (iv) hydropower development, where hydropower is \nproduced as a by-product of water releases. In addition to reliable irrigation water supply and \nimproved agricultural productivities that will be achieved through the project, increasing the \nstorage capacity of the Dahla Dam will allow the development of an urban water supply based on \nthe reservoir, and raising the height of the dam wall will make hydroelectricity production viable \nto meet suppressed power demand in Kandahar. Given Asian Development Fund (ADF) grant \nresource limitations, in consultation with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), ADB shared relevant \ndocuments with the World Bank, which is now preparing a project to construct water supply \ninfrastructure to urban and peri-urban Kandahar to improve water services, which is possible \nfollowing the increase in reservoir storage being undertaken by the project.36 In addition, relevant \ndocuments have been shared by the project team with ADB\u2019s Office of Public-Private Partnership \nfor the hydropower development for structuring as a public-private partnership transaction. \n  \n25.  The integrated solution is important to: (i) ensure that the project delivers widespread \nbenefits to the different communities so that, in a dry environment with a fractured society, no \ncommunity  will  feel  disadvantaged  or  left  out;  (ii)  deliver  important  development  needs  to \nKandahar; and (iii) deliver an optimized and rationale economic outcome from the investment in \nincreased water storage capacity. The project design advances the integration of improved water \nresources  management,  irrigation  system  management  and  water  productivity  at  farm  for \nimproved irrigation farm profitability. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n26.  The project is estimated to cost $403.04 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).37 \nThe major expenditure items are civil works, consulting services, and capacity development costs. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Climate change adaptation is estimated to cost $149.87 million, of which ADB will finance \n88%.40 The project adaptation components comprise (i) increasing the dam\u2019s storage capacity, \n(ii)  improving  irrigation  and  drainage  services,  and  (iii)  building  capacity  for  climate-smart \nagriculture and water resources management. The ADF disaster risk reduction fund will support \nthe government in strengthening its capacity to manage climate change-related risks, particularly \nthose related to the management and use of its water resources. The support will complement \nthe project\u2019s overall efforts to improve water availability and allocation and reduce water-related \nrisks (e.g., droughts and floods). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 37). \n \n31.  The MOF will be the executing agency.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n32.  Extensive due diligence was undertaken of the Dahla Dam structures (including the six \nsaddle  dams),  reservoir  catchment  hydrology  and  reservoir  bathymetry,  road  realignment \n(impacted  by  the  dam  raise),  and  the  AIS  and  community  irrigation  infrastructure.  The \nconsiderable prior design work undertaken by the United States Army Corps of Engineers on the \nDahla Dam was carefully reviewed. In addition, a farmer survey to understand community needs \n ", "10 \nfor improved irrigation management and water productivity was undertaken.  \n \n33.  Various scenarios were modelled for different dam spillway height raise (from 9.1 to 13.6 \nmeters) to assess feasibility and cost-benefits, including future climate change impacts. A 13.6-\nmeter spillway height increase is the basis for the project design and cost estimates. This design \naddresses climate change impacts including: (i) coping with high, short-duration inflows that are \nforecast to be more frequent, without unplanned spills that may cause downstream floods; (ii) \nproviding increased water storage and strengthening water resource management capacity to \nreduce drought impacts; (iii) improving dam safety; and (iv) increasing dam life with sufficient \nreservoir capacity for siltation effects. \n \n34.  Irrigation infrastructure and on-farm irrigation technologies have been designed to reduce \nconveyance and on-farm application losses. On-farm technologies including drip irrigation which \nhas been pilot-tested under other investments in Afghanistan will be demonstrated and introduced \nto farmers on a cost-sharing (grant-matching) basis.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n35.  The economic analysis on the overall investment\u2014(i) height raise for the Dahla Dam and \nsix saddle dams (output 1), (ii) irrigation and agriculture development (outputs 2\u20134), (iii) improved \nwater  supply  for  Kandahar  City  (footnote  36),  and  (iv)  Dahla  Dam  hydroelectric  power \ndevelopment,41\u2014followed ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.42 Hence, the \neconomic analysis included the project investments  (i and ii), and the parallel investments (iii and \niv). Results show that with a hurdle rate of 9%, the project is economically viable with a 15.7% \neconomic internal rate of return in constant 2019 prices. Without raising Dahla Dam to store more \nwater and investing in modern and climate-smart irrigated agriculture and improved systems for \nintegrated water management, the lack of available water and low productivity from water will \nremain.  \n \n36.  The project will enlarge the effective dam storage capacity to 782 MCM, or from 60% to \n165% of the 1952 capacity, and 271% of the current effective storage capacity. It will improve \nirrigation system reliability and efficiency and on-farm water productivity, resulting in an expanded \nirrigated area, increased cropping intensity and yields, a shift to higher-value crops, higher \nproductivity of scarce water and higher returns to farmers. Incremental crop production will \ndisplace imports and increase exports. The economic analysis identified improvement in the gross \nmargins of six crop categories on two farm technological levels. The outputs from the significantly \nimproved service level of the urban-rural water supply and hydropower resulted in an incremental \neconomic benefit valued using the consumer surplus method.43 \n \n37.  The project outputs were categorized as non-revenue generating and revenue generating. \nThe  dam  and  the  AIS  irrigation  canal  are  presently  non-revenue  generating  outputs.  The \nincremental annual O&M costs of $1.08 million for the dam, and $0.55 million for the AIS will be \nfunded through two SPVs for water delivery services and revenue collection, to be developed by \nthe project for implementation by MEW. The incremental O&M costs for the 120 community \nirrigation systems is minimal and largely funded by farmers while annual O&M costs for on-farm \n                                                \n41 To be financed separately under a public\u2013private partnership. \n42 ADB. 2017.

Ottawa. \n ", "11 \ntechnology investments would be funded by adopting farmers. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n38.  To improve water resources management at basins, the project will help the government \nmove to a system of water entitlements and allocation and the use of rule curves for the timing \nand operation of water releases from the Dahla Dam. For the first time in Afghanistan, dedicated \nenvironmental allocations and releases will be planned to help deliver environmental outcomes. \nSustainable operations of the Dahla Dam and the AIS have been planned through two SPVs for \nwater delivery services and revenue collection, one for Dahla Dam operations and the other for \nthe AIS operations, to be developed by the project for implementation by MEW. Improved levels \nof qualified human resources have been built into the project, particularly through the funding of \n120 part time student positions at the Kabul Polytechnic University for water resource managers \nto complete a master of science in integrated water resource management. With a project design \nfocus on investments to improve irrigated farm profitability, irrigation farmers will have the financial \nresources  to  sustainably  maintain  community  irrigation  systems  and  on-farm  technology \ninvestments. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n39.  Implementation  of  civil  works  and  other  activities  will  follow  relevant  government \nrequirements and ADB procedures for financial management and safeguards.44 Three consultant \npackages  are  ready  for  advanced  recruitment  actions.  An  engineering,  procurement  and \nconstruction supervision consultant will take the current designs from the 70% completion stage \nto design ready and prepare the tender documents. \n \n40.  The overall financial management risk is substantial. The project management offices \nhave  fully  functional  finance  sections  with  adequate  financial  management  capacity  and \nexperience with ADB-funded projects. Their overall capacity continues to improve and the risk at \nproject level is considered moderate. However, the assessments have identified risks related to \nthe country\u2019s public financial management system in financial reporting and weak line ministries\u2019 \ninternal  audit  which  focus  more  on  financial  compliance  rather  than  the  adequacy  and \neffectiveness of control environment. An action plan for further improvement is in the PAM \n(footnote 37). \n \n41.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 37). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n42.  The project will provide a long-term sustainable solution to the acute shortage of water in \nthe Arghandab sub-basin by increasing Dahla Dam\u2019s storage capacity, allowing for significantly \nimproved irrigated agriculture. Separately, an urban water supply will be funded by the World \nBank and hydropower will be installed and operated by the private sector. Each development will \ncontribute  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  project  will  also  increase  the \npopulation\u2019s  resilience  to  droughts  and  floods.  Irrigation  modernization  and  climate-smart \nagriculture will stimulate growth of farmers\u2019 incomes and increase value addition and marketing \n                                                \n44 Throughout project design preparation, government representatives have been closely consulted and contributed \nvaluable governance measures that have been incorporated in the project design. \n ", "12 \nactivity. In most cases, full irrigation would not be feasible for several years in the absence of the \nproject, causing widespread hardship and hunger and severely limiting agricultural production. In \nthese circumstances, and where substantial areas of land can be brought back into production in \n1\u20132 years, financial returns are likely to be high. \n \n43.  The key social issue to be addressed is the inefficient management and use of water \nresources; the impacts are vulnerability to climate change trends of reduced precipitation and \nhigher temperatures, low agricultural productivity and low farm incomes, inability to generate jobs \nin agricultural value chains, and food insecurity in rural and urban populations. \n \n44.  The project will primarily benefit the population of 830,165 (2018) in Kandahar City and \n1.25 million population in seven rural districts in Kandahar Province (as of 2018). Kandahar \nProvince is among the top three provinces with a significant internal migration (6% per year) from \nthree immediately surrounding districts whose residents move in search of security, jobs, and \nservices. The three priority areas of preference of the surveyed population are security, provision \nof irrigation water, and marketing of agricultural products.  \n \n45.  A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared by ADB to include women in project \nactivities  and  as  beneficiaries  of  project  outcomes.45  The  key  actions  of  the  GAP  include \nconducting socially inclusive dissemination and consultation workshops with men and women on \nproject scope and benefits; providing recreational areas at the Dahla Dam with gender design \nfeatures, such as separate rest areas, eateries, and seating arrangements; training at least 21 \nfemale farmers as local resource persons; providing 300 farmers (30% women) with improved \nskills and climate-smart technologies in irrigated agricultural production by 2025; supporting 100 \ngovernment  staff,  of  whom  30%  are  women,  in  completing  master  of  science  degrees  in \nintegrated water resources management by 2025; and hiring gender specialists to support GAP \nmonitoring and implementation. \n \n46.  An FCAS assessment was undertaken using the new FCAS risk management toolkit \ndeveloped by ADB\u2019s Afghanistan Resident Mission.46 An FCAS action plan, to be actioned during \nproject implementation, is described in the PAM (footnote 37). \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n47.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.47 \n \n48.  Environment (category A). Output 1 is classified category A for the environment because \nof anticipated irreversible, diverse, or unprecedented impacts from raising the full reservoir level \nby 13.6 meters. Buildings in several villages and several hectares of irrigable land surrounding \nthe reservoir will be affected. Moreover, aquatic environments and habitats may also be affected \nin case environmental flow conditions are not accounted for at the downstream end. A draft \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) study was prepared by MEW and disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 2 April 2019. The EIA presented a preliminary review of baseline environmental \nconditions, impacts, and risks. The project area has pockets of natural habitat. Some protected \nspecies of interest were observed during the environmental surveys undertaken in November \n2018, but biodiversity screening and a critical habitat assessment are needed to gain sufficient \n                                                \n45 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n46 Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n47 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "13 \ninformation on how these species will be impacted by the project. Introducing water protection \nzones, including protective measures around the reservoir, is suggested to maintain water quality \nin the reservoir over the long run. Moreover, the environmental management plan includes \nmonitoring activities to be conducted during construction and operational stage (monitoring of \nnoise, dust, water quality, and ambient air quality). The EIA will be updated upon the completion \nof the detailed design and other studies on biodiversity, riverine ecology, and environmental flow \nmanagement to further reinforce the assessment findings and recommended environmental \nmanagement actions.  \n \n49.  Outputs  2\u20133  are  classified  category  B  for  environment.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination study prepared for outputs 2 and 3 assessed and described the environmental \nimpacts. Potential site-specific impacts that may arise during construction include generation of \ndust from soil excavation and refilling; disturbance to residents and traffic by construction works; \nwater availability; and occupational, community, health, and safety hazards. Some impacts may \nalso arise during operations, including waste dumped in canals resulting in clogging, and water \nunavailability for downstream farmers. Appropriate avoidance, mitigation,  and enhancement \nmeasures, and implementation of the environmental management plan, will help minimize the \nsignificance of the impacts. \n  \n50.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). Land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) will be \nsignificant  and  extensive.  Security  constraints  prevented  resettlement  surveys  from  being \ncompleted in the reservoir area, within the resource and time allocation under the transaction TA. \nHigh resolution satellite imagery taken in 2018 indicates that the reservoir (output 1) will inundate \nor partially inundate about 22 communities, physically displacing about 5,800 people from 596 \nhouseholds and permanently affecting their livelihoods. Displacement from this output will only \noccur following dam completion and subsequent inundation of the reservoir area. Multiple LARPs \nwill be developed by MEW to provide compensation measures for lost assets and, equally \nimportant, to implement livelihood restoration and development plans over the life of the project \nfor  multiple  communities.  Comprehensive  LARPs  for  reservoir  resettled  communities,  with \ncomplex site selection and livelihood restoration processes, require 1\u20132 years of planning. A \nLARF48 has been prepared by MEW to guide the LARP preparation process during the project \nimplementation, according to the principles of SPS 2009. Irrigation and agriculture development \n(outputs 2 and 3) is expected to cause LAR impacts on 3,936 people from 492 households. A \nLARF has been prepared by MEW to guide the LARP preparation process during project \nimplementation, following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. About $27.797 million will be \nrequired for involuntary resettlement impact mitigation. Government-owned replacement land will \nbe provided by the government, and non-land related expenditures for LARP implementation will \nbe funded under the project in compliance with applicable requirements under the Operations \nManual section on Safeguard Policy Statement and the ADB-approved resettlement planning \ndocuments.49 The PAM (footnote 37) contains details to remind the government of the strict \ncompliance requirements between safeguards and contract award. \n \n51.  External monitors will be engaged by the implementing agencies to report on LARP \nimplementation, including livelihood restoration programs and grievances. Capacity building of \nimplementing agencies in LAR will be provided through separate proposed TA.  \n \n52.  Indigenous peoples (category C).

Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.50 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nDam safety is  A panel of experts (including international and national experts of various technical \ncompromised by  fields) will be recruited by MEW to review the detailed engineering and design and to \nincorrect design or  monitor construction. \nconstruction \nLack of security for  Multiple  security  risk  mitigation  measures  have  been  considered  during  project \ncontractors and field staff  preparation and are built into the project design. The integrated approach to water \nprohibits freedom of  resources development design is critical, as it allows most communities in the project \nmovement  area to be project beneficiaries. The FCAS risk management tool kit was deployed \nduring project design. As part of inclusive and strategic communication with local \ncommunities to increase local residents\u2019 ownership of the project, local residents and \nauthorities were well-informed of the project\u2019s objectives and design during project \nprocessing. Consultation will be continued during project implementation. Resettlement \nplanning has been carefully worked through with the relevant agencies. Contractors will \nbe responsible for their own security arrangements, a measure that has proved \nsuccessful in other projects. The project and contractors will employ and upskill locals, \nand community contracting works will be applied to minor civil works. A  7-year \nimplementation period was planned to accommodate potential delays. Finally, project \nrisk managers and security teams will work closely with local police and security senior \npersonnel and community leaders. \nInadequate budget for  The government has committed to continuing the annual ASBA budget for staff and \nO&M results in Dahla  O&M for the Dahla Dam and the AIS canal network services.
