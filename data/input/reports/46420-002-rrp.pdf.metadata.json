The Philippines is a lower middle-income country with a \nhuman development index of 0.654, placing it 114th out of 187 countries.3 From 2003 to 2012, \nthe  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  5.2%,  but \npoverty  incidence  increased  from  24.9%  to  27.9%. 4  Incomes  and  poverty  incidence  differ \nsignificantly  across  provinces.  Many  geographically  isolated,  hazard-prone,  or  conflict-affected \nareas and indigenous peoples\u2019 ancestral domains have very limited health services, low female \nparticipation  in the  workforce  and local  politics,  and  wide  gender  wage gaps.  Progress  lags  in \nmeeting Millennium Development Goals on poverty, universal primary education, and maternal \nhealth. Limited access to basic services is a key cause of poverty and inequality in the country.5 \nGovernment  estimates  indicate  that  about  45%  of  the  population  is  vulnerable  to  falling  into \npoverty  if  confronted  by  external  shocks  such  as  health  problems,  family  deaths,  loss  of \nemployment, and disasters.6 \n\n3. \nVulnerability  to  natural  hazards.  The  Philippines  is  one  of  the  world\u2019s  most  natural-\nhazard-prone  countries.  It  ranks  third  on  the  global  disaster  risk  index,  behind  Vanuatu  and \nTonga. 7 Nearly  60%  of  the  total  land  area  is  exposed  to  multiple  hazards  such  as  floods, \nearthquakes,  landslides,  and  volcanic  eruptions;  about  74%  of  the  population  is  vulnerable  to \ndisasters.  About  1,000  lives,  on  average,  are  lost  annually  because  of  disasters.  The  country \nexperiences about 20 typhoons every year. Tropical cyclones and associated flooding account \nfor  about  75%  of  recorded  deaths  and  63%  of  damage.  The  annual  cost  of  disasters  to  the \neconomy  is  estimated  at  0.7%\u20131%  of  GDP. 8  The  frequency  and  ferocity  of  the  disasters \noverstretch the capacity and resources of national and local governments to respond effectively.  \n\nTyphoon Yolanda. On 8 November 2013, Typhoon Yolanda hit the central Philippines, \n4. \nleaving behind an unprecedented path of destruction. An initial disaster needs assessment has \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The National Economic and Development Authority Board approved the KC-NCDDP on 18 January 2013. The design \nof  KC-NCDDP  has  been  adjusted  to  support  the  post-disaster  efforts  of  the  government.  More  broadly,  the  KC-\nNCDDP aims to bring about more equitable access to basic services and reduce poverty. \n3  United Nations Development Programme. 2013. Human Development Report.

Preliminary  government  estimates  indicate  that \nTyphoon Yolanda and other recent disasters may have cut the national economic growth rate by \n0.3\u20130.8  percentage  points  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2013  alone,  which  is  equivalent  to  $900 \nmillion\u2013$2.5 billion of lost GDP in 2013. ADB\u2019s preliminary forecast for 2014 is that the drop in \nthe GDP growth rate could be as high as 1 percentage point. The combined regional economies \nof  Central  Visayas,  Eastern  Visayas,  and  Western  Visayas\u2014which  account  for  12.5%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  GDP\u2014could  shrink  by  4.0%\u20138.0%  in  2014.  The  Eastern  Visayas\u2019  economy  could \ncontract by 30.0% or more in 2014. \n\n5. \nImproving  service  delivery  and  responding  to  post-disaster  needs.  Community-\ndriven  development  (CDD)  approaches  have  been  used  to  address  bottlenecks  in  the  local \ndelivery of basic services.11 The CDD principles of participatory planning and community control \nof  investment  resources  are  being  applied  in  the  Philippines  by  the  government\u2019s  Kapit-Bisig \nLaban sa Kahirapan (Linking Arms Against Poverty)\u2013Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of \nSocial  Services  (KALAHI\u2013CIDSS)  project,  managed  by  the  Department  of  Social Welfare  and \nDevelopment  (DSWD). 12  KALAHI\u2013CIDSS 13  has  improved  basic  service  delivery,  effectively \ntargeted  poor  communities,  and  responded  to  the  needs  of  poor  households,  lessening  the \ninfluence of patronage in resource allocation and job creation.14 The government identifies CDD \nas  a  pillar  of  the  country\u2019s  development  and  poverty  reduction  strategy,  and  is  expanding \nKALAHI\u2013CIDSS operations into the KC-NCDDP.  \n\n6. \nIn the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda, the KC-NCDDP will use CDD to support recovery \nand  rehabilitation  efforts  in  affected  communities.  International  experience  demonstrates  the \neffectiveness  of  CDD  in  responding  to  disaster  situations  and  reducing  disaster  risks.  CDD  is \nuseful  in  emergency  and  post-calamity  situations  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  a  community  is \nthe  first  to  experience  a  disaster  and  the  first  to  respond,  (ii)  communities  have  indigenous \nknowledge of hazards and mitigation, (iii) involving affected communities in determining needs \nand  priorities  helps  ensure  the  appropriateness  and  sustainability  of  disaster  responses,  and   \n(iv) organized communities are better able to demand downward accountability.15  \n\n7. \nThe  presence  of  CDD  projects,  especially  in  poor,  remote,  and  disaster-prone  areas, \nalso  makes  them  well  positioned  to  urgently  respond  to  post-disaster  needs  and  facilitate  the \ncoordination  and  cohesiveness  of  assistance.

In  2004,  the  Spanish  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  provided  financing  to  it  under  the  Empowerment  and  Development  of \nCommunities Project. In 2010, the World Bank provided additional financing to KALAHI\u2013CIDSS until May 2014; the \nMillennium  Challenge  Corporation  provided  parallel  financing.  By  December  2012,  KALAHI\u2013CIDSS  had  covered \n8,435  barangays  in  364  poor  municipalities  and  supported  8,776  subprojects,  reaching  1.95  million  households. \nSome subprojects have helped address community needs in response to disasters. \n\n13  Overview  of  Community-Driven  Development  and  the  Kapit-Bisig  Laban  sa  Kahirapan\u2013Comprehensive  and \n\nIntegrated Delivery of Social Services Project (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n14  The benefits derived from KALAHI\u2013CIDSS are summarized in Overview of Community-Driven Development and the \n\nKALAHI\u2013CIDSS Project (supplementary appendix accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n15  World Bank. 2009.

Washington DC.  \n\n\fmanagement  systems,  including  flexible  procurement  and  disbursement  procedures,  can  be \ntapped  to  quickly  mobilize  resources  after  a  disaster.  Indonesia  expanded  CDD  programs  to \nrespond  to  urgent  recovery  needs  after  five  major  disasters  from  2004  to  2010.16 The  post-\ndisaster  experience  of  Aceh  and  Nias  highlighted  the  following  outcomes  of  CDD  programs:       \n(i) fully disbursed funds ahead of schedule, (ii) more outputs delivered than other programs, and \n(iii) greater transparency and accountability than most other government projects.17    \n\n8. \nWith the presence of KALAHI\u2013CIDSS in about 90% of the Yolanda-affected areas, and \nbuilding on the long-running KALAHI\u2013CIDSS management systems, the KC-NCDDP will be well \npositioned  to  address  the  post-disaster  needs  of  communities.  The  KC-NCDDP  will  provide \nsupport  for  recovery  and  rehabilitation  activities  in  more  than  14,000  barangays  (villages)  in \nmore than 500 municipalities across 39 provinces affected by the typhoon, covering about 3.3 \nmillion  households.  It  will  provide  (i)  grants  for  planning  and  implementing  CDD  subprojects,      \n(ii) capacity building and implementation support, and (iii) program management monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E).  \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  by \n9. \nassisting  the  government  with  restoring  and  rebuilding  economic,  social,  and  governance \nactivities  in  typhoon-affected  communities.18 It  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  sector  and  thematic \nassessments, which stress strengthening capacity for disaster risk management, and promoting \ngender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. ADB has closely coordinated with the government \nand other development partners in the design of the KC-NCDDP, as well as in rehabilitation and \nrecovery  efforts. 19  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  Yolanda  Recovery  and \nRehabilitation Plan. \n\n10. \nADB\u2019s response includes the immediate deployment of the Typhoon Yolanda Response \nTeam  and  the  following  development  assistance:  (i)  a  $3  million  grant  from  the  Asia  Pacific \nDisaster Response Fund to help meet immediate expenses to restore life-saving services, (ii) a \n$500  million  EAL to support the  post-disaster  efforts  of the government, and  (iii)  a  $20 million \ngrant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to provide affected people in Eastern Visayas \nwith  access  to  emergency  support  and  early  recovery  systems.  ADB\u2019s  support  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s conditional cash transfer program partially funds 200,000 families in the affected \nareas,  with  at  least  69,000  households  in  the  severely  affected  areas.20 In  collaboration  with \nother  development  partners,  ADB  assisted  the  government  in  the  preparation  of  the  Yolanda \nRecovery Rehabilitation Plan. ADB has ongoing and planned operations in the affected areas. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  resiliency  of  poor  communities  to  natural  hazards.  The \noutcome  will  be  improved  access  to  services  and  infrastructure  for  communities  in  affected \n\n                                                \n16  These  are  (i)  Aceh  tsunami  in  December  2004,  (ii)  North  Sumatra  and  Aceh  earthquake  in  March  2005,  (iii)  Java \nearthquake in May 2006, (iv) West Java tsunami in July 2006, and (v) Mt.

Planning  and  investment  grants  will  be  provided  to  more  than  6,000 \nbarangays, benefiting about 900,000 households. Planning grants will support participatory and \ngender-inclusive  planning  by  barangay  residents  as  well  as  technical  assistance  to  ensure \neffective  subproject  selection  and  implementation.  Investment  grants  will  support  subprojects \nand  activities  that  respond  to  community  priorities. 21 Rehabilitation  and  recovery  efforts  will \nemphasize  building  back  better  and  disaster-resilient  community  infrastructure.  Subproject \neligibility will be based on an open menu and subject to an exclusion list.22 The open menu will \ninclude community proposals on disaster response and risk reduction.  \n\nCommunity planning will be facilitated in barangays. The KC-NCDDP staff will undertake \n13. \ncommunity  organization  and  facilitation  in  cooperation  with  community  volunteers  trained  in \nparticipatory  planning  and  subproject  preparation  and  implementation.  Community  subprojects \nwill  be  identified  and  selected  for  submission  to  a  municipal  forum.  Community  leaders  and \nvolunteers  selected  by  barangay  residents  will  represent  their  barangay  in  the  forum  where \nsubprojects will be prioritized based on size of the investment grant allocated to the municipality \nand locally agreed selection criteria.23 Program staff will undertake due diligence on subprojects \nis  committed. 24 Barangays  with  prioritized  subprojects  will  organize \nbefore \nimplementation teams to supervise and administer the subprojects. \n\nfunding \n\n14. \nOutput  2:  Institutional  and  organizational  capacity  strengthened.  The  project  will \nsupport  capacity  development  of  municipal  DSWD  program  staff  who  will  provide  facilitation \nsupport,  technical  assistance,  subproject  oversight,  and  local  coordination. 25  About  4,000 \nprogram  staff  and  their  local  government  counterparts  will  be  trained  in  CDD,  development \nplanning and management, conflict resolution, mediation within and between barangays, quality \nreview, local poverty assessment, and M&E. Program staff and stakeholders will be trained to (i) \ndevelop competencies in disaster-risk management; (ii) apply environmental and social safeguard \npolicies; (iii) respond to special circumstances such as vulnerability to natural hazards and climate \nchange,  presence  of  indigenous  communities,  and  areas  affected  by  conflict;  (iv)  facilitate \ncommunity  organization  to  ensure  the  inclusion  and  participation  of  marginalized  groups  in \nsubprojects;  and  (v)  embed  participatory  approaches  in  government  systems  and  processes. \n\n                                                \n21  Investment grant amounts are based on a formula using population size and poverty incidence.  \n22\n\n The  open  menu  of  subprojects  includes  community  water  systems,  schools,  daycare  centers,  health  stations, \nelectrification, tribal housing, access roads, small bridges or footbridges, pre- and post-harvest facilities, equipment \nand materials support, irrigation, drainage, sanitation, flood control, seawalls, soil protection, and artificial coral reef \nsanctuaries.  In  the aftermath  of  disasters,  the  menu may  be adjusted  to  allow  investments needed  or  justified in a \npost-disaster or emergency context (e.g., repair of public buildings, debris removal, shelter construction and repairs, \nuse of chainsaws for cutting fallen trees), including investments for cash for work or food for work, as mutually agreed \nby  DSWD  and  ADB.  The  exclusion  list  includes  activities  that  may  be  harmful  to  the  environment  or  indigenous \npeoples such as weapons, chainsaws, explosives, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, asbestos, and other potentially \ndangerous materials and equipment; fishing boats and nets exceeding the government-prescribed size and weight; \nroad construction into protected areas; political and religious activities, rallies, and materials; and activities employing \nchildren under 16 or unfairly exploiting women or men of any age.  \n\n23 Paras. 29 to 30 of the project administration manual discuss subproject selection criteria and process. \n24 This will comprise technical, economic, social, and financial viability assessments, including safeguard compliance. \n25 In  response  to  a  government  request,  a  capacity  development  technical  assistance  project  for  $1.5  million  will  be \nprepared  and  financed  separately.  It  will  complement  capacity  development  under  the  KC-NCDDP  with  the  (i) \nformulation of a learning and development framework, (ii) completion of curriculum design and learning modules, and \n(iii) establishment of institutional support systems.  \n\n \n\n\fThe project will strengthen the KC-NCDDP\u2019s financial management system, grievance redress \nand social accountability mechanisms, and knowledge development and exchange. \n\n15. \nOutput 3: Program management and monitoring and evaluation systems enhanced. \nThe  project  will  strengthen  program  management  and  M&E  systems  by  supporting  the \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  of  a  management  information  system  in  DSWD  for  tracking, \nmeasuring,  and  reporting  progress  using  key  performance  indicators.  The  system  will  include \nnational  and  regional  electronic  file  management  of  community  requests  for  fund  release  and \nsupporting documents. The project will also support third party M&E, at least one special study, \nand  capital  expenditure  requirements  for  program  management.  The  KC-NCDDP  operations \nmanuals have been updated and harmonized with ADB policies and procedures. \n\nD.  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  government  requested  an  EAL 26 of  $372,103,895  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n16. \nresources  with  a  4-year  implementation  period,  to  respond  to  post-disaster  needs  of  affected \ncommunities through the KC-NCDDP, including taxes and duties.27 The loan will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, custom tailored repayment method, an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending facility, \na commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \nloan  agreement.  Based  on  this,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  18.97  years  and  the  maturity \npremium payable to ADB is 0.20% per annum. The project is estimated to cost $663.838 million, \nwith  the  government  providing  $291.7  million  in  counterpart  financing  (including  taxes  duties \nand  financing  charges.28 The  project  investment  plan  is  in  Table  1.  The  financing  plan  is  in \nTable  2.  The  KC-NCDDP  has  an  estimated  cost  of  $1,132.0 million,  of  which  the  government \nwill finance 24% and the proposed EAL 33%.

An  external  evaluation  of  KALAHI\u2013\nCIDSS concludes that (i) CDD subprojects yield economic internal rates of return of 16%\u201365% \nand  averaging  21%,  all  above  the  hurdle  rate  of  15%  set  by  the  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment  Authority;  (ii)  the  unit  costs  of  CDD  subprojects  are  lower  than  for  traditionally \nprocured infrastructure projects, with cost savings ranging from 8% for school buildings to 76% \nfor water supply; (iii) investments in capacity development are associated with collective action, \nimproved  access  to  public  goods,  good  subproject  maintenance,  and  more  trust  among \ncommunity  members;  and  (iv)  social  mobilization  strengthens  the  match  between  demand  for \npublic goods and their supply making resource allocation more efficient.32 \n\nA  recent  impact  evaluation  of  KALAHI\u2013CIDSS  identifies  the  following  benefits:  (i) \n19. \nhousehold consumption increased by 12%; (ii) year-round road access improved by 9 percentage \npoints; (iii) higher employment rates, particularly among women; and (iv) increased marketing of \nlivestock and farm produce.33 The analysis of the project and its benefits (footnote 32) assesses it \nto  be  financially  sustainable  in  view  of  (i)  the  demonstrated  and  expected  benefits  of  CDD,  (ii) \nincreased  public  spending  on  the  social  sector,  (iii)  the  KC-NCDDP\u2019s  relatively  modest  share  of \ngovernment expenditures,34 and (iv) strong government commitment to use the KC-NCDDP as a \nplatform for addressing social development and broader poverty reduction needs. The use of the \nCDD  approach  in  post-disaster  rehabilitation  is  expected  to  generate  similar  (and  possibly \nhigher) level of benefits from what has been experienced in regular situations. \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n20. \nRenewed national commitment to governance reform has helped improve the Philippine \ninvestment climate and achieve strong growth. However, significant challenges remain for public \naccountability  mechanisms,  government  agency  capacity  and \nintegrity,  public  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and local governance. DSWD is  considered highly competent and \nwell  governed,  with  many  years  of  experience  in  effectively  managing  nationwide  CDD  and \nconditional cash transfer programs. DSWD also had many years of experience in post-disaster \nresponse. It has sound public financial management and procurement systems. Corruption has \n\n                                                \n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 J. Labonne. 2013.

The  Integrity  Development \nReview  of  DSWD  and  independent  corruption  surveys  rated  DSWD  as  among  the  cleanest \ngovernment agencies.35 DSWD engages robustly with civil society organizations.   \n\nThe  simultaneous  operations  in  several  areas,  coupled  with  the  expansion  of  other \n21. \nsocial  development  programs,  overstretch  DSWD  management  and  oversight  capacity.  Other \nimplementation challenges include (i) coordination of rehabilitation and recovery needs of such \nan  enormous  scale  and  the  many  stakeholders  that  are  likely  to  be  involved  in  these  efforts;      \n(ii)  interface  with  government  planning  and  budgeting  reforms;  (iii)  remote  and  inaccessible \nsubproject  locations;  (iv)  fiduciary  risks  with  higher  volume  of  transactions,  especially  for \nsubproject  investments;  and  (v)  local  political  interference.  These  will  be  mitigated  by                  \n(i)  interagency  governance  structures  operating  nationally  and  locally;  (ii)  enhanced  program \nmanagement  support  systems,  including  the  provision  of  adequate  personnel  and  functional \ndecentralization  to  regional  offices;  (iii)  capacity  development;  (iv)  a  strengthened  grievance \nredress system; (v) simplified procedures and reporting requirements; and (vi) robust monitoring \nand audit systems, including third party M&E and oversight by civil society organizations. \n\n22. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  DSWD.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the \nproject administration manual (footnote 31). \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n23. \nPoverty  and  social  impacts. The project focuses on poor and typhoon-affected areas \nwhere the impacts of CDD will be greatest.36 The project is expected to help reduce poverty by \nimproving  the  access  of  the  poor  to  basic  services,  supporting  disaster  recovery  and \nreconstruction  and  strengthening  resilience  to  future  disasters.  It  will  help  expand  poor \nhouseholds\u2019 livelihood opportunities and improve their incomes. Better access to health facilities \nand services will particularly benefit women, children, and the elderly. The project will help lower \nthe  incidence  of  waterborne  disease,  improve  access  to  schools,  and  better  connect  remote \ncommunities to town centers and markets. Healthier and better-educated residents will be able \nto improve their productivity and economic conditions. The project will strengthen institutions by \nenhancing  community  participation  in  local  governance,  increasing  resilience to  disasters,  and \nbuilding social capital that reinforces the sustainability of development efforts. \n\n24. \nGender  and  development.  The  project  identifies  and  addresses  the  needs  and \npriorities of women by ensuring mechanisms to support women\u2019s participation and voice in local \ndecision-making  processes  to  select  and  design  priority  infrastructure  investments. 37  The \nproject\u2019s  gender  action  plan  ensures  that  (i)  participatory  selection  of  subprojects  includes  an \nanalysis of the needs and benefits of men and women in the criteria for  prioritizing community \ninfrastructure to be rehabilitated or developed; (ii) separate meetings are held with marginalized \nhouseholds\u2014including  those  headed  by  women,  where  needed\u2014to  discuss  subproject \nproposals  before  barangay  assemblies,  in  locations  and  at  times  convenient  for  women;  (iii) \n20%\u201330% of the paid jobs created by the project go to women by 2017; (iv) the operation and \nmaintenance  plan  provides  20%\u201330%  of  paid jobs  to  women;  (v)  links  are  made  with  support \nservices  or  community  cr\u00e8ches  are  established  for  child  care,  so  that  women  can  take \nadvantage  of  employment  and  training  opportunities;  (vi)  50%  of  participants  in  all  capacity \ndevelopment programs are women; (vii) women\u2019s leadership of volunteer committees increases \n                                                \n35  Pulse Asia. 2011 Nationwide Survey on Corruption. http://www.pulseasia.ph/files/Download/3-28-2011%20MR3%20-\n\n%20UB2011-1%20MR%20on%20Corruption.pdf \n\n36  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n37  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fto  50%  by  2017;  (viii)  gender  mainstreaming  responsibilities  are  included  in  the  performance \ntargets  of  project management  officers;  and (ix)  all  program  staff undergo  gender training  and \ngender indicators are integrated in the KC-NCDDP M&E framework. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nEnvironment. The project is rated category B, as subprojects are not expected to have \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  Any  environmental  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  implementing \nsubproject  environmental  management  plans,  with  DSWD  monitoring  compliance.  The  KC-\nNCDDP  has  a  list  of  subprojects  that  cannot  be  funded,  which,  together  with  ADB\u2019s  list  of \nprohibited  investments,  provides  a  built-in  environmental  screening  mechanism. 38 The  CDD \napproach likewise ensures that environmental concerns are addressed and mitigation measures \nare adhered to during implementation. An environmental assessment and review framework has \nbeen prepared.39 An initial environmental examination document will be required for category B \nsubprojects and a project description for category C subprojects.  \n\nInvoluntary resettlement. The project is rated category B. Subprojects are expected to \n28. \nrequire little or  no  land acquisition,  as  they  are small  infrastructure  works  to  be  prioritized  and \nimplemented  by  communities.  A  resettlement framework  has  been  prepared,  and resettlement \nplans will be prepared and approved before accessing block grants for small-scale infrastructure \nsubprojects that have involuntary resettlement impacts.40 \n\n29. \nIndigenous  peoples. The project is rated category A as it will have direct and indirect \nimpact  on  indigenous  peoples\u2019  communities  in  eight  of  the  nine  regions  to  be  covered  by  the \nproject.  Project  design  will  ensure  active  participation  of  indigenous  peoples  in  small \ninfrastructure rehabilitation and  local  development,  and  improved  access to  basic  services.  An \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  indigenous  peoples  plan  for  subprojects  with  impacts  on  indigenous \npeoples.41  \n\n30. \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  resettlement  framework,  and \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  are  consistent  with  national  laws 42  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31. \nProject  implementation  risks  and  measures  to  mitigate  them  are  described  in  the  risk \nassessment  and  risk  management  plan.43 Risks  stem  from  the  scaling  up  of  CDD  operations \nwithin a post-disaster context, inclusion of several stakeholders in program implementation, and \nduplication of recovery and reconstruction efforts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n38  The ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) details prohibited investments. \n39  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40  Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41  Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42  DSWD\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  framework  incorporates  the  safeguard  requirements  of  the \n\ngovernment and the World Bank, as well as the principles and content of the ADB safeguard documents. \n43  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nInadequate institutional and \npersonnel capacity to implement \nand monitor the program in a post-\ndisaster context  \nDuplication of recovery and \nreconstruction efforts \n\nLocal political interference \n\nLack of participation by women and \nthe poor in capacity building \n\nErrors in recording and reporting \nproject transactions and other \ninformation \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nStrengthen  program  management  systems  and  due  diligence,  decentralize \nfunctions to DSWD regional offices, provide adequate numbers of technical \nstaff that could be quickly mobilized, accompanied by well-designed capacity \nbuilding.  \nWork  closely  with  stakeholders  and  provide  regular  updates  to  the  central \ncommittee  coordinating  line  agencies  in  the  formulation,  implementation, \nand monitoring of the Yolanda recovery and reconstruction plan. \nUse  the  underlying  principles  of  community  participation  and  transparency \nin  resource  allocation  and  decision  making  during  the  subproject  planning \ncycles. KALAHI\u2013CIDSS experience shows community priorities prevail even \nwith changes in political leadership. \nTrain  community  facilitators  and  volunteers  on  the  needs  of  marginalized \ncommunity  members;  where  under-representation  is  a  risk,  organize \nseparate  activities  for  marginalized  households,  including  those  headed  by \nwomen to select subproject proposals and related capacity building. \nSupport  the  establishment  of  electronic  management  information  and \naccounting systems  for  the  complete and  timely  capture and  verification  of \ntransactions  and  other  relevant  information;  ensure  subregional  technical \nand  compliance \ntransactions; \nconsolidate reports. Consolidate reports to meet national and regional data \nneeds. \nThe resettlement framework will require that subprojects are implemented in \nland where ownership can be clearly established. The CDD approach, public \ndisclosure  in  the  communities,  and  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  help \nensure compliance with the resettlement framework. \n\nregional  authorization  of \n\nreview  and \n\nUnclear information regarding \nownership and/or prior occupation \nof land to be utilized for the \nsubprojects \nCCD  =  community-driven  development,  DSWD  =  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and  Development,  KALAHI\u2013\nCIDSS = Kapit-Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan (Linking Arms Against Poverty)\u2013Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery \nof Social Services.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n32. \nThe government and DSWD have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.
