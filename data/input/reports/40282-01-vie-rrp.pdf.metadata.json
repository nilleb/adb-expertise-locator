This led to approval of \nan  initial  loan  of  SDR34.7  million  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of \nViet Nam in November 2006, as emergency assistance to support \nthe  Government\u2019s  response  to  calamitous  damage  to  rural \ninfrastructure caused by a series of typhoons and storms in 2005. \nThe  Project  is  aimed  at  (i) reinstating  essential  infrastructure, \nincluding  roads,  flood  protection,  irrigation  systems,  and  social \ninfrastructure  in  the  10  provinces  that  were  severely  affected  by \ntyphoons  and  storms  in  2005;  and  (ii)  providing  equivalent  or \nenhanced  storm  and  flood  protection  to  vulnerable  areas  where \nfeasible. Project implementation was initially deficient, with delays \nexposing  investments  already  committed  under  the  Project  to \nfurther  damages  from  typhoons  and  storms  in  2006  and  2007. \nProject  implementation  has  also  been  affected  by  cost  increases \ncaused  by  high  inflation  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy.  However, \nimplementation  progress  has  improved  markedly  in  recent  times, \nimplementation \nthe  mobilization  of  project \nespecially  since \nconsultants in June 2008. \n \nAt appraisal, the Project comprised 89 subprojects (39 priority and \n50  additional  subprojects).  Subsequently,  with  the  delays  in \nproject  start-up  and  given  the  urgency  of  some,  16  subprojects \nwere carried out using government funds. Thus, the total number \nof subprojects was reduced to 73 and reprioritized into 47 priority \nand  26  additional  subprojects.  With  recent  high  inflation  and \ngreatly  increased  costs  for  civil  works,  materials,  and  labor\u2014\ncompounded  by  additional  damages  to  infrastructure  caused  by \ntyphoons and storms in 2006 and 2007\u2014many of the subprojects \nnow have total cost estimates that significantly exceed the original \nestimates.  \n\n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \n\nii \n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \n\n \n\nThe  Government  is  trying  to  respond  to  this  situation  through  a \nreduction in the number of subprojects and by providing additional \ncounterpart financing. However, given the size and significance of \nthe price escalation, and the Government\u2019s inability to provide the \nfull  amount  of  additional  financing,  a  further  reduction  in  the \nnumber of subprojects may threaten the Project\u2019s viability. Without \nsupplementary  financing,  there  would  be  a  significant  financing \ngap that would put much of the investment to date at risk. Partially \ncompleted structures could either be lost or be unable to provide \ntheir  expected  protective  function  while  awaiting  finance  for \ncompletion  from  other  sources.  This  would  also  militate  against \nsustaining agricultural productivity in the project areas. \n \nAt least 13 priority subprojects also require design enhancements \nto  reduce  risk  and  vulnerability,  and  ensure  adequate  safety  for \npeople  living  in  the  area  and  for  the  sustainability  of  the  capital \ninvestments committed to rural infrastructure rehabilitation.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project,  as  stated  in  the  original  design  and \nmonitoring framework, is sustained economic growth in the areas \naffected  by  typhoons  in  2005.  The  original  outcome  is  rapid \nresumption  of  livelihoods  and  reduced  vulnerability  to  natural \ndisasters  in  the  affected  areas.  While  it  has  not  been  rapid,  the \nsupplementary  financing  will  contribute  to  the  resumption  of \nlivelihoods and reduced vulnerability to natural disasters. \n \nThe estimated cost of the supplementary financing is $30 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $3.3 million. The total revised project \ncost is estimated to be $93.9 million. \n \nSupplementary  financing  of  $25.5  million  (SDR17.085  million  to \nsupplement  the  $50.97  million  agreed  in  2006)  will  be  provided \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  provide  supplementary \nfinancing  for  the  Project.  The  supplementary  financing  will  be \nsubject  to  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  initial  loan,  and \nthe  repayment  schedule  of  the  supplementary  financing  will  be \nsynchronized  with  that  of  the  initial  loan,  which  has  a  term  of \n40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, an interest rate of \n1% per year, and repayment of principal at 2% a year for the first \n10  years  after  the  grace  period  and  4%  a  year  thereafter,  and \nin \nsuch  other \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement,  as \namended for purposes of the supplementary financing. The initial \nloan  was  approved  on  21  November  2006.  The  Government\u2019s \ncontribution from local sources to the supplementary financing will \nbe  $4.5  million,  including  all  taxes  and  duties.  The  Borrower  will \nbe the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \n \nUntil 31 December 2011 \n \n\nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially \n\n\fEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\niii \n\n30 June 2011 \n\nfor  consideration  of \n\n \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) \n \nThe  current  implementation  arrangements  will  be  maintained  for \nthe  supplementary  financing.  MARD  has  delegated  the  main \nresponsibilities  for  project  execution  to \nthe  Central  Project \nin  MARD\u2019s  Agriculture  Projects \nManagement  Unit  (CPMU) \nManagement  Board.  The  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  (PPCs) \nin the provinces where the Project is located are the implementing \nagencies  and,  through  the  provincial  departments  of  agriculture \nand  rural  development  (DARDs),  subprojects  are  selected, \nprepared,  and  implemented.  Each  DARD  has  established  a \nprovincial  project  management  unit  (PPMU)  under  its  direct \nadministration to carry out the works.  \n \nDelays  in  project  implementation  have  provided  lessons  that  will \nbe  applied  to  improve  performance  that  include  (i)  setting \ndeadlines  for  design  procedures,  after  which  subprojects  will  not \nloan; \nbe  eligible \n(ii) accelerating  training,  which  will  be  provided  in  each  project \nprovince and improving effectiveness by including PPMUs, PPCs, \nDARDs,  and  contractors;  (iii)  prior  review  and  endorsement  of \nsubproject  designs  for  flood  protection  projects  by  CPMU,  with \nassistance \nimplementation  consultants; \n(iv) assessment of a minimum of two alternatives for the feasibility \nstudies  of  subprojects;  and  (v)  increased  mobilization  advances \nfor construction contractors to prepurchase materials.  \n \nCPMU will create a database of all subproject contracts, including \nthe contract adjustments that can be included in project reports, to \nensure  that  an  up-to-date  reconciliation  of  \u201cavailable  funds\u201d  is \nmaintained.  The  database  will  be  used  as  the  basis  for  deciding \non the use of unutilized funds according to the following priorities: \n(i) given high price escalation, completion or upgrading of priority \nsubprojects  to  a  sustainable  standard;  (ii)  completion  of  priority \nsubprojects  through  enhanced  technical  design  to  ensure  safety \nconditions of structures, protection of human life, and protection of \nessential  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  additional  subprojects  that  meet \nthe required selection criteria. \n \n\nfinancing  under \n\nthe  project \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\fThe  current  procurement  conditions  will  be  maintained  for  the \nsupplementary  financing.  Civil  works  and  related  services  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Most civil works contracts \nare estimated to cost less than $2 million and are being procured \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents  and  procedures \ncomply closely with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and are being \nused for this purpose. Postqualification or the national contractor's \nregistration  and/or  classification  system  has  been  used  for  NCB \ncontracts. The  bidding  period  is  21  days.  Prior  review  by  ADB  of \ninvitations  to  bid,  bidding  documents,  and  bid  evaluation  reports \nwas  required  for  the  first  NCB  contract  in  each  province. \nSubsequently,  retroactive  approval  procedures  were  followed.  In \ncases where, for any reason, ADB does not approve the award or \nterms of contract, the Government is required to use its own funds \nto finance the contract or to refund to ADB any payments already \nmade from loan funds for that contract. \n \nA team of international and national consultants, with expertise in \nnatural  disaster  risk  assessment,  engineering  investigations  and \ndesign,  geotechnical  engineering,  economic  and \nfinancial \nanalyses,  and  social  and  environmental  aspects  was  recruited \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  to  assist  with  implementation  of  the \nProject, and will be maintained for its extended duration. \n \nThe  major  beneficiaries  previously \nidentified  were  about \n450,000 residents  of  remote  areas  of  the  project  provinces  that \nwill benefit directly from improved access to markets, schools, and \nother services; rapid resumption of income-earning activities; and \ngreater security from natural disasters. In the priority subprojects, \nthe  Project  will  reinstate  (i)  protection  and  irrigation  infrastructure \nserving  about  18,300  hectares  (ha)  of  land;  (ii)  211  kilometers \n(km) of rural roads (including 67 culverts and 5 bridges); (iii) about \n98  km  of  sea  dikes  and  flood  protection  embankments;  and \n(iv) construction  of  1,820  square  meters  (m2)  for  schools  and \nmarkets.  Based  on \nrisk  and  vulnerability  assessments, \nrehabilitated structures will have higher resistance to floods, storm \nsurge, waves, and other typhoon-related impacts (including larger \nconveyance  capacity  for  bridges  and  better  slope  protection  on \nsea  dikes  and  flood  protection  embankments).  The  causes  of \nfailure will be examined to ensure better design standards where \nnecessary,  and  the  completed  works  will  be  integrated  into  a \ndatabase linked to provincial disaster preparedness plans. \n \n\n \n\niv \n \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n\fv \n\nthe \n\nduring \n\nimplementation \n\nThe  risks  and  assumptions  relating  to  supplementary  financing \nare  (i)  continued  delays  to  implementation,  leading  to  cost \noverruns;  (ii)  an  attempt  to  complete  too  many  subprojects  by \nreducing  the  scale  or  technical  design  standards;  and  (iii)  further \nperiod.  Delayed \ndamages \nimplementation  could  arise  from  the  amount  of  time  required  to \ncomplete  the  adjustment  to  each  priority  subproject  contract  to \ntake  into  account  inflation  and  any  required  improvement  to  the \nexisting  design  specifications.  The  reduced  scope  of  dikes  and \nembankments  severely  reduces  their  effectiveness  and  often \ncreates  significant  risk  of  damage  to  the  partially  completed \nstructure. Measures are being taken to prevent recurrence of such \npractices.  Finally,  prolonged  design  periods  have  resulted  in \nadditional  damages  to  sites.  For  embankments  where  there  is \nriver  action  every  flood  season,  this  results  in  significant  site \nchanges that require additional design and technical inputs.   \n \nA  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  will  be  provided  for  advisory \nassistance to the Government in Geo-Information Technology for \nHazard  Risk  Assessment.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  $625,000, \nout  of  which  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge \nPartnership Fund will provide a grant of $500,000 equivalent to be \nadministered  by  ADB,  while  the  Government  will  provide  the \nbalance  of  $125,000  in  kind.  The  TA  will  support  increased \ndisaster  preparedness  to  mitigate  the  worst  impacts  of  climate \nchange through the provision of staff training for MARD\u2019s Disaster \nManagement Center and the Water Resources University (WRU) \non \ntechnology  such  as  geographic \ninformation systems (GIS) and remote sensing. \n\nthe  use  of  advanced \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f  \n\n \n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary  loan  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Emergency  Rehabilitation  of \nCalamity  Damage  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  administration  of  technical \nassistance (TA) for Geo-Information Technology for Hazard Risk Assessment, and if the Board \napproves the proposed supplementary loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard,  will  approve  the  administration  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  of  technical \nassistance  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge \nPartnership Fund. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n2. \nFlooding  triggered  by  typhoons  and  storms  is  the  most  prevalent  and  serious  natural \ndisaster in Viet Nam, which ranks among the top five most impacted countries to climate change \nand fourth in the world behind the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and Bangladesh in terms \nof  the  absolute  number  of  people  living  in  vulnerable,  low  elevation  coastal  zones.  In  2005, \ntropical storms and typhoons affected large parts of Viet Nam, causing loss of life and extensive \ndamage in 16 provinces. Many types of infrastructure that are critical to the livelihoods of poor \nrural  households  were  destroyed  in  the  10  most  seriously  affected  provinces:  Ha  Giang, \nHa Tinh,  Nam  Dinh,  Nghe  An,  Phu  Tho,  Phu  Yen,  Quang  Binh,  Quang  Tri,  Thanh  Hoa,  and \nYen Bai (the project provinces).  \n \n3. \nFollowing  a  damage  and  needs  assessment,  and  in  response  to  the  Government\u2019s \nrequest,  a  project  following  a  sector-like  approach  was  designed.1 This  led  to  approval  of  an \nemergency assistance loan (the initial loan) to finance the Emergency Rehabilitation of Calamity \nDamage Project (the Project).  \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nThe Project\u2019s impact will be sustained economic growth in the project provinces severely \n4. \naffected  by typhoons  in 2005. Its  outcome  will  be  rapid resumption  of  livelihoods  and  reduced \nvulnerability  to  natural  disasters  in the  affected  areas. This  is  being  achieved  by  (i)  reinstating \nessential  infrastructure,  including  roads,  flood  protection,  irrigation  systems,  and  social \ninfrastructure; and (ii) concurrently providing equivalent or enhanced storm and flood protection \nto vulnerable areas where feasible. \n \n5. \nThe  Project\u2019s  outputs  are  rehabilitated  and  strengthened  infrastructure  in  four  sectors: \n(i) flood  protection,  (ii)  irrigation,  (iii)  roads  and  bridges,  and  (iv)  social  services.  The  Project \nfinances  (i)  contracts  for  civil  works;  (ii)  contracts  with  national  consulting  firms  that  have \nrecently worked or are currently working in the affected districts for feasibility study and detailed \ndesign;  and  (iii)  a  contract  with  a  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  for  technical, \nsocial,  and  environmental  review.  The  project  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.2 \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of \n\nViet Nam for the Emergency Rehabilitation of Calamity Damage Project. Manila (October). \n\n2   Despite  the  Project\u2019s  failure  to  produce  rapid  results,  the  original  design  is  maintained,  including  the  impact  and \noutcome  statements  to  which  the  supplementary  financing  will  contribute.  Only  the  performance  targets  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n\n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n6. \nAt  the  time  of  project  appraisal  in  2006,  the  total  investment  cost  was  estimated  at \n$59.89 million, including taxes and duties of $5.8 million. The Government requested a loan of \n$50.97 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project. The \nLoan  Agreement  for  the  initial  loan  was  signed  on  7  December  2006.  The  initial  Loan \nAgreement has a 40-year term, including a grace period of 10 years, an interest rate of 1% per \nyear, and repayment of principal at 2% a year for the first 10 years after the grace period and \n4%  a  year  thereafter.  The  Government\u2019s  contribution  from  local  sources  was  estimated  to  be \n$8.92 million. The Borrower is the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \n \nD. \n\nStatus of and Progress in Project Implementation \n\n7. \nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) is the Executing Agency and \nhas delegated the main responsibilities for project execution to the Central Project Management \nUnit  (CPMU)  in  MARD\u2019s  Agriculture  Projects  Management  Board.  The  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees  (PPCs)  in  the  project  provinces  are  the  implementing  agencies  and,  through  the \nprovincial departments of agriculture and rural development (DARDs), subprojects are selected, \nprepared, and implemented. Each DARD has established a provincial project management unit \n(PPMU) under its direct administration to carry out the works. \n \n8. \nAt the time of project appraisal in 2006, the Project comprised 89 subprojects (39 priority \nand  50  additional).  Subsequently,  with  the  delays  in  project  start-up  and  given  the  urgency  of \nsome,  16  subprojects  were  carried  out  using  government  funds.  Thus,  the  total  number  of \nsubprojects was reduced to 73 and reprioritized into 47 priority and 26 additional subprojects. Of \nthe  47  priority  subprojects,  35  have  awarded  all  related  contract  packages  and  are  in  various \nstages of implementation. Of these, construction is expected to be completed for 6 subprojects \nwithin  2008.  For  the  remaining  12  priority  subprojects,  bid  evaluation  and  contracting  of  the \nrelated packages are at various stages, with one of these subprojects having to be redesigned \nand rebid, all contracting for which is expected to be completed before the end of 2008. Of the \n26 additional subprojects, all of which were identified and reviewed during appraisal of the initial \nloan,  16  have  completed  technical  designs  and  are  awaiting  confirmation  of  available  finance \nprior  to  commencing  the  bidding  process.  As  of  31  August  2008,  the  overall  project \nimplementation  progress  was  estimated  at  30%  against  the  elapsed  loan  period  of  57%.  The \ncumulative  contract  awards  were  $21.2  million  (equivalent  to  39%  of  the  net  loan  amount  of \n$54.5  million)  and  disbursements  were  $13.7  million  (equivalent  to  25%  of  the  net  loan \namount).3 The list of priority and additional subprojects is in Appendix 2. \n \n9. \nProject  implementation  progress  was  initially  deficient  but  has  improved  markedly  in \nrecent  times,  especially  since  the  mobilization  of  project  implementation  consultants  in  June \n2008. There were delays in project and loan processing, and an extended period elapsed before \nthe  Project  was  fully  operational  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  recruitment  of  the  loan-financed \nproject  implementation  consultants  was  completed  14  months  after  initial  loan  effectiveness, \nwhich  limited  the  technical  oversight  to  DARD  and  CPMU  staff. 4  The  Government\u2019s \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nindicators  relating  to  the  outputs,  as  well  as  the  inputs  and  activities  of  the  design  and  monitoring  framework, \nchange with supplementary financing. \n\n3   Project  implementation  progress  has  picked  up  considerably  since  the  project  review  conducted  in  March  2008 \n\nwhen it was only 17%. \n\n4   Although 14 months for the recruitment of consultants seems an excessive period of time, it is actually normal\u2014if \n\nnot relatively expedient\u2014given onerous government procedures that need to be followed. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nimplementation  arrangements  required  PPC  decisions  over  design  and \ndecentralized \ncontracting  procedures  without  detailed  implementation  guidelines,  which  also  delayed \nconstruction.5 The capacity of PPMUs has been inadequate in some provinces and the CPMU \ntraining program was delivered late and had limited impact. ADB staff changes also contributed \nto  the  lack  of  continuity  and  delays.  The  delays  created  two  unexpected  impacts:  (i)  the  2006 \nand 2007 storm seasons extended damage at many subproject sites,6 and (ii) the Project was \nexposed to cost increases because of inflation.  \n \n10.  Work  conducted  on  some  subprojects  displays  a  lack  of  quality  arising  from  design \nprocesses,  contracting  arrangements,  contract  supervision,  and  government  procedures. \nDesign  processes  have  not  adopted  least-cost  alternative  assessments;  have  been  limited  to \nreplacement  or  rehabilitation  of  specific  sites  without  addressing  either  site  or  offsite  risk  and \nvulnerability; have been influenced by the PPCs\u2019 preference to address a wider scope at lower \nquality  standards;  and, most  importantly,  were  driven  by  the  estimated budget  provided  to  the \nPPCs by CPMU, which results in lower quality design choices as opposed to the specific needs \nof  a  subproject.  Contracting  arrangements  have  been  used  to  increase  the  number  of \nprocurement  packages,  resulting  in  smaller  contracts  enabling  the  participation  of  small  local \ncontractors  that  do  not  have  the  experience,  equipment,  or  control  systems  to  achieve  the \nrequired  standards  for  some  subprojects.  The  lack  or  limited  quality  of  contract  supervision \ncaused  by  the  existence  of  many  small-sized  contracts  compounds  the  limited  capacity  of \ncontractors.  However,  project  implementation  consultants  were  mobilized  in  June  2008,  which \nprovided momentum with achievement of significant project implementation progress. \n \n11. \nKey  lessons  learned  and  to  be  applied  under  the  supplementary  financing  include \n(i) setting  deadlines  for  design  procedures  after  which  subprojects  will  not  be  eligible  for \nconsideration  of  financing  under  the  loan;  (ii)  accelerating  training,  which  will  be  provided  in \neach  project  province,  and  improving  effectiveness  by  including  PPMUs,  PPCs,  DARDs,  and \ncontractors; (iii) prior review and endorsement of subproject designs by CPMU with assistance \nfrom the project implementation consultants; (iv) assessment of a minimum of two alternatives \nfor  the  feasibility  studies  of  subprojects;  and  (v)  increased  mobilization  advances  for \nconstruction contractors to prepurchase materials.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nCost Overrun \n\nThe  estimated  total  project  cost  overrun  is  $30  million,  which  is  51%  more  than  the \n12. \noriginal  project  cost  estimate  of  $59.9  million.7 The  cost  includes  full  financing  (including  price \nescalation) for 47 priority subprojects costing $13.3 million, as well as $6.5 million for enhancing \npriority  subprojects  to  reduce  risk  and  vulnerability  and  $8.3  million  for  completing  additional \nsubprojects  that  were  reviewed  during  appraisal  of  the  initial  loan.8 The  balance  of  the  project \n\n                                                \n5   Government Decree 131 outlining its policy for decentralization of responsibility for the implementation of externally \nfinanced projects was issued in November 2006. The guidelines to implement this policy followed 10 months later, \nin September 2007. \n\n6   In  2007,  flooding  from  storms  caused  death  for  462  people,  33  others  went  missing,  and  856  were  seriously \ninjured. The floods destroyed 718,000 homes and severely damaged transport and irrigation infrastructure in these \nareas. The estimated costs of damages were more than $700 million. \n\n7   The  total  cost  increase  is  estimated  at  $34  million,  of  which  $4.0  million  is  financed  through  the  change  in  the \n\n8   The  original  list  was  not  fully  financed  because  fewer  loan  savings  were  made  available  to  fund  the  emergency \n\nSDR\u2013US dollar rate.  \n\nassistance loan.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n\ncost  overrun  is  for  management  costs  of  $1.5  million,9 and  interest  charges.  The  extension  of \nthe Project will increase the interest payments during the period of construction by $0.5 million. \n \n13.  Within the list of 47 priority subprojects, CPMU has identified 13 subprojects requiring an \nadditional  total  investment  of  $6.5  million 10 to  ensure  they  achieve  sustainable  construction \nstandards  that  enhance  their  resistance  to  damage  from  future  storms  and  typhoons.  These \nadditional  costs  arise  from  shortfalls  in  technical  design,  especially  for  dikes  and  river \nembankments, and additional damages that occurred during the 2006 and 2007 storm seasons.  \n \n14. \nThe  impact  of  input  price  escalation  was  assessed  for  four  contracts\u2014one  each  for \nirrigation, roads, flood protection, and social infrastructure subprojects, which are representative \nof  the  four  sectors  supported  under  the  Project  (Appendix  4,  Table  A4.2  provides  the \ncomposition  of  contract  price  escalation  for  case  study  contracts).  The  overall  contract  price \nescalation  from  bid  preparation  to  contract  signing  increased  from  25%  to  28%,  with  the \nincreased  prices  of  materials  comprising  about  two-thirds  to  three-fourths  of  the  total  value  of \ncontract price escalation for all sectors. For the road contract, price escalation on fuel costs had \na far greater impact (21%) than for the other sectors (less than 10%) reflecting the mechanical \nnature  of  road  construction.  For  the  flood  protection  contract,  labor  costs  constituted  35%, \nreflecting the highly labor-intensive nature of works on dikes and river embankments, while for \nthe other sectors price escalation on labor costs constituted from 17% to 25%. \n \nB. \n\nImpact on the Project \n\n15. \nUnprecedented  rates  of  price  escalation  threaten  the  successful  completion  of  priority \nsubprojects\u2019 works that have commenced under the Project. Additional costs were incurred from \nfurther  damages\u2014during  the  2006  and  2007 flood  seasons,  and  early  2008 floods\u2014that  have \ndelayed project implementation, exposing the subprojects to additional price escalation. Revised \ncost estimates of priority subprojects equate to 114% of the original total project financing prior \nto  any  project  management,  interest,  and  additional  subproject  costs.  The  financing  shortfall \ncreates  a  significant  risk  that  some  priority  subprojects  would  remain  incomplete,  delayed,  or \nconstructed to lower standards. CPMU and PPMUs have recognized the shortfall of funds and \nhave  placed  additional  subprojects  on  hold  until  supplementary  financing  is  confirmed.  ADB \npolicy on supplementary financing gives priority to financing cost overruns on works to address \ndamage caused by natural disasters, including floods, as is the case with the Project.11 \n \n16. \nThe  Government  is  trying  to  respond  to  the  significantly  higher  costs  of  subprojects \nthrough a reduction in their number and by providing additional counterpart financing. However, \ngiven the size and significance of the price escalation, and the Government\u2019s inability to provide \nthe  full  amount  of  additional  financing,  a  further  reduction  in  the  number  of  subprojects  may \nreach an extent that threatens the Project\u2019s viability. Some PPMUs have sought cost savings by \nlowering  design  standards  and  reducing  the  scope  of  subprojects,  which  is  resulting  in \nincreased risk and vulnerability in a number of subprojects. These subprojects include a school \nat  risk  from  embankment  collapse,  several  river  embankments  that  have  inadequate  toe \nprotection  resulting  in  toe  erosion,  and  incomplete  dike  construction  that  leaves  the  structure \nsusceptible  to  further  damage  and  potentially  jeopardizes  the  livelihoods  of  local  residents. \nThese enhancements would receive priority over additional subproject financing.  \n \n                                                \n9   Estimated  to  be  9%  of  capital  works  investment  in  enhancement  works  of  priority  subprojects  and  additional \n\n10  Excluding expected project management costs of $0.6 million. \n11  ADB. 2005.

Without  supplementary  financing,  the  expected  outcome  of  the  Project  will  not  be \nrealized  and  the  Project\u2019s  contribution\u2014albeit  small\u2014to  the  national  disaster  preparation, \nmitigation, and management goals will be significantly lessened. Much of the investment made \nto  date  would  remain  at  risk\u2014partially  completed  structures  could  be  lost  or  be  unable  to \nprovide  their  expected  protective  function,  while  awaiting  finance  for  completion  from  other \nsources.  This  would  also  militate  against  sustaining  agricultural  productivity  in  the  project \nprovinces. The exact extent of these impacts is not possible to predict, as it is not known which \nsubprojects will be completed, nearly completed, or abandoned without the detail of the actual \ncosts from contract adjustment negotiations that have yet to be undertaken.  \n \nC. \n\n  \nRationale \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Context  \n\nViet Nam\u2019s economy has been one of the fastest growing in Asia for the last 2 decades. \n18. \nGrowth was particularly strong in the last several years, with real gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowing by an average annual rate of 8.0% in 2003\u20132007. In 2007, real GDP grew by 8.5%, the \nhighest rate since 1996. GDP per capita at current prices increased from $441 in 2002 to $818 \nin 2007, while GDP per capita at purchasing power parity rose from $1,649 to $2,587. \n \nIn  recent  years,  however,  growth  of  aggregate  demand  outpaced  growth  of  aggregate \n19. \nsupply. While expansionary monetary and fiscal policies and extensive borrowing and spending \nby  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  fueled  growth  of  aggregate  demand,  growth  of  aggregate \nsupply  was  constrained  by  infrastructure  bottlenecks,  relatively  low  efficiency  of  public \ninvestment,  and  increasingly  acute  shortages  of  skilled  labor.  As  a  result,  both  internal  and \nexternal macroeconomic imbalances emerged.  \n \n20. \nOn the domestic side, average annual inflation jumped from 1.8% in 1999\u20132003 to 7.9% \nin  2004\u20132007.  Inflation  was  quite  high  in  late  2007  and  the  first  half  of 2008,  with  food  prices \nrising particularly fast. In June 2008, the consumer price index (CPI) was 27.2% higher and the \nindex of food prices (which account for about 40% of the CPI) was 44.2% higher than in June \n2007.  Such  high  inflation  was  caused  not  only  by  the  excessively  rapid  growth  of  aggregate \ndemand  in  2007,  but  also  by  the  rise  of  world  commodity  prices  (especially  energy  and  food \nprices) in 2007 and the first half of 2008 and the supply-side shocks of late 2007 to early 2008 \n(including  the  outbreak  of  pig  and  poultry  epidemics,  an  unusually  harsh  winter  in  northern \nprovinces, and floods in central provinces).  \n \n21. \nIn the external sector, the current account balance turned from a surplus in 1999\u20132001 \ninto  a  deficit  in  2002\u20132007  and  the  first  half  of  2008.  Moreover,  the  current  account  deficit \nwidened from 0.4% of GDP in 2006 to 9.6% of GDP in 2007 and an estimated 20% of GDP in \nJanuary\u2013June  2008.  Exports  grew  fast,  but  imports  grew  even  faster,  resulting  in  sharp \nincreases  in  the  trade  deficit.  At  the  same  time,  inflows  of  foreign  capital,  especially  foreign \ndirect investment (FDI), remained strong. Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization \nin  early  2007  improved  its  attractiveness  for  foreign  investors  by  making  the  policy  framework \nmore predictable. Net FDI inflows, which ranged from $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion in 2003\u20132006, \nsurged  to  $6.6  billion  in  2007  and  an  estimated  $5.0  billion  in  the  first  6  months  of  2008. \nConsequently,  the  overall  balance  of  payments  recorded  a  large  surplus  in  2007  and  a  small \ndeficit  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  Gross  official  international  reserves  almost  doubled  from \n$11.5 billion at the end of 2006 to an estimated $21.0 billion at the end of 2007, before declining \nto slightly less than $20 billion at the end of June 2008. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n6 \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Responses  \n\n22. \nIn response to accelerating inflation and the ballooning current account deficit, in March \n2008  the  Government  essentially  changed  its  top  policy  priority  from  maintaining  high  growth \nrates to curbing inflation and reducing the trade deficit (Appendix 3). In January\u2013June 2007, it \ntook a range of measures aimed at achieving these objectives. Among them were tightening of \nmonetary  and  fiscal  policies.  The  minimum  reserve  requirements  for  banks  and  the  policy \ninterest  rates  were  raised  considerably.  While  budgetary  expenditure  on  targeted  social \nassistance programs increased, administrative and capital expenditures were cut substantially. \nInvestments by SOEs (especially in noncore businesses) were curtailed.  \n \n23. \nThere  are  signs  that  these  measures  are  restraining  growth  of  aggregate  demand  and \nreducing the macroeconomic imbalances. Growth of money supply slowed down from 46.1% in \n2007 to an annualized rate of 15.7% in the first quarter of 2008. The balance of the consolidated \nbudget turned from a deficit of 5.5% of GDP in 2007 to a surplus of 0.4% of GDP in the first half \nof 2008. Year-on-year GDP growth moderated to 6.5% in January\u2013June 2008. Monthly inflation \ndecelerated from 3.9% in May 2008 to 2.1% in June 2008, with the rise of food prices slowing \ndown  from  4.6%  to  2.3%.  The  trade  deficit  narrowed  from  $3.4  billion  in  March  2008  to \n$0.8 billion  in  July  2008.  In  a  sign  that  foreign  investors  remain  optimistic  about  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nmedium-term economic prospects, new FDI commitments soared to $31.6 billion in the first half \nof 2008 from $20.3 billion for the entire year of 2007. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Price Escalation  \n\nThe  impact  of  inflation  on  project  costs  has  been  significant  (Appendix  4).  The  impact \n24. \nwas  compounded  by  the  sector-like  disbursement  modality  that  applies  no  price  contingency. \nPrice escalation for subprojects designed in July 2007 and constructed for completion in 2009 \nmay exceed 25%. Usually, the Government would be expected to apply available funds to the \nlist of subprojects, with any shortfall being managed through a reduction in scope. Following this \napproach  for  an  emergency  assistance  loan,  given  the  extreme  impact  of  price  escalation  in \nViet Nam\u2019s economy, would seriously erode the project outcome.  \n \nThe timing of the preparation of bidding documentation has meant that many contracts \n25. \nwere  awarded  before  the  January  2008  announcement  of  wage  increases,  and  indicative \nbudgets  had  no  allowances  for  price  increases  on  labor  costs,  fuel  costs,  or  construction \nmaterials.  As  such,  these  contract  prices  are  now  insufficient  to  complete  the  required  works \nprogram.  \n \n26. \nThe estimation of price escalation can only be indicative as the actual cost will depend \non  the  period  until  project  completion,  and  further  delays  could  be  caused  by  weather  or \nseasonal  constraints  and  procedural  delays  with  the  government  process  to  adjust  existing \ncontracts. \n \n\n4. \n\nExisting Contract Adjustments  \n\n27. \nAs  a  matter  of  policy,  ADB  does  not  endorse  changes  in  contract  prices  that  are  not \nalready  permissible  under  the  terms  of  the  contract.  However,  for  the  reasons  set  out  above, \nflexibility  has  been  allowed. 12  Supplementary  financing  will  require  consideration  of  two \n\n                                                \n12  ADB  Central  Operations  Services  Office  memo  dated  26  August  2006  on  Price  Adjustments  in  ADB-Financed \n\nContracts Due to High Inflation. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nimportant  aspects.  First,  existing  contracts  will  need  to  be  adjusted  for  inflation  in  accordance \nwith government procedures (key steps in the adjustment process are in Appendix 4). Second, \nCPMU  needs  to  ensure  that  future  contracting  incorporates  forecast  price  increases  and \nprovides a budget ceiling that enables the contract to be completed.  \n \n28. \nA number of constraints need to be considered in the Government\u2019s contract adjustment \nprocess.  Requirements  include  (i)  only  one  adjustment  is  allowed  per  contract,  (ii)  future \ninflation is limited to 10%, and (iii) the process relies on official unit prices which may vary from \nmarket prices. These factors require the timing of contract adjustments to be sufficiently late to \nenable as much actual information as possible to be included in the adjustment while not being \nso  late  that  a  contract  stops.  Ideally,  the  procedure  would  be  concluded  by  the  time \ndisbursements on the original contract reach 80%. \n \n29. \nIn addition to the price escalation adjustments needed on most contracts, the design of \nat  least  13  identified  subprojects  also  needs  to  be  adjusted  to  ensure  that  these  investments \nachieve  an  acceptable  level  of  risk  reduction  from  possible  failures.  River  embankments  and \nsea  dikes  for  flood  protection,  in  particular,  have  had  significant  weaknesses  identified.  These \nneed to be prioritized to ensure existing investments are not wasted, and to reduce the threat to \nlife and the structures themselves to an acceptable level. \n \nCPMU,  with  the  assistance  of  project  implementation  consultants,  needs  to  review  the \n30. \ntechnical  specifications  for  all  flood  protection  subprojects  and  ensure  that  they  are  corrected \nand improved as applicable in accordance with the recommendations of the reviews. Availability \nof  supplementary  financing  is  conditional  on  these  steps  being  taken  to  reduce  the  risks  for \nsubprojects  already  identified  as  defective,  and  introduces  covenants  into  the  initial  Loan \nAgreement by way of an amendment to ensure that no further disbursements are authorized for \nany flood protection subproject unless and until its design specifications have been verified and \nthe works corrected to the satisfaction of ADB. Where there have been prior disbursements and \nwhere  the  design  specifications  or  works  do  not  meet  ADB  standards,  any  loan  proceeds \nalready  disbursed  in  respect  of  such  subprojects  shall  be  refunded  to  ADB  immediately  and \nunconditionally. \n \n31.  With  supplementary  financing,  the  project  implementation  period  will  be  extended  by \n2 years.  The  extension  is  needed  to  complete  construction  of  the  priority  subprojects,  most  of \nwhich will require contract adjustments caused by high price escalation in Viet Nam that was not \nreasonably  predictable  during  early  stages  of  project  implementation.  Furthermore,  at  least \n13 of the 47 priority subprojects will also require contract adjustments to accommodate needed \ndesign  enhancements,  which  did  not  become  apparent  until  post-reviews  by  the  project \nimplementation consultants revealed design faults, especially with flood protection subprojects. \nFinally,  the  2-year  extension  is  needed  to  complete  construction  of  additional  subprojects  that \nwill  be  assessed  and  deemed  eligible  for  financing  after  the  priorities  mentioned  above  have \nbeen  addressed  and  adequate  financing  determined  to  be  available.  Technical  designs  have \nbeen  completed  for  16  of  these  additional  subprojects,  which  are  awaiting  confirmation  of \nfinancing before proceeding to the bid processing stage. \n \nD. \n\nRevised Cost Estimates \n\nThe  estimated  cost  of  supplementary  financing  is  $30.0  million,  including  taxes  and \n\n32. \nduties of $3.3 million (Table 1).

Detailed cost estimates by financier are in Appendix 5. \n \n34. \nThe  supplementary  financing  will  be  provided  under  an  amendment  to  the  initial  Loan \nAgreement  (the  Amendment  Agreement),  providing  for  (i)  an  aggregate  SDR  loan  amount \n(being the  SDR  amount under  the  initial  loan  increased  by  the supplementary financing); (ii) a \nconsolidated  repayment  schedule  for  the  initial  loan  and  the  supplementary  financing;  and \n(iii) certain  clarifications  and  amendments  to  the  implementation  arrangements,  as  detailed  in \nthis report and recommendation of the President (RRP). \n \n\n                                                \n13 Based on the 28 October 2008 SDR\u2013US dollar conversion of 0.67. \n14 Based on the SDR\u2013US dollar conversion rate at the time of loan negotiations. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\n \nF. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan for Supplementary Loan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n\n25.5 \n4.5 \n\n30.0 \n\n% \n85.0 \n15.0 \n\n100.0 \n\nRemedial Steps \n\nThe  major  threat  and  risk  to  continuation  of  the  Project  is  the  prospect  of  prolonged \n35. \nperiods  for  designing  and  implementing  subprojects.  A  number  of  remedial  steps  have  been \nidentified  and  agreed  with  MARD  and  CPMU.  These  include  (i)  fast-tracking  contracting, \n(ii) maximizing  mobilization  payments  for  purchase  of  materials,  (iii)  reduced  construction \nwindows,  (iv)  timely  adjustment  of  existing  contracts,  and  (v)  reprioritization  of  additional \nsubprojects  based  on  the  performance  of  each  PPMU  to  design  and  implement  priority \nsubprojects.  There  are  also  recent  initiatives  to  align  ADB\u2019s  procedures  with  those  of  the \nGovernment to improve project performance in general.15 \n \n36. \nReview  missions  will  ensure  that  implementation  plans  are  being  achieved,  and  where \ndelays  are  being  incurred  in  a  particular  subproject,  options  (including  the  cancellation  of  the \nsubproject) will be reviewed and applied.16 Full project reviews will be conducted by specialized \nstaff  of  the  Viet  Nam  Resident  Mission  twice  a  year  for  the  duration  of  the  implementation \nperiod. \n \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nG. \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nthe \n\nThe \n\ninitial \n\nimplementation  arrangements  of \n\n37. \nloan  will  be  maintained  and \nstrengthened.  Improvements  will  be  introduced  both  in  the  Amendment  Agreement  and  in  the \nproject administration memorandum to ensure that (i) CPMU and DARD work closely to monitor \nthe  level  of  price  adjustments  on  existing  contracts  to  ensure  that  overall  project  financing  is \navailable before commitments are made to additional subprojects, (ii) design specifications and \nconstruction  are  maintained  or  improved  (iii)  contract  pricing  is  adjusted  to  accommodate \ninflation, and (iv) procedures for use of funds are reprioritized.   \n \n38. \nThe  RRP  for  the  initial  loan  of  the  Project  provides  indicative  costs  for  additional \nsubprojects.  This  RRP  does  not  provide  these  estimates  so  they  cannot  be  used  as  a \ndeterminant of subproject design, acting as a constraint irrespective of site or technical needs. \nUnder  previous  arrangements,  major  works  were  being  simplified  and/or  had  their  scope \nreduced to fit the indicative budget. CPMU needs to ensure that design processes move into a \nfar  more  sustainable  form  of  subproject  design  based  on  site  investigations  and  a  design  that \n\n \n\n                                                \n15 The Viet Nam Country Portfolio Review Mission in September\u2013October 2008 proposed a number of advance and \n\npreparatory actions to improve project performance. \n\n16  The  Project  Review  Mission  conducted  simultaneously  with  the  Supplementary  Loan  Fact-Finding  Mission \n(24 July\u201312  August  2008)  recommended  12  measures  for  CPMU\u2019s  and  PPMUs\u2019  improvement  of  project \nperformance and implementation. These were subsequently agreed when the aide memoire of the Project Review \nMission was signed by the director, CPMU on 17 September 2008.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n10 \n \n\nresponds to site and technical needs, and not simply a design for spending the budget. As such, \nall designs for additional subprojects will need to be reviewed by CPMU, with the assistance of \nthe  project  implementation  consultants,  to  ensure  that  all  findings  are  incorporated  into  the \ncontract  documentation.  ADB  will  endorse  the  bidding  and  contract  documentation  once  it  is \nassured all findings are incorporated.  \n \n39. \nThe scope of the design inputs also needs to be reconsidered. The current approach of \nfocusing  on  a  site-based  response  to  damages  will  be  expanded  to  a  system-wide  approach \nwithin which a site is located. For example, the current approach of building a river embankment \nto  protect  land  on  one  side  of  a  river  often  results  in  damages  downstream  on  the  opposite \nbank.  A  proper  assessment  would  factor  these  impacts  into  the  design  process,  thus  the \nrequirement for prior approval of designs for additional subprojects is critical to ensure that such \nconsiderations are fully addressed. \n \n40. \nTo manage the supplementary financing, CPMU will create a database of all subproject \ncontracts, including the contract adjustments, that can be included in project reports to ensure \nthat an up-to-date reconciliation of \u201cavailable funds\u201d is maintained. The database will be used as \nthe basis for deciding on the use of unutilized funds according to the following priorities: (i) given \nhigh price escalation, completion or upgrading of priority subprojects to a sustainable standard; \n(ii)  completion  of  priority  subprojects  through  enhanced  technical  design  to  ensure  safety \nconditions of structures, protection of human life, and protection of essential infrastructure; and \n(iii)  additional  subprojects  that  meet  the  required  selection  criteria,  including  demonstrated \ncapacity  of  relevant  PPMUs.  CPMU  will  be  supported  in  these  assessments  by  the  project \nimplementation  consultants  whose  focus  will  move  to  (i)  capacity  building  of  PPMUs, \n(ii) technical support for CPMU, and (iii) technical assessment of both enhanced and additional \nsubprojects. CPMU\u2019s primary role of monitoring and evaluation will be strengthened through the \ndevelopment of a structured training needs assessment and plan. The training program will be \nimplemented  and \nthe \nsupplementary financing. \n \n41. \nThe procedure for additional subprojects will involve the following: (i) PPMU requesting \nCPMU support for an original budget allocation; (ii) a site investigation is conducted and design \noptions  (minimum  of  two)  are  reviewed  by  the  project  implementation  consultants;  (iii)  if \nendorsed, the PPC provides approval for feasibility study and detailed costing; (iv) the feasibility \nstudy  would  then  be  reviewed  by  the  consultant\u2019s  safeguard  specialists;  and  (v)  if  endorsed, \nCPMU  would  then  seek  ADB\u2019s  endorsement,  which  would  trigger  allocation  of  budget  for \nimplementation.  \n \n42. \nThe  process  for  additional  subprojects  is  not  to  be  a  provincial  allocation  model  but  a \ncompetitive application process, with the first to apply being first to access available funds. This \nwill be partly self-determined, based on demonstrated capacity of relevant PPMUs. A final cutoff \ndate for approval of additional subprojects is 30 June 2009. \n  \n43. \nSelection  Criteria  and  Approval  for  All  Subprojects.  All subprojects are required to \nmeet the same criteria as applicable under the initial Loan Agreement (paragraph 5 of Schedule \n5 to the initial Loan Agreement): \n  \n\nthe  evaluation  workshops  completed  prior \n\nto  effectiveness  of \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nOnly  subprojects  damaged  by  the  2005  series  of  typhoons  and  tropical  storms \nwill be considered for inclusion in the Project.  \nSubprojects  with  unacceptable  environmental  or  social  impacts  or  significant \nresettlement may not be included. \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nNo  subprojects  will  be  located  within  or  adjacent  to  designated  protected  or \nconservation  areas  and  their  buffer  zones,  nor  will  any  subproject  change  the \ncourse  of  a  river  or  alter  river  characteristics  in  a  significant  way,  or  have  the \npotential to make significant changes in the surrounding environment. \nIn  the  case  of  a  flood  protection  subproject,17 the  design  specification  for  such \nsubproject shall be approved by ADB.  \nRehabilitation  is  technically  feasible,  cost-effective,  financially  viable,  and \nsustainable,  and  represents  a  least-cost  alternative,  while  incorporating  natural \ndisaster risk reduction measures where necessary and feasible.18 \nA  subproject  may  only  be  considered  if  the  PPC  has  an  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  plan  for  the  subproject,  and  provides  an  assurance  of \nannual  O&M  budget  (exclusive  of  any  beneficiary  contribution  that  may  be \nnegotiated during subproject selection and preparation).  \n\n(vii)  Only subprojects for which the contracted works can be completed during project \nimplementation may be considered, with final approvals in place before 30 June \n2009. \n\n(viii)  Partial  financing  of  a  subproject  from  sources  other  than  the  loan  and  related \ngovernment  counterpart  funding  is  permissible  provided  the  amounts  and \nsources  of  all  such  external  funding  are  clearly  and  transparently  presented  as \npart of the financing plan and submitted to ADB for approval. \nNo subproject costing less than $300,000 equivalent will be eligible for financing \nunder  the  Project  unless  otherwise  agreed  by  ADB,  and  there  shall  be  no \ngrouping of smaller works program to attain this cost requirement.19 \n\n(ix) \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\n44.  \nThe  project  implementation  period  is  for  over  48  months  from  the  date  of  loan \neffectiveness of the initial loan, with project completion expected to occur by 30 June 2011 and \nloan closing date on 31 December 2011, against a project completion date of 30 June 2009 and \nloan  closing  date  of  31  December  2009  under  the  initial  loan.  The  indicative  project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3.  \n\nProcurement \n\n45. \nCivil works and related services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  SOEs  will  be  eligible  to  bid  for  contracts  if \nthey  are  legally  and  financially  autonomous,  independent  from  MARD  and  the  DARDs,  and \noperate  on  the  basis  of  commercial  law  and  practice.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost \nmore than $2 million equivalent will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). \nADB\u2019s standard bidding documents for the procurement of works (large contracts) will be used. \nPrequalification will only be required for large or complex subprojects as determined by ADB at \nthe  feasibility  study  phase.  Procurement  using  ICB  procedures  requires  prior  ADB  review  of \ninvitations  to  bid,  bidding  documents,  and  bid  evaluation  reports.  The  bidding  period  will  be \n42 days for ICB contracts.  \n\n                                                \n17 A subproject indicated as a flood protection subproject in Appendix 2 of this RRP.  \n18 Distributional analyses will be made to determine the nature and impact of all positive and negative impacts, and \n\nthe results will be used to improve subproject prioritization and thereby increase project benefits for the poor. \n\n19 The threshold amount is raised from $200,000 (under the initial loan) to $300,000 as a result of inflation. For the \nsame  reason,  selection  criterion  (vii)  paragraph  5  of  Schedule  5  of  the  initial  Loan  Agreement  (\u201cthe  estimated \nconstruction cost shall not exceed the original estimate by the Borrower by more than 15%\u201d) is not included as a \nselection and approval criteria with supplementary financing. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n12 \n \n\nCivil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $2  million  or  less  will  be  procured  through \n46. \nnational competitive bidding (NCB) procedures. The Government\u2019s standard bidding documents \nand  procedures  will  be  used  if  these  comply  closely  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines. \nPostqualification  or  the  national  contractor\u2019s  registration  and/or  classification  system  will  be \nused for NCB contracts. The bidding period will be 21 days. Prior review by ADB of invitations to \nbid,  bidding  documents,  and  bid  evaluation  reports  was  required  for  the  first  NCB  contract  in \neach province. Subsequently, retroactive approval procedures were followed. If for any reason \nADB does not approve the award or terms of contract, the Government will use its own funds to \nfinance  the  contract  or to  refund to  ADB  any  payments  already  made from  loan funds for that \ncontract. The updated procurement plan is in Appendix 7. \n \n47. \nA  team  of  international  and  national  consultants,  with  expertise  in  natural  disaster  risk \nassessment,  engineering  investigations  and  design,  geotechnical  engineering,  economic  and \nfinancial analyses, and social and environmental aspects was recruited under ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) to assist with implementation \nof the Project, and will be maintained for its extended duration. \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n48. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n49. \nA  TA  grant  will  be  provided  for  advisory  assistance  to  the  Government  in  Geo-\nInformation Technology for Hazard Risk Assessment. The total cost of the TA is $625,000, out \nof which $500,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia \nand Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB, while the Government will provide \nthe balance of $125,000 in kind. \n \n50. \nThe  TA  will  support  increased  disaster  preparedness  to  mitigate  the  worst  impacts  of \nclimate  change  through  the  provision  of  training  to  staff  of  MARD\u2019s  Disaster  Management \nCenter and of the Water Resources University (WRU) on the use of advanced technology such \nas geographic  information  systems  (GIS)  and  remote  sensing.  Further  details  of the TA  are  in \nAppendix 8. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts  \n\n51. \nThe  nature  of  the  Project  makes  detailed  determination  of  the  economic  and  financial \nfeasibility difficult. Under the disaster and emergency assistance guidelines, there is no explicit \nrequirement  for  economic  analysis;  rather,  the  economic  assessment  is  included  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s feasibility study guidelines. The review of economic assessments highlights these \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\ndifficulties  and  major  shortfalls  for  the  feasibility  study  guidelines.  Details  of  the  updated \neconomic analysis of selected subprojects are in Appendix 9. \n \n52. \nThere  are  four  types  of  subprojects:  (i)  irrigation,  (ii)  roads,  (iii)  flood  protection,  and \n(iv) social  infrastructure  subprojects.  Each  type  of  subproject  has  a  unique  set  of  economic \nbenefits,  which  requires a  different methodology  for quantifying  and  estimating. The  economic \nbenefits that can be attributed to the subprojects are discussed below.  \n \nFor irrigation subprojects, the primary benefit is increased agricultural production, which \n53. \nis  measured  as  the  incremental  increase  in  net  farm  income  for  the  project  area.  Secondary \nbenefits  of  irrigation  subprojects  can  include  improved  drainage  function  (reduced  or  avoided \nflood  damage)  and  multiple  use  benefits, such  as  water for  cleaning  and  drinking. Quantifying \nsecondary benefits is difficult and not normally done. Another important potential benefit can be \nimproved flood protection from a reservoir used for irrigation purposes.  \n \n54. \nFor  road  subprojects,  the  primary  economic  benefit  is  reduced  travel  costs,  normally \nfound through reduced fuel consumption and travel time. The estimated difference in the value \nof travel costs \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\" the Project provides the subproject benefits. The subproject \nfeasibility  studies  calculate  economic  benefits  based  on  projected  cost  reductions  from \nimproved road quality, increase in traffic volume, and changes in transportation mode. \n \n55. \nThe  primary  economic  benefit  of  flood  protection  subprojects  (i.e.,  sea  dikes  and  river \nembankments) is the value of expected damage avoided. Typically, there are three necessary \ncomponents to making this calculation: (i) probability of flood event occurring, (ii) probability of \ndike  failure,  and  (iii)  a  damage  function  based  on  the  magnitude  of  the  flood  event.  When \nestimating benefits of flood protection subprojects, it is critical that negative impacts arising from \nthe altered hydrologic processes are included as a negative benefit. The data requirements for \nsuch  estimates  are  quite  intensive  and  include  a  non-negligible  amount  of  uncertainty.  In  the \nexamined subproject feasibility studies, either no attempt is made to estimate economic benefits \nor  benefits  are  estimated  as  changes  in  production  values  as  projected  by  the  local \nsocioeconomic development plan\u2014the assumption being that protection from flood damage will \nallow  the  area  to  pursue  economic  development  strategies  successfully.  This  approach,  while \nhaving some legitimacy, does not accurately assess the reduction in vulnerability, which is the \nmain objective of a flood protection subproject. \n \n56. \nThe primary economic benefit of social infrastructure subprojects is less direct, but can \ninclude  the  value  from  achieving  a  higher  education  level,  improved  health  care,  and  more \nactive markets. While it is possible to quantify these benefits, given the focus on social benefits \nand  the  emergency  nature  of  the  subprojects,  it  is  not  worthwhile  to  pursue  an  attempt  to \nquantify these benefits for economic analysis.  \n \n57. \nThe  impact  of  capital  cost  escalation  on  subproject  viability  is  variable,  with  some \nsubprojects  still  being  feasible  based  on  the  economic  analysis  from  the  feasibility  studies. \nWhile  investment  costs  increase,  many  of  the  benefit  streams  described  above  also  increase. \nHigher  transport  costs  also  increase  the  benefits  of  saved  travel  time,  and  higher  rice  prices \nincrease the value of agricultural production, especially rice.  \n \n58.  Without  supplementary  financing,  the  47  priority  subprojects  face  a  14%  financing \nshortfall as their capital costs are now estimated at 114% of the original total project cost. The \nresult  is  that  some  of  these  priority  subprojects  would  not  be  completed  and  no  additional \nsubprojects  would  be  undertaken.  An  economic  assessment  of  supplementary  financing  only \n\n \n\n\f \n\n14 \n \n\nincludes the investment costs excluding the sunk costs, which are assessed against the benefits \ngenerated by the subproject less any benefits captured by the incomplete subproject. Where a \nsubproject  is  incomplete,  most  risk  reduction  benefits  will  not  be  generated;  while  for  some \nsubprojects, the uncompleted structure will create substantial additional opportunity costs from \ndamages  to  adjacent  areas. 20  The  adoption  of  a  sunk  cost  approach  would  present  the \nexpected  benefits  from  the  original  project  financing  being  assessed  against  the  reduced \ninvestment cost of $30 million. The resultant economic feasibility of the supplementary financing \nwould then be significantly higher than the original estimates for those subprojects completed. \n \n59. \nFor financial analysis, no subproject generates a direct revenue stream, so no financial \ninternal rates of return are calculated. The financial sustainability is addressed as a condition for \nsubproject  approval  linked  to  the  PPC\u2019s  financial  capacity  to  maintain  the  structures  after \ncompletion  of  the  Project.  All  subproject  feasibility  studies  include  commitments  to  meet  the \nO&M  costs  as  specified  under  government  guidelines.  As  the  investment  costs  and  scope  of \neach subproject are very small relative to the PPC O&M budgets, CPMU concludes that each is \nfinancially sustainable.  \n \n60. \nA key issue is the extent to which the government guidelines are appropriate, in terms of \nthe amount required for effective maintenance of civil  works integrity through time. Experience \nand field observations indicate that there is a significant gap between needs and stated official \nrequirements.  The  issue  is  recognized  by  MARD,  and  an  ADB-financed  TA21 will  address  the \nGovernment\u2019s  approach  and  inputs  for  O&M  of  publicly  financed  infrastructure.  There  may  be \nfurther  opportunities  for  synergies  with  related  activities  by  facilitating  experience  sharing  with \nother ADB-assisted investments in the sector. \n \n61. \nThe  major  beneficiaries  identified  in  the  RRP  for  the  initial  loan  were  about \n450,000 residents  of  remote  areas  of  the  project  provinces  that  will  benefit  directly  from \nimproved  access  to markets, schools,  and  other  services;  rapid  resumption  of  income-earning \nactivities;  and  greater  security  from  natural  disasters.22 The  Project  will  reinstate  (i)  protection \nand irrigation infrastructure serving about 18,300 hectares (ha) of land; (ii) 211 kilometers (km) \nof  rural  roads  (including  67  culverts  and  5 bridges);  (iii)  about  98  km  of  sea  dikes  and  flood \nprotection  embankments;  and  (iv) construction  of  1,820  square  meters  (m2)  for  schools  and \nmarkets. Rehabilitated structures will have higher resistance to floods, storm surge, waves, and \nother  typhoon-related  impacts  (including  larger  conveyance  capacity  for  bridges  and  better \nslope  protection  on  sea  dikes  and  flood  protection  embankments),  based  on  risk  and \nvulnerability  assessments.  The  causes  of  failure  will  be  examined  to  ensure  better  design \nstandards where necessary, and the completed works will be integrated into a database linked \nto provincial disaster preparedness plans.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial Aspects  \n\n62. \nSignificant  resettlement  impacts  are  not  expected  because  most  of  the  rehabilitation \nwork is being done within the existing right-of-way of the damaged infrastructure. Acquisition of \n\n                                                \n20 The  assignment  of  costs  and  benefits  by  each  subproject  within  a  \u201cwith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  supplementary  financing \nscenario was not completed because of the uncertainty over which subprojects will be completed and the limited \ntime for preparation of supplementary financing. \n\n21 ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  to the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Infrastructure  Policy  Reform  Support. \n\nManila (TA 4981-VIE, $1 million, approved 15 October 2007). \n\n22 With the  Government  wholly financing some  of  the  top-priority  subprojects  before  effectiveness  of  the  initial loan \n(paragraph 8), the number of beneficiaries may have changed prior to implementation of the Project, although this \nis not considered to have been significant.  \n\n \n\n\fsome  small  areas  of  land may  be  needed  where  infrastructure  cannot  be  reinstated  within the \noriginal  site.  This  may  occur  if  the  site  has  been  eroded  or  otherwise  rendered  unsuitable,  an \nalternative nearby site offers greater security in terms of future flood events, or sound technical \nand  financial  reasons  are  given  for  selecting  another  site.  The  Government  and  ADB  have \nagreed on a resettlement framework that sets out the compensation and other entitlements for \nany unanticipated land acquisition and/or resettlement impacts in accordance the Government\u2019s \napplicable laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). This same \nresettlement framework will be applied for the Project with supplementary financing. The Project \nremains category B. Short resettlement plans will be prepared for any subproject found to have \nresettlement impacts up to the limits of category B.  \n \n63. \nA high proportion of the ethnic minority groups will be affected in the subproject areas in \nHa  Giang,  Yen  Bai,  and  Phu  Tho  provinces.  The  Project  is  designed  to  ensure  that  all \ncommunities will benefit from the Project on an equitable basis. The Government and ADB have \nagreed  to  an  indigenous  peoples  development framework (IPDF)  prepared  in  accordance  with \nthe  applicable  government  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998).  The  IPDF  provides  a  policy  framework  to  screen  impacts  of  the  subprojects,  and \naccordingly, to prepare an appropriate indigenous peoples development plan or specific actions \nfor  the  subprojects  affecting  ethnic  minority  groups.  This  same  IPDF  will  be  applied  for  the \nProject  with  supplementary  financing.  The  Project  is  classified  category  B  for  indigenous \npeoples.  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts  \n\n64.  While  the  Project  may  lead  to  temporary  and  reversible  localized  negative  impacts,  no \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  foreseen,  and  the  Project  is  classified  as \nenvironmental  category  B.  A  generic  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  for \nthe  original  project  to  identify  potential  impacts,  appropriate  mitigation  measures,  and  suitable \nfollow  environmental  assessment  procedures \nmonitoring  mechanisms.  Subprojects  will \nstipulated  in  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  developed  to  ensure \ncompliance  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \n(2002). IEEs will be prepared for all category B subprojects. Although no environmental impact \nassessment  is  currently  required,  this  will  be  reexamined  during  detailed  design  of  additional \nsubprojects.  \n \nD. \n\nRisk and Assumptions  \n\n65. \nThe risks and assumptions relating to supplementary financing are (i) continued delays \nto implementation leading to cost overruns, (ii) an attempt to complete too many subprojects by \nreducing the scale or technical design standards, and (iii) further damages as a result of further \nnatural disasters during the implementation period. \n \n66. \nDelayed  implementation  could  arise  from  the  amount  of  time  required  to  complete  the \nadjustment  to  each  priority  subproject  contract  to  take  into  account  inflation  and  any  required \nimprovement  to  the  existing  design  specifications.  As  the  adjustment  process  has  not  been \npreviously applied and approvals do not follow established procedures, it is expected that some \ndelays will result. The impact of this risk is that CPMU will not have a clear understanding of the \nproject  financial  commitments  and  the  delays  will  limit  the  number  of  additional  subprojects. \nRisk  mitigation  will  be  through  CPMU  expediting  the  processing  of  initial  contract  adjustments \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16 \n \n\nas soon as possible to develop guidelines and procedures, and also to establish the precedence \nfor the overall process.23 \n \n67. \nThe reduced scope of dikes and embankments severely reduces their effectiveness and \noften  creates  significant  risk  of  damage  to  the  partially  completed  structures,  which  the \nGovernment  and  ADB  cannot  accept.  Under  the  Amendment  Agreement,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment will put in place procedures to ensure that this practice is identified and managed \nand  that  the  supplementary  financing  does  not  fund  flood  protection  subprojects  for  which  the \ndesign  specifications  have  not  been  independently  confirmed  to  be  satisfactory  and  the  works \ncompleted  according  to  such  specifications.  Lowered  or  inappropriate  technical  standards  to \nreduce  costs  also  create  risks.  To  date,  some  subprojects  have  not  had  sufficient  technical \ndesign  input  or  the  design  is  redundant  because  of  changing  site  conditions.  In  part,  this  risk \nthe  project \narose \nimplementation  consultants  until  after  designs  are  completed.  These  project  implementation \nconsultants have now been mobilized, and extension of their contract for the extended duration \nof the Project will be one of the conditions for effectiveness and availability of the supplementary \nfinancing.  \n \n68. \nto  sites.  For \nembankments  where  there  is  river  action  every  flood  season,  this  results  in  significant  site \nchanges that require additional design and technical inputs. Prior to final approvals, each PPMU \nwill complete a site investigation visit and confirm the validity of the design to the CPMU.  \n \n\nProlonged  design  periods  have  resulted \n\ntechnical  design  specialists  with \n\nthe  delayed  mobilization  of \n\nin  additional  damages \n\nfrom \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n69. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MARD  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated into the Loan Agreement, as amended under the \nAmendment Agreement: \n \n\nProvincial  project  management  units.  MARD  will  continue  to  ensure  that  the \nparticipating  DARDs  provide  in  each  PPMU,  for  the  duration  of  the  Project,  a \nproject  manager,  social  and  environment  sectors  coordinator,  economist, \naccounting  and financial  management  staff,  and  engineering  and technical  staff \nconsistent with the number and complexity of subprojects to be managed, to the \nimplementation \nsatisfaction  of  ADB.  MARD  will  ensure \nconsultants  recruited  for  the  Project  (or  any  other  team  of  consultants  recruited \nwith  the  approval  of  ADB)  are  assigned  to  (i)  assist  the  CPMU  to  review  the \nfeasibility  study  and  design  specifications  prepared  for  each  subproject  by  the \nPPMU  in  each  project  province,  including  any  variation  to  such  design \nspecifications; (ii) provide recommendations to the PPMU and CPMU to enhance \nthe  design  specifications for  each flood  protection  subproject  in  order to ensure \nthat adequate safety standards are met; and (iii) assist ADB, when requested, in \nassessing the final design specifications for a flood protection subproject. \n\nthe  project \n\nthat \n\n                                                \n23  Delays in the contract adjustment process could also result if inadequate ADB resources are applied for the review \nand approval of the large number of contract adjustments required. The risk will be mitigated with the assignment \nof  an  international  Central  Operations  Services  Office  procurement  specialist  and  the  recruitment  of  a  national \nprocurement specialist to the Viet Nam Resident Mission to assist with this process. \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nSelection  of  Subprojects.  MARD  will  continue  to  ensure  that  all  subprojects \nmeet,  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB,  the  agreed  selection  criteria  set  out  in \nparagraph  5  of  Schedule  5  to  the  initial  Loan  Agreement  (with  the  exception  of \nitem  (vii),  which  shall  be  deleted  and  item  (ix)  for  which  the  threshold  amount \nshall be increased to $300,000), and implementation arrangements, and that all \nsubprojects  incorporate  measures  to  enhance  their  resistance  to  typhoon \ndamage  based  on  risk  and  vulnerability  analyses.  Without  prejudice  to  the \npreceding sentence, MARD will also ensure that approval by ADB of the design \nspecifications is required before any flood protection subproject may be selected. \n\nDesign Specifications. MARD will ensure that the design specifications and the \ncivil works for all subprojects give due consideration to the recommendations of \nthe  project  implementation  consultants.  Disbursements  in  respect  of  a  flood \nprotection subproject will be subject to works being completed in accordance to \ndesign  specifications  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB.  In  the  event  where  loan \nproceeds for a flood protection subproject have already been disbursed and the \ncompleted civil works are deemed by ADB to be insufficient or not in compliance \nwith  the  approved  design  specifications  and  are  not  corrected  to  ADB\u2019s \nsatisfaction  within  a  reasonable  period  of  time,  ADB  will  have  the  option  to  ask \nfrom  the  Government  that  such  loan  proceeds  (or  any  portion  thereof)  be \nrefunded immediately and unconditionally. \n\nResettlement.  MARD  will  continue  to  ensure  that  only  subprojects  whose \nresettlement  impacts  remain  within  the  limits  of  a  category  B  subproject  will  be \nfinanced by the Project. MARD  will continue to ensure that land acquisition and \nresettlement  activities  are  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  laws \nand  regulations  of  Viet  Nam  and  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy,  as  reflected  in  the  project  resettlement  framework  dated \nSeptember  2006.  MARD  will  continue  to  ensure  that  subproject  resettlement \nplans,  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  given  in  Appendix  5  to  the \nRRP for the initial Loan Agreement, will be disclosed to people affected prior to \nsubmitting  to  ADB  for  review.  Approval  of  the  subproject  resettlement  plan  by \nADB  will  be  a  precondition  to  award  of  contracts  for  civil  works  in  such  cases. \nMARD  will  continue  to  ensure  that  independent  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the resettlement process and impacts are conducted by a qualified \nsocial science or other suitably qualified institution acceptable to ADB. \n\npromote \n\ncommunity \n\nCommunity  participation.  MARD  will  continue  to  ensure  that  the  DARDs \nactively \npreparation, \nimplementation,  and  performance  monitoring  of  subprojects.  Tender  documents \nwill  continue  to  include  provisions  to  ensure  contractors'  preferential  hiring  of \nlocal labor, to guarantee equal opportunities for female workers with the principle \nof equal pay for work of equal value, and to prevent employment of child labor. \n\nparticipation \n\nselection, \n\nin \n\nIndigenous  people.  MARD  will  continue  to  ensure  that  subprojects  will  not \nadversely  affect  indigenous  peoples,  households  headed  by  women,  disabled, \nelderly, or other similarly vulnerable groups. In the event that indigenous people \nare  affected  by  or  are  beneficiaries  of  any  subproject,  MARD  will  continue  to \nensure that their  rights and  needs  are fully  respected  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and  in  accordance  with  the  IPDF  dated \nSeptember 2006. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18 \n \n\n(vii) \n\nEnvironment.  MARD  will  ensure  that  each  subproject  follows  environmental \nassessment  procedures stipulated  in  the  environmental  assessment  and review \nframework  developed \nthe  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  dated  September \n2006.  MARD  will  further  ensure  that  IEEs  and,  as  may  be  required  during \ndetailed  design,  an  environmental  impact  assessment,  are  prepared  for  all \ncategory B subprojects. \n\nto  ensure  compliance  with \n\nB. \n\n(viii)  Award  of  civil works. The Government will not award any civil works contracts \nfinanced under the supplementary financing until (i) the resettlement plan for the \nrelevant subproject has been approved by ADB; and (ii) all resettlement activities \nhave  been  completed  and  related  compensation  payments,  replacement  of \nassets  or  other  assistance  for  the  affected  people  are  delivered  prior  to  the \ndispossession  or  displacement  of  the  affected  people  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement  plan  or  other  requirements  relating  to  resettlement  and  vulnerable \ngroups, as applicable. \n \n\n \nConditions to Effectiveness of the Amendment \n \n70. \nPrior  to  effectiveness  of  the  amendment  ADB  will  have  received  confirmation  from  the \nGovernment satisfactory to ADB that (i) the design specifications (or the procurement contract, \nwhere  the  design  specifications  are  included  in  the  procurement  contract)  for  subprojects \nnumbered 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44 in Appendix 2 to this RRP have \nbeen revised; (ii) the IEE for each of the subprojects referred to in (i) above have been revised \nto reflect the changes in design specifications; and (iii) the services contracts of the international \nconsultants have been amended to ensure that their scope of services reflects paragraph 69(i) \nhere above and extended until the revised project completion date, being 30 June 2011. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n71. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n\nthe  supplementary  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing \nRights  17,085,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Emergency \nRehabilitation of Calamity Damage Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, \nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum;  a  term  ending  on \n15 November  2046,  including  a  grace  period  to  14  May  2017;  and  such  other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Amendment Agreement presented to the Board; and \n\nwaiver  of  the  normal  2-year  completion  period  under  the  Disaster  and \nEmergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004)  and  as  more  fully  discussed  in  paragraph \n31 of this report. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n14 November 2008 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1       19 \n\n \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\nAssumptions and Risks  \n\n \n\n                 \n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \n \nSustained economic \ngrowth in areas affected \nby the 2005 typhoons \n\nOutcome \n \nRapid resumption of \nlivelihoods and reduced \nvulnerability to natural \ndisasters in the affected \nareas \n\n \n \nEconomic growth rates for \naffected districts \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRural infrastructure \nconstructed and repaired \nto agreed flood-resistance \ndesign standards \n \nImproved access to \nschools, markets, and \nother services \n \nReduced loss of life and \ndamage in future storm \nseasons \n \n\n \n \nReports of the Government \nStatistics Office \n \nProvincial and district \nstatistics covering economic \nactivities and poverty \n \n \nAnnual reports of the \nprovincial departments of \nagriculture and rural \ndevelopment (DARDs) in \neach project province \n \nProject completion report \nprepared by the Central \nProject Management Unit \n(CPMU) in the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural \nDevelopment (MARD) \n \nSchool enrollments and \nhealth clinic records \n \nDamage assessments of the \nCentral Committee for Flood \nand Storm Control \n \nAnnual reports of the \nprovincial departments of \ntransportation and \nconstruction \n\nOutputs \n \n1.

In 2007, real GDP grew by 8.5%, the \nhighest rate since 1996. GDP per capita at current prices increased from $441 in 2002 to $818 \nin 2007, while GDP per capita at purchasing power parity rose from $1,649 to $2,587. \n\n2. \nIn  recent  years,  however,  growth  of  aggregate  demand  outpaced  growth  of  aggregate \nsupply. While expansionary monetary and fiscal policies and extensive borrowing and spending \nby  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  fueled  growth  of  aggregate  demand,  growth  of  aggregate \nsupply  was  constrained  by  infrastructure  bottlenecks,  relatively  low  efficiency  of  public \ninvestment,  and  increasingly  acute  shortages  of  skilled  labor.  As  a  result,  both  internal  and \nexternal macroeconomic imbalances emerged.  \n\n3. \nOn the domestic side, average annual inflation jumped from 1.8% in 1999\u20132003 to 7.9% \nin  2004\u20132007.  Inflation  was  quite  high  in  late  2007  and  the  first  half  of 2008,  with  food  prices \nrising particularly fast. In June 2008, the consumer price index (CPI) was 27.2% higher and the \nindex of food prices (which account for about 40% of the CPI) was 44.2% higher than in June \n2007.  Such  high  inflation  was  caused  not  only  by  the  excessively  rapid  growth  of  aggregate \ndemand  in  2007,  but  also  by  the  rise  of  world  commodity  prices  (especially  energy  and  food \nprices) in 2007 and the first half of 2008 and the supply-side shocks of late 2007 to early 2008.  \n\n4. \nIn the external sector, the current account balance turned from a surplus in 1999\u20132001 \ninto  a  deficit  in  2002\u20132007  and  the  first  half  of  2008.  Moreover,  the  current  account  deficit \nwidened from 0.4% of GDP in 2006 to 9.6% of GDP in 2007 and an estimated 20% of GDP in \nJanuary\u2013June  2008.  Exports  grew  fast,  but  imports  grew  even  faster,  resulting  in  sharp \nincreases  in  the  trade  deficit.  At  the  same  time,  inflows  of  foreign  capital,  especially  foreign \ndirect investment (FDI), remained strong. Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization \nin  early  2007  improved  its  attractiveness  for  foreign  investors  by  making  the  policy  framework \nmore predictable. Net FDI inflows, which ranged from $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion in 2003\u20132006, \nsurged  to  $6.6  billion  in  2007  and  an  estimated  $5.0  billion  in  the  first  6  months  of  2008. \nConsequently,  the  overall  balance  of  payments  recorded  a  large  surplus  in  2007  and  a  small \ndeficit  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  Gross  official  international  reserves  almost  doubled  from \n$11.5 billion at the end of 2006 to an estimated $21.0 billion at the end of 2007, before declining \nto  slightly  less  than  $20  billion  at  the  end  of  June  2008.  FDI  committed  to  1,500  new  projects \nwith the majority of these in the industrial sectors. \n\nThe high growth rate and policy achievements are built on stability and an expansionist \n5. \neconomic  policy,  resulting \nincreasing  domestic  demand  along  with  strong  export \nperformance.  Consumption  growth  is  strong  across  all  sectors,  indicating  a  strong  domestic \neconomy where private consumption amounts to 63% of GDP compared to 6% of GDP for the \npublic sector.  \n\nin \n\n6. \nThe structure of the economy continues to change, with industrial production growing at \nmore  than  10%  per  annum  compared  to  services  (8%)  and  agriculture  (3%).  Investment  (FDI \nand domestic) has flowed to the industrial sectors, which have grown from 36% of GDP in 2000 \nto over 42% in 2007. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3             29 \n\nIn  summary,  the  period  following  the  Asian  financial  crisis  was  one  of  consolidation, \n7. \nstability,  and  massive  investment  in  the  economy\u2014driving  growth  to  new  highs  and  achieving \nthe Government\u2019s economic and social goals, often well ahead of schedule. At the same time, \nthese  pressures  have  led  to  macroeconomic  imbalances  between  aggregate  demand  and \nsupply. This has resulted in escalating inflation which, when combined with external commodity \nprice increases in food and fuel, has seen inflation exceed 26% in mid-2008.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic Shocks and Challenges \n\n8. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  economy  was  indicating  that  it  was  overheating  in  2005\u20132007,  with  excess \ndemand  creating  price  pressures,  a  growing  money  supply,  increased  FDI,  increased  credit \navailability,  and  continued  export  growth  providing  liquidity.  During  the  latter  half  of  2007  and \nearly 2008, the economy faced new challenges, including (i) rapidly increasing world oil prices, \n(ii)  increased  concerns  regarding  the  world  economy  and  the  fallout  of  global  financial \ninstitutions, and (iii) commodity price increases. These external shocks were accompanied by a \nrange  of  domestic  pressures,  including  (i)  inflation;  (ii)  increased  consumption  supported  by \nincreased incomes, credit, and FDI; and (iii) a booming construction sector. \n\n1. \n\nExternal \n\nThe  major  external  shock  has  been  the  rising  cost  of  oil  and  fuel  in  early  2008.  For \n9. \nViet Nam,  this  has  occurred  when  domestic  oil  production  and  oil  exports  have  declined  by \n1.5%  to  2.0%\u2014a  trend  that  is  expected  to  increase  in  the  short  run.  Viet  Nam  is  increasingly \nexposed to the international price of fuel for its own consumption and also for transporting the \ngrowing  volume  of  export  trade.  The  cost  of  mineral  fuel  imports  rose  by  150%  from  2000  to \n2006.  The  subsidized  nature  of  fuel  prices  meant  that  increased  world  prices  placed  pressure \non the government budget deficit.  \n\nThe growing demand for all commodities\u2014industrial and agricultural\u2014placed additional \n10. \npressures on the economy. The price of steel, aluminum, and cement all experienced increased \ninternational  demand,  largely  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  India,  resulting  in \nsignificant  price  increases  that  often  exceeded  100%.  For  industrial  commodities,  the \nburgeoning industrial sector requires increased raw material input, and there was little choice for \nthe  construction  sector  but  to  accept  additional  costs.  For  agricultural  commodities,  Viet  Nam \nwas able to benefit from higher rice prices as a major exporter of rice\u2014export receipts from rice \nincreased nearly 40% since 2005. However, this is mostly offset by the increase in non-rice food \nimports, which increased 300% from 2000 to 2005. \n\n11. \nAt the same time, FDI continued to increase, and through the first 5 months of 2008 FDI \ngrew  at  134%  compared  with  the  same  period  in  2007.  The  FDI  places  additional  demand \npressure on local prices and the need for imports. \n\n2. \n\nInternal \n\nFood prices rose rapidly during the first half of 2008, with Government Statistics Office \n12. \nreporting  increases  amounting  to  55%\u201360%  over  the  first  6  months  and  other  foodstuffs \nincreasing  by  over  20%.  The  effect  on  the  lower  income  earners  and  the  poor  was  dramatic, \nand  the  Government  responded  with  an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  from  D450,000  per \nmonth  to  D540,000  per  month. With  food  contributing  nearly  43%  of  the  basket  of  goods  that \nmake up the CPI, other price increases were delayed by the Government.  \n\n \n\n\f30  \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nThe  growing  cost  of  subsidies  resulted  in  the  Government  increasing  prices  of  fuel  in \n13. \nJune 2008. These price increases averaged 36% for domestic oil, 31% for gasoline, and 14.3% \nfor diesel. These increases are not yet fully reflected in the CPI.  \n\nIn  response,  inflation  rates  in  Viet  Nam  are  the  highest  in  Asia  reaching  21.8%  in \n14. \nJanuary\u2013June 2008. As such, the rate of inflation for 2008 is now expected to exceed 25%. In \nJuly  2008,  the  impact  of food  price  increases  has  reduced  slightly  on  a monthly  basis  as  new \nseason  harvest  begins  and  international  fears  of  rice  shortages  diminish.  Provisional  data  for \nJuly place the annual inflation rate at over 27%\u2014the highest since 1991. At these levels, output \ngrowth will fall by 26%, imports will increase by 29%, and the provisional estimate of the trade \ndeficit will be D18.8 billion.  \n\nThe economic growth rate forecast for 2008 has been reduced to 6.5%. The open nature \n15. \nof  the  economy,  combined  with  the  range  of  new  threats  and  pressures,  has  made  Viet  Nam \nmore  susceptible  to  the  changing  global  economy  and  especially  the  likelihood  of  increased \nglobal  inflation.  The  challenge  is  to  manage  these  pressures  within  the  current  management \nframework, without experience to draw upon. The rate of increase of foreign reserves and credit \nto balance trade payments in a period demanding tightening of monetary policy will be a difficult \ntask and will test the Government\u2019s commitment to market-based systems.  \n\nC. \n\nGovernment Responses \n\n16. \nIn response to accelerating inflation and the ballooning current account deficit, in March \n2008  the  Government  essentially  changed  its  top  policy  priority  from  maintaining  high  growth \nrates to curbing inflation and reducing the trade deficit. In January\u2013June 2007, it took a range of \nmeasures  aimed  at  achieving  these  objectives.  Among  them  were  tightening  of  monetary  and \nfiscal policies. The minimum reserve requirements for banks and the policy interest rates were \nraised  considerably.  While  budgetary  expenditure  on  targeted  social  assistance  programs \nincreased, administrative and capital expenditures were cut substantially. Investments by SOEs \n(especially in noncore businesses) were curtailed.  \n\n17. \nThere  are  signs  that  these  measures  are  restraining  growth  of  aggregate  demand  and \nreducing the macroeconomic imbalances. Growth of money supply slowed down from 46.1% in \n2007 to an annualized rate of 15.7% in the first quarter of 2008. The balance of the consolidated \nbudget turned from a deficit of 5.5% of GDP in 2007 to a surplus of 0.4% of GDP in the first half \nof 2008. Year-on-year GDP growth moderated to 6.5% in January\u2013June 2008. Monthly inflation \ndecelerated from 3.9% in May 2008 to 2.1% in June 2008, with the rise of food prices slowing \ndown  from  4.6%  to  2.3%.  The  trade  deficit  narrowed  from  $3.4  billion  in  March  2008  to \n$0.8 billion  in  July  2008.  In  a  sign  that  foreign  investors  remain  optimistic  about  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nmedium-term economic prospects, new FDI commitments soared to $31.6 billion in the first half \nof 2008 from $20.3 billion for the entire year of 2007. \n\n18. \n\nThe measures introduced by the Government include the following: \n\n(i) \n\nTightening  of  monetary  policy  with  three  interest  rate  increases  to  the  interbank \nprime  rate  (currently  14%)  and  the  imposition  of  a  30%  cap  on  credit  growth \ncompared with 55% growth in 2007. The State Bank of Viet Nam has introduced \nthese  measures  to  reduce  liquidity  arising  from  both  FDI  and  portfolio  inflows. \nSome  local  businesses  operating  in  export  markets  have  already  reported \ndifficulty  exchanging  foreign  currency  for  dong  to  pay  wages  and  rent.  The \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3             31 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nimposition  of  stricter  lending  rules,  expansion  of  future  bond  issues,  and \nincreased bank reserves all seek to absorb local currency and reduce liquidity \nFiscal constraint through reducing government and SOE spending by 25%. This \nis  to  be  achieved  by  slowing  down  publicly  funded  development.  Essential \ninfrastructure,  such  as  roads,  ports,  and  electricity  are  not  included  but  low-\nefficiency projects are targeted. \nExchange  rate  flexibility  to  enable  the  dong  to  appreciate  against  the  US  dollar \nbeyond  the  agreed  trading  band  of  0.75%\u20132.00%  to  reduce  imports.  However, \nthis will weaken export growth. \nThe  possible  introduction  of  import  controls  in  an  attempt  to  reduce  the  cost  of \nimports by $0.5 million for raw materials, components, and machinery. A further \nsaving of $1 billion in consumer goods, $1.5 million savings on steel imports, and \n$1 million  saving  on  oil. The  controls  are  yet  to be  announced  but  will  either  be \ndirect controls or through imposing import duties and fees.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4            \n\nA. \n\nPrice Escalation \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCING \n\nThe  Project  was  designed  in  2005  as  an  emergency  response  to  calamitous  damages \n1. \narising from typhoon and cyclonic storms. However, the loan was not effective until April 2007 \nafter 14 months during which some of the original core subprojects were funded out of necessity \nby  the  Government.  During  the  period  following  project  effectiveness,  detailed  designs  and \nfeasibility  studies  were  undertaken  and  initial  contract  awards  were  only  completed  in  the  last \nquarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2008.  \n\n2. \nThe impact of inflation has been significant and the effect compounded by the sector-like \ndisbursement  modality  that  applies  no  price  contingency.  Usually,  the  Government  would  be \nexpected  to  apply  available  funds  to  the  list  of  subprojects  with  any  shortfall  being  managed \nthrough  a  reduction  in  scope.  Under  (i)  an  emergency  response  loan,  and  (ii)  the  extreme \nimpact  of  price  escalation  experienced  by  Viet  Nam,  changes  in  scope  are  considered \ninappropriate.  \n\n3. \nThe  timing  of  the  preparation  of  bidding  documentation  has  meant  that  some  bidding \ndocuments were issued before the wage increase announcement, thus indicative budgets had \nno allowance for price increases caused by labor costs, fuel costs, or construction materials. As \nsuch, these contract prices are now insufficient to complete the required works program.  \n\n4. \nThe CPI data in Table A4.1 highlights the impact of inflation on the construction sector in \nrural  Viet  Nam.  Construction  costs  along  with  food  have  increased  more  than  20%  in  the  first \n6 months  of  2008.  Provisional  data  for  June\u2013July  2008  suggests  that  the  inflation  rate  has \nreached  26%\u201327%  compared  with  the  same  period  in  2007.  For  the  Project,  price  escalation \nfrom time of supplying bid documents (September 2007) to June 2008 is estimated to be 19.9%, \ncomprising  1.3%  per  month  for  October\u2013December  2007  (3.9%)  and  15.97%  for  the  first  6 \nmonths of 2008.  \n\nTable A4.1: Rural Cost Price Index for Viet Nam \n\nIndex in June 2008 compared with (%) \n\nBase year \n2005 \n\nJune \n2007 \n\nDecember \n2007 \n\nMay \n2008 \n\nIndex for the \nfirst half year in \n2008 with same \nperiod in 2007 \n\nConsumer price index \n\n143.57 \n\n127.22 \n\n119.01 \n\n102.10 \n\nFood and foodstuff \nHousing and construction \nmaterials  \n\n168.73 \n\n145.81 \n\n131.25 \n\n103.23 \n\n145.64 \n\n125.29 \n\n115.97 \n\n101.58 \n\n120.36 \n\n132.96 \n\n121.18 \n\nSource: Government Statistics Office. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n5. \nThe scheduled project completion date of June 2009 will see estimated price increases \nof 12% from July to December 2008 and 1.17% per month during 2009. Some subprojects are \ncompleted prior to this or have materials paid early in the period so are not affected to the same \ndegree.  The  different  sectors  also  have  a  markedly  different  profile  regarding  the  sources  of \ncontract price escalation. From four case study contracts (Table A4.2), contract price escalation \nestimates  ranged  from  25%  to  28%.1 However,  the  relative  contribution  from  different  inputs \n                                                \n1  The case studies applied the same timelines to demonstrate the impact of input inflation. \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4             33 \n\nvaries significantly for each sector. Price escalation on materials constitutes about two thirds to \nthree  fourths  of  the  overall  price  escalation  for  each  sector;  the  main  materials  are  rock, \naggregate,  cement,  and  steel.  For  road  subprojects,  price  escalation  on  fuel  constitutes  more \nthan 20%, which is more than double that in the other sectors, reflecting the mechanical nature \nof road construction. Price escalation on wages constitutes over one third of the price escalation \nfor  the  flood  protection  subprojects  while  fuel  comprises  a  significantly  lower  proportion  of  the \ntotal price escalation. \n\nTable A4.2: Composition of Contract Price Escalation\u2014Case Study Contracts \n(%) \n\nInput Contribution \n\nContract \nEscalation \n9 \n26 \n21 \n27 \n5 \n25 \n2 \n28 \nSource: Provincial reports to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. \n\nCase Study Sector \nIrrigation \nRoads \nFlood Protection \nSocial Infrastructure  \n\nLabor  Materials \n66 \n62 \n60 \n75 \n\n25 \n17 \n35 \n23 \n\nFuel \n\n \n6. \nThe  determination  of  final  price  escalation  can  only  be  indicative.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  design \nprocess requires that a budget be included in a bidding document as the ceiling budget. Many \nfeasibility  studies  were  completed  during  2007  and  offered  for  bidding.  The  contractor \nresponses  to  these  documents  in  early  2008  using  2008  prices  would  exceed  the  ceiling  and \nresult in a noncomplying bid. Instead, contractors used unit prices applying at the time of the bid \npreparation. The rate of increase on these contracts is likely to be substantially higher than for \nthose bids prepared after the recent price increases to labor, etc.  \n\n7. \nPrices  also  escalate  through  the  period  until  project  completion  and  any  delays \ncompound  the  impact  of  inflation.  The  causes  of  delays  for  subprojects  are  (i)  weather  or \nseasonal  constraints  to  construction,  especially  construction  for  flood  protection  and  dikes; \n(ii) the extension of the project and disbursement period by an additional 18 months through to \nmid-2011  to  enable  later  contracts  to  be  completed;  and  (iii)  procedural  delays  relating  to  the \ngovernment process for adjusting existing contracts for subproject implementation. \n\nFurthermore,  although  contracts  are  awarded  for  a  contract  period,  contractors receive \n8. \nmobilization  advances  that  are  used  to  purchase  materials  in  advance  to  start  work.  These \nadvances  offset  the  risk  of  future  price  increases,  with  the  overall  effect  of  inflation  being \nreduced.  Given  the significantly  different mix  of materials  and  labor,  and  the  above  variations, \nthe estimate of financing shortfall is described below. \n\nB. \n\nEstimating Project Financing Shortfall  \n\nThe estimation of the project financing shortfall was undertaken for each subproject and \n9. \naggregated  to  the  provincial  level.  At  the  subproject  level,  expenses  were  split  into  (i)  civil \nworks,  (ii)  project  management,  (iii)  other  expenses,  and  (iv)  contingencies.  The  civil  works \nexpenses  were  then  split  into  the  bid  packages  or  packages  to  be  bid  with  the  bid  price,  bid \nopening date, and contract completion dates identified.  \n\n10. \nPrices  were  inflated  for  the  periods  between  the  bid  opening  dates  and  the  expected \ncompletion date for each contract. The bid opening date, however, is not always appropriate as \ndiscussed  above.  Therefore,  to  ensure  coverage  for  this  in  the  assessment  of  the  financing \nshortfall, an additional 3 months of price escalation for the period prior to the bid opening date \nwas included.   \n\n \n\n\f34  \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nCosts  that  were  inflated  include  (i)  construction  and  civil  works,  (ii)  equipment, \n11. \n(iii) project management  and  supervision  costs, and (iv)  insurance  and  auditing  costs. Inflation \nfactors  used  were  based  on  the  construction  CPI  data  released  by  the  Government  Statistics \nOffice as shown in Table A4.3. The factors were applied to the bid price where available or to \nthe cost estimate where bids were not available.  \n\nTable A4.3: Price Escalation Factors Applied \n(%) \nJuly\u2013December \n2008 \n\nBid to June 2008 \n\n2009 \n\n19.9 \n3.3 \n\n12 \n2 \n\n14 \n\n1.2 \n\nItem \n\nPeriod Average  \nMonthly Rate  \n\n2010\u20132011 \n\n10 \n\n0.8 \n\nSource: Government Statistics Office. \n \n12. \nEach subproject has a contingency factor applied at the provincial project management \nunit  (PPMU).  This  factor  is  not  included  in  the  contract  but  is  retained  in  the  imprest  account. \nThe  use  of  the  budgeted  contingency  amount  is  based  on  a  decision  between  contractor  and \nproject  supervisor  who  jointly  apply  to  the  PPMU  for  its  application.  The  PPMU  submits  the \nrequest  to  the  provincial  peoples  committee,  which  makes  the  final  decision.  If  supported,  the \nPPMU  then  completes  a  contract  variation.  This  contingency  figure  is  not  inflated,  as  the \nfinancing shortfall and price adjustment remove any adverse price effects. The scale of physical \nadjustment is unchanged. \n\n13. \nTo  ensure  that  escalation  factors  were  not  applied  to  works  already  completed,  the \nescalation factors were applied to a declining proportion of total cost in each consecutive period. \nThe  average  project  cost  overrun  for  priority  subprojects  is  estimated  to  be  29%  and  totals \n$12.9  million.  The  bid  price  plus  the  cost  overrun  for  priority  subprojects  amounts  to \n$65.7 million or 114% of the total project cost.  \n\nIt is not possible to distinguish clearly which subprojects would remain incomplete in the \n14. \nabsence of supplementary financing. Many of the smaller subprojects required less design input \nand were contracted earlier while the larger subprojects have only recently started construction. \nThe  number  of  subprojects  estimated  by  the  Central  Project  Management  Unit  (CPMU)  and \nPPMUs that could not be completed is 25%. However, for some of these, the lack of completion \nmay be limited to final site clearances or restoration. For large priority subprojects, including sea \ndikes  and  river flood  protection  works,  these  would  either  have  (i)  incomplete  structures  or  (ii) \nstructures that are reduced in scope to below the design specifications (i.e., reduced length and \nheights). One of the biggest impacts would be the lack of finance for enhancing subprojects that \nhave begun construction using designs that are considered unsafe or at risk. This includes risks \nto a school, essential infrastructure, and significant numbers of local residents. These risks also \ninclude  a  risk  to  the  investment  made  to  date  which  could,  in  some  locations,  face  the  risk  of \npremature  failure  because  dikes  or  flood  protection  systems  have  gaps  or  inadequate \nconstruction standards. \n\n15. \nThe  summary  of  cost  escalation  and  financing  shortfall  by  province  is  shown  in \nTable A4.4.  Provinces  with  a  high  proportion  of  priority  subprojects  will  exceed  the  budget \nallocation, while those such as Quang Tri (with a high proportion of additional subprojects) will \nhave sufficient finances for their priority subprojects along with a surplus.  \n\n16.  Whereas  the  budget  allocation  provides  indicative  costs  for  additional  subprojects,  this \nhas not been undertaken in preparations for supplementary financing. The review mission found \nthat  cost  estimates  had  become  the  determinant  of  subproject  design  acting  as  a  constraint, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4             35 \n\nirrespective of site or technical needs. As such, major works were simplified and had their scope \nreduced to the level of the indicative budget. The mission discussed the need to move into a far \nmore  sustainable  form  of  subproject  design  based  on  site  investigations  and  a  design  that \nresponds to the site and technical needs, and not simply a design for spending the budget.  \n\n17. \nThe scope of the design inputs also needs to be reconsidered. The current approach of \nfocusing  on  a  site-based  response  to  damages  should  be  expanded  to  consider  the  whole \nsystem  within  which  a  site  is  located.  For  example,  the  current  approach  of  building  a  river \nembankment to protect land on one side of a river, while successful, often results in damages \ndownstream  on  the  opposite  bank.  A  proper  assessment  would  factor  these  impacts  into  the \ndesign  process.  The  designs  used  in  the  first  phase  did  not  appear  to  consider  these  factors. \nThe  requirement  of  prior  approval  of  designs  for  additional  subprojects  is  therefore  critical  to \nensure that this practice is discontinued.  \n\nC. \n\n Procedures for Contract Adjustments  \n\n18. \nThe  existing  contracts  held  by  the  individual  PPMUs  will  need  to  be  adjusted  for  price \nescalation. The procedure is in accordance with government procedure as stated in Circular No: \n9/2008TT-BXD  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Construction  on  17  April  2008,  which  has  been \nsupplemented by Circular No: 1551/BXD-KTXD dated 1 August 2008. The required approach is \nbased  on  a  single  price  escalation  factor  for  each  contract,  based  on  a  weighted  average  for \neach  cost  category  within  the total contract multiplied  by  the ratio  of  new  unit  costs to  units  in \nthe current contract.  \n\n19. \nA number of constraints need to be considered in this process. Requirements that have \ndirect impact are (i) only one adjustment is allowed per contract; (ii) future inflation is currently \nlimited  to  10%;  and  (iii)  the  process  relies  on  official  unit  prices,  which  may  vary  from  current \nmarket  prices. These factors  require the timing of  contract  adjustment  to  be  sufficiently  late  to \nenable as much actual information to be included in the adjustment while not being so late that \na  contract  stoppage  is  incurred  as  the  procedure  is  completed.  Ideally,  the  procedure  would \noccur when disbursement on the original contract approaches 80%. \n\n20. \n\nThe agreed contract adjustment procedure includes the following steps:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n \n\nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  approves  budget \nallocation plan for subproject.  \nPPMU,  contractor,  and  contract  supervisor  complete  price  escalation \ncalculation. \nProvincial  people\u2019s  committee  (PPC)  and  Department  of  Agriculture  and \nRural Development (DARD) approve contract adjustment. \nCPMU submits contract adjustment to Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nADB approves adjustment. \nPPMU  and  contractor  make  adjustment,  sign revised  contract,  and  submit  a \ncopy to ADB. \n\n21. \nCPMU will create a database of all project contracts, including the contract adjustments \nthat  can  be  included  in  project  reports,  to  ensure  that  an  up-to-date  reconciliation  of  available \nfunds is maintained. The database will be used as the basis for deciding on the use of unutilized \nfunds  for  (i)  completion  or  upgrading  of  priority  subprojects  to  a  sustainable  standard; \n(ii) completion of priority subprojects through increased technical design and/or scope to ensure \nlife,  and  protection  of  essential \nsafety  conditions  of  structures,  protection  of  human \ninfrastructure; and (iii) additional subprojects that meet the required selection criteria. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4          36 \n\nTable A4.4: Price Escalation for Priority Subprojects  \n($\u2019000) \n\nSummary of Price Adjustment  \n\nYen Bai \n\nBudget Allocation  \nTotal Bid Price \nPrice Adjustment for Current and \nFuture Inflation \nIncrease (adjusted bid) \nPrice increase (%) \n\nProvincial Project Management Unit \n\nNam \nDinh \n\n15,550  \n13,400  \n17,679  \n\nPhu \nTho \n\n3,650  \n6,156  \n7,527  \n\nHa \nGiang \n\n5,410  \n4,050  \n5,091  \n\nThanh \nHoa \n\n11,730  \n7,803  \n10,780  \n\nNghe \nAn \n\n3,980  \n3,886  \n4,749  \n\nHa Tinh \n\nQuang \nBinh \n\nQuang \nTri \n\nPhu \nYen \n\n5,070  \n3,709  \n4,874  \n\n3,030  \n3,025  \n3,896  \n\n4,930  \n3,729  \n5,075  \n\n1,640  \n1,704  \n1,972  \n\n4,580  \n5,370  \n6,987  \n\nTotal \n\n61,740  \n55,413  \n71,702  \n\n1,617  \n30 \n\n4,279  \n32 \n\n1,370  \n22 \n\n1,041  \n26 \n\n2,976  \n38 \n\n863  \n22 \n\n1,165  \n31 \n\n872  \n29 \n\n1,346  \n36 \n\n268  \n16 \n\n16,289  \n29 \n\nSource: Provincial reports to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. \n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f37 \n \n\nAppendix 5        \n\n \n\n \n\nDETAILED REVISED PROJECT COST ESTIMATES \n\nTable A5.1: Summary Revised Cost Estimates by Component  \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\n1.

ADB  approved  the  Emergency  Rehabilitation  of  Calamity  Damage  Project  on \n21 November  2006  to  (i)  reinstate  roads,  flood  protection,  irrigation  systems,  and  social \ninfrastructure in the 10 most severely affected provinces; and (ii) provide enhanced storm and \nflood  protection  to  vulnerable  areas  where  feasible.  An  ADB  project  review  mission  in  July\u2013\nAugust  2008  revealed  several  deficiencies  in  assessing  hazard  risks  and  developing \nappropriate  solutions  to  the  risks.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Hazard  Risk  Assessment \nusing  Geo-Information  Technology  will  support  the  Project  by  enhancing  the  Government's \ncapability to carry out risk and vulnerability assessments.  \n \ntheir \n2. \nconsequences lack the tools and skills needed to identify and assess vulnerable areas, and use \nthe  results  to  formulate  appropriate  development  choices  and  disaster  avoidance  strategies. \nAlthough they have some capability in the application of geographic information systems (GISs) \nand  remote  sensing,  agencies  lack  the  skills  needed  to  implement  and  maintain  up-to-date \nhazard  risk  assessments.  Recently,  the  Water  Resources  University  (WRU)  began  a  new \nprogram  on  \u201cDisaster  Management  and  Mitigation\u201d  creating  a  need  for  lecturers  to  raise  their \nskill levels in advanced hazard assessment techniques. The incorporation of modern hazard risk \nassessment tools in university curricula is clearly warranted by the susceptibility of the country \nto  natural  disasters.  The  TA  will  also  be  useful  to  professional  staff  within  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) who are involved in disaster management. Hence, \nthere is an excellent opportunity with this TA to link academic and executive agencies. \n \n3. \nIn  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004),  the  TA  will \nenhance  the  Government\u2019s  capability  to  (i)  carry  out  risk  and  vulnerability  assessments, \nincluding physical, economic, social, and environmental impacts; and (ii) mainstream prevention \nand  preparedness  activities  into  the  development  process.  The  TA  will  entail  two  main \ncomponents:  (i)  training,  and  (ii)  a  pilot  project  for  a  selected  province.  The  detail  of  the \ncomponents  will  be  clarified  in  the  TA  design  and  preparation  stage.  The  TA  will  enhance \ncapabilities to include alternative approaches, including nonstructural, to mitigate natural hazard \nrisks,  while  also  making  use  of  economic  tools  to  improve  the  planning,  design,  and \nsustainability  of  risk  mitigation  measures.  The  principle  methodology  to  be  used  under  the  TA \nwill  be  training  of  academic  staff  and  students  of  WRU  in  Ha  Noi,  as  well  as  key  staff  of the \nCentral  Committee  for  Flood  and  Storm  Control  (CCFSC)  and  the  Department  of  Dike \nManagement,  Flood  and  Storm  Control  (DDMFSC).  Participants  will  be  trained  to  apply  geo-\ninformation  technology  for  hazard  risk  assessment  (specifically  those  hazards  associated  with \nwater-related  natural  disasters)  in selected  case  study  areas.  Capacity  to  apply  this  technique \nwill  be  built  through  interactive  courses.  Training  modules  will  be  developed  for  incorporation \ninto an elective master\u2019s degree course at WRU.   \n\n                                                \n1   The Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC) was established in 1990 under the leadership of the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), with supporting provincial and district committees. CCFSC \nhelps  the  Government  prepare  for,  respond  to,  and  overcome  natural  disasters  and  their  consequences.  It \ncoordinates emergency response, and has a role in the recovery and reconstruction after disasters. CCFSC works \nin  close  liaison  with  MARD\u2019s  Department  of  Dike  Management,  Flood  and  Storm  Control  (DDMFSC),  which \nencompasses the Disaster Management Center. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8       41 \n\nThe outputs of the TA will be (i) improved knowledge base of different types of natural \n4. \ndisasters, inventory of at-risk facilities, and hazard maps in selected areas; (ii) improved ability \nto  use  a  computer-based  GIS  to  assess  hazard  risks  and  prepare  visual  presentations  of \nvulnerability,  including  the  capability  to  assess  and  present  risk  and  vulnerability  in  economic, \nsocial, and physical terms; (iii) capability built within the relevant disaster management agencies \nto operate and maintain the database and decision-making tools; and (iv) capacity built among \nfaculty staff of WRU to use the training materials prepared under the TA. Training under the TA \nwill  target  staff  of  (i)  CCFSC;  (ii)  DDMFSC  in  MARD  and  from  provincial  offices;  and  (iii)  the \nremote sensing and GIS lab of WRU\u2019s Hydrological and Environmental Faculty. To encourage \nsustainability of project outputs, a working relationship with an international university should be \nestablished. \n \nThe TA is structured in three phases: (i) identification, (ii) design and preparation, and \n5. \n(iii) training implementation. The identification phase will (i) carry out an institutional analysis of \nthe relevant disaster management organizations to assess their capacity and ability to allocate \nkey  staff  for  training;  and  (ii)  conduct  a  training  needs  analysis  as  the  basis  for  designing \ntraining  courses  and  to  identify  suitable  trainees,  especially  drawn  from  the  international  and \nnational  consultants.  Trainees  may  come  from  related  agencies  at  central  level  and  provincial \nlevel,  especially  provinces  under  the  Emergency  Rehabilitation  of  Calamity  Damage  Project. \nThe  design  and  preparation  phase  will  (i)  design  training  courses  and  develop  manuals  for \nhazard risk assessment, (ii) prepare training materials and exercises, (iii) develop a pilot study \nto  be  used  for  project-based  learning  during  the  TA,  and  (iv)  collect  data  and  prepare  it  in  a \nformat  suitable for formal  courses  in  risk management. The training  implementation  phase  will \n(i) train selected staff in hazard risk assessment using GIS and remote sensing; (ii) demonstrate \nthe  application  of  GIS  and  remote  sensing  for  hazard  risk  assessment  in  the  selected  case \nstudy  area  in  Viet  Nam;  (iii)  conduct  a  workshop  using  course  participants  as  mediators  to \ntransfer the fundamentals of the methodology to colleagues, managers, and decision makers of \nrelevant organizations; (iv) develop a web-based training package (in digital and hard versions) \nfor information dissemination to other stakeholders; and (v) after the end of the project, organize \na donor coordination workshop to assess the outcome of the TA and expand the scope (e.g., to \nmore provinces). It is important that the case study emphasize the development of capacity to \nanalyze  and  interpret  modeling  results  for  the  development  of  effective  hazard  mitigation \nmeasures.  The  trainees  will  present  their  newly  acquired  knowledge  and  working  ability  in \nhazard risk assessment.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nYen Bai province is tentatively proposed to be the case study. It is located in the area \nbetween the highlands and midlands east of Hoang Lien mountains. The Red River (the biggest \nriver  in  the  northern  Viet  Nam)  flows  through  the  province,  dividing it into lowlands  and  mid-\nrange mountains on the left (northern) bank and hills and mountainous terrain on the other side. \nThe town of Yen Bai has about 78,000 inhabitants according to the 2004 census. Yen Bai town \nis  experiencing  rapid  growth,  which  is  expected  to  continue  until  2020  because  of  the \nconstruction of an international highway to the People\u2019s Republic of China. Industry is relatively \nsmall  and  agricultural  food  production  in  the  area  can  be  characterized  by  small  farms  with  a \nlow level of mechanization.  \n \n7. \nThe selected study area includes most of the town and is a watershed with an area of \nabout 140 square kilometers (km2). The streams Hien Duong, Au Lau, Yen Ninh, Yen Thinh and \nDai Dong flow through the town into the Red River. Although the discharge of these streams is \ngenerally low (less than 1 cubic meter per second), they are prone to flashfloods that can cause \n\nYen Bai Province as a Case Study \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nsignificant  damage  and  create  problems  for  local  people.  The  area is  also  affected  by \nlandslides,  especially  during  the  rainy  season.  Slopes  are  often  modified  by  human  activities, \nsuch as road and house construction; and are often steeply cut, making them more susceptible \nto future instability.  \n \n8. \nIn 2005 and 2006, two successive rainstorms hit Yen Bai, which caused the worst flash \nfloods and landslides of the last 40 years. The flash flood after torrential rain on 27 September \n2005  induced  a  number  of  small  landslides,  causing  76  deaths  and  an  economic  loss  of \nD350 billion (CCFSC). The prolonged rainfall on 19 August 2006 was less serious, but killed 9 \npeople  and  caused  an  estimated  loss  of  more than  D25  billion  (CCFSC).2 These  events  show \nthe  urgency  of  addressing  the  problems  of  landslides  and  flash  floods  in  Yen  Bai.  The  town \nneeds to increase its capacity in geo-hazard assessment and requires additional tools to include \nthese  hazards  in  the  urban  planning  process.  This  makes  Yen  Bai  town  an  ideal  pilot  study \nlocation for hazard risk assessment. \n \n9. \nYen Bai province is also suitable for the case study as it has many important databases \nneeded to carry out a pilot study. It appears that necessary digitized maps are available, such \nas  base  maps  (including  contour  lines,  stream  and  river  system,  administration  boundaries, \nannotations);  geological  maps;  hydrological  maps;  geomorphology  maps  (including  geological, \ngeo-morphological units); and soil maps. However, it should be confirmed that maps are freely \navailable for the project prior to finalizing the case study province choice. Additionally, there is a \nremote sensing database, including LandSat enhanced thematic mapper and thematic mapper \nfrom  1990  to  2001,  2005,  2007;  and  hard  copies  of  aerial  photographs  scaled  1:33,000  with \nvarious  time  scales.  Finally,  a  flood  database  is  available,  including  precipitation  records  from \nthe 1960s to present and discharge records in digital format at Yen Bai Provincial Department of \nNatural  Resources  and  Environment;  and  historical  flood  maps  in  digital  and  hard  copy,  and \nflood loss and damage records\u2014both available at DDMFSC. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe Executing Agency for the TA will be MARD. WRU will be the implementing agency \nin cooperation with Disaster Management Center under DDMSFC. WRU is suitably equipped to \nbe  an  implementing  agency  for  this  TA. WRU  maintains  more  than  100  computers  with  high-\nspeed  local  area  network  connection  at  the  Center  of  Informatics.  WRU  has  capabilities  in \nremote  sensing  and  a  laboratory.  WRU  maintains  required  capabilities,  including  GIS  and \nremote sensing software; database (e.g., digital base maps, satellite images, aerial photos); and \nother  facilities  (e.g.,  handheld  global  positioning  system,  stereoscope).  WRU  may  need  to \nupgrade its computers out of the university budget prior to initiation of the project. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  technical  assistance  is  estimated  at  $625,000,  out  of  which  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  will  provide  a  grant  of  $500,000 \nequivalent  to  be  administered  by  ADB,  while  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  will  contribute \n$125,000, largely in kind, for office accommodation and transport, costs of counterpart staff, and \nother items.  \n \n\nManagement Arrangements \n\nCost and Financing \n\n                                                \n2    2005  &  2006.

In particular, \nincreasing costs, price inflation, and implementation delays can have a significant impact on the \neconomic  viability  and  financial  feasibility  of  the  subprojects.  This  appendix  reexamines  the \neconomic viability and financial feasibility of the subprojects. \n \n2. \nSince  the  Project  was  originally  designed  in  2005,  Viet  Nam  has  experienced  a \nsignificant  increase  in  inflation\u2014causing  project  costs  to  rise  dramatically.  According  to  the \nGeneral  Statistics  Office  of  Viet  Nam,  the  overall  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  rate  reached \n27.2% year on year for June 2008. Compared with 2005, inflation as measured by the CPI has \nrisen  43.57%.  However,  CPI  increases  have  not  been  even  across  all  sectors.  Table  A9.1 \nshows that the change in the CPI for food, 208% since 2005, has greatly outpaced increases in \nthe price for housing and construction materials, which was 146% during the same period.  \n \n\nTable A9.1:  Consumer Price Index\u2014Rural Areas in Viet Nam (June 2008) \n\nIndex in the \nfirst half \nyear in 2008 \ncompared \nwith same \nperiod in \n2007 \n120.36 \n\nIndex in June 2008 compared with (%) \n\nBase year \n2005 \n143.57 \n\nJune \n2007 \n127.22 \n\nDecember \n2007 \n119.01 \n\nMay 2008 \n102.10 \n\n168.73 \n\n145.81 \n\n131.25 \n\n103.23 \n\n132.96 \n\n207.80 \n\n171.25 \n\n157.22 \n\n104.48 \n\n137.74 \n\nItem \nConsumer price index \n\nFood and foodstuff \n\nOf which: Food  \n\nHousing and construction materials a \n\n145.64 \n\n125.29 \n\n115.97 \n\n101.58 \n\n121.18 \n\na Including housing, electricity, water, fuel and construction materials. \nSource: General Statistics Office of Viet Nam. http://www.gso.gov.vn/ \n \n3. \nThese relative changes in the prices have a direct impact on the economic viability of a \nsubproject. The changes may be neutral or even beneficial, e.g., if inflation in project benefits is \ngreater than increases in project costs, economic viability will improve. However, if project costs \nare  rising  faster  than  the  value  of  benefits,  then  the  economic  viability  of  the  subproject  will \nworsen.  For  many  subprojects,  benefits  were  calculated  as  an  increase  in  the  net  value  of \nagricultural production. Table A9.1 shows that rural food prices have far outstripped inflation in \nrural construction costs over the last year and since 2005. Assuming that inflation in food prices \nhas  kept  pace  with  increases  in  the  price  of  farm  inputs,  this  would  indicate  that,  in  general, \nsubproject economic viability has been maintained or improved based on the original analytical \napproach. Unfortunately, analysis of the impact of inflation on farm inputs and outputs, and thus \nnet  production  value,  was  not  possible  during  the  mission.  Thus,  benefits  were  maintained \nduring the reexamination of subproject viability. \n \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Emergency Rehabilitation of Calamity Damage Project. Manila (Loan 2273). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9       47 \n\nThere  are  four  types  of  subprojects  under  the  loan:  (i)  irrigation,  (ii)  roads,  (iii)  flood \n4. \nprotection,  and  (iv)  social  projects.  Each  type  of  subproject  has  a  unique  set  of  economic \nbenefits,  which  are  discussed  below.  The  primary  benefit  of  irrigation  projects  is  increased \nagricultural  production,  which  is  measured  as  the  incremental  increase  in  net  farm  income  for \nthe  project  area.  These  are  the  benefits  most  often  used  in  analysis  of  economic  viability. \nSecondary  benefits  of  irrigation  projects  can  include  improved  drainage  function  (reduced  or \navoided  flood  damage)  and  multiple  use  benefits,  such  as  water  for  cleaning  and  drinking. \nQuantifying secondary benefits is difficult and not normally done. \n \n5. \nThe  primary  economic  benefit  of  road  projects  is  reduced  travel  costs  found  through \nreduced fuel consumption and travel time. Typically, a survey is made of existing travel volumes \non  the  target  road  and  projections  are  made  of  future  travel  volumes.  Fuel  consumption  and \ntravel times are estimated and monetized. The estimated difference in the value of travel costs \nis then taken as the project benefit. The process of developing the necessary data can be quite \ncostly and time-consuming. Viet Nam faces an additional problem, as the transportation profile \nis  changing  rapidly,  both  in  mode  and  volume.  In  general,  the  subproject  feasibility  studies \ncalculated  economic  benefits  based  on  projected  cost  reductions  from  improved  road  quality, \nincreased traffic volume, and changes in transportation mode. \n \n6. \nThe  primary  economic  benefit  of  flood  protection  projects  (i.e.,  sea  dikes  and  river \nembankments)  is  the  value  of  expected  damage  avoided.  Typically,  three  components  are \nnecessary  to  make  this  calculation:  (i)  probability  of  a  flood  event  occurring,  (ii)  probability  of \ndike  failure,  and  (iii)  a  damage  function  based  on  the  magnitude  of  the  flood  event.  When \nestimating benefits of flood protection projects, it is critical that negative impacts arising from the \naltered hydrologic processes are included as a negative benefit. The data requirements for such \nestimates  are  quite  intensive  and  include  a  non-negligible  amount  of  uncertainty.  In  the \nexamined subproject feasibility studies, either no attempt is made to estimate economic benefits \nor  benefits  are  estimated  as  changes  in  production  values  as  projected  by  the  local \nsocioeconomic development plan\u2014the assumption being that protection from flood damage will \nallow  the  area  to  pursue  economic  development  strategies  successfully.  While  this  approach \nhas  some  legitimacy,  it  does  not  accurately  assess  the  reduction  in  vulnerability,  which  is  the \nmain objective of a flood protection project. \n \n7. \nThe primary economic benefit of social projects is less direct, but can include the value \nfrom achieving a higher education level, improved health care, and more active markets. While \nit  is  possible  to  quantify  these  benefits,  given  the  focus  on  social  benefits  and  the  emergency \nnature  of  the  subprojects,  it  is  likely  not  worthwhile  to  pursue  an  attempt  to  quantify  these \nbenefits for economic analysis.  \n \n8. \nMaintaining the financial feasibility of the subprojects is also an issue of concern. None \nof  the  47  subprojects  has  a  revenue  flow,  so  financial  feasibility  will  not  exist  for  any  of  the \nsubprojects.  Instead,  subproject  sustainability  is  emphasized  with  a  focus  on  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) budgets that are sufficient to maintain the benefit stream throughout the life \nof the Project. In general, responsibility for O&M is contracted after completion of construction. \nThe regular maintenance budget is calculated according to government regulation in line with a \nnorm (percentage of total capital costs) for (i) length of road, (ii) irrigated area, or (iii) length of \ndike or embankment. There is also a standardized norm for recurring repair, which increases in \npercentage  by  year.  If  maintenance  contracts  are  concluded  after  completion  of  subproject \nconstruction, then costs can be adjusted accordingly.  \n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9        \n\nThe process for budgeting for O&M is to set a standardized amount according to total \n9. \nconstruction costs. The district or provincial government holds responsibility for covering these \nregular  maintenance  costs  out  of  its  general  budget.  In  the  case  of  repairs,  the  managing \nagency makes  a  budget  request  to the responsible  district  or  provincial  level  entity.  Interviews \nwith  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (DARD),  provincial  project \nmanagement unit (PPMU), and local consultants during the mission presented mixed results as \nto the adequacy of this process in meeting actual O&M needs. Experience in past and ongoing \ninfrastructure programs clearly indicates that O&M expenditure is generally well below the level \nrequired to sustain the capital investment. \n \n10. \nIt  is  crucial  that  the  issue  of  O&M  budget  adequacy  is  resolved,  as  insufficient  O&M \nbudgets will result in a failure to maintain projected subproject benefit streams. This will reduce \nand  possibly  undermine  the  economic  viability  of  a  subproject.  However,  even  if  adequate \ninitially,  there  appears  to  be  no  automatic  inflation  adjustment  so  that  O&M  budgets  suffer  a \nregular decline in real terms. \n \nDuring  the  mission,  numerous  subprojects  were  reviewed  and  it  was  found  that  the \n11. \neconomic  methodology  across  different  subprojects  was  essentially  the  same.  Additionally, \nspreadsheets  containing  the  economic  analysis  were  requested  from  each  PPMU  and  DARD. \nHowever,  very  few  of  these  were  obtained.  Four  subprojects  were  selected  to  reassess  the \neconomic  viability  under  the  new  cost  revisions,  including  three  sea  dikes  and  one  road.2 The \nassessments are presented below (paragraphs 12\u201315). The reassessment uses the perspective \nof  the  subproject  being  designed  by  comparing  two  scenarios  for  capital  costs:  (i)  with  the \nexpected capital cost at the time of design; and (ii) with inflated investment costs as at the time \nof processing the supplementary financing, but not considering the investment already incurred \nas  sunk  costs,  which  would  substantially  increase  the  subproject  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR). \n \nThe  Hai  Thanh  sea  dike  subproject  in  Thanh  Hoa  Province  was  used  to  test  the \n12. \neconomic viability with updated cost estimates. The feasibility study gives an EIRR of 18.33%, \nwhere 50% of full annual project benefits are realized during the second year of construction. To \nupdate the economic viability, several adjustments were made. Project life is assumed to equal \n30  years.  First,  the  updated  cost  figures  give  a  longer  project  construction  period  with  higher \ncosts, so realization of full project benefits is delayed by 2  years. Second, project benefits are \nassumed to begin being realized in the second year, increasing with each year of construction, \nand are estimated as a percentage of eventual full subproject benefits. Third, project O&M costs \nare increased in accordance with 1.5% of increased construction costs. Lastly, additional costs \nare  included  for  repairs  at  5-year  intervals  and  equal  to  1%  of  construction  costs  per  year  of \nproject life (e.g., 5% in year 5, 10% in year 10). This is a fairly standard method for estimating \nrepair budgets in Viet Nam. The updated economic viability for the Hai Thanh sea dike, with the \nrevised  costs,  was  calculated  as  16.15%.  The  impact  of  inflation  is  that  maintenance  costs \nwould need to rise 14 percentage points more than the rate for benefits on an annual basis to \nreduce the EIRR below 12%. Such a high rate of inflation is unlikely to persist for such a lengthy \nperiod. Finally, if the O&M budget is inadequate, project benefits would need to decline at a rate \nof 4% per year to push the EIRR below 12%.  \n \n13. \nThe  feasibility  study  for  the  Xuan  Quy\u2013Thanh  Quan  Road  in  Thanh  Hoa  Province \nreported  an  EIRR  of  18.04%  based  on  original  assumptions.  The  figures  in  the  spreadsheet, \n\n                                                \n2   Interviews with DARD staff indicate that, for flood embankment subprojects, few were assessed from an economic \n\nfeasibility perspective because of the complexity of analysis and lack of available data.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9       49 \n\nhowever, yield an EIRR of 18.58%. The EIRR of 18.58% will be used here as the baseline for \ncomparison.  O&M  estimates  include  a  budget  for  regular  maintenance  and  for  larger  repairs \nequal  to  5%  of  subproject  costs  in  year  5  and  20%  in  year  10.  The  year  5  and  year  10  O&M \ncosts  are  then  repeated  at  year  15  and  year  20.  The  project  life  is  assumed  to  be  20  years. \nConstruction  is  assumed  to  be  completed  in  1  year  and  project  benefits start  to  be  realized  in \nthe second year. For the revision, the project time line is extended by 3 years to account for the \nlonger construction period, but still maintaining the original 19-year benefit stream. O&M costs \nwere increased in accordance with the higher cost estimates. Benefits were increased by 25%, \nwhich is about the year-on-year inflation rate for rural housing and construction costs (including \nfuel)  as  reported  for  June  2008  by  the  General  Statistics  Office  of  Viet  Nam.  The  updated \neconomic  viability  for  the  Xuan  Quy  Thanh  Quan  Road,  with  the  revised  cost  figures,  was \ncalculated as 14.86%. If O&M is inadequate to maintain project benefits, a 3% annual decrease \nin benefits will push the calculated EIRR below 12%. \n \n14. \nThe feasibility study for the Giao Thuy sea dike in Nam Dinh Province reports an EIRR \nof 20.28%. Construction is spread over 3 years and the project life is considered as 25 years. \nBenefits  are  calculated  as  increases  in  agricultural  production  in  the  protected  area  and  are \nadjusted for changes in input use. The feasibility study reports that benefits include production \nincreases  in  agriculture,  aquaculture,  and  salt;  as  well  as  reductions  in  storm  damage  and \nmaintenance  costs.  Annual  expected  damage  avoided  is  equated  to  5%  of  total  damages \ncaused  by  the  2005  storm  event.  The  5%  is  based  on  the  presumed  frequency  of  the  storm \nevent.  The  economic  viability  was  recalculated  based  on  the  revised  cost  estimates.  The \nconstruction  period  is  extended  by  1  year.  O&M  costs  are  revised  according  to  a  specified \npercentage  of  the  revised  costs.  Inflation  affects  both  inputs  and  outputs  for  agriculture  and \naquaculture,  but  it  was  not  possible  to  estimate  the  recent  net  affect.  Therefore,  the  value  of \nsubproject benefits was retained as originally presented. The updated economic viability for the \nGiao Thuy sea dike, with the revised cost figures, was calculated as 20.17%. Improvements in \nviability  from  reduced  costs  are  offset  by  the  extended  construction  period.  Inflation  of \nmaintenance  costs  would  need  to  outpace  inflation  on  the  benefits  side  by  12.5  percentage \npoints  to  push  the  subproject  EIRR  below  12%.  If  the  O&M  budget  is  inadequate  to  maintain \nsubproject benefits, it would take an annual decline of 5% of benefits to cause the subproject to \nfail the economic viability test. \n \n15. \nThe feasibility study for the Hai Hau sea dike in Nam Dinh Province reports an EIRR of \n15.63%.  The  spreadsheet  reported  an  EIRR  of  16.78%  and  the  summary  investment  report \nannex gives an EIRR of 15.67% (although the numbers in the accompanying table actually yield \nan  EIRR  of  15.54%).  For  purposes  of  recalculating  the  economic  viability  with  revised  cost \nestimates,  the  project  costs  and  benefits  included  in  the  spreadsheet  will  be  used.  In  the \nHai Hau  sea  dike  case,  project  benefits  are  limited  to  increases  in  agriculture.  As  it  is  not \npossible to discern a net impact on agricultural production value caused by inflationary forces, \nthe original benefit estimates are retained here. The updated economic viability for the Hai Hau \nsea dike, with the revised cost figures, was calculated as 11.40%. It must be stressed that the \nfull range of benefits was not included in the calculations presented in the feasibility study, and \nthe  EIRR  is  likely  higher  than  11.40%.  Impacts  of  inflation  on  cost  and  inadequate  O&M  on \nbenefits were not calculated as the revised estimate is already below the 12% viability mark.   \n \n16. \nFour  subprojects  were  used  to  recalculate  EIRR  values  and  are  summarized  in \nTable A9.2. All but one subproject retains its economic viability using the revised cost estimates. \nThe reassessment provided here takes the analyses provided in the feasibility studies as given, \nand  only  corrects  some  errors  without  altering  the  general  approach.  In  some  case,  the  O&M \nbudgets were increased to account for the need to make repairs greater than those covered by \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 9        \n\na  regular  maintenance  budget.  Sufficient  O&M  budgets  are  critical  for  the  sustainability  of \nproject  benefits  and  maintenance  of  project  economic  viability.  Moreover,  the  presence  of \nsufficient O&M budgets can be considered as a proxy test for financial feasibility. Most projects \naccount  for  regular  maintenance  costs  and  a  larger  repair  budget.  These  O&M  budgets  were \ncalculated according to government regulations. Most interviews during the mission stated that \nthe reported O&M budgets would be sufficient to cover actual maintenance needs, but it is not \npossible to verify whether this is correct. \n \n\nTable A9.2: Revised EIRRs for Selected Subprojects Using Inflated Cost Estimates \n(%) \n\n \n\nEIRR \n\n \n\nSensitivity \n\nSubproject \n\nOriginal \n\nThanh Hoa\u2013Hai Thanh \n\nSea Dike \n\nThanh Hoa\u2013Xuan Quy\u2013 \nThanh Quan Road \nNam Dinh\u2013Hai Hau Sea \n\nDike \n\nNam Dinh\u2013Giao Thuy \n\nSea Dike \n\n18.33 \n\n18.58 \n\n16.78 \n\n20.28 \n\nWith \nRevised \nCosts \n\n15.15 \n\n14.86 \n\n11.40 \n\n20.17 \n\nCost inflation to \npush EIRR \nbelow 12% \nassuming \nbenefits have \n0% inflation \n14.0 \n\nAnnual decline \nin benefits due \nto inadequate \nO&M to push \nEIRR below \n12% \n4.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n12.5 \n\n3.0 \n\n \n\n5.0 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; O&M = operations and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 7 November 2008) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "\u2013 \n", "dong (D) \n", "D1.00 \n$1.00 \n \n", "= \n= \n \n", "$0.000594 \nD16,838 \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nCCFSC \nCPI \nCPMU \nDARD \nDDMFSC \nEIRR \nFDI \nGDP \nGIS \nICB \nIEE \nIPDF \nMARD \nNCB \nO&M \nPPC \nPPMU \nRRP \nSDR \nSOE \nTA \nWRU \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nCentral Committee for Flood and Storm Control \nconsumer price index \nCentral Project Management Unit \nDepartment of Agriculture and Rural Development \nDepartment of Dike Management, Flood and Storm Control \neconomic internal rate of return \nforeign direct investment \ngross domestic product \ngeographic information system \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nindigenous peoples development framework \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development \nnational competitive bidding \noperation and maintenance \nprovincial people\u2019s committee \nprovincial project management unit \nreport and recommendation of the President \nspecial drawing rights \nstate-owned enterprise \ntechnical assistance \nWater Resources University \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \nVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", "Country Director \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n", "C.
