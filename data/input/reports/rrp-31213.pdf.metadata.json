There will be no involuntary resettlement effects. \nResettlement \n   \nIndigenous  Category C. No adverse impact. \nPeoples \n   \nRationale  The SEDP is required to support ongoing national efforts to promote \neconomic growth and reduce poverty through education. In particular, it \nwill address the need to build on reforms and activities commenced \nunder the Asian Development Bank (ADB) financed Education Sector \nDevelopment Program (ESDP) to increase access to quality primary and \nsecondary  education,  especially  in  rural  areas  and  in  poorer  urban \ncommunities. It will also continue ESDP activities for improving efficiency \nin  the  sector,  including  support  for  greater  institutional  and  financial \nstability.  The  SEDP  will  support  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals for Mongolia, and the social capital development \nobjectives under the Poverty Partnership Agreement between ADB and \nMongolia. \n \nObjectives and  The  main  objective  of  the  SEDP  is  to  promote  human  development \nScope  through  universal  access  to  education.  Its  secondary  objective  is  to \nreduce income and deprivation poverty by improving access to quality \npreschool and basic education in poorer rural and urban communities. \nSpecific  objectives  will  include  (i)  improving  access  to  services \n(kindergartens and schools), including for children with disabilities; (ii) \nimproving the quality and relevance of education services; (iii) improving \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of education management;  and  (iv) \nenhancing  the   efficiency   of  public  resource  allocation  for  education ", "    iii   \n  by  reducing  recurrent  financing  requirements  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  education  facilities,  expanding  the  textbook  rental \nscheme, and improving accountability in education management. \n \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is $68.5 million equivalent, of which $43.2 million \nequivalent is the foreign exchange cost and $25.3 million equivalent the \nlocal currency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a loan of SDR 10.806 million ($14 million equivalent). \nThe Government of Japan will provide grant financing of $45 million \nequivalent,  and  the  Nordic  Development  Fund  (NDF)  will  provide  a \nconcessional loan of $4.8 million equivalent. The balance of $4.7 million \nequivalent will be provided by the Government. The ADB loan will include \nfinancing of the interest charge. \n   \nLoan Amount and  The  proposed  ADB  loan  is  for  SDR  10.806  million  ($14  million \nTerms  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a \nmaturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. Interest will be \ncharged at 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \nThe Borrower will be Mongolia. \n   \nPeriod of  30 June 2008. \nUtilization \n   \nExecuting Agency  MOECS \n   \nImplementation  MOECS will be the Executing Agency, with primary responsibility for \nArrangements  overall planning and coordination of SEDP activities, for implementing \nADB  and  NDF-financed  SEDP  activities,  and  executing  agency \nresponsibilities for the urban school development activities to be financed \nby the Government of Japan. The deputy minister, MOECS will be the \nproject director, with responsibility for providing the policy and strategic \ndirection for ADB and NDF-financed activities. School boards will also be \nconsulted in planning SEDP activities in schools. A multisectoral steering \ncommittee has also been established to provide policy guidance and to \noversee  implementation  of  the  ADB  and  NDF-financed  activities.  A \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  has  been  established  to  support \nMOECS in achieving SEDP objectives. The PMU is headed by a project \nmanager who will be responsible for day-to-day implementation of ADB \nand NDF-financed SEDP activities. ADB and the PMU will coordinate \nwith the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Mongolia office \nduring  implementation  to  ensure  coordination  among  the  respective \nSEDP components.  \n \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed from the ADB  loan proceeds will be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nProcurement under the Japanese and NDF parallel cofinanced activities \nwill be carried out in accordance with their respective procedures. \n   ", "    iv   \nConsulting  ADB will finance 21 person-months of international consulting services \nServices  and 459 person-months of domestic consulting services. International \nand domestic consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants \nsatisfactory to ADB. Advance action will be taken to select ADB-financed \nconsultants to facilitate the start-up arrangements for the SEDP. NDF will \nfinance 19 person months of international consulting services and 284 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services, in accordance with its \nown procedures on the recruitment of consultants.

The SEDP\u2019s support \nfor improved facilities planning and management\u2013-including maintenance  \n\u2013-is  also  expected  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  reducing  capital \nexpenditures for repairs and construction of facilities in the medium to \nlong term. \n \n   ", " \n ", "  \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Second Education Development Project. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  In 1999, the Government of Mongolia asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nsupport  a  second  education  development  project  (SEDP)  as  a  follow-up  to  the  ongoing \nEducation  Sector  Development  Program  (ESDP).1  ADB  subsequently  approved  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA)2 for the proposed SEDP. Following the submission of the \nconsultant report in February 2001, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) \nprovided funding for a feasibility study3 to refine selected aspects of the proposal. The SEDP is \nincluded in the 2001 country strategy and program update as a firm project loan of $14 million \nequivalent for 2002 and is classified as an intervention focusing on the promotion of human \ndevelopment. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Sector Description: Preschool, Primary, and Secondary Education \n1.  Sector Overview \n3.  Education was one of the country\u2019s principal achievements in the socialist era. As part of \nthe Government\u2019s goal to eliminate illiteracy and to achieve universal education to grade 8 \nbefore 1940, modern school and dormitory facilities were established in all soum (district) \ncenters, allowing all children, including those from remote nomadic families, to obtain a basic \neducation.  The  results  were  impressive.  Gross  enrolment  rates  (GER)4  in  primary  and \nsecondary education reached 99% by 1990, a remarkable achievement given the country\u2019s \ngeographic and sociocultural (i.e. nomadic) characteristics. This is evidenced by very high \nliteracy rates, which stood in 2000 at 98% of the total population aged over 15, with only minor \ndifferences  between  urban  and  rural  areas.  Notable  also  is  the  equality  of  educational \nparticipation and achievement among Mongolia\u2019s over 16 recognized clans (para. 79) and \nethnic groups. In addition, by 1990 a network of over 900 kindergartens had been established \nproviding  places  for  over  97,000  children  and  playing  a  vital  role  in  allowing  women  to \nparticipate freely in the labor force. \n \n4.  The decline of the state economy in the 1990s impacted negatively on the education \nsystem,  particularly  in  the  early  transition  years  and  especially  in  rural  Mongolia.  State \neducation expenditures were massively reduced. Without finance for essential maintenance and \nrepairs, school facilities deteriorated and many were forced to close. Preschools were worst \naffected  with  244  kindergartens  closing  between  1990  and  2001.  Availability  of  learning \nmaterials dwindled and teachers\u2019 real salaries eroded markedly. By 1996, the GER had fallen to \n82% and dropouts5 rose by 2,300% between school years (SYs) 1988/89 and 1992/93.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Loan 1507/1508-MON: Education Sector Development Program, approved 19 December 1996 for $15.15 million.  \n2  TA 3351-MON: Second Education Development Project, approved  20 December 1999 for $0.55 million. \n3   CIDA Mongolia School Rehabilitation and Construction Feasibility Study, 2002 \n4  Enrolment in primary and secondary schools divided by the school age population (8-15 years). \n5  Defined by MOECS as a pupil who has missed a year of school.  ", "  2   \n5.  Education indicators have, however, improved markedly in recent years. Wide-ranging \nreforms to focus state resources have allowed real funding of primary and secondary education \nto increase. Significant levels of private financing for education was mobilized with 38 private \nschools operating alongside state schools by 2001, and cost recovery measures, including \ntextbook rentals, helped to supplement overstretched public budgets. In addition, a program of \nconsolidation of the extensive education infrastructure under the ESDP\u2013-including merging and \nclosing of schools as well as staff reductions\u2013-improved the efficiency and affordability of the \nsector  and  freed  resources  for  increasing  financing  for  essential  items,  such  as  teachers\u2019 \nsalaries,6 which helped to maintain educational quality. By SY1999/2000, the national GER in \nprimary and secondary education had risen to over 90% again. Improvements in rural areas \nhave, however, lagged behind. In 203 of the total 342 districts, the GER was lower than 80%.7 \nProgress in restoring access to preschool education was also remarkable with over 83,000 \nchildren enrolled in kindergartens in 2001, a substantial increase from 1995, when only 64,100 \nchildren were enrolled. \n \n2.  Structure and Participation  \n6.  Formal  education  in  Mongolia  commences  with  up  to  4  years  of  noncompulsory \npreschool education, which comprises kindergarten and nursery school, and provides a solid \neducational foundation for primary school. Most children enter primary education at the age of \neight. This stage lasts for 4 years and is followed by 4 years of lower secondary education. \nPrimary and secondary education are seen as a whole and together comprise compulsory or \nbasic education. This stage is then followed by 2 years of upper secondary education, which is \na prerequisite for university admission. The structure of the education system is in Appendix 2. \nIn April 2002, the Law on Education was amended to provide for 5 years of primary education; it  \nwill be implemented progressively from 2002 to 2005. \n \n7.  Before 1990, enrolment in preschool education was compulsory. In the early transition \nyears,  enrolment  rates  in  kindergartens  fell  from  97,200  in  SY1990/91  to  just  64,100  in \nSY1995/96. Since that time, however, enrolment has been rising steadily and stood at 78,630 in \nSY1999/2000 in a total of 650 kindergartens. However, enrolment rates in nursery schools are \nstill well below levels seen prior to the transition as a result of the dissolution of many of the \nenterprises to which they were attached. Whereas 21,600 children were enrolled in formal \nnursery schools in SY1990/1991, this figure had fallen to just 1,600 in SY1998/99, with few \nnursery schools remaining in rural areas: the number of such institutions fell from 441 to a mere \n34. The relatively high cost of preschool education prevents many children from participating; \nannual costs exclusive of clothing amount to approximately $55 equivalent per child,8 which is \nbeyond the abilities of poor families. Government policy is to restore services by supporting the \nestablishment of private-sector institutions. The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science \n(MOECS) estimates that today only 28% of primary school pupils have received a preschool \neducation. With higher dropout rates linked to nonparticipation in preschool education, restoring \nservices is a vital task. \n \n8.  In SY1999/2000, 470,038 pupils were enrolled in 668 primary and secondary schools. Of \nthese schools, 128 offered only primary education, 216 offered combined primary and lower \nsecondary  education,  with  the  remaining  324  offering  the  full  10  grades  of  primary  and \nsecondary education. As with preschool education, enrolment rates dropped sharply after 1990, \n                                                 \n6  School teachers today typically earn over $100 monthly, well above the average for Asian transition countries. \n7  School attendance varies widely by region: the lowest rate of 36.3% is in Uvurhangai, while Selenge records 49%. \nIn urban areas, figures are 58% in Ulaanbaatar, 56.3% in Orkhon, and 55.8 % in Darhan-Uul. \n8  Comprising 50% contribution to food costs and learning material costs. ", "  3   \nfalling from a total of 446,665 pupils in SY1989/90 to a trough of 370,302 in SY1993/94 before \nrecovering. In 1999, the GER stood at 103.8%9 for grades 1 to 4, 76.8% for grades 5 to 8, and \n34.1%  for  grades  9  to  10.  However,  widening  gender  disparities  are  widening,  with  boys \naccounting for only 40% of enrolment in upper secondary education.10 \n \n  3.  Educational Infrastructure \n \n9.  A  major  constraint  to  increasing  the  GER\u2013-and  education  quality\u2013-is  the  capacity \nlimitation of school facilities, many of which have deteriorated markedly in the transition period. \nThe problem has been particularly acute in rural provinces where resources for maintenance \nand rehabilitation, as well as technical expertise, are scarce. Mongolia has 511 rural schools \ncomprising of over 800 buildings, including teaching facilities, dormitories, and heating plants. \nOf these, 409 schools and 278 dormitories across rural Mongolia have been prioritized for \nsignificant repair work by MOECS. MOECS and CIDA estimate that about 30% of these schools \nare in danger of collapse if rehabilitation work is not undertaken within the next 2 years. \n \n10.  Large-scale internal migration into urban centers has also greatly tested the capacity of \nschools in areas witnessing high population inflows.11 With most of the 189 urban schools \noperating on a three-shift basis, assistance is urgently need to maintain and develop capacity to \nprovide educational services for migrant children. This will require expansion of existing facilities \nas well as construction of new schools in districts that have grown most rapidly. \n \n11.  Building construction and technology is based on 30-year old construction standards that \nare inefficient in terms of use of materials, structural capacity and energy performance.12 This \nsystem is based on prescriptive rules and codes, rather than on a more appropriate centralized \nresearch and decentralized performance evaluation basis. Particular weaknesses of Mongolian \nschools are the preponderance of flat roofs (especially prone to leakage), the high propensity of \nwalls for moisture and water intake, and poor heating systems. Insulation in schools is usually \nminimal, causing huge heat losses and extremely high heating costs. Despite this, MOECS\u2019s \ntraditional approaches to this problem stress increasing heat supply to address deficits, rather \nthan increasing efficiency of energy utilization by improving heating systems and insulation. \nSchool foundations are also prone to structural failure due to the freezing of excessive moisture \nintake as a result of inadequate storm water drainage. Other systemwide problems include the \nalmost complete lack of fire-safety systems, widespread use of toxic lead-based paint, as well \nas problems with ventilation and air quality, especially with increasing recourse being made to \nwood-and coal-burning stoves in school dormitories.  \n \n12.  Electrical supply is often erratic in schools and kindergartens, especially in rural areas. \nPower is sourced either from the national grid or connection to a district power plant operated by \ndiesel. Where the latter is used, power cuts are frequent as many communities face difficulties \nin meeting the expense of diesel fuel. Alternative energy sources such as wind or solar power \n                                                 \n9  The GER can exceed 100% when children who are outside the normal age group enroll in a particular grade (e.g.,  \nwhen 9 year olds enroll in grade 1, which is intended for 8-year olds) \n10  A gender gap in favor of female enrolments is rather unique to Mongolia, and in part reflects perceived opportunity \ncosts, as school time conflicts with boys\u2019 ability to contribute to household income by working as herders.  \n11 From 1995 to 2000, 181,000 people over 5 (4.7% of the total) became internal migrants, with Ulaanbaatar alone \nexperiencing a net gain of 75,000 people. Other areas experiencing net inflows included the mostly urbanized \nDarhan-Uul and Orkhon aimags with net inflows of 4,900 and 9,700 persons respectively. (Source: National Survey \nOffice Population and Housing Census 2000, National Results) \n12 Many rural schools rely on inefficient coal-fired heating; daily use per school can be as high as 7 tons of coal. \nGenerally, coal dust is used which must be transported at great expense over vast distances.  ", "  4   \nare used only to a small degree, despite high suitability for Mongolian conditions,13 due to lack \nof resources for the necessary capital investment. Within schools, electrical systems are often \ndefective due to their exposure to moisture. As wiring is generally embedded in solid concrete, \nits repair and replacement is practically impossible. Schools generally respond by installing \nexposed impromptu wiring, which is usually extremely dangerous and a clear fire hazard. \n \n13.  Poor water supply is another major systemic deficiency. Piped systems are rare and \nwater is normally delivered to school tanks by animal, by truck or by hand. Few schools\u2013-\nincluding  boarding  schools\u2013have  functioning  internal  plumbing.  Hot  water  is  not  generally \navailable for washing, and lavatory facilities are normally pit latrines located in the school \ngrounds. This lack of sanitary facilities poses significant hygienic problems, especially for the \nresidents  of  school  dormitories.  In  addition,  the  inconvenience  posed  by  lack  of  sanitary \nfacilities\u2013-in boarding schools in particular\u2013-can be a significant factor in a student\u2019s decision to \ndrop out of school. \n \n14.  The building stock is also being eroded by the lack of any systematic approach to capital \nmaintenance or repair. Lack of funds and low technical expertise have led to ad hoc approaches \nto tackle individual problems after they occur. However, as architectural, structural, mechanical \nand electrical problems are often interrelated a piecemeal approach will be inadequate to fully \naddress a building\u2019s problems. As such there needs to be a shift toward a holistic system for \nproblem identification, repair and maintenance to successfully rehabilitate and improve longevity \nof Mongolia\u2019s schools. A full analysis of the needs and constraints of Mongolia\u2019s school facilities \nis in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n  4.  Educational Quality and Attainment \n \n15.  Principal constraints on improving educational quality include the high proportion of \nteachers who are employed without the training or credentials for the level or subjects that they \nare  teaching.  This  is  particularly  true  in  rural  aimags  (provinces)  where  the  proportion  of \nteachers without appropriate training is over 18% in Dornod, Umnogobi, and Selenge. By \ncomparison, rates in Ulaanbaatar are just over 4%. Rates also vary greatly by subject, with high \nproportions of uncertified teachers employed for English (15%) and Kazakh languages14 (19%), \nas well as for the vocationally oriented labor training (41%). Shortages in these areas are often \ndue  to  the  inability  of  the  education  sector  to  compete  with  the  private  sector  to  employ \npersonnel with these skills. Continued emphasis, therefore, needs to be placed on improving \nteachers\u2019 remuneration and working conditions, but also to provide support for upgrading the \nqualifications and skills of the nonprofessional teachers currently employed.  \n \n16.  The Mongolian academic curriculum comprises 18 different subject areas. Pupils in \nprimary  education  participate  in  up  to  10  subject  areas,  including  Mongolian  language, \nmathematics, natural sciences, history and social studies, as well as music and fine arts. In \nsecondary education, pupils participate in up to 14 subject areas, which include sciences, \nlanguages, humanities, arts, and informatics. This complex curriculum requires an extensive \nand varied resource base including teachers, learning materials, and learning resources such as \nscience laboratories and information and communication technologies (ICT) facilities. Ensuring \nthe  full  complement  for  schools  in  rural  provinces  proves  difficult  given  reduced  public \nexpenditure, as compared with when the overall curriculum was designed; unwillingness of \n                                                 \n13 Many parts of Mongolia receive over 300 days of sunlight annually, providing excellent potential for solar power. In \naddition, schools located in the relatively open steppe areas stand to benefit from wind power systems. \n14 Approximately 5% of the Mongolian population are Kazakhs, who live mainly in Bayan Olgii and Nalaikh. ", "  5   \nteachers to work in remoter areas and in difficult conditions; and physical constraints such as \nlack of electricity, and poor learning and residential conditions in schools. The result is that \neducational attainment of rural pupils is 18% lower than their urban counterparts.15 Attainment \nlevels of pupils living at home exceed those of children living in school dormitories, largely \nbecause of the very difficult living conditions in the latter, which acts against children from \npoorer families who comprise the majority of dormitory residents.  \n \n17.  As most school graduates do not proceed to vocational training or higher education, it \nhas become especially important to attune the academic curriculum to labor market needs. This \nis particularly true for science education, which could be given a more practical orientation and \nuse more student-centered methodologies. In addition, the Government has identified a demand \nfor vocational education to be integrated within the academic curriculum, to better prepare \ngraduates for finding employment and to retain boys in secondary education. \n \n18.  Availability  of  textbooks  and  learning  materials  is  another  key  factor  underlying \neducational quality. In the past decade Mongolia has become the forerunner among Asian \ntransition countries in education publishing with excellent progress made in developing new \ntitles characterized by high technical and pedagogical quality, and depoliticization of content, \nand undertaken in partnership with the private sector. Private sector publishing is relatively well \ndeveloped for a post-socialist country but is still limited, with a total of 6 publishing houses and 6 \ncombined publishers and printers. Lack of funding has meant, however, shortages of textbooks \nin schools are serious. In SY1999/2000, for example, 7 of 34 planned new titles were not \npublished. Textbook distribution has major problems, with aimags responsible for collecting their \nallocations from Ulaanbaatar directly, a system that imposes the highest costs on the remotest, \nand often poorest, regions. \n \n  5.  Education Planning, Management, and Finance \n \n19.  Overall responsibility for the delivery of education services rests with MOECS, which is \nmainly involved in policy and planning. Management and administration of the school system is \nundertaken by province, city, and district governments. A depiction of the sector\u2019s management \nstructure as well as the MOECS organization chart is in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  Mongolia\u2019s education expenditure is among the highest of the transition countries, partly \nbecause of the high costs of delivering services in a vast, sparsely populated territory with \nextreme climatic conditions. The Education Law of 1995 provides for at least 20% of total \nbudget revenue to be allocated for education. However, this has not been achievable given tight \nbudgetary constraints. Although education expenditures have been rising, they have yet to \nreach levels experienced in 1996. Education expenditures over time are provided in Appendix 3. \nState education expenditure amounted to 19.1% of total public outlays in 2000, or 7.9% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP). Local governments, particularly at the aimag level, play a dominant \nrole  in  financing  education,  accounting  for  68.7%  of  total  public  education  expenditure, \ncompared with 31.3% allocated from the central Government budget. Primary and secondary \neducation received the largest share of funding among education subsectors, at 48.8% of the \ntotal, with preschool education receiving 17.6%. Higher education and vocational education \naccounted for 17.8% and 2%.  \n \n                                                 \n15 Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (MOECS) of Mongolia/United Nation Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF)/ United \nNations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 2000. Monitoring Learning Achievement \nStudy. ", "  6   \n21.  To  promote  universal  access,  basic  education  in  Mongolia  is  free.  With  most  poor \nchildren already enrolled in education, the Government has not specifically adopted propoor \nresource allocation strategies for formal education, although it has increased funding shares to \nbasic education more than all other sectors with the exception of higher education; increasing \nexpenditures  154%  from  1996  to  2000.  However,  to  reach  out-of-school  children  the \nGovernment has adopted pro-poor planning in its Education Sector Strategy 2000-2005 (ESS), \nwith $1.4 million foreseen from 2000 to 2005 for this purpose. \n \n22.  Within  preschool,  primary,  and  secondary  education,  the  central  budget  finances \ntextbook publishing and printing, stipends, pupils\u2019 participation in international competitions and \nfinal examination costs. Local government budgets finance preschool, primary, and secondary \neducation. Expenditure projections are calculated on the basis of a standard variable cost per \npupil,16 factoring in expected enrolment rates. If local governments experience shortfalls in \nexpected budgetary revenue for education, they are entitled to receive grants from the central \nGovernment to fill these gaps. However, funds are provided on a block grant basis, which \ncommonly leads to these additional revenues being spent for sectors other than education, \nthereby exacerbating the budget deficits being experienced by the education sector. Concern \nabout the equity of local financing for education, must be addressed in the context of wider \nbudgetary and governance reform measures. \n \n23.  Schools have substantial autonomy in managing their own financial affairs within the \nconfines of approved budgets and actual cashflow. The bulk of their expenditure is for salary \nand utility costs, including heating. The latter typically accounts for 40% plus of school budget \nexpenditure due to strong demand for heating combined with very poor efficiency in energy \nutilization. Few funds remain for physical investment or maintenance (excluding equipment), \nand in 1998 just $520,000 was spent in Mongolia\u2019s 18 rural aimags, far below the levels needed \nto maintain Mongolia\u2019s extensive education infrastructure.  \n \n  6.  Demographic Situation \n \n24.  Projections of future enrolments are critical for effective education planning. In 1998, the \nestimated population of Mongolia was 2.4 million of whom 36.6% were between 5 and 19 years \nof age. In the same year, population growth was estimated at 1.4% per annum, a sharp fall from \n2.7% in 1990. This decrease implies that the preschool-age population will fall from today\u2019s \n233,000 to just 185,000 in SY2004/05. Plans for restoring access to preschool education will, \ntherefore, need to reflect the decreasing number of children in this age group. \n \n25.  New enrolments in primary education are also expected to fall from 56,497 in SY2000/01 \nto  46,054  in  SY2004/05.  However,  an  increase  can  be  expected  in  secondary  education \nenrolment from SY2000/01 to SY2003/04 of over 30,000 new pupils. Thereafter, enrolments are \nexpected to decline. These trends can be expected to reduce pressure on primary education, \nbut to further strain the capacity of the secondary education subsector, which is comparably \nmore resource intensive.  \n \n26.  Recent large-scale internal migration from rural areas to towns and cities has caused \nmajor imbalances in educational service provision. Schools in urban centers have seen demand \nfor services increase substantially, while many rural schools are now operating well below \n                                                 \n16 The aggregate unit cost for primary and secondary pupils in 1999 was $61 equivalent (disaggregated statistics are \nnot available). For preschool children, the unit cost was $132 equivalent. This compares with $155 equivalent and \n$103 equivalent in higher and vocational education. ", "  7   \ncapacity as a result of the outflows from their catchment areas. The result is a major distortion in \nthe geographical provision of education services, which should now be reoriented to focus more \non the increasing population centers and outlying areas. To allow this, substantial additional \ninvestments in education facilities in areas of increasing demand are essential. \n \n7.  Socioeconomic Context \n \n27.  In 1990, Mongolia initiated far-reaching economic reforms, linked to its overall political \nand social transformation. The Government established private property rights, privatized state \nassets, and liberalized prices and trade.  By 1993, 90% of livestock had been privatized. The \nshock of the reforms, combined with the withdrawal of aid from the Soviet Union\u2013-amounting to \nthe equivalent of 30% of GDP\u2013-as well as the loss of concessional supplies of raw materials \nand the guaranteed Council for Mutual Economic Cooperation (COMECON) export markets \nresulted in a dramatic decline in all economic indicators in the early years of the transition.  GDP \nfell by over 9% in both 1991 and 1992.  The 1989 GDP per capita figure of $1,645 fell to $329 \nby 1995 and had risen only to $450 by 1998 when early transition declines began reversing as \nmacroeconomic stability took hold and limited economic growth returned. Agricultural output \ndiminished  by  50%  between  1990  and  1993,  while  industrial  output  fell  by  33%.  Inflation \nreached  325%  in  1993.  Government  revenues  shrank.  And  real  wages  in  industry  and \nagriculture fell by 20% and nearly 33%.  \n \n28.  The economic contraction and the concomitant decline in social sector expenditures \nhave had a profoundly negative impact on the lives of most Mongolians. Prior to the transition, \npoverty was considered to be low in Mongolia, although specific data were not collected. In \ncontrast, in 1995, 36.3% of the population lived below the national poverty line of $17 per \nmonth.17 About 50% of those living in poverty (about 18 % of the total population) subsisted on a \nmonthly income below $10. Recent figures suggest that while the growth in poverty levels has \nstabilized,  those  living  in  poverty  are  becoming  poorer.  The  vulnerable  include  herding \nhouseholds with less than 100 livestock,18 the unemployed, those without a basic education, the \nelderly, the disabled, street children, orphans and households headed by single parents with \nmany children. Women are disproportionately represented in the last category. In 1998, the \nnumber of households headed by women comprised 10.2% of all households, 25% of all very \npoor households, and 18.3% of poor households. The number of single mothers with children \naged below 16 grew from 32,377 in 1995 to 40,653 in 1999, an increase of 26%.19 \n \nB.  Government Policies and Plans \n29.  The ESS20 provides the principal policy and planning framework for the education sector. \nIts stress on universal access to education, including free basic education, has a strong pro-\npoor bias. The ESS builds on ESDP policy reforms as well as on other national strategies, \ndescribed in Appendix 4. Priority areas include (i) alleviation of deficiencies with educational \nfacilities; (ii) teacher training and retraining; (iii) curriculum development, and (iv) provision of \ntextbooks and learning materials. These priorities are appropriate for tackling the problems that \nthe sector faces in restoring universal primary enrolment rates, improving and modernizing \neducational content and services, as well as improving the sustainability of a system that is \nproving  expensive  to  maintain  in  a  liberalized  economy  and  society.  The  ESS  calls  for \n                                                 \n17 Government of Mongolia. Living Standards Measurement Survey, 1996. \n18 An estimated 85% of herders have a herd size barely large enough to sustain livelihood.   \n19 Gender Briefing Kit, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2000. Ulaanbaatar. \n20 Supported by TA 3174-MON:Education Sector Strategy Study, approved on 12 March 1999 for $150,000. ", "  8   \ninvestment of at least $35 million equivalent in preschool, primary and basic education21 over its \nfive-year implementation period to implement its outline strategies for priority areas. Although, \nsubstantial support has been secured, many aid-financed interventions are still undertaken \noutside the ESS framework, thereby reducing potential for effective coordination. The SEDP as \nthe single largest aid or externally-financed intervention will provide a major boost to the ESS \nframework  and  should  act  as  a  catalyst  for  other  development  agencies  to  ensure  that \nassistance is provided within this common policy framework. \n \n30.  Under the ESS, with support from the ESDP and other projects, good progress has been \nmade  in  promoting  teacher  training,  improving  educational  quality,  and  improving  the \nsustainability of educational infrastructure by a program of closing and merging primary and \nsecondary schools. This has resulted in the creation of the \u201ccomplex\u201d and inter-soum school \nforms.22 The result has been to reduce the dilution in education financing. However, major \nadditional investment is still required for the remaining schools. About 30% of rural schools are \nin dangerous condition and over 80% need major repairs. In urban areas, new facilities are \nneeded to cater for demand increases as a result of the heavy net migrant inflows. These \nproblems have arisen due to a lack of domestic investment funds, as well as the inability of most \nactive assistance agencies to mobilize adequate levels of financing for civil works. Another root \ncause is the sheer unsustainability of maintaining current facilities, which were built using \nimported standard designs, often poorly suited for Mongolia\u2019s climatic conditions. With large-\nscale internal migration in recent years, many schools in rural areas are now operating below \ncapacity and repair is now uneconomic. With many schools coming to an end of their life spans, \nthe development of a new generation of school facilities should begin. These should offer good \nlearning and residential environments, be energy efficient, be appropriate to Mongolian climatic \nconditions, and be easy to maintain. In the growing urban areas, a parallel need is to develop \nnew facilities designed according to new, more efficient building standards and stressing energy \nefficiency and direct accessibility to the new, usually poorer, migrants.  \n \n31.  The ESS provides a good overall framework for ongoing development and operation of \nthe education sector until 2005. Within this framework more systematic policy development and \nplanning  is  needed  for  individual  aspects  of  the  education  sector,  including  (i)  facility \nmaintenance and development, (ii) provision of learning materials (especially to foster the role of \nthe private sector), (iii) staff recruitment and management, (iv) quality assurance systems, and \n(v) equity of financing systems for pro-poor resource allocations. These issues need to be \naddressed in the ESS\u2019s successor, for which preparation will commence in 2003. \n \n32.  The amendment to the Law on Education in 2002 has led to a fundamental policy \nchange with a move to an 11-year system of basic education based on 5 years of compulsory \nprimary education, 2 years of compulsory lower secondary, and 2 years of upper secondary \neducation. This reform will bring the education system more in line with neighboring countries, \nespecially the transition countries, and will bring down the starting age for primary school to 7, \nwhich is more in accordance with international standards.  \n \n33.  The proposed amendment also envisages integration of vocational education subjects \ninto mainstream education. With a 50% reduction in demand for programs in the traditional \nvocational  education  and  training  subsector  since  1990,  providing  modernized  and  more \n                                                 \n21 Comprising (i) $25 million for school facilities and equipment, (ii) $4.3 million for teacher training, (iii) $1.2 million for \neducational quality, and (iv) $1.6 million for educational research, for expenditures up to 2005. \n22 \u201cComplex\u201d schools typically provide services at the aimag level and \u201cInter-soum\u201d schools cater for multiple soums. \nPreviously, education policy was to maintain one school for each soum. ", "  9   \nrelevant services to match the changing demand patterns has become a high priority. However, \nthis reform has been hindered by the inability of vocational training institutions to reorient \nthemselves for the more flexible needs of the market-driven labor markets and their services still \ntend to be excessively specialized and formalized. In response, the Government has signaled \nits willingness to enter into partnerships with the private sector to develop and deliver training for \nadults,  for  which  it  is  receiving  support  under  the  ADB-financed  Social  Security  Sector \nDevelopment Program.23 At the same time, the Government is aiming to meet the demand for \ninitial  vocational  education  services  by  integrating  such  programs  into  general  education \ncurricula, given the increasing value placed on general competencies in the developing labor \nmarkets, as well as to improve the financial sustainability of vocational education services.  \n \nC.  External Assistance to the Sector \n34.  ADB has been a major provider of assistance to basic education since the early 1990s. \nThree TAs have been financed for policy, strategy development, and capacity building. The \nongoing  ESDP  (footnote  1)  has  financed  school  rationalization  and  upgrading,  textbook \nprovision, teacher training, and capacity building. During the implementation of the ESDP and \nstarting from the conceptualization of the SEDP scope, ADB has maintained close cooperation \nwith the Embassy of Japan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) regarding \ngrant assistance from the Government of Japan to the education sector. ADB has also worked \nclosely with the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) in design and development of SEDP. NDF is \ncurrently financing the modernization of the vocational training system in the framework of the \nSocial  Security  Sector  Development  Program.  The  Government  of  Japan  is  financing  the \nupgrading of urban schools, as well as support for policy development and ICT. ADB has also \nworked very closely with CIDA whose feasibility study into school construction and rehabilitation \ncontributed extensively to  the SEDP\u2019s design. The Canada Fund is also piloting approaches to \nrural school rehabilitation, which will yield vital information for the SEDP. The United Nations \nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  is  active  in  school  rehabilitation,  nonformal  education,  and \ndevelopment of community-based approaches to primary education. The Danish Agency for \nInternational  Development  Assistance  has  financed  the  development  of  40  rural  schools, \nalthough additional support is not planned. The Soros Foundation has an ongoing program for \nmodernizing  teacher  training,  educational  publishing,  and  ICT  development;  much  of  this \nsupport has been implemented in close concert with related ESDP activities. The World Bank \nhas financed small-scale renovations of schools under the Poverty Alleviation Program, as well \nas a number of policy-oriented, cross-cutting interventions including a public expenditure review \nand development of the poverty reduction strategy paper. In other subsectors, Germany is \nproviding support for modernizing vocational training and the European Union has provided \nsupport for quality improvement of higher education. An overview of externally-financed projects \nin the education sector is in Appendix 5. \n \n35.  To date, externally financed projects have been planned and executed on a bilateral \nbasis between the respective development agencies and Government, limiting coordination and \ncoherence between the different projects and raising transaction costs. During a meeting of \nagencies providing assistance to education hosted by the ADB Resident Mission in February \n2002 during SEDP appraisal, an understanding was reached that cooperation mechanisms \nneeded improving and that interventions should be fully in accordance with Government policies \nand under their leadership. At the initiative of ADB, World Bank and UNICEF supported the \nproposal to gradually move to introduce of sector wide approaches (SWAPs) in the education \n                                                 \n23 Loan Nos. 1836/1837 Social Security Sector Development Program, approved on 28 August 2001, for $12 million. \n ", "  10   \nsector. The planned Third Education project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will work \nwith the Government and other agencies to develop a successor to the current ESS. \n \n36.  The SEDP will be implemented by three of the principal development agencies in the \neducation  sector.  It  will  also  build  closely  on  the  partnership  established  with  the  Soros \nFoundation during the ESDP in capacity building and quality improvement. The SEDP will \ncoordinate closely with UNICEF, which is financing small-scale renovations of rural schools. \nADB will also coordinate with the World Bank, which is preparing an advisory program for \neducation. ADB and the World Bank have commenced discussions on fielding joint missions \nand other means of information exchange to ensure maximum transparency and cooperation, \nwith the aim of achieving the most optimal allocation of resources between the two institutions.  \n \nD.  Lessons Learned \n37.  The  SEDP  design  reflects  the  extensive  experience  gained  in  implementing  the \nsuccessful ESDP and from other interventions.24 The success of the ESDP can largely be \nattributed to the excellent working relationship with MOECS and other development agencies; \nthe high performance standards of the project implementation unit and high commitment levels \nby the political establishment, government, and civil society. General lessons learned include \nthe need to maintain a transparent and inclusive approach to project implementation to ensure \nappropriate design of project activities and continued public support; this was particularly true in \nthe case of the agreed redundancies of education staff under the ESDP, to which many sections \nof  Mongolian  society  reacted  critically  as  a  result  of  inadequate  public  consultation  and \ninformation.  As  many  ESDP  activities  were  enhanced  through  cooperation  with  Soros \nFoundation activities in the fields of publishing, teacher training and utilization of ICT in schools, \nit will be important for ADB to build on such partnerships and to expand coordination with other \nexternally financed activities. In the case of the SEDP, the cofinancing arrangement with the \nGovernment of Japan and NDF brings together the three major development partners who are \nworking to develop educational infrastructure, a partnership that will bring substantial economies \nof scale as well as opportunities for information exchanges and technology transfer. Another \nfactor  learned  from  the  ESDP  was  that  its  adherence  with  national  legislation  and  policy \nensured sustained political support. Another lesson learned is the need to include support for \npreschool education with that for primary and secondary education. As Mongolian children do \nnot start school until the age of 7 or 8, kindergarten provides a vital educational foundation in \nthe child\u2019s early years, and is equivalent to the primary school program in many countries. \nDespite this, support for kindergartens has been limited, resulting in continued shortages of \nthese essential services. The ESDP and other interventions have also revealed the need to \ninclude rural areas in projects. Finally, large-scale internal migration necessitates revising the \ngeographical distribution of educational services. With a move away from more remote soums, \ntargeting of project activities must anticipate the likely ongoing demographic movements. \n \n38.  Specific lessons learned will be applied for the rehabilitation of schools. These include \nthe need for a more comprehensive approach to rehabilitation to permit a more substantial \nextension of the school\u2019s lifespan. Even if initial costs will be higher with this strategy, reduced \nenergy and maintenance costs as well as lower replacement costs will ensure that this is the \nmost economic approach in the medium to long term. Valuable lessons were also learned in the \nfield of educational publishing: although the quality of new ESDP titles was high, the limited \n                                                 \n24 As confirmed by education studies in Mongolia including The Education Sector Strategy Study 2000-2005 (footnote \n20) and CIDA\u2019s Mongolia School Rehabilitation and Construction Feasibility Study of 200 and MOECS\u2019s 2001 \ncomprehensive inventory of educational assets. ", "  11   \nprivate sector involvement in this field limits greater diversity and higher quality in publishing. \nThe SEDP will, therefore, promote further private sector involvement in textbook provision. \nAnother valuable lesson relates to the introduction of ICT within the education sector. Although \nthis is of high priority to the Government and the general public, the impact has been limited by \nthe lack of a definitive concept or strategy for ICT integration into education. Through innovative \napproaches to ICT adoption and dialogue with other development agencies on lessons learned, \nthe SEDP will help to support this critical process of defining priorities and viable strategies. \n \nE.  ADB's Sector Strategy  \n39.  The SEDP\u2019s focus on basic education is fully in line with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic \nframework\u2019s  objective  of  contributing  to  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  which  aim  to \nachieve  universal  primary  education  in  all  countries  by  2015.  The  Poverty  Partnership \nAgreement signed by Government and ADB on 24 March 2000 earmarks ADB investment in the \nsocial sector as a means to maintain and improve the competitiveness of the labor force. These \npriorities are reflected in the country strategy and program update (2002 to 2004), which calls \nfor improving access to educational services for the poor by developing/rehabilitating schools, \nimproving delivery mechanisms, and maintaining/enhancing the quality of educational services. \nThese provisions are fully in line with the ESS.  \n \n40.  Operating  within  this  policy  framework,  the  SEDP  will  support  the  development  of \neducational services both in rural and urban areas facing challenges in educating migrant \nchildren.  Support  for  developing  school  infrastructure  will  allow  increased  participation  in \neducation, especially for children from poor families who rely on dormitory accommodation to \nattend school. Improved quality of education will also lead to increased enrolments, as the long-\nterm benefits accruing from education rise as compared to the short-term benefits from entering \nthe  labor  market.  Lastly,  improving  education  management  will  allow  for  more  sustained \nprovision of quality educational services. \n \n41.   In cooperation with other development partners and under Government leadership, ADB \nwill seek to develop a new pro-poor medium- and long-term policy and planning framework for \neducation to succeed the ESS, with the intention to gradually move to SWAPs. TA to support \nthis process is planned for 2003. \n \nF.  Policy Dialogue \n42.  ADB has maintained a close policy dialogue with the Government since the early 1990s, \nwhich has, inter alia, resulted in the adoption of the current ESS, which defines the objectives \nand priorities for the SEDP. The ongoing dialogue also contributed to the adoption of the 1995 \nLaw  on  Education,  and  the  ESDP  financed  major  reforms  to  school  forms  and  education \nprograms within that framework. ADB was also consulted in the amendment of the Law on \nEducation in 2002, which provides for an expansion of primary education from 4 to 5 years in \nline  with  neighboring  transition  countries.  ADB  has  been  requested  to  support  the \nimplementation of this new policy. ADB has also explored the potential for privatization in the \neducation sector with the Government, supporting initiatives to explore contracting out selected \nancillary services but advising caution on the extent of privatization, especially in poor rural \nareas where provision of such services is unlikely to be profitable. With agreement on overall \npolicy directions, the focus of dialogue in recent years has also shifted to more specific aspects \nof the education sector. \n ", "  12   \n43.  This  has  resulted  in  an  understanding  of  the  need  to  develop  new  approaches  to \ndevelopment and utilization of educational facilities, including the introduction of new, more \nefficient  and  affordable  building  standards  and  integration  of  different  forms  of  education \nservices in schools. Policy dialogue is ongoing on the issue of textbook provision and the need \nto promote private sector involvement, liberalize markets, and promote cost recovery in textbook \nprovision in secondary education. Discussions have also commenced on the role of ICT as one \nset of tools to advance specific objectives for improving education.  \n \n44.  ADB also initiated a proposal to move toward a SWAP, to improve the efficiency of \nresource mobilization and utilization. MOECS has supported this move, as have other major \nagencies,  including  World  Bank,  UNICEF,  and  Soros  Foundation.  ADB  has  proposed  to \nMOECS and other agencies that a new sector strategy, to succeed the current ESS, become \nthe major framework for the development of the SWAP. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n45.  The SEDP is required to support ongoing national efforts to promote economic growth \nand  to  reduce  poverty  through  the  provision  of  education  for  all  in  the  framework  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s ESS. It will address the need to continue activities commenced under the ESDP \nto increase access to quality preschool, primary, and secondary education in poorer urban and \nrural areas. It will also continue ESDP activities to improve efficiency in the sector, including \nsupport for greater institutional and financial stability. The SEDP is also required to support the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the achievement of social capital \ndevelopment objectives under the Poverty Partnership Agreement. \n \n46.  The SEDP\u2019s approach is fully in line with Mongolian education policy and will benefit \nfrom experience gained during ESDP implementation. Its implementation in conjunction with \nother major development partners will allow it to benefit from these agencies a substantial \nexperience in education sector development. It will maintain reforms commenced under the \nESDP, including focusing investment on a more streamlined network of education facilities and \nby further supporting the development of private sector educational publishing to increase the \nquality and diversity of learning materials. Commitment of Government, Parliament, and civil \nsociety to educational reform and development is strong and institutional capacity has proven \nitself sufficient for the management of major projects.  \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n47.  The main objective of the SEDP is to promote human development by developing \nuniversally  accessible  education  services,  and  strengthening  these  services.  Its  secondary \nobjective is to reduce income and deprivation poverty by improving sustainable access to quality \npreschool and basic education in poorer rural and urban communities. Specific objectives will \ninclude (i) improving access to services (kindergartens and schools), including children with \ndisabilities; (ii) improving the quality and relevance of education services; (iii) improving the \nefficiency and effectiveness of education management; and (iv) enhancing the efficiency of \npublic resource allocation for education services by reducing recurrent financing requirements \nfor operation and maintenance of education facilities, expansion of the textbook rental scheme, \nand improved accountability in education management. \n ", "  13   \n48.  Specifically, the SEDP will finance the improvement of educational services in poorer \nrural areas, where quality of and access to education have lagged behind other areas. The \nSEDP will address these issues by supporting the renewal of school and kindergarten facilities, \nwhich are accessible to the poor, to improve learning environments, guarantee operations \nduring winter, and provide decent accommodation for boarding pupils. The SEDP will also \ndirectly tackle the major shortages in educational services in rapidly growing urban areas by \nbuilding new schools, that  will directly serve\u2013-and be located in\u2013-poorer communities and will \nset new standards in performance and efficiency. In addition, the SEDP will improve the quality \nof educational services to the poor by addressing shortages of learning materials, improving the \nintegration  of  ICT  into  education,  modernizing  science  education,  integrating  vocational \neducation, and by improving teacher training services. The sustainability of educational services \nwill also be addressed through a capacity building program for education administrations.  \n \n49.  SEDP  activities  will  be  implemented  nationwide,  with  the  greatest  emphasis  on \nimproving  educational  services  to  the  poorest  communities.  The  SEDP  will  have  three \ncomponents:  school  and  kindergarten  development,  quality  improvement,  and  education \nmanagement. \n \n1.  School and Kindergarten Development  \n \na.  Urban School Development (Government of Japan) \n50.  To resolve problems posed by insufficient and deteriorating educational facilities in the \nnation\u2019s three major urban centers, schools in Darhan-Uul, Orkhon, and Ulaanbaatar were \nidentified for improvement. The Government of Japan is financing the upgrading of 16 schools \nin Ulaanbaatar. Works at seven schools have been completed and are under way in five others. \nIn  2000,  the  Mongolian  Government  asked  the  Government  of  Japan  to  finance  the \nrehabilitation of a selected number of schools in the major cities in Darhan-Uul and Orkhon. \nJICA completed the final due diligence (the detailed basic design) on the requested school \nrehabilitation for implementation during 2002-2004.  \n \n51.  The new schools developed under this component will be built to far more economical \nstandards than with existing designs, requiring 60% less floor space for the same student \ncapacity, cutting back on per student operating and maintenance costs, while also improving the \nlearning  environment.  The  emphasis  on  reduced  energy  consumption  and  maintenance \nrequirements will result in lower operating costs and maintenance requirements allowing for \nmore sustained education provision. To ensure sustainability of building designs, requirements \nwill  be  based  on  locally  available  materials.  Technologies  and  designs  introduced  in  this \nsubcomponent will serve as models for the development of new education facilities in Mongolia. \n \nb.

They  will  specify  the  expenditures  for  all  activities  and  identify  all \nexpenditures  to  be  financed  by  the  loan  proceeds.  Project  accounts,  including  financial \nstatements, statements of expenditures, and imprest account records, will be audited annually \nby auditors acceptable to ADB. The auditors\u2019 report, and copies of the certified accounts and \nrelated financial statements, including the auditors\u2019 opinions on the use of loan proceeds, \ncompliance with loan covenants, and the use of the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditures procedures, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after the \nend of the fiscal year to which they relate. Records and accounts, as well as audit procedures, \nwill be established for the Government of Japan and NDF-financed SEDP components, in line \nwith the respective agencies\u2019 requirements. \n \ne.    Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n75.  Monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken in the framework of MOECS\u2019s existing \neducation management information system, as well as through specific measures to gauge \nSEDP  benefits  within  the  context  of  the  education  sector  as  a  whole  using  a  system  of \nmonitorable indicators, based on a review of baseline statistics. Consulting services will be \nprovided for this purpose and surveys commissioned to independently supervise and evaluate \nSEDP activities. Monitoring and evaluation specialists will be recruited to support MOECS in \ndeveloping  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  and  to  assess  overall  SEDP  impact  on  a \nsystematic basis. The specialists will report directly to the steering committee. \n \nG.  The Executing Agency  \n76.  MOECS, the Executing Agency for the SEDP, has successfully implemented the ESDP30 \nand has attracted a wide range of assistance agencies to the education sector. It has also \nsuccessfully supported the implementation of three ADB TAs, leading to the development of a \ncomprehensive policy and planning framework for the education sector. MOECS has also been \ninstrumental in undertaking educational reforms that place Mongolia at the forefront of Asian \ntransition countries in terms of educational performance, and provide a comprehensive and \nsolid policy framework for SEDP implementation.  \n \n77.  A weakness of MOECS, which was highlighted during ESDP implementation, however, \nwas its lack of capacity for supervising civil works. This problem has, however, been addressed \nthrough the creation of a self-financing CCU under MOECS. As a new unit, the SEDP will \n                                                 \n30 The implementation performance rating is highly satisfactory with original activities completed ahead of schedule. ", "  22   \nprovide support for CCU\u2019s development. With regard to textbook provision, MOECS\u2019s policies \nand operating procedures are not yet fully compatible with utilizing private sector capacities in \neducational publishing, although it has initiated programs with assistance agencies, including \nthe Soros Foundation, to modify structures and arrangements. Capacity for policy development \nand planning of ICT integration also requires development. SEDP will address this by providing \nstaff training and building partnerships with specialized ICT research and training institutions. \n \nH.  Environmental and Social Measures \n1.  Environment \n78.  No  adverse  environmental  effects  are  expected  from  the  SEDP.  A  comprehensive \nenvironmental assessment was undertaken under the CIDA Mongolia School Rehabilitation and \nConstruction Study. Its findings are presented in Supplementary Appendix B. The SEDP will \nalso provide support for the environmental studies program for primary grades 1 to 3, by \nproviding learning materials and teacher training for selected schools to strengthen this program \nand to make it more relevant to the daily lives of students. \n \n2.  Social Analysis \n79.  The SEDP, including components financed by Government of Japan and NDF, will \nprovide positive educational benefits to children aged 4 to 18, of kindergarten, primary, and \nsecondary school age. There will be no adverse social or educational impacts (Appendix 10 \ninclude the initial social assessment), or involuntary resettlement effects. New facilities will be \nconstructed on existing school sites or in sparsely populated areas on land allocated by local \nadministrations,31 and selected in consultation with local communities. The SEDP is, therefore, \nclassified as Resettlement Category C. \n \n80.  The  SEDP  is  classified  as  Category  C  in  terms  of  impact  on  indigenous  peoples. \nAlthough Mongolia comprises over 16 distinct clans and ethnic groups none of these is so \ndistinct  from  the  dominant  or  mainstream  society  that  is  especially  vulnerable  to  being \ndisadvantaged in the process of development. \n \n81.  The  SEDP  will  also  make  provision  to  address  the  lower  participation  of  boys  in \neducation, particularly at the upper secondary level. Support will be aimed primarily at revising \neducational programs to make them more suitable to boys\u2019 demands including more links with \nlabor markets and integration of vocational education into standard curricula. \n \nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION \nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses  \n1.  Project Benefits \n82.  The principal benefit of the SEDP will be to safeguard and restore access for at least \n95,000 children of kindergarten and school age through the rehabilitation and construction of \neducational facilities, including dormitories. About 45% of these children are expected to be \nfrom poor families. The SEDP will also enhance the external efficiency of both primary and \nsecondary  education  programs  and  their  relevance  to  the  emerging  social  and  economic \n                                                 \n31 There is no private land ownership in Mongolia; allocation of land is the responsibility of local administrations. ", "  23   \ncontext. At least 140,000 children of kindergarten and school age are expected to benefit. \nGraduates of the SEDP-supported schools and programs will benefit from enhanced skills and \nknowledge, which will boost their ability to secure viable employment and their future income-\nearning potential. Modernizing educational methods and improving educational content will \nallow increased labor mobility between economic sectors. Access of children with disabilities to \neducation  will  also  be  facilitated  by  upgrading  school  facilities  and  developing  staff \ncompetencies for integrating children with disabilities into mainstream programs. \n \n83.  The SEDP will have a significant impact on public expenditure by emphasizing far \ngreater efficiency in the development and management of existing educational institutions, \nparticularly for energy and utility costs, which typically account for 40% or more of individual \ninstitutions\u2019  recurrent  expenditure.  By  2007,  SEDP  investments  could  decrease  annual \nexpenditures by 22%, saving over $3.2 million yearly on selected items (Table 3). By developing \nnew school designs, capable of accommodating more students, operating cost unit per student \ncan be decreased in SEDP schools.  \n \nTable 3: Expected SEDP Impact on Recurrent Budgetary Requirements (selected items)32 \n \nItem  Budgeted  Percentage Reduction  Recurrent Annual \nResources in 1999  (increase) in   Expenditure Forecast  \n(MNT million)  Real Budgetary  in 2007  \n  Allocations by 2007  (MNT million, 1999 prices) \n(%) \nElectricity            2,049                    5                  1,947 \nCoal and Heating          10,897                  25                  8,173 \nFuel Transportation               479                  15                     407 \nClean and Waste            1,593                  20                  1,274 \nWater \n        Total          15,018                  11,801 \nSource: ADB Staff calculations. \n \n84.  The SEDP\u2019s drive to emphasize the importance of preventative maintenance is also \nexpected  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  reducing  capital  expenditures  for  repairs  and \nconstruction of facilities in the medium to long term. An additional benefit, noted from the ESDP, \nis that the health of both staff and students can be expected to improve after school facilities are \nrehabilitated. Health problems generally arise as a result of sustained exposure to freezing \ntemperatures, which characterize so many schools in Mongolia today. \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n85.  The SEDP has direct implications for children of kindergarten and school age in both \nurban and rural areas. In urban areas, SEDP activities will be aimed specifically at providing \neducational services to poorer communities, many of which are located in the suburban tented \ncommunities, and where the majority of new migrants to urban areas reside. In addition, SEDP \nwill help to safeguard educational services by supporting strategically located schools serving \npoorer rural communities. Support to rural boarding schools\u2019 dormitories, which poor children \nare strongly reliant on for attending school, will be a key element to facilitating poor children\u2019s \n                                                 \n32Generally  a  wide  discrepancy  exists  between  actual  expenditures  by  item  and  provided  budgets.  As  real    \nexpenditures on heating are widely believed to be far in excess of budgetary provisions, the real savings from \nimproved heating can be expected to be far greater than the estimated budgetary reductions. ", "  24   \naccess. In addition, the SEDP will facilitate the access to mainstream education services for \nchildren with disabilities and special learning needs. \n \n86.  The SEDP will address the wide gender gap in secondary education by improving \neducation programs in line with boys\u2019 needs. Widespread poverty means that boys\u2019 labor is \noften required by their households for herding to bring in extra income. With the quality and \nrelevance of education perceived as low, the opportunity cost of their full-time participation in \neducation is seen as high, leading to their withdrawal from school. By adapting the content and \nmethods of education provision more to actual labor market needs, the perceived opportunity \ncost of education will fall, thus encouraging greater enrolment and retention.  \n \nC.  Impact on Poverty \n87.  The SEDP will have direct and indirect impacts on pupils from poor families, including \nchildren with disabilities. It will reduce deprivation poverty by increasing access to education in \nareas with the lowest enrolment rates, including remote rural areas, as well as among migrant \nand poorer communities in the principal urban centers of Ulaanbaatar and in Darhan-Uul and \nOrkhon aimags. Due to the investments in educational facilities under the SEDP it will again be \npossible to restore full access to educational services by selected schools. \n \n88.  Income poverty will also be addressed by SEDP activities for increasing and diversifying \neducational attainment that will allow school graduates to proceed to higher education and to \ncompete better in labor markets. These opportunities will enhance graduates\u2019 opportunities for \nincome earning, which will directly affect the livelihoods of themselves and their dependents.  \n \nD.  Risks \n89.  Risks are relatively few for the SEDP, given high societal and governmental commitment \nto education and the SEDP\u2019s aims. In addition, Mongolia has accumulated substantial project \nimplementation  experience  from  ADB  and  other  agencies.  However,  the  relative  lack  of \nspecialist personnel and institutional experience of some areas covered by the SEDP poses \nsome  risk  for  SEDP  implementation.  This  includes  building  design  and  supervision  where \nMOECS has only recently established a specialist CCU for this purpose. These risks can, \nhowever, be mitigated with sufficient emphasis on capacity building under the SEDP, and by \ncooperating in this field with other agencies by pooling experience and resources. The lack of \ninstitutional  capacity  in  education  management  structures  for  adoption  and  integration  of \nappropriate ICT, and promotion of private sector publishing provision also poses some risk to \neffective implementation. This, too, should be addressed with a program of capacity building \ntogether with the development of partnerships with specialist institutions in the private sector.  \n \n90.  Another risk concerns contractor capacity for civil works on schools, especially in remote \nrural areas. Some contracts will be relatively large for the communities included in the SEDP, \nand if contractors face difficulties in mobilizing sufficient personnel, equipment, and materials, \ndelays in works could lead to disruptions in school operations. Given the very short construction \nseason,  even  short  slippages  in  implementation  progress  can  lead  to  major  delays,  if \ncontractors are forced to suspend work during the long winters. This risk can best be offset by \neffective supervision of works, as well as by setting realistic schedules and outputs in the \ncontracting process. This will be addressed by substantial financing of the requisite specialist \npersonnel to support supervision during the SEDP and to develop longer-term capacities in this \narea within MOECS and local administrations. \n ", "  25   \n91.  A harmonized approach to educational infrastructure development and maintenance by \nall major developing agencies is essential. This will require support for the Government\u2019s policy \nof  rationalizing  the  education  network  with  the  creation  of  the  new  strategically  located \n\u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201cinter-soum\u201d schools at the core. Support for developments outside this policy \nframework will lead to resources being channeled to unsustainable institutions and a deficient \nallocation of resources within the sector. Effective aid coordination will, therefore, be essential. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n92.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, MOECS will prepare and submit to ADB \nfor approval a plan to modify the rental system for textbooks for secondary \neducation  to  be  provided  under  the  SEDP,  as  well  as  a  timetable  for  the \nintroduction of a fully liberalized market for textbooks and learning materials. \nMOECS will commence implementation, on a pilot basis, of the modified rental \nsystem within 18 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n(ii)  Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will take all necessary \nactions to ensure that all children, regardless of legal status (e.g., children of \ninternal  migrants  lacking  the  required  transfer  documentation),  can  enroll  in \nschools of their choice at SEDP sites.  \n \n(iii)  Within 18 months of loan effectiveness and in consultation with ADB and other \ndevelopment agencies, MOECS will prepare a draft ICT policy paper covering \nprimary and secondary education, and future investments in ICT to advance key \neducation priorities. \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that all schools and sites selected for development \nunder the SEDP meet the selection criteria, as described in Appendix 6. \n \n(v)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  MOECS  consults  with  provincial  and  local \ngovernments, including local hurals (district councils), as well as school boards, \nin the planning, rehabilitation, and construction of facilities under the SEDP. \n \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that provincial and local governments provide all \nnecessary counterpart funds on a timely basis. Adequate funds for operation and \nmaintenance of SEDP facilities will be provided through specific line items for \noperation and maintenance in the annual budget.  \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n93.  The Loan Agreement for the Project will not become effective until all conditions for \neffectiveness of the loan documentation for the NDF loan, aside from effectiveness of the ADB \nLoan Agreement, have been satisfied. \n ", "  26   \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n94.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 10,806,000 to Mongolia for the Second Education Development Project, \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n10 July 2002 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  27   \nAppendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoals       \n       \nEnsure that by 2015, all  Net enrolment ratio in  \u2022  Government  Macroeconomic and political \nchildren, will be able to  primary and secondary  statistics (National  climate remain positive \ncomplete a full course of  education  Statistics Office,   \nprimary schooling.

Rehabilitation  will  be  minor  in  scope  with  no  involuntary \nresettlement effects. \n \nC.   Impact on Indigenous Peoples \n \n8.  The SEDP is classified as Category C. Although Mongolia comprises over 16 distinct \nclans and ethnic groups (of Mongol and Turkic origin) none of these is, according to the working \ndefinition employed by ADB, so \u201cdistinct from the dominant or mainstream society that it makes \nthem especially vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the process of development.\u201d \n \n9.  This is demonstrated by Table A10.1, which shows the literacy rates of the different \nethnic groups in Mongolia  ", "  48  Appendix 10, page 2 \n \nTable A10.1: Resident Population Aged 7 and Over by Ethnic Group \nand Literacy Rate, 2000 \n \nEthnic Group  Literate population %)  Illiterate population(%) \nTotal population  95.4  4.6 \nKhalkh  95.7  4.3 \nKazakh  93.2  6.8 \nDorvod  94.4  5.6 \nBayad  94.0  6.0 \nBuriad  96.3  3.7 \nDariganga  94.0  6.0 \nZakhchin  95.3  4.7 \nUriankhai  94.3  5.7 \nDarkhad  91.6  8.4 \nUuld  95.7  4.3 \nTorgund  95.1  4.9 \nKhoton  90.2  9.8 \nKhotgoid  93.2  6.8 \nMyangad  94.7  5.3 \nTuva  93.6  6.4 \nOthers  93.4  6.6 \n            Source: National Statistical Office, Population and Housing Census, 2000 \n \n10.  The differences in literacy rates between the different groups are remarkably small. As \nexpected the lower literacy rates can be observed among groups that reside in the remotest \nareas of the country, where educational services are most difficult to provide.  \n \n11.  Levels of educational participation do not differ significantly between the various ethnic \ngroups (Table A10.2). \n \nTable 2: Resident Population Aged 7 and Over by Ethnic Group \nand Educational Level, 2000 \n \nEthnic Group  Educated   Non-educated  Population with at least \nPopulation (%)  population (%)  secondary education (%) \nTotal population  80.0  20.0  58.3 \nKhalkh  80.3  19.7  59.2 \nKazakh  77.0  23.0  47.9 \nDorvod  78.9  21.1  56.6 \nBayad  78.3  21.7  54.8 \nBuriad  82.4  17.6  63.8 \nDariganga  78.8  21.2  57.1 \nZakhchin  78.5  21.5  56.4 \nUriankhai  79.5  20.5  55.2 \nDarkhad  77.5  22.5  46.6 \nUuld  80.3  19.7  57.9 \nTorgund  80.2  19.8  61.9 \nKhoton  70.8  29.2  43.3 \nKhotgoid  81.3  18.7  49.8 \nMyangad  78.4  21.6  56.0 \nTuva  79.2  20.8  52.1 \nOthers  79.4  20.6  56.7 \nSource: National Statistical Office, Population and Housing Census, 2000.
