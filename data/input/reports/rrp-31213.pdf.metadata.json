Environmental implications were reviewed and no significant \nadverse environmental impacts were identified. \n \nCategory C. There will be no involuntary resettlement effects. \n\n \nCategory C. No adverse impact. \n\n \nThe  SEDP  is  required  to  support  ongoing  national  efforts  to  promote \neconomic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  through  education.  In  particular,  it \nwill  address  the  need  to  build  on  reforms  and  activities  commenced \nunder  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financed  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Program (ESDP) to increase access to quality primary and \nsecondary  education,  especially  in  rural  areas  and  in  poorer  urban \ncommunities. It will also continue ESDP activities for improving efficiency \nin  the  sector,  including  support  for  greater  institutional  and  financial \nstability.  The  SEDP  will  support  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  for  Mongolia,  and  the  social  capital  development \nobjectives  under  the  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement  between  ADB  and \nMongolia. \n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  SEDP  is  to  promote  human  development \nthrough  universal  access  to  education.  Its  secondary  objective  is  to \nreduce  income  and  deprivation  poverty  by  improving  access  to  quality \npreschool  and  basic  education  in  poorer  rural  and  urban  communities. \nSpecific  objectives  will \nto  services \n(kindergartens  and  schools),  including  for  children  with  disabilities;  (ii) \nimproving the quality and relevance of education services; (iii) improving \nthe  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  education  management;    and    (iv) \nenhancing  the   efficiency   of  public  resource  allocation  for  education \n\nimproving  access \n\ninclude  (i) \n\n\fCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nExecuting Agency  MOECS \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\n \n\nby  reducing  recurrent  financing  requirements  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  education  facilities,  expanding  the  textbook  rental \nscheme, and improving accountability in education management. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  $68.5  million  equivalent,  of  which  $43.2  million \nequivalent is the foreign exchange cost and $25.3 million equivalent the \nlocal currency cost. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  SDR  10.806  million  ($14  million  equivalent). \nThe  Government  of  Japan  will  provide  grant  financing  of  $45  million \nequivalent,  and  the  Nordic  Development  Fund  (NDF)  will  provide  a \nconcessional loan of $4.8 million equivalent. The balance of $4.7 million \nequivalent will be provided by the Government. The ADB loan will include \nfinancing of the interest charge. \n \nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  is  for  SDR  10.806  million  ($14  million \nequivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a \nmaturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. Interest will be \ncharged at 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \nThe Borrower will be Mongolia. \n \n30 June 2008. \n\n \nMOECS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  with  primary  responsibility  for \noverall  planning  and  coordination  of  SEDP  activities,  for  implementing \nADB  and  NDF-financed  SEDP  activities,  and  executing  agency \nresponsibilities for the urban school development activities to be financed \nby  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  deputy  minister,  MOECS  will  be  the \nproject  director,  with  responsibility  for  providing  the  policy  and  strategic \ndirection for ADB and NDF-financed activities. School boards will also be \nconsulted in planning SEDP activities in schools. A multisectoral steering \ncommittee  has  also  been  established  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  to \noversee  implementation  of  the  ADB  and  NDF-financed  activities.  A \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  has  been  established  to  support \nMOECS in achieving SEDP objectives. The PMU is headed by a project \nmanager  who  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  ADB \nand  NDF-financed  SEDP  activities.  ADB  and  the  PMU  will  coordinate \nwith the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Mongolia office \nduring  implementation  to  ensure  coordination  among  the  respective \nSEDP components.  \n \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  from  the  ADB    loan  proceeds  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nProcurement under the Japanese and NDF parallel cofinanced activities \nwill be carried out in accordance with their respective procedures. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n\fConsulting \nServices \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niv \n\n \n\nADB  will  finance  21  person-months  of  international  consulting  services \nand  459  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.

The  Project  will  also \nenhance the external efficiency of both primary and secondary education \nprograms  and  their  relevance  to  the  emerging  social  and  economic \ncontext.  At  least  140,000  children  of  kindergarten  and  school  age  are \nexpected  to  benefit.  The  Project  will  also  have  a  significant  impact  on \npublic  expenditure  by  improving  efficiency  in  the  development  and \nmanagement  of  educational  institutions,  particularly  with  respect  to \nenergy costs. By introducing new technologies and techniques, over $3.2 \nmillion equivalent is expected to be saved annually. The SEDP\u2019s support \nfor improved facilities planning and management\u2013-including maintenance  \n\u2013-is  also  expected  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  reducing  capital \nexpenditures  for  repairs  and  construction  of  facilities  in  the  medium  to \nlong term. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto Mongolia for the Second Education Development Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n2. \nIn  1999,  the  Government  of  Mongolia  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nsupport  a  second  education  development  project  (SEDP)  as  a  follow-up  to  the  ongoing \nEducation  Sector  Development  Program  (ESDP).1  ADB  subsequently  approved  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA)2 for the proposed SEDP. Following the submission of the \nconsultant  report  in  February  2001,  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA) \nprovided funding for a feasibility study3 to refine selected aspects of the proposal. The SEDP is \nincluded in the 2001 country strategy and program update as a firm project loan of $14 million \nequivalent  for  2002  and  is  classified  as  an  intervention  focusing  on  the  promotion  of  human \ndevelopment. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nSector Description: Preschool, Primary, and Secondary Education \n\n1. \n\nSector Overview \n\n3. \nEducation was one of the country\u2019s principal achievements in the socialist era. As part of \nthe  Government\u2019s  goal  to  eliminate  illiteracy  and  to  achieve  universal  education  to  grade  8 \nbefore  1940,  modern  school  and  dormitory  facilities  were  established  in  all  soum  (district) \ncenters,  allowing  all  children,  including  those  from  remote  nomadic  families,  to  obtain  a  basic \neducation.  The  results  were  impressive.  Gross  enrolment  rates  (GER)4  in  primary  and \nsecondary  education  reached  99%  by  1990,  a  remarkable  achievement  given  the  country\u2019s \ngeographic  and  sociocultural  (i.e.  nomadic)  characteristics.  This  is  evidenced  by  very  high \nliteracy rates, which stood in 2000 at 98% of the total population aged over 15, with only minor \ndifferences  between  urban  and  rural  areas.  Notable  also  is  the  equality  of  educational \nparticipation  and  achievement  among  Mongolia\u2019s  over  16  recognized  clans  (para.  79)  and \nethnic groups. In addition, by 1990 a network of over 900 kindergartens had been established \nproviding  places  for  over  97,000  children  and  playing  a  vital  role  in  allowing  women  to \nparticipate freely in the labor force. \n \n4. \nThe  decline  of  the  state  economy  in  the  1990s  impacted  negatively  on  the  education \nsystem,  particularly  in  the  early  transition  years  and  especially  in  rural  Mongolia.  State \neducation expenditures were massively reduced. Without finance for essential maintenance and \nrepairs,  school  facilities  deteriorated  and  many  were  forced  to  close.  Preschools  were  worst \naffected  with  244  kindergartens  closing  between  1990  and  2001.  Availability  of  learning \nmaterials dwindled and teachers\u2019 real salaries eroded markedly. By 1996, the GER had fallen to \n82% and dropouts5 rose by 2,300% between school years (SYs) 1988/89 and 1992/93.   \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Loan 1507/1508-MON: Education Sector Development Program, approved 19 December 1996 for $15.15 million.  \n2   TA 3351-MON: Second Education Development Project, approved  20 December 1999 for $0.55 million. \n3   CIDA Mongolia School Rehabilitation and Construction Feasibility Study, 2002 \n4   Enrolment in primary and secondary schools divided by the school age population (8-15 years). \n5   Defined by MOECS as a pupil who has missed a year of school.  \n\n\f \n\n \n2\n\n \n\nEducation  indicators  have,  however,  improved  markedly  in  recent  years.  Wide-ranging \n5. \nreforms to focus state resources have allowed real funding of primary and secondary education \nto  increase.  Significant  levels  of  private  financing  for  education  was  mobilized  with  38  private \nschools  operating  alongside  state  schools  by  2001,  and  cost  recovery  measures,  including \ntextbook rentals, helped to supplement overstretched public budgets. In addition, a program of \nconsolidation of the extensive education infrastructure under the ESDP\u2013-including merging and \nclosing  of  schools  as  well  as  staff  reductions\u2013-improved  the  efficiency  and  affordability  of  the \nsector  and  freed  resources  for  increasing  financing  for  essential  items,  such  as  teachers\u2019 \nsalaries,6  which  helped  to  maintain  educational  quality.  By  SY1999/2000,  the  national  GER  in \nprimary  and  secondary  education  had  risen  to  over  90%  again.  Improvements  in  rural  areas \nhave, however, lagged behind. In 203 of the total 342 districts, the GER was lower than 80%.7 \nProgress  in  restoring  access  to  preschool  education  was  also  remarkable  with  over  83,000 \nchildren enrolled in kindergartens in 2001, a substantial increase from 1995, when only 64,100 \nchildren were enrolled. \n \n\n2. \n\nStructure and Participation  \n\n6. \nFormal  education  in  Mongolia  commences  with  up  to  4  years  of  noncompulsory \npreschool  education,  which  comprises  kindergarten  and  nursery  school,  and  provides  a  solid \neducational foundation for primary school. Most children enter primary education at the age of \neight.  This  stage  lasts  for  4  years  and  is  followed  by  4  years  of  lower  secondary  education. \nPrimary  and  secondary  education  are  seen  as  a  whole  and  together  comprise  compulsory  or \nbasic education. This stage is then followed by 2 years of upper secondary education, which is \na prerequisite for university admission. The structure of the education system is in Appendix 2. \nIn April 2002, the Law on Education was amended to provide for 5 years of primary education; it  \nwill be implemented progressively from 2002 to 2005. \n \n7. \nBefore  1990,  enrolment  in  preschool  education  was  compulsory.  In  the  early  transition \nyears,  enrolment  rates  in  kindergartens  fell  from  97,200  in  SY1990/91  to  just  64,100  in \nSY1995/96. Since that time, however, enrolment has been rising steadily and stood at 78,630 in \nSY1999/2000 in a total of 650 kindergartens. However, enrolment rates in nursery schools are \nstill  well  below  levels  seen  prior  to  the  transition  as  a  result  of  the  dissolution  of  many  of  the \nenterprises  to  which  they  were  attached.  Whereas  21,600  children  were  enrolled  in  formal \nnursery  schools  in  SY1990/1991,  this  figure  had  fallen  to  just  1,600  in  SY1998/99,  with  few \nnursery schools remaining in rural areas: the number of such institutions fell from 441 to a mere \n34.  The  relatively  high  cost  of  preschool  education  prevents  many  children  from  participating; \nannual costs exclusive of clothing amount to approximately $55 equivalent per child,8 which is \nbeyond the abilities of poor families. Government policy is to restore services by supporting the \nestablishment  of  private-sector  institutions.  The  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture  and  Science \n(MOECS)  estimates  that  today  only  28%  of  primary  school  pupils  have  received  a  preschool \neducation. With higher dropout rates linked to nonparticipation in preschool education, restoring \nservices is a vital task. \n \n8. \nIn SY1999/2000, 470,038 pupils were enrolled in 668 primary and secondary schools. Of \nthese  schools,  128  offered  only  primary  education,  216  offered  combined  primary  and  lower \nsecondary  education,  with  the  remaining  324  offering  the  full  10  grades  of  primary  and \nsecondary education. As with preschool education, enrolment rates dropped sharply after 1990, \n                                                 \n6   School teachers today typically earn over $100 monthly, well above the average for Asian transition countries. \n7   School attendance varies widely by region: the lowest rate of 36.3% is in Uvurhangai, while Selenge records 49%. \n\nIn urban areas, figures are 58% in Ulaanbaatar, 56.3% in Orkhon, and 55.8 % in Darhan-Uul. \n\n8   Comprising 50% contribution to food costs and learning material costs. \n\n\f \n\n \n3\n\n \n\n3. \n\nEducational Infrastructure \n\nfalling from a total of 446,665 pupils in SY1989/90 to a trough of 370,302 in SY1993/94 before \nrecovering. In 1999, the GER stood at 103.8%9 for grades 1 to 4, 76.8% for grades 5 to 8, and \n34.1%  for  grades  9  to  10.  However,  widening  gender  disparities  are  widening,  with  boys \naccounting for only 40% of enrolment in upper secondary education.10 \n \n \n \n9. \nA  major  constraint  to  increasing  the  GER\u2013-and  education  quality\u2013-is  the  capacity \nlimitation of school facilities, many of which have deteriorated markedly in the transition period. \nThe  problem  has  been  particularly  acute  in  rural  provinces  where  resources  for  maintenance \nand  rehabilitation,  as  well  as  technical  expertise,  are  scarce.  Mongolia  has  511  rural  schools \ncomprising  of  over  800  buildings,  including  teaching  facilities,  dormitories,  and  heating  plants. \nOf  these,  409  schools  and  278  dormitories  across  rural  Mongolia  have  been  prioritized  for \nsignificant repair work by MOECS. MOECS and CIDA estimate that about 30% of these schools \nare in danger of collapse if rehabilitation work is not undertaken within the next 2 years. \n \nLarge-scale internal migration into urban centers has also greatly tested the capacity of \n10. \nschools  in  areas  witnessing  high  population  inflows.11  With  most  of  the  189  urban  schools \noperating on a three-shift basis, assistance is urgently need to maintain and develop capacity to \nprovide educational services for migrant children. This will require expansion of existing facilities \nas well as construction of new schools in districts that have grown most rapidly. \n \n11. \nBuilding construction and technology is based on 30-year old construction standards that \nare  inefficient  in  terms  of  use  of  materials,  structural  capacity  and  energy  performance.12  This \nsystem is based on prescriptive rules and codes, rather than on a more appropriate centralized \nresearch and decentralized performance evaluation basis. Particular weaknesses of Mongolian \nschools are the preponderance of flat roofs (especially prone to leakage), the high propensity of \nwalls for moisture and water intake, and poor heating systems. Insulation in schools is usually \nminimal,  causing  huge  heat  losses  and  extremely  high  heating  costs.  Despite  this,  MOECS\u2019s \ntraditional approaches to this problem stress increasing heat supply to address deficits, rather \nthan  increasing  efficiency  of  energy  utilization  by  improving  heating  systems  and  insulation. \nSchool foundations are also prone to structural failure due to the freezing of excessive moisture \nintake as a result of inadequate storm water drainage. Other systemwide problems include the \nalmost complete lack of fire-safety systems, widespread use of toxic lead-based paint, as well \nas problems with ventilation and air quality, especially with increasing recourse being made to \nwood-and coal-burning stoves in school dormitories.  \n \n12. \nElectrical supply is often erratic in schools and kindergartens, especially in rural areas. \nPower is sourced either from the national grid or connection to a district power plant operated by \ndiesel. Where the latter is used, power cuts are frequent as many communities face difficulties \nin meeting the expense of diesel fuel. Alternative energy sources such as wind or solar power \n\n                                                 \n9   The GER can exceed 100% when children who are outside the normal age group enroll in a particular grade (e.g.,  \n\nwhen 9 year olds enroll in grade 1, which is intended for 8-year olds) \n\n10  A gender gap in favor of female enrolments is rather unique to Mongolia, and in part reflects perceived opportunity \n\ncosts, as school time conflicts with boys\u2019 ability to contribute to household income by working as herders.  \n\n11 From 1995 to 2000, 181,000 people over 5 (4.7% of the total) became internal migrants, with Ulaanbaatar alone \nexperiencing  a  net  gain  of  75,000  people.  Other  areas  experiencing  net  inflows  included  the  mostly  urbanized \nDarhan-Uul and Orkhon aimags with net inflows of 4,900 and 9,700 persons respectively. (Source: National Survey \nOffice Population and Housing Census 2000, National Results) \n\n12  Many  rural  schools  rely  on  inefficient  coal-fired  heating;  daily  use  per  school  can  be  as  high  as  7  tons  of  coal. \n\nGenerally, coal dust is used which must be transported at great expense over vast distances.  \n\n\f \n\n \n4\n\n \n\nare used only to a small degree, despite high suitability for Mongolian conditions,13 due to lack \nof resources for the necessary capital investment. Within schools, electrical systems are often \ndefective due to their exposure to moisture. As wiring is generally embedded in solid concrete, \nits  repair  and  replacement  is  practically  impossible.  Schools  generally  respond  by  installing \nexposed impromptu wiring, which is usually extremely dangerous and a clear fire hazard. \n \n13. \nPoor  water  supply  is  another  major  systemic  deficiency.  Piped  systems  are  rare  and \nwater  is  normally  delivered  to  school  tanks  by  animal,  by  truck  or  by  hand.  Few  schools\u2013-\nincluding  boarding  schools\u2013have  functioning  internal  plumbing.  Hot  water  is  not  generally \navailable  for  washing,  and  lavatory  facilities  are  normally  pit  latrines  located  in  the  school \ngrounds.  This  lack  of  sanitary  facilities  poses  significant  hygienic  problems,  especially  for  the \nresidents  of  school  dormitories.  In  addition,  the  inconvenience  posed  by  lack  of  sanitary \nfacilities\u2013-in boarding schools in particular\u2013-can be a significant factor in a student\u2019s decision to \ndrop out of school. \n \n14. \nThe building stock is also being eroded by the lack of any systematic approach to capital \nmaintenance or repair. Lack of funds and low technical expertise have led to ad hoc approaches \nto tackle individual problems after they occur. However, as architectural, structural, mechanical \nand electrical problems are often interrelated a piecemeal approach will be inadequate to fully \naddress  a  building\u2019s  problems.  As  such  there  needs  to  be  a  shift  toward  a  holistic  system  for \nproblem identification, repair and maintenance to successfully rehabilitate and improve longevity \nof Mongolia\u2019s schools. A full analysis of the needs and constraints of Mongolia\u2019s school facilities \nis in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n \n \n15. \nPrincipal  constraints  on  improving  educational  quality  include  the  high  proportion  of \nteachers who are employed without the training or credentials for the level or subjects that they \nare  teaching.  This  is  particularly  true  in  rural  aimags  (provinces)  where  the  proportion  of \nteachers  without  appropriate  training  is  over  18%  in  Dornod,  Umnogobi,  and  Selenge.  By \ncomparison, rates in Ulaanbaatar are just over 4%. Rates also vary greatly by subject, with high \nproportions of uncertified teachers employed for English (15%) and Kazakh languages14 (19%), \nas well as for the vocationally oriented labor training (41%). Shortages in these areas are often \ndue  to  the  inability  of  the  education  sector  to  compete  with  the  private  sector  to  employ \npersonnel  with  these  skills.  Continued  emphasis,  therefore,  needs  to  be  placed  on  improving \nteachers\u2019  remuneration  and  working  conditions,  but  also  to  provide  support  for  upgrading  the \nqualifications and skills of the nonprofessional teachers currently employed.  \n \n16. \nThe  Mongolian  academic  curriculum  comprises  18  different  subject  areas.  Pupils  in \nprimary  education  participate  in  up  to  10  subject  areas,  including  Mongolian  language, \nmathematics,  natural  sciences,  history  and  social  studies,  as  well  as  music  and  fine  arts.  In \nsecondary  education,  pupils  participate  in  up  to  14  subject  areas,  which  include  sciences, \nlanguages,  humanities,  arts,  and  informatics.  This  complex  curriculum  requires  an  extensive \nand varied resource base including teachers, learning materials, and learning resources such as \nscience laboratories and information and communication technologies (ICT) facilities. Ensuring \nthe  full  complement  for  schools  in  rural  provinces  proves  difficult  given  reduced  public \nexpenditure,  as  compared  with  when  the  overall  curriculum  was  designed;  unwillingness  of \n\nEducational Quality and Attainment \n\n4. \n\n                                                 \n13 Many parts of Mongolia receive over 300 days of sunlight annually, providing excellent potential for solar power. In \n\naddition, schools located in the relatively open steppe areas stand to benefit from wind power systems. \n14 Approximately 5% of the Mongolian population are Kazakhs, who live mainly in Bayan Olgii and Nalaikh. \n\n\f \n\n \n5\n\n \n\nteachers  to  work  in  remoter  areas  and  in  difficult  conditions;  and  physical  constraints  such  as \nlack  of  electricity,  and  poor  learning  and  residential  conditions  in  schools.  The  result  is  that \neducational attainment of rural pupils is 18% lower than their urban counterparts.15 Attainment \nlevels  of  pupils  living  at  home  exceed  those  of  children  living  in  school  dormitories,  largely \nbecause  of  the  very  difficult  living  conditions  in  the  latter,  which  acts  against  children  from \npoorer families who comprise the majority of dormitory residents.  \n \n17. \nAs  most  school  graduates  do  not  proceed  to  vocational  training  or  higher  education,  it \nhas become especially important to attune the academic curriculum to labor market needs. This \nis particularly true for science education, which could be given a more practical orientation and \nuse more student-centered methodologies. In addition, the Government has identified a demand \nfor  vocational  education  to  be  integrated  within  the  academic  curriculum,  to  better  prepare \ngraduates for finding employment and to retain boys in secondary education. \n \n18. \nAvailability  of  textbooks  and  learning  materials  is  another  key  factor  underlying \neducational  quality.  In  the  past  decade  Mongolia  has  become  the  forerunner  among  Asian \ntransition  countries  in  education  publishing  with  excellent  progress  made  in  developing  new \ntitles  characterized  by  high  technical  and  pedagogical  quality,  and  depoliticization  of  content, \nand undertaken in partnership with the private sector. Private sector publishing is relatively well \ndeveloped for a post-socialist country but is still limited, with a total of 6 publishing houses and 6 \ncombined publishers and printers. Lack of funding has meant, however, shortages of textbooks \nin  schools  are  serious.  In  SY1999/2000,  for  example,  7  of  34  planned  new  titles  were  not \npublished. Textbook distribution has major problems, with aimags responsible for collecting their \nallocations from Ulaanbaatar directly, a system that imposes the highest costs on the remotest, \nand often poorest, regions. \n \n \n \nOverall responsibility for the delivery of education services rests with MOECS, which is \n19. \nmainly involved in policy and planning. Management and administration of the school system is \nundertaken by province, city, and district governments. A depiction of the sector\u2019s management \nstructure as well as the MOECS organization chart is in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  Mongolia\u2019s education expenditure is among the highest of the transition countries, partly \nbecause  of  the  high  costs  of  delivering  services  in  a  vast,  sparsely  populated  territory  with \nextreme  climatic  conditions.  The  Education  Law  of  1995  provides  for  at  least  20%  of  total \nbudget revenue to be allocated for education. However, this has not been achievable given tight \nbudgetary  constraints.  Although  education  expenditures  have  been  rising,  they  have  yet  to \nreach levels experienced in 1996. Education expenditures over time are provided in Appendix 3. \nState education expenditure amounted to 19.1% of total public outlays in 2000, or 7.9% of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP).  Local  governments,  particularly  at  the  aimag  level,  play  a  dominant \nrole  in  financing  education,  accounting  for  68.7%  of  total  public  education  expenditure, \ncompared  with  31.3%  allocated  from  the  central  Government  budget.  Primary  and  secondary \neducation  received  the  largest  share  of  funding  among  education  subsectors,  at  48.8%  of  the \ntotal,  with  preschool  education  receiving  17.6%.  Higher  education  and  vocational  education \naccounted for 17.8% and 2%.  \n \n\nEducation Planning, Management, and Finance \n\n5. \n\n                                                 \n15 Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (MOECS) of Mongolia/United Nation Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF)/ United \nNations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO),  2000.  Monitoring  Learning  Achievement \nStudy. \n\n\f \n\n \n6\n\n \n\nTo  promote  universal  access,  basic  education  in  Mongolia  is  free.  With  most  poor \n21. \nchildren  already  enrolled  in  education,  the  Government  has  not  specifically  adopted  propoor \nresource allocation strategies for formal education, although it has increased funding shares to \nbasic education more than all other sectors with the exception of higher education; increasing \nexpenditures  154%  from  1996  to  2000.  However,  to  reach  out-of-school  children  the \nGovernment has adopted pro-poor planning in its Education Sector Strategy 2000-2005 (ESS), \nwith $1.4 million foreseen from 2000 to 2005 for this purpose. \n \n22.  Within  preschool,  primary,  and  secondary  education,  the  central  budget  finances \ntextbook publishing and printing, stipends, pupils\u2019 participation in international competitions and \nfinal examination costs. Local government budgets finance preschool, primary, and secondary \neducation. Expenditure projections are calculated on the basis of a standard variable cost per \npupil,16  factoring  in  expected  enrolment  rates.  If  local  governments  experience  shortfalls  in \nexpected budgetary revenue for education, they are entitled to receive grants from the central \nGovernment  to  fill  these  gaps.  However,  funds  are  provided  on  a  block  grant  basis,  which \ncommonly  leads  to  these  additional  revenues  being  spent  for  sectors  other  than  education, \nthereby  exacerbating  the  budget  deficits  being  experienced  by  the  education  sector.  Concern \nabout  the  equity  of  local  financing  for  education,  must  be  addressed  in  the  context  of  wider \nbudgetary and governance reform measures. \n \nSchools  have  substantial  autonomy  in  managing  their  own  financial  affairs  within  the \n23. \nconfines  of  approved  budgets  and  actual  cashflow.  The  bulk  of  their  expenditure  is  for  salary \nand utility costs, including heating. The latter typically accounts for 40% plus of school budget \nexpenditure  due  to  strong  demand  for  heating  combined  with  very  poor  efficiency  in  energy \nutilization.  Few  funds  remain  for  physical  investment  or  maintenance  (excluding  equipment), \nand in 1998 just $520,000 was spent in Mongolia\u2019s 18 rural aimags, far below the levels needed \nto maintain Mongolia\u2019s extensive education infrastructure.  \n \n \n \n24. \nProjections of future enrolments are critical for effective education planning. In 1998, the \nestimated population of Mongolia was 2.4 million of whom 36.6% were between 5 and 19 years \nof age. In the same year, population growth was estimated at 1.4% per annum, a sharp fall from \n2.7%  in  1990.  This  decrease  implies  that  the  preschool-age  population  will  fall  from  today\u2019s \n233,000  to  just  185,000  in  SY2004/05.  Plans  for  restoring  access  to  preschool  education  will, \ntherefore, need to reflect the decreasing number of children in this age group. \n \n25. \nNew enrolments in primary education are also expected to fall from 56,497 in SY2000/01 \nto  46,054  in  SY2004/05.  However,  an  increase  can  be  expected  in  secondary  education \nenrolment from SY2000/01 to SY2003/04 of over 30,000 new pupils. Thereafter, enrolments are \nexpected  to  decline.  These  trends  can  be  expected  to  reduce  pressure  on  primary  education, \nbut  to  further  strain  the  capacity  of  the  secondary  education  subsector,  which  is  comparably \nmore resource intensive.  \n \nRecent  large-scale  internal  migration  from  rural  areas  to  towns  and  cities  has  caused \n26. \nmajor imbalances in educational service provision. Schools in urban centers have seen demand \nfor  services  increase  substantially,  while  many  rural  schools  are  now  operating  well  below \n\nDemographic Situation \n\n6. \n\n                                                 \n16 The aggregate unit cost for primary and secondary pupils in 1999 was $61 equivalent (disaggregated statistics are \nnot available). For preschool children, the unit cost was $132 equivalent. This compares with $155 equivalent and \n$103 equivalent in higher and vocational education. \n\n\f \n\n \n7\n\n \n\ncapacity as a result of the outflows from their catchment areas. The result is a major distortion in \nthe geographical provision of education services, which should now be reoriented to focus more \non  the  increasing  population  centers  and  outlying  areas.  To  allow  this,  substantial  additional \ninvestments in education facilities in areas of increasing demand are essential. \n \n\n7. \n\nSocioeconomic Context \n\n \n27. \nIn  1990,  Mongolia  initiated  far-reaching  economic  reforms,  linked  to  its  overall  political \nand social transformation. The Government established private property rights, privatized state \nassets,  and  liberalized  prices  and  trade.    By  1993,  90%  of  livestock  had  been  privatized.  The \nshock of the reforms, combined with the withdrawal of aid from the Soviet Union\u2013-amounting to \nthe  equivalent  of  30%  of  GDP\u2013-as  well  as  the  loss  of  concessional  supplies  of  raw  materials \nand  the  guaranteed  Council  for  Mutual  Economic  Cooperation  (COMECON)  export  markets \nresulted in a dramatic decline in all economic indicators in the early years of the transition.  GDP \nfell by over 9% in both 1991 and 1992.  The 1989 GDP per capita figure of $1,645 fell to $329 \nby 1995 and had risen only to $450 by 1998 when early transition declines began reversing as \nmacroeconomic  stability  took  hold  and  limited  economic  growth  returned.  Agricultural  output \ndiminished  by  50%  between  1990  and  1993,  while  industrial  output  fell  by  33%.  Inflation \nreached  325%  in  1993.  Government  revenues  shrank.  And  real  wages  in  industry  and \nagriculture fell by 20% and nearly 33%.  \n \n28. \nThe  economic  contraction  and  the  concomitant  decline  in  social  sector  expenditures \nhave had a profoundly negative impact on the lives of most Mongolians. Prior to the transition, \npoverty  was  considered  to  be  low  in  Mongolia,  although  specific  data  were  not  collected.  In \ncontrast,  in  1995,  36.3%  of  the  population  lived  below  the  national  poverty  line  of  $17  per \nmonth.17 About 50% of those living in poverty (about 18 % of the total population) subsisted on a \nmonthly income below $10. Recent figures suggest that while the growth in poverty levels has \nstabilized,  those  living  in  poverty  are  becoming  poorer.  The  vulnerable  include  herding \nhouseholds with less than 100 livestock,18 the unemployed, those without a basic education, the \nelderly,  the  disabled,  street  children,  orphans  and  households  headed  by  single  parents  with \nmany  children.  Women  are  disproportionately  represented  in  the  last  category.  In  1998,  the \nnumber of households headed by women comprised 10.2% of all households, 25% of all very \npoor  households,  and  18.3%  of  poor  households.  The  number  of  single  mothers  with  children \naged below 16 grew from 32,377 in 1995 to 40,653 in 1999, an increase of 26%.19 \n \nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\nThe ESS20 provides the principal policy and planning framework for the education sector. \n29. \nIts  stress  on  universal  access  to  education,  including  free  basic  education,  has  a  strong  pro-\npoor  bias.  The  ESS  builds  on  ESDP  policy  reforms  as  well  as  on  other  national  strategies, \ndescribed  in  Appendix  4.  Priority  areas  include  (i)  alleviation  of  deficiencies  with  educational \nfacilities;  (ii)  teacher  training  and  retraining;  (iii)  curriculum  development,  and  (iv)  provision  of \ntextbooks and learning materials. These priorities are appropriate for tackling the problems that \nthe  sector  faces  in  restoring  universal  primary  enrolment  rates,  improving  and  modernizing \neducational  content  and  services,  as  well  as  improving  the  sustainability  of  a  system  that  is \nproving  expensive  to  maintain  in  a  liberalized  economy  and  society.  The  ESS  calls  for \n\n                                                 \n17 Government of Mongolia.

Although, \nsubstantial  support  has  been  secured,  many  aid-financed  interventions  are  still  undertaken \noutside the ESS framework, thereby reducing potential for effective coordination. The SEDP as \nthe  single  largest  aid  or  externally-financed  intervention  will  provide  a  major  boost  to  the  ESS \nframework  and  should  act  as  a  catalyst  for  other  development  agencies  to  ensure  that \nassistance is provided within this common policy framework. \n \nUnder the ESS, with support from the ESDP and other projects, good progress has been \n30. \nmade  in  promoting  teacher  training,  improving  educational  quality,  and  improving  the \nsustainability  of  educational  infrastructure  by  a  program  of  closing  and  merging  primary  and \nsecondary  schools.  This  has  resulted  in  the  creation  of  the  \u201ccomplex\u201d  and  inter-soum  school \nforms.22  The  result  has  been  to  reduce  the  dilution  in  education  financing.  However,  major \nadditional investment is still required for the remaining schools. About 30% of rural schools are \nin  dangerous  condition  and  over  80%  need  major  repairs.  In  urban  areas,  new  facilities  are \nneeded  to  cater  for  demand  increases  as  a  result  of  the  heavy  net  migrant  inflows.  These \nproblems have arisen due to a lack of domestic investment funds, as well as the inability of most \nactive assistance agencies to mobilize adequate levels of financing for civil works. Another root \ncause  is  the  sheer  unsustainability  of  maintaining  current  facilities,  which  were  built  using \nimported  standard  designs,  often  poorly  suited  for  Mongolia\u2019s  climatic  conditions.  With  large-\nscale  internal  migration  in  recent  years,  many  schools  in  rural  areas  are  now  operating  below \ncapacity and repair is now uneconomic. With many schools coming to an end of their life spans, \nthe development of a new generation of school facilities should begin. These should offer good \nlearning and residential environments, be energy efficient, be appropriate to Mongolian climatic \nconditions, and be easy to maintain. In the growing urban areas, a parallel need is to develop \nnew facilities designed according to new, more efficient building standards and stressing energy \nefficiency and direct accessibility to the new, usually poorer, migrants.  \n \nThe ESS provides a good overall framework for ongoing development and operation of \n31. \nthe education sector until 2005. Within this framework more systematic policy development and \nplanning  is  needed  for  individual  aspects  of  the  education  sector,  including  (i)  facility \nmaintenance and development, (ii) provision of learning materials (especially to foster the role of \nthe private sector), (iii) staff recruitment and management, (iv) quality assurance systems, and \n(v)  equity  of  financing  systems  for  pro-poor  resource  allocations.  These  issues  need  to  be \naddressed in the ESS\u2019s successor, for which preparation will commence in 2003. \n \nThe  amendment  to  the  Law  on  Education  in  2002  has  led  to  a  fundamental  policy \n32. \nchange with a move to an 11-year system of basic education based on 5 years of compulsory \nprimary  education,  2  years  of  compulsory  lower  secondary,  and  2  years  of  upper  secondary \neducation. This reform will bring the education system more in line with neighboring countries, \nespecially the transition countries, and will bring down the starting age for primary school to 7, \nwhich is more in accordance with international standards.  \n \n33. \nThe  proposed  amendment  also  envisages  integration  of  vocational  education  subjects \ninto  mainstream  education.  With  a  50%  reduction  in  demand  for  programs  in  the  traditional \nvocational  education  and  training  subsector  since  1990,  providing  modernized  and  more \n\n                                                 \n21 Comprising (i) $25 million for school facilities and equipment, (ii) $4.3 million for teacher training, (iii) $1.2 million for \n\neducational quality, and (iv) $1.6 million for educational research, for expenditures up to 2005. \n\n22 \u201cComplex\u201d schools typically provide services at the aimag level and \u201cInter-soum\u201d schools cater for multiple soums. \n\nPreviously, education policy was to maintain one school for each soum. \n\n\f \n\n \n9\n\n \n\nrelevant services to match the changing demand patterns has become a high priority. However, \nthis  reform  has  been  hindered  by  the  inability  of  vocational  training  institutions  to  reorient \nthemselves for the more flexible needs of the market-driven labor markets and their services still \ntend  to  be  excessively  specialized  and  formalized.  In  response,  the  Government  has  signaled \nits willingness to enter into partnerships with the private sector to develop and deliver training for \nadults,  for  which  it  is  receiving  support  under  the  ADB-financed  Social  Security  Sector \nDevelopment Program.23 At the same time, the Government is aiming to meet the demand for \ninitial  vocational  education  services  by  integrating  such  programs  into  general  education \ncurricula,  given  the  increasing  value  placed  on  general  competencies  in  the  developing  labor \nmarkets, as well as to improve the financial sustainability of vocational education services.  \n \nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n34. \nADB has been a major provider of assistance to basic education since the early 1990s. \nThree  TAs  have  been  financed  for  policy,  strategy  development,  and  capacity  building.  The \nongoing  ESDP  (footnote  1)  has  financed  school  rationalization  and  upgrading,  textbook \nprovision,  teacher  training,  and  capacity  building.  During  the  implementation  of  the  ESDP  and \nstarting from the conceptualization of the SEDP scope, ADB has maintained close cooperation \nwith  the  Embassy  of  Japan  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  regarding \ngrant assistance from the Government of Japan to the education sector. ADB has also worked \nclosely with the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) in design and development of SEDP. NDF is \ncurrently financing the modernization of the vocational training system in the framework of the \nSocial  Security  Sector  Development  Program.  The  Government  of  Japan  is  financing  the \nupgrading of urban schools, as well as support for policy development and ICT. ADB has also \nworked very closely with CIDA whose feasibility study into school construction and rehabilitation \ncontributed extensively to  the SEDP\u2019s design. The Canada Fund is also piloting approaches to \nrural  school  rehabilitation,  which  will  yield  vital  information  for  the  SEDP.  The  United  Nations \nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  is  active  in  school  rehabilitation,  nonformal  education,  and \ndevelopment  of  community-based  approaches  to  primary  education.  The  Danish  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  Assistance  has  financed  the  development  of  40  rural  schools, \nalthough additional support is not planned. The Soros Foundation has an ongoing program for \nmodernizing  teacher  training,  educational  publishing,  and  ICT  development;  much  of  this \nsupport  has  been  implemented  in  close  concert  with  related  ESDP  activities.  The  World  Bank \nhas financed small-scale renovations of schools under the Poverty Alleviation Program, as well \nas a number of policy-oriented, cross-cutting interventions including a public expenditure review \nand  development  of  the  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper.  In  other  subsectors,  Germany  is \nproviding  support  for  modernizing  vocational  training  and  the  European  Union  has  provided \nsupport for quality improvement of higher education. An overview of externally-financed projects \nin the education sector is in Appendix 5. \n \nTo  date,  externally  financed  projects  have  been  planned  and  executed  on  a  bilateral \n35. \nbasis between the respective development agencies and Government, limiting coordination and \ncoherence  between  the  different  projects  and  raising  transaction  costs.  During  a  meeting  of \nagencies  providing  assistance  to  education  hosted  by  the  ADB  Resident  Mission  in  February \n2002  during  SEDP  appraisal,  an  understanding  was  reached  that  cooperation  mechanisms \nneeded improving and that interventions should be fully in accordance with Government policies \nand  under  their  leadership.  At  the  initiative  of  ADB,  World  Bank  and  UNICEF  supported  the \nproposal  to  gradually  move  to  introduce  of  sector  wide  approaches  (SWAPs)  in  the  education \n\n                                                 \n23 Loan Nos. 1836/1837 Social Security Sector Development Program, approved on 28 August 2001, for $12 million. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n10\n\n \n\nsector. The planned Third Education project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will work \nwith the Government and other agencies to develop a successor to the current ESS. \n \n36. \nThe  SEDP  will  be  implemented  by  three  of  the  principal  development  agencies  in  the \neducation  sector.  It  will  also  build  closely  on  the  partnership  established  with  the  Soros \nFoundation  during  the  ESDP  in  capacity  building  and  quality  improvement.  The  SEDP  will \ncoordinate  closely  with  UNICEF,  which  is  financing  small-scale  renovations  of  rural  schools. \nADB  will  also  coordinate  with  the  World  Bank,  which  is  preparing  an  advisory  program  for \neducation.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  commenced  discussions  on  fielding  joint  missions \nand  other  means  of  information  exchange  to  ensure  maximum  transparency  and  cooperation, \nwith the aim of achieving the most optimal allocation of resources between the two institutions.  \n \nD. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n37. \nThe  SEDP  design  reflects  the  extensive  experience  gained  in  implementing  the \nsuccessful  ESDP  and  from  other  interventions.24  The  success  of  the  ESDP  can  largely  be \nattributed  to  the  excellent  working  relationship  with  MOECS  and  other  development  agencies; \nthe high performance standards of the project implementation unit and high commitment levels \nby  the  political  establishment,  government,  and  civil  society.  General  lessons  learned  include \nthe need to maintain a transparent and inclusive approach to project implementation to ensure \nappropriate design of project activities and continued public support; this was particularly true in \nthe case of the agreed redundancies of education staff under the ESDP, to which many sections \nof  Mongolian  society  reacted  critically  as  a  result  of  inadequate  public  consultation  and \ninformation.  As  many  ESDP  activities  were  enhanced  through  cooperation  with  Soros \nFoundation activities in the fields of publishing, teacher training and utilization of ICT in schools, \nit will be important for ADB to build on such partnerships and to expand coordination with other \nexternally  financed  activities.  In  the  case  of  the  SEDP,  the  cofinancing  arrangement  with  the \nGovernment of Japan and NDF brings together the three major development partners who are \nworking to develop educational infrastructure, a partnership that will bring substantial economies \nof  scale  as  well  as  opportunities  for  information  exchanges  and  technology  transfer.  Another \nfactor  learned  from  the  ESDP  was  that  its  adherence  with  national  legislation  and  policy \nensured  sustained  political  support.  Another  lesson  learned  is  the  need  to  include  support  for \npreschool  education  with  that  for  primary  and  secondary  education.  As  Mongolian  children  do \nnot  start  school  until  the  age  of  7  or  8,  kindergarten  provides  a  vital  educational  foundation  in \nthe  child\u2019s  early  years,  and  is  equivalent  to  the  primary  school  program  in  many  countries. \nDespite  this,  support  for  kindergartens  has  been  limited,  resulting  in  continued  shortages  of \nthese  essential  services.  The  ESDP  and  other  interventions  have  also  revealed  the  need  to \ninclude  rural  areas  in  projects.  Finally,  large-scale  internal  migration  necessitates  revising  the \ngeographical distribution of educational services. With a move away from more remote soums, \ntargeting of project activities must anticipate the likely ongoing demographic movements. \n \n38. \nSpecific  lessons  learned  will  be  applied  for  the  rehabilitation  of  schools.  These  include \nthe  need  for  a  more  comprehensive  approach  to  rehabilitation  to  permit  a  more  substantial \nextension of the school\u2019s lifespan. Even if initial costs will be higher with this strategy, reduced \nenergy  and  maintenance  costs  as  well  as  lower  replacement  costs  will  ensure  that  this  is  the \nmost economic approach in the medium to long term. Valuable lessons were also learned in the \nfield  of  educational  publishing:  although  the  quality  of  new  ESDP  titles  was  high,  the  limited \n\n                                                 \n24 As confirmed by education studies in Mongolia including The Education Sector Strategy Study 2000-2005 (footnote \n20)  and  CIDA\u2019s  Mongolia  School  Rehabilitation  and  Construction  Feasibility  Study  of  200  and  MOECS\u2019s  2001 \ncomprehensive inventory of educational assets. \n\n\f \n\n \n11\n\n \n\nprivate  sector  involvement  in  this  field  limits  greater  diversity  and  higher  quality  in  publishing. \nThe  SEDP  will,  therefore,  promote  further  private  sector  involvement  in  textbook  provision. \nAnother valuable lesson relates to the introduction of ICT within the education sector. Although \nthis is of high priority to the Government and the general public, the impact has been limited by \nthe lack of a definitive concept or strategy for ICT integration into education. Through innovative \napproaches to ICT adoption and dialogue with other development agencies on lessons learned, \nthe SEDP will help to support this critical process of defining priorities and viable strategies. \n \nE. \n\nADB's Sector Strategy  \n\n39. \nThe  SEDP\u2019s  focus  on  basic  education  is  fully  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic \nframework\u2019s  objective  of  contributing  to  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  which  aim  to \nachieve  universal  primary  education  in  all  countries  by  2015.  The  Poverty  Partnership \nAgreement signed by Government and ADB on 24 March 2000 earmarks ADB investment in the \nsocial sector as a means to maintain and improve the competitiveness of the labor force. These \npriorities are reflected in the country strategy and program update (2002 to 2004), which calls \nfor  improving  access  to  educational  services  for  the  poor  by  developing/rehabilitating  schools, \nimproving delivery mechanisms, and maintaining/enhancing the quality of educational services. \nThese provisions are fully in line with the ESS.  \n \nOperating  within  this  policy  framework,  the  SEDP  will  support  the  development  of \n40. \neducational  services  both  in  rural  and  urban  areas  facing  challenges  in  educating  migrant \nchildren.  Support  for  developing  school  infrastructure  will  allow  increased  participation  in \neducation,  especially  for  children  from  poor  families  who  rely  on  dormitory  accommodation  to \nattend school. Improved quality of education will also lead to increased enrolments, as the long-\nterm benefits accruing from education rise as compared to the short-term benefits from entering \nthe  labor  market.  Lastly,  improving  education  management  will  allow  for  more  sustained \nprovision of quality educational services. \n \n41. \n In cooperation with other development partners and under Government leadership, ADB \nwill seek to develop a new pro-poor medium- and long-term policy and planning framework for \neducation  to  succeed  the  ESS,  with  the  intention  to  gradually  move  to  SWAPs.  TA  to  support \nthis process is planned for 2003. \n \nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nADB has maintained a close policy dialogue with the Government since the early 1990s, \n42. \nwhich has, inter alia, resulted in the adoption of the current ESS, which defines the objectives \nand priorities for the SEDP. The ongoing dialogue also contributed to the adoption of the 1995 \nLaw  on  Education,  and  the  ESDP  financed  major  reforms  to  school  forms  and  education \nprograms  within  that  framework.  ADB  was  also  consulted  in  the  amendment  of  the  Law  on \nEducation in 2002, which provides for an expansion of primary education from 4 to 5 years in \nline  with  neighboring \nthe \nimplementation  of  this  new  policy.  ADB  has  also  explored  the  potential  for  privatization  in  the \neducation sector with the Government, supporting initiatives to explore contracting out selected \nancillary  services  but  advising  caution  on  the  extent  of  privatization,  especially  in  poor  rural \nareas  where  provision  of  such  services  is  unlikely  to  be  profitable.  With  agreement  on  overall \npolicy directions, the focus of dialogue in recent years has also shifted to more specific aspects \nof the education sector. \n \n\ntransition  countries.  ADB  has  been  requested \n\nto  support \n\n\f \n\n \n12\n\n \n\nThis  has  resulted  in  an  understanding  of  the  need  to  develop  new  approaches  to \n43. \ndevelopment  and  utilization  of  educational  facilities,  including  the  introduction  of  new,  more \nefficient  and  affordable  building  standards  and  integration  of  different  forms  of  education \nservices in schools. Policy dialogue is ongoing on the issue of textbook provision and the need \nto promote private sector involvement, liberalize markets, and promote cost recovery in textbook \nprovision in secondary education. Discussions have also commenced on the role of ICT as one \nset of tools to advance specific objectives for improving education.  \n \nADB  also  initiated  a  proposal  to  move  toward  a  SWAP,  to  improve  the  efficiency  of \n44. \nresource  mobilization  and  utilization.  MOECS  has  supported  this  move,  as  have  other  major \nagencies,  including  World  Bank,  UNICEF,  and  Soros  Foundation.  ADB  has  proposed  to \nMOECS  and  other  agencies  that  a  new  sector  strategy,  to  succeed  the  current  ESS,  become \nthe major framework for the development of the SWAP. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n45. \nThe  SEDP  is  required  to  support  ongoing  national  efforts  to  promote  economic  growth \nand  to  reduce  poverty  through  the  provision  of  education  for  all  in  the  framework  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s ESS. It will address the need to continue activities commenced under the ESDP \nto increase access to quality preschool, primary, and secondary education in poorer urban and \nrural  areas.  It  will  also  continue  ESDP  activities  to  improve  efficiency  in  the  sector,  including \nsupport for greater institutional and financial stability. The SEDP is also required to support the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the achievement of social capital \ndevelopment objectives under the Poverty Partnership Agreement. \n \n46. \nThe  SEDP\u2019s  approach  is  fully  in  line  with  Mongolian  education  policy  and  will  benefit \nfrom  experience  gained  during  ESDP  implementation.  Its  implementation  in  conjunction  with \nother  major  development  partners  will  allow  it  to  benefit  from  these  agencies  a  substantial \nexperience  in  education  sector  development.  It  will  maintain  reforms  commenced  under  the \nESDP, including focusing investment on a more streamlined network of education facilities and \nby  further  supporting  the  development  of  private  sector  educational  publishing  to  increase  the \nquality  and  diversity  of  learning  materials.  Commitment  of  Government,  Parliament,  and  civil \nsociety  to  educational  reform  and  development  is  strong  and  institutional  capacity  has  proven \nitself sufficient for the management of major projects.  \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n47. \nThe  main  objective  of  the  SEDP  is  to  promote  human  development  by  developing \nuniversally  accessible  education  services,  and  strengthening  these  services.  Its  secondary \nobjective is to reduce income and deprivation poverty by improving sustainable access to quality \npreschool  and  basic  education  in  poorer  rural  and  urban  communities.  Specific  objectives  will \ninclude  (i)  improving  access  to  services  (kindergartens  and  schools),  including  children  with \ndisabilities;  (ii)  improving  the  quality  and  relevance  of  education  services;  (iii)  improving  the \nefficiency  and  effectiveness  of  education  management;  and  (iv)  enhancing  the  efficiency  of \npublic  resource  allocation  for  education  services  by  reducing  recurrent  financing  requirements \nfor operation and maintenance of education facilities, expansion of the textbook rental scheme, \nand improved accountability in education management. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n13\n\n \n\nSpecifically,  the  SEDP  will  finance  the  improvement  of  educational  services  in  poorer \n48. \nrural  areas,  where  quality  of  and  access  to  education  have  lagged  behind  other  areas.  The \nSEDP will address these issues by supporting the renewal of school and kindergarten facilities, \nwhich  are  accessible  to  the  poor,  to  improve  learning  environments,  guarantee  operations \nduring  winter,  and  provide  decent  accommodation  for  boarding  pupils.  The  SEDP  will  also \ndirectly  tackle  the  major  shortages  in  educational  services  in  rapidly  growing  urban  areas  by \nbuilding new schools, that  will directly serve\u2013-and be located in\u2013-poorer communities and will \nset new standards in performance and efficiency. In addition, the SEDP will improve the quality \nof educational services to the poor by addressing shortages of learning materials, improving the \nintegration  of  ICT  into  education,  modernizing  science  education,  integrating  vocational \neducation, and by improving teacher training services. The sustainability of educational services \nwill also be addressed through a capacity building program for education administrations.  \n \n49. \nSEDP  activities  will  be  implemented  nationwide,  with  the  greatest  emphasis  on \nimproving  educational  services  to  the  poorest  communities.  The  SEDP  will  have  three \ncomponents:  school  and  kindergarten  development,  quality  improvement,  and  education \nmanagement. \n \n\n1. \n\nSchool and Kindergarten Development  \n\na. \n\nUrban School Development (Government of Japan) \n\n50. \nTo  resolve  problems  posed  by  insufficient  and  deteriorating  educational  facilities  in  the \nnation\u2019s  three  major  urban  centers,  schools  in  Darhan-Uul,  Orkhon,  and  Ulaanbaatar  were \nidentified for improvement. The Government of Japan is financing the upgrading of 16 schools \nin Ulaanbaatar. Works at seven schools have been completed and are under way in five others. \nIn  2000,  the  Mongolian  Government  asked  the  Government  of  Japan  to  finance  the \nrehabilitation  of  a  selected  number  of  schools  in  the  major  cities  in  Darhan-Uul  and  Orkhon. \nJICA  completed  the  final  due  diligence  (the  detailed  basic  design)  on  the  requested  school \nrehabilitation for implementation during 2002-2004.  \n \n51. \nThe  new  schools  developed  under  this  component  will  be  built  to  far  more  economical \nstandards  than  with  existing  designs,  requiring  60%  less  floor  space  for  the  same  student \ncapacity, cutting back on per student operating and maintenance costs, while also improving the \nlearning  environment.  The  emphasis  on  reduced  energy  consumption  and  maintenance \nrequirements  will  result  in  lower  operating  costs  and  maintenance  requirements  allowing  for \nmore sustained education provision. To ensure sustainability of building designs, requirements \nwill  be  based  on  locally  available  materials.  Technologies  and  designs  introduced  in  this \nsubcomponent will serve as models for the development of new education facilities in Mongolia. \n \n\nb. \n\nRural School Rehabilitation\u2013-Combined Primary and Secondary \n(ADB/Government) \n\n52. \nAt  least  60  combined  primary  and  secondary  schools  in  poorer  rural  provinces  will  be \ncomprehensively rehabilitated and furnished under the SEDP to improve learning environments, \nallow year-round operation, reduce expenditures on energy costs, and ensure acceptable living \nconditions in school dormitories. Rehabilitation works will include provision for heating systems \nand  insulation,  pitched  roofs,  sanitary  systems,  electrical  systems  as  well  as  replacement  of \ndoors  and  windows.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  support  MOECS  in  planning, \ndesigning,  and  supervising  rehabilitation  works  to  ensure  their  quality.  School  staff  will  be \ninvolved in the planning and supervisory process to ensure the relevance of support provided. \n\n\f \n\n \n14\n\n \n\nCommunity  representatives  and  parents  will  be  consulted  to  ascertain  the  scope  for  direct \ncommunity  support  for  school  development,  including  provision  of  labor  and  materials  for \nsimpler  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  works.  Works  will  be  timed  to  coincide  with  the  long \nsummer  holidays  to  minimize  disruption  to  the  school\u2019s  operations.  To  facilitate  access  for \nstudents  with  physical  disabilities,  facilities  will  also  be  adapted  where  practicable  including \nprovision  of  civil  works,  furniture,  and  equipment  as  required.  MOECS  has  provided  an \nindicative list of schools to be rehabilitated. Final selection will, however, be made on a rolling \nannual basis by MOECS, with ADB concurrence, given the prospects for changing situations of \nindividual  schools  during  SEDP  implementation.  Works  will  be  implemented  on  a  region  by \nregion  basis  for  maximum  efficiency.  Final  school  selection  will  be  made  using  the  criteria  in \nAppendix 6. Support will also be provided for minor renovation works \u2013 not exceeding $20,000 - \nto at least 20 schools to improve learning environments and operating efficiency. \n \n\nc. \n\nRural School and Kindergarten Rehabilitation and Renewable \nEnergy Conversion (NDF/Government) \n\nAt  least  40  kindergartens  and  combined  primary/secondary  schools  in  poorer  rural \n53. \nprovinces will be comprehensively rehabilitated and furnished, and be converted to renewable \nenergy  systems  (including  solar  and  wind  power  systems).  This  will  permit  improved  learning \nenvironments,  allow  year-round  operation,  reduce  expenditures  on  energy  costs,  and  ensure \nacceptable living conditions in school dormitories. Rehabilitation works will include provision for \nheating  systems  and  insulation,  pitched  roofs,  sanitary  systems,  electrical  systems,  and \nreplacement of doors and windows. A study will be conducted of energy needs and renewable \nenergy systems provided as applicable to substitute systems based on fossil fuels. Consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  to  support  MOECS  in  planning,  designing,  and  supervising \nrehabilitation  works  to  ensure  their  quality.  To  facilitate  access  for  students  with  physical \ndisabilities,  facilities  will  also  be  adapted  where  practicable  including  provision  of  civil  works, \nfurniture,  and  equipment  as  required.  Other  arrangements  will  be  as  with  the  rehabilitation  of \nrural  primary  and  secondary  schools  (para.  52).  MOECS  has  provided  an  indicative  list  of \nschools to be rehabilitated. Final selection will, however, be made on a rolling annual basis by \nMOECS with ADB and NDF concurrence, given the prospects for changing situations during the \nSEDP.  Works  will  be  organized  on  a  region  by  region  basis  for  maximum  efficiency.  Final \nselection of schools will be made using the criteria detailed in Appendix 6. \n \n\nd. \n\nConstruction of Kindergartens and Schools (ADB/Government) \n\nAt \n\nleast  6  new  energy-efficient,  modern  kindergartens/primary  schools  will  be \n54. \nconstructed  in  towns  where  existing  capacities  cannot  meet  the  demand  for  educational \nservices. These new schools will serve as models in developing a new generation of facilities to \ngradually  replace  the  current  Soviet-style  institutions.  New  institutions  will  be  designed  to  be \naccessible  to  students  with  physical  disabilities.  To  ensure  affordability,  school  designs  will \nmake  maximum  use  of  local  materials,  be  compatible  with  local  climatic  and  geographical \nconditions, and stress low maintenance technologies. Design works will be contracted to private \nsector  firms  and  consulting  services  provided  to  ensure  that  international  experience  in  cold-\nweather educational facilities\u2019 design can be taken into account. Extensive supervision services \nwill also be provided to promote quality of works rendered by contractors. MOECS has provided \nan indicative list of sites for construction of new institutions. Final selection of sites will, however, \nbe  made  on  a  rolling  annual  basis  by  MOECS  with  ADB  and  NDF  concurrence,  given  the \nprospects  for  changing  circumstances  of  individual  communities  in  the  lifetime  of  the  SEDP. \nFinal selection of sites will be made using the criteria detailed in Appendix 6. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n15\n\n \n\ne. \n\nCapacity Building for Education Facilities\u2019 Management \n(ADB/Government/Government of Japan) \n\n55. \nTo  enhance  the  quality  of  civil  works  in  the  education  sector,  the  capacity  of  the \nConstruction  Client  Unit  (CCU)  in  MOECS  for  assessment,  design,  supervision,  and \nmaintenance of civil works will be strengthened. This will include international and local training \nof key personnel, including one postgraduate scholarship, supported by on-the-job training from \nresident advisers. This will include training on needs of students with physical disabilities. CCU \nwill  also  receive  specialist  equipment  for  use  in  its  design  and  supervisory  operations.  To \nimprove  planning  for  the  education  network,  the  SEDP  will  support  the  development  of  a  pro-\npoor, short-, medium-, and long-term costed facilities plan in conjunction with other development \nagencies, to ensure that education services can be provided to the poorest communities on an \naffordable, sustainable basis. A comprehensive maintenance program will also be developed for \nnational  education  facilities,  including  training  of  school  and  provincial  staff  to  impart \nmaintenance  skills.  ADB-financed  consultants  will  coordinate  with  the  Japanese  Overseas \nCooperation  Volunteers,  comprising  five  architects  and  engineers,  to  improve  the  design  of \nschools by updating building standards and improving supervision and evaluation capacities.  \n \n\n2. \n\nQuality Improvement  \n\na. \n\nTeacher Training (ADB/Government) \n\n \n56. \nThe Project will continue activities commenced under the ESDP for the development of \noverall  in-service  training  systems,  with  emphasis  on  the  needs  of  teachers  in  rural  areas.  TA \nwill  be  provided  to  improve  quality  of  training  provision,  including  methodological  and  material \nsupport,  and  introduce  enhanced  quality  assurance  systems.  Teacher  training  advisers  will \naddress the needs of unqualified teachers as well as prepare teachers for integrating children \nwith  disabilities  into  mainstream  education.  At  least  5,000  teachers  from  kindergartens  and \nprimary and secondary schools will receive training under the SEDP for their respective subject \nareas.  The  training  systems  will  be  maintained  at  low  cost  with  maximum  recourse  made  to \nlocal  personnel,  especially  teachers  selected  on  a  competitive  basis  as  teacher  trainers,  and \nmaterials and resources to ensure that programs can be maintained after SEDP completion in \ntheir developed forms. TA will also be provided to develop medium- and long-term action plans \nfor  teacher  training,  including  identification  of  recurrent  and  investment  costs  for  the \ndevelopment  and  operation  of  the  training  system.  The  subcomponent  will  be  implemented  in \ncoordination with the Soros Foundation and UNICEF. \n \n\nb. \n\nLearning Materials\u2019 Provision (ADB/Government) \n\n \n57. \nThe SEDP will support policy development and capacity building for a more diverse and \nliberalized educational publishing system, including opening up the market for commercial sales \nof  textbooks.  This  will  include  TA  for  publishing  personnel,  including  training  of  writers, \nillustrators,  and  editors,  as  well  as  legal  and  regulatory  assistance.  The  SEDP  will  assist  the \nGovernment  in  expanding  the  current  textbook  user  charge  system  for  secondary  education\u2013-\nwith  exemptions  for  poor  students\u2013-to  increase  the  system\u2019s  financial  sustainability.  At  least \n900,000  new  textbooks  and  teachers\u2019  guides,  comprising  reprints  and  new  titles,  and \nsupplementary learning materials will be provided to primary and secondary school pupils. After \npiloting, a program of familiarization will be launched for teachers who will be working with the \nnew titles. Learning materials and toys will also be provided for at least 150 kindergartens. To \nenhance the quality and diversity of new titles, private sector publishers will be involved in the \ndevelopment  process  of  new  learning  materials.  SEDP  support  for  this  process  will  include \n\n\f \n\n \n16\n\n \n\ncapacity  building  of  MOECS,  as  well  as  training  for  writers,  illustrators,  and  editors  from  the \nprivate sector. \n \n\nc. \n\nInformation \n(ADB/Government/Government of Japan) \n\nand  Communication \n\nTechnologies \n\nIntegration \n\n \n58. \n A comprehensive review of ICT utilization in secondary education will be conducted by \nMOECS  with  support  from  a  team  of  specialists.  The  results  of  the  review  will  be  utilized  to \ndevelop  a  draft  ICT  policy,  in  cooperation  with  JICA25,  to  integrate  ICT  into  the  educational \nprocess,  including  a  detailed  and  costed  concept  and  strategy.  In  line  with  the  SEDP\u2019s  aim  to \nfacilitate  access  to  education  for  children  with  disabilities,  the  policy  will  contain  measures  for \nstrengthening  the  utilization  of  ICT  in  integrating  children  with  disabilities  into  mainstream \neducation  provision.  The  policy  will  aim  to  incorporate  ICT  into  education  programs,  with \nemphasis on rural areas. The SEDP will also strengthen the informatics curriculum for grade 8 \nto 10 students to make it more relevant to actual labor market needs. To prepare teachers for \nICT, preservice teacher training programs will be strengthened at the Pedagogical University in \nUlaanbaatar  through  staff  training,  provision  of  ICT  equipment  and  materials,  as  well  as \nspecialist advisory services. In-service training programs will also be developed at SEDP sites \nand  support  provided  for  development  of  ICT  facilities  in  at  least  40  combined  primary  and \nsecondary schools. Prior to the installation of ICT facilities, extensive training will be provided to \npedagogical staff and principals in ICT applications.  \n \n\nd. \n\nScience Education Modernization (NDF/Government) \n\n \nA  comprehensive  review  will  be  undertaken  of  science  curricula26  in  both  primary  and \n59. \nsecondary education to assess the appropriateness of its objectives, content, and methodology \nfor  the  needs  of  students  in  the  context  of  changing  labor  market  conditions.  Based  on  this \nassessment,  a  comprehensive  science  education  strategy  and  action  plan  will  be  developed \nand  will  include  recommendations  for  revising  the  curriculum  and  syllabi,  and  adapting \nmaterials, facilities, and methodologies in accordance with newly identified needs. Based on the \nplan\u2019s  provisions,  the  SEDP  will  provide  a  flexible  and  comprehensive  program  of  support  to \nmodernize  and  reform  science  education  including  upgrading  staff  training  services,  providing \nlearning materials and equipment, and revising of curricula and science programs, if needed. At \nleast 120 schools will be included in this subcomponent. \n \n\ne. \n\nVocational Education Integration (NDF/Government) \n\n \n60. \nThe SEDP will pilot a program to restore vocational education by integrating vocationally \noriented subjects into the curriculum of selected secondary schools. This will promote increased \nenrolment rate of boys, in particular, in secondary education. This subcomponent will include an \nassessment of the needs for vocational education, as well as an evaluation of the capacity for \nproviding appropriate programs in selected schools. Based on the results of the assessment, a \npilot  program  will  be  implemented  in  at  least  20  general  secondary  schools  including  advisory \nservices  for  program  development,  teacher  training,  learning  materials,  basic  learning \nequipment,  and  furniture.  The  results  of  the  pilot  will  be  assessed  and  recommendations \nprovided  for  the  dissemination  of  the  vocational  education  integration  program  in  a  vocational \neducation strategy paper, which will provide a framework for expansion, if applicable. \n\n                                                 \n25 This includes a Japanese adviser who will formulate an ICT program for the education sector to complement the \n\nADB ICT component. The service is currently scheduled for completion in August 2003. \n\n26 Including environmental studies, natural sciences, biology, physics, chemistry and geography. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n17\n\n \n\n3. \n\nEducation Management \n\na. \n\nCapacity Building for Education Management (ADB/Government) \n\n \n61. \nA program of capacity building will be provided for staff of MOECS; provincial, city, and \ndistrict  administrations;  and  kindergarten  and  school  principals  to  build  competencies  for \nplanning  and  implementing  educational  services,  as  well  as  improving  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  Particular  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  imparting  best  practices  in  educational \nmanagement from international experience, with stress on financial management. The capacity \nbuilding program will also stress the acquisition of ICT, language, and general management and \npresentation skills, as well as optimal monitoring and evaluation skills for assessing progress in \nmeeting  sector  targets  including  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  as  well  as  specific \ninterventions,  including  the  SEDP.  Postgraduate  programs  in  education  management  in \nselected institutions will be strengthened. In addition, local training institutions will be contracted \nto develop and provide training programs for trainees under the SEDP. To ensure the relevance \nof training programs, staff of target institutions will be involved in defining their goals, scope, and \ncontent.  International  and  local  expert  services  will  be  involved  in  developing  and  delivering \ntraining, which will promote the integration of international experience in the programs. Staff of \nprovincial  and  district  education  administrations  will  be  provided  with  essential  ICT  hardware \nand  software,  plus  various  office  equipment  to  enhance  their  effectiveness  in  education \nmanagement. ADB will coordinate with JICA in policy and planning support in this regard.27  \n \n\nb. \n\nProject Implementation Support (ADB/Government/NDF) \n\n \n62. \nA project management unit (PMU) will be established under MOECS to support effective \nand efficient management of the ADB and NDF-financed elements of the SEDP. The PMU will \nbe  established  on  the  basis  of  the  ESDP  project  implementation  unit  to  capitalize  on  its \nexperience  in  implementing  this  related  intervention.  An  international  project  specialist  will \nsupport  the  PMU  in  planning  and  procurement  activities,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and \norganizing training to upgrade the skills and knowledge of PMU staff. The resource base of the \nPMU will be modernized for SEDP implementation. The PMU will also coordinate with the JICA \nMongolia country office in the implementation of Japanese-financed SEDP components. \n \nC. \n\nTechnical Justification \n\nThe  SEDP\u2019s  technical  approach  to  educational  infrastructure  development  will  improve \n63. \nquality, coverage, and sustainability of services. The ESDP and other interventions have shown \nthat  a  comprehensive  approach  to  rehabilitation  is  needed  to  significantly  extend  a  facility\u2019s \nlifespan and to significantly improve the learning and residential environment. The approach will \nensure  that  the  three  essential  elements  for  effective  building  development:  heating,  moisture \nlimitation,  and  maintenance  are  catered  for  as  a  whole.  Good  heating  systems  and  insulation \nwill allow schools to operate throughout winter and reduce heating costs. Prevention of moisture \nwill  improve  heating,  protect  from  structural  damage,  and  protect  electrical  systems.  Routine \neffective maintenance will prevent costly structural problems from arising, thereby extending the \nlifespan  of  buildings.  In  addition,  the  development  of  new  facilities  under  the  SEDP  will  reflect \nbest practices from other cold climates and will make use of new building standards to achieve \noptimal levels of performance and efficiency of the new facilities. Special consideration will be \n\n                                                 \n27  This  includes  a  long-term  Japanese  adviser  in  MOECS  who  will  provide,  inter  alia,  policy  advice  for  education \n\nmanagement to complement the ADB support.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n18\n\n \n\ngiven  to  new  heating  technologies  and  techniques,  including  improved  building  design, \ninsulation, and utilization of passive solar heating methods. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  $68.5  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and  duties.

MOECS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  with  primary  responsibility  for  overall  planning \nand  coordination  of  SEDP  activities  and  for  implementing  ADB  and  NDF-financed  SEDP \nactivities.  MOECS  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  urban  school  development  activities  to  be \nfinanced by the Government of Japan. The Deputy Minister, MOECS will be the project director, \nwith  responsibility  for  providing  the  policy  and  strategic  direction  for  ADB  and  NDF-financed \nactivities.  ADB  and  NDF-financed  activities  will  be  undertaken  in  coordination  with  local \nadministrations,  provincial  and  district  local  councils  (hurals),  together  with  specialized \neducational  institutions  for  teacher  training  and  educational  research.  School  boards  will  be \nconsulted  in  planning  the  range  of  activities  in  SEDP-supported  schools.  A  multisectoral \nsteering committee, chaired by the Deputy Minister, MOECS, and comprised of representatives \nfrom  MOECS,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy,  the  Cabinet  Secretariat,  the  Education \nResearch  Institute  and  ADB\u2019s  Mongolia  Resident  Mission,  has  been  established  to  provide \npolicy  guidance  and  to  oversee  implementation  of  the  ADB  and  NDF-financed  activities. \nBuilding  upon  the  experience  and  expertise  of  the  ESDP  project  implementation  unit,  a  PMU \nhas been established to support MOECS to effectively and efficiently achieve SEDP objectives. \nThe  PMU  is  headed  by  a  project  manager  who  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation  of  ADB  and  NDF-financed  SEDP  activities.  ADB  and  the  PMU  will  coordinate \nwith  the  JICA  Mongolia  office  during  implementation  to  ensure  coordination  between  the \nrespective SEDP components.  \n \n67.  Within  MOECS,  CCU  will  be  the  key  entity  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  ADB \nand NDF-financed school development activities. CCU was recently established by MOECS, to \naddress  needs  for  improved  capacity  for  construction,  rehabilitation,  and  maintenance  of \neducational facilities. CCU is financed by levying fees for its services to MOECS or other clients, \nincluding local administrations. A detailed description of CCU and of the internal processes for \nconstruction and rehabilitation is given in Appendix 8. \n \n68. \nThe SEDP will be implemented over 5 years. This will allow adequate time to complete \nconstruction  and  rehabilitation  works  given  Mongolia\u2019s  very  short  construction  season.  A \nmidterm review will be undertaken by the Government and ADB, in conjunction with NDF and \nJICA, during the second year of implementation to assess progress and achievements, identify \nany difficulties being encountered, and recommend remedial action if required. \n\n\f \n\n \n20\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n \n69. \nAll  procurement  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  Appendix  9  summarizes  the  procurement  packaging  for  the  SEDP.  ICT \nequipment  or  materials  valued  at  more  than  $300,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Procurement  of  equipment,  and  learning  materials  will  be \nawarded through international shopping for contract packages of less than $300,000 equivalent \nor  less.  Small  contracts  of  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  each  for  off-the-shelf  items  may  be \nfilled  by  direct  purchase.  Local  competitive  bidding  will  be  undertaken  for  civil  works  contracts \nless  than  $1,000,000  equivalent  each  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nPMU will be responsible for overall procurement activities. Procurement under the Government \nof  Japan  and  NDF-financed  components  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  respective  agencies\u2019 \nown procedures. \n \n \n \nADB will finance 21 person-months of international consulting services and 459 person-\n70. \nmonths of domestic consulting services. The international and domestic consultants will support \nMOECS, and other education sector entities covered by the SEDP in all aspects of civil works, \npolicy  and  strategic  advice,  training  and  staff  development,  as  well  as  TA  for  quality \nimprovement.  International  consultants  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Advance action will be taken to \nselect ADB-financed consultants to facilitate the start-up arrangements for the SEDP. Domestic \nconsultants will be selected and engaged by the PMU under arrangements acceptable to ADB.29 \nNDF will finance 19 person-months of international consulting services and 284 person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  services,  in  accordance  with  its  own  procedures  on  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants.  The  summary  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  10.  The  Government  of  Japan \nwill also finance long- and short-term consulting services in accordance with its own procedures \non the use of consultants. \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements and Imprest Fund \n\n \nAll  disbursements  under  the  ADB  loan  for  the  SEDP  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \n71. \nwith Government procedures and ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Disbursements for the \nGovernment  of  Japan  and  NDF-financed  components  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the \nrespective  agencies\u2019  own  procedures.  To  expedite  disbursement  of  ADB  loan  proceeds,  the \nSEDP will use an imprest account. The imprest account will be established in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The account will be opened by the PMU in a commercial \nbank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not \nexceed 6 months of projected expenditures and is estimated at $250,000 equivalent.  \n \n72. \nStatement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures \nunder  ADB-financed  SEDP  activities,  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest \naccounts  in  accordance  with  procedures  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  Each  individual  payment  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the \nprocedures will not exceed $50,000 equivalent for each item of expenditure.  \n \n\n                                                 \n29  According  to  the  specific  packages  of  consulting  services,  domestic  consultants  will  be  recruited  both  under \n\nseparate contracts and subcontracted by international consultants.  \n\n\f \n\n \n21\n\n \n\n             \nd.  \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit \n\n \n73. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  (in  the  format  of  ADB\u2019s  project  performance \nreport) on project implementation focusing on the ADB and NDF-financed components, but also \nincorporating the principal outputs under the Government of Japan-financed components. JICA \nwill  prepare  its  own  reports  for  assessing  progress  of  the  Government  of  Japan-financed \ncomponents. The PMU will provide reports to ADB and NDF and copied to JICA within 30 days \nafter  the  end  of  the  applicable  period.  Brief  monthly  reports  will  also  be  provided.  Within  3 \nmonths  after  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  MOECS  will  submit  a  project  completion \nreport to ADB, JICA, and NDF. \n \n74.  MOECS will maintain separate records and accounts for all expenditures to be financed \nby  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan,  will  be  maintained  by  MOECS  in  accordance  with  sound \naccounting  principles.  They  will  specify  the  expenditures  for  all  activities  and  identify  all \nexpenditures  to  be  financed  by  the  loan  proceeds.  Project  accounts,  including  financial \nstatements, statements of expenditures, and imprest account records, will be audited annually \nby  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  auditors\u2019  report,  and  copies  of  the  certified  accounts  and \nrelated  financial  statements,  including  the  auditors\u2019  opinions  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds, \ncompliance with loan covenants, and the use of the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditures procedures, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after the \nend of the fiscal year to which they relate. Records and accounts, as well as audit procedures, \nwill be established for the Government of Japan and NDF-financed SEDP components, in line \nwith the respective agencies\u2019 requirements. \n \n\ne.    Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n75.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  undertaken  in  the  framework  of  MOECS\u2019s  existing \neducation  management  information  system,  as  well  as  through  specific  measures  to  gauge \nSEDP  benefits  within  the  context  of  the  education  sector  as  a  whole  using  a  system  of \nmonitorable  indicators,  based  on  a  review  of  baseline  statistics.  Consulting  services  will  be \nprovided for this purpose and surveys commissioned to independently supervise and evaluate \nSEDP  activities.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  specialists  will  be  recruited  to  support  MOECS  in \ndeveloping  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  and  to  assess  overall  SEDP  impact  on  a \nsystematic basis. The specialists will report directly to the steering committee. \n \nG. \n\nThe Executing Agency  \n\n76.  MOECS, the Executing Agency for the SEDP, has successfully implemented the ESDP30 \nand  has  attracted  a  wide  range  of  assistance  agencies  to  the  education  sector.  It  has  also \nsuccessfully supported the implementation of three ADB TAs, leading to the development of a \ncomprehensive policy and planning framework for the education sector. MOECS has also been \ninstrumental  in  undertaking  educational  reforms  that  place  Mongolia  at  the  forefront  of  Asian \ntransition  countries  in  terms  of  educational  performance,  and  provide  a  comprehensive  and \nsolid policy framework for SEDP implementation.  \n \n77. \nA weakness of MOECS, which was highlighted during ESDP implementation, however, \nwas its lack of capacity for supervising civil works. This problem has, however, been addressed \nthrough  the  creation  of  a  self-financing  CCU  under  MOECS.  As  a  new  unit,  the  SEDP  will \n\n                                                 \n30 The implementation performance rating is highly satisfactory with original activities completed ahead of schedule. \n\n\f \n\n \n22\n\n \n\nprovide  support  for  CCU\u2019s  development.  With  regard  to  textbook  provision,  MOECS\u2019s  policies \nand operating procedures are not yet fully compatible with utilizing private sector capacities in \neducational  publishing,  although  it  has  initiated  programs  with  assistance  agencies,  including \nthe Soros Foundation, to modify structures and arrangements. Capacity for policy development \nand planning of ICT integration also requires development. SEDP will address this by providing \nstaff training and building partnerships with specialized ICT research and training institutions. \n \nH. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n78. \nNo  adverse  environmental  effects  are  expected  from  the  SEDP.  A  comprehensive \nenvironmental assessment was undertaken under the CIDA Mongolia School Rehabilitation and \nConstruction  Study.  Its  findings  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  The  SEDP  will \nalso  provide  support  for  the  environmental  studies  program  for  primary  grades  1  to  3,  by \nproviding learning materials and teacher training for selected schools to strengthen this program \nand to make it more relevant to the daily lives of students. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Analysis \n\nThe  SEDP,  including  components  financed  by  Government  of  Japan  and  NDF,  will \n79. \nprovide  positive  educational  benefits  to  children  aged  4  to  18,  of  kindergarten,  primary,  and \nsecondary  school  age.  There  will  be  no  adverse  social  or  educational  impacts  (Appendix  10 \ninclude the initial social assessment), or involuntary resettlement effects. New facilities will be \nconstructed on existing school sites or in sparsely populated areas on land allocated by local \nadministrations,31 and selected in consultation with local communities. The SEDP is, therefore, \nclassified as Resettlement Category C. \n \nThe  SEDP  is  classified  as  Category  C  in  terms  of  impact  on  indigenous  peoples. \n80. \nAlthough  Mongolia  comprises  over  16  distinct  clans  and  ethnic  groups  none  of  these  is  so \ndistinct  from  the  dominant  or  mainstream  society  that  is  especially  vulnerable  to  being \ndisadvantaged in the process of development. \n \n81. \nThe  SEDP  will  also  make  provision  to  address  the  lower  participation  of  boys  in \neducation, particularly at the upper secondary level. Support will be aimed primarily at revising \neducational programs to make them more suitable to boys\u2019 demands including more links with \nlabor markets and integration of vocational education into standard curricula. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION \n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses  \n\n1. \n\nProject Benefits \n\nThe  principal  benefit  of  the  SEDP  will  be  to  safeguard  and  restore  access  for  at  least \n82. \n95,000  children  of  kindergarten  and  school  age  through  the  rehabilitation  and  construction  of \neducational  facilities,  including  dormitories.  About  45%  of  these  children  are  expected  to  be \nfrom  poor  families.  The  SEDP  will  also  enhance  the  external  efficiency  of  both  primary  and \nsecondary  education  programs  and  their  relevance  to  the  emerging  social  and  economic \n\n                                                 \n31 There is no private land ownership in Mongolia; allocation of land is the responsibility of local administrations. \n\n\f \n\n \n23\n\n \n\ncontext.  At  least  140,000  children  of  kindergarten  and  school  age  are  expected  to  benefit. \nGraduates of the SEDP-supported schools and programs will benefit from enhanced skills and \nknowledge, which will boost their ability to secure viable employment and their future income-\nearning  potential.  Modernizing  educational  methods  and  improving  educational  content  will \nallow increased labor mobility between economic sectors. Access of children with disabilities to \neducation  will  also  be  facilitated  by  upgrading  school  facilities  and  developing  staff \ncompetencies for integrating children with disabilities into mainstream programs. \n \nThe  SEDP  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  public  expenditure  by  emphasizing  far \n83. \ngreater  efficiency  in  the  development  and  management  of  existing  educational  institutions, \nparticularly  for  energy  and  utility  costs,  which  typically  account  for  40%  or  more  of  individual \ninstitutions\u2019  recurrent  expenditure.  By  2007,  SEDP  investments  could  decrease  annual \nexpenditures by 22%, saving over $3.2 million yearly on selected items (Table 3). By developing \nnew school designs, capable of accommodating more students, operating cost unit per student \ncan be decreased in SEDP schools.  \n \nTable 3: Expected SEDP Impact on Recurrent Budgetary Requirements (selected items)32 \n \n\nItem \n\nBudgeted \nResources in 1999 \n(MNT million) \n \n\nPercentage Reduction \n(increase) in  \nReal Budgetary \nAllocations by 2007 \n(%) \n\nRecurrent Annual \nExpenditure Forecast  \nin 2007  \n(MNT million, 1999 prices) \n\n        15,018 \n\n          2,049 \n        10,897 \n             479 \n          1,593 \n\n                  5 \n                25 \n                15 \n                20 \n\n                1,947 \n                8,173 \n                   407 \n                1,274 \n\nElectricity \nCoal and Heating \nFuel Transportation \nClean and Waste \nWater \n        Total \nSource: ADB Staff calculations. \n \n84. \nThe  SEDP\u2019s  drive  to  emphasize  the  importance  of  preventative  maintenance  is  also \nexpected  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  reducing  capital  expenditures  for  repairs  and \nconstruction of facilities in the medium to long term. An additional benefit, noted from the ESDP, \nis that the health of both staff and students can be expected to improve after school facilities are \nrehabilitated.  Health  problems  generally  arise  as  a  result  of  sustained  exposure  to  freezing \ntemperatures, which characterize so many schools in Mongolia today. \n \nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n              11,801 \n\n \n\n85. \nThe  SEDP  has  direct  implications  for  children  of  kindergarten  and  school  age  in  both \nurban  and  rural  areas.  In  urban  areas,  SEDP  activities  will  be  aimed  specifically  at  providing \neducational services to poorer communities, many of which are located in the suburban tented \ncommunities, and where the majority of new migrants to urban areas reside. In addition, SEDP \nwill help to safeguard educational services by supporting strategically located schools serving \npoorer  rural  communities.  Support  to  rural  boarding  schools\u2019  dormitories,  which  poor  children \nare strongly reliant on for attending school, will be a key element to facilitating poor children\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n32Generally  a  wide  discrepancy  exists  between  actual  expenditures  by  item  and  provided  budgets.  As  real    \nexpenditures  on  heating  are  widely  believed  to  be  far  in  excess  of  budgetary  provisions,  the  real  savings  from \nimproved heating can be expected to be far greater than the estimated budgetary reductions. \n\n\f \n\n \n24\n\n \n\naccess.  In  addition,  the  SEDP  will  facilitate  the  access  to  mainstream  education  services  for \nchildren with disabilities and special learning needs. \n \n86. \nThe  SEDP  will  address  the  wide  gender  gap  in  secondary  education  by  improving \neducation  programs  in  line  with  boys\u2019  needs.  Widespread  poverty  means  that  boys\u2019  labor  is \noften  required  by  their  households  for  herding  to  bring  in  extra  income.  With  the  quality  and \nrelevance  of  education  perceived  as  low,  the  opportunity  cost  of  their  full-time  participation  in \neducation is seen as high, leading to their withdrawal from school. By adapting the content and \nmethods of education provision more to actual labor market needs, the perceived opportunity \ncost of education will fall, thus encouraging greater enrolment and retention.  \n \nC. \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\n87. \nThe  SEDP  will  have  direct  and  indirect  impacts  on  pupils  from  poor  families,  including \nchildren with disabilities. It will reduce deprivation poverty by increasing access to education in \nareas with the lowest enrolment rates, including remote rural areas, as well as among migrant \nand  poorer  communities  in  the  principal  urban  centers  of  Ulaanbaatar  and  in  Darhan-Uul  and \nOrkhon aimags. Due to the investments in educational facilities under the SEDP it will again be \npossible to restore full access to educational services by selected schools. \n \nIncome poverty will also be addressed by SEDP activities for increasing and diversifying \n88. \neducational  attainment  that  will  allow  school  graduates  to  proceed  to  higher  education  and  to \ncompete better in labor markets. These opportunities will enhance graduates\u2019 opportunities for \nincome earning, which will directly affect the livelihoods of themselves and their dependents.  \n \nD. \n\nRisks \n\n89. \nRisks are relatively few for the SEDP, given high societal and governmental commitment \nto  education  and  the  SEDP\u2019s  aims.  In  addition,  Mongolia  has  accumulated  substantial  project \nimplementation  experience  from  ADB  and  other  agencies.  However,  the  relative  lack  of \nspecialist  personnel  and  institutional  experience  of  some  areas  covered  by  the  SEDP  poses \nsome  risk  for  SEDP  implementation.  This  includes  building  design  and  supervision  where \nMOECS  has  only  recently  established  a  specialist  CCU  for  this  purpose.  These  risks  can, \nhowever,  be  mitigated  with  sufficient  emphasis  on  capacity  building  under  the  SEDP,  and  by \ncooperating in this field with other agencies by pooling experience and resources. The lack of \ninstitutional  capacity  in  education  management  structures  for  adoption  and  integration  of \nappropriate  ICT,  and  promotion  of  private  sector  publishing  provision  also  poses  some  risk  to \neffective  implementation.  This,  too,  should  be  addressed  with  a  program  of  capacity  building \ntogether with the development of partnerships with specialist institutions in the private sector.  \n \nAnother risk concerns contractor capacity for civil works on schools, especially in remote \n90. \nrural  areas.  Some  contracts  will  be  relatively  large  for  the  communities  included  in  the  SEDP, \nand  if  contractors  face  difficulties  in  mobilizing  sufficient  personnel,  equipment,  and  materials, \ndelays in works could lead to disruptions in school operations. Given the very short construction \nseason,  even  short  slippages  in  implementation  progress  can  lead  to  major  delays,  if \ncontractors are forced to suspend work during the long winters. This risk can best be offset by \neffective  supervision  of  works,  as  well  as  by  setting  realistic  schedules  and  outputs  in  the \ncontracting  process.  This  will  be  addressed  by  substantial  financing  of  the  requisite  specialist \npersonnel to support supervision during the SEDP and to develop longer-term capacities in this \narea within MOECS and local administrations. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n25\n\n \n\nA harmonized approach to educational infrastructure development and maintenance by \n91. \nall major developing agencies is essential. This will require support for the Government\u2019s policy \nof  rationalizing  the  education  network  with  the  creation  of  the  new  strategically  located \n\u201ccomplex\u201d  and  \u201cinter-soum\u201d  schools  at  the  core.  Support  for  developments  outside  this  policy \nframework  will  lead  to  resources  being  channeled  to  unsustainable  institutions  and  a  deficient \nallocation of resources within the sector. Effective aid coordination will, therefore, be essential. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n92. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nWithin 12 months of loan effectiveness, MOECS will prepare and submit to ADB \nfor  approval  a  plan  to  modify  the  rental  system  for  textbooks  for  secondary \neducation  to  be  provided  under  the  SEDP,  as  well  as  a  timetable  for  the \nintroduction  of  a  fully  liberalized  market  for  textbooks  and  learning  materials. \nMOECS  will  commence  implementation,  on  a  pilot  basis,  of  the  modified  rental \nsystem within 18 months of loan effectiveness. \n\n(ii)  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  take  all  necessary \nactions  to  ensure  that  all  children,  regardless  of  legal  status  (e.g.,  children  of \ninternal  migrants  lacking  the  required  transfer  documentation),  can  enroll  in \nschools of their choice at SEDP sites.  \n\n(iii)  Within  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness  and  in  consultation  with  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  agencies,  MOECS  will  prepare  a  draft  ICT  policy  paper  covering \nprimary and secondary education, and future investments in ICT to advance key \neducation priorities. \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe Government will ensure that all schools and sites selected for development \nunder the SEDP meet the selection criteria, as described in Appendix 6. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  MOECS  consults  with  provincial  and  local \ngovernments, including local hurals (district councils), as well as school boards, \nin the planning, rehabilitation, and construction of facilities under the SEDP. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  provincial  and  local  governments  provide  all \nnecessary counterpart funds on a timely basis. Adequate funds for operation and \nmaintenance  of  SEDP  facilities  will  be  provided  through  specific  line  items  for \noperation and maintenance in the annual budget.  \n\n \nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n93. \nThe  Loan  Agreement  for  the  Project  will  not  become  effective  until  all  conditions  for \neffectiveness of the loan documentation for the NDF loan, aside from effectiveness of the ADB \nLoan Agreement, have been satisfied. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n26\n\n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n94. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 10,806,000 to Mongolia for the Second Education Development Project, \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\n
