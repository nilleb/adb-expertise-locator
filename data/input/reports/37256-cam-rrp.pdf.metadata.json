A wide range of \nactivities  of  support  to  rural  communes  by  the  Government,  with  or \nwithout international assistance, have significantly been enhanced and \nmade possible by the type of outputs that CCDP has produced and that \nthree  components: \nthis  project \n(i) Commune  Council  Facilities,  which  will  enable  about  235  commune \ncouncils  to  build  local  assembly  premises,  enabling  them  to  function, \nand \n(ii)  Civil  Registration  System \nDevelopment,  to  build  on  Cambodia\u2019s  achievement  in  collecting  hard-\ncopy  civil  registration  (CR)  records  over  2003\u20132006,  by  creating  a \nmodern,  computerized  national  CR  system;  and \n(iii)  Capacity \nDevelopment,  to  continue  building  awareness,  understanding,  and  the \nconcept  of  decentralization  and  deconcentration,  public  service, \ndemocratic rights, and responsibilities. \n \nCambodia  has  historically  been  a  highly  centralized  state.  The  long-\nand \nprocess \nterm \ndeconcentration  (D&D)  of  government  decision  making  and  public \nservice  delivery,  begun  in  2001,  is  the  single  most  significant  state-\nbuilding development in the country since the 1993 Constitution. \n \nThe  creation  of  a  local  level  of  elected  administration\u2014commune \ncouncils\u2014and \nin \nFebruary 2002  have  now  led  to  the  preparation  of  a  new  legal \nframework  for  the  district,  provincial,  and  new  urban  authorities. \nComprehensive new legislation for the entire subnational administration \nis to be submitted to the National Assembly in the first half of 2007. This \nlegislation  (the  Organic  Law)  will  be  supported  by  an  implementation \nprogram  of  D&D,  designed  for  a  decade,  with  a  preparatory  and  initial \nstage  expected  to  run  through  2007\u20132008.  This  will  include  the \nits \nestablishment  of  an \n\nfirst  commune  council  direct  elections \n\nimplementation  authority, \n\n \nRationale \n\ndecentralization \n\ntogether  with \n\ninstitutional \n\nreform \n\ntheir \n\nrole; \n\nthe \n\nof \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan \n\nlocal \n\ninfrastructure  projects \n\nstructures,  systems,  and  procedures.  A  transition  phase,  to  run  from \n2009  to  2012,  is  expected  to  expand  the  concrete  transfer  of  service \ndelivery  functions  from line  ministries  to  the  newly  created  subnational \nauthorities.  \n \nLocal  administration  in  Cambodia  is  expected  to  be  accorded  an \nincreasing  level  of  responsibilities.  However,  serious  constraints  in \ninstitutional and physical capacity persist for most of the country\u2019s 1,621 \ncommune  councils.  Commune  councils  (i)  plan  and  implement  small-\nscale \nfor  community  development, \n(ii) resolve household and local disputes and  issues (for example, land \nmanagement  and  irrigation),  (iii)  allow  government  participation  in  the \narticulation  of  local  issues,  (iv)  provide  CR  facilities,  and  (v)  keep  civil \nrecords and the electoral database.  \n \nAlthough  commune  councils  cannot,  because  of  their  small  size  and \nresources,  take  on  more  service  delivery  functions,  they  are  the \ndemocratically  elected  foundation  of  the  new  district,  provincial,  and \nmunicipal  authorities  now  being  created.  CCDP  has  made  important \nprogress  in  addressing  weaknesses  in  the  facilities  of  communes  and \nhas  contributed  to  improving  their  capacity,  but  most  of  the  country\u2019s \n1,621 commune councils continue to lack (i) a fixed facility to meet as a \ncouncil  or  with  their  constituents,  or  for  keeping  documentation  and \nequipment,  severely  limiting  their  effectiveness  in  local  development; \n(ii) awareness  of  democratic  rights  and  responsibilities  and  of  public \nservice  obligations;  (iii)  a  system  for  storing  and  updating  CR  records \ncollected  in  2003\u20132006;  and  (iv)  institutional  relationships  among  and \nbetween councils, and linkage to district and provincial government.   \n \nCCDP  has  made  an  important  contribution  to  strengthening  commune \ncouncils operationally. A specially commissioned process review by the \naudit  company  KPMG  has  confirmed \nthe  effectiveness  and \nsustainability of the methodology of CCDP and of this project.  \n \nImpact.  Overall  consolidation  of  the  new  institution  of  elected  local \ngovernment.  For \nthe  Project  will \nlocal  public  administration, \n(i) effectively  contribute  to  improving  the  living  standards  of  local \ncommunities;  (ii)  strengthen  the  accountability,  reach,  responsiveness, \nand  transparency  of  subnational  public  sector  administration  and \nservice  delivery;  and  (iii)  strengthen  men\u2019s  and  women\u2019s  voice  and \nparticipation in local affairs and public service delivery.  \n \nOutcome.  The  Project  will  (i)  enable  more  commune  councils  to \noperate  effectively, \nthe  national  CR  system,  and \n(ii)  develop \nrights  and \n(iii) strengthen  voter  understanding  of  democratic \naccountabilities.  These  outcomes  will  provide  essential  support  for \ninstitutionalizing  more  accountable  local  government  and  gender-\nresponsive forms of local government and public service delivery.   \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is $9.78 million, including taxes and \nduties. The grant proceeds will not be used to finance taxes and duties.  \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  Asian  Development \nFund grant financing of $7.8 million to be implemented over 30 months. \nThe Government will contribute $1.98 million in the form of counterpart \nstaff,  salaries,  accommodation,  equipment \nfor  operation  and \nmaintenance, land, and taxes and duties. \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization  January 2007 to December 2009 \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n30 June 2009 \n\n \nThe  Ministry  of  Interior  (MoI),  through  its  Department  of  Local \nAdministration  (DoLA)  and  Office  of  Civil  Registration  (OoCR),  will  be \nthe main Implementing Agency for this project. A Project Technical Cell \nwill  be  established  within  MOI.  Component  1,  Commune  Facilities,  will \nbe  implemented  by  the  prioritized  commune  councils,  with  central \nsupervision by DoLA and support from one international consultant (the \nproject team leader) and three national consultants. Component 2, Civil \nRegistration  System  Development,  will  be  implemented  by  the  OoCR, \nwith support from DoLA, a long-term national consultant, and the project \nteam leader. Component 3, Capacity Development, will be implemented \nby  DoLA\u2019s  capacity-building  office  with  support  from  two  full-time \nnational  consultants  for  capacity  building  and  gender,  and  one  short-\nterm international consultant.   \n \nMinistry of Interior \n \nInternational: 25 person-months \nNational: 241 person-months \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  by  the  Executing  Agency  according  to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Individual consultants will \nbe  recruited  for  the  following  fields  of  expertise:  engineering  and \narchitecture,  capacity  building,  data  management,  accounting,  gender \nmainstreaming, and mass media. \nConsultants  for  impact  evaluation  studies  will  be  engaged  through  a \nfirm using the Quality- and Cost-based Selection method. \n \nThe commune councils will procure works, goods, and services through \nshopping  for  component  1,  as  the  small  value  and  scattered  nature  of \nthe  procurement  is  not  likely  to  attract  international  bidders.  Certain \ncommunes  in  remote  locations,  which  would  find  difficulty  attracting \ncontractors,  may  carry  out  procurement \nthrough  community \nparticipation.  Machinery  and  office equipment  will  be  procured  through \nnational  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  equal  to  or  more  than \n$100,000 and through shopping where the cost is less than $100,000.  \n \nTechnical assistance (TA) will be provided to promote gender equity in \nlocal  governance.  It  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  elected  women \ncouncilors and women and children focal points in six target provinces \nby activating women networking forums in districts and communes. The \nforums are intended to provide women with opportunities to share their \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nexperience  and  self-learning,  promote  mutual  support  and  networking, \nbuild  confidence,  increase  visibility,  and  improve  work  performance. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $236,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance \n$200,000  equivalent,  to  be  funded  from  the  Gender  Development \nCooperation  Fund.  The  national  nongovernment  organization  (NGO) \nWomen for Prosperity will be recruited for a period of not more than 12 \nmonths  to  implement  the  TA  activities.  The  national  NGO  will  be \nretained through single-source selection, according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  services  are  expected  to  begin  in  the \nsecond half of 2007, or 18 months after the Project takes effect, and to \nbe completed 1 year later, in 2008. Supplies and materials under the TA \nwill be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \nComponent 1: Commune Facilities. Local-assembly premises will be \nmade  available  to  about  235  commune  councils,  thus  providing \nadequate working facilities for elected councilors and their constituents \nand helping to establish the newly introduced institution of elected local \ngovernment in Cambodia.  \n \nComponent  2:  Civil  Registration  System  Development.  The  whole \npopulation  (especially  women  and  children)  will  be  able  to  prove \nentitlements based on official birth, death, and marriage documentation. \nMore comprehensive and accurate information provided by the system \nwill also allow better informed government planning and policy making.  \n \nComponent  3:  Capacity  Development. The training fund will support \ntraining  for  elected  commune  councilors,  clerks,  and  government \nofficials  in  concepts  of  local  democracy  and  accountability,  council \ntasks,  roles,  and  services.  The  mass  media  fund  will  support  the \ndissemination  of  key  messages  on  local  democracy,  participation,  and \naccountability through TV, radio, and village theaters.  \n \nGender issues will be addressed in all component activities. A full-time \ngender specialist will be engaged to strengthen the gender content of all \ntraining  and  mass  media  activities  and  to  ensure  that  the  \u201csoon  to  be \napproved\u201d  DoLA  gender  strategy  and  gender  action  plan \nis \nimplemented.   \n \nThe  Project  as  a  whole  will  contribute  to  strengthening  the  new \ninstitution  of  elected  local  government  in  Cambodia.  Democracy  and \ngreater participation will benefit the poor and women by promoting more \nefficient  and  accountable  service  delivery  and  thus  more  equitable \ngrowth  opportunities.  Commune  democracy  has  been \nthe  most \nimportant  development  since  the  1993  Constitution  in  deepening  and \nbroadening  democratization  in  Cambodia.  Commune  democracy  will \nshortly  begin  to  affect  the  other  subnational  tiers  and  more  service \ndelivery  agencies  as  a  result  of  current  draft  legislation  to  create \nindirectly elected district and provincial councils. The benefit of greater \npopular voice, participation, transparency, and  thus  accountability  over \nresources and services managed by provincial and district governments \nis potentially very substantial. \n \n\n\f \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n  v\n\nBenefits Evaluation. The Project will lay down an analytical framework \nand  a  data  collection  mechanism  for  the  impact  evaluation  of  its \ncommune council facilities component, to be done at a later date. The \nevaluation  method  will  combine  the  methods  of  propensity  score \nmatching and double differences, using commune and household data. \nThe  data  will  be  collected  through  three-stage  surveys  (province, \ncommune, and household), with sample households from each sampled \ncommune  stratified  by  poverty  level  (poorest,  middle  income,  and \nrichest). The total sample will comprise 100 project communes and 100 \nnonproject  communes,  with  15  households  to  be  surveyed  in  each \nsampled commune. The baseline survey will be done at the start of the \nProject.  A  similar  survey  will  be  done  at  project  completion.  ADB  will \nwork with DoLA to develop a specific design for the surveys. This data \ncollection mechanism will be funded under the Project. \n \nCorruption  is  a  project  risk.  Construction  funds  could  be  misused, \nmaterials  used  could  be  defective  or  of  poor  quality,  or  inferior  design \nstandards  could  be  applied.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  project \ndesign, which sets rigorous quality specification and control standards, \nincluding  an  operations  manual  for  constructors;  (ii)  quality  checks \nbefore,  during,  and  after  construction  by  a  permanent  project  team \nformed for this purpose; (iii) standardized designs, which facilitate cost \nmonitoring  and  control;  (iv)  very  tight  cost  margins,  which  minimize \nopportunities  to  overstate  costs;  and  (v)  moral  suasion  resulting  from \nthe  high  status  accorded  to  the  construction  of  commune  council \nbuildings under the Project. \n \nThere  is  also  the  risk  that  the  local  administration  will  still  have  weak \ncapacity by the time the responsibilities and resources are turned over, \nor that the commune councils will not be sufficiently responsive to their \nconstituents\u2019  needs.  The  capacity  development  component  of  this \nproject,  in  conjunction  with  diverse  activities  of  other  development \npartners, is aimed at mitigating capacity gaps. This risk will be mitigated \nby  (i)  the  public  awareness  campaign  funded  by  the  Project,  (ii)  the \nactions of other donors, and (iii) the competitive political process at the \nlocal  level,  which  is  expected  to  make  local  officials  more  sensitive  to \nthe needs of their communities because of electoral accountability.   \n \nThere  is  moreover  a  risk  that  the  process  of  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration  will  be  mismanaged,  incompletely  implemented,  or \nsubstantially  delayed.  There  is  the  risk  as  well  that  after  the  functions \nare  transferred,  not  enough  resources  will  be  provided  and  local \ngovernments will therefore remain weak. This uncertainty goes beyond \nthe scope of this project, but it is partly mitigated by the Government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  its  reform  agenda,  as  evidenced  most  recently  by  the \npreparation  of  a  draft  Organic  Law \nfor  Deconcentration  and \nDecentralization  and  the  preparation  of  an  implementation  framework \nfor  this  purpose.  It  is  further  mitigated  by  the  participation  of  other \ndevelopment  partners  working  with  the  Government  to  address  key \nimplementation issues. \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nAs  before,  there  is  always  the  risk  of  possible  capture  of  the  local \ngovernment by the rich and powerful, or of local councils not operating \nopenly and democratically. However, available assessments perceive a \npositive effect of local democratic processes in reducing the risk of elite \ncapture  and  financial  abuse.  As  referred  to  above,  local  development \nprojects  appear  to  be  free  from  elite  capture,  according  to  past \nassessments, and are seen to benefit the majority rather than the few. \nAlso,  the  public  does  not  see  its  councils  as  adversely  affected  by \npartisan  politics  and  dispute  mediation  is  the  main  councilor  activity, \napart from administrative tasks. \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Commune Council Development Project 2 (CCDP2). The \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Capacity  Development  of \nFemale  Commune  Council  Networks,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  grant,  I,  acting \nunder authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nRationale and Analysis \n\n \nA.  \n \nPublic administration reform and local governance are key areas of Asian Development \n2. \nBank (ADB) support under the current country strategy and program (CSP) for the Kingdom of \nCambodia  2005\u20132009. 1  This  Project  is  a  follow-up  to  the  Commune  Council  Development \nProject (CCDP), which was approved by ADB in 2002 to assist the Government in ensuring that \nin  the  medium  term  all  commune  councils  would  have  the  facilities  and  basic  equipment  to \nfunction  effectively.2 The  CCDP  has  been  successfully  implemented.3 Commune  councils  are \nrecognized  as  playing  an  essential  role  in  the  promotion  of  democratic  practices  and  in  the \nsocioeconomic development of rural Cambodia. However, as in 2002, many communes do not \nhave  office  facilities  or  operate  in  temporary  and  dilapidated  wood  structures,  and  thus  have \nseriously impaired capacity to positively influence the welfare of local communities.  \n \nCommune  Councils. Cambodia is an overwhelmingly rural country. More than 80% of \n3. \nthe population lives in rural areas and poverty incidence ranges from 40% to 60%  (Cambodia \nCSP 2005\u20132009). Cambodia has 1,621 communes and sangkats. Of this total, 1,510 are mostly \nrural  communes  in  the  20  provinces,  and  111  are  urban  sangkats  in  the  four  municipalities \n(mostly  in  Phnom  Penh).  Commune  councils  are  the  lowest  level  of  public  administration  in \nCambodia.  The  Commune  Administration  Act  2001  gave  councils  \u201clocal  affairs\u201d  duties  to \nmaintain  security  and  public  order;  manage  public  services;  promote  welfare,  economic,  and \nsocial development; protect and conserve the environment; and promote tolerance and mutual \nunderstanding. The 2002 subdecree decentralizing powers, roles, and duties set out two broad \nroles  for  commune  councils:  promoting  development  and  achieving  greater  democracy. \nHowever,  these  powers  are  discretionary  and  supplementary:  councils  are  not  responsible  for \npolice, education, health, and other major services. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.

Manila)  approved  on  12  November  2002.  This  project  is  cofinanced  by  ADB,  the  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida),  and  the  Royal  Netherlands  Embassy.  ADB  provided  $10 \nmillion  equivalent  through  Loan  1953-CAM  (Special  Funds  [SF]),  Sida  gave  a  grant  of  $3  million  equivalent,  and \nthe Government of the Netherlands gave a grant of $2.4 million equivalent. The Government contributed $2 million \nin  kind.  The  CCDP  is  executed  by  the  Ministry  of  Interior  (MoI)  through  its  Department  of  Local  Administration \n(DoLA).  The  CCDP  has  four  components:  commune  facilities,  capacity  building,  orthographic  mapping,  and  civil \nregistration. This project was prepared with assistance from TA-CAM: 4739. The CCDP assisted in furnishing 519 \ncommunes with proper offices. \n\n3   The  November  2004  midterm  review  (MTR)  of  CCDP,  subsequent  ADB  reviews,  and  the  performance  review \nconducted in March 2006 during the design phase of this follow-up project indicate successful performance across \nall components. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  councils  each  have  7  to  15  elected  councilors,  depending  on  the  size  of  the \n4. \ncommune. In the first commune and sangkat elections (February 2002) 11,261 commune and \nsangkat councilors were elected (8.5% were female and 10.2% were from ethnic minorities) for \na  term  of  5  years.  The  second  commune  and  sangkat  elections  will  be  in  April 2007.  The \ncouncilors  receive  a  small  monthly  stipend.  Only  one  staff  member  of  the  council,  the  council \nclerk, is a Ministry of Interior (MoI) employee. The councils\u2019 main revenue source is a formula-\nbased  allocation  from  the  Government,  the  commune  fund  (currently  about  $12,000  yearly  for \neach commune, on the average). About two thirds of each council\u2019s commune fund allocation is \nmainly used in small-scale rural infrastructure, and the rest goes to the council\u2019s administrative \ncosts.  The  small  average  size  of  communes  and  sangkats  is  a  major  constraint  on  their \npotential  capacity  as  direct  service  providers.  Being  small,  however,  also  means  that  councils \nare  close  to  the  people.  Councilors  can  therefore  play  a  key  role  in  services  such  as  the \nresolution of family and other disputes, and the maintenance of local peace and order. Councils \nalso support the implementation of the Land Law 2001: they conduct land use planning, resolve \nlocal  plot  disputes,  and  monitor  illegal  use.  They  have  been  given  direct  responsibility  for  two \nimportant state infrastructure services: civil registration (CR) (of births, deaths, and marriages) \nand maintenance of the electoral database. All councils are also involved in planning, allocating, \nand  implementing  local  infrastructure  and  other  rural  development  investments  financed  from \nthe Commune and Sangkat Fund. \n \n5. \nThe  most  comprehensive  independent  study  of  commune  and  sangkat  council \nperformance  to  date,  commissioned  by  the  Asia  Foundation,4 found  that  citizens  are  generally \nsatisfied with the performance of their councils, and that the resolution of commune issues has \nimproved  since  the  introduction  of  elected  councils.  Citizens  are  aware  of  commune  council \nfunctions.  Local  development  projects  appear  to  be  free  from  elite  capture  and  are  seen  to \nbenefit  the  majority  rather  than  the  few.  The  study  found  that  dispute  mediation  is  the  main \ncouncilor  activity,  other  than  administrative  tasks,  and  that  commune  councilors  are  now  as \nlikely to be involved in dispute resolution as village chiefs. Councilors are reportedly approached \nby local residents (5 to 10 each day) for help in resolving local disputes, mostly about land or \nirrigation, and family disagreements. Overall, the study findings were positive about the growing \nrole, mandate, and competence of the commune councils. \n \n6. \nRationale  for  Supporting  Commune  Councils.  Supporting  commune  councils  is  a \npriority because, first, they are directly entrusted with basic state infrastructure (CR) and support \nfor land registration, processes that are vital in giving people greater access to essential justice \nadministration,  such  as  the  protection  of  property  rights,  and  other  fundamental  services \nprovided by the state. Councilors\u2019 effectiveness in resolving disputes, supporting essential land \ntitling and management processes, and planning and implementing small-scale infrastructure is \nessential in sustaining increases in agricultural productivity, the determinant of living standards \nin rural Cambodia. The role of the councils in spreading the benefits of civil and land registration \n(and  other  state-building  processes)  is  crucial  in  increasing  the  outreach  and  effectiveness  of \npublic  services  to  the  rural  population  (targeting  of  education  and  health-care  efforts,  and  of \nagriculture policy instruments). Commune councils, by serving as a stable institutional platform \ncloser to the people, also greatly enhance the above-mentioned outreach and effectiveness of \npublic  services  provided  by  other  tiers  of  subnational  administration  to  the  communes.  Most \n\n                                                 \n4   Kim  Ninh  and  Roger  Henke.  2005.  Commune  Councils  in  Cambodia:  A  National  Survey  on  their  Functions  and \nPerformance. The Asia Foundation (May). The field research in April to June 2004 canvassed the perceptions of \n1,416 voter-age citizens and 708 councilors across the country. \n\n\f  3\n\nimportantly,  public  and  collective  direct  feedback  on  the  quality  of  these  services  to  the \ncouncilors is crucial for sustained improvement. \n \n7. \nAlthough  commune  councils  will  have  limited  direct  control  over  service  delivery,  in  a \ncountry  with  little  history  of  local  participation  and  empowerment,  it  is  crucial  to  develop  the \nrepresentative \u201cvoice of the people\u201d on the quality of local services provided by higher levels of \nsubnational  public  administration.  Besides  providing  direct  feedback  on  public  services, \ncommune councils can be more fundamentally empowered as a result of the ongoing plans for \ndecentralization and deconcentration (D&D). The relevance of supporting commune councils for \nthis reason is implicitly recognized in the current CSP for Cambodia with a firm commitment to \nassist the Government in ensuring that in the medium term all commune councils will have the \nbasic  conditions  to  function  effectively.  However,  ADB  and  the  Government  have  also \nrecognized  that  the  effect  on  local  economic  development  from  supporting  commune  councils \ndepends  heavily  on  the  pace  of  overall  D&D.  In  other  words,  the  effectiveness  of  the  direct \nfunctions of the commune councils and of their scrutiny of subnational public services depends \non whether public service functions are indeed being decentralized and deconcentrated to the \nprovinces and districts. \n \n8. \nDecentralization  and  Deconcentration. In June 2005, to establish the objectives and \nprinciples  for  all  the  required  changes  in  public  management  structures  in  Cambodia,  the \nGovernment  approved  the  Strategic  Framework  for  Decentralization  and  Deconcentration \n(SFDD).  The  SFDD  is  intended  to  frame  all  policies,  legal  instruments,  and  operational \nprocedures  of  ministries  and  institutions  of  the  Government  regarding  the  management  and \ndistribution of responsibilities and resources to the provincial, municipal, district and khan, and \ncommune  and  sangkat  levels.  Organic  laws  that  are  now  being  prepared  will  constitute  the \nbasic legal framework for implementing these major changes in public administration. A draft of \nthe  new  Organic  Law  under  preparation  since April  2006  is  now  being  translated and  is to  be \nsubmitted to the National Assembly in early 2007. The proposals in the draft Organic Law are \nexpected  to  be  submitted  to  the  National  Assembly  by  early  2007,  to  create  unified \nadministrations  and  indirectly  elected  councils  (elected  by  the  commune  and  sangkat \ncouncilors) in provinces, districts, municipalities, and khans (urban districts). This is a major step \nforward  in  increasing  the  potential  for  voice  and  participation,  and  in  structurally  improving \nsubnational governance.  \n \n9. \nIn  essence,  with  the  future  implementation  of  the  Organic  Law,  authority  for  providing \nsome  public  services  will  be  delegated  to  the  provincial  and  district  administrations,  enabling \nthese  to  effectively  avoid  the  current  overlapping  and  duplication  of  those  functions  with  line \nministries;  and  democratic  mechanisms  of  scrutiny  and  accountability  of  government  will  be \nestablished as these unified administrations will be accountable to the newly created respective \ncouncils.  As  local  administration  in  Cambodia  undergoes  significant  changes,  the  commune \ncouncils  will  be  awarded  with  an  increasingly  important  role  in  subnational  affairs.  However, \ndeep deficiencies in institutional, physical, and human capacity persist, threatening to jeopardize \nthe potential effectiveness of the reforms. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nB.  \n \n10. \n \n\n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nDeep Deficiencies. As noted in the ADB\u2019s CSP 2005\u20132009: \n\nWhile the holding of commune elections was an important first step, further efforts \nare  needed  to  expand  opportunities  for  citizens  to  influence  and  participate  in \ngovernment.  Currently  the  commune  councils  control  very  limited  resources, \nresulting in low levels of implementation of services and investment. They still lack \nthe  authority,  administrative  capacity,  and  financial  resources  to  accelerate \ndevelopment  at  their  level,  and  have  limited  means  for  dispute  resolution.  (para. \n23, CSP 2005\u20132009, Kingdom of Cambodia, ADB, January 2005) \n\n \nIn  this  context,  since  early  2003,  ADB  has  financed  CCDP  to  tackle  these  problems. \n11. \nMuch has been achieved since then. CCDP has provided offices\u2014\u201cmini-parliament\u201d premises\u2014\nfor 519 councils with no accommodation, which act as a powerful visible symbol of the primacy \nof  local  democracy.  Council  communication  capacity  has  improved  since  the  provision  of \ntypewriters,  a  province-district-commune  radio  network \nfor  remote  areas,  and  some \nmotorcycles. All five provincial local administration units (PLAUs) were provided with refurbished \noffices  and  now  have  adequate  working  facilities.  Training  has  strengthened  councilor  and \nofficial  understanding  of  democratic  concepts  and  procedures.  The  largest-ever  public \nawareness campaign in Cambodia has given councilors, staff, and the public a better grasp of \nthe key concepts of local democracy. Up-to-date photomaps with a scale of 1:40,000 have been \ncreated  for  most  of  the  country  and  are  accessible,  greatly  increasing  the  efficiency  of  land \nregistration, land-use planning, and boundary demarcation. The first CR process (births, deaths, \nand  marriage  formalization),  which  is  the  basis  of  many  civil  and  gender  rights,  is  almost \ncomplete. \n \nDespite clear progress, however, the Government faces major challenges in sustaining \n12. \nits efforts to upgrade the capabilities of the communes. First, many councils still do not have a \nfixed meeting place, and must meet as a council or with constituents in local pagodas, schools, \nrestaurants,  or  houses.  Second,  embedding  key  concepts  of  local  democracy\u2014including \npopular  mandate,  legitimate  opposition,  councilors  as local  advocates and  service  providers\u2014\nrequires  sustained  efforts  to  build  capacity.  Third,  strengthening  the  councils\u2019  important,  if \nlimited, service delivery roles in maintaining CR and the electoral register, providing small-scale \ninfrastructure and rural development investments, maintaining social harmony, and tackling land \nand familial disputes is a major and continuing task. Fourth, the relationships among many small \ncouncils, and their linkages to the administrations of districts and provinces, and to line ministry \nservices  deconcentrated  to  subnational  tiers,  still  need  reform. 5 Fifth,  the  amount  of  public \nresources that the Government and other donors can mobilize to support commune councils is \ncannot fund the needs of all communes, for example, the construction of offices. \n \n13. \nADB  Support  to  Commune  Councils.  The  opportunity  for  ADB  support  rests  on  two \nfactors.  First,  building  on  recognized  success  and  lessons  learned  is  a  sound  approach.  The \nreview of the implementation performance of the CCDP in March 2006 (Appendix 2) endorsed \nthe findings of the November 2004 midterm review (MTR), which highlighted CCDP\u2019s successful \n\n                                                 \n5   For more details on the D&D reform and performance of commune councils, see Appendix 1 (Sector Analysis) and \nthe  report  Ninh,  Kim,  and  Roger  Henke.  2005.  Commune  Councils  in  Cambodia:  A  National  Survey  on  their \nFunctions and Performance. Phnom Penh: The Asia Foundation (May). \n\n\f  5\n\ntrying \n\nthe  need \n\nimplementation performance.6 The field survey done as part of the CCDP review of March 2006 \nfound that the support provided by CCDP is highly appreciated by councilors and clerks, district \nand provincial officials, and enjoys strong support from government at the highest level. Second, \nalthough  several  donors  are \nfor  support  at  subnational \nto  address \nadministration,  there  are  no  available  resources  for  the  specific  areas  of  focus  of  CCDP  and \nADB.  Indeed,  ADB  has  developed  a  clear  comparative  advantage  in  the  provision  of  council \nfacilities, in support for public awareness media campaigns, and in the CR drive.  \n \nDonor  Coordination.  Donor  coordination  to  support  this  long-term  reform  agenda  has \n14. \nevolved  around  two  parallel  issues.  First,  for  a  number  of  years,  a  common  and  sizable \nimplementation  mechanism  for  aid  projects  developed  in  the  early  1990s\u2014Seila\u2019s  Partnership \nfor  Local  Governance  (PLG)\u2014has  been  systematically  used  by  different  donors.  Through  this \nimplementation  mechanism,  important  support  has  been  given  to  the  commune  and  sangkat \nfund. Also, many forms of subnational public service delivery have had important benefits from \npublic  service  provided  through  some  of  the  projects  being  implemented  through  Seila\u2019s  PLG \nand  capacities  developed  from  the  systematic  use  of  public  officials  as  consultants  in  Seila\u2019s \npermanent  structures.  With  the  D&D  reforms  being  announced,  and  with  the  increasing \nacknowledgment of the consequences of such a sizable parallel structure of governance, Seila \nfaces  the  challenge  of  reorganizing  its  structure.  This  process  has  been  rendered  complex  in \nthe  absence  of  a  concrete  long-term  definition  of  the  changes  ahead.  The  second  issue  is  in \nregard to the Government\u2019s requirement for all donor support to subnational administration to be \ncoordinated  along  government  strategies.  The  objective  is  twofold:  to  prioritize  donor \ncoordination  along  a  common  framework  (the  Government\u2019s)  of  objectives  without  creating \nparallel  structures  of  governance,  and  to  minimize  disruption  to  ongoing  implementation \narrangements  for  delivering  support  to  subnational  levels  (all  the  ongoing  projects  through \nSeila). ADB has aligned its support to the sector with government mechanisms, while providing \nassurances to development partners that it will align itself with the new framework once this is \nfinalized and agreed on between the Government and its development partners.  \n \n15. \nGender  and  Development.  In  the  past  few  years,  Cambodia  has  experienced \nsubstantial progress in promoting gender sensitivity in local governance. Laws, regulations, and \nprocedures  that  articulate  the  need  to  foster  gender-sensitive  analysis  and  consultative  local \nplanning  processes  are  in  place.  Annual  budget  allocations  for  gender  mainstreaming  in  the \nnational  and  provincial  governments  have  been  provided.  Much  of  the  funding  has  been \ninvested in an ambitious national gender awareness training program and, as a result, the level \nof  gender  awareness  has  increased  among  government  officials  and  elected  commune \ncouncilors.  \n \n16. \nGender mainstreaming efforts have also had a significant effect on commune councils. \nWomen  in  the  villages  are  increasingly  expressing  their  needs  in  the  commune  planning \nprocess.  Evidence  suggests  that  gender  issues  across  a  broad  range  of  sectors  are  being \nraised  in  the  commune  plans.  The  issues  include  economic  and  agricultural  support, \nreproductive health, HIV/AIDS, literacy, vocational skills training, and violence against women. \n\n                                                 \n6   Some recent comparisons on the efficiency of implementation of infrastructure projects claim that under a pooled \nsystem  like  Seila  -  whereas  a  number  of  fixed  donors  shoulder  the  bulk  of  overall  overhead  costs  of  the  system \n(consultants,  supplementation,  administrative  overheads)  -  an  infrastructure  project  would  be  asked  to  shoulder \nonly  an  average  of  $1.00  in  overheads  to  deliver  $4.70  in  investments  for  commune  and  province  authorities. \nUnder  the  CCDP,  it  has  taken  $1.00  in  overhead  so  far  to  deliver  an  average  of  $12.00  of  infrastructure.  Under \nCCDP2,  because  less  funds  will  be  devoted  to  infrastructure,  it  will  take  $1  in  overhead  to  deliver  $8  of \ninfrastructure. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nLessons  \n\nHowever,  assistance  has  tended  to  focus  on  building  the  capacity  of  the  commune  council  in \ngender mainstreaming and less on direct investment in services prioritized by women.7  \n \n17.  While  the  Government  was  largely  successful  in  fostering  commitment  and  action  to \npromote  equality  and  women\u2019s  participation  in  commune  council  affairs,  significant  areas \ncontinue  to  require  attention,  including  the  lack  of  empowerment  and  self-esteem  of  women \ncouncilors.  The  2007  elections  will  provide  an  important  opportunity  to  have  more  women  as \ncommune councilors and to further advance gender equity in the next phase of D&D reform. In \nthis context, the need for continuous support for empowering newly elected women councilors \nand  women  and  children  focal  points  (WCFPs)  to  effectively  perform  their  roles  and \nresponsibilities in commune councils is critical and forms the rationale for the proposed gender \ndesign features of CCDP2. \n \nC. \n \nGender  Mainstreaming:  Capacity  Building  and  Mass  Media.  A  key  lesson  learned \n18. \nfrom  the  review  of  implementation  of  the  CCDP  is  the  importance  of  mainstreaming  gender \nissues.  Addressing  gender  issues  is  necessary  to  ensure  equality  of  public  participation,  but \nwas  not  explicitly  recognized  as  either  an  issue  or  an  objective  of  the  CCDP  in  its  original \ndesign.  Gender issues loom large in the daily work of the communes in a variety of contexts, \nnot least in relation to their important focus on mediation of domestic disputes and oversight of \nCR.  The  use  of  the  training  and  mass  media  funds  under  the  CCDP,  as  redesigned  under \nimplementation, has contributed significantly to sensitizing both men and women to the issues \nof women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights. Thus, the CCDP review found that it would be highly beneficial \nto  assist  the  Department  of  Local  Administration  (DoLA)  in  strengthening  the  detailed  content \nand key messages in training and mass media materials. This finding has the strong support of \nthe Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, which has played an active role on the National Committee for \nSupport to Commune-Sangkat Councils.  \n \n19. \nCommune  councils  are  well  placed  to  give  voice  to  women  councilors,  clerks,  and \ncitizens, and strengthen the undisputed importance of birth and marriage registration for gender \nrights.  Concomitantly,  there  has  been  important  progress  on  the  DoLA  gender  strategy  and \ngender  action  plan  (GAP)  over  the  past  year  (see  Appendix  2,  paras.  22  to  25).  Both  the \nNovember  2004  MTR  and  the  ADB  Gender  Study  of  CCDP  (Gender  Equality  Results  in  ADB \nCambodia,  Cambodia  Country  Report,  ADB,  February  2006)  recommended  strengthening \ngender mainstreaming through both project and stand-alone TA support. \n \n20. \nProtection  of  Civil  Registration  Records.  The  Cambodia  country  study,  within  the \nmulticountry  ADB  study  Establishing  Legal  Identity  for  Social  Inclusion, 8  makes  important \nrecommendations  for  the  future  development  of  Cambodia\u2019s  CR  system.  These  include: \nconsolidating  the  legal  identity  regime,  reducing  local  abuse  of  the  CR  fee  regime,  simplifying \nprocesses, and increasing resources. It is crucial at this point in time to directly address a key \nrecommendation  of  the  study  to  \u201cSecure  all  civil  registration  and  legal  identity  documents...to \n\n                                                 \n7  Helen  Brereton  for  Partnership  for  Local  Governance  and  edited  by  Michael  Wild.

In  addition  to  keeping  paper  records,  all  legal  identity  information \nshould be standardized and computerized.\u201d It is also now crucial to directly address the study's \nrecommendation  to  \u201cRaise  awareness  through  a  public  relations  campaign  to  familiarize  the \npublic with the benefits associated with legal identity.\u201d \n \n21. \nIntegrated  Project  Structure.  The  MTR  and  the  CCDP  review  in  March  2006 \n(Appendix 2)  had  positive  conclusions  about  the  project  management  structure.  However, \naccording  to  the  results  of  the  review,  the  main  identified  weakness  in  the  Project  is  the \noperation of the four components largely in isolation from each other. Overall a silo culture has \ndominated, and interesting lessons have not been shared among components. The absence of \na  unified  organogram  and  management  structure  for  the  TA  team  in  the  report  and \nrecommendation  of  the  president  (RRP)  caused  difficulties  for  ADB  management  in  the  initial \nstages of the Project. That weakness needs to be remedied by integrating project teams into the \nGovernment\u2019s management structure.  \n \nEfficiency  and  Accountability  in  the  Flow  of  Funds.  Appropriate  structuring  of  the \n22. \nflow of funds contributes to project efficiency as well as to accountability. The CCDP experience \nin  the  use  of  special  bank  accounts  for  the  construction  of  the  second  batch  of  commune \ncouncils is deemed to be very positive. This process is advantageous for many reasons. It gives \ncommune councils greater control over their finances, facilitates and speeds up transfers of the \nblock  grant,  and  allows  transfers  to  be  done  individually  by  commune,  and  not  necessarily  in \nprovincial  batches,  as  had  to  be  done  in  the  first  phase  of  CCDP  (commune  bank  accounts, \ntransfers from the imprest account, bank reports to the project under the special arrangement, \nand  the  11-stage  payments  from  the  block  grant  in  the  MoI\u2013commune  council  block  grant \nagreement are all in US dollars). Also, financial monitoring is sharply improved, since the bank \nbranch is fully able to provide monthly statements on all commune-held accounts. \n \nImprest  Account.  An  audit  of  the  CCDP  including  its  financial  management, \n23. \nprocurement,  and  anticorruption  measures,  which  was  completed  in  2004,  provided  valuable \nlessons on the appropriateness of the project design, as well as recommended improvements. \nA  key  observation  was  the  delay  in  project  implementation  arising  from  the  less  than  optimal \nsize of the imprest account. The audit recommended that raising the imprest account to 20% of \nproject  size  would  have  major  benefits  in  ensuring  that  each  batch  of  commune  council \nconstruction  would  be  completed  on  time,  and  allowing  the  construction  of  additional  council \nfacilities from the resulting cost savings. \n \n24. \nDonor  Coordination.  Coordination  with  other  donor  partners  around  capacity \ndevelopment\u2014and  particularly  in  relation  to  training\u2014is  essential.  Capacity  development  for \nsubnational public administration, including training for female councilors and clerks, is now an \nacutely  congested  and  uncoordinated  area  of  donor  support.  All  of  Cambodia\u2019s  major  donors \nare  supporting  the  training  of  subnational  administration  in  different  ways.  One  reason  for  the \ncreation  of  the  new  implementation  authority  for  the  Organic  Law,  led  by  the  deputy  prime \nminister  and  co-minister  of  the  Ministry  of  Interior,  and  the  April  2006  independent  study  of \ndonor  support  is  to  bring  these  diverse  donor  support  efforts  within  a  single  government-led \nframework.  Appendix  3  describes  the  identified  official  aid  projects  in  this  field  at  present  (not \nincluding  the  numerous  current  nongovernment  organization  contributions,  many  of  them \nfinanced  by  official  donors).  Notable  among  current  official  support  programs  are  the  diverse \ntraining and other activities in all communes and sangkats (with a gender mainstreaming focus \nfor  the  past  6  years)  financed  by  Seila\u2019s  PLG  donors  including  UNDP,  Sweden,  United \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nKingdom, Denmark, World Bank, Canada, International Fund for Agricultural Development, and \nUNICEF; the large program of the European Union support in 2006; ongoing work by Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  GmbH  and  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational  Development,  and  Plan  International\u2019s  Local  Administration  and  Reform  Project. \nThese programs reach more than 500 communes.  \n \n25. \nIn  the  immediate  term,  the  only  practicable  means  of  coordination  and  avoidance  of \nduplication, overlap, and waste of resources in relation to training is for training resources to be \nused  only  to  contribute  to  the  development  and  financing  of  activities  included  in  the  annual \nDoLA training plan. An independent study on forms of implementation for donor support to the \nrural  area9 submitted  to  the  Government  highlights  the  disruptive  effects  of  the  current  lack  of \ncoordination  of  donor  presence  on  commune  councils\u2019  accountability  (to  their  citizens)  and \navailable  time  to  perform  their  duties.  It  is  hoped  that  there  will  be  some  progress  toward \nestablishing  a  coherent \nto  subnational \nadministration over the life of this project under the guidance of DoLA. An evaluation concern for \nthe implementation of CCDP\u2019s mass media fund, noted in the CCDP review (Appendix 2), was \nthat,  because  the  core  messages  of  decentralization  were  not  sharply  defined  beforehand  for \ncouncilors, officials, or the public, the publicity campaign did not always result in clear messages \nbeing internalized.  \n \n\nfor  capacity  development  support \n\nframework \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \nThe Project is envisaged to (i) contribute effectively to improving the living standards of \nlocal  communities;  (ii)  strengthen  the  accountability,  reach,  responsiveness,  and  transparency \nof  subnational  public  sector  administration  and  service  delivery;  and  (iii) strengthen  citizens\u2019 \nvoice and participation in local affairs and public service delivery. The Project will enable more \ncommune  councils  to  operate,  develop  the  national  CR  system,  and  strengthen  voters\u2019 \nunderstanding  of  democratic \nrights  and  accountabilities.  These  outcomes  will  help \ninstitutionalize  democratic,  accountable,  and  gender-inclusive  forms  of  local  government  and \npublic service delivery (see the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 4). \n \nB. \n \nComponent 1: Commune Councils Facilities. The output of component 1 will be new \n27. \ncouncil  premises  for  about  235  commune  councils,  providing  the  latter  with  adequate  meeting \nand  operating  facilities,  symbolic  of  the  role  and  significance  of  local  democracy  in  the \ncommune.  The  next  235  or  so  councils  on  the  Government\u2019s  priority  list  will  be  selected  from \namong  the  next  highest  councils  on  the  provincial  listing,  prepared  through  the  independent \nformula-based  needs  and  prioritization  assessment  used  under  CCDP.  In  October  2002,  the \nNational  Committee  for  Support  to  Commune-Sangkat  Councils  agreed  on  a  weighted-factor \nformula  for  prioritizing  communes  within  the  CCDP  budget  allocated  to  each  province.  The \nfactors  are:  existence  and  condition  of  the  commune  office,  commune  population,  and \ncommune  poverty  ranking.  The  formula-based  priority  ordering  will  be  recalculated  using  the \nrecently available commune population data, gathered before the 2007 local elections. The total \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n9 Rainer  Rohdewohld  and  Douglas  Porter.  2006.  Independent  Study  of  Donor  Support  for  Decentralization  and \n\nDeconcentration. Phnom Penh. \n\n\f  9\n\nnumber of commune councils potentially requiring support is 1,006 (excluding the 519 assisted \nunder CCDP and the 20 urban communes in the provinces).  \n \n28. \nThe prioritized communes will be surveyed, detailed designs and estimates completed, \nand  contracts  and  block-grant  agreements  prepared.  These  contracts  and  block-grant \nagreements  will  be  based  on  the  fully  detailed  Implementation  Handbook  developed  under \nCCDP,10 and will include requirements such as availability and ownership of unoccupied land for \nthe  new  council  office,  procurement  and  tendering  guidelines,  use  of  locally  hired  supervising \ntechnicians,  and  the  staged-payment  scheme.  The  average  cost  for  each  office  at  current \nmaterial prices is $19,500. The calculation of the block grant for each council is based on the \nmodel  design  selected,  priced  at  current  local  prices  within  the  commune,  and  with  a  7% \nmarkup  for  contractor  overhead  and  margin.  Any  overall  savings  on  this  component  from \nchanges  in  unit  cost  will  be  used  to  finance  additional  offices  from  the  provincial  priority  lists. \nFinancial  transfer  arrangements  will  use  selected  commune  councils\u2019  specially  contracted \ndeposit accounts at private commercial bank local branches, rather than the provincial treasury \nchannel, as in the first phase of CCDP. \n \n29. \n Initial  orientation  and  training  meetings  will  be  held  in  the  provinces  of  the  prioritized \ncouncils,  leading  to  procurement  and  construction.  The  implementation  phase,  covering  all \nworks in the provinces in each of three zones covering the whole country, will be supervised by \nthe  three  contracted  architect  engineers.  No  operation  and  maintenance  problems  are \nanticipated, as the quality of the completed commune council facilities visited during the design \nphase  survey  continues  to  be  excellent.  An  independent  study  on  CCDP  component  1  noted \nthat  the  commune  facilities  subcomponent  is  recognized  as  innovative  in  Cambodia  and  has \ngained a reputation for being successful, particularly because of the quality of the buildings, the \ndisbursement  rate,  the  Implementation  Handbook,  and  the  current  transfer  system. 11  The \nproject  implementation  schedule  (Appendix  5)  is  based  on  four  batches  of  communes  being \nimplemented  in  parallel.  This  is  designed  to  minimize  implementation  time  and  maximize  the \ncost  efficiency  of  the  Project.  To  achieve  this  efficiency  gain  over  CCDP,  the  ceiling  of  the \nimprest account will be 20% of the grant amount.  \n \nGender.  In  response  to  the  requests  of  senior  officials  from  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s \n30. \nAffairs  to  allow  female  councilors  and  the  Commune  Committees  for  Women  and  Children \n(established  in  2004)  priority  use  of  the  commune  premises,  the  standard  MoI\u2013Commune \nCouncil  Block  Grant  Agreement  will  be  amended  to  include  this  requirement.  In  very  remote \ncommunes  where  no  contractor  is  prepared  to  bid,  component  1  will  use  the  Community \nParticipation in Procurement method, in which the commune council is authorized, after failure \nof  the  bidding  process,  to  split  the  works  into  smaller  contract  packages  (a  lump-sum  labor \ncontract;  materials;  and  construction  management).  During  the  initial  survey  of  each  location, \nthe  project  engineers  will  discuss  the  need  for,  and  practicability  of,  latrines  with  the  council. \n                                                 \n10  The Implementation Handbook includes all the plans, drawings, and design details needed to construct the council \noffice. It specifies all the necessary contract and procurement procedures and forms required by the councils, and \nthe  amounts  payable  to  contractors  for  the  11  stages  of  construction  and  the  five  stages  of  timber  works.  The \n11-stage payment process is directly linked in the Implementation Handbook to the detailed drawings and technical \nguidance for the works in each step. \n\n11  KPMG  and  Asian  Development  Bank.  Commune  Council  Development  Project.  Commune  Facilities \nSub-Component  1-1:  Assessment  of  Financing  and  Implementation  System.  Draft  Report.  28  July  2006.  The \nKPMG report recommends an increase in the percentage of the ADB advance to avoid implementation delays and \nto reduce unnecessary administrative work, including additional overhead costs incurred as a result of extensions \nrequired  for  the  implementation  period.  The  implementation  system  for  component  1  of  this  project  is  nearly \nidentical to that used by CCDP and is independently endorsed by KPMG. \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nWhere no sex-segregated latrines are easily and publicly available in the commune center, and \nwhere it is confirmed that water is available throughout the year, sex-segregated toilets will be \nincluded  in  the  standard  design.  The  future  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  the  council \npremises  are  the  responsibility  of  the  commune  council.  The  administrative  portion  of  the \ncommune and sangkat fund transfer is sufficient to fund such costs. \n \n31. \nComponent 2: Civil Registration System Development. The output of component 2 is \na  sustainable  computer-based  CR  system  with  secured  hard-copy  records  and  a  central \nsearchable  and  extendable  database.  This  component  builds  on  the  recommendations  and \nlessons  on  the  future  development  of  Cambodia\u2019s  CR  system,  as  indicated  by  the  ADB  study \nEstablishing  Legal  Identity  for  Social  Inclusion,  referred  to  earlier. 12 The  major  activities  in \nimplementing  component  2  will  be  to:  secure  storage  facilities  for  one  copy  of  all  CR  record \nbooks  within  the  MoI  in  Phnom  Penh;  arrange  for  one  copy  of  all  complete  CR  books  to  be \ntransferred to MoI, and filed and indexed accurately; recruit (by the Government) additional staff \n(male  and  female  with  a  minimum  of  first  year  university  education  or  its  equivalent)  for  the \nOffice  of  Civil  Registration  (OoCR)  to  manage  the  CR  system  in  perpetuity;  develop  the \nsoftware and hardware specifications and systems for the central database; write, pilot, and test \nsoftware programs; procure computers, servers, scanners, and other necessary hardware; train \nOoCR  staff  and  operators  in  equipment  use  and  data  entry;  and  formalize  data-entry  quality \ncontrol procedures and protocols. Once these elements are in place, scanning and data entry, \nwith checking and quality control, should begin in 2008. \n \n32. \nA  system  for  collecting,  updating,  and  analyzing  CR  records  of  births,  deaths,  and \nmarriages  is  an  essential  element  of  any  country\u2019s  demographic  infrastructure.  Because  they \nestablish  documentary  evidence  of  parentage,  marriage,  age,  origin,  and  family  structure,  CR \nrecords  are  also  the  essential  foundation  for  human,  gender,  and  child  rights,  as  these  will \nensure  the  conservation  of  vital  records  and  thus  promote  legal  certainty,  transparency, \nprotection  of  women\u2019s  and  children\u2019s  property  and  inheritance  rights  from  abuse,  and \npredictability  in  accessing  basic  social  services  and  productive  resources.  The  MoI  has \nexpressed  its  long-standing  concern  to  preserve  the  hard-copy  CR  records,  which  are  now \nstored in 180 district offices and provincial courts, many of them threatened by humidity, floods, \nand  deterioration,  and  to  establish  a  modern  computerized  system  for  cataloging,  accessing, \nand updating the records. This component effectively tackles the most urgent task of halting the \ndeterioration of the collected records.  \n \nComponent  3:  Capacity  Development.  The  output  of  component  3  is  trained \n33. \ncouncilors,  clerks,  and  government  officials  and  a  24-month  mass  media  campaign.  The \ncomponent  includes  two  funds:  a  training  fund  to  support  activities  included  in  DoLA\u2019s  annual \ntraining  plan,  and  a  mass  media  fund  to  continue  and  develop  the  public  awareness  work \nlaunched  by  CCDP.  The  major  implementation  activities  financed  from  the  training  fund  are: \nsupporting  DoLA\u2019s  Capacity  Building  Office  (CBO),  with  other  DoLA  capacity  development \nproviders, to prepare the annual training plan; identifying the items in the annual training plan to \nbe supported by the training fund; reviewing and strengthening the content and methodology of \ntraining  modules  and  materials  for  consistency  with  laws  and  concepts  of  local  democracy; \n\n                                                 \n12  MoI is updating the 2000 CR sub-decree, to harmonize the CR legislation  with the current National Identity Card \nand Household Book systems. Plan International has committed to provide the necessary legal TA to achieve this. \nFor this reason, this item is not budgeted under this component. If for any reason Plan International cannot provide \nthis support, assistance may be offered to MoI from within this component or the project contingency (or both) with \na minor change in scope. \n\n\f  11\n\nreviewing  and  strengthening  the  gender  content  and  methodology  of  training  modules  and \nmaterials;  contracting    training  providers  and  monitoring  implementation,  with  the  DoLA  CBO \nand  in  the  component  management  information  systems  (MIS);  undertaking  small-sample \nimpact studies, including gender-disaggregated data. The new councilors, to be elected in the \n1 April 2007 commune elections, will require orientation and systems training, and the growth in \nscope of training topics in the DoLA training plan requires financing support. The major national \ntraining  programs  in  the  2006  DoLA  annual  training  plan  are:  monitoring  and  evaluation  for \nfinance  and  administration,  conflict  resolution,  domestic  violence,  natural  resources  and \nenvironmental  management,  health  and  education,  child  rights  and  protection,  and  facilitation \nskills. \n \n34.  Mass Media Fund: Mainstreaming Gender. The major activities for the implementation \nof  the  mass  media  fund  are:  developing,  with  DoLA,  the  key  local  democracy  messages\u2014\nincluding  local  democratic  roles  and  accountabilities,  commune  council  services,  legal  identity \nand  CR,  and  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  women  councilors  and  of  WCFP\u2014to  be \npromulgated  through  public  awareness  campaigning;  outlining  a  24-month  multimedia  public \nawareness  campaign;  identifying  and  procuring  experienced  local  providers  for  each  media \ntype;  reviewing  and  strengthening  the  content  and  methodology  of  draft  media  materials  for \nconsistency  with  key  local  democracy  messages;  reviewing  and  strengthening  the  gender \ncontent and methodology of the draft media materials; and commissioning small-sample impact \nstudies,  including  gender-disaggregated  data,  of  the  effect  of  each  element  of  the  awareness \ncampaign.  The  mass  media  fund  will  be  used  for  producing,  broadcasting,  and  evaluating \ndecentralization  and  local  democracy  messages,  using  a  mix  of  media  (theater,  TV,  radio, \nposters,  leaflets).  Component  3  builds  on  the  experience  and  achievements  of  the  CCDP \ncapacity-building  component,  and  addresses  its  identified  weaknesses  (see  Appendix  2).  The \nlatter  relate  to  the  need  for  long-term  capacity  development  assistance,  mainstreaming  of \ngender, and integrating training activities with DoLA\u2019s training plan. In addition, the consultants \nwill give priority to developing an appropriate system for planning the use of the two funds, and \nfor reporting what has been achieved with the finances disbursed, including full sex segregation. \nThe  component  will  supplement  the  activity-monitoring  data  in  the  MIS  with  commissioned \nsmall-sample  evaluations  of  the  effect  of  activities  financed  from  both  the  training  and  mass \nmedia funds. \n \nC. \n \nThe  Project  has  five  special  features.  First,  it  follows  up  the  successfully  implemented \n35. \nCCDP.  Second,  this  support  is  premised  on  a  long-term  commitment  to  support  incoming \ndecentralization  reforms  in  Cambodia.  Third,  the  Project  is  a  further  ADB  contribution  to  key \nelements  of  state  building  in  a  historically  fractured  country.  Fourth,  gender  is  mainstreamed \ninto  all  activities  of  the  Project.  In  addition,  the  TA  provided  with  the  Project  is  aimed  at \nstrengthening the capacity of elected women councilors and WCFPs in six targeted provinces. \nFinally, the Project will assist the implementation of DoLA\u2019s gender strategy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nD. \n \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\n \nBase Cost \n1.

This  percentage  is  fully  justified  by  the  experience  of  the  Commune  Council  Development \nProject  (CCDP).  For  financial  contingencies,  all  contracting  and  payments  are  in  US  dollars.  Notably,  for \ncomponent 1, which is the majority of the Project, all transfers to commune accounts with a commercial bank and \nall reporting are in US dollars. The block grant for each commune council is calculated at local commune prices, as \ndescribed in the project description above. Because component 1 finances many small  discrete items  (commune \ncouncil premises) any significant increase in unit price is simply met through a reduction in the number that can be \nfinanced. In CCDP, the contingencies budget line was used to finance the second batch of 95 council offices. This \nis  an  inefficient  way  to  operate,  however,  since  it  requires  the  three  supervising  architect  engineers  to  revisit \ncompleted provinces to oversee a small number of second-batch works. \n\nAmount \n \n6.82 \n0.73 \n1.46 \n0.06 \n9.07 \n0.71 \n9.78 \n\nTotal (A+B) \n\nADF IX Grant Component \n\nThe total project cost is $9.78 million, including taxes and duties, and contingencies.

It is recommended that ADB \nprovide  the  Project  with  $7.8  million  grant  financing  from  ADF  IX  grant  facilities.

The  Project  will  not  create  a  separate  project \nmanagement unit, but will work within the MoI structure. The following organogram sets out the \nstructure of project management: \n \n\nOrganization for Project Management     \n\n                                                                            \n\nProject Director \n(Director General MoI/GDLA) \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Manager \n(Director DoLA) \n\nProject \nAdministrator/coordinator\n(DoLA)\n\n \n\nDoLA Project Accountant \nTA: 1 l-t National \n\n \n\nDoLA Local  \nFinance Specialist \n\nC1 \u2013 Commune Facilities \n(DoLA) \nTA: 1 C1 Manager + 3 \n\nC2 \u2013 Civil Reg\u2019n System \n(DGA/OoCR)  \nTA: 1 l-t National\nDGA  =      Department  of  General  Administration,  DoLA  =  Department  of  Local  Adminsitration,  GDLA  =  General \n \nDepartment of Local Administration, MoI = Ministry  of Interior, OoCR = Office of Civil  Registration, TA = technical \n \nassistance.\n \nA Project Technical Cell (PTC) will be established within MoI before the effective date.15 \n40. \nThe  PTC  will  consist  of  a  project  director,  a  project  manager,  a  project  administrator-\ncoordinator, and five other MoI staff. The director general of the General Department of Local \nAdministration (GDLA) will be appointed project director, the director of DoLA will be appointed \nproject manager, and a senior staff member of DoLA will be appointed project administrator and \n\nC3 \u2013 Capacity Building \n(DoLA) \nTA: 2 l-t National + 1 p-t Int\u2019l\n\n                                                 \n15 The purpose of this arrangement is to establish clear responsibility for project implementation, but without creating \na  separate  ADB  project  management  unit  and  office  within  DoLA.  With  seven  decentralization  support  projects \ncurrently working within DoLA, there is a risk of balkanization into separate donor-led fiefdoms, as has happened in \nother  ministries  in  Cambodia.  This  arrangement  is  very  similar  to  that  which  worked  well  for  CCDP  (see \nAppendix 2). \n\n\f2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\ncoordinator.  Of  the  five MoI  staff,  four  will  be  appointed  from  DoLA  and  one  will  be  appointed \nfrom the OoCR. The four DoLA staff will be separately responsible for component 1, component \n3,  project  accounting  and  Local  Finance  issues.  The  staff  from  OoCR  will  be  responsible  for \ncomponent 2. The Project Manager with the support of the project administrator and coordinator \nwill lead project implementation and will prepare and submit reports to the project director, who \nwill in turn report to ADB; liaise with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF); and ensure \nthat all Project activities are in line with ADB procedures and guidelines. The PTC will receive \nsupport from a team of consultants, consisting of a project team leader, an accountant, and a \nfew other national consultants.  \n \n41. \nThe project team leader will work closely with the project administrator and coordinator. \nComponent 1 will be implemented by commune and sangkat councils with support from DoLA \nand  the  component 1  consultant  team.  Component  2  will  be  implemented  by  OoCR,  with \nsupport from a long-term national consultant, the project team leader, the project administrator, \nthe DoLA project accountant, and consultant accountants. Component 2 implementation will be \ncoordinated  throughout  with  the  other  civil  registration  partners:  Plan  International  and  the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Component 3 will be implemented by CBO, with support from \ntwo full-time national consultants and one part-time international consultant.  \n \n \n \n42. \nThe Project implementation period is 2.5 years (30 months). The Project is expected to \nstart  in  January  2007,  to  be  completed  by  30  June  2009,  and  to  be  closed  by  31  December \n2009.   \n \n \n \nCivil  works,  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s \n43. \nProcurement  Guidelines.  Procurement  of  all  equipment  and  services  will  be  managed  by  the \nproject  administrator,  with  support  from  the  project  team  leader,  DoLA,  and  consultant \naccountants.  Civil  works  and  goods  that  relate  to  component  1  will  use  the  same  procedures \ndeveloped under CCDP. The facilities subsidy will be transferred as a block grant (an average \nof $19,500 for each commune) to each selected commune, and works will be procured through \nprocedures  defined  in  the  CCDP\u2019s  Implementation  Handbook  (as  amended  from  time  to  time) \nby  the  commune  council  procurement  committee  (within  the  limits  of  the  fixed  actual  current \nlocal  cost  of  the  model  design  selected).  All  equipment,  goods,  and  services  that  relate  to \ncomponents 2 and 3 will be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB) if the value is \nequal  to  or  more  than  $100,000  and  through  shopping  if  the  value  is  less  than  $100,000. \nProcurement carried out through NCB will be in line with the Government\u2019s procurement manual \ndated  19 September  2005  for  externally  financed  projects  and  programs  in  Cambodia.  The \ndetailed procurement plan is in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \n44. \nA total of 266 person-months of consulting services will be required: 25 person-months \nof  international  consultants  (9%)  and  241  person-months  of  national  consultants  (91%). \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  by  the  EA  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the consultants are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A. \nThe consultants will have the following fields of expertise: engineering and architecture, capacity \ndevelopment,  data  management,  accounting,  gender  mainstreaming, mass  media,  and  impact \n\nConsulting Services \n\nProcurement \n\n4. \n\n3. \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  15\n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nevaluation  studies.  Consultants  for  impact  evaluation  studies  will  be  engaged  through  a  firm \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection method. For other fields of expertise, consultants will \nbe  recruited  individually.  For  individual  consultants,  the  EA  will  rank  at  least  three  consultants \nand recommend the highest-ranked individual to ADB. \n \n \n \n45. \nThe Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) and policy relating \nto  the  combating  of  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the \nGovernment  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational best practice standards to prevent corruption or money-laundering activities or the \nfinancing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The \ndesign  of  the  Project  benefited  from  an  audit  and  review  by  KPMG  of  the  CCDP  project \nmethodology,  including  a  review  of  financial  management,  procurement,  and  potential \ncorruption  issues.  As  a  result,  the  proposed  Project  contains  a  number  of  financial  control \nmechanisms  to  minimize  the  risk  of  fund  misappropriation  or  misuse,  especially  the  potential \nrisks  in  component  1.  The  documentation  and  substantiation  requirements  of  the  Project  will \nfurther  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these  undertakings.  In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nsuccessful  monitoring  system  of  CCDP  will  be  continued,  including  the  matching  of  physical \ncompletion  of  each  phase  of  construction  (certified  by  the  project  team)  with  each  account\u2019s \ndisbursement rate (through the monthly financial statements), with improvements recommended \nby a recent audit or review, for example, the centralization of all this information with the PTC by \nthe  Project\u2019s  accountant.  Annual  financial  audits  will  be  made,  and  financial  reporting \nmechanisms will be integrated with the MIS, in support of the quarterly reporting mechanisms. \nOther  detailed  anticorruption  features  include  standardized  quality-  and  cost-control  measures \nand the use of a specialized team to inspect all construction phases (para. 19). \n \n \n \n46. \nThe Government will open a dollar imprest account for the project with the National Bank \nof  Cambodia  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  account  will  be  established,  managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2001),  as \namended from time to time. MEF will delegate the administration of this account to the EA. The \nadvance will be deposited into the imprest account on the basis of the projected expenditures \nfor the next 6 months, while maintaining an imprest account ceiling of 20% of the grant amount. \nStatement of expenditures (SoE) procedures may be used to liquidate and replenish the imprest \naccount for eligible expenditures not exceeding $80,000 for a single payment. For component 1, \nthe  block-grant  funds  will  be  transferred  directly  from  the  imprest  account  to  the  commune \ncouncils\u2019  bank  account,  which  will  be  opened  by  each  of  the  commune  councils  at  private \ncommercial  bank  local  branches  located  nearest  their  commune.16 For  components  2  and  3, \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n6. \n\n                                                 \n16 Similar to what was agreed on for the second batch of 95 commune facilities under CCDP. The letter, Reference \nNo.  5260,  dated  24  August  2005,  addressed  to  the  deputy  prime  minister  and  co-minister  of  MoI  from  His \nExcellency Keat Chon, Finance Minister, requested the opening of a commune account at the ACLEDA Bank for \nthe  construction  of  the  commune  offices  under  CCDP/ADB  Loan  No.:  1953-CAM  (SF).  The  MEF  agreed  in \nprinciple to the request of MoI. If a unified funds flow mechanism is decreed by the Government as a result of its \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\ndisbursements  will  be  made  from  the  imprest  account  to  contractors  and  implementors.  The \nimprest  account  and  SoE  records  will  be  audited  during  the  annual  audit  process.  These \narrangements will be described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n47. \nThe  DoLA  project  accountant  will  be  trained  and  mentored  by  a  full-time  national \nconsultant  accountant.  Working  together,  the  DoLA  project  accountant  and  the  consultant \naccountant  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  all  Project  accounts,  documenting  local \nexpenditure, and preparing quarterly and annual financial reports. These will be approved by the \nproject manager and the project director and submitted to ADB. Accounting for the Project will \nbe  separate  from  other  financial  accounts  of  MoI.  The  accounting  system  will  be  according  to \nthe  Financial  Management  Manual  issued  by  MEF  in  September  2006.  Audits  of  project \naccounts  will  be  carried  out  by  international  audit  companies  established  in  Cambodia, \naccording  to  international  financial  reporting  standards  and  international  audit  standards. 17 \nCertified copies of the annual audits will be submitted to ADB, in English, within 9 months after \nthe close of each year (in view of the scattered nature of component 1, a reporting period of less \nthan 9 months would be unrealistic). The independent external auditing services will be financed \nfrom  the  grant  proceeds.  DoLA  will  draft  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation, with support from the project team leader and other consultants, for the project \nmanager  and  project  director,  and  ADB.  The  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB and MEF within 30 days of the end of each quarter. Project staff will draft a \nproject  completion  report  for  submission  to  the  project  manager  and  project  director.  This \ncompletion report will be submitted to ADB not later than 3 months after the physical completion \nof the Project. \n \n \n \n48. \nThe  quarterly  and  annual  reports  will  accord  with  the  indicators  for  the  outcomes  and \noutputs specified in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 4). They will be as concise \nand factual as possible, and in a format acceptable to ADB.18 These reports will also monitor the \nsignificant risk for outcomes of the design and monitoring framework. The Project will lay down \nan  analytical  framework  and  a  data  collection  mechanism  for  an  impact  evaluation  of  its \ncommune  council  facilities  component  to  be  undertaken  at  a  later  date.19 The  baseline  survey \nwill  be  conducted  at  the  start  of  the  Project  and  a  repeat  survey  will  be  conducted  at  project \ncompletion.  ADB  will  work  with  DoLA  to  develop  a  specific  design  of  the  surveys.  This  data- \ncollection mechanism will be funded under the Project.  \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n8. \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \npublic  financial  management  reform,  this  disbursement  arrangement  may  be  reviewed  by  both  the  Government \nand ADB. \n\n17 CCDP  was  audited  by  KPMG  in  2003  and  2004.  Neither  the  audit  reports  nor  the  management  letters  for  both \nyears  raised  any  matters  of  significant  concern  in  terms  of  the  Project\u2019s  financial  management,  procurement, \naccounting, or record keeping systems, or compliance with required procedures. The audit for 2005 is ongoing.  \n18 These  reports  will  cover:  factual  information  on  progress  against  target  (sex-disaggregated  where  appropriate), \ntechnical  and  financial;  brief  written  commentary  on  progress  against  target,  including  note  of  any  problems \nencountered  during  the  quarter;  remedial  measures  taken  or  proposed;  and  activities  proposed  for  the  following \nquarter. \n\n19 The  evaluation  method  will  combine  the  methods  of  propensity  score  matching  and  double  differences,  using \ncommune  and  household  data.  The  data  will  be  collected  through  surveys  designed  in  three  stages  (province, \ncommune, and household) with sample households stratified by poverty level (poorest, middle income, and richest) \nselected from each sampled commune. The total sample will comprise 100 project communes and 100 nonproject \ncommunes, with 15 households to be surveyed in each sampled commune. \n\n\f  17\n\nProject Review \n\n \n9. \n \n49. \nAbout 15 months after Project start-up, around March 2008, an MTR will be carried out \nby  ADB  and  the  Government.  The  MTR  will  identify  changes  since  appraisal;  assess \nimplementation  performance;  review  compliance  with  covenants  and  assurances;  identify \nproblems and constraints; and make recommendations. The recommendations will include the \nuse  and  allocation  of  the  contingencies  budget  line.  One  person-month  of  international \nconsulting  services  and  1  person-month  of  national  consulting  services  have  been  budgeted \nunder the Project for the MTR. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n50. \n  A TA grant will be provided and implemented simultaneously with the Project. The TA \nis  estimated  to  cost  $236,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance  $200,000  equivalent,  to  be  funded \nfrom the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund, which is administered by ADB. The will \nbe support the advancement of gender equity in local governance. It will strengthen the capacity \nof  elected  women  councilors  and  WCFPs  in  six  target  provinces  by  activating  women \nnetworking  forums  within  districts  and  communes.  The  forums  will  provide  women  with \nopportunities  to  share  their  experience  and  self-learning,  promote  mutual  support  and \nnetworking,  build  confidence,  increase  visibility,  and  improve  work  performance.  A  qualified \nnational  nongovernment  organization,  the  Women  for  Prosperity,  will  be  recruited  through \nsingle-source selection for a period not exceeding 18 months to implement the TA activities (see \nAppendix 8 for the justification). The services are expected to begin in the second half of 2007, \nor 3 months after the Project takes effect, and to be completed 1 year later, in 2008. Equipment, \nsupplies,  and  materials  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines. The detailed TA description and cost estimates are in Appendix 8. The EA will be \nDoLA.   \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\n \nA. \n \n51. \nThe  Project  will  enable  local  administration  to  function  effectively  and  increase  civil \nsociety\u2019s  participation  in  local  public  affairs.  The  benefits  of  component  1  are  an  extension  of \nthose  already  evident  for  519  commune  councils,  as  described  in  the  CCDP  review  of \nMarch 2006. Benefits will accrue to different groups. First, elected councilors and the clerk in the \nprioritized  communes  will  benefit  from  having  working  space,  storage,  and  meeting  rooms  of \ndifferent sizes. This is in sharp contrast to the current norm of councilors variously attempting to \nrun  council  business  from  a  wooden  shack,  pagoda,  school,  or  the  chief\u2019s  house.  Second, \nnational and provincial officials needing to work in a beneficiary commune will have appropriate \nmeeting facilities, at a universally familiar location, at their disposal. Most importantly, the whole \npopulation  of  Cambodia  will  benefit  through  the  powerful  physical  symbol  which  the  new \npremises  provide,  and  the  extent  to  which  this  contributes  to  firmly  embedding  the  new \ninstitution  of  local  democracy  in  Cambodia.  The  use  of  traditional  Khmer-style  architecture, \ncoupled  with  the  familiar  symbols of  peace  and  prosperity  (as  used on  the  National  Assembly \nbuildings), conveys the significance and status of the local democratic process.  \n \n52. \nThe  benefit  of  component  2  is  its  contribution  to  providing  Cambodia  with  another \nessential piece of state-building infrastructure: a modern computerized CR system. This will be \n\n\fof benefit to the whole population over time. It will provide households with the documentation \nnecessary to prove citizenship, place of origin, parentage, age, marital status, inheritance, and \nentitlement  to  land  and  property.  Women  will  particularly  benefit  from  the  legal  foundation  for \nmarriage, divorce, property rights, inheritance, and parentage. Children will benefit through the \nability to establish age, parentage, and place of origin. Cambodia will benefit from having up-to-\ndate  information  on  citizenship  and  improved  data  on  demographic  trends.  Over  time,  this \nsystem  is  expected  to  be  merged  with,  and  simplify,  current  systems  of  household  books  and \nidentity cards. This component will help conserve and build on the remarkable achievement of \nthe  past  3  years:  the  very  successful,  first-ever  CR  (births,  death,  and  marriage  formalization) \nprocess. \n \n53. \nThe  training  fund  will  directly  benefit  new  and  previously  elected  commune  councilors, \nas  well  as  clerks.  PLAUs  and  other  officials  will  benefit  from  modern,  cost-effective  training  in \nbasic concepts of local democracy and accountabilities, and in the key tasks they are expected \nto perform. More efficient, aware, and committed commune councils will bring benefits to their \nelectors.  Considering  the  evaluation  evidence  from  CCDP  component  2,  the  24-month  mass \nmedia  campaign  will  benefit  most  of  the  population  by  introducing  or  reinforcing  essential \ndemocratic  concepts  and  practices.  Not  yet  firmly  defined  and  embedded  in  popular \nconsciousness are critical concepts such as legitimate opposition, elector rights, voluntarism in \ncouncil  operations,  the  respective  roles  and  legitimacy  of  councilors  and  officials,  greater \nrecognition of gender equality issues, strengthened capacity of women to serve more effectively \nin  the  commune  councils,  the  functions  of  the  different  council  committees,  the  relationship \nbetween the chief and other council members, the appropriate role of political parties, and the \nrelationship  between  the  council  and  provincial  line  departments.  The  population  will  also \nbenefit  from  the  information  provided  about  the  role  of  local  councils  in  direct  service  delivery \nand local development.   \n \nThe  combined  outcome  of  the  three  components  of  this  Project\u2014enabling  more \n54. \ncommune councils to operate effectively, developing the national CR system, and strengthening \nrelated  capacities\u2014will  be  a  further  strengthening  of  the  institutions  of  open,  participatory \ndemocracy  on  which  poverty  reduction,  human,  and  gender  rights  depend.  The  ultimate \nbeneficiaries  will  be  the  whole  population  and  the  development  process  in  Cambodia. \nCommune  democracy  has  unequivocally  been  the  most  important  development  since  1993  in \ndeepening  democratization  within  Cambodia,  moving  the  country  away  from  its  historically \nhierarchic,  centralized,  and  elite-dominated  past.  The  anticipated  creation  of  indirectly  elected \ndistrict and provincial councils (elected by commune councils) means that the new institution of \ncommune  democracy  will  shortly  begin  to  affect  other  subnational  tiers  and  thus  most  service \ndelivery  in  Cambodia.  The  potential  benefits  of  greater  popular  voice  and  accountability  over \nresources and services for provinces and districts are substantial. \n \n55. \nEnvironment  and  Social  Safeguards.  The  Project  does  not  envisage  any  adverse \nenvironmental  effect  from  the  construction  of  the  new  commune  council  facilities.  Based  on \nADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual,  Section  F1,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  at  the  level  of \ninitial  environmental  examination  is  not  required.  The  Project  will  comply  with  the  applicable \ngovernment requirements for building, safety, and sanitary permits, and with the building code. \nThe Project will not have any resettlement impact. For component 1, as part of the criteria for \nblock-grant  approval,  commune  councils  will  be  required  to  confirm  that  the  land  used  for  the \nfacilities  is  registered  in  their  ownership,  and  not  being  used  or  occupied  for  economic  or \nresidential  purposes.  These  undertakings  will  be  checked  by  the  three  supervising  contracted \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  19\n\nRisks \n\narchitect engineers during their initial site visits, according to the appropriate screening criteria \nfor  land  selection,  review,  and  clearance  procedures  to  be  included  in  the  PAM.  No  land \nacquisition or resettlement is required for components 2 and 3 of the Project. \n \nB. \n \n56. \n Several sources of risk can be identified. Corruption is one of these. Construction funds \ncould  be  misused,  materials  could  be  defective  or  of  poor  quality,  and  substandard  designs \ncould be applied. This risk will be mitigated by the project design, which establishes a rigorous \nquality specification and control, including an operations manual for constructors; quality checks \nbefore, during, and after construction by a permanent project team created for this purpose; by \nthe specification of standardized designs to facilitate cost monitoring and control; by very tight \ncost  margins,  which  minimize  opportunities  to  overstate  costs;  and  by  the  moral  suasion \nresulting from the high status accorded to construction of commune council buildings under the \nProject. \n \n57. \nThere  is  also  the  risk  that  capacity of  local administration will  still  be weak  by  the  time \nthe  responsibilities  and  resources  are  turned  over,  or  that  the  commune  councils  are  not \nresponsive  enough  to  their  constituents\u2019  needs.  The  capacity  development  component  of  this \nproject,  in  conjunction  with  diverse  activities  of  other  development  partners,  is  aimed  at \nmitigating  capacity  gaps.  The  final  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  the  public  awareness  campaign \nfunded by the Project, by the actions of other donors, and by the competitive political process at \nthe  local  level,  which  is  expected  to  make  local  officials  more  sensitive  to  the  needs  of  their \ncommunities because of electoral accountability. \n \n58. \nThere  is  a  risk  as  well  that  the  process  of  D&D  is  either  mismanaged  or  not  fully \nimplemented.  Further,  there  is  the  risk  that  even  when  functions  are  transferred,  adequate \nresources  will  not  be  provided  and  local  governments  will  therefore  remain  weak.  This \nuncertainty goes beyond the scope of this project, but is partly mitigated by the Government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  its  reform  agenda,  as  evidenced  most  recently  by  the  preparation  of  the  draft \nOrganic law for Deconcentration and Decentralization and the preparation of an implementation \nframework  for  this  purpose.  This  risk  is  further  mitigated  by  the  participation  of  other \ndevelopment partners working with the Government to address key implementation issues. As \nbefore,  there  is  always  the  risk  of  possible  capture  of  the  local  government  by  the  rich  and \npowerful,  or  of  local  councils  not  operating  openly  and  democratically.  However,  available \nassessments perceive a positive effect of local democratic processes in reducing the risk of elite \ncapture  and  financial  abuse.  Local  development  projects  appear  to  be  free  from  elite  capture \nand are seen to benefit the majority rather than the few. The public does not see their councils \nas adversely affected by partisan politics, although more than one third of councilors do.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n59. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the Ministry of Interior have \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  its  counterpart  contributions  for  the  Project \nimplementation on time and ensure prompt availability of the contribution during \neach year of project implementation. \nThe  Government  and  MoI  will  ensure  that  only  commune  councils  listed  as \npriority in the provincial listing, prepared based on the formula-based needs and \npriority  assessment  as  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB  will  receive \nfunding under component 1. \nThe  Government  and  MoI  will  ensure  that  the  arrangements  agreed  under \nCCDP, whereby commune councils can use a special account maintained with a \nprivate  commercial  bank  for  managing  their  block  grant  transfers,  will  be \ncontinued for this project. \nTo  ensure  the  smooth  transfer  of  the  block  grants  to  each  of  the  selected \ncommune  councils,  immediately  upon  approval  of  the  block  grants  and  the \nsigning  of  the  Block  Grant  Agreement,  each  of  the  commune  councils  will \nestablish a bank account at a local branch of a commercial bank acceptable to \nADB. \nThe  Government  and  MoI  will  ensure  that  each  of  the  commune  councils \nimplementing activities under component 1 will be responsible for ensuring that \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002), and best environmental practices are incorporated into all project \ndesigns and implementation.  \nThe  Government  and  MoI  will  not  approve  any  block  grant  that  entails  land \nacquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  including  land  donation.  They  will  not \napprove  any  block  grant  that  involves  involuntary  resettlement  according  to \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). To be eligible for block grants \nthe commune councils are required to confirm that the land used for the facilities \nis  titled  and  registered  in  their  ownership,  and  not  being  used  or  occupied  for \neconomic  or  residential  purposes.  These  undertakings  will  be  checked  by  the \ncontracted architect engineers during their initial site visits. \nTo  ensure  that  women  benefit  equally  from  the  Project  and  interventions  avoid \ngender bias, the Government and MoI will ensure that the Project will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998).  The \nGovernment will further ensure that the agreed gender action plan (GAP) for this \nProject is implemented in a timely manner over the entire project period, and that \nadequate  resources  are  allocated  for  this  purpose.  Implementation  of  the  GAP \nwill  be  closely  monitored,  and  the  progress  will  be  reported  in  the  quarterly \nreports to ADB. \nThe  Government  and  MoI  will  ensure  that  the  Department  of  General \nAdministration  Office  of  Civil  Registration  will  recruit  additional  and  sufficient \nnumber  of  young  and  educated  male  and  female  staff,  with  a  minimum  of \nuniversity education, to be trained to manage the computerized civil registration \ndatabase in perpetuity. \nAlthough  the  Project  does  not  envisage  any  adverse  impact  on  indigenous \npeoples, the Recipient and MoI will ensure that the Project will be prepared and \nimplemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), in \norder to increase the quality and access of information through the mass media \nactivities received by indigenous peoples. \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f  21\n\nB. \n \n60. \n \n\n \n\nConditions for Grant Effectiveness \n\nPrior to loan effectiveness, the following will have been completed: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  director  general  of  MoI\u2019s  General  Department  of  Local  Administration  will \nhave been appointed as the project director; \nThe director of DoLA will have been appointed as the project manager; \nA  senior  staff  from  DoLA  will  have  been  appointed  as  the  project  administrator \nand coordinator; and \nThe  project  technical  cell  (PTC)  consisting  of  the  project  director,  project \nmanager,  project  administrator  and  coordinator  and  five  other  staff  of  MoI  will \nhave been established. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n61. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $7,800,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, on terms and conditions substantially in accordance with those \nset  forth  in  the  draft  Grant  Agreement  presented  to  the  Board,  for  the  Commune  Council \nDevelopment Project 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n14 November 2006\n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nOverview.  Cambodia  is  traditionally  a  centralized  society.  The  long-term  institutional \nreform  process  of  decentralization  and  deconcentration  (D&D)  of  public  decision  making  and \nservices delivery was started in 2001 with the creation of the commune councils, and with the \ndirect  elections  for  these  councils  in  February  2002.  This  process  has  been  the  single  most \nsignificant  state-building  development  since  the  1993  Constitution.  It  is  implicitly  aimed  at \nstrengthening three key conditions of state effectiveness: organizational design, structure of the \npolitical system, and legitimization. Draft legislation (Organic\u2014or constitutional\u2014Law) to reform \nthe  entire  subnational  state  structure  (provinces,  districts,  and  communes  in  rural  areas  and \nmunicipalities;  khans  and  sangkats  in  urban  areas)  is  now  being  reviewed  within  government \nand  is  expected  to  be  submitted  to  the  National  Assembly  in  2007.  This  draft  legislation \nanticipates  the  formation  of  new  councils,  elected  by  commune  councilors,  in  provinces  and \ndistricts, and the progressive devolution of responsibility for delivering major services from line \nministries to \u201cunified administrations\u201d in provinces and districts. Important new opportunities thus \nopen up for increased accountability through greater democratic scrutiny of service provision.1 \n \n2. \nSubnational  Structure.  After  the  Paris  peace  talks  in  1991,  Cambodia\u2019s  new  1993 \nConstitution  created  a  national  structure  of  administration  comprising  20  provinces  with  171 \ndistricts, and four municipalities (Phnom Penh, Kep, Pailin, and Sihanoukville) with 14 khans. At \nthe  lowest  tier  of  state  administration  are  the  commune  and  sangkat.  Cambodia  has  1,621 \ncommunes and sangkats. Of these, 1,510 are (mostly rural) communes in the 20 provinces, and \n111  are  urban  sangkats  in  the  municipalities,  most  of  them  in  Phnom  Penh.2 Until  2002,  all \nthese subnational entities were run by appointed governors, accountable upward to the Ministry \nof  Interior  (MoI).  Public  services  are  delivered  by  vertically  accountable  line  ministries,  with \nminimal operational linkage with the provincial, district, or commune authorities. \n \n3. \nElected  Commune  Councils  and  Functions.  Elections  for  the  first  5-year  council \nmandate  were  held  in  February  2002.  The  second  mandate  commune  and  sangkat  council \nelections will be in April 2007.3 The electoral system specified in the commune election law is a \nparty-slate system, which ensures that councilors from different political parties are represented \non  each  council,  and  learn  to  work  together.  In  terms  of  mandated  responsibilities,  the \nCommune Administration Act 2001 gave councils \u201clocal affairs\u201d duties to maintain security and \npublic  order;  manage  public  services;  promote  welfare,  economic,  and  social  development; \nprotect and conserve the environment; and promote tolerance and mutual understanding. The \n2002 subdecree decentralizing powers, roles, and duties to commune and sangkat councils set \nout two roles for them: to \u201cpromote and facilitate the development of the commune-sangkat by \ninvoking assistance, and mobilizing capacities\u201d (article 11); and to \u201cpromote and coordinate the \n\n                                                 \n1   The  ongoing  enactment  of  supporting  legal  framework  for  this  lowest  level  of  local  administration  is  moving  in \ntandem with the conceptualization of the decentralization and deconcentration program. The preparatory and initial \nstage  of  this  long-term  process  will  run  through  2007\u20132008,  with  major  tasks  being  the  establishment  of  the \nimplementation authority, and its structures, systems, and procedures. A transition phase, from 2009 to 2012, will \nthen expand the concrete transfer of basic national and subnational functions, duties, and resources.  \n\n2   The average commune or sangkat had about 8,000 residents in 1998. However, there is a large variance around \nthat  average:  35%  of  communes  and  sangkat  had  fewer  than  5,000  people,  while  20%  had  more  than  10,000. \nThere  is  a  similarly  large  variance  in  the  size  of  districts  and  provinces.  The  number  of  districts  varies  from  5  in \nMondolkiri to 16 in Kampong Cham. The number of communes varies from 21 in Mondolkiri, where communes are \nparticularly large and thinly populated, to 173 in Kampong Cham. \n\n3   Instead of a state-appointed chief, communes and sangkats are now managed by a chief who is the elected leader \nof a multiparty council with 5 to 11 members, depending on the size of the commune. Of the 11,261 commune and \nsangkat councilors elected in February 2002, 8.5% are female and about 10.2% are from ethnic minorities. They \nare elected for a 5-year term and receive a small monthly stipend from government. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n23\n\nprocess of democracy in the commune-sangkat\u201d (article 12). However, the powers provided by \nboth the act and the sub-decree are essentially discretionary and supplementary, since councils \nare not responsible for the delivery of major services and have highly constrained human and \nfinancial resources.4      \n \n4. \nCommune Council Resources. Only one member of the council staff, the council clerk, \nis an MoI employee.5 The council\u2019s main revenue source is a formula-based allocation from the \nCommune  Fund,  established  by  Government  in  the  2001  legislation.  The  average  commune \nallocation  from  the  Commune  Fund  is  $12,000  a  year  for  each  commune.  Two  thirds  of  this \namount  is  for  commune  development  (in  practice,  mainly  small-scale  rural  infrastructure)  and \none  third  is  for  the  council\u2019s  administrative  costs.6 Option  studies  for  increasing  local  revenue \nare under way, although current indications are that the buoyant forms of revenue may become \navailable  only  in  urban  areas  over  the  medium  term.  Local  taxes  on  agricultural  land  and \nproduction have been effectively ruled out for the foreseeable future.    \n \n5. \nCommune Council Performance. The most comprehensive independent study to date \nis  that  commissioned  by  the  Asia  Foundation7 over  April  to  June  2004.  This  study  canvassed \nperceptions of 1,416 voter-age citizens and 708 councilors across the country. The study found \nthat  citizens  are  generally  satisfied  with  the  performance  of  their  councils,  and  that  commune \nperformance  had  improved  after  the  introduction  of  elected  councils.8 Overall,  the  study  was \npositive about the growing role, mandate, and competence of councils, and the local democratic \nprocess and functioning.   \n \n6. \nGovernment\u2019s  Management  and  Commitment.  From  2001,  support  to  this  process \nwas  managed  by  the  National  Committee  for  Support  to  Communes-Sangkats  (NCSC), \nestablished  by  Royal  Decree.  NCSC  was  chaired  by  MoI,  and  the  NCSC  secretariat  was  the \nMoI\u2019s  Department  of  Local  Administration.  Government  commitment  to  D&D  has  continued  to \n\n                                                 \n4   In  practice,  the  small  average  size  of  communes  means  that  councils  are  relatively  close  to  the  people  and \ncouncilors  have  come  to  play  a  major  role  in  local  dispute  resolution  (notably  over  land  and  the  local \nimplementation of the 2001 Land Law, and over intra- and interfamily difficulties). Councils\u2019 role in maintaining local \nharmony  has  become  increasingly  significant,  tending  to  replace  the  traditional  role  of  the  village  chief.  All \ncommunes  have  been  involved  in  planning,  allocating,  and  implementing  local  infrastructure  and  other  rural \ndevelopment  investments  financed  from  the  development  portion  of  the  Commune  Fund.  Councils  have  formal \ndelegated  responsibility  for  two  important  whole-population  services:  civil  registration  (of  births,  deaths,  and \nmarriages) and maintenance of the electoral roll. \n\n5   The  clerks  were  recruited  by  MoI  in  2001  in  an  impressive  process  designed  to  ensure  that  only  younger,  well-\n\neducated staff were engaged. Councils\u2019 have minor fee-based income. \n\n6   The  government  procedures  and  provincial  and  district  support  arrangements  for  planning,  procurement,  and \nfinancial management of the  development part of the Commune Fund  were developed under the Seila  Program, \nbased  in  the  Council  for  the  Development  of  Cambodia  (responsible  for  donor  resource  mobilization  and \ncoordination). Seila has been very important to the success of subnational reform by attracting donor resources to \nsupplement  the  Commune  Fund;  attracting  similar  funds  for  use  by  provincial  and  district  authorities;  and \nmaintaining provincial and district delivery capacity. \n\n7   Ninh,  Kim  and  Roger  Henke.  2005.  Commune  Councils  in  Cambodia:  A  National  Survey  on  their  Functions  and \n\nPerformance. Phnom Penh: The Asia Foundation. May.  \n\n8   Citizens are aware of commune council functions. Local development projects appear to be free from elite capture \nand  are  seen  to  benefit  the  majority  rather  than  the  few,  although  there  are  concerns  over  the  transparency  of \ncouncil  planning  and  budgeting  committees.  Roads  and  schools  are  the  most  commonly  desired  local \ndevelopments.  There  is  concern  that  councils  are  not  sufficiently  active  or  empowered  to  manage  natural \nresources. The public does not see their councils as adversely affected by partisan politics, but more than one third \nof  councilors  do.  The  study  found  that  dispute  mediation  is  the  main  councilor  activity,  other  than  administrative \ntasks. Local conflicts involving youth gangs, land, and domestic conflict are common, and commune councilors are \nnow  as  likely  to  be  involved  in  dispute  resolution  as  village  chiefs.  Three  quarters  of  the  public  and  95%  of \ncouncilors say that locally mediated dispute resolutions are respected, although problems of corruption, nepotism, \npartiality, and lack of knowledge and resources among councilors are seen as continuing problems. \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nin \n\nfor \n\nfor \n\nthe  Council \n\nthe  National  Committee \n\nthe  Development  of  Cambodia  (CDC)  and \n\nDonor  Support  Arrangements.  The  pattern  of  donor  support \n\nstrengthen  since  2001  and  features  prominently  in  published  plans  and  priorities.9 In  August \n2006,  a  Royal  Decree  establishing \nthe  Management  of \nDecentralization  and  Deconcentration  Reform  (NCDD)  was  issued.  NCDD  takes  over  and \ncontinues  the  work  of  the  NCSC,  formerly  also  responsible  for  decentralization;  of  the  Inter-\nMinisterial  Committee  created  in  2004  to  oversee  the  development  of  wider  D&D  reforms \nconcerning  provinces  and  districts;  and  of  the  Seila  Task  Force  interministerial  committee, \nresponsible for the Seila Program.  \n \nfor  subnational \n7. \nadministration in Cambodia has had a contentious history and has caused significant difficulties \nboth  for  the  Government  and  for  the  concerned  donors.  The  core  problem  has  been  one  of \ncompeting  power  centers  within  government,  each  resourced  and  incentivized  by  different \ndonors. In essence, since 1980, MoI has had clear responsibility for the subnational structure of \ngovernment.  In  parallel,  however,  the  successor  to  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme\u2019s  (UNDP\u2019s)  CARERE  rehabilitation  program,  the  interministerial  Seila  task  force \nchaired  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  and  its  Seila  Program\u2014including  the \nits \nsecretariat  based \nimplementation  network  in  all  provinces\u2014has  developed  high  capacity  and  innovative  drive  in \nrelation to subnational affairs, in large part from the major donor resources it has been able to \nattract. Key political decisions over 2005\u20132006 led to the reassertion of MoI\u2019s responsibility for \nsubnational  affairs;  the  June  2005  Strategic  Framework  for  reform;  and  the  drafting  of  the \nOrganic  Law  and  the  August  2006  Royal  Decree,  which,  among  other  elements,  confirms  the \nabolition  and  merging  of  the  Seila  Program.  The  resolution  of  the  historic  tensions  in  donor \nsupport  to  subnational  administration  is  now  clearly  in  view.  The  approach  set  out  in  the \nstrategic  framework  was  presented  to  donors  at  the  Eighth  Consultative  Group  meeting  in \nMarch 2006. An independent study of donor support to subnational administration, begun in late \n2005, was submitted to the Government in April 2006. The Government responded at the end of \nMay, specifying that donors would be required to approve a \u201cgovernment-donor agreement on \nsupport  for  D&D,\u201d  but  could  channel  support  flexibly  through:  the  central  implementation \nauthority (after the approval of the Organic Law), the line ministries, basket funding, or specific \nproject  arrangements.  In  September  2006,  the  indications  were  that  the  Seila  Program  would \nformally  end  in  2006,  but  that  the  key  functions  it  provides\u2014notably  in  planning  and \nmanagement  of  commune,  district, and  provincial  funds\u2014would  continue,  but  reporting  to  MoI \nand the NCDD.  \n \nADB Support. ADB and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GTZ) \n8. \n(and part of UNDP) are the only agencies providing support through MoI rather than through Seila and \nCDC. The Commune Council Development Project and the Commune Council Development Project 2 \nare both clearly focused on supporting the commune councils. The correct Executing Agency for that \npurpose  was,  and  remains,  MoI.  The  outcome  of  the  developments  since  mid-2005  is  that  donors \nwishing to continue to support subnational administration will also be required do so through MoI and \nNCDD, and that donor harmonization will be achieved around the legally mandated government entity. \n\n                                                 \n9   Notably  in  the  governance  action  plan;  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy;  the  July  2004  Rectangular \nStrategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency; and the National Strategic Development Plan for 2006\u2013\n2010. The recent changes following the publication of the June 2005 Strategic Framework for Decentralization and \nDeconcentration  Reforms  (Strategic  Framework)  leave  no  doubt  about  government  leadership  in  reforming  the \nsubnational  structure  of  governance.  The  Strategic  Framework  set  out  a  four-phase  implementation  plan  for \ndemocratic subnational reform: a preparatory phase leading to the adoption of the new local government legislation \n(the Organic Law), followed by initial, transition, and transformation phases for implementing the new law over the \nfollowing decade. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n Appendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nREVIEW OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMMUNE COUNCIL DEVELOPMENT \nPROJECT (MARCH 2006) AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PHASE II \n\nThe Commune Council Development Project \n\n \n1. \nThis  appendix  provides  a  short  summary  of  the  review  of  the  performance  of  the \nCommune Council Development Project (CCDP) through 31 March   2006, and enumerates the \nimplications  for  the  design  of  a  second-phase  project.  The  review  was  made  by  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance design team in April 2006 and is presented in Supplementary \nAppendix  C.  CCDP  has  not  been  formally  reviewed  since  the  midterm  review  (MTR)  in \nNovember 2004. The results of the MTR, and of the two Asian Development Bank (ADB) review \nmissions in June and November 2005, were also considered during this review.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nFollowing  identification  in  late  2001  and  preparation  during  2002,  the  ADB  Board \napproved financing for the Government\u2019s CCDP on 3 December 2002. The Project supports the \ndevelopment  of  democratic  local  government  in  Cambodia.  The  Project  is  executed  by  the \nMinistry of Interior (MoI) through its Department of Local Administration (DoLA). It is externally \nfinanced  by  ADB  ($10  million  loan),  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation \nAgency  ($3  million  grant 1 ),  and  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  ($2.4  million).  The \nGovernment  contribution  is  $2  million  in  kind.  The  Project  has  four  components:  commune \nfacilities;  capacity  building;  photo  mapping,  and  civil  registration  (CR).  The  loan  took  effect  on \n13 March 2003. The estimated completion date is now December 2006. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe purpose of this component was to consolidate the introduction of local democracy in \nCambodia by providing distinctive, cost-effective \u201ccommune-parliament\u201d buildings to larger and \npoorer rural communes with poor council premises or none. In line with the perceived need for a \nsingle nationally recognizable style for local government premises, the component\u2019s contracted \narchitects developed a model office design that was distinctively Khmer, with a covered area for \nlarge meetings and four small offices for councilors, small meetings, and safekeeping of council \ndocuments and equipment. The buildings were designed to be a culturally meaningful symbol of \nlocal democracy, and to engender civic pride and support for the councils and the democratic \nprocess on which they are founded (Report and Recommendation of the President [RRP], para. \n71).  Commune  councils  were  required  to  select  a  plot  of  land  for  the  new  facility,  which  was \ncentrally located in the commune, and which was not currently occupied, legally or illegally. The \nsite selection and absence of any occupancy was checked by the project engineers during their \ninitial visit. No problems in relation to the non-occupancy requirement were found in any of the \n519 communes included in this component. The component is implemented by one DoLA staff \nmember,  four  contracted  national  architects  and  engineers,  and  one  part-time  international \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  consultant.  Commune  eligibility  was  determined  through  a  needs \nassessment  and  prioritization  formula  including  terms  for  commune  population,  poverty  rating, \nand  the  existence  of  a  commune  office  and  its  condition.2 The  component  uses  an  innovative \n\nComponent 1-1: Commune Facilities \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  grant  was  increased  to  $3.57  million  following  the \n\nMTR in November 2004. \n\n2   The  four  municipalities  are  excluded  from  C1-1:  the  eligible  councils  are  those  in  the  20  rural  provinces  (RRP \npara. 16). Commune councils select from three model designs (for dry land, on pillars for flood-prone areas, or a \nwooden  model  for  mountainous  provinces).  Councils  are  free  to  make  further  minor  modifications  around  the \nstandard model chosen. Commune councils are responsible for selecting their own supervising technician, for local \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n(for Cambodia and ADB) block-grant transfer mechanism. The use of model designs with known \nquantities of materials and labor enables transfers of the actual local-price cost of the building \nselected  (plus  7%  contractor  overhead)  to  the  commune  account,  held  with  the  provincial \ntreasury (and now with ACLEDA Bank). Payments are withdrawn by the contractor in stages (up \nto 11), according to progress achieved. The average construction time is 6 months. In total, the \nProject is financing the construction of new council offices in 519 communes.  \n \n4. \nrelevance to Phase II: \n \n\nAssessment and Implications for Phase II. Several insights of this review are of direct \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nCommune-level interviews from the field survey and other visits indicate that the \nbuildings  are  making  a  significant  contribution  both  to  consolidating  the  status \nand  reputation  of  elected  councils,  and  to  creating  a  more  appropriate  working \nenvironment. Ninety-five percent of councils (54 out of 57) interviewed in the field \nsurvey  said  the  office  accommodation  is  appropriate  to  their  needs.3 Eighty-two \npercent of offices (47 out of 57) are used every day, and all at least twice a week. \nEven  skeptics  of  this  subcomponent  during  the  2002  design  phase  now  agree \nthat \u201cplace\u201d matters in consolidating a new institution, and appreciate the value-\nfor-money of this component.   \nThere is strong support for this component from the Ministry of Interior (MoI) and \nfrom the highest level of government. \nFurther  evidence  of  the relevance  and  appropriateness  of  the  distinctive  Khmer \ndesign comes from the growing imitation of the design for new sangkat buildings \nby Phnom Penh Municipality, and by the Cambodia People\u2019s Party in at least two \nprovinces.  \nThe  construction  quality  is  consistently  high,  as  a  result  of  high  council \nownership, rigorous independent inspections, and popular awareness that poor-\nquality  work  has  to  be  replaced  before  certification.  The  field  survey  assessed \nthat for the 57 councils with offices, none of the works was of poor quality. Just \nover half (30 out of 57) were assessed as excellent, scoring over 75%, and the \nbalance  were  assessed  as  (scoring  between  50%  and  75%)  but  with  some \nweaknesses,  usually  in  finishing  or  painting.  In  terms  of  sustainability,  the  field \nsurvey found that 70% of councils with new offices (40 out of 57) have included a \nmaintenance item in the council budget. \nThe methodology adopted has generated high ownership by the council, evident \nin  council  views,  the  building  quality  achieved,  and  the  additional  features \n(commonly  latrines,  boundary  walls,  tiles,  murals,  plants)  added  with  local \nresources,  by  the  majority  of  councils.  This  ownership  is  of  course  the  pivotal \nfactor determining the future operation and maintenance of the building.  \nThe rate of implementation has been high, because of the innovative block-grant \ntransfer methodology. The main constraint has been the 10% imprest limit in the \nLoan Agreement.4 \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \ntendering, and for all stages of construction, guided by the comprehensive Implementation Handbook developed by \nthe CCDP component 1 team. \n\n3  Some councils are concerned that the open-plan concept in the model design makes use of the large room difficult \nin  stormy  weather.  This  issue  was  discussed  at  length,  by  the  National  Committee  for  Support  to  Commune-\nSangkat Councils (NCSC) among others, during the preparation of the model designs. The consensus was that the \n\u201ctransparent operation\u201d design concept should override the bad-weather benefits of a closed structure. \n\n4  ADB  procedures  are  flexible  with  respect  to  the  allowable  imprest  advance  (ADB.  2001.  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook. Manila, page 38,  para. 10.10). There is a strong case for a higher advance for phase II,  which  would \nfurther speed up the rate of implementation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n Appendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n(vii) \n\nThe economy of the buildings is high, as a result of determining each commune\u2019s \nblock grant by pricing actual quantities at local prices.  \n\n(viii)  The  reports  on  the  project  audits  (by  KPMG)  in  2003  and  2004  expressed \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\ncomplete satisfaction with the methodology adopted.5   \nThe  efficiency  of  the  subcomponent  is  high,  with  just  four  full-time  contracted \narchitects supervising works across the whole country. \nThe  principal  agent,  contractual,  nature  of  the  subcomponent  is  appropriate  for \nrelations  between  different  tiers  of  elected  government.  It  has  also  had  clear \nbenefits in construction quality.     \nThe  subcomponent  has  maintained  an  excellent  management  information \nsystem (MIS), enabling the rapid generation of activity and financial performance \ndata. \n\nComponent 1-2: Communications and Component 4 Procurement \n\n \nC. \n \n5. \nBy March 2006, 15 provinces had been covered under this component, with installation \nwork ongoing in Pursat, Kratie, Mondolkiri, Preah Vihear, and Prey Veng. Most of the equipment \nhad  been  procured  and  distributed,  and  installation  of  the  province-district-commune  radio \nnetwork was ongoing. Repeaters are being installed in four provinces to enable communes to \nconnect directly to the province. A combined total of $42,233 (under the commune and district \nradio  contracts)  had  yet  to  be  disbursed,  pending  the  satisfactory  completion  of  the  network. \nOverall, the contractor\u2019s performance was adequate.  \n \nThe  results  of  the  field  survey  showed  that  all  the  communes  that  were  scheduled  to \n6. \nreceive a radio (51 out of 51) had received one. Of the 51 radios, 30 were base-station radios \nand  21  were  mobile  handset  radios.  Eighty-four  percent  (43  out  of  51)  are  in  good  working \norder.  Sixty-eight  percent  (35  out  of  51)  of  the  councils  that  received  radios  can  now \ncommunicate readily with the province, and 82% (42 out of 51) with the district. Some radios are \nnot  operating  because  of  ongoing  work  on  the  system,  the  short-battery  life  of  some  mobile \nradios, or some lightning damage. Of the councils with working radio communications, 69% (29 \nout of 42) say they use it every day, and 93% (39 out of 42) at least twice per week. \n \n7. \nAll  43  of  the  communes  visited  that  were  scheduled  to  receive  a  motorcycle  had \nreceived one. All except one motorcycle are in good working order. In 70% (30 out of 43) of the \nvisited  councils  that  received  motorcycles,  the  bike  is variously  used  by  the  chief,  other \ncouncilors, and the clerk. In 28% (12 out of 43), the bike is used only by the chief. The councils \nthat  did  not  receive  a  motorcycle  are  anxious  to  have  one.  All  communes  visited  (106  out  of \n106)  had  received  a  typewriter.  In  85%  of  these  communes  (90  out  of  106),  the  typewriter  is \nused by the clerk or the councilors (or all of them). The typewriter is used at least twice a week \nin  71%  of  the  communes  (75  out  of  106),  and  every  day  in  just  under  half  of  the  communes \n(51106). However, maintenance and spare-part problems were reported by almost two fifths of \nthe councils (41 out of 106). In communes close to conurbations, councils commonly prefer to \nuse local computer shops rather than their typewriters.       \n\n \n\n8. \nAssessment  and  Implications  for  Phase  II.  The  relevance,  effectiveness,  efficiency, \nand  benefits  of  the  equipment  provided  are  good  overall.  Overall,  the  equipment  procurement \nprogram has undoubtedly enhanced local government functioning. There is clearly no need to \n\n                                                 \n5  Both  the  2003  and  2004  audit  reports  and  management  letters  raise  no  matters  of  significant  concern  on  any \n\nCCDP procedure or component. \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nrepeat much of the phase I equipment procurement (radios, cupboards, typewriters, provincial \nlocal administration unit [PLAU] furniture) in phase II. Only 21% of communes (325 out of 1,510, \nexcluding  sangkats)  were  supplied  with  motorcycles  and  the  prime  equipment  demand  for \nphase  II  is  for  more  council  motorcycles.  The  evidence  from  the  field  survey  is  that,  if  funds \nallow it, a second batch of motorcycles would be well used by the recipient councils. \n \nD. \n\nComponent 1-3: Provincial Facilities \n\nThe  Project  aimed  to  refurbish  PLAU  offices  in  five  provinces.  This  subcomponent  is \n9. \ncompleted  and  all  facilities  have  been  handed  over.  The  renovations  are  appreciated  by  the \nstaff  and  the  provincial  authorities  concerned.  All  PLAUs  now  have  broadly  adequate \naccommodation. \n \nE. \n\nComponent 2-1: Training Fund \n\n \n\n \n\n10. \nThe project budget allocated $990,000 to a training fund to finance National Committee \nfor Support to Commune-Sangkat Councils (NCSC) training programs for councilors, clerks, and \nlocal  and  national  officials.6 DoLA  staff  have  been  trained  in  information  technology  skills  and \nthe English language. A total of 22 DoLA staff received funding support for the completion of the \npart-time  master  in  business  administration  (MBA)  course  of  the  National  University  of \nManagement, and were set to graduate in 2006. Two education and development workshops on \ncapacity building and human resource management were organized for DoLA staff in 2006. In-\nhouse management courses will continue monthly to the end of the year. The component plans \nto  continue  to  support  national  training  for  commune  councilors  and  clerks,  district  and \nprovincial staff, governors, deputy governors, and DoLA staff over the rest of 2006. An impact \nstudy  of  national  training  for  councilors  and  clerks,  mainly  concerning  commune  development \nfund implementation, was published in September 2004.7 The study found that cascade training \n(using provincial and district master trainers) is effective and probably more cost-effective than \nthe use of NGOs; there has been no formal evaluation of the effect of training provided; clerks \nand  council  chiefs  have  received  more  training  than  councilors;  despite  training,  all  councils \nstudied  continue  to  require  external  assistance  in  commune  fund  implementation  tasks; \nunderstanding  of  training  materials  is  generally  low;  and  demand  for  refresher  courses \ncontinues. \n \n11. \nThe study thus tends to confirm other field findings that the implementation process for \nthe  commune  fund  remains  difficult  for  councilors  to  absorb  and  implement  without  continuing \nprovince and district staff support. The election of new councilors after the 2007 local elections \nwill  increase  training  demand.  More  seriously,  with  commune  development  fund  investment \ncurrently averaging about $8,000 a year for each commune, the outcome of this training supply \nessentially  enables  each  commune  to  select  and  implement  a  single  small  development \n                                                 \n6 As of the end of March 2006, expenditure from the training fund was $488,000 (49%). For the rest of 2006, support \nis planned for courses in conflict resolution, domestic violence, health, child rights, and facilitation skills. These are \nbudgeted at $227,000. If all the courses are completed, expenditure from the training fund would amlount to 72% \nby  project  closure.  By  March  2006,  the  training  fund  had  financed  10  national  training  programs,  mainly  on \nplanning  and  implementation  of  Commune  Fund  procedures,  for  different  groups  of  commune  councilors  and \nclerks. In 2006, the emphasis of commune-level training  has been shifting toward training in governance, health, \ndomestic  violence,  child  rights,  and  child  protection.  Three  courses  have  been  financed  for  PLAU  and  other \nprovincial staff in facilitation skills and PLAU structure and function. \n\n7   Turner,  Mark.  2004.  Study  to  Assess  Effectiveness  of  the  NCSC  National  Training  Program.  Phnom  Penh.  Final \nreport.    University  of  Canberra,  for  DFID-Sida  Permanent  Advisory  Team,  SPM  Consultants,  Oxford  Policy \nManagement.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n Appendix 2 \n\n29 \n\ninvestment  each  year.8 Hence,  despite  the  apparent  benefit  of  a  cascade  training  system,  the \nmore  fundamental  concern  is  the  effect  and  cost-effectiveness  of  training  courses  devoted  to \nenabling  communes  to  select  a  single  small  investment  item  each  year,  which,  the  evidence \nsuggests,  is  not  readily  internalized  and  requires  continuing  refresher  training,  and  ongoing \nsupport from province and district staff. The effect of governance and domestic violence training \nfor councilors, or of training for PLAU staff, has not been evaluated to date. The computer and \nlanguage  training  for  DoLA  is  appreciated  and  is  evident  in  the  growing  competence  of  DoLA \n(see Project Management below). The part-time MBA program, completed by 22 DoLA staff in \n2006,  is  highly  appreciated  and  has  contributed  to  the  department\u2019s  growing  overall \ncompetence.9   \n \n12. \nAssessment and Implications for Phase II. The absorption rate of this subcomponent \nhas been relatively low to date. It currently appears that less than three quarters of the training \nfund may be disbursed at project closure. Further, it is not easy to ascertain exactly how many \npeople  have  been  trained,  or  in  what  topics.  The  subcomponent  has  lacked  an  effective  MIS \nthroughout.  Only  one  evaluation  (not  financed  by  the  Project)  of  some  training  activities  is \navailable  to  date.  The  training  of  DoLA  staff  is  appreciated  and  has  been  beneficial.  The \ndevelopment of indigenous materials by the local consultant hired in 2005 is expected to be of \nbenefit in increasing the effect of future training. The capacity development concept adopted by \nsubcomponent  1-1  for  the  implementation  of  a  relatively  complex  management  and  financial \ntask  (through  the  provision  of  a  detailed  and  visual  manual;  two  1-day,  no-cost  provincial \nseminars;  and  occasional  supervisory  and  mentoring  visits)  has  not  been  assessed  for  its \napplicability  to  other  commune  functions.  Similarly,  the  effective  capacity  building\u2014with  low-\noverhead training and supervision costs\u2014developed under component 4,10 does not appear to \nhave affected the DoLA or the approach of component 2 to capacity building and training.  \n \n13. \nIf  training  resources  are  available  for  phase  II,  the  absorption  rate  suggests  that  a \nsmaller  quantum  than  in  CCDP  would  be  warranted.  The  available  evidence  is  that  until \ngovernment  moves  to  reform  and  simplify  the  current  methodology  for  planning  and \nimplementing the commune development fund, further expenditure on training in this area would \nbe  of  limited  benefit  and  cost-effectiveness.  Training  for  councilors  old  and  new  on  roles  and \nresponsibilities,  representation,  advocacy,  dispute  settlement,  and  rights  issues,  as  under  the \n2006 DoLA may be more useful. Commune clerks have received more training than councilors \nto date. However, they are young (mostly 25 and 26), educated at least to grade 12 (footnote \n11),  and  are  thus  more  educable  than  the  average  councilor.  Further  training  for  DoLA  and \nPLAU staff would therefore be warranted. \n \nF. \n \nThe  project  budget  included  $800,000  for  financing  public  awareness  activities.  By  the \n14. \nend of March 2006, $563,000 (70% of the budget) had been committed through contracts with \n\nComponent 2-2: Public Awareness \n\n                                                 \n8   If the commune development fund were sufficient to enable a choice of, say, half a dozen small investments a year \nfor  each  commune,  this  would  require  a  total  annual  investment  of  about  $78  million  (6  x  $8,000  x  1,621).  This \nwould be about the same annual size as the financed elements of the Government\u2019s Public Investment Program \n2006\u20132008 for the entire rural development and agriculture sectors combined.   \n\n9   Anecdotal reports are that DoLA is now one of the best-educated and -trained departments in government. \n10  By early 2006, communes were assessing their own registration performance in districts, and districts in provinces, \nsupported by monthly visits from just two Plan International/United Nations Volunteers, covering the whole country. \nAuthentic capacity to collect registration data and review why the progress of a particular commune  was good or \npoor in a given month has been widely achieved across the country. \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nthree  national  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs). 11 Fifty-nine  percent  of  the  budget  had \nbeen  disbursed,  with  activities  continuing.  In  2004/2005,  the  first  round  of  drama  education \nfinanced  community  theater  performances  in  504  communes,  film  performances  in  240,  and \nloudspeaker  announcements  in  240.  One  million  leaflets  and  25,000  T-shirts  were  distributed. \nThe  contractor,  NICFEC,  estimates  that  more  than  2  million  people  were  reached.    NICFEC \ninterviewed  3,000  people  after  the  drama  performances  and  found  that  about  56%  had \nunderstood  the  key  messages.  This  is  an  encouraging  finding  in  that  it  reflects  increased \nunderstanding  by  the  general  public,  including  the  poor  and  less  literate.  A  second  phase  of \ndrama shows, covering 260 communes, ran from March to  the end of July 2006. This second \nphase comprised 180 drama shows and 80 films, publicized through radio and television. During \n2004, six TV spots were produced, which were broadcast on seven channels over 5 months in \n2005 (television currently reaches about 70% of the population). New TV spots were broadcast \nbetween June and October 2006.12 The drama, TV, and radio campaigns were all prepared and \nmanaged  by  experienced  national  NGOs.  All  scripts  and  content  were  discussed  and  cleared \nbeforehand with DoLA and the NCSC capacity-building subcommittee. DoLA has produced five \neditions of a decentralization newsletter for distribution to commune councils to date. The mass \nmedia  campaign  has  included  extensive  mention  of  the  importance  of  CR,  in  support  of  the \nregistration campaign financed under component 4 of the Project.  \n \nAssessment  and  Implications  for  Phase  II.  The  volume  and  diversity  of  public \n15. \nawareness  activities,  and  the  achieved  population  coverage,  have  been  high.  Verbal  material \nand the use of community drama\u2014which increases scope for post-performance discussion and \ndebate\u2014have been appropriate for Cambodia. The drama education campaign for 2004\u20132006 \nis  the  largest  ever  implemented  in  the  country,  and  the  approach  is  being  adopted  by  other \ndecentralization-support  projects.  National  NGOs  and  media  channels  are  relatively  low-cost \nproviders,  and  high  coverage  is  economic  to  achieve.  No  independent  impact  evaluation  has \nbeen conducted, but the available evidence is that the campaign has been highly beneficial in \nincreasing  awareness  of  the  existence  and  role  of  elected  local  government.  The  field  survey \nfound  that  55%  of  councils  visited  (58  out  of  106)  had  seen  the  drama  shows.  Almost  all  had \nseen TV spots (100 out of 106) and heard radio coverage (102 out of 106). Importantly, all the \n106  councils  interviewed  in  the  field  survey  said  that  they  found  the  mass  media  coverage \ninteresting and useful. This is an encouraging finding about the potential of mass media to reach \nand inform councilors about their roles.   \n \n16. \nThe messages in the drama, TV, and radio spots are broadly the same, but experienced \nindependent observers have commented that the key decentralization messages do not always \nstand  out  in  the  six  TV  spots  or  the  drama  scripts  they  reviewed.  The  difference  between  the \nrole and legitimacy of elected councilors and NGOs tends to be blurred; the role of councilors as \nrepresentatives  of  the  public,  rather  than  of  government  is  not  distinct,  although  the  role  of \nfemale councilors comes over strongly; the potential for council advocacy over failures in public \n\n                                                 \n11  The  three  contractors  are  Neutral  and  Impartial  Committee  for  Free  and  Fair  Elections  in  Cambodia  (NICFEC), \nmainly for commune dramas, $490,151; Action IEC (Information Education Communication), mainly for TV spots, \n$52350; Women\u2019s Media Centre, mainly for radio spots, $20,073. \n\n12 A  three-part  film,  lasting  1  hour  in  total,  has  been  produced  for  broadcast  on  three  TV  channels  later  in  2006.  A \nquestion-and-answer  call-in  radio  program  was  held  monthly  through  2005.  DoLA  staff  were  present  to  answer \nphoned-in  questions.  In  January\u2013June  2006,  the format  was  adapted  to include  call-in  question-and-answer  time \nand  interviews  with  different  participants  in  the  decentralization  process,  with  staff  from  DoLA,  PLAUs,  and \ncouncilors involved. Phone calls from commune councilors seeking clarification on their role and work are common. \nFour information spots on decentralization were broadcast on three radio channels in 2005. In January\u2013May 2006, \nthe intensity was increased to five spots on four channels. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n Appendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nthe \n\nComponent 2-3: Technical Assistance \n\nservice  supply  and  quality  is  not  developed;  some  TV  images  tend  to  give  the  impression  of \ncouncilors as \u201cthe new bosses\u201d rather than \u201cservants of the people\u201d; the new council premises \nthat  were  financed  under  component  1-1,  and  that  act  as  a  visible  symbol  of  the  permanency \nand status of elected local government, have yet to appear in the TV spots.13 This apparent lack \nof  clarity  in  some  of  the  message  tends  to  be  confirmed  by  the  NICFEC  post-performance \nsurvey finding that only just over half of the audience had internalized clear messages from the \ndrama shows. The promulgation of mixed messages is not surprising.  DoLA has yet to develop \na  strong  narrative  (\u201csix  core  messages\u201d)  on  the  key  roles  of  councilors,  and  the  contracted \nNGOs are relatively new to this field. For a phase II, it is desirable to develop and agree on a \nsmall  core  of  clear  messages  and  to  ensure  that  these  are  promulgated  and  repeated \nthroughout the campaign using different media. \n \nG. \n \n17. \nThis  component  initially  included  30  person-months  of  TA  to  analyze  capacity-building \nneeds;  ensure  the  effective  planning  and  use  of  the  training  fund;  help  manage  the  public \nawareness fund; strengthen NCSC liaison with major service ministries; and help MoI develop a \ndecentralization  policy, \nlegal  system  and  procedures,  and  gender  analysis  and \nstrengthening. The volume of TA was increased following the MTR in November 2004, and the \nextension  of  the  Project  to  the  end  of  2006. 14  In  2005,  commune  administration  training \nmaterials were reviewed for legal accuracy and draft guidance materials on the Land Law 2001 \nwere  prepared.  A  draft  for  the  new  Commune  Boundary  Prakas  was  prepared  in  conjunction \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Land  Management,  Urban  Planning,  and  Construction  (MoLMUPC)  (see \ncomponent 3 below). \n \n18. \nAssessment  and  Implications  for  Phase  II. The effect of the Project\u2019s TA support on \nthe  decentralization  policy  process  has  been  modest  overall,  other  than  the  important  support \nfor  training  and  public  awareness  campaigns,  and  assistance  with  drafting  the  commune \nboundary demarcation prakas. Competent and professional outputs have been produced, but it \nis  hard  to  discern  their  effect  on  policy  or  procedural  development.  The  evidence  is  that  the \nlong-term and trusted TA provided by CCDP\u2019s sister projects financed by Deutsche Gesellschaft \nthe  United  Nations  Development \nf\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  GmbH  (GTZ)  and \nProgramme has been the more valued and influential source of TA to DoLA. For phase II, the \nprovision  of  decentralization  and  legal  TA  will  need  careful  assessment  in  the  light  of  future \nsupport provided through other agencies. \n \nH. \n \n19. \nThe project budget included $1.1 million for photo mapping, implemented by MoLMUPC. \nThis was part of a joint initiative with the World Bank and the GTZ-financed Land Management \nAdministration  Project  (LMAP)  and  the  Japanese  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  to \nproduce up-to-date digitized ortho maps for the whole country. Digitized ortho maps are a key \n\nComponent 3: Photo Mapping \n\n                                                 \n13  One of the new TV spots broadcast in June 2006 featured the new council offices. \n14 In addition to supporting the implementation of the training fund and public awareness campaign, eight papers on \ndecentralization in Cambodia have been produced. The outputs in 2004 under the legal TA have been: a review of \ndecentralization legislation and an analysis of gaps in the law; preparation of prakas on council staff hiring, village \nchiefs, and the Commune Fund Board; reviews of the role of NCSC and DoLA; agency function delegation; the role \nof  councils  in  the  Social  Land  Concession  Sub-Decree;  and  a  draft  curriculum  on  the  council  role  in  land \nmanagement issues and dispute resolution. A joint prakas was drafted on procedures to improve the accuracy of \ncommune boundary maps. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nelement  of  the  national  infrastructure  and  sharply  increase  the  ease  and  efficiency  of  land \nallocation, land-use planning, and boundary demarcation. The division of the country among the \nthree  financiers  is  shown  in  the  figure  below.  At  the  end  of  March  2006,  the  only  expenditure \nwas $366,000 from the initial $528,000 contract for the overflying and mapmaking of about one \nthird of the country, including the Ton Le Sap Sihanoukville and northwest areas, as shown on \nthe map. The flying was largely completed in 2004. Aerial photography (at a 1:40,000 scale) of \n55,000  square  meters  (about  500  communes),  followed  by  development,  contact  printing, \ncreating 55 global positioning system ground-control points (for map correction), and scanning \nare entirely completed.    \n \n20. \nThe  creation  of  digital  mosaics  and  the  ortho  photos  is  80%  completed.  Some  blocks \nhad  to  be  reflown  because  of  cloudy  conditions  and  unclear  photographs.  These  flights  were \ncomplete  by  the  end  of  February  2006.  The  MoLMUPC  quality  control  team  has  made  three \nmonitoring  trips  to  Bangkok  to  assess  progress  by  the  contractor,  as  well  as  ongoing  quality \ncontrol  work  based  in  MoLMUPC.  The  ortho  maps  now  available  are  already  being  used  for \nland  registration  by  LMAP.  The  hard-copy  commune  copies  will  be  printed  and  distributed  as \npart of the forthcoming commune boundary demarcation exercise. There is now good progress \non committing the balance of the funds. First, tender evaluation of bids to prepare ortho photos \nfrom the area photographed through JICA financing in 2002 is under way. This task is expected \nto  take  4  to  5  months  to  complete,  after  contract  letting.  Second,  a  $265,000  program  to \ndemarcate  province,  district,  and  commune  boundaries15 was  approved  in  early  2006.  A  draft \nMoI and MoLMUPC prakas on the procedure has been prepared and the Project\u2019s MoLMUPC \nco-coordinator has developed a sound plan to map about 1,000 communes, using the available \northo  photos,  with  procedures  to  cope  with  the  multiple  scenarios  of  disputed  commune \nboundaries,  many  of  which  also  cross  district  and  provincial  boundaries.  A  team  of  two \nMoLMUPC staff members from each province will be responsible for working with communes to \nagree  on  boundaries.  A  committee  structure  at  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels  is  being \ncreated  to  arbitrate  boundary  disputes  that  cannot  be  solved  directly  by  the  communes \nconcerned, and that affect higher-tier administrative boundaries.       \n \n21. \nAssessment  and  Implications  for  Phase  II.  The  ortho  maps  produced  under  this \ncomponent  are  already  in  use.  They  simplify  and  expedite  the  vital  processes  of  land \nregistration,  allocation  of  social  and  economic  concessions,  land-use  planning,  and  boundary \ndemarcation.  Because  they  are  photos,  rather  than  maps,  ortho  photos  are  relatively  easy  for \nuntrained councilors and citizens to understand and use.  The initial contract to photograph and \ndigitize the ADB part of the country was well executed, and obtained well below estimate. The \nNovember  2004  MTR  recommended  rapid  action  to  commit  the  remaining  budget.  This  has \nproceeded rather slowly, and contracts are only being drawn up, 12 to 15 months later, for the \ntwo important activities selected for financing from the balance. This delay is in part because of \nthe time required to establish the demarcation committee structure in provinces and districts, the \nlimited  staff  time  available,  internal  changes  within  MoLMUPC  for  the  implementation  of  the \ncomponent, and the low volume of TA committed to the design. Despite the delays, however, it \nis encouraging that boundary demarcation continues to be an authentic nationally led initiative. \nThe importance of boundary demarcation is undisputed, and if funds are available for phase II, \n\n                                                 \n15  Cambodia  currently  has  no  formalized  administrative  boundaries,  even  for  provinces  and  districts.  Commune \nboundaries  exist  only  as  penciled  sketch  maps,  hurriedly  collected  in  2001,  before  the  first  council  elections.  \nFormalizing boundaries and jurisdictions is an essential part of state building and underpins basic functions such \nas addressing, registering, and compiling the electoral roll; planning land use, measuring the local revenue base; \nand clarifying the jurisdiction of different tiers of local administration and line-ministry service. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n Appendix 2 \n\n33 \n\nComponent 4: Civil Registration \n\nthe  priority  use  is  continued  support  for  completion  of  the  demarcation  exercise,  including \nextension  to  all  communes.  The  MoLMUPC  is  anxious  that  this  should  include  marker  posts. \nMoLMUPC is also interested in training urban and rural commune and sangkat councils in the \nuse of ortho photos for land-use planning. \n \nI. \n \n22. \nThe project was the main financier of the Government\u2019s civil registration (CR) drives over \n2003\u20132006,  in  partnership  with  Plan  International  and  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF). Commune and sangkat councils are responsible for the collection of birth, death, and \nmarriage  certificates.  In  addition  to  their  role  in  the  country\u2019s  demographic  infrastructure,  CR \nrecords  are  an  essential  component  of  human  and  gender  rights,  providing  documentary \nevidence of parentage, marriage, age, and family structure. The first task confronting the MoI\u2019s \nOffice  of  Civil  Registration  was  to  clear  the  near-universal  backlog  of  non-registration.  CCDP \nintroduced  a  \u201cmobile  team\u201d  methodology  and  performance  incentives  ($5  for  every  100  forms \ncompleted)  for  the  field  teams.  This  incentive  was  pivotal  in  achieving  remarkably  fast \nregistration  progress.  The  NGO  Plan  International,  which  has  extensive  experience  in  CR  in \nother  countries,  became  a  significant  cooperating  partner  and  provided \nimportant \nimplementation  support,  including  mobilizing  a  team  of  field-based  United  Nations  volunteers, \nlogistical support, monitoring and facilitation, and a supportive media campaign, partly financed \nfrom component 2-2. By the end of March 2006, component 4 expenditure (excluding the radio \nand equipment budget and expenditures transferred to component 1) was $1.51 million out of a \nrevised  budget  of  $2.01  million  (75%).  Birth  registration  has  risen,  from  about  2%  in  2003  to \n74% in March 2006. With about 9 million CR registrations recorded to date, this CR campaign \nhas been one of the fastest in the world.16 \n \n23. \nAssessment  and  Implications  for  Phase  II.  The  clearing  of  the  registration  backlog \nwas  highly  impressive.  The  component  was  fortunate  to  have  support  from  Plan  International \nand  UNICEF,  and  the  partnership  of  these  organizations  with  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the \nRoyal Netherlands Embassy has been a striking success. However, MoI\u2019s frequently expressed \nconcern that there are millions of hard-copy CR records sitting in 180 district offices, threatened \nby humidity, floods, and deterioration is clearly a serious matter. MoI has repeatedly requested \nsupport with digitizing and cataloging the records collected. A means to preserve and facilitate \naccess to the CR records collected to date, as part of a sustainable national system, must be a \npriority for phase II. \n \nJ. \n \n24. \nThe majority of the project components are concerned with helping provide the essential \nhard  and  soft  infrastructure  for  councils  to  function  (buildings,  typewriters,  radios,  ortho  maps, \nand  a  national  CR  system). 17 There  is  greater  opportunity  to  ensure  that  project  resources \nbenefit  women  in  component  2,  through  the  training  and  awareness  funds.  Only  8.5%  of \ncouncilors  are  female,  and  the  DoLA  training  plan,  which  is  partly  financed  through \ncomponent 2, has had a strong gender focus toward this group. The current DoLA training plan \n                                                 \n16 By June 2006, the total number of birth certificates collected had passed the 10 million milestone. \n17The  ADB  gender  assessment  questions  whether  latrines  should  have  been  included  in  the  standard  design  for \ncouncil  offices.  The  RRP  notes  that  \u201cOther  elements  have  been  considered  for  addition  to  the  model  designs \nincluding: more offices, a water pump and well, latrines, a kitchen, fencing and gates, and a surrounding garden\u201d \n(para. 14). These  were rejected because of the high opportunity cost. In the outturn, all communes visited either \nhave latrines nearby (all council offices are in the commune center) or have built them from their own resources.  \n\nGender \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nincludes  training  for  female  councilors  and  clerks  in  representation,  health,  education,  child \nrights, and child protection. The local training consultant hired by CCDP in 2005 is developing \ntraining materials for a course in the prevention and control of domestic violence. These courses \nare  designed  both  to  provide  knowledge  and  to  empower  recipients.  The  gender  emphasis  in \nDoLA\u2019s work has been strengthened as a result of several gender TA inputs, including the long-\nstanding  Partnership  for  Local  Governance\u2013Seila  gender-mainstreaming  emphasis  and  inputs \nfrom UNICEF, the long-term GTZ TA, and CCDP\u2019s own work. \n   \nA DoLA gender strategy is under development, with financial and TA support from GTZ.  \n25. \nA gender awareness course for DoLA staff was completed in 2005. The DoLA gender strategy \nand action plan is being developed in a participatory manner, by a core team made up of two \nstaff members from each of the six DoLA offices. A first draft was completed in November 2005 \nand  a  second  draft  in  March  2006.  The  component  2  international  consultant  and  the \nCambodian  Resident  Mission  gender  specialist were  involved  in  the  preliminary  discussions.18 \nFollowing the recommendation of the November 2004 MTR, terms of reference were agreed on \nfor a national gender consultant in June 2005. The position was advertised and short-listed, and \ncandidates  were  interviewed  later  in  the  month.  No  suitable  candidate  was  identified  and  the \nposition was re-advertised, but only one more application was received. It was decided that, in \nview  of  the  progress  on  the  production  of  the  DoLA  gender  strategy,  with  GTZ  support,  the \nposition would not be advertised again. In November\u2013December 2005, ADB undertook a gender \nanalysis  of  CCDP.19 The  study  recommended  that  a  gender  action  plan  be  developed  and  a \ngender specialist be employed to review the project components and the gender implications of \ncapacity building, training materials, target groups, course attendance, and the gender content \nof  public  awareness  activities.  The  report  recommended  that  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs \n(MoWA) have a formal advisory role in CCDP planning and implementation. \n \n26. \nAssessment  and  Implications  for  Phase  II.  Elected  commune  councils,  formalized \nrights to land, and a national CR system are invaluable new institutions for advancing women \nand  children\u2019s  rights  and  interests.  However,  the  majority  of  project  support  toward  these  is \nconcerned  with  providing  the  basic  necessities  for  councils  and  the  land  and  CR  systems  to \nfunction.  The  Project  has  made  two  unsuccessful  attempts  to  hire  a  gender  consultant,  as \nrecommended in both the MTR and ADB gender analysis reports. The market for such skills is \nknown to be tight in Cambodia. If funds are available for further training activities in phase II, it \nwould  be  desirable  to  make  a  further  attempt  to  hire  a  suitably  qualified  and  experienced \nnational  consultant.  In  the  interim,  it  is  notable  that  the  national  materials  development \nconsultant is developing a course to strengthen domestic violence awareness and skills, which \nare a common element of councilors\u2019 day-to-day work. In the absence of a gender consultant, \nthe  international  component  2  capacity-building  consultant  has  reviewed  and  strengthened \ntraining  materials  related  to  gender,  education,  health,  and  child  rights.  The  component  2-2 \npublic  awareness  campaign  also  includes  strong  positive  gender  messages  in  the drama,  TV, \nand radio shows.  \n \n27.  Work  on  the  DoLA  gender  strategy  and  action  plan  is  now  well  under  way.  The \nMarch 2006  draft  is  a  considerable  advance  on  the  November  2005  draft.  It  is  important  to \nrecognize  the  potential  benefits  of  the  participatory,  consciousness-building  approach  adopted \nby the two (female) GTZ consultants concerned. In view of the fact that DoLA and the PLAUs \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB  has  also  financed  a  1-year  program  of  support  to  the  NGO  Women  for  Prosperity,  for  the  development  of \n\nwomen councilors. \n\n19 Published in ADB. 2006. Gender Equality Results in ADB Cambodia: Cambodia Country Report. Manila. February.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n Appendix 2 \n\n35 \n\nProject Management \n\nare overwhelmingly staffed by men, this approach is arguably wise, and it may be a mistake to \nsee rapid production of an \u201cideal\u201d strategy as the key goal. The gender strategy and action plan \nare expected to be completed during 2006, and will be an important guide to the implementation \nof phase II. \n \nK. \n \n28. \nThe  MTR  contained  positive  statements  about  project  management:  \u201cOverall,  project \nmanagement has performed very well. Modest changes to designate and train a deputy Project \nCoordinator;  to  designate  Component  Coordinators;  to  clarify  the  role  and  designation  of \nInternational  TA  advisors  are  proposed\u201d.  The  evidence  is  that  the  sound  management \nperformance  noted  in  the  MTR  has  continued  to  date.  The  Project  had  an  overall  in-country \nexpenditure rate of 84% as of the end of March 2006, and, as described, all four components \nare broadly delivering the results expected. One indicator of the relative performance achieved \nby  project  management  is  the  turnover  ratio,  which  provides  an  indicator  of  disbursement \nperformance.20 At  the  end  of  2005,  CCDP\u2019s  turnover  ratio  was  3.49,  and  much  the  highest \nwithin  the  ADB  Cambodia  portfolio.  The  average  of  the  other  15  projects  in  the  portfolio \n(excluding  CCDP)  was  0.88.  This high  performance  is  mainly  explained  by  the  fast-disbursing \ncomponent 1-1, which accounts for almost two thirds of the in-country budget, but it is also an \nindicator of project management\u2019s overall commitment and capacity.  \n \n29. \nDoLA  has  continued  to  expand,  which  is  a  sound  indicator  of  the  Government\u2019s \ncontinuing commitment to decentralization. By March 2006, DoLA had a staff complement of 59, \nfour of them women, as against 25 (with no women) in 2002. Recruitment policy has continued \nto  favor  young,  relatively  well-educated  staff.  As  noted,  the  staff  training  supported  by  the \nProject has been beneficial and appreciated. The May 2002 prakas, which organized DoLA into \nsix  offices,  has  not  been  amended  and  DoLA\u2019s  structure  and  management  has  continued \nunchanged  to  date.  The  project  technical  cell  (PTC)  concept,  with  five  staff  members  from \ndifferent  DoLA  offices  taking  responsibility  for  the  project,  headed  by  a  co-coordinator  (and \ndeputy  co-coordinator  from  2005),  but  without  a  project  management  unit,  continues  to  work \nwell. The PTC approach has helped keep the Project from becoming an \u201cADB enclave\u201d within \nDoLA.21 The  addition  of  a  capable  contracted  accountant  has  been  very  valuable,  in  terms  of \nthe  quality  of  financial  and  control  and  reporting  achieved,  and  particularly  in  coping  with  the \nvery  heavy  load  of  separate  expenditures  incurred  under  the  component  4  incentive-driven \nregistration  approach.  ADB  responsibility  for  the  Project  was  delegated  from  Manila  to  the \nCambodia  Resident  Mission  in  January  2005.  The  project  staff  members  say  that,  after  the \ninitial  learning  phase,  delegation  and  greater  ease  of  face-to-face  and  telephone  discussion \nhave been of benefit to implementation. It would be desirable for this arrangement to continue \nfor phase II. \n \n30. \nAssessment  and  Implications  for  Phase  II.  Overall,  the  project  management \narrangements have worked well. The generally good performance across all components is an \nindicator of the overall competence of project management to date. The management team, and \nkey individuals within it, has acquired experience over the 3 years of implementation. They are \nnow  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  and  requirements,  and  English  skills  have  improved.  The \n\n                                                 \n20  The annualized imprest turnover ratio is defined as the ratio of total liquidation over the time-weighted average fund \n\nbalance for 12 months. \n\n21  Many ministries in Cambodia have been effectively balkanized into donor fiefdoms and projects. The CCDP RRP \n\nwas explicitly aimed at avoiding this, in part through the PTC concept. \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nmain identified weakness in the Project is that the operation of the four components largely in \nisolation  from  one  another.  The  component  2  public  awareness  campaign  provided  some \nsupport  to  component  4,  but  overall  a  silo  culture  has  dominated,  and  interesting  lessons, \nparticularly in capacity building and devolved management approaches, have not been shared. \nFurther, the absence of a unified organogram and management structure for the TA team in the \nRRP caused difficulties for ADB management at the initial stages of the project. For phase II, it \nwill  be  important  to clarify  the  management  structure,  particularly  within  the  TA  team.  It  would \nalso be desirable for the key implementers of each component to regularly meet (also with other \nDoLA staff and TA). \n \n31. \nIn  early  2006,  a  decision  was  made  to  locate  the  4-year  $20  million  ADB  Ton  Le  Sap \nSustainable  Livelihoods  Project  (TLS-SLP)  within  DoLA.  DoLA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency, \nand will be responsible for implementing component 1 of the project, which is much the largest \nand most demanding. DoLA has no experience in implementing rural development projects, and \nMoI is concerned about the additional load this project will impose on the department.22 There \nwas an intention to make the key CCDP implementors, notably the co-coordinator and deputy \nco-coordinator,  responsible  for  TLS-SLP.  In  view  of  the  size,  complexity,  and  establishment-\nphase  load  of  TLS-SLP,  this  would  have  been  highly  prejudicial  to  the  implementation  of \nphase II.  In  a  meeting  on  4  April  2006,  MoI  and  DoLA  stated  that  they  intended  to  have  the \ncurrent CCDP co-coordinator continue in that role into phase II, and to give responsibility for the \nimplementation  of  TLS-SLP  to  the  deputy  co-coordinator.  In  sum,  the  generally  positive \nassessment of DoLA in the 2002 CCDP RRP (Appendix 7: DoLA \u2013 organizational assessment) \nhas been well-realized in practice. DoLA, the PTC arrangement, and the key implementing staff \nhave developed commendably and are well prepared to implement a second phase of support \nfor decentralization. The compromise arrangement proposed by MoI for handling the TLS-SLP \nappears  sound.  Overall,  the  prospects  for  successful  implementation  of  phase  II  appear  very \npositive. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n22  TLS-SLP is larger than all the other, mainly TA-support, projects within DoLA, combined.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        \n\n         \n\n \nThe donor partner contributions to decentralization and strengthening the operations of sub-national authorities at April 2006 are as \nfollows.

 \n \n(ii) establish a functional and \nuniversally inclusive national CR \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\n \nLocal communities\u2019 living \nstandards increase, \nmeasured by improvements \nto current welfare and \nsocioeconomic conditions \n(reduction in rural \nheadcount poverty by 5% by \n2012). \n \nElected commune \ncouncilors play a role in \ndistrict and provincial affairs, \ncompared with no role \ncurrently in direct and \nindirect scrutiny of resource \nallocation, subnational \npolicies, and service \nprovision (significant \nincrease in commune \ncouncils\u2019 formal acts of \nscrutiny of the activity of \ndistrict and provincial unified \nadministrations). \n \nDelivery of public services \nat all subnational levels is \nmore transparent, \naccountable, efficient, and \neffective, when compared \nwith the reported \nsystematically \nnontransparent, \nunaccountable, and \ninefficient present situation \n(significant increase in direct \nannual reporting activities of \ndistrict and provincial unified \nadministrations to commune \ncouncils and elected \ncouncilors at districts and \nprovinces). \n \n \n(i) By end-Project, surveyed \ncitizens provide feedback \nthat their elected \ncommune/sangkat councils \nare more effective than the \npre-2002 non-elected state-\nappointed commune chief in \nmanaging local \ndevelopment issues, \nassigned roles and duties, \nlocal disputes, and devolved \nservices.  \n \n\nData Sources/ \nReporting Mechanisms  \n\n \nGeneral indicators of living \nstandards produced by the \nNational Statistics Office of \nthe Ministry of Planning, \nUNDP, FAO, and GTZ. \n \nGeneral indicators of living \nstandards produced \nthrough commune and \nhousehold surveys at the \nproject start and project \ncompletion (by the Project). \n \nSurveys, studies, analytical \nexercises on local \nadministration reform, \nfunction, and effectiveness \nin Cambodia (these are \nperiodically sponsored by \nother donors involved in \nsubnational administration \nreform).  \n \n \n\nAssumptions  \n\n \nThe organic law on \nindirectly elected \ncouncils (by the \ncommune councils) and \nunified administrations at \nall levels of subnational \nadministration is \neffectively implemented.  \n \nGovernment commitment \ncontinues for \ndecentralization and \ndeconcentration reforms, \nand for strengthening the \nrole of elected local \ngovernment. \n \nGovernment effectively \nmanages the \ndecentralization and \ndeconcentration process. \n \nLocal democratic \nprocesses continue to \nstrengthen, further \nreducing the risk of elite \ncapture and financial \nabuse of public \nresources. \n   \nNational budget \nrevenues increase and \ndependency on donor \ntransfers is reduced. \n\n \nIndependent surveys \nbased on structural \nquestionnaires on public \nopinion on the quality and \nspeed of councils\u2019 \nresponse and performance \non issues such as CR, land \nregistration support, natural \nresources management, \nresolution of land irrigation \ndisputes, etc (sponsored \nby other donors). \n \n\n \n(i) Government remains \ncommitted to continue \nincreasing financial \nsupport to commune \ncouncils and providing \nthe necessary legal and \nprocedural framework.  \n \n(ii) Overall effective \ndonor assistance \ncontinues for subnational \npublic administration. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n       Appendix 4           43 \n\nDesign \nSummary \nsystem;

Civil Registration System: An \noperational and sustainable \ncomputer-based CR system with \nsecured hardcopy records and a \ncentral searchable and \nextendable database   \n \n3. Capacity Development:  \nTrained councilors, clerks and \ngovernment officials and a 24-\nmonth mass-media campaign, \nboth with explicit targeting toward \nwomen and both consolidating \nthe purpose and implementation \nof local democracy \n \n4. About 423 women councilors \nand WCFPs (i) acquire basic \nskills and knowledge on a range \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n(ii) By 2012, the national CR \nsystem is procedurally \nconnected to all subnational \nlevels of public \nadministration, is able to \ncatalogue and update CR \nrecords in an integrated \nway, and offers services to \nthe public in all provincial \nadministrations in terms of \non-demand production of \nevidence of parentage, \nmarriage, age, origin, and \nfamily structure. \n \n(iii) The national civil \nregistration database is \nused for court and off-court \ndisputes.   \n \n(iv), (v), and (vi) Turnout at \nthe 2012 commune \nelections are successively \n15% higher than in 2002 \nand 2007 and women\u2019s \nparticipation increases in \nthe political process (reach \nat least 10% of total \ncandidates in 2007, and \n15% in 2012). \n \n(iv) Surveyed feedback on \npopular understanding of \ndemocratic principles points \nto a general improvement.  \n \n1.

Women  represented  only  16%  of  candidates.  A  total  of \n11,257  commune  councilors  were  elected  in  1,621  communes,  but,  of  these,  only  951  (8%) \nwere women. Only about one third of commune councils have a woman councilor.1 This was a \nsource of concern for the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (MoWA), and in 2003 it was decided that \neach commune council should have a women and children focal point (WCFP) to be in charge \nof  women\u2019s  and  children\u2019s  affairs. 2 The  need  to  support  women  councilors  and  WCFPs  in \nbecoming  effective  partners  of  commune  councils  was  identified  by  the  MoWA  in  its  Gender \nMainstreaming Evaluation Report (2005). In 2006, the Set Koma (Children\u2019s Rights) Project of \nthe  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  was  approved.  Its  intent  was  to  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  provincial  and  district  women\u2019s  affairs\u2019  officials  to  train  WCFPs  and  women \ncouncilors in organizing and facilitating forums for elected women councilors and WCFPs, and \nestablishing gender networks at the district and commune level. The forums were envisaged to \nprovide  a  viable  setting  for  interaction  and  lateral  learning  between  and  among  WCFPs  and \nfemale  commune  councilors  on  critical  needs  and  constraints  faced  in  the  fulfillment  of  their \nroles  and  responsibilities,  and  the  identification  of  practical  modalities  to  address  identified \nneeds  and  constraints.  In  Cambodia,  while  the  Government  has  been  largely  successful  in \nfostering  commitment  and  action  toward  promoting  gender  equality,  some  areas  still  require \nattention. These include the chronic under-participation of women in the commune councils and \nthe lack of empowerment and self-esteem of women councilors and WCFPs. \n\nTechnical Assistance Impact, Outcome, Outputs, and Components \n\nA. \n \n2. \nThe technical assistance (TA) will support the advancement of gender equity in the next \nphase of decentralization and deconcentration reform. It will strengthen the capacity of elected \nwomen councilors and WCFPs in six target provinces by activating women networking forums in \ndistricts  and  communes.  The  forums  will  provide  women  with  opportunities  to  share  their \nexperience  and  self-learning,  promote  mutual  support  and  networking,  build  confidence, \nincrease  visibility,  and  improve  work  performance.  The  target  provinces  include:  Kompong \nChhnang,  Pursat,  Battambang,  Banteay  Mean  Chey,  Siemreap,  and  selected  districts  of \nKompong Thom not covered by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. The TA components are: \n \n\n(i) \n\nComponent  1:  Training  of  Trainers.  Developing  the  capacity  of  government \nstaff from the Provincial Department of Women\u2019s Affairs (PoWA) and the District \nOffice  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs  (DoWA)  in  six  target  provinces  to  organize  and \nfacilitate  forums  for  elected  women  councilors  and  WCFPs.  The  training  of \ntrainers (TOT) will focus on the development of facilitation skills and techniques \nand  thematic  contents  with  respect  to  the  role  and  functioning  of  commune \ncouncils. \n\n                                                 \n1   Before  the  commune  election  in  February  2002,  MoWA  and  several  nongovernment  organizations  advocated  a \n30%  quota  for  women.  Party  leaders  publicly  agreed  that  it  would  be  very  important  to  have  greater  political \nparticipation from women, but rejected a quota system. \n\n2   Now by law (art. 19 of Subdecree 22) every council must appoint a woman councilor to be in charge of women\u2019s \nand  children\u2019s  affairs.  A  council  that  does  not  have  a  female  elected  member  should  appoint  a  woman  from  the \ncommune to undertake this task. WCFPs have no right to vote in commune council meetings. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8           53 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nComponent 2: Developing the Capacity of Women Councilors and WCFPs. \nSupporting trained staff at PoWA and DoWA to  develop the capacity of women \ncouncilors and WCFPs in the six target provinces. \n\nComponent 3: Establishing Networking Forums among Women Councilors \nand WCFPs.

Women for Prosperity is the only national \nNGO  that  meets  the  required  criteria:  (i)  long-term  presence  and  credibility  in  working  with \nWCFPs and female commune councilors at the national level; (ii) geographic presence, through \na  local  office  and  established  networks  of  trained  staff  and  national  consultants  in  target \nprovinces  (Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Thom,  Pursat  and \nSiemreap);  (iii)  availability  of  pretested  training  methodology,  modules,  and  tools  informed  by \nADB\u2019s gender and development approaches and adapted to the specific needs and constraints \nof  female  councilors  and  WCFPs;  and  (iv)  demonstrated  track  record  of  engagement  and \npartnership with line agencies at central, provincial, and district levels (that is, at the Ministry of \nInterior\u2019s Department of Local Administration [DoLA], PoWA, and DoWA) and local government \nstructures  involved  in  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment-related  activities.  The \nservices are expected to begin in the second half of 2007, or 3 months after the Project takes \neffect, and to be completed 1 year later, in 2008. Information technology supplies, maintenance, \nand materials under the TA will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \n\n3. \n\nMonitoring and Reporting \n\n \n7. \nThe  national  NGO  will  produce  an  inception  report  3  months  after  the  start  of  the \nservices,  and  submit  half-yearly  technical  and  financial  reports  and  a  TA  final  report  to \nCommune Council Development Project 2 and ADB. The final report will include comments from \nthe  Government  and  ADB  and  will  be  submitted  30  days  after  the  final  tripartite  meeting \nbetween  the  Government  (DoLA  and  MoWA),  ADB,  and  the  national  NGO.  The  report  will  be \nsubmitted  in  English  and  should  include  technical  analyses  supported  by  relevant  information \nand data, with administrative and other details in appendixes. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n56 \n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nD. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \nCambodia  is  historically  a  centralized,  hierarchical,  elite-driven  society.  It  is  widely  believed  that  increased  popular \nvoice, accountability, and participation are important drivers of increased equity in the use of national resources, and \npoverty reduction. The 2001 decision to create elected commune government for the first time in the nation\u2019s history \nhas created significant opportunities to strengthen participation and popular voice over time. The Strategic Framework \nfor Decentralization and Deconcentration Reforms (June 2005), the subsequent discussion at the Eighth Consultative \nGroup meeting of the Government and donors in March 2006, and the publication of the implementation framework for \nthe first preparatory phase for subnational democratic development in June 2006 indicate a deepening commitment to \nmore influential and participatory local government. By supporting local public administration reforms in an integrated \nway with the ongoing long-term institutional process of decentralization and deconcentration of public administration, \nthe Project will make a direct contribution to meeting the difficult challenge of refocusing many aspects of government \nand  public  services  delivery,  and  giving  an  increasingly  larger  role  to  commune  councils  in  Cambodia.  Local  public \nadministration  has  been  recognized  to  play  an  essential  role  in  the  promotion  of  democratic  practices  and  in  the \ncountry\u2019s  socioeconomic  development.  It  can  potentially  increase  local  voice  and  representation  in  issues  such  as \nland-use rights, common property and natural resources use, and scrutiny of public service delivery by higher levels of \nsubnational public administration. All this contributes to the efficiency of private capital accumulation and reduction of \nvulnerabilities in local economic activity. \n \nIn  the  Commune  Council  Development  Project  (CCDP),  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  together  with  the \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency and the Government of the Netherlands, has developed an \nimportant  niche  of  support  for  the  decentralization  process.  Many  other  donors  have  sought  to  use  communes  as  a \nmeans  of  delivering  rural  development  interventions  through  the  Seila  Program,  the  Commune  Fund,  and  other \nbilateral  and  NGO  projects.  CCDP  has  focused  directly  on  the  core  capacities  and  functions  of  commune  councils, \naside from their role as implementers of their commune development funds. The assessment of the CCDP review in \nMarch  2006  is  that  such  a  focused  approach  has  been  both  successful  and  appreciated  by  a  wide  spectrum  of \nstakeholders  from  the  central  Government  to  the  general  public.  The  effects  of  having  distinctive  and  appropriate \ncouncil premises, better council communications, training and public awareness raising, commune photomapping, and \na nascent national civil registration (CR) system are increasingly clear in terms of consolidating the local democratic \nprocess and essential local state building. Commune democracy  has been one of the  most important developments \nsince 1993 in deepening the democratization process in Cambodia. Building on the achievements of CCDP, the three \ncomponents  of  this  Project\u2014enabling  more  commune  councils  to  operate  effectively,  developing  the  national  CR \nsystem,  strengthening  popular  understanding  of  democratic  rights  and  accountabilities\u2014are  designed  as  a  further \ncontribution to strengthening the institutions of open, participatory democracy at subnational levels, on which poverty \nreduction, human, and gender rights depend.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nAll three components are concerned with national system strengthening and awareness development toward a more \nopen,  participatory,  and  accountable  system  of  subnational  governmental  functioning.  All  three  components  have \ngood  potential  to  contribute  to  increased  poverty  reduction  over  time,  but  no  specific  poverty  analysis  is  required  or \nappropriate for a system-development investment of this type. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nThe  Review  of  CCDP  (Appendix  2)  reports  the  views  and  perceptions  of  the  public,  councilors,  clerks,  and  officials \nabout the four components and the subcomponents of CCDP. The component selection for this project builds on the \nexperiences of CCDP, and particularly on the effects and benefits of the different elements of CCDP as perceived by \ndifferent stakeholder groups. \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9           57 \n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n   Yes               \n\n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe project purpose (outcome and impact) is to increase democratic participation by consolidating and embedding the \nlocal  democracy  reforms  launched  by  the  Government  in  2001.  The  impact  on  national  participation  systems  will \nincrease over time, following the Government\u2019s plans to increase the remit of elected commune councilors to serve as \nmembers of district, municipal, and provincial councils. \n \nThe quality of participation in a democracy depends in part on the quality of the electoral system. There is evidence \nthat participation has been improving steadily over time. In the 1993 national elections, 4.8 million people voted. This \nnumber  increased  to  5.4  million  in  1998  and  6.3  million  in  2003.  In  the  2002  commune  elections,  5.2  million  people \nvoted. Following the national elections in 2003, the National Election Commission (NEC) introduced a new registration \nsystem, based on a permanent voter list, updated by commune councils every year. By December 2005, the number \nof registered voters had reached 6.7 million. Together with other procedural changes in the NEC, and in the electoral \nprocess, the evidence is that the quality of democracy\u2014and thus of national participation\u2014is steadily improving. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize benefits for women: \n \nThe democratic elections for the 1,621 commune councils that were held for the first time in 2002 (and that will be held \nagain in 2007) provided an unprecedented opportunity for women in Cambodia (51%\u201352% of the population) to have \nan  equal  voice  in  appointing  their  representatives  (the  councilors).  In  terms  of  direct  political  participation,  and  as  a \nconsequence  of  the  political  competition  process  between  parties,  16%  of  the  candidates  for  that  election  were \nwomen. However, of the total of 11,257 commune councilors that were elected in the 1,621 communes, only 951 (8%) \nwere  women.  This  suggests  that  the  distribution  of  skills  within  communes  is  biased  against  women.  Before  the \ncommune  election  in  February  2002,  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs  (MoWA)  and  several  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) advocated a 30% quota for women. Party leaders publicly agreed that women deserve greater \npolitical participation but rejected a quota system. Only about one third of commune councils have a woman councilor. \nIn 2003, at the suggestion of MoWA, it was decided that each commune council should have a women and children \nfocal point (WCFP). This was seen as necessary, given that the majority of commune councils had no female elected \nrepresentatives. Now by law (Art. 19 of Sub-decree 22) every council must appoint a woman councilor to be in charge \nof  women\u2019s  and  children\u2019s  affairs.  If  a  council  does  not  have  a  female  elected  member,  it  should  appoint  a  woman \nfrom  the  commune  for  this  task.  While  the  Government  was  largely  successful  in  fostering  commitment  and  action \ntoward promoting equality, some areas continue to require attention. These include the chronic under-participation of \nwomen  within  commune  councils\u2019  affairs  and  the  lack  of  empowerment  and  self-esteem  of  women  councilors.  The \n2007 elections  will provide an important opportunity to  promote more  women  as commune councilors and to further \nadvance gender equity within the resulting public administration processes and structures. In this context, the need for \ncontinuous support for empowering newly elected women councilors and WCFPs in effectively performing their roles \nand  responsibilities  is  critical  and  forms  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  gender  design  features  within  the  Commune \nCouncil Development Project 2 (CCDP2). \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nThe  CCDP2  gender  action  plan  outlines  relevant  gender  design  features  in  each  of  the  project  components,  to  be \ncomplemented by gender design features in the attached technical assistance (TA) document. Component 1 supports \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  the  construction  of  commune  council  facilities,  and  recognizes  the  need  for  women\u2019s \ninvolvement  in  decisions  related  to  the  location,  design,  and  construction  features  of  the  proposed  infrastructure. \nPriority use of the commune facilities by the Commune Committee for Women and Children (2004)  was agreed and \nwill be reflected in the block-grant agreements. Component 2 will establish a computerized national CR system, which \nwill ensure the conservation of vital records, thus promoting legal certainty, transparency, protection of women\u2019s and \nchildren\u2019s  property  and  inheritance  rights  from  abuse,  and  predictability  in  accessing  basic  social  services  and \nproductive  resources.  The  support  for  gender-responsive  recruitment  practices  within  the  Ministry  of  Interior \nconstitutes an additional design feature of CCDP2. Gender will be mainstreamed in the design of the Department of \nLocal Administration\u2019s (DoLA\u2019s) annual capacity-building plan (2007\u20132009) and media awareness campaign, and the \ndevelopment of relevant training modules in gender and governance, in collaboration with DoLA, targeting the specific \nneeds and constraints faced by MoWA\u2019s provincial and district department staff. Other gender design features include \nthe  recruitment  of  a  full-time  gender  consultant  to  strengthen  the  gender  content  of  DoLA\u2019s  training  programs  and \nmass  media  campaigns.  The  required  impact  assessments  of  component  3  will  require  the  establishment  of  sex-\ndisaggregated  baseline  data  for  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project  activities.  The  past  5  years  have  seen  a \nsteady  increase  in  the  number  of  civil  society  organizations  involved  in  gender  and  decentralization  initiatives \npromoting advocacy and policy making nationally, and promoting women\u2019s leadership and participation in communes \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\fand villages. In this context, CCDP2  will benefit from the skills and expertise of the NGO Women for Prosperity and \nestablish forums and sustainable networks of elected women councilors and WCFPs in six selected provinces. \n \nE.

These  undertakings  will  be \nchecked  by  the  three  supervising  contracted  architect \nengineers during their initial site visits. No problems in this \nregard  were  encountered  for  any  of  the  519  council \npremises  provided  during  CCDP.  No \ninvoluntary \nresettlement issues are expected for components 2 and 3. \nFor component 1, access to councilors and their offices is \nfree  to  all.  No  access  problems  have  been  mentioned  in \nany  of  the  studies  reviewed.  For  component  2,  there  is \nanecdotal  evidence  of  some  councils  demanding  illicit \nfees  for  the  issuance  or  reproduction  of  CR  certificates. \nEfforts to counter this and to publicize the official fee rates \nwere  a  major  part  of  CCDP,  both  through  component  4 \nand  through  the  public  awareness  campaign.  These \nefforts will continue throughout this project. \nThe  evidence  from  the  CCDP  is  that  the  use  of  direct \ncontractor  procurement  by  commune  councils  greatly \nincreased  opportunities  for  local  firms  and  labor  to \nparticipate, as against procurement organized through the \nprovince.  This  type  of  procurement  will  continue  in  this \nproject.  There  are  no  labor  issues  for  components  2  and \n3. \nComponent  1  of  this  project  (and  of  CCDP)  allocates  a \nbudget based on a formula across all provinces, including \nthe  high-minority  eastern  provinces.  One  of  the  three \nstandard  designs  is  a  wooden  structure  favored  in  the \nmountainous  eastern  provinces.  This  design  was  highly \nappreciated  during  CCDP.  Both  components  2  and  3  (as \nin  CCDP)  will  include  materials  and  content  adapted  for \nethnic minorities.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n \nOther Risks and \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Components \nComponent 1: Commune Council Facilities \n \n\n \n\n Component 2: Civil Registration System Development \n \n\nCommune Council Development Project 2: GENDER ACTION PLAN \n \n\nProposed Activities \n\nIndicators \n\n1.

Where no latrines are publicly available in the commune center, and where it is \n\nconfirmed that there is water availability for the whole year, sex-segregated toilets \nwill be included in the standard design for CCDP2 commune council facilities \n3.  Access to adequate working space for elected women councilors and commune \n\nwomen and children focal points (WCFPs) will be ensured to enable them to hold \nregular meetings with their constituency and ensure effective functioning of the \nCommune Committee for Women and Children (CCWC). Priority use for the \nworking spaces, furniture (table and chairs), and storage facilities for the CCWC \nwill be included in the block-grant agreements. \n\n1.  The Department of Local Administration (DoLA) within the Ministry of Interior\u2019s \n(MoI\u2019s) General Department of Administration will recruit additional staff in the \nOffice of Civil Registration (OoCR) to manage the computerized civil registration \n(CR) system supported by CCDP2.
