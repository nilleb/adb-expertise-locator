THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nIndonesian rupiah\u2013denominated loan, without government guarantee to PT Semen Andalas \nIndonesia (SAI) for the Reconstruction of the Cement Production Facility in Aceh (the Project). \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  In 1983, SAI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lafarge S.A. (Lafarge), began operating a \ncement facility with a production capacity of 1.4 million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) in \nLhoknga, near Banda Aceh, Indonesia. SAI also owns distribution terminals in several cities on \nthe coast of northern Sumatra, the company\u2019s target markets.  \n \n3.  Then  on  26  December  2004  the  tsunami  struck  the  north  coast  of  Sumatra,  with \ncatastrophic impact on lives, housing, infrastructure, and various sectors of the economy. The \nearthquake on 28 March 2005 further devastated Nias, Simeulue, and southern parts of Aceh. \nAn estimated 167,000 people died or went missing, and 500,000 were displaced from their \nhomes in Aceh and Nias. About 80,000\u2013110,000 new houses are needed. Roads, bridges, \nports, and other necessary physical and social infrastructure have to be rebuilt or rehabilitated. \nSAI\u2019s plant was almost fully destroyed, causing the company to stop production.  \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) responded immediately to the tsunami disaster by \ncommitting $329 million in grants for rehabilitation and reconstruction. The Earthquake and \nTsunami Emergency Support Project (ETESP) was approved in March 2005 to help restore \nessential public services, rebuild infrastructure, and revive economic activity through livelihood \nsupport. In addition, ADB has contributed $10 million to a multi-donor trust fund administered by \nthe World Bank to support, among others, community regeneration, livelihood rebuilding, and \ninfrastructure development. In April 2005, the Government of Indonesia (Government) created \nthe ministerial-level Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias (BRR) to lead \nthe recovery and reconstruction efforts over the target implementation period of 2005\u20132009. \nADB has been working closely with BRR and other donors in the reconstruction. \n \n5.  The construction of more than 100,000 houses, business premises, and roads and other \ntransport infrastructure requires a large volume of cement and other construction materials. The \nlack of local cement production facility, the long distance between alternative sources of cement \nand the market, and the limited port and ship capacity have made it more costly to construct \nhousing and other infrastructure facilities in Aceh than in other areas in North Sumatra. Lengthy \ntransportation  could  also  delay  reconstruction and  development  of  infrastructure.  Having  a \ncement production facility in the project area would thus be beneficial. The Project would \ndemonstrate  ADB\u2019s  continuing  support  for  reconstruction  work  and  further  infrastructure \ndevelopment in Aceh, and would complement the ongoing assistance under ADB\u2019s ETESP and \nother projects of its development partners.  \n \n ", "2   \nIII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Indonesian Cement Industry \n1.  Overall Demand and Supply \n6.  Nine cement companies in Indonesia operate 15 cement plants with a total installed \nproduction capacity of 46.1 million metric tons (MMT) in 2005. PT Semen Gresik, PT Semen \nPadang, and PT Semen Tonasa are part of the Semen Gresik Group that is 51% owned by the \nGovernment and holds the largest market share of 45.3%. PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa, a \nsubsidiary of Heidelberg of Germany, is the second-largest player with a market share of 29.6%, \nand PT Holcim Indonesia, a subsidiary of Holcim of Switzerland, is the third-largest with a \nmarket share of 15.2%. These top three companies have a total market share of 90%. Each of \nthem operates several large plants across the country. However, 73% of their capacity is in \nJava, which accounts for over two thirds of their sales. The other four small cement producers \n(SAI, PT Semen Bosowa, PT Semen Baturaja, and PT Semen Kupang) each operate a single \nplant or a few small plants in Sumatra or in other islands. The cement industry in Indonesia is \nsubject neither to price control nor to restrictions on foreign investment. Cement producers can \nsell and set prices freely across the country. There is no import tariff on imported cement.  \n \n7.  Before the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia was a net cement importer, producing 24.7 \nMMT  locally  and  importing  1.4  MMT  in  1996.  Some  cement  producers  increased  their \nproduction capacity in 1997 just before the crisis caused a slump in economic growth and a \ncorresponding decrease in cement consumption. The capacity utilization rate plummeted and \nthe  country  started  to  export  cement.  Thanks  to  improving  economic  performance  and \ninvestments, domestic cement demand, which dropped to as low as 18.6 MMT in 1999, has \nsince then increased by 8.5% yearly to reach 30.4 MMT in 2005. Indonesian cement producers \nincreased  their  capacity  utilization  rate  from  51%  in  1999  to  74%  in  2005  and  produced \n33.9 MMT  of  cement  in  2005.  In  response  to  rising  demand  and  higher  domestic  prices \ncompared with export prices, these companies have progressively shifted their sales toward the \ndomestic market. \n \n8.  In 2005, demand for cement grew at a slower 5% as rising oil prices and interest rates \nled  to  a  slowdown  in  infrastructure  investments.  An  increase  in  government  spending  on \ninfrastructure development would drive up demand for cement. Assuming a yearly growth in \ndemand of 7% over the next 5 years, the existing capacity will be met by 2010. The domestic \nproducers are expected to respond to the rising demand by increasing their capacity through \nnew  or  better-performing  plants.  As  foreign  investors  are  not  restricted  from  entering  the \nIndonesian cement industry, the entry of new players could generate additional capacity. These \nprojects are, however, not expected to pose a major threat to existing cement players, given the \nlarge capital investment requirement and the need for a well-developed distribution network and \nbrand recognition. Appendix 2 describes the Indonesian cement industry in more detail.  \n \n2.  Demand and Supply in SAI\u2019s Target Markets \n9.  Because of the low value-to-weight ratio of cement and the producers\u2019 sparse coverage \nof  Indonesia,  each  producer  has  adopted  a  geographically  focused  sales  and  distribution \nnetwork. In Sumatra, three players have a total installed capacity of 8.1 MMTPA. PT Semen \nPadang, a subsidiary of PT Semen Gresik, is the largest producer with a 5.4 MMTPA integrated \nplant in West Sumatra. SAI is in second position with a capacity of 1.4 MMTPA, followed by \nPT Semen Baturaja, a state-owned company whose three small plants in South Sumatra have a ", "  3\ntotal capacity of 1.25 MMTPA. Domestic consumption in Sumatra grew by about 5.2% per year \nin 2001\u20132005. \n \n10.  Demand for cement is projected to stay strong in the post-reconstruction phase, given \nthe improved political situation in Aceh. The tremendous loss of lives, physical infrastructure, \nand economic and social facilities moved the Government and the Free Aceh Movement to \nresume discussions and finally sign a cease-fire agreement in August 2005. In July 2006, the \nGovernment  passed  the  Law  on  Aceh  Governance,  which  gives  the  Acehnese  greater \nself-autonomy in policy making, natural resource management, and infrastructure financing. The \nfirst direct elections for governor, deputy governor, and district officials on 11 December 2006 \nwere peaceful. The high turnout of voters\u2014more than 75% of the 2.6 million in the province\u2014\nclearly indicated public interest in an end to the conflict and in progress toward peaceful and \nstable  development.  Strong  momentum  to  restore  and  maintain  peaceful  development  is \nexpected to attract foreign investments, which will help propel economic growth in Aceh. BRR is \nassisting  the  regional  governments  in  developing  a  sustainable  long-term  economic \ndevelopment  plan  to  further  realize  the  agricultural  and  natural  resource  potential  of  the \nprovince and boost economic growth. \n \nB.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s Operations \n1.  ADB\u2019s Assistance for the Reconstruction of Aceh \n11.  ADB responded immediately to the tsunami disaster by committing $329 million in grants \nfor rehabilitation and reconstruction. The ETESP was approved in March 2005 to help restore \nessential public services, rebuild infrastructure, and revive economic activities through livelihood \nsupport.  The  Extended  Mission  in  Sumatra  became  fully  operational  in  July 2005,  and  an \nextension facility was later established in Banda Aceh. As of 31 December 2006, subprojects \nrequiring up to $191 million in grant funding had been prepared, and almost 59% of that amount \nhad gone to procurement and construction. In 2005 and 2006, the reconstruction was slower \nthan expected because of its scale and complexity, the challenge of coordinating with sectoral \nline agencies, and the Government\u2019s complex budget procedures. However, the Government \nhas addressed many of these constraints and expedited processing. The pace of reconstruction \nactivities should therefore pick up.  \n \n12.  Aceh  is  one  of  the  provinces  in  the  Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand  Growth  Triangle \n(IMT-GT), an ADB-financed regional economic cooperation initiative of the governments of \nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Thailand.1 The  stated  objective  of  IMT-GT  is  to  promote  trade, \ninvestment, and tourism in the subregion, with the private sector playing a major role. The \nprivate sector arm of IMT-GT, the Joint Business Council, formed a task force to assist in the \nrehabilitation of tsunami-affected areas in Aceh in June 2006. The Project therefore fits in with \nthe theme of IMT-GT, which promotes private sector investments as a major source of financing \nfor infrastructure and support facilities.  \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations in Indonesia \n13.  ADB  began  private  sector  operations  in  Indonesia  in  1985.  In  1985\u20131998,  ADB \n                                                 \n1  The IMT-GT, started in 1993, is a regional cooperation initiative between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. It \ncomprises all 10 provinces of the island of Sumatra, and eight provinces or states each from Peninsular Malaysia \nand southern Thailand. The IMT-GT road map (2077\u20132011) has been prepared to provide a vision and framework \nfor cooperation in the IMT-GT and ensure the effective implementation of the IMT-GT programs and projects. \n(IMT-GT. 2007. Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle: A Roadmap for Development 2007\u20132011. Draft.) \n ", "4   \napproved $197.5 million in financial assistance for 16 projects in the general industry and \nfinancial sectors. After the financial crisis, ADB did not provide new financial assistance to \nIndonesia until 2005, when it approved a liquefied natural gas project.2 In 2006, the Board \napproved financial assistance to PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk, a state-owned gas \nutility. This was the first assistance to a non-sovereign entity under the Innovation and Efficiency \nInitiative.3  \n \n14.  Promoting  pro-poor  sustainable  economic  growth  through  infrastructure  and \ninfrastructure services development with private sector participation is one of the areas under \nthe Indonesian Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2006\u20132009. Poor physical infrastructure is \nconsidered a key constraint on sustainable economic growth. The CSP supports private sector \ndevelopment particularly in the infrastructure and financial sectors. Given the lead role of the \nprivate sector in job creation, private sector development will be integrated as far as possible \nwith all ADB operations. The CSP also recognizes the importance of long-term local currency \nfinancing for privately sponsored infrastructure projects, especially those with local currency \nrevenues.  Consistent  with  the  CSP,  the  Project  will  provide  local  currency  financing  for \ninfrastructure development in Aceh through more efficient and sustainable supply of cement. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Project Description  \n15.  The Project involves the reconstruction of a cement production facility, a coal-fired power \nplant, and a jetty, as well as the preparation of a quarry site. All of these facilities will be rebuilt \non  the  same  site  as  SAI\u2019s  original  plant  but  will  have  the  benefit  of  more  efficient  and \nenvironment-friendly production technology. \n \nB.  Project Sponsor \n16.  SAI  was  established  in  1980  by  Circle  Industries  PLC  of  the  United  Kingdom  and \nCementia  Holding  AG  (Cementia)  of  Switzerland  to  build  and  operate  a  cement  plant  in \nNorthern  Sumatra.  SAI  began  its commercial  operations  in  1983  with  an initial  production \ncapacity of 1 MMTPA. Technical improvements later increased this capacity to 1.4 MMTPA. SAI \njoined the Lafarge group of companies (Lafarge Group) when Lafarge purchased Cementia in \n1999 and became fully owned by Lafarge following the takeover of Blue Circle in 2001. The \nmanagement  team  of  SAI  is  composed  of  professionals  with  extensive  experience.  The \ncompany\u2019s board of directors is composed of the company\u2019s president and its senior vice \npresidents for finance and manufacturing. The board of directors, with the members of the \ncompany\u2019s executive committee, meets monthly. SAI also has a board of commissioners that \ninclude representatives from Lafarge.  \n \n17.  Lafarge, based in France, has a worldwide presence and a strong track record of over \n100 years in the building materials business. Its diversified product line (including cement, \ngypsum, aggregates and concrete) and geographic diversification into 70 countries are among \nits key strengths, helping cushion recurring fluctuations in demand for building materials linked \nto economic cycles. In Asia, the Group has operations in Bangladesh, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Viet Nam. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan for the \nSouth Sumatra to West Java Phase II Gas Pipeline Project. Manila. ", "  5\n18.  Lafarge, through SAI, has been operating in Indonesia for 8 years and demonstrates its \ncontinued commitment to its operations in Aceh through financial and technical assistance to \nSAI. Lafarge has involved itself in social and humanitarian activities for the Acehnese, setting up \na construction training center, arranging for a mobile clinic, and rebuilding houses, mosques, \nand schools.  \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n19.  The Project has been classified under environmental category A, i.e., a project with \nsignificant impacts if not adequately mitigated. The summary environmental impact assessment \nreport4 was prepared according to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and was posted on the \nADB website on 6 December 2006. An environmental and social impact assessment of the \nProject  was  conducted  for  SAI  by  a  team  of  consultants5 from  March  to  June  2006  in \ncompliance with the relevant national and provincial laws and regulations for environmental \nimpact assessment, particularly the regulations issued by the State Minister of Environment, \nNumber  308  of  2005,  on  environmental  impact  assessment  for  the  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of Aceh after the earthquake and tsunami. The Project received environmental \nand social clearance from the Ministry of Environment on 16 August 2006. \n \n20.  The Project will adopt an integrated approach to environmental management. It will use \neffective technology, designs, and pollution control equipment to minimize emissions during \noperations,  especially  particulates,  sulfur  dioxide,  and  nitrogen  oxides.  The  damaged \nelectrostatic precipitator will be replaced by bag filters, which are more effective in controlling \ndust emissions. The captive coal-fired power plant will use circulating fluidized bed combustion \ntechnology, which allows the solid wastes from combustion in the form of coal ash, unburnt coal, \nremaining limestone and gypsum to be recycled back into the cement production to reduce \npollutants. The residual emissions will meet the national standards as well as the World Bank\u2019s \nemission guidelines for the cement industry.6 Adverse impacts on ambient air and water quality \nduring  operation  are  expected  to  be  minor.  SAI  has  had  structured  public  consultations \nregarding  the  Project.  As  there  are  no  communities  around  the  project  site,  none  will  be \ndisturbed by the residual dust and noise generated by the construction activities. SAI will \ncontinue providing community development assistance. \n \n21.  SAI  will  set  up  an  appropriate  organization  and  an  environmental  management \ninformation system for the effective management of environmental, occupational health, and \nsafety aspects during construction and operations. SAI has prepared an effective environmental \nmanagement plan, including a monitoring program, which the contractors will implement during \nconstruction under the supervision of SAI. Further, SAI personnel will implement the EMP \nduring operations as part of the routine and integral activities.  \n \n22.  SAI  will  expand  its  limestone  mining  area  to  ensure  safety  in  its  limestone  mining \noperations and to increase its limestone reserves. The land to be acquired is on steep terrain. \nThe land is not inhabited and, hence, there will be no need to relocate houses, plantations, or \npublic services. Given the minor impacts, the Project has been classified as category B under \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). SAI, in consultation with the Aceh Besar Land \nAcquisition Committee (comprising district, subdistrict, and village officials), has compensated \nthe affected persons at negotiated rates that are markedly higher than the market rate for similar \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook. Washington, DC. \n ", "6   \nland (steep terrain). The Project has been classified as category C under ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998), as no persons of tribal or ethnic minority origins will be affected. \n \nD.  Development Impact  \n1.  Impact, Outcome, and Output \n23.  Aceh\u2019s economy has grown more slowly than the rest of the Indonesian economy in the \nlast 20 years partly as a result of the long-standing political conflict. The tsunami worsened \nmatters: it took lives, destroyed infrastructure, and reduced the income and welfare of the \nAcehnese. Economic growth substantially decreased by 13.5% in 2005, and the mining and \nquarrying,  building  and  construction,  and  industrial  sectors  were  most  adversely  affected.7 \nFurthermore, the average inflation rate year-on-year from January to September 2006 was \nrecorded at 29%, compared with 16% for all of Indonesia, because of a hike in oil prices, \ntransportation costs, and prices of construction materials and other tradable goods. \n \n24.  Although cement production under the proposed Project is expected only after the peak \nof reconstruction in 2007 until mid-2008, the Project will help equalize demand and supply and \nthus mitigate cement price escalations and, hence, the construction costs of housing and other \ninfrastructure projects during the subsequent restoration phase. Many of the houses built in the \npast 2 years have been temporary or small. More permanent houses will have to be built and \nsmall houses enlarged. Furthermore, the Project will remain highly relevant, given the need to \ndevelop economic infrastructure facilities to promote investments in the province in the medium \nto long term. With its rich natural resources, including oil and gas reserves, Aceh ranks fifth \namong Indonesian provinces in per capita gross domestic product.  The Project will serve the \nstrong  demand  for  construction  materials  to  support  infrastructure  development  in  a  cost-\ncompetitive and sustainable manner.  \n \n25.  Without a local cement production facility, the province would have to import more costly \ncement or pay more for transporting cement from other cities. The cement production facility in \nAceh,  once  rebuilt  (output),  will  help  make  locally  produced  cement  available  at  prices \ncomparable with those in other cities in North Sumatra (outcome). The Project will contribute to \nthe  development  of  infrastructure  in  Aceh  at  lower  costs,  facilitate  the  revival  of  natural \nresource\u2013based and other related industries, and provide foreign investments to support private \nsector activities in Aceh (impact). \n \n2.  Development Effectiveness \n26.  The development effectiveness of the Project is assessed in terms of private sector \ndevelopment, business success, and economic sustainability. At the company level, the rebuilt \ncement facility will use a more efficient and environment-friendly production process, which will \ncomply  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  as  well  as  the  Government\u2019s  regulatory \nrequirements. SAI is implementing new internal control procedures consistent with Lafarge\u2019s \nstandards. The Project will create employment during construction and operation. Furthermore, \nit will have impact beyond the company. First, the rebuilt facility will support the resumption of \nnatural  resource\u2013based  and  other  associated  industries  such  as  cement  transport  and \ndistribution. Second, the availability of cement supply locally will facilitate the development of \ninfrastructure in Aceh that is conducive to private sector investments. Third, the Project signifies \n                                                 \n7  Growth in the mining and quarrying sector slowed by 33.6%, building and construction by 24.0%, and the industrial \nsector by 20.5%. (BRR. 2006. Aceh and Nias Two Years after the Tsunami Progress Report 2006. Aceh.) ", "  7\nthe continuing commitment of Lafarge, a global leader in construction, to invest in Aceh and \ncould thus create a demonstration effect for further foreign investments in the province. The \nProject will be financially sound and economically sustainable. It will create economic benefits \nthrough lower prices and transportation costs and will help restore balance in cement supply \nand  demand  to  ease  the  increasing  price  pressure  in  the  medium  term.  The  design  and \nmonitoring and development effectiveness frameworks are in Appendix 1. \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  Loan \n27.  The proposed ADB loan, denominated in Indonesian rupiah, will be for up to Rp420 \nbillion ($45 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n \nB.  Justification for ADB\u2019s Assistance \n28.  The Project merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The reconstruction of the new fully integrated cement facility in Aceh will help \nensure a sustainable supply of cement for the massive infrastructure rebuilding \nactivities in the region, ease the increasing pressure on prices, and lead to a \nbetter balance between cement supply and demand in Aceh in the medium term. \nADB has been supporting the rehabilitation and reconstruction activities in Aceh \nunder the ETESP, which covers a broad range of sectors, e.g., housing and \ninfrastructure, agriculture, irrigation, fisheries, and social services. The Project \nwill  facilitate  the  infrastructure  development  and  help  revive  private  sector \nactivities especially in associated industries in the area through employment \ngeneration and the promotion of related businesses. \n \n(ii)  The  Indonesian  rupiah  denominated  loan  will  match  SAI\u2019s  local  currency \nrevenues. In Indonesia, the availability of long-term financing is quite limited. \nMany commercial banks are still in a precarious state and hesitate to provide \nlong-term credit. ADB will provide long-dated financial assistance denominated in \nIndonesian rupiah, thus mitigating the foreign exchange risk of the Project.  \n \n(iii)  The potential ADB local currency bond issue to finance the Project will help \npromote the development of the long-term capital market in Indonesia, consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework.  \n \n(iv)  ADB\u2019s direct assistance to the Project will help ensure that the new production \ntechnology  is  environment-friendly  and  complies  with  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). \n \nC.  Anticorruption; Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n \n29.  SAI was advised of ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption and policy relating to the combating \nof money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require SAI to maintain and comply with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best-practice standards for preventing \ncorruption, and to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. \n \n ", "8   \nD.  Assurances \n30.  A framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto its equity investments, lending operations, and guarantee operations in the private sector is in \neffect between the Government and ADB. Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, the Government will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the \nproposed assistance to SAI. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. \nADB will enter into a suitable loan agreement and other required documents, following the \napproval of the proposed loan by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. These agreements will be on terms \nand conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n31.

Overview of Indonesian Cement Industry  \n1.  In Indonesia, nine cement companies operate 15 cement plants with a total installed \nproduction capacity of 46.1 million metric tons (MMT) in 2005. PT Semen Gresik, PT Semen \nPadang, and PT Semen Tonasa are part of the Semen Gresik Group, which is 51% owned by \nthe  Government  and  holds  the  largest  market  share  of  45.3%.1 PT  Indocement  Tunggal \nPrakarsa, a subsidiary of Heidelberg of Germany, is the second-largest player with a market \nshare of 29.6%, and PT Holcim Indonesia, a subsidiary of Holcim of Switzerland, is the third-\nlargest with a market share of 15.2%. The top three companies have a 90% share of the \nmarket.  PT  Semen  Gresik,  PT  Indocement  Tunggal  Prakarsa,  and,  to  a  lesser  extent, \nPT Holcim Indonesia each operate several large plants across the country. However, 73% of \ntheir capacity is in Java, which accounts for over two thirds of their sales. The other four \ncompanies (PT Semen Andalas Indonesia [SAI], PT Semen Bosowa, PT Semen Baturaja, and \nPT Semen Kupang) each operate a single plant or a few small plants in Sumatra or in other \nislands. The cement design capacity and location of the cement plants of these companies are \ngiven in the table. \n \n2.  The industry saw an untimely increase in capacity just before the Asian financial crisis, \nleading to excess supply and low capacity utilization rate at around 50% in 1988\u20131999. Thanks \nto  subsequent  economic  recovery,  domestic  cement  demand  that  dropped  to  as  low  as \n18.8 MMT in 1999 has since then increased by 9% per year to reach 31.8 MMT in 2005. \nBecause of excess supply, industry capacity was relatively unchanged over the past 5 years, \nand capacity utilization rate increased from 59% in 2000 to 74% in 2005. From being a net \nimporter, Indonesia has become a net exporter since the Asian financial crisis. About 70% of its \nexports are to other countries in Asia, particularly to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. However, given \nthe rising domestic prices compared with export prices, cement producers are progressively \nshifting  their  sales  toward  the  domestic  market.  Historical  cement  supply,  domestic \nconsumption, and export trends are shown in Figure A2.1. \n \n                                                 \n1  Cemex Asia Holding recently sold its shares of 24.7% of PT Semen Gresik to the Rajawali Group.  \n ", " \nIndonesian Cement Producers, 2005  1\n6\n   \nDomestic  Market \nCapacity  Sales  Share  A\np\nCompany  Location of cement plants  (tons)  (tons)  (%)  Major Shareholder  pe\nn\n    d\nix\nPT Semen Andalas Indonesia   Aceh  \u2500a     1,124,580b 3.6  Lafarge    2\nPT Semen Padang   West Sumatra  5,440,000  3,876,732 12.3  PT Semen Gresik \nPT Semen Baturaja   South Sumatra and Lampung    1,250,000  895,235 2.8  Government of Indonesia \nPT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa   West Java and South Kalimantan  15,650,000  9,335,415 29.7  Heidelberg \nPT Holcim Indonesia   West Java and Central Java  9,700,000  4,793,114 15.2  Holcim \nPT Semen Gresik   East Java  8,200,000  7,903,635 25.1  Government of Indonesia \nPT Semen Tonasa   South Sulawesi  3,480,000  2,496,165 7.9  PT Semen Gresik \nPT Semen Bosowa Maros   South Sulawesi  1,800,000  922,363 2.9  Bosowa Group \nPT Semen Kupang   East Nusa Tenggara  570,000  68,942 0.2  Government of Indonesia \nTotal  46,090,000  31,486,181 100.0 \n a  PT SAI's cement production facility is under reconstruction.         \n b  PT SAI imported cement from Lafarge Group.          \n Source: Indonesia Cement Association.          \n \n \n ", " \n  \nFigure A2.1: Production Capacity, Domestic Consumption, and Exports of Cement \n \n \n \n5m0illion tons 44.3 46.5 46.5 46.1 45.2 45.5 44.3\n45\n37.8\n40 33.6\n35 27.3 7.6 6.7\n30 24.3 9.5 8.0 7.3\n25 0.0 0.3 0.8 9.0 8.5\n4.5\n20\n1105 24.2 25.4 27.4 19.3 18.8 22.3 25.7 27.2 27.5 30.2 31.5\n5\n0\n1 9 9 5 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5\nDomestic Consumption Exports Capacity\n \n \n \nSource: Indonesia Cement Association. \n \n \n3.  In 2005, demand grew by only 5% as the hike in interest rates and inflation that resulted \nfrom the Government\u2019s decision to cut fuel subsidies slowed down infrastructure expenditures. \nAs macro conditions improve and government spending increases, especially on infrastructure \ndevelopment, cement consumption will correspondingly increase. In October 2005, Indonesian \nconstruction spending indeed lagged 9% behind its precrisis level whereas gross domestic \nproduct was 21% above the precrisis level. In 2006, the Government announced its plan to raise \nexpenditures on infrastructure projects to Rp44 trillion from Rp35 trillion in 2005, representing \nan  increase  of  about  26%.  The  largest  state-owned  toll  road  operator  estimated  total \ninvestments of about Rp 89.7 trillion over the next 10 years. Around 10% of this amount will be \nused for cement consumption, projected at about 1.3 million metric tons per annum (MMTPA). \nAssuming overall demand growth of 7% yearly, the existing excess capacity is expected to be \nabsorbed by 2010. Per capita cement consumption in Indonesia, at 144 kilograms (kg) in 2005, \nwas relatively lower than in other countries in the region,2 so there is potential for further growth. \nBoth greenfield projects and expanded or more efficient plants should increase industry capacity \nby at least 3.5 MMT in the next 4 years.   \n \n4.  Further capacity expansions could come with the entry of new players. However, they \nare not expected to pose a major threat to existing cement players, given the large capital \nrequirements for new plants and the need to develop a distribution network and brand loyalty. \nWith  rapid  increases  in  cement  prices  in  the  domestic  markets\u2014up  to  Rp38,000  per  bag \n(equivalent to $84 per ton) in 2005, or about 35% higher than the 2004 level\u2014the risk of imports \nis also increasing. For example, the PRC could be an exporter to Indonesia. However, it is \nbelieved that the risk to the existing producers is limited, given the rapid growth that is expected \nto continue in the PRC.  \n                                                 \n2  Such as 147 kg in the Philippines, 319 kg in Viet Nam, 445 kg in Thailand, 568 kg in Malaysia, 659 kg in Brunei \nDarussalam, and 860 kg in Singapore. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 11 \n5.  In terms of geographic locations, Java is the largest-consuming region with the highest \nshare  of  62%  of  the  national  demand.  The  top  three  cement  producers,  which  competed \naggressively for market share in this region, appear to have switched to a \u201cfor profit\u201d rather than \na \u201cfor market share\u201d strategy to maximize shareholder value and improve financial health. In \nother regions, smaller producers are ranked among the top three companies in market share, \ngiven the limited radius of competition in the cement industry. For example, SAI is ranked \nsecond  in  Sumatra,  while  PT  Bosowa  Maros  is  ranked  second  in  Sulawesi  and  eastern \nIndonesia.  \n \nB.  Demand and Supply in SAI\u2019s Relevant Markets \n6.  Because of the low value-to-weight ratio of cement and the sparse geographic coverage \nof Indonesia, each producer has adopted a geographic focus for its sales and distribution \nnetwork. SAI\u2019s cement production facility in Lhoknga near Banda Aceh had installed capacity of \n1.4 MMTPA. Its target markets are Aceh, North Sumatra, Riau mainland, and Riau islands. \nCement consumption in these markets increased from 3.3 MMT in 2003 to 3.6 MMT in 2004 \nand 3.7 MMT in 2005, for a yearly growth of 4.9% in 2003\u20132005. There are other two cement \nproducers in Sumatra. PT Semen Padang, a subsidiary of PT Semen Gresik, has an integrated \nplant in West Sumatra with a capacity of 5.4 MMTPA. PT Semen Baturaja is another state-\nowned company operating in South Sumatra with a total capacity of 1.3 MMTPA from three \nsmall plants. Given the limited competitive radius of cement, PT Semen Padang could be \nconsidered the only competitor of SAI in the North Sumatra market. \n \n7.  Since SAI had to cease its production after the tsunami, the region experienced a \nshortage of cement, which, coupled with price speculation, drove up cement prices in Aceh by \n63% to an average price of Rp 41,600 per bag in 2005, from Rp 25,500 per bag in 2004. The \nprice in Aceh was about 8.7% higher than prices in Sumatra and 10% higher than in Indonesia \nas a whole. A significant portion of this price gap is due to higher transportation cost.  \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070503112218+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20070502093603+08'00'", "Title": "PT Semen Andalas Indonesia for the Reconstruction of the Cement Production Facility in Aceh", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0.5 (Windows)", "Keywords": "proposed loans indonesian rupiah, reconstruction cement production facilities, tsunami construction houses businesses premises"}, "author_page": " \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) ends on 30 November. \u201cFY\u201d before a calendar year denotes \nthe year in which the fiscal year ends.  \n(ii)  In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.  \n \n \n \nVice President  L.
