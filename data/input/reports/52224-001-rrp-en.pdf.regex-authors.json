I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $41,380,000 equivalent in tenge to M-KAT Green Limited Liability Partnership (M-KAT \nGreen LLP) for the Total Eren Access M-KAT Solar Power Project in Kazakhstan. \n \n2.  The loan will provide long-term local currency financing not readily available in the \nKazakhstan market to build and operate a 135 MW direct current (nominal power) solar power \nplant. By supporting an established international renewable energy investor, it will provide impetus \nto Government of Kazakhstan efforts to promote investment in the renewable sector. This will \nhelp replace imports of electricity in power-deficient south-eastern Kazakhstan with indigenous \nrenewable sources. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Kazakhstan\u2019s electricity sector is largely privatized and unbundled \ninto generation, transmission, and distribution systems, and power traders. There is competition \nin electricity generation as Kazakhstan operates a wholesale market and tariffs are deregulated, \nalthough  the  government  has  retained  price  regulation  in  \u201csocially  significant\u201d  segments.1 \nHowever, the major challenge is the reliance of the electricity sector on coal-fired plants. As of 31 \nDecember 2017, Kazakhstan\u2019s total installed capacity was 21.6 gigawatts, with available capacity \nof 18.7 gigawatts. Coal-fired plants account for 80.5% of generated electricity, hydro power plants \nfor 10.9%, gas for 8.2%, and solar and wind sources for 0.4%.2 There are 118 power plants with \ndifferent forms of private and state-controlled ownership. The government classifies the most \nimportant assets (large thermal power plants and hydro power plants) as power plants of national \nimportance. While some investments in upgrades have been made over the years, about 70% of \ninstalled capacity is considered technically obsolete.3 There is still a significant electricity supply \nshortage, especially in Kazakhstan\u2019s southern region. The country\u2019s entire electricity sector needs \nsignificant investment to rehabilitate outdated assets and expand capacity.4 In 2013, Kazakhstan \nadopted an ambitious plan to transition to a green economy, aiming to increase the share of \nrenewable energy in electricity generation to 50% by 2050.5 \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has a strong working relationship with the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in Kazakhstan. The EBRD has been very \nactive in Kazakhstan renewable energy, policy and investments, and successfully financed \nseveral renewable energy projects. ADB and EBRD are jointly financing the Baikonyr Solar Power \nProject,6 which is the first joint renewable energy project between ADB and EBRD in Kazakhstan. \nBuilding on this successful partnership with EBRD, ADB was invited to support the project, as \nADB is one of very few financial institutions with the capacity to raise local currency funding to \nfinance renewable energy projects with tariffs denominated in tenge.  \n                                                \n1  As a result, affordability for consumers and cost recovery are well addressed and balanced. \n2  Kazakhstan Operator of Electric Power and Capacity Market. 2017.

The project comprises the design, construction, commissioning, and \noperations and maintenance (O&M) of a 135 megawatt (MW) (direct current) ground-mounted, \nsolar power plant with single axis tracking system (along with associated infrastructure) and grid \nintegration for further electricity sale per a fixed tariff. The project site  is in southeastern \nKazakhstan, about 3 kilometers (km) south of the town of Shu in the Jambyl Region and will cover \n500 hectares. The land needed for the project has been acquired and leased  from the land office \nof Shu district for 49 years. The main project components will include approximately 403,200 \nphotovoltaic panels, 40 inverters, a substation and a 12 km 220 kilovolts (kV) transmission line to \nthe existing 500kV substation. The total annual output from the project is expected to be 207 \ngigawatt-hours, with an average capacity factor of 17.5% at P90.7  \n \n6.  Power from the project will be sold under a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) \nwhich was executed on 9 September 2016 between M-KAT Green LLP and the Financial \nSettlement Centre for Support to Renewable Energy Sources LLP (FSC). All electric power \nproduced by the project will be purchased by the FSC, a limited liability partnership created in \n2013 and 100% owned by the Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company Joint Stock \nCompany (KEGOC) for the promotion of renewable power sources in Kazakhstan. The prevailing \nfixed tariff rate for power produced from solar energy is T34.61 per kilowatt-hour less value-added \ntax, indexed annually and adjusted for inflation (confidential information redacted). \n \n7.

Integrity and enhanced tax integrity due diligence were conducted.8 No significant or \npotentially significant integrity risk was identified. ADB\u2019s review of the transaction does not give \nADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering, terrorism financing, or cross-\nborder tax evasion.9  \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n12.  Impact. The project is aligned with Strategy Kazakhstan\u20132050 which targets an increased \nrenewable electricity supply.10 The project will also help avoid carbon dioxide emissions and help \nKazakhstan fulfill its nationally determined contribution to the Paris Agreement (15% below 1990 \nlevels by 2030).  \n                                                \n7  P90 denotes the level of annual solar-driven electricity generation that is forecast to be exceeded 90% of the year, \nwhile capacity factor shows the expected electrical energy output per year as a percentage of the maximum possible \nelectrical energy output over the same period. \n8  ADB. 2003.

Concept for Transition of the Republic of Kazakhstan to Green Economy. Astana \n(30 May). Strategy Kazakhstan\u20132050 targets that alternative sources (solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear) provide at \nleast 3%of electricity production by 2020, 30% by 2030, and 50% by 2050. By 2030, solar power plants with a \nminimum capacity of 500 MW shall be installed. \n \n ", " 3 \n \n13.  Outcome. The project outcome will be additional solar power generation to satisfy the \nincreasing electricity demand and the avoidance of carbon dioxide emissions.11  \n \n14.  Outputs. The outputs are (i) 135 MW direct current (nominal power) of solar power project \nis commissioned and operated by the private sector; (ii) generation of local employment; (iii) \nstimulation of local and national economy; and (iv) gender equity of human resource policy \nimproved. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n15.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which includes tackling climate change and enhancing environmental \nsustainability as among the key operational priorities.12 ADB\u2019s support for the project is also in \nline with its country partnership strategy for Kazakhstan, 2017\u20132021,13 as the project will help \nfoster sustainable green growth in response to climate change by promoting the use of renewable \nenergy sources, and support private sector operations in clean and renewable energy. \n \n16.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. ADB\u2019s Energy Policy \nemphasizes investments in renewable energy projects, private sector participation, and wider \naccess  to  energy. 14  The  project  complements  the  recently  approved  Samruk-Energy \nRestructuring and Transformation Project, which has a focus on developing a renewable energy \npipeline in the country.15 This ADB loan will be counted as climate financing and will help achieve \nADB\u2019s annual climate finance target of $6 billion by 2020. \n \n17.  Lessons  learned  from  previous  operations.  ADB,  jointly  with  other  international \nfinancial  institutions,  has  been  actively  involved  in  the  dialogue  on  legal  and  regulatory \nimprovements  to  attract  private  sector  investments  in  renewable  energy  generation  of \nKazakhstan. The project will benefit from ADB's earlier support to the government to achieve its \nintended nationally determined contribution and renewable power generation targets.16 The \ntransmission operator KEGOC has been trained and equipped with modern tools to analyze the \nimpact of intermittent power generation sources on the grid stability and undertake necessary \nstabilizing measures (confidential information redacted).  Key lessons learned is the significance \nof having a robust upstream regulatory framework and ensuring that the grid is sufficiently \nstrengthened to accept renewable, intermittent sources of energy,  before the private sector can \nbe meaningfully attracted to the renewable sector at scale.  \n \nD.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n20.  (Confidential information redacted). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n   \nA.  The Assistance \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance comprises non-recourse financing with a typical security \npackage of up to $41,380,000 in tenge equivalent to M-KAT Green LLP from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, with a tenor of up to 13 years (confidential information redacted). \n   \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n22.  The project\u2019s viability depends on its ability to amortize its high up-front capital costs over \na long period. The repayment profile of the ADB loan, which is significantly longer than what is \navailable in the market for similar transactions, is necessary for the project to achieve sound debt \nservice coverage levels over the life of the project. ADB\u2019s proposed assistance will also have a \ndemonstration effect on other developers and sponsors, thereby helping establish the viability of \nsolar power projects in a country with an emerging solar power sector. ADB\u2019s local currency \nsupport\u2014appropriate  for  projects  of  this  nature  that  generate  local  currency  denominated \nrevenues\u2014will  strengthen  the  momentum  towards  long-term  local  currency  financing  of \nrenewable energy assets. ADB\u2019s assistance will ensure that the project is developed with high \nenvironmental and social standards. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n23.  (Confidential information redacted).  \n \n24.

Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n31.  ADB has determined the investment to be in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009),  with  the  following  categorizations:  environment\u2014category  B,  involuntary \n ", " 5 \n \nresettlement\u2014category C, and indigenous peoples\u2014category C.17 ADB has undertaken due \ndiligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social impacts of the project and the \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts in the safeguard \nreports and plans. The environmental and social measures and the institutional capacity and \ncommitment of M-KAT Green LLP to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are \ndeemed adequate. \n \n32.  Environmental  Safeguards.  An  initial  environmental  examination  report  has  been \nprepared by an independent consultant. The potential environmental impacts\u2014noise, vibration, \ndust, waste generation, ground contamination, and soil erosion\u2014are generally associated with \nconstruction activities. These impacts are generally site-specific and short-term and can be \neffectively  managed  by  implementing  good  engineering,  construction,  and  housekeeping \npractices as well as preventive and control measures reflected in the World Bank Group\u2019s \nEnvironmental,  Health,  and  Safety  General  Guidelines,  as  detailed  in  the  site-specific \nenvironmental  management  plans.18 Occupational  health  and  safety risks  will  be  mitigated \nthrough the development of a health and safety plan that will include routine training, monitoring, \nand the provision of personal protective equipment. Environmental and occupational health and \nsafety  provisions,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements,  will  be \nincorporated into the contractor agreements. The sponsor is required to submit a safeguards and \nsocial  monitoring  report  on  an  annual  basis  that  will  include  information  on  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental and social aspects.  \n \n33.  Social Safeguards. The project will not cause involuntary resettlement and will not impact \nindigenous peoples. The project will be built on a 500-ha state reserve land classified as pasture \nland. The land has not been allocated to any entity. A graveyard and water canal were within the \ninitial land allocation plan, but these areas will be excluded when the solar power plant is fenced \nto avoid displacement impacts. Two adjacent villages - Alga and Sauytbek - graze their livestock \nin the area until early summer, after which the grass withers and irrigation channels dry out. \nTraditional non-intensive husbandry is practiced, with the villages accessing the adjacent state-\nowned pasture land. The fencing of the solar power plant will not have significant impacts \nbecause: (i) the allocated area is poorly vegetated grassland, a portion of which is used only for \ngrazing in spring and early summer; (ii) the villagers consider non-intensive husbandry as a hard, \nrisky business, with marginal profit, and would readily change to another profession or intensive \nhusbandry with livestock kept indoors; and (iii) other pasture lands are available that can be \naccessed and used by the villagers and herders. (Confidential information redacted).  \n \n34.  (Confidential information redacted). \n \n35.   The proposed solar power project site is in the Shu district of Jambyl Region. Inhabitants \nof the area are almost exclusively Kazakh, with a few oralman (returnee) families from the \nKarakalpak region of Uzbekistan, Iran and the People\u2019s Republic of China. The oralmans are fully \nintegrated with the local community, know the legislation, and are represented in the local \ngoverning bodies. The project will not impact sociocultural groups who may be considered \nindigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n36.  Gender Mainstreaming. The project is categorized as having some gender elements. M-\nKAT Green LLP commits to implementing measures to promote opportunities and welfare for \n                                                \n17 ADB.

The \nproject will provide equal opportunities for women workers who apply for a position during project \nconstruction and operations. During the construction period, a maximum of 400 workers are \nexpected to be employed, of which 5% are likely to be women. During the operations phase, the \nproject will employ about 16 staff (4 technical specialists, 3 cleaners, 6 solar panel cleaners, and \n3 guards), at least 25% of whom will be women. Women staff will benefit from relevant training. \nThe human resources policy will be enhanced to include provisions on nondiscrimination and \nprevention of sexual harassment. A corporate social responsibility program will be developed \nwhich will take into consideration projects that will benefit vulnerable people including women and \ngirls.  \n \n37.  M-KAT Green LLP and its contractors will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant \nto  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  and  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the \ninternationally recognized core labor standards.19 M-KAT Green LLP will submit an annual report \nto ADB on (i) its environmental and social performance; (ii) implementation of gender measures; \nand (iii) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with national labor laws, and the measures taken to \ncomply with the core labor standards. The project will be implemented in accordance with \napplicable  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  disclosure \nrequirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n38.  M-KAT Green LLP was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n \n39.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n40.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),20 \nADB  will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of \nKazakhstan has no objection to the assistance to M-KAT Green LLP. ADB will enter into suitable \nfinance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.
