It  will  develop  human resources  to work  as  skilled  workforce  in four  priority \nsectors: manufacturing, construction, electricity, and electronics. The project will help transform \nfive  selected technical  training  institutes  (TTIs)  into  leading  technical  and vocational  education \nand training (TVET) institutes in Cambodia to produce high-quality technicians in priority sectors \nand  to  respond  to  changing  technology  and  industry  needs.  The  project  will  also  strengthen \nindustry\u2019s  role  and  engagement  in  skills  development,  focusing  on  upskilling  and  reskilling  of \nexisting  workers.  Industry  and  TTIs  will  forge  partnership  agreements  to  promote  work-based \nlearning (WBL) programs and expand the skills development fund (SDF) as an innovative TVET \nfinancing mechanism. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\nBroad context. Cambodia is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with an \n3. \naverage growth rate of 7.1% during 2011\u20132017. To achieve this, the country has embraced the \n\u201cFactory  Asia\u201d  model  of  economic  growth,  deploying  a  large  supply  of  inexpensive  low-skilled \nlabor to manufacture simple products for export, particularly garments and footwear.  However, \ndespite a favorable economic growth forecast, there are signs of medium-term downside risks. \nFor example, the minimum wage in the garment sector has more than doubled from $80 a month \nin 2013 to $182 a month in 2019, while labor productivity has not improved. Cambodia\u2019s ranking \nin the Global Competitiveness Report 2018 remained low (110th out of 140 economies) because \nof difficulties finding skilled employees.1 The growth model of attracting foreign direct investment \nfor labor cost advantage is getting diluted. The Government of Cambodia aims to diversify and \nmodernize industries from labor-intensive to skills-driven ones to sustain economic growth, as laid \nout in its Industry Development Policy (IDP), 2015\u20132025. 2 As such, it has prioritized reform of its \nTVET  system  to  equip  its  future  and  current  workforce  with  the  required  skills  to  make  the \ntransition from low-skilled jobs to higher-skilled jobs. \n \nLabor force. On average, Cambodia adds 200,000 persons to its labor force annually.3 \n4. \nWhile  the  agriculture  sector  contributed  25.3%  to  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and \naccounted for 37% of total employment in 2017, the industry sector (32.8% of GDP and 26% of \nemployment in 2017) and the services sector (32.8% of GDP and 37% of employment in 2017) \nhave been the main sources of job growth since 2012. This has been driven by an expansion in \nmanufacturing,  tourism,  and  construction.  Only  30%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  working  age  population  of \n10.4  million  completed  lower  secondary  education  (up  to  grade  9).  Of  this  cohort,  only  6.6% \ncompleted post-secondary education (beyond upper secondary education or grade 12).4 \n\n                                                \n1  World Economic Forum. The Global Competitiveness Report 2018. Geneva. \n2  Government of Cambodia. 2015. Industrial Development Policy, 2015\u20132025. Phnom Penh. \n3  Cambodia\u2019s working age population (ages 15\u201364) grew by an average of 2.4% per annum compared with its general \npopulation, which grew by 1.9% per annum during 2007\u20132015. The working age population increased from 8.3 million \nin 2007 to 10.4 million in 2017 (51% of which are women). \n\n4  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports Cambodia in improving its educational attainment through a series of \nloans aimed at strengthening upper secondary education outcomes. ADB. Cambodia: Upper Secondary Education \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIndustries \n\nface  skills  gaps  and  shortages,  particularly \n\nSkills shortage and skills gap. The low skill base of Cambodia poses barriers for the \n5. \ncountry  to  diversify  and  modernize  its  industries,  move  up  global  value  chains,  and  increase \ncompetitiveness. \nin  machining, \nmechatronics in the manufacturing and construction sectors, and electrical technology. A 2017 \nemployer survey identified technicians and associate professionals in these sectors as the most \ndifficult positions to fill.5 Significant skills gaps and shortages result from low education attainment, \nweak industry relevance of training (especially at the post-secondary diploma level), and lack of \nindustry-specific  medium-term  skills  demand  planning.  The  Ministry  of  Labour  and  Vocational \nTraining (MLVT) in 2018 established four sector skills councils (SSCs) comprising representatives \nfrom industry associations in manufacturing, construction, auto mechanics, and electrical works. \nThe SSCs are expected to serve as a platform for TTIs and industry to jointly identify skills gaps \nand shortages in each industry and plan skills trainings. However, as the MLVT lacks the capacity \nto  engage  industry  in  TVET,  SSCs  are  yet  to  be  effective.  Industry  representatives  have  little \nincentive to invest time and effort to engage with MLVT and TTIs. \n \n6. \nLack  of  industry-relevant  diploma-level  technical  and  vocational  education  and \ntraining  programs.  There  are  56  public  TTIs,  of  which  only  23  TTIs  under  the  MLVT  and  4 \ninstitutes under Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) offer post-secondary diploma-\nlevel TVET programs. However, most of the diploma programs are for service sector jobs, such \nas business administration and information and communication technology. There is a need to \nexpand  and  strengthen  diploma-level  TVET  programs  catering  to  industry  sector  jobs  by \nupgrading training facilities and equipment in the TTIs, and updating curricula to meet industry \nneeds. Upgrading TTI trainers\u2019 technical and pedagogical skills with industry experience will be \nvital. TVET graduates are less prepared for the world of work and lack necessary foundation skills \n(such  as  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics)  and  industry-specific  technical \nskills.  Female  graduates  in  diploma-  level  TVET  programs  are  particularly  low,  such  as \nconstruction (4%) and electricity (6%).6 \n \nLack of opportunities for upskilling and reskilling current workers. Most small and \n7. \nmedium-sized enterprises do not have the capacity to provide any training to their employees.7 \nLarge employers, mostly foreign firms in special economic zones, invest in some in-house, on-\nthe-job  training,  but  without  any  linkages  with  TTIs.  While  some  TTIs  have  entered  into \npartnerships  with  industry,  there  is  no  system  to  expand  work-based  continuous  learning \nopportunities for upskilling current workers. Formal training opportunities are limited to only those \nwho  possess  at  least  lower  secondary  education  graduation  certificates.  Thus,  many  current \nworkers are trapped in low-wage and low-skill jobs. \n \n8. \nInadequate financing to the technical and vocational education and training sector. \nThe current level of public TVET financing is insufficient and not responsive to labor market needs. \nIn 2018, the MLVT budget was around 6% of the total national budget for education and training. \nAbout  80%  of  the  budget  allocated  for  TVET  is  used  for  recurrent  expenditures,  particularly \n                                                \n\nSector  Development  Program;  and  ADB.

Very  little  remains  for  investment  in  TVET  facilities  and  training \nequipment,  and  in  building  partnerships  with  industry  for  work-based  continuous  learning \nprograms. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted a feasibility study in 2017 to explore \noptions and implementation strategies for innovative TVET financing mechanisms to increase the \nprivate  sector\u2019s  investments.8  Based  on  the  study\u2019s  recommendations,  the  government \nestablished a pilot SDF in the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to foster engagements \nand cost sharing of training programs with industry.9 The pilot SDF is an industry demand-driven \nworkforce development financing mechanism that encourages joint financing with industry, with \nfocus on upskilling and reskilling current workers. \n \n9. \n Government  strategy  for  skills  development.  The  IDP;  the  Rectangular  Strategy \nPhase IV;10 and the National TVET Policy, 2017\u20132025 reaffirm the government\u2019s commitment to \nskills development as a means of facilitating inclusive growth. The IDP has set specific targets to \nincrease the share of the industry sector in GDP through increased growth of the manufacturing \nsector (20% by 2025). The government aims to develop a comprehensive, long-term, multisector \npolicy \nindustrial  development,  employment  generation,  and  skills \ndevelopment. \n \n10. \nThe  MLVT,  MoEYS,  and  MEF  have  consulted  with  representatives  of  industry  and \nemployer associations, the Cambodia Productivity Committee, and other stakeholders to identify \npriority sectors for skills development in achieving IDP objectives. Four sectors were identified: (i) \nmanufacturing\u2014focusing on machining, mechatronics, and agro-processing; (ii) construction; (iii) \nelectricity; and (iv) electronics. These were prioritized based on analyses of labor market trends, \neconomic factors, skills shortages and skills gaps, national policies such as the IDP, and industry \nassociations\u2019 demand. \n \n11. \nADB  engagement  in  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training.  ADB  has \nsupported education and TVET in Cambodia since 2001 and is the leading development partner \nin the sector. Earlier TVET support focused on improving nonformal and entry-level short-term \nprograms. This contributed to increased employment opportunities for low- and semiskilled labor, \nmostly  in  the  agriculture  sector.  The  ongoing  TVET  Sector  Development  Program11  supports \nsecondary-level TVET (certificate level or Cambodia Qualifications Framework [CQF] levels 2\u2013\n4),12  and  reforms  in  assessment  and  certification systems.  It  has  also  supported  the  MLVT  to \nestablish SSCs. The project builds on these previous and ongoing ADB-financed TVET projects \nand supports the IDP goals by producing high-quality technicians (diploma level or CQF level 5) \nin the four priority industry sectors. It complements the TVET Sector Development Program in \nsupporting  TVET  reforms  in  close  coordination  with  SSCs,  industry  associations,  and \ndevelopment partners.13 \n \n\n                                                \n8  ADB.

The  CQF  for  TVET  has  eight  levels  starting  with  a \nvocational certificate  (level 1);  TVET  certificates  (levels  2\u20134),  which  are equivalent  to  upper  secondary  school  or \ngrades 10\u201312; diploma (level 5) equivalent to postsecondary or grade 12 completion; bachelor\u2019s degree (level 6); \nmaster\u2019s degree (level 7); and doctorate degree (level 8). \n\n13 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fLessons learned. The project design incorporates lessons learned from earlier projects \n12. \nand ensures its transitions to more industry demand driven TVET project. First, there should be \na clear  incentive mechanism  and continuous  trust-building  dialogues  between  the  government \nand industry to enhance demand-driven skills development. SSCs thus need to be strengthened \nwith  appropriate  incentives  to  bridge  the  gap  between  government  agencies,  TTIs,  and \nemployers.  Second,  TVET  financing  mechanism  should  be  diversified  and  strengthened  to \nincrease the private sector\u2019s contributions to skills development. Third, the selected TTIs should \nnot be passive beneficiaries of project activities and should commit to achieve key performance \nindicators at the institute level. This assures sustainability of results beyond project completion. \n \n13. \nValue added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s added value comes from several key innovative \nfeatures: (i) expanding toward institutionalizing SDF as an innovative TVET financing mechanism, \n(ii)  piloting  WBL  programs  through  partnership  arrangements  with  industry  for  upskilling  and \nreskilling  of  current  workers,  (iii)  enhancing cross-sectoral  and  development  synergies in skills \ndevelopment in the agro-industry14 and electricity sectors, (iv) strengthening industry linkages by \nengaging  the  Cambodian  Federation  of  Employers  and  Business  Association  (CAMFEBA)  to \nreflect industry\u2019s demands,15 (v) incorporating key emerging issues such as climate change in the \nupgraded  TVET  curricula,  and  (vi)  developing  a  long-term  skills  development  road  map.  The \nproject aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).16 \n \n\nTable 1: Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \n\nProject Tasks \n\nImprove education and training and facilitating quality job creation by (i) increasing \naccess to quality diploma-level programs in priority sectors and (ii) providing upskilling \nopportunities for the current workforce through industry engagements and innovative \ntechnical and vocational education and training financing mechanism expansion. \nPursue gender equality in human development and promote women\u2019s economic \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to trainings. \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \nAddressing remaining \npoverty and reducing \ninequalities \n\nAccelerating progress in \ngender equality \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  Cambodia\u2019s  industrial  structure  is \nmodernized and transformed from labor intensive to skills driven by 2025 (footnote 2). The project \nwill have the following outcome: skills and competitiveness of men and women in the industrial \nlabor force improved.17 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nOutput  1:  Quality  and  relevance  of  postsecondary  technical  and  vocational \neducation  and  training  improved.  Diploma-level  industry-responsive  skills  development \nprograms will be delivered by the five selected TTIs. The project will produce a total of 18,000 \nqualified technicians (of which 28% are women) with higher employability and advanced technical \nskills  in  four  priority  sectors:  manufacturing  (focusing  on  machining,  mechatronics,  and  agro-\nprocessing);  construction;  electricity;  and  electronics.

Output 1 will improve the quality \nand industry relevance of the selected TTIs by (i) upgrading 16 new training facilities (workshops, \nlaboratories,  classrooms,  and  dormitories)  with  gender-sensitive  and  energy-saving  design \nfeatures (separate dormitory floors and toilets for women and men, accessible design features for \ndisabled  students);  (ii)  providing  advanced,  industry-grade  training  equipment;  (iii)  upgrading \ndiploma-level  competency-based  curricula  and trainers\u2019  capacities  in  partnership with  industry; \nand (iv) providing merit-based stipends to selected diploma students. The five TTIs were selected \nthrough a series of consultations with industries and the government, and will serve as change \nagents.18  The  selection  considered  strategic  locations  of  TTIs  near  to  economic  corridors  and \nspecial economic zones in the country and the capacity of TTIs to act as change agents. Each \nTTI has identified its priority programs based on current and future local market needs, and has \ncommitted to achieve agreed key performance indicators to sustain project outputs.19 \n \nOutput  2:  Work-based  learning  programs  with  industry  partnerships  promoted.20 \n16. \nOutput 2 will provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities for existing workers to address skills \ngaps and skills shortage in industries. It will develop the capacity of SSCs and the five selected \nTTIs to identify training needs, develop needs-responsive trainings, and deliver WBL programs \neffectively to upgrade the skills of existing workers. WBL programs will also meet the continuing \ndemand from industries to train workers\u2019 soft skills such as teamwork and communication. The \nselected TTI trainers and industry-liaison unit staff will be trained to implement at least 18 WBL \nprograms  in  partnership  with  industries,  which  will  provide  WBL  opportunities  to  at  least  360 \nexisting workers. In addition, the selected TTIs will develop at least 20 WBL proposals to access \nto  the  pilot  SDF  (output  3).  ADB,  through  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD) \ncofinancing, will engage CAMFEBA to fully operationalize SSCs by mobilizing a coordinator and \nproviding financial  incentives  to  industry  representatives for  providing  expertise for  the  project. \nThis includes providing advice to the MLVT, MEF, and TTIs on future industry and market trends, \nand technical expertise to the MEF to evaluate proposals submitted to the pilot SDF. \n \n17. \nOutput  3:  Innovative  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  financing \nmechanisms expanded. Output 3 will expand the pilot SDF, which is currently managed by the \nMEF\u2019s  Department  of  Macroeconomic  and  Fiscal  Policy  (DMFP).  It  is  an  innovative  model  in \nCambodia to increase and incentivize industry\u2019s investments in skills development (para. 8). The \ngovernment  has  allocated  $5  million  from  the  national  budget  for  the  pilot  SDF,  with  ADB\u2019s \ntechnical assistance to establish the governance structure, operational mechanism, and financial \nmanagement. Implementation  arrangements  for  the  pilot  SDF  are  set  forth  in  the  SDF  project \nadministration manual (PAM) and the SDF financial management manual.21 The project will (i) \nfinance training proposals to be funded by the pilot SDF, which provide training opportunities for \nat least 3,500 persons in the labor force (of which at least 25% are female); (ii) develop capacity \nof the MEF\u2019s DMFP to strengthen its management of the pilot SDF; and (iii) provide support for \nthe establishment of a new SDF agency by producing key policy study and knowledge products, \n\n                                                \n18 The  five  TTIs  are  Battambang  Institute  of  Technology,  Institute  of  Technology  of  Cambodia  (ITC),  National \nPolytechnic  Institute  of  Angkor,  National  Technical  Training  Institute  for  TVET  Park,  and  Regional  Polytechnic \nInstitute Techo Sen Svay Rieng. \n\n19 Key  performance  indicators  are  included  in  the  Project  Administration  Manual  (PAM)  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n20 WBL programs under the project include delivery of training in the workplace by training providers, center-based \nspecialized training, or a combination of both. The program may be on technical or soft skills, and may be intensive \nfull-time short courses or delivered part-time, as may be agreed in the partnership agreement. \n\n21 PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2), Annex 3. \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fwhich  include  a  long-term  skills  development  road  map.

The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is estimated at 9.7%, \nwhich is above the minimum required threshold for ADB social sector projects (6%). This indicates \nthat the project is economically viable or that the value of the expected economic benefits from \nthe  project  is  above  the  opportunity  cost  of  the  required  investment.  The  principal  benefits \nconsidered in the analysis are the likely incremental wages to be earned by additional graduates \ntrained under the project. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the project\u2019s economic internal rate of \nreturn is sensitive to possible changes in employment rate among training graduates as well as \nchanges in training participation and completion rates. \n \n24. \nFinancial sustainability. The project will contribute additional funds to raise the annual \ngovernment expenditure on TVET. In 2018, of the $54 million total budget allocated to the MLVT, \nover one-third ($18.7 million) was allocated to the DGTVET. To fully cover the project\u2019s operation \nand maintenance costs, the DGTVET requires about $1.4 million per year (9.2% of its recurrent \nbudget in 2018) from 2024 to 2028, and about $1.8 million per year (12.3% of its recurrent budget \nin 2018) from 2029 onwards. This requires the DGTVET\u2019s recurrent budget to grow by at least \n2.38%  per  year  starting  in  2019.  This  is  lower  than  the  expected  7%  growth  rate  for  the \nCambodian economy, and the DGTVET\u2019s recurrent budget, indicating that the project is financially \nsustainable. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the \n25. \noverall pre-mitigation financial management risk for the project as well as for the executing agency \nand  each  implementing  agency  is  substantial.  The  major  risks  involve  the  limited  capacity  of \nMLVT, DGTVET, ITC, and DMFP staff in financial management, including financial reporting. The \nmitigation measures include (i) appointing qualified counterpart staff for the project management \nunit (PMU) and implementing agencies, (ii) recruiting three financial management consultants to \nsupport each implementing agency, (iii) providing training and financial management information \nsystems software, and (iv) continuing to develop operational systems for the pilot SDF. \n \n26. \nProcurement.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  concluded  that  the  overall  risk \nrating  is  medium.  All  procurement  and  recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  undertaken  by  the \nrespective implementing agencies through procurement committees. To strengthen procurement \ncapacity,  ADB  and  the  project  implementation  consultants  will  provide  in-country  support  and \ncarry  out  training  for  PMU  staff  and  the  implementing  agencies.  ADB  will  mobilize  a  start-up \nprocurement  consultant  to  support  advance  actions  for  civil  works  and  consulting  services \nprocurement.  In  addition,  three  procurement  consultants  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  each \nimplementing  agency  to  ensure  compliance,  quality,  and  timely  procurement  activities. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  works,  and  recruitment  of  consulting  services  will  be  undertaken \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  As  ADB  will  partially  administer  the  AFD  loan,  universal \nprocurement will be applied. \n \n27. \n\nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n\n \n\n\fto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MLVT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nC. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n28. \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming and designed to help reduce \ngender  inequality  in  accessing  TVET  and  increase  the  number  of  female  skilled  workers  in \nnontraditional sectors. Most of the female students in TVET are enrolled in courses on accounting, \nfinance and banking, and information and communication technology. In 2018, an estimated 19% \nof the students and only 10% of the trainers in the priority sector technical courses in the selected \nTTIs were women. The project will promote enrollment of female students to diploma-level TVET \nand capacity building of female trainers in teaching and management positions. The gender action \nplan  includes  measures  to  attract  more  women  to  acquire  industry-relevant  skills  and  gain \nemployment into male-dominated sectors. The project will upgrade facilities in the selected TTIs \nwith  gender-sensitive  design,  develop  gender-sensitive  diploma  modules  and  training,  and \nprovide  merit-based stipends  to female students.  Partnerships between the  selected TTIs  and \nindustries  to  promote  female  technicians  and  adopt  gender-inclusive  policies  for  hiring  female \nstudents, workers, and trainers will be established. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n29. \ncategories are as follows.24 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  an \n30. \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) have been prepared covering civil  works at TTIs. The \ndraft IEE and EMP were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The final IEE and EMP will be disclosed \nfollowing  detailed  designs.  The  improvements  proposed  through  the  project  will  not  cause \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  potential  impacts  associated  with  construction \nand  demolition  of  buildings  include  community  and  occupational  health  and  safety  hazards, \nincreased  noise  and  dust  levels,  waste generation and  disposal,  and  traffic  congestion. These \nimpacts can be mitigated through effective implementation of mitigation and monitoring measures, \nas specified in the EMP, and good construction site management practice. The PMU and project \nimplementation  units  will  designate  counterpart  safeguards  staff  to  monitor  compliance  of  the \ncontractors  with  the  EMP,  relevant  regulations  of  the  government,  and  ADB  policies,  with  the \nsupport of one national safeguards consultant. The Ministry of Environment has approved building \ndesigns. Project-related complaints will be addressed through a grievance redress mechanism. \n \n31. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). Due diligence confirmed that all selected TTIs \nare existing operational education facilities located on state-owned land plots and will not require \nacquisition of additional land and/or involuntary resettlement. The due diligence report was disclosed \non the ADB website. \n \n32. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Due  diligence  confirmed  that  the  project  is  not \nexpected to have any impact on indigenous people, as it is not being implemented in provinces \nwith indigenous communities. \n \n\n                                                \n24 ADB.
