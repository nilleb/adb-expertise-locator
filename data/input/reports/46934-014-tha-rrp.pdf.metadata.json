With  its  recent  acquisitions  and  projects  currently  under  development, \nEGCO  plans  to  increase  its  installed  renewable  energy  capacity  to  more  than  300  MW  by \n2015.3\n EGCO\u2019s strategy aligns with the Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan, \n2012\u20132021 approved by the Government of Thailand in December 2011, which sets a target of  \n2,000  MW  of  solar  power  capacity  by  2021.  The  plan  also  sets  a  target  of  generating  25%  of \nprimary  energy  from  renewable  sources  by  2021,  thereby  avoiding  76  million  tons  of  carbon \nemissions annually.  \n \nThe project is eligible for cofinancing from the ADB CTF.4 The Clean Technology Fund \n3. \nprovides  concessional  financing  to  support  the  rapid  deployment  of  low-carbon  technologies \nwith significant potential to reduce and avoid greenhouse gas emissions over the long term. It is \nadministered through multilateral development banks, including ADB, and is one of the largest \nfunds helping developing countries fill gaps in financing projects to mitigate climate change. The \nCTF trust fund committee approved the allocation of $99.5 million for the CTF Thailand Private \nSector Renewable Energy Program on 24 May 2012, to be utilized and administered by ADB.5 \nThe  proposed  project  is  the  third  private  sector  project  in  Thailand 6 under  the  ADB  CTF 7\n \n(approved and under due diligence), for a total allocation of $54 million to date. \n \n4. \nAs of September 2012, Thailand had 32,000 MW of installed power generation capacity. \nThe country\u2019s electricity production depends heavily on conventional fuels, with 66% produced \nusing  natural  gas  and  20%  using  coal  and  lignite.  Natural  gas  has  traditionally  provided  a \nreliable and low-cost source of energy, but growing demand and dwindling natural gas reserves \nfrom the Gulf  of Thailand  mean  the  country must  diversify  and  secure  alternative fuel  sources \nfor power generation. Fortunately, Thailand has abundant renewable energy sources\u2014biomass, \n                                                \n1   Financed by the Clean Technology Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   EGCO\u2019s  current  operating  installed  capacity  for  renewable  energy  includes  9.9  MW  of  biomass  and  63  MW  of \n\nsolar.   \n\n4   Climate Investment Funds. http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org. \n5   ADB Thailand Private Sector Renewable Energy Program approved by the CTF Trust Fund Committee on 24 May \n2012 pursuant  to  the  Financial  Procedures  Agreement  entered  into between  ADB  and  the  International  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development as trustee of the Trust Fund for the Clean Technology Fund, 18 March 2010. \n6   The first two private sector projects identified under the ADB CTF are the Provincial Solar Power Project and the \n\nTheppana Wind Power Project.    \n\n7   ADB. 2009.

Using  these  domestic  sources  of  renewable  energy  can \nboost  Thailand\u2019s  energy  security,  save  foreign  exchange,  and  protect  the  country  from  global \nprice fluctuations in energy markets.  \n\n \nTo  complement  its  renewable  energy  strategy,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  advocates \n5. \ndecentralized power generation mainly by supporting the country\u2019s small power producer (SPP) \nand very small power producer (VSPP) programs. The SPP program allows private developers \nto  build,  own,  and  operate  10\u201390  MW  power  projects  and  enter  into  power  purchase \nagreements  (PPAs)  with  the  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT).  Under  the \nVSPP  program,  producers  of  up  to  10  MW  may  sell  power  to  the  Metropolitan  Electricity \nAuthority or the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Renewable energy SPPs and VSPPs are \neligible for a feed-in tariff (or \u201cadder\u201d) in addition to the wholesale electricity price.    \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\n6. \nSolarco,  a  special-purpose  company  incorporated  in  Thailand  and  100%  owned  by \nYanhee EGCO Holding (YEH), will develop the project. EGCO owns all the common shares of \nYEH  and  has  exclusive  rights  to  manage  YEH  and  Solarco.  EGCO  is  Thailand\u2019s  first \nindependent power producer and is currently the second largest private power producer in the \ncountry.  EGAT  privatized  EGCO  in  1992;  it  was  listed  on  the  Stock  Exchange  of  Thailand  in \n1995.  EGCO  is  25.4%  owned  by  EGAT  and  23.9%  by  TEPDIA  Generating. 8  EGCO  has \ninvested in power projects in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, and Thailand \nwith  a  total  installed  capacity  of  6,194  MW. 9 Yanhee  Solar  Power  owns  the  YEH  preferred \nshares. The founder of Yanhee International Hospital owns Yanhee Solar Power.10\n  \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n7. \nThe  project  will  diversify  Thailand's  energy  mix  by  adding  renewable  energy  capacity, \nthus  helping  the  country  progress  toward  its  clean  energy  targets. 11\n To  achieve  sustainable \nlong-term economic growth, Thailand is promoting alternative sources of energy  such as solar \nfor power generation, and is beginning its transition to a low-carbon economy. Solar energy is a \nclean  and  sustainable  source  of  electricity  that  diversifies  the  country\u2019s  energy  mix, \nstrengthening energy security and reducing reliance on fossil fuel. \n \n8. \nThe project contributes to accelerating and expanding private investment in clean energy \ninfrastructure in Thailand. Successful project implementation and viable returns are expected to \nattract other private investors to solar energy projects. \n \n\n                                                \n8  TEPDIA Generating is jointly owned 50% each by Mitsubishi and Tokyo Electric Power. \n9  This figure includes projects under development. \n10 Dr. Supot Sumritvanitcha is the founder of Yanhee International Hospital. Yanhee is a multiservice general hospital \nin Bangkok that specializes in a range of medical and cosmetic services. Yanhee comprises a hospital with a 400-\nbed  capacity,  95  outpatient  rooms,  12  major  and  30  minor  operating  rooms,  an  intensive  care  department, \nemergency  rooms,  delivery  rooms,  and  a  nursery.  The  founder  of  Yanhee  has  some  experience  in  renewable \nenergy through a prior solar power project in 2011.   \n\n11 The  government  has established clean  energy  targets  of  2,000  MW of  solar  power  by 2021 and  25% of primary \n\ncommercial energy from renewable sources by 2021. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n9. \nThe  outcome  will  be  the  demonstrated  viability  and  sustainability  of  a  utility-scale  solar \nproject  in  the  private  sector.  Avoided  carbon  dioxide  emissions  are  considered  an  outcome \nindicator in addition to the usual financial and operating indicators. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\n10. \n \nC. \n\nThe output will be a 57 MW solar power project constructed and commissioned. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\nConsistency  with  Strategy  2020.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  supports  development  that  is \n11. \nenvironmentally  sustainable  and  enlists  the  private  sector  to  meet  growing  energy  demand  in \nthe region, capitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure development, finance, and \nother areas.12\n The strategy supports expanding environment-friendly technologies for clean and \nefficient  energy  generation  and  use,  as  well  as  a  larger  role  for  private  sector  financing  of \ninfrastructure through public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n12. \nConsistency  with  the  country  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2007\u2013\n2011  for  Thailand  has  three  core  strategic  areas:  infrastructure,  environmental  sustainability, \nand  capital  markets. 13 The  government\u2019s  Alternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  2012\u20132021 \nnotes the immense potential for solar power in Thailand and that energy imports can be avoided \nthrough  its  use  with  private  investment.  The  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  long-term \nobjective for the Thailand Clean Technology Fund Investment Plan to use ADB CTF resources \nto support renewable energy projects in the private sector.14\n \n \n13. \nConsistency  with  the  Energy  Policy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy \nPolicy,  which  emphasizes  investments  in  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy  projects,  and \nwider  access  to  energy. 15\n It  advances  ADB\u2019s  target  of  investing  $2  billion  per  year  in  clean \nenergy  by  2013  to  accelerate  low-carbon  growth  and  reduce  regional  greenhouse  gas \nemissions, as well as the target of the Private Sector Operations Department to attain 25% of its \nannual approvals for clean energy projects. Further, under the Asia Solar Energy Initiative, ADB \nis committed to identifying, developing, and assisting implementation of  3,000 MW of new solar \npower  projects  by  2013,  providing  up to  $2.25  billion  in  financing  and  leveraging  an  additional \n$6.75 billion.  \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\n                                                \n12 ADB.  2008.

EGCO owns all the \ncommon  shares  of  YEH  and  has  exclusive  rights  to  manage  YEH.  EGCO  is \nThailand\u2019s  first  independent  power  producer  and  is  currently  the  second  largest \nprivate power producer in the country.  \n \nFirst quarter 2013\u2013fourth quarter 2013 \nConstruction period of 8\u201310 months \n \nThe  project  will  be  developed  under \narrangements. \n \nBoth  EPC  arrangements  will  supply  multi-crystalline  PV  modules  from  REC \nModules,  a  subsidiary  of  REC,  which  was  established  in  1996  and  is  a  leading \nvertically integrated solar firm. It is based in Norway and listed on the Oslo Stock \nExchange.  The  modules  are  manufactured  in  Singapore  at  an  integrated \nproduction  facility  with  an  annual  capacity  of  800  MW  for  2012.  The  REC  solar \nmodule  was  announced  as  the  best  performer  in  the  independent  Photon  Field \nPerformance  Test,  which  demonstrated  a  6%  greater  electricity  yield  on  average \ncompared with other leading solar PV firm modules.a  \n \nThe first EPC arrangement (EPC I) includes Phoenix Solar (Singapore), which will \nbe  responsible  for  the  design  and  supply  of  PV  modules  and  inverters,  and \nPESCO, which will be responsible for the construction and supply of the balance of \nplant  equipment.  Phoenix  Solar  (Singapore)  and  PESCO  are  jointly  and severally \nresponsible for all liabilities under the EPC I.  \n \nPhoenix Solar (Singapore) is a subsidiary of Phoenix Solar, a leading international \nPV  system  integrator.  Phoenix  Solar  develops,  constructs,  and  operates  large-\nscale PV plants and is a specialist in turnkey arrangements. The company has sold \nsolar modules with a peak power of more than 1 gigawatt since it was first founded. \nPhoenix Solar is based in Germany and is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. \nPESCO,  established  in  1986,  is  a  Thai  mechanical  and  electrical  contractor. \nPESCO provides a full scope of services in the design, supply, and installation of \nturnkey  projects.  Phoenix  Solar  (Singapore)  and  PESCO  have  experience  in \nThailand as contractors for a 16 MW solar power project.  \n \nThe second EPC arrangement (EPC II) includes Italthai, which will be responsible \nfor the design and construction, as well as the supply of inverters and the balance \nof plant equipment. REC Modules will be responsible for the supply of PV modules. \nThe EPC II arrangement has two points of responsibility and division of obligations \nunder two parallel contracts. REC Modules will guarantee module defects and the \n25-year efficiency warranty of the modules. Italthai will provide delay damages and \nguarantee the plant performance ratio for 2 years.   \n \nItalthai is a related company of Italian-Thai Development Public Company, which is \none  of  the  largest  construction  contractors  in  Thailand  and  is  listed  on  the  Stock \nExchange of Thailand. It has more than 50 years of experience in construction and \n\n                                                \n16  Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nAspects \n\nArrangements \na  strong  track  record  in  construction  projects  for  private  clients  and  government \nauthorities,  such  as  EGAT,  MEA,  and  PEA.
