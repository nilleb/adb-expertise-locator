I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $100,000,000 equivalent in US dollars, euro, yen, and yuan to Shanghai SUS Environment \nCompany Limited (SUS) for the Eco-Industrial Park Waste-to-Energy Project in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The project entails the financing of a portfolio of waste-to-energy (WTE) plants to be \nconstructed and operated by SUS, located primarily in second and third tier cities in the PRC.  \nSUS  can  treat  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW),  biomass,  sludge,  kitchen,  food,  medical, \nconstruction,  and  electronic  waste  within  Eco-Industrial  Parks  (EIPs)  to  achieve  maximum \nresource recovery and minimize pollution, in a closed loop recycling system. The project targets \ntotal waste treatment capacity of 1.1 million tons per annum by 2020.  \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s assistance in the project will support (i) proliferation of the circular economy1 \nthrough EIPs, which maximize recycling of resources; (ii) utilization of integrated urban waste \nmanagement systems, which make cities more livable in the PRC; and (iii) climate change \nmitigation with increased renewable energy generation and reduction of methane generated by \nlandfills.   \n \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n4.  Project identification. The PRC is the world's largest producer of MSW, generating about \n190 million tons of MSW per annum by 2012.2 The PRC is expected to produce over half a billion \ntons of MSW per annum by 2025.3 Traditionally, significant amounts of MSW  were dumped in \nunsuitable landfills, resulting in citizens, especially the urban poor living near the landfills, being \nexposed to severe air pollution, soil and groundwater contamination, greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemission and, in particular, methane gas. The World Bank Group estimates that approximately \n10%  of  the  MSW  in  the  PRC,  would  still  be  untreated  by  2020,  due  to  rapid  economic \ndevelopment, urbanization, and scarcity of land for waste treatment in the PRC. \n \n5.  As of 2016, approximately 60% of the MSW was landfilled, while 38% was incinerated in \nthe PRC. Landfills are facing capacity limit due to mounting land pressures, especially in urban \nareas, and increasing environmental concerns. To tackle the severe pollution from over-spilling \nlandfills, the PRC has established policies and a regulatory framework to support the development \nof the MSW WTE industry.  \n \n6.  In accordance with the PRC\u2019s 13th Five Year Plan for Renewable Energy Development \n(2017), the MSW incineration capacity is expected to increase to 480,000 tons per day by 2020 \nversus 255,850 tons per day in 2016. By 2020, at least 50% of the treated MSW should be \nincinerated for cities in the PRC. The WTE power generation capacity target has more than \ndoubled to 7.5 gigawatt (GW) by 2020 versus 3 GW in the 12th Five Year Plan. Under the plan, \n                                                \n1 In contrast to a \u201ctake, make, dispose\u201d production model, in a circular economy, resources, waste, emissions, and \nenergy consumption are minimized through reuse, recycling, product life extension, and closed loop systems to \nachieve economic and environmental sustainability. \n2 World Bank Group. 2012. 68135 What a Waste, A Global Review of Solid Waste Management.

European Union. \n ", "2 \npublic-private  partnerships  (PPPs)  and/or  build  operate  transfer  (BOT)  WTE  projects  are \nencouraged by the PRC government to improve MSW treatment capacities and reduce reliance \non landfills. \n \n7.  Furthermore, to alleviate mounting land pressures in rapidly growing urban areas and \npromote resource conservation through a circular economy, the PRC government has introduced \npolicies and standards for EIPs. The EIP concept is based on the United Nations Environment \nProgram  and  Japan\u2019s  Kita-Kyusyu  Eco  City  Project  which  promoted  material  and  energy \ncirculation, performance assessment, and low-carbon development. Within the EIPs, waste \ntreatment facilities and landfills are co-located within a dedicated recycling park, where land use \nis minimized. The energy and material flow of the core WTE plant are integrated with the other \ntreatment facilities to achieve maximum resource recovery within the EIP. For example, the WTE \nplant can provide waste heat and steam for sludge dehydration, kitchen waste fermentation, and \nmedical waste autoclave. Meanwhile, all combustible treated waste residues from the ancillary \nwaste treatment facilities can be redirected to the WTE incinerator, minimizing ultimate residues \nto landfills and sewage discharges. \n \n8.  Through discussion with stakeholders in the PRC\u2019s WTE industry and ongoing screening \nof project opportunities, the project team identified SUS as an emerging sponsor in the PRC\u2019s \nenvironmental protection industry, with an innovative, integrated, and socially inclusive solution \nto  urban  waste  management  through  its  EIPs.  SUS\u2019s  WTE  and  EIP  projects  have  been \nrecognized by the PRC government as PPP national demonstration and model projects.  \n \n9.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n10.  SUS acknowledged ADB\u2019s strong sector experience and value add in the private sector \ndevelopment of the WTE industry in the PRC and developing Asia and requested ADB to provide \nfinancing to support the development of its WTE portfolio in the PRC.  \n \n11.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Borrower \n \n12.  SUS is the borrower and sponsor of the project. Established in 2008, SUS is a leading \nenvironmental protection company headquartered in Shanghai, PRC. SUS provides equipment \nand solutions for grate incineration technology for WTE power plants and develops and operates \nWTE plants and EIPs in the PRC. SUS is the licensee of Hitachi Zosen Corporation (HZC), a \nglobally  leading WTE  engineering  company  with  820 WTE  units  in  commercial  operations \nworldwide.  Based  on  HZC's  VON  ROLL grate  incineration technology,  SUS  developed  an \ninnovative combustion system, which is localized for optimal waste incineration in the PRC.  \n \n13.

Improved municipal solid waste management in more livable cities in the \nPRC. The project will promote the PRC\u2019s proliferation of circular economy, whereby recycling of \nresources are maximized and pollution minimized. The project will support WTE plants which can \ntreat MSW in a safe and environmentally friendly manner, through SUS\u2019s proven moving grate \nincineration technology and advanced emissions control systems. The project is aligned with the \nPRC\u2019s target of increasing MSW incineration treatment capacity to at least 50% of total MSW \ntreatment capacity by 2020.  \n \n16.  Increased renewable energy generation capacity from municipal waste. The project \nwill tackle climate change and contribute towards the PRC\u2019s target of increasing WTE power \ngeneration capacity to 7.5 GW by 2020.  \n \n17.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be MSW treated and renewable energy generated \nfrom environmentally sustainable WTE plants in the PRC. The project will support WTE plants \nthat will treat 1.1 million tons of MSW annually, generate 275 gigawatt-hours of clean energy \nannually,  and  reduce  carbon  dioxide  emissions  by  about  737,154  tons  annually.  Energy \ngeneration from MSW WTE plants will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing electricity \ngenerated by coal-fired plants, and avoid methane generated by landfills. \n \n18.  Outputs. The project outputs will comprise: (i) the completed construction of a portfolio \nMSW WTE plants in the PRC with an aggregate installed electricity generation capacity of 60 \nmegawatts and MSW treatment capacity of 3,000 tons per day, (ii) local employment generated \nthrough at least 40 new construction jobs, and (iii) local purchase of goods and services totaling \nat least $23 million. \n \nD.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n19.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. ADB\u2019s Strategy 20305 outlined \nseven operational priorities for ADB to address the complex development challenges in Asia and \nthe Pacific Islands. By leveraging the private sector to finance and develop WTE EIPs, which \nutilize advance waste treatment and emissions technologies, the project advances ADB\u2019s two \nimportant  operational  priorities:  (i)  tackling  climate  change  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability, and (ii) making cities more livable. By supporting private sector investments in low-\ncarbon EIPs through PPPs, the project also contributes to ADB\u2019s private sector development and \noperations. \n \n20.  The project is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC for \n2016\u20132020,6 and its country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020,7 both of which promote the \nsupport  for  environmentally  sustainable  urban  infrastructure  development,  green  cities \ndevelopment, and private sector development.  \n \n21.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy to pursue cross-cutting projects which \ndeploys innovative technology and integrated waste management systems to enhance urban \nhealth and environmental sustainability in the PRC.  \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2018.

The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy,8 which prioritizes energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy development, which will (i) ease growth in fossil fuel demand, (ii) improve \nenergy security, and (iii) reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By replacing electricity otherwise \ngenerated by coal-fired plants and avoidance of methane, the project will contribute towards the \nPRC\u2019s national target of increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption \nto around 20% by 2030, from 11.2% in 2014 under the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change. \n \n24.  The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Urban Strategy9 and Urban Operational Plan,10 in \npromoting  integrated  urban  planning  to  catalyze  climate-friendly,  resilient,  inclusive,  and \nenvironmentally sustainable urban development. Amidst scarcity for land and natural resources \nin rapidly urbanized PRC cities, the low-carbon WTE EIP projects supported by ADB will harness \nthe principles of circular economy. \n \n25.  Lessons from previous operations. The project incorporates lessons such as robust \nproject design, portfolio financing approach, and good environmental and social management \npractices, from ADB\u2019s financing and knowledge products completed to date on waste to energy. \nADB supported municipal and agricultural WTE projects in the PRC in 2009 and 2012.11 ADB\u2019s \nportfolio approach has also facilitated the financing of multiple subprojects too small to be \nfinanced alone. This has contributed to private sector participation in the municipal environmental \ninfrastructure sector and has effectively mitigated GHG emissions. The project approved in 2009 \nwas  evaluated  as  satisfactory  based  on  four  criteria:  (i)  its  contributions  to  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  ADB\u2019s  strategic  development  objectives;  (ii)  economic  performance;  (iii) \nenvironmental, social, health, and safety performance; and (iv) business success of the project.12  \n \nE.

The ADB assistance is a direct loan of up to $100 million equivalent in US dollars, euro, \nyen and yuan. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s  loan  proceeds  would  be  used  to  leverage  locally  available  finance.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance will enable SUS to invest, develop and operate a portfolio of WTE plants through its \nsubproject companies. During the life of the loan, SUS and its subproject companies will be \nrequired to comply with covenants stipulated in the loan agreement, including regular monitoring \nreports on finances, operations, and development effectiveness, and requirements to meet \nminimum financial ratios typical for this type of transaction. \n \n ", "6 \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n31.  Strengthen Capacity and Improve Industry Standards. ADB will strengthen SUS\u2019s \nenvironment, social, and governance standards through SUS\u2019s adoption of an upgraded ESMS, \nimproved gender policies, and better corporate governance practices. By supporting the project \nwhich utilizes best available technologies for waste incineration and pollution control, ADB will \npromote international best practices for MSW treatment and enhance the environmental and \nsocial safeguards performance of the WTE industry in the PRC. \n \n32.  Financing  Structure.  Through  a  portfolio  approach,  ADB  is  utilizing  an  innovative \nstructure to finance a number of WTE plants that are too small or costly to be financed on a stand-\nalone basis. The diversified cash flows generated from a portfolio of subprojects also lowers the \nconcentration risk relative to a single project. \n \n33.  Catalyze Private Sector Resources. ADB\u2019s participation will catalyze additional funding \nfrom financial institutions that are not familiar with the financing of WTE plants, especially those \nlocated in low-carbon EIP\u2019s. Furthermore, these commercial banks will gain experience with the \nWTE plants\u2019 cleaner technology and integrated waste management approach as well as their \nenvironmental and financial sustainability.  \n \n \nC.

ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS)  as  follows:  environment \n(category B), involuntary resettlement (category B), and indigenous peoples (category C).14 ADB \nhas undertaken due diligence with the Lender\u2019s Technical Advisor (LTA), and reviewed the \npotential environmental and social impacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, \nmitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n36.  In relation to environmental impact, the LTA and an independent technical expert on WTE \nconducted a technical study of the incineration and pollution control technologies deployed by \nSUS in its WTE projects and benchmarked them against the WTE industry in the PRC and \nglobally. The technical study found that, the technologies for waste incineration and best available \ntechniques for pollution control, as deployed by SUS in its WTE projects, will not result in \nirreversible, diverse or unprecedented environmental impacts and health risks during construction \nand operation. The environmental impacts associated with WTE construction are expected to be \nsite-specific,  temporary  and  can  be  mitigated  through  good  construction  practices.  The \ntechnologies and industry practices available to mitigate and manage the environmental impacts \nof SUS\u2019s WTE projects, such as continuously monitored incinerator performance parameters and \nair  pollution  control  equipment,  are  mature and  proven  to  be  effective. The  due  diligence \ndetermined  that  the  technologies  deployed  by  SUS  in  its  WTE  subprojects  meet  good \n                                                \n14 ADB.

The project is categorized as B for involuntary resettlement impact as land acquisition \nimpact is expected to be insignificant. The WTE facilities will likely be located within EIPs, which \nare typically in a designated area of the urban master plan. SUS\u2019s enhanced ESMS will include \narrangements for SUS to commission experts to undertake a social compliance audit for each \nWTE subproject that will be funded by ADB. SUS will submit the social compliance audit and \ncorrective action plan to ADB prior to the disbursement request for such subproject. Where WTE \nfacilities to be financed by ADB will be constructed outside of EIPs, they will be screened for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  and  those  subprojects  categorized  as  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement will be excluded from ADB financing. The proposed project is categorized as C for \nindigenous peoples as WTE plants will likely be located within EIPs in second or third tier cities in \nthe PRC and impact upon indigenous peoples is deemed unlikely. \n \n38.  Corrective actions were identified to ensure compliance with the SPS, including conformity \nwith good international industry practice such as the World Bank Group's Environmental, Health \nand Safety Guidelines and the relevant emission criteria set out in the EU Industrial Emissions \nDirective 2010/75/EU.15 Procedures for ADB review and disclosure of safeguards and social \ndocuments for new subprojects will be outlined in the enhanced ESMS. The enhanced ESMS will \nbe adopted by SUS before ADB\u2019s first disbursement. Environmental and social due diligence and \nsafeguards reports, and plans prepared for the first subproject utilizing ADB\u2019s funds, will be \nsubmitted for ADB\u2019s review as a condition precedent to disbursement for the first subproject. SUS \nwill report to ADB on an annual basis on the ongoing compliance with the enhanced ESMS and \nSPS. While subprojects are expected to be Category B for environment, should a subproject be \ncategorized as environment Category A, SPS requirements for Category A projects will be \napplied. \n \n39.
