Appropriately  managed,  waste  can \nbe  a  source  of  energy  while  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  mitigated.  To  evaluate  this \npotential, during the 2002 Country Programming Mission the Government requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to include in the Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2003\u20132005 an \nadvisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  on  gas  generation  from  waste.  From  29  September  to  3 \nOctober 2003, therefore, ADB fielded a Fact-Finding Mission to prepare the TA paper on Gas \nGeneration  from  Waste  Project.1  The  Mission  and  Government  reached  an  understanding  on \nthe  goals,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of \nreference  for  the  TA.2    The  TA  logical  framework  is  in  Appendix  1,  and  an  initial  poverty  and \nsocial analysis in Appendix 2. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nISSUES \n\n2. \nGrowth  and  development  in  any  economy  often  give  rise  to  waste  disposal  and \nmanagement problems. In Indonesia, acceleration of urban settlement and industrial growth has \nalso resulted in production of solid and liquid wastes that contaminate the soil and groundwater, \nand  in  emissions  of  harmful  gases.  The  uncontrolled  decomposition  of  organic  waste  under \nanaerobic  conditions  produces  methane,  a  powerful  greenhouse  gas  causing  global  warming. \nHowever, methane from waste can be captured to provide a renewable source of energy and, in \nthe  process,  help  abate  the  enhanced  greenhouse  effect.  Other  waste  products  can  also  be \nused in an environmentally benign manner to generate energy and other useful material such as \nfertilizers.  The  World  Bank  has  an  adaptable  loan  program3  in  Indonesia  to  manage  urban \nwaste and convert it to compost. Yet, waste from important agro-industries in remote and rural \nsettings\u2014the  palm  oil  industry,  for  example\u2014contributes  to  local  and  global  environmental \npollution, and is not covered by the World Bank program.  \n \n3. \nIndonesia  is  the  second  largest  producer,  after  Malaysia,  of  palm  oil  in  the  world.  In \nIndonesia over 3 million hectares are under palm oil plantations, which provide inputs to a large \nnumber of palm oil mills (POMs). It is estimated that there are nearly 300 mills, of which 240 are \nin Sumatra and 40 in Kalimantan. New POMs are being planned to meet the shortage of milling \ncapacity and rising production of palm oil. The Indonesia palm oil industry produces over 4,000 \nmillion tons (t) of palm oil, providing over $1 billion in export earnings,4 and directly and indirectly \nproviding livelihood to a large number of rural people.  \n \n4. \nPOMs  produce  significant  amounts  of  biomass  waste  and  generate  large  quantities  of \nwastewater.  Now,  wastewater  from  POMs  is  discarded  in  waste  disposal  ponds,  resulting  in \nleaching of contaminants that pollute the groundwater and soil, and in the release of methane \ngas.  Almost  all  POM  waste  can  be  processed  to  produce  energy  and  fertilizer.  Processing \nincludes  capture  of  methane,  which  is  a  potential  source  of  clean  and  renewable  energy  for \nremote locations. Wastewater has some crude palm oil that can be recovered to produce bio-\ndiesel. Solid waste from POMs, in the form of fresh fruit bunches, can be converted to energy or \n\n                                                 \n1   The Mission comprised S. Gupta, project economist (energy), Southeast Asia Infrastructure Division.  \n2   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 September 2003. \n3   World Bank. 2001.

Given  the  economic  importance  of  this  agro-industry,  it  is  imperative  to  minimize \nadverse environmental impacts and for the industry to operate on a sustainable basis. \n \n5. \nThe national energy policy aims to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by developing and \nusing  indigenous  new  and  renewable  energy  resources.  Biomass  is  a  renewable  source  of \nenergy that is often used inefficiently. If used efficiently, biomass could provide more energy to \nremote, rural areas. Solid biomass waste and liquid waste from POMs can be transformed into \nelectricity, gas, bio-diesel, and fertilizer, improving use efficiency and substituting fossil fuels. \n \n6. \nPublic  and  private  POMs  lack  knowledge  and  access  to  suitable  waste  management, \nfertilizer  production,  bio-diesel  conversion,  and  methane-capture  technologies.  POMs  could \nmeet  all  their  energy  requirements  and  produce  surplus  energy.  Despite  being  in  energy-\ndeficient areas, this surplus energy is wasted due to limited opportunities to market it. One POM \nwith the capacity to process 60 tons of fresh fruit bunches per hour could produce 11,400 cubic \nmeters of methane per day from wastewater, and provide over 1.5 megawatts of electricity. Oil \npalm  fruits  are  harvested  through  out  the  year,  with  peak  production  from  July  to  December, \npotentially ensuring year-round processing and availability of energy. \n \n7. \nIntegrated waste management will enable POMs\u2019 sustainable operation and provide the \nfollowing multifaceted benefits that help improve the quality of life in distant, and often isolated, \nlocations: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nMitigate  contamination  of  soil  and  groundwater  resulting  from  uncontrolled \ndisposal of POM solid and liquid waste. \nProvide a clean, renewable, and local source of energy to remote areas. \nProduce organic fertilizers to enhance land productivity. \nReduce  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  and  contribute  to  global  environmental \nbenefits. \n\nA  debate  is  ongoing  over  the  proliferation  of  palm  oil  plantations,  which  results  in \n\n \n8. \ndeforestation. However, the issue is beyond the scope of this TA.  \n \nThe 2003\u20132005 Country Strategy and Program addresses the main medium-term needs \n9. \nof  the  economy,  stressing  (i)  improvements  in  governance,  (ii)  meeting  local  needs  through \ndecentralization, (iii) human development, (iv) environmental management and sustainable use \nof natural resources, and (v) raising long-term growth prospects and economic potential. The TA \nthus  contributes  directly  to  effective  environmental  management  and  sustainable  natural \nresource use as well as indirectly helps meet local needs. The TA will promote the use of clean \nand renewable energy, improve access of remote and rural populations to efficient and modern \nforms  of  energy,  and  enable  environmentally  sustainable  operation  of  an  important  agro-\nindustry. The interventions examined and developed under the TA will encourage public-private \npartnerships and provide simultaneous global and local environmental benefits. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nPurpose and Output \n\nThe goal of the TA is to support sustainable development. The purpose of the TA is to (i) \n10. \nimprove  integrated  waste  management  practices  in  the  palm  oil  industry  and  (ii)  evaluate  the \npotential  of  POM  waste  as  a  renewable  and  commercially  viable  source  of  clean  energy.  The \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nTA will (i) establish a waste management framework for the industry, (ii) conduct a technical and \neconomic  assessment  of  different  alternatives  for  energy  recovery  and  conversion  from  POM \nwaste, (iii) develop a sustainable plan for effective waste management and energy capture for a \ncluster of public and private sector POMs, (iv) evaluate the potential social and environmental \nbenefits  of  improved  waste  management  practices,  and  (v)  assess  the  need  for  further  ADB \nsupport for energy generation from waste. \n \n11. \nThe deliverables from the TA include (i) review of solid waste management practices in \nthe palm oil sector; (ii) assessment of technologies available for waste management in POMs, \nincluding  those  for  collection  and  use  of  methane  gas  from  wastewater;  (iii)  identification  of  a \nprocess  to  facilitate  transfer  of  such  technologies;  (iv)  development  of  methane  recovery  and \nuse  from  POM  effluent  as  potential  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  projects;  (v) \nconversion and transmission options for surplus energy from a  POM cluster and evaluation of \ntheir viability; and (vi) implementation plan to market surplus energy produced from POM waste. \nDeliverables (v) and (vi) would include preparing a feasibility report on recovering energy from \nPOM  waste  for  a  cluster  of  POM,  including  an  evaluation  of  the  options  to  directly  feed \nrecovered methane into the local gas network, generate electricity for local consumption and/or \nwheel electricity to the grid, or develop a local network to distribute electricity. The TA will also \nassess  the  impact  of  suggested  interventions  on  the  local  population,  including  indigenous \npeople.  \n \nB. \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\n12. \nTo  achieve  the  TA  objectives,  the  consultants  will  review  national  and  international \nwaste  management  practices  in  the  palm  oil  industry.  Based  on  the  quantity  of  biomass  and \nliquid waste generated by POMs, the TA will undertake a technical and economic evaluation of \ninterventions to minimize adverse environmental impacts and to harness energy from all types \nof waste. The options evaluated will include technologies to convert energy, such as production \nof electricity from biomass waste and methane gas or production of bio-diesel from crude palm \noil  in  wastewater.  The  evaluations  will  provide  the  basis  to  develop  guidelines  for  waste \nmanagement.  \n \nThe TA will identify a cluster of POMs that could generate sufficient quantities of energy \n13. \n(electricity or gas) from waste, and design systems for in situ and/or local energy use. If surplus \nenergy potential is significant, the TA will propose common off-take systems for the cluster. As \nPOMs are a mix of private, community-managed, and state-owned entities, a model for public-\nprivate  partnership  in  waste  management  and  energy  use  for  POMs,  and  a  plan  to \ncommercialize surplus energy will be prepared. A feasibility study for the interventions, including \na financial and economic analysis, will be undertaken. The TA will require the involvement and \ncooperation  of \nlocal  subsidiaries  of \nconventional  energy  suppliers  such  as  the  state  electricity  enterprise  (PLN)  and  state  gas \ncorporation (PGN).  An important TA component will be the environmental and social analysis, \nand assessment of impact on indigenous people, if any, of the proposed interventions.  \n \nThe  TA  will  also  help  identify  the  greenhouse  gas  abatement  potential  of  emissions \n14. \ncapture  and  energy  generation \ninterventions,  and  determine  availability  of  additional \ninternational  resources  under  various  greenhouse  gas  mitigation  initiatives  such  as  CDM. \nDetailed terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n\nindigenous  people,  POMs,  and \n\nlocal  authorities, \n\n\f4 \n\nC. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n15. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $625,000  equivalent,  comprising  $347,000  in \nforeign exchange costs and $278,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost, and \n$153,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. Financing for the TA will comprise $250,000 on \na grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program and cofinancing of $250,000 on a grant basis to \nbe administered by ADB from the Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate Change financed by \nthe Government of Canada. The Government of Indonesia will finance the remaining $125,000 \nequivalent of the local currency costs. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n  \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n16. \nAs  the  TA  Executing  Agency,  the  Directorate  General  of  Electricity  and  Energy \nUtilization  (DGEEU)  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  TA  management.  PGN  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agency.  A  steering  committee  will  be  set  up  to  review  and  advise  on  TA \nimplementation. The committee will be chaired by DGEEU, and consist of representatives from \nthe  Ministry  of  Environment,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  the  state-owned  palm  oil  plantation \ncorporation,  PLN  or  other  relevant  power  transmission  and  distribution  companies,  research \ninstitutes,  universities,  and  associations  of  concerned  stakeholders.  The  PGN  development \ndirector will be the project director, responsible for TA implementation. \n  \n17. \nThe TA will be carried out in 9 months, from September 2004 to May 2005. A consulting \nfirm  with  expertise  in  policy  analysis  and  formulation,  economic  analysis,  and  energy  from \nwaste  will  be  engaged  to  undertake  the  major  TA  components.  Domestic  consultants  or \nresource  persons  will  also  be  engaged  separately  as  individuals  for  approximately  5  person-\nmonths.  Total  consulting  services  will  include  10  person-months  of  international  expertise  in \neconomic and financial analysis and in energy conversion technologies; and 20 person-months \nof  domestic  expertise  in  social,  economic,  and  environmental  impact  assessment;  anaerobic \ntechnologies; and energy conversion and distribution. All consultants will be engaged by ADB \nin  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Simplified technical proposals \nwill  be  evaluated  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  for  the  consulting  firm. \nThe  consultants  will  work  closely  with  DGEEU,  and  PGN.  Equipment  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement, and retained by the Executing Agency upon \nTA  completion.  The  study  findings  will  be  disseminated  to  and  discussed  with  concerned \nstakeholders through workshops and seminars. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n\n18. \nThe President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate Change, and (ii) ADB \nproviding  the  balance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $250,000  on  a  grant  basis,  to  the \nGovernment of Indonesia for the Gas Generation from Waste Project, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n \n \n\n\fTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n5 \n\n \nMonitoring \nMechanisms \n \n\n \nAssumptions \nand Risks \n \n\n \n\u2022  Government statistics \n\u2022  Government policy \n\n \n \n\nstatements  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \nDesign Summary \n\nGoal \n \nSupport sustainable \ndevelopment in Indonesia \n \n\nPurpose \n \n1.

Biomass is a renewable energy source \nthat  is  often  used  inefficiently.  If  used  more  efficiently,  biomass  could  meet  the  energy \nrequirements  of  remote,  rural  areas.  Over  3  million  hectares  are  under  palm  oil  plantations, \nwhich  provide  inputs  to  a  large  number  of  palm  oil  mills  (POMs),  a  significant  proportion  of \nwhich are community-managed. POMs produce solid and liquid waste that can be transformed \ninto  electricity,  gas,  bio-diesel,  and  fertilizer,  substituting  the  use  of  fossil  fuels.  Methane,  a \npowerful greenhouse gas, could be used to meet energy requirements. \n \n2. \nconsultants will do the following: \n \n\nTo  meet  the  objectives  set  in  this  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  document,  a  team  of \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nReview international experience for waste management in the POMs. \nReview and develop guidelines for waste management in the palm oil industry. \nDetermine the quantity of biomass waste and liquid waste generated by POMs. \nIdentify  the  size  and  distribution  of  POMs  and  select  a  cluster  to  implement  a \nsystem to use energy from waste. \nDetermine techniques for use of solid and liquid waste from POMs. \nDetermine  technologies  for  energy  capture  from  solid  and  liquid  POM  waste, \nincluding anaerobic methane from POM wastewater. \nEvaluate  specific  interventions  for  integrated  waste  management  and  energy \nproduction from POM waste. \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Evaluate the techno-economic potential for energy production from POM waste, \nincluding bio-diesel from crude palm oil and liquid waste, and its subsequent use. \nFor  technological  interventions  that  produce  significant  quantities  of  energy, \ndetermine systems for in situ and local use of energy from waste. \nUndertake  a  feasibility  study  for  the  interventions,  including  a  financial  and \neconomic analysis. \nDetermine  a  model  for  public-private  partnership  in  waste  management  and \nenergy  use  for  POMs  and  develop  an  action  plan  to  commercialize  the  use  of \nenergy from POMs. \nIdentify the greenhouse gas abatement potential of methane capture and energy-\ngeneration  interventions  and  determine  availability  of  additional  international \nresources under various greenhouse gas mitigation initiatives such as the clean \ndevelopment mechanism (CDM). \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii)  Undertake  an  environmental  and  social  analysis  and  determine  the  impact  on \n\nindigenous people, if any. \n\n \n3. \nThe  Directorate  General  of  Electricity  and  Energy  Utilization  (DGEEU)  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency,  with  State  Gas  Corporation  (PGN)  as  the  Implementing  Agency.

Appropriately  managed,  waste  can \nbe  a  source  of  energy  while  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  mitigated.  To  evaluate  this \npotential, during the 2002 Country Programming Mission the Government requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to include in the Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2003\u20132005 an \nadvisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  on  gas  generation  from  waste.  From  29  September  to  3 \nOctober 2003, therefore, ADB fielded a Fact-Finding Mission to prepare the TA paper on Gas \nGeneration  from  Waste  Project.1  The  Mission  and  Government  reached  an  understanding  on \nthe  goals,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of \nreference  for  the  TA.2    The  TA  logical  framework  is  in  Appendix  1,  and  an  initial  poverty  and \nsocial analysis in Appendix 2. \n \n \n", "II. \n", "ISSUES \n", "2. \nGrowth  and  development  in  any  economy  often  give  rise  to  waste  disposal  and \nmanagement problems. In Indonesia, acceleration of urban settlement and industrial growth has \nalso resulted in production of solid and liquid wastes that contaminate the soil and groundwater, \nand  in  emissions  of  harmful  gases.  The  uncontrolled  decomposition  of  organic  waste  under \nanaerobic  conditions  produces  methane,  a  powerful  greenhouse  gas  causing  global  warming. \nHowever, methane from waste can be captured to provide a renewable source of energy and, in \nthe  process,  help  abate  the  enhanced  greenhouse  effect.  Other  waste  products  can  also  be \nused in an environmentally benign manner to generate energy and other useful material such as \nfertilizers.  The  World  Bank  has  an  adaptable  loan  program3  in  Indonesia  to  manage  urban \nwaste and convert it to compost. Yet, waste from important agro-industries in remote and rural \nsettings\u2014the  palm  oil  industry,  for  example\u2014contributes  to  local  and  global  environmental \npollution, and is not covered by the World Bank program.  \n \n3. \nIndonesia  is  the  second  largest  producer,  after  Malaysia,  of  palm  oil  in  the  world.  In \nIndonesia over 3 million hectares are under palm oil plantations, which provide inputs to a large \nnumber of palm oil mills (POMs). It is estimated that there are nearly 300 mills, of which 240 are \nin Sumatra and 40 in Kalimantan. New POMs are being planned to meet the shortage of milling \ncapacity and rising production of palm oil. The Indonesia palm oil industry produces over 4,000 \nmillion tons (t) of palm oil, providing over $1 billion in export earnings,4 and directly and indirectly \nproviding livelihood to a large number of rural people.  \n \n4. \nPOMs  produce  significant  amounts  of  biomass  waste  and  generate  large  quantities  of \nwastewater.  Now,  wastewater  from  POMs  is  discarded  in  waste  disposal  ponds,  resulting  in \nleaching of contaminants that pollute the groundwater and soil, and in the release of methane \ngas.  Almost  all  POM  waste  can  be  processed  to  produce  energy  and  fertilizer.  Processing \nincludes  capture  of  methane,  which  is  a  potential  source  of  clean  and  renewable  energy  for \nremote locations. Wastewater has some crude palm oil that can be recovered to produce bio-\ndiesel. Solid waste from POMs, in the form of fresh fruit bunches, can be converted to energy or \n", "                                                 \n1   The Mission comprised S.
