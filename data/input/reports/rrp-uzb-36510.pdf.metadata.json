The  Project  will  involve  minor  repairs  to  school  libraries \nwith no negative implications on the environment. \n \nThe  Second  Textbook  Development  Project  will  build  on  past  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to  continue  to  address  the \navailability  and  affordability  of  textbooks  in  basic  education.  The \nProject  will  extend  the  textbook  rental  scheme  (TRS)  established \nunder the Basic Education Textbook Development Project (BETDP) to \ngrades 6, 7, and 8. This will complete TRS coverage of all grades and \nall  schools  in  the  country.  The  Project  will  also  establish  appropriate \nfor  ensuring  sustainable  provision  of \ninstitutional  arrangements \naffordable textbooks.  \n \nThe  Project  will  address  other  key  issues  in  textbook  and  learning \nmaterials development, including reforming the national curriculum and \nencouraging  private  sector  growth  in  publishing  and  printing.  To \nsupport new approaches to learning, school libraries will be developed \non a pilot basis as resource centers, with provision of books and other \nfurniture,  equipment,  and \nlearning/teaching  materials,  adequate \ncomputers.  \n \nGiven  the  dominant  role  of  textbooks  in  education  in  Uzbekistan, \nsustainable  provision  of  affordable  textbooks  is  key  to  improving  the \nquality  and  relevance  of  basic  education.  The  Government  has \nrecently  strengthened  the  focus  on  basic  education  as  the  basis  for \ndevelopment,  and  is  giving  the  Project  a  high  priority  to  support  its \nNational Program for School Education Development 2004\u20132009. \n \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  basic  education. \nThe  purpose  is  to  establish  efficient  and  sustainable  nationwide \nprovision  of  affordable  textbooks,  and  other  instructional  materials, \nsupported by necessary institutional and policy reforms.  \n \n\nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjective \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Project  comprises  four  components:  (i)  strengthening  the  basic \neducation  policy  framework  by  reforming  the  curriculum,  modernizing \ntesting  and  assessment  systems,  and  conducting  related  research \nstudies;  (ii)  ensuring  the  sustainable  provision  of  textbooks  by \nsupplying  affordable  textbooks  nationwide  and  strengthening  the \ninstitutional  basis  of  the  TRS;  (iii)  developing  the  book  publishing \nsector  by  encouraging  authors,  improving  implementation  of  the \nCopyright Law, and promoting private sector participation in publishing \nand printing; and (iv) developing school libraries in 1,000 pilot schools \nby  providing  adequate  space,  furniture,  books  and  other  instructional \nmaterials, audiovisual equipment, and computers. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $55.0  million  equivalent, \nincluding  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and \ninterest  and  other  charges.  Of  the  total  cost,  $23.8  million  (43%) \ncomprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $31.2  million  equivalent \n(57%) the local currency cost.  \n \n\nPercent \n\n($ million) \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nForeign \nExchange\n23.8 \n0.0 \n23.8 \n\nTotal \nCost \n25.0 \n30.0 \n55.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n55 \n100 \n\n1.2 \n30.0 \n31.2 \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n         Total \n \nA loan of $25 million equivalent from the ordinary capital resources of \nADB  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.

The  PSC  will  meet  quarterly  to  review \nproject implementation status, discuss implementation issues, provide \nbroad  guidance,  ensure  coordination  among  different  agencies, \nresolve  issues,  and  review  and  advise  on  the  annual  implementation \nplan.  MOPE  will  appoint  a  deputy  minister  as  project  director.  The \nproject  director  will  provide  general  guidance \nthe  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  in  accordance  with  decisions  made  by  the \nPSC; arrange the quarterly meetings of, and present quarterly reports \nto  the  PSC;  and  ensure  coordination  of  project  implementation  within \nMOPE. The project director will be responsible for MOPE policy inputs.   \n \nA project manager will be recruited to report to the project director and \nbe  responsible  for  coordinating  and  supervising  the  work  of  the  PIU.  \nThe PIU, which will comprise the project manager and 6 staff, will be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation,  including  financial \nmanagement.    Core  staff  of  the  BETDP  PIU  will  be  retained  as  they \nhave  extensive  relevant  experience  and  a  good  track  record  in \nsuccessfully implementing the BETDP. \n \nThe Project will procure textbooks and related materials for grades 6, \n7,  and  8;  furniture  and  audiovisual  equipment;  library  books  and \nmaterials;  and  information  and  technology  equipment  for  school \nlibraries; and furniture and computers for office and administrative use. \nADB  loan-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Selected  supply  contracts  for \nfurniture,  equipment, \nlibrary  books,  and  supporting \ninstructional  materials  may  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local \ncompetitive  bidding  acceptable  to  ADB.

Rehabilitation  work  will  involve  no \nresettlement or negative environmental impact. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  937  person-months  of  consulting  services, \nconsisting  of  61  person-months  of  international  and  876  person-\nmonths of domestic consulting. Because of the highly integrated nature \nof  the  project  components,  international  consultants  will  be  engaged \nthrough  a  firm  using  quality  and  cost-based  selection  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants.  Domestic \nconsultants  with  relevant  expertise  in  areas  including  curriculum \nreform,  assessment  and  testing,  and  language  of  instruction  will  be \nselected using selection procedures satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\nlibraries  will  be \n\ntextbooks, \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n \n\n \n\nDirect  benefits  of  the  Project  will  include  the  sustainable  provision  of \naffordable textbooks nationwide. This will have a significant impact on \nensuring quality of basic education. The curriculum reform assisted by \na  modernized  assessment  and  testing  system  will  generate  quality \nimprovements  in  education,  and  enhance  the  cost-effectiveness  of \nbasic  education.  The  latter  will  be  strengthened  by  an  increase  in \ncompetition  and  private  sector  participation \nin  book  sector \ndevelopment.  The  pilot  school  library  improvement  will  introduce  new \nmaterials  and  an  environment  to  support  and  enhance  student-\ncentered learning in 10% of all schools. Six million students nationwide \nin  grades  2\u20139  will  be  the  main  beneficiaries.  These  include  (i)  those \nfrom  the  poorest  families  (15%  of  the  total)  who  will  be  supplied  with \nfree textbooks by the Government with improved targeting, and (ii) 0.4 \nmillion  students  in  minority  language  schools.  Over  160,000  teachers \nand  1,200  librarians  and  specialists  will  benefit  from  new  teacher \nguides,  new  books,  and  in-service  training.  In  addition,  a  number  of \nspecialists  in  curriculum,  various  areas  of  educational  policy,  and \npublishing and printing will receive relevant training. \n \nThe Project faces three main risks. First, a reversal or slowdown of the \nsector reform could have an adverse impact on the Project. To mitigate \nthis  risk,  ADB  will  continue  to  engage  the  Government  in  and  assist \nwith  sector \nfinancial \nreform  and  management.  Second, \nsustainability of the TRS will depend on (i) maintaining a collection rate \nsufficient  for  replacing  textbooks  at  regular  intervals;  and  (ii)  proper \nmanagement of the accumulated rental fees. \n \nThe  republican  textbook  revolving  fund  foundation  will  be  established \nspecifically to address this risk by providing professional management \nof  the  rental  fees  accumulated  under  the  TRS,  and  systematic \nsupervision and monitoring at central, oblast, raion, and school levels. \nRetention  of  the  experienced  PIU  from  the  BETDP  to  operate  as  the \nPIU  for  the  Project  will  contribute  significantly  to  mitigating  this  risk. \nrequires  significant \nThird,  successful  project \ninstitutional  capacity  of \nto  ensure  effective \ncoordination with central agencies and at different government levels. \nThis risk will be mitigated by (i) building on the experience at all levels \nof  government,  including  the  PIU,  gained  from  implementation  of  the \nBETDP; (ii) improving coordination and monitoring ability as a result of \nADB\u2019s past assistance, including the education monitoring unit set up \nat the Cabinet of Ministers; (iii) enhancing efficiency resulting from the \nGovernment\u2019s  implementation  of  the  National  Program  for  School \nEducation  Development  2004\u20132009;  and  (iv)  continuing  efforts  at \nMOPE  to  build  mechanisms  for  better  coordination  between  the \nProject and the ADB-funded Education Sector Development Program. \n\nimplementation \nthe  Government \n\nthe \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nv\n\ni\ni\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Second Textbook Development Project. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nAccording to Uzbekistan\u2019s Constitution, every citizen is entitled to basic education, which \nis  provided  by  the  public  sector.  The  Government  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to address key constraints in basic education development, including \nthe  sustainable  provision  of  affordable  textbooks  and  other  learning  materials,  curriculum \nreform, and school library development. The Project is designed to address these issues. The \nproject framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nBasic  education  in  Uzbekistan  starts  at  age  6  and  comprises  grades  1  to  9.  Senior \nsecondary education continues from grades 10 to 12 and will be compulsory from 2010. Higher \neducation consists of a 4-year bachelor of arts program followed by a 2-year masters program \nand  then  a  doctoral  program.  Basic  information  on  the  education  system  and  structure  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nIn 2003/04, of the 9,727 basic secondary schools, 2,006 (20.6%) were urban. This figure \n4. \nhas  been  stable  for  the  past  10  years.  Of  the  6.3  million  students  enrolled,  40.1%  were  in \ngrades  1\u20134.  The  annual  enrolment  growth  rate  has  averaged  around  2.5%  per  year  over  the \npast  6  years,  mainly  reflecting  continued  recovery  from  the  decline  during  the  early  transition \nyears. In urban areas, net primary enrolment rates fell from 90.1% in 1990 to 87.8% in 1998; in \nrural  areas  the  rates  fell  from  85.6%  to  84.9%.  The  rates  are  currently  estimated  at  98%. \nHowever, the level of attendance is a problem especially in poor regions, although reliable data \nis not available. The cost and relevance of education may be among factors that affect school \nattendance.  The  primary  completion  rate  is  estimated  to  be  high.  The  ratio  of  boys  to  girls  in \nbasic education is virtually 1:1, and 99.3% of the population is literate, with no significant gender \ndifferential in basic education.1 \n \nEducation expenditure as a percentage of total budgets increased from 22.4% in 1997 to \n5. \n38% in 2003.2 Of particular note, public expenditure on clothing, textbooks, and other learning \nmaterials for grade 1 and poor and vulnerable students increased in real terms by around 150% \nbetween  1997  and  2002.  The  National  Program  for  School  Education  Development  (NPSED) \n2004\u20132009 was announced in June 2004 and envisages significant increases in investment in \nbasic  education,  as  compared  with  the  emphasis  on  strengthening  senior  secondary  and \nvocational education over the past few years.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Gender  differentials  begin  to  appear  in  senior  secondary  education  and  are  more  marked  in  higher  education  in \n\nterms of enrolment levels and choice of courses.  \n\n2  Public expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product increased from 7.3% in 1997 to an estimated 10% in \n\n2003/04. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nNotwithstanding the progress already made since the late 1990s, formidable challenges \nremain  for  the  Government  to  realize  its  long-term  goal  of  making  the  education  system \nconsistent  with  a  market-oriented  economy  and  a  democratic  society  in  the  21st  century.  In \nbasic education, the challenge is to improve quality and relevance, where textbooks play a key \nrole  in  determining  student  performance.  ADB  approved  the  Basic  Education  Textbook \nDevelopment Project (BETDP)3 in 1997 and has been initially successful in supporting textbook \ndevelopment  and  provision.  A  basic  education  subsector  analysis  with  a  problem  tree  is  in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n\n1. \n\nBasic Education and Textbook Subsector Issues \n\n7. \nTextbooks  and  Curriculum.  In  Uzbekistan  textbooks  are  almost  the  only  form  of \nteaching and learning support provided for both students and teaching staff. Therefore they are \na key material input in influencing quality and relevance of basic education. In 1998, as a result \nof  growing  financial  constraints,  the  Government  terminated  the  policy  of  free  provision  of \ntextbooks.  While  most  parents  found  textbooks  at  full  price  unaffordable,  suppliers  also \nstruggled  with  uncertainty  of  demand  and  credit.  By  2000,  serious  textbook  shortages  were \nbeing  experienced  in  many  schools.  In  2001,  the  BETDP  successfully  introduced  a  pilot \ntextbook  rental  scheme  (TRS).  The  TRS  effectively  addressed  the  affordability  issue  by \nreducing parental expenditure on textbooks to an annual rental fee. The fee was approximately \n5  times  cheaper  than  the  total  purchase  price  of  a  set  of  textbooks.  Schools  and  parents \nstrongly  supported  the  TRS  pilot,  which  achieved  a  collection  rate  of  93%.  As  a  result  of  this \nsuccess, the TRS was extended nationwide to cover grades 2\u20135 and 9.  \n \n8. \nNational  coverage  of  the  TRS  to  include  affordable  core  textbooks  and  teacher  guides \nfor all grades of basic education, except grade 1, is now needed.4 In addition, the institutional \nbasis of the TRS needs to be placed on a sound footing so that the accumulated rental fees are \nprofessionally  managed  to  ensure  sustainability  of  textbook  and  teacher-guide  provision.  By \n2007,  centralized  funding  of  core  textbooks  and  teacher  guides  will  cease  and  textbook \nreplacement  supplies  will  be  funded  from  the  rental  fee  balances  accumulated  in  school  bank \naccounts.  The  transition  from  centralized  to  decentralized  funding  and  from  central  to  school-\nbased decision-making will require careful planning and management. National monitoring and \nsupervision  of  the  TRS  within  the  Ministry  of  Public  Education  (MOPE)  also  needs  to  be \nimproved  and  institutionalized.  At  present,  the  Government  provides  support  for  the  socially \nunprotected\u2014approximately  15%  of  the  student  population.  This  support  is  in  the  form  of  free \ntextbooks  and  teacher  guides  provided  to  school  libraries  with  schools  in  rich  and  poor  areas \nreceiving a similar proportion of free books. Targeting the poor must also be improved.  \n \nCurriculum and learning materials are closely connected. Curriculum design determines \n9. \nthe  content,  sequencing,  methodology,  and  presentation  of  information  in  textbooks,  and \ntherefore  has  a  direct  bearing  on  the  nature  and  quality  of  the  education  provided.  Although \ncurriculum reform has been in progress since 1991, the Uzbek curriculum remains overloaded \nwith too many subjects and an undue emphasis on rote learning rather than on developing key \nskills. The overloaded curriculum reinforces didactic, teacher-centered classroom approaches at \nthe expense of student-centered learning (SCL) because teachers must rush through classes to \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  1997.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Basic Education Textbook Development Project. Manila. \n\n4   The Government continues to provide free textbooks for grade 1 pupils.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f3 \n\nachieve  the  heavy  content  requirements,  leaving  no  time  for  interactions  with  and  among \nstudents. Such an overloaded curriculum also has high cost implications. Additional savings in \ntextbook  supply  could  be  achieved  by  reducing  curriculum  textbook  requirements.  Successful \ncurriculum reform will improve the quality and reduce the costs of basic education.  \n \n10. \nA  reformed  assessment  and  testing  system  is  central  to  upgrading  the  quality  of  basic \neducation.  Schools  in  Uzbekistan  rely  on  tests  that  are  made  up  and  graded  by  individual \nteachers.  With  such  a  system,  comparing  student  performance  on  a  national,  oblast,  raion  or \nschool basis, or year-on-year basis is impossible. The reform of existing assessment practices \nmust be synchronized with curriculum reform.  \n \n11. \nThe Uzbek Constitution grants the right to citizens to education in their own languages, \ni.e.,  Russian,  Karakalpak,  Kazakh,  Tajik,  Kyrgyz,  and  Turkmen.  To  maintain  cost  and  quality \nequity between the different language groups, the Government provides subsidies for minority \nlanguage  textbook  publishing.  However,  the  Government  has  had  difficulty  maintaining  the \nnecessary  funding  at  the  required  level,  especially  in  times  of  fiscal  constraints.  A  review  of \nlanguage of instruction (LOI) practices is needed to ensure greater equity and to contribute to \noverall system cost reduction.  \n \n12. \nInformation and communication technology (ICT) development in the school system is a \nstated  priority  of  the  Government.  However,  how  best  to  integrate  ICT  in  the  curriculum  to \nimprove learning and teaching and the investment and recurrent cost implications of enhanced \nICT provision are yet to be fully explored. Current ICT support is short term, with little prospect \nfor sustainability. The need to develop a practical, affordable, and sustainable strategy for ICT \nprovision in basic education is urgent. \n \n13. \nBook  Sector  Development.  Although  textbook  content  is  strongly  influenced  by  the \ncurriculum,  the  quality  and  cost  of  the  final  published  textbooks  depend  on  a  range  of \nfinancial \nspecialized  publishing  and  production  skills,  which \nconceptualization  of  textbooks  and  teacher  guides,  the  identification  of suitable  authors,  copy-\nediting, \nlayout  and  presentation,  pre-press,  and  production.  The \nmanagement  of  these  specialist  skills  is  essential  for  high-quality  textbook  publishing.  While \nsignificant  improvements  in  these  areas  have  been  achieved  under  the  BETDP,  much  more \nwork  is  needed  before  textbook  quality  in  Uzbekistan  reaches  international  standards. \nUnfortunately,  local  capacity  to  support  the  rapid  upgrading  of  professional  educational \npublishing and production remains underdeveloped. With the introduction of skill-based learning \nobjectives and SCL methodologies, new textbooks and other learning materials will need to be \nprofessionally  conceived,  written,  presented,  and  produced.  Thus,  continued  professional \nsupport and capacity building is called for. \n \nOther  sector  constraints  hindering  the  development  and  production  of  high-quality \n14. \ntextbooks include (i) the lack of incentives to attract the best authors to participate in writing a \nnew  generation  of  textbooks,  and  (ii)  the  dominance  of  state-owned  enterprises  in  textbook \npublishing  and  printing.  To  address  the  first  constraint,  effectiveness  of  implementation  of  the \nCopyright Law (1996) should be improved to enhance incentives and remuneration to authors. \nTo  address  the  second  constraint,  administrative  and  procedural  streamlining  is  needed  to \nfacilitate  participation  by  private  publishers  and  printers.  More  broadly,  however,  the  ongoing \nprivatization process should be accelerated with appropriate restructuring, and other measures \nconducive to creating an equitable environment for private sector participation. These measures \nwill  lead  to  increased  competition  in  the  textbook  sector,  which  will  in  turn  improve  textbook \nquality and lower prices.  \n\nillustration,  design, \n\nthe  editorial  and \n\ninclude \n\n\f4 \n\nSchool  Library  Development  and  Supplementary  Materials.  The  dominance  of \n15. \ndidactic, content-heavy textbooks as the main teaching/learning resource in Uzbek schools will \ncreate  difficulties  for  developing  more  student-centered  approaches  to  learning.  The  lack  of \nrelevant,  up-to-date  supplementary  materials,  reference  books,  and  curriculum  support \nmaterials in schools inhibits project work, individual student research, working alone or in small \ngroups, and the development of wider reading around subjects. Any attempt to switch learning \noutcomes  from  factual  recall  to  the  development  of  appropriate  skills  will  require  that  schools \nprovide  opportunities  for  students  to  take  more  responsibility  for  their  own  learning.  The  most \nbasic and cost-effective resource required to support this fundamental switch in learning style is \na well-stocked school library.  \n \n16. \nIn Uzbekistan investment in school libraries has been minimal for many years, and few \nschools have the required resources and facilities to provide the more diverse learning support \nneeded.5 The change to SCL cannot be achieved easily if the only available learning resources \nare  the  textbook  and  the  teacher.  The  situation  is  exacerbated  by  teachers\u2019  limited  access  to \nalternative sources of information. A good school library is as essential for teachers as it is for \nstudents.  MOPE  already  recognizes  the  need  for  alternative  learning materials  to  support  and \ncomplement basic textbooks.  \n \n17. \nIf  learning  styles  are  to  be  changed,  low  cost, user-friendly,  well-stocked,  open  access \nschool libraries need to be developed. Ideally, libraries should offer information to students in a \nvariety of media. Internet access to wider information sources through library-based computers \nis  an  important  component  of  school  library  systems  elsewhere  in  the  world.  Before  a  cost-\neffective ICT strategy for basic education is developed, low-cost compact disk technology could \nbe  used  in  the  short  to  medium  term.  Meanwhile  efforts  should  be  devoted  to  developing \nsuitable educational software in the Uzbek language.  \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Project Rationale \n\n18. \nThe  Project  will  build  on  the  foundation  established  by  the  BETDP.  As  the  first  ADB \nassistance  to  Uzbekistan  in  the  education  sector,  the  BETDP  focused  on  improving  the \navailability, quality, and durability of textbooks and other instructional materials. In particular, the \nTRS  piloted  under  the  BETDP  successfully  addressed  the  urgent  shortage  of  textbooks  that \nwas  threatening  the  quality  of,  and  access  to,  education  after  the  Government  abolished  the \npolicy of providing free textbooks in 1998. The TRS has proven to be an effective mechanism \nfor providing affordable textbooks. A brief account of the experience of the TRS is in Appendix \n4.6  \n \n19. \nProgress made under the BETDP also includes (i) improving physical and presentational \nquality  of  textbooks;  (ii)  revising  syllabi  in  six  subjects;  (iii)  introducing  of  a  new  system  of \nevaluation  and  approval  of  competing  textbooks;  (iv)  strengthening  teachers\u2019  capacity  through \npilot  in-service  training; and  (v)  enhancing  capacity  through  training  in publishing and  printing. \nBy  improving  the  quality,  durability,  and  availability  of  textbooks  and  other  instructional \nmaterials,  and  enhancing  the  efficiency  of  the  textbook  production  system,  such  progress  has \ncontributed significantly to improving the quality of basic education.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5   School  libraries  in  Uzbekistan  are  usually  pedagogically  ill-designed  and  equipped,  with  limited  space,  no  open \naccess, and insufficient and outdated stock (a very high proportion of recorded stock, perhaps more than 90%, is \nold, irrelevant, ideologically outdated, and in Cyrillic). \n\n6   The financial sustainability of the TRS is demonstrated in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f5 \n\nThe Project will consolidate and expand the considerable progress achieved under the \n20. \nBETDP in several key areas. These include the need for (i) affordable textbook provision to be \nextended  to  all  grades  in  all  schools;  (ii)  institutional  strengthening  of  the  TRS  mechanism  to \nensure its long-term sustainability; (iii) a comprehensive curriculum review and reform, including \nreforms  in  examinations  and  assessment,  and  LOI  practices  and  approaches  to  reduce  the \nnumber  of  subjects  and  current  content  requirements  (which  will  not  only  directly  improve  the \nquality  and  relevance  of  education,  but  also  enhance  sector  efficiency  and  sustainability  by \nbringing  substantial  cost  savings  in  textbook  provision);  (iv)  upgrading  school  libraries  into \nlearning resource centers to provide learning and teaching materials that are complementary to \ntextbooks  and  the  continued  curriculum  reform  process,  and  an  environment  that  promotes \nSCL; and (v) regulatory, institutional, and other support to strengthen the capacity of the private \nsector to participate in producing learning materials.  \n \n21. \nThe Project is designed to address these issues in an integrated manner. Full provision \nof  affordable  textbooks  is  a  precondition  for  improving  quality  and  access  to  basic  education, \nwhere improved targeting of existing government subsidies will ensure access of the poor to all \nrequired materials. Continued curriculum reform will lead to fundamental changes in classroom \nteaching and learning methodologies, supported by a new generation of textbooks and teacher \nguides. By reducing the number of subject and content requirements, the curriculum reform will \nreduce  parental  and  government  costs  for  textbooks  and  other  learning  materials.  Such \nefficiency gains will be enhanced by increased competition in the book sector through a greater \nrole  for  the  private  sector.  To  support  and  complement  these  changes,  adequately  stocked \nschool  libraries  as  resource  centers  with  increasing  access  to  ICT  are  particularly  important \nbecause  they  provide  students  and  teachers  with  additional  means,  materials,  and  the \nnecessary environment.  \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernment Strategy and Policy  \n\nSince  independence,  the  Government  has  given  education  a  high  priority  in  its  reform \n22. \nagenda.  This  is  reflected  in  the  close  attention  senior  government  officials  have  paid  to  the \nsector and the consistently high budget allocations. The Government\u2019s strategic objective is to \ntransform the education system into one responsive to the requirements of a market economy \nand democratic society. To this end, the Government has undertaken many reform measures to \naddress  the  challenges  identified  (paras.  7\u201317),  especially  since  the  unveiling  of  the  National \nProgram for Personnel Training in 1998. In basic education, significant achievements include (i) \na marked improvement in efficiency and cost-effectiveness in textbook provision; (ii) continuing \nprogress in curriculum reform that has led to a modest reduction in subjects for some grades; \n(iii)  modernization  and  decentralization  of  the  management  system,  including  authorization  for \nschools  to  raise  and  manage  extrabudgetary  resources,  and  establishment  of  school  boards; \n(iv)  implementation  of  resource  rationalization  measures  with  regard  to  staff  and  other \nresources; and (v) provision of budget support to provide textbooks and clothing to children from \nlow income families.  \n \n23. \nThe NPSED 2004\u20132009 reaffirms the high priority of basic education and redirects focus \nand resources to improve basic education. The NPSED sets the priorities for the reform agenda \nover  the  next  5  years.  They  include  (i)  strengthening  school  infrastructure,  especially  rural \nschools,  for  basic  education;  (ii)  increasing  the  supply  of  textbooks  and  other  instructional \nmaterials,  as  well  as  computers  and  modern  laboratory  equipment;  (iii)  redesigning  and \nimproving education content by revising the present state education standards, curriculum, and \nsyllabi;  (iv)  strengthening  teacher  training  and  quality  especially  in  rural  areas  by  improving \nincentives and in-service training; and (v) encouraging private investment in basic education.  \n\n\f6 \n\n4. \n\nAsian Development Bank Support for the Education Sector  \n\n24. \nA key objective of ADB\u2019s country strategy for Uzbekistan is to reduce the social costs of \ntransition. The education sector is a key focus. ADB\u2019s sector strategy in education follows a two-\npronged approach of (i) supporting sector policy reforms and strengthening the national capacity \nto  manage  sector  reforms,  and  (ii)  supporting  specific  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  and \nrelevance of education. In support of this approach, since 1998 ADB has provided five loans to \nthe education sector, including the BETDP in 1998, the Senior Secondary Education Project7 in \n2000,  and  the  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (ESDP)8  in  2002.  In  basic  education, \nADB\u2019s policy dialogue and assistance have supported the Government in addressing key sector \nissues, including curriculum reform, improving the availability and affordability of textbooks and \nlearning material production, strengthening teacher quality and development, promoting private \nsector participation, and enhancing planning and management capacities in basic education at \nall levels.  \n \n25.  While  the  BETDP  has  laid  the  foundation  for  the  Project,  the  ESDP  also  provides \nimportant  support,  given  its  objectives  to  (i)  strengthen  sector  planning  and  management \ncapacities;  (ii)  improve  and  extend  teacher  education;  and  (iii)  reform  pro-poor  policy  and \nstrengthen community involvement. The ESDP, once fully implemented, will support the Project \nby providing (i) a strong and coherent sector policy framework, (ii) stronger sector institutional \ncapacity  for  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Project,  (iii)  enhanced  teacher  quality \ncomplementary to improved textbooks, and (iv) strengthened decision-making at schools.  \n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Support \n\n26. \nAs  the  lead  provider  of  financial  assistance  in  the  sector,  ADB  has  maintained  close \ncoordination with other funding agencies to ensure complementary and consistent approaches \n(Appendix  5).  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  has  two  pilot  projects \n(totaling $5 million) for improving teacher quality, teaching, equipment including computers, and \ncommunity involvement; and strengthening school management. The United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund (UNICEF) is also piloting similar support to several schools. These projects, while limited \nin  scope  and  geographic  coverage,  complement  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  testing  out  innovative \napproaches  and  methods  to  improve  quality  and  relevance  of  basic  education.  Recently, \nfunding agencies have enhanced coordination for basic education reforms.  \n \n\n6. \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n27.  Weak  Institutional  and  Implementation  Capacity.  The  absorptive  capacity  of \nexecuting  agencies  remains  weak  due  to  their  limited  experience  with  ADB  procedures,  and \ndifficulty  recruiting  and  retaining  project  and  other  professional  staff.  Personnel  with  the \nnecessary skills mix are scarce, and salaries are low. Excessively bureaucratic decision-making \nprocesses,  lack  of  delegation  of  authority  to  project  implementers,  and  deficient  interagency \ncoordination  are  other  features  that  can  cause  delays  in  key  project  implementation  activities \nsuch  as  consultant  recruitment,  procurement  of  goods,  and  disbursements.  The  Project  will \naddress these by (i) retaining the project management and implementation structure, including \nthe  core  group  of  the  BETDP\u2019s  project  implementation  unit (PIU);  and  (ii)  significantly  building \n\n                                                 \n7    ADB.  2000.

A  common  lesson  learned  in  textbook \nprojects by ADB and other development agencies9 is that a systems approach is necessary to \nensure  sustainability  of  development  impacts.  Successful  projects  addressed  not  only  the \ntextbook  issue,  but  incorporated  measures  to  improve  every  stage  in  the  chain  of  textbook \ndevelopment,  including  curriculum,  authorship,  publishing,  printing,  and  distribution.  Based  on \nthe  BETDP\u2019s  experience,  the  Project  will  support  comprehensive  curriculum  reform;  foster \nquality  authorships  for  competing  alternative  textbooks  and  supplementary  materials;  and \nstrengthen  publishing,  printing,  and  distribution \nincluding  encouraging  private  sector \nparticipation.  \n \n29. \nTargeted  Government  Subsidy  under  the  Textbook  Rental  Scheme.  Piloting  of  the \nTRS  under  the  BETDP  and  the  subsequent  nationwide  extension  revealed  that  10\u201315%  of \nstudents cannot afford even the textbook rental fees, although they are several times cheaper \nthan  the  full  textbook  purchase  price.  The  Government  has  a  subsidy  program  in  place  in  the \nform of free textbooks. The Project will develop effective and efficient measures with school and \nparent participation to improve the targeted subsidy and maximize benefits to the poor. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n30. \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  basic  education.  The  purpose  is  to \nestablish  efficient  and  sustainable  nationwide  provision  of  affordable  textbooks,  and  other \ninstructional materials, supported by necessary institutional and policy reforms.  \n  \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n31. \nThe  Project  comprises  four  components:  (i)  strengthening  the  basic  education  policy \nframework,  (ii)  ensuring  the  sustainable  provision  of  textbooks,  (iii)  developing  the  book \npublishing sector, and (iv) developing school libraries.  \n \n\n1. \n\nStrengthening the Basic Education Policy Framework \n\n32. \nThis  component  will  strengthen  the  national  curriculum  for  basic  education.  Curriculum \nreform as an ongoing process has an essential impact on sector efficiency and the sustainability \nof basic education, and provides the basis for long-term enhancement of quality and relevance \nof  basic  education.  This  component  will  also  strengthen  the  national  assessment  and \nexamination  system,  which  is  necessary  to  ensure  quality  in  implementing  educational \nstandards and contents required by a modernized curriculum. A number of research studies will \nbe undertaken, focusing on key educational policy issues, including a national ICT development \nstrategy in education, and LOI practices.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  1996.

World Bank (Operations Policy Program Unit). 1984. \nGeneral Operational Review of Textbooks. Washington DC. \n\n\f8 \n\nOutputs  of  this  component  will  be  (i)  an  improved  national  curriculum  and  syllabi  with \n33. \ncompetency-based  learning  objectives  and  reduced  subject  and  content  requirements;  (ii) \nrevised  assessment  procedures  and  examinations  to  test  the  revised  learning  objectives  and \noutcomes  specified  as  part  of  the  curriculum  reform;  and  (iii)  recommendations  for  a  national \nICT development strategy in education, and review of issues relevant to LOI practices.  \n \n34. \nKey  activities  of  the  component  will  include  (i)  establishing  a  national  curriculum \nframework working group to be charged with the main tasks of this component; (ii) training and \nbuilding  capacity  in  curriculum  reform  and  other  related  policy  areas,  including  international \nstudy tours for working group members to provide direct contact and gain first-hand experience \nwith  international  and  regional  practices;  (iii)  designing  and  conducting  national  and  regional \nresearch studies as part of the policy review process; (iv) developing coherent, time-bound, and \ncosted  options  for  reform  and  clear  implementation  proposals;  and  (v)  implementing \nrecommendations and proposals.  \n \n35. \nThe  national  curriculum  framework  working  group  will  comprise  approximately  40 \nmembers  in  several  subgroups  of  domestic  consultants  not  including  MOPE  staff,  who  will  be \ndrawn from all concerned constituencies, and include practicing, experienced subject specialist \nteachers,  teacher  trainers,  methodologists,  curriculum  specialists,  subject  specialists,  and \nspecialists  on  ICT  development  in  basic  education  and  language  of  instruction.  To  ensure \nquality,  this  group  will  be  appointed  on  a  full-time  basis  for  12\u201321  months  depending  on  the \nsubgroups.  International  consultants  with  expertise  and  experience  in  these  areas  will  provide \nassistance as required. A limited amount of office equipment and administrative support will also \nbe provided to the working group.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEnsuring the Sustainable Provision of Textbooks \n\n36. \nThis component will extend the TRS to grades 6, 7, and 8 to complete the coverage of \nthe  TRS  for  all  core  subjects  at  all  grade  levels  (except  grade  1)  in  all  schools.  It  will  also \ndevelop  and  institutionalize  the  legal  mechanism  necessary  to  ensure  financial  sustainability \nand proper management of the TRS. \n \nOutputs from this component will be (i) textbook supplies on all core subjects for grades \n37. \n6,  7,  and  8  in  all  schools;  (ii)  free  textbook  provision  for  the  poorest  students  through  better \ntargeting  mechanisms;  (iii)  legal  establishment  and  operation  of  the  republican  textbook \nrevolving  fund  foundation  (RTRFF),  as  a  mechanism  to  ensure  long-term  and  sustainable \ntextbook provision; and (iv) decentralized, school-based decision-making on textbook selection \nand related financial and managerial matters.  \n \n38. \n \n\nKey activities will include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nEnsure competitive selection, procurement, and distribution of core textbooks for \ngrades 6, 7, and 8, to complete the full grade level and core subject coverage of \nthe  TRS  established  under  the  BETDP.  Procurement  will  include  13.7  million \ntextbooks  (20  titles)  for  grades  6  and  7  in  2005,  accompanied  by  0.6  million \nteacher guides, and 9.6 million textbooks (14 titles) for grade 8 in 2006 and 0.4 \nmillion teacher guides. \n\nEnsure  annual  provision  from  the  Government  budget  of  textbook  rental  fee \nsupport  to  around  15%  of  enrolled  students  in  the  basic  education  system  who \nare  categorized  as  socially  unprotected  and  cannot  afford  even  the  reduced \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f9 \n\n \n(iii)  \n\n \n(v)  \n\nrental fees. Undertake a study to clearly establish scope, locations, and effective \nmechanisms for better targeting support for the poor.  \n\nEstablish  the  RTRFF  to  assume  responsibility  for  the  proper  and  prudent \nmanagement and timely disbursement of the accumulated rental fees on behalf \nof schools and parents. A board of trustees, including representatives of MOPE, \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance,  schools,  and  parents  will  supervise  the  RTRFF.  The \nRTRFF  will  not  take  its  own  decisions  on  the  use  of  accumulated  school  rental \nfunds,  but  will  ensure  that  the  decisions  taken  by  schools  to  order  new  and \nreplacement  textbooks  are  efficiently  and  properly  executed.  The  establishment \nof RTRFF is described in Appendix 6. \n\n(iv)   Design  and  establish  a  nationwide  system  to  support  school-based  ordering  of \nnew and replacement textbooks when competing alternative textbooks come on \nstream  during  the  course  of  the  Project.  The  system  will  maintain  the  cost-\nreducing benefits of centralized bulk purchase, and support decentralized school-\nbased decision-making. \n\nReview and amend, as required, the existing procedures and documentation for \nthe  competitive  submission,  evaluation,  and  approval  of  textbooks  and  other \nlearning  materials.  This  will  ensure  the  procurement  of  high  quality  books  and \nmaterials  that  are  well-suited  to  the  specified  needs  and  requirements  of  the \nmodernized curriculum learning objectives and the shift to school-based ordering \nunder  the  RTRFF;  and  may  entail  revision  of  minimum  physical  production \nspecifications  (set  under  the  BETDP)  to  achieve  durable  textbooks  within  the \ncapacity of local and regional production facilities. \n\n \n(vi)   Monitor and supervise the TRS to maintain collection rates at the level required \n\nto ensure its long-term financial sustainability.  \n\n3. \n\nDeveloping the Book Publishing Sector \n\n \n\n \n\n This component will continue the process, begun under the BETDP, of upgrading skills \n39. \nin  the  chain  of  textbook  and  learning  material  development  including  authorship,  publishing, \nproduction,  and  distribution.  Specifically,  it  will  provide  financial  and  technical  support  for  the \ndevelopment of short-term, in-service book sector skills training at a selected local educational \ninstitution;  the  goal  is  to  establish  permanent  local  training  capacity  in  the  full  range  of  skills \nrequired  for  book  publishing  and  the  development  of  other  educational  materials.  The \ncomponent will also seek to create conditions for a more active private sector role in the book \nsector,  including  the  improvement  of  incentives  and  remuneration  for  quality  authorship,  and \nequal access to the textbook market by private sector publishers and printers.  \n \n40. \nOutputs  of  this  component  will  be  (i)  a  sustainable  institutional  base  for  continued \nupgrading of professional, commercial, and management skills in book sector development; (ii) \nstrengthened  capacity  in  authorship  and  publishing  through  workshops  and  training;  and  (iii) \nincreased  representation  of  private  publishers  on  the  MOPE-approved  book  lists  and \nprocurement contracts for textbooks and other materials under the Project. \n \nKey  activities  will  include  (i)  establishing  a  permanent  base  for  capacity  building  at  a \n41. \nlocal public educational institution selected by the Government; (ii) developing and conducting \nshort  training  courses  on  the  full  range  of  educational  book  development  skills;  (iii)  reviewing \n\n\f10 \n\npublishing  licensing  procedures  for  textbooks  and  related  regulatory  barriers  to  the  publishing \nindustry, and making recommendations for their improvement; (iv) reviewing current regulations, \npractices, and incentives for educational authors and publishers; and making recommendations \nfor their improvement; and (v) supporting implementation of recommendations approved by the \nGovernment. Policy review and recommendations, and other related advisory work and capacity \nbuilding will be mainly  conducted by locally selected consultants with expertise in these areas \nunder the guidance and assistance of international experts. Limited equipment will be provided \nto the host institution selected for capacity building. \n \n\n4. \n\nDeveloping School Libraries \n\n42. \nThis  component  will  strengthen  and  develop  school  libraries  as  resource  centers  for \nlearning and teaching. Well-equipped and well-stocked school libraries providing study spaces \nfor  approximately  10%  of  school  enrolment  will  be  important  for  upgrading  the  quality  of \neducation in Uzbekistan. They  will provide (i) alternative sources of information, which to date \nhas been dominated by textbooks; (ii) necessary facilities and environment for the development \nof  student  research,  project  work,  and  independent  learning;  and  (iii)  key  methodological \nsupport  for  introducing  and  nurturing  a  more  interactive  SCL  approach.  In  addition,  well-\ndeveloped school libraries contribute significantly to long-term system cost reduction. Given the \nimportance  of  modernized  school  libraries,  the  NPSED  2004\u20132009  has  made  improvement  of \nthe school library system nationwide a priority. \n \n43. \nOutputs  from  this  component  will  be  (i)  national  guidelines  for  school  library  system \nimprovement;  (ii)  1,000  refurbished,  upgraded,  and  well-stocked  school  libraries  (10%  of  the \ntotal);  and  (iii)  improvement  of  skills  through  training  of  1,000  school  librarians  and  200 \noblast/raion specialists. In addition, management and monitoring of textbook use under the TRS \nwill be strengthened in each library. Selected school libraries must (i) include at least 40% from \npoor  and  rural  raions,  with  some  from  minority  language  schools;  and  (ii)  have  strong \ncommitment and support from their local governments and communities. (An outline of selection \ncriteria for working groups and school library development is in Appendix 7).  \n \n44. \nKey  activities  under  this  component  will  include  (i)  developing  national  guidelines  for \nschool  library  systems,  training  materials,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  schemes;  (ii) \nconducting a base-line study of teaching/learning styles and performance in a number of skills \nand aptitudes prior to or shortly after the introduction of modernized school libraries, with follow-\nup studies to be administered every 2 years to measure improvement in learning/teaching styles \nand performance levels over time; (iii) refurbishing, furnishing, and upgrading 1,000 pilot school \nlibraries in accordance with national standards; (iv) providing basic audiovisual equipment to the \nupgraded  school  libraries;  (v)  publishing,  via  competitive  selection,  about  700  specially \ndeveloped school library titles that are well spread among grade levels and subject areas and \ndesigned  to  support  student  reading  and  research  in  accordance  with  modernized  state \neducation  standards,  curriculum,  and  syllabi;  (vi)  developing  software  in  Uzbek  language  via \ngrants awarded on a bidding basis; (vii) training a cadre of library professionals and teachers, \nwho will undertake raion-based training of library methodologists and school librarians; and (viii) \nmonitoring,  supervising  and  evaluating  the  school  library  development.  Local  experts  assisted \nby  international  consultants  will  be  employed  to  review  and  prepare  relevant  national  policies, \nand  to  provide  capacity  building  and  monitor  implementation  in  these  areas.  Furniture, \nequipment  including  ICT  equipment,  and  stocks  of  library  materials  will  be  provided  to  pilot \nschool  libraries.  The  Government  will  fund  and  undertake  minor  rehabilitation  of  selected \nlibraries, where necessary. \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f11 \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n45. \nPro-Poor  Design.  The  Project  will  improve  affordability  and  availability  of  textbooks  to \nthe poor. Under the TRS, about 15% of students cannot afford the rental fees. While the Project \nwill extend the scheme to cover all grades (2\u20139) in all schools, it will also develop measures and \nmechanisms to improve the Government\u2019s subsidy program by improving targeting of the poor. \nThis is envisaged to be implemented through a combination of geographic targeting and more \neffective  delivery  mechanisms  with  participation  of  teacher-parent  councils  and  the  Mahalla \n(local community) system. The Project will also ensure that of the 1,000 schools to be selected \nfor  library  improvement,  at  least  40%  are  in  poor  regions.  (A  recommendation  to  MOPE  on \nimprovement of school libraries is in Supplementary Appendix A.)  \n \nInstitutional Change and Decentralization. The Project will institutionalize the TRS by \n46. \nestablishing the RTRFF. As the apex organization, the RTRFF will take charge of the financial \nand  management  responsibilities  required  to  ensure  sustainable  and  affordable  nationwide \ntextbook  provision  under  the  supervision  of  a  board  including  representatives  of  Government, \nschools, and parents. Nationwide, schools and parents will be accountable for making decisions \nconcerning  textbooks  (particularly  after  competing  alternative  textbooks  come  on  stream)  and \nother  related  educational  and  financial  matters.  By  supporting  a  shift  from  the  current  mainly \ncentralized  and  supply-determined  system  to  decentralized  and  demand-driven  decision-\nmaking, the RTRFF will further the empowerment process begun under the BETDP.  \n \n47. \nCommunity Involvement and Participatory Approach. The Project\u2019s design followed \na participatory approach, with the full participation of all stakeholders including oblast and raion \neducation departments, Hakimyats (local executive branch of the government), school directors, \nteachers,  parents,  and  Mahalla  representatives,  as  well  as  ministries  of  central  Government \n(Supplementary  Appendix  B).  This  took  various  forms  including  participatory  rural  appraisal \ntechniques \nthe  poor,  regular  planning  workshops,  presentations,  and \nconsultation. The Project will continue the emphasis on full participation during implementation, \nincluding a national publicity campaign on extending the TRS and strengthening community and \nparent involvement in management of the TRS and the RTRFF.  \n \nD. \n\nto  consult  with \n\nCost Estimates \n\n48. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $55 million equivalent, including physical and \nprice contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and other charges. Of the total  cost, $23.8 \nmillion (43%) comprises the foreign exchange cost, and $31.2 million equivalent (57%) the local \ncurrency cost. The indicative project cost estimates by component are summarized in Table 1 \nand summary cost estimates by expense category are in Appendix 8.  \n \nE.  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n49. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $25  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2018s  ordinary \ncapital  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere its own independent decision and not  made in reliance on any  communication or advice \nfrom  ADB.  ADB  will  finance  45%  of  the  project  cost,  including  100%  of  the  foreign  exchange \n\n\f12 \n\ncost  and  2%  of  the  local  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $30.0  million \nequivalent of local costs (Table 2). Details of the Financing Plan are in Appendix 9. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost \n($\u2019000) \n\nComponent \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA.

MOPE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  The  project  steering  committee \n(PSC) established for the BETDP will be maintained for the Project as the decision-making body \nresponsible  for  overall  project  coordination.  Appointed  by  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  (COM), \nmembers  of  the  PSC  are  from  the  COM,  MOPE,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  other  related \ngovernment  agencies.  The  PSC  will  meet  quarterly  to  review  project  implementation  status, \ndiscuss  implementation  issues,  provide  broad  guidance,  ensure  coordination  among  different \nagencies, resolve issues, and review and advise on the annual implementation plan.  \n \n51.  MOPE will appoint a deputy minister as project director. The project director will provide \ngeneral  guidance  to  the  PIU  in  accordance  with  decisions  made  by  the  PSC;  will  arrange  the \nquarterly meetings of, and present quarterly reports to PSC; and ensure coordination of project \nimplementation  within  MOPE.  The  project  director  will  be  responsible  for  MOPE  policy  inputs \ninto the Project.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f13 \n\nA  project  manager  will  be  recruited  to  report  to  the  project  director,  and  will  be \n52. \nresponsible for coordinating and supervising the work of the PIU. The PIU, which will comprise \nthe  project  manager  and  6  staff,  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation, \nincluding  financial  management.  The  PIU  is  responsible  for  preparing  the  detailed  project \nimplementation plan and will provide annual reports and quarterly progress reports to the PSC, \nthe project director, and ADB. The PIU will manage and implement all four project components, \nalthough some activities may be subcontracted to specialist agencies within MOPE. The PIU will \nmaintain  four  sections:  procurement,  staff  development,  financial  and  accounting,  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  Not  all  sections  will  require  full-time  positions.  The  monitoring  and \nevaluation  section  will  work  closely  with  the  Education  Reform  Implementation  and  Monitoring \nUnit of the COM. The PIU will occupy the premises of the current PIU for the BETDP and will to \nthe extent possible take on the staff of that PIU, who have extensive relevant experience and a \ngood track record in successfully implementing the BETDP. The experience accumulated by the \nBETDP\u2019s PIU will be essential to the success of the Project. A project management chart is in \nAppendix 10. ADB's experience with MOPE through the BETDP indicates that it has sufficient \nfinancial management capacity and the proposed PIU structure is appropriate to support sound \nfinancial management and effective and efficient use of project resources. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years, from January 2005 to December 2009. A \n\n53. \nproject implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n54. \nThe Project will procure textbooks and related materials for grades 6, 7, and 8; furniture, \naudio/video  equipment;  library  books,  materials,  and  ICT  equipment  for  school  libraries;  and \nfurniture  and  computers  for  office  and  administrative  use.  ADB  loan-financed  goods  and \nservices  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Selected  supply \ncontracts  for  furniture,  equipment,  textbooks,  library  books,  and  supporting  instructional \nmaterials may be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding acceptable to ADB.10 The \nGovernment  will  finance  and  undertake  necessary  civil  works,  in  particular  to  rehabilitate  and \nupgrade  school  libraries.  Rehabilitation  work  will  not  involve  resettlement  or  have  a  negative \nenvironmental impact. \n \n55. \nThe  Government  has  been  advised  that  ADB  policy  requires  the  borrower  (including \nbeneficiaries of ADB loans), bidders, suppliers, and contractors under ADB-financed contracts, \nto  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  during  the  procurement  and  execution  of  such \ncontracts. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 12. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n56. \nThe  Project  will  require  937  person-months  of  consulting  services,  consisting  of  61 \nperson-months of international and 876 person-months of domestic consulting. Because of the \nhighly  integrated  nature  of  the  project  components,  international  consultants  will  be  engaged \nthrough a firm using quality and cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. Outline terms of reference for international consultants are in Appendix \n                                                 \n10  Procurement of equipment above $500,000 will follow international competitive bidding, while contracts valued at \n$500,000  or  less  will  follow  international  shopping  or  local  competitive  bidding.  Learning  materials  other  than \ntextbooks  and  computer  software  costing,  in  the  aggregate,  less  than  $100,000,  may  be  procured  through  direct \npurchase. \n\n\f14 \n\n13.  Domestic  consultants  with  relevant  expertise  in  areas  including  curriculum  reform, \nassessment  and  testing,  and  LOI  practices  will  be  selected  using  selection  procedures \nsatisfactory to ADB (Outline terms of reference for domestic consultants are in Supplementary \nAppendix C). An outline of the staff development (training) program and research studies is in \nSupplementary Appendix D.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe proposed ADB loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \n57. \nHandbook.  If  Government  funds  are  first  used  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB's  reimbursement \nprocedure will be applied. The Government requested the establishment of an imprest account \nto expedite loan disbursement, with a ceiling of $150,000. Statement of expenditure procedure \nwill  be  used  to  liquidate/replenish  the  imprest  account  and  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures. \nThe statement of expenditure ceiling will be $20,000.  \n \n58. \nBased  on  the  accumulated  experience  and  proven  competence  of  the  BETDP\u2019s  PIU, \ncore staff of that PIU will be maintained and contracted through direct selection using advanced \nrecruitment  action.  Because  the  BETDP  closes  on  30  September  2004,  the  Government  has \nasked  ADB  for  retroactive  financing  to  cover  the  PIU  operational  expenditures  from  1 \nSeptember  2004  to  the  loan  effective  date.  The  Government  has  also  requested  advance \nprocurement action for office equipment for the curriculum working group (including subgroups) \nand  for  office  equipment  and  a  vehicle  for  the  PIU.  The  advance  action  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  total  amount  under  retroactive \nfinancing  is  estimated  at  not  more  than  $100,000.  The  Government  was  advised  that  ADB\u2019s \napproval  of  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  financing  the \nProject. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n59.  MOPE will maintain separate accounts for project components financed by ADB and the \nGovernment,  and  will  prepare  financial  statements  according  to  international  accounting \nstandards.  MOPE  will  have  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited \nannually  by  independent  auditors  with  adequate  qualification,  knowledge,  and  experience  in \ninternational  accounting  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Certified  copies  of  the  audited  project \naccounts  and  financial  statements,  as  well  as  the  auditor\u2019s  reports  including  a  separate  audit \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  financial  year.  The  Government  was \nadvised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  the  timely  submission  of  audited  project  accounts  and \nfinancial statements, including the suspension of disbursements in case of noncompliance. \n \n60.  MOPE  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  reports  in  English  and  in  a  format \nacceptable  to  ADB  on  progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under \nreview,  the  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  problems  encountered during  the  quarter,  and \nthe  proposed  activities and  expected  progress during  the  following  period.  Within 3  months  of \nphysical  completion  of  the  Project,  MOPE  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  to \nfacilitate  postevaluation  of  the  Project.  The  project  completion  report  will  provide  details  about \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB.  \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f15 \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n61. \nIn  addition  to  targets  specified  in  the  project  framework,  systematic  monitoring  and \nevaluation  will  be  developed  and  undertaken  during  project  implementation.  Prior  to  loan \nnegotiations, MOPE and ADB agreed on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating project \nperformance in relation to its goals, purposes, and outputs (Appendix 14). The baseline values \nof the indicators will be established prior to project implementation. Monitoring indicators will be \nmeasured,  with  the  necessary  frequency,  during  project  implementation.  Comments  and \nfindings  on  these  indicators  will  be  incorporated  in  every  other  quarterly  report  to  ADB.  In \naddition  to  indicators  for  implementation  monitoring,  indicators  for  project  evaluation  will  be \nmeasured at project completion and 3 years after completion. Where feasible and appropriate, \nthese  data  should  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  Close  coordination  between  the  PIU  and  the \nEducation  Reform  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Unit  will  be  crucial  as  the  latter  has \nestablished  branches  in  all  oblasts  and  is  affiliated  with  the  COM.  At  project  inception, \ncompletion, and 3 years after completion, MOPE will submit to ADB a report that summarizes \nthe key findings of monitoring and evaluation of changes that occurred in the 3 preceding years. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n62. \nIn  addition  to  regular  twice-annual  reviews  of  the  Project,  comprehensive  reviews  of \nproject performance will be conducted at the end of the first and third years of implementation, \ngiven  that  much  of  the  policy  research  and  advisory  work  will  be  carried  out  during  the  first \nyears  of  implementation.  The  first  comprehensive  review  will  focus  on  the  success  of  policy \nadvisory  work  and  implementation  arrangements.  The  second  (midterm)  review  will  (i)  review \nthe  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  Project;  (ii)  identify  any  changes \nrequired  since  the  time  of  project  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  progress  of  project  implementation \nagainst  performance  indicators;  (iv)  establish  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (v)  if \nnecessary, recommend changes in the design or implementation arrangements. The paper and \nequipment revolving funds established under the National Bank of Uzbekistan11 are an integral \npart of the Government and ADB\u2019s approach to developing the textbook sector. Given that the \neffective  functioning  of  the  revolving  funds  is  essential  to  the  successful  development  of  the \ntextbook  sector  being  supported  by  the  Project,  it  will  be  a  subject  of  review  in  all  project \nreviews. \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\nThe  Mission  explained  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  to  Government  officials  and \n63. \nhighlighted paragraphs 1.06 to 1.08 of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement on issues concerning \nfraud  and  corruption.  The  Government  agreed  to  include  the  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption policy in all documents and contracts during bidding for and implementation of the \nProject. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries \n\n64. \nDirect Beneficiaries. The Project will benefit 6 million students annually in grades 2\u20139 \nby reducing parental contributions to the cost of textbooks. Of these students, 27.5% are from \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB.  1997.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Basic Education Textbook Development Project. Manila. (see Footnote 3).  \n\n\f16 \n\npoor  families  and  6.6%  are  from  ethnic  minority  groups.12  The  provision  of  supplementary \nreading materials and school libraries will be targeted to ensure that 40% of beneficiaries will be \nschools  from  poor  regions.  Secondary  beneficiaries  will  include  160,000  teachers  and  about \n1,200  school  librarians  and  specialists  who  will  receive  new  teacher  guides  and  formal  in-\nservice training in the use of new textbooks and the new school library facilities. In addition, 40 \ncurriculum developers and assessment specialists, 270 textbook evaluators, a new generation \nof textbook authors and publishers, and the printing industry will benefit from training in modern \ntechniques in their respective professional areas. The provision of basic ICT capacity in 1,000 \nschool libraries will help to develop new and sustainable policies for any future ICT investments \nin the sector. \n \n65. \nEducational  Benefits.  The  key  role  of  textbooks  as  one  of  the  most  important  factors \ndetermining student performance is well established. The most important educational benefit of \nthe Project will derive from the completion and establishment of the TRS and the establishment \nof  the  RTRFF,  which  will  ensure  the  sustainable  provision  of  core  textbooks  for  every  grade \nlevel  to  every  student  in  the  country  at  affordable  prices.  The  provision  of  targeted  TRS \nsubsidies by the Government will ensure that the full range of textbooks will also be available to \npoor students.  \n \n66. \nThe  design  of  an  improved  and  more  relevant  curriculum  will  introduce  new  skill  and \ncompetency-based  learning  objectives,  oriented  more  precisely  to  the  needs  of  a  market-\noriented,  democratic  society.  The  new  curriculum  will  encourage  students  to  take  more \nresponsibility for their own learning, and will aim to develop higher order thinking and problem-\nsolving skills and the ability to apply acquired knowledge. A reduced content burden will allow \nfor more classroom time to be devoted to understanding rather than rote learning and for more \nproductive  interaction  between  teaching  staff  and  students.  The  development  of  new  and \nimproved textbooks, combined with the introduction of upgraded school libraries will support the \nintroduction  of  SCL  and  teaching  methodologies.  The  upgraded  school  libraries  will  contain  a \nwider  collection  of  reading,  supplementary,  reference,  and  curriculum  support  materials  in  a \nvariety of media. The provision of library-based computers with Internet access will also widen \nthe  scope  of  information  available  to  students  and  teachers.  Thus,  the  library  development \ncomponent  will  provide  genuine  opportunities  for  individual  and  small  groups  working  and \nconducting research, which in turn will encourage wider reading and thinking around curriculum \nsubjects and the ability of students to explore and develop their own interests. \n \n67. \nReform  of  the  assessment  system  will  ensure  that  the  new  learning  objectives  can  be \nadequately  tested  and  is  expected  to  lead  to  more  open,  fair,  and  transparent  summative \nassessments. The development of formative tests will enable the more accurate measurement \nof  system  progress  toward  defined  educational  goals.  An  assessment  of  the  current  LOI \npractices  will  provide  the  basis  for  supporting  improved  educational  quality  and  equity  in \nminority  language  schools.  The  Project  will  also  support  the  training  of  a  cadre  of  curriculum, \nassessment, and LOI specialists; and will train over 1,200 librarians and specialists in the use of \nupgraded  school  libraries  and  a  wide  range  of  supplementary  materials.  Maintenance  and \nteacher support facilities in the effective use of ICT will be developed in all raions. \n \n68. \nFinancial  and  Economic  Analysis.  Under  normal  assumptions,  including  that  on  the \ncollection  rate  and  based  on  experience  of  the  piloting  and  subsequent  partial  national \nextension under the BETDP during 2000\u20132003, the TRS will be financially sustainable, i.e., the \naccumulated textbook rental fees over the 4 years of the replacement cycle will be sufficient to \n\n                                                 \n12   World Bank. 2003. Uzbekistan: Living Standards Assessment.  Washington, D.C. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f17 \n\ncover  the  cost  of  replacing  the  textbooks.  With  regard  to  fiscal  impact,  the  total  Government \ncommitment to externally funded projects in education, including $30 million to the Project and \nother  commitments  (mainly  to  the  ESDP  and  the  Senior  Secondary  Education  Project),  is \ncompared  with  the  annual  education  budget  for  the  years  2005\u20132009,  with  two  scenarios \ndepending  on  projections  of  budget  revenue.  In  both  cases,  Government  commitments  are \ndeemed  affordable  and  sustainable:  in  the  high-case  scenario  the  Government\u2019s  annual \ncommitment  as  a  percentage  of  the  education  budget  ranges  from  5.4%  to  2.8%,  averaging \n3.6% over the 5-year life of the Project; while in the low case scenario, it ranges from 5.2% to \n3.9%, averaging 4.3% over the 5-year life of the Project. The annual recurrent costs of the three \nprojects combined are only 0.1% of the annual education recurrent budget for both high and low \ncase scenarios.  \n \n69.  While  total  economic  costs  of  the  Project  consist  of  textbook  rental  fees  paid  by  the \nparents  and  the  total  project  cost,  the  Project  will  bring  substantial  economic  benefits. \nQuantifiable economic benefits derive from several sources. First, curriculum reform is expected \nto reduce the number of textbooks thereby reducing the price of the textbook set for each grade. \nSecond,  the  provision  of  textbooks  under  the  TRS  to  grades  6,  7,  and  8  will  bring  significant \nbenefits  to  students  and  parents  as  the  rental  fees  are  four  times  cheaper  than  full  textbook \npurchase prices. Third, increasing competition in the book sector is expected to bring efficiency \ngains  that  will  be  reflected  largely  in  lower  prices  of  textbooks,  further  reducing  parents\u2019 \ncontributions to rental fees. The sum of these quantifiable economic benefits under reasonable \nassumptions will far outweigh the total economic costs. The economic internal rate of return of \nthe  Project  is  calculated  to  be  30%.  The  resulting  net  economic  benefits  will  be  enhanced  by \nsignificant  nonquantifiable  economic  benefits  that  the  Project  will  impart  (a  fuller  analysis  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix E). \n \n70. \nPoverty Impact. Recent data indicate that 27.5% of the population or 6.8 million people, \nlive at or below the poverty line and nearly 70% of all poor reside in rural areas.13 The Project \nwill contribute to poverty reduction by improving the quality of, and access to, basic education \nfor students in grades 2\u20139. The Project will address the issue of access to basic education for \nthe  poorest  pupils  by  developing  an  effective  mechanism  for  providing  targeted  rental  fee \nsubsidies  in  the  form  of  free  textbooks  for  the  poorest  pupils  nationwide.  Forty  percent  of  the \n1,000 upgraded school libraries will be selected from schools in poor regions, which will lead to \nhigher educational achievement of pupils in poor schools. Curriculum reform is expected to lead \nto  further  cost  reduction  via  reduced  rental  fee  charges  for  textbooks  and  other  learning \nmaterials, which is one of the major barriers to participation by poor students (Appendix 15). \n \n71. \nSocial  Dimension.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  accumulation  of  human  capital, \nwhich  is  essential  for  higher  incomes,  and  reduces  poverty  and  vulnerability  of  the  poor.  The \nProject  will  increase  community  participation  in  financial  and  managerial  accountability, \nincluding in the allocation of rental fee financial support to the poorest. The Project will ensure \nthat  ethnic  minority  students  speaking  Russian  and  Karakalpak  will  benefit  from  continued \naccess  to  instructional  materials.  The  current  situation  with  regard  to  LOI  practices  will  be \nassessed  and  recommendations  will  be  provided  to  minimize  costs  and  improve  future \nemployment opportunities for ethnic minorities. The Project will continue to mainstream gender \nequity based on progress made under the BETDP through universal textbook provision, and by \ncorrecting gender stereotyping and bias in textbook development. \n \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  Developing  a  Comprehensive  Medium-Term \nStrategy for Improving the Living Standards of the People of Uzbekistan and Living Standards Assessment. Manila. \n\n\f18 \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards. The Project will involve minor library repair and \n72. \ninternal  refurbishing,  with  no  negative  environmental  or  resettlement  impact.  The  Project  will \nenhance  access  and  equity  for  ethnic  minorities  by  providing  textbooks  and  other  teaching \nmaterials in Russian and Karakalpak languages for ethnic minorities.  \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\nThe  Project  faces  sector,  financial,  institutional,  and  coordination  risks  that  are \n\n73. \noutweighed by the benefits and impacts. \n \n74. \nSector Risk. The Project is designed in the context of and supports the education sector \nreforms being implemented by the  Government. A reversal or slowdown of the sector reforms \ncould have an adverse impact on the Project. To mitigate such systemic risk, ADB will continue \nto assist with sector reform and management.  As the major provider of financial assistance in \nthe education sector, ADB has pursued a consistent strategy of policy dialogue supported with \nassistance in key areas. This strategy has yielded demonstrable results. The recently unveiled \nNPSED  2004\u20132009  is  also  a  clear  indication  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  continuing \nreform and strengthening basic education.  \n \n75. \nFinancial Risk. The financial sustainability of the TRS, a key component of the Project, \nwill  depend  on  (i)  maintaining  a  collection  rate  sufficient  for  replacing  textbooks  at  regular \nintervals,  and  (ii)  managing  the  accumulated  rental  fees.  The  RTRFF  will  be  established \nspecifically  to  address  this  risk  by  ensuring  professional  management  of  the  rental  fees \naccumulated  under  the  TRS,  and  systematic  supervision  and  monitoring  at  central,  oblast, \nraion, and school levels. Experience with national extension in the past 2 years in Uzbekistan, \nand  in  other  countries,  highlights  the  crucial  importance  of  the  RTRFF  in  maintaining  the \nfinancial  sustainability  of  textbook  provision.  Experience  of  the  BETDP\u2019s  PIU,  which  will  be \napplied to implementing the Project, will contribute significantly to mitigating this risk.  \n\n \n\n76. \nInstitutional  and  Coordination  Risk.  Successful  project  implementation  requires \nsignificant  institutional  capacity  for  the  Government  to  ensure  effective  coordination  among \ncentral  agencies  and  at  all  levels  of  government.  Such  coordination  will  be  essential  to \nextending the TRS, as calendar deadlines of school years must be met to provide textbooks on \ntime. Similarly, syllabus revision resulting from curriculum reform must be synchronized with the \ntextbook replacement cycles to avoid unnecessary redundancies. With regard to school library \nimprovement,  physical  repair  of  libraries,  refurbishing,  equipment  provision,  and  library  book \nprovision  must  be  well  sequenced  and  carried  out  by  different  agencies.  In  addition, \ncoordination is needed between the Project and teacher training component of the ESDP. This \ninstitutional and coordination risk will be mitigated by (i) building on the experience at all levels \nof  government  including  the  PIU,  gained  from  implementation  of  the  BETDP;  (ii)  improving \ncoordination and monitoring ability resulting from ADB past assistance including the Education \nReform  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Unit  at  COM;  (iii)  enhancing  efficiency  result  from \nGovernment  implementation  of  the  NPSED  2004\u20132009;  and  (iv)  continuing  MOPE  efforts  to \nbuild mechanisms for better coordination between the Project and the ESDP. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nA. \n\nGovernment Assurances  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n77. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f19 \n\nGovernment  Counterpart  Funding.  The  Government  will  allocate  in  a  timely  manner \n78. \nadequate funding in the budget for (i) the Government\u2019s share of procurement of textbooks for \nthe  school  years  of  2005/06  and  2006/07  under  the  Project;  (ii)  support  under  the  TRS  for \ntextbooks  for  those  socially  unprotected  who  cannot  afford  the  textbook  rental  fees;  (iii)  the \nrehabilitation  and  provision  of  furniture  for  the  1,000  pilot  school  libraries  according  to  the \nProject\u2019s  implementation  schedule;  and  (iv)  incremental  recurrent  costs  for  operation  and \nmaintenance of the refurbished and modernized pilot school libraries. \n \nCurriculum Reform and Textbook Development. The Government will ensure that (i) \n79. \nthe  curriculum  framework  working  group  is  established  by  1  February  2005;  and  (ii)  the \nintroduction  of  new  syllabi  will  synchronize  with  textbook  replacement  cycles  to  avoid \nunnecessary  redundancy,  with  new  syllabi  for  grades  4  and  5  completed  by  September  2006 \nand introduced by September 2007, and other revised grade level syllabi following annually.  \n \n80. \nEstablishment  of  Republican  Textbook  Revolving  Fund  Foundation.  The \nGovernment will (i) issue a formal decision on the establishment of the RTRFF by 15 December \n2004, as an independent legal entity in the form of a noncommercial republican foundation, to \nmanage the rental fees accumulated under the TRS, and textbook procurement and distribution \npursuant  to  orders  placed  by  schools,  operating  on  principles  of  transparency,  accountability, \nparticipation by schools and parents, and financial prudence, as agreed upon with ADB; (ii) by \n30 January 2005 register the RTRFF charter with consultation and agreement of ADB prior to its \nregistration; and (iii) ensure that the RTRFF will be fully operational by 1 February 2005.  \n \n81. \nThe RTRFF will be governed by a board of trustees, whose composition should include \nrepresentatives  of  parent  councils,  the  Mahalla  system,  school  administrations,  oblast/raion \npublic  education  departments,  MOPE,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Economy,  Ministry  of \nJustice, and the Central Bank of Uzbekistan. ADB will be an observer on the board of trustees. \nThe board of trustees will appoint RTRFF management. \n \n82. \nSchool Library Development. The Government will approve the selection of 1,000 pilot \nschool libraries under the Project by the end of 2005 according to the criteria agreed upon with \nADB\u2014125  will  be  identified  by  the  completion  of  physical  improvements  before  the  start  of \nschool year 2005/06.  \n \n83. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  physical  improvement  of  pilot  school  libraries  will  (i) \ntake  place  prior  to  procurement  of  equipment  for  libraries;  (ii)  be  closely  coordinated  with \nimplementation of other relevant project components, and follow designs agreed to by ADB to \nmeet  requirements  of  subsequent  improvements;  and  (iii)  have  no  negative  environmental \nimpact or land acquisition or resettlement implications. \n \nBook  Sector  Development.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  provisions  of  the \n84. \nCopyright Law (1996) will be effectively implemented and in particular author remunerations are \ndetermined between publishers and authors according to relevant provisions of the law. \n \n85. \nlaid out by the bidding documents under the Project will be allowed to participate in the bidding. \n \n86. \nThe  Government  will  continue  to  take  timely  and  effective  measures  to  improve  the \npolicy and regulatory framework of the book sector in order to enhance competition and private \nsector  growth.  Progress  in  this  regard  will  be  a  subject  of  specific  review  by  ADB  and  the \nGovernment within 1 year after the loan becomes effective. \n\nThe Government will ensure that any interested publisher and printer satisfying criteria \n\n\f20 \n\nNational  Guidelines  for  School  Libraries.  By  the  end  of  2005,  MOPE  will  adopt  \n\n87. \nnational guidelines for the school library system developed by the Project.  \n \n88. \nPro-Poor Targeted Subsidy. The Government will adopt measures by the end of 2005 \nfor  improving  targeted  subsidy  to  the  poorest  under  the  TRS  including  more  effective  delivery \nmechanisms  with  the  participation  of  teachers,  parents,  and  Mahalla  system,  based  on  the \nrecommendations of a study that will be completed under the Project by September 2005.  \n\n \nCoordination  between  the  Education  Sector  Development  Program  and  the \n89. \nProject.  The  Government  will  appoint  the  same  director  for  the  Project  and  the  ESDP  to \nstrengthen effective coordination during implementation of the two projects.  \n \nB. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\n90. \nThe  Government\u2019s  full  compliance  with  the  assurance  on  the  establishment  of  the \nRTRFF  as  specified  in  paras.  80\u201381  will  be  a  condition  for  disbursement  for  procurement  of \ntextbooks and other instructional materials.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n91. \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $25  million  to  the  Republic  of \nUzbekistan  for  the  Second  Textbook  Development  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n \n3 September 2004 \n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nGoal \nImprovement of quality \nof basic education  \n \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nMonitoring \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\n \n\nPerformance \nIndicators/Targets \n\u2022 Satisfactory ratings \nfor grade 5 based on \nthe new system \nintroduced will rise by \n2010 \n \n\u2022  Improvements in \nnational average \nattendance rates by \n2010 \n \n\u2022  Improvements in \nattendance rates of the \npoorest toward parity \nwith national figures \nbased on sample \nsurveys of schools \n \n\u2022 Maintenance of \ntransition rate from \ngrade 4 to 5 and from \ngrade 9 to 10 at \nbaseline levels \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\u2022 Improved curriculum \nand syllabi phased in \nby grade level from \n2006 onward \n\u2022 All pupils in grades 2\u2013\n9 in all schools are \nprovided with high \nquality sets of core \ntextbooks through the \nTRS by no later than \n2007 \n\u2022 School-based \ntextbook ordering \nthrough the Republican \nTextbook Revolving \n\n\u2022 National human \ndevelopment statistics; net \nenrolment ratios and \nattendance rates, \nparticularly for the poorest \n(2005, 2007, and 2010) \n \n\u2022 National testing scores \nand/or tracer studies using \n2005 as base year.

To  realize  this  aspiration,  basic  education  as  a  subsector  faces  the  key  challenge  to \nimprove quality and relevance, as analyzed in the following (a problem tree is attached).  \n \n2. \nGovernance  and  Institutional  Constraints.  As  a  priority  in  the  overall  government \nreform agenda, basic education has received significant fiscal and other support over the past \ndecade and managed to avoid the dramatic decline in enrolment witnessed in some transition \ncountries.  However,  within  an  overall  highly  centralized  bureaucratic  system,  basic  education, \nlike other subsectors, is still largely governed by rigid norms set by the central Government. For \nexample,  most  items  in  the  annual  school  budgets  are  fixed  and  schools  have  discretionary \nspending authority over only a small portion of the budget. In all subjects taught, programs and \nstandards set by the central Government strictly dictate the contents and time allocated for the \nsubjects,  leaving  inadequate  freedom  for  schools  to  adjust  to  student  needs  and  local \nconditions. State norms fix student-teacher ratios countrywide, and schools have neither power \nnor budgetary incentives to strive for optimal use of existing resources. As a result, the system \ndoes not encourage nor support capacity building in planning and management skills. While the \nMahalla  (local  community)  system  has  played  an  important  role  as  part  of  the  overall \ngovernment social protection system, community participation and involvement in key decision-\nmaking remains limited.  \n \n3. \nTo  address  equity  concerns  and  protect  the  poor,  the  Government  has  allocated  fiscal \nsupport  for  the  free  provision  of  textbooks  and  clothing  for  the  poorest  15%  of  the  school \npopulation. At present, this support is inadequately targeted because of the practical difficulties \nin providing compensatory budget support for areas with higher than average levels of poverty. \nThe problem is also due to the unavailability of poverty indicators for raions and school, which \nare necessary to achieve better targeting.  \n \nCurrently,  the  private  sector  does  not  participate  in  the  provision  of  basic  education. \n4. \nState-owned  enterprises  dominate  publishing  and  printing  of  textbooks  and  educational \nmaterials. The nascent and weak private sector and the emergence of a competitive educational \nbook market could benefit a great deal from continuing privatization, but first, the Government \nmust  accelerate  efforts  to  create  an  equitable  environment  and  improved  access  for  private \nsector involvement in the textbook market. Growing competition in this subsector would lead to \nincreased  external  efficiency  through  higher  quality  and  lower  prices  of  textbooks  and  other \neducational materials.  \n \n5. \nCurriculum  and  Other  Educational  Policies.  Curriculum  reform  has  been  ongoing \nsince 1991 and progress has been made in reforming state education standards and in reducing \nthe  number  of  subjects  and  the  amount  of  specified  content  for  the  school  year  2003/04. \nOverall,  the  curriculum  remains  overloaded  with  an  undue  emphasis  on  factual  memorization \nand on repetitive exercises rather than on the development of key skills and competencies. An \noverloaded  curriculum  reinforces  didactic  teacher-centered  classroom  approaches  at  the \nexpense  of  student-centered  learning  methodologies  because  teachers  must  rush  through \nclasses to meet to meet the heavy content requirements, leaving no time for interaction with and \namong students. Such a curriculum also has high cost implications as each subject requires a \ntextbook  and  each  book  has  far  too  much  extent.  As  the  cornerstone  of  an  education  system \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nsuitable for the new millennium, comprehensive curriculum reform is needed as the centerpiece \nof the reform agenda for basic education. \n \n6. \nA  modernized  assessment  and  testing  system  is  integral  to  the  system  to  ensure  the \nquality of basic education. At present, tests in schools are graded by individual teachers in the \nlower  grades  and  noneffective  national  tests  prior  to  graduation.  Under  such  a  system,  no \neffective  and  reliable  way  is  available  to  assess  and  compare  the  quality  of  basic  education \nprovided  on  a  national,  oblast,  raion,  or  school  basis,  and  no  way  to  compare  student \nperformance year-on-year or internationally. Existing assessment and testing practices need to \nbe  modernized,  together  with  curriculum  reform  to  ensure  an  effective,  fair,  and  transparent \nsystem that will support improvements in the quality and relevance of basic education.  \n \nThe current language of instruction (LOI) policy guarantees the rights of ethnic minorities \n7. \nto education in Russian, Karakalpak, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, and Turkmen, in addition to Uzbek. \nThe  Government  has  struggled  to  maintain  this  policy  by  providing  subsidies  for  minority \nlanguage textbook publishing especially in times of fiscal strains. Reform of LOI policies will help \nensure greater equity in the provision of education to the different national language groups and \nwill also contribute to overall system cost reduction. \n \n8. \nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) development in the school system is \nalso a stated priority of the Government as a central requirement for human development and \neducation  provision  in  the  21st  century.  However,  how  ICT  development  can  and  should  be \nintegrated  in  the  curriculum  to  improve  learning  and  teaching  is  unclear.  In  addition,  huge \ninvestment and recurrent cost implications of this policy requirement are yet to be fully explored \nand  understood.  Present  ICT  support  is  mostly  driven  by  funding  agencies  and  short-term \nbased, with little or no concern for longer-term financial sustainability. A practical, affordable and \nsustainable strategy for ICT development in schools is urgently needed. \n \nLearning and Teaching Materials. Textbooks are the dominant means of learning and \n9. \nteaching and thus the key material input in influencing quality and relevance of basic education. \nIn former Soviet times and prior to 1998, the Government provided textbooks. Due to increasing \nfiscal and financial strains, the Government decided to cease the free provision of textbooks and \nadopted  the  policy  of  user  charges.  Immediately  afterwards,  textbooks  were  in  short  supply \nbecause the majority of parents could not afford to buy them. The textbook rental scheme (TRS) \nsuccessfully  introduced  in  2000  effectively  addressed  the  affordability  issue  by  reducing \nparental expenditure on textbooks to a rental fee. The fee was approximately 5 times cheaper \nthan the total purchase price of a set of textbooks from the market. The TRS was subsequently \nextended  nationwide  to  cover  grades  2\u20135  and  9,  with  national  coverage  of  grade  2\u20139  to  be \ncompleted  by  the  end  of  2007.  Further  cost  savings  in  basic  textbook  provision  could  be \nachieved  by  reducing  textbook  requirements;  this  could  be  achieved  by  revising  curriculum \nspecifications  and  making  other  policy  improvements.  Currently,  textbooks  are  still  in  need  of \nimproved  professional  skills  in  writing,  illustration,  page  design,  layout,  and  presentation  to \nmake them more user friendly and thus enhance student interest and learning impact.  \n \n10.  While textbooks will remain for many years the fundamental learning and teaching tool, \nmodern,  open  access school  libraries  can  play  a  key  role as  resource  centers  in supporting a \nmodern  curriculum  and  student-centered  learning.  As  such,  they  provide  a  wider  range  of \nalternative  materials,  viewpoints,  and  approaches  that  supplement  and  extend  the  basic \ntextbooks. They also create an environment in which students can take greater responsibility for \ntheir own learning through individual and small group research, discovery, and project work on \nthemes from the subjects that they study in class. This support is integral to competency-based \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nlearning  and \n\nteaching.  A  reformed  curriculum  and  classroom \n\nlearning  objectives  and  the  development  of  higher  order  thinking  skills.  Unfortunately,  school \nlibraries  in  Uzbekistan  do  not  meet  these  requirements.  They  need  to  improve  management, \nprovide  adequate  space,  up-to-date  and  relevant  stock,  and  the  most  basic  equipment  to  aid \nlearning  and \nteaching \nmethodologies will require the additional learning resources that only a good school library can \nprovide.  The  introduction  of  computers  and  other  learning  hardware  will  in  turn  highlight  the \nurgent need for educational software currently lacking in the Uzbek language.  \n \nTeacher Quality and Development. Teacher quality is a key determinant of educational \n11. \nquality. Unlike in some transition economies, teachers in Uzbekistan have enjoyed regular pay \n(increases)  and  a  range  of  services  subsidized  by  the  Government.  Teacher  education,  both \npreservice and in-service, is also being reformed in content and organization. However, teacher \nquality remains a serious problem. About 50% of teachers at the primary level are considered to \nbe  underqualified  (without  higher  education),  and  many  are  overspecialized  in  narrow  subject \nareas.  Virtually  all  teachers  will  need  to  be  retrained  to  meet  new  learning  and  teaching \nrequirements  as  changes  in  education  content;  methodology,  and  approach  are  being \nintroduced.  While  these  improvements  are  urgently  needed,  poor  salaries  relative  to  other \nprofessions  in  a  transitional  labor  market  and  lack  of  clear  career  development  opportunities \noffer  little  incentive  or  motivation  for  teachers  to  improve  (e.g.,  in-service  training  facilities \noperate  at  only  60%  capacity,  reflecting  a  lack  of  interest  in  participating  in  training).  Many \nyounger  teachers  have  already  abandoned  teaching  as  a  career,  and,  as  a  result,  ageing  is \nthreatening  the  sustainability  of  the  subsector.  The  Government  has  recently  announced \nsignificant  increases in  teachers\u2019  salaries  and introduced a  performance-based  bonus  system, \nand strengthened qualification requirements for teachers, and made in-service training a priority, \nincluding  introducing  new  delivery  modes  such  as  distance  education.  However,  insufficient \nduration  of  training,  inadequate  qualification  of  training  instructors,  lack  of  educational \nequipment and instructional resources, and other teacher support systems are critical issues to \nbe  addressed  if  the  quality  and  relevance  of  in-service  teacher  training  us  to  be  substantially \nimproved.  \n \n12. \nPhysical Infrastructure and Equipment. Like many other sectors, basic education also \nsuffers  from  insufficient  investment  in  infrastructure,  equipment,  and  facilities.  As  a  result,  the \nphysical  infrastructure  in  many  schools,  especially,  in  poorer  regions,  suffers  from  dilapidated \nbuildings  and  classrooms  and  run-down  lavatories;  and  poor  water  supply,  electricity,  heating, \nlaboratories, and school libraries. A recent nationwide survey revealed that 40% of schools are \nhoused  in  inappropriate  and  unfit  buildings.  Similarly,  lack  of  funding  has  led  to  lack  of \nmaintenance of all school facilities and equipment, and a serious underfunding of consumable \nsupplies in support of physics and chemistry labs. This is a serious constraint on practical and \nexperimental  work,  affecting  effective  learning  and  teaching.  The  short  supply  of  necessary \noffice  equipment  such  as  computers  and  photocopiers  impedes  the  effectiveness  of  school \nmanagement.  Recently  the  Government  launched  a  major  multiyear  initiative  to  refocus  on \nimproving  basic  education;  the  principle  component  is  improving  the  technical  and  material \nbasis of schools.  \n  \nProgress  toward  the Millennium  Development  Goals.  Two  Millennium  Development \n13. \nGoals contain an education focus. Goal 2: Achieving universal primary education means that all \nchildren should be able to complete a full course of primary education. Goal 3: Promote gender \nequality  and  empower  women  requires  the  elimination  of  gender  disparity  in  primary  and \nsecondary education by 2005 and from all levels of education no later than 2015.  \n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n14.  While  net  enrolment  has  peaked  to  over  99%  after  rebounding  from  declining  during \nmost of the 1990s as a shock from transition, some evidence suggests1 that the attendance rate \nis  far  lower.  However  there  are  no  recent  meaningful  indicators  of  completion  rates to  the  5th \ngrade.  Lack  of  quality  and  relevance  could  be a  contributing  factor  along  with  other  economic \nand  social  factors.  Keenly  aware  of  the  detrimental  effect  on  the  younger  generation,  the \nGovernment  has  ordered  the  State  Prosecutor\u2019s  Office  for  investigation  and  action.  Although \nenrolment is balanced in terms of gender in basic education, greater gender disparity persists in \nsenior secondary education and higher education.  \n \n15. \nGovernment  Strategy  and  Policy  Framework.  Since  independence,  the  Government \nhas  given  education  high  priority  for  the  overall  reform  agenda.  This  is  reflected  in  the  close \nattention  paid  to  the  sector  by  senior  Government  officials  and  consistently  high  budget \nallocations to the sector. The strategic objective is to transform the education system to be more \nresponsive  to  the  requirements  of  a  market  economy  and  democratic  society  in  the  21st \ncentury.  Earnest  reform in  education  began  in  1997  with  the  adoption of  a  new  education law \nand  the  National  Program  for  Personnel  Training2.  The  national  program  identified  principal \nareas of reform including improving basic education and the objectives and actions to achieve \nstated  goals.3  Since  then  numerous  presidential  decrees  and  government  resolutions  have \nbeen  issued  to  guide  the  implementation  of  the  national  program4.  The  emphasis  was  put  on \nstrengthening  senior  secondary  and  vocational  education  during  the  early  years  of  program \nimplementation.  The  public  expenditure  framework  reflects  the  high  priority  accorded  to  the \nsector, and budget spending on education has remained high ranging between 7\u20138% of gross \ndomestic  product  or  over  20%  of  the  annual  budget,  reaching  about  10%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct or about 38% of the annual budget in 2003/04.  \n \n16. \nDuring  the  initial  years  of  implementation,  new  state  education  standards  were \ndeveloped.  Many  reform  measures  have  been  undertaken  to  address  the  key  challenges \ndiscussed here. Significant progress has been made in basic education, including (i) markedly \nimproving  efficiency  and  cost-effectiveness  of  textbook  provision;  (ii)  continuing  progress  in \ncurriculum  reform;  (iii)  modernizing  and  decentralizing  the  management  system,  including \nauthorization  for  schools  to  raise  and  manage  extrabudgetary  resources  and  the  establish \nschool  boards;  (iv)  implementing  resource  rationalization  measures  for  staff  and  other \nresources;  and  (v)  providing  budget  support  for  the  provision  of  textbooks  and  clothing  to \nchildren from low income families.  \n \n17. \nRecently a Presidential decree issued in February 2004 reaffirms the high priority status \nof  basic  education  and  redirects  substantial  resources  for  implementing  the  reform  agenda. \nWithin  basic  education,  priorities  include  (i)  strengthening  the  infrastructure  of  schools, \nespecially  rural  schools,  for  basic  education;  (ii)  increasing  the  supply  of  textbooks  and  other \ninstructional  materials  as  well  as  computers  and  modern  lab  equipment;  (iii)  redesigning  and \nimproving  education  content  via  revision  of  the  present  state  education  standards,  curriculum, \nand  syllabi;  (iv)  strengthening  teacher  quality  especially  in  rural  areas  by  improving  incentives \nand in-service training; and (v) encouraging private investment in basic education. Subsequent \nto the decree, the comprehensive National Program for School Education Development 2004\u2013\n                                                 \n1   United Nations Children\u2019s Fund database. \n2   The Constitution of Uzbekistan guarantees free basic education to all citizens.  \n3   These areas include (i) improvement of preschools and basic education, (ii) rationalization of senior secondary and \nvocational  education,  (iii)  improvement  of  educational  management  and  financing,  and  (iv)  establishment  of  an \neffective personnel training system.  \n\n4   The three stages of implementation begin with the first stage from 1997\u20132001, second from 2002\u20132005, and third \n\nfrom 2006\u20132010. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n33 \n\n2009  was  unveiled.  The  program  envisages  substantial  increases  in  investment  in  basic \neducation and will guide the implementation of the reform agenda in  basic education over the \nnext 5 years.  \n \nStrategy  and  Assistance  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  Other \n18. \nDevelopment Agencies. ADB is the lead provider of financial assistance in basic education in \nUzbekistan. A key objective of ADB\u2019s country strategy is to assist the Government to reduce the \nsocial costs of transition in which a key focus is on the education sector. ADB\u2019s sector strategy \nin  education  is  two-pronged:  supporting  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  and  relevance  of \neducation and enhancing national capacity to manage sector reforms. Following this approach, \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  and  assistance  in  basic  education  have  focused  on  supporting  the \nGovernment in addressing fundamental issues such as reforming the curriculum improving the \navailability  and  affordability  of  textbooks  and  learning  materials  production,  strengthening \nteacher  quality  and  development,  promoting  private  sector  participation,  as  well  as  enhancing \nplanning  and  management  capacities  in  all  levels  of  basic  education.  Since  1998  ADB  has \nprovided  five  loans  for  basic  education  to  help  the  Government  implement  reforms  in  these \nareas.  \n \n19.  While the Basic Education Textbook Development Project has laid the foundation for the \nProject, the Education Sector Development Project also provides important support, particularly \nwith respect to its objectives to (i) strengthen sector planning and management capacities, (ii) \nimprove  and  extend  teacher  education,  and  (iii)  initiate  pro-poor  policy  reform  and  strengthen \ncommunity  involvement.  These  features  of  Education  Sector  Development  Project,  once  fully \nimplemented, will support the Project by providing (i) a strong and coherent policy framework,  \n(ii)  stronger  sector  institution  capacity  for  successful  implementation,  (iii)  enhanced  teacher \nquality  complementary  to  improved  textbooks,  and  (iv)  strengthened  decision-making  at \nschools.  \n \nADB  has  maintained  close  coordination  with  other  funding  agencies  to  strengthen \n20. \ndevelopment  impact  through  complementary  actions  (Appendix  4).  The  United  States  Agency \nfor  International  Development  has  two  pilot  projects  (totaling  $5  million)  for  improving  teacher \nquality, teaching, equipment including computers, and community involvement; and strengthen \nschool management. United Nations agencies such as the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund are \nalso piloting similar support to a number of schools. These projects, while limited in scope and \ngeographic coverage, complement  ADB\u2019s assistance in testing out innovative approaches and \nmethods to improve quality and relevance of basic education. Recently, development agencies \nhave enhanced coordination in supporting further reforms in basic education. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A3.1: Issues in Basic Education \u2014 A Problem Tree Analysis\n\nEffect\n \n\n \n\nCauses \n\nCore problem\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNeed for Enhancement of the Quality of \nBasic Education  \n \n\n \n\nInefficient and Non-sustainable Textbook \nProvision\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n3\n4\n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\n \n \n\n \n\nGovernance, \n \n \nInstitutional Capacity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n- Highly centralized \nbureaucratic system \n- Weak planning and \nmanagement capacity \nat all levels \n- Need to improve \nbudgeting and \ninefficient use of \nexisting resources \n-  Need \nimprove\nto \ntargeted support of the\npoorest \n- Lack of competition \nand private sector \nparticipation\nBasic Education \nTextbook Development \nProject (BETDP): book \ntrade and the private \nsector  \nESDP: planning, \nbudgeting, \nmanagement capacity, \nand pro-poor activity \nthe Project: private \nsector access, local \ntraining capacity, and \ntargeted subsidies to \nthe poor \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nCurriculum and \nOther Quality Related \nPolicies \n\n- Overloaded \ncurriculum with too \nmany subjects and too \nmany content \nrequirements \n- Inappropriate \nassessment and \ntesting system \n- Need to review \nlanguage of instruction \npractice \n \n\nBETDP: syllabus \ndevelopment in six \nsubjects \nEducation Sector \nDevelopment Project \n(ESDP): teacher \ntraining curriculum \nthe Project: \ncomprehensive \ncurriculum and \nassessment reform \nplus Language of \nInstruction study \n\nLearning and Teaching \nMaterials \n\nTeacher Quality \nand Development\n\nPhysical Infrastructure & \nEquipment \n\n- Need to modernize \ncontent and methodology  \n- High cost/poor \naffordability \n- Poor pedagogical \npresentation and physical \nquality \n- Lack of supplementing \nmaterials (library stocks) \n- Lack of sustainable \ninformation and \ncommunication technology \n(ICT) development to \nmodernize learning \n\nBETDP: textbook supply, \nquality upgrading, and \naffordability \nESDP: teacher training and \nmethodological change \nthe Project; Sustainable \ntextbook supply, quality \nimprovement, school \nlibraries & ICT policy \n\n- Need for retraining \n(overspecialization, \nmethodologies) \n- Lack of motivation \nand career \ndevelopment  \n- Ageing work force \n(transition labor \nmarket influence) \n- Teacher training \nsystem and facilities \nneed updating \n \n\nBETDP: research \ninto methodologies \nESDP: In-service \nand DE teacher \ntraining and \nenhanced teacher \nefficiency \nthe Project: \ncurriculum impact on \nmethodology and \nteacher training for \nlibraries \n\n-Decayed infrastructure \n(classrooms, buildings, \nheating, sanitary facilities) \n- Lack of education facilities \nsuch as libraries, \nlaboratories, sports facilities\n- Lack of other equipment \nand consumable supplies \n(for chemistry, physics, labs\nmanagement equipment, \netc.) \n- Ineffective use of existing \ninfrastructure \n\nBETDP: printing equipment \nand raw materials \nESDP; upgrading poor \nschools with furniture and \nequipment, including ICT \nthe Project: upgrading \n1,000 school libraries with \nfurniture, stock and \nequipment, including ICT \n\nBETDP = Basic Education Textbook Development Project, ESDP = Education Sector Development Project,  ICT = information and  \ncommunication technology. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nEXPERIENCE OF THE TEXTBOOK RENTAL SCHEME IN UZBEKISTAN \n\nThe Pilot Textbook Rental Scheme \n\nUntil 1998 all school textbooks were supplied free of charge to students on the basis of \n1. \nannual  loans  from  the  school  textbook  library.  The  Government  funded  all  textbooks.  As \nfinancial  constraints  became  more  intense  the  Government  abandoned  this  policy  and \nintroduced  parental  purchase  of  textbooks.  While  many  parents  found  textbooks  at  full  price \nunaffordable, suppliers also struggled with uncertainty of demand and lack of credit. By 2000 a \nserious textbook shortage existed in many schools and the (MOPE) requested a research study \ninto  alternative  approaches  to  textbook  provision  under  the  Basic  Education  Textbook \nDevelopment  Project.  The  research  study  made  the  following  recommendations,  which  were \naccepted and implemented by MOPE as the pilot Textbook Rental Scheme (TRS): \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDesign a TRS to suit the specific requirements of Uzbekistan and pilot test it to \ndetermine its efficacy and acceptability in Uzbekistan. \nMaintain parental rental fee contributions within school bank accounts to create a \nschool-based rental scheme. \nDevelop  an  evaluation  scheme  acceptable  to  the  Government,  MOPE,  and  the \nAsian Development Bank as the basis for  \u2018\u2018go/no go\u201d decisions on extending the \npilot to national coverage \n\n \n2. \nThe  pilot  TRS  was  planned  in  February  2001  and  launched  in  April  2001  prior  to \nsupplying  rental  scheme  books  to  schools  in  September  2001.  It  supplied  1.583  million \ntextbooks  in  the  Uzbek  language  (plus  accompanying  teacher  guides)  of  39  different  titles \ncovering  6  grade  levels  to  over  220,000  students  (4%  of  total  enrolment)  in  14  raions\u2014one \nraion from each oblast in Uzbekistan, including the poorest raions. \n \nBetween September 2001, when the pilot TRS was launched, and May 2002 when the \n3. \nrental  fee  collection  period  closed,  the  pilot  TRS  collected  over  SUM319  million  from  parents \ninto  the  Textbook  Revolving  Fund  account  maintained  in  the  Pakhta  Bank.  This  sum \nrepresented a collection rate of 93% of the target figure. This clearly demonstrated the success \nof the pilot TRS and the evaluation study concluded as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nParents  strongly  supported  the  TRS  concept  and  were  prepared  to  meet  the \nannual cost of the rental fee, including those from the poorest schools.  \nParents were motivated to pay the rental fees because they were much cheaper \nthan  the  costs  of  textbook  purchase  and  because  the  fees  collected  and \naccumulated  in  school  accounts  were  perceived  to  be  of  direct  benefit  to  their \nown local community schools \nThe  poorest  students  required  ongoing  financial  support  for  the  textbook  rental \nfees.  The  study  suggested  that  government  funding  for  10\u201315%  of  the  poorest \nstudents should be sufficient to ensure full and sustainable textbook supply. \nFour years of government/funding agency investment in start-up textbook rental \nstock  was  needed.  Thereafter,  school  textbook  provision  could  cease  to  be  a \ncharge on government budgets (except for continued Government support for the \nvery  poorest  families  (iii)  and  could  be  maintained  by  parental  contributions \nalone.  \nDevolved  expenditure  on  textbooks  to  the  level  of  individual  schools  supported \ngeneral  educational  objectives  in  Uzbekistan  on  moves  toward  decentralization \nvia school-based, per capita funding and school-based management.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(vi) \n\nFull  textbook  provision  for  every  student  in  every  core  subject  at  every  grade \nlevel supported by parental contributions was realistic and achievable as long as \nrental fees were held at affordable levels. \n\nAs  a  result  of  the  success  of  the  pilot  TRS,  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  approved  the \n\n \n4. \nextension of the TRS concept to the national level from September 2002. \n \nB. \n\nExtension of the Textbook Rental Scheme (TRS) to National Coverage \n\n5. \nThe first national phase of the TRS was launched in September 2002. It comprised 10 \ntitles for grade 9, all of which had been selected from competitive submissions generated by an \ninternationally announced textbook competition\u2014the first time such a process had been used in \nUzbekistan.  Textbooks  were  supplied  in  both  Uzbek  and  Karakalpak.  The  second  cycle  for \nschool  year  2003/04  supplied  textbooks  for  grades  4  and  5  in  three  languages\u2014Uzbek, \nKarakalpak, and Russian. The third cycle for  school year 2004/05 will provide grades 2 and 3 \ntextbooks and teacher guides in all seven national languages. A summary of the details of the \nnational operation of the TRS is provided in Table A4. \n \n6. \nTo achieve sustainability, the TRS should operate on collection rates of around 90% of \ntotal enrolment (excluding 15% of the poorest who can\u2019t pay). However, collection rates for the \nTRS have declined since the pilot project. The reasons for this include the following:. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIn 2002/03 only 72% of the schools were initially supplied with TRS textbooks as \na result of a shortfall in Government funding. This caused confusion among many \nschools, which often did not know whether they were part of the TRS. \nIn  2003/04  many  of  the  textbooks  were  not  supplied  to  schools  until  January \n2004.  Thus  rental  fee  collection  is  still  in  progress  and  additional  sums  are \nexpected to be paid into the bank accounts in the next 2 months. \nThe  Basic  Education  Textbook  Development  Project  is  currently  nearing \ncompletion  and  maintaining  the  necessary  monitoring  and  supervision  of  raions \nand schools is difficult. \nA  recent  school  mapping  exercise  suggests  that  enrollment  numbers  may  have \nbeen overstated in the past by up to 10%.  \n\n \n7. \nMost  of  the  reasons  identified  were  due  to  a  lack  of  experience,  planning,  and \ncoordination,  and  are  thus  avoidable  in  the  future.  However,  a  key  factor  in  maintaining \ncollection  rates  is  the  necessity  for  systematic  monitoring  and  supervision.  International \nexperience  demonstrates  that  all  TRSs  suffer  from  fluctuations  in  collection  rates.  Therefore \nfinancial systems should be able to provide fast and accurate information on levels of collection \nto enable problems to be quickly identified and rectified. This is the case in Uzbekistan where \ncollection  levels  are  monitored  nationally  on  a  monthly  basis.  The  national  data  can  then  be \nanalyzed  in  more  detail  for  individual  oblasts,  raions,  and  even  schools.  This  is  the  basis  for \nstrong and effective management and the fast resolution of problems.1 If the Uzbek TRS is to be \nsustainable it must be able to take  corrective  action in  response to  occasional shortfalls. The \nmonitoring of oblasts, raions, and schools should be intensified to maintain collection rates and\n\n                                                 \n1   One of the main problems in the TRSs in Tajikistan and Kazakhstan was the lack of reliable financial information \non collections. Conversely, the success of the Armenian scheme was strongly based on the detailed and accurate \nfinancial information available to scheme management.   \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n37\n\nthe  value  of  the  fund.2  The  establishment  of  the  Republican  Textbook  Revolving  Fund \nFoundation early in 2005 will provide, for the first time, dedicated TRS monitoring staff in each \noblast  and  part-time  TRS  monitoring  staff  in  every  raion  in  addition  to  the  strong  financial \nsystems described earlier. Collection should be maintained at the required levels. \n \n8. \nThis is the foundation on which the proposed successor project will build to complete the \nconstruction  of  a  fully  operational  and  sustainable  textbook  provision  system  providing  all \nrequired textbooks in all subjects and all grades to all students in all national languages. \n \n\nTable A4: Textbook Rental Scheme Operations in Uzbekistan \n\nItem \nGrade(s) Supplied \nNumber of Titles/Grades \n\n2002/03 \n9 \n10 \n\nNumber of Languages \nPrint Runs (all languages) \nRental Fees \n\n2 \n568,000 \nSUM3,250  \n\nTarget Collection Level \nOpening TRS Balance \nClosing TRS Balance \nInterest Earned (estimate) \n\nValue of Collections \nCollection Rate \nProcurement Cost \n\nSUM1.923 billion  \nSUM0.311 billion  \nSUM1.980 billion  \nNot yet paid into \naccount \nSUM1.660 billion  \n86% \nSUM4.5 billion  \n\n2003/04 \n4 and 5 \nGrade 4 =5 titles \nGrade 5 = 6 titles \n3 \n603,000 \nGrade 4 = SUM1,650 \nGrade 5 = SUM1,800  \nSUM3.920 billion  \nSUM1.980 billion  \nSUM4.765 billion  \nNot yet paid into \naccount \nSUM2.785 billion  \n71% \nSUM4.6 billion  \n\n2004/05 \n2 and 3 \nGrade 2 =5 titles \nGrade 3 = 5 titles \n7 \n520,000 \nNot yet calculated \n\n \n4.750 billion \n \n \n\n \n \n3.2 billion \n\n \nNotes: \na. Grade 9 titles included English but not French or German. Thus 350,000 students were supplied with 10 titles at a \nrental  fee  of  SUM3,250  and  218,000  students  (those  studying  French  or  German  or  without  an  English  teacher) \nwere supplied with 9 titles at a rental fee of SUM2,950. \n\nb. Grade 4 Russian students were supplied with only three titles at a rental fee of SUM1,200.  \nc. Grade 5 Russian students were supplied with only five titles at a rental fee of SUM1,500. \nd. The target collection level is cumulative and includes repeat fees from the previous years\u2019 supplies. \ne. Interest earned is still being calculated by Pakhta Bank and has not yet been credited to the TRS accounts. It is \nestimated to be approximately SUM470 million and part is currently held in a suspense account awaiting allocation \nto  individual  school  accounts.  When  transferred,  the  value  of  the  fund  will  be  over  SUM5.25  billion.  If  collection \nrates for the third cycle supply can be restored to target levels, then the value of the fund will exceed SUM10 billion \nby the end of the year, which is sufficient to maintain sustainability. \n\nf. The significant reduction in student enrolments in grades 2 and 3 for school year 2004/05 is not believed to be an \nactual  reduction  in  student  numbers  but  the  result  of  more  accurate  data  supplied  following  the  recent  school \nmapping  exercise.  The  student  numbers  may  have  been  overestimated  by  as  much  as  10%  in  previous  TRS \nsupply cycles, which partly explains the declining TRS fee collection rates. \n\ng. It should be noted that no financial support for socially unprotected students is included in the TRS to date. This \n\nwill be included for the first time in the 4th TRS cycle, which will supply books to schools in September 2005. \n\nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n2  It  should  be  noted  that  Uzbekistan  has  provided  seed  funding  for  textbook  supplies  to  schools  over  a  4-year\nperiod to allow time for TRS funds to accumulate. In practice, this means that there is a 4-year funding cushion\nwithin  the  Uzbek  TRS,  which  provides  time  for  corrective  action  to  be  taken  in  response  to  any  occasional\nshortfall,  Thus,  by  the  end  of  2004,  the  Uzbek  TRS  fund  is  projected  to  have  accumulated  to  around  SUM10\nbillion with 2 full years of collection still to take place before renewals are required. The projected cost of the first\nyear of replacement is around SUM5 billion. Thus the TRS has already reached initial sustainability. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f  \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n\n \n \n3\n8\n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n\ni\n\nAsian Development Bank Strategy/Activities \n\nOther Development Partners\u2019 Strategy/Activities \n\nEducation  Support efforts to improve the relevance and quality \n\nof education and enhance national capacities to plan, \ndesign, manage, and monitor sector reforms. \n \nTarget primarily compulsory education (grades 1\u2013\n12), along with support for early childhood \ndevelopment).

Under  the  TRS \nparents rent textbooks at a fee only a fraction of the full purchase price; textbooks are designed \nto last 4 years. Starting from 2002, the TRS is being gradually extended nationwide until 2007 \nwhen all grades (2\u20139) in all schools will be covered by the TRS. The extension of TRS coverage \nto  grades  6,  7,  and  8  will  be  supported  by  the  Project  during  2005\u20132007.  The  rental  fees \ncollected are kept in a Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) account with each school having a \nsubaccount  identifying  its  portion  of  the  fees  collected.  As  of  1  July  2004,  a  total  of  SUM4.7 \nbillion (or 47% of the total costs of TRS introduced during 2001\u20132003) had been accumulated. \nThis  amount  is  expected  to  increase  steadily  until  the  first  cycle  of  textbook  replacement  (for \ngrade 9) begins in 2006 when there will be a drawdown on the collected amount. At full national \ncoverage the average balance of the rental fees collected is projected to be about $30 million, \nand  no  further  budgetary  support  will  be  required  except  for  the  continued  support,  which  the \nGovernment has committed to, for the socially unprotected. This amounts to about 15% of total \nenrolment  who  cannot  afford  to  pay  even  the  rental  fees.  The  main  sources  of  TRS  financing \nare the Government (budget and Asian Development Bank (ADB) loans) and parents who pay \nrental fees. While the Government provides the startup capital, once replacement of textbooks \nbegins,  starting  in  2006,  no  further  budgetary  support  will  be  needed  except  for  the  socially \nunprotected.  \n \n2. \nBased  on  the  experience  in  Uzbekistan  since  2001  and  lessons  learned  elsewhere,  a \nnumber  of  key  principles  have  been  identified  for  TRS  sustainability  and  the  provision  of \naffordable  textbooks  to  all  students  nationwide.  First,  rental  fee  collection  rates  have  to  be \nsufficiently high (80% or more), which requires widespread support of parents. A key to win and \nmaintain parental support is the guarantee that the rental fees will be used for the purpose for \nwhich they are intended, the sustainable supply of low-cost textbooks. Second, high collection \nrates  depend  critically  on  overall  supervision  and  management.  Experience  elsewhere  (e.g., \nArmenia,  Tajikistan)  has  highlighted  the  importance  of  systematic  supervision  and  monitoring. \nThird, continued government support will be required for supporting those students (about 15% \nbased on Uzbekistan experience) who are too poor to pay even rental fees\u2014to ensure equity \nand social protection. Fourth, affordable rental fees require long book life to allow for maximum \ncost  amortization,  which  in  turn  is  based  on  high  physical  production  specifications.  The \ncollected rental fees will have to be maintained intact and without misappropriation or diversion \ninto other uses. In education systems where financial resources are scarce there will always be \npressure  to  divert  accumulated  rental  fees  to  other  urgent  needs  unless  they  are  specifically \nprotected. Diversion of funding undermines the TRS\u2019 capacity to purchase replacement copies \nin the required quantities, which in turn undermines the entire TRS concept. Finally, centralized \nversus  school-based  management  of  TRS  fees  will  have  distinct  advantages  in  terms  of  the \ncapacity  to  maintain  the  fund  value  through  financial  and  risk  management,  and  internal \nsystematic monitoring and control.  \n \nThe  Government,  assisted  by  ADB,  has  been  considering  various  options  based  on \n3. \nthese principles in order to institutionalize the sustainable provision of textbooks. Consultations \nhave  been  held  with  all  stakeholders  over  the  past  2  years,  including  seminars,  workshops, \ninterviews,  field  visits,  and  a  nationwide  public  campaign  on  the  TRS.  ADB  missions  have \nworked  closely  with  the  Government  and  local  legal  experts  on  the  issue  since  2004.  As  a \nresult,  agreement  has  been  reached  on  the  establishment  of  a  republican  textbook  revolving \nfund  foundation  (RTRFF)  as  an  independent  legal  entity.  Its  main  objective  is  to  manage  the \n\n \n\n\f40\n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nrental  fees  accumulated  under  the  TRS  and  textbook  procurement  and  distribution  on  orders \nplaced  by  schools  and parents.  In  achieving  its  main  objective,  the  RTRFF  will  be  required  to \nfulfill the following: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nConsolidate parent and school support for the TRS and represent their interests. \nEnsure that the textbook funds are operated within the Government\u2019s education \npolicy guidelines. \nGuarantee the security and proper use of the rental fees collected from parents. \nEnsure  the  most  effective  use  of  scarce  resources  and  minimize  the  costs  of \ntextbook production. \nProvide professional management of the rental fees collected.  \nCoordinate textbook development policies and practices with MOPE. \nProvide \nestablishment from schools. \n\nindependent  monitoring,  data  collection  and  accurate  order \n\n(viii)  Organize efficient and on-time procurement and delivery of textbooks to schools \n\naccording to school orders. \n\nin  accordance  with  Uzbek \n\nresponsibilities,  and  obligations \n\n \n4. \nThe  RTRFF  will  be  governed  by  a  board  of  trustees  comprising  representatives  of \nschools,  parents,  the  Mahalla  (local  community),  as  well  as  the  government.  The  board  will \nappoint RTRFF management. As a foundation, its charter will specify in more detail its scope of \nlaw.  However, \nactivities, \ntransparency,  accountability,  and  financial  prudence  are  its  principles  of  operation.  A  small \npercentage  of  the  interest  on  the  accumulated  rental  fees  can  be  made  available  to  pay  the \noperating  costs  of  the  RTRFF;  to  maintain  a  permanent,  specialist  staff  to  manage  the  rental \nfees  on  behalf  of  parents  and  schools;  and  to  ensure  sustainability  of  textbook  provision.  A \nmaximum limit on the use of funds for administration purposes can be established as part of the \nRTRFF  charter.  A  draft  charter  has  been  discussed  with  the  Government  and  is  undergoing \nrevision. \n \n5. \nGiven  the  key  importance  of  the  RTRFF  to  the  sustainable  provision  of  affordable \ntextbooks (a key objective of the Project), the Government and ADB have agreed on a series of \ntime-bound actions. These include: the Government will (i) issue a resolution or similar legally \nbinding  document  by  December  2004  to  establish  the  RTRFF;  (ii)  register  the  RTRFF  charter \nwith the Ministry of Justice with consultation and agreement by ADB prior to its registration; and \n(iii) ensure that the RTRFF will be fully operational by February 2005. The timely fulfillment of \nthe actions, as a condition for disbursement for textbook procurement, will ensure that support \nfor textbook provision under the Project will meet its designed purposes.  \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n41\n\n \n\nOUTLINE OF SELECTION CRITERIA FOR WORKING GROUPS  \nAND SCHOOL LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT \n\nSelection of Curriculum Working Group Membership (40 members) \n\n \n1. \nThe criteria provided here are intended as an outline only.

The Project contributes to \nthe accumulation of human capital, which is essential for higher incomes and sustained economic growth. \nIt helps reduce poverty by increasing the productivity of the poor and by equipping people with the skills \nthey need to participate fully in the economy and in society.  \n \nWithin the context of basic education reforms, the Project will enhance the curriculum by making it more \nrelevant to the needs of the labor market, will improve access by making textbooks more affordable for the \npoorest parents, and will broaden community participation by decentralizing education management and \nfinancing.  Improving  the  quality  and  relevance  of  the  basic  education  system  will  be  key  priorities  for \nreducing poverty and preventing the intergenerational transmission of poverty.   \n \nThe survey report indicated that the Project will benefit 6 million students in grades 2 to 9 in which 27% are \nstudents from poor families. Four hundred thousand students from minority language schools will receive \nnew  and  better  quality  textbooks  and  supplementary  reading  materials.  Secondary  beneficiaries  include \n160,000  teachers  and  about  1,200  school  librarians  who  will  receive  new  teacher  guides  and  in-service \ntraining. In addition, 40 curriculum developers and assessment specialists, 270 textbook evaluators, and a \nnew  generation  of  textbook  authors  and  publishers  plus  the  Uzbek  printing  industry  will  benefit  from \ntraining in modern techniques in their respective professional areas. The provision of basic information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) capacity in 1,000 school libraries will support an increase in the volume \nand quality of information exchange, and will develop policies for future ICT investments in the sector. \n \nThe  Government  will  continue  to  earmark  budget  support  for  subsidizing  textbook  rental  fees  for  about \n15%  of  the  students  that  began  in  2002/03.  Provision  of  computers  and  supplementary  books  and \nmaterials for use in upgraded school libraries will improve the learning environment in schools, which will \nlead  to  higher  achievements  of  pupils.  About  40%  of  the  investment  in  upgraded  school  libraries  will  be \ntargeted to the poorest schools in the country. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Classification \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \n\n \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nUzbekistan has a population of about 25 million and the World Bank \nreport  on  Uzbekistan  Living  Standards  Assessment  (2003)  shows \nthat an estimated 27.5% of the population or 6.8 million people are \nunable to meet basic consumption needs or live below the poverty \nline.  Using  the  international  poverty  line  of  $2.15  per  day  per \nperson,  more  than  half  of  the  population  lived  in  poverty  in  1999.1  \n\n \n\n(Following \n\nIntervention \n\nPoverty \nthe \nBoard  approval  of  the  R-paper,  Review \nof  ADB\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy, \nstaff  instructions  to  replace  the  PI/CPI \ntracking \nclassification  with  a  new \nsystem  are  under  preparation,  in  line \nwith para. 83 of the R-paper.) \n\n                                                 \n1   International Monetary Fund/World Bank. 2002. Poverty Reduction, Growth and Debt Sustainability in Low-Income \n\nCIS countries. CITY. Joint international financial institutions\u2019 paper on Growth and Debt.  \n\n \n\n\f58\n\n \n\n Appendix 15 \n\nApproximately one third of all poor households can be classified as \nextremely poor (footnote 1). Incidence of poverty is much higher in \nrural areas than their urban counterparts. They are 35% more likely \nto  be  poor  and  58%  more  likely  to  be  extremely  poor.  The  higher \nincidence  of  rural  poverty  is  compounded  by  rural-urban  income \ndifferentials.  The  observed  rural-urban  differentials  in  poverty \nincidence  can  be  attributed  to  a  variety  of  factors,  most  important \namong  which  are  educational  attainments,  lack  of  infrastructures, \ndifferences  in  opportunities  such  as  access  to  markets  or  labor \nmarket opportunities, and environmental factors that affect health or \nland quality.2  \n \nIn  general,  the  transition  has  resulted  in  a  significant  fall  in  living \nstandards for most of the population. The transition period has been \naccompanied by (i) increase in unemployment, (ii) high inflation, (iii) \na  decline  in  production,  (iv)  decreasing  standards  of  living,  (v) \nincreasing income differentiation and inequality, and (vi) decreasing \nbudgets for social services, such as education. Physical indicators \nof  poverty  such  as  malnutrition  have  steadily  worsened,  and  the \nsocial  safety  net  has  deteriorated  mainly  because  of  the  limited \nresources  available  for  poverty  reduction.  Although  Government \nexpenditures on education have remained relatively high, the falling \nliving standards and the introduction of cost sharing for all students \nhave  made  education  more  expensive  especially  for  the  poor. \nHigher education has now become unaffordable to many students. \n \n\nB.  Participation Process \n \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe Project was designed through the participation of all stakeholder groups such as central and sectoral \nministries, oblast and raion education departments, Hakimyats (local executive branch of the government), \nschool  directors,  teachers,  and  parents  as  the  main  beneficiaries.  In  addition  to  conventional  survey \nmethods the participatory rural appraisal was employed to provide a voice to communities, particularly to \nthe poor. A major national publicity campaign using national and regional television, radio, the press, the \nbanking  system,  and  information  circulars  to  educational  establishments  ensured  that  parents  and \nteachers  fully  understood  the  financial  and  economic  benefits  and  the  operational  principles  of  the \nTextbook  Rental  Scheme  (TRS).  Parents  of  poor  families  have  particularly  welcomed  the  significant \nreductions  in  annual  textbook  costs  and  the  possibility  of  full  participation  in  the  management  of  the \naccumulated rental funds.  \n \nThe  Project  will  continue  national  publicity  campaigns  for  the  extension  of  the  TRS.  Extensive \nconsultations will be conducted to develop a model for minority language educational programs, including \nan assessment of the special needs of ethnic minority children, current actual provision, and current actual \nachievement. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2   Detailed analysis on poverty, labor market and education is presented Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n59\n\nD.  Gender Development \n \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nDue to a system of compulsory education, literacy is almost universal and no significant difference exists \nbetween  girls\u2019  and  boys\u2019  educational  attendance  and  attainment  at  primary  and  secondary  education \nlevels.3  Equality of gender representation in learning and teaching materials is not perceived as a major \nissue.  \n \nDuring the Basic Education Textbook Development Project (BETDP), research studies were conducted on \ngender representation and stereotyping in textbooks, and the recommendations of these research studies \nhave been incorporated into the specific gender components of the textbook evaluation criteria. Approval \ncriteria  and  methodology  are  being  included  in  the  specific  evaluation  requirements  on  the  fair  and \nequitable  presentation  of  gender  in  textbooks,  teacher  guides,  and  other  learning  materials  and  marks. \nThe  evaluation  for  gender  sensitivity  and  appropriateness  is  part  of  the  process  of  approval.  Training \nworkshops  conducted  under  BETDP  for  textbook  authors  and  publishers  on  the  issue  of  gender \nstereotyping  will  be  continued  as  part  of  the  Project.  The  project  performance  monitoring  system  will \ninclude  enrollment,  retention,  and  general  gender  and  development  concerns.  Other  issues  with  gender \nimplications  to  be  monitored  will  include  ongoing  analysis  of  education  materials  for  gender  biases  and \nstereotypes against a prioritization of education for girls. \n \nOutput Prepared: Gender action plan is not required. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.

The \nestablishment of the TRS has reduced the costs for \ntextbooks  and  reduced  parental  expenditures  on \nlearning  materials.  This  will  reduce  the  financial \npressures  of  education  provision  for  poor  parents. \nto  provide \nThe  Government  has  undertaken \nfinancial support to about 15% of the students who \ncannot afford to pay even the rental fees. \n \nThe Project will not have any negative impact on the \nlabor market. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\nResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \n Significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3   Asian Development Bank. 2001.
