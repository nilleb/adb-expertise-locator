The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant \nto be provided by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund1 under the Urban Financing \nPartnership  Facility,  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Urban  Primary  Health  Care  Services \nDelivery  Project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant.  \n \n2. \nThe project supports improving the accessibility, quality, and use of urban primary health \ncare  (PHC)  services  through  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP). 2  The  proposed  additional \nfinancing  will  (i)  strengthen  institutions  and  capacity  for  sustainable  delivery  of  urban  PHC; \n(ii) scale  up  successful provision  of  PHC  services,  especially  for the  poor,  vulnerable,  women, \nand children; and (iii) provide effective support to decentralized project management. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nOn 18 July 2012, Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the project in the amount of \n3. \n$50  million  loan  and  cofinancing  of  $20  million  equivalent,  which  covers  10  cities  and  four \nmunicipalities  (9.5  million  population),  representing  about  17%  of  the  total  57  million  urban \npopulation. The project is one of the largest PPP projects in the delivery of PHC in South Asia \nand is recognized for its longstanding innovative model of partnership between the government \ncontracting  out  health  service  delivery  and  service  providers  (mainly  nongovernment \norganizations [NGOs]).3 Although ADB has supported PHC in urban areas through the first and \nsecond  Urban  Primary  Health  Care  Projects,  significant  investment  is  still  needed  to  enhance \nservice delivery, reduce health inequalities, and strengthen institutional sustainability. 4 \n \n4. \nThe project has been filling a vacuum created by the lack of urban public primary health \ninfrastructure  and  limited  primary  health  services  by  (i)  increasing  the  access  of  target \nbeneficiaries,  especially  from  poor  households,  to  the  essential  service  package5 provided  by \nservice providers; (ii) providing 25.5 million services to some 23.5 million client contacts, of which \n74% were female and 26% male at midterm review in November 2015; (iii) constructing a network \nof over 180 health facilities and 224 satellite clinics nationwide run by about 3,000 health workers; \n(iv) building experience in the management and contracting of health service delivery by service \n\n                                                \n1  Financing partners: The Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2012.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed Loan, Technical Assistance Grant, and Administration of Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for \nthe Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project. Manila. \n\n3   PPP exists where the urban local government enters into a long-term contract with a service provider selected after \na competitive bidding process, for providing a specified set of health services in a public health facility and achieving \na  specified  income  generation  target,  in  which  the  service  provider  bears  significant  risk  and  management \nresponsibility.  \n\n4   ADB.  1996.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second Urban Primary Health Care Project. \nManila. \n\n5  The health package is described in Annex 10 of the Project Administration Manual (PAM, accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fproviders;  and  (v) strengthening  procurement,  financial  management,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation systems.  \n \n5. \nExperience and lessons learned from the current project. The project is demonstrating \ngood  results.  The  independent  midterm  review  in  November  2015  observed  that  through  the \nproject,  the  Local  Government  Division  (LGD),  the  executing  agency,  effectively  provides \nleadership to the country\u2019s efforts in finding scalable models for urban PHC delivery through urban \nlocal bodies (ULBs). The review also stated that the project merits continuation and expansion to \n(i) meet growing demand for health care in urban areas and (ii) contribute significantly to continue \nproviding leadership to support the country\u2019s plans to deliver urban PHC sustainably. A study has \nshown that the project\u2019s modality of contracting service delivery is an effective and efficient means \nto  extend  service  coverage. 6 An  impact  evaluation  analysis  identified  positive  effects  of  the \nsecond phase project on key health outcomes such as antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, \nand diarrhea and acute respiratory infection in children.7 Apart from the partnership model, the \ncurrent  project  has  incorporated  several  innovative  features  such  as  (i) pilot  testing  of  green \nclinics with solar panel renewable energy; (ii) establishing a health and demographic surveillance \nsystem to improve health information on the urban poor;8 (iii) being highly inclusive, where 80% \nof curative services are for women and girls, and 30% of services are provided free for the poor; \nand (iv) communities actively leading urban health coordination committees (UHCCs). \n \nDespite  this  progress,  further  measures  are  needed  to  enhance  the  existing  setup  by \n6. \nharnessing the project\u2019s momentum. The proposed additional financing will cover the cost of the \n5-year extension to assist the government to (i) strengthen local health systems and capacities \nwith an integrated and long-term perspective toward a sustainable urban primary health sector, \n(ii)  continue  and  scale  up  the  PPP  modality  of  contracting  service  providers,  and  (iii)  provide \neffective support to decentralized project management. It will also expand on previous efforts in \nclimate change mitigation through solar panels for \u201cgreen clinics\u201d to include both climate change \nmitigation  and  adaptation  measures  such  as  (i)  conducting  climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessments;  (ii)  adopting  climate-resilient  infrastructure  including  solar  panels,  rain-water \nharvesting system, and flood protection drain system; (iii) training on medical waste management \nand  disposal;  and  (iv)  building  capacity  on  climate  change  resilience  (water  and  electricity \nconservation, disaster and emergency response, disease surveillance, and outbreak response).9 \n \n7. \nSustainability. The sustainability of health services will be ensured by strengthening the \nLGD\u2019s Urban Development Wing into a functional, fully staffed permanent institutional body; and \nestablishing a dedicated revenue budget head for urban primary health under the Ministry of Local \nGovernment, Rural Development and Cooperatives (MOLGRDC) from which government budget \nallocations  will  supplement  city  and  municipal  health  financing.  The  ULBs  will  also  ensure \nfinancing,  staff,  and  institutional  arrangements  to  be  sustained  accordingly.  After  project \ncompletion,  health  services  will  mainly  continue  to  be  contracted  out,  and  where  the  capacity \nexists, selected local governments may deliver services by themselves. Government commitment \nand prioritization at all levels is required to ensure that adequate financing and institutions will be \nin place.  \n\n                                                \n6  A.

Tropical Medicine and International Health. 18 (7). pp. 861\u201370. \n7  M.L. Albis, S.K. Bhadra, and B. Chin. Forthcoming. Impact evaluation of contracting primary health care services in \n\nurban Bangladesh.  \n\n8   The Health and Demographic Surveillance System covers selected slums of Dhaka (North & South) and Gazipur \nCity Corporations and provides information on the urban poor related to migration, noncommunicable disease, and \nits risk factors, gender, and health care costs. \n\n9  Climate risks include flooding, salt water intrusion, rising temperature, and spread of infectious diseases. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fGovernment priorities. The additional financing will support the sector framework, the \n8. \nNational  Urban  Health  Strategy  (NUHS),  and  its  forthcoming  action  plan. 10  The  continued \nassistance of ADB reflects the priorities of the government\u2019s Seventh Five-Year Plan, FY2016\u2013\nFY2020,  which  emphasizes  the  need  for  PHC  of  urban  residents,  including  slum  and  street \ndwellers.11 The plan highlights the need to manage urban health and build a coalition of interests \naround  one  harmonized  approach  for  greater  coordination  between  the  MOLGRDC  and  the \nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW). City and municipal ward level committees and \nthe  development  partners\u2019  forum  are  progressively  improving  coordination.  Local  government \nhealth officials will play a larger stewardship role for all actors in the health space (public, private, \nNGOs, charitable providers, and development partners). \n \n9. \nAlignment with ADB priorities. The project will contribute to Sustainable Development \nGoals 3 and 11;12 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020 and country \npartnership  strategy  for  Bangladesh,  2016\u20132020,  which  identify  urban  health  as  a  specific \npriority.13 The proposed ADB support is also aligned with Strategy 2030, which emphasizes the \nneed for ADB to expand health operations to support developing member countries to achieve \nuniversal  health coverage  as  well  as facilitate  PPPs  and  engagement  with  the  NGOs  and  civil \nsociety organizations to leverage and improve results.14 \n \n10. \nAdditional financing eligibility criteria. The additional financing meets ADB\u2019s eligibility \ncriteria. The overall project (i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially \nsound;  (ii)  is  accorded  high  priority  by  the  government;  and  (iii)  is  consistent  with  the  current \nproject\u2019s  development  objectives,  the  government\u2019s  priorities,  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy,  which  prioritizes  urban  PHC,  governance  improvement,  and  climate-  and  disaster-\nresilient infrastructure and services. The current project has been rated on track since it started, \nand implementation progress and results are satisfactory. As of 6 July 2018, cumulative contract \nawards are $64.1 million (96% achieved) and disbursements are $60.2 million (90% achieved) \nagainst the net loan and grant amount of $66.9 million. Overall physical  progress is 95%. The \ncurrent  project  has  complied  with  all  safeguard  requirements  and  adequately  managed  risks. \nProject readiness for additional financing is high. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  improved  health,  nutrition,  and  family \nplanning status of the urban population, particularly the poor, women, and children, aligned with \nthe government\u2019s NUHS. The project will have the following outcome: sustainable good quality \nurban PHC services are provided in the project areas and target the poor and the needs of women \nand children.15 \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n10 Government of Bangladesh, MOLGRDC, Local Government Division (LGD). 2014.

The  additional  financing  will \n(i) strengthen  the  LGD\u2019s  Urban  Development  Wing  to  effectively  coordinate  urban  health;  (ii) \nestablish a revenue budget head in the MOLGRDC to manage PHC and operate and maintain \nPHC  facilities  sustainably;  (iii)  facilitate  revenue  budget  allocations  to  supplement  city  and \nmunicipal health financing; (iv) facilitate coordination among the LGD, MOHFW, and development \npartners  under  one  harmonized  approach  as  detailed  in  the  NUHS;  and  (v) support  city  and \nmunicipality health departments to develop organograms and reorganization plans and integrate \nwith other determinants of health and related climate-sensitive subsectors (e.g., water, sanitation, \nand waste management) in a holistic manner to improve public health. Improved coordination will \nenhance the governance and stewardship roles of the LGD and MOHFW in key strategic areas \n(quality assurance, referral linkages, human resources, and information systems). The additional \nfinancing  will  continue  to  support  mapping  of  all  health  facilities  in  the  project  areas,  including \nthose under the MOHFW and private service providers, to help develop effective referral systems \nand identify gaps in coverage, particularly for the poor, slum, and floating populations. Information \nsystems will be improved by developing a real-time patient management system that will be linked \nto the national health management information system and automatically generate routine reports \nto support performance monitoring and management.  \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Accessibility, quality, and utilization of urban primary health care services \n(with  a  focus  on  the  poor,  women,  and  children)  improved  through  public\u2013private \npartnership.  The  additional  financing  will  (i)  expand  coverage  to  additional  one  city  and  10 \nmunicipalities;16 (ii) continue provision of PHC through contracting out to service providers; and \n(iii) construct  additional  eight  comprehensive  reproductive  health  care  centers  and  24  PHC \ncenters where such facilities do not exist in the project areas, and modernize existing facilities. \nPartnership  agreements  will  be  further  refined  to  give  greater  emphasis  on  the  quality  of  the \nservice provider compared to the cost proposed. The service providers will deliver essential health \nservices in the partnership areas where females use about 80% of the services.17 New medical \nequipment and in-service training for health care personnel will be provided to enhance the quality \nof services. The additional financing will continue to support semiannual independent monitoring \nof  service  providers\u2019  performance  and  quality  improvement,  using  an  Integrated  Supervisory \nInstrument  covering  health  service  delivery  and  quality,  coverage  of  the  poor,  as  well  as \nmanagement  and  accounting  practices.  A  behavior  change  communication  and  marketing \nprogram aligned with an updated behavior change communication strategy will engage audiences \nthrough  an  innovative,  interactive,  multi-platform  campaign; 18 empower  and  build  capacity  of \nservice providers, through participatory approaches, to develop and implement local media plans; \n\n                                                \n16 As well as the existing 10 city corporations and four municipalities covering about 9.5 million people, the additional \nfinancing  will  include  Chattogram  City  Corporation  and  10  selected  municipalities  that  have  a  large  poor  and \nvulnerable  population  and  no  medical  colleges  or  300  bed  hospitals.  In  total,  11  city  corporations  and \n14 municipalities (16.7 million people) will be covered by the project. These are listed in Annex 4 of the PAM. \n\n17 Additional focus on child and maternal nutrition, neonatal health, adolescent health, and noncommunicable diseases. \n18 Television, radio, newspaper, mobile, social media, website, and interpersonal communication through door-to-door, \n\nclinic, community theater, and community events. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fand sustain the project by strengthening transition advocacy with the LGD and ULBs. To assess \nthe  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  project,  including  across  various  geographical  areas, \ncommunities, and interventions, baseline and end line surveys will be conducted. \n  \nOutput  3:  Effective  support  for  decentralized  project  management  provided.  The \n15. \nadditional  financing  will  provide  (i)  policy  support  (planning  and  coordination)  for  institutional \nstrengthening actions at central and ULB levels; (ii) technical support to the project management \nunit  (PMU)  and  ULBs  in  procurement,  monitoring,  financial  management,  implementing  the \ngender  action  plan,  and monitoring  environmental  and  social  safeguards;  and  (iii)  training  and \ncapacity development for the LGD, city and municipal health departments, and service providers. \nTo empower the ULBs and ensure more ownership and sustainability of urban PHC, the project \nwill further devolve the management and implementation responsibilities of the PMU in the LGD \nto  project  implementing  units  in  the  health  departments  of  selected  ULBs,  which  will  receive \nfocused guidance and technical support. \n \nD. \n \n16. \nThe project is estimated to cost $142 million, including additional financing of $110 million \nfrom ADB (Table 1).

A  PMU  headed  by  a  full-time  project  director  in  the  LGD  will  provide  the  technical, \nadministrative,  and  logistical  support  required  for  implementation.  An  interministerial  national \nproject  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the  LGD,  will  continue  to  oversee  the \noverall project implementation. In addition to the existing 14 project implementing units in ULB \nhealth departments, 11 additional units will be created to oversee implementation in project cities \nand municipalities. The UHCCs will be set up in each project city or municipality to coordinate \nfield activities and stakeholder participation, and will be chaired by ULB chief executive officers. \nCities and municipalities are divided into wards for administrative purposes, so ward UHCCs co-\nchaired  by  ward  commissioners  and  zonal  health  officers  will  be  created  and  include \nrepresentation from local stakeholders.

The economic rationale for investing in the additional financing lies \n22. \nin improved health outcomes through improved access to effective, efficient, and sustainable PHC \nservices. The project is pro-poor in its focus on addressing the health care needs of the urban \npoor.  The  economic  benefits  accrue  from  (i)  savings  from  reduced  household  out-of-pocket \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nexpenditures and (ii) benefits from disability-adjusted life years averted. The economic internal \nrate  of  return  on  the  project  investment  is  estimated  to  be  9.5%,  with  a  net  present  value  of \n$8.5 million over a 20-year (2018\u20132037) benefit stream. The economic internal rate of return was \ntested  through  sensitivity  analysis,  which  showed  that  even  under  adverse  changes  to \nassumptions, the additional financing remains economically viable. \n \n23. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  government  needs  to  allocate  additional  funds  after  the \nproject to sustain the current level of service coverage. A total of Tk1.3 billion per year  will be \nrequired as recurrent expenditure from 2023. The financial sustainability of the project and the \nsector will be ensured through specific interventions, including the implementation of the NUHS \nand revitalizing the Urban Primary Health Care Sustainability Fund.22 The LGD is committed to \nsustaining urban PHC activities. In this regard, the LGD will develop a revenue (nondevelopment) \nbudget line for urban PHC and provide supplementary financing for PHC (salaries, administration, \noverhead, and service delivery) from block grant allocations of its budget to the ULBs. This will \nstrengthen the financial capacity of the ULBs and encourage the ULBs to improve the provision \nof PHC services. The ULBs are encouraged to raise revenue to match block grants, which will \nenable them to continue PHC services after the end of the project as well as create an incentive \nfor them to enhance PHC services. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nProject-related governance risks have been assessed as part of the midterm review and \nadditional financing processing in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement and financial management \nrequirements. The assessments found that an adequate management system and staff capacity \nwere established in the PMU under the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project.23 \nIn terms of procurement rules and procedures, the proposed additional financing is rated low risk \nsince the PMU has extensive experience in procuring goods, works, and consulting services in \naccordance  with  ADB  procedures  and \nrequirements.  On  procurement  capacity  and \nimplementation,  the  risk  rating  is  moderate  due  to  the  volume  of  procurement.  The  financial \nmanagement risk rating is moderate and remains manageable because of the measures provided \nin the financial management manual, the proposed engagement of additional staff in the PMU, \nand  conducting  independent  biennial  fiduciary  reviews,  supported  by  targeted  technical \nassistance to provide capacity development and to enhance financial monitoring and reporting \nusing accounting software. \n \n25. \nSince  the  additional  financing  will  expand  geographic  coverage  and  aims  to  develop \nsustainable capacity in ULBs for delivering basic health services, the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan makes several recommendations to strengthen capacity both in the executing \nand implementing agencies and to improve procedures for efficient management and effective \ncontrol in financial management and procurement.24  \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  LGD,  MOLGRDC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \n\n                                                \n22 Government of Bangladesh, MOLGRDC, LGD.

In  addition  to  the  essential  services \nprovided, the additional financing will focus more on strengthening the present service delivery \nsystem,  building  on  the  good  results  of  the  current  project,  meeting  unmet  demands,  and \ndeveloping institutional self-reliance. Counseling for women, adolescents, and couples\u2014as well \nas  pre-marriage counseling,  addressing  noncommunicable  diseases,  reducing climate-induced \nailments,  and  building  and  promoting gender-friendly  structures\u2014will  receive  special  attention. \nThe  capacity  building,  behavior  change,  and  outreach  project  components  will  focus  on \nstrengthening  the  abilities  of  government  and  partner  service  providers  to  improve  access  to \nquality health services in slums and impoverished areas with a focus on the poor, women, and \nchildren. The gender action plan of this gender equity-categorized project has been enhanced to \npromote gender  equity  and  respond effectively  to  the  needs  voiced  by  women  in  underserved \nurban areas.25 \n \nD. \n \n28. \nEnvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  current \nproject\u2019s compliance with the safeguard requirements has been satisfactory and risks have been \nwell-managed.  The  project  remains  category  B  for  environment,  and  will  continue  to  construct \nnew health care centers, improve existing facilities, and enhance climate change resilience and \nmedical  waste  management.  It  is  not  expected  to  have  significant  or  irreversible  negative \nenvironmental impacts during construction or operation. Any environmental risks will be effectively \naddressed through proper mitigation measures with the updated environmental assessment and \nreview framework that has been prepared and disclosed because land and sites for project civil \nworks will be identified by the time implementation begins. The project remains category C for \nboth involuntary resettlement and tribes, minor races, ethnic sects, and community peoples.26 No \nland  acquisition  will  be  involved  because  land  required  will  be  either  government-owned  or \ndonated voluntarily. Existing project areas do not overlap with any areas inhabited by tribes, minor \nraces, ethnic sects, and community peoples. The project will screen new health care center sites \nto ensure social safeguard impacts do not occur.27 \n  \nE. \n \n29. \nThe  overall  risk  assessment  is  moderate  without  mitigation  and  low  with  mitigation. \nSignificant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 24). The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \nThe project will sensitize the importance of urban health and provide \nguidance and capacity building to enhance ownership by the ULBs \nand their commitments to increase resources for urban health. \n\nRisks \nSome city corporations and municipalities \nhave insufficient funds, human resources, \nand leadership to implement programs and \nstrategies for strengthening pro-poor urban \nprimary health care delivery services. \n\n                                                \n25 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Groups or population identified as indigenous peoples within the context of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nwill be referred to in this document as tribes, minor races, ethnic sects, and community peoples (following the request \nof the Government of Bangladesh). \n\n27 Resettlement, Tribes, Minor Races, Ethnic Sects, and Community Peoples Planning Framework set out in the PAM. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nCompeting needs and politically driven \ninterests in allocating resources to the ULBs. \nHigh turnover of service providers\u2019 \nmanagement, clinical, and counterpart staff. \n\nMitigating Measures \nImplementation of the NUHS Action Plan and the establishment of a \ndedicated revenue budget will create fiscal space for urban health. \n(i) The PMU will have additional staff and technical specialists to \nresponsively administer service providers\u2019 contracts.
