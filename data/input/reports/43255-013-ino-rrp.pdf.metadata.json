The project will be implemented in \na geographic slice of the PNPM Mandiri Program and will include about 600 rural communities \nin four provinces and 1,350 poor urban neighborhoods in 34 cities. The project is included in the \nIndonesia country operations business plan, 2010\u20132012.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe government requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to scale up ongoing \nassistance to the PNPM Mandiri scheme to (i) upgrade basic rural infrastructure in poor villages \nin  provinces  covered  by  ongoing  ADB-supported  projects,  and  (ii)  promote  community-driven \nsanitation  development  to  contribute  to  achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG) \ntarget to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to basic sanitation.  \n  \n4. \nPopulation below the poverty line in Indonesia declined by 1.51 million from 32.53 million \nin  March  2009  to  31.02  million  in  March  2010.    While  continued  poverty  reduction  during  a \nperiod  of  significant  external  uncertainties  is  a  good  achievement,  the  poverty  headcount \nremains  quite  large.  The  causes  of  poverty  include  lack  of  access  to  basic  services  (such  as \nhealth,  education,  safe  water,  and  sanitation);  absence  of  economic  opportunities;  limited \naccess  to  capital;  and  poor  rural  connectivity  and  infrastructure.  The  poor  are  vulnerable  to \nexternal shocks and the large numbers of \u201cnear poor\u201d are at risk of falling back into poverty in \nthe event of sickness, natural disaster, harvest failure, rising food prices, or economic recession.  \n  \nThe government has made poverty alleviation a development priority. The Medium-Term \n5. \nDevelopment  Plan  (RPJM),  2010\u20132014  targets  average  growth  of  6%\u20137%  per  year,  with  a \nreduction  in  the  poverty  rate  from  14.2%  in  2009  to  8%\u201310%  by  2014.  The  government\u2019s \nforemost poverty reduction program is PNPM Mandiri, which provides assistance to poor rural \nand  urban  communities  nationwide  through  up  to  three  cycles  of  block  grants  for  improving \nessential  social  services  and  basic  infrastructure.  The  RPJM,  2010\u20132014  includes  PNPM \nMandiri  as  a  development  tool  to  accelerate  poverty  alleviation  with  an  indicative  budget \nallocation of $6,754 million over 5 years for seven PNPM programs.4  \n\n                                                 \n1   The  project  is  reflected  in  the  government\u2019s  blue  book  as  (i)  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  \u2013  National  Community \n\nEmpowerment Program, Phase 3; and (ii) Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project, Phase 1. \n\n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   ADB. 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Indonesia, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n4   PNPM programs included in the RPJM are the PNPM Urban ($664 million); PNPM Rural ($5,420 million); PNPM \nRegional  Infrastructure  for  Social  and  Economic  Development  ($132  million);  PNPM  Rural  Infrastructure \n($335 million); PNPM for sanitation\u2014SANIMAS ($37 million); PNPM for water supply and sanitation\u2014PANSIMAS \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nADB is supporting the government\u2019s PNPM Mandiri scheme through two projects: (i) the \n6. \nRural  Infrastructure  Support  to  the  PNPM  Mandiri  Project  (RIS-PNPM)  for  $50.0  million;5   and \n(ii) the RIS-PNPM Project II for $84.2 million.6  Both projects include assistance for community \nmobilization, and provide block grants to upgrade basic rural infrastructure in 2,160 villages in \nfour provinces (Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra7). More than 3.5 million poor people \nwill benefit from infrastructure improvements in their villages, including newly constructed roads \nand small bridges, upgraded footpaths and drainage, and improved sanitation and water supply \nfacilities. Building on lessons and achievements of both projects, the proposed new project will \nfollow a community-driven development approach.8  \n \n7. \nLimited access to rural infrastructure. Infrastructure investments, which accounted for \nmore than 6% of gross domestic product before 1997, fell to a low of 2% in 2000 and have only \nreached  3%  in  2009,  reflecting  a  sharp  decline  in  public  and  private  spending.  As  a  result, \ninfrastructure  conditions  in  many  rural  areas  are  alarming.  Rural  roads  are  deteriorating \nbecause of inadequate maintenance. About 50% of rural villages are not connected by asphalt \nroads and more than 10% of all villages are inaccessible even by four-wheel-drive vehicles at \ncertain  times  of  the  year.  Poor  roads  or  no  roads  mean  that  government  services  are \ninaccessible;  higher  transportation  costs  cause  an  additional  burden  for  poor  and  remote \ncommunities.  In  addition  to  poor  road  conditions,  infrastructure  needs  related  to  water  supply \nneed special consideration. While the MDG target set for access to safe water sources in rural \nareas  is  65.8%  of  households,  only  45.7%  of  rural  households  have  sustainable  access  to \nimproved water sources. The percentage of rural communities with access to sanitation facilities \nis even more alarming\u2014only 34%. Furthermore, it is estimated that about 90 million people in \nrural  communities  have  no  access  to  electricity.  The  four  project  provinces  (Jambi,  Lampung, \nRiau, and South Sumatra) have high rural poverty and unequal access to infrastructure, with a \ntotal  of  almost  4 million  poor  people  in  2009.  South  Sumatra  (16%)  and  Lampung  (20%)  had \npoverty incidence well above the national average.  \n \nLimited  access  to  sanitation.  While  Indonesia  has  generally  made  good  progress \n8. \ntoward accelerating achievement of the MDGs, the MDG targets for access to basic sanitation \nneed  special  attention.  The  percentage  of  Indonesians  with  access  to  improved  sanitation \nfacilities  has  doubled  since  1993,  but  progress  has  been  slower  than  in  other  countries  in  the \nregion at similar levels of economic development. In 2009, only 51% of the national population \nhad access to improved sanitation, while the MDG target for accessing basic sanitation facilities \nis 62.37% of the population by 2015.9 The poor often do not have access to safe water sources \n                                                                                                                                                          \n($469  million);  and  PNPM  Support  for  Poor  and  Disadvantaged  Areas\u2014SPADA  ($277  million).  In  2010,  the \ngovernment increased the allocation for PNPM Mandiri to $1.3 billion (from $1.1 billion in 2009). \n\n5   ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n\n7  The RIS PNPM has been completed and closed in mid 2011, while the RIS PNPM II is currently being implemented \n\nans scheduled for completion in late 2013. \n\n8   Key  lessons  from  previous  PNPM  initiatives  for  good  project  design  and  implementation  include  (i)  community \ncontrol  of  decision  making  over  resources  and  investment  choices;  (ii)  simple  and  transparent  funds  flow \narrangements with direct transfers to community accounts; (iii) comprehensive facilitation support, including social \nfacilitators  to  ensure  full  community  participation,  and  engineering  facilitators  to  oversee  technical  quality  of  civil \nworks;  (iv)  strong  accountability  procedures,  such  as  public  disclosure  of  budgets  and  contracts;  (v)  village \nmanagement  of  funds  and  procurement  matters;  and  (vi)  training  for  communities  in  establishing  effective \nmechanisms to operate and maintain new infrastructure. \n\n9   In  Indonesia,  sanitation  facilities  are  defined  as  those  that  provide  safe,  hygienic,  and  convenient  facilities  that \nprevent the user and the immediate environment from coming into contact with human excreta. Improved sanitation \nfacilities are defined to include flush and pour flush toilets that are linked to a piped sewer system or a septic tank. \nImproved  pit  latrines  with  a  slab  seal  and  ventilation  are  also  classified  as  improved  sanitation  facilities,  as  are \n\n\f3 \n\nand basic sanitation facilities, which has severe consequences for their health and livelihoods. \nWaterborne  diseases  have  a  high  cost  in  terms  of  health  among  those  without  access  to \nimproved water and sanitation. Two of the most important causes of mortality for children under \n5 years old are fecal-borne diseases, and waterborne diseases, including cholera, diarrhea, and \ntyphoid  fever,  which  are  linked  to  use  of  unprotected  water,  poor  sanitation,  and  inadequate \nawareness  among  communities  of  hygienic  practices.  Some  30%  of  Indonesians  suffer  from \nwaterborne diseases. \n \nEfforts  to  increase  basic  sanitation  coverage  are  complicated  by  population  growth, \n9. \nespecially  in  urban  areas  where  growth  rates  are  higher  than  the  national  rate.  At  the  current \nnational  population  growth  rate\u20141.3%  per  year\u2014an  additional  2.8  million  Indonesians  will \nrequire  basic  sanitation  facilities  every  year  from  now  until  2015,  adding  to  more  than \n100 million people currently without basic sanitation.  The main challenges to increasing access \nto improved sanitation are summarized below:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nThe regulatory framework for water supply and sanitation is less than adequate.  \nThe growth of urban populations has been greater than the development of water \nand  sanitation  infrastructure.  Investments  in  connection  rates  of  urban  water \nsupply  have  failed  to  keep  pace  with  the  growth  in  urban  populations  while  the \nuse of household on-site sanitation systems has not been accompanied by public \ninvestments in collection, treatment, and disposal infrastructure. \n\n(iii)  Community  awareness  of  the  importance  of  clean  water  use  and  sanitation \nremains  low.  While  almost  all  households  boil  water  for  drinking,  48%  of  such \nwater still contains E. coli.  \n\n(iv)  Responsibility for water and sanitation management has been devolved to local \ngovernments, but local capacity to ensure that adequate systems are in place or \noperating correctly is limited.  \n\n \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nCorresponding to the overall objective of PNPM Mandiri, the impact of the project will be \n10. \nreduced poverty in the project areas. The outcome will be improved access to service delivery \nand healthy livelihoods for the poor, near poor, and women in the project communities. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  strengthened  capacity  for  community  planning \n\n11. \nand development, (ii) improved rural basic infrastructure, and (iii) improved sanitation services. \n \n12. \nOutput  1:  Strengthened  capacity  for  community  planning  and  development.  The \nproject will support and strengthen community empowerment and capacity to prioritize, design, \nimplement, manage, and monitor community-based projects. Social mobilization and community \nfacilitation are crosscutting activities that will occur at all stages of the community empowerment \nprocess and are keys for ensuring pro-poor investments and sustainability. Following the PNPM \nMandiri guidelines, the project will deploy community facilitators10 to assist communities to carry \nout  poverty  mapping,  identify  problems  and  needs,  evaluate  community  implementation \ncapacity,  develop  efficient  planning  and  decision-making  processes,  establish  and  run \ncommunity  implementing  organizations  (CIOs),  formulate  development  plans  and  specific \ninvestment plans to be financed by block grants, prepare technical designs and implement civil \nworks,  and  formulate  and  implement  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  plans  to  ensure  the \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \ncomposting  toilets.  Unimproved  sanitation  facilities  include  toilets  that  drain  to  an  open  sewer,  ditch,  open  drain, \nstream, river or open field, pit latrines without slab coverings, buckets, and hanging toilets. \n\n10  The government will contract and finance community facilitators. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nsustainability  of  completed  facilities.  Community  facilitators  will  be  organized  in  teams,  each \nconsisting of facilitators for (i) social development, (ii) technical matters, and (iii) overall project \nmanagement. At least 30% of the facilitators will be women. As successfully implemented under \nthe ongoing RIS-PNPM projects, each participating community will work with the project through \na CIO (an existing village organization or a new project organization).11  \n \n13.  \nTo  assist  communities  in  rural  areas  to  design  and  implement  investments  plans  to \nupgrade basic infrastructure financed by block grants provided under output 2, facilitators will be \nrecruited  from  teams  engaged  under  ongoing  RIS-PNPM  projects.  The  executing  agency  will \nidentify experienced and well-performing facilitators to be employed under the project.  \n \n14. \nTo  assist  communities  in  urban  neighborhoods  to  establish  and  improve  sanitation \nfacilities  financed  by  block  grants  under  output  3,  the  executing  agency  will  engage  new \nfacilitators with good experience in participatory planning methods, community mobilization and \nempowerment, and specifically in community-based sanitation services. Facilitators assigned for \ncommunity  empowerment  will  be  trained  specifically  on  approaches  to  foster  sanitation  and \nhygiene behavioral changes. Facilitators assigned to provide technical guidance on community-\nbased sanitation will be trained on suitable and simple sanitation technologies and appropriate \nconstruction methods.  \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Improved  rural  basic  infrastructure  through  community  development \ngrants. Block grants12 will be provided to villages to upgrade basic infrastructure to meet local \nneeds  identified  by  the  village  community.  Consistent  with  the  PNPM  Mandiri  guidelines,  the \nmenu of investment opportunities for communities will be open except for a short negative list of \nactivities prohibited by the government or ADB policies. Selection of community investments will \nbe based on the guidelines prepared for ongoing RIS-PNPM projects. The project will allocate \ntwo cycles of block grants of Rp250 million each for about 600 villages. After the completion of \nthe  first  cycle  of  block  grants,  the  executing  agency,  assisted  by  the  district  and  provincial \nproject implementation units (DPIUs and PPIUs), will carry out a village performance evaluation. \nOnly villages that are evaluated as good performers will continue to receive the second cycle of \nblock  grants.  Poorly  performing  villages  will  be  excluded  for  the  second  round  of  block  grants \nand replaced by new villages.  \n \nOut of the 600 targeted villages, about 200 villages have already received one cycle of \n16. \nblock  grants  under  the  overall  PNPM  program  financed  by  the  government\u2019s  own  resources. \nThe remaining 400 villages, selected from a list of the poorest villages in the country, have not \nreceived  any  PNPM  support.  All  600  villages  are  located  in  the  215  subdistricts  in  Jambi, \nLampung,  Riau,  and  South  Sumatra  covered  by  the  ongoing  RIS-PNPM  projects.  Villages  will \nbe  selected  based  on  poverty  incidence  ranking  using  the  latest  available  data.    The  list  of \nvillages  will  be  confirmed  by  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of  People  Welfare  and  verified  by \nprovincial and district governments to ensure that the poorest villages are selected and that no \nbetter-off villages are included. The executing agency will replace selected villages that are not \nwilling to participate or have been affected by force majeure or disaster (which would encumber \ntheir participation) with other poor villages within the project subdistricts.  \n  \n                                                 \n11 Overall CIO membership will comprise at least 40% women. The CIO representative committee will consist of five \nmembers,  including  at  least  two  women.  The  CIO  will  be  legalized  by  the  village  or  neighborhood  head  and \nregistered  with  the  kecamatan  (subdistrict)  head,  which  is  a  prerequisite  for  opening  a  CIO  bank  account.  CIO \ndecisions will be validated in village or neighborhood meetings with at least 60% household attendance. \n\n12 Under this project, a block grant is defined as a fixed sum of money granted by the national government, which is \ntransferred in three tranches to a selected community that has met certain criteria for the financing of construction \nof (i) basic rural infrastructure, or (ii) sanitation facilities in urban areas. A cycle of block grant consists of at least \nthree block grants to a selected community. \n\n\f5 \n\nFollowing the approach established under the ongoing RIS-PNPM projects, block grants \n17. \nwill be transferred directly to community bank accounts managed by the CIOs. The CIO will take \nthe  lead  in  developing  investment  plans,  with  assistance  from  community  facilitators  and  the \nDPIUs.  After  the  village  investment  plans,  which  include  the  final  technical  designs  and  cost \nestimates, have been approved at a village assembly and submitted to the DPIU for approval, a \ncontract will be executed between the CIO and the DPIU and the first installment of the block \ngrant will be released. Communities will undertake civil works with technical guidance from the \ncommunity facilitators, DPIUs, and project management consultants. The proposed project will \nutilize the same funds flow mechanism for block grants as the ongoing RIS-PNPM projects.  \n \n18. \nOutput  3:  Improved  sanitation  services  through  neighborhood  development \ngrants.  The  project  will  provide  block  grants  of  about  Rp350  million  to  about  1,350  urban \nneighborhoods  in  34  cities  in  the  provinces  of  Central  Java,  DI  Yogyakarta,  East  Java,  South \nSulawesi,  and  North  Sulawesi  to  improve  community-driven  sanitation  services  including \n(i) construction  of  public  bathing,  toilets,  and  washing  facilities;  (ii)  improvement  of  communal \nsewerage systems and waste treatment;13 and (iii) improvement of disposal or reuse systems.14 \nTo ensure that community sanitation facilities established under the project will be integrated in \ncity  development  plans  and  linked  to  city  sewerage  systems,  only  neighborhoods  located  in \ncities  with  an  approved  city  sanitation  strategy  will  participate  in  the  project.  By  2011,  local \ngovernments in the project provinces are expected to have endorsed strategies for 43 cities. To \nassure  support  from  the  respective  city  administrations,  local  governments  will  provide  a  firm \nletter  of  confirmation  documenting  their  readiness  to  participate  in  the  project  and  their \ncontributions to support community-led sanitation development.  \n  \nGiven  the  limited  community  awareness  on  the  importance  of  sanitation  and  hygiene, \n19. \nand  the  lack  of  understanding  on  community-driven  sanitation  technologies,  the  project  will \nallow  sufficient  time  for  the  community  empowerment  process.  Facilitators  will  assist  local \ncommunities to develop their own action plans for sustainable sanitation services and improved \nhygiene and heath environments. The process will start with the establishment of a long list of \ncommunities showing interest to participate. Based on selection criteria,15 neighborhoods will be \nchosen  to  participate  in  the  project.  Facilitators  will  help  community  members  to  (i)  identify \nissues  and  needs  related  to  health,  hygiene,  and  sanitation;  (ii)  formulate  inclusive  and \nsustainable sanitation plans with investment plans to be financed by block grants; (iii) prepare \ntechnical  designs;  (iv) implement  civil  works;  and  (v)  formulate  and  implement  O&M  plans  to \nensure the sustainability of completed facilities.  \n \n20. \n The  implementation  mechanism  will  be  similar  to  output  2  and  follow  good  practices \nestablished  under  RIS-PNPM  projects.  Each  participating  neighborhood  will  work  through  a \nCIO; block grants will be transferred directly to community bank accounts; procurement process \nand  fund  flow  mechanisms  will  be  in  line  with  procedures  described  under  output  2  and \nestablished under RIS-PNPM projects.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13 Treatment systems could include communal septic tanks, bio-digesters, baffled reactors, anaerobic filters, ponds.  \n14 This could include river disposal, sludge drying, use as fertilizer, and sucking by sludge trucks. \n15 Neighborhoods  will  be  selected  based  on  the  following:  (i)  the  neighborhood  shall  be  located  in  cities  with  an \napproved  City  Sanitation  Strategy;  (ii)  the  community  members  within  the  neighborhood  shall  have  agreed  to \ndesign  and  implement  sanitations  facilities;  (iii)  the  CIO  for  the  neighborhood  shall  have  been  established  and \naccountability and governance mechanism shall have been in place; and (iv.) the community members within the \nneighborhood  shall  indicate  their  willingness  to  improve  overall  hygiene  and  health  environments  in  the \nneighborhood. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nD. \n \n21. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \non  any  undisbursed  amount  of  the  loan,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the \ndraft loan agreement. The project is estimated to cost $135.6 million equivalent, which includes \ncontributions  from  (i)  the  central  government  of  $21.5  million,  (ii)  local  governments  of \n$6.1 million, and (ii) beneficiaries of $8.0 million.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment and Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nLocal \n\nGovernments  Beneficiaries \n\nItem \nBase Costs \nBlock grants for rural basic infrastructure  \nBlock grants for urban sanitation  \nBeneficiary contributions \nCommunity facilitation \nTraining and workshops \nCommunity preparation (roadshows) \nConsulting services \nProject management \nTaxes and Duties \nContingenciesa  \nFinancial Chargesb  \n\nTotalc \nShare of Total (%) \n\nADB \n \n33.5 \n52.5 \n0 \n0 \n4.1 \n0 \n7.9 \n0 \n0 \n2.0 \n0 \n100.0  \n73.8 \n\nCentral \nGovernment \n \n0 \n0 \n0 \n10.3 \n0 \n1 \n0 \n0.7 \n1.0 \n1.5 \n7.0 \n21.5 \n15.9 \n\n \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n5.3 \n0.3 \n0.5 \n0 \n6.1 \n4.5 \n\n \n0 \n0 \n8.0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n8.0 \n5.9 \n\nTotal \n \n33.5 \n52.5 \n8.0 \n10.3 \n4.1 \n1.0 \n7.9 \n6.0 \n1.3 \n4.0 \n7.0 \n135.6 \n100 \n\n \n\na   Physical  contingencies  computed  at  10%  for  civil  works  and  5%  for  training  and  workshops.

The  DGHS  will  also  act  as  the  key \nproject implementing agency. The project will be implemented over 4 years, from January 2012 \nto December 2015. In the four provinces of Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra under \noutput  2,  the  project  will  use  the  existing  implementation  arrangements  established  under  the \nongoing  RIS-PNPM  projects;  and  continue  working  with  the  established  district  and  province \nimplementation units. At new project locations under output 3, where sanitation-related project \nactivities  will  be  implemented,  the  DGHS  will  establish  project  management  units  at  the \nrespective  city  administrations.  Tasks  of  these  new  PPIUs  and  DPIUs  will  comprise  the  same \nresponsibilities  assigned  to  PPIUs  or  DPIUs  under  the  RIS-PNPM  projects.  The  MOH  will  be \nclosely  involved  in  the  preparation  of  training  and  awareness  strategies  to  promote  sanitation \nand hygiene behavioral changes. \n \n\n                                                 \n16  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f7 \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n\n(iii)   Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Project implementation unit \n\nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJanuary 2012\u2013December 2015 \n31 December 2015 \n\nOversight body for the National Program for Community Empowerment \n \nDirectorate General of Human Settlements (DGHS), within the Ministry of \nPublic Works (MPW) \nDGHS . \nCentral project management unit, DGHS, MPW, 5 staff  \n\nProvincial project implementation units (PPIUs) in nine participating provinces, \n3\u20135 staff in each PPIU \n\nDistrict implementation unit in 71 districts and cities, 3\u20135 staff in each unit \n\nProcurement \n\n2,550 contracts \n\n$86.0 million \n\nCommunity \nProcurement  \n3,015 person-months \nNone \n\n$7.9 million \n\nConsulting services \nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement  \n\nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nreplenished,  and \n\n23. \nExcept as ADB may otherwise agree, the borrower shall establish immediately after the \neffective  date,  an  imprest  account  at  the  Bank  of  Indonesia.

In partnership with ongoing initiatives, the TA seeks to (i) strengthen the quality \nof community facilitation to improve infrastructure built under the PNPM by consolidating training \nmodules and materials related to community mobilization and technical matters associated with \ncommunity-constructed  infrastructure  (including  affordable  and  replicable  technologies  for \ncommunity-driven  sanitation  development);  (ii)  promote  demand-driven  public  and  private \ntraining supply, including development of strategies to establish quality assessment schemes for \ntraining modules, trainers, and training providers, and to procure training services from private \nsector  providers;  and  (iii)  develop  strategies  to  scale  up  and  anchor  sanitation-related  training \nand advocacy.  \n \nTo  assess  impacts  of  sanitation  interventions  and  guide  future  strategies  to  advance \n25. \ncommunity-driven  sanitation,  the  TA  will  include  a  baseline  survey  on  sanitation  in  selected \nneighborhoods at the project start and carry out subsequent impact assessments after the first \nand second years. The TA is estimated to cost $1.0 million, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  in-kind  support  of  about  $500,000.  To  support  activities  under  the  TA,  UNICEF  has \nindicated  that  it  will  provide  national  and  international  consulting  services  to  assist  in \n\n \n\n\fconsolidating  training  modules  and  materials,  preparing  a  certification  scheme  for  training \nproviders  and  trainers,  and  developing  advocacy  strategies  to  promote  community-based \nsanitation.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\ntraditional \n\nlocal  government  unit  costs  and \n\n26. \nThe  expected  economic  benefits  of  the  project  are  significant  and  include  (i)  improved \npublic  health  status  and  reduced  per  capita  costs  for  health  care  treatment  as  a  result  of  the \nincreased  coverage  of  sanitation  services  and  improved  hygiene,  particularly  in  densely \npopulated  urban  neighborhoods  of  participating  cities;  (ii)  reduction  in  pollution;  (iii) sustained \nimpacts on the economies of participating villages by improving essential rural infrastructure and \naccess to basic services; and (iv) considerable short-term employment generation.  \n \n27. \nProject  interventions  will  be  identified  by  community  members  through  a  participatory \ncommunity-driven  development  (CDD)  process.  CDD  approaches  provide  good  quality \ncommunity-level  infrastructure  at significantly  lower  costs  than  technically  comparable  projects \n(non-CDD)  modes  of  government  contracting.  Evaluations  of  CDD \nusing \ninfrastructure  projects  using \nlocal  contractor  costs \ndemonstrated  that  the  investment  costs  of  CDD-provided  infrastructure  were  on  average  only \n63.7% of local government costs.  \n \n28. \nLocal  manual  labor  will  largely  carry  out  the  implementation  of  civil  works  financed  by \nblock  grants.  The  project  is  projected  to  generate  about  6  million  person-days  of  short-term \nemployment  at  an  average  wage  rate  of  $5  per  day,  and  additional  short-term  income  of \n$30.0 million.  As  this  employment  is  largely  provided  in  the  agricultural  off-season,  it  has \nparticular benefits for reducing unemployment  and vulnerability among the poor. There is also \nevidence that increased demand for manual labor has a broader impact in raising the wages of \nunskilled workers outside the project areas, which contributes to poverty reduction.   \n \n29. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  have  significant  impacts  on  the  economies  of  participating \ncommunities.  Similar  types  of  investments  have  been  shown  to  yield  an  average  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  28%\u201368%.  Economic  benefits  arise  from  opening  access  to  markets \nand  lowering  transport  costs  in  the  case  of  rural  roads  and  bridges,  increased  incomes, \nadditional  crop  cycles  from  improved  irrigation,  and  time  saved  in  collecting  water  and  health \nbenefits from water and sanitation projects. Overall, project investments are expected to benefit \nmore than 1.3 million people in more than 270,000 households.  \n\nB. \n\n \nGovernance \n\n30. \nCommunity-based  planning  mechanisms  are  the  key  to  instituting  good  governance \npractices. The project will strengthen the ability of communities to articulate their needs and to \nseek support for their development plans, and will improve the respective district governments\u2019 \nability to respond to the demands of poor communities. As the project will target poor villages \nand urban neighborhoods, capacity building activities will directly benefit the poor by providing \nthem  with  the  means  to  draw  the  attention  and  resources  of  local  governments  to  their \ndevelopment needs.  \n \n31. \nPrevious  community  development  projects  indicate  a  risk  of  elite  capture.  This  risk  is \nminimized  by  several  features  of  the  project  design,  including  (i)  community  poverty  mapping; \n(ii)  establishment  of  CIOs  with  representation  of  women,  minority,  and  marginalized  groups \namong  the  community  representatives;  and  (iii)  transparent  mechanisms  of  publicly  displaying \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\ndecision  making  processes,  tender  documents,  fund  transfers  and  disbursements  of  block \ngrants,  and  progress  of  civil  works.  All  civil  works  will  be  contracted  to  the  CIOs  and  will  be \nundertaken primarily through manual labor. This will help ensure that the jobs generated by the \nproject are filled by community members. Infrastructure projects involving procurement of large \namounts of goods and services for civil works may be prone to corruption. To a large extent, this \nwill  be  mitigated \nthe  planning,  oversight,  and \nimplementation  of  the  civil  works.  In  addition,  the  existing  financial  management  systems  and \nfiduciary  controls  under  PNPM  Mandiri,  which  have  been  developed  with  assistance  from \ninternational  development  partners,  are  sound  and  have  adequate  checks  and  balances  to \nminimize  corruption  risks.  Finally,  the  project\u2019s  complaints  and  problems  handling  unit  will \nreview and address any grievances of project stakeholders in relation to the project, any of the \nservice providers, or any person responsible for carrying out the project.  \n\nthrough  community  management  of \n\n32. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n33. \nThe  project  will  target  poor  communities  in  less  developed  villages  and  urban \nneighborhoods  that  lack  basic  services  and  infrastructure.  The  selected  villages  and \nneighborhoods  will  have  higher  than  average  poverty  levels  and  lower  than  average \nachievement levels for MDGs. Improvements in basic infrastructure will improve income-earning \nopportunities and increase the availability and accessibility of education and health services for \nthe  rural  poor  and  near  poor.  Improved  sanitation  and  cleaner  environments  resulting  from \nproject  activities  in  poor  neighborhoods  will  reduce  diseases  linked  to  unsafe  water  and  poor \nhygiene, and will thus contribute to improving the health of the poor. This benefit will particularly \naccrue to infants and children, who are more vulnerable and suffer more frequently and severely \nfrom  diseases  caused  by  poor  sanitation  and  hygiene  practices.  A  gender  action  plan,  which \nhas  been  included in  the  project  design,  aims  to  enhance women\u2019s  ability  to  participate  in  the \ndecision-making process and to ensure that women and men in the project sites benefit equally \nfrom increased access to improved basic infrastructure and social services.  \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n34. \nLand acquisition and resettlements. The project has been classified category B as the \nscope  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  expected  to  be  insignificant.  In  urban \nneighborhoods,  the  project  might  require  limited  land  acquisition  occasionally  for  small \ncommunity  sanitation  facilities,  but  will  not  entail  any  resettlement  of  people,  relocation  of \nhouses, or significant impact upon productive land or other productive assets. It is expected that \nsmall  land  acquisitions  will  be  provided  by  project  beneficiaries  voluntarily.  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) and its requirements will be adopted if any compensation is needed in \ncase  of land  acquisition.  Safeguard  specialists  at  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels  have \nbeen included in the consultant packages. The resettlement framework has been prepared.17 \n \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  environmental  category  B.  Overall,  the  project \n35. \nwill  have  significant  positive  impacts  on  the  quality  of  life  and  environment  of  the  project \ncommunities. Because of the small scale of expected civil works, most of the expected negative \neffects  are  site-specific,  short-term  and  temporary,  and  easily  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels. \nThe environmental assessment and review framework has been prepared.18  \n                                                 \n17  Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  \n36. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  negative  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples. It will not discriminate against them or other marginalized groups. Following \nCDD  principles,  the  project  will  include  opportunities  for  screening  project  impacts  on \nindigenous  groups  and  incorporating  mitigation  measures,  if  any,  into  the  overall  design  and \nimplementation of any investment. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the \nproject has been classified category C.19  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  project  overall  risks  are  assessed  to  be  medium.
