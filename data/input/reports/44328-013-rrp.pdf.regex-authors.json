THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Uplands Irrigation and Water Resources Management \nSector Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will help the Government of Cambodia increase agricultural production by \nrehabilitating, modernizing, and climate-proofing selected irrigation systems in Kampong Thom \nand Battambang provinces. Subprojects will be undertaken to (i) enhance the efficiency and \nclimate resilience of irrigation systems, and (ii) improve water resource management by building \nthe capacity of government agencies and of farmer water user communities (FWUCs) so that \nthey can operate and manage the  irrigation systems better.2 The project will contribute to \nachieving targets defined in the government\u2019s strategy.3 The strategy aims to develop and \nexpand  the  country\u2019s  irrigated  land  and  manage  its  water  resources  more  effectively  by \nimproving  existing  irrigation  systems,  making  water  user  communities  more  efficient,  and \nreducing the vulnerability of the Cambodia\u2019s people to disasters caused by natural hazards.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Improved  macroeconomic  stability  and  public  financial  management  reforms  have \nhelped Cambodia\u2019s economy grow during 2004\u20132014. Gross domestic product grew by 7.0% in \n2014 and is expected to expand by 7.4% during 2015\u20132016.5 Agriculture accounts for 29% of \ngross domestic product and employs 72.3% of the country\u2019s work force, or about 5 million \npeople. The livelihoods of 80.0% of Cambodians depend on the sector.6 Farming in Cambodia \nis  mostly  subsistence-level,  rain-fed,  and  devoted  to  paddy  rice  production.  Even  though \nCambodia  has  become  self-sufficient  in  rice  and  a  rice  exporter,  its  rice-based  farming \ngenerates low incomes for its people. Nearly one-quarter of its provinces have food deficits due \nto low agricultural productivity, and 16.1% of the population is undernourished, even though the \nannual paddy surplus now stands at 3.3 million tons.7 \n \n4.  Rainfall distribution and river discharges vary significantly from season to season in \nCambodia, which makes sustained year-round agricultural production difficult and increases \nvulnerability of the farmers\u2019 livelihood and rural economy. The timely availability and efficient \nmanagement of water is of prime importance to enhancing agriculture productivity and achieving \ndiversification in agriculture production and the rural economy. The deterioration of existing \nirrigation infrastructure is seriously compromising the government\u2019s plans to achieve these goals. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Uplands  Irrigation  and  Water  Resources \nManagement Sector Project (TA 8702-CAM). \n3  Government of Cambodia. 2013. Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency, Phase III. \nPhnom Penh. The document presents the 5-year policy agenda of the government and forms the basis of the \nNational Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018. \n4  This loan meets all three ADB eligibility requirements for approval as a sector loan. The borrowing developing \nmember country has a sector development plan to meet the priority development needs of the sector. The \nborrowing developing member country has the institutional capacity to implement the sector development plan. The \npolicies applicable to the sector are appropriate and will be improved, if warranted. ADB. 2003. Sector Lending. \nOperations Manual. OM D3/BP. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2015.

For  this  reason, \nirrigation scheduling, water gauging, and the designing of joint reservoir operations have been \nincluded in the project scope.  \n \n5.  The government\u2019s national strategy prioritizes the development of irrigated agriculture to \nensure food security and to build up the rural economy. Of the 3.98 million hectares (ha) of \nagricultural land in Cambodia, about 1.3 million ha are within the command area of 2,730 \nirrigation systems.8 Most of these systems are either dysfunctional or underperforming due to \nthe deterioration and aging of infrastructure, a lack of resources to rehabilitate them,  and \ninadequate operation and maintenance (O&M). The two core irrigation systems selected for \nimprovement by the project have a total command area of 20,301 ha,  but only 11,935 ha of this \nland is currently being cultivated\u20141,015 ha in the dry season and 10,920 ha in the wet season.  \nThis is due to water not reaching the farms because design life of main and distribution canals is \nalready exhausted and they need rehabilitation. By ensuring that this land is better irrigated, the \nproject will increase the cultivated area of these two subprojects to 28,083 ha\u201410,912 ha in the \ndry season and 17,171 ha in the wet season. \n \n6.  Irrigation consumes about 70% of Cambodia\u2019s water. Water availability in the future is \nexpected to have significant seasonal variability with few months of floods and long spells of \ndrought. Efficient, effective, and sustainable management of the country\u2019s water resources \nlargely depends upon how smartly irrigation systems are managed to match the use of water \nwith the seasonal crop requirements and minimize the losses in conveying this water to and \napplying it in the fields. Increasing public investments in irrigation infrastructure and introducing \nmodernized operational management will make the country\u2019s irrigation systems more efficient \nand  productive.  The  proposed  project\u2019s  interventions  will  enhance  agricultural  and  rural \neconomic  productivity  through  increased  efficiency  of  irrigation  systems  and  improved \nmanagement  of  water  resources  in  upland  areas  of  Kampong  Thom  and  Battambang \nprovinces.9 The project will complement existing ADB and the government\u2019s investments on \ndeveloping agriculture value chains in these provinces to maximize the returns from agricultural \nproduce to the farmers and rural economy.     \n \n 7.  The project will capitalize on policy and legal reforms and institutional strengthening \ncarried  out  under  the  ADB-financed  Water  Resources  Management  Sector  Development \nProgram.10 A government order issued in March 2015 on farmers\u2019 participation in the O&M of \nirrigation systems  will provide the basis for forming FWUCs in the project areas and involving \nthem in the design, implementation, and subsequent O&M of the subprojects.11 This will ensure \nthe sustainability of the project investments. The subprojects will be selected on the basis of \ncriteria outlined in the project administration manual (PAM) that aim to ensure their economic, \nfinancial, social, technical, and environmental viability.12  \n \n8.  The  project  will  also  develop  synergies  with  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  Climate-Resilient  Rice \nCommercialization  Sector  Development  Program  (CRRCSDP)  and  its  Greater  Mekong \n                                                \n8  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology.

The project will collaborate with the \nCRRCSDP  by  giving  farmers  access  to  the  improved  seed  supplies,  land  levelling,  and \nagriculture  value  chain  facilities  that  this  project  is  establishing  in  the  project  area.  The \ninstallation  of  hydrometeorological  stations  in  the  project  area  to  improve  water  resource \nmanagement will be done in collaboration with the GMSFDRMMP. The Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry,  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  is  the  implementing  agency  for  the  CRRCSDP,  and  the \nDepartment  of  Hydrology  and  River  Work  (DHRW)  is  the  implementing  agency  for  the \nGMSFDRMMP. The staff from both agencies are included in the project management unit \n(PMU) of the project for coordinating their respective activities. The project will also explore \nlinkages with the work being done under the additional financing of the ADB-financed Flood \nDamage Emergency Reconstruction Project, which includes irrigation rehabilitation and flood \nmanagement  and  pilot  development  of  a  hydrometeorological  system  in  three  river \ncatchments.14 \n \n9.  ADB has provided extensive support for irrigation rehabilitation in Cambodia through \nindividual and sector projects, including some that incorporated policy development. It has also \nemphasized flood and drought management and mitigation in recognition of the potential threat \nfrom  climate  change.  ADB  provided  emergency  loans  to  rehabilitate  rural  infrastructure \ndamaged by extreme flooding in 2000, 2001, 2010, 2011, and 2013. Agriculture and natural \nresources, particularly agriculture commercialization and irrigation support, has been one of \nADB\u2019s priority sectors. ADB has joined in the cofinancing of many projects in the sector with \nseveral  of  Cambodia\u2019s  other  development  partners,  including  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the  Australian  Department  of \nForeign Affairs and Trade, the Nordic Development Fund, and the Global Agriculture and Food \nSecurity Program.15 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be inclusive economic growth through agriculture and irrigation, in line \nwith phase 3 of the government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy on Growth, Employment, Equity, and \nEfficiency for 2014\u20132018 (footnote 3). The outcome will be water and agriculture productivity \nenhanced in the project areas. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The project will deliver two outputs. \n \n12.  Output 1: Enhanced efficiency and climate resilience of irrigation systems in the \nproject areas. The project will support rehabilitation, modernization, and climate proofing of at \nleast three irrigation systems to increase the cultivated area in the project areas in Kampong \nThom and Battambang provinces to 29,500 ha.16 It will also reduce seepage losses by lining \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2013.

Output 2: Improved water resource management. The project will organize FWUCs \nand  provide  gender-inclusive  training  to  FWUC  members  on  (i)  O&M  of  canals,                        \n(ii) management of FWUCs, (iii) issues related to climate variability and change, and (iv) water \nmanagement. It will also involve them in the design and implementation of subprojects. It will \ninstall hydrometeorological stations in the watersheds and establish canal flow measurement \nsystems.  The  project  will  train  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology \n(MOWRAM), MOWRAM\u2019s Department of Farmer Water User Communities (DFWUC), provincial \ndepartments of water resources and meteorology (PDWRAMs), the FWUCs, and the MAFF on \n(i) modern canal operation techniques, (ii) irrigation scheduling, (iii) watershed management, \nand (iv) water management. It will also strengthen their awareness of climate resilience in water \nresource management by introducing measures to mainstream climate change adaptation in the \nplanning  and  design  process,  water  management  in  changing  climate  scenarios,  reservoir \noperations to cope with competing water demands particularly during droughts. The project will \nmodernize canal operations, undertake irrigation scheduling, and integrate the scheduling with \nthe canal flow gauging system to manage supplies, particularly during droughts. It will also \ndesign joint reservoir operations for (i) Stung Chinit and Taing Krasaing reservoirs in Kampong \nThom, and (ii) Bassac and Dauntri reservoirs in Battambang. This will improve water-sharing \narrangements between linked systems and ensure equitable distribution, particularly during \ndroughts. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $66.12 million, of which ADB will finance the equivalent \nof  $60.00  million  and  the  government  will  provide  $6.12  million.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MOWRAM will be the executing agency. MOWRAM\u2019s DFWUC will be the implementing \nagency.  A  PMU  was  established  in  the  DFWUC  before  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance began. The PMU is headed by a project director, who is the deputy director-general \nfor technical affairs of the DFWUC. A project manager, who is the director of DFWUC, will assist \nthe project director. The PMU was fully involved in the preparation of the project. During project \nimplementation, the PMU will have 24 designated staff members from MOWRAM, the DFWUC, \nthe MAFF, the DHRW, and the PDWRAMs of Kampong Thom and Battambang provinces. \nMAFF staff will coordinate the land levelling and other activities to be provided in support of the \nproject by the CRRCSDP. The CRRCSDP will give the project access to quality seed and \nagriculture  value  chain  facilities  and  services.  The  PDWRAMs  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating all field activities with the FWUCs and the DFWUC. The DHRW will coordinate \ninstallation, operation, and data collection of the hydrometeorological stations. It will also be \nresponsible for providing guidance to the PMU on operational challenges during implementation. \n \n17.  A steering committee will oversee the project\u2019s implementation and management and \nprovide policy guidance. It will be chaired by the minister of the MOWRAM and comprise senior \nofficials from MOWRAM, the MAFF, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the offices of the \ngovernors  of  the  two  project  provinces.  Any  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  will  be \nimplemented by and under the management of an interministerial resettlement committee of \nrepresentatives  from  the  relevant  line  ministries,  which  will  be  chaired  by  the  Ministry  of \n ", "6 \n \nEconomy and Finance. The committee will cooperate closely with the Kampong Thom and \nBattambang provincial resettlement subcommittees. The PMU will be responsible for project \nimplementation, planning, organization, monitoring, and reporting and will be supported by the \nproject management and implementation consultants. The project will require 58 person-months \nof international consultant services and 610 person-months of national consultant services. The \nconsultant  firms  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Procurement is expected to involve small \nand large works contracts and goods and will be done using ADB\u2019s national and international \ncompetitive bidding and shopping methods.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  Technical due diligence included comprehensive review of hydrological and hydraulic \nconditions, water requirements and the availability of water, the irrigation engineering aspects of \nthe project, the agronomic issues, and soil analysis. Topographic and geotechnical surveys \nwere  conducted  to  complete  the  feasibility  study  of  the  two  core  subprojects\u2014the  Taing \nKrasaing irrigation system with a command area of about 9,869 ha in Kampong Thom Province \nand the Prek Chik irrigation system with a command area of about 10,432 ha in Battambang \nProvince.  Project  preparation  considered  (i)  various  technical  options  and  their  economic \nviability;  (ii)  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  design,  outcome,  and  outputs;  (iii)  options  to \nmaximize the irrigated area and the benefits to farmers; (iv) measures to minimize adverse \nenvironmental and social impacts; and (v) past experience of ADB projects to make the project \nimplementation arrangements robust. The project will use a participatory development approach \nunder which the beneficiary farmers will be organized into the FWUCs and take part in the \ndesign and implementation of the subprojects. The FWUCs will also take full responsibility for \nO&M of the secondary and tertiary canals. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  Economic and financial analysis  was carried out for the two core subprojects. The \nresulting estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were 22.7% for the Taing Krasaing \nirrigation system and 24% for the Prek Chik irrigation system, both higher than the assumed \n12%  cut-off  rate  for  economic  viability.18 Sensitivity  analyses  indicated  that  the  economic \nviability of both subprojects is highly robust and would  withstand adverse changes in key \nvariables, such as (i) an increase in the project\u2019s projected capital cost by 10%, (ii) an increase \nin the O&M cost of 10%, (iii) a decrease in overall benefits by 10%, (iv) a decrease in cropping \nintensity by 10%, (v) a 10% drop in the price of rice, and (vi) a decrease in yield increment by \n10%. Since O&M or the lack of it has been a crucial factor in determining the sustainability of \nirrigation investments, the EIRR was stress-tested further by assuming potential results of poor \nO&M: (i) a decline in the cultivated area by 10%, and (ii) a reduction in the life of the subprojects \nby 5 years. The EIRR dropped below 12% when these two negative factors were combined in \nsensitivity  testing.  Although  this  scenario  is  highly  unlikely,  the  project  will  place  special \nemphasis on ensuring that the FWUCs and MOWRAM provide the appropriate O&M for the \nsubprojects.  In  addition  to  the  loan  covenants  for  having  O&M  plans  prepared  for  the \nsubprojects, the required funds allocated, and a mechanism put into place for collecting the \nirrigation service fees,  the project will conduct a study to determine the gap between O&M \nbudget allocations and requirements for irrigation systems in the country. The study will also \nconsider such other aspects of O&M as staff capacity, contractor capacity, and O&M planning. \nThe study will form the basis for policy dialogue with the government. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n20.  All procurement to be financed by ADB loan funds will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Project implementation, \nprocurement,  and  financial  management  will  be  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  standard \noperating procedures for externally financed projects. The overall procurement classification for \nthe  project  is  assessed  as  medium  risk  (category  medium).  A  financial  management \nassessment concluded that the pre-mitigation financial management risk level for the project \nwas moderate. This was mainly due to the limited capacity of the PMU to deal with financial \n                                                \n18 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nmanagement issues, including delays in preparation of financial management reports, a lack of \nan accounting software, weak internal audit unit, internal control issues, and quality of external \naudit. ADB has provided support to strengthen internal and external audit capacity of the PMU \nthrough a TA financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The existing organizational \nstructures of the executing and implementing agencies are generally suitable for implementing \nthe  project.  The  fund  flow  arrangements  are  clear.  The  executing  agency  is  currently \nimplementing four ADB projects.19 It has also implemented ADB-financed projects in the past. \nThe experience gained from  the ongoing and completed  projects will help in the financial \nmanagement of the project. In addition, ADB will provide specific support under the project by \nengaging consultants to build capacity in project financial management. The project design \nincludes mitigating measures especially related to internal controls and internal auditing that are \nsufficient to address the risks and are measurable. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MOWRAM.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n22.  By improving irrigation systems and providing a reliable supply of irrigation water to the \nfarms, the project will substantially increase farm productivity and enhance the incomes and \nlivelihoods of beneficiaries. Only one rice crop is currently grown in the project areas each year, \nduring the wet season. This is because irrigation canal water does not reach the farms in the dry \nmonths. The project will ensure water supplies for cultivating a second crop in the dry season of \nrice,  vegetables,  and  fruits.  That  will  increase  agricultural  production  and  household  farm \nincomes almost twofold. \n \n23.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. Total number of beneficiary \nfarming families is 18,349 comprising 88,075 persons, of which 51% are women. About 2,569 \n(14%)  farming  families  are  headed  by  women.  The  project  will  enhance  women\u2019s  role  in \ndecision-making  for  water  and  agriculture  management  at  the  community  level  through  a \nminimum  representation  of  30%  women  in  the  FWUC  membership  and  in  the  FWUC \nmanagement committees, and developing women\u2019s leadership skills. Their capacity will also be \nbuilt in improving on-farm water management, agriculture practices and coping with climate \nchange. At least 25% of unskilled laborers employed in project civil works construction will be \nwomen who will be paid the same wages as men for similar work. The project will also provide \ntraining for women in administering FWUC affairs, carrying out O&M, and managing water.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n24.  Environment. The project is classified as category B for environment. The details of \nprocedures to ensure that potential environmental impacts are mitigated are provided in the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF). 20  The  EARF  and  the  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) for the two core subprojects have been disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite.21 An environmental management plan has been prepared for the core subprojects to \nmitigate the impacts during construction and will be made part of any civil works contracts. The \nEARF will be followed for an environmental assessment of any additional subprojects prepared \n                                                \n19 (i) Water Resources Management Sector Development Program; (ii) Climate-Resilient Rice Commercialization \nSector Development Program; (iii) Greater Mekong Subregion Flood and Drought Risk Management and Mitigation \nProject; and (iv) Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project-Additional Financing.  \n20 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nduring implementation, and an IEE will be carried out for each. This will ensure that these \nsubprojects are consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). In the event of \nadditional subprojects, environmental management plans will be included in the IEEs and civil \nworks  contracts.  Adequate  resources  have  been  allocated  for  environmental  safeguards \npreparation, implementation, monitoring, and reporting. \n \n25.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement. Because screening of the Taing Krasaing and Prek Chik irrigation systems\u2019 main \ncanals revealed no land acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts, no resettlement plans \nwere drawn up during project preparation. However, distribution canals for the two systems are \nto be identified during project implementation and may require the acquisition of small strips of \nland.  To  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  government \nregulations, a resettlement framework has been prepared in close consultation with the national \nand local governments to guide screening and preparation of resettlement plans for these \ndistribution canals and for other subprojects that may be added to the project. If subprojects are \nidentified but assessed as category A for involuntary resettlement, they will not be financed by \nthe  project.  Adequate  resources  have  been  allocated  for  preparation,  implementation, \nmonitoring, and the reporting of any necessary resettlement plans.  \n \n26.  Indigenous peoples. The project is category C for indigenous people.  No indigenous \npeople live in the project area, and none are expected to be impacted by the project.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.22 The overall benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures  \nEffects of climate  The project design includes improvement of drainage facilities to protect \nchange may damage  agricultural land and canals from flooding that may be caused by high-\nproject outputs and  intensity long-duration rain events in the future related to climate change. \nassets in the future.  Irrigation scheduling will be done to reduce impacts of future droughts on \nwater availability, and water flow measurement instruments will be installed \nin the canals to control supply and meet crop water requirements during dry \nspells. Farmers will be trained to grow low-delta, high-value crops and in \nclimate change adaptation. Joint reservoir operations will be designed and \nadopted. \nThe planning and  MOWRAM has established a sustainable funding mechanism for O&M.

Development Program.a The plan was approved by the MEF, and the MEF \nsubsequently allocated the equivalent of $8.0 million for O&M of irrigation \nschemes in 2015. Training to build the capacity of the staff of MOWRAM and \nthe PDWRAMs to plan budgets and O&M was also provided under the \nprogram in 2014 and 2015. O&M budgeting has been mainstreamed into the \nannual budget planning of MOWRAM. \nO&M cost of the subprojects will be estimated, and maintenance plans will \nbe prepared by the implementing agency with support of the PMIC and \ninvolvement of FWUCs at the time of the design and cost estimates of the \n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures  \nsubprojects. Based on that, an average annual irrigation service fee per \nhectare will be determined. FWUCs will take responsibility for collecting \nthese fees and will use this revenue for the O&M of distribution canals. The \ngovernment will allocate funds in the annual budget for the O&M of the main \ncanals, and the PDWRAM will carry out the O&M. FWUCs will oversee the \nO&M of the main canals.
