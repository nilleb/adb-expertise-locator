The project will support wastewater management, lake rehabilitation, \nsludge treatment, solid waste management, and related urban environmental services.2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nThe  project  is  located  in  Huangshi,  southeastern  Hubei  Province,  80  kilometers  (km) \nsoutheast of Wuhan, the provincial capital.3 The city is spread over floodplain on the south bank \nof the Yangtze River, having developed around three lakes: Cihu, Qingshan, and Qinggang. In \n2010, the population of the municipality was 2.43 million, with 765,000 living in the urban area.4 \nHuangshi\u2019s  initial  development  was  based  on  mining,  and  its  associated  secondary  industries \nhave  driven  the  city\u2019s  economic  development.  Resource  depletion  and  the  need  for  more \nbalanced and sustainable development prompted the Huangshi municipal government (HMG) to \nrenew  the  city  by  upgrading  its  industry,  relocating  polluting  industries  outside  of  the  central \nurban area, and developing tertiary industries and an enabling investment environment. This will \nhelp Huangshi strengthen its development potential as a core secondary city in Hubei Province, \nsupporting balanced regional development in the province. Huangshi is a part of the \u2015Wuhan+8 \nmegacity cluster,\u2016 which the government promotes as a pilot administrative zone for balanced, \nenvironment-friendly economic development within the cluster. \n \n4. \nfaces  environmental  and  urban  development  challenges \nreflecting  its  historical  reliance  on  heavy  industry  and  inadequate  investment  in  urban \ninfrastructure.  General  neglect  of  urban  pollution  allowed  untreated  industrial  and  domestic \nwastewater to flow into urban lakes. The city\u2019s solid waste management is inadequate and the \nsludge from wastewater treatment plants is untreated. Urban channels and lakes are blocked by \npolluted  sediments  and  accumulated  solid  waste.  The  three  lakes  in  the  city  became  polluted \nand degraded, endangering public health and safety, particularly for the poor who often live near \npolluted  inland  waterways  and  in  areas  with  deficient  urban  services.  Inadequate  urban \ninfrastructure constrains sustainable urban development and limits Huangshi\u2019s ability to promote \ninvestment and support balanced regional development in Hubei.  \n\nChallenges.  Huangshi \n\n \nWastewater. An estimated 131,000 cubic meters (m3) of untreated urban wastewater is \n5. \ndischarged daily into the city\u2019s three lakes and the Yangtze River.5 The project will support the \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2010.  Technical \nAssistance  to  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Hubei  Huangshi  Urban  Pollution  Control  and \nEnvironmental Management Project. Manila (TA 7607-PRC). \n\n3   Huangshi is the 11th largest municipality in Hubei Province by population and 9th by gross domestic product. \n4   Huangshi municipality has five urban districts (Huangshigang, Tieshan, Xialu, Xisaishan, and a development zone), \n\none county-level city (Daye), and one county (Yangxin). \n\n5   The  reported  coverage  rate  of  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  differs  depending  on  the  data  source  and \ncalculation  method.  It  is 71% based  on  the  ratio  of  wastewater  flowing  into  existing  wastewater  treatment  plants \n(167,000 m3 per day) to total wastewater generation in the catchment (234,000 m3 per day). However,  this does \n\n\fthe  existing  wastewater  network  system \n\nto  remove \nrehabilitation  and  extension  of \nmisconnections  and  intercept  urban  wastewater  more  effectively,  thereby  improving  collection \nefficiency  and  mitigating  pollution  loads  into  water  bodies  downstream.  The  project  will  also \nsupport  the  construction  of  a  new  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  system  to  serve  the \nnewly developed urban area of Hexi.  \n \nLake. Water quality in Huangshi\u2019s three lakes is severely polluted, to class V or worse.6 \n6. \nThe lakes are affected by organic pollution, nutrients, and heavy metals. Sediments are highly \ncontaminated  with  heavy  metals,  particularly  near  discharge  points  into  lakes.  The  project  will \nsupport an integrated multifunctional approach to lake improvement that removes contaminated \nsediments,  constructs  engineered  wetlands  and  lake  embankments,  and  interconnects  urban \nwater  bodies.  These  interventions  are  designed  to  (i)  improve  water  quality,  (ii)  restore  lake \necology  and  healthy  hydraulic  circulation,  (iii)  improve  the  lakes\u2019  retention  capacity  and \nresilience under climate change, and (iv) enhance public amenity.  \n\n \n7. \nSludge.  The  project  will  tackle  the  emerging  environmental  challenge  of  handling  the \nsludge  generated  in  greater  quantities  as  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  expands.7 At \npresent,  untreated  sludge  is  dumped  directly  to  the  municipal  landfill.  While  supporting  the \ntreatment  system  for  contaminated  sludge  in  the  short  term,  the  project  will  help  the  HMG \ndevelop  a  mid-  and  long-term  strategic  plan  to  reduce  sludge  production,  stabilize  its  content, \nand find beneficial uses for it.8  \n\n \n8. \nSolid  waste.  Challenges facing solid waste management  in  Huangshi  are (i) inefficient \ncollection and transfer facilities, (ii) excessive waste generated without sorting or recycling, and \n(iii)  inadequate  disposal  capacity  for  the  volume.  While  the  HMG  will  expand  the  capacity  of \ndisposal  facilities  to  meet  future  demand,  the  project  will  upgrade  the  existing  collection  and \ntransfer  system  to  enhance  collection  efficiency  to  comply  with  environmental  standards,  build \nnew  collection and transfer  stations  to serve  an expanded  urban area,  and  pilot  a  sorting  and \nrecycling scheme with community participation to reduce, reuse, and recycle waste.  \n\n \n9. \nStrategic  fit  and  lessons  learned.  The  project  will  help  Huangshi  (i)  promote \nenvironmentally sustainable urban development; (ii) improve living conditions by providing better \nurban  services  and  a  cleaner  environment  to  urban  residents,  including  the  poor;  and  (iii) \nenhance  inclusive  socioeconomic  growth  with  expanded  tertiary  industries,  an  attractive \ninvestment  environment,  and  more  employment.  By  promoting  sustainable  and  environment-\nfriendly  urban  development,  the  project  aligns  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u2013\n2015 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC.9  It promotes economic growth that is \nenvironmentally  sustainable  and  inclusive,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020.10 It  contributes  to \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nnot indicate actual connectivity and collection in Huangshi, where many sewer networks are combined with storm \nwater  and  misconnection  and  infiltration  are  common.  A  more  representative  method  based  on  pollution  loads \nindicates a collection rate of 44%. \n\n6   PRC water quality standards have five classes covering 24 basic quality parameters. Class I is pristine; class II is \nfor high-value fish production areas and spawning habitats; class III is suitable for urban water supply; class IV is \nsuitable  for  irrigation  and  recreation;  and  class  V  is  polluted  and  not  recommended  for  human  consumption  or \nagricultural use. \n\n7   About 250 tons of sewage sludge will be generated daily in 2015, based on the projected increase of wastewater \n\nquantity and its pollution loads.   \n\n8   Two sampling tests during project preparation found sewage sludge to be contaminated with high concentrations of \nheavy metals from industry, which limits options for its disposal and reuse. Sludge quality is expected to improve in \nthe long term as a result of the project, which will enable other solutions for disposal and beneficial reuse.  \n\n9   ADB. 2012.

It  conforms  with  ADB\u2019s  Water \nOperational  Plan, which  encourages  expanded  wastewater  management  and  integrated  water \nresource  management.11 It  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  experience  and  lessons  from  previous  projects  in \nHubei 12  and  other  projects  for  urban  development,  water  resource  management,  and \ndevelopment in small and medium-sized cities, as well as from knowledge generated in policy-\noriented studies on lake rehabilitation13 and sludge treatment.14  \n\n \n10. \nDemonstration  features.  The  project  will  (i)  demonstrate  an  integrated  approach  to \nurban  pollution  control  and  environmental  management  that  combines  reducing  upstream \npollution  loads  by  rehabilitating  and  extending  wastewater  and  solid  waste  systems  with \nimproving  downstream  water  quality  by  rehabilitating  lake  ecology  and  hydraulic  circulation, \nwhich  will  significantly  improve  water  quality  in  the  three  lakes;  (ii)  analyze  the  cumulative \nimpact of pollution loads and modeling of surface water circulation to support the design of the \nproject; and (iii) pilot a scheme for solid waste sorting and recycling with community participation \nthat  will  show,  albeit  on  a  small  scale,  the  reduce\u2013reuse\u2013recycle  approach.  The  pilot  scheme \nwill  be  replicated  in  other  communities  in  Huangshi.  The  project  also  has  great  potential  to \nbecome  a  model  of  integrated  pollution  control  and  ecological  rehabilitation  applicable  to \npolluted and blocked urban lakes in other small and medium-sized cities along the Yangtze and \nelsewhere in the PRC. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  will  be  environmentally  sustainable  and  socioeconomically  inclusive  urban \ndevelopment  in  Huangshi.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  urban  environmental  infrastructure \nand management services in Huangshi.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \n\nThe project will have five outputs:  \n(i) \n\nWastewater  collection  and  treatment.

Moderate design for wastewater and sludge treatment and for solid waste \ntransfer  suit  the  natural  environment  and  are  adequate  to  attract  market  competition.  Lake \nrehabilitation  is  well  integrated  and  sequenced  with  other  project  components.  Detailed \nengineering  design  will  comply  with  up-to-date  urban  design  standards  and  specifications  and \nadopt  international  best  practices.  A  capacity-building  program  for  related  urban  services  is \nincluded in the project. A detailed description of components is in the PAM. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n19. \nEconomic.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  technical  options  and  confirmed  that \nproject components use least-cost options to support Huangshi\u2019s long-term urban development \nplans. Cost\u2013benefit analysis reveals the project\u2019s overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nat  12.6%  and  the  overall  economic  net  present  value  at  CNY45.2  million.  The  EIRR  for  each \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fcomponent  is  computed  at  12.5%  for  wastewater,  12.2%  for  lake  rehabilitation  and  hydraulic \ncirculation,  22.1%  for  sludge,  and  15.2%  for  solid  waste,  each  exceeding  the  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12.0%.  The  project  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  either  costs  or \nbenefits, as switching values show the project remaining viable only with a 4.0% cost increase \nor  a  3.9%  benefit  decrease.  However,  all  EIRRs  are  considered  substantially  underestimated, \nas  all  project  components  have  significant  benefits  not  easily  quantified. 18 Economic  costs \ninclude  capital  costs  for  five  components,  physical  contingencies,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance costs. Economic benefits are largely based on estimates of willingness-to-pay as \nderived from the contingent valuation survey conducted during project preparation.19 \n \n20. \nFinancial.  The  analysis  of  the  financial  viability  of  revenue-generating  components\u2014\nwastewater,  sludge,  and  solid  waste\u2014finds  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  the \ncombined  wastewater  and  sludge  components  at  2.9%  and  for  the  solid  waste  component  at \n3.2%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the  1.9%  weighted  average  costs  of  capital.  A  tariff \nincrease is proposed for both wastewater and solid waste to recover operation and maintenance \ncosts  and  debt  servicing  by  2020.  The  analysis  of  existing  tariffs  and  cost-recovery \narrangements  shows  full  cost  recovery  to  be  unrealistic  in  the  short  term  without  government \nsubsidy.  However,  the  project  will  facilitate  progressive  tariff  increases  through  the  capacity-\ndevelopment  component,  following  the  PRC  process  for  public  participation  in  water  tariff \nreform.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRR  for  wastewater  and  sludge  is  generally \nrobust  but  sensitive  to  revenue  decrease,  and  the  FIRR  for  solid  waste  robust  to  adverse \nchanges. The wastewater tariff will equal 0.5% of an average household\u2019s income, and the solid \nwaste tariff 0.2%, or 1.5% and 0.5% of a poor household\u2019s income\u2014far below the benchmark of \n4.0%.  The  proposed  tariff  increase  is  within  the  amount  beneficiaries  are  willing  to  pay. \nFinancial sustainability analysis indicates that the HMG presents acceptable fiscal risk regarding \nits ability to provide counterpart funds and service project debts. Its contributions to the project \nwill be less than 0.5% of its fiscal revenue over the project construction period, and debt service \nwill not exceed 1.1% of fiscal revenue during the operation period. The nonrevenue-generating \ncomponent\u2014river  rehabilitation\u2014is  therefore  considered  both  financially  sustainable  and \naffordable.  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Hubei provincial government, the HMG, and Huangshi Urban Construction Investment \nand  Development  Company  (HUCIDC).  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  PAM,  including  providing  support  and  training  on  ADB  policies \nand  procedures,  engaging  a  tendering  agent  and  project  implementation  consultant  to \nstrengthen  procurement,  and  involving  the  Huangshi  Discipline  Investigation  Bureau  in \nprocurement.  The  financial  management  assessment  concludes  that,  although  the  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  and  HUCIDC  have  sufficient  financial  management  capacity  and \nproject management experience, they lack sufficient experience in managing ADB projects and \nrequire  a  component  to  build  their  capacity  to  implement  the  project  in  line  with  ADB  policies \nand procedures. \n\n                                                \n18 The use of dredged materials and increased economic activity and employment from the project are not counted in \neconomic  analysis.  Improved  water  quality  and  urban  environment  are  probably  not  fully  reflected  in  the \nwillingness-to-pay survey because of their intangibility.  \n\n19  Additional benefits from the tertiary treatment of wastewater and primary treatment of storm water by engineered \n\nwetlands were quantified and added into the lake rehabilitation and hydraulic circulation component.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n22. \nPoverty and social assessment during project preparation included a household survey, \ncommunity and focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The project will directly \nbenefit  over  765,000  urban  residents,  of  whom  4.7%  are  poor,  by  improving  living  conditions, \nurban services, public health, and the urban environment. The poor in particular will benefit from \nthe improved wastewater and solid waste services and lake environment as they tend to live in \nareas  with  deficient  urban  services.  The  project  will  create  1,823  jobs  during  construction  and \n593 jobs during operation. Employment targets for vulnerable groups and women are included \nin the design and monitoring framework and loan covenants. A social development action plan \nhas been prepared and will be implemented by the HMG and HUCIDC. A labor reemployment \nplan  for  sanitation  workers  affected  by  the  mechanization  of  solid  waste  management  and  its \ntransfer from the HMG to local companies has been prepared with extensive consultation.20 It is \nsupported by a loan covenant and will be implemented by the HMG. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  and  a  gender  action  plan \n23. \nhas been prepared with agreed activities and indicators. The analysis of the social survey and \nfocus group discussions reveals that women are primarily responsible for disposing of domestic \nwastewater  and  solid  waste,  paying  utility  bills,  and  caring  for  the  sick  and  elderly.  Improving \nsanitary  conditions  through  more  effective  wastewater,  sludge,  and  solid  waste  management \nwill  benefit  women  through  improved  productivity  and  reduced  illness,  with  its  associated  time \nand  cost  burdens.  The  improved  lake  environment  and  green  space  will  provide  recreational \nareas  for  women  and  children.  Women\u2019s  participation  in  (i)  public  consultations  for  strategic \nplanning  and  facility  design,  (ii)  public  awareness  activities  for  environmental  protection  and \npublic  health,  (iii)  public hearings  on  wastewater and solid waste  tariff  increases,  and  (iv)  pilot \nsolid waste sorting and recycling will strengthen the activities and enhance project sustainability, \nas women are  directly  affected. The gender  action  plan  has  targets for women\u2019s  employment, \nparticipation,  and  capacity  building  supported  by  loan  covenants  and  consulting  support  for \nimplementation and monitoring. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n24. \nEnvironment. The project is environment category A, the classification mainly triggered \nby  the  lake  rehabilitation  and  hydraulic  circulation  component.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment\u2014prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), circulated \nto ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, and posted on the ADB website\u2014concluded that the project would \nhave  substantial  environmental  benefits  and  that  its  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts \ncould  be  mitigated  through  the  environmental  management  plan.  Significant  environmental \nbenefits  are  (i)  improved  water  quality  in  the  three  lakes  in  terms  of  organic  pollutants  and \nnutrient levels, (ii) restored lake ecology, and (iii) improved sanitation and public health through \nthe improved and expanded management of urban wastewater, sludge, and solid waste.  \n \n25.  Major  potential  environment  issues  relate  to  (i)  lake  sediment  dredging,  noise  and  air \npollution,  surface  water  pollution,  and  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety  during \nconstruction; (ii) noise and air quality impacts from solid waste transfer stations, wastewater and \nsludge treatment facilities, and pumping stations at some sensitive areas during operation; (iii) \npossible  impacts  on  the  Yangtze  River  from  the  discharge  of  effluent  from  the  wastewater \ntreatment  plant;  and  (iv)  health  and  safety  concerns  during  the  operation  of  wastewater  and \n\n                                                \n20  The resettlement plan includes the labor reemployment plan and will be monitored by an external monitor. \n\n \n\n\fsludge  treatment  plants  and  solid  waste  transfer  stations.  Mitigation  to  reduce  these  impacts \nwill,  as  spelled  out  in  the  environmental  management  plan,  reduce  and  control  the \ncontamination  of  the  aquatic  ecosystem  with  sediments,  adopt  performance  standards  for \ndredging,  and  regularly  monitor  the  project\u2019s  environmental  performance  during  construction \nand operation. The Huangshi Environmental Protection Bureau will guide and monitor the PMO, \nHUCIDC,  and  contractors  in  implementing  the  plan.  Environmental  management  is  supported \nby  loan  covenants  and  capacity  development  under  the  project.  The  HMG  disclosed  relevant \nenvironmental  information  to  affected  people,  and  the  results  and  findings  of  the  consultation \nwere used to modify the environmental impact assessment and project design. Consultation and \npublic  participation  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation,  and  any  environmental \ncomplaints  or  disputes  will  be  handled  in  accordance  with  the  grievance  redress  mechanism \nestablished for the project. \n \n26. \nResettlement. The project is resettlement category A. It will affect 5 districts, 11 towns, \nand 26 villages and communities of Huangshi city. A total of 898 mu of land will be permanently \nacquired, including 309 mu of collective land and 589 mu of state-owned land. A further 1,450 \nmu will be temporarily occupied during project implementation. 21 Land acquisition will affect 193 \nhouseholds with 766 persons. A total of 44,050 square meters (m2) of residences and 8,208 m2 \nof nonresidential structures will be demolished, affecting 228 households with 853 persons and \nthree enterprises with 26 employees. A resettlement plan prepared in line with ADB's Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)22 and  endorsed  by  the  HMG,  was  disclosed  to  affected  people  in  the \nlocal  language.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  finalized  in  line  with  the  detailed  engineering \ndesign  and  detailed  measurement  survey,  disclosed  to  affected  people  in  the  local  language, \nand submitted to ADB for approval prior to the awarding of civil works contracts. Compensation \nfor  lost  assets  and  resettlement  allowances  will  be  paid  to  affected  people,  and  livelihood \nrehabilitation  will  be  arranged  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  plan  prior  to  the \ncommencement of the related civil works. The PMO and HUCIDC will assume responsibility for \nplanning,  implementing,  financing,  and  reporting  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  A \ngrievance redress mechanism was established.  \n \n27. \nIndigenous peoples. The project is indigenous peoples category C. In Huangshi, ethnic \nminorities represent about 0.1% of the total population. They are socially and economically well \nintegrated  and  do  not  congregate  in  any  particular  residential  area.  No  ethnic  minorities  are \naffected by land acquisition and resettlement.  \n\nF. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 The project has no unusual technical risks. \nThe project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs and risks.  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nImplementation delays due to the \nlimited experience of the project \nmanagement office and HUCIDC in \nprojects financed by multilateral \n\nMitigating Measures \nEarly mobilization of a tendering agent and implementation \nconsultants to provide technical support in procurement, contract \nmanagement, disbursement, and financial management \n\n                                                \n21  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2).  \n22  In  addition,  a  resettlement  due  diligence  report  was  prepared  for  five  existing  wastewater  treatment  plants \n\nassociated with the project. \n\n23  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nagencies \n\nMitigating Measures \nTraining on ADB guidelines and procedures \n\nUnderachievement of wastewater \ncollection efficiency due to delay in \nother government projects \n\nImplementation of works after the comprehensive network survey \nAssurances on synchronized implementation under the project and \nother government projects, and regular reporting on progress \n\nWeak coordination and \nsynchronization between agencies \n\nDelay in land acquisition approvals \nand implementation \n\nUnsustainable operation and \nmaintenance of infrastructure \ncomponents for lack of capacity or \nbudget, and delay in tariff increase \n\nCoordination mechanism between agencies \nClose project monitoring, frequent site inspections, and regular \ncoordination meetings \nCoordination support from implementation consultants \n\nExpeditious implementation of detailed design and detailed \nmeasurement surveys, and finalization of the resettlement plan \nEarly availability of compensation funding for affected people  \nStrict operational compliance with the resettlement plan \n\nSupport for management improvement such as wastewater asset \nmanagement and online monitoring system \nCapacity building and institutional strengthening support \nAssurances on operation and maintenance budget provisions and \ntariff increase for cost recovery \nSupport for annual tariff reviews and public awareness program \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, HUCIDC = Huangshi Urban Construction and Investment Development Company.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n29. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the  PAM \nand  loan  documents.
