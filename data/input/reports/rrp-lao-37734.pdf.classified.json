The  water  discharged \n\nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \n \nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \nSector: Energy \nSubsector: Hydropower Generation  \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, private sector   \ndevelopment \nSubtheme: Public-private partnership \n \nCategory A  \nAn  environmental  impact  assessment  was  undertaken  and  the \nsummary  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  was \ncirculated to the Board on 29 November 2004. \n \nThe Project includes the development, construction, and operation \nof  a  1,070-megawatt  (MW)  trans-basin  diversion  power  plant  on \nthe  Nam  Theun  River,  a  tributary  of  the  Mekong,  in  the  central \nregion of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). A 450 \nsquare kilometer reservoir will be formed on the Nakai Plateau by \nconstructing  a  dam  39  meters  (m)  high northwest of the plateau. \nWater from the reservoir will drop about 350 m to a powerhouse. \nThe Project will divert about 260 cubic meters of water per second \nthrough  a  power  station  to  the  Xe  Bang  Fai  River  Basin,  also  a \ntributary  of \nthe \npowerhouse  will  be  released  to  the  Xe  Bang  Fai  through  a  27 \nkilometer (km) channel and a regulating pond. \n \nThe Project will export 5,354 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity to \nThailand and will provide revenue to the Lao PDR through taxes, \nroyalties,  and  dividend.  About  200\u2013300  GWh  will  be  supplied  to \nelectricity  consumers  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  Project  will  be \ndeveloped  by  a  private  company,  the  Nam  Theun  2  Power \nCompany  Limited  (NTPC).  NTPC  is  owned  by  a  consortium \ncomprising  Electricit\u00e9  de  France  International  (EdFI)  of  France \n(35%),  the  Electricity  Generating  Public  Company  (EGCO)  of \nThailand  (25%),  the  Italian  Thai  Development  Public  Company \nLimited  (ITD)  of  Thailand  (15%),  and  the  Government  of the Lao \nPDR  (25%).  The  Project  is  structured  as  a  build-own-operate-\ntransfer,  with  a  concession  period  of  31  years,  of  which  the \noperating period is 25 years. At the end of the concession period, \nthe  project  facilities  will  be  transferred to the Government free of \ncharge. \n \nThe  major  project  impact  areas  include  the  Nam  Theun  River \nupstream  and  downstream  of  the  dam,  the  Nakai  Plateau,  a \nsection of the Nam Phit River downstream of the regulating pond, \nand  the  lower  Xe  Bang  Fai.  A  comprehensive  assessment  and \nevaluation  of  potential  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the \nProject  have  been  undertaken  by  NTPC  and  the  Government. \n\nfrom \n\nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjectives \n\nfor  negative \n\nThrough  extensive  consultation  with  the  project-affected  people \nand  international  stakeholders,  the  project  formulation  has  been \ngeared  to  avoid  or  minimize  negative  impacts  and  focused  on \nproviding  mitigation  measures \nimpacts  and \ncompensatory  provisions  where  impacts  cannot  be  mitigated. \nPublic  health  issues  have  been  addressed  and  are  incorporated \ninto  the  social  development  plan.  The  international  financial \ninstitutions  (IFIs)  led  by  the  World  Bank  and  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) have undertaken an extensive due-diligence process \nto  ensure  that  the  Project  meets  the  institutions\u2019  requirements. \nThe  involvement  of  IFIs  brought  standards  of  transparency, \naccountability,  and  predictability  to  project  preparation  in  the \nframework of the broader reform agenda in the Lao PDR. \n \nThree  independent  panels  comprising  internationally  recognized \nexperts scrutinized the Project during the preparatory and design \nwork  and  will  continue  to  be  involved  during  construction  and \nimplementation.  The  panels  comprise  the  World  Bank\u2019s  three-\nmember  International  Advisory  Group,  the  Government\u2019s  five-\nmember  environmental  and  social  panel  of  experts,  and  a  three-\nmember dam safety review panel of experts for design and safety \naspects.  \n \nThe  Lao  PDR  is  entering  a  period  of  economic  growth  that  will \ndepend  on  effective  management  of  one  of  its  main  natural \nresources\u2014river  water.  To  ensure \nlong-term  sustainable \ndevelopment, the Lao PDR needs to harness its vast hydroelectric \npower potential in a socially and environmentally sustainable way. \nThe  Lao  PDR  is  well  positioned  in  terms  of  the  natural  resource \nand  physical  location  to  develop  hydroelectric  energy  as  a  major \nsource  of  growth  and  to  generate  revenues  to  implement  the \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  environment  conservation \ninitiatives.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  support  two  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  key  national \ndevelopment  objectives  through  the  power  sector:  (i)  promote \neconomic  and  social  advancement  by  providing  reliable  and \naffordable  electricity  supply,  and  (ii)  earn  foreign  exchange  from \nelectricity  exports.  The  Project \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s development framework, which aims to achieve the \ncountry\u2019s  medium-  and  long-term  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction  objectives.  The  Government  anticipates  successful \nproject implementation to serve as the catalyst for the Lao PDR to \nreduce its dependence on official development assistance and to \ngraduate from the group of least developed countries. \n \nThe  Project  will  promote  economic  growth  in  the  region  by \ndeveloping  hydroelectric  power  resources.  Project  revenues  will \nreduction  and \nsupport \nenvironmental  conservation  programs  as  outlined  in  the  National \nGrowth and Poverty Eradication Strategy.  \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  priority  poverty \n\nintegral  part  of \n\nis  an \n\n\f \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\niii \n\n \nThe  base  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $1,250.0  million,  including \n$795.7  million  in  foreign  currency  cost  and  $454.3  million \nequivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  Contingent  financing  of  $200.0 \nmillion of debt and equity has been committed to cover any delay \nthat may occur.  \n \nThe  Project  is  proposed  to  be  financed  using  a  combination  of \nloan facilities amounting to about $900 million, and shareholders\u2019 \nequity  of  about  $350  million\u2014a  debt\u2013equity  ratio  of  72:28.  ADB \nfinancing is expected to include a $20 million public sector loan to \nthe  Government,  a  direct  loan  to  NTPC  without  Government \nguarantee of up to $50 million, and a political risk guarantee for up \nto $50 million to mobilize commercial debt. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  public  sector  loan  of  $20  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  (OCR)  is  proposed  to  be  provided  to  the  Government \nunder  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility  to  help  the  Government  pay  for  a  portion  of  its \nequity shares in NTPC. This is the first time ADB is lending to the \nLao PDR from OCR. Although the Lao PDR is a group-A country, \nthe  OCR  resources  are  proposed  because  the  Project  is  a \ncommercial  one  and  will  yield  high  returns  for  the  country.  The \nloan will have a 30-year term, including a grace period of 6 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement.  \n \nThe Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the \nLao  Holding  State  Enterprise,  which \nthe  Government \nshareholder of NTPC, on the same terms and conditions as ADB\u2019s \nloan to the Government. \n \nUntil May 2010 \n \nNovember 2009 \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nis \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nThe  Government  and  NTPC  will  implement  the  Project  and  take \non  the  responsibilities  outlined  in  the  concession  agreement. \nNTPC  will  implement  the  Project  through  a  construction  contract \nentered into between NTPC and the head contractor. The contract \ncovers \nthe  engineering,  procurement,  construction,  and \nmanagement of the Project, and most of the contractual risk of the \nsubcontracts.  The  head  contractor  will  subcontract  the  physical \nworks,  goods,  and  services  to  five  principal  subcontractors  to \nundertake  the  civil  works  and  to  provide  the  electromechanical \ngoods  and  services.  The  technical  services  and  personnel \nmanagement  contracts  will  provide \nthe  operation  and \nmaintenance services to NTPC. \n\n \n\n\f \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement  \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\niv \n\n \n\nto \n\nthis \n\nloan \n\n \nWatershed management will be undertaken by the Government\u2019s \nWatershed  Management  and  Protection  Authority  (WMPA),  with \ntechnical advice from NTPC. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Handicrafts  (MIH)  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  on  behalf  of  the  Government.  The  Secretariat \nof the Lao National Committee on Energy under MIH, and WMPA \nwill be the implementing agencies on behalf of the Government.. \n \nThe Project is being carried out by a private sector company, with \nthe  Government  participating  as  a  25%  shareholder.  Therefore, \nprovisions  for  procurement  under  private  sector  loans  in  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines for procurement will be followed. As the Project will be \nimplemented  by  NTPC,  disbursement  of \nthe \nGovernment  for  its  equity  contribution  will  be  made  to  NTPC \nthrough the direct payment method. \n \nThe  Project  will  generate  about  $1.9  billion  of  revenue  for  the \nGovernment  over  the  25-year  operating  period.  The  Government \nrevenue from the Project will help implement measures for poverty \nreduction  and  programs  to  uplift  the  quality  of  life.  About  70%  of \nthe people in the Lao PDR live on less than $2 per day, and about \n80%  live  in  rural  areas  with  little  access  to  basic  social  services. \nThe  Government aims to improve their livelihoods, transportation \ninfrastructure, \nirrigation,  electricity  supply,  water  supply, \neducation, and health facilities. The Project will help preserve one \nof the region\u2019s few remaining intact tropical rainforests and wildlife \nhabitats.  The  Project  will  also  benefit  electricity  consumers  by \nproviding 200\u2013300 GWh to the domestic market. \n \nThe  Project  will  promote  public-private  partnerships  to  meet  the \nLao PDR\u2019s economic growth objectives. The Project will also help \nThailand meet its power demand and diversify its power supply to \nlessen  its  heavy  dependence  on  natural  gas  and  thus  stabilize \nfluctuations in the cost of supply to consumers. \n \nThe  Project  will  generate  about  4,000  unskilled  jobs  in  the  Lao \nPDR during construction.  \n \n\n\fv \n\nA Project of this magnitude and complexity will have risks. A major \none  is  that  the  social  and  environmental  mitigation  measures \nmight  not  be  implemented  effectively  by  the  project  proponents. \nTo  ensure  compliance  with  the  project  commitments,  NTPC  has \nentered  into  a  legal  contract  with  the  Government  through  the \nconcession  agreement  for  the  mitigation,  compensation,  and \nrehabilitation  of  project-affected  people.  In  the  event  of  breaches \nof  environmental  and  social  obligations,  or  of  unanticipated  or \nunintended  project  impacts,  the  concession  agreement  obligates \nNTPC to provide financial and technical support to take mitigation \nmeasures.  The  panel  of  experts  will  assess  the  breach(es)  and \nrecommend that NTPC and the Government undertake mitigation \nmeasures  within  a  specified  time.  The  panel\u2019s  recommendations \nwill be final and binding on the Government and NTPC. \n \nIneffective use of the Government\u2019s revenues from the Project for \npriority  poverty  reduction  projects  and  programs  is  another  risk. \nThe  Government  has,  however,  agreed  to  implement  a  public \nexpenditure  management  strengthening  program.  It  will  ensure \nthat  all capacity-building and reform initiatives such as the World \nBank\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Credit  and  ADB\u2019s  technical \nassistance support to strengthen the State Audit Organization and \npublic  accounting  system  are  integrated  into  a  comprehensive \nreform  strategy.  The  Government  has  also  agreed  to  implement \nto  enhance \nspecific \ntransparency  and  accountability  in  the  use  of  revenue  generated \nfrom the Project. \n   \nThe supply of electricity from the Project to Thailand is small in the \ncontext of the large Thai electricity market. The risk that projected \npower  demand  forecasts  in  Thailand  may  not  materialize  will  not \naffect the least-cost viability of the Project in the Thai power sector \nexpansion  plan.  The  power  purchase  agreement  takes  into \naccount the power demand based on projected economic growth \nand the gap in supply and demand in Thailand. \n \nThe  risk  of  inadequate  water  flows  and/or  flooding  from  the  Xe \nBang Fai may result in the loss of electricity output and revenues. \nThe extensive hydrological studies and investigations covering the \nlast  50  years,  and  the  hydrological  modeling  of  the  Project, \nincluding future hydroelectric power projects in the region, indicate \nthat  this  risk  is  minimal.  However,  revenues  from  the  Electricity \nGenerating  Authority  of  Thailand  power  purchase  agreement \ninclude provision for the intertemporal adjustments of the possible \neffects of the dry years and the flooding in the Xe Bang Fai. \n \n\nrevenue  management  arrangements \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS): \nNam Theun 2 (NT2) Hydroelectric Project (the Project).1 The project proposal2 is included in the \ncountry  strategy  and  program  update  (2004\u20132006)  and  regional  cooperation  strategy  and \nprogram (2004-2008). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nOver  the  last  decade,  the  Lao  PDR  has  achieved  stable  economic  growth  and \nsignificantly  reduced  poverty.  The  share  of  the  poor  is  decreasing  rapidly,  from  about  45%  in \n1992  to  around  32%  in  2003.  The  rapid  decline  occurred  mainly  as  a  result  of  high  economic \ngrowth  of  about  6.5%  per  annum  during  the  same  period.  The  Government  has  thus  set  the \nambitious target of having the Lao PDR graduate from being a least developed country by 2020 \nand  aims  to  rapidly  reduce  the  incidence,  depth,  and  severity  of  poverty.  To  do  so,  the \nGovernment  needs  to  accelerate  sustainable  economic  growth  by  broadening  development \nopportunities.  \n\n3. \nElectricity  exports  began  in  1971  and  have  provided  an  important  source  of  foreign \nexchange  earnings.  In  2003,  electricity  exports  accounted  for  about  30%  of  total  export \nearnings.  While  domestic  consumption  has  been  small  in  relation  to  total  production  and \nexports, the situation has changed over the past decade. Imports have increased as a share of \ntotal domestic production, and the share of exports has declined. Closer regional cooperation is \nopening  up  opportunities  to  promote  electricity  exports  and  satisfy  increasing  domestic \nconsumption. The abundance of hydroelectric power resources and the location of the Lao PDR \nbetween rapidly developing neighboring countries give it a comparative advantage in developing \nhydroelectric power potential. \n\n4. \nThe  Project  intends  to  deliver  5,354  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  per  year  of  electricity  to \nThailand,  where  demand  has  historically  exceeded  economic  growth.  During  1993-2002, \nThailand\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 2.8% annually while electricity demand grew \nby  6.4%.  During  2000-2002,  GDP  grew  by  11.7%,  while  electricity  demand  grew  by  20.0%. \nGrowth  in  electricity  demand  is  expected  to  rapidly  absorb  the  excess  capacity  that  resulted \nfrom the economic downturn in 1997. During 2005\u20132010, capacity should be increased by about \n1,500 megawatts (MW) and 9,500 GWh per year. Electricity capacity consists of combined cycle \ngas  turbine  (71%);  thermal  (lignite  and  oil,  19%);  hydroelectric  power  (9%);  and  other  smaller \nsources  (1%).  While  Thailand  will  likely  continue  to  rely  mainly  on  natural  gas,  fuel  sources \nshould be diversified as heavy reliance on just one may result in undesirable price fluctuations \n\n                                                 \n1   As  part  of  the  same  Project,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  through  its  Private  Sector  Operations  Department \n(PSOD),  is  also  processing  (i)  a  loan,  without  Government  guarantee,  to  Nam  Theun  2  Power  Company  Limited \n(NTPC);  and  (ii)  a  political  risk  guarantee,  with  Government  counter-guarantee,  in  favor  of  commercial  lenders \nlending to NTPC. NTPC\u2019s commercial lenders, as part of their security package, are requiring NTPC\u2019s shareholders \nto pledge their shares, and NTPC itself to mortgage its assets. Such security requirements are normal for a project \nfinancing of this type. To accommodate these requirements, the Government has requested a partial waiver of the \ntraditional negative pledge clause incorporated into ADB public sector loan agreements by way of section 7.07 of \nthe Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations. \n\n2   ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nPolitical Risk Guarantee to Nam Theun 2 Power Company Limited for the Greater Mekong Subregion: Nam Theun \n2  Hydroelectric  Project  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic.  Manila  (RRP  37910,  March  2005).  The  MKRD \nproject team worked closely with the PSOD project team, led by C. Locsin, principal structured finance specialist. \nThis report and recommendation to the President (RRP) will be circulated back-to-back with the above-referenced \nRRP. To avoid repetition, the documents are cross-referenced to each other as appropriate. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nin the power sector. Continued reliance on natural gas will require further investment in the gas \npipeline network and imports.  \n \n5. \nIn  the  Lao  PDR,  the  power  sector  (i)  promotes  economic  and  social  development  by \nproviding  reliable  and  affordable  domestic  power  supply,  and  (ii)  earns foreign exchange from \nelectricity exports by developing its hydroelectric power potential. The domestic power system is \nin  its  early  stages  of  development.  Per  capita  consumption  is  among  the  lowest  in  Asia.  The \nsystem consists of four national transmission grids, none of which are interconnected. Electricit\u00e9 \ndu Laos (EdL) has made a prudent commitment to purchase at least 200 GWh from the Project \nbut can purchase up to 300 GWh to meet domestic demand. This commitment is consistent with \nthe  country\u2019s  absorptive  capacity,  given  constraints \nin  system  expansion  and  grid \ninterconnection, and with the least-cost strategy to add capacity only when it can be absorbed \nby the system. The domestic off-take from the Project would increase domestic supply by about \n7%.  \n\n6. \nThe  Government  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  assistance  in \npreparing  the  Project3  as  a  public-private  partnership.  The  Nam  Theun  2  Power  Company \nLimited (NTPC), a private sector consortium led by Electricit\u00e9 de France International (EdFI) as \nthe  lead  sponsor,  will  develop  and  operate  the  Project.  The  advantages  of  the  private  sector \nundertaking the Project include (i)  efficient, effective, and on-target implementation; (ii) access \nto global capital; and (iii) access to state-of-the-art technology. Recognizing that most large dam \nprojects,  including  the  proposed  Project,  are  controversial  because  of  their  environmental  and \nsocial risks, the Government considered involvement of the World Bank and ADB important to \nthe Project\u2019s success.  \n \n7. \nThe rationale of the Project is to help the Government develop hydroelectric power as a \nforeign exchange earner and provide least-cost electricity supply to consumers in the Lao PDR. \nThe  Project  will  support  medium-  and  long-term  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  and \nenvironmental conservation as outlined in the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy \n(NGPES).  The  strategy  articulates  a  medium-term  program  of  reforms  and  public  spending \nprograms  to  sustain  high  growth  and  rapidly  reduce  poverty.  Developed  through  an \nunprecedented participatory process and endorsed by the National Assembly in October 2003, \nit describes the country\u2019s overall development framework. The strategy has strong support from \nthe  donor  community,  including  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  the  World  Bank,  and \nADB.  It  identifies  the  power  sector,  specifically  hydroelectric  power  resources,  as  strategically \nimportant  for  earning  revenue  to  finance  poverty  reduction  and  environmental  and  social \nprograms. The Project is expected to generate about $1.9 billion in cumulative revenue for the \nGovernment over the 25-year operating period. While the revenue stream from the Project has \nsignificant  potential  to  improve  the  fiscal  revenue  base,  the  impact  on  economic  growth  and \npoverty  reduction  will  depend  on  effective  revenue  and  public  expenditure  management. \nContinued  structural  reforms,  sustained  fiscal  discipline  in  public  expenditure  and  revenue \nmanagement, and an environment of accountability  and transparency at all government levels \nare  key  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  involvement  of  international  financial \ninstitutions (IFIs) in the Project will facilitate improvement in transparency and accountability in \npublic  expenditure  management.  It  will  promote  effective  regional  cooperation,  enable  the \nGovernment to tap significant private capital in a country without a track record of large projects, \nand provide technical expertise in comprehensive due diligence and monitoring supervision.  \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2003.

(TA 4323-LAO, for $1,000,000, approved on 29 March 2004).  \n\n\f3 \n\n \n8. \nThe challenge for the Government and NTPC is to maximize benefits while ensuring that \npotential adverse social and environmental impacts of the Project are fully addressed through a \ndetailed  program  of  mitigation,  compensation,  rehabilitation,  and  offset  measures.  The \nGovernment and NTPC, with the assistance of ADB, the World Bank, and other IFIs agencies, \ncomprehensively  assessed  and  evaluated  these  potential  impacts  in  accordance  with  the \nsafeguard  policies  of  the  Government  and  the  institutions.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \nimplement the Project effectively is articulated in the Government letter of implementation policy \n(Appendix 2). \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n\nBased on technical evaluations, the Lao PDR has hydroelectric power potential of about \n9. \n18,000  MW,  but  only  663  MW  of  generation  capacity  has  been  harnessed  so  far.  Thirty-three \npotential sites have been evaluated for hydroelectric power development, and 11 projects with a \ntotal capacity of 4,000 MW are in various planning stages for implementation during the next 15 \nyears. Despite the country\u2019s advantage in producing power at low cost, low population density \nmakes  initial  capital  investments  in  rural  electrification  expensive.  Only  about  41%  of \nhouseholds  have  electricity.  The  Government\u2019s  target  is  to  raise  the  household  electrification \nratio to 90% by 2020 while striving to implement the hydroelectric power development program \nin a socially and environmentally sustainable manner.  \n \n10. \nThe  power  market  in  the  GMS  is  changing  toward  effective  regional  cooperation. \nBilateral power trade under the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Regional Power Trade is well \nestablished and the Lao PDR has been a key participant. The governments of the Lao PDR and \nThailand  have  a  framework  agreement  for  power  trade  between  them.  First  signed  in  June \n1993,  it  has  been  modified  to  reflect  market  changes.  The  latest  understanding  reached \nbetween the two governments, in 1998, specifies the power sale arrangements of up to about \n3,300  MW  by  2008.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  for  the  sale  of  1,500\u20132,000  MW  of \nelectricity  to  Viet  Nam  by  2010  was  signed  in  1995.  The  Project  is  a  key  element  of  these \ncommitments.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\n \n\n11. \nA  major  challenge  in  realizing  the  country\u2019s  hydroelectric  power  potential  is  domestic \nresource  constraints  on  financing  development  expenditure.  Recognizing  that  it  will  need  to \nattract  financing,  the  Government  is  promoting  private  sector  involvement.  The  new  financing \nmodalities are fundamentally changing the way projects are planned and implemented. Private \nsector  involvement  has  been  limited  to  export  projects,  and  the  preferred  purchaser has been \nthe Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT).  \n \n12. \nThe  trend  toward  closer  regional  cooperation  and  regional  grid  interconnections  opens \nup opportunities for the Lao PDR to develop hydroelectric power projects\u2014otherwise not viable \nfor  the  domestic  market\u2014to  serve  the  rapidly  growing  region  and  the  regional  power  market. \nThe Project\u2019s power exports to Thailand will create an opportunity to serve Lao consumers with \nleast-cost electricity.  \n\n \n13. \nSeveral  challenges,  however,  require  serious  attention  in  the  short  to  medium  term. \nAbove  all,  improving  governance  is  essential  for  the  success  of  reforms  and  a  socially  and \nenvironmentally sustainable development program.  \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n1. \n\nGovernance and Effective Public Expenditure and Revenue Management \n\nin \n\nImprovements \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  capacity \n\n \n14. \nGovernance has emerged as a key ingredient in power sector development. Inadequate \ngovernance  has  had  a  major  impact  on  macroeconomic  performance  and  hindered  the \neffectiveness and sustainability of the power sector. Dividends from Government investments in \nthe  power  sector  have  remained  with  EdL  to  subsidize  electricity  tariffs  instead  of  supporting \npoverty  reduction  programs.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  establish  a  company  to  hold  the \nGovernment\u2019s  shares  in  NTPC  and  to  receive  dividends  to  ensure  a  transparent  and  efficient \nflow of Government revenue from the Project to finance poverty reduction initiatives. In current \nterms,  the  Government\u2019s  revenue  from  the  Project  is  expected  to  be  about  5%  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s total revenue. While modest, its impact could be significant if targeted at priority \nsectors.4  \n \n15. \nto  manage  public  expenditures \ntransparently  and  efficiently  are  critical  to  ensure  that  the  Government\u2019s  revenues  from  the \nProject  will  be  used  to  support  priority  poverty  reduction  and  environmental  conservation \nprograms.  The  Government,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  and  ADB,  has  formulated  a  \npublic  expenditure  management  strengthening  program  (PEMSP),  which  will  focus  on \nstrengthening  fiscal  planning  and  budget  preparation  and  improving  budget  execution, \naccounting, and financial reporting. Other multilateral and bilateral donors have shown interest \nin supporting the program and related capacity initiatives.  \n \nAn  ADB  evaluation  study5  determined  that  a  lack  of  comprehensive  and  systematic \n16. \ndiagnostics  has  affected \nimplementation,  and  results  of  ADB\u2019s  capacity \ndevelopment  assistance.  The  absence  of  clearly  stated  capacity  development  goals  and \nobjectives,  including  organizational  performance  criteria,  baseline  information,  and  time-bound \ntargets  has  resulted  in  inefficient  use  of  resources,  unsustainable  results,  and  limitations  on \nefforts to monitor progress and assess outcomes. To strengthen capacity development efforts, a \ncapacity-building  strategy  to  support  the  PEMSP  will  be  designed  and  implemented  through \naction plans to increase national managerial, technical, and administrative skills and capacities \nwithin  the  public  sector,  in  support  of  improved  budget  preparation  and  execution,  and \nmonitoring.  The  strategy  will  incorporate  the  findings  of  the  initial  assessment  of  public \nexpenditure management functions and institutional arrangements, capacity gaps, and possible \nmitigation measures.  \n \n17. \nThe  Government  has  defined  performance  indicators  that  will  allow  the  PEMSP  to \nmonitor  the  progress  in  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  public  expenditure  management \nprogram.  The  monitoring  framework  and  process  will  enable  the  Government  to  verify  proper \nuse  of  funds  and,  if  necessary,  take  actions  to  ensure  that  they  are  used  for  eligible  poverty \nreduction  and  environmental  conservation  programs.  Budget  execution  reports  and  financial \nstatements  will  identify  programs  supported  by  Government  revenues,  and  will  verify \nadditionality6 of expenditures on eligible programs, as measured by comparison with base-year \nbudgets  and  actual  expenditures.  The  financial  statements  of  the  eligible  programs  will  be \nsubject to an annual audit by the State Audit Organization. Regular public expenditure reviews \nand expenditure tracking surveys will be carried out. The revenue management arrangements \n\nthe  design, \n\n                                                 \n4   As  an  illustration,  Government  revenues  from  the  Project  could  be  up  to  about  50%  of  domestically  financed \n\nexpenditure on education and health in FY2004.  \n\n5   ADB. 2004.

The  project  design  considers  the  experiences  of  other  hydroelectric  power \nand  major  infrastructure  projects  in  other  parts  of  the  world,  the  experiences  reflected  in  the \nreport  of  the  World  Commission  on  Dams,  the  report  of  Extractive  Industries  Review.8 \nAppendix 3  describes  how  these  experiences  and  key  lessons  learned  have  been  taken  into \naccount in the project design.  \n \n19. \nBased on these lessons, the project proponents have increasingly focused their efforts \non designing the environmental and social mitigation, offset, and compensation measures. They \nhave  collected  baseline  information  on  all  project-affected  sites  and  people,  which  will  be \nupdated  regularly,  and  continue  to  do  so  during  project  implementation  and  operations.  The \nGovernment  and  NTPC  have  focused  their  efforts  in  recent  years  on  identifying  the  potential \nsocial  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  in  the  downstream  areas,  and  have  provided \nadequate  funds  for  environmental  mitigation  and  social  development  programs.  The  Project \nincludes  performance  guarantees  and  contingency-financing  allocations  for  unanticipated \nimpacts  and  for  modifications,  if  required,  during  project  implementation  and  operations.  To \naugment the large number of studies and analytical work conducted to formulate and design the \nProject, the proponents commissioned a study to assess the Project\u2019s cumulative and regional \nimpacts.  The  Project  includes  mechanisms  for  monitoring  and  evaluation,  using  agreed-on \nindicators, of all aspects of project implementation.  \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Issues and Capacity Building  \n\n \n20. \nThe  power  sector  has been subject to institutional and organizational weaknesses that \nhave  affected  decisions  on  investments,  electricity  tariff  determination,  and  appointment  of \nsenior management and staff. While the technical capacity of EdL is adequate, the scope of its \nactivities has become overextended, covering power generation, transmission and distribution, \nand  planning  and  operating  the  power  system.  Therefore,  ADB  will  provide  assistance  to \nstrengthen  and  streamline  the  independent  power  producer  development  framework  that  will \nfacilitate and promote transparent private participation in the power sector.9 \n \n\n                                                 \n7   Three  evaluation  reports  are  related  to  ADB-financed  hydroelectric  power  projects  in  the  Lao  PDR:  ADB.  2004. \nProject  Performance  Audit  Report  on  the  Nam  Leuk  Hydroelectric  Power  Project  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic.

While the Government is committed to implementing these projects in a \nsocially and environmentally sustainable manner, many measures were less than effective due \nto inadequate capacity, particularly in financing and human resources.  \n \nTo help the country solve these problems, the donor agencies10 have been assisting the \n22. \nGovernment  in  its  longer-term  capacity  building  efforts.  ADB  provided  assistance11  to  the \nfor  environmental \nthe  policy  and  regulatory \nGovernment \nmanagement and social safeguards; (ii) enhance institutional capacity at sectoral and provincial \nlevels to identify, analyze, and address social and environmental issues; (iii) bolster compliance \nwith  and  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations;  (iv)  foster  improved  sector  planning  within  an \nintegrated  natural  resource  management  framework;  and  (v)  promote  sustained  financing  for \npriority  environmental  management  activities.  The  concession  agreement  between  the \nGovernment  and  NTPC  includes  many  capacity-building  activities  for  Government  staff.  The \nagreement  requires  NTPC  to  provide  on-the-job  training  to  Government  officials.  The  main \nfocus of this arrangement is to encourage knowledge transfer from NTPC to the Government as \nthey  work  together  on  the  Project.  The  ADB  capacity-building  program  under  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TAs)12 for the Project carried out the needs assessment and \nthen  designed  a  short-term  capacity-building  program  that would provide technical advisers at \nkey Government agencies involved in implementing social and environmental programs. \n \n23. \nRecognizing institutional capacity constraints, the proponents are developing the Project \nthrough  private-public  partnership.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operational \nstrategy, which aims to promote private sector participation in the infrastructure sector. Together \nwith the closer integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\u2013GMS power system, \nthis  could  open  the  way  to  financing  and  development  options  not  available  to  national \ngovernments or the private sector.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n24. \nThe objective of the Project is to promote economic growth in the region by helping the \nLao  PDR  develop  its  hydroelectric  power  resources  in  an  environmentally  and  socially \nsustainable manner and to promote power trade in the GMS. The Project also targets poverty \nreduction  under  the  aegis  of  the  NGPES  and  conservation  of  the  Nakai  Nam  Theun\u2013National \nProtected Areas (NNT\u2013NPA).  \n \nB. \n \n25. \nThe project site is in the central provinces of Khammuane and Bolikhamxay, about 250 \nkilometers  southeast  of  Vientiane,  and  stretches  from  the  top  of  the  annamite  mountain  chain \n                                                 \n10 The World Bank has included an extensive program of capacity building under its proposed Nam Theun 2 Social \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nand Environmental Project (NTSEP) and proposed Lao Environmental and Social Project (LENS).  \n\n11 ADB. 2001.

The  Project  has  the  following  major \ncomponents. \n \n \n\n1. \n \n26. \nThe Project includes the development, construction, and operation of a 1,070 MW trans-\nbasin diversion power plant on the Nam Theun, a tributary of the Mekong. It will capture the flow \nof  water  from  the  watershed  of  the  Nam  Theun  and  the  Nakai  Plateau  by  building  a  dam  39 \nmeters (m) high at the northwestern end of the plateau.  \n\nConstruction of Hydroelectric Power Plant and Related Infrastructure \n\n  \n\nThe Project will create a reservoir of 450 square kilometers (km2) on the Nakai Plateau. \n27. \nWater from the reservoir will drop about 350 meters to a powerhouse at the base of the Nakai \nescarpment near the town of Gnommalat. The water discharged from the powerhouse will then \nflow through a 27 km channel to the Xe Bang Fai, which drains into the Mekong approximately \n150 km south of the Nam Theun confluence. A regulating pond will be constructed downstream \nof  the  powerhouse  to  ensure  smooth  release  of  water  into  the  downstream  water  courses. \nAbout 260 cubic meters per second of water will be diverted to the Xe Bang Fai.  \n \n28. \nThe Project will construct a 138 km double circuit 500 kV transmission line to the Thai \ngrid, and a 70 km single circuit 115 kV transmission line and 22 kV connections to the regional \nLao  grid.  Approximately  5,354  GWh  of  power  will  be  provided  to  Thailand  annually  and  about \n200\u2013300 GWh of power will be transmitted for domestic consumption. The other infrastructure \ncomponents included are spillways, riparian flow outlets, reservoir and saddle dams, headrace \nchannel  and  intake  structures,  headrace  tunnel,  surge  shaft,  pressure  shaft  and  pressure \ntunnel,  power  station  and  switchyard,  tailrace  channel  and  aeration  weir,  roads,  bridges,  and \nworkers\u2019 camp.

The  key \noutputs  are  (i)  establishment  of  infrastructure  and  provision  of  services  in  the  resettlement \nareas; (ii) improvement in living standards of people resettled on the Nakai Plateau, of people in \nthe watershed, and of the poorest and vulnerable groups affected by acquisition of lands and by \nchanges in river flows of the Xe Bang Fai and downstream Nam Theun; and (iii) maintenance of \nliving standards through compensation and restoration for loss of assets and the livelihoods of \npeople affected by project land acquisition and changes in river flows in the downstream areas. \nIn particular, the Project\u2019s objective for the resettlers affected by reservoir inundation is to meet \nverifiable  impact  targets  by  means  of  livelihood  packages;  improved  land  tenure;  improved \ninstitutional capacity; improved access to health, education, agricultural extension services, and \nmarkets; and exclusive rights to the sustainable use and management of natural resources. The \nsocial  development  plan  (SDP)  recognizes  that  implementation  of  the  livelihood  program  may \nbe delayed during the transition and, therefore, provides for transitional assistance and then its \ngradual phasing out. \n \n\n\f9 \n\nParticular  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  ethnic  minorities.  The  mitigation,  compensation, \n30. \nand  livelihood  restoration  measures  under  the  Project  take  into  account  specific  needs  of  the \nBrou communities along the downstream channel and small Vietic groups along transportation \ncorridors.  During  implementation,  data  collection  and  detailed  planning  specific  to  ethnic \nminorities in the river valleys of the NNT\u2013NPA and in other project areas will take place.  \n \n\n(ii) \n\nEnvironment   \n\n \nThe  environment  management  program  comprises  mitigation  of  impacts  due  to \n31. \n(i) creation of the reservoir, (ii) diversion of large quantities of water into the Xe Bang Fai, and \n(iii)  major  reduction  of  Nam  Theun  River  flow  downstream  of  the  dam.  Environmental  impacts \ninclude (i) loss or modification of natural habitats and associated effects on wildlife modifications \nto water quality and the associated impacts on public health, fisheries, and aquatic habitat; (ii) \nriverbank  erosion  along  the  Xe  Bang  Fai  and  associated  loss  of  household  assets  and \nlivelihoods; (iii) fish reproduction impacts, particularly on migration and loss of breeding habitats \nin the two basins; (iv) construction-related impact of spoil disposal, erosion, and air quality; and \n(v)  increased  pressure  on  resources  due  to  the  increased  population.  The  key  outputs  of  the \nProject are mitigation measures such as the construction of a regulating pond for more constant \nwater release into the Xe Bang Fai, construction of a degasification and aeration weir, lining of \nthe  exposed  section  of  the  channel,  and  soil  protection  measures  to  stabilize  riverbanks.  The \nProject outputs also include construction of retention tanks to confine and store liquid and solid \nfuels and chemicals, repair and improve management of dikes at entrances to tributaries of the \nXe  Bang  Fai  for  flood  control,  and  solid  waste  and  wastewater  management  programs  for \nconstruction camps and resettlement areas. \n \n\n(iii) \n\nBiodiversity Offset and Conservation \n\n \n32. \nConservation of the NNT\u2013NPA, an area of significant bio- and cultural diversity covering \nsome  4,200  km2,  will  serve  as  the  major  offset  for  the  anticipated  habitat  loss  caused  by  the \nProject on the Nakai Plateau and downstream from the project dam. The principal conservation \ntargets are the habitats and cultural heritage of the ethnic minority population of the NNT\u2013NPA. \nThe key project outputs are the protection of flora and fauna in the watershed; preservation of \nculture  and  improvement  in  living  standards  of  the  ethnic  minority  community  consistent  with \nconservation  of  the  NNT\u2013NPA;  and  protection  against  soil  erosion  in  the  reservoir  watershed \ncatchment,  which  is  vital  for  Project  sustainability.  Management  plans  for  mammals  and  bird \nspecies,  including  a  conservation  program  for  the  Asian  elephant  and  the  white-winged  duck, \nare part of such outputs. In addition, 28,700 hectares of forest area will be rehabilitated and/or \nreforested  to  further  enhance  compensation  and  offset  measures  to  the  habitats  lost  due  to \ninundation of the reservoir area.  \n \nThe project proponents have allocated about $90.5 million for environmental and social \n33. \ncosts,  including  $31.5  million  for  the  project  watershed  management  and  $16.0  million  for \ndownstream  mitigation  measures  up  to  the  end  of  the  concession  period.  A  summary  of \nenvironmental and social impacts assessment, resettlement plans, ethnic minority development \nplans,  and  the  framework  for  addressing  resource  access  restrictions  is  in  Appendix  4.

It  also  involves  operational  provisions  in  sector  and \nthematic  policies  such  as  forestry,  water,  energy,  and  gender  and  development.  The  key \nsafeguard  documents  are  (i)  the  environmental  assessment  and  management  plan  (EAMP),13 \nwhich  assesses  project  impacts  and  details  plans  to  minimize,  mitigate,  or  compensate  for \nthese impacts; (ii) the SDP, to manage social impacts, including those related to resettlement, \nhealth,  gender,  and  downstream  impacts  and  to  address  special  issues  related  to  ethnic \nminorities;  and  (iii)  the  social  and  environment  management  framework  and  operational  plan \n(SEMFOP), to manage the NNT\u2013NPA, including its corridors. The Government, NTPC, and IFIs \nalso  prepared  the  summary  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment,  cumulative  impact \nassessment  (CIA),  and  NT2  contributions,  safeguard  due  diligence  on  the  Thai  transmission \nlines,  social  and  environment  cost\u2013benefit  analysis,  and  capacity  assessment.  All  NTPC \nobligations,  including  those  related  to  social  and  environmental  mitigation,  are  detailed  in  the \nsafeguard  documents  and  summarized \nthe  concession  agreement. \nin  schedule  4  of \nSupplementary Appendix B provides the safeguard documents.  \n \n\nSocial Mitigation, Compensation, and Livelihood Restoration \n\n1. \n \n35. \nADB\u2019s social safeguard requirements are addressed under the SDP for the project area, \nand  the  SEMFOP  for  the  NNT\u2013NPA.  The  SDP  addresses  the  social  safeguards  and  other \ncross-cutting  social  issues.  It  includes  (i)  a  public  health  action  plan  (PHAP),  (ii)  the  Nakai \nPlateau  resettlement  plan,  and  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP),  (iii)  downstream \nareas resettlement and livelihood restoration and EMDP, (iv) project land resettlement plan and \nEMDP,  and  (v)  a  construction-phase  social  management  plan  for  managing  and  mitigating \nimpacts  related  to  contractors  and  spontaneous  camp  followers.  The  SEMFOP  includes  a \nresource access restriction process framework for livelihood development through participatory \nplanning and EMDP for inhabitants in the NNT\u2013NPA and the peripheral impact zone.  \n \n36. \nThe Government has established a comprehensive resettlement organizational structure \nfor implementing the SDP together with NTPC, which will provide experts to work side by side, \nand provide on-the-job training to, their Government counterparts. Specialized activities will be \n\n                                                 \n13 The first draft of the environmental assessment and management plan (EAMP) was completed in May 1997, with \n\nrevisions in 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2004. \n\n\f11 \n\noutsourced to nongovernment organizations and other experts. The Government and NTPC are \njointly responsible for the outcomes.  \n \n37. \nThe  PHAP  contains  a  comprehensive  health  impact  assessment  following  a  World \nHealth Organization model. The PHAP, which includes a resettlers\u2019 health plan and a regional \nhealth  plan,  is  designed  not  only  to  mitigate  all  identified  significant  health  risks  to  acceptable \nlevels  but  also  to  improve  local  conditions  during  construction  and  operation.  The  PHAP \nincludes  an  HIV/AIDS14  awareness  program.  The  head  construction  contractor  (HCC),  who  is \nresponsible  for  overall  project  implementation,  has  prepared  a  staff  health  plan  for  all \nconstruction workers. A gender action plan and strategy (Supplementary Appendix C) has been \nprepared  and  mainstreamed  into  the  SDP  and  SEMFOP.  A  social  management  plan  for  the \nconstruction  phase  has  been  prepared  and  includes  a  trafficking  awareness  and  prevention \nprogram. \n\n \n2. \n\nEnvironmental Mitigation \n\n \nThe  environmental  management  plan  includes  (i)  detailed  environmental  management \n38. \nand  monitoring  requirements  for  the  HCC  to  mitigate  construction-related  impacts;  (ii)  specific \nprograms  during  operation  to  reduce  impacts  on  water  quality,  flooding,  and  channel \ndegradation,  and  to  protect  wildlife;  (iii)  specific  activities  designed  primarily  for  controlling \nsynthetic  chemical  use  to  safeguard  water  quality  management  and  monitoring  as  well  as \nriparian  release  to  the  Nam  Theun  river  to  lessen  impacts  on  the  ecosystem  and  livelihoods; \nand (iv) measures for various implementation agencies on public education, plantation forestry, \nand shifting cultivation reduction. The main project-affected areas include (i) the Nakai Plateau, \n(ii) the NNT\u2013NPA, (iii) downstream Xe Bang Fai; (iv) downstream Nam Theun and Nam Kading, \nand (v) the Mekong. (Map 2) \n \n\n3. \n\nCumulative and Regional Impacts \n\nA CIA and NT2 Project contribution15 study was undertaken to gain understanding of the \n39. \ncumulative  impacts  of  various  development  activities  in  the  region  and  the  contribution  of  the \nProject to such impacts. The study analyzed the potential combined induced impacts of a series \nof projects in the region, either implemented together or in sequence, in relation to the Project. \nThe  primary  geographic  areas  covered  are  the  Mekong,  Nam  Theun  and/or  Nam  Kading,  Xe \nBang Fai, and Theun Hinboun basins and the linear development zone of the transmission lines \nand  roads.  Broader  areas  are  covered  in  relation  to  social  development,  transport,  and \nbiodiversity.  Two  development  scenarios  are  presented in the CIA based on a 5- and 20-year \nplanning  horizon.  These  scenarios  cover  a  number  of  sectors  by  examining  the  present \nsituation,  existing  plans,  and  development  trends.  The  sectors  are  hydroelectric  power, \ntransport,  irrigation,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  urban  development,  fisheries,  forestry, \nindustry, social development, and conservation.  \n\n40. \nThe  study  covered  the  magnitude  of  the  Project\u2019s  induced  impact  in  the  downstream \nMekong  River  Basin,  including  the  Tonle  Sap  Lake  in  Cambodia  and  the  Mekong  Delta.  It \nconcluded  that  the  potential  impact  of  the  Project  alone  on  downstream  Mekong  would  be \nchanges  in  flow  pattern  and  sedimentation  load,  which  could  have  a  positive  impact  on  flood \nmanagement and saltwater intrusion in the Mekong Delta but could have a negative impact on \nthe fisheries in the Tonle Sap. In line with the Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable \n                                                 \n14  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n15  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing the GMS: Nam Theun 2 \n\nHydropower Development Project. Manila. (TA 4213-LAO, for $700,00, approved on 9 November 2003).  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nDevelopment of the Mekong River Basin, the Government issued the riparian notification letter, \nand  exchanged  dialogue  with  the  Cambodian  Government  to  provide  clarifications  in  the \nspecific technical aspects of the Project.  \n\nThe study reported that Mekong fish have adapted to the annual flood pulse. It indicates \n41. \na strong positive correlation between floods and fish production. However, baseline data on fish \ncatch are uncertain and a number of other significant ecological factors in addition to the flood \nlevels  are  in  play.  Given  this,  a  definite  fish  production  figure  for  flooded  areas  cannot  be \ndetermined. The most productive fish-breeding areas on the floodplains and around the Tonle \nSap are reported to be shrub- and forest-covered wetlands. These vegetation types are being \nconverted  into  agricultural  land,  which  is  less  suitable  as  breeding  grounds  and  may  increase \npollution.  The  study  assessed  the  following  factors  that  could  impact  fisheries:  water  level, \nsedimentation and/or nutrient level, and fish migration.  \n\n42.  Water Level. The study shows that the Project will cause water to flow to Cambodia in a \nmore  regulated  way  than  without  the  Project.  There  will  be  slightly  less  water  during  the  wet \nseason and slightly more during the dry season. The project-induced impact on the water level \nin the Tonle Sap is estimated to be about 1% of the normal yearly wet season fluctuations (3-\ncentimeter reduction as opposed to 2.5\u20133.0 m normal fluctuation in the wet season). \n\nSedimentation.  The  sedimentation,  which  is  affected  by  two  parallel  developments \n43. \nworking  in  opposite  directions\u2014intensive  agriculture  and  deforestation\u2014increases  the  erosion \nand  sediment  load  in  the  Mekong,  whereas  the  building  of  reservoirs  might  trap  sediments. \nWithout the Project, the first process seems to be the strongest and the sediment transport in \nMekong  is  increasing.  When  the  Project  comes  on  stream  it  will  result  in  the  dilution  of \nsedimentation  load  in  the  Xe  Bang  Fai  because  of  the  water  with  less  sediment  load  coming \nfrom  the  plateau.  However,  the  study  predicts  that  the  sediment  load  will  be  sufficiently \nincreased  by  the  time  the  Xe Bang Fai reaches the Mekong. Sedimentation and nutrient level \nissues will become negligible by the time the water reaches Cambodia. \n\n44. \nFish Migration. Most of the fish species in the Cambodian and Vietnamese parts of the \ncatchment migrate within the Mekong and its tributaries downstream of the Khone falls. Some \nspecies  are  able  to  climb  the  falls  but  will  not  be  affected  by  the  higher  water  level  in  the  Xe \nBang Fai. Migration of fish to the NNT\u2013NPA through the Nam Theun is not an issue at this stage \nsince  the  Theun  Hinboun  Dam  already  blocks  the  passage.  Changes  in  water  flow  and  water \nquality  in  the  Nam  Kading  and  Xe  Bang  Fai  are  therefore  not  likely  to  have  any  significant \nimpact on fisheries in downstream countries. Supplementary Appendix D provides the CIA and \nNT2 contributions.  \n\n \n\n4. \n\nThai Transmission Lines \n\n45. \nThai Transmission Lines. To supply electricity into the EGAT system, a 166 km double \ncircuit  500kV  transmission  line,  will  be  constructed  from  the  Lao\u2013Thai  border  to  a  new \nsubstation at Roi Et, Thailand. Planning and construction of this additional transmission line is \nthe responsibility of EGAT. Since EGAT is not receiving any financial support from ADB or the \nWorld  Bank  to  construct  this  transmission  line,  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  undertook  due-\ndiligence work rather than the full safeguard compliance review to seek as assurance that the \nsocial and environmental impact assessment and  mitigation work would be undertaken by the \nThai  authorities.  The  work  is  expected  to  be  completed  before  the  transmission  lines  are \ninstalled by 2008.  \n\n\f13 \n\n \n\n5. \n\nIntegrated Water Resources Management  \n\n46. \nIntegrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  is  an  approach  to  improve  planning, \nconservation,  development,  input  of  water,  forest,  land,  and  aquatic  resources  for  maximizing \nsocial and economic welfare. The Government recognizes the benefits of a basin-wide strategic \napproach to IWRM, which would involve the key stakeholders in planning and decision-making \nprocess.  National  agencies  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Handicraft  (MIH),  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Forestry , Science Technology and Environment Agency (STEA), and provincial \nand  district  administrations  pursue  their  respective  programs  independently of the other in the \nNam Theun and Xe Bang Fai basins and in an ad hoc manner. The Government is planning to \nestablish  a  permanent  river  basin  organization  to  coordinate  the  planning,  monitoring,  and \nregulatory  framework  in  the  Nam  Theun  Basin.  It  intends  to  tap  resources  from  existing  and \nfuture hydroelectric power projects in the basin to provide funding for the mitigation measures \nfor the cumulative impact. The mitigation measures will be implemented by national or provincial \nagencies or by hydroelectric power companies. The project design includes various measures, \nwhich  are  in  line  with  IWRM,  including  the  CIA  and  NT2  Project  Contribution  Study,  and  an \nadaptive  management  approach  covering  activities  such  as  riparian  release  from  downstream \nNam Theun, water release to the Nam Kathang, regulation of dam release management into the \nXe Bang Fai, and wildlife programs to respond to the basin-wide changes and potential impacts \nwith flexibility. The extensive consultation on the proposed livelihood restoration program along \nthe affected river basins reflects the good practice to IWRM.  \n \n\nConsultation and Disclosure \n\n6. \n \nADB has promoted the informed participation of the Government, civil society, and other \n47. \nstakeholders in an open and inclusive manner. During the project preparation, stakeholders had \nthe  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  details  of  the  Project,  as  per  ADB\u2019s  guidelines.  The \nGovernment and NTPC initiated consultation with the project-affected people in 1997. However, \nthe  consultations  could  have  been  made  more  effective  had  they  been  undertaken  in  a  more \nbalanced,  transparent,  and  meaningful way. Since early 2004, ADB and the World Bank have \nengaged independent consultation experts to help the Government and NTPC undertake a new \nround  of  local  consultation.  NTPC  and  the  Government  began  posting  the  safeguards \ndocuments  on  the  Internet  for  public  review  and  comment  in  March  2004.  The  risks  and \nmitigation plans outlined in the draft documents have since been discussed with a wide group of \nstakeholders  through  a  series  of  local  consultations  with  project-affected  communities  in  the \nmajor impact zones: Nakai Plateau, project land areas, downstream Xe Bang Fai, downstream \nof the dam, and the NNT\u2013NPA. Information on the compensation and resettlement plans, and \nlivelihood options have been presented to the project-affected people by trained community and \ndistrict  facilitators  through  media  they  can  understand,  including  radio  broadcasts  in  minority \nlanguages,  visual  materials  together  with  verbal  explanations,  site  visits  to  proposed  and  pilot \nresettlement  areas,  and  open  discussions.  The  project  design  was  adjusted  to  accommodate \nconcerns  of  the  project-affected  people,  such  as  location  of  the  plateau  resettlement  area, \nvillage  layout,  housing  design,  and  types  of  crops  under  the  livelihood  program  as  well  as \nlivelihood  options  for  project  lands  and  downstream  areas.  Summaries  of  the  resettlement \naction plans have been distributed to project-affected people and integrated into adult education \nand Lao-language training sessions.  \n \n48. \nDue  to  the  sensitivity  of,  and  the  global  interest  in,  the  Project,  it  was  decided  that  a \nseries  of  national  and  international  workshops  in  Bangkok,  Paris,  Tokyo,  Vientiane  and \nWashington  D.C.  would  provide  a  forum  for  open  and  well-informed  dialogue,  explain  project \ndetails,  clarify  issues  and  debate  stakeholders\u2019  concerns,  inform  the  due-diligence  process  of \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nthe  IFIs,  and  provide  feedback  to  the  Government  and  NTPC  before  finalization  of  project \ndocuments. The international workshops were facilitated by well-known resource persons, and \na  summary  of  the  proceedings  of  the  workshops  have  been  made  public.  Consultation  and \ndisclosure efforts under the Project are in Appendix 5.  \n \nD. \n \n49. \nThe total base cost of the Project is estimated at $1,250.0 million equivalent, comprising \n$795.7  million  (63.6%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $454.3  million  (36.4%)  in  local  currency \ncosts.16  The  cost  estimates  have  been  prepared  using  2005  price  levels  and  a  summary  is  in \nTable 2, with details in Appendix 6. \n \n\nCost Estimates  \n\nTable 2: Summary of Project Base Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n396.2 \n48.8 \n150.6 \n173.0 \n27.1 \n795.7 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n315.3 \n0.0 \n14.0 \n106.3 \n18.7 \n454.3 \n\nA.

An additional $200 million \nof contingent debt and equity financing has been arranged. Debt and equity are denominated in \na mix of dollars and baht to match the composition of the two currencies in project base costs. \nTherefore, project costs in US dollars are funded by dollar equity and debt, while costs incurred \nin  baht  are  funded  by  baht  equity  and  debt.  The  overall  capital  structure  is  59.8%  dollars  and \n40.2% baht, exactly matching the mix of dollar and baht capital expenditures required for project \nconstruction. The 50/50 mix of US dollar and baht debt is designed to match the tariff paid by \nEGAT  and  EdL.  This  will  reduce  the  currency  mismatch  between  the  revenues  received  by \nNTPC  and  the  amounts  paid  to  the  lenders.

As the Government holds 25% equity share of \nNTPC, its base equity injections will amount to $87.5 million (excluding contingent equity). The \nGovernment\u2019s  equity  injection  will  be  financed  by  loans,  credits,  and  grants  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR \n(loan  up  to  $20.0  million  including  interest  during  construction  and  contingent  fees),  the \nInternational  Development  Association  (IDA)  (grant  up  to  $20.0  million),  the  European \nInvestment Bank (loan up to \u20ac40.0 million or equivalent to $52.0 million), the Agence Fran\u00e7aise \nde D\u00e9veloppement (grant funds of \u20ac5.0 million or $6.5 million). NTPC is required to compensate \nthe  Government  $30.0  million  for  its  loss  of  biodiversity  and/or  ecotourism  assets  and  in \npayment  of  its  development  costs,  as  set  out  in  the  concession  agreement  (the  Government \ncontribution). A portion of this amount will be used to fund base equity, and the remainder will \nbe reserved for contingent equity calls on Government.  \n \n52. \nA  public  sector  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR  is  proposed  to  help  Government  to  finance  a \nportion of its equity in the Project. The loan will have a 30-year term, including a grace period of \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n6 years, interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% and such other terms and conditions set \nforth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  Although  the  Lao  PDR  is  a  group-A  country,  the  OCR \nresources  are  proposed  due  to  the  commercial  nature  of  the  Project,  which  will  yield  high \nreturns for the country. The 6-year grace period is proposed to match the construction period of \n4.5 years and first year of commercial operation. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that the choices were the Government\u2019s own \nindependent decision and not based on any advice of ADB.  \n \n \n \nADB  has  been  asked  to  provide  a  direct  loan  and  a  political  risk  guarantee  to  NTPC \n53. \nthrough  its  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD),  while  IDA  and  the  Multilateral \nInvestment  Guarantee  Agency  have  been  requested  to  provide  political  risk  guarantees.  All \npolitical risk guarantees and export credit agency facilities will be funded by commercial banks \nor  export  finance  lenders.  Detailed  description  of  the  loans  and  guarantees  is  included  in  the \nPSOD Report and Recommendation of the President (RRP). \n \n54. \n\nThe proposed participants and possible debt and equity structure are shown in Table 3. \n\nProposed Debt Financing and Political Risk Guarantee Structure \n\n2. \n\n \nTable 3: Proposed Financing Structure \n \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\nSource \nEquity \nGovernment \nEdFI \nEGCO \nITD \n\nTotal Base Equity \n\nDebt \nADB Direct Loan \nUSD Commercial Lenders (ADB-guaranteed loan)  \nUSD Commercial Lenders (IDA-guaranteed loan) \nUSD Commercial Lenders (MIGA-guaranteed loan) \nExport Finance Lenders (Coface-guaranteed loan) \nAFD \nPROPARCO  \nThai Exim Bank \nThai commercial lenders ($ equivalent in baht) \n\nTotal Base Financing  \n\nTotal Base Debt \n\n \nContingent Equity \nContingent Debt, of which: \n ADB Direct Loan \n ADB Guaranteed Loan \n\nTotal Contingent Financing \n\n \n\nTotal Financing \n\n \n\n \n\n 5.0 \n 5.0 \n\n87.5 \n122.5 \n87.5 \n52.5 \n 350.0 \n\n45.0 \n45.0 \n45.0 \n45.0 \n166.5 \n27.0 \n27.0 \n22.5 \n450.0 \n900.0 \n1,250.0 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n\n200.0 \n1,450.0 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AFD  =  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  EdFI  =  Electricit\u00e9  de \nFrance  International,  EGCO  =  Electricity  Generating  Public  Company  Limited,  IDA  =  International \nDevelopment Association, ITD = Italian Thai Development Public Company Limited, MIGA = Multilateral \nInvestment  Guarantee  Agency,  PROPARCO  =  Societ\u00e9  de  Promotion  et  de  Participation  pour  la \nCoop\u00e9ration Economique, USD = US dollar. \nSource: Nam Theun 2 Power Company Limited estimates. \n\n\f17 \n\nF. \n\nInstitutional and Implementation Arrangements \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n \n1. \n  \n55. \nThe Government and NTPC will work in close partnership to implement the Project. The \nconcession  agreement  outlines  the  sharing  of  responsibilities  between  the  Government  and \nNTPC in implementing all activities, including the environmental and social mitigation measures. \nNTPC will assume full responsibility for implementing the infrastructure works and will be jointly \nresponsible with the Government for implementing the environmental and social program. The \nGovernment  will  be  responsible  for  policy  and  regulatory  issues  such  as  land  transfer  and \nissuance  of  titles.  The  organizational  structure  and  the  institutional  responsibilities  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  social  and  environmental  management  plans  is  shown  in  Figure  3.  The \nkey  organizations  responsible  for  implementing  the  environmental  management  plan  are  the \nEnvironmental  Management  Office  (EMO)  of  NTPC,  the  HCC,  and  the  Environmental \nManagement  Unit  (EMU)  of  Government,  which  comprises  officials  from  the  key  central  and \nprovincial  government  agencies  and  is  established  under  the  direction  of  STEA.  EMO  is \nresponsible  for  technical  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  all  environmental \nmitigation  and  compensation  measures.  It  is  also  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  HCC  fully \nmeets  its  contractual  and  environmental  management  obligations.  It  will  report  to  the  EMU \nmonthly  and  work  in  closely  with  the  agencies.  The  HCC  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nmitigation measures for environmental and social impacts during construction, such as making \ndesign changes to avoid or minimize populated or environmentally sensitive sites. This will be \nsubject  to  monitoring  by  the  panel  of  experts,  International  Advisory  Group,  and  lenders\u2019 \nadvisers. \n \n\nFigure 3: Organizational Structure and Institutional Responsibilities \n\nE M P\n\nS D P\n\nE n v i r o n m e n t a l  \nM a n a g e m e n t  \nO f f i c e   ( E M O )\n\nE n v i r o n m e n t a l  \nM a n a g e m e n t  \nU n i t   ( E M U )\n\nF u n d i n g   o n l y\n\nR e s e t t l e m e n t  \nO f f i c e   ( R O )\n\nN T P C\n\nS E M F O P\n\n7   D i s t r i c t  \nR e s e t t l e m e n t   /  \nC o m p e n s a t i o n  \nW o r k i n g   G r o u p s\n\nR e s e t t l e m e n t  \nM a n a g e m e n t  \nU n i t   ( R M U )\n\nS c i e n c e  \nT e c h n o l o g y   &  \nE n v i r o n m e n t  \nA g e n c y   ( S T E A )\n\nW a t e r s h e d  \nM a n a g e m e n t  \nP r o t e c t i o n  \nA u t h o r i t y  \n( W M P A )\n\nR e s e t t l e m e n t  \nC o m m i t t e e   ( R C )\n\nP a n e l   o f   E x p e r t s\n\nP r i m e   M i n i s t e r ' s  \nO f f i c e\n\n \n\nH e a d  \nC o n s t r u c t i o n  \nC o n t r a c t o r  \n( H C C )\n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nTo  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  resettlement  program,  a  comprehensive \n56. \nresettlement  organizational  structure  has  been  established.  The  Resettlement  Committee \ncomprising  the  governor  of  Khammuane  Province  and  officials  of  other  affected  provinces  is \nresponsible for guiding and managing the resettlement process. The resettlement management \nthe  Resettlement  Committee,  is  responsible  for  working  with  the \nunit  (RMU),  under \nResettlement  Office  of  NTPC  in  planning  and  implementing  the  resettlement  process  on  the \nground. The RMU will participate in the grievance procedure. The district resettlement working \ngroups,  established  in  the  seven  districts  to  be  affected  by  the  Project,  are  responsible  for \nrelocation,  technical  restoration,  compensation,  and  development  activities  specific  in  their \ndistricts, together with NTPC.  \n\n57. \nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office has established the Watershed Management and Protection \nAuthority (WMPA) to implement the SEMFOP. The WMPA will be responsible for coordinating \nand managing all activities in the watershed area, including (i) conservation, maintenance, and \npromotion of biological diversity, coupled with the development of a national park for scientific \nresearch  and  tourism;  (ii)  building  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  WMPA;  (iii)  facilitating \nimproved  livelihoods  for  inhabitants  of  the  NNT\u2013NPA;  and  (iv)  protecting  and  rehabilitating \nforest cover in the NNT\u2013NPA. NTPC will be responsible for funding and for providing technical \nadvice in this regard.  \n\n \n2. \n\n \n3. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n58. \nNTPC  is  aiming  for  financial  closure  by  8  May  2005.  Subsequently,  the  construction \nactivities under the HCC are expected to commence in June 2005. The power plant is expected \nto begin commercial operation by November 2009.  \n\nGovernment Special-Purpose Company\u2014Lao Holding State Enterprise  \n\n \nThe  Government  will  receive  three  streams  of  revenue  from  the  Project:  dividends, \n59. \ntaxes,  and  royalties.  To  improve  the  transparency  of  the  Government\u2019s  investments  in  the \nProject and prevent the cross-subsidization of EdL, the Government has decided to establish a \nspecial-purpose  company,  Lao  Holding  State  Enterprise  (LHSE),  to  be  the  nominated \nGovernment  shareholder  in  NTPC.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  own  100%  of  LHSE\u2019s  shares. \nLHSE  will  be  entitled  to  a  25%  share  of  the  total  dividends  declared  by  NTPC.  The  total \ndividends, minus the expenses of the LHSE and debt service payments, will be transferred to a \ndedicated  treasury  account  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  which  is  being  established  under  the \nagreed-on  revenue  management  arrangements.  The  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  loan  to \nthe Government for its equity participation in NTPC will be on-lent to LHSE, on the same terms \nand conditions as those of the ADB\u2019s loan to Government.  \n\n \n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n60. \nNTPC,  a  private  sector  company,  is  implementing  the  Project,  with  the  Government \nparticipating  as  a  shareholder.  Consequently,  the  ADB  loan  to  the  Government,  which  will  be \nused  to  purchase  equity  in  NTPC,  will  finance  goods  and  works  in  accordance  with  relevant \nprovisions for procurement under private sector loans in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The \nGovernment\u2019s participation as an equity shareholder in the project company, using ADB\u2019s public \nsector loan, is desirable because it would strengthen Government commitment to its obligations. \nNTPC  has  entered  into  a  single  contract  with  the  HCC  to  design,  construct,  commission,  and \ntest  all  the  facilities  required  to  implement  the  generating  plant.  The  HCC  has  signed  five \nconstruction  subcontracts  for  the  design and construction of civil works elements, and design, \n\n\f19 \n\nmanufacture, and erection of the electromechanical plant items. The HCC is taking the risk for \nthe subcontracts, and will be responsible for managing construction interface. The HCC contract \nand two subcontracts have been directly negotiated with nominated subcontractors, which are \npartners in the development consortium\u2014the HCC and civil works 1 (Nakai dam, saddle dams, \nand intake canal). These negotiated contracts will not be eligible for ADB financing. The other \ntwo  civil  works  and  two  electromechanical  subcontracts  were  awarded  based  on  competitive \ntenders and will be eligible for ADB financing. ADB is satisfied that the procurement process for \nthe aforementioned four contracts was transparent and arrived at a fair price reflecting economy \nand  efficiency,  and  that  the  contractors  are  qualified,  experienced,  and  from  eligible  ADB \nmember countries. The RRP of the PSOD discusses the procurement arrangements in detail.  \n\n \n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n61. \nAs  the  Project  will  be  implemented  by  NTPC,  with  MIH  as  the  Executing  Agency,  the \ndisbursements  of  this  loan  to  Government  for  its  equity  contribution  will  be  made  to  NTPC  in \naccordance with the guidelines and procedures in ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001). \nDisbursement  of  the  loan  will  be  subject  to  (i)  the  loan  agreement(s)  having  been  declared \neffective  by  ADB;  (ii)  MIH,  MOF,  LHSE,  and  NTPC  having  submitted  sufficient  evidence  of \nauthority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications; (iii) all conditions precedent \nhaving been met, including other financing being made effective; (iv) confirmation that all parties \ninvolved in disbursement are from ADB member countries; and (v) NTPC presenting evidence \nto  ADB  that  goods  and  services  requested  by  NTPC  for  ADB  financing  shall  or  have  been \nproduced in and procured from ADB member countries. \n\n \n\nAccounts, Audit, and Report  \n\n \n6. \n \n62. \nRegular  progress  reports  will  be  prepared  for  the  Project  and  submitted  quarterly  to \nADB, the World Bank, and other IFIs. The reports will include a description of physical progress, \nenvironmental  and  social  mitigation  efforts,  problems  and  difficulties  encountered,  and  a \nsummary of financial accounts for the Project that will consist of project expenditures during the \nperiod,  year  to  date,  and  total  to  date.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  within  3 \nmonths following completion of the Project.  \n \n63.  Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, NTPC will submit its annual financial \nstatements  to  ADB.  These  will  consist  of  an  income  statement,  balance  sheet,  statement  of \ncash flows, and related notes to the financial statement. NTPC will hire independent auditors to \naudit its financial statements in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing and will \ncertify  that  statements  were  prepared  using  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  The \naudit opinion will be submitted along with a memorandum on issues identified during the audit \nprocess. \n \n \n\nProject Performance, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\n7. \n \n\na. \n\nMonitoring Arrangements  \n\n64. \nThe  proposed  monitoring  and  evaluation  arrangements  consist  of  multilayered \ncomplementary  components:  a  dam  safety  review  panel  (DSRP),  a  panel  of  experts,  the \nInternational  Advisory  Group  (IAG),  an  independent  monitoring  agency  for  environment  and \nresettlement, lenders\u2019 advisers, a Government engineer, an owner\u2019s engineer, and supervision \nby staff from the IFIs and commercial lenders. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nDrawing  on  international  experts  and  permanent  local  personnel  in  the  Lao  PDR,  the \n65. \nconsultants  will  provide  regular  and  systematic  monitoring,  including  technical  oversight  by \nsatellite,  of  the key aspects of the Project during the 5-year implementation period and during \ncommercial  operations  for  a  period  sufficient  to  cover  the  legal  obligations  contained  in  the \nconcession  agreement.  To  ensure  the  independence  and  objectivity  of  the  lenders\u2019  technical \nadvisers, they will report directly to the financial institutions, although the contract will be funded \nby NTPC.  \n\nThese monitoring arrangements would form the basis for reports on project progress and \n66. \nproblems  encountered,  as  well  as  on \nthe  much  broader  development  agenda  and \nmacroeconomic  reform  program  in  the  Lao  PDR,  which  the  Project  would  support.  These \nreports  would  be  presented  to  an  annual  meeting  of  project  stakeholders,  including  the \nGovernment, sponsors, financial institutions, and local and international civil society. Principles \nof  multilateral  and  bilateral  partnership  are  being  developed  among  participating  donors  to \nmaintain  the  cohesion  and  shared  vision  of  those  stakeholders  in  the  Project  and  in  its \ncontribution to the broader objectives of the Lao PDR\u2019s development programs.  \n\n \n  \n\nb. \n\nMonitoring Indicators \n\n67.  Monitoring  indicators  will  cover  the  technical,  safeguard,  and  revenue  management \ncomponents of the Project. Completion of the physical works, and goods and services against \ntime  and  budget  targets  will  measure  physical  progress  of  the  Project.  Indicators  to  measure \nsocial  and  environmental  programs  will  measure  the  effectiveness  of  the  conservation, \nresettlement,  and  livelihood  restoration  activities.  Indicators  to  measure  implementation  of  the \npublic  expenditure  management  and  revenue  management  programs  will  evaluate  the \neffectiveness  of  the  use  of  Government  revenue  from  the  Project  for  the  poverty  reduction \nprogram  as  agreed  on  by  the  Government  and  the  donor  partners.  Monitoring  and  evaluation \narrangements are detailed in the Technical Annex 3 of Appendix 2.  \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact Analysis \n\n1. \n\nDirect Impact on the Poor \n\n \n68. \nFood security and nutritional requirements are major concerns for most communities in \nthe  project  watershed.  Since  only  a  few  households  are  self-sufficient  in  rice  production,  they \nrely on the harvesting of natural resources and hunting. Annual household income is estimated \nat  about  $450,  which  is  significantly  lower  than  the  national  household  poverty  line  of  $800. \nMost villagers are illiterate, birth and infant mortality rates are high, and general health is poor. \nAbout 1,150 ethnic minority households in the 31 enclave villages in the NNT\u2013NPA, as well as \npossibly 3,750 households within the peripheral impact zone, who use or extract resources from \nthe project watershed, improve their livelihoods. They will benefit from improved transportation \ninfrastructure, irrigation, micro-hydroelectric power and water supply, and education and health \nfacilities  and  service  delivery.  The  livelihood  development  strategy  under  the  SEMFOP \nembodies  a  number  of  important  attributes.  First,  development  activities  are  linked  to \nconservation  in  a  transparent  manner  to  ensure  that  preferable  development  options  have \npositive  outcomes  for  conservation.  Second,  the  planning,  implementation,  and  evaluation  of \ndevelopment activities is participatory, involving local people in all aspects of decision making. \nThird,  livelihood  development  strategy  follows  an  evolutionary  rather  than  transformational \napproach  by  emphasizing  incremental  improvements  to  livelihood  systems  rather  than \n\n\f21 \n\nintroducing  an  entirely  new  system.  Finally,  the  development  strategy  follows  a  sustainable \nlivelihood  approach  under  which  all  elements  of  the  livelihood  system, not just rice production \nand agriculture, are considered.  \n \nSimilarly, the average household annual income of the plateau resettlers was estimated \n69. \nat about $449 in 1998. Only about 17% of families are able to produce sufficient rice for a year, \nand about half of all families have a rice deficit for more than 6 months. Most adults are illiterate. \nApproximately 6,200 people on the Nakai Plateau will benefit directly from the Project through \nresettlement  to  sites  with  improved  housing,  irrigated  land,  livelihoods,  skills  development, \nhealth and education facilities, and access to markets. Demand for farm produce will rise during \nconstruction.  \n \nThe  economy  in  downstream  Xe  Bang  Fai  is  generally  more  diversified  in  relation  to \n70. \nsources of income. With average annual household income in this area of $664, approximately \ntwo  thirds  of  the  households  in  the  lowland  communities  are  under  the  national  poverty  line. \nThose  households  that  rely  solely  on  agricultural  production  have  the  highest  incidence  of \npoverty in the lowland communities. By increasing the potential for irrigation during commercial \noperations, the Project will improve the ability of lowland farmers to increase their irrigable land \narea  and,  hence,  their  household  incomes.  Communities  along  the  Xe  Bang  Fai  could  benefit \nfrom  reduced  flood  damage,  increased  dry  season  irrigation  and  reduced  pumping  costs,  and \nexpansion of irrigable lands due to increased irrigation potential.  \n \n71.  Women  and  children,  particularly  from  certain  marginalized  ethnic  minority  groups  and \nfrom  disadvantaged  households  on  the  Nakai  Plateau,  are  decidedly  the  most  vulnerable  and \noverburdened  social  group.  Most  of  these  women  and  girls  used  to  have  limited  access  to \neducation,  off-farm  employment,  production  markets,  cash  assets,  and  sociopolitical  power. \nEven  slight  socioeconomic  disturbances  could  easily  overwhelm  their  household  coping \nmechanisms,  deepen  their  already  heavy  family  burdens,  and  overstress  their  psychological \nwelfare. The gender risk is severe and has been recognized in the SDP. A gender action plan \nand  strategy  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  has  been  designed  and  gender-sensitive  actions \nhave been mainstreamed into the Project.  \n\n \n2. \n\nIndirect and Macroeconomic Impacts on the Poor \n\n \n72. \nThe  Project  will  significantly  affect  the  economy,  generating  net  benefits  in  the  form  of \naccelerated economic growth, reduced poverty, and new jobs. Construction will directly employ \nabout 4,000 people, with more than four times this number of jobs expected to be created as a \nresult of support services and other multiplier effects. Poverty in the project site is severe and \nthe  Project  could  open  the  area  to  ecotourism  and  promote  commercial  agriculture  through \naccess  to  markets  via  improved  infrastructure.  Appendix  7  outlines  the  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy, and Appendix 8 provides the poverty impact matrix. Generally, the \nProject could have a positive impact on GDP growth, helping to raise many people nationwide \nabove  the  poverty  line.  Commissioning  of  the  Project  in  2010  will  boost  export  and  foreign \nexchange earnings by generating about $1.9 billion of revenue for the Government over the 25-\nyear  operating period and is expected to significantly improve the country\u2019s debt service ratio, \nallowing it to remain below 10%.  \n \n73. \nThe foreign exchange rate implications of the Project, operating through movements in \nthe price of tradable versus non-tradable goods, are expected to be moderate and manageable. \nIt is unlikely that the Project will adversely affect competitiveness of other export sectors through \nappreciation  of  the  real  exchange  rate,  resulting  in  a  widening  trade  deficit.  Supplementary \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nAppendix  E  provides  an  analysis  of  potential  macroeconomic  impacts.  Revenue  from  the \nProject  will  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  overall  fiscal  position,  enabling  improved  education, \nhealth,  and  other  support  services  critical  to  poverty  reduction,  especially  in  remote  areas. \nRevenue  from  the  Project  will  support  reforestation  and  other  environmental  conservation \nmeasures  throughout  the  country.  While  most  of  the  generated  electricity  will  be  exported  to \nThailand, the Project will add substantially to domestic supply. ADB and World Bank support for \nthe Project includes a comprehensive PEMSP, which will strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity \nto increase its revenues and to use its resources effectively and efficiently in reaching the goals \nand targets outlined in the NGPES. \n \nB. \n\nProject Benefits \n \n1. \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\na. \n\nEconomic Viability \n\n \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n74. \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  The  analysis  covers  the  economic  viability \nfrom the Lao PDR and regional perspectives (Appendix 9 and Supplementary Appendix F). The \ncosts  are  based  on  the  lender\u2019s  financial  model  and  include  development  and  pre-operating \nexpenses,  construction  costs,  operations  expense,  and  social  and  environmental  costs \nassociated with the Project. Economic costs are expressed in constant 2005 prices and exclude \ntaxes and interest during construction. The regional analysis included the Thai cost of dedicated \ntransmission  line  in  Thailand,  which  is  not  funded  by  NTPC.  Costs  were  classified  as  non-\ntradable  and  tradable  goods,  labor,  and  services.  Tradable  costs  were  converted  to  the \ndomestic  price  numeraire  using  derived  shadow  prices.  The  analysis  included  an  annual \nreduction  of  275  GWh  for  the  existing  Theun  Hinboun  hydroelectric  power  project.  In  the \nregional  analysis,  benefits  from  electricity  sales  to  Thailand  were  valued  at  the  average \nwillingness to pay for electricity while sales to the Lao PDR were valued based on the economic \ncost  of  importing  electricity  from  Thailand.  For  the  Lao  PDR  analysis,  benefits  were  valued  in \nterms of the sales to Thailand valued at the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) tariff, adjusted \nby  the  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  The  calculated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs) \nare 15.9% and 15.5% for the Lao PDR and the region, respectively.  \n \n75. \nSensitivity analyses were carried out with respect to key risk factors that could influence \nproject  viability.  The  results  indicated  that  none  of  the  risk  factors  would  independently \nundermine project viability. However, under a worst-case scenario with four combined adverse \nevents,  the  EIRR  fell  below  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital.  The  results  of  the  risk  analyses \nexamining a range of possible EIRR outcomes as a result of variations in the values of uncertain \nfactors  showed  that  the  regional  EIRR  would  range  from  16.9%  to  13.5%,  with  a  mean  of \n15.2%. The Lao PDR EIRR analysis gave similar but slightly lower results. \n \n76. \nThe distribution of net benefits between Thailand and the Lao PDR was analyzed. The \nanalysis shows that the Lao PDR economy is the greatest beneficiary, with net benefits of about \n$171 million, of which taxes and royalties to the Government account for 52%. Project investors, \nincluding the Government, will receive about $18 million. The total gains to Thailand amount to \n$74  million,  of  which  consumers  in  Thailand  receive  $67  million.  Lao  consumers  also  benefit, \nalbeit by a smaller amount. However, the conservative estimate of the annual off-take from the \nProject  to  Lao  consumers  represents  a  substantial  share,  about  7%,  of  total  national  energy \nconsumption in 2010. \n \n\n\f23 \n\nb. \n\nFinancial Viability \n\n \n77. \nFinancial  projections  have  been  prepared  for  LHSE  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the \nADB  to  assess  the  sustainability  of  the  company  from  NTPC  dividend  income  (see  Appendix \n10). Even though the largest sources of Government revenue, the royalty and income tax, are \nexcluded,  the  financial  projections  for  LHSE  indicate  that  its  capacity  to  meet  its  debt  service \nobligations  on  the  ADB  and  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  loans  is  well  within  a  range \nconsidered to be satisfactory. Under the base case scenario, total dividends paid to LHSE over \nthe concession are projected to be almost $640 million, expressed in current prices.  Total debt \nservice, including both principal and interest, on the proposed ADB and EIB loans is estimated \nat $124 million while LHSE operating costs over the entire concession period are projected to \nbe  less  than  $4  million.  Therefore,  with  total  debt  service  and  operating  expense  being \nequivalent to only 20% of net dividend income, LHSE has considerable capacity to service this \ndebt under various scenarios. Consistent with the large differential between the dividend income \nit  receives  and  its  debt  service  and  operating  expenses,  LHSE\u2019s  return  on  equity  (ROE)  is \nprojected to average a very favorable 38% over the 2011\u20132034 period.  \n \n78. \nThe financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2005 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuation.  The  financial  evaluation  was  based  on  the  terms  of  the  concession  agreement \nentered  into  between  the  Government  and  NTPC,  which  provides  for  a  54-month  project \nconstruction period followed by a 25-year operating period. The financial internal rate of return \nafter tax is 12.4%. This compares favorably with the after-tax weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC)  of  10.1%.  A  financial  evaluation,  in  real  terms,  was  also  undertaken  from  the \nperspective  of  Government,  as  25%  shareholder  in  NTPC,  taking  into  consideration  projected \ntax, royalty, and dividend payments. The internal rate of return on the Government's investment \nhas been calculated at 21.1%, which compares favorably to the WACC of 6.9%. Sensitivity and \nrisk analysis indicates that financial evaluation is robust under adverse conditions. Based on the \nfinancial  projections  and  financial  evaluation,  the  Project  is  considered  financially  viable  and \nsustainable.  \n\nC. \n\nProject Risks  \n\n \n\n \n\n79. \nThe Project is by far the largest implemented or even considered for development in the \nLao PDR. As a consequence, it entails project-specific risks covering technical, geological and \nhydrological, environmental and social risks. These technical, geological, and hydrological risks \nare mitigated as the Project will be implemented by NTPC and the HCC, which have extensive \nexperience  in  hydroelectric  power  projects.  To  minimize  and  manage  the  environmental  and \nsocial risks, the Project has undertaken comprehensive safeguard planning in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies,  including  detailed  implementation  and \nmonitoring plans and budgets. The lack of Government experience, capacity to implement such \na complex and sensitive project also carries risks for its successful implementation. To minimize \nthese risks, a multi-donor assistance program and funding arrangement will be in place to help \nthe  Government  improve  its  institutional  and  human  capabilities  for  project-related  activities, \nincluding  the  PEMSP.  The  concession  agreement  provides  legal  commitments  from  NTPC  to \nassume management and financial responsibility for the outcomes of environmental and social \nmitigation,  compensation,  and  restoration  programs.  The  Project  provides  long-term  funding \nfrom  project-related  investment,  as  well  as  capacity  building  program,  for  Government  to \nimplement  conservation  and  watershed  management  programs  for  at  least  30  years.  The \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nmandate  and  accountability,  and  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and  authorities  of  the  central, \nprovincial, and district governments with regard to project-related activities and programs have \nbeen clearly defined to ensure effective implementation. \n \nThe risks such as geology, hydrology, sedimentation, and seismology, which can lead to \n80. \ncost  overruns  and  delays,  have  been  studied  and  evaluated  in  detail  by  international  experts, \nwho  will  continue  to  monitor  these  parameters  during  the  construction.  The  project  design  is \nsound and consistent with prevailing industry best practice, and the technologies employed for \nthe  civil  works  and  electro-mechanical  systems  are  well-known  and  proven.  The  risk  of \ninadequate  water  flows  and/or  flooding  in  the  Xe  Bang  Fai  may  result  in  the  loss  of  electricity \noutput  and  revenues.  The  extensive  hydrological  studies  undertaken  by  NTPC  and  the \nGovernment  using  data  covering  50  years,  and  the  hydrological  modeling  of  the  Project, \nincluding  future  hydroelectric  power  projects  in  the  region,  indicate  this  risk  to  be  minimal. \nHowever, the EGAT PPA include the provision for the intertemporal adjustments of the possible \neffects of the dry years and the flooding in the Xe Bang Fai. \n \nThere is a risk that Government revenues from the Project will not be used appropriately \n81. \nfor  priority  poverty  reduction  and  environmental  conservation  programs.  Specifically,  risks \nassociated  with  implementation  of  Government  revenue  management  arrangements  relate  to \nactions that will have to be implemented post-Project decision, including (i) improvements to the \nchart  of  accounts  and  budget  classifications  to  reflect  priority  programs,  (ii)  development  and \nmonitoring of program performance indicators, and (iii) initiation of program level reporting. Lack \nof  progress  in  these  areas  will  undermine  effective  targeting  and  reporting  once  Government \nrevenues from the Project start flowing. These risks are mitigated by ensuring that these actions \nare prioritized in the PEMSP and included as one of the major commitments of the Government \noutlined in the government letter of implementation policy (GLIP).  \n \n82. \nA  detailed  discussion  on  the  major  risks  and  mitigation  measures  is  presented  in \nAppendix  11.  Risks  associated  with  the  technical  aspects  of  the  Project  are  described  in  the \nPSOD RRP.  \n\n \nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n83. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  NTPC  have  given  certain \nspecific  assurances,  which  are  incorporated  in  the  legal  documents.  Among  these  are  the \nfollowing: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  Government  will  carry  out,  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  all  of  its \nobligations  under  the  concession  agreement,  with  due  regard  to  the  findings, \nreports and recommendations of the EAMP, SDP and SEMFOP, and the GLIP;  \n\nNTPC  will  implement  all  its  obligations  under  the  concession  agreement,  and \nunder  the  common  terms  agreement  it  is  entering  into  with  the  commercial \nlenders,  in  each  case  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  SDP  and  EAMP,  and \nhaving  due  regard  to  the  findings,  reports  and  recommendations  of  the  SDP, \nEAMP and SEMFOP;  \n\n\f25 \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe  Government  through  NTPC  will  have  a  detailed  downstream  mitigation  and \ncompensation plan completed by 30 June 2006;   \n\nfor any additional land required during the construction and operation phases of \nthe  Project,  compensation  agreements  will  be  concluded  prior  to  handover  and \nthe  mitigation  principles  and  objectives  set  forth  in  the  concession  agreement \nand the relevant additional plans will apply;  \n\n(v)  WMPA will be able to operate with sufficient responsibility and authority;  \n\n(vi)  WMPA  will \n\nimplement,  with  specific  plans,  budget  and \n\nthe \ncompensatory forestry program introduced into the SEMFOP in accordance with \nthe requirements of ADB\u2019s forestry policy; \n\ntimetable, \n\nthe  Government  and  NTPC  will  prepare  and  implement  annual  implementation \nplans;   \n\nthe  Government  and  NTPC  will  maintain  the  panel  of  environmental  and  social \nexperts and the DSRP as required under the concession agreement and furnish \ncopies of their reports to ADB; \n\nthe Government will implement all activities required under the PEMSP and the \nNT2 revenue management program; and \n\nthe  Government  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  program  of \npolicies, actions and procedures described in the GLIP.  \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions of Loan Effectiveness \n\nIn addition to the standard conditions, certain further conditions for the effectiveness of \n\n84. \nthe loan have been incorporated in the Loan Agreement, including the following: \n\nLHSE shall have been duly established;  \n\nthe  subsidiary  loan  agreement  and  tri-partite  agreement  shall  have  been \nexecuted; \n\nthe  core  staff  of  each  of  the  EMU,  the  RMU,  and  the  executive  secretariat  of \nWMPA shall have been appointed; \n\nall amendments to the concession agreement shall have become effective; and \n\nall  conditions  precedent  to  the  effectiveness  of  each  of  the  ADB  OCR  facility \nagreement, the ADB political risk guarantee facility agreement, the ADB political \nrisk guarantee, and the ADB government indemnity shall have been met.  \n\n \n\n\f \n85. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nthe loan of $20,000,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Greater \nMekong  Subregion:  Nam  Theun  2  Hydroelectric  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  30  years,  including  a  grace  period  of \n6 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard; and  \n\nthe  request  of  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  a \nlimited  waiver  of  the  negative  pledge  clause  in  existing  and  future  loan  and \nguarantee agreements between ADB and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nThe  waiver  will  be  limited  in  application  to  permit  (a)  the  pledge  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  interest  in  NTPC,  and  (b)  security  over  the  assets  of  NTPC,  and \nonly  for  the  duration  of  the  outstanding  debt  obligations  of  NTPC  in  respect  of \nloans providing funds to NTPC for the Project.

Long-term studies on the impacts of \nfisheries in the Xe Bang Fai and upstream of the Nakai Dam will \ninclude data collected throughout the construction period. \n\n \n\u2022  A proactive mitigation-compensation program is being developed \nwith a dedicated budget and contingencies for the resettled \npopulation on the Nakai Plateau and in the downstream areas. \nMitigation measures are expected to compensate fisheries \nimpacts, loss of riverbank structures and gardens, and other \neffects. The developer is financing all resettlement costs, \nbecause the Government has limited counterpart funds. The \nspecific level of funding is being finalized. \n\n\u2022  Project financing includes contingency funds to cover cost over-\nruns, costs of unanticipated impacts, and failure to achieve \nagreed program targets. The adequacy of funds for these \nactivities is being determined. \n\n6.

Hydrological \n\nuncertainties have \nplagued previous \nhydroelectric power \nprojects in Lao PDR \nand elsewhere. \n\naffected people. Citizens\u2019 concerns led to a change from \nrelocation on the Gnommalat plain to relocation on the Nakai \nPlateau, so that relocated villages are generally within \u201cspirit \nvillage\u201d areas. Village layout design has also been changed \nbased on stated preferences.  \n\n\u2022  The Government of the Lao PDR and NTPC have provided \n\n\u2022 \n\nconsiderable project information on their respective websites with \na view to engaging civil society in dialogue on the Project. \nInformed and meaningful participation of project-affected persons, \nand outreach to local populations, will continue throughout the \nremaining preparation and implementation periods. \n\n\u2022  Project includes establishing and strengthening Government \ninstitutions so they can carry out conservation and social and \nenvironment oversight. The project has been instrumental in \nestablishing the NNT WMPA for watershed management, which \nwill be funded by project revenues over a 30-year period. \n\u2022  Extensive monitoring, by the Government, NTPC, IFIs, IAG, \n\nDSRP and POE, and independent monitors is an integral part of \nthe project design. \n\n\u2022  An independent professional firm will monitor key project issues \nfor the lenders throughout the construction and operational \nperiods, potentially until the commercial debt has been fully \nrepaid\u2014a period of about 17 years from financial close.  \n\n\u2022  Specialist consultants completed a review of the procurement \nprocess and the structure and cost of the head construction \ncontract (HCC) and subcontracts in April 2004. \n\n\u2022  Review concluded that there was adequate competition for two of \nthe three civil works subcontracts and the two electromechanical \nsubcontracts, and that the agreed prices of all six contracts were \ngenerally consistent with, or better than, the prices that might \nhave been expected from greater competition. \n\n\u2022  Thorough staff supervision by IFIs involved. \n\u2022  Qualifications of HCC and subcontractors have been vetted. \n\nFinancial institutions will need to approve qualifications of key \noperational personnel.  \n\n\u2022  Project preparation has included detailed hydrological modeling, \ndam safety planning, and protection of the watershed to prevent \nsedimentation. \n\n\u2022  The PPA includes clauses to shelter NTPC from output losses \n\ndue to Xe Bang Fai flooding and dry years. \n\n\u2022  Active monitoring and timely warning of Xe Bang Fai flooding is \n\nan important feature of the Project operations. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n55\n\nLessons Learned \n\n10. Geological \n\nuncertainties, due \nboth to the paucity of \ninvestigations \nundertaken and the \nrigors of the terrain, \nhave been the single \nlargest cause of cost \nand time overruns in \npast projects. \n\nHow Incorporated into the Project Design \n\n\u2022  Extensive, in-depth geological investigations have been carried \nout; geological risks in the near-vertical water conduits from the \nreservoir to the powerhouse have been well catalogued and \nprovisions made in the contract documents to accommodate \ndesign changes. \n\n\u2022  Powerhouse design has been changed from under- to above-\n\nground at some additional cost. \n\n\u2022  A target price mechanism has been included in the HCC so that \nthe subcontractor absorbs cost overruns up to 125% of the \nparticular milestone, while the owner covers overruns beyond that \namount.   \n\n11.

The  Project  has  undergone \nnumerous environmental and social analyses since the late 1980s. \n\n2. \n\nLegislative, Regulatory and Policy Requirements \n\n2. \nThe process and documentation described below are in response to the regulatory and \npolicy  requirements  of  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR) \n(the Government), ADB, the World Bank, and other partners in the financing consortium, such \nas the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement and the European Investment Bank. Because the \nGovernment requirements for environmental and social analyses are less well articulated than \nthose  of  the  donor  community,  it  has  generally  been  accepted  that  the  policies  of  the \ninternational  financial  institutions  (IFIs)  would  guide  the  overall  evaluation  process.  The \nGovernment  has  expressed  its  environmental  requirements  through  a  number  of  specific \ninstruments,  including  the  National  Environmental  Action  Plan  and  legal  reforms  such  as  the \nEnvironmental  Protection  Law,  Law  on  Water  and  Water  Resources,  Forest  Law,  the  NT2 \nProject Resettlement Policy, and the Land Law.  These laws form the regulatory foundation for \nthe implementation of the Project. \n\nThe Government has established basic institutional responsibilities in key environmental \n3. \nand social areas. It has designated specific agencies to be responsible for the implementation of \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards.  The  Science  Technology  and  Environment  Agency \n(STEA) is the Government\u2019s key oversight agency for the environment. STEA has established \nthe environmental management unit (EMU) specifically to manage Government responsibilities \nfor  the  Project.    The  Government  has  also  created  a  Watershed  Management  and  Protection \nAuthority  (WMPA)  as  well  as  a  resettlement  committee  to  oversee  implementation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s social obligations throughout the project. \n\nB. \n\nKey Safeguard Documents \n\n4. \nThe  package  of  safeguard  documents  prepared  for  the  Project  comprises  three  core \ndocuments:  (i)  the  environmental  assessment  and  management  plan  (EAMP);    (ii)  the  social \ndevelopment  plan  (SDP)\u2014which  includes  the  resettlement  action  plan  (RAP)  and  ethnic \nminorities  development  plan  (EMDP)  for  reservoir  inundation  on  the  Nakai  Plateau,  the  RAP \nand  EMDP  for  land  acquisition  for  project  civil  works  and  downstream  channels,  and  the \nresettlement and livelihood restoration and EMDP for impacts in the downstream areas; and (iii) \nthe  social  and  environmental  management  framework  and  operational  plan  (SEMFOP)  for  the \nNakai Nam Theun\u2013National Protected Area (NNT-NPA).   \n\nEach  of  these  documents  provides  background  and  technical  information  on  the \n5. \nmanagement  and  mitigation  measures  proposed  to  address  adverse  impacts,  the  institutional \nresponsibilities  for  implementation,  and  the  monitoring  and  supervision  programs  designed  to \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n57\n\nensure  compliance  with  all  commitments  made  by  the  developers  and  the  Government.  The \ncore safeguard documents are supported by a large number of specialized technical analyses \nthat have been carried out on a variety of subjects over many years.    \n\nC. \n\nSummary of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation \n\n1. \n\nNakai Plateau \n\nThe  major  environmental  impacts  in  this  zone  will  result  from  the  inundation  of \n6. \napproximately 450 km2  of the Nakai Plateau.  The principal adverse environmental  impact will \nbe the loss of terrestrial and aquatic habitats on the plateau.  This loss of habitat will increase \npopulation  pressures  on  wildlife  that  are  dependent  on  these  habitats.    There  are  also \npotentially serious water quality issues associated with the NT2 reservoir. These arise from the \ndecomposition of organic matter in the reservoir, which will create low oxygen and high nutrient \nlevels.    Under  such  conditions,  problems  would  be  created  both  in  the  reservoir  itself  and  in \ndownstream receiving waters.  Most importantly, poor water quality in the reservoir would affect \nthe  viability  of  reservoir  fisheries  programs.    Other  issues,  such  as  the  influx  of  construction \nworkers  into  the  project  area,  could  create  potential  health,  safety,  and  natural  resource \nmanagement problems.  The reservoir also has the potential to modify the tributaries that feed \nit.    Finally,  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  reservoir  would  contribute  to  global  carbon \ndioxide levels. \n\n7. \nThe  EAMP  provides  a  thorough  analysis  of  habitat  types  that  will  be  lost  on  the  Nakai \nPlateau.  As compensation for the impacts on natural habitats, the Project will finance the long-\nterm  management  of  the  NNT-NPA  and  corridors,  in  addition  to  species-specific management \nprograms  for  the  plateau  area.    Other  key  initiatives  will  focus  on  (i)  management  of  water \nquality  in  the  reservoir  through  possible  vegetation  clearing;  (ii)  avoiding  or  minimizing  the \nimpacts  of  the  resettlement  area,  the  headrace  channel,  and  access  roads;  and  (iii)  the \nrelocation  and  upgrading  of  Road  8b.    Mitigation  measures  for  these  and  other  impacts  have \nbeen incorporated into the project design.   \n\n8. \nCompensatory Forestry. In addition to the environmental offset to be provided by the \nProject to protect the NNT-NPA, the Project will restore the forest area that will be lost because \nof the inundation of the reservoir area. The degraded areas with a crown cover less than 20% \nwhere compensatory forestry work could be undertaken have been earmarked.  They consist of: \n(i) the degraded forests within the NNT-NPA; (ii) the area reserved for the sustainable forestry \ncomponent of the Nakai Plateau RAP; and (iii) degraded forests on the Nakai Plateau that will \nnot be affected by the inundation. If these areas are not sufficient, degraded forests outside the \narea  affected  by  the  Project  could  be  considered.  The  preliminary  assessment  of  degraded \nforests  in  the  Project  area  found  approximately  32,000  ha  of  degraded  forest  within  the  NNT-\nNPA, out of which about 28,000 ha could be set aside for natural regeneration. It is believed at \nthis stage that several hundred hectares could qualify under the sustainable forestry component \nof  the  RAP.  A  preliminary  assessment  estimates  about  15,000  ha  would  qualify  for  natural \nregeneration  with  very  limited  interventions  required;  5,000  ha  for  reforestation  and/or \nrehabilitation interventions; and 8,000 ha for low-intensity silvicultural interventions.  \n\n9. \nAfter  financial  closure,  the  Government  and  Nam  Theun  Power  Company  Limited \n(NTPC) will develop a more detailed implementation plan and cost estimates for compensatory \nforestry activities. The Government and NTPC will identify specific areas where compensatory \nforestry work will be undertaken. Specific activities include (i) site selection, (ii) a survey of the \ndegraded area and potential compensatory forestry sites in consultation with the people of the \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\narea, (iii) establishment of appropriate arrangements for managing the new forestry assets, and \n(iv)  groundwork  to  cause  rehabilitation/reforestation  of  the  degraded  land  for  assisted  natural \nregeneration,  enrichment  planting,  seed  broadcasting,  and  planting.  Since  there  are  many \nactivities  that  will  require  NTPC\u2019s  immediate  attention  after  financial  closure,  such  as  the \nresettlement  of  the  project-affected  people  on  the  Nakai  Plateau  and  mitigation  measures  for \nthe impact in the Xe Bang Fai basin, compensatory forestry activities on the ground should take \nplace  around  the  time  of  inundation  of  the  reservoir.  NTPC  has  agreed  to  provide  adequate \nfunds and human resources to undertake the work. \n\n2. \n\nNakai Nam Theun National Protected Area \n\n10. \nThe  establishment  of  project  construction  work  camps,  reservoir  clearance  activities, \nupgrading  and  development  of  roads,  and  the  formation  of  the  reservoir  will  create  additional \nthreats  to  the  NNT-NPA  and  its  corridors.  The  Project  will  lead  to  increased  access  to  the \nwatershed area and will require the conversion of a small portion of natural habitats.  The main \nchallenges for the successful implementation of the conservation program of the NNT-NPA and \ncorridors  are:  control  of  illegal  wildlife  trade,  commercial  and  illegal  nontimber  forest  products \ncollection, and limiting habitat conversion that results from resource extraction such as logging \nand  mining  as  well  as  some  agricultural  practices.    The  management  plan  for  the  area \n(SEMFOP)  is  designed  to  address  these  issues.    The  project  also  provides  secure  30-year \nfinancing  for  the  management  of  the  NNT-NPA  and  the  adjacent  corridors  linking  the  region\u2019s \nprotected areas. \n\n3. \n\nDownstream of the Powerhouse in Xe Bang Fai Basin \n\n11. \nThe  impacts  in  this  zone  relate  to  the  increase  in  water  flow  in  the  Nam  Phit  and  Xe \nBang Fai as well as to construction activities associated with ancillary developments such as the \npowerhouse, the regulating pond, construction work camps, and the conveyance channel.  The \nwater flow in the Xe Bang Fai will increase by an average of about 260 cubic meters per second \n(m3/second), which represents a near doubling of the current monthly average flows (minimum \nmean  about  20\u201330  m3/second  and  maximum  mean  940  m3/second).    Because  of  the  Project, \nthe mean dry season flows will increase by about 10 times and the mean wet season flow by \nabout 35%.   Powerhouse operations will require changes in the weekly flow variations, with low \nflows on Sundays when power will not be produced.  \n\n12. \nThe  new  flow  conditions  in  the  Xe  Bang  Fai  will  eliminate  the  current  low  flow  period \nduring  the  dry  season  and  are  that  is  likely  to  result  in  increased  streambank  erosion.  Dry \nseason aquatic habitats such as rapids and shallow areas which may be favored by fish during \nthis  season  will  be  permanently  submerged.  In  addition,  once  the  powerhouse  is  operational, \nwater  with  different  quality  characteristics\u2014including  dissolved  oxygen  and  nitrogen  content, \nbiological oxygen demand, temperature, and turbidity\u2014would mix with the water of the Xe Bang \nFai.    At  a  minimum,  these  changes  are  expected  to  lead  to  sharp,  short-term  declines  in  fish \nproductivity along the length of the Xe Bang Fai.  The nature, scope, and time implications are \ndifficult to model with any precision.  However, experience from the nearby Theun-Hinboun dam \nindicates  that  these  impacts  are  likely  to  be  serious.    Fisheries  losses  of  50\u201380%  can \nreasonably be expected. \n\n13. \nThere  will  be  large-scale  activity  in  this  zone  during  construction  of  the  powerhouse, \nsubstations, regulating pond, downstream channel, and transmission lines.  These construction \nworks and the associated infrastructure such as worker camps, access roads, and quarries will \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n59\n\nresult in some conversion of natural habitats and other impacts related to construction activities \nsuch as dust, noise, land acquisition, air quality, site erosion, waste, and work camp. \n\n4. \n\nDownstream of Nakai Dam in Nam Theun-Nam Kading Basin \n\n14. \nThe flow of the Nam Theun at the dam site will decrease significantly from a mean flow \nof 260 m3/second (range 25 to 3,000 m3/second) to a proposed 2 m3/second. The main impacts \nwill  be  experienced  in  the  areas  between  the  dam  and  the  Theun  Hinboun  Headpond, \napproximately 50 km downstream of the Nakai dam.  The reduced flow in the Nam Theun will \nreduce the habitat for fish and aquatic organisms and cut off migration of fish in the Nam Theun. \nThe  reduced  flows  in  the  Nam  Theun  would  also  weaken  the  dilution  effects  for  incoming \ntributary flows downstream of the dam.  This would lead to more acute water pollution problems \nin the longer term as tributary inflows become more degraded from upstream pollution sources \nin and around Lak Sao.  Combined with the effects of the Theun Hinboun dam, this is expected \nto  reduce  the  productivity  of  fish  and  other  aquatic  organisms  in  the  area  significantly.  In \naddition,  pollution  caused  by  unrelated  mining,  industrial  and  domestic  activities  is  becoming \nmore problematic.   \n\n15. \nIn the upper tributaries of the Nam Theun, unlike downstream Nam Theun or Xe Bang \nFai, the Project will not affect the overall hydrological characteristics. The dam will be a barrier \nto the migration of fish from the lower Nam Theun and Mekong up to the tributaries. Migration \nfrom the reservoir will continue, although it will be a number of years before this is possible. The \nEAMP and SEMFOP provide for the establishment of special conservation areas for parts of the \nreservoir as important seasonal nursery ground for fish. Although specific data are not available \non which species migrate into the tributaries, it is expected that migration declines in the upper \ntributaries in the NNT-NPA, and that the local populations who depend more on the sedentary \nfish which will not be affected.  \n\nDownstream of the Theun Hinboun dam, flows will also decrease because of the change \n16. \nin the spills over the dam into the Nam Kading, further affecting fish habitats in that area, and \nprobably reducing populations of fish.  Also, the number of days with the current minimum flow \nof 5 m3/s will increase from the current 120 days to about 175 days. The combined effects of the \nProject  together  with  the  pre-existing  conditions  of  Theun  Hinboun  will  contribute  to  regional \ncumulative  effects  by  further  reducing  migration  and  requiring  Theun  Hinboun  to  modify  its \nminimum  flow  regime  below  the  dam.    In  this  zone  there  will  also  be  impacts  from  the \nconstruction  of  the  dam  and  road  upgrading.  The  construction  works  and  the  associated \ninfrastructure such as work camps, access roads, spoil disposal, and quarries will result in some \nconversion  of  natural  habitats,  and  impacts  related  to  construction  activities,  such  as  local  air \nquality, erosion, waste, and work camp management. \n\n5. \n\nMekong River \n\n17. \nThe  project  operations  will  result  in  changes  to  the  seasonal  flows  in  the  Mekong \nbetween  the  confluence  of  the  Nam  Kading  and  the  Xe  Bang  Fai.  A  reduction  in  both  wet \nseason  (approximately  7  cm)  and  dry  season  (23\u201329  cm)  flows  in  that  stretch  of  the  Mekong \nRiver is expected, Flows below the confluence of the Xe Bang Fai will also be affected but will \nbe attenuated as one moves further downstream. Due diligence assessment undertaken by the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  task  team  indicates  that  the  social,  economic  and  ecological  impacts  of  these \nchanges are likely to be insignificant, particularly in the Song Kram river in northeast Thailand.  \nDevelopment  of  planned  hydro  upstream  on  the  Mekong  is  considered  to  be  much  more \nsignificant in the long run. \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nIt is estimated that the Mekong at Phnom Penh will be 2 cm higher in the dry season and \n18. \n8 cm lower in the wet season, and that the maximum height of the wet season in the Tonle Sap \nwill decrease slightly (i.e., 3 cm as opposed to 2.5\u20133.0 m normal fluctuation in the wet seasons).  \nWhile  it  is  possible  to  estimate  some  of  the  hydrologic  and  hydraulic  implications  of  these \nchanges, it is virtually impossible to isolate the results of the changes and their impacts on the \necology of the Mekong system. \n\nD. \n\nSummary of Social Impacts and Mitigations \n\n \n\nScope of Resettlement Impacts. Land acquisition and resettlement and related social \n\n19. \nimpacts are anticipated in four geographic zones.  \n \nThe Nakai Plateau. The communities of the plateau will be affected by the creation of \n20. \nthe  NT2  reservoir  and  approximately  1,120  households  in  17  villages  will  be  physically \nrelocated. Relocation will entail loss of rice fields, fields for other crops and vegetables, forest \nland,  and  fishing  grounds;  associated  social  stress;  and  changes  in  lifestyles  and  livelihoods.  \nResettlement of the reservoir-affected villages is described in detail in volumes 1 and 2 of the \nSDP, which includes a RAP, and the EMDP.  \n\n21. \nThe  Nakai  Nam  Theun  Watershed.  The  1,150  households  in  the  NNT-NPA  and  the \n3,750 households in the peripheral impact zone (PIZ) could experience adverse social impacts \nas a result of limitations placed on currently unrestricted access to the natural resources of the \nNNT-NPA. The Government has developed a management framework and operational plan to \neffectively protect the watershed and its forests, habitats, wildlife and biodiversity values, and at \nthe  same  time  safeguard  the  well-being,  traditional  livelihoods,  and  culture  of  its  human \ninhabitants. Resource management  plans developed through the community planning process \nmay impose restrictions on quantities, timing, and types of resources that can be extracted by \nlocal communities.  They may be affected by improved enforcement of existing legislation, such \nas those concerning wildlife hunting, and the establishment of regulations concerning land and \nresource use.  In general, however, villages in the NNT-NPA and PIZ will benefit from enhanced \nland  and  resource  use  rights,  improved  livelihoods  through  participatory  natural  resource \nmanagement  activities,  and  improved  access  to  infrastructure  and  services.  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement  is  triggered  by  the  potential  resource  access  restrictions  for  these \nethnic  minorities  and  a  resource  access  restriction  framework  and  an  EMDP  have  been \nprepared and included in the SEMFOP. In addition to the possible resource access restriction, it \nis  expected  that  fish  migration  in  the  Nam  Theun  upstream  of  the  dam  will  be  reduced,  as \ndescribed in the downstream areas resettlement and livelihood restoration and EMDP, volume 3 \nof the SDP. \n\n22. \nDownstream  of  the  Powerhouse  in  Xe  Bang  Fai  Basin.  The  impacts  in  this  zone \nrelate  largely  to  the  increase  in  water  flow  in  the  Nam  Phit  and  Xe  Bang  Fai  during  project \noperation, as well as from construction activities associated with ancillary developments such as \nthe powerhouse, the regulating pond, construction work camps, and the conveyance channel. It \nis estimated that approximately 40,000 people living along the mainstream Xe Bang Fai will be \ndirectly affected by fisheries losses due to the Project. Approximately 15,000 of these may also \nbe  affected  by  losses  to  riverside  assets,  gardens,  domestic  water  supply,  and  access. \nApproximately  10,000  more  people  in  hinterland  villages  not  located  on  the  mainstream  Xe \nBang Fai river also use the Xe Bang Fai for fishing and collection of aquatic products. Impacts \non property and livelihood will be fully compensated and restored, as described in more detail in \nvolume 3 of the SDP.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n61\n\nDownstream of Nakai Dam in Nam Theun-Nam Kading Basin. No permanent villages \n23. \nare located on the main stem of the river in the area downstream of the NT2 dam until the head-\npond  of  the  Theun  Hinboun  dam.  However,  there  are  villages,  mainly  inhabited  by  ethnic \nminorities, that live on the tributaries and nearby areas that use this area of the Nam Theun for \nfishing. About 40 villages with 22,000 people have been identified as occasionally fishing in the \nmain tributaries of the Nam Theun. The reduced flow in this area could affect these fisheries by \nreducing  the  habitat  and  restricting  fish  migration.  The  impacts  on  village  livelihoods  with \nrespect to fisheries have been estimated to range from 10% to 35% in tributaries and as much \nas 60% in the main stream of the Nam Theun. These estimates are considered to be worst-case \nscenarios  and  are  described  in  more  detail  in  volume  3  of  the  SDP,  which  also  includes  an \nEMDP. \n\nProject Construction Lands. The Project will require exclusive use of up to 6,480 ha of \n24. \nland (during the construction phase) for project infrastructure, including the transmission lines, \naffecting  approximately  1,100  households  (6,700  people).  This  land  will  need  to  be  acquired \nwith associated compensation and income restoration to current owners. The main impact areas \nwill  be:  (i)  Oudomsouk  town  on  the  Nakai  Plateau,  where  approximately  one-third  of  the  town \n(approximately  220  households  with  1,890  people)  will  need  to  be  relocated  to  make  way  for \nsaddle  dams  and  other  project  construction;  and  (ii)  the  Gnommalat  Plain  where  150 \nhouseholds will be relocated, mainly for the transmission line, and another 500 households will \nlose agricultural land for construction of the 27-km long downstream channel.  Land acquisition \nfor project construction land is addressed in the resettlement plan for project lands, volume 4 of \nthe  SDP.      Volume  4  also  includes  an  EMDP  to  address  the  issues  related  to  the  Vietic  and \nHmong  populations  along  the  transport  corridor  of  national  road  8B,  which  will  be  improved \nunder the Project; in Oudomsouk; and on the Gnommalat Plain. \n\n25. \nScope  of  the  Resettlement  Plans  and  Resource  Access  Restriction  Process \nFramework. As part of project preparation, a social and gender analysis was carried out in the \nproject areas. A census, an inventory of losses, and a socioeconomic survey were carried out \nfor the Nakai Plateau and project lands. A population count, inventory of land and assets, and \nsocioeconomic  survey  were  undertaken  for  the  downstream  Xe  Bang  Fai  areas  that  might  be \naffected by erosion or flooding, and a population count, a fisheries survey, and a socioeconomic \nsurvey were conducted on fishers in the Xe Bang Fai and the Nam Theun and their tributaries.  \nA  population  count  was  undertaken  in  the  NNT-NPA  and  PIZ.  The  following  resettlement  and \nethnic minority planning documents have been prepared as part of the SDP: (i) Nakai Plateau \nRAP and EMDP; (ii) downstream areas resettlement and livelihood restoration plan and EMDP; \nand  (iii)  project  lands  RAP  and  EMDP.  As  part  of  the  SEMFOP,  a  resource  access  restriction \nframework  and EMDP  have been  prepared for the watershed. The various RAPs  and EMDPs \nwill  be  updated,  and  an  RAP  will  be  prepared  for  the  SEMFOP  after  detailed  design  and \nparticipatory  planning  for  any  resource  access  restrictions  or  land  acquisition.    A  gender \nassessment  was  also  undertaken  for  the  Project,  and  a  gender  action  plan  and  strategy  was \nprepared and mainstreamed into the SDP and SEMFOP. \n\n26. \nLegal Framework. The three RAPs and a resource access restriction framework have \nbeen  prepared  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Operational  Directive  4.12  on  involuntary \nresettlement.  These  plans  have  been  prepared  in  compliance  with  laws  of  the  Government  of \nLao  PDR,  principally  the  Constitution  (1991)  and  the  Land  Law  (2003),  and  follow  the  NT2 \nResettlement  Policy,  which  was  prepared  for  the  Project  in  1998  and  revised  in  2002.  \nProvisions and principles adopted in the SDP and SEMFOP for the Project will supersede the \nprovision of relevant decrees currently in force in Lao PDR wherever a gap exists.  In addition, \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nthe social component requirements and commitments of the Project are laid out in schedule 4 of \nthe  concession  agreement  that  has  been  revised  to  cover  the  final  SDP  and  SEMFOP.  The \nconcession agreement acknowledges that the SDP and its Plans have been developed and that \nthe  Government  is  responsible  for  the  SEMFOP,  and  NTPC  and  Government  are  jointly \nresponsible  for  the  SDP.  The  concession  agreement  also  states  that  where  higher  standards \nthan those in the NT2 Resettlement Policy exist, the higher standards shall apply. \n\nto  provide \n\n Entitlements.  The  Project  entitlements  have  been  designed \n\n27. \nfor \ncompensation,  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  for  lost  land,  assets,  infrastructure,  resources, \nincome sources, and services, so affected people would be at least as well off after the Project \nas they would have been in the absence of the Project.  Resettlers affected by reservoir flooding \nwill  be  assisted  to  materially  improve  their  standard  of  living  above  the  national  poverty  line \nwithin 4 years of relocation.  Other poor and vulnerable households affected by land acquisition \nfor  project  lands  or  affected  in  the  downstream  areas  will  be  helped  to  improve  their \nsocioeconomic  status.  Nonvulnerable  households  will  be  assisted  to  restore  their  preproject \nsocioeconomic status. People with and without legal title to land will be treated equally.  Proof of \nresidency  or  traditional  use  from  the  village  administration  is  required  to  establish  the  right  to \ncompensation. A separate entitlement matrix has been prepared for each RAP and included in \nthe concession agreement. \n\nEthnic  Minorities  and  Other  Vulnerable  Groups.    All  resettlers  in  the  reservoir  area \n28. \nand  in  the  NNT-NPA  and  PIZ  are  members  of  ethnic  minorities,  as  are  the  majority  of  the \nresettlers in Oudomsouk and the Gnommalat Plain, and Mahaxai, and a significant proportion of \nthe  population  in  the  Xe  Bang  Fai  basin.  The  overall  aims  of  the  social  safeguard  planning \ndocuments are to: (i) address the important issue of culturally-sensitive development for project-\naffected people, (ii) significantly improve the livelihoods and standard of living of project-affected \npeople from ethnic minorities, (iii) provide effective safeguard against adverse impacts, and (iv) \nensure that the affected people have been consulted fully and have participated in the decisions \nthat  affect  them.  The  resettlement  and  livelihood  development  in  the  Nakai  Plateau  involves \nconsiderable  changes  to  cultures  and  livelihoods,  whereas  the  compensation  for  loss  of  land \nand  restoration  of  production  in  the  downstream  areas  will  not  have  such  a  strong  impact. \nHouseholds may be vulnerable for a variety of reasons, including poverty levels (the majority of \nhouseholds  affected  by  the  Project  live  below  the  official  poverty  line),  ethnicity  (some  ethnic \ngroups make have difficulties adapting to sedentary agriculture) and household characteristics \n(such as households headed by a widow, female, handicapped person or male over 60 years of \nage). Special attention will be given to addressing the special needs of vulnerable groups and \nhouseholds.  This may include provision of labor to build houses, provision of rice and protein \nsupplement  during  the  transition  to  stability,  culturally-sensitive  and  appropriate  consultation, \nand livelihood programs. \n\n Resettlement  Strategy.  The  only  area  where  significant  relocation  of  affected  people \n29. \nwill occur is on the Nakai Plateau. Fifteen and a half villages will relocate from the reservoir area \nto fully-serviced resettlement sites on 20,800 ha of land and forest on the edge of the plateau.  \nThese sites have been allocated to the reservoir resettlers by prime mininsterial decree. Each \nresettled household will be given title to residential and irrigated agricultural land. One and a half \nvillages (Nam Nian and the Brou half of Sop Hia) have chosen to move off the plateau back to \nNam Pan in Bolikhamxay Province from where they originated. The host village of Nam Pan will \nbenefit from shared irrigation, education, and health services.  The people from the Vietic half of \nSop Hia have chosen to join another Vietic village in the plateau resettlement area. Resettling \nvillages will participate in detailed village planning before relocation. Resettlement sites will be \ncontain  a  complete  infrastructure,  including  domestic  and  irrigation  water  supply  and  finished \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n63\n\nhouses  before  people  move  into  the  sites.  Resettlers  have  the  option  of  being  employed  by \nNTPC  to  build  their  resettlement  sites,  thereby  taking  on  a  sense  of  ownership,  or  of  having \nNTPC  hire  contractors  to  develop  and  build  the  sites.  All  potential  sites  have  undergone \nenvironmental assessment. \n\n30. \nNTPC  and  the  Government  moved  three  plateau  hamlets  onto  one  resettlement  site \n(Nong Boua), with the agreement of the World Bank and the panel of experts before there was \nan  approved  RAP.  ADB  has  conducted  due  diligence  and  confirms  that  the  resettlement \nimplementation is in compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies. This first resettlement site \n(termed the pilot village) is included in the approved RAP for the plateau.  The resettlers in this \nat  this  site  will  continue  to  benefit  from  the  full  resettlement  program  together  with  all  other \nplateau resettlers. \n \n31. \nOne-third of Oudomsouk town on the Nakai Plateau will also be displaced to make way \nfor  project  construction  activities  and  219  households  and  businesses  and  some  affected \nservices will be relocated to fully-serviced sites within an expanded and improved Oudomsouk. \nAnother 105 households will move from under the transmission lines and back onto remaining \nland  beyond  the  right  of  way.  All  relocating  households  will  be  given  title  to  their  replacement \nland.   \n\nLivelihood Restoration. The approach to resettlement throughout the SDP is livelihood \n32. \nrestoration, or improvement in the case of vulnerable groups. The approach to resettlement of \nthe reservoir-affected resettlers is based on restoring and improving livelihoods using verifiable \nincome targets established in the concession agreement and subject to independent monitoring. \nThis  approach  to  income  restoration  and  livelihood  improvement  uses  a  set  of  farming  and \nlivestock  models,  plus  exclusive  access  to  forest  and  fishery  resources  which  have  been \ncombined  with  other  land  use  and  employment  options  to  make  up  the  household  livelihood \nmixes. Resettlement planning and the resettlement program have been developed on the basis \nof  detailed  technical  analysis  of  the  livelihood  models.  The  resettlement  package  for  reservoir \nresettlers aims to significantly improve the livelihood of villagers to be relocated and provides a \ncomprehensive  package  of  housing,  infrastructure,  land,  social  services,  and  a  livelihood \nprogram.  The current livelihood plan will be incorporated into village and household level plans \nduring implementation. Some  villages, particularly the Vietic and, to a lesser degree, the Brou \nand  Bo,  are  more  vulnerable  than  the  Tai  and  may  have  more  difficulties  adapting  and \nbenefiting  from  new  and  improved  livelihood  systems.    Measures  to  assist  such  villages  and \nother vulnerable households have been incorporated into the project design. \n\n33. \nOptions for income restoration in downstream and project lands communities have also \nbeen  designed  in  consultation  with  affected  people.  For  land-based  losses,  replacement  land \nwill  be  a  priority.    Where  replacement  land  is  not  available,  or  where  cash  compensation  is \npreferred and can be managed, other options will be considered that revolve around options for \nself  employment  or  other  non-land-based  livelihoods  that  will  enable  restoration  of  preproject \nsocioeconomic  status.  Income  and  protein  from  downstream  fisheries  losses  will  be  restored \nthrough alternative livelihood options, such as replacing fish loss with fish ponds.  These will be \ndeveloped through a participatory process and put in place before commercial operations. \n\n34. \nTransitional Support and a Phased Exit Strategy for Plateau Resettlers. The Project \nis taking a development approach by aiming to improve living standards and livelihoods, rather \nthan just resettling people and restoring their impoverished preproject conditions. To do this, a \npackage  of  livelihood  activities  that  are  similar  to  the  pre-project  livelihood  activities  is  being \nmade  available.    This  may  include  some  dry  and  wet  season  rice  and  dry  season  gardens, \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nsome  livestock,  some  fishing,  some  nontimber  forest  product  harvesting  for  subsistence  and \nsale.  To  make  these  activities  more  productive,  the  Project  is  providing  inputs,  initially  fully \nsubsidized, but with a plan to gradually phase out subsidies as families become able to support \nthemselves.  This is combined with land tenure, improved health and education to make them \nsecure and able to work and absorb the new concepts.  Households without labor will be helped \nto enter into income-generating activities that are not labor-intensive. Vulnerable households will \nbe provided with food support until they can become self-sufficient. Resettlers and construction \nworkers  and  camp  followers  will  be  provided  with  education  about  social  risks  of  sexually \ntransmitted  diseases,  especially  (HIV/AIDS),1  drug  use,  alcoholism,and  trafficking.  Resettlers \nwill also be provided with household crisis support to cope with changing social conditions. \n\n35. \nParticipatory  Process,  Disclosure  and  Grievance  Mechanism.  The  planning \napproach  followed  to  date  has  enabled  full  participation  of  the  resettlers  in  the  detailed \nresettlement planning process so that their concerns and needs are fully reflected in the project \ndesign.  This  approach  allows  flexibility  and  adaptability,  particularly  in  the  design  of  the \nhousehold  livelihood  activities,  so  they  are  tailored  towards  the  needs  and  situation  of  each \nindividual  household.  Local  level  consultations  on  the  draft  SDP  and  SEMFOP  began  early \n2004  and  have  been  targeted  at  the  affected  villagers.  Information  on  compensation, \nresettlement  and  livelihood  options  has  been  presented  to  all  affected  people  by  trained \ncommunity  and  district  facilitators  through  radio  broadcasts  in  minority  languages,  easily \nunderstandable  visual  materials  together  with  verbal  explanations,  site  visits  to  proposed  and \npilot  resettlement  areas,  and  open  discussions  and  feedback  on  proposals,  concerns  and \npreferences.  All  affected  persons  have  been  informed  and  consulted  about  the  impacts, \nproposed  mitigation  and  rehabilitation  measures.  A  detailed  summary  of  all  final  resettlement \nplanning  documents  will  be  disclosed  to  affected  people.  To  ensure  that  the  basic  rights  of \nproject-affected  peoples  are  protected  and \ntheir  concerns  adequately  addressed  and \nentitlements  delivered,  a  grievance  procedure  will  be  implemented.  A  senior  provincial  official \nwill head a project grievance committee which will include members of the Justice Department, \nthe  Ethnic  Council,  resettlement  committee,  civil  society,  and \nLao  Women\u2019s  Union, \nrepresentatives  of  project-affected  people.  The  first  level  of  complaint  will  be  the  village \nresettlement  committee;  the  last  resort  will  be  the  court.    In  the  event  that  the  grievance \nmechanism is not effective, the panel of experts will be the final arbiter.  \n\n36. \n Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Monitoring  will  determine  whether  the  resettlement \nprograms undertaken by NTPC and the Government are achieving their objectives. Monitoring \nwill be carried out both internally and externally in accordance with schedule 4 of the concession \nagreement.  Internal  monitoring  by  the  NTPC  resettlement  office  and  the  Government\u2019s \nresettlement management unit will focus on the process and physical progress of resettlement \nimplementation  against  the  schedule  in  the  SDP,  following  a  participatory  approach.  External \nmonitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  an  independent  monitoring  agency,  focusing  on  changes  in \nsocial  and  economic  conditions  of  individual  households.  The  concession  agreement  requires \nan  independent  assessment  of  whether  SDP  implementation  has  met  the  plateau  RAP\u2019s \nobjective  of  ensuring  that  its  specific  income  targets  have  or  will  be  reached.  These \nassessments  will  be  made  by  two  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  bodies.  The  first \nassessment  will  be  made  by  the  independent  monitoring  agency  with  extensive  experience  in \nsocioeconomic surveys and analysis and rural development. Second, an international panel of \nsocial  and  environmental  experts  will  provide  reports  to  NTPC  and  the  Government  stating \nwhether  environmental  and  social  safeguards  and  funding  agency  guidelines  have  been \ncomplied  with  and  whether  mitigation  measures  and  resettlement  procedures  adequately \n\n                                                 \n1   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n65\n\nprotect  both  the  environment  and  the  interests  of  those  affected  by  the  Project.  Project \nsocioeconomic impacts, including the well-being of ethnic minority groups on the Nakai Plateau, \nthe watershed, and the Xe Bang Fai downstream areas, will be closely monitored. Such external \nmonitoring will be carried out for the duration of SDP implementation, which is likely to extend \nover  9  years.  The  independent  monitoring  agency  will  send  reports  directly  to  ADB  and  the \nWorld Bank. \n\n37. \nImplementation  Schedule.  Annual  work  plans  will  be  prepared  for  all  resettlement \nactivities.  Resettlement  activities  will  be  coordinated  with  the  civil  works  schedule,  so  that \nadequate time will be allowed for resettlement activities to be satisfactorily implemented before \nthe relevant civil works begin. For project lands, before civil works begin on a particular project \nland or group of project lands, all compensation will have been paid, relocation will have been \ncompleted satisfactorily, and rehabilitation measures will be in place. Relocation to resettlement \nsites  will  begin  only  when  the  sites  have  been  prepared,  the  infrastructure  and  domestic  and \nirrigation water supply is in place, and houses are ready for occupancy.   \n \nCost  Estimates.  NTPC  has  agreed  to  comply  with,  implement  alone  or  jointly  with \n38. \nanother  party,  and  bear  the  cost  of  the  environmental  and  social  commitments  laid  out  in  the \nconcession agreement. The NTPC is therefore responsible for covering the cost of all mitigation \nand management measures, including the financing of Government agencies established for the \npurpose  of  the  Project.  Based  on  the  concession  agreement,  NTPC  will  provide  $47.7  million \ntowards  implementation  of  the  SDP.  About  $9  million  more  will  be  made  available  for \ninstitutional  capacity  building:  $1  million  for  environmental  and  $8  million  for  social  issues. \nNTPC will provide a further $31.5 million to support the SEMFOP. NTPC has to provide letters \nof credit to the Government as security in case, for example, the panel of experts deems that it \nhas  failed  to  comply  with  the  environmental  and  social  commitments  and  to  mitigate  or \ncompensate  any  unforeseen  project  impact.  Table  A4.1  presents  the  current  amounts \ncommitted by NTPC to cover resettlement costs. The project lands budget is still being adjusted \nupwards to reflect the inventory of losses and necessary livelihood restoration accurately. \n\nTable A4.1: Resettlement Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\nUp to COD \n\nItem \n \nNakai Plateau \nProject Lands \nDownstream (Xe Bang Fai and Nam Theun) \nTotal \nCOD = commercial operation date \nSource: Nam Theun 2 Power Company Limited estimates. \n\nUp to end of \nConcession \n   27.4 \n    2.0 \n   16.0 \n45.4 \n\n 18.8 \n  2.0 \n  7.0 \n27.8 \n\n \n39. \nHealth.  NTPC  has  undertaken  a  comprehensive  health  impact  assessment  following  a \nWorld Health Organization model, and prepared a preliminary public health action plan (in the \nSDP) for construction and operation phases.  This is designed not only to mitigate all identified \nsignificant  risks  to  acceptable  levels,  but  to  improve  local  conditions.  The  public  health  action \nplan includes a resettlers health program and a regional health program. The head construction \ncontractor  is  finalizing  a  staff  health  program  to  ensure  preventive  and  curative  measures \nsafeguarding  health  and  safety  of  workers  and  their  families,  and  to  prevent  and  mitigate \npotential  health  effects,  such  as  communicable  diseases,  of  the  influx  of  project  staff  on  the \nlocal  population.  The  plans  include  HIV/AIDS  and  drug  use  awareness  and  preventive \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\neducation  programs  for  communities,  workers,  and  spontaneous  settlers.    A  detailed  public \nhealth  action  plan  is  being  prepared  by  SOS  International  and  implementation  will  begin \nimmediately after financial closure. \n\nConstruction  Phase  Social  Management  Plan.  Approximately  4,000  workers  and  up \n40. \nto 16,000 camp followers (families of workers and services providers) could have a significant \nimpact  on  the  social,  health,  and  economic  dynamics  of  all  project  land  areas,  especially  in \nNakai, Gnommalat and Lak Sao. The combination of the potentially dramatic population influx, \nthe sudden increase in eating and drinking establishments, and the availability of employment \ncash  could  produce  extremely  high  risks  and  negative  impacts.  Gender  concerns  that  often \nemerge  during  large  infrastructure  projects  include:  (i)  an  increase  in  sexually  transmitted \ninfections,  most  importantly  HIV/AIDS;  (ii)  the  introduction  of  illegal  trafficking,  especially \ninvolving women and adolescents; (iii) inflation of local market prices caused by high levels of \ndemand  and  limited  supply;  (iv)  a  rise  in  alcohol-related  diseases;  and  (v)  higher  levels  of \nphysical abuse and mental illness (caused by the first four concerns and by the social traumas \nassociated  with  habitat  and  cultural  changes).  Strong  social  regulations  and  serious \nenforcement  procedures  are  essential  to  avoid  putting  the  security  and  health  of  the  local \npopulation  at  risk.  The  Khammuane  governor  has  issued  a  Decision  on  Social  Order \nManagement for the Nam Theun 2 Construction which sets this in place.  A social management \nplan  has  been  prepared  (in  the  SDP)  and  this  includes  a  recruitment  policy  for  local  labor;  a \nsocial management and mitigation program for camp followers that addresses issues related to \nhealth,  population  management  and  security,  infrastructure,  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of \nlocal  organizations  to  control  and  support  camp  followers;  a  human  trafficking  awareness  and \npreventive  education  plan;  and  an  appropriate  budget.    The  head  contractor  also  has \ncontractual obligations to control and care for the construction workers. \n\nDetails  of  expected  social  and  environmental  impacts  are  contained  in  Supplementary \n\n41. \nAppendix B.  \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\nThe Project will be implemented jointly by the Government and NTPC. The concession \n42. \nagreement  specifies \nfurther  clarified  and \nthe  respective  responsibilities,  which  were \nstrengthened  during  the  project  appraisal  mission.  Within  NTPC,  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementation will rest with the Environmental and Social Management Division.  Supervision \nof construction site management will rest with the head construction contractor (HCC).  Within \nthe Government an environmental management unit (EMU) has been set up within STEA and a \nresettlement  management  unit  (RMU)  has  been  established  which  reports  to  the  resettlement \ncommittee chaired by the governor of Khammuane Province. The NT2 watershed is managed \nby the WMPA, chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. The NTPC division and the \nthree  Government  units  are  currently  operational.    Core  staff  are  being  hired.  The  institutional \narrangements, staffing and budgets are detailed in the safeguard documents (EAMP, SDP, and \nSEMFOP) and summarized below: \n\n43. \nNTPC. The  company  has  established  an  environment  and  social  division  to  implement \nits  obligations  under  the  concession  agreement,  which  include  the  implementation  of  the \nresettlement and livelihood restoration programs with RMU, monitoring the performance of the \nHCC,  providing  technical  assistance  to  EMU,  financing  the  conservation  offset,  and  reporting \nprogress to Government and IFIs. The Division, headed by a director, will have offices in Nakai, \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n67\n\nThakek  and  Vientiane,  and  about  70  staff.    It  has  about  40  staff  at  present  and  the  entire \ncomplement  will  be  hired  within  6  months  of  financial  closure.    NTPC  also  plans  to  outsource \nwork to private consultants and operational nongovernment organizations (NGOs), which will be \nengaged after financial closure. \n\n44. \nHCC.  The  HCC,  under  the  oversight  of  NTPC,  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nmeasures  to  control  or  minimize  impacts  during  the  construction  period  and  will  supervise  the \nwork  of  construction  contractors  and  their  subcontractors.    This  will  include  among  other \nimportant  measures:  meeting  effluent  standards,  noise  control,  erosion  control,  on-site  waste \nmanagement, and implementing a worker health program.  A full description of these measures \nis provided in the EAMP and the HCC EMMP. \n\nEMU.  The  Government\u2019s  EMU  is  responsible  for:  oversight  of  NTPC\u2019s  environmental \n45. \nactivities,  review  and  approval  of  the  HCC-EMMP,  coordination  within  Government  of  the \nimplementation  of  various  aspects  of  the  environmental  plan,  monitoring  and  supervising  the \nenvironmental  measures  of  NTPC,  appointing  an  independent  monitoring  agency,  monitoring \nNTPC compliance, and disseminating communications and information to external parties.  The \nEMU will have offices in Vientiane as well as in the field, and will have around 15 staff. \n\n46. \nRMU. The Government\u2019s RMU and NTPC will have joint responsibility for implementing \nresettlement  and  livelihood  restoration  programs.  The  range  of  tasks  includes:  day-to-day \nmanagement of the resettlement process with NTPC, facilitating the participation of government \nauthorities \ninformation \nin  resettlement  planning,  carrying  out  public  consultations  and \ndissemination  throughout  the  resettlement  process,  managing  the  Government  budget  for  the \nresettlement  process,  and  relocating  project-affected  persons.  The  RMU  reports  to  the \nresettlement  committee,  and  is  supported  by  district  resettlement  working  groups  and  village \nresettlement  and  development  committees.  The  RMU  will  execute \nthe  Government\u2019s \nresponsibilities relating to land acquisition, resettlement, and restoration of livelihoods. \n\n47.  WMPA .  WMPA  oversees  the  implementation  of  SEMFOP.  It  is  headed  by  a  board  of \ndirectors representing various stakeholders, and managed by an executive secretariat, headed \nby a director.  The WMPA was established by Government Decree 25, 2001, and has a broad \nmanagement mandate for the Nakai Nam Theun watershed area. Its activities will be guided by \nthe  SEMFOP.  Its  responsibilities  include:    conservation,  maintenance  and  promotion  of    the \nbiodiversity of the NNT-NPA, building and strengthening capacity of communities, districts and \nWMPA  staff,  facilitating  improvements  to  livelihoods  of  inhabitants  of  the  watershed  area, \nmanaging activities specified in the operational plans of the SEMFOP, partnering with NGOs to \nimplement  SEMFOP  activities,  and  employing  an \nits \nperformance.  It is expected to have about 50 staff, who will be hired over a three-year period \nafter financial closure.  \n\nindependent  monitor \n\nto  assess \n\n \n\n2. \n\nBudget and Contingency  \n\n48. \nThe  budget  for  implementing  environmental  and  social  safeguards  and  managing  the \nconservation offset is estimated to be $90 million over the life of the project. Detailed estimates \nare provided in the safeguard documents and summarized below.   \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTable A4.2: Environment and Social Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n \nSocial \nEnvironment \nWatershed Management \nSocial and Environment Remediation Fund \n\nTotal \n\nTo the end of \nConcession \n47.7a \n3.8 \n31.5a \n7.5 \n90.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n    a Includes resettlement costs of $45.4 million as indicated in Table A4.1. \n    Source: Nam Theun 2 Power Company Limited estimates. \n\n \n49. \nThe NTPC is also making provisions to cover a range of contingencies through the use \nof cost over-run allowances, performance guarantees, and various forms of insurance. If costs \nare exceeded for those items limited by costs, NTPC has provided for a letter of credit of up to \n$2.5 million to be used by Government. For those items limited by scope, NTPC will continue to \nfinance activities until the objectives of the scope of the activity are achieved and endorsed by \nthe  panel  of  experts.  NTPC  will  also  obtain  insurance  cover  for  implementing  some  of  the \nmitigation measures, when available. NTPC is also providing $7.5 million in letters of credit for \nbreach or failure to fulfill its obligations under the concession agreement. NTPC is also setting \nup  an  environmental  and  social  remediation  fund  for  the  benefit  of  the  resettlement  villages \nduring  the  post-Commercial  Operation  Date  period  to  operate  communal  facilities.  For  the \nresettlement program, NTPC is obliged to extend the implementation period until the outcome \n(household income) targets have been met without a financial cap. \n\n50. \nIn  addition,  NTPC  is  providing  a  further  $10  million  as  a  guarantee  for  dealing  with \nunanticipated impacts stemming from project implementation. The eligibility and mechanisms for \nuse  of  these  funds  have  been  reviewed  and  changes  to  the  concession  agreement  will  be \nintroduced by the Government and NTPC. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nRisk Management \n\n51. \nIt is recognized that there are risks associated with the proposed resettlement program. \nThe  risks  are  two-fold:  the  first  is  further  impoverishment  of  resettlers  who  are  already  well \nbelow the poverty line; the second is the failure to achieve the outcome targets.  The targets for \nthe plateau resettlers are (i) the household income target (to be achieved by each household in \nall villages no later than 4 years after the village has been relocated), and (ii) the village income \ntarget (to be achieved by all villages no later than 7 years after relocation of the village).  The \nrisk for project lands and downstream area affected people is that they will be worse off socially \nand  economically.  The  resettlement  risks  are  reflected  in  the  relatively  weak  capacity  in  Lao \nPDR to implement a development-oriented resettlement program, and the difficulty of mobilizing \ncritical  staff  within  a  required  time-frame  in  order  to  execute  the  program  satisfactorily.    The \nsubstantial change in livelihoods for the plateau resettlers and the ambitious targets add to the \nrisk of achievement failure.  A long-term risk of the plateau resettlement program is the heavy \nexternal  support  required  by  resettlers  during  the  transitional  period.  This  could  result  in \ndependency that could affect their livelihood sustainability. The influx of population following the \nconstruction camps could also have broad impacts in the project areas, particularly on the host \nethnic minority groups.  If not properly managed through anticipatory and pro-active measures, \nthe  construction  camps  could  have  long  lasting  social  impacts  upon  the  host  population.  In \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n69\n\nrecognition  of  these  risks,  the  project  has  responded  by  developing  a  number  of  strategies  to \nmitigate or manage risks.  \n\n52. \nInstitutional  Capacity  Build-up.  In  the  concession  agreement,  NTPC  and  the \nGovernment agreed to share responsibility for implementing the SDP.  They have developed a \ndetailed plan for institutional development and staffing.  Human resources will be mobilized from \nwithin  Government  and  the  private  sector.    The  NTPC  resettlement  office  will  mobilize \ninternational  assistance  to  strengthen  implementation  of  the  SDP.    NGOs  will  be  engaged  to \nimplement some of the programs. \n\n53. \nBaseline Planning and Budgeting. The  project  developers  have  invested  heavily  in \npreparatory work to understand and plan for the environmental and social risks of the Project.  \nFunding for the proposed programs appears satisfactory and the organizational division of labor \nand accountabilities appropriate. \n\n54. \nAdaptive  Management.  The  proposed  mitigation  measures  are  based  on  best \nestimates  of  likely  impacts.    However,  not  all  impacts  can  be  anticipated  nor  all  future \nopportunities  predicted.    It  is  accepted  by  all  stakeholders  that  some  adjustments  to  the \nmitigation  program  may  be  needed  during  the  course  of  project  implementation.    The  project \nbudgets and work plans will be reviewed annually and adjustments to scope and nature of work \nmade if necessary. Flexibility is key to success of the mitigation plans.  \n\n55. \n\u201cAdaptive  management\u201d  is  a  key  element  in  the  overall  environmental  management \napproach.  The  principles  of  adaptive  management  involve  modifying  environmental  programs \nbased on monitoring and evaluation of the environmental performance of specific actions.  By \ndefinition,  this  is  an  iterative  process  which  requires  intensive  monitoring.    The  EAMP  and \nconcession  agreement  both  recognize  the  need  for  a  flexible  approach  to  environmental \nmanagement  that  accommodates  periodic  changes  in  scope  or  the  objective  of  a  specific \nmeasure. \n\n56. \nContinuous Stakeholder Consultation. One of the most important mechanisms of the  \nadaptive  management  approach  is  a  continuous,  ongoing  stakeholder  consultation  process.  \nThis will help to identify issues as they emerge so that appropriate modifications can be made to \nbudgets,  staff  resources,  and  technical  assistance.    Ongoing  consultation  will  be  an  essential \nelement of the Project\u2019s overall monitoring mechanisms. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nDisclosure, Local Consultations and International Workshops \n\n57. \nPublic consultation and disclosure of environmental and social information prepared for \nthe project were, and will continue to be, undertaken in accordance with ADB, World Bank and \nGovernment  requirements.    To  date,  the  project  design  has  benefited  from  an  open  public \nconsultation  and  disclosure  process  unprecedented  in  the  Lao  PDR.    During  the  project \npreparation  phase,  NTPC  and  Government  conducted  a  large  number  of  community  briefing \nsessions intended to solicit feedback on the project concept and the design of resettlement and \nenvironment mitigation measures.  \n\n58. \nThe draft safeguard documents were made available in the Lao PDR between May and \nAugust 2004. The summary environment and social impact assessment was circulated to ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors on 29 November 2004 in accordance with ADB\u2019s environment policy.  \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nThe latest SDP documents have been prepared in full consultation with affected people. \n59. \nResettlement  information  on  project  impacts  and  entitlement  options  has  been  disclosed  to \naffected  people  in  the  various  project  areas  in  local  commune  offices,  public  meetings,  and \nindividual households. \n\n60. \nFeedback  from  stakeholders  has  influenced  or  been  incorporated  into  project  planning \nand  design.  For  example,  the  following  project  design  features  are  attributed  to  public \nconsultations:  (i) location  of  the  power  station  to  avoid  resettlement,  (ii)  routing  of  the \ndownstream  channel  to  minimize  resettlement  and  other  impacts,  (iii)  construction  of  the \nregulating  pond  to  minimize  fluctuations  in  daily  discharge  into  the  Xe  Bang  Fai,  (iv) \nembankment protection at the confluence of the downstream channel and the Xe Bang Fai, (v) \ninclusion of aeration structures to improve water quality in the regulating pond and downstream \nchannel, and (vi) commitment to shut down operation before natural over bank flooding in the \nupper Xe Bang Fai. \n\n \n\n5. \n\n61. \nThe  consultative  process  during  project  preparation  is  only  part  of  the  overall  project \ncommunications and consultation strategy.  There are specific plans for continuing a pro-active \nprogram  of  public  meetings  throughout  the  project  implementation  period.    The  goal  of  these \npublic  briefings  is  to  ensure  that  people\u2019s  concerns  are  being  heard  and  that  appropriate \ninformation  is  shared  at  all  stages.    These  consultations  are  in  addition  to  highly  participatory \nimplementation  processes  where  the  affected  people  play  a  major  role.  Details  of  the \nconsultation efforts are provided in Appendix 5. \n \n \n \n62. \nA  description  of  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework  for  the  project  is  provided  in \nTechnical  Annex  3  of  Appendix  2.  It  has  three  levels:  (i)  internal,  (ii)  external,  and \n(iii) independent.  Internal monitoring will be undertaken by NTPC and the relevant Government \nunits,  which  are  in  the  process  of  establishing  acceptable  monitoring  protocols.  External \nmonitoring  will  be  composed  of  the  Lender\u2019s  technical  adviser  and  the  Government\u2019s \nindependent monitoring agencies for EAMP, SDP and SEMFOP. Independent monitoring will be \ncontinued by the panel of experts, the international advisory group and the dam safety review \npanel.  \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n71\n\nCONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE \n \n\nOverview \n\nA. \n \n The  public  consultation  process  undertaken  during  preparation  of  the  Nam  Theun  2 \n1. \n(NT2) Hydroelectric Project (the Project) has provided an opportunity to engage project-affected \npeople  and  stakeholders  at  the  local,  national,  regional,  and  international  levels.  The  principal \nobjectives  of  this  process  have  been  to  (i)  facilitate  detailed  project  planning,  design,  and \nimplementation  by  taking  into  consideration  community  perspectives;  (ii)  reduce  negative  and \nenhance positive community impacts from the project through the participation and involvement \nof  directly  affected  stakeholders;  and  (iii)  increase  public  awareness  and  understanding  of  the \nProject. \n \n2. \nConsultations with directly affected people, carried out since 1996, have taken a number \nof forms. These meetings were intended to share information with project-affected people on the \nnature, scale, and timing of planned developments, as well as to solicit feedback and inputs to \nimportant  elements  of  the  environmental  assessment  and  management  plan  (EAMP),  the \nresettlement action plan (RAP), and the ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) for the Nakai \nPlateau. These consultations were documented by the Government of Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic  (the  Government)  and  the  Nam  Theun  2  Power  Company  Limited  (NTPC)  and  were \nused to design major aspects of the social and environmental management plans. By the end of \n2003,  NTPC  and  the  Government  had  organized  several  hundred  public  meetings  and \ninformation exchange events throughout the project area.   \n \nConsultations  carried  out  since  early  2004,  covering  the  entire  project,  have  taken  into \n3. \naccount the lessons learned from the previous period and have been guided by the basic tenets \nof  transparency,  balance,  and  meaningfulness.  All  impacts  and  risks,  both  positive  and \nnegative,  mitigation  and  compensation  measures  for  negative  impacts  and  risks;  general \nconcerns of the affected population; and grievance procedures were discussed.  \n \n4. \nA series of national and international workshops were organized, addressing questions \non  the  basic  design,  economic  analysis,  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  proposed \nmitigation measures of the Project. These workshops discussed the macroeconomic context for \nthe Project, including sources of economic growth and strategies for poverty reduction available \nto  the  Lao  PDR,  Thai  power  demand  scenarios,  hydropower  development  options  in  the  Lao \nPDR, and management of Government revenues from the Project.  \n \nB.  \n \n5. \nto  ensure  development \neffectiveness and sustainability of development projects. They create opportunities for informed \ndebate,  enhance  transparency  and  accountability,  strengthen  public  support,  reduce  risks, \nfacilitate collaboration among parties concerned, and improve the quality of project design and \nimplementation. Conceptually, disclosure and consultation are mutually supportive activities. \n \n6. \nA  number  of  policy  statements  describe  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s) \nexpectations  with  regard  to  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  groups  and  concerned \nstakeholders. The ADB\u2019s new Public Communication Policy, which is expected to be approved \nby  the  Board  in  2005  provides  detailed  guidance  on  disclosure  of  project  documents  to  the \npublic.  The goal  is  to  ensure  that  affected  people  and  interested  stakeholders  have  access  to \ninformation about a project to improve their understanding and facilitate their participation in a \n\nInformation  disclosure  and  consultation  are \n\nADB Policies and Expectations \n\nimportant \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nChallenges to Meaningful Consultation in the Lao PDR Context \n\nmeaningful  process  of  consultation.  Such  information  should  be  available  in  a  timely  manner \nand in a format and content understandable to project-affected people and other stakeholders. \nADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  on  environment,  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment as well as sector policies, including the water policy provide guidance in effective \nconsultation with the project-affected people.   \n \nC. \n \nIt is not an easy task to conduct meaningful consultation in the Lao PDR. It is one of the \n7. \npoorest  countries  in  the  world.  Only  half  the  population  can  read;  70%  of  the  population \ncomprises  ethnic  groups  who  speak  different  languages  and  dialects.  Basic  infrastructure  to \nfacilitate public access to information and services is still limited in various parts of the country. \nThe Lao PDR has no indigenous organizations that might be viewed as the beginnings of a civil \nsociety  independent  from  the  Government.  Organizations  affiliated  to  the  Communist  Party, \nsuch as the Lao Front for National Construction, the Federation of Trade Unions, the People\u2019s \nRevolutionary Youth Union, and the Federation of Women\u2019s Unions, are considered to be civil-\nsociety  organizations.  Their  functions  are  to  help  the  Government  to  \u201cunite  and  mobilize  the \npeople\u201d  but  they  also  represent  villagers\u2019  interests  and  concerns.  Members  of  these \norganizations  were,  and  continue  to  be,  actively  involved  in  consultation  decision-making \nprocesses,  especially  at  the  local  level.  The  Government  does  not  encourage  local  non-\ngovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  has  limited  capacity  to  effectively  disseminate \ninformation and organize public consultation.  \n \n8. \nAlthough  decision  making  is  generally  a  top-down  process  in  the  Lao  PDR,  the \nGovernment  has  made  recent  efforts,  often  with  international  support,  to  improve  its \nparticipatory planning methods and strengthen capacity of village- and district-based institutions \nto participate in decision making on development interventions and public planning. The Project \nis one such instance, having followed a consultation process unprecedented in the country.  \n \nD. \n \n9. \nFive target groups were identified as key stakeholders: (i) the project-affected people; (ii) \ndistrict, provincial, and national government officials; (iii) civil society, NGOs operating in the Lao \nPDR (particularly those in the project area), and international NGOs; (iv) international financial \norganizations;  (v)  industries;  and  (vi)  other  interest  groups.  These  target  groups  were  also \nfurther categorized as follows:  \n \n\nIdentification of Key Stakeholder Groups \n\nin \n\nLocal.  All  households  and  villagers \nthe  Nakai  Plateau,  downstream \ncommunities in the project area (downstream channel, Xe Bang Fai, Nam Theun, \nthe  transmission  line  corridor,  etc.)  who  are  directly  affected  by  project \nimplementation.  \nRegional.  Community  leaders,  district  agencies,  provincial  agencies,  mass \norganizations  and  businesses  and  contractors  who  have \nimplementation \nresponsibilities for various aspects of the mitigation and compensation programs. \nNational.  Government  ministries,  other  government  organizations,  academia, \nNGOs, and the media. \nInternational.  Other \ninternational  power  utilities  and  dam  developers, \ninternational  financial  institutions  (such  as  the  World  Bank,  ADB,  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD),  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB),  NTPC \ninvestors and financial institutions, international NGOs, and international media. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n73\n\nThe Local Consultation Process up to 2003 \n\nE. \n \n10. \nThe  Government  and  NTPC  have  conducted  and  documented  more  than  200  public \nmeetings and consultations from 1996 to 2003. The consultation process was reviewed during \nthis  period.  Most  of  the  activities  were  organized  during  1996\u20131997,  when  the  basic \nsocioeconomic  and  cultural  research  was  being  undertaken  predominantly  by  CARE  and  The \nWorld Conservation Union (IUCN). Although most consultations at that time were concentrated \non the Nakai Plateau, other project areas were also covered: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nNakai Plateau. It is reported that all villages in the reservoir area were consulted \nand involved in the resettlement study. \nNT2 watershed. Twelve villages were involved in the socioeconomic and culture \nsurvey  in  1996;  17  sites  were  included  in  the  IUCN  study  in  1997  of  the \nenvironmental  and  social  action  plan;  and  27  villages  within  the  Nakai  Nam \nTheun National Protection Area (NNT\u2013NPA) were involved in the information and \nconsultation workshop in 1997.    \nDownstream  channel.    Twenty-one  villages  in  Gnommalat,  Mahaxai,  and  the \nupper and lower Xe Bang Fai were consulted in 1997. \nXBF River. Twenty-four villages along the upper, middle and lower segments of \nthe river were consulted in 1997. \nTransmission line corridor. Representatives of 128 villages were consulted. \n\n \n11.  Methodologies and techniques for public consultation were designed to suit the needs of \neach  target  audience,  such  as  by  making  use  of  visual  and  pictorial  graphics  where  literacy \nrates were low, setting up focus groups separating males and females, inclusion of consultation \nstaff  of  different  ethnic  groups.  NTPC  visited  the  demonstration  resettlement  farm,  and  the \nresettlement  village  of  the  Theun  Hinboun  dam.  Project  documents  and  summaries  were \ntranslated  in  Lao  for  local  leaders  and  regional  officials  and  placed  in  the  NTPC  offices  in \nVientiane, Nakai, and Thakhek, and on the NT2 website.  \n \n12. \nConcerns  and  recommendations  of  stakeholders  provided  through  these  consultations \ninfluenced the EAMP and especially the social development plan (SDP) [the resettlement action \nplan  (RAP)  and  the  EMDP]  on  such  matters  as  the  location  of  resettlement  villages,  house \ndesign,  village  layout,  livelihood  models,  compensation  plan  and  design  of  the  downstream \nchannel.  Nonetheless,  one  criticism  was  that  the  1996\u20132001  consultation  process  was  biased \ntoward promoting the positive benefits of the project while the negative impacts and risks were \nlargely  downplayed.    Meetings  of  this  sort  in  the  Lao  PDR,  at  the  time,  felt  more  like  official \nforums. The consultation process did not necessarily reflect accurately village social structure or \ncultural  practices  where  decision-making  is  concerned.  Cultural  differences,  languages,  and \nfacilitating skills played an important role in these meetings. Limitations lay not so much in the \nwillingness of people to speak out, but rather in the lack of a process wherein government and \nproject  officials  would  be  explicitly  responsive  to  what  people  were  saying.  Given  that  the \ninteraction  with  the  government  is  through  district  level  officials  from  rural  backgrounds,  the \npotential for success has always been there.  \n \nF. \n \n13. \nConsultations carried out since 2004 have taken into account the lessons learned from \nthe  previous  period  and  have  been  guided  by  the  basic  tenets  of  transparency,  balance  and \nmeaningfulness. It was felt that the consultation process must be valuable for all stakeholders: \nvillagers,  the  Project,  the  private  sponsors,  and  the  Government.  All  impacts  and  risks,  both \n\nThe Local Consultation Process Since 2004 \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\npositive and negative, needed to be made clear at the outset. Mitigations for negative impacts \nand  risks,  including  appropriate  compensation,  needed  to  be  agreed  upon.  Grievance \nprocedures  should  be  firmly  in  place  to  allow  affected  people  to  appeal  and  resolve  issues  if \nagreements are not implemented.  \n \n14. \nThe  basic  reorientation  was  made  to  promote  a  process  where  local  people  spoke  out \nmore  and  project  and  government  officials  mostly  listened.  Village  facilitators,  selected  from  a \ncross-section  of  society,  were  trained  to  carry  out  the  consultations,  speaking  in  their  own \nlanguage, and proceeding in accordance with their own cultural norms. Since a large portion of \nthe villagers in the reservoir and watershed areas are illiterate, a range of written and graphic \nmaterials were made available for use by the village facilitators, including information manuals \nand  pictorial  posters.  A  village  forum,  composed  of  small  groups,  carried  out  a  dialogue  on  a \nrange of topics, aiming to achieve consensus at the village level. At the end of the forum, there \nwas  a  wrap-up  meeting  among  the  district  resource  team  and  village  facilitators,  where  the \nfindings  and  next  steps,  to  be  shared  with  NTPC,  were  discussed  and  agreed  to.  The  village \nreports  were  made  available  through  the  village  information  centers.  Subsequently,  NTPC \nteams returned to the villages to explain the design changes to the local consultations.  \n \n15. \n\nConsultations covered all project areas: \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nNakai Plateau. All 17 villages in the area that will be inundated by the reservoir. \nNT2 watershed. Thirty-one villages (through 12 consultation sessions) and four \nvillages of the peripheral impact zone. \nXe  Bang  Fai.  Seventy  of  the  89  villages  in  the  mainstream,  backwaters,  and \ntributaries. \nNam Theun. A representative sample of villages (15) located on the tributaries. \nProject  lands  (acquired  for  ancillary  works  including  transmission  lines).  All \nvillages in sites that have already been identified.  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n \n16. \nThe  process  was  coordinated  by  an  experienced  ADB  consultant  from  Thailand,  who \ntrained  the  village  facilitators  and  followed  the  process  throughout.  The  process  was  also \nobserved by an independent World Bank consultant, well acquainted with the area and the Lao \nlanguage.  Both  have  reported  on  the  process  and  attest  to  the  unprecedented  level  of \ntransparency and participation achieved. \n\n \n\nNational Workshops \n\nG. \n \n17. \nProvincial  and  National  Government  Agencies.  Because  project  implementation \ninvolves  various  government  jurisdictions  and  organizations,  the  consultative  process  focused \nconsiderable attention on briefing and seeking inputs from community leaders, and from district, \nprovincial, and national government agencies. A series of workshops have been organized for \ngovernment  entities  in  order  to  fully  inform  them  of  the  project  activities  as  well  as  to  inform \nthem of their responsibilities during project implementation. \n \nNongovernment Organizations. While there are a number of international NGOs active \n18. \nin the Lao PDR, few domestic NGOs work at the national level.  Thus, effective consultation with \nLao  civil  society  remains  highly  constrained.  Nevertheless,  the  project  sponsors  have  created \nnumerous  opportunities  for  international  NGOs  and  Lao  mass  organizations  such  as  the  Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union and the Lao Front for National Construction to participate actively in the review \nprocess. This has been accomplished through specific targeted events to share information and \nseek  input  from  NGOs,  and  by  establishing  channels  of  communication  such  as  websites, \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n75\n\nChanges to Project Design \n\nInternational Workshops in Bangkok, Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC, and Vientiane \n\nresponding  to  written  inquiries,  directly  involving  NGOs  in  field  research,  and  by  organizing \noccasional site visits.  \n \nH. \n \n19. \nThe  Government,  project  sponsors,  and  international  financial  institutions  organized \nworkshops  to  brief  international  interest  groups  including  conservation  NGOs,  human  rights \ngroups,  government  representatives,  other  financial  institutions,  parliamentarians,  and  the \nmedia, in Thailand, France, Japan, the United States, and the Lao PDR. These meetings took \nplace  in  August  and  September  2004  and  attracted  nearly  800  participants.  The  workshops \nwere designed to share important information about the nature of the Project (including aspects \npertaining  to  the  rationale  for  the  Project,  the  cost\u2013benefit  analysis,  and  management  of \nGovernment  revenues  from  the  Project),  and  to  discuss  the  issues  and  the  actions  taken  to \nminimize  or  eliminate  potential  risks  associated  with  the  project.  The  international  workshops \nwere  conducted  by  independent  moderators,  who  issued  reports  on  the  proceedings  and \nsummary  of  the  discussions  in  each  venue.    A  full  discussion  of  these  consultations\u2014times, \nplaces where meetings were conducted, participants, and issues raised and discussed\u2014can be \nfound in the three safeguard documents.  \n \nI. \n \n20. \nFeedback from local consultations and from national and international workshops have \nsignificantly  informed  and  modified  project  design.  The  EAMP,  social  and  environmental \nmanagement  framework  and  operational  plan  (SEMFOP)  and  SDP  document  the  changes \nintroduced to the Project. Some specific examples are as follows: project works have been sited \nso  as  to  minimize  resettlement  and  environmental  impacts;  resettlement  sites  have  been \nchosen  in  response  to  preferences  expressed  by  the  affected  population  on  the  plateau;  a \nregulating pond has been included in the overall scheme and will be operated in a way which \nminimizes  daily  fluctuations  in  the  downstream  area;  aeration  structures  were  included  to \nimprove water quality in downstream channels; the powerhouse and reservoir will be operated \nso as to limit natural over-bank flooding in the Xe Bang Fai. An adaptive management program \nhas  been  introduced,  based  on  extensive  monitoring  and  adjustment  of  program  design  as \nneeded during implementation.  \n \n21. \nThe local consultation process has confirmed general community support for the project \nand for a diverse package of livelihood options. It has documented local preference with respect \nto sensitive cultural sites such as spirit forests, and has helped to identify local priorities in areas \nsuch  as  flood  protection,  electricity  supply,  fisheries  etc.  The  consultations  also  helped  clarify \nrights and responsibilities of various stakeholders, and the Government has accordingly enacted \nspecific  legal  measures  to  protect  such  rights  of  the  affected  people.  Change  matrices  have \nbeen  prepared  by  the  developer  and  will  be  disclosed  jointly  with  the  final  version  of  the \nsafeguard documents.  \n \nJ. \n \n22. \nThe draft safeguards documents (EAMP, SDP, SEMFOP, and summary environmental \nand  social  impact  assessment)  and  several  technical,  economic  and  contractual  documents \nhave  been  widely  disclosed  in  country  at  the  Science  Technology  and  Environment  Agency \n(STEA), and NTPC public information centers, in Nakai, Thakek and Vientiane, and through the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  InfoShop  and  public  information  centers.  They  were  also  posted  on  the  Lao \nNational  Energy  Committee \nof  NTPC \n\n(www.poweringprogress.org) \n\nDisclosure of Information \n\nthat \n\nand \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n(www.namtheun2.com). Translated versions of these documents and/or substantial summaries \nwere prepared in Lao and made available in other languages.  \n \n23. \nNotification  informing  the  public  of  the  availability  of  these  documents,  inviting  public \ncomments  and  announcing  public  meetings,  was  made  in  a  timely  manner.  For  international \nstakeholder  meetings,  documents  were  made  available  30-90  days  in  advance.  In  addition  to \nmaking  available  technical  documents,  the  project  sponsors  and  the  Government  have  also \nmade  available  illustrations  and  graphics  in  an  easy-to-understand  form,  given  the  ethnic \ndiversity and low levels of literacy of population in the Project area.   \n\n \n\nOngoing Consultation During Project Implementation \n\nK. \n \nPublic consultation and disclosure of environmental and social information prepared for \n24. \nthe project and will continue to be undertaken during project implementation. The consultative \nprocess  followed  during  project  preparation  is  only  part  of  the  overall  project  communications \nand  participation  strategy.  The  SDP,  SEMFOP,  and  EAMP  explain  the  participatory  planning, \nimplementation and monitoring methods that will be employed in different areas of the Project. \nThere  are  specific  plans  for  continuing  a  proactive  program  of  public  meetings  and \ndissemination  of  information  through  the  project  implementation  period.  Participatory  planning \nprocesses  (e.g.,  forest and  land  use  planning and  management  in  the  NT2  watershed,  village \nplanning  in  the  plateau,  and  participatory  design  of  the  downstream  program),  local  radio \nprograms, resettlement committees at the local and provincial levels and other mechanisms will \ncontinue to play key roles in providing information and gathering inputs from affected people.  It \nshould  also  be  noted  that  the  consultation  process  that  has  been  put  in  place  since  2004  is \nrecursive. It (i) continually revises and adapts itself to better meet the needs of villagers, and (ii) \nlearns from ongoing discussions and the perceptions of the affected persons, providing inputs to \nproject design. It will be continued after financial close and effectiveness of the ADB operation, \nas the project moves into the detailed design and implementation phase.   \n \n25. \nThe  Government  plans  to  use  the  United  Nations  Development  Program  (UNDP)-\nsupported  roundtable  mechanism  for  monitoring  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication \nStrategy  and  progress  on  the  Project.    It  also  plans  to  convene  periodic  meetings  of  co-\nfinanciers  for  review  of  (i)  the  physical  progress  in  implementation  of  project  investments,  (ii) \nresults  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  social  and  environmental  impacts  and  outcomes,  (iii) \nmeasures  taken  to  address  unforeseen  events,  and  (iv)  other  dimensions  of  the  Project. \nPeriodic  workshops  at  the  national  and  international  levels  will  be  conducted  involving  the \ninternational community and civil society to allow exchange of information and discussion of the \nproject. In support of these processes, the Government has plans to further improve its capacity \nin  public  communications  and  media  relations  for  the  Project  and  will,  among  other  actions, \nimprove  its  project  website  and  ensure  that  it  is  provided  with  up-to-date  information  on  the \nProject. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n77\n\nSUMMARY OF PROJECT COST ESTIMATES \n($ Million) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nItem \n\nA.

While  an  \u201cenclave  project,\u201d  whereby  most  of  the  capital  investment  will  be  for  imported \nmachinery  and  equipment,  civil  works  will  still  be  significant  and  growth  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  could  be \nboosted  by  as  much  as  a  full  percentage  point  during  the  4\u20135  year  construction  phase.  In  turn,  this  will  lead  to \nincreased  per  capita  incomes,  lifting  an  estimated  60,000  people  above  the  poverty  line.  Once  commissioned  in \n2009/10, the Project will considerably boost Lao exports and foreign exchange earnings. Most importantly, the project \nwill  provide  a  major  new  source  of  revenues  to  the  Government  of  Lao  PDR  (the  Government),  an  estimated  $1.9 \nbillion  cumulative  revenue  during  the  concession  period.  The  current  weak  fiscal  position  of  the  Government  has \nmeant  poor  access  to  and  quality  of  public  services.  While  international  assistance  has  been  important  in  helping \novercome this constraint, a stronger revenue base is the long-run solution. The Project is an important component of \nthis  strategy,  whereby  private  sector  investment  strengthens  the  revenue  base  and  overall  economic  performance, \nlaying the basis for Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) to graduate from least developed country status. \n   \nFor  the  site  area,  the  Project  will  create  jobs  (e.g.,  in  commercial  farming  and  eco-tourism)  and  improve  facilitate \nbetter  transportation,  education,  health,  and  other  services  critical  to  poverty  reduction.  Khammuane  Province,  the \nprincipal site of the Project, has a high incidence of poverty 42% in 1997/98); Nakai district, where the water reservoir \nwill be created, is one of the poorest districts identified in the Government\u2019s National Growth and Poverty Eradication \nStrategy (2004) for priority action. Ethnic minority groups in the district are heavily dependent on subsistence farming \nand non-timber forest products. The construction phase will directly employ 4,000 people, with more than double this \nnumber of jobs created as a result of support services and other multiplier effects.  \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nPoverty  in  the  Lao  PDR,  and  in  the  site  area,  has  been  extensively  analyzed,  using  quantitative  and  qualitative \nmethods.  The  ethnic  and  cultural  dimensions  of  poverty  have  also  been  extensively  analyzed,  although  there  is  still \nmuch to learn regarding adaptation to new economic opportunities and the Lao understanding of poverty. \n \nLao  PDR  is  described  as  the  least  developed  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  countries  and  one  of  the  poorest \ncountries  in  Asia,  both  in  terms  of  per  capita  income  (about  $330)  and  in  terms  of  various  social  indicators  (life \nexpectancy at birth, 54 years, adult literacy 65%, and high infant and maternal mortality rates). According to the Lao \nexpenditure and consumption survey (LECS) undertaken in 1997/98, 38.6% of the population was below the poverty \nline  (based  on  food  and  non-food  requirements);  10.4%  of  the  poor  suffered  deep  poverty,  while  4%  was  severely \npoor.  Khammuane  Province  had  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  poverty  than  the  national  average,  but  the  depth  and \nseverity of poverty was slightly less.  \n \nAnalysis of the LECS III data (collected in late 2003 and early 2004) is not sufficiently advanced to provide updates on \nthe  above  findings,  except  perhaps  at  the  aggregate  level;  the  overall  incidence  of  poverty  is  indicated  as  having \ndeclined from 38.6% to 32.0% currently. Social and economic indicators from the LECS III indicate a more equitable \ngrowth  pattern  for  1997\u20132003,  in  contrast  to  1992\u20131998  when  the  lowest  income  quintile  experienced  a  drop  in \nconsumption while the upper income quintiles experienced sharp increases. The LECS III indicators also indicate that \nKhammuane Province has a population of about 320,000, with an average household size of 5.8 persons. Less than \n20% of the population is urbanized. There is relatively good rice availability but food consumption still accounts for 64 \nof overall consumption, compared to 55% nationally. Health services in the province are weak, with only one third of \nthe population with access to medical staff, a pharmacy or medical kits; maternal mortality rates are among the worst \nin the region. The low quality of education services is reflected in low enrolment rates, and high dropout and repetition \nrates.  \n\n \n\nThe project area is divided into three main zones. The Nakai Nam Theun National Protection Area (NNT\u2013NPA) and \nthe  Nakai  Plateau  zones  have  low  population  densities,  characterized  by  pronounced  ethnicity,  dependence  on \nsubsistence farming and limited or no access to infrastructure and services such as education, health, electricity and \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n79\n\nwater supply. The main ethnic groups are the Brou, Tai Bo, Vietic, and Tai Kadal. Women are especially affected by \npoverty, as they have burdensome family and farm duties (e.g., fetching water and fuelwood). In contrast, the Xe Bang \nFai  basin  zone  has  a  relatively  large  population  and  per  capita  income  well  above  the  national  average,  reflecting \nbetter  access  to  essential  services  and  to  markets,  a  more  diversified  economy,  and  higher  agricultural  productivity \ndue to irrigation. The main ethnic groups are the Lao Loum and Lao Theung.  \n \nThe participatory poverty assessment undertaken in 2000 and updated in 2002 indicated that the fundamental concern \nof poor households is food security, notably the availability of rice. Land acreage and quality, and animal diseases are \nimportant determinants of household  well-being. The desire for road access and electricity registered strongly in the \nparticipatory poverty assessment, as they so directly help improve household income. Education did not register as a \npriority for households; health services are used by only a third of the population, due to their inaccessibility and low \nquality.  \n \nConnecting the Poor \nResponses for ensuring that the environmental and social concerns are fully addressed include the following:  \n\n- \n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\nenvironmental assessment and management plan; \nsocial  development  plan,  which  makes  provision  for  the  resettlement  action  plan  and  ethnic \nminorities development plan for resettlers displaced by reservoir inundation; resettlement action plan \nand  ethnic  minority  development  framework  for  project  lands;  resettlement,  livelihood  restoration, \nand ethnic minority development plan for downstream areas; regional and resettlement health plans; \ngender strategy and action plan; \nsocial and environmental management framework and first operational plan,  which address issues \nrelated to the NNT\u2013NPA; \napproximately $90 million built into the project costs to fully manage and mitigate the environmental \nand social effects. \n\n \nConnecting the poor on a national basis will occur through careful management of the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) revenues \nthat  accrue  to  the  Government.  ADB  and  World  Bank  support  for  the  Project  includes  a  comprehensive  public \nexpenditure  management  program,  so  as  to  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  use  its  financial  resources \neffectively  and  efficiently  in  reaching  the  goals  and  targets  outline  in  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication \nStrategy.  \n \n\nC.

Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nA gender action plan and strategy (GAPS) has been prepared and mainstreamed into the social development plan \n(SDP) and social and environment management framework and operational plant (SEMFOP). A more detailed plan \nwill be prepared during project implementation after more detailed gender assessments have been carried out. A \nmajor focus of the GAPS is the gender sensitivity awareness and training of project staff, as well as gender-targeted \ninterventions such as health and gender-balanced livelihood training and gender-sensitive actions with support \ninstitutions. The GAPS includes gender-disaggregated data collection and gender monitoring. The Nam Theun 2 \nPower Company Limited (NTPC) will recruit an international institutional and gender specialist to provide periodic \nguidance.  NTPC and the Watershed Management and Protection Authority (WMPA) will both recruit full-time Lao \nnational gender specialists.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n     Yes \n\n   No \n\n\fSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks  \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan Required \n\n80 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nE. \n  \nItem \n\n \nResettlement \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \n\n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \nThree  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared:  one  each \nfor  the  reservoir  area,  the  downstream  areas,  and  the \nproject  lands.  A  resource  access  restriction  process \nframework has been prepared as part of the SEMFOP for \nthe watershed.   \n \n\ntargets \n\n \nThe  Government  has  developed  a  workforce  local  labor \nrecruitment policy which includes the following provisions: \n(i) \nfor  skilled  and  unskilled  Lao  nationals, \n(ii) recruitment  at  the  project  site  only  for  Lao  nationals \nresident  in  the  project  impact  zones,  (iii)  300  positions \nreserved  for  Nakai  resettlers  as  set  out  in  the  SDP, \n(iv) head  construction  contractor  and  subcontractor \nconstructions camps to provide at least the mid shift meal \nsourced from a catered mess, (iv) training to be provided \nto workers to improve their skills, and (v) gender-balanced \nrecruitment targets and no ethnic or sexual discrimination. \n \nThree  ethnic  minority  development  plans  have  been \nprepared  as  part  of  the  SDP  for  the  reservoir  area,  the \nProject construction areas and the downstream areas. An \nEMDP has also been prepared as part of the SEMFOP for \nthe watershed.  \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  generate  significant  revenue \nfor the Government. But proper channeling of the revenue \nto  the  intended  use,  particularly  to  the  poverty  reduction \nmeasures,  is  in  question.  Policy  framework  is  being \nimplemented \nto  create  macroeconomic  stability  and \npromote  good  governance  (institutional  and  financial). \nPublic \ncapacity-building \nassistance  is  being  provided.  Close  monitoring  and \nassistance is needed in this regard.  \n \nThe Project will increase the risk of health and other social \nimpacts such as HIV/AIDS and human trafficking.

The  analysis  includes  assessment  of  recent \nstudies  on  electricity  demand  and  the  role  of  the  Project  in  least-cost  generation  expansion \nplanning  for  each  country.  The  economic  costs  and  benefits  associated  with  the  Project, \nincluding  the  cost  of  a  dedicated  transmission  line  in  Thailand,  cover  the  construction  period \n(2005\u20132009)  and  a  25-year  operating  life  (2009\u20132034).  All  values  are  expressed  in  domestic \nprices  in  constant  2005  dollars  and  discounted  over  30  years  using  a  discount  factor  of  12%. \nFinancial values given in baht are converted at an exchange rate of B40/$. Risk and sensitivity \nanalyses have been undertaken with respect to key risk variables to examine the robustness of \nthe economic results. Finally, a regional distribution analysis has been prepared. \n\nDemand Forecasts \n\nA. \n \nAn annual total of 5,354 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from the Project is intended \n2.  \nto  serve  the  Thai  electricity  market.  Thailand  had  an  average  annual  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) growth rate of 2.8% during 1993\u20132002, when electricity demand grew by 6.4% annually. \nThe load forecast for Thailand is prepared as a collaboration of all key stakeholders; the August \n2002 load forecast is based on an annual economic growth of 4.7% and incorporates a demand \nreduction  of  928  megawatts  (MW)  as  a  result  of  demand-side  management.1  Growth  in \nelectricity  demand  is  expected  to  rapidly  absorb  existing  excess  capacity  resulting  from  the \neconomic  downturn  in  1997.  During  the  period  2005-2010  capacity  increases  on  the  order  of \n1,500 MW and 9,500 GWh annually will be required to meet demand.  Despite the substantial \ncapacity  of  the  Project,  it  will  supply  Thailand  with  less  than  7  months  of  a  single  year\u2019s \nadditional generation requirements.  \n \nThe Lao PDR is committed to purchase 200 GWh per year from the Project, but may buy \n3. \nup to 300 GWh. The Lao PDR power system is smaller than the Thai system. It consists of four \ngrids,  none  interconnected.  Current  electricity  consumption  is  estimated  at  211  kilowatt-hours \n(kWh)/capita per year and household electricity access is among the lowest in Asia, about 40%. \nHistorically,  domestic  consumption  has  been  small  in  relation  to  domestic  production  and \nexports. However, in the last decade imports have increased as a share of domestic production, \nand the share of exports has declined. In 2003, electricity exports (in GWh) were less than half \nthe level of domestic consumption.  \n \n4.   \nThe Project will primarily supply consumers in Khammuane and Savannakhet provinces \nin  Central  Region  2  (CR2)  and  consumers  in  Central  Region  1  (CR1),  including  Vientiane,  as \nthere  are  plans  to  interconnect  the  two  grids.  While  per  capita  consumption  in  CR2  (169 \nkWh/year)  is  below  the  national  average,  this  is  expected  to  change  with  the  location  of  new \nindustries  and  mines,  increased  incomes,  and  grid  extension.  Energy  consumption  in  CR2  is \nabout 200 GWh per year with a maximum demand of 48 MW. Demand in CR2 is met by imports \nfrom  Thailand,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  by  domestic  off-take  from  the  Theun  Hinboun  hydro \nproject.  By  the  time  the  Project  is  commissioned,  CR1  will  have  a  demand  of  938  GWh.  The \nleast-cost  strategy  is  to  add  capacity  only  when  it  can  be  fully  absorbed  by  the  system, \nbalancing any temporary deficit with imports from Thailand.   \n\n                                                 \n1   A revised version of the load forecast was prepared in January 2004, considering more optimistic economic growth \nexpectations. However, the earlier, more conservative load forecast  was adopted as the base case for least cost \nanalysis.  \n\n \n\n\f84 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nLeast-Cost Expansion \n\nB. \n \n5. \nThailand\u2019s  domestic  natural  resources  for  generation  include  natural  gas,  lignite,  and \nhydropower. Electricity capacity consists of combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) (71%), thermal \n(ignite  and  oil,  19%),  hydropower  (9%),  and  other  smaller  sources  (1%).  While  it  is  likely  that \nThailand  will  continue  to  rely  on  natural  gas  as  a  major  fuel  source,  diversification  of  fuel \nsources  is  advantageous  since  heavy  reliance  on  one  fuel  source  may  result  in  undesirable \nprice fluctuations in the power sector. Continued reliance on natural gas will also require further \ninvestment in the gas pipeline network and increased imports. \n  \n6. \nAs  part  of  due  diligence  for  the  Project,  the  World  Bank  and  Electricity  Generating \nAuthority of Thailand (EGAT) undertook an economic expansion planning evaluation of the Thai \npower  system  in  which  the  Project  was  modeled  as  a  candidate  competing  for  a  place  in  the \nexpansion  plan  along  with  a  range  of  fossil-based  alternatives.2  The  base-case  analysis \nconcluded that the Project should be included in the least-cost generation expansion plan from \n2010,  and  that  CCGT  capacity  would  be  the  next  best  alternative  to  the  Project.  A  cost\u2013risk \nframework  was  employed  to  determine  whether  the  Project  investment  decision  would  still  be \njustified taking into account the probability of different outcomes for key risks. Base, high, and \nlow  scenarios  were  developed  for  power  demand,  natural  gas  prices  and  project  cost,  and \nprobabilities  assigned  to  each  outcome.  The  cost\u2013risk  analysis  found  that  the  probability-\nweighted accumulated present value of real resource savings as a result of the development of \nthe  Project  is  $269  million  as  compared  with  the  CCGT-based  alternative,  close  to  the  base \ncase result of $277 million. In present value terms, these savings are equivalent to $0.012 per \nkWh sold from the Project. \n \nThe  Power  System  Development  Plan  (PSDP)  for  Lao  PDR3  analyzed  33  separate \n7. \nhydroelectric  power  projects  and  two  thermal  projects  that  had  been  identified  in  previous \nstudies. These candidates included projects with potential to provide foreign exchange earnings \nand  meet  domestic  power  needs.  Projects  were  initially  evaluated  solely  on  the  basis  of  their \nweighted average cost of generation. Environmental and social impact assessments were then \nincorporated for the short-listed projects. These projects were ranked according to their relative \neconomic  performance  adjusted  for  social  and  environmental  impacts.  The  proposed  Project \nranked first among all candidates evaluated, with an expected generation cost of $0.016/kWh, \nabout two thirds of the cost of the next-ranking project. \n\nValuation of Costs and Benefits \n\nC. \n \n8. \nThe basis for the project evaluation is the comparison of discounted benefits and costs \nbetween the with- and the without-project cases. The analysis considered the costs and benefits \nover  the  pre-development  period  (2004),  construction  period  (2005\u20132009)  with  project \ncommissioning  in  November  2009,  and  over  the  25-year  operating  life  until  2034.  The  total \nproject  investment  cost  in  financial  terms,  including  the  separately  funded  transmission  line  in \nThailand  but  excluding  the  costs  of  project  financing  and  interest  during  construction,  is \nestimated  to  be  $1,099  million  at  constant  2005  prices.  Annual  operating  costs,  including \nenvironmental  and  social  costs,  NTPC  administration,  the  Project  operating  costs,  and \n\n                                                 \n2   World Bank. 2004. Nam Theun 2 Project Economics Interim Summary Report. Washington, DC. \n3   Meritec Limited in association with Lahmeyer GmbH. 2004.

The regional economic analysis includes the cost of dedicated transmission line \nin Thailand to be separately funded by EGAT.  \n \n9. \nSystem losses in the Lao PDR and Thailand are excluded from the analysis since they \nare  common  in  the  with-  and  without-project  cases.  However,  losses  associated  with  the  NT2 \ndedicated  transmission  line  estimated  at  1%  per  year  are  included.  Costs  for  operation  and \nmaintenance of the transmission line are estimated at 1% of capital expenditure for the line plus \n2% for the substations and amount to US$1.9 million per year. The analysis includes an annual \nreduction of 275 GWh for the existing Theun Hinboun hydroelectric power project (THH), which \nshares the catchment area with the Project. \n \n10. \nCosts were classified as non-tradable and tradable goods, labor and services. Tradable \ncosts  were  converted  to  the  domestic  price  numeraire  using  derived  shadow  prices.  Tradable \ngoods, including capital, fuel and skilled foreign labor were converted using a shadow exchange \nrate factor (SERF) of 1.05.5 The Project location specific shadow price for domestic labor to be \nemployed at the construction site of 0.71 was applied to unskilled labor. Taxes and duties were \nexcluded from natural gas prices.  \n \nFor  the  regional  analysis,  benefits  were  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  defining  electricity \n11. \nconsumption  from  the  Project  as  non-incremental  for  replacing  existing  supply  of  energy,  and \nincremental  for  induced  demand.  Benefits  from  electricity  sales  to  Thailand  were  classified  as \nincremental  while  sales  to  the  Lao  PDR  were  defined  as  non-incremental  since  they  replace \nimports from Thailand. Non-incremental benefits of electricity are valued based on the economic \ncost of supply without the project, whereas incremental benefits are valued at an average of the \ncost  of  electricity  with  and  without  the  Project.  The  benefit  for  non-incremental  electricity  is \nbased  on  the  economic  cost  of  imported  electricity.  Incremental  benefits  are  valued  at  the \naverage willingness to pay for electricity estimated as the weighted average of the cost of the \nalternative energy source and the anticipated electricity tariff.  \n \n12.  Without  the  Project,  consumers  would  obtain  substitute  sources  at  the  avoided  cost  of \nsupply. The CCGT alternative to the Project represents an avoided cost of $0.050/kWh for Thai \nconsumers while the Project average tariff is $0.039/kWh. Incremental benefits are valued at the \nwillingness  to  pay  for  electricity  of  $0.045/kWh  estimated  as  the  average  of  the  cost  of  the \nCCGT  alternative  and  the  tariff.  For  Lao  consumers,  the  weighted  average  cost  of  imported \nelectricity  is  estimated  at  $0.062/Kwh,  including  EGAT  sales  to  the  Lao  grid  and  cross-border \nsales by Thailand\u2019s Provincial Electricity Authority.  \n \n13. \nThailand, valued at the PPA tariff and adjusted by the Lao PDR shadow exchange rate factor. \n \n14. \nThe regional analysis yields an average incremental economic cost of $0.036/kWh. The \neconomic  net  present  value  (NPV)  is  estimated  $269  million  or  $0.013/kWh.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.9%. A summary of cost and benefits for the regional analysis \nare  presented  in  Table  A9.1.  For  the  Lao  PDR,  the  average  incremental  economic  cost  is \n\nFor  the  Lao  PDR  economic  analysis,  benefits  were  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  sales  to \n\n                                                 \n4  Environmental  costs include catchment  area management, resettlement commitments,  monitoring and mitigation, \nand a contingency for unanticipated requirements; NTPC operating costs include administration, insurance, and a \nbudget for other direct costs. \n\n5   The calculated SERF ranged between 1.01\u20131.08 for the Lao PDR and between 1.00\u20131.02 for Thailand. \n\n \n\n\f86 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nestimated at $0.032/kWh. The economic net present value (NPV) is estimated $218 million or \n$0.010/kWh. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.5%. The details of the Lao PDR \nanalysis are in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \nSensitivity analysis was undertaken with respect to key risk factors and assumptions that \ncould  influence  the  viability  of  the  Project.  The  sensitivity  analysis  undertaken  for  the  regional \nanalysis,  shows  that  the  NPV  would  decrease  by  51%  to  $133  million  and  EIRR  to  13.7%  if \ninvestment cost were increased by 20%. A 5-year reduction in the operating life of the project \nwould reduce the EIRR  marginally to 15.6%. A 20% reduction in benefits or a 1-year delay of \nbenefits  would  reduce  the  EIRR  to  13.0%  and  14.2%,  respectively.  Adjustments  in  the \nassumptions of conversion factors and discount rates have only a minor impact on EIRR. None \nof the risk factors would independently undermine the conclusion of the economic viability of the \nProject. However, if the cost increase of 20% is combined with a 20% reduction in benefits, the \nEIRR would fall just below the opportunity cost of capital. If this scenario is combined with a 1-\nyear  delay  of  benefits and  a  5-year  reduction in  operating life,  the  EIRR  would  fall  to  9.1%.  A \nparallel  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  Lao  EIRR  was  also  prepared  and  is  reported  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. Estimated EIRR\u2019s reported for each Lao PDR test were from 0.2 to \n0.4% lower than the regional results, reflecting the lower base case Lao-specific EIRR.   \n \n16. \nA  risk  analysis  was  undertaken  to  examine  a  range  of  possible  EIRR  outcomes  as  a \nresult  of  variations  in  the  values  of  uncertain  factors,  including  capital  costs,  operations  and \nmaintenance costs, sales to EGAT and incremental benefits. The values of the regional EIRR \nrange from a maximum of 16.9% to a minimum of 13.5% with a mean of 15.2%. The Lao PDR \nanalysis produced similar but slightly lower results, paralleling the lower base case for the Lao \nPDR EIRR. \n\n\f \n\nTable A9.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return\u2014Regional  \n \n\nElectricity Consumption \n\nGross Benefits \n\nEconomic Costs \n\n \n\n \n\nNon \n\nIncre- \n\n \n\n \n\nThai \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal  Economic \n\nNet \nGeneration \nGWh \n\nIncremental mental Thai T/L Theun \n\nExport \n\nSales \nGWh \n\nSales  Losses  Hinboun Reduction\nGWh  GWh  GWh \n\nGWh \n\nConsum- \nption \nGWh \n\nNon \nIncremental\n$ mill. \n\n \nBenefits \n$ mill. \n\n0  \n           -

The financial analysis was calculated over the Project\u2019s economic \nuseful life, which includes the Project construction period (May 2005\u2013November 2009) and the \n25-year operating period (November 2009\u2013November 2034). \n \n2. \nThe  financial  projections  of  LHSE  are  expressed  in  current  terms.  The  financial \nevaluations  (financial  internal  rate  of  return  [FIRR]  and  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n[WACC]) of both the Project and the ROI of Government were undertaken in real terms using \nconstant  2005  prices  with  project  cost  estimates,  excluding  financing  costs,  and  financial \nprojections  in  nominal  terms  converted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of \nforeign and domestic inflation. Both the FIRR and WACC were computed after tax.   \n \nB. \n\nLHSE Financial Projections \n\nThe  Government  has  agreed  to  establish  LHSE  to  receive  all  dividends  from  this \n3. \nshareholding so as to ensure a transparent and efficient flow of the Government revenues from \nthe  Project  to  poverty  reduction  initiatives.  Given  that  equity  injections  by  shareholders  are \nlimited to base equity, the cost of this 25% share is estimated at $87.5 million. The Government \nhas decided to finance its required equity injection through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nloan  ($20.0  million),  an  International  Development  Association  (IDA)  grant  ($20.0  million),  a \nEuropean  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  loan  (\u20ac40.0  million),  and  an  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  grant  (\u20ac5.0  million).  LHSE  revenues  will  consist  entirely  of  the  NTPC \ndividends,  which  will  be  paid  in  direct  proportion  to  the  Government  shareholding.    After \ndeduction  of  a  10%  withholding  tax  by  the  Government,  LHSE  will  apply  the  net  dividend \nrevenue  meet  its  own  operating  costs  and  to  cover  debt  service  on  the  ADB  and  EIB  loans. \nAnnual  operating  expenses  are  estimated  at  $100,000  and  include  staff  salaries,  legal \nservices,  financial  advisory  service,  accounting  services,  office  rental,  office  supplies  and \nservices,  and  vehicle  rental.  After  meeting  all  debt  service  and  operating  expenses,  and \nfunding  any  reserve  accounts  required  to  manage  risks,  any  remaining  cash  is  transferred  to \nthe NT2 revenue account under the revenue management arrangements. \n \n4. \nFinancial projections have been prepared for LHSE over the entire operating period of \nthe concession under a Project base case scenario and are summarized in Table A10.1.  This \nbase-case scenario is defined as that the project sponsors and financial advisors deem to be a \nmost  likely  set  of  outcomes  regarding  the  financial  position  and  performance  of  NTPC  and, \ntherefore,  its  dividend  payments  to  LHSE.

These \nrevenues are incorporated in the Government return on investment analysis presented in part \nD of this appendix. However, the LHSE projections have assumed that any amount remaining \non the contingent equity release date from the $30 million payment from NTPC to Government \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n91\n\nas compensation for loss of biodiversity and ecotourism assets would be transferred to LHSE. \nIf no contingent equity is required, this balance of this amount would be paid in 2009 based on \nthe  current  schedule  for  the  project  completion  date  under  the  concession  agreement.  It  is \nassumed  that  a  portion  of  these  funds  would  be  held  by  LHSE  to  ensure  that  it  can  meet  its \ndebt  service  obligations  over  the  first  few  years  of  NTPC  operations.  The  remaining  amount \nwould be paid to Government.  \n \n6. \nEven  though  the  largest  sources  of  the  Government  revenue,  the  royalty  and  income \ntax, are excluded, the financial projections for LHSE indicate that its capacity to meet its debt \nservice  obligations  on  the  ADB  and  EIB  loans  is  well  within  a  range  considered  to  be \nsatisfactory. Under the base-case scenario, total dividends paid to LHSE over the concession, \nafter deduction of the 10% withholding tax, are projected to be almost $640 million, expressed \nin current prices. Total debt service, including both principal and interest, on the proposed ADB \nand  EIB  loans  is  estimated  at  $124  million  while  LHSE  operating  costs  over  the  entire \nconcession  period  are  projected  to  be  less  than  $4  million.  Therefore,  with  total  debt  service \nand  operating  expense  being  equivalent  to  only  20%  of  net  dividend  income,  LHSE  has \nconsiderable  capacity  to  service  this  debt  under  various  scenarios.  This  capacity  to  meet  its \ndebt obligations is measured by the debt service coverage ratio, which averages 5.2 over the \nloan repayment period, well above the 1.2 minimum level  normally considered acceptable. In \n2011,  the  first  year  of  full  debt  service  on  both  the  ADB  and  EIB  loans,  the  projected  debt \nservice  coverage  ratio  (1.11)  may  be  slightly  below  this  threshold  due  to  initially  low  NTPC \ndividends. However, LHSE revenue is still sufficient to service debt. \n \n7. \nConsistent  with  the  large  differential  between  the  dividend  income  it  receives  and  its \ndebt service and operating expenses, LHSE\u2019s return on equity (ROE) is projected to average a \nvery  favorable  38%  over  2011\u20132034.  In  2009/10,  ROE  is  anticipated  to  be  negative  because \nthe  LHSE  share  of  NTPC  dividend  is  projected  to  be  only  about  $0.5  million.  However,  as \nnoted above, LHSE\u2019s financial obligations during this period can be fully met from a portion of \nthe contingent equity release. \n \n8. \nDividend payouts by LHSE to the NT2 Revenue Account will progressively increase in \nline with its own dividend income from NTPC, from $7.1 million in 2011 to $34.1 million in 2022. \nEven  assuming  these  maximum  payout  rates  to  Government,  the  proportion  of  equity  in \nLHSE\u2019s capital structure will increase over the forecast period as the ADB and EIB loans are \nrepaid.

The cost of equity is the rate of return \non a risk-free investment, such as Government bonds, plus a risk premium appropriate for the \nproject.  Therefore, the cost of equity for a higher risk project is greater than that having a lower \nlevel of risk. Estimating both the risk-free rate and risk premium for NTPC is complicated by the \nlack of functioning debt and equity markets in the Lao PDR as well as the cross-border nature \nof the Project. With 94% of the electricity being exported, the cost of equity estimated for the \nProject needs to reflect the lower level of commercial risk associated with business operations \nin Thailand relative to the Lao PDR. On this basis, a weighted average risk-free rate of 7.4% \nhas been estimated which incorporates the different individual rates applicable to the Lao PDR \nand  Thailand.  The  risk  premium  has  been  estimated  on  the  basis  of  an  analysis  of  standard \n\n \n \n85.4  72.0 \n34.0  30.1 \n32.1  27.6 \n\n \n84.2 \n33.9 \n32.0 \n\n(1.5)  (1.5)\n(3.5)  (3.5)\n\n(1.5) \n(3.5) \n\n(1.5)\n(3.5)\n\n(1.5)\n(3.5)\n\n(1.5)\n(3.5)\n\n \n\n\f94 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nrisk indicators for 87 United States power utilities, 13 international power utilities and the two \npublicly listed independent power producers in Thailand.  Adjustments have then been made to \nreflect the additional market, tax and country risks of Lao.  Based on this methodology, the risk \npremium is estimated to be 7.3%. Therefore, the estimated cost of equity is 14.7% in nominal \nterms, which after adjusting for inflation is equivalent to a real cost of equity of 13.6%. \n \n11. \nThe cost of debt is estimated to be 9.5% in nominal after-tax terms, which is equivalent \nto  a  real  after-tax  rate  of  8.8%.  The  cost  of  debt  is  estimated  as  the  internal  rate  of  return \ncalculated  from  projected  cash  inflows  and  outflows  on  all  NTPC  debt.  Cash  inflows  are  the \nprojected  drawdown  on  each  planned  loan  to  NTPC.  Cash  outflows  include  principal \nrepayment, interest expense, and all applicable upfront, commitment and guarantee fees. The \nterms of each loan have been derived from the NTPC borrowing plan, as incorporated into the \nfinancial  model.  This  borrowing  plan  is  based  on  somewhat  conservative  assumptions \nregarding the terms of each loan and, therefore, may slightly overestimate the overall cost of \ndebt. However, even if less conservative assumptions are employed, the cost of debt to NTPC \nwould  remain  relatively  high  for  a  number  of  reasons.  First,  the  non-recourse  financing \nstructure employed for the project increases borrowing costs, not only through higher interest \nrates, but also through the need for loan guarantees. The upfront and commitment fees on the \nvarious  loans  also  increase  overall  borrowing  costs.  Furthermore,  under  NTPC\u2019s  borrowing \nplan, it is envisaged that all dollar and a portion of baht floating rate debt is swapped to a fixed \nrate, which increases the effective interest rate on these loans.  \n\nD. \n\nReturn on Investment to the Government of Lao PDR \n\nThe objective of this analysis is to assess the financial viability of the Project from the \n12. \nperspective of the Government, as a shareholder in NTPC as well as the authority that taxes \nNTPC revenues and profits. Cash outflows and inflows are limited to those directly incurred or \nreceived  by  Government.  Cash  outflows  consist  of  the  equity  injections  made  by  the \nGovernment  into  NTPC.  Cash  inflows  to  the  Government  consist  of  three  components:  (i) \nshareholder dividends paid by NTPC to the Government through LHSE; (ii) the royalty paid by \nNTPC on its operating revenues; and (iii) income tax paid by NTPC on its profits. Income to the \nGovernment that would be generated indirectly as a result the project, such as increased tax \nrevenues  resulting  from  project  induced  economic  growth,  is  not  considered  in  this  financial \nanalysis. \n \n13. \nThe  Government  receives  royalties  for  each  unit  of  energy  sold  by  NTPC  over  the \n2009\u20132034  project  operating  period.  In  addition  to  these  royalties,  the  Government  will  also \nreceive  a  $30  million  payment  from  NTPC  as  compensation  for  loss  of  biodiversity  and \necotourism  assets  and  for  the  project  development  cost.  Some  of  this  payment  may  be \nreserved  to  meet  the  Government\u2019s  contingent  equity  obligations.  This  contingent  obligation \nwould  arise  if  additional  equity  injections  were  required  to  cover  any  cost  overruns  during \nproject construction. After any such obligations were met, the remaining balance would be paid \nto the Government after the contingent equity release date. In the base case scenario, an initial \npayment of $4.2 million is paid in the first six months of construction to cover a small portion of \nbase  equity.  An  additional  $0.8  million  has  already  been  allocated  to  the  Government \nexpenses  during  project  development.    This  leaves  a  remaining  amount  of  $25  million  to  be \npaid to the Government at the commercial operation date (COD) in 2009. These payments are \ntreated as a royalty payment for the purposes of the financial analysis. \n \n14. \nThe Government will apply income tax on profits earned by NTPC after the expiry of the \nincome  tax  holiday  at  the  end  of 2014.  The  rates  of  tax  are  then  increased  in  three  steps  as \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n95\n\ndiscussed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  NTPC\u2019s  projected  income  tax  expense  is  based  on \npre-tax  income  after  depreciation.  According  to  the  concession  agreement,  the  calculation  of \ndepreciation  for  tax  purposes  is  the  same  as  that  for  accounting  purposes;  on  a  straight-line \nbasis  over  the  25-year  operating  period  of  the  concession.  Therefore,  there  is no  opportunity \nfor NTPC to reduce tax payments to the Government by deferring recognition of depreciation to \nthe later part of the concession when tax rates are highest. \n \n15. \nAt the end of the concession in 2034, the project assets will be transferred by NTPC at \nno  cost  to  the  Government.  Given  that  the  economic  life  of  the  assets  should  extend  well \nbeyond  2034,  the  Government  could  then  use  the  facility  to  generate  power  for  consumption \nwithin Lao and/or for sale to Thailand. Therefore, the project should generate net cash flows to \nthe Government beyond the end of the concession. This terminal value could be estimated as \nthe  NPV  of  these  cash flows  over  the  remaining  operating life  of  the  project.  However,  given \nthat the use and value of the power over this post-concession period are uncertain, the terminal \nvalue is very conservatively assumed to be zero. \n \nExpressed in nominal terms, total Government revenues from dividends, royalties and \n16. \nincome tax receipts are projected to be $1.9 billion over the life of the concession, almost 15 \ntimes  greater  than  total  debt  service  on  the  ADB  and  EIB  loans  used  to  finance  the \nGovernment\u2019s  shareholding  in  the  Project.    Therefore,  the  project  will  generate  a  very  large \ncash surplus for the Government, estimated at $1.8 billion, which provides a significant reserve \nmargin  against  any  potentially  adverse  events  during  the  debt  repayment  period.  Projected \nrevenues and debt service in each year over the concession period is shown in Table A10.4. \n \nReflecting the projected large cash surplus accruing to the Government, the FIRR on its \n17. \nequity  investment  in  the  Project  is  calculated  as  21.1%,  which  is  well  above  the  estimated \nWACC  of  6.9%  (Table  A10.5  and  Table  A10.6).  Therefore,  from  the  perspective  of  the \nGovernment  as  defined  above,  the  investment  is  considered  to  be  financially  viable. \nDiscounted at the WACC, the NPV is estimated to be $333.7 million, which also indicates that \nthe  project  will  generate  a  significant  net  return  to  the  Government.  The  WACC  has  been \ncalculated on the basis of the proposed financing plan for the Government equity injection. The \nproposed  IDA  and  AFD  grants,  as  well  as  the  NTPC  contribution,  have  been  valued  at  their \nopportunity  cost,  which  is  assumed  to  be  the  cost  of  the  Government\u2019s  equity  in  NTPC, \nestimated to be 13.6% in real terms. The cost of debt is calculated as 4.9% in nominal terms, \nequivalent to a real rate of 4.1%, which is based on the proposed terms of the ADB and EIB \nloans.  Even  if  a  conservative  discount  rate  is  utilized  (i.e.,  the  Project  WACC  of  10.1%),  the \nNPV of these flows is estimated at $167.4 million. \n\nE. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n18.  An analysis was undertaken to test the sensitivity of FIRR, WACC, and NPV to adverse \nchanges in selected key variables. The variables tested were (i) 6-month and 1-year delays in \nconstruction due to nonperformance of NTPC, which would increase project costs; (ii) 6-month \nand  1-year  delays  in  construction  due  to  nonperformance  of  EGAT,  which  would  have  no \nimpact  on  project  costs;  (iii)  decrease  in  power  demand  so  that  only  primary  energy  is \ndispatched,  which  reduces  NTPC  revenues;  (iv)  changes  in  the  Thai  Baht  and  US  dollar \nexchange  rate;  (v)  a  \u201cworst  case\u201d  hydrological  scenario  which  includes  a  number  of  low \ngeneration (i.e., dry) years early in the project operating period; (vi) a combination of the 1-year \ndelay  due  to  NTPC  nonperformance  and  the  decrease  in  power  demand;  and,  (vii)  a \ncombination of the 1-year delay due to NTPC nonperformance and the low hydrology case. \n \n\n \n\n\f96 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n19.  The  analysis  (Table  A10.7)  indicates  that,  of  the  single  variable  scenarios,  project \nfinancial viability is most sensitive to construction delays caused by nonperformance by NTPC.  \nThis  could  result  in  unforeseen  cost  overruns  and  liquidated  damages  payable  to  EGAT. \nHowever, under all four delay scenarios, the Project remains financially viable. Project viability \nis relatively sensitive to a reduction in power demand, which case can serve as a proxy for a \nreduction in revenue (e.g., should the Project be integrated into a power pool in Thailand and \nmarket prices fall below the contracted tariff schedule).  Even assuming only primary energy is \nsold,  thus  reducing  demand  by  17%  and  revenues  by  9%  compared  to  the  base  case,  the \nProject  remains  viable.  In  fact,  the  Project  can  endure  a  15.2%  annual  average  reduction  in \nrevenue over the operating period and still be viable. Changes in the Thai Baht and US dollar \nexchange rate do not have a significant impact on project viability because currency exposure \nhas been largely hedged by NTPC. \n \n20. \n  For  the  Government,  because  its  base  case  return  on  investment  is  very  high,  its \ninvestment in the Project remains financially viable under all of the scenarios tested.  As was \nthe case for the project FIRR, the Government FIRR is most sensitive to a 1-year delay due to \nnonperformance of NTPC. However, even under this scenario, the FIRR is 17.0%, well above \nthe  6.9%  WACC,  which  indicates  that  the  financial  returns  to  Government  remain  very  high. \nThe  NPV  of  these  returns  over  the  life  of  the  concession  under  this  scenario  is  estimated  at \n$258 million. Given these returns, the capacity of LHSE to service the ADB and EIB loans from \nthe  dividend  income  it  receives  from  NTPC  remains  very  satisfactory  under  all  scenarios \nassessed. The debt service coverage ration (DSCR) is most sensitive to a reduction in power \ndemand.  However,  even  assuming  that  only  PE  is  dispatched,  the  average  DSCR  over  the \nrepayment  period  of  the  loans  is  estimated  at  4.46,  over  three  times  greater  than  that  the \nminimum  level  typically  considered  acceptable.    Therefore,  even  if  NTPC  is  integrated  into  a \npower  pool  and  the  shareholder\u2019s  equity  is  at  risk  due  to  fluctuating  pool  prices,  there  is \nsufficient headroom to ensure Government\u2019s debt service capacity is not affected. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n97 \n\nTable A10.5: Financial Internal Rate of Return on the Equity  \nof the \nGovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic  \n($ million - 2005 constant prices) \n \n\n \n \nYear \n\n \n \nEquity \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nRevenue \n\nNet Present Value (NPV) \n6.9 \n\nWACC (%)\nNPV \n  \n\n4.9 \n517.5  \nOpex \n\n8.9 \n334.5   217.0 \nNet Cash  FIRR\n\n(65.3)  21.1%\n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nIncome Dividends\n\nRoyalty a \n  \n4.2  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n26.5  \n10.8  \n10.7  \n10.8  \n10.9  \n11.0  \n11.1  \n11.1  \n11.2  \n11.2  \n11.3  \n11.3  \n11.3  \n11.4  \n11.4  \n11.5  \n33.2  \n33.3  \n33.5  \n33.6  \n33.7  \n67.7  \n67.9  \n68.2  \n68.5  \n57.2  \n\nInjections \n  \n(69.5) \n(9.8) \n(6.6) \n(2.0) \n(1.0) \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n\n \n  \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n2032 \n2033 \n2034 \n  \n  \nFIRR  =  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  Gov\u2019t.  =  Government  of  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic, LHSE = Lao Holding State Enterprise, NPV = net present value, OPEX = operating \nexpense, WACC = weighted average cost of capital.  \na   Includes  $29.2  million  Government  payment,  of  which  $4.2  million  is  paid  in  2005  and \n\nTotal  Gov\u2019t.

They  are  (i)  cost \noverruns  and  delays  during  construction,  (ii)  failure  to  achieve  guaranteed  output,  (iii)  plant \nenergy shortfall, (iv) nonpayment by Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT); and (v) \nproject completion. \n\nB. \n\nLivelihood Program for Plateau Fail to Achieve Targets  \n\n3. \nThere  are  risks  associated  with  the  livelihood  programs  proposed  for  ethnic  minority \ncommunities  to  be  resettled  on  the  Nakai  Plateau.  These  include  unproven  assumptions \nregarding  income  streams  from  activities  such  as  reservoir  fisheries,  agricultural,  timber \nproduction,  and  access  to  market  for  fish,  vegetables,  and  agricultural  and  timber  products. \nBecause  of  limited  exposure  of  the  resettlers  to  the  planned  livelihood  programs,  the  pace  at \nwhich  these  communities  can  make  the  transition  from  traditional  subsistence  to  more \ncommercial operations may be overstated. There may be significant social preferences that are \npoorly  understood,  such  as  the  importance  of  buffalo  in  the  local  social  context.  Furthermore, \ndisputes  between  the  Government  and  Nam  theun  2  Power  Company  Limited  (NTPC)  over \nresponsibilities for livelihood target outcomes, the Government capacity to implement programs, \nand the resettlers attitude that NTPC would do every thing for them, could undermine livelihood \nprograms.  The  health  and  safety  problems  associated  with  the  influx  of  a  large  numbers  of \noutsiders\u2019 present risks.  \n\nThe  above  risks  are  addressed  in  several  ways.  First,  livelihoods  options  include  a \n4. \ndiverse  range  of  activities  with  a  flexible  mix.  Appropriate  transitional  support  will  be  provided \nduring early years of the livelihood program to ensure that no households are made worse off as \na  result  of  resettlement.  Contingency  resources  are  allocated  to  support  households  to  adopt \nnew  approaches  and  to  ensure  achieving  livelihood  targets  by  making  adjustments  in  the \nlivelihood programs, addressing cost overruns or unanticipated impacts. Second, the livelihood \nprograms  are  designed  with  participatory  input  from  the  resettlers\u2019  community  as  well  as  the \nindividual  preferences.  This  consultative  process  will  continue  during  the  life  of  the  project \nimplementation.  Third,  the  social  development  plan  and  the  concession  agreement  outline  in \ndetail  the  implementation  responsibilities  and  accountability  for  the  livelihood  results  between \nthe  Government  and  NTPC.  Fourth,  there  will  be  high  levels  of  public  accountability  and \ntransparency backed by comprehensive monitoring programs including those by the developer, \nindependent  bodies  such  as  the  panel  of  experts,  and  possibly  nongovernment  organizations. \nFifth,  after  achieving  the  livelihood  targets,  NTPC  will  develop  a  phased  exit  strategy  to \nminimize resettlers\u2019 dependency on the project company. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2005.

Manila (RRP 37910, March 2005). \n\n \n\n\f100 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nC. \n\nIneffective Conservation Management of National Protected Area under Social and \nEnvironment Management Framework and Operational Plan \n\n5. \nThe  social  and  environment  management  framework  and  operational  plan  (SEMFOP) \nwatershed  conservation  program  may  face  two  main  risks.  The  first  is  the  possible  lack  of \neffective  coordination  for  the  implementation  of  various  elements  of  the  conservation  and \nmanagement  work  plan.  This  may  result  in  the  failure  of  patrolling  and  law  enforcement \nstrategies, which are designed to stem the problem of poaching. The community forest and land \nuse planning for the Nakai Nam Theun National Protected Area (NNT-NPA) may not establish \neffective  systems  of  local  land-use  management.  Incentives  from  community  livelihood \nprograms may be insufficient to reduce unsustainable resource use over time. These risks could \nstem from poor project design, flawed implementation, inappropriate assumptions about levels \nof  threat,  or  even  lack  of  community  collaboration.  The  second  category  of  risk  is  associated \nwith  failure  at  various  levels  of  Government  to  respect  agreements  on  the  \u201cshared  vision\u201d \nregarding limits to development or resource exploitation and extraction within the NNT-NPA. For \nexample, the Government could endorse undesirable land uses such as logging or mining in the \nNNT-NPA or promote accelerated access through construction of roads in the NNT-NPA. \n\n6. \nThe  operational  risks  outlined  above  which  are  associated  with  the  conservation \nmanagement  of  the  NNT-NPA  are  addressed  under  the  SEMFOP  through  a  number  of \nmechanisms. First, the SEMFOP program is assured a secured financing of $1 million per year \nover 30 years. This is an unprecedented level of financial commitment to conservation issues in \nSoutheast  Asia,  if  not  globally.  These  resources  will  be  managed  by  the  Watershed \nManagement and Protection Authority (WMPA), whose management authority is separate from \nconventional  Government  departments,  thus  reducing  risks  of  insufficient  resource  flows  to \nmeet  operational  needs.  There  will  be  built-in  mechanisms  of  flexibility  in  allocating  budget \nresources  based  on  actual  field  requirements  during  the  implementation  phase.  Second,  the \nSEMFOP  builds  in  high  levels  of  public  participation,  transparency,  and  accountability.  The \ncommunity forest and local land-use planning process is designed to ensure that no programs \ncan proceed without strong local endorsement. Land tenure instruments assuring local land-use \nrights  will  be  essential  security  for  enclave  villages.  In  addition,  budgets  and  annual  work \nprograms together with various progress reports will be made publicly available to all concerned \ngroups. Third, the SEMFOP incorporates many elements of good practice and lessons learned \nfrom  operational  experience  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  elsewhere.  Fourth,  the  SEMFOP  brings  a \nstrong monitoring component to determine levels of land-use activity and to independently track \nactivities on the ground. Fifth, WMPA will partner with operational nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs)  to  design  and  deliver  part  of  its  work  program,  especially  those  aspects  relating  to \ncapacity  building,  patrolling,  monitoring,  and  delivery  of  social  services  in  enclave  and  buffer \nzone villages.  \n\nD. \n\nFisheries Compensation Programs in the Xe Bang Fai Fail to Achieve Outcomes  \n\n7. \nThe  project  design  recognizes  the  potential  fish  loss  in  the  Xe  Bang  Fai  and  its \ntributaries and includes provision for compensation through a comprehensive, multidimensional \nprogram of fish production integrated with current farming practices. However, there exists the \nrisk  that  these  programs  may  fail  to  meet  intended  compensatory  protein  and  income  targets. \nThese  risks  stem  from  a  number  of  design  and  implementation  issues  including  the \nassumptions about the levels of community adaptation to new technologies; inability to achieve \nfish  production  and  yield  levels  due  to  poor  technical  implementation;  overestimation  of  land \navailable for fish production; underestimation of the time period required for the Xe Bang Fai to \nrecover  from  extended  periods  of  poor  water  quality  in  the  river;  appropriateness  of  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n101 \n\ninstitutional  arrangements  to  deliver  the  livelihood  restoration  programs  to  people;  and \nadequacy of funding to soften any impacts caused by shortfalls in the mitigation programs. \n\n8. \nRisks of downstream impacts will be addressed through a careful participatory planning \nprocess to design a compensation framework that is comprehensive, equitable, achievable, and \nappropriately resourced. An important principle of a downstream program is that it is proactive\u2014\nnot  waiting  to  see  what  happens  before  taking  action  but  rather  investing  in  compensation \nmeasures  3\u20135  years  in  advance  of  the  changes  in  water  flow  regimes.  The  compensation \nframework will be implemented by adopting existing and familiar models already in place in the \nLao  PDR  under  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-  and  the  World  Bank-assisted  projects, \nwhich  will  enable  more  rapid  adoption  by  the  project-affected  communities.  However,  the \nproposed  compensation  program  will  make  adjustments  to  reflect  the  actual  situation  a  few \nyears  after  commercial  operations  start.  The  monitoring  of  the  mitigation  and  compensation \nprograms  will  play  an  important  role  in  evaluating  the  achievement  of  outcomes,  and  if  found \nunsatisfactory,  will  trigger  the  formulation  of  additional  measures  and  the  needed  resources. \nClosely tied to monitoring is the utilization of contingency funds. The shortfalls, below what can \nbe delivered by the program, especially in the first 3 years after commercial operation date, will \nbe funded from the regular operating budget of the Project. \n\nE. \n\nDelays in Implementation of the Government Revenue Management Arrangements \n\nthe  proposed \n\nimplementation  of \n\nRisks  associated  with \n\nrevenue  management \n9. \narrangements relate to the following actions that will have to be implemented: (i) improvements \nin the chart of accounts and budget classifications to reflect priority programs, (ii) development \nand monitoring of program performance indicators, and (iii) initiation of program level reporting. \nFailure  to  make  progress  in  these  areas  will  undermine  effective  targeting  and  reporting  once \nNam  Theun  2  (NT2)  revenues  come  on  stream.  These  risks  are  mitigated  by  ensuring  that \nthese priority revenue management actions are included in the public expenditure management \nstrengthening program, linking program implementation to poverty reduction support credit prior \nactions as well as broader program-level recourse mechanisms.  \n\nProgram-Level  Failure  to  Comply  with  the  Government  Revenue  Management \n\nF. \nArrangements \n\n10. \nThe revenue management arrangements will entail an annual report on compliance with \nallocation,  additionality,2  and  reporting  requirements  for  eligible  programs.  In  cases  of \nnoncompliance,  the  responsible  body  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  inform  the  line  institutions \nresponsible  for  eligible  programs  of  corrective  measures  that  need  to  be  taken.  In  cases  of \npersistent  noncompliance,  the  oversight  body  of  the  ministry  may  withhold,  or  recommend \nwithholding, all or part of NT2 revenue allocations to specific programs which fail to meet criteria \nand  transparency  standards.  When  corrective  measures  have  been  taken  by  the  concerned \ninstitutions, the oversight body of the ministry will recommend the release of funds from the NT2 \nrevenue account. \n\nG. \n\nGovernment Capacity and Governance Constraints.  \n\n11. \nThere  are  concerns  among  the  international  financial  institutions,  civil  society,  NGOs, \nand  other  stakeholders  over  the  lack  of  government  experience,  the  institutional  and \nmanagement capacity, and its will to implement key project-related programs and commitments, \nparticularly  the  watershed,  revenue  management,  environmental,  and  social  mitigation  and \n\n                                                 \n2   Additionality means in addition to the base year budget allocation. \n\n \n\n\f102 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\ncompensation measures. These are recognized as important and significant risks to long-term \nproject  success\u2014moderate  on  technical  issues,  substantial  on  safeguards  issues,  high  on \nissues relying on the Government\u2019s willingness and capacity to act, such as conservation of the \nproject  watershed,  and  high  on  implementation  of  public  expenditure  management  and  NT2 \nrevenue  management  arrangements.  However,  the  overall  assessment  is  that  these  risks  are \nmanageable with substantial and careful oversight. Keeping these concerns in mind the Project \nhas  been  designed  with  a  number  of  mechanisms  to  minimize  these  risks,  including  (i) \nmultidonor technical assistance and funding to help the Government improve its  overall public \nexpenditure management program; (ii) oversight through audits and public expenditure tracking \nsurveys to monitor the utilization and effectiveness of the Government revenue from the Project \nfor agreed priority programs, as well as international expert panels of dam safety review panel, \ninternational advisory group, and panel of experts, to monitor dam safety, project effectiveness, \nand  the  achievement  of  income  targets  and  other  objectives  of  key  social  and  environmental \nprograms and commitments of the sponsors and the Government; (iii) long-term funding, as well \nas  technical  assistance,  for  conservation  programs  from  project  revenues  and  project-related \ninvestment  in  the  form  of  Government  equity  from  ADB,  World  Bank,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement,  and  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  providing  concerned  Government \nagencies  adequate  operational  funds  to  implement  conservation  and  watershed  management \nprograms for at least 30 years; (iv) commitments from NTPC to share jointly management and \nfinancial  responsibility \nthe  outcomes  of  environmental  and  social  mitigation  and \ncompensation programs, including resettlement on the plateau and in the downstream areas; (v) \ndelineation  of  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and  authorities  of  the  central,  provincial,  and  district \ngovernment agencies of the Government with regard to project-related activities and programs \nto the greatest extent possible so that confusion over mandate and accountability is minimized; \nand (vi) a program of transparent monitoring and evaluation of project performance including the \npublication  of  project  performance  evaluations,  progress  reports,  and  monitoring  data,  as  well \nas annual public consultative meetings, to provide a high level of public scrutiny, transparency \nand accountability\u2014unmatched in Lao PDR\u2014to ensure that key project issues remain high on \nthe Government\u2019s agenda. \n\nfor \n\nH.   \n\nSustainability \n\nOver the past few years, the Government has shown its commitment to the Project and \n12. \ndemonstrated  its  ability  to  move  resolutely  and  quickly  to  resolve  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards issues that could threaten to delay or imperil a decision by the donors to support the \nProject.  For  example,  in  2001  the  Government  effectively  halted  illegal  logging  on  the  Nakai \nPlateau and in the NNT-NPA; it has successfully controlled illegal logging since then. In 2004, \nthe Government agreed to terminate a gold mining concession in the Ban Na Kadok area, which \nthreatened the NNT-NPA. To its credit, the Government has been responsive in establishing a \nnew regulatory framework for WMPA and for forestry and natural resource management. It has \ncollaborated effectively with NTPC and external consultants to carry out local consultations that \nwere  remarkably  open  and  balanced.  According  to  independent  observers,  the  Government \nhelped  create  an  environment  where  candid  feedback  was  received  from  project-affected \ncommunities. It also participated effectively and candidly in the international workshops. While \nthese  actions  are  not  guarantees  of  future  commitment  or  performance,  they  confirm  that  the \nGovernment has the capacity to act swiftly and effectively on the Project as and when required. \n\n13. \nOutside  of  the  immediate  project  area,  the  Government's  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards  record  has  not  been  as  promising.  While  the  Lao  PDR  laws  provide  for  the \nconservation of protected areas, wildlife, and forests; prohibits the export of trees; and protects \nthe rights and independence of Indigenous peoples, in practice, enforcement of these laws and \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n103 \n\ndecrees is weak. The Government has been slow to implement some of the existing ADB and \nthe World Bank supported projects in a satisfactory manner. While it has clearly shown that it is \nable  to  stop  illegal  logging  on  the  Nakai  Plateau,  such  activities  continue  in  other  parts  of  the \ncountry.  To  some  extent  the  existing  situation  can  be  attributed  to  the  lack  of  credible \nenforcement  capacity  and  to  serious  revenue  shortfalls  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels. \nThese issues are addressed in the Project and will be continued in future projects of ADB and \nthe World Bank. \n\n14. \nThere  is  concern  about  the  Government\u2019s  likely  actions  once  the  Project  has  been \nthe \napproved.  The  Government\u2019s  mixed  past  record,  differing  perspectives  between \nGovernment and provincial and district administrations, and uncertainty about the Government\u2019s \ncommitments  on  issues  essential  to  the  Project\u2019s  success  over  the  long  term\u2014for  example, \nconservation of the NNT-NPA, and the targeting of the Government revenue from the Project to \npriority  poverty  reduction  and  conservation  programs\u2014pose  substantial  risks  to  long-term \nproject  success.  Once  funds  have  been  disbursed  there  will  be  little  legal  leverage  for  the \nlenders. The joint approach of ADB, the World Bank, AFD, and EIB is to use the Project as a \nvehicle to maintain a proactive dialogue with the Government on the broad reform agenda and \nproject-specific issues and to enmesh that dialogue in an enduring dialogue on the Project with \ninternational and local civil society. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix A \n\nPUBLIC EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT STRENGTHENING PROGRAM (PEMSP) \nAND REVENUE MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS \n\n1. \nRevenue  and  expenditure  management  is  central  to  the  achievement  of  the  NT2 \nProject objective: \u201cto generate revenues through investment in hydropower resources that \nare used to finance spending on priority poverty reduction and environmental programs\u201d. \nThis  annex  provides  an  overview  of  the  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements that seek to support the achievement of this project objective.  \n\nin \n\nThe  approach  adopted \n\n2. \nthe  design  of  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure \nmanagement  arrangements  focuses  on  strengthening  of  national  public  expenditure \nmanagement systems, by channeling NT2 revenues through these systems from the start, \nwhen Government performance will be under intense international scrutiny.  This serves a \nbroader  development  purpose,  since  an  effective,  transparent  expenditure  management \nsystem  is  essential  if  Lao  PDR  is  to  use  its  limited  resources  in  support  of  its  poverty \nreduction and development objectives.  Section A outlines the current status of the public \nexpenditure management system, resource allocation issues and the potential impacts of \nNT2  revenues.  Section  B  outlines  the  Government\u2019s  proposed  public  expenditure \nmanagement  reforms  and  external  partners\u2019  support  to  the  reform  and  capacity  building \nagenda.  Section  C  outlines  specific  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements which provide a framework for the application of NT2 revenues in line with \nthe  project\u2019s  allocational  and \ntime  of  project \ncommissioning. Details of the NT2 revenue and expenditure management arrangements \nare laid out in the Technical Annex attached to the Government\u2019s Letter of Implementation \nPolicy.  Section D concludes with a review of the benefits and risks, risk mitigation and the \nalternative approaches to revenue and expenditure management considered.  \n\ntransparency  objectives \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\nA. \n\nPublic Expenditure Management Context and NT2 Impacts \n\nto  strengthening  public  expenditure  systems  and \n\nStatus  of  public  expenditure  management  systems.  The  Government  of  Lao \n3. \nPDR \nimproving \nis  committed \ntransparency.  While  there  have  been  improvements  in  recent  years,  there  are  major \nchallenges  ahead,  particularly  as  regards  strengthening  the  control  environment  and \ntimeliness  and  quality  of  published  financial  information.  The  Government  has  resumed \npublication of the state budget, providing details of expenditures at central and provincial \nlevels,  together  with  budget  outturn  data  for  the  previous  year.  The  Government  has \nrevised its chart of accounts for the FY2005 budget cycle. Work has started on the design \nof  medium-term  expenditure  programs  for  the  NGPES  sectors.  These  will  be  integrated \ninto the expenditure plan supporting the forthcoming Five Year Economic and Social Plan \nfor  2006-10.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  approved  a  new  procurement  decree  and \ninternal regulations, standard bidding documents and a procurement manual are currently \nunder  review,    providing  a  framework  for  a  more  transparent  and  efficient  procurement \nsystem.    Progress  has  also  been  made  in  computerization  of  payments  processing  and \naccounting  for  four  central  agencies.  The  computerized  system  is  now  being  rolled  out \nacross  central  and  provincial  government.  Nevertheless,  the  expenditure  management \nsystem  has  yet  to  reach  heavily  indebted  poor  country  (HIPC)  public  expenditure \nmanagement  benchmarks,  which  place  considerable  emphasis  on  public  disclosure  of \nfinancial  information.    Despite  recent  revisions  to  the  budget  classifications  and  chart  of \naccounts,  it  is  still  difficult  to  link  resources  to  specific  functions  and  programs.    These \nproblems are compounded by the decentralization of responsibility for budget preparation, \nwhich  allows  for  differing  interpretations  of  policy  priorities.  As  a  result,  there  are \nsignificant  per  capita  variations  in  resource  allocations  to  priority  sectors  between \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix A \n\n \n\n 2\n\nprovinces.  Reporting by agencies and particularly provinces is incomplete and difficult to \nreconcile. Effective treasury operations and cash management are hampered by multiple \naccounts, lack of systematic commitment controls and weak cash planning mechanisms. \nThis  has  contributed  to  arrears  to  suppliers  and  delays  in  the  payment  of  salaries. \nRevenue  retention  at  provincial  level  exacerbates  the  central  administration\u2019s  cash \nconstraints and results in delays in transfers to the poorest provinces. Although the budget \nbooks include budget outturn data, the administration does not publish consolidated end-\nof-year  financial  statements  or  in-year  budget  execution  reports.  The  recently  created \nState  Audit  Organization1  (SAO)  has  limited  resources  in  relation  to  its  broad  mandate. \nThe SAO undertakes limited compliance audits of a few line agencies. Audit reports are \nnot published.  \n\nResource Allocation.  Since FY2001, with the successful conclusion of the fiscal \n4. \nstabalization program launched in late 1999, the Government has made some progress in \nshifting  in  the  structure  of  spending  towards  the  sectoral  priorities  laid  out  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  development  and  poverty  reduction  strategies.    However,  the  scope  for \nreallocation  of  resources  has  been  constrained  by  slow  recovery  of  revenues  and, \nconsequently,  modest  growth  in  the  budget  base.  Consequently,  although  the  share  of \ntotal spending allocated to the social sectors increased from 13 percent of total spending \nin FY2001 to 18 percent in the FY2004 budget, expenditures in real per capita terms still \nfall short of the levels seen in the mid-1990s and allocations to education and health have \nremained at around 14 percent of domestically financed expenditures (see Table 1). In the \neconomic sectors, allocations to agriculture fell sharply from FY2001 and FY2004 as the \nGovernment cut back on the large irrigation schemes. Road construction has continued to \nabsorb  around  one  quarter  of  total  spending,  with  allocations  of  domestically  financed \nexpenditures increasing steadily from FY2001 to FY2004. About one half of domestically \nfinanced  expenditures  are  allocated  to  public  administration,  security  and  the  justice \nsector,  with  the  share  of  these  sectors  rising  slightly  in  recent  years,  partly  driven  by \nincreases  in  personnel  costs.  Across  all  sectors,  there  has  been  a  marked  shift  from \ncapital  to  recurrent  spending,  with  recurrent  spending  increasing  from  just  53  percent  of \ndomestically  financed  expenditures  in  FY2001  to  65  percent  in  the  FY2004  budget. \nHowever,  operating  and  maintenance  expenditures  are  still  under-funded  across  all \nsectors,  especially  in  the  education  and  health  sectors  projects,  and  cost-recovery \nschemes finance key inputs.  Civil service pay fell in real terms in the late 1990s and has \nyet to recover.  In the absence of reductions in staffing, Government-wide pay reform is \nlikely to result in a further shift in resources towards public administration. Ultimately, the \npace  at  which  the  Government  can  increase  spending  on  National  Growth  and  Poverty \nEradication  Strategy  (NGPES)  sectors,  recurrent  expenditures  and  pay  reform  will  be \ndetermined  by  improvements  in  revenue  performance.  In  this  context,  NT2  plays  an \nimportant  role  as  one  of  a  number  of  policy  and  administrative  measures  intended  to \nmobilize the domestic resources needed to finance its poverty reduction and development \nstrategy.  \n\n                                                 \n1 Formerly called National Audit Office.   \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix A \n\n \n\n 3\n\nTable 1: Lao PDR Percent Structure of Expenditure \n(excluding debt service) \n\n \n\nTotal Expenditure \n\nExcluding External Capital \n\nSector \n\n  Actual \n2000/01 \n\nActual \n2001/02 \n\nActual \n2002/03 \n\nBudget \n2003/04 \n\n  Actual \n2000/01 \n\nActual \n2001/02 \n\nActual \n2002/03 \n\nBudget \n2003/04 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n32 \n\n50 \n\n19 \n\n26 \n\n9 \n\n4 \n\n0 \n\n68 \n\n32 \n\nPublic Administration \n\nEconomic Sectors, of which \n\n     Agriculture \n\n     Transport and Communications \n\n     Education \n\n     Health  \n\nOther / Reserve \n\nCapital \n\nRecurrent \n\nSource: Ministry of Finance, Budget Books. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n47 \n\n34 \n\n23 \n\n8 \n\n10 \n\n4 \n\n0 \n\n47 \n\n53 \n\n47 \n\n31 \n\n15 \n\n12 \n\n22 \n\n12 \n\n4 \n\n0 \n\n47 \n\n53 \n\n49 \n\n31 \n\n14 \n\n13 \n\n17 \n\n10 \n\n3 \n\n2 \n\n42 \n\n58 \n\n54 \n\n25 \n\n6 \n\n16 \n\n19 \n\n11 \n\n3 \n\n2 \n\n34 \n\n66 \n\n40 \n\n35 \n\n13 \n\n19 \n\n25 \n\n13 \n\n6 \n\n0 \n\n63 \n\n37 \n\n34 \n\n41 \n\n13 \n\n25 \n\n24 \n\n11 \n\n6 \n\n1 \n\n64 \n\n36 \n\n29 \n\n38 \n\n9 \n\n26 \n\n24 \n\n12 \n\n6 \n\n9 \n\n69 \n\n31 \n\nSocial Sectors, of which \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n18 \n\n5. \n Revenue impact. Revenues from the NT2 project are expected to be available to \nGovernment  from  FY2010,  including:  GOL  contributions  under  Article  19.1  of  the \nConcession  Agreement,  water  resource  user  charges,  NTPC  dividends  and  taxes. \nEstimated NT2 revenues to GOL rise gradually in the early years, while commercial debt \nservice is paid, from an average of US$28 million in the first five years to an average of \nUS$33 million from 2015 to 2019, rising sharply thereafter to an average of US$73 million \nfrom 2020 to 2024 (see Figure 1 and 2)2.  On the basis of economic and revenue growth \nprojections used for the recent debt sustainability analysis, NT2 revenues will account for \nbetween  3  to  5  percent  of  total  revenues  in  the  period  to  FY2020.3  While  NT2\u2019s \ncontribution to total revenues is likely to be fairly modest, the project\u2019s revenue impact is \nsignificant when compared with other revenue sources. NT2 revenues in 2011, adjusted \nto FY2003 prices, are equivalent to around 50 percent of turnover tax collections and 80 \npercent of profit tax collections in FY2003.  \n\n                                                 \n2  Estimates of nominal NT2 revenues are based on the lenders\u2019 financial model dated February 2005, \n\nadjusted to coincide with Lao PDR financial years.  NT2 revenues available for allocation through NT2 \nrevenue and expenditure management arrangements will be slightly lower, owing to the deduction of EIB \nand ADB debt service related to acquisition of equity in NTPC and the project related costs of the Lao \nHolding State Enterprise (LHSE), the Government\u2019s equity holder.    \n\n3  IMF, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix, Country Report 05/09, \n\nJanuary 2005. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix A \n\n \n\n 4\n\nFigure 1: NT2 Revenues by Component\n(Nominal US$ Mn)\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\n2024\n\n2026\n\n2028\n\n2030\n\n2032\n\n2034\n\nWater Resource User Charge\n\nT axes GoL Contribution & NT PC Dividends\n\nFigure 2: Total and Net NT2 Revenue Stream\n(Nominal US$ Mn)\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\n2024\n\n2026\n\n2028\n\n2030\n\n2032\n\n2034\n\nNet NT 2 Revenues \n\nT otal NT 2 Revenues\n\nExpenditure  impact.

The  Government\u2019s \npublic  expenditure  management  reform  strategy  to  end  FY2009  is  laid  out  in  its  Public \nExpenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP), approved by the Minister of \nFinance.  The  program  builds  on  an  extensive  body  of  analytical  work,  including  a  joint \nIMF, ADB and World Bank Public Expenditure Review of 20024. The PEMSP also draws \non  the  Government\u2019s  governance  strategy5  and  the  expenditure  management  reform \nstrategy laid out in the NGPES6.  The program lays out the broad objectives for reforms, \nidentifies  the  intended  outcomes  and  indicators  to  monitor  improvements  in  system \nperformance,  and  lays  out  an  implementation  schedule.

PEMSP will provide a framework for mobilizing and \n10. \ncoordinating  external  assistance  in  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  public  expenditure \nmanagement  reforms.  The  World  Bank  will  support  program  implementation  through  a \nsequence  of  PRSCs,  from  2005  through  2007,  with  PRSC  prior  actions  linked  to \nimplementation  of  key  reforms  scheduled  under  the  PEMSP.  Initially,  core  financing  for \ntechnical  assistance  and  the  capacity  building  activities  foreseen  under  the  program  will \nbe provided through the World Bank\u2019s on-going Financial Management Capacity Building \nCredit  (FMCBC).  The  Government  has  approved  the  recruitment  of  two  long-term \nadvisors  to  assist  the  Ministry  coordinate  PEMSP  implementation:  one  advisor  covering \ntechnical aspects of the program, the other supporting capacity building activities. These \nadvisors  will  assist \nimplement,  coordinate  and  oversee  short-term \nconsultancies  under  the  program.  Following  a  programmatic  approach,  the  PEMSP  will \nintegrate  assistance  provided  by  on-going  and  programmed  assistance  including  World \nBank Institutional Development Fund small-grants (supporting procurement reform), ADB \ntechnical assistance grants (accounting regulations and computerization in agencies and \nprovinces)  and  pipeline  projects  financed  by  AFD  (vocational  training  in  accounting), \nUNDP (fiscal decentralization policy) and JICA (fiscal planning). The World Bank and ADB \nwill assist the Ministry of Finance to mobilize grants from bilateral partners to cover core \nprogram financing requirements.  \n\nthe  Ministry \n\nNext  steps  in  PEMSP  implementation.    The  Ministry  of  Finance  intends  to \n11. \nintegrate  PEMSP  activities  for  FY2005  into  departmental  workplans  during  the  mid-year \nrevision.  In  the  meantime,  a  number  of  PEMSP  activities  are  already  underway.  The \nMinistry  of  Finance  is  currently  undertaking  a  review  of  Treasury  functions  with  the \nassistance  of  a  Treasury  Advisor  financed  under  the  FMCBC.  Work  on  updating  the \nmedium-term expenditure framework is underway, starting with expenditure programs for \nthe  key  NGPES  sectors.  The  Ministry  is  also  undertaking  a  training  needs  assessment \nand  preparing  capacity  building  plan  to  support  PEMSP  implementation,  with  the \nassistance of the European Union.  On the basis of this capacity building plan, the Ministry \nintends  to  finalize  a  detailed  schedule  of  training  activities  and  short-term  technical \nassistance inputs, together with PEMSP financing requirements for the period to FY2009, \nby end of September 2005.   \n\n12. \nState  Audit  Organization.    In  parallel  with  the  PEMSP,  the  SAO  has  recently \napproved  a  strategic  plan  for  FY2005  to  FY2009.  The  strategic  plan  anticipates:  \npreparation of draft audit legislation in 2005, providing for institutional independence and \nclarification  of  the  institution\u2019s  authority  and  reporting  requirements;  financial  audits  of \nState  Owned  Enterprises  including  banks  and  of  loan  projects  in  accordance  with \ninternational  standards  by  2006;  and  audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of \ngovernment  by  2009.    The  strategic  plan  includes  a  five  year  audit  plan  and  a  human \nresource development plan, which calls for extensive training of the SAO staff and modest \nincreases in staffing levels. ADB assistance to the SAO, which supported preparation of \nthe  strategic  plan  and  audit  manuals,  is  scheduled  to  terminate  in  late  2005.  Further \nassistance  will  be  needed  to  support  implementation  of  the  SAO\u2019s  strategic  plan.    This \nassistance will be provided, in part, through an audit peer review by an INTOSAI8 partner \ninstitution which will provide guidance on progress towards international standards.  Peer \nreviews  are  scheduled  for  FY2006  and  FY2009  and  funded  under  NT2  monitoring \narrangements.  \n\n                                                 \n8 The International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) is the professional organization of \n185 Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) in counties that belong to the United Nations or its specialized \nagencies. \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix A \n\n \n\n 8\n\nSector  interventions.  Alongside  support  to  core  institutions  (the  Ministry  of \n13. \nFinance  and  State  Audit  Organization),  the  World  Bank  supports  the  development  of \nfinancial  management  systems  and  capacity  building  through  its  portfolio  of  sector \nprojects.    Recently  approved  and  pipeline  projects  in  the  education,  health  and  roads \nsectors  together  with  the  Poverty  Reduction  Fund,  include  components  geared  to  the \ndevelopment of agency financial management systems, particularly systems designed to \nchannel  resources  close  to  the  field  level,  as  well  as  the  formulation  of  sector  level \nexpenditure policies9.  These projects are designed to meet the expenditure management \nneeds  at  sector  level.  The  challenge  in  coming  years  will  be  to  coordinate  the  various \ninitiatives  across  government,  so  that  the  core  systems  reforms,  under  PEMSP,  support \nthe  initiatives  taken  by  line  agencies.  At  the  same  time,  it  will  be  important  to  ensure \nconsistency in approach, particularly as regards reporting and accounting standards and \ncompatibility of information systems.  The recent establishment of sector working groups \nprovides  a  framework  for  development  of  a  consistent  approach  among  development \npartners  in  the  diverse  NGPES  sectors.  Within  Government,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  is \nexpected  to  assume  a  stronger  role  in  guiding  and  supporting  financial  management \nreforms at sector level.  \n\nC. \n\nSpecific arrangements for managing NT2 revenues and expenditures  \n\n14. \nObjective. The NT2 revenue and expenditure management arrangements seek to \nensure that NT2 revenues are applied transparently and efficiently in financing of poverty \nreduction  and  environmental  conservation  programs  reflecting  the  Government  of  Lao \nPDR\u2019s policy priorities as laid out in the National Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy \nand its successors. These arrangements have been designed within the framework of the \nBudget Law, which requires a unitary and unified state budget, and have been guided by \nthe  principles  of  sound  public  expenditure  management.  They  have  also  taken  into \naccount the need for allocational flexibility, given that development policies and needs are \nlikely  to  change  before  and  after  NT2  commissioning,  in  FY2010,  when  revenues  first \ncome on stream. The arrangements build on and accelerate system-wide reforms under \nthe  PEMSP  by  focusing  attention  on  a  few  high  priority  programs  benefiting  from  NT2 \nrevenues.  These  programs  will  be  required  to meet  financial  management  and  reporting \nstandards  and  to  put  in  place  adequate  monitoring  systems,  including  mechanisms  for \nperformance  evaluation  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  close  to  the  field  level.  In  this \nway, the implementation of NT2 revenue and expenditure management arrangements is \nexpected  to  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  core  systems  used  to  manage  all  public \nresources, leading to improvements in transparency and the policy alignment of spending.  \nThe  continuing  need \nrevenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements  will  be  reviewed  before  project  commissioning  and  periodically  thereafter, \ntaking  into  account  progress  in  strengthening  of  the  Government\u2019s  public  expenditure \nmanagement systems.   \n\nfor  specific  NT2 \n\n15. \nCapture  of  NT2  revenues.  There  are  two  sources  of  NT2  revenues.  The  first \nsource  of  NT2  revenues  are  revenues  paid  by  NTPC,  as  provided  for  under  the \nConcession  Agreement,  including  water  resource  usage  charges  and  taxes.  Until \ncommercial debt is fully repaid, these revenues will be paid from a project escrow account \nto  the  Ministry  of  Finance\u2019s  \u201cNT2  Revenue  Account\u201d:  thereafter,  these  revenues  will  be \npaid to the \u201cNT2 Revenue Account\u201d by NTPC (see Figure 4). The second source of NT2 \nrevenues  are  revenues  paid  by  the  Lao  Holding  State  Enterprise  (LHSE)  related  to  its \n\n                                                 \n9 World Bank, Second Education Development Project, Approved 2004, P078113; Second Road Maintenance \nProject, Approved 2004, P083543; Poverty Reduction Fund, Approved 2002, P077326; and  Health Services \nImprovement Project, in preparation.  \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix A \n\n \n\n 9\n\nequity  holding  in  NTPC.    Dividends  from  NTPC  payable  to  LHSE  will  be  channeled \nthrough  an  escrow  account.  Part  of  these  funds  transferred  to  the  LHSE  to  cover \noperating  expenses,  on  the  basis  of  a  budget  approved  annually  by  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  as  shareholder,  and  the  company\u2019s  cumulative  fund  required  by  law.    The \nremainder  of  the  funds  derived  from  NTPC  dividends  will  be  transferred  to  the  \u201cNT2 \nRevenue  Account\u201d,  comprising  the  repayment  and  service  of  funds  on-lent  by  the \nGovernment  of  Lao  PDR  for  the  purchase  of  equity  in  NTPC,  taxes  and  dividends,  and \nany  payments  under  Article  19.1  of  the  Concession  Agreement.  Both  NTPC  and  LHSE \nare required to prepare annual financial statements clearly indicating all payments of NT2 \nrevenues. These financial statements will be subject to independent audits.  In this way, it \nwill  be  possible  to  verify  that  all  the  NT2  revenues  have  been  transferred  to  the  NT2 \nrevenue account.  \n\nincluding  mechanisms \n\n16. \nAllocation  of  NT2  revenues.  NT2  revenues  will  be  allocated  to  priority  poverty \nreduction  and  environment  programs  identified  in  the  NGPES  and  its  successors.  The \nMinistry of Finance will be responsible for verifying that the programs to benefit from NT2 \nrevenues  meet  eligibility  criteria  (see  Box  1).  These  criteria  are  intended  to  ensure  that \nprograms  have  a  clear  poverty  reduction  or  environmental  orientation,  a  track  record  of \nfinancial  reporting  and  adequate  monitoring  systems, \nfor \nconsultation with key stakeholders. Programs will be budget entities, defined at the sub-\nsector level. Further refinement of program definitions may include geographical targeting \nof  NT2  financed  expenditures.  The  Government  has  identified  five  indicative  eligible \nprograms  on  the  basis  of  NGPES  priorities:    basic  education;  basic  health  care;  rural \nroads;  local  development  initiatives  identified  through  a  participatory  planning  process; \nand  environmental  protection  initiatives.    These  programs  are  implemented,  in  part, \nthrough  statutory  funds  \u2013  the  Road  Maintenance  Fund,  the  Poverty  Reduction  Fund \nPoverty and the forthcoming Lao Environment Fund \u2013 which have specific oversight and \ngovernance  arrangements.  The  selection  of  eligible  programs  will  have  to  be  adjusted \nperiodically  to  take  account  of  changing  development  objectives,  as  the  Government \nprepares successors to the NGPES.  Indicative allocations to the eligible programs will be \nincluded in the Government\u2019s medium-term expenditure plans. Funds will be allocated to \neligible  programs  as  part  of  a  comprehensive  State  budget.  For  budget  administration \npurposes NT2 revenues and NT2 revenue financed expenditures will constitute a \u201cvirtual \nfund\u201d:    budget  documents  will  clearly  indicate  the  proposed allocations of  NT2  revenues \nbetween  priority  programs  for  information  purposes,  but  NT2  revenues  would  be \nsubsumed  within  appropriations.  Since  NT2  revenues  will  be  co-mingled  with  other \nGovernment  funds,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  identify  individual  transactions  financed  by \nNT2 revenues.  Instead, additionality of NT2 revenues will be assessed against the base \nexpenditures of eligible programs funded from general revenues. This will reduce the risk \nof NT2 revenues substituting for funding from other sources. The method for determining \nthe additionality of NT2 revenues \u2013 and the need for continued monitoring of additionality \n\u2013  will  be  reviewed  and  agreed  with  the  NT2  financing  partners  three  years  after  project \ncommissioning and thereafter as deemed necessary. The purpose of this review will be to \nensure  policy  consistency  and  efficiency  in  the  application  of  NT2  revenues,  taking  into \naccount the structure of expenditure across the budget and absorptive capacity of eligible \nprograms.  \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix A \n\n \n\n 10\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBox 1: NT2 Eligible Program Selection Criteria \n\n\u2022  Programs  are  identified  as  priorities  in  the  Government\u2019s  National  Growth  and  Poverty \n\nEradication Strategy, and its successors; with \n\n\u2022  A significant and verifiable poverty reduction impact, providing public goods, services and \ninfrastructure  used  by  the  poor  in  rural  areas,  including  public  services  which  aim  to \npromote economic growth by increasing productivity and incomes of the poor; and / or \n\n\u2022  A significant and verifiable conservation or environmental impact; and \n\u2022  Clearly  defined  objectives,  performance  indicators  and  systems  in  place  for  monitoring \n\nperformance in terms of the volume and quality of services provided; \n\n\u2022  Established mechanisms for program performance evaluation, involving key stakeholders \n\nat or close to the field level; \n\n\u2022  Programs  are  clearly  distinguished  in  the  Government\u2019s  budget  and  chart  of  accounts \n(through a detailed administrative / organizational or program classification) at all levels of \nadministration, with institutional responsibility for program management clearly assigned; \n\n\u2022  Programs  have  administrative  and  financial  management  arrangements  in  place  allow \nthem  to  meet  financial  reporting  requirements,  and  have  demonstrated  compliance  with \nthese financial reporting requirements; \n\n\u2022  Programs  have  benefited  from  budgeted  expenditures  prior  to  selection  and  have  a \ncontinuing  recurrent  financing  requirement  over  the  medium  to  long-term,  and  with  a \nmedium-term financing plan.

All  NT2 \nrevenues will be channeled through a \nsegregated  Treasury  account  held  at \nthe  Bank  of  Lao  PDR,  the  \u201cNT2 \nRevenue  Account\u201d  (see  Figure  4).  \nthis \nFunds  will  be  released \naccount \nthe  Central  Treasury \nAccount  for  the  purposes  of  budget \nexecution  on \nthe \n(funds \napproved \nrelease authorizations) for the eligible \nprograms.  NT2  revenues  will  be  co-\nmingled  with  other  public  resources \nfollowing  standard \nand  managed \nbudget \nprocedures. \nHowever, the Minister of Finance may \nwithhold  the  release  of  part  of  the \nthe  \u201cNT2  Revenue \nfunds  held \nAccount\u201d  where:  the  application  of \nfunds \njustified  or \nappropriate, \nfor  example  where \nalternative  sources  for  funding  are \nmade \nagency \nresponsible  for  the  program  has  not \ncomplied with reporting requirements; \nthere  has  been  a  serious  control \nfailure;  funds  have  not  been  used  for \nintended;  or  where \nthe  purposes \n\nexecution \n\navailable; \n\nis  no \n\nlonger \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix A \n\n \n\n 11\n\nbudget execution has slowed significantly.  This allows the Ministry of Finance to restrict \nthe flow of funds to programs that persistently fail to meet adequate financial management \nstandards.  In order to ensure efficiency in the allocation of NT2 revenues, the Ministry of \nFinance  will  adjust  allocations  of  NT2  revenues  between  eligible  programs  in-year \nfollowing normal budgetary procedures.  Funds retained in the account at the end of the \nyear will be applied in financing eligible programs in the following fiscal year.  The Ministry \nof Finance will prepare an annual statement for the \u201cNT2 Revenue Account\u201d.  \n\nReporting  and  oversight.  The  reporting  and  oversight  requirements  for  NT2 \n18. \nrevenues  are  intended  to  promote  transparency  in  public  expenditure  management.  The \nMinistry of Finance will prepare and publish quarterly budget execution reports and annual \nfinancial statements for the eligible programs. If these reports are prepared for the state \nbudget  as  a  whole,  clearly  identifying  the  application  of  NT2  revenues,  as  currently \nscheduled  under  the  PEMSP,  specific  reports  on  the  NT2  programs  would  not  be \nnecessary.  The control environment of eligible programs will be assessed through regular \ninternal audits, undertaken by the Ministry of Finance. A summary report on internal audit \nfindings will be published.  The \u201cNT2 Revenue Account\u201d and eligible programs will also be \nsubject to annual audit, carried out by the SAO, following INTOSAI standards.  SAO will \nbe  peer-reviewed  by  an  INTOSAI  member  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  NT2 \nfinancing  partners  to  verify  that  standards  are  being  applied  and  recommend  corrective \naction  where  they  are  not.    The  peer  review  process  will  be  funded  by  NT2  financing \npartners.  Audit reports and a summary of peer review findings will be published.  \n\nTable 3: Monitoring Framework for NT2 Revenue and Expenditure Management \n\nMonitoring Instrument \n\n  Before NT2 \nCommission\ning \n\nAfter NT2 \nCommissioni\nng \n\nPEMSP Progress Reports \n\nBiannual \n\nRevenue Management Report \n\n \n\nNT2 Consultation \n\nAnnual \n\n \n\nAnnual \n\nAnnual \n\nPublic Expenditure Tracking \nSurveys \n\n2005, 2007 \n\nEvery 2 yrs \n\nPublic Expenditure Reviews \n\n2006, 2008 \n\nEvery 2 yrs \n\nAudit Peer Review \n\n2006, 2009 \n\nEvery 3 yrs \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrevenue  and  expenditure  management \n19.  Monitoring.  Monitoring  of  NT2 \narrangements  will  assess  progress  implementation  of  public  expenditure  management \nreforms,  compliance  with  arrangements  after  project  commissioning  and  the  impact  of \nNT2  financed  eligible  program  expenditures  (see  Table  3).  The  key  monitoring \ninstruments  are  Public  Expenditure  Reviews  (PERs)  and  Public  Expenditure  Tracking \nSurveys (PETs) to be carried out every two years. The first Expenditure Tracking Survey \nwill focus on the health and education sectors. Field testing is expected to take place in \nApril 2005 and the main survey in October 2005. The results of this survey will feed into a \nPublic  Expenditure  Review  covering  all  NGPES  sectors  scheduled  for  the  second  half \nFY2006.  The  intention  is  to  develop  action  plans  for  strengthening  expenditure \nmanagement  and  improving  the  impact  of  public  spending  in  the  indicative  eligible \nprograms.  Impact will be assessed in terms of the pro-poor orientation of spending and \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix A \n\n \n\n 12\n\nprogress  against  program  performance  indicators.  Follow-up  PERs  and  PETs  will  take \nplace  every  two  years,  funded  by  the  NT2  financing  partners  and  other  development \npartners.  Analytical work will provide recommendations for strengthening of expenditure \nmanagement arrangements.   \n\n20. \nConsultations.  Prior  to  project  commissioning,  the  ADB  and  the  World  Bank, \ntogether  with  other  financing  partners,  will  assess  progress  in  implementation  of  public \nexpenditure management reforms and the implementation NT2 revenue and expenditure \nmanagement  arrangements.    The  review  will  include  a  technical  assessment  as  to \nwhether the measures taken by Government are sufficient to meet agreed allocational and \ntransparency requirements.  If little progress has been made, and arrangements are not \nsufficiently robust, the review may recommend that part or all of NT2 revenues should be \nwithheld  in  the  \u201cNT2  Revenue  Account\u201d  until  the  necessary  fiduciary  safeguards  are  in \nplace.  Following  commissioning,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  publish  a  summary  report \neach year on the application of NT2 revenues, compliance with the financial management \nrequirements and the measures taken to ensure that eligible programs meet allocational \nrequirements and transparency standards. This report, together with the results of periodic \nPERs, PETs and audit peer reviews, will serve as the basis for annual consultations with \nNT2  financing  partners.  These  annual  consultations  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  the \nGovernment and NT2 financing partners to assess compliance with agreed revenue and \nexpenditure  management  arrangements  and  recommend  adjustments  in  line  with \nprogress in public expenditure management reforms.  \n\nD. \n\nBenefits, Risks and Alternatives  \n\nBenefits.  The  principal  benefit  arising  from  the  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure \n21. \nmanagement arrangements will be an increase in the level of spending on priority poverty \nreduction  and  environmental  programs.  As  a  secondary  benefit,  NT2  revenue \nmanagement  arrangements  will  improve  transparency  by  requiring  publication  of  budget \nallocations, quarterly budget execution reports, financial statements and audit reports, as \nwell  as  requiring  the  involvement  of  key  stakeholders  at  or  close  to  the  field  level  in \nprogram  evaluation.  This  represents  a  significant  step  forward  in  the  Lao  PDR  context. \nHowever, \nthe  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements  is  that  the  additional  expenditures  contribute  to  improvements  in  public \nservice  performance,  and  thereby  on  poverty  reduction  and  conservation  outcomes  \u2013 \neven if the achievement of these outcomes is influenced by a range of governance, policy \nand  management  arrangements  that  go  far  beyond  the  scope  of  the  Project.    Regular \npublic  expenditure  reviews  and  expenditure  tracking  surveys  will  provide  a  means  of \nassessing  these  impacts  and  provide  feedback  that  will  help  improve  the  development \nimpact of NT2 financed expenditures.   \n\nthe  ultimate \n\ntest  of \n\nRisks and Risk Mitigation. While the NT2 revenue and expenditure management \n22. \narrangements  should  ensure  that  NT2  revenues  will  be  applied  transparently  and \naccountably  in  financing  poverty  reduction  and  environmental  programs,  there  are  risks \nassociated with using the Government\u2019s expenditure management system.  Delays in the \nimplementation of the Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) \ncould  mean \nthe  key  elements  of  revenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements  (the  revised  chart  of  accounts,  program  level  financial  reporting  and \nmonitoring  mechanisms)  are  not \nin  place  by \nImplementation  of  PEMSP  will  benefit  from  support  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  and \nother development partners, with a considerable emphasis placed on capacity building at \nall  levels.

Six  months  before  the  commercial \noperational date, the status of NT2 revenue management arrangements will be assessed \nas  part  of  the  comprehensive  project  review.  If  little  progress  has  been  made,  NT2 \nrevenues  will  only  be  applied  in  financing  those  programs  that  meet  the  eligibility \nrequirements.    The  Ministry  of  Finance  can  withhold  program  allocations  in  the  \u201cNT2 \nRevenue  Account\u201d  until  the  eligibility  criteria  have  been  fulfilled  or  reallocate  these \nresources to other eligible programs.    \n\nAlternatives.  Design  of \n\n23. \nthe  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements  has  drawn  on  the  experience  of  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  in  a  variety  of \ncontexts:  dams, oil and gas projects, and budget support operations. Key considerations \nin assessing the suitability of this experience in the Lao PDR context include the structure \nand  volume  of  resource  flows  relative  to  total  revenues,  the  prevailing  governance \narrangements  and  the  legislative  framework  for  public  expenditure  management.  The \nalternatives considered are reviewed below:  \n\n(i)  Channeling  of  NT2  Revenues  directly  through  the  Poverty  Reduction  Fund \nand the forthcoming Lao Environment Fund. This would target NT2 revenues \nto small-scale, community identified projects and environmental initiatives, and \nmay  reduce  fiduciary  risks,  by  segregating  funds  and  providing  for  additional \nexternal  oversight  arrangements.  Two  concerns  arise.  First,  NT2  funds  are \npublic  funds  and  management  of  these  funds  should  follow  the  procedures \nlaid  out  in  relevant  legislation:    NT2  revenues  should  be  channeled  through \nTreasury  and  allocated  through  the  budget  process.    NT2  revenues  may  be \nallocated  to  statutory  funds  through  these  mechanisms  but  cannot  be \nearmarked  to  the  Funds  directly.  Second,  the  activities  supported  by  these \nfunds  may  not  represent  the  most  effective  application  of  all  NT2  revenues, \nparticularly since these Funds would not be able to finance the recurrent costs \nof  service  delivery.  Reflecting  these  concerns,  NT2  revenues  will  be \nchanneled  through  Treasury  and  allocated  through  the  budget  process.  The \nindicative  eligible  programs  identified  include,  but  are  not  restricted  to,  the \nthe  Road \nPoverty  Reduction  Fund, \nMaintenance Fund.  \n\nthe  Lao  Environment  Fund  and \n\n(ii)  Establishment  of  an  independent  oversight  body  for  NT2  revenue  and \nexpenditure  management  arrangements.  Independent  oversight  bodies  can \nplay  a  role  in  verifying  regulatory  compliance,  improving  transparency  in \ndecision-making and, in some cases, providing policy guidance. NT2 revenues \nand expenditures on eligible programs are subject to oversight by the National \nAssembly through the budget process and financial reporting process.   While \nit  may  be  appropriate  for  the  National  Assembly  to  delegate  its  oversight \nresponsibilities in the case of single purpose funds, delegation to another body \nwould be inappropriate where funds are applied across a range of sectors and \ninstitutions.  The  publication  of  key  financial  reports  should  ensure  that \nadequate standards of transparency are maintained. Furthermore, preparation \nof  the  NGPES  and  the  successors  provides  an  opportunity  for  consultation \nwith  key  stakeholders  on  expenditure  priorities.  Implementation  of  regular \npublic  expenditure  reviews  and  public  expenditure  tracking  surveys,  together \nwith  the  annual  report  on  NT2  revenue  management  arrangements,  should \nprovide  ample  opportunity \nregarding \nexpenditure priorities and performance. \n\nfor  consultation  and  oversight \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix A \n\n \n\n 14\n\n(iii)  Audit of NT2 Revenue Account and eligible programs by or in conjunction with \na  contracted  independent  auditor.  Given  the  limited  capacity  of  the  recently \ncreated  SAO,  involvement  of  an  experienced  auditor  might  lead  to  greater \nrigor in the audit process. Participation of a contracted auditor in the audit of \nthe  NT2  Revenue  Account  would  be  relatively  straightforward  but  not \nparticularly  informative,  since  this  is  effectively  a  transit  account  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  receipt  of  NT2  revenues  can  be  independently  verified  from \naudits of the source of funds (NTPC and LHSE). Participation of a contracted \nauditor  in  the  audit  of  eligible  programs  would  be  impractical:  since  NT2 \nrevenues  are  co-mingled  with  general  revenues  in  the  Treasury  account  and \ndisbursed  through  a  large  number  of  institutions  at  central,  provincial  and \ndistrict  levels,  any  contracted  auditor  would  encounter  significant  scope \nlimitations.  In this context, the INTOSAI peer review process is considered the \nmost  appropriate  means  of  helping  the  SAO  gradually  move  towards \ninternational  standards.    Regular  public  expenditure  reviews  and  public \nexpenditure  tracking  surveys  will  also  assess  the  adequacy  of  the  control \nenvironment, identify fiduciary risks and provide a framework for consultation \non the measures needed to improve financial management systems.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix B (i) \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Management Plan \n\nhttp://www.poweringprogress.org/nt2/eamp.htm \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix B (ii) \n\nSocial Development Plan \n \nhttp://www.poweringprogress.org/nt2/sdp_vol1.htm \n \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix B (iii) \n\nSocial and Environmental Management Framework and Operational Plan \n\n \n\nhttp://www.poweringprogress.org/nt2/semfop.htm\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nGender Action Plan and Strategy \n\nfor the \n\nSocial Development Plan (SDP) \n \nand \n \nSocial and Environmental Management Framework  \n \nand Operational Plan (SEMFOP) \n\nRelated to the  \nNam Theun 2 Hydropower Development Project (NT2 Project) \n \n \nDecember 2004 \n \n \n \n \n \nPrepared by Jacquelyn Chagnon, Consultant, \nADB TA 6142 Promoting Gender Equality and Women Empowerment \nADB TA 4323 Lao / GMS Nam Thuen II Hydropower Development Project, Phase II \n \n \nWith cooperation from \nthe Resettlement Management Unit (RMU) \nResettlement Office (RO) and \nWatershed Management for the Protected Area (WMPA) \n\n1\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\nI. \n\nDefinition of Gender Sensitivity \n\nPurpose and Methodology  \n\nA. \n \nThe  following  Gender  Action  Plan  and  Strategy  (GAPS)  concerns  two  large-scale  projects \nassociated  ly  with  the  construction  of  the  Nam  Theun  2  Project  (NT2):    (1)  the  Social \nDevelopment  Plan  (SDP)  and  (2)  the  Social  and  Environmental  Management  and  Operational \nPlan (SEMFOP) of the Nam Theun 2 Watershed and Management Protection Authority.   \n \nAs gender is a cross-cutting concern, the purpose of constructing the GAPS was to: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nidentify gender concerns and specific women\u2019s needs and perspectives, \nmainstream them into relevant major components, strategies, and activities of the \nabove documents,  \nintegrate  specific  women-promoting  activities \ndocuments, and  \nensure  that  women  and  men  have  equal  opportunity  to  participate  in  decision-\nmaking, training and the project benefits. \n\ninto  both  major  planning \n\n \nTherefore,  the  detailed  results  of  the  GAPS  have  been  interwoven  within  the  major  planning \ndocuments of SDP and SEMFOP, as stipulated in the Terms of Reference.  \n \nThis paper provides an overview of the components of the GAPS.  The GAPS was formulated in \nDecember 2004 through intensive group and individual discussions in Lao with: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nthe  Lao  staffs  of  the  Resettlement  Management  Unit,  the  NTPC\u2019s  Resettlement \nOffice and the Nam Theun Watershed Management and Protection Authority,  \nleaders and citizens in twenty-five impacted villages, and  \nofficials of six Nakai district offices.   \n\n \nThe  findings  also  took  into  account  the  Report  on  Gender  in  Nam  Thuen  2,  conducted  by \nIRAM in June 2004.   \n   \nThe GAPS took into consideration the following policies and decrees: \n\n(iii) \n\nGoL\u2019s Law on Development and Protection of Women, November 2004; \nGoL\u2019s  Regulation  on  Collection,  Distribution  and  Statistical  Use  of  Gender \nDisaggregated Data, (Council of Ministers, 018, 1 October 2005)   \nADB\u2019s  Gender  Policy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (OM-C2/BP  and  OM-\nC2/OP) (Annex 1); \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy OM -F2/BP and F2/OP; \nADB\u2019s Policies on Indigenous Peoples (version of 1998) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi)  World Bank\u2019s Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12),  \n(vii)  World Bank\u2019s Operational Policy on Cultural Property (OP 4.11); and \n(viii)  World Bank\u2019s Operational Directive on Indigenous People (OD 4.20).  \n\n \nFinally,  the  GAPS  took  into  consideration  the  review  and  feedback  from  a  Mini-Workshop  on \nGender Action Planning on 22 December 2004.  During this one-day session, 40 Lao staff of the \nabove offices (half women and half men) reviewed the GoL and ADB gender policies, and met \nin  small  group  discussion  groups  to  provide  comments  on  the  key  components  in  the  draft \nGAPS.  \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\nII. \n\nDefinition of Gender Planning \n\nElements for Gender Compliance   \n\nA. \n \nCompared  to  men,  women  throughout  the  world  have  less  decision-making  power,  less \neducation, less access and control over family resources, and therefore less ability to take risks \nand to cope with misfortune.  As such, gender is often labeled as a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue.\u201d  However, \ngender  in  its  broadest  scope  concerns  the  rights  and  opportunities  for  both  women  and  men.  \nAlbeit less than women, men in all societies can experience gender inequities due to social and \ncultural traditions, expectations and stereotypes. \n \nFor  overall  compliance,  the  GAPS  has  integrated  into  the  SDP  and  SEMFOP  two  types  of \nplanning actions: \n\n \n\n(i) \nMainstream gender actions which are imbedded into primary activities, and \n(ii)  Women-specific  actions,  which  are  stand-alone  activities  to  promote  the \n\ncapability, leadership and opportunity. \n\n \nThe  following  is  a  summary  of  Gender  Actions  related  to  Project  Impacted  Areas,  to  Support \nInstitutions, and Workers and Camp Followers.  \n\n1. \n\nGender Actions within Project Impacted Areas  \n\n \nEach Project Impacted Area (PIA) will witness varying degrees of positive and negative gender \nimpacts.  Key  concerns  focus  largely  on  gender  division  of  family  and  household  labour  and \nresponsibility  for  food  and  livelihood  security  (farming,  fishing,  animal  raising,  foraging  and \nhunting), and health and social security. In the Nakai Plateau, the enhancement of community \nstructures within the resettlement process creates added institutional impacts related to gender.  \nWomen\u2019s  political,  social  and  economic  empowerment  could  either  become  enhanced  or \nnegated, depending on the level of gender sensitivity within project actions.   \n \nThe IRAM gender study found that women and girls, particularly those from certain marginalized \nethnic  groups  and  those  living  within  disadvantaged  households  on  the  Nakai  Plateau,  are \ndecidedly  the  most  vulnerable  and  over-burdened  social  group.    In  the  past,  the  majority  of \nthese women and girls have had limited access to education, off-farm employment, production \nmarkets,  cash  assets,  and  socio-political  empowerment.  Even  slight  socio-economic \ndisturbances could easily overwhelm their household coping mechanisms, deepen their already \nheavy family burdens,  and over-stress their psychological welfare.  The gender risk is severe, \nrequiring continual and intense gender technical support throughout the SDP.  \n \nTherefore,  the  following  gender  impacts  and  gender-sensitive  actions  have  been  incorporated \ndirectly into the SDP and SEMFOP text as mainstreamed gender actions: \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCollection  and  analysis  of  disaggregated  community  data  by  gender,  ethnicity \nand poverty levels: \n\nPrecise recording of original ownership (husband, wife, or both) of each family\u2019s \nassets;   \nUse  of  the  term  \u201cheads  of  household\u201d  and  \u201cheads  of  family\u201d  to  recognize  the \nhidden presence of female authority; \n\n \n\n2\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nIdentification of vulnerable families (IVF) for special interventions and follow-up; \nIdentification of gender divisions of labour within each village and ethnic group to \nfoster gender-sensitive development;   \nGender-sensitive and participatory planning mechanisms; \n\n(vi) \n(vii)  Gender-sensitive monitoring and mitigation; \n(viii)  Promotion  of  gender-balanced  community  institutions,  especially  on  the  Village \nResettlement  Committees,  Village  Development  Committees,  the  Grievance \nCommittees,  the  Village  Oversight  Committees,  and  all  village  technical \ncommittees which deal with decision-making and authority on either resettlement \nand development; \nGender-sensitive  opportunities  for  income  generation  and  skills  development, \nbased upon gender divisions of labour; \nGender-balanced training and off-farm work opportunities;  \nIncreased family planning and programs for youth health and sex education; and \nSupport  for  community  education  on  Sexually  Transmitted  Infections  (STI), \nincluding HIV/AIDS, alcoholism and spouse abuse.   \n\n(x) \n(xi) \n(xii) \n\n(ix) \n\nSpecific actions to enhance the empowerment and skills of women are also included: \n\n      \n\n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nReduction of women\u2019s heavy labour (rice milling, water, and carrying loads); \nIncreased  opportunities  and  facilities  for  women  to  attend  non-formal  education \n(NFE) classes; \nVillage-based  workshops  to  build  women\u2019s  public  confidence  and  leadership \nskills; \nProvisions for female technical specialists to work closely with village women; \nTraining on setting up Women\u2019s Groups for Micro-Savings and Loans;  \nSupport for childcare facilities during resettlement; and \nVocational  training  for  young  female  and  male  adults  in  semi-skilled  and  skilled \noccupations,  needed  during  the  NT2  construction  and  for sustainable economic \nand social development of the areas.   \n\n2. \n\nGender Sensitive Actions within Support Institutions \n\n \nBy  2005,  the  Resettlement  Office  (RO),  the  Resettlement  Management  Unit  (RMU)  and  the \nWatershed  Management  and  Protection  Authority  (WMPA)  will  become  the  most  influential \ndevelopment  institutions  in  Nakai  and  Gnommalat.    Therefore,  creating  gender-balanced \nstaffing  models  and  gender  sensitive  planning  could  have  wide  reverberations  on  other  local \ninstitutions.  \n \nPatterns of personnel recruitment, assignment and training will become pivotal indicators about \ngender sensitivity within the SDP and SEMFOP.  During the latter part of 2004, the gender risks \nconcerning  internal  staffing  have  lessoned  somewhat  for  the  RO  and  RMU,  as  they  began  to \nrecruit women into community development and office positions.   \n \nAlso, at the Mini-Workshop on Gender Action Planning, 40 male and female officials identified \nthe  serious  need  to  recruit  women  into  technical  field  positions  (agriculture,  health,  education, \nmarketing and infrastructure construction).  Although women professionals are significant in the \nhealth  and  education  sectors,  they  continue  to  be  overlooked  for  field  assignments  and \nprofessional training. The situation is worse for women agricultural and marketing technicians. \nThey  are  barely  visible  in  Nakai  and  some  other  districts.    This  glaring  personnel  gap  needs \n\n \n\n3\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\nimmediate attention.  If left unaddressed this gender deficiency could jeopardize seriously vital \nfield communications and the training of women in the impacted areas.  \n \nAccording to the gender assessment, the women of the Nakai Plateau, more than anyone else, \nwill face the major brunt of the high-risk changes to family food security and livelihoods.  They \nwill  need  experienced  extension  agents,  preferably  women,  to  make  the  critical  shifts  toward \nalternatives in agriculture and marketing.  \n  \nThe  following  gender  mainstreaming  points  of  the  GAP  have  been  integrated  into  the  overall \nSDP: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nGender-balanced targets (GBTs) for recruitment and promotion within RMU, RO, \nWMPA, international and local advisory support, and district sectors working with \nNTPC;  \nStaff  Regulations  and  Enforcement  Procedures \nbehaviour; \nAnnual Gender Awareness Training for all staff;  \nAnnual  training  of  staff  on  Identification  of  Vulnerable  Families  (IVF),  and  other \npoverty, gender, and ethnic sensitive tools for community development;  \nStaff training on health issues such as STIs and HIV/AIDS, and family planning; \nSupport for on-the-job training for Development Volunteers for young adults (10 \nmen;  10  women)  in  the  Nam  Theun  Watershed  to  become  development \napprentices under the SEMFOP;  \nThe tasks for the proposed Institutional Advisor include the promotion of gender, \npoverty and ethnic sensitivity within project and village management; and  \n\nto  promote  professional \n\n(viii)  Gender-sensitivity on all monitoring and evaluation processes. \n\n \nWomen-promoting actions are also included in the SDP and SEMFOP: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nRecruitment  of  additional  women  technicians,  particularly  in  agriculture,  police, \nhealth and education; \nSpecial assistance to improve the facilities of the Lao Women\u2019s Union; and \nTraining  women  for  leadership  and  decision-making  functions  for  women \ngovernment and project staff officers.  \n\n3. \n\nGender Actions Regarding NTPC Workers and Camp Followers \n\n \nApproximately 4000 workers (about \u00bd Lao citizens) and up to 16,000 camp followers (families \nof  workers  and  service  providers)  will  impact  heavily  on  the  social,  health  and  economic \ndynamics of all PIAs, especially in Nakai, Gnommalat and Lak Sao.  The population influx could \nprove explosive.  Strong social regulations and serious enforcement procedures are essential to \navoid putting the security and health of the local population at risk.  \n \nThe  combination  of  the  dramatic  population  influx,  the  sudden  increase  in  eating  and  drinking \nestablishments and the availability of employment cash could certainly produced extremely high \nrisks  and  negative  impacts.  Worldwide,  gender  concerns  relate  closely  to  five  socio-economic \nissues, which often emerge significantly during large infrastructure construction projects:  \n\n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nThe increase in sexually transmitted infections (STI), most importantly HIV/AIDS; \nThe introduction of illegal trafficking problems, especially those involving women \nand young adolescents; \n\n \n\n4\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nThe super-inflation of local market prices due to high demand and limited supply;  \nThe rise alcoholic disease; and  \nThe escalation of physical abuse and mental illness, due to all of the above and \nthe social traumas associated with habitat and cultural changes. \n\n \nIn most of the NT2 affected areas, the risks and negative impacts will rise exponentially for local \nresidents, especially women and children, due to low education, poorly motivated policing and \nlegal  mechanisms,  limited  health  awareness  and  services,  and  deep  household  poverty.  \nTherefore, it is imperative to set forth effective and continual prevention measures.  \n \nThe  Social  Order  Management  during  the  Nam  Theun  2  Construction  issued  by  the \nKhammoune  Governor  and  President  of  the  Resettlement  Committee  in  November  2004  sets \nthe process in place.  To reinforce this order, a special Social Management Plan on the workers \nand camp followers includes the following gender-sensitive actions:  \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSet  up  a  unified  enforcement  strategy  with  clear  penalties  and  prosecution \nprocedures, enforcement training for all districts, and mechanisms to ensure the \ncommitment of local enforcers.  \nIncrease  substantially  the  number  of  women  police  enforcers  in  all  affected \ndistricts  to  protect  women\u2019s  rights  and  security  and  to  prosecute  women \noffenders. \nImplement  the  recommended  community  awareness  and  prevention  campaigns \non  the  five  above  topics,  as  addressed  in  the  gender,  health,  community  and \nsocial planning sections.  \n\n(iv)  Monitor  carefully  and  regularly  all  the  potential  socio-economic  risks  related  to \nworkers and camp followers, as they are deemed very high.  The RMU / RO, the \nexternal  monitoring  team,  and  the  POE  have  the  mandate  to  review  and \nrecommend immediate actions to the RC and NT2 companies.  \n\nTo  promote  gender  and  community  sensitive  behaviour,  the  NT2  companies  will  regulate \ndirectly their employees, using a standard and unified personnel behaviour system. This could \ninclude  a  Workers\u2019  Code  for  Appropriate  Behaviour  (signed  by  all  employees)  with  a  work \ndismissal clause for violation. Also, companies will set forth pro-active prevention mechanisms \nwithin camp living quarters (e.g., entrance restrictions and regulated in-camp establishments for \nsports, entertainment and eating.) \n\n \n\n5\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\nIII. \n\nDefinition of Gender Mainstreaming \n\nDescription of Certain Gender Sensitive Actions  \n\n \nA. \n \nThis section highlights key gender-sensitive components of the GAPS.  Staff, advisory support \nand monitoring bodies of the SDP and SEMFOP will ensure implementation and monitoring of \nthe recommended activities.    \n\n1. \n\nIdentification of Vulnerable Families    \n\n \nWithin  all  communities,  certain  families  exhibit  more  vulnerabilities  than  others.  For  both \nresettlement  and  development  efforts  it  is  best  to  set  a  baseline  ranking  of  each  community\u2019s \nfamilies:  most  vulnerable,  average,  and  better-off.    This  participatory  process,  called \nIdentification of Vulnerable Families (IVF):  \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nensures  inclusion  of  the  most  vulnerable  families  into  training  and  development \nopportunities; \nassesses stressful family circumstances, which impact heavily on women\u2019s time, \nlabor and well being; \nincludes  a  Wealth  Ranking  of \nadvantages; \nprovides a  critical indicator for monitoring how well the  most vulnerable families \nare coping with change; and  \nsignals where further safeguarding actions are needed.  \n\nfamily  assets,  circumstances  and  social \n\n \nTherefore,  performing  IVF  in  all  villages  prior  to  resettlements  in  Nakai  Plateau  and  prior  to \ncommunity  planning  in  the  Protected  Watershed  would  be  wise.    In  the  Gnommalat  Channel \nand  the  Sebangfai  Downstream  areas,  IVF  will  be  used  selectively  in  the  most  severely \nimpacted communities.     \n \nIdeally,  each  community  during  a  participatory  identification  exercise  sets  its  criteria  for \ndetermining  what  factors  constitute  different  levels  of  Vulnerable  Families.    Using  the  Lao \ncontext, indicative factors for Identifying Vulnerable Households could include: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nFamilies with a single adult laborer (a woman or a man)supporting dependents; \nFamilies with more than 5 children under the age of 10 years; \nFamilies of elders only without nearby family support; \nFamilies supporting dependent elderly or handicapped persons;  \nFamilies in ethnically mixed communities that are in the ethnic minority;   \nFamilies with the least food security; \nFamilies  with  the  least  wealth  assets  (animals,  tools,  mechanical  equipment, \nbicycles, motorbikes, household items.)     \n\n \nCommunities can add or delete these factors, according to their circumstances. \n \nAfter a community has identified the factors for vulnerable families (high, medium, and low, or \nmost  disadvantaged,  average  or  better-off),  each  household  is  assigned  a  symbol  to  note  its \nvulnerability level. In this way, technical and community development staff will be able to ensure \nthat  highly  Vulnerable  Families  are  incorporated  into  training,  decision-making  session,  and \nincome-generating  activities.  Community  Development  experts  will  need  to  train  staff  on  this \nprocess and the Monitoring and Evaluation team will need to monitor this process closely.  \n\n \n\n6\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\n \nFor the Nakai Plateau villages, the vulnerability ranking will be performed prior to resettlement.   \nFor the Watershed Protected Area, the IVF will take place during the baseline data collection, \nprior to community planning efforts.  Depending on the impact of the socio-economic changes in \nthe Channel and Downstream zones, IVF may also need to be performed. \n  \n\nRecommended Actions For Insertion into SDP: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nTraining for all RMU / RO staff on Identification of Vulnerable Families \nIdentification of Vulnerable Families in Nakai Plateau \nSpecial internal monitoring of the resettlement of Vulnerable Families \nExternal monitoring of Vulnerable Families  \nDetermination of areas to identify Vulnerable Families in channel area \nDetermination of areas to identify Vulnerable Families in downstream area  \n\nRecommended Actions For Insertion into SEMFOP: \n\nTraining for all WMPA staff on Identification of Vulnerable Families \nIdentification of Vulnerable Families in 4 watershed zones \nRegular monitoring of Vulnerable Families \nExternal monitoring of Vulnerable Families  \n\n2. \n\nDisaggregated Data Collection  \n\n \nFor the most part, the SDP\u2019s process for collecting disaggregated baseline data by gender and \nby ethnic group is beginning to occur. (SEMFOP has not begun its field process yet.)  However, \nwithin villages and among villages further distinctions will need to be made.  As 3.1 suggests, \njudging  vulnerability  requires  the  disaggregation  of  a  combination  of  gender,  ethnicity  and \npoverty  factors.    For  example,  the  livelihood  change-risks  soar  to  the  extreme  for  an  illiterate \nethnic minority family with only one woman adult labourer whose food security relies on upland \nrice growing, foraging and fishing.  On the other hand, a female-headed household with a male \nyouth and access to paddy rice is much better off.  Therefore, particularly for the 17 resettling \nvillages,  a  scaling  system  using  the  disaggregated  data  would  be  instrumental  for  pinpointing \nand  tracking  vulnerable  families  and  individuals.  Likewise,  a  scaling  system  on  village \nvulnerability within an area could be constructed to intensify support to high-risk communities. \n \nConcerning  disaggregated  data  on  families  and  households,  four  concerns  need  further \nattention and clarification.    \n \nFirst, when recording family land and household assets, gender ownership should be carefully \nrecorded.  Often  household  and  farming  land  and  assets  belong  equally  to  male  and  female \nheads  of  household.  However,  in  some  cases  only  one  spouse  owns  through  inheritance  the \nland  or  the  assets.  Depending  on  the  ethnic  group,  a  man  or  a  woman  in  the  Lao  PDR  can \ninherit  land  and  valuable  goods.    To  assume  both  spouses  own  the  land  or  assets  together \ncould  create  tensions  and  legal  problems.  Therefore,  recorders  will  need  first  to  ask  both  the \nhusband and the wife who is the original owner of the land or asset.  If ownership is with one \n\n \n\n7\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\nperson, he / she has the option to share or not to share the land and assets with a spouse.1  In \nthis way, a gender-sensitive approach for both men and women is achieved.    \n \nSecond,  a  clear  distinction  needs  to  be  made  between  \u201chousehold\u201d  and  \u201cfamily.\u201d    Many \nhouseholds are multi-family in the Lao PDR.  Within a household designated as well-off, there \ncould  exist  a  hidden  high  risk  family  (adult  and  children).    This  is  especially  important  within \nethnic groups with multiple wives.        \n \nThird,  when  listing  household  decision-makers,  it  is  preferable  to  use  the  gender-sensitive \nterminology of \u201cheads of household\u201d and \u201cheads of family.\u201d  In this way, the two lead persons, \nusually  the  husband  and  the  wife,  are  both  recognized  equally  for  land  registration, \ncompensation, training and decision-making.  Traditionally, within most ethnic groups in the Lao \nPDR, women usually hold authority over socio-economic decisions and men over political ones.  \nThus,  especially  when  encouraging  socio-economic  development  (agriculture,  small  livestock \nraising,  marketing,  informal  and  formal  trading,)  women\u2019s  roles  can  be  significant, though  less \nobvious to outsiders.  \n \nFourth, labour division by gender and age can vary significantly among the ethnic groups and \nwithin an ethnic group depending on its isolation.  There are differences, for example, on labour \ndivision  patterns  between  the  Brou  living  on  the  Nakai  Plateau  and  those  in  the  Protected \nWatershed.    Certain  household  and  field  tasks  vary  depending  on  their  remoteness  and \nexposure  to  other  cultural  ways.    For  example,  men  often  cook  more  than  women  in  Brou \nhouseholds  in  the  distance  Watershed  villages.  Also,  men  help  with  childcare  in  the  evenings \nwhen women are in the fields, fetching water and pounding rice pounding. Consequently, both \nmen  and  women  would  benefit  from  training  on  food  preparation  and  preservation,  and  on \nchildcare.  Therefore, it is essential to collect and analyze gender-disaggregated data on labour \ndivision in each village, and set detailed planning implementation accordingly. \n \n\nRecommended Actions For Insertion into RAP and SEMFOP: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nland  and  assets  surveys  and  registration,  particularly \n\nTrain and monitor all staff and technical experts on the reasons for collecting and \nanalyzing  gender  disaggregated  data  and \nthe  use  of  gender-sensitive \nterminology. \nEnsure \nthe \nthat \ncompensation  cases  in  the  Gnommalat  Reservoir  and  Channel  Area,  recognize \nthe rights of original single owners, regardless of sex.  \nCollect and analyze data on each village\u2019s pattern for labour division by gender \nand age. \nEnsure detailed action plans and implementation correspond correctly to gender \nlabour  divisions,  especially  in  the  agriculture,  livestock-raising  and  forestry \nsectors.  \n\n3. \n\nTraining on Gender Awareness  \n\n \nWorldwide,  many  organizations,  corporations  and  projects  include  Training  on  Gender \nAwareness as part of annual staff training sessions.  The objective is to challenge everyone to \nincorporate  gender  sensitivity  and  gender  promoting  actions  into  his  or  her  duties.    For \n\n                                            \n1  See the 1997 Land Law, SEMFOP, Volume 2, Annex 4.8.   The World Bank took note in the mid-1990\u2019s during the \ninitial land titling process in Vientiane when some women landowners unknowingly lost sole power over their land. \nThus, the Land Law currently recognizes the name(s) on land certificates or other land documents. \n\n \n\n \n\n8\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\ninstitutional  effectiveness  in  the  RMU/  RO  and  WMPA,  participation  by  all  staff,  government \ncolleagues and experts, regardless of status, gender or duties, would be a best practice.    \n \nThe Gender Resource, Information and Development Center (GRID) of the Lao Women\u2019s Union \nand various development training centers based in Vientiane can be hired to assist with gender \nawareness training.  Women\u2019s Actions and Resource Initiatives (WARI), based in Bangkok, also \nconducts  annually  excellent  regional  gender  courses  for  SE  Asian  senior  and  mid-level \nprofessionals with both male and female facilitators.  Lao officials who have attended found the \nexercise to be highly motivating.  \n \nThe  make-up  of  gender  training  teams  will  be  gender  balanced  as  it  is  considered  a  best \npractice for raising awareness among male leaders and project staff.   \n  \n\nRecommended Actions For Insertion into SDP and SEMFOP: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nJoint  training  and  workshops  required  annually  on  Gender  Awareness  and \nReviews  for  all  staffs  (male  and  female)  of  SDP  and  SEMFOP,  their  advisory \nsupport teams and their related government and private counterparts. \nMonitoring  of  pre-set  indicators  on  Gender  Sensitivity  and  Gender  Awareness \ntraining. \n\n4. \n\nCode for Staff Regulations and Enforcement Process \n\n \nTrust in and respect for outside professionals are key ingredients for successful change in any \ndevelopment  or  resettlement  situation.    Villagers  quickly  judge  the  integrity  of  community \ndevelopers  and  technicians  by  every  day  work  and  living  habits.    In  addition,  the  power  of \noutsiders coming with funds for development can be awesome, especially in highly vulnerable, \npoor  settings  such  as  Nakai  and  Gnommalat.    Work  codes  promote  work  environments  that \npractice  good  governance,  transparency,  and  gender  sensitivity  and  can  form  a  useful \nmonitoring tool.  \n \nDuring  the  December  2004  Gender  Mini-Workshop,  male  and  female  participants  agreed  that \nwomen tend to be attracted to organizations holding to and enforcing staff work codes.2  Such \npersonnel regulations instruct staff on best working practices, behavior prohibitions during field \nand office work, the consequences of inappropriate personnel behavior, and the oversight and \ngrievance procedures.  During the December 2004 Workshop on Gender, RO, RMU and WMPA \nstaff agreed that such personnel codes with written enforcement procedures would be useful.   \n \nFor limiting negative social and economic impacts during construction, NTPC-related companies \nwill emulate good management practices by creating a unified Workers Code with enforcement \nprocedures including dismissal for violation.     \n \n\nRecommended Actions For Insertion into SDP and SEMFOP: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nSet Staff Regulations and Enforcement Procedures. \nMonitor review regularly enforcement and compliance. \nRequire  all  workers  of  NTPC-related  companies  to  sign  and  abide  by  unified \nregulations and enforcement procedures.  \n\n                                            \n2   Models  for  Staff  Work  Codes  and  Procedures  are  available  from  the  NTPC-hired  Lao  Earth  Systems,  Quaker \n\nService Laos, Mennonite Central Committee and numerous other INGOs.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nSetting Targets for Gender-Balanced Staffing Patterns and Training \n\n \nBoth  the  SEMFOP  and  SDP  have  set  annual  Gender-Balanced  Targets  (GBTs)  regarding \nrecruitment,  promotion,  training  and  assignment  of  tasks.  The  progressively  increasing  targets \non  the  RO,  RMU  and  WMPA  considered  several  points  based  upon  mid-December  2004 \ngender data: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nDistrict civil service make-up by profession and level, \nRO, RMU and WMPA staffing make-up as of the end of 2004, and  \nthe national estimate for Lao professionals in various fields by gender3.    \n\n \nWithin the SDP and SEMFOP, indicative GBT staffing tables have been set; the table will need \nto be reviewed and revised annually as part of annual planning exercises. \n   \n\nRecommended Actions For Insertion into SDP and SEMFOP: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nRO, RMU and WMPA will set and review gender-balance targets for government \nand contracted staffing at all levels as part of the annual planning process. \nRO, RMU and WMPA will report annually on how each is providing progressive \nopportunities for women professionals at all levels. \nRO,  RMU  and  WMPA  will  ensure  that  each  plan  activity,  especially  training,  at \nthe village and institutional levels contain GBTs as indicators of compliance. \n(iv)  When  offices  are  unable  to  meet  GBTs,  a  senior  level  staff  will  explain  in  the \nreporting why compliance was not possible and how the process will be improved \nfor subsequent activities.   \n\n(iii) \n\n6. \n\nBuilding  Women\u2019s  Leadership  and  Empowerment  within  Community  and \nArea Institutions \n\n \nWorldwide,  women  are  increasingly  assuming  significant  roles  in  local  development  activities, \nas a primary step for equity in leadership and decision-making.  In the Lao PDR, development \nassessments  have  repeatedly  shown  how  the  inclusion  of  women  into  non-traditional  roles  of \nleadership and technical matters increases the chance for sustainable development.   \n\nYet, within Lao community institutions women\u2019s public empowerment remains too marginal and \nlargely  delegated  to  representatives  of  the  Women\u2019s  Union.    For  example,  within  the  Nakai \nPlateau,  almost  all  villages  nominated  only  the  LWU  representative  to  the  five-person \nVRC/VDCs.  Yet, in December 2004 interviews with twenty-two Women\u2019s Union representatives \nfrom  14  Nakai  villages,  there  was  overwhelming  concern  about  the  under-representation  of \nwomen on local decision-making and operational bodies.  They explained that a single woman \nis  usually  reluctant  to  speak  up  in  male-dominated  situations.  The  SDP  includes  an  indicative \ngender-balanced model for community institutions.   As a model, the Nong Bua pilot village is \nimproving its gender balance on all its leadership and technical committees. \n \nFurthermore,  within  most  district  and  province  government  service  offices  and  village \ninstitutions, except the Lao Women\u2019s Union, women are severely under-rated, under-used, and \nunder-trained.  To encourage women\u2019s education levels to rise and to produce improved holistic \ndevelopment  processes,  the  appointment  of  women  into  diverse  professional  and  technical \n\n                                            \n3   Note: trying to get latest national source from GRID; if not will use WID/ADB 1995 source. \n\n \n\n10\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix C \n\npositions  and  into  leadership  is  critical.    As  fishing  and  the  gathering  of  non-timber  forest \nproducts  involve  women  as  well  as  men,  community  women\u2019s  perspectives  within  proposed \narea-wide fishing and forestry associations will be critical.   \n \n\n  Recommended Actions For Insertion into SDP and SEMFOP: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nWomen  civil  servants  and  village  women  in  Nakai  and  Ggommalat  will  have \nopportunity to attend annual Workshops on Building Leadership and Confidence. \nClasses for women for Non-formal Education training will be given high priority.    \nThe  WMPA  will  ensure  that  ten  young  women  adults  are  selected  as \nDevelopment Volunteers in the Nam Theun Watershed zones. \n\n(iv)  WMPA  and  the  RMU  will  ensure  that  the  area-wide  forestry  and  fishing \n\n(v) \n\nassociations include one \u2013half women on decision-making bodies.  \nSeats  of  authority  will  be  reserved  for  women  on  community  institutions  and \ntechnical  working  groups.

In  this  report,  we  assess  the  impact  that  the  project  is  likely  to  have  on  the \nmacroeconomy, as well as how this may then translate into poverty outcomes in the country. \n\nIn  addressing  the  poverty  implications  of  the  Project,  it  is  important  to  distinguish  the \n2. \ndirect  macroeconomic  impact  from  the  impact  possible  from  alternative  uses  of  the  income \nstream accruing to the Government as a result of the project. It is important to emphasize at the \noutset \nthe  direct \nthe  poverty \nmacroeconomic impacts alone. In other words, we focus on the construction phase rather than \nthe operational phase. \n\nimplications  deriving \n\nfocuses  on \n\nthis  report \n\nfrom \n\nthat \n\n3. \nThe  large  capital  investment  (approximately  $1.2  billion)  will  generate  a  very  sizable \nincome stream for the next three decades and beyond. Through taxes, royalties and dividends, \nthe people of Lao PDR stand to be major beneficiaries. The boost in revenues will strengthen \nthe  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  provide  the  public  goods  and  services  essential  for  sustainable \ngrowth and poverty reduction.  Although this revenue stream could have a significant influence \non economic and social conditions, they are noted but not analyzed here because they do not \nform part of the direct macroeconomic impacts of the project. \n\n4. \nThe report is organized as follows. After a brief overview of the Lao economy, the likely \nmacroeconomic  impacts  are  examined.  This  is  followed  by  an  analysis  of  the  likely  poverty \nimpacts  resulting  from  the  direct  macroeconomic  changes  induced  by  the  Project.  A  final \nsection summarizes the main points. \n\nII. \n\nECONOMIC OVERVIEW \n\n5. \nLao PDR is classified as a less developed country (LDC), with GDP per capita of about \n$330.  Annual  GDP  growth  has  averaged  about  6.5%  over  the  past  decade,  and  most \nprojections point to a continuing of this trend for the next few years at the very least. Years of \ncontinuous strong growth has lead to an appreciable decline in poverty incidence (see Section \nIV). The agricultural sector contributes more than 50% of GDP and employs about 80% of the \nworkforce.  In  this  regard,  Lao  PDR\u2019s  economic  prospects  continue  to  hinge  crucially  on  the \nperformance of this sector.  \n \n6. \nWith  the  introduction  of its  \"New  Economic  Mechanism\"  in  1986,  Lao  PDR  has  been \ngradually  transforming  its  economy,  shifting  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  market-oriented \nsystem. Reforms have been pursued in several areas, including trade policy, public expenditure \nmanagement, natural resources management, state-owned enterprises, and the banking sector.  \nAlthough much has been achieved in these areas over the years, many challenges remain. \n \nOne  of  the  most  significant  challenges  facing  the  government  relates  to  improving  the \n7. \ncollection  and  management  of  public \ntransparency  and \naccountability in the use of public funds. The share of government revenue in GDP continues to \nhover  around  the  10\u201312%  mark  and,  with  limited  room  to  maneuver  on  the  expenditure  front, \nthis  often  leads  to  budget  deficits  that  put  upward  pressure  on  inflation.  Lao  PDR  has  been \nsusceptible  to  episodes  of  hyperinflation  in  the  recent past, and inflation continues to linger in \nthe low double-digits. \n\nrevenues  and \n\nincreasing \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n8. \nLao  PDR\u2019s  major  exports  include  electricity,  minerals,  garments  and  coffee,  whilst \nalmost all of its demands for manufactured (consumer and capital) goods are imported. Most of \nits  trade  is  conducted  within  the  region,  with  Thailand  as  its  main  trading  partner,  and  largest \ninvestor.  The  external  debt  stock  is  estimated  at  about  $2  billion  in  2004.  However,  given  the \nconcessional nature of the majority of this debt, the debt service ratio remains at a manageable \nlevel of less than 10%. \n \n\nIII. \n\nMACROECONOMIC IMPACTS \n\nThe  main  impacts  of  the  Project  on  the  macroeconomy  are  likely  to  operate  through \n\n9. \nchanges in economic growth and the real exchange rate. \n\nA. \n\nImpact on Economic Growth  \n\n10. \nSince Lao PDR\u2019s economy is not fully employed, this large construction project will have \na  significant  impact  on  output  and  employment.  It  is  estimated  that  the  Nam  Theun  2  project \ncould  lead  to  an  almost  doubling  in  private  investment  during  the  construction  phase  (IMF, \n2003).  Approximately  $350  million  will  be  spent  in  Lao  PDR  during  the  4.5  year  construction \nperiod  for  civil  works.  The  construction  phase  (approximately  54  months)  will  employ  up  to \n4,000  workers,  and  an  estimated  16,000  dependents  and  job  seekers  (for  various  support \nservices) will concentrate in the site area. There will also be multiplier effects, as the first round \nof income leads to expenditure and income for others, who in turn spend. \n\nThe net effect of these factors could be a boost in economic growth over the base case \n11. \nby  perhaps  as  much  as  a  full  percentage  point  during  the  construction  phase.  Currently,  the \ngrowth rate is about 6.5%, and so a rate of 7-7.5% is possible during the 2006 to 2011 period, \nceteris paribus.1 \n\nB. \n\nGrowth in Income and Per Capita Consumption  \n\n12. \nThe  higher  GDP  growth  rate  will  lead  to  higher  personal  income  and  per  capita \nconsumption.  But  this  effect  is  likely  to  be  small  relative  to  other  sources  of  GDP  growth.  As \nnoted above, most of the investment demand will take the form of imported capital equipment. \nFurthermore,  most  of  the  income  stream  in  the  first  ten  years  of  operation  will  accrue  to  debt \nholders and foreign shareholders. Drawing on the relationship between GDP growth and growth \nin per capita consumption evidenced between 1992/93 and 1997/98, and discounting by 50% to \nreflect  the  high  degree  of  imported  inputs  associated  with  the  Project,  growth  in  per  capita \nconsumption could increase by half a percentage point, from 3.5 to about 4% per annum as a \nresult of the Project. \n\nC. \n\nExchange Rate Effects  \n\n13. \nAn  increase  in  capital  inflows  (during  the  construction  phase)  and  a  sharp  increase  in \nexport earnings (from the sale of power to Thailand) could be expected to result in appreciation \nof the domestic currency. At face value, the Project has all the ingredients necessary to produce \na typical \u201cDutch Disease\u201d type outcome. Normally, we would expect Dutch Disease type effects \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Lao  economy  has  been  susceptible  to  episodes  of  hyperinflation  in  the  past  resulting  from  domestic  and \nexternal  shocks.  The  boost  to  economic  growth  will  put  upward  pressure  on  domestic  prices  and,  unless \naccommodating macroeconomic policies are introduced, the benefits from improved growth could be impaired. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nto  operate  by  adversely  affecting  the  competitiveness  of  other  export  sectors  through \nappreciation of the real exchange rate, resulting in a widening trade deficit.   \n\n14. \nBut  the  economy  of  Lao  PDR  is  not  altogether  typical.  There  are  not  too  many  other \nexport  sectors  to  be  adversely  affected,  and  some  may  be  insulated  to  some  extent  by  either \nspecial  arrangements  (preferential  access  to  its  main  markets  in  the  case  of  clothing)  or  the \npresence of non-market conditions (informal cross border trade in the case of timber).  Even if \nDutch Disease type effects do not have a significant adverse effect on other export sectors, they \nwould serve to delay, or compromise, the process of diversification of the export base itself. In \nother  words,  not  only  would  Nam  Theun  2  directly  contribute  to  export  concentration  by \nincreasing the share of electricity exports in total exports, the Dutch Disease type effects that it \nwould  induce  through  the  real  exchange  rate  may  create  a  further  impediment  to  the \ndevelopment of new export industries. This could contribute to increased risk of export instability \nin the future.  \n\n15. \nIn large measure, the likelihood of Dutch Disease type effects depends on the extent of \nthe real exchange rate appreciation. The extent of the appreciation, in real terms, is difficult to \nestimate however.2  \n\n16. \nIn order to gain some insight on the issue, we look at movements in the real exchange \nrate during the 1990s and the beginning of this decade, but excluding the turbulent post-Asian \nfinancial crisis period. Capital inflows increased during the early 1990s and then more recently, \nresulting  in  both  cases  in  some  appreciation  in  the  real  exchange  rate.  Based  on  this \nexperience, and after adjusting for the high import content of the Nam Theun 2 project, the real \nappreciation in the exchange rate as a result of the project could be in the order of 1.7% during \nthe construction phase. During the operational phase, real appreciation of the exchange rate as \na result of the project would be an estimated 0.75%. These rates of appreciation are considered \n\u201cmoderate and manageable but not zero\u201d (Warr, 2004).3  \n\n17. \nDespite  being  small  in  magnitude,  the  appreciation  of  the  real  exchange  rate  would \nnevertheless  put  traded  goods  at  a  disadvantage.  Exchange  rate  appreciation  from  large \ninvestments  in  capital-intensive  industries  can  pose  a  threat  to  Lao  PDR\u2019s  comparative \nadvantage in agriculture, forestry and low wage light manufacturing and service industries. Lao \nPDR\u2019s  exports  would  become  more  costly  to  foreign  buyers,  while  imports  for  Lao  consumers \nwould  become  less  expensive.  It  could  also  adversely  affect  tourism.  In  short,  the competitive \nposition of Lao products and services would be weakened. The issue of competitiveness is of \ngrowing importance, as Lao PDR becomes increasingly open and subject to regional and global \ntrade  liberalization  pressures,  such  as  under  the  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Agreement  (AFTA)  and \nthrough their pursuit of membership of the WTO. \n\n18.  While the Project is not perceived to pose a serious problem in terms of Dutch Disease \ntype  effects,  concentration  in  capital  intensive  industries  in  the  future  could  undermine \nprospects for the rapidly growing labour force, as well as increase vulnerability to terms of trade \nshocks. \n\n                                                 \n2    This  estimation  is  further  complicated  by  the  fact  that  the  monetary  situation  in  Lao  PDR  is  characterized  by  the \nmultiple-currency phenomenon. Apart from kip, Thai baht and US dollars circulate freely, and serve all functions of \nmoney. \n\n3   Adjustment  should  also  take  account  of  the  fact  that  approximately  70%  of  the  financing  for  the  Nam  Theun  2 \nproject  will  be  in  the  form  of  debt  financing.  Interest  and  debt  repayments,  therefore,  would  further  mitigate \nsymptoms of the Dutch disease, especially during the rapid payback period.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nIV. \n\nPOVERTY IMPACTS \n\nLao PDR is the least developed of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries and \n19. \none of the poorest countries in Asia, both in terms of per capita income and in terms of various \nsocial indicators. Preliminary estimates from the Lao Expenditure and Consumptions Survey III \n(LECS  III)  indicate  a  decrease  in  the  incidence  of  poverty  from  39%  in  1997/98  to  32%  in \n2003/03.4  The  LECS  III  data  also  indicate  a  more  equitable  growth  pattern  between  1997/98 \nand  2002/03,  largely  as  a  result  of  strong  growth  in  the  agricultural  sector.  Despite  this  sharp \nreduction over a five-year period, poverty incidence remains unacceptably high in Lao PDR. \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Implications of the Macroeconomic Impacts \n\n20. \nThe  main  impact  on  poverty  incidence  is  likely  to  come  from  the  boost  to  economic \ngrowth. If the Project results in a one-percentage point increase in the GDP growth rate during \nthe construction phase (between 2006\u20132011), then there is likely to be a discernable reduction \nin poverty incidence. \n\n21. \nAs  illustrated  by  the  experience  of  neighboring  countries  such  as  Thailand,  Viet  Nam, \nPRC  etc.,  rapid  economic  growth  can  be  the  single  most  important  contributor  to  poverty \nreduction (ADB, 2004a). In Lao PDR, the 6.3% average growth rate in GDP during the 1992/93 \nto  1997/98  period  contributed  to  the  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  poverty  from  46%  to  39%. \nPreliminary  data  from  the  LECS  III  indicates  that  the  continued  growth  rate  of  about  6%  has \nresulted in a further reduction in the incidence (headcount) of poverty to about 32%.  \n\n22. \nAs  an  approximation  based  on  a  simple  average,  a  sustained  6%  growth  rate  over  a \nfive-year  period  appears  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  poverty  by  about  7  percentage  points. \nBased on recent historical experience, then each percentage point of growth sustained over a \nfive-year period appears to reduce the incidence of poverty by 1.2 percentage points. This is not \nto ignore the factors other than economic growth that would have contributed to this reduction in \npoverty. But if we assume that these other factors continue to play an unchanged role into the \nfuture, then one could deduce that the Nam Theun 2 project, with its expected one percentage \npoint  boost  to  GDP  growth  during  2006\u20132011,  would  contribute  to  lowering  the  incidence  of \npoverty by up to 1.2 percentage points annually 5 If this is the case, the combined GDP effect of \nthe  Nam  Theun  2  project  during  the  construction  phase  could  help  lift  approximately  60,000 \npeople above the poverty line annually. \n\n23. \nIt could be expected that project site areas such as Khammouane Province would be the \nmain  beneficiary,  provided  all  the  environmental  and  social  mitigation  measures  are  fully  and \n(Borikhamxay  and \nsuccessfully \n\n(ADB,  2004b).  Neighboring  provinces \n\nimplemented \n\n                                                 \n4   Social and economic indicators from the LECS III are presented in Government of Lao PDR (2004). LECS III was \n\nundertaken between March 2002 and February 2003, involving 8,100 households from 540 villages.  \n\n5   This  assumes  a  linear  relationship  between  changes  in  economic  growth  and  changes  in  poverty  incidence.    As \npoverty incidence falls to levels that are relatively low (eg., below 10% or so), we would expect this relationship to \nweaken  in  that  a  1%  point  increase  in  GDP  growth  will  no  longer  reduce  poverty  incidence  by  the  amount  that  it \nmight  have  when  poverty  incidence  was  much  higher.  Like  with  unemployment,  there  is  a  residual  amount  of \npoverty  that  is  not  easily  affected  by  economic  growth,  and  would  require  highly  targeted  economic  and  social \nprograms.  In  other  words,  the  role  that  targeted  interventions  can  play  in  reducing  poverty  increases  as  the \nincidence of poverty falls. With current poverty levels still above 30% in Lao PDR, it is unlikely that this threshold \nwill be reached and so it is relatively safe to assume a linear relationship will continue to hold between changes in \neconomic growth and changes in poverty incidence.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nSavannakhet)  would  also  be  major  beneficiaries,  but  positive  ripple  effects  should  spread \nthroughout the economy.   \n\nV. \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n24. \nThe macroeconomic impact of the Nam Theun 2 project is expected to be positive as a \nresult of the boost to GDP growth driven mainly by a sharp increase in private sector investment \nduring  the  construction  phase.  While  most  of  the  investment  will  be  incurred  for  imported \nequipment, civil works will directly employ some 4,000 workers. Together with multiplier effects, \nGDP growth could be spurred by up to a full percentage point in each year of the construction \nphase. It is unlikely that there will be significant Dutch Disease type effects since the expected \nappreciation of the real exchange rate is likely to be small. Nevertheless, competitiveness of the \ntraded  goods  sector  will  be  adversely  affected,  but  this  effect  could  be  mitigated  through \nreforms that increase productivity.  \n\n25. \nGiven  that  economic  growth  is  the  main  determinant  of  poverty  reduction,  the  positive \ngrowth  effects  of  the  Nam  Theun  2  project  could  contribute  significantly  to  poverty  reduction. \nBased on recent historical experience, it is estimated that the combined GDP effect of the Nam \nTheun  2  project  during  the  construction  phase  could  help  lift  approximately  60,000  people  up \nabove the poverty line annually. \n\n26. \nHaving  said  that  however,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  poverty  situation  in  Lao  PDR  is \ncomplex, interwoven with the ethnic fabric that so characterizes the country. In this report, we \nhave focused only on the direct macroeconomic impacts of the project. If the revenues accruing \nto  the  government  are  well  managed  and  efficiently  employed  to  address  poverty  and  social \nconditions, then the benefits to the Lao people could be substantially greater than the positive \nmacroeconomic  impacts  described  here.  The  provision  of  additional  electricity  to  the  areas \nwithin and adjacent to the project site would also contribute to improved living conditions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fREFERENCES \n\n \nADB (2001), Participatory Poverty Analysis: Lao PDR.

The  Government  of  Lao  (GOL)  is  a  25%  shareholder  in \nNTPC, sharing ownership with a consortium of foreign sponsors including Electricit\u00e9 de France \nInternational  (EDF,  35%)  and  two  Thai  companies,  Electricity  Generating  Public  Company \n(EGCO, 25%) and Italian-Thai Development Public Company Ltd (ITD, 15%). Upon anticipated \ncommencement  of  commercial  operation  in  November  2009,  NTPC  will  sell  power  at  pre-\nnegotiated prices to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and to Electricit\u00e9 du \nLaos  (EdL).  While  the  NT2  Project  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by  NTPC,  the  generation \nserving Thailand will be under the full dispatch control of EGAT. \n\n2. \nIn  the  following  paragraphs,  the  economic  impact  of  the  proposed  project  is  evaluated \nfrom  the  regional  perspective,  including  both  Thailand  and  Lao  PDR,  and  from  the  Lao  PDR \ncountry perspective.  The analysis begins with a summary of electricity demand and expansion \nplanning in each country.  It then proceeds to a valuation of project costs and benefits, followed \nby an assessment of the project economic rate of return (EIRR) for both the region and for Lao \nPDR.    Sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  was  conducted  for  each  perspective.    Finally,  the  report \nconsiders the distribution of economic benefits among stakeholders across the region.   \n\nB. \n\nThailand \n\n1. \n\nDemand Forecast \n\n3. \nLoad  forecasting  in  Thailand  is  a  collaborative  effort  of  the  major  stakeholders.  The \nThailand  Load  Forecast  Sub-committee  (TLFS)2  considers  a  number  of  methodologies,  and \nreviews  the  work  of  participating  agencies  before  integrating  results  into  a  national  load \nforecast.  Forecasting techniques vary by:  \n\n(i) \n\ndistribution  company  (Metropolitan  Electricity  Authority \nBangkok, and Provincial Electricity Authority [PEA] in the rest of the country); \n\n[MEA] \n\nin  greater \n\n(ii) \n\ncustomer class (i.e., residential, small and large business, industrial, etc.); and \n\n(iii) \n\nforecast horizon (i.e., short-term or long-term).  \n\n4. \nFour  methods  are  used  for  energy  forecasting.  Two  of  these  methods  might  be \ndescribed  as  \u201cbottom  up\u201d  in  that  they  depend  on  detailed  knowledge  of  end-users,  while  two \nothers  might  be  characterized  as  \u201ctop  down\u201d,  since  they  depend  on  macroeconomic  trends. \n                                                           \n1  The exact capacity of the NT2 Project requires some explanation. The developer (NTPC) identifies the capacity as \n995  MW  (plus  75  MW  dedicated  to  Lao  domestic  consumption),  the  rating  of  the  installed  turbines.  EGAT, \nhowever, designates the plant as 920 MW, the estimated minimum monthly delivery. The difference between the \ntwo  numbers  is  (i)  transmission  losses  to  the  purchase-point  at  the  Thai  border,  and  (ii)  what  one  EGAT  official \ncalls  a  \u201cmargin  of  security\u201d  for  the  sake  of  system  reliability.  The  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  is  priced  in \nterms of GWh and hence the MW definition is not important for purposes of this analysis. \n\n2  The committee is comprised of representatives from EPPO (formerly NEPO), EGAT, MEA, PEA, DAEDE (formerly \nDEDP),  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Board  (NESDB),  the  National  Statistics  Office  (NSO),  the \nFederation of Thai Industries, the Thailand Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Thai Power Generators, and \nthe Thailand Development and Research Institute (TDRI). \n\n\fThere is also an independent method for forecasting peak demand. The following methods are \nused: \n\nSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n2\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimprovement. \n\nEnd-Use  Model:  Consumption  for  residential  customers  throughout  Thailand  is \nderived from comprehensive surveys of dwelling types by income, and appliance \nutilization  in  each.  Forecasts  depend  on  growth  in  number  of  households, \nappliance  saturation,  and  expected  appliance  efficiency \nIn \naddition,  EGAT\u2019s  large  direct-service  customers  are  forecast  by  individual  firm \nsurvey.  \nFloor  Space  Model:    Short-term  (less  than  5  years)  consumption  for  large \nbusiness (commercial customers > 30 kW) in the MEA service territory is forecast \nbased on available data on floor space by type of building. Data on building stock \nis adjusted for factors such as demolition, construction deferral, occupancy rate, \netc. Total consumption is then calculated from survey data on energy use within \neach type of building. Factors are applied to incorporate efficiency improvement \ninto the forecast; \nEnergy  Intensity  Model:  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  disaggregated  by \nregion  and  by  business  sector  so  that  energy  consumption  relationships  by \nsector  can  be  evaluated.  Total  consumption  is  derived  based  on  historical \nconsumption per unit of gross regional product (GRP), and the forecast growth in \nGRP  by  sector.  The  energy  intensity  model  is  used  where  \u201cfirst  hand\u201d  sources \n(e.g.,  Board  of  Expansion  data,  and  surveys  of  available  floor  space)  are \nunavailable, especially for longer-term forecasting; \nEconometric Regression: When class consumption patterns are not attributed to \nclearly  identifiable  relationships  (e.g.,  appliance  usage,  floor  space,  sector \nenergy intensity), econometric regression is used to define the relationship. The \nmethod  is  particularly  applied  to  small  business,  and  to  other  classes  in  which \nusers have widely diverse consumption characteristics; and \nPeak  Demand  Model:  The  TLFS  has  developed  substantial  load  research  data \nby customer group over recent years through extensive surveys, and applies this \ninformation  to  project  demand  from  energy  forecasts  developed  using  the \nforegoing methods. The number of customers within each class is forecast based \non regression analysis, and daily load curves derived from the load research data \nare  used  to  forecast  coincident  and  non-coincident  peak  for  each  customer \ngroup. Peak losses are also forecast via regression equations for each customer \nclass.  \n\n \n5. \nGrowth  in  electricity  demand  is  highly  correlated  to  medium  and  long-term  economic \ngrowth  prospects.  The  TLFS  relies  on  the  economic  forecasts  of  the  Government  of  Thailand \n(GOT)  as  prepared  by  the  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Board  (NESDB).  \nNESDB  typically  forecasts  national  GDP  only  for  five  years,  so  TLFS  has  employed  TDRI  to \nproject longer-term economic growth and to disaggregate the national GDP forecast by region \nand by business sector. \n\nTable  SAF.1  summarizes  Thailand\u2019s  most  recent  \u201cMedium  Economic  Growth\u201d  (MEG) \n6. \nload forecasts, as prepared by the TLFS for national power sector planning. The first was used \nin EGAT\u2019s 2003 Power Development Plan (PDP), and the second is used in EGAT\u2019s PDP 2004. \nThe earlier forecast assumed near-term (5-year) annual economic growth averaging 4.7%, while \nthe  more  recent  forecast  assumed  growth  averaging  6.5%,  reflecting  more  recent  economic \noutlooks.  This  forecast  predicts  the  annual  growth  rate  of  demand  for  the  period  2003-10  to \nincrease from 6.5% to 7.1%, a total increase of 1,700 megawatts (MW) over the earlier forecast. \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n3\n\nHowever, the economic analysis of the NT2 Project uses a conservative approach by adopting \nthe lower demand forecast as the base case for least-cost expansion planning.3  \n \n\nTable SAF.1: Load Forecasts for Thailand \n \n\nNet \nGeneration \nGWh \n\nLoad Maximum Reserve\nFactor Demand  Margin \nMW \n\n% \n\n% \n\nAverage Annual \nAdditions \n\nMW \n\nGWh \n\n  \nSource \n  \n\n  \nYear \n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2003       114,754  \n2005       130,232  \n2010       178,079  \n2015       236,364  \n\n \nThai PDPa \n(FY 2003) \n \n \n \nThai PDPb \n(FY 2004 ) \n \n \nSources: \na  Thailand Load Forecast Subcommittee, August 2002. \nb  Thailand Load Forecast Subcommittee, January 2004. \n \n\n2003       116,743  \n2005       136,784  \n2010       193,530  \n2015       265,788  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n73%        17,843  35% \n73%        20,295  25% \n73%        27,711  17% \n73%        36,754  15% \n\n \n\n \n74%        18,121 \n74%        21,143 \n75%        29,308 \n75%        40,478 \n\n(n/a) \n(n/a) \n(n/a) \n(n/a) \n\n \n \n \n \n        1,226          7,739 \n        1,483          9,569 \n        1,809         11,657 \n \n \n \n \n        1,511         10,020 \n        1,633         11,349 \n        2,234         14,452 \n\n7. \nThailand has had considerable excess capacity since the Asian economic crisis of 1997, \nbut economic recovery is expected to rapidly absorb this excess. Average capacity increases on \nthe order of 1,500 MW and 9,500 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year are required from 2005-2010. \nThus, despite its substantial capacity, the NT2 Project will supply less than seven months of a \nsingle year\u2019s additional generation requirements. The TLFS forecasts through 2016 incorporate \na demand reduction of 928 MW as a result of demand side management (DSM), and the more \nrecent forecast incorporates a national target for peak-shaving of 500 MW per year from 2006. \nDSM  programs  are  implemented  by  diverse  public  agencies  and  many  programs  are  behind \nschedule. \n\n2. \n\nLeast Cost Expansion \n\n8. \nThailand\u2019s  domestic  natural  resources  for  power  generation  include  natural  gas,  lignite \nand hydropower. The current electricity capacity consists of combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) \n(71%), thermal (lignite and oil, 19%), hydropower (9%) and other smaller sources (1%). EGAT \nhas  historically  supplemented  these  resources  with  imported  oil.  It  is  likely  that  Thailand  will \ncontinue  to  rely  on  natural  gas  as  a  major  fuel  source  as  it  is  environmentally  friendly  and \nprovides  an  efficient  source  of  power  generation.  However,  continued  reliance  on  natural  gas \nwill require further investment in the gas pipeline network and imports from its neighbors. Heavy \nreliance on one fuel source may also cause undesirable price fluctuations. Thailand is therefore \nkeen  to  diversify  its  fuel  sources,  including  domestic  coal-fired  coal  plants  and  hydropower \nimports from Lao PDR and Myanmar.   \n\n                                                           \n3  The TLFS did not prepare separate \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d load forecasts in August 2002. However, the World Bank least-\ncost planning evaluation tested a wide forecasting range. Specifically, the low and high case forecasts were set to \na  growth  rate  such  that  capacity  and  energy  requirements  ten-years  forward  (FY2012)  were  \u00b125%  of  the  Base \nCase requirements; the constant annual growth rates implied by this assumption were applied to all forecast years. \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n4\n\nEGAT  annually  prepares  a  Power  Development  Plan  (PDP)  for  least-cost  system \n9. \nexpansion.  PDP 20044 proposes a total capacity increase of more than 22,400 MW from 2004 \nthrough  2015  to  meet  forecast  demand  growth  and  planned  retirements  (475  MW).    This \nincrease is to be met by a combination of committed expansions (the NT2 Project, both coal and \ngas-fired IPPs, EGAT-constructed CCGTs, plant re-powering to extend the life of units beyond \ntheir scheduled retirement date) and as yet uncommitted capacity additions.  Current analyses \nsuggest that CCGT plant is the least-cost alternative for future capacity, however, in recognition \nof the fact that fuel price volatility and other unforeseen factors might affect this conclusion, PDP \n2004  refers  to  these  new  additions  as  \u201cnew  capacity\u201d  rather  than  specifying  them  as  CCGT \nunits.    PDP  2004  also  incorporates  a  500  MW  Peak  Cut  policy  from  2006  to  reduce  peak \ndemand,  and  a  Renewable  Portfolio  Standard  (RPS)  requiring  new  renewable  capacity  (i.e., \nbiomass,  wind,  solar,  and  small-scale  hydro)  equivalent  to  at  least  5  percent  of  all  new  fossil-\nfired capacity from 2011.  \n\n10. \nAs  part  of  due  diligence  for  the  NT2  Project,  the  World  Bank  and  EGAT  used  the \nPROSCREEN expansion planning model to conduct an expansion planning evaluation with the \nNT2 Project as a candidate competing for a place in the expansion plan along with a range of \nfossil-based  alternatives  (e.g.,  oil-fired  steam,  coal-fired  steam,  gas-fired  combined  cycle,  gas \nturbines, and reconditioned thermal units otherwise scheduled for retirement).5 The investment \nperiod  analyzed  included  2004-2014.    Without  the  NT2  Project,  in  Thailand,  CCGT  capacity \nwould be the next best alternative source of power supply. 6  \n\n11. \nThe  base  case  for  the  analysis  was  characterized  by  (i)  Thailand\u2019s  official  base  case \nload forecast of August 2002, augmented by a Lao PDR domestic load of 75 MW and 300 GWh; \n(ii) a reserve margin of 15%; (iii) the existing system, \u201ccommitted plant\u201d additions, and schedule \nfor plant retirements as agreed with EGAT; (iv)  the NT2 Project and all other plants, including \nplants  proposed  for  reconditioning  and  all  generic  expansion  options,  modeled  as  candidates \nthat must compete for a place in the least cost expansion plan. The NT2 Project was assumed \nto  be  available  as  a  candidate  from  fiscal  year  (FY)  2010  (November  2009).The  analysis  was \nundertaken  for  the  investment  period  FY2004-2014.  Financial  costs  were  converted  to \neconomic values by excluding taxes, duties, sunk costs and contingencies (but were not subject \nto  shadow  pricing).  A  discount  factor  of  10%  was  applied.  The  base  case  analysis  concluded \nthat  the  NT2  Project  should  be  included  in  the  least  cost  generation  expansion  plan.  The \naccumulated  present  value  of  real  resource  savings  over  the  entire  study  period  amounts  to \n$277 million at 2003 prices against the CCGT option. \n \nA cost-risk framework was employed to determine whether the NT2 Project investment \n12. \ndecision would be justified taking into account the probability of outcomes for uncertain factors, \nincluding  demand  growth  in  Thailand,  the  NT2  Project  costs  and  the  price  of  natural  gas. \nProbabilities  were  assigned  to  base,  high  and  low  case  assumptions  for  each  of  these \nuncertainties.  The  base  case  assumptions  were  assigned a  probability  of  50%  in  the  cost-risk \nmatrix,  with  the  high  and  low  assumption  values  assigned  a  probability  of  25%  each  (Table \nSAF.  2).    The  difference  between  the  probability-weighted  present  value  cost  of  implementing \nthe NT2 Project in November 2010 (the \u201cwith project\u201d case) versus not implementing it at all (the \n\u201cwithout  project\u201d  case)  was  the  decision  criteria  for  this  analysis.

It \n13. \nconsists of four grids, none of which are interconnected. Demand is characterized by relatively \nlow  per  capita  consumption  and  a  low  electrification  rate  compared  to  other  countries  in  the \nregion.  The  current  electricity  consumption  is  estimated  at  211  kWh/capita  per  year  and  the \nhousehold electrification rate is about 40%. Historically, domestic consumption has been small \nin  relation  to  total  production  and  exports.  However,  this  situation  has  changed  over  the  past \ndecade (Table SAF. 3). Imports have increased as a share of total domestic production, and the \nshare of exports has declined. Domestic consumption account for more than two-thirds of total \ndomestic  production.  In  2003,  electricity  exports  (in  GWh)  were  less  than  half  the  level  of \ndomestic  consumption.  The  NT2  Project  would  increase  Lao  exports  by  at  least  5,354  GWh \nannually, and generate an additional 200-300 GWh for domestic use.  \n \n\nTable SAF. 3:  Historical Trends in Lao PDR Electricity Supply \n\n \n  \n\n  \n \n\n \n\nYear \n\n1995 \n2000 \n2003 \n\nGWh \n\n% sharea \n\nGWh  % sharea GWh\n\n% sharea \n\nDomestic \nProduction \nGWh \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nImports \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n1,085 \n1,578 \n1,317 \n \n2.5% \n\n77 \n163 \n238 \n \n15.2% \n\n7% \n10% \n18% \n \n \n\n \nExports \n  \n\n \nDomestic \nConsumption \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n676 \n863 \n452 \n \n-4.9% \n\n62% \n55% \n34% \n \n \n\n338 \n649 \n906 \n \n13.1%\n\n31% \n41% \n69% \n \n \n\n1995-03 \na% of total domestic consumption \nGWh = gigawatt-hours. \nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Laos, Power Development Plan 2004. \n \n \n                                                           \n7  This analysis assumed the World Bank\u2019s practice of applying a 10% discount rate.  \n8  These  gas  prices  seem  very  low  from  the  perspective  of  late  2004;  if  NT2  is  economically  viable  under  an \nassumption of low natural gas prices, it is certain to be even more viable when higher gas prices are assumed.  \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n6\n\nTable SAF. 4 summarizes the two most recent forecasts prepared for the entire country. \n14. \nThe first was prepared as part of EdL\u2019s 2004 Power Development Plan (PDP), and the second \nas  part  of  the  recently  completed  Power  System  Development  Plan  (PSDP).9  The  PDP  2004 \nforecast  was  formulated  based  on  the  GOL\u2019s  target  of  electrifying  90%  of  all  households  by \n2020 and assumed economic growth ranging from 5 to 6.5% annually.

The  CR2  grid  is  currently  small,  but  is  expected  to  grow  rapidly. \nIndustrial, mining, and agricultural developments are driving this growth. Notable among these \ndemands are: \n\n(i) \n\nThe Xepon gold and copper mining development which is expected to have a peak \ndemand of 35-40 MW. (Lang Xang Mineral, the developer, is already constructing a \n115kV single-circuit link to Thailand in order to obtain power prior to the availability of \nthe NT2 Project);  \n\n                                                           \n10  The Study on Master Plan of Transmission line and Substations in Lao PDR \u2013 Final Report, Nippon Koei Co., Ltd., \nTokyo Electric Power Company, September 2002. The study is funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JBIC). \n\n11 See, The Study on Master  Plan  of Transmission Line and  Substation System  in Lao PDR \u2013 Final Report, Japan \n\nInternational Cooperation Agency, September 2002. \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n8\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ntwo towns which now get their power from Thailand, Thakek and Savannahkhet, are \nexpected to have a load on the order of 50 MW by the time the NT2 Project capacity \nbecomes available;  \n\ngrid  extension,  including  under  existing  World  Bank  funding,  Southern  Province \nRural Electrification 2 (SPRE2); and \n\ninterconnection  and  extension  of  the  CR1  grid  under  the  Power  Transmission  and \nDistribution  Project  (co-financed  by  ADB,  and  the  Nordic  Development  Fund),  with \nadditional  links  from  Luang  Prabang  to  Oudomxai  and  Luang  Nam  Tha  in  the \nnorthern region by 2007. \n\nThe  Xepon  gold  and  copper  mine,  the  two  towns  in  CR1,  and  the  planned \n18. \ninterconnection and grid extension are projected to more than absorb the Lao PDR off-take from \nthe  NT2  Project.    In  fact,  the  anticipated  demand  growth  on  the  CR2  grid,  coupled  with  the \nplanned  CR1  interconnection,  suggest  (with  the  benefit  of  hindsight)  that  Lao  PDR  might  be \nable to absorb even more than the share of the NT2 Project output that was allotted at the time \nthe  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  was  negotiated  with  NTPC.    No  forecast  is  certain, \nhowever, and actual demand may be higher or lower than currently forecast.  As both investor \nand power  purchaser, Lao PDR appears to have  made a prudent commitment,  with very high \nprobability that contracted deliveries will be fully utilized.  The PSDP makes the point that, under \npresent pricing for power trades between EGAT and Lao PDR, the least-cost strategy is to add \ncapacity only when it can be fully absorbed by the system, balancing any temporary deficit with \nimports from Thailand.  The alternative is to add capacity before the system goes into deficit, but \nthe surplus that exists while demand absorbs the increment can only be sold to EGAT as non-\nfirm energy attracting a relatively low price.  \n\nb. \n\nLeast Cost Planning \n\n19. \nThe main power sources currently supplying the CR2 grid are purchases from Thailand \nand domestic off-take from the Theun Hinboun hydro project (210 MW, of which the Lao PDR \nallocation  is  5%).    Thus,  the  CR2  grid  remains largely  served  by  power  supply  from  Thailand.  \nLao  PDR  is  committed  to  an  annual  purchase  of  200GWh  of  the  NT2  Project  energy  (on \naverage, over the project life),12 but has the option to buy up to 300GWh per year.13 \n \n20. \naddressing the two national objectives for the power sector: \n \n\nThe  PSDP  was  commissioned  to  provide  a  strategic  plan  for  the  period  2005  \u2013  2020 \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nto provide a reliable and affordable domestic power supply, and \nto earn foreign exchange from electricity exports. \n\n \n\n                                                           \n12  The  project  developer  is  conservatively  assuming  initial  Lao  purchases  of  only  160  GWh  in  the  first  year  of \n\noperation, rising to 200 GWh/year by 2013. \n\n13 This option has created some confusion in  comparing  analyses. The World Bank  has assumed that EdL off-take \nwill be 300 GWh per year; EdL assumes 275 GWh (perhaps net of losses); the developer assumes only 200 GWh \nper year for purposes of financial planning. \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n9\n\nTable SAF.6:  Load Forecasts for the NT2 Project Area \n \nCentral 2 Region (Khammouane and Savannakhet Provinces) \n\nYear \n\nEnergy \nConsump. \nGWh \n \n\nLoad Maximum Average Annual\nFactor Demand\n\nEnergy Consumption \n\nAdditions  Per Capita  Pop \nMW  GWh kWh/yr  Million \n\nElect.

These  candidates  included  projects  with \npotential  for  (i)  providing  export  earnings  and/or  (ii)  meeting  domestic  power  needs.  Each \nproject was evaluated on a standalone basis, and (when appropriate) in conjunctive operation \nwith other projects in the following process: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nProjects  were  initially  evaluated  solely  on  a  technical  basis,  and  compared  on  the \nbasis  of  specific  generation  cost.    For  hydro  projects,  weighted  average  cost  of \ngeneration was calculated assuming a value of secondary energy at half the rate for \nprimary  energy.      Optimal  hydro  project  configurations  were  developed  using  a \nproprietary  project  dimensioning  and  evaluation  program  (\u201cEVALS\u201d),15  which \nevaluated alternative dam heights and installed capacity factors (ICF)16 according to \nassumptions  about  the  project  and  its  circumstances.  The  program  dimensioned \nproject  elements,  simulated  and  optimized  reservoir  operation,  estimated  costs  of \nconstruction  and  operation,  and  calculated  key  outputs  including  capital  cost,  firm \nand non-firm energy, and the cost of energy production.  Costs for the NT2 Project \nwere  developed  by  EVALS  (i.e.,  rather  than  being  based  the  PPA  tariff);  however \nproject configuration was based on the design as contractually committed.    \n\nShortlisted  projects  were  evaluated  in  more  detail.17    Project  cash  flows  were \nadjusted  to  incorporate  the  monetary  value  of  social  and  environmental  impacts  as \nmeasured via a proprietary spreadsheet model (\u201cSESAMEE\u201d).18 The model ultimately \nreduces  project  impacts  \u2013  resulting  from  construction  sites,  transmission  lines, \naccess roads, reservoir and catchment areas, and downstream rivers, etc. \u2013 to cash \nflows,  providing  estimates  of  dollar  costs  and  benefits  for  each  year  of  project \nconstruction and operation. SESAMEE produced both a global project ranking based \non  global  standards  and  market  values,  and  a  local  project  ranking  based  on  local \nstandards and market values.19 \n\n                                                           \n14 The two most important studies were: Hydropower Development Strategy Study, Worley \u2013 Lahmeyer, World Bank \n(2000);  and  Power  Sector  Strategy  Study,  Electrowatt  \u2013  PA  Consulting,  ADB  TA  3374-LAO  (2002).    Main \ndifferences between the studies involved basic assumptions and parameters.  The latter study assumed that partial \nrisk  guarantees  and  concessional  finance  for  Lao  PDR  equity  investments  would  be  widely  available,  and  that \ndomestic off-takes from export projects would form an integral part of domestic generation expansion; the former \nstudy did not make these assumptions, although it did recommend an NT2 off-take of 75 MW.   \n\n15 The EVALS program was developed by Lahmeyer GmbH. \n16 Installed capacity factor  is the ratio  of the  hydraulic  capacity of the power conduits and turbines to the long-term \n\nmean flow of the river. \n\n17 The two thermal plants evaluated \u2013 Hongsa Lignite (1400 MW) and Viengphouka (50 MW) were found not to be \neconomic  when  compared  with  hydro  alternatives  and  with  EGAT\u2019s  avoided  cost.    They  were  therefore  not \nshortlisted  for  subsequent  consideration  in  least-cost  planning.    (The  SCOPE  program  developed  by  Lahmeyer \nGmbH was use for this analysis.) \n\n18  The  Social  and  Environmental  Screening  and  Analysis  Model  for  Economic  Evaluation  (\u201cSESAMEE\u201d)  was \ndeveloped by RMR Consultants. The model requires large amounts of data to quantify the impacts of hydropower \nprojects  at  an  appropriate  level  of  detail,  incorporating  up  to  2,175  project-specific  parameters.  The  PSDP \nconsultants  hasten  to  add  that  the  results  produced  by  SESAMEE  are  sensitive  to  the  quality  of  input  data,  and \ncaution that it is \u201cnot yet a tool which could be supported outside a research setting.\u201d \n\n19 \u201cGlobal\u201d standards and market values are defined those currently used in the developed countries, whereas \u201cLocal\u201d \nstandards and market values are defined as those that are used in Lao PDR or other LDCs.  The PSDP suggests \nthat the local valuations might reflect the order of projects where no outside funding is required, whereas the global \nranking shows the order of projects if multilateral guarantees or loans are required.  \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n11\n\n(iii) \n\nFinally,  the  EVALS  technical  evaluations  were  combined  with  the  SESAMEE \nevaluations  of  social  and  environmental  impacts  to  provide  an  overall  comparative \nmeasure  of  each  project\u2019s  comparative  ranking.  Projects  are  ranked  according  to \ntheir  relative  economic  performance  as  adjusted  for  their  global  social  and \nenvironmental impacts.20 \n\n22. \nFor both the technical and social/environmental analyses, financial costs were converted \nto  economic  values  by  excluding  taxes,  royalties,  and  duties  (but  were  not  subject  to  shadow \npricing). Price levels of mid-2003 were assumed; a discount factor of 10% was applied.    \n\n23. \nTable SAF.  7 reports the combined project ranking outcomes of the process. The NT2 \nProject ranked first among all candidates evaluated, with an expected generation cost of 0.016 \n$/kWh,  about  two-thirds  of  the  cost  of  the  next  ranking  project  (a  105  MW  unit  extension  to \nTheun  Hinboun).  While  PSDP  identified  other  smaller  sites  that  could  be  developed  to  meet \nlocal load, the evaluation concluded that they were not cost-effective when compared with the \nNT2 Project.  \n\nTable SAF.7: PSDP Hydropower Project Ranking \n\n  \nRank \n  \n\n  \nProject \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n    Project Type \n  \n\n  \n\nInstalled Annual \nCapacity  Output \nGWh \n\nMW \n\nWeighted \nCosta \n$/kWh \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n\nAugust 2004. \n\n1,074 \n105 \n30 \n125 \n250 \n\n5,922 \n686 \n214 \n603 \n1,369 \n\n \n \nNam Theun 2 \nStorage / transfer \nTheun Hinboun Extn.

The \nstudy period for this analysis was 15 years (2005-2020), using 2003 as a base year.  As already \nnoted, economic costs (exclusive of taxes, duties, and financing) were used, but shadow pricing \nwas not; a 10% discount rate was used.  The analysis included consideration of environmental \n\n                                                           \n20 It should also be noted that projects were ranked according to a common ICF of 1.75 to ensure fair comparisons; \nthis  value  is  roughly  equivalent  to  a  plant  factor  of  57%,  typical  of  normal  hydropower  plant  factors  and  roughly \nequal to current EGAT PPA requirements. \n\n21  Lahmeyer  GmbH\u2019s  System  Expansion  Simulation  (\u201cSEXSI\u201d)  optimization  program  takes  seasonal  and  annual \n\nvariability of water flows into account in developing recommended scenarios. \n\n22 While least cost was the sole objective function, the PSDP notes a close correspondence between the least-cost \nresults and other important considerations \u2013 larger projects to exploit economies of scale, minimizing EdL capital \nrequirements, minimizing social and environmental impacts, and scheduling to avoid institutional overload.   \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n12\n\nand  social  costs  (including  resettlement),  since  the  combined  EVALS  and  SESAMEE  results \nwere the basis for the SEXSI least cost evaluation.23   \n\n25. \nThis least-cost analysis concluded that the optimal domestic expansion plan for serving \nthe  interconnected  Central  Grid  includes  increasing  imports  from  Thailand  until  2008, \npurchasing  the  off-take  of  Theun  Hinboun  Extension  from  2008  and  of  the  NT2  Project  from \n2010.24   \n\nThe PSDP also recommended base case and optimistic export development scenarios \n26. \nfor  Lao  PDR.    The  decision  criteria  for  project  selection  were  financial.    While  Lao  PDR  must \nselect candidates based on economic criteria (as previously discussed, the report notes that the \ncountry is a price taker in its main export markets, and thus export projects will only proceed if \nthey can be financed at a tariff reflecting the purchaser\u2019s avoided cost.  Using this criterion, the \nNT2 Project is included in both export development scenarios.  \n\nD. \n\nValuation of Project Costs and Benefits \n\na. \n\nProject Costs \n\n27. \nThe costs used for the economic evaluation of the NT2 Project, including development \nand pre-operating expense, construction costs, and operations and maintenance expenses, are \nbased  on  the  sponsor\u2019s  financial  model  and  documentation,  as  developed  by  NTPC  and  its \nfinancial advisors.25 Costs for the NT2 Project dedicated transmission line in Thailand, which is \nnot funded by NTPC, were developed by the World Bank and EGAT. The transmission line will \nbe funded by EGAT.26 Project costs, shown in Table SAF.8, include $48.8 million for social and \nenvironmental capital investment as per the Concession Agreement between NTPC and GOL.27 \n\n \n\n                                                           \n23 The least cost plan considered diesel generation alternatives where appropriate; off-grid electrification programs in \nLao PDR are using micro-hydro and diesel solutions for mini-grids, as well as solar and pico hydro for household \ngeneration,  but  these  programs  are  not  a  primary  emphasis  of  PSDP  since  the  programs  are  not  under  the \nauspices of EdL. \n\n24  Noting  the  inherent  uncertainty  of  large  IPP  projects,  the  PSDP  also  developed  a  contingency  \u201cfirm  fall-back \nstrategy\u201d in the event of IPP project delays.  However, the NT2 project was considered so far advanced that it was \nincluded  in  both  scenarios.    \u201cTo  leave  it  out  of  the  Central  Grid  Fall-Back  Scenario,\u201d  the  authors  argue,  \u201cwould \ntherefore  detract  from  the  practical  usefulness  of  that  scenario.\u201d    The  fall-back  strategy  for  the  Theun  Hinboun \nExtension export project, involving the development of smaller domestic hydro sites, was estimated to have a cost \npremium of about 6 percent on the total system plan. \n\n25 Modeling assumptions are documented in \u201cModeling Assumptions Data book\u201d (NTPC, April 2004). NTPC financial \nadvisors are Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) and Kasikorn Bank Public Company Limited \n(KBANK). \n\n26  The  transmission  line  costs  were  included  in  the  economic  analysis.  These  costs  were  added  to  the  financial \nanalysis  to  ensure  consistency  between  financial  and  economic  values  with  the  purpose  of  conducting  a \ndistributional analysis. \n\n27  Additionally,  the  construction  cost  budget  also  includes  regulating  dam  designed  primarily  for  protection  of  the \nenvironment and downstream inhabitants; and NTPC preoperating funds are allocated to establish Environmental \nManagement and Resettlement Offices.  \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n13\n\nTable SAF.8:  Project Financial Costs (2005 $ million) \n\nCategory \n \n\n \n\nTotal \n \n\nA.

Annual operating costs, \nincluding environmental and social costs, NTPC administration, the NT2 Project operating costs, \nto  be  an  additional  $16-21  million  annually.29  The \nand  maintenance,  are  estimated \nenvironmental  and  social  costs  include  the  direct  costs  of  environmental  and  social  mitigation \nand  monitoring.  System  losses  are  excluded  from  the  analysis  since  they  are  common  in  the \n\u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d cases; however, losses on the dedicated the NT2 Project transmission line \nare assumed at 1% per year. Costs for operation and maintenance of the transmission line are \nalso included in the analysis; these have been estimated at 1% of the capital expenditure for the \nline plus 2% for the substations and amount to $1.9 million per year.  \n\n29. \nFinancial investment costs are adjusted in the economic analysis to reflect the economic \nresource  cost  of  project  inputs  in  terms  of  domestic  price  numeraire.  Investment  costs  are \nclassified as tradable goods/services, non-tradable goods/services, skilled labor, unskilled labor, \nfuel,  transfer  payments,  contingencies,  or  sunk  costs  and  adjusted  by  the  appropriate \nconversion  factor.  Classification  of  costs  is  based  on  information  provided  by  the  project \ndeveloper engineers (Table SAF. 9). Tradable costs are multiplied by the shadow exchange rate \nfactor (SERF), unskilled labor costs are multiplied by the shadow wage rate factor (SWRF), and \ntransfer  payments,  contingencies,  and  sunk  costs  are  excluded  from  the  analysis.  Separate \nvalues  for  SERF  were  derived  for  Lao  PDR  and  Thailand,  using  a  range  of  assumptions  with \nregard to balanced trade and elasticities. SERF ranged fm 1.01-1.08 for Lao PDR and between \n1.00  and  1.02  for  Thailand.  Ultimately,  a  SERF  of  1.05  was  selected  from  the  derived  values. \nThe SWRF was derived on the basis of an estimate of the average income (cash and non-cash \nincome) in the project area (Kip15,010/day) and an estimate of project wage for unskilled labor \n(Kip21,200/day). This gives an SWRF of 0.71. \n\n                                                           \n28 The  cost  of  the  transmission  line  was  added  to  the  economic  analysis  to  make  the  NT2  case  comparable  to  the \n\nwithout case, CCGT option. \n\n29 Environmental costs include catchment area management, resettlement commitments, monitoring & mitigation, and \na  contingency  for  unanticipated  requirements;  NTPC  operating  costs  include  administration,  insurance,  and  a \nbudget for other direct costs. \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n14\n\nTable SAF.9: Financial Costs Allocated by Type (with conversion factors in bold) \n\nItem \n\nTradable Non-tradable Fgn.Skilled Loc.Skilled Unskilled \n\nFuel \n\nFinancing  Conting.

Benefits  were  classified  as  incremental  and  non-incremental  taking  into \naccount the following considerations: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nProject  sales  to  Thailand  will  go  to  the  national  grid.  The  grid  serves  the  entire \ncountry,  and  Thailand  is  nearly  100%  electrified.  Load  growth  for  all  customer \nsegments  is  characterized  by  incremental  growth  in  consumption  of  existing \ncustomers, new household formation and non-household economic expansion. Thus, \nNT2  sales  to  Thailand  are  assumed  to  be  incremental.  This  represents  97%  of  the \nsales. \n\nThe  electricity  system  in  Lao  PDR  is  comprised  of  four  major  grids,  none  of  which \nare currently interconnected. The Central-2 grid serves the region in which the NT2 \nproject  is  located  (Khammouane  and  Savannakhet  Provinces).  The  primary \ngeneration source for the area is imports from Thailand, both directly to some larger \ncustomers,  and  indirectly  through  sales  to  local  area  grids.  Substitution  (import \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n15\n\nsubstitution) in Lao PDR will replace imports coming from two different sources:  (a) \ndirect  cross-border  sales  to  EdL  for  larger  grid  offtakes  (at  $0.065/kWh),  and  (b) \nsales  by  Thailand\u2019s  Provincial  Electricity  Authority  (PEA)  to  larger  industrial \ncustomers  and  town  grids  at  both  medium  and  low  voltage  levels  (at  $0.073/kWh). \nTherefore,  all  Lao  purchases  from  the  NT2  Project  is  defined  as  non-incremental. \nThis represents the remaining 3% of the sales from the NT2 Project. \n\n31. \nNon-incremental  benefits  of  electricity  are  valued  based  on  the  financial  cost  of  supply \nwithout the project (appropriately converted to economic costs with shadow conversion factors), \nwhereas incremental benefits are valued at an average of the cost of electricity without and with \nthe  project.  The  benefit  for  non-incremental  electricity  is  based  on  the  economic  cost  of \nsubstitutes,  in  this  case  imported  electricity.  Incremental  benefits  are  valued  at  the  average \nwillingness to pay for electricity estimated as the weighted average of the cost of the alternative \nenergy source and the anticipated electricity tariff.   \n\nThe economic evaluation of project benefits is shown in Table SAF.10 To estimate the \n\n32. \ncost of electricity substitutes, the following is considered: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nWithout  the  project,  grid  customers  in  Thailand  would  obtain  substitute  sources  of \nelectricity at the avoided cost of supply. Based on studies carried out by the World \nBank with EGAT, the cost of energy and capacity from a combined cycle gas turbine \n(CCGT)  would  represent  the  avoided  cost  as  being  the  next  best  alternative  to  the \nNT2  Project.  The  calculation  of  the  avoided  cost  of  power  to  Thai  consumers  is \npresented section c below. \n\nLao grid customers would obtain substitute electricity from Thailand, at a price equal \nto or greater than the avoided cost noted above plus the cost of wheeling that power \nto  the  Lao  grid  (current  contractual  arrangements  for  cross-border  sales  assume  a \nwheeling charge of 0.005 $/kWh). Alternatively, customers close to the Thai border \n(e.g., industries and smaller grids serving towns) may obtain substitutes directly from \nPEA. PEA sells directly to these larger customers at its normal rates for medium and \nlarge general service customers. \n\n\fTable SAF.10: Economic Value of Project Output \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Valuation of Non-Incremental Benefits ($/kWh) \n\nSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n16\n\n \n\n \nEnergy Sources  Weight \n\n \n\n \n\nComponents \n\n \n\n \nShareb\n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n  \n \n\n17.7%  Sub-total \n\nNontradable \nUnskilled labor \nFuel \n\nTradable \nNontradable \nUnskilled labor \nFuel \n\nThai avoided cost \u2013 primaryd \n \n \n \n \n82.3%  Sub-total \nThai avoided cost \u2013  secondaryd  Tradable \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWeighted Avg Value of Thai Non-incremental Benefits   \nLao avoided cost \u2013 primaryd \n   (includes wheeling) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPEA Border Sales - MV \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPEA Border Sales - LV \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWeighted Avg Value of Lao PDR Non-incremental Benefits  \n\nTradable \nNontradable \nUnskilled labor \nFuel \nSub-total \nTradable \nNontradable \nUnskilled labor \nFuel \nSub-total \nTradable \nNontradable \nUnskilled labor \nFuel \nSub-total \n\n \n \n \n20% \n\n \n \n \n20% \n\n \n \n60% \n\n \n  \n \n\n \n  \n \n\n \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\nCost \n\nFinancial Conversion  Economic \nFactor \n        1.05  \n        1.00  \n        0.71  \n        0.81  \n  \n        1.05  \n        1.00  \n        0.71  \n        0.81  \n  \n \n        1.05  \n        1.00  \n        0.71  \n        0.81  \n  \n        1.05  \n        1.00  \n        0.71  \n        0.81  \n  \n        1.05  \n        1.00  \n        0.71  \n        0.81  \n  \n \n\nPrice \n      0.036  \n           -    \n           -    \n      0.021  \n      0.057  \n           -    \n           -    \n           -    \n      0.021  \n      0.021  \n      0.050  \n      0.041  \n           -    \n           -    \n      0.021  \n      0.062  \n      0.042  \n           -    \n           -    \n      0.021  \n      0.063  \n      0.046  \n           -    \n           -    \n      0.023  \n      0.069  \n      0.064  \n\n60%      0.034  \n0%           -    \n0%           -    \n40%      0.026  \n      0.060  \n0%           -    \n0%           -    \n0%           -    \n100%      0.026  \n      0.026  \n      0.054  \n64%      0.039  \n0%           -    \n0%           -    \n36%      0.026  \n      0.065  \n64%      0.040  \n0%           -    \n0%           -    \n36%      0.026  \n      0.066  \n64%      0.044  \n0%           -    \n0%           -    \n36%      0.029  \n      0.073  \n      0.067  \n\n \n\nB.

Basic \ncost  and  performance  assumptions  are  presented  in  Table  SAF.11.  Fuel  prices  are  based  on \nrecent  work  prepared  as  part  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  on-going  cost-risk  assessment  of  the  NT2 \nProject  for  the  Thai  power  system.  This  avoided  cost  is  used  to  estimate  project  benefits  for \nThailand in the \u201cwithout project\u201d case. \n\n34. \nFor  Lao  PDR,  project  benefits  are  calculated  based  on  a  weighted  average  cost  of \nimports, with 60% weighting given to the avoided cost in Thailand (with an additional charge for \nwheeling), 20% to the cost of direct imports from PEA at medium voltage (>69 kilovolt [kV]), and \n20% to the cost of direct imports from PEA at lower voltage at the prevailing tariffs. \n \n\nTable SAF.11: Avoided Cost of Thai Power \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvoided Plant \nLife (years)   \nFOR (%) \n \nMaintenance (wks/yr) \nAvailability factor \nHeat rate (Btu/kWh) \n \nCap.Cost ($/kW) \nExpenditure Profile (% by pre-op yr) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nCCGT (700 MW)  \n25\n4.5%\n3 \n0.90  \n7,000  \n\n-4 \n-3 \n-2 \n-1 \n0 \n\n \n \n\n80.97 \n16.80 \n0.002 \n0.0006 \n0.0246 \n\nLevelized Capital.Cost \nFixed O&M ($/kW-yr) \nAssoc.

The discount factor of 12% represents \nthe opportunity cost of capital. The project period of analysis is 30 years, with commissioning in \n2010.  The  project  construction  period  is  4.5  years,  commencing  in  2005.  However,  pre-\ndevelopment costs start in 2004. \n\nAlthough the NT2 Project is a regional project, its economic impact on the region is not \n36. \nidentical to its impact on the sponsoring country.  Hence, the project has been evaluated from \nthe distinct perspectives of the region and of Lao PDR. \n\na. \n\nRegional Perspective  \n\n37. \nFrom the regional perspective, the NT2 Project costs and benefits follow the description \nset forth in the foregoing section.  The project economic cost includes the pre-development and \nconstruction costs for the NT2 Project, plus the cost of the associated transmission line being \nfunded  separately.    Benefits  include  sales  of  energy  to  Thailand  (incremental  sales)  and  Lao \nPDR (non-incremental sales).  \n\nThe  NT2  Project  will  result  in  an  annual  reduction  of  275  GWh  for  the  existing  Theun \n38. \nHinboun  IPP  hydro  project  (THH),  which  shares  the  catchment  area  with  the  NT2  Project.  \nAlthough this cost was known and included in the original planning for THH, it is a real resource \ncost and therefore included as a negative benefit in the project resource statement.    \n\n39. \nThe  NT2  Project  will  reduce  Thai  exports  to  Lao  by  approximately  200-300  GWh  per \nyear, and this might be considered a project benefit, since these resources will be available for \nuse  in  Thailand.    However,  Thailand  will  also  lose  an  equivalent  value  in  export  revenues, \nmeaning that Thailand will gain no economic advantage.30  This benefit has not been included in \nthe resource statement. \n\n40. \nThe resource statement does not include any disbenefits resulting from environmental or \nsocial  costs;  currently  available  information  suggests  that  these  costs  are  incorporated  to  a \nlarge extent into project direct capital and operating costs.  Specifically, a total of $130 million \n(at current market prices) has been allocated to environmental and social programs (including \n$49 million for pre-operations programs, $22 million for loss of future eco-tourism potential, and \n$59  milion  for  annual  operating  costs  related  to  environmental  and  social  programs).  Only  a \nsmall  area  (ca  250  hectares)  of  actively  cultivated  land  is  being  removed  from  agricultural \nproduction, and relocated households are being given replacement land with greater agricultural \npotential.  Evidence to date suggests that the local population may gain from the implementation \nof  the  Project.    Considerable  effort  by  Lao  PDR,  developers,  and  international  funding \ninstitutions  has  been  devoted  to  identifying  and  monetizing  environmental  and  social  costs  as \npart of the project.  All of these costs are included in the project economic resource statement.   \n\nThe average incremental economic cost is estimated at $0.036/kWh. The economic net \n41. \npresent  value  (NPV)  is  estimated  $269  million  or  $0.013/kWh.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR) is 15.9%. The summary of economic analysis is presented in Table SAF.12. \n\n                                                           \n30 Thailand sells energy to Lao PDR on a non-firm basis, with the tariff approximating marginal energy cost plus the \n\ncost of wheeling. \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n19\n\nAs noted above the PSPD devoted considerable resources to quantifying the economic \n42. \nand  social  costs  associated  with  all  of  the  generation  expansion  candidates  in  Lao  PDR, \nincluding the NT2 Project. This analysis estimated the NPV of all social and environmental costs \nassociated  with  the  development  and  operation  of  the  NT2  Project  is  on  the  order  of  $  89.5 \nmillion.    Recalculating  the  Regional  EIRR  assuming  that  these  costs  are  incremental  to  the \ndirect  environmental  and  social  costs  included  as  part  of  the  project  capital  investment,  the \neconomic NPV would be $224 million and the EIRR would be 15.2%     \n\nb. \n\nLao PDR Perspective \n\n43. \nThe  foregoing  analysis,  prepared  from  the  perspective  of  the  sub-region  (Thailand  and \nLao  PDR),  indicates  that  the  NT2  Project  economically  benefits  the  economy  of  the  region.  \nHowever,  the  project  must  also  be  economically  viable  for  Lao  PDR,  since  Lao  PDR  is \nundertaking the investment. \n\nIn  order  to  evaluate  the  project  from  the  Lao  PDR  point  of  view,  the  regional  project \n\n44. \nresource statement has been adjusted as follows: \n\nSales to Thailand are valued at the PPA tariff, appropriately shadow priced, since the \ndirect revenue is the only benefit to Lao PDR; \n\nReduced  sales  from  Theun  Hinboun  are  also  valued  at  the  tariff,  appropriately \nshadow priced (the NT2 tariff has been taken as a proxy);31   \n\nThe  cost  of  the  Thailand  transmission  line  (i.e.,  the  line  within  Thailand  being \nconstructed to connect with the existing network), associated O&M, and associated \nline losses, are removed from the statement, since these costs are not incurred for \nthe project in Lao PDR. \n\n45. \nThe average incremental economic cost is estimated at $0.032/kWh. The economic net \npresent  value  (NPV)  is  estimated  $218  million  or  $0.010/kWh.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR) is 15.5%. The summary of economic analysis is presented in Table SAF.13. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n                                                           \n31  In  the  regional  statement,  these  sales  are  only  valued  at  avoided  energy  cost;  it  is  assumed  that  Thailand  can \n\nreplace the lost energy by operating existing CCGT plant at slightly higher capacity factors.

A five-year reduction in the operating life of \nthe  project  would  reduce  the  EIRR  marginally  to  15.6%.  Conservative  benefits  assumptions \nrepresenting 20% reduction in benefits and a 1-year delay of benefits would reduce the EIRR to \n13.0%  and  14.2%,  respectively.  Adjustments  in  the  assumptions  of  conversion  factors  and \ndiscount rates have only a minor impact on EIRR. None of the risk factors would independently \nundermine  the  conclusion  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  NT2  Project.  However,  if  cost \nincreases if 20% are combined with a 20% reduction in benefits, the EIRR would fall just below \nthe opportunity cost of capital. Furthermore, if this scenario is combined with a 1-year delay of \nbenefits and a 5-year reduction in operating life, the EIRR would fall to 9.1%.  \n\n47. \nA parallel sensitivity analysis of the Lao EIRR was also prepared, as reported in Table \nSAF.15.    The  analysis  showed  results  very  similar  to  the  regional  sensitivity  tests.    Estimated \nEIRR\u2019s reported for each Lao PDR test were from 0.2 to 0.4% lower than the regional results, \nreflecting the lower base case Lao-specific EIRR.  As with the regional investigation, only tests \nconsidering  pessimistic  outcomes  for  combinations  of  variables  produced  an  overall  rate  of \nreturn below the opportunity cost of capital.    \n\n \n\n \n\nTable SAF.14:  Regional Sensitivity Analysis \n\nChange /\nAlt.

Four key risk factors \nwere  identified,  including;  (i)  capital  cost;  (ii)  annual  operating  cost;  (iii)  sales  to  EGAT  during \npeak hours (\u201cPE\u201d sales); and (iv) incremental benefits (which are directly related to the avoided \ncost of power in Thailand. Probability distributions were assigned to each variable as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nCapital  during  the  construction  period,  and  operating  costs  over  the  project  life \nwere allowed to vary randomly from 95% (low) to 110% (high), with an average \nof 100% (i.e., their point-value in the model. This choice can be rationalized on \nthe grounds that fixed price contracts are in place, so that substantial savings are \nnot expected, and contractors are required to share cost overruns. \n\nPE  Sales  to  EGAT  were  allowed  to  vary  based  on  a  triangular  distribution  of \nvalues,  based  on  the  range  of  GWh  generation  estimated  from  hydrologic  data \nfrom the project area (1953-1999). The assumed range is 3667 GWh (low), 4,406 \nGWh (mean), and 4,528 GWh (high).  \n\nThe value of incremental benefits were allowed to vary from 90 to 110% (around \nan  average  of  100%),  reflecting  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  point-values \n\n                                                           \n32  XLSim  is  a  spreadsheet  add-in  program  developed  by  Dr.  Sam  Savage,  Professor  of  Engineering,  Stanford \nUniversity.

Alternative  estimates  of  the  cost  of \nthe avoided cost of power in Thailand move within this range. \n\n49.  The  risk  analysis  was  conducted  based  on  10,000  iterations,  with  the  output  variable \nbeing  the  expected  EIRR.  The  result  of  the  risk  analysis  is  presented  in  Table  SAF.16,  and \nFigure 1 shows the cumulative graph of these results.  For the regional risk analysis, the mean \nEIRR of all simulated combinations was 15.2%, about 0.7% lower than the base case EIRR of \n15.9%.  The values of EIRR range from a maximum of 16.9%, down to a minimum of 13.5%, \nwith all reported values exceeding the opportunity cost of capital. Not surprisingly, the Lao PDR \nrisk  analysis  produced  very  similar,  slightly  lower  results,  paralleling  the  base  case  EIRR  for \nLao PDR.  \n\nTable SAF.16: Risk Analysis: Distribution of EIRR \n\n \n\nExpected EIRR (mean) \n\nStandard deviation \n\nStandard error \n\nMaximum EIRR value \n\nMinimum EIRR value \n\nRegion \n\n15.2% \n\n0.57% \n\n5.7E-05 \n\n16.9% \n\n13.5% \n\nLao PDR \n\n14.9% \n\n0.54% \n\n5.4E-05 \n\n16.5% \n\n13.4% \n\nFigure 1: Risk Analysis: Distribution of EIRR \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ny\nc\nn\ne\nu\nq\ne\nr\nF\n \ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nl\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\n100.00%\n\n90.00%\n\n80.00%\n\n70.00%\n\n60.00%\n\n50.00%\n\n40.00%\n\n30.00%\n\n20.00%\n\n10.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n0.133\n\n0.138\n\n0.143\n\n0.148\n\n0.153\n\n0.158\n\n0.163\n\n0.168\n\nEIRR\n\nMean of EIRR\n\nLaoEIRR\n\nMean of LaoEIRR\n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n25\n\nH. \n\nDistribution of Project Benefits \n\n50. \nThe costs and benefits of the NT2  Project will be shared among different stakeholders \nand  countries.  A  project  may  be  economically  viable  without  necessarily  helping  intended \nrecipients. The assessment of the distribution of project benefits helps to identify who gains and \nwho loses from a project. Since the economic analysis was made from a regional perspective, \nincluding  both  Thailand  and  Lao  PDR,  intra-regional  transfer  payments  such  as  the  export \nrevenue earnings, taxes and royalties for Lao PDR are not included in the economic analysis. \nHowever, these transfers become visible in the distribution analysis.    \n\n51. \nThe costs and benefits of the project, both in financial and economic terms, have been \ndiscounted  using  the  discount  rate  of  12%.  To  make  the  financial  and  economic  analysis \ncomparable,  it  was  necessary  to  account  for  the  cost  of  Thailand  transmission  line  in  the \nfinancial analysis, since this cost is included in the economic analysis of the project.  \n\n52. \nThe primary interest of the distribution analysis is to ensure that Lao PDR receives a fair \nshare of the project benefits, especially considering that 95% of the NT2 Project sales accrue to \nThailand.  Table  SAF.17  shows  the  distribution  analysis  with  Thailand  treated  as  one \nstakeholder  (but  includes  private  company  developers  and  consumers),  and  Lao  PDR \nseparated into three stakeholders, including the GOL/Economy, labor and electricity consumers. \nIn  addition,  the  largest  equity  investor,  EdF  is  also  accounted  for.  Gains  and  losses  (e.g.  the \ndifferences  between  financial  and  economic  costs  and  benefits)  are  assigned  to  each \nstakeholder.  \n\nThe  consumer  surplus,  representing  a  gain  to  consumers  due  to  the  fact  that  project \n53. \nbenefits exceed the tariff, is allocated to Lao and Thai consumers based on the sales shares to \neach  country.  The  economic  valuation  of  tradables  exceeds  its  financial  value  due  to  the \napplication  of  the  SERF.  The  cost  of  the  overvaluation  of  the  exchange  rate  is  borne  by  the \nGOL,  and  represents  a  loss  to  the  economy  as  a  whole  (and  especially  to  importers).  The \nfinancial cost of unskilled labor exceeds its opportunity cost, with the difference reflecting a net \ngain  to  unskilled  labor  participating  in  the  project.  Taxes  and  royalties  paid  to  Lao  PDR \nrepresent a gain for those public goals for which the GOL elects to commit its resources. GOL, \nas a 25% equity shareholder in the NT2 Project, also realizes a financial gain, reflected in the \namount by which financial benefits exceed financial costs.  \n \n54. \nOverall,  the  economic  NPV  exceeds  the  financial  NPV  by  $251  million.  The  greatest \nbeneficiary is the Lao PDR economy with net benefits of about $171 million of which taxes and \nroyalties  to  the  Government  account  for  52%.    Project  investors  will  receive  about  $18  million \n(including the GOL).  The total gains to Thailand amount to $74 million of which consumers in \nThailand  receive  a  net  benefit  amounting  to  $67  million  (after  netting  out  the  cost  of  the \ntransmission  line  and  the  loss  of  THH  energy).    Lao  consumers  also  benefit,  albeit  a  smaller \namount.  However, the conservative estimate of the annual off-take from NT2 to Lao consumers \nrepresents a substantial share, about 7%, of total national energy consumption in 2010. \n\nI. \n\nConclusion \n\n55. \nEconomic  evaluation  of  the  NT2  Project  indicates  that  the  planned  investment  is \neconomically  viable.    The  estimated  economic  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  15.9%  when  analyzed \nfrom the regional perspective while it is 15.5% from the Lao perspective.  Moreover, the project \nremains viable from both points of view when subjected to pessimistic sensitivity tests.  Project \nreturns fall below the opportunity cost of capital (12%) only when a combination of adverse cost \n\n\fand benefit outcomes are assumed.  Finally, project risk assessment confirms that the project \ncan be expected to achieve an economic rate of return above the opportunity cost of capital.       \n\nSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n26\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix F  \n\n27\n\nTable SAF.17: Distribution of Project Effects \n\nConversion\n\nFactors\n\nEconomic\nPresent\nValues\n\nDifference\n(EPV minus\n\nFPV)\n\nGOL/Economy\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF PROJECT EFFECTS\nLao PDR\nThailand\nLabor\n1/\n\nConsumers\n\nExternal\n\nSponsors\n\nBENEFITS\n   Sales Revenue\n   Consumer Surplus\n   Thailand Transmission Line  2/\n   Theun Hinboun - firm energy loss\n   Thai Export Reduction\nTotal Benefits\n\n            \n1.00\n              \n-\n\n          \n          \n\n863.1\n185.1\n\n              \n-\n\n           \n(31.9)\n              \n-\n       \n1,016.3\n\n              \n-\n          \n185.1\n           \n(79.6)\n           \n(31.9)\n              \n-\n            \n73.6\n\n-\n              \n              \n6.4\n\n              \n-\n          \n178.6\n           \n(79.6)\n           \n(31.9)\n              \n-\n\nFinancial\nPresent\nValues\n\n          \n\n863.1\n\n            \n\n79.6\n\n          \n\n942.7\n\n          \n            \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n\n346.9\n20.9\n142.1\n73.0\n35.2\n45.7\n99.1\n\n            \n              \n            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n            \n          \n\n33.6\n2.0\n13.8\n7.1\n3.4\n4.4\n8.6\n89.7\n925.7\n\n           \n\n17.0\n\nCOSTS\n   Capital Investment  2/\n     Tradable Goods\n     Non-tradable Goods\n     Labor - foreign skilled \n     Labor - local skilled\n     Labor - unskilled\n     Fuel\n     Taxes / other\n   O&M\n     Tradable Goods\n     Non-tradable Goods\n     Labor - foreign skilled \n     Labor - local skilled\n     Labor - unskilled\n     Fuel\n     Taxes / other\n   Tax/Royalty Payments\nTotal Costs\n\nNET BENEFITS  2/\n\nGains and Losses\n\n1.05\n            \n1.00\n            \n1.05\n            \n1.00\n            \n0.71\n            \n            \n1.05\n              \n-\n\n1.05\n            \n1.00\n            \n1.05\n            \n1.00\n            \n0.71\n            \n            \n1.05\n              \n-\n              \n-\n\n364.8\n          \n20.9\n            \n149.5\n          \n73.1\n            \n25.0\n            \n            \n48.0\n              \n-\n\n            \n35.3\n              \n2.0\n            \n14.4\n              \n7.1\n              \n2.4\n              \n4.6\n              \n-\n              \n-\n          \n747.3\n\n            \n              \n              \n              \n           \n              \n           \n\n17.9\n0.0\n7.3\n0.1\n(10.2)\n2.4\n(99.1)\n\n              \n             \n              \n             \n             \n              \n             \n           \n         \n\n1.7\n(0.0)\n0.7\n(0.0)\n(1.0)\n0.2\n(8.6)\n(89.7)\n(178.4)\n\n           \n             \n             \n\n(17.9)\n(0.0)\n(7.3)\n\n             \n            \n\n(2.4)\n99.1\n\n             \n              \n             \n\n(1.7)\n0.0\n(0.7)\n\n             \n              \n            \n\n(0.2)\n8.6\n89.7\n\n             \n            \n\n(0.1)\n10.2\n\n              \n              \n\n0.0\n1.0\n\n \na  Thailand beneficiaries, including consumers, GOT, and two project sponsors, have not been separately allocated. \nb  Thailand  transmission  costs  were  not  included  in  project  financial  analysis,  but  are  added  back  as  both  a  benefit  and  cost  for  purposes  of  comparison  with \n\n          \n\n171.6\n\n            \n\n11.1\n\n              \n\n6.4\n\n            \n\n73.6\n\n              \n\n6.4\n\neconomic present values in the distribution analysis. \n\n        \n\n269.0\n\n        \n\n252.0\n\n             \n\n4.3\n\n            \n\n6.4\n\n            \n\n6.4\n\n\fSupplementary Appendix G \n\n \n\nKEY ASSUMPTIONS ON NAM THEUN 2 POWER COMPANY (NTPC) FINANCIAL \nPROJECTIONS  \n\n \n1. \nPrice Basis & Exchange Rates.

Electricity  tariffs  are  fixed  by  the  PPAs  for  each  year  over  the \nagreement  period.  Under  the  EGAT  PPA,  separate  tariffs  have  been  established  for  each \ncategory  of  energy:  (i)  Primary  Energy  (PE),  (ii)  Secondary  Energy  1  (SE1),  and  Secondary \nEnergy 2 (SE2). PE is the energy Nam Theun 2 Power Company (NTPC) delivers between 6 \nam  and  10  pm  from  Monday  to  Saturday  inclusive.  SE1  is  the  energy  NTPC  delivers  at  any \nother time. SE2 is energy dispatched in excess of that allocated to PE and SE1. The initial PE \ntariff  is  set  at  $0.02118  plus  THB0.805  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  in  2009.  With  an  annual \nincrease that averages about 1.4%, the PE tariff in the final year of the concession (2034) will \nbe  $0.02948  plus  THB1.120  per  kWh.  For  SE1  energy,  the  initial  tariff  is  $0.00975  plus \nTHB0.370 per kWh and increases at the same annual rate as for PE so that by 2034, the tariff \nreaches  $0.01358  plus  THB0.516  per  kWh.  SE2  energy  is  priced  at  THB  0.570/kWh  for  all \nyears over the concession period (see Table A3 for complete tariff schedule). \n \n\n\f \n\nSupplementary Appendix G \n\n2 \n\nThe tariffs applicable to sales to EdL differ from those for EGAT.

Operating revenues consist entirely of that derived from the sale \nof electricity under the PPAs. Annual operating revenues are projected as electricity sales in \neach  tariff  group  multiplied  by  the  applicable  tariff  in  each  year  over  the  term  of  the \nConcession  Agreement  (CA).  With  the  tariffs  having  both  a  US  dollar  and  THB  component, \ngiven projected electricity sales, just over 51% of annual operating revenue will be generated \nin US dollar, with the remaining 49% being in THB. This provides a revenue stream in the two \ncurrencies  that  closely  corresponds  to  estimated  US  dollar  and  THB  denominated  debt \nservice. This hedges the NTPC currency exposure. \n \nCapital  Expenditures.  For  the  purposes  of  the  financial  analysis,  the  capital \n7. \nexpenditure or project cost includes only those costs incurred directly by NTPC. Therefore, the \ncosts  to  EGAT  associated  with  the  construction  of  the  transmission  line  and  associated \n\n \n\n\f \n\nSupplementary Appendix G \n\n4 \n\nfacilities  in Thailand  are  excluded.  Capital  expenditures  are  limited  to  the  construction  of  the \nproject  facilities  over  the  2005\u20132009  period.  After  the commencement  of  operations  in  2009, \nno further capital expenditures would be made over the life of the CA. The total capital cost of \nthe project is estimated to be $1,250.0 million. Of this total, development costs are estimated \nto be $74.2 million.  Under the Shareholders Agreement (Clause 4), these development costs \nare  reimbursable  to  shareholders  subject  to  confirmation  by  an  independent  financial  audit. \nLenders  have  stipulated  these  amounts  will  be  converted  into  base  equity  rather  than \nreimbursed. \n \n8. \nCapital Structure. The capital cost of the project is financed by a combination of debt \n(72%)  and  equity  (28%).  NTPC  shareholders  make  equity  injections  totaling  $350.0  million \nover the 2005\u20132009 project construction period (Table A5). That portion of the project cost not \ncovered by equity, presently estimated at $900.0 million, is financed by long-term debt. Equity \nand debt is denominated in a mix of US dollar and THB to match the composition of the two \ncurrencies in project capital costs. The overall capital structure is 63.6% US dollar and 36.4% \nTHB, exactly matching the mix of US dollar and THB capital expenditures required for project \nconstruction. \n \n\nTable SAG.5: Project Capital Structure \n\nUS dollar \n($ million) \n345.2 \n450.0 \n795.2 \n\n \n \nEquity \nDebt \n \n% \nTHB = Thai baht, US = United States. \nSource: Nam Theun 2 Power Company. \n\n63.6% \n\nTotal \n\nTHB \n($ million equivalent)\n4.8 \n450.0 \n454.8 \n\n36.4% \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n350.0 \n900.0 \n1,250.0 \n\n100.0% \n\n% \n \n\n28.0% \n72.0% \n100.0% \n \n\n \n9. \nLong-Term Debt.

Based on existing interest rate and credit conditions, these \nassumed  borrowing  rates  appear  to  be  slightly  high.  The  current  20-year  US  dollar  interest \nrate swap base rate is about 4.80%, which is 45 basis points (bp) lower than that employed in \nthe projections. The projections assume that Thai minimum lending rate (MLR) is 6.25% over \nthe project construction period and 7.50% over the repayment period of the loans.  However, \nthe current rate is only 5.50%\u20135.75%. Furthermore, the margin on the THB debt drawn down \nunder  the  Base  Case  financial  projections  is  assumed  to  be  150\u2013200  bp  which  might  be  as \nmuch  as  100\u2013200  bp  higher  than  could  actually  be  achieved.  However,  the  NTPC \nassumptions  regarding  its  longer  term  borrowing  costs  reflect  the  fact  that  current  interest \nrates in both the US and Thailand are low by historic standards. For example, when expressed \nin real terms, the Thai MLR is presently about 3.5% while the average over the past 15 years \nwas just slightly over 7.0%. Although US dollar LIBOR has increased by over 160 bp over the \npast year, it remains low relative to levels over the past 40 years and the current trend appears \nto  be  toward  further  increases.  Therefore,  the  interest  rates  employed  in  the  financial \nprojections reflect the expectation that rates will move higher.  The interest rate assumptions \nmay also reflect a relatively conservative approach taken by NTPC and its financial advisors in \nestimating borrowing rates.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix G \n\n5\n\nBase\nCost\n\n5.00%\n5.25%\n5.25%\n5.25%\n5.25%\n5.25%\n5.25%\n5.25%\n5.25%\n0.00%\n5.25%\n5.25%\n\n8.00%\n\n5.49\u20135.50% 5.34 - 5.35%\n8.25\u20138.75%\n7.05\u20137.40% 6.93%\u20137.37%\n7.25\u20137.50% 7.40%\u20137.65%\n7.05\u20137.40% 6.93%\u20137.45%\n8.00%\u20138.25%\n8.00%\u20138.25%\n8.75%\n8.00%\n0.00%\n8.00%\n8.00%\n\n8.25%\n8.25%\n8.75%\n8.00%\n0.00%\n8.00%\n8.25%\n\nTable SAG.6: Project Financing Plan\n\nDebt Facility\n\nBase Standby\n\n($ million)1/\nTotal\n\nBase Case Tenor3/\nDrawdown2/\n(years)\n\nBase\nRate4/\n\nBase Rate + Margin5/\n\nPre-Com\n\nPost-Com\n\nIndicative Terms & Conditions\n\n188.0\n  \n    \n41.0\n    \n41.0\n    \n41.0\n    \n41.0\n    \n27.0\n    \n27.0\n    \n22.0\n    \n15.0\n    \n20.0\n15.0\n    \n    \n27.0\n  \n505.0\n\n     \n12.0\n       \n5.0\n       \n5.0\n       \n5.0\n       \n5.0\n       \n3.5\n       \n3.5\n       \n2.5\n       \n-\n       \n-\n       \n-\n       \n3.5\n     \n45.0\n\n     \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n     \n\n200.0\n46.0\n46.0\n46.0\n46.0\n30.5\n30.5\n24.5\n15.0\n20.0\n15.0\n30.5\n550.0\n\n187.2\n            \n40.1\n              \n39.9\n              \n40.4\n              \n40.4\n              \n26.6\n              \n26.6\n              \n              \n21.7\n               \n-\n               \n-\n               \n-\n              \n26.6\n            \n449.6\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n16.5\n16.5\n16.5\n16.5\n16.5\n16.5\n16.5\n15.0\n7.5\n7.5\n7.5\n16.5\n\nCIRR\nSWAP\nSWAP\nSWAP\nSWAP\nSWAP\nSWAP\nSWAP\nLIBOR\nMLR/LIBOR\nLIBOR\nSWAP\n\nUSD Debt:\nECA\nADB\nCBL/ADB PRG\nCBL/WB PRG\nCBL/MIGA\nAFD\nProparco\nThai EXIM\nPPA Deve Security6/\nPPA Sup Security\nCA Securities\nNIB\nTotal USD\n\nTHB Debt1/:\nTHB CBL\nPPA Deve Security\nPPA Sup Security\nTotal THB\n\n  \n450.0\n    \n15.0\n    \n20.0\n  \n485.0\n\n50.0\n     \n       \n-\n       \n-\n     \n50.0\n\n     \n       \n       \n     \n\n500.0\n15.0\n20.0\n535.0\n\n449.6\n            \n               \n-\n               \n-\n            \n449.6\n\n    \n      \n      \n\n15.0\n8.5\n8.5\n\nMLR\nMLR\nMLR\n\n6.25%\u20137.50% 8.00%\u20138.25%\n6.25%\u20137.50%\n6.25%\u20137.50%\n\n9.00%\n6.25%\n\n9.00%\n10.25%\n7.50%\n\nTotal All Debt\n\n  \n990.0\n\n     \n\n95.0\n\n  \n1,085.0\n\n          \n\n899.2\n\nAFD = Agence Francaise de Developpement, CBL/ADB PRG = Commercial bank loans with ADB Political Risk Guarantee, CBL/MIGA = \nCommercial bank loans with MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency) guarantee, CBL/WB PRG = Commercial bank loans with World \nBank (IBRD) Political Risk Guarantee, CIRR = Commercial Interest Reference Rate, ECA = Export Credit Agencies, LIBOR = 6-month London \nInterbank Offered Rate, MLR =  Minimum Lending Rate for THB denominated commercial bank loans, NIB = Nordic Investment Bank, Proparco = \nSociete de Promotion et de Participation pour la Cooperation Economique, SWAP = Swap rate for conversion of US dollar LIBOR based debt to \na fixed rate, THB CBL = Thai Baht denominated commercial bank loans, Thai EXIM = Export - Import Bank of Thailand, WCF = Working Capital \nFacility7/.  \nNotes:\n1/ For THB loans, amounts are expressed in USD equivalent at THB/$ = 40.\n2/ Estimated loan drawdowns under Base Case Scenario financial projections.\n3/ Period from initial drawdown (financial close) to final payment (maturity).\n4/ Floating rate debt is swapped to fixed rate.\n5/ Calculated as base rate plus lending margin, but excluding applicable upfront and commitment fees, guarantee fees, guarantee margins.\n\nPre-Com: Construction pre-completion period.

Under its \nexisting financing plan, the company would also hedge its interest rate exposure on US dollar \ndebt  by  swapping  its  floating  rate  loans  to  a  fixed  rate.  However,  the  plan  presented  in  the \nbase  case  financial  model  does  not  presently  incorporate  any  interest  rate  hedging  on  THB \ndebt. Therefore, under this plan, NTPC is fully exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its \nentire  THB  debt.  This  debt  could  be  converted  to  a  fixed  rate  though  an  interest  rate  swap, \nsimilar to that planned for the US dollar floating rate debt.  However, the size and liquidity of \nthe  THB  interest  rate  swap  market  is  much  more  limited  than  that  for  US  dollar  swaps.  This \nsignificantly  limits  the  maturities  available  and  means  that  costs  are  higher  than  that  for  US \ndollar interest rate swaps.  \n \n11. \nOther Financing Costs. These include upfront and commitment fees; charges related \nto political risk guarantees extended by ADB, the International Development Agency, and the \nMultilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency;  and  risk  premiums  on  export  credit  agency \nfacilities.  These  costs  have  been  estimated  for  the  purposes  of  the  financial  projections  and \nmay also be somewhat high relative to those that could actually be achieved. \n \n12. \nDepreciation. Depreciation expense is calculated on the basis of total capital cost on a \nstraight-line basis over the 25-year operating period of the concession. On this basis, annual \ndepreciation expense is $49.5 million. \n \n13. \nOperating  &  Maintenance  (O&M)  Expenses.  O&M  expenses  are  those  directly \nincurred by NTPC over the 25-year operational period of the concession. NTPC has projected \nthese  costs  on  an  annual  basis  according  to  six  expense  line  items:  (i)  environmental  and \nsocial costs, (ii) NTPC administration costs, (iii) NTPC operator fee, (iv) owner direct cost, (v) \ninsurance, and, (vi) major maintenance. Major maintenance is intended primarily to cover the \ncost  of  two  overhauls  of  each  turbine.  Over  the  concession,  the  total  cost  of  major \nmaintenance  is  estimated  at  $50  million,  expressed  in  constant  prices.    Excluding  major \nmaintenance, average annual O&M expense is estimated at $13.7 million, also expressed in \nconstant prices. O&M costs have been estimated separately in US dollar and THB in constant \nprices  and  converted  to  a  current  price  basis  using  projected  US  and  Thai  consumer  price \nindex.     \n \n14. \nRoyalty & Income Tax.  Both a royalty and income tax are applied by the Government \nof Lao PDR on revenues and profits earned by NTPC. However, under the terms of the CA, \nthese are applied at reduced rates over the initial period of the concession. NTPC is exempt \nfrom  income  tax  over  the  2009\u20132014  period  and  then  pays  the  following  the  rates  over  the \nremainder of the concession; 5.0% between 2015 and 2021, 15.0% between 2022 and 2027, \nand 30.0% between 2028 and 2034. The royalty is applied at 5.2% between 2009 and 2024, \n15.0% between 2025 and 2029, and 30.0% over the remainder of the concession. The royalty \nand tax rates to be applied in each year have been designed specifically for the project on the \nbasis of NTPC\u2019s debt repayment schedule.  For example, the increase in the income tax rate \nfrom 5.0% to 15.0% is not implemented until immediately after all NTPC debt is repaid at the \nend of 2021. \n \n15. \nDebt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).  In order to ensure that NTPC will be able to \nmeet all debt service obligations, a DSRA is to be established and funded from net cash flows, \nafter  all  operating  and  debt  service  obligations  for  the  current  period  have  been  met,  and \nbefore  dividend  payments  to  shareholders.    The  amount  held  in  the  DSRA  is  to  be  equal  to \ntotal debt service obligations due over the upcoming six-month period.   \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix G \n\n7\n\n \n16.  Major  Maintenance  Reserve  Account  (MORA).    The  MORA  is  to  be  established  to \nensure  that  NTPC  is  able  to  cover  the  costs  of  the  two  planned  overhaul  cycles  discussed \nearlier. The MORA is funded from net cash flows after contributions to the DSRA have been \nmet  and  before  dividend  payments.    Allocations  to  the  fund  begin  the  second  full  year  of \nproject operations, 2011, and are estimated to be about $1.6 million per year over the period \nto  2020.  This  would  provide  the  funds  required  for  the  first  year  of  the  first  overhaul  cycle \nbeginning  in  2020.  After  that,  the  amount  required  for  each  year  would  be  allocated  in  the \npreceding 12-month period. \n \n17. \nDividends. After all obligations relating to operational expenses, debt service, royalty \nand  taxes,  working  capital,  and  DSRA/MORA  allocations  have  been  met,  and  subject  a \nminimum  debt  service  coverage  ratio  to  be  agreed  with  the  lenders,  any  remaining  cash  is \npaid out as dividends.  Under the base case projections, dividends begin in the second half of \n2010 and continue through the remainder of the concession. NTPC\u2019s dividend policy is set out \nin  the  Shareholders  Agreement  (Clause  19)  and  reflected  in  identical  wording  in  the \ncompany\u2019s Articles of Association. This states that dividends are to be paid every six months \nand consistent with the policy of maximizing such dividends subject to: (i) payment of all sums \ndue  under \ntransaction  documents  (shareholders  agreement,  concession \nagreement,  EdL/EGAT  power  purchase  agreements,  EGAT  security  documents,  financing \ndocuments,  head  construction  contract,  preliminary  construction  works  contracts,  insurance \npolicies,  operation  and  maintenance  agreements,  project  base  case,  project  coordination \nagreements);  (ii)  adequate  reserves  for  working  capital  or  other  purposes  as  deemed \nappropriate by shareholders; and (iii) the provisions of the financing documents. \n \n18. \nAccounts  Receivable  &  Payables.  Accounts  receivable  consist  entirely  of  the  tariffs \nbilled  to  EGAT  and  EdL  that  have  not  yet  been  paid  to  NTPC.  This  is  assumed  to  be \nequivalent to one month of projected billing in each year over the concession period. Accounts \npayable  consist  of  that  portion  of  operating  and  maintenance  expenses  incurred,  but  not  yet \npaid by NTPC. This is also assumed to be equivalent to one month of such expenses. \n\nthe  project \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary Appendix H \n\n \n\nDETAILED NAM THEUN 2 POWER COMPANY (NTPC) FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS \n\nThe  key  assumptions  employed  in  the  preparation  of  the  financial  projections  are  set \n\n \n1. \nObjectives & Scope.  Financial projections have been prepared for the Nam Theun 2 \nPower Company Limited (NTPC) in order to assess the financial viability and sustainability of \nthe  company  over  the  operating  period  of  the  Concession  Agreement  (CA).  Based  on  the \ncurrent schedule, this would extend from November 2009 to November 2034. The projections \nconsist  of  annual  financial  statements  (income  statement,  cash  flow  statement,  balance \nsheet),  key  performance  indicators,  and  supporting  operating  and  financial  data  for  the \ncompany.  The  methodology  and  scope  of  the  analysis  presented  in  this  supplementary \nappendix is consistent with that prescribed by ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Governance \nand Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank (2002). \n \nThe financial projections are based on those generated by a financial model that was \n2. \nprepared  for  NTPC  by  its  financial  advisors.  The  model  is  intended  to  illustrate  the  financial \nperformance of the company over the entire operating period of the concession under a base \ncase  scenario.  This  base  case  reflects  what  the  project  sponsors  and  its  financial  advisors \ndeem to be a most likely set of outcomes regarding the financial position and performance of \nNTPC. A detailed review of the model indicated that the inputs and assumptions employed in \npreparing the base case projections for NTPC are generally reasonable. \n \n3. \nout in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n4. \nProjected  Financial  Performance.    Under  the  base  case,  NTPC  is  projected  to  be \nprofitable in each year over the operational period of the concession. Over the first five years \nof  operations  (2009\u20132014)  net  income  averages  about  $69  million  per  year  on  average \noperating  revenue  of  $221  million.  Over  this  period,  annual  growth  in  net  income  is  high \nrelative  to  the  remainder  of  the  concession,  averaging  almost  13%  between  2011  and  2014.  \nThis relatively higher rate of growth occurs because interest expense declines significantly as \nthe company repays its debt, while tax and royalty rates remain low. Beyond 2014, net income \nincreases more gradually and is projected to peak at $141 million in 2024. With higher tax and \nroyalty  rates  being  implemented,  net  income  follows  a  gradual  downward  trend  over  the \nremainder of the concession. \n \n5. \nConsistent  with  relatively  stable  net  income  levels,  the  projected  annual  return  on \nequity  (ROE)  is  also  relatively  stable,  particularly  over  the  first  10  years  of  the  concession.  \nThe average ROE over this period is projected to be 17.8% and just slightly lower, 16.4%, over \nthe  first  five  years  of  operations.  While  these  levels  appear  to  be  commercially  acceptable, \nthey indicate only moderate profitability levels given the project risk profile. In comparison, one \nof  the  Thai  independent  power  producers,  Ratchaburi  Electricity  Generating  Holding  Public \nCompany,  has  generated  an  average  ROE  of  20.9%  over  the  past  three  years.  In  the  later \nyears  of  the  concession,  particularly  beginning  around  2029,  NTPC\u2019S  ROE  levels  increase \nsignificantly.  However,  this  occurs  only  because  equity  is  being  entirely  paid  out  to \nshareholders  through  dividends.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  on  shareholder \nequity  provides  a  more  meaningful  measure  of  returns  to shareholders  over  the  entire  life  of \nthe  concession.  The  FIRR  on  equity  over  this  entire  period  is  estimated  to  be  14.2%, \nexpressed in real terms. Again, while this is adequate, it indicates moderate, rather than high \nreturns to shareholders. \n \n6. \nThe return on net fixed assets (ROFA) earned over the concession is also consistent \nwith commercial viability.  Average ROFA over the first 10 years of operation is projected to be \n\n\f \n\nSupplemental Appendix H \n\n2 \n\n14.4%.  Like ROE, the ROFA increases over the concession period, particularly over the last \n5\u20136 years. This occurs because annual depreciation expense reduces net fixed assets to zero \nby  the  end  of  the  concession.  Therefore,  the  asset  base  on  which  ROFA  is  calculated \nbecomes progressively smaller. \n \n7. \nProfitability  and  returns  to  shareholders  are  sensitive  to  financing  costs.  Since  the \nassumptions  employed  in  the  base  case  regarding  financing  costs  may  be  somewhat \nconservative,  there  appears  to  be  some  upside  potential  for  higher  returns  than  projected \nunder this base case. \n \n8. \nAt the completion of construction, the debt-equity ratio is almost 2.6, which reflects the \n72% debt 28% equity project capital structure. By the end of the first year of operations, this \ndeclines to 2.1 and by 2014, the ratio is projected to be only 1.3 as debt is repaid. By the end \nof 2021, the company would be debt-free and remain so over the remainder of the concession.  \nThe  debt  service  coverage  ratio  (DSCR)  illustrates  that  the  company\u2019s  capacity  to  generate \ncash flows sufficient to service debt is well within the range considered satisfactory. In 2010, \nthe first full year of operations, the DSCR is projected to be 1.51. The average DSCR over the \nrepayment period of NTPC\u2019s debt is 1.58.  The minimum DSCR is 1.48, which is considered to \nbe  satisfactory.  This  minimum  DSCR  may  occur  in  a  number  of  years  over  the  concession \nperiod. \n\n \n\n\fRevenue\n\nOperating Expenses\nGuarantee\nFinancing Charges\n\nGross Operating
