Given  this  tremendous \nshortage  of  housing,  substandard  housing  and  slums  are  proliferating.  The  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) was approached by Deutsche Bank, a leading real estate financing bank in India, to \nprovide  financing  for  this  slum  rehabilitation  project.  The  project  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the \nbest  opportunities  for  ADB  to  support  slum  rehabilitation  because  of  its  good  location,  high \ndevelopment impact, and strong sponsor, Kumar Urban Development Limited (KUDL).   \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nPune,  the  second-largest  city  in  Maharashtra,  has  a  population  of  approximately  5.5 \n3. \nmillion people, of which about 32.5% to 40% live in slums.2 It is a growing information technology \nand manufacturing (primarily automobiles) center approximately 170 kilometers east of Mumbai. \nThe city also has an abundance of universities. The project is situated on a prime  piece of real \nestate,  advantageously  located  in  the  Kothrud  area  of  southwest  Pune,  near  the  Pune\u2013Mumbai \nexpressway, airport (within 15 kilometers), information technology centers, and major universities. \nResidential housing  is  in  short  supply  across  the  city  and  in  particular  in  the  Kothrud  area.  The \nproject represents one of a few new developments in Kothrud, which also suffers from a lack of \nretail and office space.  \n\n4. \nThe project covers a site of 76 acres and entails the in-situ rehabilitation of slum dwellings \nand  the  development  of  mixed-use  residential  and  office  and  retail  space,  which  the  sponsor  is \nentitled  to  sell  at  market  prices.  Currently  a  large  number  of  slum  households  are  living  in  sub-\nstandard  conditions  on the  site.  The  sponsor will  construct  (i)  multiple  buildings  to  re-house  the \nslum dwellers, each building with 11 floors of 13 units each, and several commercial spaces for \nsmall  businesses  that  are  operating  in  the  slum  area;  (ii) residential  buildings  with  apartments, \noffice space, and retail space; and (iii) amenities and infrastructure for the use of the re-housed \nslum  dwellers\u2014housing  society  offices,  a  self-employment  center  for  women,  playgrounds, \ndaycare  facilities,  community  and  senior  citizen  recreation  centers,  libraries,  a  primary  and \nsecondary school, and a park.  \n\n5. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  be  constructed  in  7  years,  including  a  4-year  construction \nperiod  for  the  rehabilitation  buildings  that  started  in  2011.  A  phased  approach  is  being  used  to \nmanage  the  construction  and  regulatory  approval  process  and  to  minimize  the  need  for  transit \nhousing.  During  construction,  the  slum  dwellers  will  either be  moved  into  temporary  housing  on \n\n                                                 \n1  Government of India. 2007. 11th Five Year Plan Working Committee. Delhi. \n2  The Times of India. 2011. Congress Keen on Legal Status for Pune Slums. 4 November. \n\n\f2  \n\n \n\nthe  site  or  be  paid  a  monthly  rental  allowance  until  they  are  moved  into  their  new,  permanent \nhousing.  Additionally,  for  eligible  and  ineligible  slum  dwellers  under  the  SRS  (para. 6),  the \ndeveloper  will  pay  a  moving  allowance  before  the  slum  dwellers  vacate  their  homes,  and  when \nthe  slum  dwellers  move  into  their  new  apartments.  The  architect  of  the  commercially  saleable \nportion of the project (the \u201cfree-sale\u201d area) is P.G. Patki Architects Pvt. Ltd., which has designed \nseveral well-known projects in India. \n\n6.  \nThe SRS, regulated by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), is an innovative program \nthat  was  introduced  by  the  state  of  Maharashtra  to  deal  with  rapidly  growing  slums  by \nincentivizing  the  private  sector  to  fund  their  rehabilitation.  Under  the  SRS,  developers  construct \nnew,  free  residential  buildings  on  a  slum  site  and  give  eligible  slum  dwellers  title  to  and  full \nownership of their new apartments. Eligibility is determined by the SRA and is based upon proof \nof existence of the slum structure since 1995 and residence for one year prior to the rehabilitation. \nIn return for the development of the new buildings for the slum dwellers, rights are granted to the \ndevelopers to develop a portion of slum land for commercial development purposes, based on the \nfloor space index determined by the SRA.3 Thus, for every one square foot of new housing that a \ndeveloper provides to a slum dweller, the developer is entitled to 2.5 ft2\u20133 ft2 (depending on slum \ndensity  and  size)  for  the  development  of  a  free-sale  area.  Under  the  SRS,  each  eligible  slum \nhousehold receives ownership of a 269 ft2 apartment with a kitchen, bathroom with toilet, running \nwater,  and  electricity,  which  is  a  vast  improvement  over  current  conditions  in  the  slums. \nOwnership  of  the  apartment  must  be  maintained  for  10 years,  after  which  it  becomes  freely \ntransferable. Slum dwellers who currently have shops are provided space on the lower levels of \nthe new buildings. The size of this space will be equal to their current shops, but cannot exceed \n269 ft2. \n\n7. \nOperation  and  maintenance  of  the  rehabilitation  buildings  is  carried  out  by  the  housing \nsociety,  formed  by  the  apartment  owners,  which  will  outsource  such  work  to  external  parties. 4 \nThe sponsor will deposit a fixed amount per slum household in an escrow account, which is jointly \nmanaged  by  the  SRA  and  the  housing  society.  Interest  earned  from  this  is  expected  to  be \nsufficient to cover such costs. The households pay their own monthly electricity and running-water \ncosts. These costs are expected to be relatively low and, in many cases, are already being borne \nby the households.5  \n\n3. \n\nThe Sponsor \n\n8. \nEstablished in 1993 by Mr. Lalit Kumar Jain, chairman and managing director, the sponsor \nis  a  leading  real  estate development  company  based  in  Pune,.  Mr.  Kumar  and  his  family  jointly \nhold 100% of KUDL. KUDL also has operations in Mumbai and Bangalore. Mr. Jain is well known \nin the real estate industry in Pune and is also the current national president of the Confederation \nof Real Estate Developers Association of India. KUDL has garnered several awards, including a \nlisting in 2009 in the top 10 developers in India by Construction World magazine. KUDL is an ISO \n9001:2000  (for  quality  management  system),  an  ISO  14001:2004  (for  environment)  and  an \nOHSAS-18000 (certification for occupational health and safety assessment series) company.  \n\n                                                 \n3   Commercial  development  rights  can  also  be  in  the  form  of  transferable  development  rights,  which  can  be  used  to \n\nbuild saleable area outside the slum project area. \n\n4   Housing societies are common in India. The title to an entire multi-owner site and building is held by a cooperative \nhousing society  whose shareholders are the individual apartment owners. Ownership of an apartment is passed to \nthe individual apartment owner via shares in each society, which give the owner exclusive rights to use a particular \napartment. Property is sold by transfer of the shares with their appurtenant rights.  \n\n5   The  developer  estimates  that  the  slum  dwellers  currently  spend  Rs500\u2013Rs600  per  month  per  household  for \n\nelectricity, and Rs1,400 annually for water and property taxes. \n\n\fKUDL\u2019s  real  estate  developments  cater  to  a  wide  variety  of  customers  and  can  be \n9. \nsegregated  into  the  following  categories:  residential  (which  comprises  about  80%  of  the \ncompany\u2019s  developments);  integrated  townships;  redevelopment  projects;  slum  rehabilitation; \nspecial  economic  zones;  and  commercial  (office  and  retail)  projects.  KUDL  has  completed  3.5 \nmillion  ft2  of  developable  area  since  2006,  including  14  residential  (of  which  three  are \nredevelopments) and seven commercial projects. Several projects are ongoing in various stages \nacross five cities, including Mumbai, and Kumar\u2019s share of the saleable area totals 38.89 million \nft2  for  residential  and  9.05  million  ft2  for  office and  retail  space.  The  project  is  a  high  priority  for \nKUDL  and  the  developer  is  hopeful  that  it  will  be  a  benchmark  for  future  slum  rehabilitation \nprojects.  \n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n10. \nThe  development  impact  of  the  project  will  be  high.  It  provides  a  sustainable  and \ninnovative  solution  to  the  particularly  challenging  and  intractable  problem  of  rehabilitating  urban \nslums, and concurrently increases housing stock for a growing urban population. Given the high \nnumber of urban slums in Asia, this is a critical issue for ADB. The project will serve to decrease \nthe  number  of  slums  where  a  large  proportion  of  Pune\u2019s  inhabitants  live,  and  increase  private \nsector participation in replacing slums with better housing. The project is one of the larger slum \nrehabilitation  projects  in  Pune  and  KUDL  is  also  a  well\u2013known  developer;  hence,  it  is  expected \nthat  the  success  of  the  project  will  provide  a  template  that  can  be  replicated  by  other  projects. \nFinally, the project will support the development of office and retail space in Pune.  \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n11. \nThe  project's  primary  outcome  will  be  an  improvement  in  the  quality  of  life  for  slum \ndwellers and access to more housing for urban dwellers in Pune. This is an important contribution \nto the lives of these slum dwellers, who will benefit from the provision of sanitation, clean drinking \nwater, and stronger and safer shelter. This is directly supportive of Millennium Development Goal \n7  (ensuring  environmental  sustainability).  For  most  of  these  families;  obtaining  a  title  to  an \napartment  will  most  probably  represent  ownership  of  their  first,  large  valuable  asset.  Gender \nequality  and  empowerment  of  women  is  supported  through  (i) 100%  issuance  of  joint  titles  to \nhusbands  and  wives;  (ii)  100%  issuance  of  titles  to  women  who  head  households;  and  (iii)  a \nrequirement for a minimum of 33% representation of women in the housing society. The project\u2019s \nprovision  of  safe  and  secure  housing,  as  well  as  other  facilities  such  as  playgrounds,  daycare \nfacilities and schools, is especially beneficial for women and children.  \n\n12. \nFor  the  non-slum  urban  dwellers  of  Pune,  the  shortage  of  housing  in  the  city  will  be \npartially  mitigated  through  the  project  by  creating  access  to  housing  for  about  9,000  people  as \nwell as office and retail space. Construction is a large contributor to employment,  particularly in \nthe  form  of  semiskilled  and  unskilled  jobs  for  lower  income  groups.  Skills  and  entrepreneurship \ntraining for women will also be conducted. Increasing the share of women employed in the non-\nagriculture  wage  sector  contributes  directly  to  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  3  (promote \ngender  equality  and  empower  women).  After  construction,  300\u2013500  jobs  will  be  created  as  a \nresult of ongoing retail and other commercial operations in the redeveloped area, of which at least \n20% will be for women.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nThe  outputs  include  construction  of  multiple  rehabilitation  buildings,  providing  new  and \nbetter  housing  facilities  for  current  slum  dwellers;  free-sale  apartments;  retail  space;  and  office \nand retail space. Currently, an average of 150 workers are on-site each day, which will gradually \nincrease to 1,000 workers on-site per day at the peak of construction in 2014\u20132015. The project \nwill also generate substantial employment for unskilled workers during construction (estimated at \n60%\u201370%  of  the  total  construction  jobs).  Moreover,  30%  of  the  total  jobs  for  interior  works  are \ntargeted  for  women.  In  addition,  the  project  will  contribute  to  the  local  economy  through  the \npurchase of local goods and services. Finally, the sponsor will benefit from better environmental \nand social standards through implementation of and adherence to ADB\u2019s social safeguards and \nthe gender action plan.  \n\nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020  \n\n14. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  which  promotes  private  sector \ninvestment  in  the  infrastructure  sector,  as  well  as  an  improvement  in  public  health  standards.6 \nStrategy  2020  also  states  that  ADB  will  continue  to  emphasize  gender  equality  and  the \nempowerment  of  women  as  fundamental  elements  of  achieving  inclusive  growth.  The  project  is \nexpected to yield tangible benefits for women and empower them, e.g., through joint ownership of \napartments  and  job  and  skills  training.  Also,  under  Strategy  2020,  cities  constitute  a  key  focus, \nspecifically in terms of promoting livable cities that are socially inclusive. The project promotes, in \nan inclusive and innovative way, the private sector\u2019s participation in the slum rehabilitation sector.  \nThis is a sector which the government has so far and can be expected to support only to a limited \nextent.    \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Country and Sector Strategy  \n\nThe project is consistent with the country partnership strategy (CPS) 2009\u20132012 for India.7 \n15. \nThe  CPS  aims  to  significantly  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  infrastructure  activities  and  to  encourage \ninnovative  financing.  The  CPS  further  notes  that  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  urban  sector  operations  will \ncombine  infrastructure  development  with  targeted  poverty  reduction  components.  Finally,  the \nproject  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  desire  to  undertake  projects  that  have  targeted  poverty  reduction \ncomponents  and  promote  inclusive  growth.  The  project  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  strategies \nand  plans  for  private  sector  development, 8  poverty  reduction, 9  and  urban  operations. 10  The \npoverty  reduction  strategy  supports  the  need  to  undertake  sustainable  housing  projects \nimplemented by the private sector. ADB\u2019s draft urban operations plan states that ADB\u2019s support \nfor  inclusive  cities  must  include  support  to  slum  upgrading,  housing,  land  tenure,  and \ndevelopment and housing finance.  \n\nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan  \n\n The project will be financed  through sales advances, sponsor equity, and the remaining \n16. \nby  a  combination  of  CCDs  and  debt  from  ADB;  FMO,  (with  participation  from  GuarantCo)  and \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008.

CCDs have been used in the past by \nforeign investors for slum rehabilitation projects, as well as for projects in other sectors. \n\n19. \nThe  issuer  is  expected  to  pay  to  ADB  and  other  CCD  holders  a  fixed  coupon  amount, \npayable quarterly. ADB is expected to have the right to nominate one director for appointment to \nthe board of the issuer. To facilitate exit arrangements, ADB will grant to the sponsor a call option \nunder which it will have an option to buy the CCDs, or on default, for a predetermined amount that \nwould both pay the amount invested by ADB and provide a return on such investment. Should the \nsponsor not exercise the option, the CCDs will automatically convert to shares of the issuer. The \nCCD investors may also force a conversion if the issuer defaults on its CCD obligations.  \n\n20. \nSecurity.  The  OPCD  loan  from  the  issuer  to  the  project  company  will  be  secured  by  a \nmortgage on land and buildings of the project at a minimum collateral value  in relation to the loan \namount.    Additional  collateral  satisfactory  to  the  CCD  holders  will  be  provided  if  the  collateral \nvalue declines below a certain level. The value of the collateral will be reviewed on a semiannual \nbasis by an internationally recognized independent real estate company and valuator. In addition, \nthe OPCD loan will be secured by a guarantee from the sponsor. All proceeds in an enforcement \nscenario  will  be  shared  pari  passu  among  Deutsche  Bank,  the  NCD  holders,  and  the  OPCD \nholders.  In  an  enforcement  situation,  conversion  to  shares  will  thus  give  the  CCD  holders  the \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6  \n\n \n\nability  to  enforce  the  project  company\u2019s  obligations  to  repay  the  issuer\u2019s  OPCD  loan  and,  if \nnecessary, to (i) exercise the security for the OPCD loan and (ii) call on the sponsor guarantee. In \ncertain  circumstances,  control  of  the  issuer  may  also  enable  the  investors  to  recover  their \ninvestments by selling the project company as a whole or by causing it to liquidate. \n\nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n21. \n\nADB\u2019s value addition to the project is expected to be the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFunding for the real estate sector, particularly for slum rehabilitation projects, is not \nreadily  available  from  commercial  banks.  The  project  will  play  a  pioneering  role  in \ndemonstrating  the  commercial  viability  of  slum  rehabilitation  projects  undertaken \nthrough the SRS in India, which may help to catalyze commercial bank financing for \nfuture slum rehabilitation projects.  \n\nADB\u2019s  participation  will  further  strengthen  the  project  through  the  application  of \nADB\u2019s  social  safeguards,  gender  and  development  targets,  and  environmental \nstandards, which are of particular importance.  \n\nC. \n\nRisks \n\n22. \nReal  estate  market  risk.  The  project  is  exposed  to  real  estate  market  risk,  which  is \nsubject to high volatility. The current outlook for the Indian residential real estate market overall \nhas  been  uncertain  and  opinions  have  generally  been  cautious,  particularly  in  areas  that  have \nbeen the subject of speculative bubbles.  Downward movements in the real estate sector could \nhave  a  negative  impact  on  the  success  of  the  project,  as  well  as  the  sponsor\u2019s  ongoing \ndevelopments.    However,  the  real  estate  market  in  Pune  has  been  stable  from  about  2005  to \n2011.    Market  risk  is  mitigated  since  the  project  is  located  in  what  is  considered  a  highly \ndesirable location in Pune, with strong cash flows from the sales of residential space and rental \nof  office  and  retail  space.  Additionally,  the  requirement  that  the  OPCD  loan  maintain  a  certain \ncollateral  cover,  which  will  be  provided  from  non-project  sources  if  needed,  protects  ADB\u2019s \nposition in the event of declines in market value of the project itself. \n\n23.   Project  risk.    The  project\u2019s  cash  flow  is  vulnerable  to  increases  in  construction  costs, \nsales price, construction delays and slowdowns in sales booking rates.  If cash flows fall below \nprojections, the company\u2019s ability to service its debts and complete the project on time may be \nseverely affected.  This risk is partially mitigated by KUDL\u2019s corporate guarantee covering debt \nservice and project completion, a significant amount of sponsor equity to be infused, and sizable \nrevenues  which  accrue  from  year  six  onwards  from  the  sale  of  residential  units  and  rentals  of \nretail space.  \n\n24.   Sponsor  risk.    Sponsor  cash  flows  are  dependent  on  stable  real  estate  market \nconditions  and \ntimely  and  successful  execution  of  ongoing  and  pipeline  real  estate \ndevelopments.  This is also the first time that the sponsor will be engaging in large scale slum \nrehabilitation,  which  raises  some  concerns  on  its  ability  to  undertake  the  project,  including \nresettlement of the slum dwellers.  However, comfort is drawn from the fact that KUDL has over \n40 years  of  experience  in  real  estate  development,  primarily  in  the  Pune  market,  where  the \nproject  is  based,  and  has  successfully  developed  over  10  million  ft2  of  commercial  and \nresidential  areas.  KUDL  is  very  committed  to  the  success  of  the  project,  which  it  aspires  to \nestablish as the benchmark for slum rehabilitation projects in India.   \n\n\fSocial safeguards risk. Resettlement is the main risk and the most important element of \n25. \nany  slum  rehabilitation  project.  Resettlement  will  be  largely  voluntary  since  70%  of  the  slum \nhouseholds  have  given  their  consent,  as  required  by  the  SRS.  Furthermore,  when  eligibility  for \nnew  housing  is  determined  by  the  SRA,  individual  agreements  will  be  signed  with  the  slum \ndwellers. The in-situ resettlement will comply with the rules and regulations of the SRA and any \ninvoluntary  resettlement  will  meet  ADB  safeguard  standards.  Due  diligence  has  confirmed  that \nadequate  social  safeguards  are  in  place,  and  ADB  and  an  external  expert  will  carefully  monitor \nthe project during implementation.  \n\n26. \nRegulation  risk.  The  SRA  approval  process  can  be  lengthy.  As  slum  rehabilitation \ncontinues to grow and develop, it is possible that existing regulations may change. The regulatory \nrisk is mitigated in that the sponsor has already received the significant approvals required for this \nproject.  Progress of further approvals is proceeding satisfactorily and will be monitored. \n\n27. \n Reputational risk. Slum rehabilitation is a complex process with sensitive social issues. If \nimproperly  implemented,  the  project  could  create  reputational  risk  for  ADB  due  to,  for  instance, \ndiscontent  with  the  quality  of  construction,  delays  in  completion  of  the  project,  political \ninterference, allegations of misconduct, mishandling of involuntary resettlement, and fabrication of \neligibility.  Additionally,  the  real  estate  development  and  construction  sectors  generally  pose \nheightened  risks  for  fraud  and  corruption.  These  risks  are  partly  mitigated  by  the  social \nsafeguards that are in place, as noted above, and through oversight of the SRA. ADB will closely \nmonitor these issues throughout the project. \n\n28. \n Corporate  governance  risk.  The  company  is  a  family  business,  as  is  common  in  the \nIndian real estate sector. ADB, as well as its cofinanciers, have done due diligence on this issue \nand this risk is deemed to be acceptable and mitigated to some extent by appropriate corporate \ngovernance  in  the  form  of  formal  board  committees  modeled  on  the  Securities  and  Exchange \nBoard  of  India\u2019s  regulations,  such  as  an  audit  committee,  a  shareholders\u2019  and  investors\u2019 \ngrievance committee, a finance committee, and the presence of independent board members. \n\nA.   \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions  \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n29. \nSafeguards.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment,  category  A  for \ninvoluntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. The potential environmental and \nsocial impacts and risks of the project have been defined in the environmental and social impact \nassessment,  and  effective  measures  to  manage  the  impacts  are  outlined  in  the  environmental \nand social management plan. The sponsor has prepared a rehabilitation action plan to minimize \nthese impacts.  The institutional capacity and commitment of the sponsor to manage the project\u2019s \nsocial and environmental risks are deemed adequate. The sponsor obtained the consent of 70% \nof the slum dwellers in the buildable areas, which, as noted, is a condition to SRA approval. The \nsponsor has a dedicated community relations team to ensure that concerns are heard and dealt \nwith adequately. From 2004 to 2011, at least 12 major consultation activities occurred and nearly \nall slum dwellers in the area participated. Information billboards, a model unit, and an information \ncenter have also been established to increase awareness of the project. \n\n30.  Other  social  dimensions. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming \nbecause it provides security of tenure and housing titles to both men and women slum dwellers. A \ngender action plan has been prepared that includes issuance of joint ownership certificates under \nthe  names  of  wife  and  husband,  and  of  sole  ownership  certificates  to  women  who  head \nhouseholds;  33%  representation  and  active  involvement  of  women  in  the  housing  societies; \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8  \n\n \n\nwomen\u2019s  skills  enhancement  and  livelihood  development  through  self-help  groups  supported by \ncivil society organizations; and recruiting of at least 33% female community liaison officers for the \nsponsor\u2019s  community  relations  team  to  ensure  gender-responsive  community  engagement.  The \nproject  will  also  provide  vital  infrastructure  such  as  daycare  facilities,  a  primary  and  secondary \nschool,  water  and  sanitation,  and  power  connections,  which  will  particularly  benefit  women.  A \nlabor  management  plan  has  been  prepared  to  manage  issues  related  to  migrant  labor  and  to \nensure that KUDL, its contractors, and subcontractors comply with national labor regulations and \nthe internationally accepted core labor standards.  \n\nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n31. \nKUDL  and  KUL  UDPL  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  implementing  best  international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption,  money  laundering,  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance.  \n\nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\n32. \nThe project is within ADB\u2019s approved medium-term, country, industry, and group exposure \nlimits. ADB\u2019s investment is an equity investment for the purposes of Indian law.  ADB ownership \nupon conversion, however, will be subject to limits on control in favor of the other CCD holders \nand other investors. \n\nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with \n\nthe  Agreement  Establishing \n\n33. \nthe \nGovernment  of  India  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nassistance  to  KUL  UDPL.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  assistance  by  the  Board  of \nDirectors. \n\nthe  Asian  Development  Bank, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n34. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  investment  in  compulsory  convertible  debentures  would \ncomply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend \nthat  the  Board  approve  the  investment  in  compulsory  convertible  debentures  issued  by  KUL \nUrban  Development  Private  Limited  of  up  to  the  rupee  equivalent  of  $35,000,000  for  the  Pune \nNirvana Hills Slum Rehabilitation Project in India from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with such \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as \nmay be reported to the Board; and \n\n \n\n04 October 2012 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda  \n\nPresident \n\n\f \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \nReduced slums in \nPune  \n \n \n \n \nIncreased urban \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment in Pune \nOutcome \nIncreased provision \nof better housing and \nbetter quality of life \nfor slum and urban \ndwellers in Pune  \n  \n\nOutputs \n1.
