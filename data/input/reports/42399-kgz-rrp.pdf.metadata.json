The  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1 \n(Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road)  is  an  important  regional  route  linking  the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  to  Central  Asia  and  Europe.  The \nroad  will  be  improved  under  individual  investment  projects.  Project  1 \nwas  approved  in  2008  to  rehabilitate  39  kilometers  (km)  of  the  road. \nThis  submission  is  for  Project  2  (the  Project).  The  Project  has  two \ncomponents\u2014a  physical  and  a  nonphysical  one.  The  physical \ncomponent  will  rehabilitate  75  km  and  construct  a  facility  to  manage \ncross-border  passenger  and  freight  movements  to  and  from  the  PRC. \nThe  cross-border  facility  covers  customs,  immigration,  health  and \nquarantine, security, and other functions. It will be located close to km \n479 (about 60 km inland from the border crossing at Torugart). \n \nThe nonphysical component will help with training and will cater for the \ntransport sector master plan. It includes an industry-university program \nto  improve  the  transport  project  management  skills  of  engineering \ngraduates.  The  program  includes  (i)  up  to  five  summer  internships  at \nthe  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  for  students \nseeking  a  career  in  transport,  and  (ii)  at  least  two  short  courses  in \ntransport engineering and project management.   \n \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  trade  and  improve  national  and  regional \nconnectivity. More than 70% of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s trade is regional\u2014\nwith Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and PRC\u2014and 50% moves by \nroad. However, the corridor is in poor condition and vehicles can travel at \nonly an estimated average speed of 50 km per hour, and are frequently \ninterrupted by snow and rain. Rehabilitating the road will increase speed \nand  reliability  of  passenger  and  freight  flows  and  create  business \nopportunities  in  the  adjacent  area,  one  of  the  poorest  parts  of  the \ncountry. The investment will also cut transport costs. \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome  The  Project\u2019s  primary  impact  will  be  increased  regional  trade, \nparticularly between the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC, which will lead \nto  less  poverty  in  Naryn  oblast  (province).  Its  main  outcomes  will  be \nhigher accessibility and mobility. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $62.5  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $6 million. \n \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n42.5 \n3.0 \n6.0 \n10.0 \n1.0 \n62.5 \n\n% \n\n35.0 \n45.0 \n20.0 \n\nItem \n\nCivil works \nConsulting Services \nDuties and Taxes \nContingencies \nFinance Charges \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTotal \n\n \nFinancing Plan  \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank Grant \nAsian Development Bank Loan \nGovernment \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n22.0 \n28.0 \n12.5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n31 December 2013 \n\nPeriod of Utilization   Until 30 June 2014 \n \nEstimated \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n  62.5 \n\n 100.0 \n\nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nADB will provide a grant not exceeding $22.0 million and a loan of $28 \nmillion equivalent (Special Drawing Rights 18,492,000) from its Special \nFunds resources to finance the Project. The proposed grant and loan \nwill finance 80% of the cost. The Government will provide counterpart \nfinancing  of  $12.5  million  to  cover  taxes  and  duties,  part  of  the  civil \nworks for border infrastructure development. \n \n\n \nMinistry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) \n\nteam  members  are  knowledgeable \n\nThe project implementation unit (PIU) established within MOTC, which \nis  managing  Project  1,  will  oversee  and  manage  the  second  Project. \nMOTC will strengthen the PIU\u2019s current team of 10 professionals within \nthe  next  2 years.  Many \nin \ninternational best practices and ADB polices and procedures. They will \nbe  responsible  for  managing  the  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and \nservices; administering contracts; and project arrangements. No major \nsocial  and  environmental  impacts  have  resulted  from  past  road \nprojects. However, as the road network expands and traffic increases, \nbetter  planning,  designing,  and  monitoring  will  be  needed  to  manage \nimpacts  during  and  after  construction.  MOTC  will  recruit  relevant \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nsafeguard specialists to the PIU. Action plans will be prepared in these \nareas, executed during the Investment Program period (i.e. through a \nseries of projects in support of the corridor). These actions will deliver \nsafeguard and gender mainstreaming content.  \n\n \n\nADB has assigned a team (combining staff from headquarters and the \nKyrgyz  Resident  Mission)  to  manage  this  and  other  ongoing  road \nsector  activities  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  This  team  will  work  with  the \nPIU and review portfolio performance while guiding MOTC on project, \npolicy, maintenance and administration matters. ADB and MOTC have \nprepared  a  project  administration  memorandum  (Supplementary \nAppendix A) to ensure the project is delivered on time and on budget. \nIt  outlines  the  tasks  to  be  performed  by  each  party  to  maintain  the \nexecution schedule, ensure compliance with social and environmental \nsafeguards,  ensure  transparency  and  integrity,  and  report  accurately \nand  on \ntime.  Additionally,  MOTC  will  use  web-based  project \nmanagement  to  allow  better  communication  between  the  field  offices \nand  the  PIU.  This  will  allow  ADB  to  access  information  on  completed \nphysical quantities, disbursements, outstanding payments, contractors\u2019 \nclaims, etc. \n \nMOTC  will  procure  works  and  goods  financed  by  ADB  according  to \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Civil  works  are  packaged  into  two \ncontracts and will be procured through international competitive bidding. \nThe cross-border facility, in the vicinity of km 479, will be included in one \ncivil  work  contract.  The  procurement  activities  in  the  18  months \nbeginning in May 2009 are in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \nConsulting Services  Supervising  civil  works  and,  if  necessary,  reviewing  and  designing \nother  parts  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  will  be  done  by  an \ninternational  firm.  This  firm  will  be  selected  by  MOTC  according  to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  selected  firm  will \ntrain on road construction and maintenance. The firm will be selected \non the basis of full technical proposals evaluated using the quality- and \ncost-based  selection  or  quality-based  selection  method,  or  single \nsource selection method, if appropriate justification can be provided.  \n \nA  private  firm  will  be  engaged  to  perform  a  financial  audit.  It  will  be \nselected  using  the  consultant\u2019s  qualification  selection  method,  or  the \nleast  cost  selection  method.  Services  of  national  and  international \nindividual  consultants  or  international  firms  will  be  used  from  time  to \ntime to assist PIU staff in special circumstances, or to handle complex \nissues,  including  the  master  plan.  The  individuals  will  be  selected \naccording to individual consultant recruitment method, and firms will be \nthe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  quality, \nselected  using \nconsultant\u2019s  qualification  method,  or  the  least  cost  selection  method, \nafter discussing and agreeing with ADB on the terms of reference and \nbudget.   \n \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nThe Project will benefit road users in the form of lower operating costs \nand  travel  time.  The  road  will  increase  economic  activity  (tourism, \nagriculture, and mineral resources development). About 1.5 million tons \nof Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC trade in 2015 is expected to move through the \nBishkek\u2013Torugart road. \n \nThe  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  direct  benefits  of \nimproving the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road is 14.4% and the net present value \nis $49.7 million. The road passes through three oblasts that have poverty \nlevels  above  the  national  average  of  46%.  It  will  give  better  market \naccess  to  the  estimated  2.3  million  people  living  in  the  corridor.  About \n51% of the project impact area population is female, and will benefit from \nthe  improved  access  to  markets  for  their  home  grown  produce  and \nhandicraft.   \n \nThere is a risk that the Project will be implemented late and over budget. \nThere  is  also  a  risk  that  maintenance  will  be  substandard  and \nunderfunded. Counterpart finance is always a concern, aggravated by the \ncurrent global financial crisis. Project execution delays will cut the rate of \nreturn in achieving the expected results. \n \nADB is aware of these risks and is working closely with the Government \non \ninstitutional \neffectiveness. The resident mission and the headquarters teams will join \nup  with  the MOTC  team  to ensure  that  execution schedules  are  kept in \ntouch  and  that  adequate  budget  allocation  are  made  every  year.  The \nlatter will be covenanted in the loan agreement. \n \nADB's dialogue with the Government is effective and constructive. The \nGovernment  agrees  with  the  risk  assumptions  and  implementation \nproposals. It has also tapped other financiers to complete another 150 \nkm by 2015.   \n\nimproving  capabilities,  maintenance \n\nfinancing  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the CAREC Transport Corridor 1 \n(Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project 2 (the Project). The design and monitoring framework for the \nProject is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nGrowth  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  trade  has  been  bolstered  by  improvements  in  the \ntransport system, especially roads. The dominance of the road sector is evident from the modal \nsplit trends in freight and passenger traffic shown in Table 1. Over 90% of the passengers and \nmore than 50% of the freight in the Kyrgyz Republic move by road. Railways carry increasing \namounts of bulk commodities and machinery, but the 320 kilometers (km) of single track within \nthe  country  exist  only  in  the  form  of  several  spurs  from  two  branches\u2014one  from  Kazakhstan \nrailways  (in the  north)  and  the  other  from  Uzbekistan  railways  (in  the southeast). Air  transport \nhas been serving a varying share of the demand\u2014mostly international passengers and freight\u2014\nbut carries less than 5% of the total traffic. Domestic air services are mainly between Bishkek \nand Osh. Water transport is limited to few operations in Lake Issyk-Kul (map). \n \n\nTable 1: National Freight and Passenger Traffic Flows \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2006 \n\n2008 \n\n2004 \n\n2002 \n\nTotal \n\n943.1 \n1059.9 \n58.6 \n2061.6 \n\n714.9 \n847.4 \n45.5 \n1,607.8 \n\n752.0 \n864.0 \n34.2 \n1,650.2 \n\nTransport Mode \nFreight (million ton-kilometers) \nRail \n394.6 \nRoad \n875.1 \nAir \n38.8 \n1,308.5 \n \nPassenger (million passenger-kilometers) \nRail \n43.1 \n4,857.3 \nRoad \n341.9 \nAir \n \n5,242.3 \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  road-based  trade  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC) \n3. \nthrough  Torugart,  which  amounts  to  about  half  its  total  trade  with  the  PRC,  rose  from  about \n100,000  tons  in  2003  to  more  than  280,000  tons  in  2007  (Table  2).  This  increase  was  driven \nmostly by the rise in demand for consumer goods in the Kyrgyz Republic, and export of metals \nto the PRC. This has caused the number of vehicles crossing the border to more than double in \n4 years.   \n \n\n61.5 \n5,936.4 \n360.2 \n6,358.1 \n\n45.3 \n5,407.3 \n458.9 \n5,911.5 \n\n89.6 \n6509.0 \n632.7 \n7231.3 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nTable 2: Freight and Passenger Traffic Flow through Torugart Border \n\n2007 \n\n2006 \n\n2005 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n77,677 \n26,351 \n\n171,51 \n53,923 \n\n147,327 \n79,401 \n\n158,765 \n92,810 \n\n7,598 \n660 \n8,258 \n45 \n91 \n\n4,040 \n292 \n4,332 \n24 \n(16) \n\n7,110 \n983 \n8,093 \n44 \n(2) \n\n7,662 \n1,149 \n8,811 \n48 \n9 \n\n8,214 \n1,396 \n9,610 \n52 \n8 \n\nItem \nNumber of Vehicles  \nKyrgyz Republic \nPRC  \nTotal  \nADT \nchange (%) \nVolume of Freight (tons)  \nTo PRC  \nFrom PRC  \n( ) = negative, ADT = average daily traffic, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.  \nSource: National Statistics Committee. 2008. Kyrgyzstan in Figures. Bishkek. \n \n4. \nThe  35,000  km  road  network  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  spans  evenly  across  the  seven \noblasts  (provinces),  and  connects  many  of  the  remote  communities  to  each  other  and  to \nneighboring countries. The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) manages about \n19,000  km  of  the  roads  (republican  roads)  that  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  central \nGovernment.  These  roads  are  classified  international  (22%),  national  (30%),  and  rural  (48%) \nroads.  The  remaining  16,000  km  are  mainly  rural  roads  under  the  jurisdiction  of  local \ngovernments.  About  40%  (7,500  km)  of  the  republican  roads  are  paved,  50%  are  gravel,  and \nthe others are unpaved roads. Development partners have provided more than $400 million (on \naverage  about  $30  million  per  year)  for  road  improvement,  and  this  helped  rehabilitate  nearly \n1,600 km of roads (40% of international roads) between 1995 and 2008. Works on another 660 \nkm are either continuing or expected to start before the end of 2010. However, a road condition \nsurvey  conducted  in  2005  revealed  that  more  than  70%  of  the  local  roads  also  need  repair  or \nreconstruction. More than 50% of the international roads, including parts of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nroad, have yet to be rehabilitated.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n170,203 \n112,761 \n\n1. \n\nProblems \n\n5. \nLack  of  Funds.  All  development  partners  recognize  that,  unless  these  roads  are \nimproved,  the  network  is  unlikely  to  be  able  to  serve  the  increased  demand  for  transport \ngenerated  by  growing  regional  trade.  Moreover,  border  infrastructure  and  procedures  need  to \nbe improved to serve the share of international and transit traffic, particularly vehicles carrying \nnatural resources, between the PRC and neighboring countries. These two types of traffic would \nincrease  substantially  because  of  the  limited  potential  to  improve  the  railways  across \nmountainous  terrain.  The  Government  has  prepared  a  Road  Sector  Development  Strategy  for \n2007\u201320101 (RSDS) that specifies eight medium-term measures to improve access to regional \nand  local  markets:  (i)  rehabilitation  and  adequate  maintenance,  (ii)  transport  independence, \n(iii) improvement  of  the  road  financing  system,  (iv) involvement  of  the  private  sector  in  road \nconstruction  and  maintenance,  (v)  involvement  of  local  communities  in  maintenance  of  local \nroads,  (vi)  institutional  reforms,  (vii)  improvement  of  road  safety,  and  (viii) use  of  modern \ntechnologies in road management and monitoring. Eight roads, including the Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nroad,  are  identified  in  the  strategy  for  improvement  on  a  priority  basis.  The  target  is  to \n\n                                                 \n1   Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  2007.  Road  Sector  Development  Strategy  for \n\n2007\u20132010. Bishkek.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\nrehabilitate or reconstruct at least one-third of these roads by 2010.  A detailed analysis of the \nroad subsector in the Kyrgyz Republic is in Appendix 2. \n \n6. \nThe total estimated cost of fully implementing the physical components of the RSDS is \n$1.5 billion. This includes about $1.2 billion for rehabilitating some 2,000 km and maintaining all \nroads under MOTC\u2019s jurisdiction during the next 5 years. The first phase of the RSDS requires \n(i) about $490 million for rehabilitating the remaining sections of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road and \nOsh\u2013Isfana road, and (ii) about $48 million annually for maintenance. The Government expects \nto borrow or receive grants from its development partners for this, and to finance maintenance \nthrough allocations from the central budget. In the past, it allocated progressively more funds for \nthe  road  sector\u2014total  funding  increased  from  $12  million  in  2005  to  $40 million  in  2007. \nHowever, the Government has difficulty financing the total cost of the RSDS from its budget.  \n \n7. \nOrganizations and Regulations. Since 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nmaintained  a  continuous  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  provided  technical  assistance  for \nimproving  the  transport  sector  performance. 2    The  Government  has  adopted  numerous \nstrategies  and  plans  in  addition  to  the  RSDS.  Four  separate  agencies,  including  a  separate \ndepartment  managing  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  corridor,  will  be  set  up  to  manage  the \ninternational  road  corridors.  Yet,  it  lacks  a  comprehensive  time-based  plan  and  the  skilled \npeople  required  for  developing  the  transport  sector.  Public  sector  salaries  and  professional \ndevelopment programs are insufficient to attract and retain good workers.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\nContribution  to  Regional  Integration.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  transport  system  is \n8. \nimportant  for  national  economic  and  social  development  as  well  as  for  the  central  and  south \nAsian  economies.  Improving  transport  infrastructure  and  border  operations  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  will  lower  the  cost  of  domestic  transport  and  international  traffic  as  well  as  transit \ntraffic.  The  Government  is  committed  to  \u201cworking  together  for  trade  openness,  transport \ncorridors for integrating the region and connecting to external markets, and for developing and \nsharing the region\u2019s energy resources\u201d during the Fourth Ministerial Conference on Central Asia \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  in  Bishkek  in  2005. 3 The  CAREC  Transport  and \nTrade  Facilitation  Strategy 4  supports  this  by  (i)  establishing  competitive  transport  corridors \nacross  the  CAREC  region;  (ii)  facilitating  efficient  movement  through  corridors  and  across \nborders;  and  (iii) developing  sustainable,  safe,  and  user-friendly  transport  and  trade  networks. \nCross-border  transport  procedures  are  being  improved  under  several  ADB-financed  projects, \nand  a  cross-border  agreement  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  PRC,  and  Tajikistan  is  being \nfinalized  under  Grant  0084-KGZ:  CAREC  Regional  Road  Corridor  Improvement  Project. \nDeveloping a harmonized transport regulatory framework is one of the tasks undertaken by the \nCAREC  Transport  Sector  Coordination  Committee.  Therefore,  road  improvements  would \ncomplete the cycle needed to lower transport cost and time.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2002.

In  addition  to  the  RSDS,  improving  and  maintaining  road \n9. \ninfrastructure is a high priority in the Country Development Strategy (2007\u20132010).5 The strategy \ncalls for developing international road corridors to facilitate regional trade and transit traffic, as \nwell as establishing legal and regulatory frameworks to encourage private sector participation in \ntransport. Several other government policies are also directed at improving the efficiency of the \ntransport sector based on market-oriented principles, and the Government has agreed with ADB \nto adopt the road sector master plan currently under development as part of CAREC Transport \nCorridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project.6  \n \n10. \nADB  Strategy.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  CAREC  Regional  Cooperation \nStrategy and Program7 and the Joint Country Support Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic (2007\u2013\n2010). 8  It  supports  two  strategic  objectives:  (i)  increasing  trade  and  integration  with  large \nmarkets  in  South  Asia,  the  PRC,  the  Russian  Federation,  and  Turkey;  and  (ii)  improving \neconomic  cooperation  to  reduce  transport  costs  and  facilitate  trade  and  transit\u2014allowing \nCentral  Asian  countries  to  become  integrated  and  use  their  location  to  their  advantage. \nMoreover,  the  Project  will  complement  the  ADB-led  investment  and  policy  dialogue  in  the \ncountry,  and  complete  a  key  transport  corridor  connecting  its  capital  Bishkek  to  Kashi  in  the \nPRC, and is consistent with the sector strategy of ADB, which is the lead development partner \nin the transport sector. \n \nExternal  Assistance.  ADB  is  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  main  development  partner  in  the \n11. \nroad subsector. The Project is the eighth ADB-financed road project in the country, and would \nbring  its  total  assistance  for  infrastructure  and  capacity  development  since  1996  to  nearly \n$280 million (64% of its total development assistance to the country since 1995). These projects \ninclude the Bishkek\u2013Osh\u2013Irkeshtam road, the Kyrgyz Republic part of the road from Bishkek to \nAlmaty  in  Kazakhstan,  the  Sary  Tash\u2013Karamyk  road,  and  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1 \n(Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road)  Project  (Project  1),  which  was  approved  in  2008.  The  Project  is  a \ncontinuation of Project 1 and the second in the phased rehabilitation plan for the corridor. The \nWorld  Bank,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  and  the \nPRC  are  the  other  donors  to  the  road  sector.  The  World  Bank,  the  European  Union,  and  the \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  are  proposing  a  combined  assistance \npackage of some $75 million to improve the Osh\u2013Isfana road. Likewise, the Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  is  assisting  MOTC  to  improve  road  maintenance  and  some  important \nbridges. A summary of the projects financed by external agencies is in Appendix 3.  \n \n12. \nThe Government is seeking additional external financing to complete ongoing works on \nthe  CAREC  corridors,  including  $200  million  for  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road.  The  2,800  km \nsection of CAREC Transport Corridor 1 in Kazakhstan is being improved with the assistance of \nADB,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, the Islamic Development Bank, and the World Bank.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2007.

These  deficiencies \nhave  been  corrected  through  technical  assistance,  and  guidance  from  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  partners.  ADB  has  also  reviewed  the  completion  reports  and  audit  reports  of \nprevious projects,10 and agreed with MOTC on a series of measures, including a transport sector \nmaster plan and an improved project management approach (described in paras. 26\u201328). These \nwill  be  implemented  in  Project  1  and  the  Project.  MOTC  will  also  hire  additional  specialists  to \nincrease oversight of road network development impacts. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  primary  impact  will  be  increased  regional  trade,  particularly  between  the \n14. \nKyrgyz Republic and the PRC, which will lead to less poverty in Naryn oblast. Its main outcomes \nwill be higher accessibility and mobility. \n \nThe  Project  has  a  physical  component  and  a  nonphysical  component.  The  physical \n15. \ncomponent includes rehabilitating about 75 km of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road and constructing an \ninspection facility for managing international passenger and freight traffic. The sections that will \nbe  rehabilitated  are  located  adjacent  to  the  section  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  1  road. \nMOTC staff\u2019s skills and knowledge will be improved under the nonphysical component. This will \nalso  be  a  continuation  of  Project  1\u2014the  human  resource  development  part  of  the  transport \nsector master plan development component.   \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe main outputs are as follows: \n\n16. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nSome  75  km  of  2-lane  road  (km  365\u2013400  and  km  439\u2013479)  with  geometry  and \npavement  structure  improved  to  category  III  standards,11 improved  bridges  at  km \n388 and km 400, and an inspection (border control) facility close to km 479. \n\nA professional development program for road sector professionals implemented \naccording to the human resource development component of the transport sector \nmaster plan (2010\u20132025), which is under preparation.12   \n\n                                                 \n9   Financed  through  three  ADB  loans:  ADB.  1996.

Manila. \n\n11  As defined in Kyrgyz Republic road standards. \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n17. \nAs  part  of  the  physical  component,  a  comprehensive  inspection  facility  (customs, \nimmigration,  health  and  quarantine,  border  control,  etc.)  to  manage  the  movement  of \ninternational  freight  and  passenger  traffic  will  be  constructed  in  the  vicinity  of  km  479  (about \n60 km  from  the  current  inspection  facility  at  Torugart).  The  new  facility  will  solve  at  least  two \nexisting  problems.  One,  the  services  and  utilities  in  Torugart  are  inadequate  to  serve  the \nincreased staff of all the agencies that will be required to serve the post when traffic reaches the \nprojected  levels  in  5  years.  Two,  the  climate  there  is  too  harsh  and  living  conditions  are \nunfavorable. Therefore, the new facility will become the main border inspection point for traffic to \nand  from  the  PRC  while  the  post  at  the  border  in  Torugart  will  be  improved  as  part  of  Grant \n0123-KGZ, and will serve as a screening point by border control (internal security) officials. For \nexpediency  and  as  a  demonstration  of  interagency  collaboration,  the  Government  has  agreed \nfor construction works on this facility to be part of the civil works in the section from km 439 to \nkm 479, and maintenance of the paved parking, and the facility access and egress roads to be \nincluded in the regular maintenance program of MOTC.  \n \n18. \nThe  other  is  an  industry-university  program  in  the  nonphysical  component  to  increase \nthe knowledge and technical skills of road engineering graduates of Kyrgyz universities. Details \nof  the  program  will  be  prepared  as  part  of  the  transport  master  plan  component  under \nGrant 0123-KGZ:  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1  (Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road)  Project,  and  will \ninclude (i) setting up at least five summer internship positions at MOTC for students seeking a \ncareer  in  transport;  and  (ii)  offering at  least  two  short  courses  (maximum  1 month  duration)  in \ntransportation  engineering  and  project  management.  These  courses  would  be  available  to \nMOTC staff and university students, who can follow them to obtain a certificate of competency. \nThe internship program and courses will be offered every year during the project implementation \nperiod,  and  will  be  designed  in  consultation  with  local  technical  universities,  chambers  of \ncommerce,  technical  accreditation  bodies,  foreign  universities,  and  the  road  industry\u2014\nconsultants, road transport operators, contractors, etc.   \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $62.5  million,  including  taxes  and \n\n19. \nduties of $6 million (Table 3 and Appendix 4).    \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \n12  Financed from ADB. 2008.

MOTC,  which  is  also  the  executing  agency  (EA)  for  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects,14 \nwill  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  Project.  With  the  assistance  of  international  and \nnational  consultants,  MOTC  has,  over  the  past  10  years,  acquired  a  broad  understanding  of \nproject management principles and ADB procedures to implement the Project effectively.  \n \n23. \nThe project implementation unit (PIU) established by MOTC, which is managing Project \n1  at  present,  will  oversee  and  manage  day-to-day  activities  of  the  Project.  MOTC  plans  to \nstrengthen the PIU\u2019s current team of about 10 professionals within the next 2 years. Many of the \ncurrent  team  members  are  aware  of  international  best  practices  and  ADB  polices  and \nprocedures.  They  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  services; \nadministering  contracts;  and  ensuring  project  completion  according  to  the  schedules  and \ncovenants.  No  major  social  and  environmental  impacts  have  resulted  from  past  road  projects. \nHowever,  as  the  road  network  expands  and  traffic  increases,  better  planning,  designing,  and \nmonitoring will be needed to manage impacts during and after construction. Therefore, MOTC is \nalso planning to assign or recruit relevant safeguard specialists to the PIU.   \n \nADB has assigned a team (staff from headquarters and the Kyrgyz Resident Mission) to \n24. \nmanage  the  Project  and  ADB\u2019s  continuing  road  sector  activities  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  This \nteam  will  liaise  with  the  PIU  and  regularly  review  the  road  sector  portfolio  performance  while \nguiding MOTC on critical project administration matters. ADB and MOTC have drafted a project \nadministration  memorandum  (Supplementary  Appendix  A)  to  ensure  project  delivery  on  time \nand within budget. It outlines the tasks to be performed by each party to maintain the schedule, \nensure  compliance  with  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  assure  transparency  and \nintegrity, and report accurately. Additionally, MOTC will use web-based project management to \nallow  better  communication  between  field  offices  and  the  PIU.  This  will  enable  ADB  to  gain \naccess  to  up-to-date  information  such  as  completed  physical  quantities,  disbursements, \noutstanding payments, contractors\u2019 claims, etc.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n25. \nThe  Project  started  in  May  2009  with  advance  contracting,  and  will  be  completed  by \nDecember  2013  when  the  warranty  on  civil  works  ends.  The  actual  physical  works  will \ncommence in April 2010. A summary of project activities and their schedules is in Appendix 5 \nand a detailed schedule is in the project administration memorandum (PAM). \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n26.  MOTC will procure works and goods financed by ADB according to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Civil  works  in  the  Project  have  been \npackaged  into  two  contracts\u2014contract  1:  km  365\u2013km  400,  and  contract  2:  km  439\u2013km  479. \nThese  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.

National competitive bidding will be \nconducted  according  to  the  Law  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  on  Public  Procurement  of  Goods, \nWorks, and Services effective April 2004, subject to clarifications and modifications as agreed \nwith ADB and as indicated in section C of the procurement plan. The procurement activities in \nthe 18 months beginning in May 2009 are shown in Appendix 6.  \n  \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nSupervising  civil  works,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and,  if  necessary,  reviewing  and \n28. \ndesigning other parts of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road will be done by one international firm. This \nfirm will also provide on-the-job training in various aspects of construction and maintenance of \nroads for MOTC staff. The firm will be selected by MOTC according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  selected  firm  will  also  provide \ntraining in various aspects of construction and maintenance of roads for MOTC staff. The firm \nwill  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  full  technical  proposals  evaluated  using  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  (QCBS)  or  quality-based  selection  (QBS)  method,  or  single  source  selection \n(SSS) method if appropriate justification can be provided. MOTC may use a weighting of 70:30 \nif the QCBS method is used.   \n \n29. \nServices of an independent audit firm will be procured to perform annual financial audits \nof  the  project  accounts.  Services  of  national  and  international  individual  consultants  or \ninternational firms will be procured from time to time to assist the PIU staff (project management \nassistance) in special circumstances or to handle complex issues, as well as to help implement \nthe master plan. When using the QCBS method, a cost-quality ratio of 70:30 based on simplified \ntechnical proposals may be used after discussing with ADB. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\nTo expedite the bidding process, ADB Management has, in principle, approved advance \n30. \ncontracting and retroactive financing from the grant and loan proceeds for expenditures incurred \non  eligible  civil  works  and  consulting  services.  Advance  contracting  allows  the  Government  to \ncommence procurement activities, at its own risk, prior to signing of the financing agreements. \nThe  Government  was  informed  that,  for  expenses  incurred  under  advance  contracting  to  be \neligible  for  retroactive  financing,  such  procedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Once the grant and \nloan become effective, up to 20% of the proceeds may be used to retroactively finance eligible \nexpenditures  incurred  during  the  period  not  exceeding  12  months  prior  to  signing  of  the \nfinancing  agreements.  Alternatively,  the  Government  may  opt  for  advance  contracting  without \nretroactive  financing,  in  which  case,  the  procurement  procedures  adopted  under  advance \ncontracting  do  not  conclude  with  the  award  of  contract  until  after  the  grant  and  loan  become \neffective.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with  the  procedures, \ndocumentation, or proposal for award does not commit ADB to finance such expenses. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nproject  financing  agreements  and  the  service  and  works  contracts  under  the  Project.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \nFor greater transparency and accountability, the Government will disclose to the public, \n32. \nand  update  annually,  the  current  status,  annual  financial  statements,  and  future  plans  of  the \nroad fund established by the Government in 1998 through local media and on the websites of \nthe Ministry of Finance and MOTC. MOTC will also disclose (i) its annual financial statement of \nthe funds it receives from the central budget, and (ii) the status and implementation progress of \nall  donor-funded  investment  projects  concerning  the  road  sector.  In  particular,  MOTC  will \ndisclose  on  its  website  information  on  how  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  are \nused.  For  each  contract  financed  under  the  Project,  MOTC  will  disclose  on  its  website \ninformation on, among others: (i) the list of participating bidders; (ii) name of the winning bidder; \n(iii) basic details on bidding procedures and procurement methods adopted; (iv) the amount of \ncontract  awarded;  (v)  the  list  of  goods/services,  including  consulting  services,  procured;  and \n(vi) the intended and actual utilization of the loan and grant proceeds under each contract. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n33. \nAll  disbursements  of  the  ADB  grant  and  loan  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nTo  facilitate  project  implementation  and  funds  flow,  two  separate  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished  for  the  grant  and  the  loan  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  be \nexclusively  used  to  finance  ADB\u2019s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  MOTC  will  manage  both \nimprest  accounts.  The  initial  advance  to  be  deposited  to  the  relevant  imprest  account  will  not \nexceed either 6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the grant or loan amount, as the \ncase  may  be,  whichever  is  lower.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  the  documentation \nprocess, the statement of expenditures procedure will be used for liquidating and replenishing \neach  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  payment.  The \npayments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of  expenditures  ceiling  will  be  liquidated  or  replenished \nbased on the supporting documentation process.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n34. \nThe EA will maintain separate accounts for all project components financed by ADB and \nthe  Government,  and  have  them  audited  by  an  independent  auditor  that  has  adequate \nknowledge and experience of international accounting practices and is acceptable to ADB. The \naudited project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB within 6 months after \nthe  end  of  each  fiscal  year  during  implementation.  The  auditor\u2019s  report  should  include  a \nseparate  opinion  on  the  proper  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedures.  The  Government  has  been  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  the  timely \nsubmission  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  including  the  suspension  of \ndisbursements in case of noncompliance. The EA will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly and \nannual progress reports on project implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed \nwith  ADB.  To  facilitate  evaluation  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  provide  a  project \ncompletion report to ADB within 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\nA financial management assessment of the EA was conducted (details in Supplementary \n35. \nAppendix B) during the preparation of Project 1, and it concluded that the associated risks are \nlow because of the EA\u2019s adequate experience in project management. The EA has adopted an \naccrual accounting system supported by standardized accounting software. MOTC is subject to \nthree levels of audit: (i) an internal audit by the Department of Economic and Financial Planning \nand Control, (ii) a statutory audit by the Chamber of Accounts of the Kyrgyz Republic, and (iii) a \nmandatory  external  audit  for  ADB-financed  projects  by  an  independent  audit  firm.  ADB  will \nreserve the right to verify the project accounts maintained by the EA as well as the accounts of \nthe construction firms and consulting firms financed under the Project. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nADB and MOTC have agreed on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating project \n36. \nperformance  in  relation  to  its  impact  and  outcome  prior  to  its  commencement.  These  include \nindicators  from  the  project  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  At  the  start  of  civil \nworks, the EA will collate values of these indicators, which will be used as baseline values for \nmonitoring purposes during project implementation. MOTC will follow the same systematic data \ncollection procedure used for reporting the performance of past and ongoing projects. Although \nmonitoring  of  different  indicators  will  be  done  at  different  times  and  at  different  frequencies, \nreporting to ADB will be biannual. The performance and impact of the Project will be done both \nby MOTC and at completion of the Project, and 1 and 3 years after completion. A final report will \nconsist of an evaluation of changes that occurred in the preceding 3 years. If necessary, MOTC \nwill  engage  specialists  to  perform  detailed  assessment  of  socioeconomic,  environmental,  and \ntechnical impacts of the Project. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\nthe  PIU \n\nThe  ADB \n\nteam  and \n\nteam  will  maintain  continuous  oversight  of \n\n37. \nthe \nimplementation  activities  with  at  least  one  detailed  review  every  12  months  from  the  effective \ndate  of  the  financing  agreement.  The  detailed  reviews  will  be  done  in  consultation  with  other \nstaff of MOTC, officials of the Ministry of Finance, State Customs Committee, and other relevant \nagencies  as  well  as  public  and  private  representatives  from  the  project  area.  The  review  will \ntechnical, \nfocus  on  outputs,  particularly \nenvironmental,  and  social  aspects  to  ensure  project  delivery  is  on  time  and  on  budget.  The \nProject\u2019s economic viability and other aspects that may have an impact on overall performance \nwill  be  assessed  after  completion  of  the  Project,  or  as  necessary  during  implementation.  The \nreview  will  examine  the  implementation  progress  of  the  reforms  and  compliance  with \nassurances specified in the financing agreement. \n \nG. \n\ninstitutional,  administrative, \n\nStakeholder Consultation \n\nthose  relating \n\nto \n\n38. \nDuring  the  project  preparation\u2014feasibility  studies,  environmental  impact  assessment, \nand  social  surveys\u2014the  Government,  nongovernment  organizations,  local  communities,  road \nusers,  external  aid  agencies,  and  other  project  stakeholders  were  asked  their  needs  and \nexpectations.  The  consultants  and  ADB\u2019s  project  team  explained  to  them  the  road  alignment, \ntransport  services,  and  the  expected  impacts  and  outcomes  of  the  Project.  There  was  a  high \ndegree  of  support  from  all  parties,  both  private  and  public,  individuals  and  groups.  Similar \nmeetings will be held throughout project implementation, and concerns and suggestions will be \nused to improve the project impact. \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nthe \n\ninternational \n\nThe  Project  will  bring  immediate  benefits  to  road  users  in  the  form  of  lower  operating \n39. \ncosts  and  travel  time  because  of  the  improved  surface  of  the  project  road  and  the  transport \nmaster plan implementation, which would increase the efficiency of the overall road network and \ntransport  services.  However,  sustainable  benefits  will  result  in  the  medium  to  long  term\u2014after \ntraffic \nthe  entire  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road,  Bishkek  bypass  road,  and \nmanagement facilities are constructed. These benefits will be in the form of reduced travel time \nand  increased  economic  activity  resulting  from  tourism,  agriculture,  and  mineral  resources \ndevelopment  in  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  corridor.  About  1.5  million  tons  or  half  of  the  estimated \ntotal  volume  of  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013PRC  trade  in  2015  are  expected  to  move  on  the  Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart road. Moreover, the road passes through three oblasts that have poverty levels above the \nnational average of 46%. It will give better market access to the estimated 2.3 million people living \nin the corridor. In addition, about 51% of the project impact area population is female, which is the \ndominant  gender  in  intra-  and  inter-oblast  trade  and  commerce  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  can \nbenefit from the improved access.   \n \n40. \nThe economic analysis entailed projecting direct costs and benefits for with- and without-\nproject  scenarios  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.15 The  difference  between  the  with-  and \nwithout-project  cost  and  benefits  streams  represents  the  net  benefits  of  the  Project.  The \neconomic  analysis  covers  25  years  (2009\u20132032),  comprising  about  5  years  for  rehabilitating \n(including defects liability period) and 20 years of operation. The least-cost option was selected \namong mutually exclusive project alternatives and various pavement treatment options. Details \nof the economic analysis are in Appendix 7. \n \n41. \nThe  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  direct  benefits  accruing \nafter  improving  the  entire  corridor is  14.4%  and  the  net  present  value  is  $49.7  million.  To  test \nthe  impact  of  deviations  of  costs  and  benefits  from  the  estimated  averages,  a  series  of \nsensitivity  tests  was  performed.  The  deviations  considered  include  the  construction  cost \nincreasing by 20%, the implementation period extending by 3 years, and the 6% traffic growth \nrate  continuing  at  6%  instead  of  increasing  to  8%  after  5  years.  The  tests  suggested  that  the \nEIRR  drops  to  12%  if  the  construction  cost  rises  by  20%,  but  to  about  13%  if  the  other  two \nevents occurred.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts  \n\n42. \nThe  Project  will  have  an  indirect  impact  on  poverty  by  stimulating  economic \ndevelopment.  The  results  of  the  social  and  poverty  assessments  undertaken  are  presented  in \nthe  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  in  Appendix  8.  While  the  Project  aims  to \nfacilitate  regional  trade  and  thereby  benefit  major  businesses  and  those  involved  in  trade  and \ncommerce,  it  will  also  significantly  benefit  rural  communities  and  especially  the  rural  poor.  In \nparticular,  it  will  increase  the  mobility  of  2.3  million  people  living  in  three  oblasts,  which  the \nBishkek\u2013Torugart road passes through, which have poverty levels below the national average of \n46%.  Since about  51% of  the  project  impact  area  population  is  female,  which is  the  dominant \ngender  in  intra-  and  inter-oblast  (province)  trade  and  commerce  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the \nincreased mobility would have special significance.   \n\n                                                 \n15  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\nRoad construction work will create opportunities for direct and indirect employment over \n43. \nthe  3-year  implementation  period.  Thereafter,  maintenance  work,  which  will  be  outsourced  to \nnational firms, will create longer-term employment and service opportunities.   \n \nInformation and periodic seminars on HIV prevention will be made available through the \n44. \nconstruction company to people directly and indirectly associated with the Project as well as to \nresidents  in  the  project  area.  These  outreach  activities  will  be  designed  by  the  construction \ncompany  and  approved  by  MOTC  as  part  of  the  health  and  safety  management  part  of  the \nquality  assurance  and  quality  control  plan,  which  will  also  support  the  Government\u2019s  national \nprogram. ADB will review and make specific recommendations, if necessary. The responsibility \nfor preparing and implementing such a plan will be an integral part of the construction contract.  \n \nC. \n\nSocial Safeguards  \n\n45. \nClassification of the Project for resettlement impact is category C. All civil works will take \nplace  within  the  existing  right-of-way  or  on  unused  state-owned  land.  No  relocation  of \nhouseholds  or  acquisition  of  productive  land  is  expected.  Borrow  pits  or  quarries  are  also \navailable in state-owned empty land, within easy access and away from residential areas. \n  \n46. \nThere  are  no  groups  with  characteristics  of  indigenous  people  (as  defined  by  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples [1998]) affected by the Project. Therefore, the Project is classified \ncategory C for its impact on indigenous people. In 2005, it was reported that the population in \nthe  project  area  consisted  of  99%  Kyrgyz  and  other  nationalities  included,  Russians,  Tajiks, \nTatars, Uygurs, and Uzbeks who have lived in the same region for a long time and integrated in \nthe  same  economic  and  social  structure.  The  road  alignment  touches  only  the  Kyrgyz \nsettlements and none of them will be adversely affected.  \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts  \n\n47. \nThe  environmental  classification  for  the  Project  is  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines. 16  It  showed  that  the  project  road  will  not  have  a \nsignificant irreversible or permanent, negative environmental impact during or after rehabilitation. \nMOTC, in its contracts with the construction firm, will require it to elaborate and implement the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) outlined in the IEE summary  (Appendix 9), and abide \nby the environmental laws and regulations of the Kyrgyz Republic and ADB\u2019s policies, procedures \nand guidelines, specifically its Environment Policy, to avoid or alleviate temporary impact. \n \nE. \n\nProject Assumptions and Risks \n\nThere is a risk that the Project will be implemented late and over budget. There is also a \n48. \nrisk  that  maintenance  will  be  substandard  and  underfunded.  Counterpart  finance  is  always  a \nconcern, aggravated by the current global financial crisis. Project execution delays will cut the \nrate of return in achieving the expected results. \n \n49. \nADB  is  aware  of  these  risks  and  is  working  closely  with  the  Government  on  improving \ncapabilities, maintenance financing and institutional effectiveness. The resident mission and the \nheadquarters  teams  will  join  up  with  the  MOTC  team  to  ensure  that  execution  schedules  are \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fkept  in  touch  and  that  adequate  budget  allocation  are  made  every  year.  The  latter  will  be \ncovenanted in the loan agreement. \n \n50. \nADB's  dialogue  with  the  Government  is  effective  and  constructive.  The  Government \nagrees  with  the  risk  assumptions  and  implementation  proposals.  It  has  also  tapped  other \nfinanciers to complete another 150 km by 2015.   \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n51. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MOTC have given ADB the \nfollowing  assurances,  which  are  incorporated  in  the  financing  agreement  for  the  Project,  to \nensure the following: \n \n\nCounterpart funding. The amount of funds outlined in the project financing plan \nis  available  on  time  to  enable  completion  of  the  Project  on  schedule,  and \nsubsequently  adequate  funds  are  allocated  to  operate  and  maintain  the  road \nthroughout its service life. \n\nAdditional  funding.  Adequate  funds  are  allocated  and  made  available  on  a \ntimely  basis  to  operate  and  maintain  the  road  sections  rehabilitated  under  the \nProject throughout their service life. In addition, funding will be made available for \nrehabilitating the remaining sections of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road to allow rapid \nand uninterrupted flow of international passenger and freight traffic. \n\nCapacity of the PIU and award of civil works contracts. Three months before \nthe implementation of the first civil works contract under the Project commences, \nthe  capacity  of  the  PIU  is  strengthened  by,  at  least,  increasing  and  recruiting \nadequate  number  of  professional  staff  with  specialization  in  the  areas  required \nfor the Project. \n\nTransparency  and  good  governance.  All  transactions  and  payments  are \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  fund  disbursement  procedures  and  all \ncontracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  include  provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  and  the  Government  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords  and  accounts  of  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nproviders of goods and services as they relate to the Project. \n\nPublic access to information. Financial statements and implementation details of \nthe  Project  including  information  on  opportunities  for  works  and  services, \nprocurement status, and contracts awards, are accessible to the public through the \ninternet or at MOTC. \n\nConstruction  quality. Stringent oversight is maintained on the consultants and \ncontractors  under  the  Project  so  that  the  services  and  works  carried  out  under \nthe  relevant  contracts  conform  to  the  standards  and  specifications  required  by \nthe Project, and are of high quality. \n\n \n(vii)  Road  operations. The relevant authorities and parties coordinate and maintain \nregular and quality services on the road sections rehabilitated under the Project \nduring and after rehabilitation.  \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n(viii)  Environment. The road sections rehabilitated under the Project are designed, \nrehabilitated, maintained, and operated according to (a) all applicable national \nenvironmental laws and regulations, (b) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, and (c) the \nEMP for the Project. If there is any discrepancy between the applicable national \nlaws and regulations, and the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  shall  apply.  In  addition,  all  civil  works  contracts  will  include \nrequirements  to  comply  with  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  in \naccordance  with  the  IEE  and  the  EMP.  All  civil  works  contractors  will  be \nsupervised  to  ensure  their  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  IEE  and \nthe EMP. \n\n \n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Although  no \nland  acquisition  and \nresettlement  activities  are  required  according  to  the  current  design,  if  either  or \nboth  become  necessary  in  any  section  of  the  road  during  rehabilitation,  a \nresettlement  plan  or  a  short  resettlement  plan,  as  the  case  may  be,  will  be \nprepared  according  to  the  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations,  and  the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and submitted to \nADB  for  approval  before  commencing  any  form  of  works  in  these  sections.  If \nthere  is  any  discrepancy  between  the  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations, \nand \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy,  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements shall apply. \n\nthe  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \n\nEqual  opportunities  and  continuous  consultation.  There  will  be  no  gender, \nracial,  or  other  forms  of  discrimination  with  regard  to  employment,  salary, \npayment  of  compensation  for  land  acquisition  or  resettlement,  and  other \nbusiness opportunities arising from the Project. Consultations with residents and \nofficials in the project areas will be regularly conducted on matters of social and \ncultural significance during the project implementation period.  \n\nEmployment  and  labor.  The  contractors  and  consultants  engaged  under  the \nProject are required to provide maximum possible opportunities for employment \nof the project area residents. Each of the civil works contractors of the Project will \ncomply with all applicable national labor, health, and safety laws and regulations. \nIn  particular,  each  of  the  civil  works  contracts  financed  under  the  Project  will \n(a) contain  provisions  prohibiting  use  of  child  labor,  employment  of  illegal \nimmigrants,  and  differentiation  in  wages  between  male  and  female  workers  for \nwork  of  equal  value;  (b)  include  mandatory  provisions  requiring  contractors  and \nconsultants  to  provide  healthy,  safe,  and  secure  working  conditions  as  well  as \nadequate medical, life, and disability insurance for all its employees; and (c) have \na  requirement  to  conduct  periodic  awareness  campaigns  on  sexually  transmitted \ndiseases and HIV/AIDS for its employees as well as service providers during the \nrelevant contract  period.  All contractors  and  their  employees  will  be  required  to \nobserve  local  protocols  concerning  acceptable  behavior  toward  the  local \npopulation. \n\n(xii) \n\nIllegal  trafficking  and  border  control.  Concrete  and  rigorous  measures  to \ndetect and prevent trafficking of humans, wildlife, endangered species, and illegal \nsubstances  on  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road  will  be  fully  implemented,  and  the \nGovernment shall inform ADB of any incidents and action taken to prevent such \nincidents. In particular, the Government will ensure that (a) appropriate measures \nfor controlling and monitoring the transportation of passengers and goods on the \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nroad  section  between  the  inspection  facility  constructed  under  the  Project  at \nkm 479 of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road and the border control facility constructed \nunder  Grant  0123-KGZ(SF):  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1  (Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nRoad) Project  at Torugart shall be designed and implemented on a timely basis, \nand (b) such road section is rigorously patrolled at all times. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  the  proposed  grant  would  comply  with  the \n52. \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 18,492,000 to \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1  (Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nRoad) Project 2 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at \nthe  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Financing Agreement presented to the Board; and \n\nthe grant not exceeding $22,000,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic, from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, for the CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) \nProject 2, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft Financing Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n\n19 June 2009 \n\n \n\n\fDesign Summary \nImpact \nIncreased regional trade \nand reduced poverty in \nNaryn oblast \n\nOutcome \nHigher accessibility and \nmobility \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n17 \n\n \nState Customs Committee \ndata \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNational economic and \nsocial statistics \n \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nAssumption \nCurrent bilateral \nagreements between \nKyrgyz Republic and the \nPRC are strengthened \n \nRisk \nCurrent global economic \ncrisis affects Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2013PRC and overall \nregional trade \n \n\n \nTraffic and origin\u2013\ndestination surveys of \nMOTC  \n \n \nGovernment statistics \n \n \n \n \nADB review missions and \nMOTC\u2019s progress reports \n\nAssumption \nSufficient funds are \navailable on time to \ncomplete improvements to \nthe entire Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nroad \n \nRisk \nGovernment allocation of \nfunds for outsourcing \nmaintenance is inadequate  \n \n\n \nFreight movement \nbetween the PRC and \nthe Kyrgyz Republic \nthrough Torugart \nincreases from 300,000 \ntons in 2008 to 400,000 \ntons by 2015 \n \nThe level of extreme \npoverty in the project \nimpact area declines \nfrom 25% in 2007 to \n20% by 2015 \n \n \nTravel time from Naryn \nto Torugart is reduced \nfrom 5 to at most 4 \nhours by 2015 \n \nAverage daily traffic \noriginating from Naryn \noblast will increase from \n700 to 1000 by 2015 \n \nAverage time at \ninspection point at \nTorugart reduced from \n30 minutes per vehicle in \n2009 to 15 minutes in \n2013 \n \nCertified transportation \nprofessionals help \nincrease total \nperformance based \nmaintenance contract \nvalue from nothing at \npresent to at least \n$100,000 by 2013 \n \n2.3 million people's \naccessibility will be \nimproved \n  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \nPeriodic progress reports \nof the contractor, periodic \nfield visits, and \nbeneficiary\u2019s project \ncompletion report \n\nDesign Summary \nOutputs  \n1.

The  road \nnetwork comprises 34,720 kilometers (km) of roads\u201418,810 km of public roads and 15,910 km \nof urban, rural, agricultural, industrial, and other roads. Roads carry about 95% of the country\u2019s \npassenger  traffic  and  more  than  half  of  the  freight  traffic  (90%  of  domestic  traffic).  The  total \nlength  of  international  roads  is  4,163  km,  national  roads  total  5,678  km,  and  local  roads  total \n8,969 km. The length of paved public roads is 7,228 km, comprising 11 km of cement-concrete \nroads,  4,969  km  of  asphalt  roads,  and  2,248  km  of  bitumen  treated  gravel  roads.  The  total \nlength of gravel road is 9,961 km, and there is 1,621 km of unpaved roads.   \n \n2. \nAbout  18,800  km  of  roads  (9,800  km  of  state  roads  and  9,000  km  of  local  roads)  are \nunder  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  (Table  A2.1). \nAbout 40% of the roads are sealed, including some with gravel mixed with bitumen binder. Over \n50%  are  gravel  and  less  than  10%  are  earth  roads.  Since  most  of  the  roads  were  originally \ndesigned for higher traffic volumes, the existing capacity is adequate for the level of economic \nactivity likely to occur in the medium term. Consequently, the primary concern is not expansion \nor  major  upgrading  of  the  roads,  but  rehabilitation  and  preservation.  Roads  at  all  levels  are \ndeteriorating;  over  60%  now  require  periodic  maintenance  or  rehabilitation.  Management  of \nabout  16,000  km,  which  were  formerly  under  the  state  and  collective  farms,  is  now  the \nresponsibility of the district administrations. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Summary of the Road Network, 2007 \nNational \n5,678 \n30 \nGravel \n9,961 \n53 \n\nBy Class \nLength (km) \n% \nBy Type \nLength (km) \n% \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n\nInternational \n4,163 \n22 \nPaved \n7,228 \n38 \n\nEarth Road \n1,621 \n9 \n\nLocal \n8,969 \n48 \n\nTotal \n18,810 \n100 \nTotal \n18,810 \n100 \n\n \n3. \nThe  road  network  was  primarily  developed  under  the  former  Soviet  Union.  However, \nneglect and insufficient funding for almost two decades caused a loss of about $1 billion in road \nassets.  Survey  data  in  2005  found  that  two-thirds  (out  of  4,300  km)  were  in  critical  condition. \nOne-fifth  of  the  surveyed  roads  had  deteriorated  to  the  point  where  expensive  reconstruction, \nnot rehabilitation, was the only option; and about 200 km of paved road are reaching the same \ncondition annually. \n   \n4. \nSince  then,  the  Government  has  made  improvement  of  road  infrastructure  one  of  its \npriorities,  and  started  implementing  its  Road  Sector  Development  Strategy  for  2007\u20132010 1  \n(RSDS).  The  strategy  has  outlined  ways  to  (i)  rehabilitate  key  roads  and  maintain,  (ii)  create \ntransport  independence,  (iii)  improve  road  financing,  (iv)  involve  the  private  sector  in \nconstruction  and  maintenance,  (v)  involve  local  communities  in  local  road  maintenance, \n\n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Transport and Communications, Kyrgyz Republic. 2007. Road Sector Development Strategy for 2007\u2013\n\n2010. Bishkek.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n(vi) reform  MOTC  and  road  network  management,  (vii)  improve  road  safety,  and  (viii)  use \nmodern technologies in construction and management of roads. Eight road corridors, including \nthe Bishkek\u2013Torugart corridor, are identified in the strategy for rehabilitating by 2010. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  is  supporting  this  initiative,  and  the  World  Bank  and  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development are financing the Osh\u2013Isfana improvements. The Government \nis also finalizing a program for improving local roads. \n \n5. \nThe cost of construction and maintenance has risen sharply during the past 3 years, and \nthe Government may need more money than anticipated to implement the RSDS. Moreover, the \ntechnical standards and specifications of roads are aligned to road classification instead of level \nof usage. Therefore, the past tendency has been to build to a high standard rather than to meet \ntraffic demand. A shift toward cost-based designing has begun with MOTC\u2019s reorganization, but \nit will require a continuous dialog between all funding agencies and the Government to expedite \nthis shift.  \n \nB. \n\nVehicle Population \n\n6. \nThe  number  of  registered  vehicles  had  reached  271,000  by  the  end  of  2007,  including \naround  229,000  cars  and  buses,  and  41,700  trucks  (Table  A2.2).  This  is  equivalent  to \n54 vehicles per 1,000 people. The past growth rate, which has averaged about 5%, is expected \nto  continue  and  even  increase  as  the  road  conditions  improve.  Despite  the  decline  in  the \nnumber of trucks, it is expected to grow because of the increasing trade.   \n \n\nTable A2.2: Vehicle Population (Number) \n\n1992 \n176,643 \n77,845 \n254,488 \n\nVehicle Type \nCars/buses \nTrucks \n \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nC. \n\n2000 \n191,423 \n54,638 \n246,061 \n\n1995 \n200,043 \n68,394 \n268,437 \n\nInstitutions \n\nTotal \n\n2005 \n202,520 \n42,679 \n245,199 \n\n2006 \n220,359 \n41,566 \n261,925 \n\n2007 \n229,644 \n41,716 \n271,360 \n\nThe  Automobile  Roads  Act  allocates  the  main  responsibility  for  planning  and \n7. \nadministration  of  road  policies,  programs,  and  projects  to  MOTC.  Policy,  regulation,  planning, \nand  development  of  other  modes  of  transport  and  communications  are  also  under  the \njurisdiction  of  MOTC.  Parts  of  it  are  being  reorganized,  such  as  the  unit  responsible  for \nimplementing donor-financed projects, which was restructured in 2007 and again in early 2009. \nThis  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  drive  to  increase  infrastructure  efficiency  and  meet  rapidly \nchanging  market  conditions.  Soon,  the  existing  regional  road  agencies  (PLUADs  and  UADs)2 \nwill be downsized and the 58 local road maintenance units will be privatized. The Government is \nplanning  to  consolidate  its  other  regional  operations  gradually.  It  has  created  four  separate \ncorridor  management  departments  to  replace  existing  regional  roads  departments,  and  two \nmore will be established in 2009. These departments will eventually be responsible for operating \nand maintaining the core international road network and the feeder roads.  \n \n8. \nOther important agencies in the road sector are (i) KyrgyzIntrans, a holding agency of six \nfreight transport companies and forwarding agencies engaged mainly in international trade; and \n\n                                                 \n2  These are Russian acronyms for regional road maintenance department (PLUAD) and the local road maintenance \n\nsubdivision (UAD) of PLUAD. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n21 \n\n(ii) technical agencies in various stages of divestment under MOTC\u2019s control, including the Road \nDesign  Institute  (Kyrgyzdortransproekt)  and  a  small  agency  responsible  for  developing  and \ntesting new road construction techniques and equipment (Kyrgyztranstekhnika). \n \nD. \n\nFinancing and Maintenance \n\n9. \nThe Road Fund enacted in 1998 has not served its intended purpose up to now. Taxes \nare  collected  in  the  name  of  the  Road  Fund,  but  are  consolidated  under  the  Government\u2019s \ncentral  budget  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  Road  Fund  Council,  with  the  responsibility  to \noversee  the  management  of  the  Road  Fund,  was  decreed  in  2003,  but  has  not  yet  met.  A \nclearer  and  predictable  financing  mechanism,  including  a  fully  functional  Road  Fund,  and \nrevisions  to  the  revenue  structure  and  sources  are  expected  when  the  RSDS  is  fully \nimplemented. \n \n10. \nThe  estimated  cost  of  implementing  the  RSDS  includes  (i)  $490  million  needed  for \nrehabilitating the remaining two key regional corridors, i.e., the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road and Osh\u2013\nIsfana road; and (ii) $48 million for annual maintenance of all MOTC-administered roads. While \nfunds  for  improvement  of  regional  corridors  will  be  sourced  mainly  from  international  financial \ninstitutions, financing road maintenance at the required level remains a challenge. However, it \nhas  increased  the  total  allocation  for  roads  11-fold  since  2000,  and  threefold  since  2005 \n(Table A2.3).  \n \n\n2000 \n38,919 \n74,339 \n16,683 \n131,941 \n\nTable A2.3: Budgetary Allocation to the Road Subsector, 2000\u20132007 \n(Som \u2018000) \n2003 \n93,219 \n99,996 \n29,624 \n224,842 \n\nItem \nCapital Investments \nRoad Maintenance \nAdministration \n \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n11. \nThe Government has invested nearly three times more in 2007 in comparison to 2004, \nand  donor  financing  has  increased  by  about  160%  (Table  A2.4).

The original allocation in 2003 was Som157.37 million.

In  2003,  an  additional  amount  of  Som67.5  million  was \nallocated  to  MOTC  (about  Som42million  for  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  and  Som26  million  for  the \nrest of the network). Over the years, the supplementary budget varied while the original budget \nremained relatively consistent. \n \n13. \nThe average road maintenance expenditure of the MOTC network is $375 per km,  but \nthe  distribution  is  skewed  toward  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road.  This  amount  is  far  lower  than  the \nquoted figure of $2,000 per km needed to maintain a road network adequately. Moreover, only \n20% of the maintenance work is routine, giving a very low average figure of $60 per km for the \nnetwork.  In  some  cases,  roads  have  deteriorated  so  much  that  the  size  of  potholes  does  not \npermit any further routine maintenance and major repairs are needed. \n \n14. \nThe  Bishkek\u2013Osh  Road  Directorate  accounts  for  about  10%  of  the  total  network  but \nreceives 40% of the annual budget allocation. On a per-kilometer basis, it means that in 2003 \nthe  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  spent  $1,327  per  km  while  over  the  rest  of  the  network  cost  only \n$257 per km.  \n \nE. \n\nSafety \n\nAccident statistics over the past 10 years are shown in Table A2.5. The rate of accidents \n15. \nhas increased from 15 accidents per 1,000 registered vehicles to 17, and fatalities from about \n3 per  1,000  registered  vehicles  to  5  from  2005  to  2007.  The  RSDS  is  aimed  at  changing  this \ntrend.  The  Permanent  Secretariat  for  Road  Safety,  established  in  2004  has  been  actively \nworking to revise existing road safety guidelines and prepare a National Road Safety Program, \nwhich is expected to be approved in 2009.  \n \n\nTable A2.5: Road Traffic Accidents \n\nYear \n\n1997 \n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n\nNumber of Road  \nAccidents \n2,993 \n2,864 \n2,665 \n2,670 \n3,122 \n2,966 \n3,380 \n3,275 \n3,717 \n3,911 \n4,692 \n\nNumber of \nInjuries \n3,710 \n3,453 \n3,304 \n3,292 \n3,808 \n3,561 \n4,091 \n3,969 \n4,568 \n4,948 \n6,223 \n\nNumber of \nFatalities \n\n685 \n585 \n584 \n610 \n703 \n725 \n897 \n892 \n893 \n1,051 \n1,252 \n\n         Source: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n\nRoad Transport Services \n\n16. \nPrivate firms carry more than 80% of the road-based freight and passenger traffic. Most \nstate-owned road transport operators were privatized and foreign road transport operators are \nallowed to set up their businesses. Domestic freight charges and bus fares are market based, \nbut  the  government  sets  the  urban  passenger  transport  fares,  and  cross-border  and \ninternational  transit  tariffs.

An  earlier  study  of  the \nfeasibility of rehabilitating this road showed that an investment of about $200 million would be \nneeded, and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) on the investment would be nearly 15% \nand  the  net  present  value  (NPV)  of  the  benefits  nearly  $40  million  over  the  25-year  life  of  the \nroad.  The  economic  analysis  examined  the  expected  contribution  of  the  project  road  to  the \ncountry and region, based on a comparison of with- and without-project scenarios in accordance \nwith  the  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Project  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB).2 The analysis covers 2009\u20132032, comprising 5 years of implementation and 20 years of \noperation, expressed in mid-2008 dollar prices.   \n \n2. \nThe  section  from  km  400  to  km  439  will  be  the  first  to  be  rehabilitated.  It  is  financed \nunder the CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project 3 (Project 1), financed \nby  ADB.  About  75  km  (km  365\u2013km  400  and  km  439\u2013km  479)  will  be  rehabilitated  under  the \npresent  project\u2014CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1  (Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road)  Project  2  (the \nProject)\u2014at  a  total  cost  of  $62.5  million,  which  would  include  a  customs  inspection  facility  at \nkm 479.  The  present  analysis  used  the  base  data  from  Project  1,  with  some  adjustments  to \ntraffic growth and rates and costs, to account for the economic slowdown since mid-2008.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nRoad  Condition. The Bishkek\u2013Torugart was divided into nine sections for the purpose \nof economic analysis. The basic characteristics of each section are summarized in Table A7.1. \nThe table also shows alternative routes (diversions), including (i) a parallel road to the Bishkek \nbypass (east) that passes through settlements until it reaches Buruldai junction at km 82, and \n(ii) a 65-km alternative route to the Kuvaki Pass section via the town of Balykchi. \n \n\nRoad Condition and Traffic \n\n                                                 \n1  One of the six CAREC regional corridors included in ADB. 2007.

The economic costs were estimated based on the financial cost of \nthe  capital  expenditure,  including  physical  contingencies,  but  excluding  price  contingencies, \ninterest  during  construction,  and  taxes  and  duties.  It  was  assumed  that  the  financial  crisis  of \n2008  has  not  had  a  significant  effect  on  costs  as  evidenced  by  the  current  prices  of  bitumen, \ncement,  steel,  etc.,  and  people\u2019s  value  of  time.  Using  a  world  price  numeraire,  non-tradable \ncosts were converted from financial to economic costs by applying a standard conversion factor \nof  0.85. 4  The  construction  period  of  the  project  road  was  estimated  based  on  the  project \nimplementation schedule. The least-cost option was selected among mutually exclusive project \nalternatives  and  various  pavement  treatment  options.  Options  analyzed  were  (i)  rehabilitation, \n(ii) partial reconstruction, and (iii) full reconstruction and new alternative alignments. In all cases, \npartial  and/or  full  reconstruction  of  the  road  within  the  existing  right-of-way  was  preferred, \ndepending on the existing condition of the road.

It  was  assumed  that  the  existing  gravel  and/or  paved  surfaces \nwould require about $1,200 per km annually for routine maintenance, and paved road sections \nwould  require  resealing  with  a  single  bituminous  layer  every  5\u20137  years  at  an  average  cost  of \n$35,000 per km. These rates are based on Project 1 data, which are not expected to change as \na result of the economic crisis.    \n \n9. \nRoad  User  Costs.  Vehicle  cost  data  by  vehicle  type  and  road  condition  of  each  road \nsection used in the Project for forecasting vehicle operating costs and road agency costs for the \nwith-  and  without-project  cases  were  used  in  the  present  analysis,  with  minor  modification  to \noperating costs to reflect lower gasoline prices compared with 2008.  \n \n10. \nAdditional benefits, such as savings in environmental and road accident costs, were not \ncalculated  as  there  is  no  reliable  data  and  the  current  level  of  traffic  on  the  project  road  is \nrelatively  low.  It  is  assumed  that  savings  that  could  be  accrued  from  these  contributors  are \ncurrently negligible.  \n\n                                                 \n4   Economic  conversion  factor  is  adopted  from  ADB.  2008.

The  aggregate  costs  and  benefits \nare  shown  in  Table  A7.5.  The  estimated  EIRR  over  the  20-year  service  life  is  12.8%  and  the \nNPV  is  $10.8  million.  However,  the  HDM  predicts  that  the  road  could  be  functional  at  a \ndiminishing level of service and benefits until the terminal year 2036. The EIRR reaches 14.4% \nand the NPV increases to $49.7 million when the terminal value is considered. The underlying \nassumptions  after  2030  are  (i)  traffic  growth  gradually  declines  to  6%  per  annum  in  line  with \ngross domestic product growth, and (ii) upkeep of the road becomes uneconomical and the road \nwill be allowed to deteriorate to a level until it is reconstructed in 2037. \n\n \nTable A7.5: Corridor Improvement Costs and Benefits \n($ million) \n\nNormal + Diverted \n\nEconomic Benefits \n \n\n Generated \n\nEconomic Costs \n\nCapital  Recurrent \n26.760 \n55.526 \n50.558 \n22.054 \n4.742 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n2.525 \n1.852 \n1.591 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n1.142 \n0.838 \n0.720 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n (7.040) \n161.269 \n\n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.168 \n0.269 \n0.323 \n0.288 \n0.257 \n0.230 \n0.205 \n0.183 \n0.164 \n0.146 \n0.130 \n0.116 \n0.104 \n0.093 \n0.083 \n0.074 \n0.066 \n0.059 \n0.053 \n0.047 \n3.059 \n \n\n \n\nVOC \n0.000 \n(2.777)\n(3.353)\n(0.392)\n3.683 \n8.490 \n8.501 \n8.692 \n7.830 \n7.189 \n7.665 \n7.258 \n6.870 \n7.377 \n7.577 \n8.300 \n7.376 \n5.587 \n6.593 \n6.145 \n6.450 \n6.405 \n4.050 \n5.272 \n130.787 \n\nTime \n0.000 \n(0.004) \n(0.005) \n0.001 \n0.064 \n0.078 \n0.082 \n0.084 \n0.062 \n0.063 \n0.064 \n0.066 \n0.068 \n0.069 \n0.073 \n0.077 \n0.075 \n0.050 \n0.048 \n0.034 \n0.032 \n0.031 \n0.029 \n0.050 \n1.191 \n\nVOC \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.104 \n0.267 \n0.711 \n0.718 \n0.729 \n0.667 \n0.612 \n0.646 \n0.620 \n0.588 \n0.624 \n0.647 \n0.711 \n0.623 \n0.487 \n0.576 \n0.530 \n0.563 \n0.561 \n0.355 \n0.456 \n11.795 \n\nTime \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n0.006 \n0.008 \n0.008 \n0.008 \n0.006 \n0.006 \n0.006 \n0.007 \n0.007 \n0.007 \n0.007 \n0.008 \n0.007 \n0.005 \n0.005 \n0.003 \n0.003 \n0.003 \n0.003 \n0.005 \n0.119 \n\nNet \nEconomic \nBenefit \n(16.721) \n(54.633) \n(51.602) \n(21.832) \n(0.485) \n10.450 \n9.618 \n12.099 \n11.973 \n5.377 \n7.258 \n7.614 \n7.557 \n8.510 \n8.414 \n10.655 \n8.241 \n5.291 \n6.967 \n6.931 \n7.196 \n8.000 \n4.437 \n12.824 \n14.139 \n12.80% \n\nNPV \nEIRR \n ( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, VOC = vehicle operating costs. \nNotes: 1.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Project  is  one  of  the  priority  infrastructure  projects  identified  in  the  Country  Development  Strategy  for  2007\u20132010 \n(formerly National Poverty Reduction Strategy).a It is also listed as a firm project in the country strategy and partnership for \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  in  2008.b  Both  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  Government  recognize  the  importance  of \nregional cooperation to the landlocked Kyrgyz Republic\u2014trade, transport, and energy are the priority areas for socioeconomic \ndevelopment. The government's and development agency strategies support the Government\u2019s approach to reducing poverty \nand  achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  by  balancing  social  goals  with  the  need  to  stimulate  growth  through \nimproving market access to rapidly growing neighboring markets and investing in agriculture to create economic opportunities \nin rural areas where most of the poor reside. The Project directly supports one of the goals in the country partnership strategy, \nwhich is to improve trade and road linkages with regional markets. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                 Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention - Geographic \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe Project is not a targeted poverty intervention. Nevertheless, by stimulating economic development, it will have significant \npoverty reduction impact and benefits. While the Project aims to facilitate regional trade and thereby benefit major businesses \nand those involved in trade and commerce, it will also benefit rural communities and especially the rural poor.  \n \n2. Design Features \n \nNo specific pro-poor design features are included under the Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Project  will indirectly  benefit more than 2 million people living in the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road corridor, 51% of  whom are \nwomen dominant in intra- and inter-oblast (province) trade and commercial activities in the Kyrgyz Republic. Two of the three \noblasts through which the road passes have poverty levels that are below the national average of 46%. Extreme poverty in \nthese  two  oblasts  is  almost  double  the  national  average  of  13.5%.  These  are  mainly  rural  oblasts  where  agriculture  is  the \nmain source of income for the residents. They consider improvement of the road to be critical for developing these areas.  \n \nRoad construction work would create several opportunities for direct and indirect employment over the 3-year implementation \nperiod. Thereafter, the maintenance work, which will be outsourced to national firms, will create longer-term employment and \nservice opportunities.   \n \nInformation  and  periodic  seminars  on  HIV  prevention  will  be  made  available  through  the  construction  company  to  people \ndirectly and indirectly associated with the projects as well as to residents of the project area. These outreach activities will be \ndesigned by the construction company and submitted to the Executing Agency (Ministry of Transport and Communications) \nfor  approval  as  part  of  the  health  and  safety  management  part  of  the  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  plan.  ADB  will \nreview and make specific recommendations, if necessary. The responsibility for preparing and implementing such a plan will \nbe an integral part of the construction contract.  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n39 \n\nB.

Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nDuring preparation of the stakeholder participation analysis, representatives of the Ministry of Transport and Communications \n(MOTC)  and  ADB\u2019s  consultants  carried  out  socioeconomic  surveys  and  held  public  meetings  at  village,  akimiat  (village \ncluster), and/or rayon (district) levels. These surveys and meetings raised awareness and gained local support. There were \nextensive  consultations  with  local  communities  at  Naryn  and  At-Bashi  in  selecting  the  final  road  alignment;  and  due \nconsideration  was  given  to  technical,  environmental,  social,  resettlement,  and  economic  impacts  of  the  selected  road \nalignment.  \n \nInitial consultation revealed that the Project will not negatively affect people\u2019s livelihoods, social and cultural habits, incomes, \nand the way of participating in socioeconomic development activities of the local communities. Therefore, the Project does not \ninvolve  sensitive  social  or  participatory  issues,  and  no  concerns  were  raised  by  the  interested  groups.  Project  stakeholders \nexpressed  support  for  the  Project.  Consultation  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation  to  address  implementation-\nrelated issues.  \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \n \nWhile women should benefit from the Project, some may be exposed to sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS because \ntemporary workers will be employed on the Project, and traffic and tourism are expected to increase. \n \n2.

The  main  purpose  is  to  rehabilitate  part  of  the  Bishkek\u2013\n1. \nTorugart road, which is a 539 kilometer (km) international road linking the Kyrgyz Republic with \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s Country Development and Road \nSector Development strategies for 2007\u201320101 identified rehabilitation of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nroad  as  one  of  the  priority  tasks  in  the  transport  sector.  Therefore,  the  Government,  acting \nthrough  its  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC),  has  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  donors  to  finance  upgrading  the  road  to  improve  safety, \nlower  vehicle  operating  costs,  improve  market  access  for  people  in  the  region,  and  increase \ntrade and transit links between the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC.  \n \n2. \nRehabilitation  will  be  done  in  phases.  The  first  phase  will  include  the  section  between \nthe  Dolon  Pass  and  Ak  Beit  Pass  (km  280\u2013km  480).  The  sections  from  Ak  Beit  to  the  border \nwith the PRC and from the Dolon Pass to Bishkek will be included in subsequent phases.  \n \n3. \nSummary  Initial  Environmental  Examination.  An  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE) of the first phase was made in 2008 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines.2 The IEE covered the sections (km 365\u2013km 400 and km 439\u2013km 479) to be improved \nunder the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart Road) Project 2 (the Project). This is the summary of the IEE report. \n \nScope  of  the  Initial  Environmental  Examination.  The scope included (i) collection of \n4. \ninformation  related  to  the  environmental  conditions  along  the  proposed  road  section, \n(ii) assessment  of  potential  environmental  impacts,  (iii)  development  of  preventive  and/or \nmitigation  measures  for  significant  impacts,  (iv)  assessment  of  alternative  alignments  and \ntechnologies,  (v)  elaboration  of  environmental  management  and  environmental  monitoring \nplans, and (vi) public consultation. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nType  and  Category  of  Project. The Project involves improvement of the existing road \nand  construction  of  inspection  facilities.  The  main  activities  include  (i)  earthwork  and  erosion \ncontrol,  (ii)  concrete  and  drainage  works,  (iii)  asphalt  concrete  works,  (iv)  traffic  safety \nmeasures, and (v) construction of inspection areas and buildings. No significant realignment of \nthe  centerline  is  expected,  which  would  encroach  on  previously  undisturbed  areas.  No \nconstruction and/or rehabilitation of feeder roads are included in the Project. The environmental \nclassification  for  the  Project  is  category  B  under  the  ADB  environmental  categorization \nrequirements.  \n \n6. \nLocation.  The  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  is  located  in  the  east\u2013central  part  of  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  links  its  capital  (Bishkek),  Issyk-Kul  and  Naryn  oblasts  (provinces),  and  Xingjian \nUygur Autonomous Region of the PRC. The IEE covers road sections located in Naryn and At-\nBashi rayons (districts) of Naryn oblast (Figure A9). \n \n\nProject Description \n\n                                                 \n1  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2007.

The road sections from the  Dolon Pass to the Ak Beit  Pass \nwill be rehabilitated as a two-lane road, with a carriageway width of 7 meters (m) and a roadbed \nwidth  of  15  m  (road  category  III,  according  to  Kyrgyz  Republic  road  standards  SNIP  2.05.02-\n85). 3 The  proposed  improvement  options  are  (i)  road  upgrading  on  the  existing  alignment; \n(ii) road safety (road markings, road signs, and guide posts); and (iii) reconstruction of a number \nof bridges and culverts. \n \n8. \nAlternatives  Considered.  If  the  no-action  alternative  is  adopted,  the  existing  road  will \ncontinue to deteriorate, transportation costs and travel times will continue to increase, and access of \nlocal  communities  to  markets  in  Bishkek  will  be  affected.  Alternatives  on  the  location  and  the \ntechnology of improving the Bishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart road suggested in previous projects were as \nfollows: \n \n\nProviding  a  bypass  of  Naryn  town  from  the  west.  This  alternative  was \ndetermined not feasible as it runs through a residential part of the town for 6.0\u2013\n7.5 km and can cause substantial noise and air pollution, and reduce road safety.  \n\n                                                 \n3   SNIP  is  a  Russian  abbreviation  for  \u201cconstruction  rules  and  regulations\u201d,  a  standard  that  extends  to  the  design  of \n\nnew roads and reconstruction of existing roads.   \n\n(i) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n43 \n\nLandslide-prone  area  at  Kyzyl-Bel  Pass  (km  355\u2013km  357).  Three  alternatives \nwere examined: providing a bypass of the landslide-prone section, a viaduct solution, \nand using the existing route. The Kyrgyz Design Institute, which is the design arm of \nMOTC, defined using the existing route in combination with geotechnical measures \ntoward landslide as the optimal alternative. \n\nProviding  a  bypass  of  the  At-Bashi  Ridge  from  the  east. This would require \nconstruction  of  a  long  section  of  new  road  through  a  remote  and  relatively \nundisturbed area. Construction of a new road was determined to be beyond the \nscope of the Project. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nC. \n \n9. \nThe  potentially  affected  environment  is  described  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines in terms of its physical, ecological, and socioeconomic resources, each \nof which is summarized below. \n \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n \n10. \nTopography.  The  section  is  located  within  the  mountain  system  of  the  Internal  Tien-\nShan.  The  section  begins  near  the  Dolon  Pass  (altitude  3,030  m)  at  km  280.  From  the  Dolon \nPass,  the  right-of-way  (ROW)  descends  to  the  Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk  Gorge  and  continues  to  the \nMiddle Naryn Valley, where it passes through the eastern part of Naryn town (altitude 2,100 m) \nand crosses the Naryn River. A few kilometers farther on, the section ascends to the Kyzyl Bel \nPass  (altitude  2,500  m)  and  Char  Pass  (2,600  m),  and  crosses  them  to  enter  the  At-Bashi \nValley. The section traverses the At-Bashi Valley parallel to the At-Bashi Ridge, until it reaches \nthe  western  part  of  the  ridge.  It  then  turns  south  and  ascends  to  the  Ak  Beit  Pass  (altitude \n3,284 m), crosses the northern branch of the At-Bashi Ridge, and continues down to the Arpa \nValley. The final point of the section is located at the Ak Beit Pass in the Arpa Valley at km 476. \n \n11. \nGeological and Seismic Characteristics. Geologically, the section is located within the \nMiddle Tien-Shan that is separated from the North Tien-Shan by so-called \u201cNikolaev line\u201d. The \nline  (fault)  crosses  the  section  several  kilometers  to  the  south  of  the  Dolon  Pass.  The  whole \nsection lies within the area where the probability of an earthquake is assessed as 82, i.e., two \nseismic events with a magnitude of 8 points on the Richter scale over 100 years. \n \nSoils and Permafrost. The project area comprises a number of soils that belong to soils \n12. \nof mountain slopes and soils of intermountain valleys: mountain meadow steppe subalpine soil, \nmountain  dark-chestnut  soil,  mountain  light-chestnut  soil,  mountain  valley  light-chestnut  soil, \nmountain  light-chestnut  soil,  mountain  valley  light-brown  soil,  and  mountain  meadow  steppe \nalpine soil. The top of the Dolon Pass (km 282\u2013km 283) and the Ak Beit Pass (km 464\u2013km 476) \nare located within island permafrost distribution areas. \n \n13. \nClimate  and  Air  Quality. The climate in the Internal Tien-Shan is continental with little \nrain, cool summers, and cold winters. Climatic conditions vary considerably with elevation. The \naverage winter temperature ranges from \u201325\u00b0\u0421 to \u201345\u00b0\u0421 (the lowest may exceed \u201354\u00b0\u0421), while \nin  summer  it  varies  from  20\u00b0\u0421  to  30\u00b0\u0421.  In  winter,  frosts  occur  in  all  regions.  Rain  and  snow \nusually  fall  in  autumn,  winter,  and  spring.  Average  yearly  precipitation  is  230\u2013560  millimeters. \nThe  air  quality  is  generally  good,  except  on  un-surfaced  sections  where  dust  generated  from \npassing  vehicles  was  observed.  There  are  no  ambient  air  quality  monitoring  stations  near  the \nsection. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n14. \nHydrology. The alignment crosses the River Naryn, the largest in the Kyrgyz Republic, \nas well as two other major rivers, the At-Bashi and the On-Archa. On  descent from the Dolon \nPass, it runs parallel to the Karaunkur and Ottuk rivers. High groundwater tables occur in Kara-\nSuu  and  Ottuk  villages.  An  initial  visual  assessment  suggests  that  water  quality  is  good.  This \nappears to be confirmed by reports that the rivers support a healthy and diverse population of \nfish  and  macroinvertebrates.  Chemical  analysis  and  analysis  of  macrozoobenthos  in  major \nrivers  of  the  project  area  was  carried  out  as  part  of  the  environmental  assessment.  The \nchemical  analysis  of  samples  from  the  Naryn,  At-Bashi,  On-Archa,  and  Karaunkur  rivers  was \nconducted in the laboratory of the Kyrgyz Agency on Hydrometeorology. It was concluded that \nthe  water  quality  of  all  the  samples  was  good,  and  pollutant  concentrations  were  within \nacceptable standards. The presence of a diverse range of macrozoobenthos species supports \nthis finding. \n \n15. \nNatural  Hazards.  Natural  hazards  related  to  the  section  include  landslides,  mudflows \nand  seasonal  flooding,  rockfalls,  and  avalanches.  The  section  is  susceptible  to  a  massive \nlandslide in the proximity of the Kyzyl\u2013Bel Pass at km 355\u2013km 356. The possibility of mudflow \nexists  at  km  300,  306,  312,  451,  and  455.  At  km  60,  the  ROW  is  currently  destroyed  by  a \nmudflow.  Rockfalls  can  pose  a  risk  to  the  section  at  km  285\u2013km  303  and  km  354\u2013km  355. \nAvalanche-prone areas are located in the Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk Gorge at km 287\u2013km 313, and the \nKyzyl\u2013Bel and Char passes at km 353\u2013km 362. \n \n16. \nNoise  and  Vibration.  The  majority  of  the  alignment  runs  through  areas  with  no \nsettlements,  but  only  mountains,  hills,  and  open  steppe.  Rare  settlements  through  which  the \nroad  corridor  runs  are  Naryn  town  and  the  villages  of  Karaunkur,  Ottuk,  Kara-Suu,  and \nKarabulung. Although no sensitive receptors such as schools and hospitals were noted near the \nROW, noise and vibration are a serious concern to the communities; this was raised repeatedly \nduring public consultations. Dwellings are typically made of clay brick. For those located close to \nthe roadside, noise and vibration from heavy trucks have the potential to affect the houses and \ntheir  occupants  significantly.  In  addition,  it  was  noted  during  the  field  investigations  that  the \nactual  speed  of  vehicles  passing  through  the  settlements  often  exceed  the  speed  limits.  This \ncontributes to safety and noise problems. \n \n\nEcological Resources \n\n2. \n \n17. \nFlora.  The  distribution  of  flora  in  the  project  area  fulfills  the  vertical  zoning  rule. \nSubalpine  meadows  are  typical  of  the  Dolon  Pass.  At  lower  altitudes,  they  change  to  fescue \nsteppe, artemisia deserts, and cropland near Naryn town. Fescue steppe occurs to the south of \nNaryn. The At-Bashi Valley is largely cropland, which changes to fescue steppe in the western \npart of the valley. In the Ak Beit Pass area, the flora is typical high-altitude meadow steppe. In \nthe  Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk  Gorge,  the  road  passes  through  areas  of  Naryn  forestry  with  floodplain \nand slope forests. \n \n18. \n \n\nFauna.

Twenty-two  ecosystems  are  distinguished  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and \nseven  of  them  were  found  in  the  project  area.  An  assessment  of  ecosystems  health  by \nbiological  indicators  (in  points,  from  1  =  poor  to  3  =  excellent)  was  undertaken  as  part  of  this \nIEE.

The section does not run through any especially protected area. One \n21. \nprotected  area  is  found  close  to  the  project  area\u2014the  Salkyn\u2013Tor  State  Natural  Park,  several \nkilometers  to  the  east  of  the  road  corridor  (Figure  A9).  According  to  International  Union  for \nConservation of Nature classification, a national park (category II) is a protected area managed \nmainly for ecosystem protection and recreation.  \n\n \n\nland  of \n\nindustry, \n\nland;  (iii) \n\nland;  (ii)  settlement \n\nSocioeconomic Resources \n\n3. \n \nIndustry and Agriculture. Industry in Naryn oblast is represented by the electric power \n22. \nindustry,  mining,  food  processing,  and  the  construction  materials  industry.  Naryn  oblast  is  an \nimportant agricultural region, specifically in animal agriculture. It supports a large population of \nsheep and horses. In 2005, the industrial production of Naryn oblast was Som754.1 million and \nagricultural production was Som4,786.1 million. \n \n23. \nTourism.  Naryn  oblast  has  vast  tourist  potential  that  is  presently  not  exploited.  Major \ntourist  attractions  in  Naryn  oblast  are  Tash-Rabat  (a  caravanserai  dating  to  the  15th  century), \nthe site of the ancient town of Koshoi-Korgon, and the high-altitude Song-Kul Lake.  \n \nLand  Use.  The  Land  Code  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  specifies  the  following  land-use \n24. \ncategories:  (i)  agricultural \ntransport, \ncommunication,  defense,  and  other  nonagricultural  purposes;  (iv)  lands  of  specially  protected \nnatural  territories;  (v)  forest  land;  (vi)  water  land;  and  (vii)  reserve  land.  The  land  use  in  the \nproject  area  is  mostly  agricultural;  pasturelands  are  prevalent  in  mountain  areas,  while \ncroplands  are  prevalent  in  the  valleys.  The  Law  on  Highways  specifies  the  category  \u201cland  of \nroad transport\u201d. \n \n25. \nNon-Transport  Infrastructure.  Infrastructure  within  the  section  is  represented  by \nelectric  power  lines,  telecommunication  lines,  water  supply  systems,  irrigation  systems,  and \ncanalization  systems.  As  the  section  crosses  non-transport  infrastructure  in  Naryn  and  other \nportions of the project area, coordination with the relevant authorities will be required. \n \n26. \nTransport  Networks.  The  Bishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart  road  is  an  international  road \ncorridor and one of two roadways linking the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC. On a larger scale, \nthe  road  is  part  of  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1  linking  Kashi  in  the  PRC  to  Almaty  in \nKazakhstan. \n \nreported  as \n27. \n266,500 people (2006), the majority of whom (82.2%) live in rural areas. Communities served by \nthe  road  include  Karaunkur,  Ottuk,  and  Naryn  (in  Naryn  rayon),  and  At-Bashi,  Kara-Suu,  and \nKarabulung (in At-Bashi rayon) villages. Karaunkur (km 295) is a small village comprising about \n10 houses located in Karaunkur Gorge. There is one three-storey building and several clay-brick \ndwellings.  Ottuk  (km  314\u2013km  316)  is  a  larger  settlement  with  a  population  of  about \n1,300 people.  Houses  are  mostly  made  of  clay  brick.  Naryn  town  (km  347\u2013km  352)  with  a \npopulation of about 40,000 is the largest settlement. This stretch has both multi-storey buildings \nand small dilapidated houses. At-Bashi (population 11,300) is a rayon center several kilometers \nfrom  the  alignment.  Other  settlements  in  the  project  area  are  Kara-Suu  (km  410)  with  a \npopulation  of  4,540,  and  Karabulung  (km  417)  with  1,508  inhabitants;  the  alignment  runs \nthrough both villages. People usually use clay brick to build their houses. Ak Beit is a very small \nvillage  of  five  houses  at  km  464.  The  ethnic  composition  in  the  project  area  is  homogeneous \nand consists of virtually only Kyrgyz people.  \n \n\nPopulation  and  Communities.  Naryn  oblast\u2019s  population  was \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n47 \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nCultural  and  Historical  Heritage. According to the List of Historical and Cultural Sites \n28. \nof National Significance, there are 12 historical and archeological sites in Naryn rayon and 28 in \nAt-Bashi rayon. Although none of the sites are located within the ROW, some of them are within \nseveral kilometers of it. There are also about 10 Muslim graveyards in the proximity of the road.  \n \nD. \n \n29. \nPotential  impacts  have  been  identified  by  reviewing  each  relevant  parameter  and \nscreening out insignificant impacts from those that can have significant adverse impacts in the \nconstruction and operation phases of the Project. It was concluded that implementation of the \nProject  will  have  significant  social  benefits  and,  if  the  prescribed  mitigation  and  management \nmeasures are fully implemented, it is unlikely to have major adverse environmental impacts. \n\n \n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n  \n\n b.\n\na.  \n\nTopography \n\nSoil and Permafrost \n\n \n \nImpacts.  Topographic  impacts  could  occur  because  of  altered  road  embankments, \n\n30. \nborrow-pit excavations, and quarry operations.  \n \n31.  Mitigation. No significant cut and fill operations are required, so no significant impacts to \ntopographic characteristics are anticipated.  \n \n \n \n32. \nImpacts.  Soil  impacts  may  occur  because  of  altered  road  embankments,  borrow-pit \nexcavations,  and  quarry  operations.  However,  no  significant  cut  and  fill  operations  are \nanticipated.  Provided  that  erosion  prevention  measures  in  the  construction  and  operation \nphases are taken, no substantial adverse impacts to soils are foreseen. No long-term impacts to \narea  soils  caused  by  increased  pollutant  levels  are  anticipated.  The  permafrost  island  areas \noccur at altitudes of more than 3,000 m, so potential impacts to the permafrost areas are likely \nto  occur  during  the  construction  and  operation  phases  near  the  Dolon  (km  282\u2013km  283)  and \nAk Beit passes (km 364\u2013km 376).  \n \n33.  Mitigation. Mitigation measures include integration of the geocryological considerations \ninto the detailed design by surveying at the pre-project stage the current condition of permafrost \nat  the  Dolon  and  Ak  Beit  passes,  identifying  and  mapping  areas  of  concern  (if  any),  and \ndeveloping mitigation measures. The mitigation measures may include the avoidance of areas \nwith degraded permafrost and engineering measures.  \n \n \n \n34. \nbut no significant violations of standards are anticipated amid the provisions noted below.  \n \n35.  Mitigation. Contracts will require asphalt and hot-mix plants to be located at least 500 m \nfrom the nearest sensitive receptor (e.g., schools, hospitals, or communities), and they will not \nbe located within sensitive ecosystems. Operators will be required to install emission controls. \nBlasting  (if  any)  will  be  carried  out  using  small  charges,  and  dust-generating  items  will  be \nconveyed  under  cover.  Road  surfaces  and  excavation  and  construction  sites  will  be  sprayed \nwith  water  to  keep  them  moist  for  dust  control.  Trucks  carrying  earth,  sand,  or  stone  will  be \n\nImpacts. Air quality impacts could occur in both the construction and operation phases, \n\nAir Quality \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n\nd.  \n\nSurface and Groundwater \n\ncovered with tarpaulins to avoid spillage. Contracts will require pre-construction and routine air \nquality monitoring. Construction sites, asphalt plants, quarries, and transportation roads will be \nmonitored  for  total  suspended  particles  during  the  construction  phase.  An  ambient  air  quality \nmonitoring  station  will  be  set  up  in  Naryn  town  to  monitor  pollution  in  the  vicinity  of  the  road \ncorridor in the operation phase. (Currently, there is no ambient air quality station in Naryn.) The \nupgraded road will improve air quality and reduce dust emissions, as the sections of road that \ndo not have an asphalt surface will be upgraded and covered with asphalt. \n \n \n \n36. \nImpacts. Surface water impacts could occur during the construction period as a result of \nthe  erosion  and  construction  activities.  Provided  that  road  drainage  systems  are  improved, \nenhancement of water quality can occur at the operation phase. No impacts are anticipated to \navailability of water for domestic or agricultural use, except in Naryn town where water supply \npipelines  may  be  temporarily  impacted  during  construction.  Potential  impacts  to  local  water \nsupplies  include  the  possibility  of  temporary  labor  camps  wastewater  disposal  during  the \nconstruction  period.  No  impacts  to  groundwater  resources  are  anticipated  as  a  result  of  the \nproposed activities in the road corridor in either the construction or operation phases.  \n \n37.  Mitigation. The Project will install adequately sized drainage facilities to accommodate \nforeseeable flood levels, and will stabilize downstream slopes with concrete or rock gabions or \nwalls  to  avoid  erosion.  Potential  adverse  impacts  to  the  surface  hydrology  in  the  construction \nphase  of  the  Project  will  be  avoided  through  the  enforcement  of  contract  provisions.  Such \nprovisions will ensure that construction camps and other potential sources of secondary impacts \nare  properly  sited  and  provided  with  drainage  and  wastewater  facilities.  Water  quality  will  be \nmonitored by chemical analysis and bio-indicators during construction and operational phases. \nMonitoring points will be located at the Karaunkur, Ottuk, On-Archa, Naryn, and At-Bashi rivers. \n \n \n \n38. \nImpact.  Landslides,  rockfalls,  avalanches,  and  mudflows  may  be  triggered  by  different \nnatural  and  anthropogenic  factors,  pose  hazards  to  people  and  infrastructure,  and  may  block \nroads.  \n \n39.  Mitigation.  For  the  landslide-prone  area  (km  355\u2013km  357),  the  Design  Institute \nproposes  using  the  existing  road  in  combination  with  the  geotechnical  measures.  Mitigation \nmeasures  for  rockfall-prone  areas  will  include  installation  of  rockfall  retaining  structures  and \nrockfall warning signs as will be decided in the detailed design stage of the Project. Mudflows \nwill  be  mitigated  by  installation  of  box  culverts.  Artificial  release  of  avalanches  with  artillery  (a \ncommonly used method for avalanche control in the Kyrgyz Republic) will be used. \n \n \n \n40. \nImpacts.  According  to  local  people  from  Karaunkur,  Ottuk,  Kara-Suu,  and  Karabulung \nvillages  living  in  proximity  to  the  road,  noise  and  vibration  have  an  impact  on  their  houses. \nSpecial concern is expressed over overloaded trucks transporting cargo to and from the PRC.  \n \n \n \n \n\nNoise and Vibration \n\nNatural Hazards \n\ne. \n\nf. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n49 \n\n41.  Mitigation.  A  survey  that  includes  baseline  instrumental  measurements  of  noise  and \nvibration levels and a damage susceptibility study will be conducted, along with inspection of the \npresent  condition  of  houses,  at  the  preconstruction  stage.  In  case  of  excessive  noise  or \nvibration  levels,  remedial  measures\u2014such  as  special  road  surface  design,  noise  barriers, \nplanting trees, or anti-vibration layers\u2014will be used along with monitoring. \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\n b.\n\nFlora \n\nFauna \n\n \n \n \n42. \nImpact.  No  threatened  or  endangered  plant  species  are  located  in  the  potentially \naffected  ROW  and  no  adverse  impacts  to  such  species  are  likely  to  occur  as  a  result  of  the \nrehabilitation activities. Plant species present within the ROW are either introduced species or \nubiquitous native species, which are highly tolerant of grazing, compaction, and other physical \ndisturbances. Construction activities will affect only a narrow band of vegetation adjacent to the \nexisting road. No substantial removal of trees or other vegetation is anticipated. \n  \n43.  Mitigation.  The  Project  will  include  roadside  planting  to  ensure  slope  stabilization. \nExisting trees and roadside plants will be retained. Topsoil from borrow-pit areas will be saved \nand reused.  \n \n \n \n44. \nImpact.  Habitat  fragmentation  as  well  as  accidents  involving  wildlife  can  occur  as  a \nresult  of  blocking  wildlife  migration  routes  near  the  Dolon  and  Ak  Beit  passes.  Construction \ncamp workers and drivers can contribute to poaching or hunting wildlife.  \n \n45.  Mitigation.  Mitigation  will  include  an  extended  study  of  wildlife  migratory  routes  during \nthe detailed design stage, and providing findings on the exact locations of routes and behavior \nof  wildlife,  together  with  recommendations  on  specific  mitigation  measures  to  the  project \nimplementation  unit.  Clauses  should  be  written  into  construction  contracts  resulting  in \nimmediate dismissal and prosecution of individuals involved in poaching and wildlife hunting. \n \n \n \n46. \nImpact.  The  field  assessment  of  ecosystems  conducted  within  the  frame  of  the  IEE \nshows  that,  whereas  no  significant  impacts  are  anticipated  for  mid-mountain  steppe  and \nmeadow  ecosystems  as  they  have  already  experienced  broad-scale  changes  as  a  result  of \novergrazing,  mid-mountain  floodplain  and  meadow  ecosystems  in  the  Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk  Gorge \nand sub-alpine ecosystems (Dolon and Ak Beit passes) are at a greater risk of degradation.  \n \n47.  Mitigation. Mitigation measures to reduce risks posed to ecosystem health include siting \nof  construction  camps,  asphalt  plants,  and  other  related  facilities  outside  environmentally \nsensitive areas.  \n \n \n \n48. \nImpact.  No  direct  impacts  to  the  Salkyn-Tor  State  National  Park  are  anticipated.  The \nProject  could  have  an  indirect  impact  on  the  national  park  by  attracting  more  tourists.  The \npotential impact is perceived as beneficial and within the environmental management capacities \nof the national park administration. \n\nProtected Areas \n\nEcosystems \n\n c.  \n\nd. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nc. \n\na. \n\nb. \n\nInternational Trade \n\nSocioeconomic Resources \n\nIndustry, Agriculture, and Services \n\n3. \n \n \n \nImpact.  The  improvement  of  the  road  is  anticipated  to  have  positive  impacts  for \n49. \ninternational  trade  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  PRC  and  other  countries  by \ndecreasing transportation costs and travel time. Modernization of the customs infrastructure and \ncomplementary  measures  from  the  Government  to  improve  customs  procedures\u2014such  as \nenforcement  of  overloading  regulations,  longer  hours  of  operation,  and  introduction  of  one-\nwindow  operation  whereby  all  transactions  are  undertaken  together\u2014will  facilitate  border \ncrossing and result in decreased transportation costs and travel time. \n \n \n \n50. \nImpact. The improved road and modernization of customs facilities and procedures will \nenhance import and export opportunities for industries and facilitate connectivity and access of \nagricultural producers to Bishkek and Issyk-Kul oblast markets. It will have a positive impact on \nthe construction materials industry. Agricultural producers will have better access to the markets \nof Bishkek and Issyk-Kul oblast.  \n \n51.  Mitigation.  To  gain  the  most  benefit  from  the  Project,  training  on  the  development  of \nroadside  businesses  should  be  organized  for  the  local  population,  and  microcredit  programs \nlaunched as complementary projects.  \n \n \n \n52. \nImpact. The improved road and modernized customs facilities and procedures will have \na  positive  impact  on  tourism  development.  Tourists  traveling  from  and  to  PRC  will  have  more \ncomfortable  and  faster  travel,  and  local  tourist  attractions  will  be  more  accessible.  The  local \npopulation  will  benefit  from  increased  activity  such  as  hotel  business,  horse  rental,  handicraft \ntrade, and entrance fees collected from tourists. Provided that the tourist season lasts only for \n3\u20134  months,  the  potential  of  tourist  attractions  is  still  far  from  being  fully  exploited;  even  if \nincreasing  number  of  tourists  visit  the  area,  it  can  be  concluded  that  no  adverse  impacts  are \nanticipated in the foreseeable future.  \n \n53.  Mitigation.  To  maximize  the  benefits  of  the  Project,  rehabilitation  of  the  road  corridor \nshould  be  complemented  with  projects  on  the  facilitation  of  border-crossing  procedures  for \ntourists,  and  development  of  ecotourism  ventures.  Tourist-oriented  road  signage  should  be \nintroduced. \n \n \n \n54. \nImpact.  Detours  and  traffic  inconveniences  will  occur  during  construction.  Following \nconstruction, the primary transport impact of the Project will be to improve the performance of \nthe transport sector and greatly facilitate the flow of traffic, goods, and travelers.  \n \n55.  Mitigation.  Care  will  be  taken  during  the  construction  period  to  ensure  that  traffic \ndisruptions to road transport are minimized. Traffic management plans should be prepared. \n \n \n \n\nTransport Networks \n\nTourism \n\nd. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nf. \n\ne. \n\ng. \n\nHealth and Road Safety \n\nPopulation and Communities \n\nCultural and Historical Heritage \n\nImpact. No adverse impacts on settlement patterns and communities are anticipated.  \n\n \n \n56. \nImpact.  Improvement  of  the  road  corridor  will  contribute  to  a  safer  journey  and  a \nreduction  in  the  number  of  road  accidents,  and  will  facilitate  access  to  advanced  oblast  and \nnational health services. However, the improved road will increase vehicle operating speeds on \nthe road and, if not controlled, accidents involving people and livestock may increase.  \n \n57.  Mitigation.  In  Naryn,  Karaunkur,  Ottuk,  Kara-Suu,  and  Kara-Bulung,  provisions  should \nbe made for paved shoulders, road signage and speed limits, and service roads for local traffic.  \n \n \n \n58. \n \n59.  Mitigation.  Opportunities  for  complementary  actions  to  strengthen  the  community \naspects of the project area are addressed by the social assessment. In summary, they include \ntraining for people (especially women) living along the road on new opportunities opened by the \nimproved  road  such  as  roadside  trade,  tourist  accommodation,  and  microcrediting  of  roadside \nbusinesses. \n \n \n \n60. \nImpact.  No  impacts  to  archaeological  and  historic  resources  are  anticipated,  with  the \nexception  of  a  graveyard  (km  314)  located  close  to  the  alignment  that  may  be  affected  by \nvibration.  \n \n61.  Mitigation.  No  mitigation  related  to  known  cultural  resources  is  warranted.  Contract \nprovisions  are  recommended  to  ensure  that  construction  works  are  suspended,  local \nadministration  and  state  organizations  on  cultural  heritage  are  informed,  and  all  necessary \nmeasures  to  protect  cultural  resources  are  taken  in  the  event  of  unexpected  discoveries.  The \nfencing of the graveyard located at km 314 should be strengthened. \n \nE. \n \n62. \nLegal and Institutional Framework. According to the Law on Environmental Expertise, \nany  project  activities  should  be  preceded  by  preparation  and  submission  of  an  assessment  of \nenvironmental  impacts  (OVOS  [Russian  acronym]),  and  its  approval  by  Ecological  Expertise \n(State  Environmental  Review).  The  OVOS  documentation  should  include  endorsements  from \nlocal  administration;  sanitary  control  bodies;  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Water  Resources  and \nProcessing  Industry;  and  other  organizations\u2014depending  on  environmental  attributes  affected \nby the Project. \n \n63. \nInstitutional  Requirements.  The  Investment  Projects  Implementation  Department \n(IPID) will be responsible for ensuring that environmental procedures are incorporated in each \nstage of the work\u2014such as document tender and contract preparation, bid reviews and awards, \nand  supervision  of  preconstruction  baseline  monitoring\u2014as  an  integral  part  of  construction \nsupervision.  \n \n \n \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nIPID  will  be  responsible  for  overall  contract  administration  and  day-to-day  project \n64. \nsupervision, including environmental management. An environment and/or social officer will be \nappointed  within  IPID  to  be  responsible  for  ensuring  the  environmental  management  plan, \nincluding  monitoring  requirements,  are  implemented  effectively.  The  construction  supervision \nconsultant will assist IPID in its responsibilities, including instrumental environmental monitoring \nof the Project.  \n \n65. \nEnvironmental  Monitoring  Program.  The environmental monitoring program includes \nroutine  site  inspections  and  reporting  related  to  soil  and  erosion  control;  embankment  and \nerosion  protection;  borrow-pit  restoration;  noise,  vibration,  air,  and  water  quality  monitoring \n(including  baseline  and  routine  periodic  water  quality  monitoring);  and  terrestrial  and/or  river \necosystem health monitoring. Specific monitoring provisions include the following:  \n \n\nWater  quality.  Baseline  and  periodic  water  quality  monitoring.  This  will  be \ncomplemented with monitoring of water quality by macrozoobenthos (once a year \nfor 2 years). \n\nAir quality. Baseline and periodic air quality monitoring.  \n\n(iii) \n\nNoise.

Informal consultations with the local \npopulation in Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung villages, and with representatives of \nnongovernment  organizations  were  held  in  Bishkek.  A  stakeholder  workshop  for  local \nadministrations  of  Naryn  and  At-Bashi  rayons  was  conducted  on  16  June  2008.  In  addition, \nconsultations with experts from the Ministry of Emergency Situations Ministry of Transport and \nCommunications,  and  Academy  of  Sciences  were  held.  The  comments  from  previous  large \nstakeholder  workshops  conducted  in  Naryn  and  Bishkek  in  2006  were  used  to  assess  the \nactuality of the problem. \n \n68. \n \n\nA summary of the opinions of the public consultations is as follows: \n\nThe local population supports the upgrading of the road corridor provided that it \nwill bring more socioeconomic benefits to the local population. \n\nFeeder roads were proposed by locals to be included in the Project, specifically two \nroads  connecting  rayon  center  At-Bashi  and  EM-07,  and  the  main  street  in  Naryn \nthat is a part of the road linking Ak-Talaa rayon and Tash-Bashat village. \n\nBecause of safety and noise/vibration issues, it was proposed that consideration \nbe given to bypasses of Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung villages. \n\nNoise  and  vibration  issues  were  the  major  concern  in  Ottuk,  Kara-Suu,  and \nKarabulung villages and Naryn town. The recent letter from the people of Ottuk to \nMOTC repeatedly raised these issues.  \n\n(v) \n\nLocal people should be involved in the road construction. \n\n \nG. \n\n69. \n \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n \nThe findings of the IEE are as follows: \n\nConstruction activities under the Project will be largely of a rehabilitation nature \nwithin  the  previously  disturbed  road  corridor  and  no  significant  environmental \nimpacts are anticipated. \n\nThe  study  of  ecosystems  health  conducted  in  the  frame  of  this  IEE  showed  that \nthere  are  ecosystems  in  the  project  area  that  are  more  sensitive  to  environmental \nimpacts\u2014specifically,  mid-mountain floodplain and  meadow  ecosystems located  in \nthe Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk gorge, and subalpine ecosystems (Dolon and Ak Beit passes). \n\nAccording to the local people from Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung \nvillages living in proximity to the road, noise and vibration have an impact on their \nhouses.  However,  visual  examination  showed  that  the  houses  are  located \noutside the ROW, and the major problem is probably related to overloaded trucks \nand their noncompliance with the 30 km per hour speed limit.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  examination  of  baseline  water  quality  in  rivers  of  the  project  area  by \nchemical analysis and a bio-indicators survey undertaken within the frame of the \nIEE showed that water quality is good. \n\n \nThe following recommendations are proposed based on the findings of the IEE: \n\nEnvironmental  provisions  in  contract.  Specific  environmental  provisions  are \nrecommended  for  inclusion  in  contract  documents,  including  provisions  related \nbut not limited to (a) erosion control and air and water quality control; (b) location \nof asphalt plants, construction camps, and other facilities (not in environmentally \nsensitive areas indicated above); (c) borrow-pit restoration; (d) quarry operations; \n(e)  safety  provisions;  (f)  baseline  and  routine  monitoring  of  air  quality,  water \nquality, noise, and ecosystem health; and (g) community relations. \n\nEnvironmental monitoring. Baseline noise, vibration, and air quality monitoring \nis recommended at the preconstruction stage in settlements along the road. \n\nCapacity  building  for  environmental  management.  A  training  program  for \nselected  staff,  and  addressed  to  the  goals  and  techniques  of  environmental \nmanagement activities in road projects, is recommended. \n\n70. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\nis \n\nto \n\nH. \n\n(iv) \n\nthe \n\ninternational \n\nroad  corridor \n\nRecommended  complementary  projects.  A  training  program  to  ensure  that \nlocal businesses and populations will be able to use all the benefits provided by \nbeing  adjacent \nrecommended.  A \ncomplementary  project  to  increase  the  attractiveness  of  the  Salkyn-Tor  State \nNational Park for ecotourists is recommended.  \n \nConclusions \n \n71. \nThe  Project  will  have  significant  social  benefits  and,  if  the  prescribed  mitigation  and \nmanagement  measures  are  fully  implemented,  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  have  major  adverse \nenvironmental \nimpacts.  An  environmental  monitoring  plan  has  been  prepared  and \nresponsibilities  for  implementation  assigned.  A  budget  has  been  allocated  for  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring. A full environmental impact assessment under ADB guidelines is \nnot required. \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 11 May 2009) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "som (Som) \n \n$0.023 \nSom43.0999 \n", "Som1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nADF \nCAREC \nEA \nEIRR \nEMP \nICB \nIEE \nIPID \nKHM \nMOES \nMOTC \nNPV \nPIU \nPPMS \nPRC \nQBS \nQCBS \nROW \nRSDS \nSAEPF \nSSS \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nInvestment Projects Implementation Department \nKyrgyz Agency on Hydrometeorology \nMinistry of Emergency Situations \nMinistry of Transport and Communications \nnet present value \nproject implementation unit \nproject performance management system \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nquality-based selection \nquality- and cost-based selection \nright-of-way \nRoad Sector Development Strategy \nState Agency for Environmental Protection and Forestry \nsingle source selection \ntechnical assistance \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "NOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", "X.
