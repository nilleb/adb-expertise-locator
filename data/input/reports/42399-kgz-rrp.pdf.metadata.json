The  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1 \n(Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road)  is  an  important  regional  route  linking  the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) to Central Asia and Europe. The \nroad will be improved under individual investment projects. Project 1 \nwas approved in 2008 to rehabilitate 39 kilometers (km) of the road. \nThis submission is for Project 2 (the Project). The Project has two \ncomponents\u2014a  physical  and  a  nonphysical  one.  The  physical \ncomponent will rehabilitate 75 km and construct a facility to manage \ncross-border passenger and freight movements to and from the PRC. \nThe  cross-border  facility  covers  customs,  immigration,  health  and \nquarantine, security, and other functions. It will be located close to km \n479 (about 60 km inland from the border crossing at Torugart). \n \nThe nonphysical component will help with training and will cater for the \ntransport sector master plan. It includes an industry-university program \nto  improve  the  transport  project  management  skills  of  engineering \ngraduates. The program includes (i) up to five summer internships at \nthe Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) for students \nseeking a career in transport, and (ii) at least two short courses in \ntransport engineering and project management.   \n   \nRationale  The  Project  will  facilitate  trade  and  improve  national  and  regional \nconnectivity. More than 70% of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s trade is regional\u2014\nwith Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and PRC\u2014and 50% moves by \nroad. However, the corridor is in poor condition and vehicles can travel at \nonly an estimated average speed of 50 km per hour, and are frequently \ninterrupted by snow and rain. Rehabilitating the road will increase speed \nand  reliability  of  passenger  and  freight  flows  and  create  business \nopportunities  in  the  adjacent  area,  one  of  the  poorest  parts  of  the \ncountry. The investment will also cut transport costs. ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project\u2019s  primary  impact  will  be  increased  regional  trade, \nparticularly between the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC, which will lead \nto less poverty in Naryn oblast (province). Its main outcomes will be \nhigher accessibility and mobility. \n   \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $62.5  million, \nPlan   including taxes and duties of $6 million. \n \nAmount \nItem \n($ million) \nCivil works  42.5 \nConsulting Services  3.0 \nDuties and Taxes  6.0 \nContingencies  10.0 \nFinance Charges  1.0 \nTotal  62.5 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nFinancing Plan   Amount \nSource  % \n($ million)   \nAsian Development Bank Grant  22.0    35.0 \nAsian Development Bank Loan  28.0    45.0 \nGovernment  12.5    20.0 \nTotal    62.5     100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  ADB will provide a grant not exceeding $22.0 million and a loan of $28 \nmillion equivalent (Special Drawing Rights 18,492,000) from its Special \nFunds resources to finance the Project. The proposed grant and loan \nwill finance 80% of the cost. The Government will provide counterpart \nfinancing of $12.5 million to cover taxes and duties, part of the civil \nworks for border infrastructure development. \n \nPeriod of Utilization   Until 30 June 2014 \n   \nEstimated  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) \n   \nImplementation  The project implementation unit (PIU) established within MOTC, which \nArrangements  is managing Project 1, will oversee and manage the second Project. \nMOTC will strengthen the PIU\u2019s current team of 10 professionals within \nthe  next  2 years.  Many  team  members  are  knowledgeable  in \ninternational best practices and ADB polices and procedures. They will \nbe responsible for managing the procurement of goods, works, and \nservices; administering contracts; and project arrangements. No major \nsocial  and  environmental  impacts  have  resulted  from  past  road \nprojects. However, as the road network expands and traffic increases, \nbetter planning, designing, and monitoring will be needed to manage \nimpacts  during  and  after  construction.  MOTC  will  recruit  relevant ", "  iii\nsafeguard specialists to the PIU. Action plans will be prepared in these \nareas, executed during the Investment Program period (i.e. through a \nseries of projects in support of the corridor). These actions will deliver \nsafeguard and gender mainstreaming content.  \n \n  ADB has assigned a team (combining staff from headquarters and the \nKyrgyz  Resident  Mission)  to  manage  this  and  other  ongoing  road \nsector activities in the Kyrgyz Republic. This team will work with the \nPIU and review portfolio performance while guiding MOTC on project, \npolicy, maintenance and administration matters. ADB and MOTC have \nprepared  a  project  administration  memorandum  (Supplementary \nAppendix A) to ensure the project is delivered on time and on budget. \nIt outlines the tasks to be performed by each party to maintain the \nexecution schedule, ensure compliance with social and environmental \nsafeguards, ensure transparency and integrity, and report accurately \nand  on  time.  Additionally,  MOTC  will  use  web-based  project \nmanagement to allow better communication between the field offices \nand the PIU. This will allow ADB to access information on completed \nphysical quantities, disbursements, outstanding payments, contractors\u2019 \nclaims, etc. \n   \nProcurement  MOTC will procure works and goods financed by ADB according to \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Civil  works  are  packaged  into  two \ncontracts and will be procured through international competitive bidding. \nThe cross-border facility, in the vicinity of km 479, will be included in one \ncivil  work  contract.  The  procurement  activities  in  the  18  months \nbeginning in May 2009 are in Appendix 6.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Supervising  civil  works  and,  if  necessary,  reviewing  and  designing \nother  parts  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  will  be  done  by  an \ninternational firm. This firm will be selected by MOTC according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The selected firm will \ntrain on road construction and maintenance. The firm will be selected \non the basis of full technical proposals evaluated using the quality- and \ncost-based  selection  or  quality-based  selection  method,  or  single \nsource selection method, if appropriate justification can be provided.  \n   \n  A private firm will be engaged to perform a financial audit. It will be \nselected using the consultant\u2019s qualification selection method, or the \nleast  cost  selection  method.  Services  of  national  and  international \nindividual consultants or international firms will be used from time to \ntime to assist PIU staff in special circumstances, or to handle complex \nissues,  including  the  master  plan.  The  individuals  will  be  selected \naccording to individual consultant recruitment method, and firms will be \nselected  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  quality, \nconsultant\u2019s qualification method, or the least cost selection method, \nafter discussing and agreeing with ADB on the terms of reference and \nbudget.   \n   \n \n \n \n ", "iv   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit road users in the form of lower operating costs \nBeneficiaries  and  travel  time.  The  road  will  increase  economic  activity  (tourism, \nagriculture, and mineral resources development). About 1.5 million tons \nof Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC trade in 2015 is expected to move through the \nBishkek\u2013Torugart road. \n \nThe estimated economic internal rate of return of the direct benefits of \nimproving the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road is 14.4% and the net present value \nis $49.7 million. The road passes through three oblasts that have poverty \nlevels above the national average of 46%. It will give better market \naccess to the estimated 2.3 million people living in the corridor. About \n51% of the project impact area population is female, and will benefit from \nthe  improved  access  to  markets  for  their  home  grown  produce  and \nhandicraft.   \n   \nRisks and  There is a risk that the Project will be implemented late and over budget. \nAssumptions  There  is  also  a  risk  that  maintenance  will  be  substandard  and \nunderfunded. Counterpart finance is always a concern, aggravated by the \ncurrent global financial crisis. Project execution delays will cut the rate of \nreturn in achieving the expected results. \n \nADB is aware of these risks and is working closely with the Government \non  improving  capabilities,  maintenance  financing  and  institutional \neffectiveness. The resident mission and the headquarters teams will join \nup with the MOTC team to ensure that execution schedules are kept in \ntouch and that adequate budget allocation are made every year. The \nlatter will be covenanted in the loan agreement. \n \nADB's dialogue with the Government is effective and constructive. The \nGovernment  agrees  with  the  risk  assumptions  and  implementation \nproposals. It has also tapped other financiers to complete another 150 \nkm by 2015.   ", " \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the CAREC Transport Corridor 1 \n(Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project 2 (the Project). The design and monitoring framework for the \nProject is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Growth in the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s trade has been bolstered by improvements in the \ntransport system, especially roads. The dominance of the road sector is evident from the modal \nsplit trends in freight and passenger traffic shown in Table 1. Over 90% of the passengers and \nmore than 50% of the freight in the Kyrgyz Republic move by road. Railways carry increasing \namounts of bulk commodities and machinery, but the 320 kilometers (km) of single track within \nthe country exist only in the form of several spurs from two branches\u2014one from Kazakhstan \nrailways (in the north) and the other from Uzbekistan railways (in the southeast). Air transport \nhas been serving a varying share of the demand\u2014mostly international passengers and freight\u2014\nbut carries less than 5% of the total traffic. Domestic air services are mainly between Bishkek \nand Osh. Water transport is limited to few operations in Lake Issyk-Kul (map). \n \nTable 1: National Freight and Passenger Traffic Flows \nTransport Mode  2002  2004  2006  2008 \nFreight (million ton-kilometers)       \nRail  394.6  714.9  752.0  943.1 \nRoad  875.1  847.4  864.0  1059.9 \nAir  38.8  45.5  34.2  58.6 \n  Total  1,308.5  1,607.8  1,650.2  2061.6 \nPassenger (million passenger-kilometers)       \nRail  43.1  45.3  61.5  89.6 \nRoad  4,857.3  5,407.3  5,936.4  6509.0 \nAir  341.9  458.9  360.2  632.7 \n  Total  5,242.3  5,911.5  6,358.1  7231.3 \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s road-based trade with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nthrough Torugart, which amounts to about half its total trade with the PRC, rose from about \n100,000 tons in 2003 to more than 280,000 tons in 2007 (Table 2). This increase was driven \nmostly by the rise in demand for consumer goods in the Kyrgyz Republic, and export of metals \nto the PRC. This has caused the number of vehicles crossing the border to more than double in \n4 years.   \n \n ", "2   \nTable 2: Freight and Passenger Traffic Flow through Torugart Border \nItem  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nNumber of Vehicles  \nKyrgyz Republic  4,040  7,598  7,110  7,662  8,214 \nPRC   292  660  983  1,149  1,396 \nTotal   4,332  8,258  8,093  8,811  9,610 \nADT  24  45  44  48  52 \nchange (%)  (16)  91  (2)  9  8 \nVolume of Freight (tons)  \nTo PRC   77,677  171,51  147,327  158,765  170,203 \nFrom PRC   26,351  53,923  79,401  92,810  112,761 \n( ) = negative, ADT = average daily traffic, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.  \nSource: National Statistics Committee. 2008. Kyrgyzstan in Figures. Bishkek. \n \n4.  The 35,000 km road network in the Kyrgyz Republic spans evenly across the seven \noblasts  (provinces),  and  connects  many  of  the  remote  communities  to  each  other  and  to \nneighboring countries. The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) manages about \n19,000  km  of  the  roads  (republican  roads)  that  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  central \nGovernment. These roads are classified international (22%), national (30%), and rural (48%) \nroads.  The  remaining  16,000  km  are  mainly  rural  roads  under  the  jurisdiction  of  local \ngovernments. About 40% (7,500 km) of the republican roads are paved, 50% are gravel, and \nthe others are unpaved roads. Development partners have provided more than $400 million (on \naverage about $30 million per year) for road improvement, and this helped rehabilitate nearly \n1,600 km of roads (40% of international roads) between 1995 and 2008. Works on another 660 \nkm are either continuing or expected to start before the end of 2010. However, a road condition \nsurvey conducted in 2005 revealed that more than 70% of the local roads also need repair or \nreconstruction. More than 50% of the international roads, including parts of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nroad, have yet to be rehabilitated.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Problems \n5.  Lack  of  Funds.  All  development  partners  recognize  that,  unless  these  roads  are \nimproved, the network is unlikely to be able to serve the increased demand for transport \ngenerated by growing regional trade. Moreover, border infrastructure and procedures need to \nbe improved to serve the share of international and transit traffic, particularly vehicles carrying \nnatural resources, between the PRC and neighboring countries. These two types of traffic would \nincrease  substantially  because  of  the  limited  potential  to  improve  the  railways  across \nmountainous terrain. The Government has prepared a Road Sector Development Strategy for \n2007\u201320101 (RSDS) that specifies eight medium-term measures to improve access to regional \nand local markets: (i) rehabilitation and adequate maintenance, (ii) transport independence, \n(iii) improvement of the road financing system, (iv) involvement of the private sector in road \nconstruction and maintenance, (v) involvement of local communities in maintenance of local \nroads,  (vi)  institutional  reforms,  (vii)  improvement  of  road  safety,  and  (viii) use  of  modern \ntechnologies in road management and monitoring. Eight roads, including the Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nroad,  are  identified  in  the  strategy  for  improvement  on  a  priority  basis.  The  target  is  to \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2007. Road Sector Development Strategy for \n2007\u20132010. Bishkek.  \n ", "      3\nrehabilitate or reconstruct at least one-third of these roads by 2010.  A detailed analysis of the \nroad subsector in the Kyrgyz Republic is in Appendix 2. \n \n6.  The total estimated cost of fully implementing the physical components of the RSDS is \n$1.5 billion. This includes about $1.2 billion for rehabilitating some 2,000 km and maintaining all \nroads under MOTC\u2019s jurisdiction during the next 5 years. The first phase of the RSDS requires \n(i) about $490 million for rehabilitating the remaining sections of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road and \nOsh\u2013Isfana road, and (ii) about $48 million annually for maintenance. The Government expects \nto borrow or receive grants from its development partners for this, and to finance maintenance \nthrough allocations from the central budget. In the past, it allocated progressively more funds for \nthe  road  sector\u2014total  funding  increased  from  $12  million  in  2005  to  $40 million  in  2007. \nHowever, the Government has difficulty financing the total cost of the RSDS from its budget.  \n \n7.  Organizations and Regulations. Since 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nmaintained a continuous dialogue with the Government and provided technical assistance for \nimproving  the  transport  sector  performance.2   The  Government  has  adopted  numerous \nstrategies and plans in addition to the RSDS. Four separate agencies, including a separate \ndepartment  managing  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  corridor,  will  be  set  up  to  manage  the \ninternational road corridors. Yet, it lacks a comprehensive time-based plan and the skilled \npeople required for developing the transport sector. Public sector salaries and professional \ndevelopment programs are insufficient to attract and retain good workers.  \n \n2.  Opportunities \n8.  Contribution  to  Regional  Integration.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  transport  system  is \nimportant for national economic and social development as well as for the central and south \nAsian  economies.  Improving  transport  infrastructure  and  border  operations  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic will lower the cost of domestic transport and international traffic as well as transit \ntraffic.  The  Government  is  committed  to  \u201cworking  together  for  trade  openness,  transport \ncorridors for integrating the region and connecting to external markets, and for developing and \nsharing the region\u2019s energy resources\u201d during the Fourth Ministerial Conference on Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) in Bishkek in 2005.3 The CAREC Transport and \nTrade  Facilitation  Strategy4 supports  this  by  (i)  establishing  competitive  transport  corridors \nacross  the  CAREC  region;  (ii)  facilitating  efficient  movement  through  corridors  and  across \nborders; and (iii) developing sustainable, safe, and user-friendly transport and trade networks. \nCross-border transport procedures are being improved under several ADB-financed projects, \nand a cross-border agreement between the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan is being \nfinalized  under  Grant  0084-KGZ:  CAREC  Regional  Road  Corridor  Improvement  Project. \nDeveloping a harmonized transport regulatory framework is one of the tasks undertaken by the \nCAREC  Transport  Sector  Coordination  Committee.  Therefore,  road  improvements  would \ncomplete the cycle needed to lower transport cost and time.  \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002.

Government Commitment. In addition to the RSDS, improving and maintaining road \ninfrastructure is a high priority in the Country Development Strategy (2007\u20132010).5 The strategy \ncalls for developing international road corridors to facilitate regional trade and transit traffic, as \nwell as establishing legal and regulatory frameworks to encourage private sector participation in \ntransport. Several other government policies are also directed at improving the efficiency of the \ntransport sector based on market-oriented principles, and the Government has agreed with ADB \nto adopt the road sector master plan currently under development as part of CAREC Transport \nCorridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project.6  \n \n10.  ADB  Strategy.  The  Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s CAREC Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program7 and the Joint Country Support Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic (2007\u2013\n2010).8 It  supports  two  strategic  objectives:  (i)  increasing  trade  and  integration  with  large \nmarkets  in  South  Asia,  the  PRC,  the  Russian  Federation,  and  Turkey;  and  (ii)  improving \neconomic  cooperation  to  reduce  transport  costs  and  facilitate  trade  and  transit\u2014allowing \nCentral  Asian  countries  to  become  integrated  and  use  their  location  to  their  advantage. \nMoreover,  the  Project will  complement  the  ADB-led  investment  and  policy  dialogue  in  the \ncountry, and complete a key transport corridor connecting its capital Bishkek to Kashi in the \nPRC, and is consistent with the sector strategy of ADB, which is the lead development partner \nin the transport sector. \n \n11.  External Assistance. ADB is the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s main development partner in the \nroad subsector. The Project is the eighth ADB-financed road project in the country, and would \nbring its total assistance for infrastructure and capacity development since 1996 to nearly \n$280 million (64% of its total development assistance to the country since 1995). These projects \ninclude the Bishkek\u2013Osh\u2013Irkeshtam road, the Kyrgyz Republic part of the road from Bishkek to \nAlmaty  in  Kazakhstan,  the  Sary  Tash\u2013Karamyk  road,  and  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1 \n(Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project (Project 1), which was approved in 2008. The Project is a \ncontinuation of Project 1 and the second in the phased rehabilitation plan for the corridor. The \nWorld Bank, Islamic Development Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the \nPRC are the other donors to the road sector. The World Bank, the European Union, and the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development are proposing a combined assistance \npackage of some $75 million to improve the Osh\u2013Isfana road. Likewise, the Japan International \nCooperation Agency is assisting MOTC to improve road maintenance and some important \nbridges. A summary of the projects financed by external agencies is in Appendix 3.  \n \n12.  The Government is seeking additional external financing to complete ongoing works on \nthe CAREC corridors, including $200 million for the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road. The 2,800 km \nsection of CAREC Transport Corridor 1 in Kazakhstan is being improved with the assistance of \nADB,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, the Islamic Development Bank, and the World Bank.  \n \n                                                 \n5  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2007.

Implementation delays continue although they are much less now in comparison to the \nfirst ADB-financed Bishkek\u2013Osh road rehabilitation project.9  Project planning and institutional \nexperience in procurement and contracting were inadequate at the time. These deficiencies \nhave  been  corrected  through  technical  assistance,  and  guidance  from  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners. ADB has also reviewed the completion reports and audit reports of \nprevious projects,10 and agreed with MOTC on a series of measures, including a transport sector \nmaster plan and an improved project management approach (described in paras. 26\u201328). These \nwill be implemented in Project 1 and the Project. MOTC will also hire additional specialists to \nincrease oversight of road network development impacts. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The Project\u2019s primary impact will be increased regional trade, particularly between the \nKyrgyz Republic and the PRC, which will lead to less poverty in Naryn oblast. Its main outcomes \nwill be higher accessibility and mobility. \n \n15.  The  Project  has  a  physical  component  and  a  nonphysical  component.  The  physical \ncomponent includes rehabilitating about 75 km of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road and constructing an \ninspection facility for managing international passenger and freight traffic. The sections that will \nbe rehabilitated are located adjacent to the section rehabilitated under the Project 1 road. \nMOTC staff\u2019s skills and knowledge will be improved under the nonphysical component. This will \nalso be a continuation of Project 1\u2014the human resource development part of the transport \nsector master plan development component.   \n \nB.  Outputs \n16.  The main outputs are as follows: \n \n(i)  Some 75 km of 2-lane road (km 365\u2013400 and km 439\u2013479) with geometry and \npavement structure improved to category III standards,11 improved bridges at km \n388 and km 400, and an inspection (border control) facility close to km 479. \n \n(ii)  A professional development program for road sector professionals implemented \naccording to the human resource development component of the transport sector \nmaster plan (2010\u20132025), which is under preparation.12   \n                                                 \n9  Financed through three ADB loans: ADB. 1996.

As  part  of  the  physical  component,  a  comprehensive  inspection  facility  (customs, \nimmigration,  health  and  quarantine,  border  control,  etc.)  to  manage  the  movement  of \ninternational freight and passenger traffic will be constructed in the vicinity of km 479 (about \n60 km from the current inspection facility at Torugart). The new facility will solve at least two \nexisting  problems.  One,  the  services  and  utilities  in  Torugart  are  inadequate  to  serve  the \nincreased staff of all the agencies that will be required to serve the post when traffic reaches the \nprojected  levels  in  5  years.  Two,  the  climate  there  is  too  harsh  and  living  conditions  are \nunfavorable. Therefore, the new facility will become the main border inspection point for traffic to \nand from the PRC while the post at the border in Torugart will be improved as part of Grant \n0123-KGZ, and will serve as a screening point by border control (internal security) officials. For \nexpediency and as a demonstration of interagency collaboration, the Government has agreed \nfor construction works on this facility to be part of the civil works in the section from km 439 to \nkm 479, and maintenance of the paved parking, and the facility access and egress roads to be \nincluded in the regular maintenance program of MOTC.  \n \n18.  The other is an industry-university program in the nonphysical component to increase \nthe knowledge and technical skills of road engineering graduates of Kyrgyz universities. Details \nof  the  program  will  be  prepared  as  part  of  the  transport  master  plan  component  under \nGrant 0123-KGZ:  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1  (Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road)  Project,  and  will \ninclude (i) setting up at least five summer internship positions at MOTC for students seeking a \ncareer in transport; and (ii) offering at least two short courses (maximum 1 month duration) in \ntransportation  engineering  and  project  management.  These  courses  would  be  available  to \nMOTC staff and university students, who can follow them to obtain a certificate of competency. \nThe internship program and courses will be offered every year during the project implementation \nperiod,  and  will  be  designed  in  consultation  with  local  technical  universities,  chambers  of \ncommerce,  technical  accreditation  bodies,  foreign  universities,  and  the  road  industry\u2014\nconsultants, road transport operators, contractors, etc.   \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n19.

Financing Plan \n20.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a grant of $22.0 million and a loan of \n$28.0 million (Special Drawing Rights 18,492,000) from its Special Funds resources to help \nfinance the Project, which will cover 80% of the total cost of the Project. The Government will \nprovide $12.5 million to cover part of the cost of the inspection facility and project contingencies, \nand all taxes and duties.

MOTC, which is also the executing agency (EA) for ongoing ADB-financed projects,14 \nwill  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  Project.  With  the  assistance  of  international  and \nnational consultants, MOTC has, over the past 10 years, acquired a broad understanding of \nproject management principles and ADB procedures to implement the Project effectively.  \n \n23.  The project implementation unit (PIU) established by MOTC, which is managing Project \n1 at present, will oversee and manage day-to-day activities of the Project. MOTC plans to \nstrengthen the PIU\u2019s current team of about 10 professionals within the next 2 years. Many of the \ncurrent  team  members  are  aware  of  international  best  practices  and  ADB  polices  and \nprocedures.  They  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  services; \nadministering  contracts;  and  ensuring  project  completion  according  to  the  schedules  and \ncovenants. No major social and environmental impacts have resulted from past road projects. \nHowever, as the road network expands and traffic increases, better planning, designing, and \nmonitoring will be needed to manage impacts during and after construction. Therefore, MOTC is \nalso planning to assign or recruit relevant safeguard specialists to the PIU.   \n \n24.  ADB has assigned a team (staff from headquarters and the Kyrgyz Resident Mission) to \nmanage the Project and ADB\u2019s continuing road sector activities in the Kyrgyz Republic. This \nteam will liaise with the PIU and regularly review the road sector portfolio performance while \nguiding MOTC on critical project administration matters. ADB and MOTC have drafted a project \nadministration memorandum (Supplementary Appendix A) to ensure project delivery on time \nand within budget. It outlines the tasks to be performed by each party to maintain the schedule, \nensure  compliance  with  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  assure  transparency  and \nintegrity, and report accurately. Additionally, MOTC will use web-based project management to \nallow better communication between field offices and the PIU. This will enable ADB to gain \naccess  to  up-to-date  information  such  as  completed  physical  quantities,  disbursements, \noutstanding payments, contractors\u2019 claims, etc.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n25.  The Project started in May 2009 with advance contracting, and will be completed by \nDecember  2013  when  the  warranty  on  civil  works  ends.  The  actual  physical  works  will \ncommence in April 2010. A summary of project activities and their schedules is in Appendix 5 \nand a detailed schedule is in the project administration memorandum (PAM). \n \n3.  Procurement \n26.  MOTC will procure works and goods financed by ADB according to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Civil  works  in  the  Project  have  been \npackaged into two contracts\u2014contract 1: km 365\u2013km 400, and contract 2: km 439\u2013km 479. \nThese  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.

Small works costing less than $1.0 million, although not anticipated at this stage, will be \nprocured using the national competitive bidding procedure. National competitive bidding will be \nconducted according to the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic on Public Procurement of Goods, \nWorks, and Services effective April 2004, subject to clarifications and modifications as agreed \nwith ADB and as indicated in section C of the procurement plan. The procurement activities in \nthe 18 months beginning in May 2009 are shown in Appendix 6.  \n  \n4.  Consulting Services \n28.  Supervising civil works, monitoring and evaluation, and, if necessary, reviewing and \ndesigning other parts of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road will be done by one international firm. This \nfirm will also provide on-the-job training in various aspects of construction and maintenance of \nroads for MOTC staff. The firm will be selected by MOTC according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The selected firm will also provide \ntraining in various aspects of construction and maintenance of roads for MOTC staff. The firm \nwill be selected on the basis of full technical proposals evaluated using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection (QCBS) or quality-based selection (QBS) method, or single source selection \n(SSS) method if appropriate justification can be provided. MOTC may use a weighting of 70:30 \nif the QCBS method is used.   \n \n29.  Services of an independent audit firm will be procured to perform annual financial audits \nof  the  project  accounts.  Services  of  national  and  international  individual  consultants  or \ninternational firms will be procured from time to time to assist the PIU staff (project management \nassistance) in special circumstances or to handle complex issues, as well as to help implement \nthe master plan. When using the QCBS method, a cost-quality ratio of 70:30 based on simplified \ntechnical proposals may be used after discussing with ADB. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n30.  To expedite the bidding process, ADB Management has, in principle, approved advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing from the grant and loan proceeds for expenditures incurred \non eligible civil works and consulting services. Advance contracting allows the Government to \ncommence procurement activities, at its own risk, prior to signing of the financing agreements. \nThe Government was informed that, for expenses incurred under advance contracting to be \neligible  for  retroactive  financing,  such  procedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Once the grant and \nloan become effective, up to 20% of the proceeds may be used to retroactively finance eligible \nexpenditures  incurred  during  the  period  not  exceeding  12  months  prior  to  signing  of  the \nfinancing agreements. Alternatively, the Government may opt for advance contracting without \nretroactive  financing,  in  which  case,  the  procurement  procedures  adopted  under  advance \ncontracting do not conclude with the award of contract until after the grant and loan become \neffective. The Government acknowledges that any concurrence by ADB with the procedures, \ndocumentation, or proposal for award does not commit ADB to finance such expenses. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \n ", "10   \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nproject  financing  agreements  and  the  service  and  works  contracts  under  the  Project.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n32.  For greater transparency and accountability, the Government will disclose to the public, \nand update annually, the current status, annual financial statements, and future plans of the \nroad fund established by the Government in 1998 through local media and on the websites of \nthe Ministry of Finance and MOTC. MOTC will also disclose (i) its annual financial statement of \nthe funds it receives from the central budget, and (ii) the status and implementation progress of \nall  donor-funded  investment  projects  concerning  the  road  sector.  In  particular,  MOTC  will \ndisclose on its website information on how the proceeds of the loan and grant proceeds are \nused.  For  each  contract  financed  under  the  Project,  MOTC  will  disclose  on  its  website \ninformation on, among others: (i) the list of participating bidders; (ii) name of the winning bidder; \n(iii) basic details on bidding procedures and procurement methods adopted; (iv) the amount of \ncontract awarded; (v) the list of goods/services, including consulting services, procured; and \n(vi) the intended and actual utilization of the loan and grant proceeds under each contract. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n33.  All disbursements of the ADB grant and loan under the Project will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nTo facilitate project implementation and funds flow, two separate imprest accounts will be \nestablished for the grant and the loan at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB and will be \nexclusively used to finance ADB\u2019s share of eligible expenditures. MOTC will manage both \nimprest accounts. The initial advance to be deposited to the relevant imprest account will not \nexceed either 6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the grant or loan amount, as the \ncase  may  be,  whichever  is lower.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  the  documentation \nprocess, the statement of expenditures procedure will be used for liquidating and replenishing \neach  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  payment.  The \npayments in excess of the statement of expenditures ceiling will be liquidated or replenished \nbased on the supporting documentation process.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n34.  The EA will maintain separate accounts for all project components financed by ADB and \nthe  Government,  and  have  them  audited  by  an  independent  auditor  that  has  adequate \nknowledge and experience of international accounting practices and is acceptable to ADB. The \naudited project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB within 6 months after \nthe  end  of  each  fiscal  year  during  implementation.  The  auditor\u2019s  report  should  include  a \nseparate opinion on the proper use of the imprest account and statement of expenditures \nprocedures.  The  Government  has  been  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  the  timely \nsubmission of audited project accounts and financial statements, including the suspension of \ndisbursements in case of noncompliance. The EA will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly and \nannual progress reports on project implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed \nwith  ADB.  To  facilitate  evaluation  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  provide  a  project \ncompletion report to ADB within 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n ", "      11\n35.  A financial management assessment of the EA was conducted (details in Supplementary \nAppendix B) during the preparation of Project 1, and it concluded that the associated risks are \nlow because of the EA\u2019s adequate experience in project management. The EA has adopted an \naccrual accounting system supported by standardized accounting software. MOTC is subject to \nthree levels of audit: (i) an internal audit by the Department of Economic and Financial Planning \nand Control, (ii) a statutory audit by the Chamber of Accounts of the Kyrgyz Republic, and (iii) a \nmandatory external audit for ADB-financed projects by an independent audit firm. ADB will \nreserve the right to verify the project accounts maintained by the EA as well as the accounts of \nthe construction firms and consulting firms financed under the Project. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n36.  ADB and MOTC have agreed on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating project \nperformance in relation to its impact and outcome prior to its commencement. These include \nindicators from the project design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). At the start of civil \nworks, the EA will collate values of these indicators, which will be used as baseline values for \nmonitoring purposes during project implementation. MOTC will follow the same systematic data \ncollection procedure used for reporting the performance of past and ongoing projects. Although \nmonitoring of different indicators will be done at different times and at different frequencies, \nreporting to ADB will be biannual. The performance and impact of the Project will be done both \nby MOTC and at completion of the Project, and 1 and 3 years after completion. A final report will \nconsist of an evaluation of changes that occurred in the preceding 3 years. If necessary, MOTC \nwill engage specialists to perform detailed assessment of socioeconomic, environmental, and \ntechnical impacts of the Project. \n \n10.  Project Review \n37.  The  ADB  team  and  the  PIU  team  will  maintain  continuous  oversight  of  the \nimplementation activities with at least one detailed review every 12 months from the effective \ndate of the financing agreement. The detailed reviews will be done in consultation with other \nstaff of MOTC, officials of the Ministry of Finance, State Customs Committee, and other relevant \nagencies as well as public and private representatives from the project area. The review will \nfocus  on  outputs,  particularly  those  relating  to  institutional,  administrative,  technical, \nenvironmental, and social aspects to ensure project delivery is on time and on budget. The \nProject\u2019s economic viability and other aspects that may have an impact on overall performance \nwill be assessed after completion of the Project, or as necessary during implementation. The \nreview  will  examine  the  implementation  progress  of  the  reforms  and  compliance  with \nassurances specified in the financing agreement. \n \nG.  Stakeholder Consultation \n38.  During the project preparation\u2014feasibility studies, environmental impact assessment, \nand social surveys\u2014the Government, nongovernment organizations, local communities, road \nusers,  external  aid  agencies,  and  other  project  stakeholders  were  asked  their  needs  and \nexpectations. The consultants and ADB\u2019s project team explained to them the road alignment, \ntransport services, and the expected impacts and outcomes of the Project. There was a high \ndegree of support from all parties, both private and public, individuals and groups. Similar \nmeetings will be held throughout project implementation, and concerns and suggestions will be \nused to improve the project impact. \n \n ", "12   \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n39.  The Project will bring immediate benefits to road users in the form of lower operating \ncosts and travel time because of the improved surface of the project road and the transport \nmaster plan implementation, which would increase the efficiency of the overall road network and \ntransport services. However, sustainable benefits will result in the medium to long term\u2014after \nthe  entire  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road,  Bishkek  bypass  road,  and  the  international  traffic \nmanagement facilities are constructed. These benefits will be in the form of reduced travel time \nand  increased  economic  activity  resulting  from  tourism,  agriculture,  and  mineral  resources \ndevelopment in the Bishkek\u2013Torugart corridor. About 1.5 million tons or half of the estimated \ntotal volume of Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC trade in 2015 are expected to move on the Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart road. Moreover, the road passes through three oblasts that have poverty levels above the \nnational average of 46%. It will give better market access to the estimated 2.3 million people living \nin the corridor. In addition, about 51% of the project impact area population is female, which is the \ndominant gender in intra- and inter-oblast trade and commerce in the Kyrgyz Republic, and can \nbenefit from the improved access.   \n \n40.  The economic analysis entailed projecting direct costs and benefits for with- and without-\nproject scenarios in accordance with ADB guidelines.15 The difference between the with- and \nwithout-project  cost  and  benefits  streams  represents  the  net  benefits  of  the  Project.  The \neconomic analysis covers 25 years (2009\u20132032), comprising about 5 years for rehabilitating \n(including defects liability period) and 20 years of operation. The least-cost option was selected \namong mutually exclusive project alternatives and various pavement treatment options. Details \nof the economic analysis are in Appendix 7. \n \n41.  The estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the direct benefits accruing \nafter improving the entire corridor is 14.4% and the net present value is $49.7 million. To test \nthe  impact  of  deviations  of  costs  and  benefits  from  the  estimated  averages,  a  series  of \nsensitivity  tests  was  performed.  The  deviations  considered  include  the  construction  cost \nincreasing by 20%, the implementation period extending by 3 years, and the 6% traffic growth \nrate continuing at 6% instead of increasing to 8% after 5 years. The tests suggested that the \nEIRR drops to 12% if the construction cost rises by 20%, but to about 13% if the other two \nevents occurred.  \n \nB.  Social and Poverty Impacts  \n42.  The  Project  will  have  an  indirect  impact  on  poverty  by  stimulating  economic \ndevelopment. The results of the social and poverty assessments undertaken are presented in \nthe summary poverty reduction and social strategy in Appendix 8. While the Project aims to \nfacilitate regional trade and thereby benefit major businesses and those involved in trade and \ncommerce, it will also significantly benefit rural communities and especially the rural poor. In \nparticular, it will increase the mobility of 2.3 million people living in three oblasts, which the \nBishkek\u2013Torugart road passes through, which have poverty levels below the national average of \n46%. Since about 51% of the project impact area population is female, which is the dominant \ngender in intra- and inter-oblast (province) trade and commerce in the Kyrgyz Republic, the \nincreased mobility would have special significance.   \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 1997.

Road construction work will create opportunities for direct and indirect employment over \nthe 3-year implementation period. Thereafter, maintenance work, which will be outsourced to \nnational firms, will create longer-term employment and service opportunities.   \n \n44.  Information and periodic seminars on HIV prevention will be made available through the \nconstruction company to people directly and indirectly associated with the Project as well as to \nresidents in the project area. These outreach activities will be designed by the construction \ncompany and approved by MOTC as part of the health and safety management part of the \nquality assurance and quality control plan, which will also support the Government\u2019s national \nprogram. ADB will review and make specific recommendations, if necessary. The responsibility \nfor preparing and implementing such a plan will be an integral part of the construction contract.  \n \nC.  Social Safeguards  \n45.  Classification of the Project for resettlement impact is category C. All civil works will take \nplace  within  the  existing  right-of-way  or  on  unused  state-owned  land.  No  relocation  of \nhouseholds or acquisition of productive land is expected. Borrow pits or quarries are also \navailable in state-owned empty land, within easy access and away from residential areas. \n  \n46.  There are no groups with characteristics of indigenous people (as defined by ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples [1998]) affected by the Project. Therefore, the Project is classified \ncategory C for its impact on indigenous people. In 2005, it was reported that the population in \nthe project area consisted of 99% Kyrgyz and other nationalities included, Russians, Tajiks, \nTatars, Uygurs, and Uzbeks who have lived in the same region for a long time and integrated in \nthe  same  economic  and  social  structure.  The  road  alignment  touches  only  the  Kyrgyz \nsettlements and none of them will be adversely affected.  \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts  \n47.  The environmental classification for the Project is category B. An initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines.16 It  showed  that  the  project  road  will  not  have  a \nsignificant irreversible or permanent, negative environmental impact during or after rehabilitation. \nMOTC, in its contracts with the construction firm, will require it to elaborate and implement the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) outlined in the IEE summary (Appendix 9), and abide \nby the environmental laws and regulations of the Kyrgyz Republic and ADB\u2019s policies, procedures \nand guidelines, specifically its Environment Policy, to avoid or alleviate temporary impact. \n \nE.  Project Assumptions and Risks \n48.  There is a risk that the Project will be implemented late and over budget. There is also a \nrisk that maintenance will be substandard and underfunded. Counterpart finance is always a \nconcern, aggravated by the current global financial crisis. Project execution delays will cut the \nrate of return in achieving the expected results. \n \n49.  ADB is aware of these risks and is working closely with the Government on improving \ncapabilities, maintenance financing and institutional effectiveness. The resident mission and the \nheadquarters teams will join up with the MOTC team to ensure that execution schedules are \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n ", "14   \nkept in touch and that adequate budget allocation are made every year. The latter will be \ncovenanted in the loan agreement. \n \n50.  ADB's dialogue with the Government is effective and constructive. The Government \nagrees  with  the  risk  assumptions  and  implementation  proposals.  It  has  also  tapped  other \nfinanciers to complete another 150 km by 2015.   \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n51.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MOTC have given ADB the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the financing agreement for the Project, to \nensure the following: \n \n(i)  Counterpart funding. The amount of funds outlined in the project financing plan \nis  available  on  time  to  enable  completion  of  the  Project  on  schedule,  and \nsubsequently adequate funds are allocated to operate and maintain the road \nthroughout its service life. \n \n(ii)  Additional  funding. Adequate funds are allocated and made available on a \ntimely basis to operate and maintain the road sections rehabilitated under the \nProject throughout their service life. In addition, funding will be made available for \nrehabilitating the remaining sections of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road to allow rapid \nand uninterrupted flow of international passenger and freight traffic. \n \n(iii)  Capacity of the PIU and award of civil works contracts. Three months before \nthe implementation of the first civil works contract under the Project commences, \nthe capacity of the PIU is strengthened by, at least, increasing and recruiting \nadequate number of professional staff with specialization in the areas required \nfor the Project. \n \n(iv)  Transparency  and  good  governance.  All  transactions  and  payments  are \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s fund disbursement procedures and all \ncontracts  financed  by ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  include  provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  and  the  Government  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords  and  accounts  of  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nproviders of goods and services as they relate to the Project. \n \n(v)  Public access to information. Financial statements and implementation details of \nthe  Project  including  information  on  opportunities  for  works  and  services, \nprocurement status, and contracts awards, are accessible to the public through the \ninternet or at MOTC. \n \n(vi)  Construction quality. Stringent oversight is maintained on the consultants and \ncontractors under the Project so that the services and works carried out under \nthe relevant contracts conform to the standards and specifications required by \nthe Project, and are of high quality. \n \n(vii)  Road operations. The relevant authorities and parties coordinate and maintain \nregular and quality services on the road sections rehabilitated under the Project \nduring and after rehabilitation.  \n \n ", "      15\n(viii)  Environment. The road sections rehabilitated under the Project are designed, \nrehabilitated, maintained, and operated according to (a) all applicable national \nenvironmental laws and regulations, (b) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, and (c) the \nEMP for the Project. If there is any discrepancy between the applicable national \nlaws and regulations, and the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  shall  apply.  In  addition,  all  civil  works  contracts  will  include \nrequirements  to  comply  with  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  in \naccordance  with  the  IEE  and  the  EMP.  All  civil  works  contractors  will  be \nsupervised to ensure their compliance with the requirements of the IEE and \nthe EMP. \n \n(ix)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Although  no  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities are required according to the current design, if either or \nboth  become  necessary  in  any  section  of  the  road  during  rehabilitation,  a \nresettlement plan or a short resettlement plan, as the case may be, will be \nprepared  according  to  the  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations,  and  the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and submitted to \nADB for approval before commencing any form of works in these sections. If \nthere is any discrepancy between the applicable national laws and regulations, \nand  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements shall apply. \n \n(x)  Equal opportunities and continuous consultation. There will be no gender, \nracial,  or  other  forms  of  discrimination  with  regard  to  employment,  salary, \npayment  of  compensation  for  land  acquisition  or  resettlement,  and  other \nbusiness opportunities arising from the Project. Consultations with residents and \nofficials in the project areas will be regularly conducted on matters of social and \ncultural significance during the project implementation period.  \n \n(xi)  Employment and labor. The contractors and consultants engaged under the \nProject are required to provide maximum possible opportunities for employment \nof the project area residents. Each of the civil works contractors of the Project will \ncomply with all applicable national labor, health, and safety laws and regulations. \nIn particular, each of the civil works contracts financed under the Project will \n(a) contain  provisions  prohibiting  use  of  child  labor,  employment  of  illegal \nimmigrants, and differentiation in wages between male and female workers for \nwork of equal value; (b) include mandatory provisions requiring contractors and \nconsultants to provide healthy, safe, and secure working conditions as well as \nadequate medical, life, and disability insurance for all its employees; and (c) have \na requirement to conduct periodic awareness campaigns on sexually transmitted \ndiseases and HIV/AIDS for its employees as well as service providers during the \nrelevant contract period.  All contractors and their employees will be required to \nobserve  local  protocols  concerning  acceptable  behavior  toward  the  local \npopulation. \n \n(xii)  Illegal  trafficking  and  border  control.  Concrete  and  rigorous  measures  to \ndetect and prevent trafficking of humans, wildlife, endangered species, and illegal \nsubstances on the Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road will be fully implemented, and the \nGovernment shall inform ADB of any incidents and action taken to prevent such \nincidents. In particular, the Government will ensure that (a) appropriate measures \nfor controlling and monitoring the transportation of passengers and goods on the \n ", "16   \nroad section between the inspection facility constructed under the Project at \nkm 479 of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road and the border control facility constructed \nunder  Grant  0123-KGZ(SF):  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1  (Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nRoad) Project  at Torugart shall be designed and implemented on a timely basis, \nand (b) such road section is rigorously patrolled at all times. \n \nVI.

Road Infrastructure \n1.  The road network in the Kyrgyz  Republic spans all seven oblasts (provinces), and \nprovides  connections  to  remote  communities  and  links  to  neighboring  countries.  The  road \nnetwork comprises 34,720 kilometers (km) of roads\u201418,810 km of public roads and 15,910 km \nof urban, rural, agricultural, industrial, and other roads. Roads carry about 95% of the country\u2019s \npassenger traffic and more than half of the freight traffic (90% of domestic traffic). The total \nlength of international roads is 4,163 km, national roads total 5,678 km, and local roads total \n8,969 km. The length of paved public roads is 7,228 km, comprising 11 km of cement-concrete \nroads, 4,969 km of asphalt roads, and 2,248 km of bitumen treated gravel roads. The total \nlength of gravel road is 9,961 km, and there is 1,621 km of unpaved roads.   \n \n2.  About 18,800 km of roads (9,800 km of state roads and 9,000 km of local roads) are \nunder the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) (Table A2.1). \nAbout 40% of the roads are sealed, including some with gravel mixed with bitumen binder. Over \n50% are gravel and less than 10% are earth roads. Since most of the roads were originally \ndesigned for higher traffic volumes, the existing capacity is adequate for the level of economic \nactivity likely to occur in the medium term. Consequently, the primary concern is not expansion \nor major upgrading of the roads, but rehabilitation and preservation. Roads at all levels are \ndeteriorating; over 60% now require periodic maintenance or rehabilitation. Management of \nabout  16,000  km,  which  were  formerly  under  the  state  and  collective  farms,  is  now  the \nresponsibility of the district administrations. \n \nTable A2.1: Summary of the Road Network, 2007 \nBy Class  International  National  Local  Total \nLength (km)  4,163  5,678  8,969  18,810 \n%  22  30  48  100 \nBy Type  Paved  Gravel  Earth Road  Total \nLength (km)  7,228  9,961  1,621  18,810 \n%  38  53  9  100 \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \n3.  The road network was primarily developed under the former Soviet Union. However, \nneglect and insufficient funding for almost two decades caused a loss of about $1 billion in road \nassets. Survey data in 2005 found that two-thirds (out of 4,300 km) were in critical condition. \nOne-fifth of the surveyed roads had deteriorated to the point where expensive reconstruction, \nnot rehabilitation, was the only option; and about 200 km of paved road are reaching the same \ncondition annually. \n   \n4.  Since then, the Government has made improvement of road infrastructure one of its \npriorities, and started implementing its Road Sector Development Strategy for 2007\u201320101  \n(RSDS). The strategy has outlined ways to (i) rehabilitate key roads and maintain, (ii) create \ntransport  independence,  (iii)  improve  road  financing,  (iv)  involve  the  private  sector  in \nconstruction  and  maintenance,  (v)  involve  local  communities  in  local  road  maintenance, \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Transport and Communications, Kyrgyz Republic. 2007.

Bishkek.  \n ", "20  Appendix 2 \n(vi) reform  MOTC and road network management, (vii) improve road safety, and (viii) use \nmodern technologies in construction and management of roads. Eight road corridors, including \nthe Bishkek\u2013Torugart corridor, are identified in the strategy for rehabilitating by 2010. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank is supporting this initiative, and the World Bank and European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development are financing the Osh\u2013Isfana improvements. The Government \nis also finalizing a program for improving local roads. \n \n5.  The cost of construction and maintenance has risen sharply during the past 3 years, and \nthe Government may need more money than anticipated to implement the RSDS. Moreover, the \ntechnical standards and specifications of roads are aligned to road classification instead of level \nof usage. Therefore, the past tendency has been to build to a high standard rather than to meet \ntraffic demand. A shift toward cost-based designing has begun with MOTC\u2019s reorganization, but \nit will require a continuous dialog between all funding agencies and the Government to expedite \nthis shift.  \n \nB.  Vehicle Population \n6.  The number of registered vehicles had reached 271,000 by the end of 2007, including \naround  229,000  cars  and  buses,  and  41,700  trucks  (Table  A2.2).  This  is  equivalent  to \n54 vehicles per 1,000 people. The past growth rate, which has averaged about 5%, is expected \nto continue and even increase as the road conditions improve. Despite the decline in the \nnumber of trucks, it is expected to grow because of the increasing trade.   \n \nTable A2.2: Vehicle Population (Number) \nVehicle Type  1992  1995  2000  2005  2006  2007 \nCars/buses  176,643  200,043  191,423  202,520  220,359  229,644 \nTrucks  77,845  68,394  54,638  42,679  41,566  41,716 \n  Total  254,488  268,437  246,061  245,199  261,925  271,360 \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nC.  Institutions \n7.  The  Automobile  Roads  Act  allocates  the  main  responsibility  for  planning  and \nadministration of road policies, programs, and projects to MOTC. Policy, regulation, planning, \nand  development  of  other  modes  of  transport  and  communications  are  also  under  the \njurisdiction  of  MOTC.  Parts  of  it  are  being  reorganized,  such  as  the  unit  responsible  for \nimplementing donor-financed projects, which was restructured in 2007 and again in early 2009. \nThis is part of the Government\u2019s drive to increase infrastructure efficiency and meet rapidly \nchanging market conditions. Soon, the existing regional road agencies (PLUADs and UADs)2 \nwill be downsized and the 58 local road maintenance units will be privatized. The Government is \nplanning to consolidate its other regional operations gradually. It has created four separate \ncorridor management departments to replace existing regional roads departments, and two \nmore will be established in 2009. These departments will eventually be responsible for operating \nand maintaining the core international road network and the feeder roads.  \n \n8.  Other important agencies in the road sector are (i) KyrgyzIntrans, a holding agency of six \nfreight transport companies and forwarding agencies engaged mainly in international trade; and \n                                                 \n2  These are Russian acronyms for regional road maintenance department (PLUAD) and the local road maintenance \nsubdivision (UAD) of PLUAD. \n ", "  Appendix 2  21 \n(ii) technical agencies in various stages of divestment under MOTC\u2019s control, including the Road \nDesign Institute (Kyrgyzdortransproekt) and a small agency responsible for developing and \ntesting new road construction techniques and equipment (Kyrgyztranstekhnika). \n \nD.  Financing and Maintenance \n9.  The Road Fund enacted in 1998 has not served its intended purpose up to now. Taxes \nare collected in the name of the Road Fund, but are consolidated under the Government\u2019s \ncentral budget of the Ministry of Finance. The Road Fund Council, with the responsibility to \noversee the management of the Road Fund, was decreed in 2003, but has not yet met. A \nclearer  and  predictable  financing  mechanism,  including  a  fully  functional  Road  Fund,  and \nrevisions  to  the  revenue  structure  and  sources  are  expected  when  the  RSDS  is  fully \nimplemented. \n \n10.  The estimated cost of implementing the RSDS includes (i) $490 million needed for \nrehabilitating the remaining two key regional corridors, i.e., the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road and Osh\u2013\nIsfana road; and (ii) $48 million for annual maintenance of all MOTC-administered roads. While \nfunds for improvement of regional corridors will be sourced mainly from international financial \ninstitutions, financing road maintenance at the required level remains a challenge. However, it \nhas  increased  the  total  allocation  for  roads  11-fold  since  2000,  and  threefold  since  2005 \n(Table A2.3).  \n \nTable A2.3: Budgetary Allocation to the Road Subsector, 2000\u20132007 \n(Som \u2018000) \nItem  2000  2003  2005  2007 \nCapital Investments  38,919  93,219  209,350  319,430 \nRoad Maintenance  74,339  99,996  221,674  1,058,758 \nAdministration  16,683  29,624  40,790  78,700 \n  Total  131,941  224,842  473,819  1,458,895 \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n11.  The Government has invested nearly three times more in 2007 in comparison to 2004, \nand donor financing has increased by about 160% (Table A2.4). About 60%\u201365% of the total \ngovernment investment has been in maintenance.

Annual allocation for road maintenance is made up of two parts: the original allocation \nand supplementary allocation. The original allocation in 2003 was Som157.37 million. Usually at \n ", "22  Appendix 2 \nthe middle of the year, following requests for emergency repairs (mostly caused by landslides), \na supplementary budget is allocated. In 2003, an additional amount of Som67.5 million was \nallocated to MOTC (about Som42million for the Bishkek\u2013Osh road and Som26 million for the \nrest of the network). Over the years, the supplementary budget varied while the original budget \nremained relatively consistent. \n \n13.  The average road maintenance expenditure of the MOTC network is $375 per km, but \nthe distribution is skewed toward the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. This amount is far lower than the \nquoted figure of $2,000 per km needed to maintain a road network adequately. Moreover, only \n20% of the maintenance work is routine, giving a very low average figure of $60 per km for the \nnetwork. In some cases, roads have deteriorated so much that the size of potholes does not \npermit any further routine maintenance and major repairs are needed. \n \n14.  The Bishkek\u2013Osh Road Directorate accounts for about 10% of the total network but \nreceives 40% of the annual budget allocation. On a per-kilometer basis, it means that in 2003 \nthe  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  spent  $1,327  per  km  while  over  the  rest  of  the  network  cost  only \n$257 per km.  \n \nE.  Safety \n15.  Accident statistics over the past 10 years are shown in Table A2.5.

Increasing speed and reducing surface roughness by rehabilitating the 500 kilometer \n(km)  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road\u2014part  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n(CAREC) Transport Corridor 1,1 connecting the Kyrgyz Republic with the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC)\u2014would benefit road users as well as vehicle owners. An earlier study of the \nfeasibility of rehabilitating this road showed that an investment of about $200 million would be \nneeded, and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) on the investment would be nearly 15% \nand the net present value (NPV) of the benefits nearly $40 million over the 25-year life of the \nroad. The economic analysis examined the expected contribution of the project road to the \ncountry and region, based on a comparison of with- and without-project scenarios in accordance \nwith  the Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Project  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB).2 The analysis covers 2009\u20132032, comprising 5 years of implementation and 20 years of \noperation, expressed in mid-2008 dollar prices.   \n \n2.  The section from km 400 to km 439 will be the first to be rehabilitated. It is financed \nunder the CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project 3 (Project 1), financed \nby ADB. About 75 km (km 365\u2013km 400 and km 439\u2013km 479) will be rehabilitated under the \npresent  project\u2014CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1  (Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road)  Project  2  (the \nProject)\u2014at a total cost of $62.5 million, which would include a customs inspection facility at \nkm 479. The present analysis used the base data from Project 1, with some adjustments to \ntraffic growth and rates and costs, to account for the economic slowdown since mid-2008.  \n \nB.

Economic Costs \n \n7.  Construction Costs. The economic costs were estimated based on the financial cost of \nthe capital expenditure, including physical contingencies, but excluding price contingencies, \ninterest during construction, and taxes and duties. It was assumed that the financial crisis of \n2008 has not had a significant effect on costs as evidenced by the current prices of bitumen, \ncement, steel, etc., and people\u2019s value of time. Using a world price numeraire, non-tradable \ncosts were converted from financial to economic costs by applying a standard conversion factor \nof  0.85.4 The  construction  period  of  the  project  road  was  estimated  based  on  the  project \nimplementation schedule.

Maintenance Costs. It was assumed that the existing gravel and/or paved surfaces \nwould require about $1,200 per km annually for routine maintenance, and paved road sections \nwould require resealing with a single bituminous layer every 5\u20137 years at an average cost of \n$35,000 per km. These rates are based on Project 1 data, which are not expected to change as \na result of the economic crisis.    \n \n9.  Road User Costs. Vehicle cost data by vehicle type and road condition of each road \nsection used in the Project for forecasting vehicle operating costs and road agency costs for the \nwith- and without-project cases were used in the present analysis, with minor modification to \noperating costs to reflect lower gasoline prices compared with 2008.  \n \n10.  Additional benefits, such as savings in environmental and road accident costs, were not \ncalculated as there is no reliable data and the current level of traffic on the project road is \nrelatively low. It is assumed that savings that could be accrued from these contributors are \ncurrently negligible.  \n                                                 \n4  Economic conversion factor is adopted from ADB. 2008.

Assuming a 5-year construction period for the entire road, the Highway Development \nand Management Model (HDM-4) was used to estimate the incremental economic costs and \nbenefits for each road section over the 20-year service life. The aggregate costs and benefits \nare shown in Table A7.5. The estimated EIRR over the 20-year service life is 12.8% and the \nNPV  is  $10.8  million.  However,  the  HDM  predicts  that  the  road  could  be  functional  at  a \ndiminishing level of service and benefits until the terminal year 2036. The EIRR reaches 14.4% \nand the NPV increases to $49.7 million when the terminal value is considered. The underlying \nassumptions after 2030 are (i) traffic growth gradually declines to 6% per annum in line with \ngross domestic product growth, and (ii) upkeep of the road becomes uneconomical and the road \nwill be allowed to deteriorate to a level until it is reconstructed in 2037. \n \nTable A7.5: Corridor Improvement Costs and Benefits \n($ million) \nEconomic Benefits  Net \nEconomic Costs \nYear  Normal + Diverted     Generated  Economic \nCapital  Recurrent  VOC  Time  VOC  Time  Benefit \n2009  26.760  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  (16.721) \n2010  55.526  0.000  (2.777) (0.004)  0.000  0.000  (54.633) \n2011  50.558  0.000  (3.353) (0.005)  0.000  0.000  (51.602) \n2012  22.054  0.000  (0.392) 0.001  0.104  0.000  (21.832) \n2013  4.742  0.168  3.683  0.064  0.267  0.006  (0.485) \n2014  0.000  0.269  8.490  0.078  0.711  0.008  10.450 \n2015  0.000  0.323  8.501  0.082  0.718  0.008  9.618 \n2016  0.000  0.288  8.692  0.084  0.729  0.008  12.099 \n2017  0.000  0.257  7.830  0.062  0.667  0.006  11.973 \n2018  2.525  0.230  7.189  0.063  0.612  0.006  5.377 \n2019  1.852  0.205  7.665  0.064  0.646  0.006  7.258 \n2020  1.591  0.183  7.258  0.066  0.620  0.007  7.614 \n2021  0.000  0.164  6.870  0.068  0.588  0.007  7.557 \n2022  0.000  0.146  7.377  0.069  0.624  0.007  8.510 \n2023  0.000  0.130  7.577  0.073  0.647  0.007  8.414 \n2024  0.000  0.116  8.300  0.077  0.711  0.008  10.655 \n2025  1.142  0.104  7.376  0.075  0.623  0.007  8.241 \n2026  0.838  0.093  5.587  0.050  0.487  0.005  5.291 \n2027  0.720  0.083  6.593  0.048  0.576  0.005  6.967 \n2028  0.000  0.074  6.145  0.034  0.530  0.003  6.931 \n2029  0.000  0.066  6.450  0.032  0.563  0.003  7.196 \n2030  0.000  0.059  6.405  0.031  0.561  0.003  8.000 \n2031  0.000  0.053  4.050  0.029  0.355  0.003  4.437 \n2032   (7.040)  0.047  5.272  0.050  0.456  0.005  12.824 \nNPV  161.269  3.059  130.787  1.191  11.795  0.119  14.139 \nEIRR        12.80% \n ( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, VOC = vehicle operating costs. \nNotes: 1.

Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Project will indirectly benefit more than 2 million people living in the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road corridor, 51% of whom are \nwomen dominant in intra- and inter-oblast (province) trade and commercial activities in the Kyrgyz Republic. Two of the three \noblasts through which the road passes have poverty levels that are below the national average of 46%. Extreme poverty in \nthese two oblasts is almost double the national average of 13.5%. These are mainly rural oblasts where agriculture is the \nmain source of income for the residents. They consider improvement of the road to be critical for developing these areas.  \n \nRoad construction work would create several opportunities for direct and indirect employment over the 3-year implementation \nperiod. Thereafter, the maintenance work, which will be outsourced to national firms, will create longer-term employment and \nservice opportunities.   \n \nInformation and periodic seminars on HIV prevention will be made available through the construction company to people \ndirectly and indirectly associated with the projects as well as to residents of the project area. These outreach activities will be \ndesigned by the construction company and submitted to the Executing Agency (Ministry of Transport and Communications) \nfor approval as part of the health and safety management part of the quality assurance and quality control plan. ADB will \nreview and make specific recommendations, if necessary. The responsibility for preparing and implementing such a plan will \nbe an integral part of the construction contract.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  39 \nB.

These surveys and meetings raised awareness and gained local support. There were \nextensive consultations with local communities at Naryn and At-Bashi in selecting the final road alignment; and due \nconsideration was given to technical, environmental, social, resettlement, and economic impacts of the selected road \nalignment.  \n \nInitial consultation revealed that the Project will not negatively affect people\u2019s livelihoods, social and cultural habits, incomes, \nand the way of participating in socioeconomic development activities of the local communities. Therefore, the Project does not \ninvolve sensitive social or participatory issues, and no concerns were raised by the interested groups. Project stakeholders \nexpressed support for the Project.

The main purpose is to rehabilitate part of the Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart road, which is a 539 kilometer (km) international road linking the Kyrgyz Republic with \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s Country Development and Road \nSector Development strategies for 2007\u201320101 identified rehabilitation of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nroad as one of the priority tasks in the transport sector. Therefore, the Government, acting \nthrough  its  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC),  has  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and other donors to finance upgrading the road to improve safety, \nlower vehicle operating costs, improve market access for people in the region, and increase \ntrade and transit links between the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC.  \n \n2.  Rehabilitation will be done in phases. The first phase will include the section between \nthe Dolon Pass and Ak Beit Pass (km 280\u2013km 480). The sections from Ak Beit to the border \nwith the PRC and from the Dolon Pass to Bishkek will be included in subsequent phases.  \n \n3.  Summary  Initial  Environmental  Examination. An initial environmental examination \n(IEE) of the first phase was made in 2008 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines.2 The IEE covered the sections (km 365\u2013km 400 and km 439\u2013km 479) to be improved \nunder the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart Road) Project 2 (the Project). This is the summary of the IEE report. \n \n4.  Scope of the Initial Environmental Examination. The scope included (i) collection of \ninformation  related  to  the  environmental  conditions  along  the  proposed  road  section, \n(ii) assessment  of  potential  environmental  impacts,  (iii)  development  of  preventive  and/or \nmitigation  measures  for  significant  impacts,  (iv)  assessment  of  alternative  alignments  and \ntechnologies,  (v)  elaboration  of  environmental  management  and  environmental  monitoring \nplans, and (vi) public consultation. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n5.  Type and Category of Project. The Project involves improvement of the existing road \nand construction of inspection facilities. The main activities include (i) earthwork and erosion \ncontrol,  (ii)  concrete  and  drainage  works,  (iii)  asphalt  concrete  works,  (iv)  traffic  safety \nmeasures, and (v) construction of inspection areas and buildings. No significant realignment of \nthe  centerline  is  expected,  which  would  encroach  on  previously  undisturbed  areas.  No \nconstruction and/or rehabilitation of feeder roads are included in the Project. The environmental \nclassification  for  the  Project  is  category  B  under  the  ADB  environmental  categorization \nrequirements.  \n \n6.  Location. The Bishkek\u2013Torugart road is located in the east\u2013central part of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and links its capital (Bishkek), Issyk-Kul and Naryn oblasts (provinces), and Xingjian \nUygur Autonomous Region of the PRC. The IEE covers road sections located in Naryn and At-\nBashi rayons (districts) of Naryn oblast (Figure A9). \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2007.

Magnitude of Operation. The road sections from the Dolon Pass to the Ak Beit Pass \nwill be rehabilitated as a two-lane road, with a carriageway width of 7 meters (m) and a roadbed \nwidth of 15 m (road category III, according to Kyrgyz Republic road standards SNIP 2.05.02-\n85).3 The proposed improvement options are (i) road upgrading on the existing alignment; \n(ii) road safety (road markings, road signs, and guide posts); and (iii) reconstruction of a number \nof bridges and culverts. \n \n8.  Alternatives  Considered.  If the no-action alternative is adopted, the existing road will \ncontinue to deteriorate, transportation costs and travel times will continue to increase, and access of \nlocal communities to markets in Bishkek will be affected. Alternatives on the location and the \ntechnology of improving the Bishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart road suggested in previous projects were as \nfollows: \n \n(i)  Providing  a  bypass  of  Naryn  town  from  the  west.  This  alternative  was \ndetermined not feasible as it runs through a residential part of the town for 6.0\u2013\n7.5 km and can cause substantial noise and air pollution, and reduce road safety.  \n \n \n                                                 \n3  SNIP is a Russian abbreviation for \u201cconstruction rules and regulations\u201d, a standard that extends to the design of \nnew roads and reconstruction of existing roads.   \n ", "  Appendix 9  43 \n(ii)  Landslide-prone area at Kyzyl-Bel Pass (km 355\u2013km 357). Three alternatives \nwere examined: providing a bypass of the landslide-prone section, a viaduct solution, \nand using the existing route. The Kyrgyz Design Institute, which is the design arm of \nMOTC, defined using the existing route in combination with geotechnical measures \ntoward landslide as the optimal alternative. \n \n(iii)  Providing a bypass of the At-Bashi Ridge from the east. This would require \nconstruction  of  a  long  section  of  new  road  through  a  remote  and  relatively \nundisturbed area. Construction of a new road was determined to be beyond the \nscope of the Project. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n9.  The  potentially  affected  environment  is  described  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines in terms of its physical, ecological, and socioeconomic resources, each \nof which is summarized below. \n \n1.  Physical Resources \n \n10.  Topography. The section is located within the mountain system of the Internal Tien-\nShan. The section begins near the Dolon Pass (altitude 3,030 m) at km 280. From the Dolon \nPass, the right-of-way (ROW) descends to the Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk Gorge and continues to the \nMiddle Naryn Valley, where it passes through the eastern part of Naryn town (altitude 2,100 m) \nand crosses the Naryn River. A few kilometers farther on, the section ascends to the Kyzyl Bel \nPass (altitude 2,500 m) and Char Pass (2,600 m), and crosses them to enter the At-Bashi \nValley. The section traverses the At-Bashi Valley parallel to the At-Bashi Ridge, until it reaches \nthe western part of the ridge. It then turns south and ascends to the Ak Beit Pass (altitude \n3,284 m), crosses the northern branch of the At-Bashi Ridge, and continues down to the Arpa \nValley. The final point of the section is located at the Ak Beit Pass in the Arpa Valley at km 476. \n \n11.  Geological and Seismic Characteristics. Geologically, the section is located within the \nMiddle Tien-Shan that is separated from the North Tien-Shan by so-called \u201cNikolaev line\u201d. The \nline (fault) crosses the section several kilometers to the south of the Dolon Pass. The whole \nsection lies within the area where the probability of an earthquake is assessed as 8 , i.e., two \n2\nseismic events with a magnitude of 8 points on the Richter scale over 100 years. \n \n12.  Soils and Permafrost. The project area comprises a number of soils that belong to soils \nof mountain slopes and soils of intermountain valleys: mountain meadow steppe subalpine soil, \nmountain dark-chestnut soil, mountain light-chestnut soil, mountain valley light-chestnut soil, \nmountain light-chestnut soil, mountain valley light-brown soil, and mountain meadow steppe \nalpine soil. The top of the Dolon Pass (km 282\u2013km 283) and the Ak Beit Pass (km 464\u2013km 476) \nare located within island permafrost distribution areas. \n \n13.  Climate and Air Quality. The climate in the Internal Tien-Shan is continental with little \nrain, cool summers, and cold winters. Climatic conditions vary considerably with elevation. The \naverage winter temperature ranges from \u201325\u00b0\u0421 to \u201345\u00b0\u0421 (the lowest may exceed \u201354\u00b0\u0421), while \nin summer it varies from 20\u00b0\u0421 to 30\u00b0\u0421. In winter, frosts occur in all regions. Rain and snow \nusually fall in autumn, winter, and spring. Average yearly precipitation is 230\u2013560 millimeters. \nThe air quality is generally good, except on un-surfaced sections where dust generated from \npassing vehicles was observed. There are no ambient air quality monitoring stations near the \nsection. \n ", "44  Appendix 9   \n \n14.  Hydrology. The alignment crosses the River Naryn, the largest in the Kyrgyz Republic, \nas well as two other major rivers, the At-Bashi and the On-Archa. On descent from the Dolon \nPass, it runs parallel to the Karaunkur and Ottuk rivers. High groundwater tables occur in Kara-\nSuu and Ottuk villages. An initial visual assessment suggests that water quality is good. This \nappears to be confirmed by reports that the rivers support a healthy and diverse population of \nfish and macroinvertebrates. Chemical analysis and analysis of macrozoobenthos in major \nrivers  of  the  project  area  was  carried  out  as  part  of  the  environmental  assessment.  The \nchemical analysis of samples from the Naryn, At-Bashi, On-Archa, and Karaunkur rivers was \nconducted in the laboratory of the Kyrgyz Agency on Hydrometeorology. It was concluded that \nthe  water  quality  of  all  the  samples  was  good,  and  pollutant  concentrations  were  within \nacceptable standards. The presence of a diverse range of macrozoobenthos species supports \nthis finding. \n \n15.  Natural Hazards. Natural hazards related to the section include landslides, mudflows \nand seasonal flooding, rockfalls, and avalanches. The section is susceptible to a massive \nlandslide in the proximity of the Kyzyl\u2013Bel Pass at km 355\u2013km 356. The possibility of mudflow \nexists at km 300, 306, 312, 451, and 455. At km 60, the ROW is currently destroyed by a \nmudflow. Rockfalls can pose a risk to the section at km 285\u2013km 303 and km 354\u2013km 355. \nAvalanche-prone areas are located in the Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk Gorge at km 287\u2013km 313, and the \nKyzyl\u2013Bel and Char passes at km 353\u2013km 362. \n \n16.  Noise  and  Vibration.  The  majority  of  the  alignment  runs  through  areas  with  no \nsettlements, but only mountains, hills, and open steppe. Rare settlements through which the \nroad  corridor  runs  are  Naryn  town  and  the  villages  of  Karaunkur,  Ottuk,  Kara-Suu,  and \nKarabulung. Although no sensitive receptors such as schools and hospitals were noted near the \nROW, noise and vibration are a serious concern to the communities; this was raised repeatedly \nduring public consultations. Dwellings are typically made of clay brick. For those located close to \nthe roadside, noise and vibration from heavy trucks have the potential to affect the houses and \ntheir occupants significantly. In addition, it was noted during the field investigations that the \nactual speed of vehicles passing through the settlements often exceed the speed limits. This \ncontributes to safety and noise problems. \n \n2.  Ecological Resources \n \n17.  Flora.  The  distribution  of  flora  in  the  project  area  fulfills  the  vertical  zoning  rule. \nSubalpine meadows are typical of the Dolon Pass. At lower altitudes, they change to fescue \nsteppe, artemisia deserts, and cropland near Naryn town. Fescue steppe occurs to the south of \nNaryn. The At-Bashi Valley is largely cropland, which changes to fescue steppe in the western \npart of the valley. In the Ak Beit Pass area, the flora is typical high-altitude meadow steppe. In \nthe Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk Gorge, the road passes through areas of Naryn forestry with floodplain \nand slope forests. \n \n18.  Fauna. The faunal associations dominant in the project area are shown in Table A9.1.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  45 \nTable A9.1: Dominant Terrestrial Faunal Associations \nTerrestrial Fauna \nArea \nAmphibians Reptiles  Birds  Mammals \nDolon Pass    lidless skink  red-mantled rose  Tien-Shan shrew, \nfinch, rufous-backed  narrow-skulled \nredstart   vole \n \nKaraunkur Gorge,  green toad  lidless skink  rock and white- gray marmot, \nKyzyl-Bell Pass, east  capped bunting,  mouse, gray \nand west part of At- linnet, chukar  hamster  \nBashi Valley \n \nOttuk Gorge  green toad  steppe  Isabelline and  tolai hare, \nrunner  common chat, pink- Siberian jerboa \nbilled lark \n \nMiddle Naryn Valley,  green toad  steppe  white and yellow  house mouse, \ncentral part of At- runner,  chat, red-headed  gray hamster \nBashi valley   diced snake  bunting \n \nAk Beit Pass  green toad  lidless-skink  Isabelline and  mole vole, \ncommon chat,  marmot, narrow-\nHodgson's rosy  skulled vole \nfinch, snow finch \nSource: 1987.

Twenty-two ecosystems are distinguished in the Kyrgyz Republic, and \nseven  of  them  were  found  in  the  project  area.  An  assessment  of  ecosystems  health  by \nbiological indicators (in points, from 1 = poor to 3 = excellent) was undertaken as part of this \nIEE.

The  condition  of  ecosystems  can  be  assessed  \u201csatisfactory\u201d.  Sensitive  ecosystems \nidentified  by  the  survey  are  mid-mountain  spruce  forest,  mid-mountain  floodplain, \nalpine/subalpine and high-mountain meadow steppe. The survey also reports that the migratory \nroutes of hoofed mammals pass near the Ak Beit (km 473\u2013km 474) and Dolon passes (km 283). \n \n \n \n ", "46  Appendix 9   \n21.  Protected Areas. The section does not run through any especially protected area. One \nprotected area is found close to the project area\u2014the Salkyn\u2013Tor State Natural Park, several \nkilometers to the east of the road corridor (Figure A9). According to International Union for \nConservation of Nature classification, a national park (category II) is a protected area managed \nmainly for ecosystem protection and recreation.  \n \n3.  Socioeconomic Resources \n \n22.  Industry and Agriculture. Industry in Naryn oblast is represented by the electric power \nindustry, mining, food processing, and the construction materials industry. Naryn oblast is an \nimportant agricultural region, specifically in animal agriculture. It supports a large population of \nsheep and horses. In 2005, the industrial production of Naryn oblast was Som754.1 million and \nagricultural production was Som4,786.1 million. \n \n23.  Tourism. Naryn oblast has vast tourist potential that is presently not exploited. Major \ntourist attractions in Naryn oblast are Tash-Rabat (a caravanserai dating to the 15th century), \nthe site of the ancient town of Koshoi-Korgon, and the high-altitude Song-Kul Lake.  \n \n24.  Land  Use. The Land Code of the Kyrgyz Republic specifies the following land-use \ncategories:  (i)  agricultural  land;  (ii)  settlement  land;  (iii)  land  of  industry,  transport, \ncommunication, defense, and other nonagricultural purposes; (iv) lands of specially protected \nnatural territories; (v) forest land; (vi) water land; and (vii) reserve land. The land use in the \nproject  area  is  mostly  agricultural;  pasturelands  are  prevalent  in  mountain  areas,  while \ncroplands are prevalent in the valleys. The Law on Highways specifies the category \u201cland of \nroad transport\u201d. \n \n25.  Non-Transport  Infrastructure.  Infrastructure  within  the  section  is  represented  by \nelectric power lines, telecommunication lines, water supply systems, irrigation systems, and \ncanalization systems. As the section crosses non-transport infrastructure in Naryn and other \nportions of the project area, coordination with the relevant authorities will be required. \n \n26.  Transport  Networks.  The  Bishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart  road  is  an  international  road \ncorridor and one of two roadways linking the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC. On a larger scale, \nthe  road  is  part  of  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  1  linking  Kashi  in  the  PRC  to  Almaty  in \nKazakhstan. \n \n27.  Population  and  Communities.  Naryn  oblast\u2019s  population  was  reported  as \n266,500 people (2006), the majority of whom (82.2%) live in rural areas. Communities served by \nthe road include Karaunkur, Ottuk, and Naryn (in Naryn rayon), and At-Bashi, Kara-Suu, and \nKarabulung (in At-Bashi rayon) villages. Karaunkur (km 295) is a small village comprising about \n10 houses located in Karaunkur Gorge. There is one three-storey building and several clay-brick \ndwellings.  Ottuk  (km  314\u2013km  316)  is  a  larger  settlement  with  a  population  of  about \n1,300 people. Houses are mostly made of clay brick. Naryn town (km 347\u2013km 352) with a \npopulation of about 40,000 is the largest settlement. This stretch has both multi-storey buildings \nand small dilapidated houses. At-Bashi (population 11,300) is a rayon center several kilometers \nfrom  the  alignment.  Other  settlements  in  the  project  area  are  Kara-Suu  (km  410)  with  a \npopulation  of  4,540,  and  Karabulung  (km  417)  with  1,508  inhabitants;  the  alignment  runs \nthrough both villages. People usually use clay brick to build their houses. Ak Beit is a very small \nvillage of five houses at km 464. The ethnic composition in the project area is homogeneous \nand consists of virtually only Kyrgyz people.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  47 \n28.  Cultural and Historical Heritage. According to the List of Historical and Cultural Sites \nof National Significance, there are 12 historical and archeological sites in Naryn rayon and 28 in \nAt-Bashi rayon. Although none of the sites are located within the ROW, some of them are within \nseveral kilometers of it. There are also about 10 Muslim graveyards in the proximity of the road.  \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n29.  Potential  impacts  have  been  identified  by  reviewing  each  relevant  parameter  and \nscreening out insignificant impacts from those that can have significant adverse impacts in the \nconstruction and operation phases of the Project. It was concluded that implementation of the \nProject will have significant social benefits and, if the prescribed mitigation and management \nmeasures are fully implemented, it is unlikely to have major adverse environmental impacts. \n \n1.  Physical Resources \n \n  a.   Topography \n \n30.  Impacts.  Topographic  impacts  could  occur  because  of  altered  road  embankments, \nborrow-pit excavations, and quarry operations.  \n \n31.  Mitigation. No significant cut and fill operations are required, so no significant impacts to \ntopographic characteristics are anticipated.  \n \n   b.    Soil and Permafrost \n \n32.  Impacts. Soil impacts may occur because of altered road embankments, borrow-pit \nexcavations,  and  quarry  operations.  However,  no  significant  cut  and  fill  operations  are \nanticipated.  Provided  that  erosion  prevention  measures  in  the  construction  and  operation \nphases are taken, no substantial adverse impacts to soils are foreseen. No long-term impacts to \narea soils caused by increased pollutant levels are anticipated. The permafrost island areas \noccur at altitudes of more than 3,000 m, so potential impacts to the permafrost areas are likely \nto occur during the construction and operation phases near the Dolon (km 282\u2013km 283) and \nAk Beit passes (km 364\u2013km 376).  \n \n33.  Mitigation. Mitigation measures include integration of the geocryological considerations \ninto the detailed design by surveying at the pre-project stage the current condition of permafrost \nat the Dolon and Ak Beit passes, identifying and mapping areas of concern (if any), and \ndeveloping mitigation measures. The mitigation measures may include the avoidance of areas \nwith degraded permafrost and engineering measures.  \n \n    c.  Air Quality \n \n34.  Impacts. Air quality impacts could occur in both the construction and operation phases, \nbut no significant violations of standards are anticipated amid the provisions noted below.  \n \n35.  Mitigation. Contracts will require asphalt and hot-mix plants to be located at least 500 m \nfrom the nearest sensitive receptor (e.g., schools, hospitals, or communities), and they will not \nbe located within sensitive ecosystems. Operators will be required to install emission controls. \nBlasting (if any) will be carried out using small charges, and dust-generating items will be \nconveyed under cover. Road surfaces and excavation and construction sites will be sprayed \nwith water to keep them moist for dust control. Trucks carrying earth, sand, or stone will be \n ", "48  Appendix 9   \ncovered with tarpaulins to avoid spillage. Contracts will require pre-construction and routine air \nquality monitoring. Construction sites, asphalt plants, quarries, and transportation roads will be \nmonitored for total suspended particles during the construction phase. An ambient air quality \nmonitoring station will be set up in Naryn town to monitor pollution in the vicinity of the road \ncorridor in the operation phase. (Currently, there is no ambient air quality station in Naryn.) The \nupgraded road will improve air quality and reduce dust emissions, as the sections of road that \ndo not have an asphalt surface will be upgraded and covered with asphalt. \n \n    d.   Surface and Groundwater \n \n36.  Impacts. Surface water impacts could occur during the construction period as a result of \nthe erosion and construction activities. Provided that road drainage systems are improved, \nenhancement of water quality can occur at the operation phase. No impacts are anticipated to \navailability of water for domestic or agricultural use, except in Naryn town where water supply \npipelines may be temporarily impacted during construction. Potential impacts to local water \nsupplies  include  the  possibility  of  temporary  labor  camps  wastewater  disposal  during  the \nconstruction period. No impacts to groundwater resources are anticipated as a result of the \nproposed activities in the road corridor in either the construction or operation phases.  \n \n37.  Mitigation. The Project will install adequately sized drainage facilities to accommodate \nforeseeable flood levels, and will stabilize downstream slopes with concrete or rock gabions or \nwalls to avoid erosion. Potential adverse impacts to the surface hydrology in the construction \nphase of the Project will be avoided through the enforcement of contract provisions. Such \nprovisions will ensure that construction camps and other potential sources of secondary impacts \nare properly sited and provided with drainage and wastewater facilities. Water quality will be \nmonitored by chemical analysis and bio-indicators during construction and operational phases. \nMonitoring points will be located at the Karaunkur, Ottuk, On-Archa, Naryn, and At-Bashi rivers. \n \n    e.  Natural Hazards \n \n38.  Impact. Landslides, rockfalls, avalanches, and mudflows may be triggered by different \nnatural and anthropogenic factors, pose hazards to people and infrastructure, and may block \nroads.  \n \n39.  Mitigation.  For  the  landslide-prone  area  (km  355\u2013km  357),  the  Design  Institute \nproposes using the existing road in combination with the geotechnical measures. Mitigation \nmeasures for rockfall-prone areas will include installation of rockfall retaining structures and \nrockfall warning signs as will be decided in the detailed design stage of the Project. Mudflows \nwill be mitigated by installation of box culverts. Artificial release of avalanches with artillery (a \ncommonly used method for avalanche control in the Kyrgyz Republic) will be used. \n \n    f.  Noise and Vibration \n \n40.  Impacts. According to local people from Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung \nvillages living in proximity to the road, noise and vibration have an impact on their houses. \nSpecial concern is expressed over overloaded trucks transporting cargo to and from the PRC.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  49 \n41.  Mitigation. A survey that includes baseline instrumental measurements of noise and \nvibration levels and a damage susceptibility study will be conducted, along with inspection of the \npresent  condition  of  houses,  at  the  preconstruction  stage.  In  case  of  excessive  noise  or \nvibration  levels,  remedial  measures\u2014such  as  special  road  surface  design,  noise  barriers, \nplanting trees, or anti-vibration layers\u2014will be used along with monitoring. \n \n2.  Ecological Resources \n \n    a.  Flora \n \n42.  Impact.  No  threatened  or  endangered  plant  species  are  located  in  the  potentially \naffected ROW and no adverse impacts to such species are likely to occur as a result of the \nrehabilitation activities. Plant species present within the ROW are either introduced species or \nubiquitous native species, which are highly tolerant of grazing, compaction, and other physical \ndisturbances. Construction activities will affect only a narrow band of vegetation adjacent to the \nexisting road. No substantial removal of trees or other vegetation is anticipated. \n  \n43.  Mitigation.  The  Project  will  include  roadside  planting  to  ensure  slope  stabilization. \nExisting trees and roadside plants will be retained. Topsoil from borrow-pit areas will be saved \nand reused.  \n \n   b.   Fauna \n \n44.  Impact. Habitat fragmentation as well as accidents involving wildlife can occur as a \nresult of blocking wildlife migration routes near the Dolon and Ak Beit passes. Construction \ncamp workers and drivers can contribute to poaching or hunting wildlife.  \n \n45.  Mitigation. Mitigation will include an extended study of wildlife migratory routes during \nthe detailed design stage, and providing findings on the exact locations of routes and behavior \nof  wildlife,  together  with  recommendations  on  specific  mitigation  measures  to  the  project \nimplementation  unit.  Clauses  should  be  written  into  construction  contracts  resulting  in \nimmediate dismissal and prosecution of individuals involved in poaching and wildlife hunting. \n \n   c.   Ecosystems \n \n46.  Impact. The field assessment of ecosystems conducted within the frame of the IEE \nshows  that,  whereas  no  significant  impacts  are  anticipated  for  mid-mountain  steppe  and \nmeadow ecosystems as they have already experienced broad-scale changes as a result of \novergrazing, mid-mountain floodplain and meadow ecosystems in the Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk Gorge \nand sub-alpine ecosystems (Dolon and Ak Beit passes) are at a greater risk of degradation.  \n \n47.  Mitigation. Mitigation measures to reduce risks posed to ecosystem health include siting \nof  construction  camps,  asphalt  plants,  and  other  related  facilities  outside  environmentally \nsensitive areas.  \n \n    d.  Protected Areas \n \n48.  Impact. No direct impacts to the Salkyn-Tor State National Park are anticipated. The \nProject could have an indirect impact on the national park by attracting more tourists. The \npotential impact is perceived as beneficial and within the environmental management capacities \nof the national park administration. \n ", "50  Appendix 9   \n3.  Socioeconomic Resources \n \n  a.  International Trade \n \n49.  Impact.  The  improvement  of  the  road  is  anticipated  to  have  positive  impacts  for \ninternational  trade  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  PRC  and  other  countries  by \ndecreasing transportation costs and travel time. Modernization of the customs infrastructure and \ncomplementary  measures  from  the  Government  to  improve  customs  procedures\u2014such  as \nenforcement of overloading regulations, longer hours of operation, and introduction of one-\nwindow  operation  whereby  all  transactions  are  undertaken  together\u2014will  facilitate  border \ncrossing and result in decreased transportation costs and travel time. \n \n    b.  Industry, Agriculture, and Services \n \n50.  Impact. The improved road and modernization of customs facilities and procedures will \nenhance import and export opportunities for industries and facilitate connectivity and access of \nagricultural producers to Bishkek and Issyk-Kul oblast markets. It will have a positive impact on \nthe construction materials industry. Agricultural producers will have better access to the markets \nof Bishkek and Issyk-Kul oblast.  \n \n51.  Mitigation. To gain the most benefit from the Project, training on the development of \nroadside businesses should be organized for the local population, and microcredit programs \nlaunched as complementary projects.  \n \n    c.  Tourism \n \n52.  Impact. The improved road and modernized customs facilities and procedures will have \na positive impact on tourism development. Tourists traveling from and to PRC will have more \ncomfortable and faster travel, and local tourist attractions will be more accessible. The local \npopulation will benefit from increased activity such as hotel business, horse rental, handicraft \ntrade, and entrance fees collected from tourists. Provided that the tourist season lasts only for \n3\u20134 months, the potential of tourist attractions is still far from being fully exploited; even if \nincreasing number of tourists visit the area, it can be concluded that no adverse impacts are \nanticipated in the foreseeable future.  \n \n53.  Mitigation. To maximize the benefits of the Project, rehabilitation of the road corridor \nshould be complemented with projects on the facilitation of border-crossing procedures for \ntourists, and development of ecotourism ventures. Tourist-oriented road signage should be \nintroduced. \n \n    d.  Transport Networks \n \n54.  Impact.  Detours and traffic inconveniences will occur during construction. Following \nconstruction, the primary transport impact of the Project will be to improve the performance of \nthe transport sector and greatly facilitate the flow of traffic, goods, and travelers.  \n \n55.  Mitigation.  Care  will  be  taken  during  the  construction  period  to  ensure  that  traffic \ndisruptions to road transport are minimized. Traffic management plans should be prepared. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  51 \n    e.  Health and Road Safety \n \n56.  Impact.  Improvement  of  the  road  corridor  will  contribute  to  a  safer  journey  and  a \nreduction in the number of road accidents, and will facilitate access to advanced oblast and \nnational health services. However, the improved road will increase vehicle operating speeds on \nthe road and, if not controlled, accidents involving people and livestock may increase.  \n \n57.  Mitigation. In Naryn, Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Kara-Bulung, provisions should \nbe made for paved shoulders, road signage and speed limits, and service roads for local traffic.  \n \n    f.  Population and Communities \n \n58.  Impact. No adverse impacts on settlement patterns and communities are anticipated.  \n \n59.  Mitigation.  Opportunities  for  complementary  actions  to  strengthen  the  community \naspects of the project area are addressed by the social assessment. In summary, they include \ntraining for people (especially women) living along the road on new opportunities opened by the \nimproved road such as roadside trade, tourist accommodation, and microcrediting of roadside \nbusinesses. \n \n    g.  Cultural and Historical Heritage \n \n60.  Impact. No impacts to archaeological and historic resources are anticipated, with the \nexception of a graveyard (km 314) located close to the alignment that may be affected by \nvibration.  \n \n61.  Mitigation. No mitigation related to known cultural resources is warranted. Contract \nprovisions  are  recommended  to  ensure  that  construction  works  are  suspended,  local \nadministration and state organizations on cultural heritage are informed, and all necessary \nmeasures to protect cultural resources are taken in the event of unexpected discoveries. The \nfencing of the graveyard located at km 314 should be strengthened. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n \n62.  Legal and Institutional Framework. According to the Law on Environmental Expertise, \nany project activities should be preceded by preparation and submission of an assessment of \nenvironmental impacts (OVOS [Russian acronym]), and its approval by Ecological Expertise \n(State Environmental Review). The OVOS documentation should include endorsements from \nlocal  administration;  sanitary  control  bodies;  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Water  Resources  and \nProcessing Industry; and other organizations\u2014depending on environmental attributes affected \nby the Project. \n \n63.  Institutional  Requirements.  The  Investment  Projects  Implementation  Department \n(IPID) will be responsible for ensuring that environmental procedures are incorporated in each \nstage of the work\u2014such as document tender and contract preparation, bid reviews and awards, \nand supervision of preconstruction baseline monitoring\u2014as an integral part of construction \nsupervision.  \n \n \n \n ", "52  Appendix 9   \n64.  IPID  will  be  responsible  for  overall  contract  administration  and  day-to-day  project \nsupervision, including environmental management. An environment and/or social officer will be \nappointed within IPID to be responsible for ensuring the environmental management plan, \nincluding monitoring requirements, are implemented effectively. The construction supervision \nconsultant will assist IPID in its responsibilities, including instrumental environmental monitoring \nof the Project.  \n \n65.  Environmental Monitoring Program. The environmental monitoring program includes \nroutine site inspections and reporting related to soil and erosion control; embankment and \nerosion protection; borrow-pit restoration; noise, vibration, air, and water quality monitoring \n(including baseline and routine periodic water quality monitoring); and terrestrial and/or river \necosystem health monitoring. Specific monitoring provisions include the following:  \n \n(i)  Water  quality.  Baseline  and  periodic  water  quality  monitoring.  This  will  be \ncomplemented with monitoring of water quality by macrozoobenthos (once a year \nfor 2 years). \n \n(ii)  Air quality. Baseline and periodic air quality monitoring.  \n \n(iii)  Noise. Baseline and periodic air quality monitoring. \n \n(iv)  Ecosystem degradation. Routine roadside ecosystem monitoring by indicator \nbird species. \n \n(v)  Land use-related impacts.

Public Consultations \n \n67.  A number of public consultations with experts, local administrations, nongovernment \norganizations, and the public were held in May\u2013June 2008. Informal consultations with the local \npopulation in Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung villages, and with representatives of \nnongovernment  organizations  were  held  in  Bishkek.  A  stakeholder  workshop  for  local \nadministrations of Naryn and At-Bashi rayons was conducted on 16 June 2008. In addition, \nconsultations with experts from the Ministry of Emergency Situations Ministry of Transport and \nCommunications, and Academy of Sciences were held. The comments from previous large \nstakeholder workshops conducted in Naryn and Bishkek in 2006 were used to assess the \nactuality of the problem. \n \n68.  A summary of the opinions of the public consultations is as follows: \n \n(i)  The local population supports the upgrading of the road corridor provided that it \nwill bring more socioeconomic benefits to the local population. \n \n(ii)  Feeder roads were proposed by locals to be included in the Project, specifically two \nroads connecting rayon center At-Bashi and EM-07, and the main street in Naryn \nthat is a part of the road linking Ak-Talaa rayon and Tash-Bashat village. \n \n(iii)  Because of safety and noise/vibration issues, it was proposed that consideration \nbe given to bypasses of Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung villages. \n \n(iv)  Noise and vibration issues were the major concern in Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and \nKarabulung villages and Naryn town. The recent letter from the people of Ottuk to \nMOTC repeatedly raised these issues.  \n \n(v)  Local people should be involved in the road construction. \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n69.  The findings of the IEE are as follows: \n \n(i)  Construction activities under the Project will be largely of a rehabilitation nature \nwithin the previously disturbed road corridor and no significant environmental \nimpacts are anticipated. \n \n(ii)  The study of ecosystems health conducted in the frame of this IEE showed that \nthere are ecosystems in the project area that are more sensitive to environmental \nimpacts\u2014specifically, mid-mountain floodplain and meadow ecosystems located in \nthe Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk gorge, and subalpine ecosystems (Dolon and Ak Beit passes). \n \n(iii)  According to the local people from Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung \nvillages living in proximity to the road, noise and vibration have an impact on their \nhouses.  However,  visual  examination  showed  that  the  houses  are  located \noutside the ROW, and the major problem is probably related to overloaded trucks \nand their noncompliance with the 30 km per hour speed limit.  \n \n ", "56  Appendix 9   \n(iv)  The  examination  of  baseline  water  quality  in  rivers  of  the  project  area  by \nchemical analysis and a bio-indicators survey undertaken within the frame of the \nIEE showed that water quality is good. \n \n70.  The following recommendations are proposed based on the findings of the IEE: \n \n(i)  Environmental provisions in contract. Specific environmental provisions are \nrecommended for inclusion in contract documents, including provisions related \nbut not limited to (a) erosion control and air and water quality control; (b) location \nof asphalt plants, construction camps, and other facilities (not in environmentally \nsensitive areas indicated above); (c) borrow-pit restoration; (d) quarry operations; \n(e) safety provisions; (f) baseline and routine monitoring of air quality, water \nquality, noise, and ecosystem health; and (g) community relations. \n \n(ii)  Environmental monitoring. Baseline noise, vibration, and air quality monitoring \nis recommended at the preconstruction stage in settlements along the road. \n \n(iii)  Capacity  building  for  environmental  management. A training program for \nselected  staff,  and  addressed  to  the  goals  and  techniques  of  environmental \nmanagement activities in road projects, is recommended. \n \n(iv)  Recommended complementary projects. A training program to ensure that \nlocal businesses and populations will be able to use all the benefits provided by \nbeing  adjacent  to  the  international  road  corridor  is  recommended.  A \ncomplementary project to increase the attractiveness of the Salkyn-Tor State \nNational Park for ecotourists is recommended.  \n \nH.  Conclusions \n \n71.  The Project will have significant social benefits and, if the prescribed mitigation and \nmanagement measures are fully implemented, the Project is unlikely to have major adverse \nenvironmental  impacts.  An  environmental  monitoring  plan  has  been  prepared  and \nresponsibilities for implementation assigned. A budget has been allocated for environmental \nmanagement and monitoring. A full environmental impact assessment under ADB guidelines is \nnot required. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090622100957+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rrp: kgz 42399, carec transport corridor, kyrgyz transport development projects, kyrgyz road and highways, adb loan 2533", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090722134930+08'00'", "Title": "CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project 2"}}
