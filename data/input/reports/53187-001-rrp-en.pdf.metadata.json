INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This  is  an  eligible  transaction  under  the  Faster  Approach  to  Small  Nonsovereign \nTransactions  (FAST)  framework.1 The  transaction  involves  an  equity  investment  of  up  to \n$10,000,000 in Tata Capital Growth Fund II (TCGF II) in India.  \n \n2.  TCGF II is a targeted $350 million equivalent Indian rupee private equity fund established \nas a trust under Indian laws and registered as a category II Alternative Investment Fund under \nthe Securities and Exchange Board of India Alternative Investment Fund Regulations.2 The \ninvestment manager and sponsor of TCGF II is Tata Capital Limited (Tata Capital). Through \nTCGF II, Tata Capital proposes to invest primarily equity capital for minority stakes in a portfolio \nof 10\u221212 mainly lower middle-market companies in India, including small and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs). 3 Focus  sectors  for  the  fund  include  financial  services,  health  care, \nmanufacturing, and information technology. Tata Capital does not propose that TCGF II will invest \nin real estate or infrastructure. The climate change impact of the proposed investment is expected \nto be minimal because the renewable energy sector is not a focus.  \n \n3.  Through its proposed investment in TCGF II, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \ncontribute to India\u2019s ongoing economic development (gross domestic product is expected to grow \nby 7.0% in 2019 and 7.2% in 2020) by infusing critical growth capital to well-managed companies \noperating  in  sectors  that  are  benefiting  from  India\u2019s  increasing  domestic  consumption  and \nurbanization.4 The investment\u2019s expected development impact benefits include job creation, \ntechnological innovation and adoption, support for homegrown entrepreneurs, and improvements \nin safeguards and corporate governance standards. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n4.  Description. Tata Capital was established in 2007 as the alternative asset management \nsubsidiary of Tata Sons Limited, the flagship holding company of the Tata Group.5 The Tata \nGroup is the largest business conglomerate in India\u2014it comprises more than 100 operating \ncompanies on six continents across 10 industry clusters (including information technology, steel, \nautomobiles, consumer and retail, infrastructure, financial services, aerospace and defense, \ntourism and travel, telecom and media, trading, and investment)\u2014and employs nearly 700,000 \npeople globally.6  \n \n \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2015. Faster Approach to Small Nonsovereign Transactions. Manila. \n2  The fund is denominated in Indian rupee and accepts capital contributions in Indian rupee and United States (US) \ndollars. ADB will make its capital contributions and receive distributions in US dollars. For the purposes of this FAST \nreport, references will be made to US dollars. International investors may also invest in an offshore feeder fund \nregistered in Singapore, which will make investments in India via Tata Capital Growth Fund II LP. \n3  According to Tata Capital, lower middle market companies are expected to have revenues of at least \u20b9650 million \nwith a track record of profitable operations. SMEs are a subset of lower middle market companies and are defined \nas companies with net tangible assets of at least \u20b930 million according to the Bombay Stock Exchange\u2019s listing \ncriteria. Although not its primary focus, TCGF II may invest a portion of its capital in publicly traded securities \n(including private investments in public equity). \n4  ADB. 2019. Asian Development Outlook Supplement. Manila. \n5  Tata Capital Limited currently acts as investment manager to a family of five funds: Tata Capital Growth Fund, Tata \nOpportunities Fund, Tata Capital Healthcare Fund, Tata Capital Innovations Fund, and Tata Capital Special \nSituations Fund. \n6  Tata Capital Limited. 2018. Private Placement Memorandum relating to Tata Capital Growth Fund II. Mumbai. ", "2 \n5.  TCGF II\u2019s predecessor fund, Tata Capital Growth Fund I (TCGF I), is a 2011 vintage fund \nthat raised about $240 million across both its domestic and offshore fund vehicles. The Mumbai-\nbased TCGF II investment team (which also managed TCGF I) includes managing partner Akhil \nAwasthi, partners Pramod Ahuja and Sanjay Chaudhary, and four investment professionals; and \nis supported by Tata Capital\u2019s administrative staff in Singapore and Mumbai.  \n \n6.  The TCGF II investment team brings substantial experience in private equity, banking, \nconsulting, management, and operations, primarily in India. A. Awasthi has more than 20 years \nof experience in Indian private equity and has helped raise and manage four private equity funds \nwith aggregate total commitments of about $1 billion, most recently with Tata Capital and \npreviously as a partner at Baring Private Equity Asia. The following members of the investment \nteam are sector experts: Sanjay Chaudhary (health care), Madhusudan Rajagopalan (financial \nservices), Vishal Desai (manufacturing), and Ganesh Ramakrishnan (information technology); \neach has demonstrated deal origination, execution, and operational capabilities in prior roles. The \nmajority of the team has worked together since 2010 when TCGF I was raised.  \n \n7.  Investment identification. Tata Capital is one of 5 fund managers in India out of more \nthan 50 that were assessed and evaluated by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department, \nwhich considered TCGF II an attractive investment opportunity based on (i) its alignment with \nADB\u2019s  private  equity  fund  investment  guidelines,  including  management  by  a  seasoned \ninvestment team with solid private equity investment experience; and (ii) the strong performance \nof TCGF I. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department first met with A. Awasthi in September \n2015 and subsequently interacted with him and his team on several occasions to track TCGF I\u2019s \nprogress and performance. In June 2018, Tata Capital commenced fundraising for TCGF II and \napproached ADB for support as it looked to broaden the fund\u2019s institutional investor base.  \n \n8.  The proposed investment in TCGF II will enable ADB to support the growth of well-\nmanaged SMEs in India, which have traditionally relied on commercial banks or capital markets \nfor funding. Stresses in India\u2019s banking sector resulting from an increase in nonperforming assets \nsince 2016 has resulted in banks favoring large corporates with the ability to pledge hard assets \nagainst loans; most SMEs lack this ability, and thus struggle to access appropriately priced bank \nfinancing. Private equity has consequently emerged as a critical source of growth capital for SMEs \nin India, which play a vital role in India\u2019s economic development. For example, micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises constitute 95% of all industrial units in India, account for about 45% of \nindustrial production, and generate 40% of its exports.7 By investing in funds such as TCGF II, \nADB  can  increase  the  growth  capital  available  for  SMEs  and  support  sectors  such  as \nmanufacturing and technology that have important development impacts, including generation of \nskilled and semiskilled employment and technological innovation and adoption in India.  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n9.  TCGF II is targeting to raise $350 million to be invested in a portfolio of 10\u221212 established \ncompanies (mostly with revenues over $10 million). The fund will take primarily minority stakes, \nwith investment expected to average $10 million\u2212$35 million. The expected holding period for the \nfund\u2019s investments is 3\u20135 years. TCGF II\u2019s investment strategy and focus sectors are consistent \nwith TCGF I, and include financial services, health care, manufacturing, and technology sectors.  \n \n10.  The TCGF II investment team will seek to leverage Tata\u2019s strong brand and network to \n \n7  Government of Tamil Nadu. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Department. 2017. Policy Note Demand No. 44. \nChennai. \n ", "3 \n \nsource attractive investment leads and stay current on market intelligence. The fund\u2019s disciplined \nfocus  on  minority  stakes  in  lower  middle-market  companies  and  SMEs  could  provide  a \ncompetitive advantage, because private equity funds in India are increasingly looking to invest \nlarger amounts for majority stakes. This has resulted in TCGF II\u2019s target segment consisting of \ncompanies that are relatively capital-starved given their limited access to bank financing.  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n11.  Ownership. Established as a trust under Indian laws, TCGF II is the Indian onshore \nmaster fund. The fund is sponsored by Tata Capital Limited, an Indian limited liability company \nthat will act as the investment manager. Tata Trustee Company Limited, also an Indian limited \nliability company, will act as trustee to TCGF II. The offshore feeder fund is Tata Capital Growth \nFund II LP, a limited partnership established in Singapore that will raise capital from investors \noutside India. The general partner of the offshore feeder fund is Tata Capital Growth II General \nPartners LLP, a limited liability partnership established in Singapore.8 Tata Capital Advisors \nPrivate Limited (regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore) is the investment manager of \nthe offshore feeder fund. The offshore feeder fund will invest, through its wholly owned subsidiary, \nAlpha TC II Holding Private Limited, in the master fund.

Management. The TCGF II investment team (para. 5) is based in Mumbai. The seven \ninvestment professionals are responsible for sourcing and executing transactions, monitoring the \nportfolio, facilitating value addition to portfolio companies, and executing exit strategies.  \n \n14.  Governance structure. The fund\u2019s investment committee will consist of five members: (i) \nRajiv Sabharwal (chief executive officer [CEO] of Tata Capital); (ii) the three TCGF II partners \n(para. 5), and (iii) Shigeki Usuki (CEO and investment committee representative of New Frontier \nCapital Management).11 The investment committee will make decisions by majority vote. \n  \n15.  Tata Capital has established an advisory board for TCGF II currently comprising three \nrepresentatives from investors of the fund. The advisory board will act as a consultative body to \nTCGF  II  with  regard  to  certain  governance  matters  affecting  its  investors  and,  in  specific \ncircumstances set out in the fund documents, to approve such matters. In addition to the advisory \nboard, Tata Capital has also established a conflict resolution committee (CRC) for TCGF II. The \nrole of the CRC will be to assist in the resolution of specific conflicts of interests on acquisitions \n \n8  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n9  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n10 Integrity and Tax Due Diligence (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2)was conducted in \naccordance with ADB. 2003.

Tata Capital has agreed to \nprovide ADB with a seat on both the advisory board and the CRC. \n \n16.  As with TCGF I, the fund investment team is expected to follow a multistage investment \napproval process. At the outset, the investment team will conduct initial deal evaluations and \ninclude pertinent details in a deal log; the team will then assess whether a deal falls within the \nscope of TCGF II\u2019s investment strategy. If an investment strategy fit is confirmed, the team will \nprepare an initial screening memo (ISM) and an assessment of potential conflicts. The ISM \nincludes transaction details, financial projections, and the investment team\u2019s advice with respect \nto the proposed investment\u2019s potential merits and risks.  \n \n17.  After obtaining any necessary consent from the CRC, the investment team will further \nanalyze the investment opportunity. Based on the ISM, the investment team will engage with the \nmanagement of the target company and/or the financial intermediary that has introduced the deal. \nBased on initial diligence and management interaction, the investment team will then advise the \ninvestment manager whether the opportunity remains attractive in terms of the business potential, \nrisks, and expected price. If the merits are confirmed, the investment manager will sign an \nindicative nonbinding term sheet. \n \n18.  Upon  execution  of  the  nonbinding  term  sheet,  the  investment  team  will  conduct \ncomprehensive business diligence, including accounting, tax, and legal diligence using the \nservices of reputable third-party accounting and legal firms, and subsequently prepare a final \ninvestment  recommendation  note,  which  it  will  present  to  the  investment  committee.  The \ncommittee  may  further  consult  the  CRC  before  making  a  final  investment  decision.  If  the \ninvestment is approved by the investment committee and, if required, the CRC, the investment \nteam will execute the investment documents, and proceed to fund and close the transaction.  \n \nD.

THE ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n20.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $10,000,000 in Tata Capital Growth Fund \nII. ADB\u2019s proposed investment will comprise approximately 2.9% of the fund\u2019s targeted committed \ncapital of $350,000,000 and will not result in ADB becoming the single largest investor in the fund. \n \nB.

Exits may be via strategic sale, \ninitial public offering, sale to financial buyers, seller put and/or buyback, or secondary sale.  \n \n23.  Reporting arrangements. ADB will require Tata Capital to provide (i) quarterly unaudited \naccounts of TCGF II; (ii) details of the investments purchased (including the cost of each such \ninvestment), sold or otherwise disposed of during the preceding quarter; (iii) an update on the \ngeneral performance of the investments (including notification of any matters that would result in \na material change to the prospects of the investments); (iv) details of any services provided by \nTata Capital and its respective associated entities; (v) semiannual unaudited valuation reports; \nand (vi) annual audited accounts of the fund. ADB will require Tata Capital to provide an annual \ndevelopment effectiveness monitoring report for TCGF II. ADB will review this information and \nfollow up if more information or clarifications are needed. If the information received raises issues \nthat could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in TCGF II, ADB could decide to put the fund on \na watch list for more frequent review and closer attention. ADB will also require Tata Capital to \nreport annually on TCGF II\u2019s environmental and social safeguard issues in compliance with its \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS). ADB will monitor the timing and quality \nof the safeguards reports and offer guidance if Tata Capital requires clarification regarding ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard requirements. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n24.  Private sector development. ADB\u2019s investment in TCGF II is expected to encourage \nprivate sector investments in India from other like-minded institutional investors. It will also \npromote sustainable operations and governance best practices among the investee companies \nof the fund, and through a demonstration effect, set standards for other Indian corporates to \nemulate. By assisting in the growth of the fund\u2019s investee companies, ADB\u2019s investment can also \npromote the benefits of private equity as a funding option. \n \n25.  Capital mobilization. ADB\u2019s participation can help mobilize additional capital from private \nand institutional investors in assisting the fund to reach its target size (para. 29), thereby achieving \na multiplier effect on ADB's investment. Additionally, ADB will have the opportunity to co-invest in \nor lend to individual portfolio companies of TCGF II in sectors such as financial services and \nhealth care. \n \n26.  Setting  standards.  ADB  will  help  the  fund  develop  its  institutional  framework  for \nenvironmental and social safeguards, as well as encourage the investment team to sharpen its \ndevelopment  focus,  and  track  and  improve  developmental  indicators  within  its  investee \ncompanies. If this investment is approved, ADB will become the fund\u2019s first development financial \ninstitution investor. \n \n27.  Gender equality. Tata Capital has agreed to adopt specific gender-inclusive actions for \nTCGF II (para. 46), which will be developed with ADB\u2019s assistance. ADB\u2019s participation may also \npromote gender equity in certain TCGF II investee companies.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "6 \nE.  Risks \n \n28.
