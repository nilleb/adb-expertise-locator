The government is rehabilitating the 47-km \nChittagong-Dohazari section with its own funds. The project will also strengthen the capacity of Bangladesh Railway for project \nimplementation management. The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) trade facilitation and transport \nworking group endorsed the project at a meeting held in Tokyo on 26 November 2015.\n\nThe government has requested for an multitranche financing facility (MFF) in an amount up to $1.5 billion from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) and Special Fund resources to help finance the project. An MFF using the time-slicing approach is \nproposed as the modality to finance this large-scale stand-alone project through long-term works, goods and services, and \nconsultant contracts. The project was fully appraised as part of the due diligence for the MFF, and each tranche will finance \nparts of this project. The MFF allows a long-term partnership with the government for policy dialogue and capacity development.\nImpact: Efficient and safe railway transport in Bangladesh and improved subregional connectivity and trade \nOutcome: Railway transport system in the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar corridor improved \nOutputs: (i) New railway line commissioned,  and (ii) Project implementation capacity of Bangladesh Railway strengthened\n\nImplementation Arrangements: Bangladesh Railway will be the executing agency.\n\nProject Readiness: Consultants recruited under the Subregional Transport Project Preparatory Facility  prepared the project's \ndesign, which considered engineering design measures to minimize the need for land acquisition and resettlement. Given that \nBangladesh is a low-lying country and the project area experiences high rainfall, the main climate change-related impact on the \nproject is increased flooding and river flow volumes due to more rainfall. Embankment height, drainage structure design, and \nbridge height were adjusted to account for these impacts.\n\nBangladesh Railway's capacity to operate and maintain assets was strengthened by updating several operations manuals as \npart of the railway reform project. Bangladesh Railway will maintain all assets financed under this loan in such a way that they \nare available for safe railway operation, and will establish a dedicated maintenance unit for the new line.\n\n12.

The project will also strengthen the capacity of Bangladesh Railway \nfor  project  implementation  management.  The  SASEC  trade  facilitation  and  transport  working \ngroup endorsed the project at a meeting held in Tokyo on 26 November 2015.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nBangladesh  has  the  potential  to  become  a  transport  and  transshipment  center  for  the \nsubregion. It borders India and Myanmar and is close to the landlocked countries of Bhutan and \nNepal. Bangladesh is also located at the main corridor of the Trans-Asia Railway network linking \nSouth and Southeast Asia. Nonetheless, railways account for a low market share in subregional \ntransport. Only 11.9% of Bangladesh\u2019s imports from India (876,855 tons) and 1.1% of its exports \nto India (17,832 tons) in 2011 were transported by rail. Only one passenger train operating twice \na week links Dhaka with Kolkata, India. On average, only one freight train per day crosses the \nborder. Major constraints in subregional rail connectivity are the lack of connectivity between the \nrail networks, the differences between the track gauges in the member states, incompatibilities \nin rolling stock, limited line capacity, and the overall condition of the rail network in Bangladesh. \n \n4. \nThe  project  will  connect  Cox\u2019s  Bazar  district  for  the  first  time  to  the  national  and \nsubregional railway network, and support efficient development in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s \nBazar\u2013Myanmar  border  corridor  through  improved,  reliable,  safe,  and  environmentally  friendly \nrailway  connectivity,  contributing  to  the  overall  development  of  the  national  economy.  The \nrailway corridor is part of the Trans-Asia Railway network and will facilitate access for the Cox\u2019s \nBazar  district\u2019s  population  and  products  to  subregional  markets  and  trade.  The  project  will \nimprove  connectivity  toward  Myanmar  by  intermodal  facilities  for  passengers  and  freight \ntransferring  to  road  transport  toward  the  Myanmar  border.  The  project  will  be  constructed  in \ndual-gauge  tracks  to  enable  future  direct  connectivity  toward  western  Bangladesh  and  India, \nwhere railways are constructed mostly in broad gauge, as well as toward northeastern India and \nSoutheast Asia, where railways are mostly constructed in meter gauge. \n \n5. \nCox\u2019s  Bazar  is  being  developed  to  become  a  major  domestic  and  regional  tourist \ndestination.  Tourism  in  Cox\u2019s  Bazar  is  expected  to  grow  by  at  least  5%  annually  and  the \nGovernment  of  Bangladesh  intends  to  develop  the  district  into  a  regional  tourist  hub  and \nseaside  resort,  and  other  areas  of  the  district  and  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  into  eco-tourist \ndestinations.  Developing  tourism  in  Cox\u2019s  Bazar  is  expected  to  contribute  significantly  to  the \ndistrict\u2019s economic growth and create jobs in tourism and supporting industries. But tourists can \n                                                \n1   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  TA  under  the  Subregional  Transport  Project \n\nPreparatory Facility (TA loan 2688-BAN). \n\n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n \n\n\ftravel to the district only by road via the two-lane national highway or on a very limited scale by \nair;  most  tourists  use  the  bus  and  come  from  Bangladesh\u2019s  urban  centers,  such  as  Dhaka \n(located  470  km  north  of  Cox\u2019s  Bazar),  Comilla,  and  Chittagong.  Each  year,  around  1.875 \nmillion  tourists  visit  Cox\u2019s  Bazar  and  stay  in  the district\u2019s more than 200 hotels  and numerous \nguesthouses  and  dormitories.  Annually,  more  than  9  million  bus  trips  are  made  to  the  district \nfrom  Chittagong  alone.  It  is  expected  that  the  railway  will  serve  as  an  alternative  mode  of \ntransport for about 50% of trips currently using buses. Through this modal shift from road to rail, \nthe project will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve road safety. Special tourist \ntrains will be operated between Dhaka and Cox\u2019s Bazar to accommodate the demand. \n \n6. \nIn addition, significant local demand from the district\u2019s population of about 2.2 million is \nexpected from trips related to work, educational, social, medical, and administrative reasons. To \naccommodate this local demand, all train stations will be equipped with multimodal facilities, and \nlocal as well as mail trains will operate on the line. Inbound freight demand is expected mainly \nfrom  supplies  for  the  district  and  its  tourism  industry,  while  outbound  freight  will  carry  goods \nfrom the district, such as salt, fish products, and timber. The project will also facilitate access to \ninvestments by other development partners, such as Japan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s \n(JICA) planned power plant and deep-sea port in Matarbari Island near Cox\u2019s Bazar. \n \n7. \nRoad map. The government\u2019s Vision 2021 lays out development targets that would help \nBangladesh  reach middle-income  status  by  its  50th  anniversary  in  2021.3 To  achieve  this,  the \n7th  Five-Year  Plan,  FY2016\u2013FY2020  (the  seventh  plan)  aims  to  accelerate  economic  growth, \nemployment generation, and poverty reduction; and intends to raise the annual average growth \nrate  to  7.4%.4 The  project  is  part  of the government\u2019s  strategy  to  connect  more districts  of the \ncountry to the railway network. It will further support the objectives to (i) generate employment \nby  developing  Cox\u2019s  Bazar\u2019s  tourism  industry;  (ii)  improve  subregional  connectivity  and  trade; \n(iii) increase the market share of the railway system, especially for long-distance passenger and \nfreight traffic; and (iv) improve the integration of different modes of transport. \n \n8. \nStrategic  context.  The  seventh  plan  includes the  improvement  of  railways  as  energy-\nefficient  multimodal  transport  systems  to  reduce  carbon  emissions.  It  also  refers  to  the \nestablishment  of  proper  regional  rail  connectivity  as  a  major  investment  priority.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  strategy  in  the  seventh  plan  is  to  increase  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s  market  share \nfrom  4% to 15%  in freight transport,  and  from  4%  to 10%  in passenger transport. The  railway \nwill  focus  on  lucrative  market  segments  and  provide  long-distance  passenger  transport  by \nintercity trains as well as long-haul freight transport and container trains. The subsector policies \nfor rail transport are set out in the National Integrated Multimodal Transport Policy, which states \nthat  the  railway  can  help  avoid  the  construction  of  roads  by  attracting  current  and future  road \nusers  through  improvements  in  long-distance  intercity  train  service  quality,  timetabling,  and \ncapacity. 5  The  Railway  Master  Plan  pointed  out  that  the  rail  transport  subsector  must \nsignificantly  improve  its  efficiency,  service  quality,  intermodal  connectivity,  and  network \ncoverage to serve as a viable mode of transport.6  \n \n9. \nPolicy  framework.  To ensure the sustainability of the project, Bangladesh Railway will \npursue ongoing reforms by (i) improving its accounting; (ii) implementing annual adjustments to \nthe passenger and freight tariff; (iii) fully operationalizing the container company to increase the \n\n                                                \n3  Centre for Policy Dialogue. 2007.

The  sector  reform  framework  agreed  between  the  government  and \nADB, JICA and the World Bank formulated a detailed reform program. The Asian Development \nBank \nthe \nimplementation of these key sector policy, organizational, and capacity-building reforms to make \nthe state-owned Bangladesh Railway more commercially focused, and improve governance and \naccountability. 7  It  restructured  Bangladesh  Railway \nlines-of-business  structure; \nestablished  an  accounting  system  based  on  this  structure;  and  introduced  an  information \ntechnology  system  to  support  enterprise  resource  planning  and  improve  asset  management, \nfinancial  management  and  governance,  accounting  systems,  and  human  resource  utilization \nand  governance.  The  full  rollout  of  the  enterprise  resource  planning  system  is  ongoing;  it  is \nexpected  that  FY2017  financial  statements  for  Bangladesh  Railway  can  be  prepared  by  the \nsystem. Reforming the railway industry in addition to investing in increased transport capacity is \none  of  the  priorities  of  the  government  under  the  seventh  plan.  As  a  first  step  in  transforming \nitself into a more commercially focused transport service provider, Bangladesh Railway set up a \ncontainer  company  in  April  2016  to  handle  the  container  business  as  a  government-owned \ncorporate  entity  in  close  coordination  with  private  sector  clients,  especially  from  the  garments \nand logistics industries. A tariff reform was introduced in February 2016, which rationalized the \npassenger and freight tariff and provides for annual tariff adjustments based on cost indicators. \nA detailed description of the railway reform activities is in the railway reform progress report.8 \n \n11. \nInvestment  program.  The  project  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  priorities  in  the \nseventh plan and the Railway Master Plan. It will focus on financing the construction of the 102 \nkm Dohazari\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar section as phase 1 of the planned improvement for the Chittagong\u2013\nCox\u2019s  Bazar  railway  corridor.  The  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  plans  to  finance  the \nreplacement  of  the  road  cum  railway  bridge  over  Karnaphuli  River  in  Chittagong.  The  project \ndesign  includes  provisions  for  future  capacity  enhancement,  and  extensions  of  the  line  to \nGundam at the Myanmar border and to the planned deep-sea port on Matarbari Island. These \nfuture extensions are expected to be financed under phase 2 of the proposed project. The dual-\ngauge conversion of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong section will be financed under a future ADB project. \nThe project will also continue to support the implementation of the railway reform program. \n \n12. \nADB-financed  railway  projects. The Railway Sector Investment Program (Footnote 7) \nfinances  (i)  the  double  tracking  of  the  64  km  Tongi\u2013Bhairab  Bazar  section  of  the  Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong corridor (ii) the extension of loop lines and modernization of signaling in the Ishurdi\u2013\nDarsana section; and (iii) the procurement of 150 passenger carriages. In 2014, ADB approved \nthe SASEC Railway Connectivity: Akhaura\u2013Laksam Double Track Project, which is cofinanced \nby  the  European Investment  Bank.9 It  will  upgrade  the  72  km  Akhaura\u2013Laksam  section  of  the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  to  a  double  track  railway  line  with  modern  signaling  equipment.

In the Bangladesh rail transport subsector, interventions by \nkey  development  partners  are  well-coordinated.  The  sector  reform  framework  agreed  by  the \ngovernment, ADB, JICA and the World Bank is supported by the ADB-financed Railway Sector \nInvestment Program (Footnote 7) and provides a platform for institutional development as basis \nfor  infrastructure  financing  investment  programs.  Infrastructure  investments  are  concentrating \non the two key rail corridors, Dhaka\u2013Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar and Dhaka\u2013Khulna. In addition to \nthe  ADB-financed  projects,  JICA  financed  (i)  double  tracking  of  the  61  km  Laksam\u2013Chinki \nAstana section of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor; (ii) remodeling of the Chittagong station yard; \nand  (iii)  procurement  of  11  diesel  locomotives  The  Export-Import  Bank  of  Korea  prepares \nfinancing (i) the improvement of the signaling system in the Chinki Astana\u2013Chittagong section; \n(ii)  procurement  rolling  stock;  and  (iii)  the  new  Karnaphuli  river  road  cum  railway  bridge  in \nChittagong. The Government of India is supporting (i) construction of the second Bhairab Bridge \nand  the  second  Titas  Bridge  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor;  (ii)  procurement  of  passenger \ncoaches, freight wagons, and locomotives; (iii) construction of the Kulna\u2013Mongla Port Rail Line; \n(iv)  construction  of  the  third  and  fourth  dual-gauge  track  between  Dhaka  and  Tongi;  and  (v) \nrehabilitation of the Kulaura\u2013Shahbazpur section. JICA is supporting design for construction of \nthe new Jamuna railway bridge in the Dhaka\u2013Khulna corridor. \n \n14. \nInvestment plan and MFF modality. The government has requested for an MFF in an \namount  up  to  $1.5  billion  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  Special  Funds \nresources  to  help finance  the  project.  An  MFF  using  the  time-slicing  approach  is  proposed  as \nthe modality to finance this large-scale stand-alone project through long-term works, goods, and \nservices; and consultant contracts. The project was fully appraised as part of the due diligence \nfor  the  MFF,  and  each  tranche  will  finance  parts  of  this  project.  The  MFF  allows  a  long-term \npartnership with the government for policy dialogue and capacity development. Once a tranche \nis disbursed, the government will submit a periodic financing request for a subsequent tranche, \nwhich will continue to finance the contracts awarded under tranche 1. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe impact of the project will be efficient and safe railway transport in Bangladesh and \nimproved  subregional  connectivity  and  trade.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  railway  transport \nsystem in the Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar corridor. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  will  support  (i)  the  construction  of  a  new  railway  line  and  (ii)  the \n16. \nstrengthening of the project implementation capacity of Bangladesh Railway. For the first output, \n102 km of new railway line will be commissioned, with nine stations, integrating design features \nthat  are  friendly  to  elderly  people,  women,  children,  and  people  with  disabilities.  The  second \noutput will involve implementation of a safeguard monitoring system, public communication plan, \nand safety awareness. Tranche 1 will finance part of the construction contract for the project. \n \n\n                                                \n10 ADB.  2015.

Each  tranche  will  finance  parts  of  the  works,  goods,  and \nservices;  and  consulting  services  contracts  using  the  time-slicing  approach  for  large-scale \nstand-alone  projects.  Once  a  tranche  is  disbursed,  the  government  will  submit  a  periodic \nfinancing request for a subsequent tranche, which will continue to finance the contracts awarded \nunder tranche 1. \n \nFor  the  first  tranche  of  the  MFF,  the  government  has  requested  an  OCR  loan  of \n19. \n$210 million  and  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR64.374  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources.13 The OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of \n5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,14 a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft OCR loan agreement.

The  amount  is  within  the \nreasonable  threshold  identified  during  the  country  partnership  strategy  preparation  process,  is  not  excessive \n(7.67%  of  ADB  loan  resources),  applies  only  to  ADB-financed  expenditures,  and  is  material  and  relevant  to  the \nsuccess of the project. \n\n13  The  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  includes  $40  million  from  the  subregional  pool.  The  OCR  loan \n\nincludes $100 million from the regional cooperation and integration set-aside. \n\n14  The  interest  includes  a  maturity  premium  of  10  basis  points.

ADB  will  play  an  active  facilitation  role  in  the  bidding  process  to  ensure \ntimeliness and quality in the process, and will engage its own consultants to help with this work. \nConstruction  supervision  and  project  management  support  will  require  two  consultants,  which \nwill  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended from time to time). All consulting services will be recruited using the 90:10 quality- and \ncost-based selection method, considering the complexity of multidisciplinary railway projects. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nimplementation  by  an \n\nindependent  external  monitor \n\n23. \nCapacity  development  TA  for  project  implementation  management  will  be  provided \nunder  the  first  tranche. 17  The  TA  will  support  Bangladesh  Railway  (i)  in  the  monitoring  of \nsafeguards \nfor  environment  and \nresettlement, (ii) in public stakeholder communication through development of a website, (iii) in \na safety awareness campaign for railway crossings, and (iv)  through procurement support and \nadvisory  services.  The  executing  agency  for  the  TA  will  be  Bangladesh  Railway.  The  TA \nimplementation period will be from January 2017 to December 2024. \n \n24. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation,  support  facilities,  counterpart  staff, \nreports,  and  other  logistical  support  and  in-kind  contributions.  ADB  will  engage  national  and \ninternational consulting firms as well as individual consultants according to its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants, using the 90:10 quality- and cost-based selection method due to the highly \nspecialized knowledge required for the railway sector. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nConsultants  recruited  under  the  Subregional  Transport  Project  Preparatory  Facility 18 \n25. \nprepared the project\u2019s design, which considered engineering design measures to minimize the \nneed for land acquisition and resettlement. Given that Bangladesh is a low-lying country and the \nproject area experiences high rainfall, the main climate change-related impact on the project is \nincreased  flooding  and  river  flow  volumes  due  to  more  rainfall.  Embankment  height,  drainage \nstructure  design,  and  bridge  height  were  adjusted  to  account  for  these  impacts.  Bangladesh \nRailway\u2019s  capacity  to  operate  and  maintain  assets  was  strengthened  by  updating  several \noperations  manuals  as part  of the  railway  reform  project.  Bangladesh Railway  will  maintain all \nassets financed under this loan in such a way that they are available for safe railway operation, \nand will establish a dedicated maintenance unit for the new line. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n26. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  were  undertaken  and  concluded  that  the  project  is \neconomically and financially viable. The project economic internal rate of return is 14.8%. The \neconomic  analysis  compared  the  benefits  and  costs  of  with-project  and  without-project \nsituations.  The  main  benefits  are  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time,  and  a \nreduction in accidents. A sensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible negative changes in \nthe key parameters that determine the project\u2019s costs and benefits. The analysis indicates that \n                                                \n17 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB.  2010.

Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nthe  project\u2019s  economic  viability  would  remain  satisfactory  even  under  adverse  scenarios.  The \nfinancial  assessment  was  undertaken  to  examine  the  viability  of  the  project  investment.  The \nincremental  revenues  being  generated  under  the  project  will  be  adequate  to  fully  finance  the \nproject\u2019s  incremental  recurrent  costs,  and  partially  contribute  to  capital  repayment  and  debt \nservicing.  The  project\u2019s  lending  decision  is  based  more  on  economic  viability  than  financial \nviability.  Overall,  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s  operations  are  supported  by  the  government\u2019s \nbudgetary  commitment;  the  yearly  government  support  is  adequate  to  sustain  operations, \nreflecting the systemic importance of Bangladesh Railway. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nFinancial management. The financial management assessment was updated following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects, 19  Financial  Due \nDiligence: a Methodology Note,20 and related technical guidance notes. The assessment found \nthat  the  capacity  is  adequate  and  the  overall  risk  is  moderate.  Bangladesh  Railway  has  prior \nand  ongoing  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects,  and  understands  ADB\u2019s  procurement, \ndisbursement,  and  financial  management  procedures.  The  capacity  is  further  strengthened \nthrough  the  Bangladesh  Railway  Reform  Project  by  improving  the  financial  accounting  and \nreporting system.21 Details of risks and key mitigating measures are in the FAM (footnote 16). \n \nProcurement  and  anticorruption  measures.  ADB  will  review  procurement-related \n28. \ndocuments at all major milestones before proceeding with the procurement process. Two large \nworks  packages  will  be  procured  and  two  consultants  recruited;  the  works  and  consulting \npackages  will  be  to  complete  the  entire  project,  and  will  be  financed  by  ADB  under  tranche  1 \nand  all  subsequent  tranches.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed  with the government  and Bangladesh  Railway.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nThe procurement rules for the selection of contractors required by international financial \n29. \ninstitutions  such  as  ADB  are  considered  sufficiently  robust  to  deter  corruption.  National \nprocurement  regulation  has  also  improved  through  the  Public  Procurement  Act,  2006  and  the \nrelated Public Procurement Rules, 2008 (with subsequent amendments); and the establishment \nof  a  Central  Procurement  Technical  Unit  under  the  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nDivision  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning  of  the  Government  of  Bangladesh.  In  October  2012,  the \nNational Integrity Strategy (NIS) was approved and a National Integrity Advisory Committee was \nformed with the Prime Minister as the chair to steer the anticorruption movement and implement \nthe  strategy.  The  NIS  includes  a  road  map  for  strengthening  both  state  and  non-state \naccountability  institutions  to  fight  corruption  and  improve  governance.  Under  the  NIS,  all  line \nministries and key watchdog institutions have formed an ethics committee and appointed a focal \npoint  to  implement  a  corruption  prevention  program  and  corresponding  actions  in  their \nrespective ministries or agencies. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe project\u2019s direct area of influence includes six administrative upazilas (subdistricts) in \n30. \nChittagong  and  Cox\u2019s  Bazar  districts. 22 Overall,  poverty  rates  in  the  project  area  are  lower \n\n                                                \n19 ADB. 2005. Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n20 ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. Manila. \n21 The  Bangladesh  Railway  Reform  Project is financed  under  tranche  1 of  the  Railway  Sector  Investment  Program \n\n22 Chandanaish, Lohagara, and Satkania in Chittagong district; and Chakaria, Cox\u2019s Bazar Sadar, and Ramu in Cox\u2019s \n\nBazar district. Estimates are based on the 1991 population census, taking population growth into account. \n\n(footnote 7). \n\n \n\n\f(13%\u201334%) than the national average (31.5%).23 According to the poverty and social analysis, \nthe  main  sources  of  income  are  agriculture,  businesses,  remittances,  day  labor,  and  services. \nTourism is important and growing; Cox\u2019s Bazar\u2019s 120 km of sandy beaches make it one of the \nmost visited destinations in the country. The project will improve accessibility  for the estimated \n2 million residents living in the project\u2019s direct area of influence (who do not have access to the \nrailway system at present) and support the growth of businesses, trade, and services. \n \n31. \nGender. Surveys conducted under the poverty and social analysis revealed that only 5% \nof  women  in  the  project-affected  area  have  used  the  train,  since  no  rail  connection  exists \nbetween  Dohazari  and  Cox\u2019s  Bazar.  Overall,  women  had  a  positive  perception  of  the  project \nand  the  majority  (61%)  said  they  would  feel  comfortable  traveling  alone  on  a  train.  Moreover, \n50%  of  the  women  viewed  the  new  train  line  as  a  way  for  them  to  access  new  income-\ngeneration opportunities. But 44% expressed concerns about their personal safety, particularly \nin relation to theft and harassment, while others were worried about train delays. \n \n32. \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  Although  district  data  on  HIV  prevalence  for \nChittagong and Cox\u2019s Bazar is lacking, health officials have pointed out that tourism and cross-\nborder  population  movements  may  have  increased  the  incidence  of  sexually  transmitted \ndiseases. As for human trafficking, while neither local data nor nationally collected data exist on \nthe  number  of  trafficked  persons  to  and  from  Bangladesh,  discussions  with  community-based \norganizations  during  project  preparation  indicate  the  existence  of  people  smuggling  in  Cox\u2019s \nBazar,  which  is  near  the  Myanmar  border.  Although  the  project  is  not  expected  to  facilitate \ninternational  human  trafficking  given  that  train  services  are  subject  to  greater  control  than  the \ncurrent  routes  used  by  the  traffickers,  it  may  contribute  to  more  rural\u2013urban  migration  flows. \nThese migrants may then be vulnerable to being coerced and exploited by organized traffickers. \n \n33. \nRail  crossing  safety.  Given  that  the  project  consists  of  a  new  line  located  in  a \ncommunity  that  is  not  used  to  train  services,  the  risk  of  train  collisions  with  vehicles  and \npedestrians  is  high\u2014residents  and  drivers  along  the  corridor  may  not  be  aware  of  the  train\u2019s \nbraking limitations (compared with vehicles) and the need to clear the rail tracks in advance. \n \n34. \nGender  action  plan.  The  MFF  and  tranche  1  are  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming.  A  gender  action  plan  was  prepared  for  tranche  1  and  the  MFF  to  ensure \nwomen-friendly design features and mitigate the social risks mentioned above. The action plan \nincludes  the  following  activities:  (i)  integrate  features  that  would  make  the  stations  friendly  to \nelderly  people,  women,  children,  and  people  with  disabilities;  (ii)  promote  rail  crossing  safety \nawareness campaigns to communities along the corridor, targeting pedestrians, drivers, parents, \nschoolchildren,  and  professional  drivers;  (iii)  include  personal  safety  and/or  anti-sexual \nharassment  protocol  in  station  and  capacity  building;  (iv)  run  a  public,  preventive  awareness-\nraising  campaign  on  sexually  transmitted  disease  and  human  trafficking;  (v)  take  proactive \nmeasures  to  support  the  rehabilitation  of  affected  women;  (vi)  launch  a  website  and \ncommunication platform about the project, its impact, and its implementation progress. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n35. \nEnvironmental  impact.  The  project  as  a  whole  was  assessed  as  category  A  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  project  scope  includes  the \nconstruction  of  a  greenfield  rail  line  passing  through  elephant  crossings  and  three  protected \nareas  (Chunati  Wildlife  Sanctuary,  Faisakhali  Wildlife  Sanctuary,  and  Methakatchpia  National \n\n                                                \n23 Government  of  Bangladesh,  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics.  2011.  Report  of  the  Household  Income  & \n\nExpenditure Survey 2010. Dhaka. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nPark).  Accordingly, tranche  1  and  all  subsequent tranches  will  be  classified  as  category  A.  An \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  was  prepared  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  26 May \n2016. An environmental assessment and review framework was also prepared for the MFF as a \nwhole and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Key impacts during project construction will include the \nremoval  of  about  240,000 trees,  earthworks,  and  hill  cutting works that  pose  dust  and  erosion \nrisks, occupational health and safety risks, disturbance to elephants, and further disturbances to \nthe three protected areas. Creating a barrier to elephant crossing routes and generating noise \nfrom  the  new  rail  line  are  key  long-term  risks.  A  comprehensive  environmental  management \nplan (EMP) was prepared to mitigate all identified impacts. It will be mandatory for the contractor \nto implement the EMP requirements during construction. Innovative measures such as elephant \noverpasses, use of thermal imaging cameras, and habitat enhancement have been proposed to \navoid rail\u2013elephant collisions and enable continued movement of elephants in the project area. \nExtensive  consultations  were  held  with  over  350  people  during  project  preparation,  including \npeople  affected  by  the  project,  relevant  government  agencies,24 local  women\u2019s  groups,  and \nnongovernment  organizations.  Their  concerns  were  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  The \nproject will continue to address concerns and grievances of affected people through a grievance \nredress mechanism proposed under the project. \n \n36. \nA project implementation unit in Chittagong will manage on-site project implementation, \nwith  support  from  the  project  management  and  construction  supervision  consultants;  all  will \nhave  environment  safeguard  officers.  The  contractor  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the \nEMP. An independent monitor to be recruited under the TA will conduct third-party monitoring of \nenvironmental safeguards and provide technical guidance on the elephant crossing design. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  as  a  whole  was  assessed  as  category  A; \n37. \naccordingly, tranche 1 and all subsequent tranches will be classified as category A as per ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  A  detailed  survey  of  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  was \nconducted,  which  identified  the  acquisition  of  562.83  hectares  of  land  and  impacts  on \n1,984 households (9,946 persons), the majority of whom (80%) will have to physically relocate. \nMost  affected  households  (65%)  are  titleholders.  About  80%  of  physically  affected  titled \nhouseholds will lose less than 30% of their land and will be able to relocate their homestead to \ntheir residual plot. The project is also expected to affect 44 community structures.  \n \n38. \nThe resettlement plan was designed using a participatory approach, which led to several \nrealignments and design changes. Its measures adequately deal with the identified impacts and \nreflect lessons learned from other projects being implemented in Bangladesh. The resettlement \nplan  includes  compensations  at  replacement  cost,  income  restoration  measures,  shifting  and \nreconstruction  assistance,  special  provisions  for  vulnerable  households,  and  assistance  in \nidentifying  alternative  plots  of  land  to  buy  or  rent.  In  addition,  it  includes  a  livelihood \nimprovement  program  with  special  measures  to  encourage  women\u2019s  participation.  The \nresettlement plan will be financed entirely by the government, and its budget has been approved. \nIt will be implemented by Bangladesh Railway, with support from a nongovernment organization. \nBangladesh  Railway \ninvoluntary  resettlement \nfamiliar  and  experienced  with  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements,  as  it  is  conducting  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  for  two  ADB-\nfinanced  investments  (footnote  7  and  footnote  9).  Measures  to  develop  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s \ncapacity  will  be  included  as  part  of  project  inception.  The  resettlement  plan  is  disclosed  on \nADB\u2019s website25 and will be disclosed by Bangladesh Railway locally as well.

The  MFF  and  tranche  1  are  classified  as  category  C  as  per  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The alignment does not affect tribal lands, and the survey confirms \nthat no indigenous person is affected. Given that the project will be  financed through an MFF, \nan indigenous peoples planning framework was prepared and disclosed.27 \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n40. \nKey  project  risks  are  (i)  project  implementation  delays,  (ii)  inadequate  safeguard \ncompliance, and (iii) uncertain financial sustainability. These risks and mitigating measures are \ndiscussed  in  the  Risk  Assessment  and  Risk  Management  Plan.28 The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe government and Bangladesh Railway have assured ADB that implementation of the \n41. \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n42. \nThe government and Bangladesh Railway have given ADB certain undertakings for the \nMFF,  which are set forth in the framework financing agreement.
