THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Henan  Hebi  Qihe  River  Environmental \nImprovement and Ecological Conservation Project.1 \n \n2.  The Qihe River basin in Hebi city has been selected as one of the PRC\u2019s pilot locations \nfor \u201cwater ecological civilization.\u201d2 To help the Hebi city government (HCG) achieve this aim, the \nproject will demonstrate an integrated and holistic approach to ecosystem and water resources \nmanagement by (i) restoring degraded ecosystems, (ii) improving flood management capacity, \n(iii) enhancing wastewater and solid-waste management, and (iv) strengthening the overarching \ntechnical and institutional monitoring framework for the Qihe River system. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Rapid economic development in the PRC has led to severe degradation of ecosystems \nand  the  decline  of  their  fundamental  services  to  human  well-being.3 Deforestation  and \novergrazing in the watersheds, combined with point and nonpoint source pollution, have led to \nincreased runoff, higher peak flows, downstream flooding, and poor water quality in many \nregions. This has resulted in loss of life and property and has required costly investments in \nlarge-scale water management infrastructure and reinforcement of river embankments. \n \n4.  Located  in  northern  Henan  province,  Hebi city  has a  population  of  1.6 million  and \nencompasses 83 kilometers (km), or 52%, of the Qihe River. Originating from Shanxi province, \nthe Qihe River flows into the Weihe River and then the Hai River and finally into the Bohai Sea. \nEcosystem  degradation,  poor  flood  management  capacity,  pollution,  and  weak  intersector \ncoordination are the key issues affecting the ecological integrity of the Qihe River basin that this \nproject will address in an integrated manner. \n \n5.  Environmental  degradation  in  the  upper  Qihe  River  watershed.  Environmental \nconditions along the Qihe River have deteriorated because of intensive economic development \nand increasing human populations, while vegetation, wetlands, and water quality along the river \nhave declined because of urbanization, modification of the river hydrology, habitat loss and \ndeforestation,  livestock  grazing,  agriculture,  overextraction  of  water,  and  nonpoint  source \npollution. The 1,300 hectares of degraded hills within the scope of this project in the upper Qihe \nare almost completely devoid of vegetation. The pilot Qihe River National Wetland Park (NWP) in \nthe river\u2019s upper reaches requires habitat restoration and improved facilities and management.4 \n \n6.  Poor flood management capacity. In the lower Qihe River, current flood management \npractices have resulted in waterlogging and flooding in selected rural areas as a result of \ndiversion of water for emergency storage of flows that exceed the dike crest levels. In addition, \nbecause the old embankments and dikes are in poor condition because of erosion and washout, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The PRC conceptualizes ecological civilization as a development approach that aims to balance the relationship \nbetween humanity and nature. In order to achieve ecological civilization, the PRC has selected candidate locations \nfor \u201cwater ecological civilization\u201d to establish good practices in ecological and water resources management. \n3  Ecosystem services are the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well-being. They support \ndirectly or indirectly our survival and quality of life. http://biodiversity.europa.eu/topics/ecosystem-services \n4  \"Pilot\" refers to the State Forestry Administration\u2019s practice for national wetland parks prior to official designation. \n ", "2 \nthe  vulnerability  of  these  sections  to  potential dike failure,  catastrophic flooding,  and  crop \ndamage is high. The flood management capacity of selected tributaries and canals of the Qihe \nRiver in Qi county and Qibin district is also limited to a less than 1-in-5 year flood because of \nheavy siltation, congestion with solid waste, and degraded banks. \n \n7.  Wastewater  and  solid-waste  pollution. The Qihe  River  and  its  canals  are  highly \npolluted. The surface water quality of the river\u2019s mainstream exceeds the class III environmental \nquality standard for surface water, while that of the canals exceeds class V.5 The city sewage \nnetwork  currently  covers  60%  of  Qibin  district  and  Qi  county,  while  the  three  wastewater \ntreatment  plants  (WWTPs)  that  serve  the  same  project  areas  cannot  accommodate  the \nincreasing volumes of wastewater. As a result, untreated wastewater discharges directly to the \nlower Qihe River mainstream and tributaries. The lack of waste transfer stations has also \nresulted in poor solid-waste management. \n \n8.  Poor  institutional  and  technical  monitoring  capacity  for  river  basin  and  water \nresource management. While the management of the Qihe River involves numerous agencies, \nintegrated water resources management (IWRM) only has limited intersector coordination because \nof  a  lack  of  mechanisms  for  information  sharing  and  monitoring  capacity.  The  established \nmultisector city-level project management office (PMO) is the first step toward stronger intersector \ncoordination.  Continued  capacity  building  will  be  essential  to  supporting  IWRM,  including \ndeveloping a management information system (MIS) and ecological monitoring program, to guide \ninteragency decision-making on flood management, conservation, and other issues. \n \n9.  To address these issues, the HCG has prepared various plans, including the Master Plan \nfor Hebi City Qihe River Ecological Areas for 2010\u20132020 and the Hebi City Urban Flood and \nWaterlogging Control Plan for 2011\u20132020.6 The HCG requested that the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) (i) provide lending support to implement environmental improvement and ecological \nconservation in and around the Qihe River by integrating key activities in the above-mentioned \nplans in a consistent manner using innovative yet cost-effective approaches; and (ii) support the \ncity\u2019s efforts to implement this pilot initiative on ecological civilization, which will serve as a \ndemonstration project for other cities or provinces.7 The project will demonstrate an integrated \nand holistic approach to ecosystem and water resources management in one of the most flood-\nprone  and  ecologically  sensitive  sections  of  a  river  system  by  combining  structural  and \nnonstructural measures to the differing conditions of the river sections.  \n \n10.  Strategic fit. The project contributes to the PRC\u2019s goal of building a harmonious and \nprosperous society through environmentally sustainable growth and the priorities of its Thirteenth \nFive-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020. The decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central \nCommittee of the Communist Party of the PRC supports the establishment of a system to protect \necosystems.8 The  project  also  supports  ADB  priorities  as  stated  in  the  Midterm  Review  of \nStrategy  2020;9 Environment  Operational  Directions,  2013\u20132020;10 Water  Operational  Plan, \n                                                \n5  Following the GB 3838-2002 environmental quality standard for surface water of the PRC, class III means the \nwater is suitable for drinking and swimming, class IV for general industrial and recreational use, and class V for \nagriculture and landscaping. Class V+ means the water is unsuitable for any purpose. \n6  These plans set targets for 2020, including an improvement in the flood management capacity of the lower reaches \nof the Qihe River and its tributaries to just a 1-in-20 year flood. \n7  The project is included in the 2016 lending pipeline in ADB. 2016.

Lessons.  The project design has incorporated lessons from  previous ADB-financed \nprojects and policy-oriented studies on IWRM, environmental and ecosystem improvement, \nwetland and lake management and restoration, and urban\u2013rural integration in the PRC. Major \nlessons incorporated into the project design include the need for (i) an integrated approach, \nincluding  structural  and  nonstructural  measures;  (ii)  strong  leadership  and  governance  in \nenvironmental management; (iii) adequate consultation and better communication with affected \npeople;  (iv)  project  activities  that  encourage  community  participation;  (v)  sustainable \nmanagement of facilities based on a realistic tariff structure; and (vi) management and data \ninformation systems for IWRM decision-making. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the project will be to restore ecosystem services in the Qihe River basin. \nThe outcome of the project will be to demonstrate integrated environmental management in the \nQihe River basin in Hebi city. The project will improve water security and flood management and \nenhance the delivery of ecological services. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The project will have four outputs: (i) restored vegetation and wetlands in the upper Qihe \nRiver basin, (ii) improved flood management capacity of the lower Qihe River, (iii) enhanced \nwastewater and solid-waste management in the Qihe River basin, and (iv) strengthened technical \nand institutional support system and capacity for integrated management of the Qihe River basin. \n \n14.  Output 1 will include two subcomponents: (i) ecological restoration of the Qihe River \nupstream watershed, and (ii) restoration of the pilot Qihe River NWP. Under subcomponent 1, \napproximately 1,300 hectares of degraded hills in the upper Qihe will be reforested to reduce \nsoil erosion. Under subcomponent 2, activities in the NWP will include (i) restoring wetland \nhabitats and riverbanks, (ii) providing fencing and signage to protect targeted species, (iii) \nimproving park infrastructure, (iv) establishing a park management agency and management \nplan, (v) establishing a park monitoring program, and (vi) encouraging community participation \nin park monitoring. \n \n15.  Output 2 will include three subcomponents: (i) improvement of the Qihe River mainstream \nwatercourse in Qi county; (ii) rehabilitation of tributaries in Qi county (Side River, Zhaojia Canal, \nHucheng River, and Zhejing River; approximately 30 km in total); and (iii) restoration of five canals \nin Qibin district (about 11.3 km in total) and revegetation of about 11.5 km riverside in Qi county. \n \n16.  Output 3  will  support  improved  wastewater and  solid-waste management. The main \nsubcomponents  are  (i)  Qibin  district  wastewater  management,  (ii)  Qi  county  wastewater \nmanagement, and (iii) solid-waste management in both Qi county and Qibin district. \n \n17.  Output 4 will support (i) the establishment of a Qihe River ecological monitoring program; \n(ii) the development of a Qihe River MIS; and (iii) training and capacity building on ecological \n                                                                                                                                                       \n10 ADB. 2013.

Innovation and special features. The project demonstrates an integrated and holistic \napproach to ecosystem and water resources management in one of the most flood-prone and \necologically sensitive sections of a river system. The integrated approach combines structural \nand nonstructural measures to the differing conditions of the river sections, and include (i) \nwetland protection and soil erosion reduction, (ii) reduction of pollution loads from sewage and \nsolid waste, (iii) flood management, (iv) capacity building of community \u201criver guards,\u201d14 (v) \nestablishment of community environmental monitors, and (vi) development of the MIS. The \nleadership by the HCG and the establishment of an intersector PMO is also a unique feature of \nthis  project.  As  Hebi  city  has  been  selected  as  a  national  pilot  city  for  water  ecological \ncivilization, and pilot NWP, this project offers a unique opportunity to demonstrate a successful \nIWRM model and future replication. \n \nD.

The amount of taxes and duties to be financed by \nADB is based on the principles that (i) the amount will be within the reasonable threshold identified during the \ncountry partnership strategy preparation process, (ii) the amount of taxes and duties financed by the ADB loan \ndoes not represent an excessive share of the project, (iii) the taxes and duties apply only to ADB-financed \nexpenditures, and (iv) the financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \nb As of 2 August 2015. \nc  Physical contingencies computed at 10% of base costs. Price contingencies were computed using the escalation \nfactors published by ADB on local and foreign components of the project costs, and include provision for potential \nexchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \nd Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for the ADB loan has been computed at the \n5-year US dollar fixed-swap rate plus a spread of 0.5% and a maturity premium of 0.1%. Commitment charges for \nthe ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \nSource: Hebi city government and ADB estimates. \n \n20.  The government  has requested  a  loan  of $150  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including (i) a grace \n                                                \n13 For  wastewater  management,  the government has  agreed  to continue  to pursue  tariff  reform.  The  project \nimplementation consultants will support the HCG to undertake annual tariff reviews for wastewater tariff and assess \nthe impact and/or affordability of the tariff increase on the poor. \n14 River guards refer to a number of community representatives appointed by the HCG to monitor and report illegal \nactivities or issues affecting the Qihe River. They currently receive little or no training on river health monitoring. \n ", "5 \nperiod of 5 years, (ii) a straight-line repayment method, (iii) an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, (iv) a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount, and (v) \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreements. The average loan maturity is \n15.25 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. Finance charges \nduring implementation will be capitalized. \n \n21.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The ADB loan will finance 46.1% of the project cost, \nincluding civil works, goods, and consulting services. The local governments of Hebi city, Qibin \ndistrict, and Qi and Xun counties will finance the remaining 53.9% of the project cost. The \ngovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  based  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n22.  The Government of the PRC is the borrower of the loan and will make the loan available, \nthrough the Henan provincial government and the HCG, to the responsible county and district \ngovernments on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. Municipal, county, \nand district governments will assume the foreign exchange and interest variation risks of the \nADB loan, including contingencies. The HCG has assured ADB that counterpart funding will be \nprovided in a timely manner, including any counterpart funding required for any shortfall of funds \nor cost overruns. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (loan)  150.0  46.1 \nQibin district  79.0  24.3 \nQi county  90.7  27.9 \nXun county  5.0  1.5 \nHebi municipal (city) government  0.7  0.2 \nTotal  325.4  100.0 \nSource: Hebi city government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.

The HCG\u2019s \ndomestic feasibility study reports are technically sound and provide sufficient information on the \ndesign feasibility. International and national consulting services will provide the necessary technical \nsupport to ensure that international best practices are integrated into the final detailed design, and \nare applied during construction and implementation. Solid-waste management and nonstructural \nproject components have strengthened the integrated approach of the project. Negative impacts \nhave been avoided by (i) the removal of some activities, particularly the construction of two \nmainstream barrages, a captive garden for wild cranes, a wildlife rescue center, a \u201creed maze,\u201d fish \nreleases, and fish and bird nests in the pilot NWP; and (ii) the use of invasive plant species for \n ", "7 \nrevegetation. During the preparation phase, the environmental assessments were strengthened by \nthe inclusion of heavy metal sampling (to help identify spoil disposal locations). \n \n26.  Climate change. ADB\u2019s preliminary climate risk screening indicated the project was at \nhigh risk of being impacted by climate change. A climate risk vulnerability assessment was \nconducted to identify the threat that climate change presents to project viability, assuming a \ndesign  life  of  40\u201350  years.  Modeling  indicates  that  during  2020\u20132070,  mean  annual \ntemperatures  will  rise,  the  risk  of  extreme  climate  events  will  increase,  and  variability  in \nprecipitation will increase, causing more rainy or dry days. This could cause flood damage to the \nproject embankments, channels, and pipelines; excessive sediment deposition in the lower Qihe \nRiver and canals, which would necessitate more channel maintenance; and higher mortality or \ndisease of the planted vegetation because of altered temperatures or water availability. To \naccommodate  these  risks,  project  structures  have  been  designed  to  PRC  flood  protection \nstandards and will be regularly maintained, embankments with a porous design have been \nselected, a flood warning system will be implemented, plant species for revegetation have been \nselected for suitability to the seasonally harsh climate and local soil conditions, and training on \nIWRM  and  wetland  management  will  be  given.  As  a  result,  flood  control  capacity  will  be \nimproved from a 1-in-3 to a 1-in-5 year recurrence interval for the project canals and the 1-in-20 \nyear capacity for the Qihe River mainstream will be secured. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  The economic internal rate of return was estimated by comparing with- and without-\nproject scenarios. The project\u2019s economic costs reflect (i) the capital cost for construction, \nincluding physical contingencies, land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental monitoring \ncosts; and (ii) operation and maintenance costs, which include routine annual maintenance and \nperiodic major maintenance. Least-cost analysis shows that the chosen interventions are both \nengineering preferred and cost-effective. The economic benefits for the project are derived from \nbeneficiaries\u2019 willingness to pay to improve the water quality of the Qihe River and to avoid flood \ndamage. The economic internal rate of return for the overall project is estimated at 13.3% and \nthe net present value is CNY165.3 million, indicating economic viability of the project. \n \n28.  A financial evaluation was conducted on the solid-waste and wastewater subprojects to \nassess viability as both offer some degree of cost recovery. The analysis indicated that the \nsolid-waste  fee  is  not  designed  to  recover  operating  costs,  while  the  wastewater  tariff  is \nintended to recover only the treatment costs. Thus, the project does not receive incremental \nbenefits sufficient to recover all project costs and is deemed not viable from this perspective. \nADB\u2019s decision to invest in the project is based on the economic benefits and the government\u2019s \ncommitment to maintain sound fiscal capacity to absorb project costs. \n \n29.  A financial analysis was conducted to evaluate the capacity of local governments to \nabsorb incremental project costs and to ascertain sustainability based on historical performance. \nThe analysis showed that Qi county and Qibin district may experience undue fiscal pressure \nfrom counterpart funds contribution. The local governments have historically had annual budget \nsurpluses, which can be assumed as unappropriated for capital works or debt servicing and \nmay be used to finance project costs.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  A financial management assessment confirmed that the existing structure, capacity, and \narrangements of the PMOs and the PIUs are generally appropriate. However, unfamiliarity with \n ", "8 \nADB\u2019s financial management requirements, including disbursements, and possible insufficiency \nof counterpart funds are risk areas. The financial management risk rating is medium. An action \nplan has been agreed with the PMOs to mitigate these risks. \n \n31.  The city PMO will conduct all procurement and consultant recruitments under the project \non behalf of the PIUs (the PIUs will just sign the contracts). A procurement capacity assessment \nconfirmed that the city PMO, acting through a procurement agency and with the assistance of \nADB and project management support consultants, will have adequate procurement capacity to \nfacilitate full compliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Specific \npolicy requirements, capacity development, and other supplementary measures are described \nin the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the HCG, including city PMO and implementing agencies and PIUs. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n33.  The project area covers three counties and/or districts, 16 towns and/or townships, and \nover 136 communities and/or villages. About 435,000 people will benefit from the project, of \nwhich an estimated 5% are poor. This project offers good opportunities for local communities to \nparticipate  in  awareness  campaigns,  environmental  improvements,  wetland  protection,  and \nsolid-waste management. The measures are included in the project design to address potential \nnegative impacts and to enhance benefits for local people, including the poor. These measures \nare summarized in the social development action plan. \n \n34.  Women can play a lead role in many activities, such as greening barren hills, wetland \nrehabilitation  and  protection,  and  solid-waste  management.  The  project  is  categorized  as \neffective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan has been prepared. The gender action \nplan  outlines  specific  activities,  target  indicators,  responsible  agencies,  and  monitoring \nmechanisms by output to ensure that women will benefit from the project. The key gender \nactions  include  (i)  involving  women  in  public  awareness  campaigns,  consultation,  and \nparticipation;  (ii)  employing  local  women  during  project  construction  and  operations;  (iii) \npromoting gender awareness for project staff; and (iv) collecting gender-disaggregated data. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.  Environment. The project has been reclassified from category A to category B for \nenvironment  since  no  irreversible,  diverse,  or  unprecedented  impacts  were  identified  or \nanticipated. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) report, including an environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP),  follows  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  EIA  is \nconsistent with the seven domestic EIAs approved by the Hebi Environment Protection Bureau. \nConsultations  involved  key  stakeholders,  including  affected  people  and  local  government \nagencies, and the outcomes are integrated in the project design. The draft EIA was publicly \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 18 August 2015. The HCG, through the PMO, with support from \nthe loan implementation environment consultant, will be responsible for implementation and \nEMP compliance, including inspection, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions or \nmeasures.  The  PMO  will  implement  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  and  have  final \nresponsibility for handling any disputes. The PMO has no prior experience with ADB projects \n ", "9 \nand  limited  capacity  for  wetland  management.  Capacity  building  and  on-site  support  by \nenvironmental, wetland, and monitoring specialists were included as part of the project design. \n \n36.  The  project  is  expected  to  achieve  environmental  benefits,  including  improved \nmanagement of a protected wetland, reduced soil erosion and discharge of untreated wastewater, \nimproved  flood  management  capacity  and  solid-waste  management,  and  adoption  of  an \nintegrated approach to water resources management. Anticipated construction impacts are from \nthe project dredging of canals (elevated turbidity, odor from dredged sediment); temporary noise \nto water birds and low visibility for fish in the pilot NWP from project works; and construction-\nrelated air, dust, vibration, soil erosion, and occupational and community health and safety issues. \nOperational  risks  include  odor  emissions  from  the  WWTPs,  release  of  treated  effluent  into \nwaterways, and inadequate operation and maintenance of project facilities. Mitigation measures \nare described in the EMP. These include setting appropriate boundaries between WWTP facilities \nand communities, monitoring water quality, clarifying roles and responsibilities and operating \nbudgets, building capacity, and establishing the first management plan for the protected wetland. \nThe EIA concludes that effective EMP implementation, together with the prescribed training, will \nresult in residual impacts within the limits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. \n \n37.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement. Six of the seven physical project components will cause some land acquisition and \nresettlement (LAR) impacts. The project will require 4,433.10 mu of land to be permanently \noccupied as follows: acquiring 1,174.23 mu of collectively owned land, leasing 1,959.28 mu of \ncollectively owned16 land, and occupying 1,299.59 mu of state-owned land. The project will \ntemporarily occupy 1,557.68 mu of land, comprising 728 mu of collectively owned land and 830 \nmu of state-owned land. In addition, 5,295 square meters of rural houses need to be demolished, \nwhich will require eight households and two small businesses to be relocated. The project will \npermanently affect 739 households with 3,481 people and temporarily affect 515 households with \n2,253 people. The land loss is not significant for most households because losses are scattered \nacross 70  villages  in 16 towns or townships.  Only 65 households  with  283 people  will  be \nsignificantly affected. The project\u2019s resettlement impacts have been adequately assessed. \n \n38.  Six resettlement plans have been prepared. The plans are based on the feasibility \nstudies,  national  and  local  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Extensive \nconsultation was conducted with the affected villages and an engineering design institute to \navoid or minimize LAR impacts. The proposed compensation and rehabilitation policies are \nadequate to restore incomes and compensate lost assets at replacement cost. The affected \nvillages are supportive of the project as it will improve their living environment and generate \nemployment  opportunities.  The  implementing  agencies  have  made  good  arrangements  for \nresettlement planning, including allocating responsibilities and appointing staff to implement \nLAR. They have the capacity and experience to implement LAR and manage impacts. The \nproject will provide staff training to further strengthen the local capacity. The local governments \nhave endorsed the resettlement plans, which they have committed to implement. The grievance \nredress mechanism will be used and monitored by the PMO. The PMO will engage an external \nmonitoring and evaluation agency to monitor LAR progress and submit semiannual monitoring \nreports. The estimated resettlement budget, including contingencies, is CNY120 million. \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified category C for indigenous peoples. There \nare no differential impacts to any ethnic groups. The project does not impact any distinct and \n                                                \n16 The noncivil works of the wetland park will lease collectively owned land through a land transferring system. \n ", "10 \nvulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nThere are no culturally related issues. \n \nF.

ASSURANCES \n \n41.  The HCG and the local governments have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject will conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 15) and loan and project agreements. The government \nhas agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and \nproject agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$150,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Henan Hebi Qihe River Environmental \nImprovement and Ecological Conservation Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n6 June 2016 \n                                                \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n \nEcosystem services in the Qihe River basin restored (Master Plan for Hebi City Qihe River Ecological Conservation \nfor 2010\u20132020 and Hebi City Urban Flood and Waterlogging Control Plan for 2011\u20132020)a  \n  Performance Indicators with Targets  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2022:     \nIntegrated  a.
