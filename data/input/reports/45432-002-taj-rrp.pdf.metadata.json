I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant,  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  for \nInternational  Development  (OFID),  both  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Central  Asia \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Corridor  6  (Ayni\u2013Uzbekistan  Border  Road) \nImprovement Project.1  \n \n2.  The project is located in the isolated and remote Zarafshan Valley in northern Tajikistan. \nTo support regional cooperation and inclusive growth in the region, the project will finance the \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of a road of approximately 113 kilometers (km) between Ayni\u2013\nPanjakent and the border with Uzbekistan, the improvement of road safety, the upgrading of \nSarazm border post infrastructure, and community development, including improving feeder \nroads and public facilities and training local communities.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Tajikistan\u2019s geographic isolation and mountainous territory (comprising over 90% of the \ncountry)  results  in  high  transport  and  logistics  costs,  which  makes  it  uncompetitive  in \ninternational  and  regional  markets.  The  country\u2019s  remoteness  from  seaports,  and  limited \ntransport infrastructure and facilities constrain development. Large parts of the country are \nsparsely populated. Connectivity is a key development issue: the railway network is fragmented \nbecause of construction difficulties resulting from the mountainous topography, while roads \n(which  are  the  dominant  transport  mode)  are  deteriorating  rapidly  due  to  inadequate \nmaintenance, ineffective traffic loading control, and harsh terrain and climate.  \n  \n4.  The Zarafshan Valley is an isolated and remote region, which is prone to extreme \nnatural events.3 The project road provides the only access to rest of the country and beyond. \nOverland travel to this high elevation valley is often restricted, particularly during winter, due to \npoor  road  conditions,  avalanches,  and  mudflows.  Consequently,  the  more  than  300,000 \ninhabitants  living  in  the  region  have  limited  access  to  markets,  educational  and  medical \nservices, while the region's capacity to develop diverse industries\u2014including agriculture, mining \nand tourism4\u2014is severely constrained.  \n \n5.  The project road\u2014part of the historic Silk Road\u2014runs east\u2013west following the Zarafshan \nRiver through the valley, crossing the Ayni and Panjakent districts before ending at the border \nwith Uzbekistan in the west. The connecting road in Uzbekistan (national road A377) links with \nSamarkand (about 40 km from the border) via the CAREC Corridor 6 in Uzbekistan. Through \nthe north\u2013south transport artery\u2014the CAREC Corridor 6 in Tajikistan\u2014the project road goes  \n(i) northeast to Khudjand (the provincial center), and onward to Uzbekistan; and (ii) south to \nDushanbe, onward to Afghanistan and east\u2013west bound to the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan \n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Roads Improvement Project. Manila. \n3 The valley is located in northern Tajikistan, comprising the districts of Ayni, Kuhistoni Mastchoh, and Panjakent and \nbelonging to the Sughd province. The valley has one of the highest migration rates in Central Asia and is one of the \npoorest regions, with per capita gross domestic product about 60% of the national average in 2010. \n4 Aside from abundant agricultural products, Zarafshan Valley is one of the country's main tourist attractions, featuring \nan ancient history with the country\u2019s only United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World \nHeritage site, and stunning natural scenes for hiking, mountaineering and homestays in the valley and the \nsurrounding mountains. The valley is also rich in natural resources including gold, coal, phosphate, and antimony.    ", "2 \nrespectively through the CAREC Corridor 3 in Tajikistan. The project road is a vital link in the \nnational network, and is regionally strategic as it provides a trade corridor with Uzbekistan in the \nlong term,5 particularly for northern Tajikistan. Accordingly, it has been classified as part of the \nCAREC  Corridor  6  and  included  in  the  list  of  CAREC  medium-term  (2011\u20132015)  priority \nprojects.6 Improvements to this road will increase regional connectivity, reduce transport costs, \nand strengthen competitiveness. This will also improve access to markets and social services \nfor impoverished local communities; stimulate development of agriculture, tourism and mining \nindustries that in return create job opportunities and improve the region\u2019s living standards.   \n  \n6.  Progress has been made on policy and institutional reforms in Tajikistan\u2019s transport \nsector,7 including  (i)  developing  the  Transport  Sector  Master  Plan;8 (ii)  outsourcing  the \nperformance-based maintenance contracts to the private sector; (iii) restructuring the Ministry of \nTransport  (MOT);  and  (iv)  refining  the  budget  process  by  including  provisions  for  capital \ninvestment, operation, and maintenance. Substantial gaps remain, however. The core problem \nis the constrained road transport connectivity, attributable to deteriorating infrastructure and \ndeficient asset management. This has hampered economic and social development by limiting \naccess to markets and social services, and increasing transport costs. Under the project, the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  the  connectivity  improvement  and  also  help \nimprove road safety, road maintenance, and vehicle overloading control. \n \n7.  The government, in its poverty reduction strategy for 2010\u20132012,9 notes the importance \nof infrastructure development in promoting economic development, creating favorable conditions \nfor poverty reduction and achieving the main goals of the National Development Strategy up to \n2015.10 One of the government\u2019s main objectives is to unblock bottlenecks of the country\u2019s \ntransport network by improving roads and railways. The project is included in the government\u2019s \n2012\u20132014 public investment program,11 fits with two core operational areas (infrastructure and \n                                                 \n5  Facilitated by relaxed customs and visa requirements, the project road was for years predominantly used for \ntourists, local trade and mining operations activities higher up the valley in Tajikistan, with cross-border traffic of \nabout 1,000 vehicles per day. The border crossing point was closed by Uzbekistan in November 2010 due to \ndeteriorating bilateral relations. Tajikistan is making efforts\u2014including construction of a dedicated market place for \nbilateral trading, planned upgrade of the border infrastructure, and continuation of dialogue with Uzbekistan\u2014for \nthe border reopening in the near future. \n6  Endorsed at the 10th Ministerial Conference on CAREC in Baku, Azerbaijan in November 2011 and confirmed at \nthe 11th CAREC Transport Sector Coordinating Committee Meeting in Manila, Philippines in May 2012, these \nrepresent the operational priority projects of CAREC for the next 5 years, and form an integral part of medium-term \npriority projects for the 10-year CAREC strategic framework (CAREC 2020). \n7  ADB implemented a series of technical assistance and road projects to support institutional and policy reforms in \nthe transport sector, including (i) ADB. 2000.

ADB assistance in Tajikistan\u2019s transport sector has been successful. The government \nand development partners recognize transport as one of ADB\u2019s main areas of expertise.14 The \nproject design incorporates the key lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in the transport sector in \nTajikistan and other Central Asian countries, including (i) obtaining government assurances \nregarding adequate maintenance funding of the project road, and increases in financing of road \nmaintenance;  (ii)  using  advance  contracting  to  avoid  initial  implementation  delays;  \n(iii)  strengthening  the  executing  agency\u2019s  capacity,  and  (iv)  expanding  the  project\u2019s  social \ndevelopment benefits. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the project will be enhanced regional cooperation and inclusive economic \ngrowth  in  Tajikistan,  particularly  in  the  Sughd  province.  The  outcome  will  be  improved \nconnectivity and mobility along the CAREC Corridor 6 (Ayni\u2013Uzbekistan Border Road). \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  The outputs will comprise (i) approximately 113 km of rehabilitated and reconstructed \nroad between Ayni\u2013Panjakent and the border with Uzbekistan, (ii) improved road safety, and  \n(iii) upgraded Sarazm border post infrastructure and improved local communities.  \n \n11.  Road rehabilitation and reconstruction. The project will improve a 47-km category IV \nmountainous road section (from Ayni roundabout to km 47) and a 66-km category III plain \nsection with minor rolling (from km 47 to the border with Uzbekistan).15 Road improvement work \nwill use the existing alignment, covering detailed design, earthworks, pavement structures, \nculverts and drainage, bridges, slope protection works, and road appurtenances, among others. \nA total of 31 bridges will be rehabilitated and/or reconstructed. The existing road categories will \nbe maintained and traffic level of service improved.  \n \n12.  Road safety improvement. The project will promote community road safety awareness \nand improve MOT\u2019s road safety management capacity through (i) development of a national \nroad safety action plan, (ii) project road safety audits, and (iii) traffic safety-related training and \npublic campaigns in the project area. The project will also procure (i) mobile weighbridges to \nenhance  control  of  vehicle  overloading  on  the  project  road,  and  (ii)  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance  equipment  (e.g.,  bulldozer,  motor  grader,  and  snow  plow)  to  handle  traffic \ndisruptions and/or road damage caused by extreme natural events.  \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2008.

The government has requested a grant16 not exceeding $100,000,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. OFID will provide a loan of \n$14,000,000 to cofinance the project. The OFID loan will have a 20-year term including a grace \nperiod of 5 years and an annual interest rate of 2.5% (inclusive of a 1.0% service charge). The \nOFID  loan  will  be  administered  by  ADB  on  a  partial  administration  basis  and  will  finance \nexclusively civil works of the project road. The government will provide counterpart funding of \n$22,000,000 to cover (i) taxes and duties related to all civil works, goods, and consulting \nservices; and (ii) land acquisition and resettlement costs, incremental administrative expenses, \nand other miscellaneous costs.

The project road links Dushanbe, the capital and largest domestic market for goods and \nservices, and provides connections among the regional center, provincial areas, sub-districts \nand  the surrounding  rural  area.  The  design, equipment  and  implementation  modality  were \nselected in view of the technical viability, sustainability of the road maintenance operations and \nthe need to improve road safety.  \n \n20.  The project road has been devastated by the civil war and has not been restored for \nover 30 years. Growth of cargo traffic, coupled with damage caused by natural disasters and \nlack of adequate maintenance, has led to rapid deterioration of roads and structural deficiencies \nof bridges. This has caused an unacceptable level of service and requires urgent improvement \nto ensure efficient traffic and safety. The road design allows flexibility for locations constrained \nby terrain and right-of-way, and maximizes the use of local construction materials. The road \nalignment  follows  the  existing  right-of-way,  minimizing  environmental  and  involuntary \nresettlement impacts. Maintenance equipment to be procured and vehicle overloading control \nmeasures to be implemented will improve road service quality and prolong road service life.  \n \n21.  Road safety improvement will be preceded by road safety audits and safety-related \ntraining and public campaigns. Safety improvement measures, primarily simple and low-cost \nsolutions, have been incorporated in the design to mitigate safety concerns as a result of \nincreased traffic speed after road rehabilitation. Road safety will be substantially improved with \nthe provision of traffic signs, marked pedestrian crossings protected by speed humps, and slope \nstabilization netting systems in mountainous sections where soil erosion, rock and debris flow, \nand slope failure often obstruct traffic throughout the year. Different type of traffic calming \ndevices will also be constructed to reduce vehicle speed at entries, exits, and through all \nvillages along the project road. In addition, a review of road safety will continue throughout \nimplementation, including a post-construction audit to correct any potential deficiencies.  \n \n22.  Minor repairs to about 60 km of connecting feeder roads in Ayni and Panjakent districts \nto upgrade them to an all-weather surface will improve access to basic social services, such as \nschools, hospitals, and local markets. These roads will be selected from the list approved by \nMOT and local governments, based on (i) geographic location, (ii) safeguards consideration,  \n(iii) social and economic aspects, and (iv) opportunities for cooperation with other poverty-\nalleviation projects in the area. Consultations with local governments and residents of rural \nvillages will be conducted in order to reach a consensus on which roads to select. The local \ngovernments will be responsible for the continued maintenance following the road repairs. \n \n23.  The project will increase sustainability and efficiency of the road maintenance operations \nby (i) maximizing the use of local construction materials; (ii) providing maintenance equipment \nfor the removal of snow, rock falls, landslide debris; and (iii) procuring and operating mobile \nweighbridges  to  reduce  undue  pavement  damage  from  vehicle  overloading.  The  design \nsolutions and procurement of maintenance equipment will also benefit local road agencies, \nwhose maintenance operations have been hampered by lack of equipment and a large volume \nof maintenance work. With expected institutional improvements, these local organizations will \ndevelop the necessary capacity for sustainable road maintenance in the long run. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The economic analysis compared the with- and without-project scenarios. The project \n ", "  7 \neconomic  benefits  include  (i)  vehicle  operating  cost  savings,  (ii)  travel  time  savings,  \n(iii) generated traffic, and (iv) agricultural producer surplus. The project is economically viable, \nwith an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 18.7%. The sensitivity analysis pertaining to \ncapital investment and economic and traffic growth was conducted to assess the robustness of \nthe results of the economic analysis. The results show the project will maintain its economic \nviability  under  various  unfavorable  scenarios.  A  quantitative  risk  analysis  has  also  been \nundertaken to reinforce the economic appraisal results. A number of key variables relating to \ncross-border traffic, construction cost, economic growth, and traffic disruption from connecting \nroads have been incorporated into the risk analysis to test their effect on the appraisal results. \nRisk analysis results show that the minimum risk-based EIRR is 12.5%, with a 95% probability \nthat the EIRR will be above 15.0%. \n \n25.  The project financing comprises an Asian Development Fund grant from ADB and a loan \nfrom  OFID,  with  the  government  providing  counterpart  funding  for  taxes  and  duties,  land \nacquisition and resettlement costs, and miscellaneous administrative costs.  Accordingly, issues \nregarding funding availability within the government will have a negligible financial impact on the \nproject. MOT road maintenance funding has increased by an average of 17% annually during \n2004\u20132012, with TJS46.8 million ($9.8 million equivalent) in 2012. While this accounts for about \none third of nationwide maintenance needs due to the government\u2019s fiscal constraints, this \nbudget outlay will continue to increase by about 15% per year during 2012\u20132016. In addition, an \nautomated road databank to be developed under an ongoing ADB project will help validate the \nmaintenance budget, and a contract management system to be developed under the same \nproject will contribute to improving sustainability of road projects.18  \n \nC.  Governance  \n \n26.  Tajikistan\u2019s performance in governance has improved in recent years.  Following the \nsector  governance  assessment  completed  in  November  2009,  an  updated  assessment  of \nMOT\u2019s  procurement  capacity  and  financial  management,  among  other  governance-related \naspects, confirmed that its capacity is sufficient to manage international procurement and proper \nfunds flow arrangements, accounting policies and procedures, internal and external audits, and \ninformation  systems.  Obstacles  identified  include  less  transparent  operations,  outdated \noperational tools, and a skills gap. Given some of the governance improvement aspects are \nbeing addressed under other ongoing ADB projects, the project will focus on road safety and \ninfrastructure management through training and consulting services. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed with, the government and MOT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 17). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  Increased connectivity will benefit men and women in access to social services and \ntrade. Many households in the project area are headed by women due to the high incidence of \nlabor migration of men to other countries. The households headed by women  face problems in \ncoping with poverty, as women have less access to land and to local markets to sell their \nagricultural products. The long travel time to markets and limited electricity supply for food \nprocessing activities relegate women to the lower end of the agricultural production value chain. \nThe project will significantly benefit women and men by reducing travel time to reach social \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2010.

Moreover, rural growth, disaster mitigation, education and other poverty \nalleviation  projects  are  being  implemented  in  the  project  area  by  other  international \norganizations, including the United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Children's \nFund, and World Food Programme. By improving transport in the area the project will help these \nprojects realize their full potential. \n \n29.  To expand benefits for women and local communities, the project will finance roadside \npublic facilities for improved travel comfort, road safety measures for reduced traffic injuries, and \nfeeder roads for improved access to markets for poor villages not located on the main road. \nWomen will be employed during civil works construction, and for road maintenance following \nproject completion. The road improvement is a precondition for developing the mining sector in \nthis  region,  which  will  bring  employment  opportunities  for  local  communities,  reduce  labor \nmigration, and ultimately contribute to poverty reduction. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  The project is classified as environment category B. Due diligence confirmed that the \nproject  does  not  pass  through  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas  and  will  not  result  in \nsignificant negative environmental impacts. MOT prepared an initial environmental examination \n(IEE)  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  national  legislation  and \nregulations. The IEE was disclosed on ADB website on 6 July 2012. The project will have \ntemporary and reversible environmental impacts during implementation. Project-affected people \nwere consulted. The IEE includes an environmental management plan to minimize the project\u2019s \npotential environmental impacts. MOT, assisted by an international firm, will be responsible for \nimplementing the plan and submitting a semiannual monitoring report to ADB.  \n \n31.  The project is classified as involuntary resettlement category B. The major impacts are \nthe relocation of three residential houses and possible temporary income loss of several shops \nin the Dar-Dar village during road construction. MOT prepared a resettlement plan according to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and national legislation and regulations to mitigate \nthe impacts and assigned a dedicated staff with resources to carry out the land acquisition and \nresettlement activity of the project. The resettlement plan was disclosed to affected persons \nthrough public consultations and disclosed on the ADB website on 10 July 2012. MOT will \nsubmit  an  updated  resettlement  plan  to  ADB  if  any  changes  are  made  during  project \nimplementation,  following  finalization  of  the  detailed  design.  The  project  is  classified  as \nindigenous peoples category C (it will not affect indigenous peoples, as described in the ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009)). \n \nF.
