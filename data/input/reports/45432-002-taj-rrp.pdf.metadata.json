The  country\u2019s  remoteness  from  seaports,  and  limited \ntransport  infrastructure  and  facilities  constrain  development.  Large  parts  of  the  country  are \nsparsely populated. Connectivity is a key development issue: the railway network is fragmented \nbecause  of  construction  difficulties  resulting  from  the  mountainous  topography,  while  roads \n(which  are  the  dominant  transport  mode)  are  deteriorating  rapidly  due  to  inadequate \nmaintenance, ineffective traffic loading control, and harsh terrain and climate.  \n  \nThe  Zarafshan  Valley  is  an  isolated  and  remote  region,  which  is  prone  to  extreme \n4. \nnatural  events.3 The  project  road  provides  the  only  access  to  rest  of  the  country  and  beyond. \nOverland travel to this high elevation valley is often restricted, particularly during winter, due to \npoor  road  conditions,  avalanches,  and  mudflows.  Consequently,  the  more  than  300,000 \ninhabitants  living  in  the  region  have  limited  access  to  markets,  educational  and  medical \nservices, while the region's capacity to develop diverse industries\u2014including agriculture, mining \nand tourism4\u2014is severely constrained.  \n \nThe project road\u2014part of the historic Silk Road\u2014runs east\u2013west following the Zarafshan \n5. \nRiver through the valley, crossing the Ayni and Panjakent districts before ending at the border \nwith Uzbekistan in the west. The connecting road in Uzbekistan (national road A377) links with \nSamarkand  (about  40  km  from  the  border)  via  the  CAREC  Corridor  6  in  Uzbekistan.  Through \nthe  north\u2013south  transport  artery\u2014the  CAREC  Corridor  6  in  Tajikistan\u2014the  project  road  goes  \n(i)  northeast  to  Khudjand  (the  provincial  center),  and  onward  to  Uzbekistan;  and  (ii)  south  to \nDushanbe, onward to Afghanistan and east\u2013west bound to the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan \n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Manila. \n\n3 The valley is located in northern Tajikistan, comprising the districts of Ayni, Kuhistoni Mastchoh, and Panjakent and \nbelonging to the Sughd province. The valley has one of the highest migration rates in Central Asia and is one of the \npoorest regions, with per capita gross domestic product about 60% of the national average in 2010. \n\n4 Aside from abundant agricultural products, Zarafshan Valley is one of the country's main tourist attractions, featuring \nan  ancient  history  with  the  country\u2019s  only  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  World \nHeritage  site,  and  stunning  natural  scenes  for  hiking,  mountaineering  and  homestays  in  the  valley  and  the \nsurrounding mountains. The valley is also rich in natural resources including gold, coal, phosphate, and antimony.    \n\n\f2 \n\nrespectively  through  the  CAREC  Corridor  3  in  Tajikistan.  The  project  road  is  a  vital  link  in  the \nnational network, and is regionally strategic as it provides a trade corridor with Uzbekistan in the \nlong term,5 particularly for northern Tajikistan. Accordingly, it has been classified as part of the \nCAREC  Corridor  6  and  included  in  the  list  of  CAREC  medium-term  (2011\u20132015)  priority \nprojects.6 Improvements to this road will increase regional connectivity, reduce transport costs, \nand  strengthen  competitiveness.  This  will  also  improve  access  to  markets  and  social  services \nfor  impoverished  local  communities;  stimulate  development  of  agriculture,  tourism  and  mining \nindustries that in return create job opportunities and improve the region\u2019s living standards.   \n  \n6. \nProgress  has  been  made  on  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  transport \nsector, 7  including  (i)  developing  the  Transport  Sector  Master  Plan; 8  (ii)  outsourcing  the \nperformance-based maintenance contracts to the private sector; (iii) restructuring the Ministry of \nTransport  (MOT);  and  (iv)  refining  the  budget  process  by  including  provisions  for  capital \ninvestment, operation, and maintenance. Substantial gaps remain, however. The core problem \nis  the  constrained  road  transport  connectivity,  attributable  to  deteriorating  infrastructure  and \ndeficient asset management. This has hampered economic and social development by limiting \naccess  to  markets  and  social  services,  and  increasing  transport  costs.  Under  the  project,  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  the  connectivity  improvement  and  also  help \nimprove road safety, road maintenance, and vehicle overloading control. \n \nThe government, in its poverty reduction strategy for 2010\u20132012,9 notes the importance \n7. \nof infrastructure development in promoting economic development, creating favorable conditions \nfor poverty reduction and achieving the main goals of the National Development Strategy up to \n2015.10 One  of  the  government\u2019s  main  objectives  is  to  unblock  bottlenecks  of  the  country\u2019s \ntransport network by improving roads and railways. The project is included in the government\u2019s \n2012\u20132014 public investment program,11 fits with two core operational areas (infrastructure and \n\n                                                 \n5   Facilitated  by  relaxed  customs  and  visa  requirements,  the  project  road  was  for  years  predominantly  used  for \ntourists,  local  trade  and  mining  operations  activities  higher  up  the  valley  in  Tajikistan,  with  cross-border  traffic  of \nabout  1,000  vehicles  per  day.  The  border  crossing  point  was  closed  by  Uzbekistan  in  November  2010  due  to \ndeteriorating bilateral relations. Tajikistan is making efforts\u2014including construction of a dedicated market place for \nbilateral  trading,  planned  upgrade  of  the  border  infrastructure,  and  continuation  of  dialogue  with  Uzbekistan\u2014for \nthe border reopening in the near future. \n\n6  Endorsed at the 10th Ministerial Conference on CAREC in Baku, Azerbaijan in November 2011 and confirmed at \nthe  11th  CAREC  Transport  Sector  Coordinating  Committee  Meeting  in  Manila,  Philippines  in  May  2012,  these \nrepresent the operational priority projects of CAREC for the next 5 years, and form an integral part of medium-term \npriority projects for the 10-year CAREC strategic framework (CAREC 2020). \n\n7  ADB implemented a series of technical assistance and road projects to support institutional and policy reforms in \nthe transport sector, including (i) ADB. 2000.

The  government \nand development partners recognize transport as one of ADB\u2019s main areas of expertise.14 The \nproject  design  incorporates  the  key  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  transport  sector  in \nTajikistan  and  other  Central  Asian  countries,  including  (i)  obtaining  government  assurances \nregarding adequate maintenance funding of the project road, and increases in financing of road \nimplementation  delays;  \nmaintenance; \n(iii)  strengthening  the  executing  agency\u2019s  capacity,  and  (iv)  expanding  the  project\u2019s  social \ndevelopment benefits. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe impact of the project will be enhanced regional cooperation and inclusive economic \ngrowth  in  Tajikistan,  particularly  in  the  Sughd  province.  The  outcome  will  be  improved \nconnectivity and mobility along the CAREC Corridor 6 (Ayni\u2013Uzbekistan Border Road). \n \nC. \n \nThe  outputs  will  comprise  (i)  approximately  113  km  of  rehabilitated  and  reconstructed \n10. \nroad  between  Ayni\u2013Panjakent  and  the  border  with  Uzbekistan,  (ii)  improved  road  safety,  and  \n(iii) upgraded Sarazm border post infrastructure and improved local communities.  \n \nRoad rehabilitation and reconstruction. The project will improve a 47-km category IV \n11. \nmountainous  road  section  (from  Ayni  roundabout  to  km  47)  and  a  66-km  category  III  plain \nsection with minor rolling (from km 47 to the border with Uzbekistan).15 Road improvement work \nwill  use  the  existing  alignment,  covering  detailed  design,  earthworks,  pavement  structures, \nculverts and drainage, bridges, slope protection works, and road appurtenances, among others. \nA total of 31 bridges will be rehabilitated and/or reconstructed. The existing road categories will \nbe maintained and traffic level of service improved.  \n \nRoad safety improvement.

It  has  implemented  six  ADB-financed  road  projects \nsince  1998  and  has  reasonable  project  management  capacity.  Its  project  implementation  unit \n(PIU) staff have the necessary experience and skills. MOT technical departments will also assist \nthe PIU during project implementation.  \n \n17. \nAn international firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  to  (i)  help  the  PIU  supervise  project \nimplementation,  (ii)  provide  hands-on  training  in  project  management  and  reporting,  and  (iii) \nimprove  institutional  capacity  in  road  safety  management  and  promote  community  road  safety \nawareness.  All  procurement  financed  under  the  ADB  grant  and  the  ADB-administered  OFID \nloan  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s prior review procedures.  \n \n18. \nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  to  expedite  pre-construction  works  and \navoid  initial  implementation  delays  have  been  proposed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and \nconsulting  guidelines.

The  design,  equipment  and  implementation  modality  were \nselected in view of the technical viability, sustainability of the road maintenance operations and \nthe need to improve road safety.  \n \n20. \nThe  project  road  has  been  devastated  by  the  civil  war  and  has  not  been  restored  for \nover  30  years.  Growth  of  cargo  traffic,  coupled  with  damage  caused  by  natural  disasters  and \nlack of adequate maintenance, has led to rapid deterioration of roads and structural deficiencies \nof bridges. This has caused an unacceptable level of service and requires urgent improvement \nto ensure efficient traffic and safety. The road design allows flexibility for locations constrained \nby  terrain  and  right-of-way,  and  maximizes  the  use  of  local  construction  materials.  The  road \ninvoluntary \nalignment \nresettlement  impacts.  Maintenance  equipment  to  be  procured  and  vehicle  overloading  control \nmeasures to be implemented will improve road service quality and prolong road service life.  \n \nRoad  safety  improvement  will  be  preceded  by  road  safety  audits  and  safety-related \n21. \ntraining  and  public  campaigns.  Safety  improvement  measures,  primarily  simple  and  low-cost \nsolutions,  have  been  incorporated  in  the  design  to  mitigate  safety  concerns  as  a  result  of \nincreased traffic speed after road rehabilitation. Road safety will be substantially improved with \nthe provision of traffic signs, marked pedestrian crossings protected by speed humps, and slope \nstabilization netting systems in mountainous sections where soil erosion, rock and debris flow, \nand  slope  failure  often  obstruct  traffic  throughout  the  year.  Different  type  of  traffic  calming \ndevices  will  also  be  constructed  to  reduce  vehicle  speed  at  entries,  exits,  and  through  all \nvillages  along  the  project  road.  In  addition,  a  review  of  road  safety  will  continue  throughout \nimplementation, including a post-construction audit to correct any potential deficiencies.  \n \n22. \nMinor repairs to about 60 km of connecting feeder roads in Ayni and Panjakent districts \nto upgrade them to an all-weather surface will improve access to basic social services, such as \nschools,  hospitals,  and  local  markets.  These  roads  will  be  selected  from  the  list  approved  by \nMOT  and  local  governments,  based  on  (i)  geographic  location,  (ii)  safeguards  consideration,  \n(iii)  social  and  economic  aspects,  and  (iv)  opportunities  for  cooperation  with  other  poverty-\nalleviation  projects  in  the  area.  Consultations  with  local  governments  and  residents  of  rural \nvillages  will  be  conducted  in  order  to  reach  a  consensus  on  which  roads  to  select.  The  local \ngovernments will be responsible for the continued maintenance following the road repairs. \n \nThe project will increase sustainability and efficiency of the road maintenance operations \n23. \nby (i) maximizing the use of local construction materials; (ii) providing maintenance equipment \nfor  the  removal  of  snow,  rock  falls,  landslide  debris;  and  (iii)  procuring  and  operating  mobile \nweighbridges  to  reduce  undue  pavement  damage  from  vehicle  overloading.  The  design \nsolutions  and  procurement  of  maintenance  equipment  will  also  benefit  local  road  agencies, \nwhose maintenance operations have been hampered by lack of equipment and a large volume \nof  maintenance  work.  With  expected  institutional  improvements,  these  local  organizations  will \ndevelop the necessary capacity for sustainable road maintenance in the long run. \n \nB. \n \n24. \n\nThe  economic  analysis  compared  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  project \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\neconomic  benefits  include  (i)  vehicle  operating  cost  savings,  (ii)  travel  time  savings,  \n(iii) generated traffic, and (iv) agricultural producer surplus. The project is economically viable, \nwith an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 18.7%. The sensitivity analysis pertaining to \ncapital investment and economic and traffic growth was conducted to assess the robustness of \nthe  results  of  the  economic  analysis.  The  results  show  the  project  will  maintain  its  economic \nviability  under  various  unfavorable  scenarios.  A  quantitative  risk  analysis  has  also  been \nundertaken  to  reinforce  the  economic  appraisal  results.  A  number  of  key  variables  relating  to \ncross-border  traffic,  construction  cost,  economic  growth,  and  traffic  disruption  from  connecting \nroads have been incorporated into the risk analysis to test their effect on the appraisal results. \nRisk analysis results show that the minimum risk-based EIRR is 12.5%, with a 95% probability \nthat the EIRR will be above 15.0%. \n \nThe project financing comprises an Asian Development Fund grant from ADB and a loan \n25. \nfrom  OFID,  with  the  government  providing  counterpart  funding  for  taxes  and  duties,  land \nacquisition and resettlement costs, and miscellaneous administrative costs.  Accordingly, issues \nregarding funding availability within the government will have a negligible financial impact on the \nproject.  MOT  road  maintenance  funding  has  increased  by  an  average  of  17%  annually  during \n2004\u20132012, with TJS46.8 million ($9.8 million equivalent) in 2012. While this accounts for about \none  third  of  nationwide  maintenance  needs  due  to  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  constraints,  this \nbudget outlay will continue to increase by about 15% per year during 2012\u20132016. In addition, an \nautomated road databank to be developed under an ongoing ADB project will help validate the \nmaintenance  budget,  and  a  contract  management  system  to  be  developed  under  the  same \nproject will contribute to improving sustainability of road projects.18  \n \nC. \n \n26. \nTajikistan\u2019s  performance  in  governance  has  improved  in  recent  years.    Following  the \nsector  governance  assessment  completed  in  November  2009,  an  updated  assessment  of \nMOT\u2019s  procurement  capacity  and  financial  management,  among  other  governance-related \naspects, confirmed that its capacity is sufficient to manage international procurement and proper \nfunds flow arrangements, accounting policies and procedures, internal and external audits, and \ninformation  systems.  Obstacles  identified  include  less  transparent  operations,  outdated \noperational  tools,  and  a  skills  gap.  Given  some  of  the  governance  improvement  aspects  are \nbeing  addressed  under  other  ongoing  ADB  projects,  the  project  will  focus  on  road  safety  and \ninfrastructure management through training and consulting services. \n \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \n27. \ndiscussed with, the government and MOT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 17). \n \nD. \n \n28. \nIncreased  connectivity  will  benefit  men  and  women  in  access  to  social  services  and \ntrade. Many households in the project area are headed by women due to the high incidence of \nlabor migration of men to other countries. The households headed by women  face problems in \ncoping  with  poverty,  as  women  have  less  access  to  land  and  to  local  markets  to  sell  their \nagricultural  products.  The  long  travel  time  to  markets  and  limited  electricity  supply  for  food \nprocessing activities relegate women to the lower end of the agricultural production value chain. \nThe  project  will  significantly  benefit  women  and  men  by  reducing  travel  time  to  reach  social \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nGovernance  \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB.  2010.

Moreover, rural growth, disaster mitigation, education and other poverty \nalleviation  projects  are  being  implemented  in  the  project  area  by  other  international \norganizations, including the United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Children's \nFund, and World Food Programme. By improving transport in the area the project will help these \nprojects realize their full potential. \n \n29. \nTo expand benefits for women and local communities, the project will finance roadside \npublic facilities for improved travel comfort, road safety measures for reduced traffic injuries, and \nfeeder  roads  for  improved  access  to  markets  for  poor  villages  not  located  on  the  main  road. \nWomen  will  be  employed  during  civil  works  construction,  and  for  road  maintenance  following \nproject completion. The road improvement is a precondition for developing the mining sector in \nthis  region,  which  will  bring  employment  opportunities  for  local  communities,  reduce  labor \nmigration, and ultimately contribute to poverty reduction. \n \nE. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B.  Due  diligence  confirmed  that  the \n30. \nproject  does  not  pass  through  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas  and  will  not  result  in \nsignificant negative environmental impacts. MOT prepared an initial environmental examination \n(IEE)  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  national  legislation  and \nregulations.  The  IEE  was  disclosed  on  ADB  website  on  6  July  2012.  The  project  will  have \ntemporary and reversible environmental impacts during implementation. Project-affected people \nwere consulted. The IEE includes an environmental management plan to minimize the project\u2019s \npotential environmental impacts. MOT, assisted by an international firm, will be responsible for \nimplementing the plan and submitting a semiannual monitoring report to ADB.  \n \n31. \nThe project is classified as involuntary resettlement category B. The major impacts are \nthe relocation of three residential houses and possible temporary income loss of several shops \nin the Dar-Dar village during road construction. MOT prepared a resettlement plan according to \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  national  legislation  and  regulations  to  mitigate \nthe impacts and assigned a dedicated staff with resources to carry out the land acquisition and \nresettlement  activity  of  the  project.  The  resettlement  plan  was  disclosed  to  affected  persons \nthrough  public  consultations  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  10  July  2012.  MOT  will \nsubmit  an  updated  resettlement  plan  to  ADB  if  any  changes  are  made  during  project \nimplementation,  following  finalization  of  the  detailed  design.  The  project  is  classified  as \nindigenous peoples category C (it will not affect indigenous peoples, as described in the ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009)). \n \nF. \n \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \n32. \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The integrated project benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the project costs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInadequate road \nmaintenance \n\nDelayed reopening of \ncross-border trade \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  government  covenants  to  increase  annual  road  maintenance \nbudget  from  TJS3,000  per  km  in  2011  to  TJS6,000  per  km  in  2016. \nUnder the project, mobile weighbridges will be procured and operated to \nenhance vehicle overloading control, and road maintenance equipment \nwill  be  procured  to  address  traffic  disruption  and/or  road  damage  from \nextreme natural events. \nTajikistan  is  making  efforts  to  reopen  the  border.
