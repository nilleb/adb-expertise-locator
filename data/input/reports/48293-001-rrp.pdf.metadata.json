THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Solomon Islands for the Transport Sector Flood \nRecovery Project. 1 \n2.  The project will support the efforts of the Government of Solomon Islands to reconstruct, \nand climate- and disaster-proof, the transport sector infrastructure damaged by flash floods in \nApril 2014. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Solomon Islands is a vast Melanesian country with a total land area of about 28,000 \nsquare kilometers comprising six large islands, dozens of smaller islands, and hundreds of islets \nand atolls. It is one of the 20 countries in the world deemed most vulnerable to disasters caused \nby natural hazards, being subjected to cyclones, floods, landslides, storm surges, earthquakes, \ntsunamis, and droughts. Flooding has occurred with relentless frequency in Solomon Islands.2 \nClimate change will affect disaster risks through changes in climate hazards, as more extreme \nweather events are likely to increase in the future. The country is already experiencing higher \ntemperatures, changing rainfall patterns, varying frequencies of natural hazard events, and sea-\nlevel rise. Transport infrastructure in particular is highly vulnerable to these hazards.  \n4.  On 3\u20135 April 2014, prolonged heavy rainfall associated with a tropical depression, which \nlater became Tropical Cyclone Ita, caused severe flooding in Solomon Islands. The areas worst \naffected were east and west Guadalcanal and the capital, Honiara. Major infrastructure such as \nroads, bridges, housing, and sewerage and water supply systems were damaged or destroyed. \nThe flooding caused 23 fatalities, displaced 10,000 people and affected about 52,000 people \noverall.  On  4  April  2014,  the  government  declared  a  state  of  disaster  for  Honiara  and \nGuadalcanal Province and on 5 April, it requested international emergency assistance to aid \nrelief efforts.   \n5.  The flooding is expected to  substantially slow  economic growth, largely  due to the \nclosure of the Gold Ridge mine because of a damaged bridge on the road leading to the mine. \nThe real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2014 could be expected to decline from pre-\nflood projections of 3% to -1%.3 \n6.  In May 2014, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners \nconducted a rapid assessment of the macro and sector-specific impacts of the flash floods.4 \nTotal damage and losses were estimated at $107.7 million, equivalent to 9.2% of Solomon \nIslands\u2019 GDP. The sectors that sustained the highest level of damage were housing (accounting \nfor 56% of damage) and transport (accounting for 23% of damage, and 63% of recovery needs). \nThe  assessment  highlighted  that  the  repairs  to  roads  and  bridges  should  be  carried  out \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 In the past, flood damage in Honiara and Guadalcanal has been associated with Cyclone Angela (1966), Cyclone \nGlenda (1967), Cyclone Carlotta (1972), Cyclone Kerry (1979), Cyclone Bernie (1982), Cyclone Namu (1986), \nCyclone Ului (2010), Cyclone Yasi (2011), and with excessively heavy rainfall in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012. \n3 ADB 2014. Pacific Economic Monitor, July. Manila. \n4 Government of Solomon Islands, 2014. Rapid Assessment of the Macro and Sectoral Impacts. Honiara. ", "2 \nimmediately to minimize secondary impacts on the economy, and to restore connectivity to \nessential  services  such  as  hospitals,  schools,  markets,  and  main  commercial  centers  in \nHoniara. \n7.  The government has been working with the international community, civil society, and \nother stakeholders to address humanitarian response needs, and is now preparing a recovery \nplan based on the rapid assessment (footnote 4). The disaster relief budget allocated to the \nNational Disaster Council is SI$1.9 million ($263,000), and it was quickly exhausted after the \nfloods. This is the second year in a row that a single disaster has exhausted not only the relief \nbudget of the council, but also its operational budget. This poses serious concern should \nanother event strike Solomon Islands in 2014.  \n8.  Various organizations such as bilateral aid agencies, United Nations (UN) agencies, and \nnongovernment organizations provided emergency relief immediately after the flash floods. As \npart  of  the  UN  Pacific  Humanitarian  Team  support,  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme,  through  the  Pacific  Risk  Resilience  Programme  funded  by  the  Australian \nGovernment, provided early recovery technical advice to the Ministry of Provincial Development \nand  the  National  Disaster  Management  Office.  The  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Community \nprovided disaster coordination capacity support. On 16 April 2014, ADB approved a $200,000 \ngrant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund facility for humanitarian and relief efforts.  \n9.  A combination of large flows and debris buildup caused extensive damage to bridges, \nincluding damage to piers, abutments, approaches, scour protection, and service connections. \nSeveral bridges, bridge approaches, causeways, and culverts collapsed or were completely \nwashed away. The accumulation of debris and sediments blocked roadside drains, eroded \nchannels, and damaged road shoulders. Landslides were recorded in several places, and the \nsubmergence  of  roads  for  extended  periods  after  the  flooding  resulted  in  accelerated \ndegradation of the pavement. Access was cut at several locations, and Henderson International \nAirport was closed for 2 days. Road transport also sustained economic losses from longer travel \ntimes  due  to  congestion  and  lengthier  alternative  routes,  and  because  some  landowners \nrequested payments for use of road diversions. Vehicle operating costs increased accordingly.  \n \n10.  In  assessing  reconstruction  needs,  the  government  prioritized  the  reconstruction  of \ntransport sector infrastructure and adopted the building-back-better principle by requiring that \ndamaged  assets  be  rebuilt  to  a  higher  standard  of  climate  and  disaster  resilience.  The \ngovernment has invested $1.39 million through the National Transport Fund (NTF) to restore \ntemporary connectivity of the highways from east and west Guadalcanal to the capital Honiara \nand to the international airport. Total recovery and reconstruction needs for the transport sector \nare estimated at $34.66 million, and after contributions from the NTF, and the governments of \nAustralia ($3.76 million), Japan ($10.00 million), and New Zealand ($1.22 million), $18.29 million \nremains  unmet.  On  16  May  2014,  the  government  requested  to  access  ADB\u2019s  Disaster \nResponse Facility to finance reconstruction of transport infrastructure damaged by the flash \nfloods.5 World Bank and UN agencies will focus on other sectors including housing, water \nsupply, health, and education. \n \n \n \n                                                \n5 ADB\u2019s policy on Piloting a Disaster Response Facility became effective on 1 January 2013. \n ", "3 \n11.  ADB offers a comparative advantage in transport infrastructure reconstruction. ADB has \nbeen supporting the government\u2019s efforts to develop and improve the transport sector since \n2000 through six projects.6 The Sustainable Transport Improvement Investment Program, which \nwill use the results-based lending modality, is under preparation. Some of the ongoing ADB \nTransport Sector Development Project (TSDP) resources have been redirected to assist the \ndamage assessment and emergency restoration.   \n12.  The  National  Transport  Plan  (NTP),  developed  with  support  from  ADB  technical \nassistance, 7  formally sets out a strategic and policy framework to (i) develop transport services, \n(ii)  maintain  and  develop  physical  infrastructure,  (iii)  improve  the  capacity  of  government \nagencies, and (iv) develop the private sector. Under ADB\u2019s assistance, the government has \nestablished the NTF, which pools the funds from the government and development partners for \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  transport  infrastructure.  ADB  will  provide  its  emergency \nassistance  through  a  sector  approach,  which  allows  the  government  to  take  the  lead  in \nidentifying, prioritizing, appraising, designing, and implementing subprojects in line with its NTP. \nMID will propose the transport infrastructure reconstruction on behalf of the government. The \napproval of the subprojects will be based on satisfactory technical, economic, and safeguard \nassessments in compliance with eligibility criteria agreed between the government and ADB, \nbased on the prioritization and selection criteria defined in the NTP.8  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the project will be socioeconomic activities restored to at least pre-flood \nlevels. The outcome will be restored and more resilient connectivity.  \n \nC.  Output \n \n14.  The  project  will  have  one  output:  transport  infrastructure  in  priority  locations \nreconstructed, and climate- and disaster-proofed. The subprojects will include reconstruction \nand climate- and disaster-proofing of at least three high-level bridges and five small stream \ncrossings, 1.6 kilometers (km) of bridge approach roads, 80 meters of cross culverts, 1 km of \nbridge and approach road protection work, and 300 meters of river training. All reconstruction \nwork will incorporate gender-conscious designs. \n \n \n \n                                                \n6 ADB. 2000.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR4,289,000 \n(equivalent to $6,610,000), and a grant9 not exceeding $6,610,000, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources through the Disaster Response Facility to help finance the project. The loan will have \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum; a term of 40 years, including a grace period of \n10 years; repayment of principal at 2% per annum for the first 10 years after the grace period \nand 4% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft \nfinancing agreement. Interest during construction will be capitalized under the loan. The loan \nand grant will be used for the procurement of equipment and materials, civil works, services, \nrelated transportation, insurance, installation costs, consulting services, and contingencies. The \ngovernment will provide the equivalent of $2.36 million as in-kind contribution in the form of \nadministrative  services,  office  space,  audit  fees,  counterpart  staff,  service  relocation,  and \nexemption on taxes and duties, and will finance any potential land acquisition. ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement 2009 (SPS) will apply to all civil works.  \n17.

The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Solomon Islands had a moderate risk of \ndebt distress and was therefore eligible to receive 50% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants. \n ", "5 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements  \n18.  The Ministry of Infrastructure Development (MID) will be the executing agency, and it will \nimplement  the  project  through  the  central  project  implementation  unit  (CPIU).  A  team  of \ninternational  and  national  consultants  will  be  mobilized  and  integrated  into  the  CPIU  to \nstrengthen  MID\u2019s  technical  and  managerial  capacity  in  project  implementation.10 Advance \ncontracting  shall  be  undertaken  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants  to  accelerate  project \nimplementation. The government has requested ADB to recruit the consultants. The director of \nthe  CPIU  will  oversee  the  overall  implementation  of  the  project.  The  CPIU,  supported  by \nconsultants and MID\u2019s technical, administrative, and financial staff, will be responsible for design \nand  day-to-day  implementation,  financial  management,  safeguards,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the project. The CPIU will be responsible for procurement and administering \ncontracts  on  behalf  of  MID.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), and all \nconsulting  services  will  be  procured  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n19.  The project will be implemented over 2 years and 9 months, which is longer than the \ntypical period of 2 years for emergency assistance projects. This is justified because of the \nseverity of damages in the transport sector caused by the flooding, and the government\u2019s \ncapacity constraints in meeting the recovery needs and in ensuring that the designs include \nhigher  standards  of  climate  and  disaster  resilience  to  prevent  the  same  level  of  damage \noccurring in the future.  \n20.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.11 \n \n                                                \n10\n To provide prompt emergency response in line with the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), the \nTSDP will engage additional consultants using the grant savings (i) to strengthen the management and technical \ncapacity of the CPIU and (ii) to undertake feasibility studies, detailed engineering design, and tendering of civil \nworks to be implemented under this project. The same consultants will continue assisting construction supervision \nunder the same contract, but such activity will be financed under this project. \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2014\u2013June 2017  \nEstimated completion date  June 2017.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  The project supports activities that respond to critical post-flood reconstruction needs \nand transport sector priorities of the Solomon Islands. The project is coordinated with, and \nsupported by, other development partners, and the sector-based approach will bolster country \nownership and further improve development coordination. The rapid assessment of macro and \nsector-specific impacts (footnote 4), which includes a long list of damaged sites, and Solomon \nIslands\u2019 NTP are the basis for the selection of subprojects. Subprojects will be chosen using the \nselection  criteria  (footnote  8),  option  analysis,  cost  estimates,  and  feasibility  studies.  The \ndetailed engineering designs will include measures to support the socially vulnerable such as \nwomen, children, and the disabled; and adopt a sustainable maintenance strategy that takes \ninto account future traffic growth as well as climate and disaster risks.  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004)12 provides the flexibility to \nconduct  the  economic  analysis  after  ADB  Board  approval.  The  economic  analysis  for  the \nsubprojects  will  be  undertaken  before  their  implementation,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Project.13 MID will use the NTF mechanism to fund \n                                                \n12  ADB. 2004.

The NTF is \nenhancing  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  prioritize  actions,  allocate  resources,  sustain \nimplementation  of  national  transport  infrastructure,  and  support  disaster  management  and \nrecovery. The financial analysis will include (i) a projection of incremental recurrent costs, such \nas operations and maintenance expenditures to ensure sustainability of project or program \nbenefits; and (ii) an assessment of MID\u2019s capacity to fund recurrent costs. Sufficient resources \nwill be allocated to the economic and financial due diligence. \nC.  Governance \n23.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  MID  conducted \nunder the TSDP has been updated for the project.14 The assessment evaluated MID in its role \nas the executing agency for the project. It concluded that despite significant improvements, \npublic financial management remains weak, but assessed the risks as moderate. One specific \nrisk assessed as high was the lack of internal audit function. Since the implementation of the \nTSDP in 2011, MID (through the CPIU) has been involved in the financial management of \nprojects,  accounting,  financial  reporting,  and  auditing.  MID\u2019s  financial  capacity  has  been \naugmented under the TSDP by a fulltime financial management specialist attached to the CPIU \nand by another financial management advisor stationed in MID\u2019s Accounts Section and financed \nby the Australian Government, both building capacity of MID staff. Given that the proposed \nproject will also be implemented by CPIU, sound accounting and auditing practices will be \napplied to project expenditures. \n24.  Procurement.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  MID  was  conducted  for  the \nTSDP. It concluded that MID has established procurement policies and procedures in place, \nand has considerable experience in implementing external assistance projects. The CPIU is \nadequately  staffed  and  will  be  supported  by  additional  procurement  and  implementation \nconsultants.  \n25.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the executing agency. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual \n(footnote 11).  \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The project\u2019s expected poverty and social benefits, and its impacts on local communities \nwill be analyzed by reviewing previous social and poverty analyses and consultations with \nstakeholders.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  has  been  prepared.15   As \nhighlighted  in  the  rapid  assessment  (footnote  4),  repairs  to  roads  and  bridges  are  being \nprioritized  to  minimize  secondary  impacts  on  the  economy,  and  to  restore  connectivity  to \nessential services.  \n27.  Gender. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action \nplan has been prepared. Gender differences are evident in travel patterns in Solomon Islands\u2014\nwomen tend to take shorter, more frequent, and dispersed trips during the day to fetch water, \ntend gardens, collect firewood, raise livestock, and process cocoa and copra.

Women  will  be \nencouraged to take up employment during project implementation and subsequent activities \nafter project completion. Equal wages for equal work will be paid to men and women engaged in \nthe project. Various training and awareness activities will be undertaken, such as training on \nlabor-based, equipment-supported contracting and on safeguards; training on road cleaning, \nroadside  vegetation  management,  and  waste  management;  and  awareness  raising  on \nHIV/AIDS,  gender-sensitive  transport  and  road  safety  issues.  A  resettlement  plan  will  be \nprepared for any land acquisition or other non-land impacts; the plan will ensure that equal \ncompensation and assistance will be provided to affected men and women. Gender-specific \ntargets and indicators are integrated into the project\u2019s design and monitoring framework.  \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment. The project is classified as category B for environment. It is expected to \nhave limited, site-specific, and\u2014in most cases\u2014temporary adverse impacts on the environment, \nwhich can be readily mitigated and managed  under the environmental management plans \n(EMPs)  included  in  the  environmental  assessment  of  each  subproject.  An  environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF) has been prepared for the project and posted on \nADB website.16 The EARF requires screening and assessment of each road segment in line \nwith the Environment Act 1998, and for any additional elements to comply with the SPS. During \nconstruction, environmental management will adopt the system now being implemented by the \nCPIU under the TSDP, whereby minor works are guided by either simple or developed EMPs, \nand major works associated with bridges will be subject to full EMPs based on environmental \nassessments and updated during detailed design. In line with ADB's Public Communications \nPolicy 2011, all relevant environmental information will be made available in a timely manner \nand in a form and language understandable to affected people and other stakeholders. ADB will \npost the assessments on its website. \n29.  Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. The project is classified as category B \nfor land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. It is not expected to involve significant land \nacquisition and resettlement activities, because most of the infrastructure will be rehabilitated or \nreconstructed at current locations within the existing road corridor. However, civil works will \nrequire temporary land use or access during construction and this will be obtained through \nagreements with landowners or affected persons. A resettlement framework has been prepared \ndescribing the procedures for (i) screening of land acquisition and resettlement impacts; (ii) \nsocial  impact  assessment  and  preparation  of  a  resettlement  plan,  if  needed;  and  (iii) \nnegotiations and agreements for land access.17 MID has endorsed the resettlement framework, \nwhich has been posted on ADB website.  \n30.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. \nMelanesians are the native people of Solomon Islands and comprise the vast majority of the \npopulation.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  affect  any  distinct  and  vulnerable  groups  of \nindigenous peoples as defined under ADB's SPS. All project components will be implemented in \na culturally appropriate and participatory manner.  \n                                                \n16 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "9 \n31.  The project will help strengthen MID\u2019s capacity for effectively managing environmental \nand social impacts, including (i) training of MID staff and other persons on safeguard activities, \nand (ii) international and national consultants and staff in the CPIU to implement and monitor \nthe project's safeguard activities. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The project has three main risks that are rated medium and considered manageable, \nand they will be largely mitigated during implementation. The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs of the mitigating measures.  Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.18 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nMore frequent or intense future floods or other  The project will ensure that infrastructure \nnatural hazards   investments meet standards for climate and \ndisaster resilience. \nStretched administrative capacity and resources of  Adding capacity to the MID CPIU will strengthen \nthe government undermine implementation and  implementation and coordination capabilities, \neffectiveness of the emergency assistance.  thereby ensuring effective delivery of the \nemergency assistance. \nLimited capacity of MID for operations and  Through the institutional strengthening and \nmaintenance jeopardizes the sustainability of the  capacity development component of the TSDP, the \ninfrastructure.  executing agency is improving operations and \nmaintenance capacity; it is also undergoing training \nto improve its abilities for project implementation \nand operation, and asset management, which will \nboost infrastructure sustainability. \nCPIU = central project implementation unit, MID = Ministry of Infrastructure Development, TSDP = Transport Sector \nDevelopment Project \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and financing documents. \n34.  The government and MID have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the financing agreement.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nV.
