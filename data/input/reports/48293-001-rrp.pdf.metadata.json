It is one of the 20 countries in the world deemed most vulnerable to disasters caused \nby natural hazards, being subjected to cyclones, floods, landslides, storm surges, earthquakes, \ntsunamis,  and  droughts.  Flooding  has  occurred with relentless frequency  in  Solomon Islands.2 \nClimate change will affect disaster risks through changes in climate hazards, as more extreme \nweather  events  are  likely  to increase in the future. The  country  is  already  experiencing  higher \ntemperatures, changing rainfall patterns, varying frequencies of natural hazard events, and sea-\nlevel rise. Transport infrastructure in particular is highly vulnerable to these hazards.  \n\nOn 3\u20135 April 2014, prolonged heavy rainfall associated with a tropical depression, which \n4. \nlater became Tropical Cyclone Ita, caused severe flooding in Solomon Islands. The areas worst \naffected were east and west Guadalcanal and the capital, Honiara. Major infrastructure such as \nroads, bridges, housing, and sewerage and water supply systems were damaged or destroyed. \nThe  flooding  caused  23  fatalities,  displaced  10,000  people  and  affected  about  52,000  people \noverall.  On  4  April  2014,  the  government  declared  a  state  of  disaster  for  Honiara  and \nGuadalcanal  Province  and  on  5  April,  it  requested  international  emergency  assistance  to  aid \nrelief efforts.   \n\n5. \nThe  flooding  is  expected  to  substantially  slow  economic  growth,  largely  due  to  the \nclosure of the Gold Ridge mine because of a damaged bridge on the road leading to the mine. \nThe real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2014 could be expected to decline from pre-\nflood projections of 3% to -1%.3 \n\n6. \nIn  May  2014,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners \nconducted  a  rapid  assessment  of  the  macro  and  sector-specific  impacts  of  the  flash  floods.4 \nTotal  damage  and  losses  were  estimated  at  $107.7  million,  equivalent  to  9.2%  of  Solomon \nIslands\u2019 GDP. The sectors that sustained the highest level of damage were housing (accounting \nfor 56% of damage) and transport (accounting for 23% of damage, and 63% of recovery needs). \nThe  assessment  highlighted  that  the  repairs  to  roads  and  bridges  should  be  carried  out \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 In the past, flood damage in Honiara and Guadalcanal has been associated with Cyclone Angela (1966), Cyclone \nGlenda  (1967),  Cyclone  Carlotta  (1972),  Cyclone  Kerry  (1979),  Cyclone  Bernie  (1982),  Cyclone  Namu  (1986), \nCyclone Ului (2010), Cyclone Yasi (2011), and with excessively heavy rainfall in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012. \n3 ADB 2014. Pacific Economic Monitor, July. Manila. \n4 Government of Solomon Islands, 2014. Rapid Assessment of the Macro and Sectoral Impacts. Honiara. \n\n\fimmediately  to  minimize  secondary  impacts  on  the  economy,  and  to  restore  connectivity  to \nessential  services  such  as  hospitals,  schools,  markets,  and  main  commercial  centers  in \nHoniara. \n\nThe  government  has  been  working  with  the  international  community,  civil  society,  and \n7. \nother  stakeholders to address  humanitarian  response needs,  and  is  now  preparing  a  recovery \nplan  based  on  the  rapid  assessment  (footnote  4).  The  disaster  relief  budget  allocated  to  the \nNational  Disaster  Council  is  SI$1.9  million  ($263,000),  and  it  was  quickly  exhausted  after  the \nfloods. This is the second year in a row that a single disaster has exhausted not only the relief \nbudget  of  the  council,  but  also  its  operational  budget.  This  poses  serious  concern  should \nanother event strike Solomon Islands in 2014.  \n\nVarious organizations such as bilateral aid agencies, United Nations (UN) agencies, and \n8. \nnongovernment  organizations  provided emergency  relief  immediately  after  the flash floods.  As \npart  of  the  UN  Pacific  Humanitarian  Team  support,  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme,  through  the  Pacific  Risk  Resilience  Programme  funded  by  the  Australian \nGovernment, provided early recovery technical advice to the Ministry of Provincial Development \nand  the  National  Disaster  Management  Office.  The  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Community \nprovided disaster  coordination  capacity  support. On 16  April  2014,  ADB approved  a $200,000 \ngrant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund facility for humanitarian and relief efforts.  \n\n9. \nA  combination  of  large  flows  and  debris  buildup  caused  extensive  damage  to  bridges, \nincluding damage to piers, abutments, approaches, scour protection, and service connections. \nSeveral  bridges,  bridge  approaches,  causeways,  and  culverts  collapsed  or  were  completely \nwashed  away.  The  accumulation  of  debris  and  sediments  blocked  roadside  drains,  eroded \nchannels,  and  damaged  road  shoulders.  Landslides  were  recorded  in  several  places,  and  the \nsubmergence  of  roads  for  extended  periods  after  the  flooding  resulted  in  accelerated \ndegradation of the pavement. Access was cut at several locations, and Henderson International \nAirport was closed for 2 days. Road transport also sustained economic losses from longer travel \ntimes  due  to  congestion  and  lengthier  alternative  routes,  and  because  some  landowners \nrequested payments for use of road diversions. Vehicle operating costs increased accordingly.  \n \nIn  assessing  reconstruction  needs,  the  government  prioritized  the  reconstruction  of \n10. \ntransport  sector  infrastructure  and  adopted  the  building-back-better  principle  by  requiring  that \ndamaged  assets  be  rebuilt  to  a  higher  standard  of  climate  and  disaster  resilience.  The \ngovernment  has  invested  $1.39  million  through  the  National  Transport  Fund  (NTF)  to  restore \ntemporary connectivity of the highways from east and west Guadalcanal to the capital Honiara \nand to the international airport. Total recovery and reconstruction needs for the transport sector \nare estimated at $34.66 million, and after contributions from the  NTF, and the governments of \nAustralia ($3.76 million), Japan ($10.00 million), and New Zealand ($1.22 million), $18.29 million \nremains  unmet.  On  16  May  2014,  the  government  requested  to  access  ADB\u2019s  Disaster \nResponse  Facility  to  finance  reconstruction  of  transport  infrastructure  damaged  by  the  flash \nfloods. 5 World  Bank  and  UN  agencies  will  focus  on  other  sectors  including  housing,  water \nsupply, health, and education. \n\n                                                \n5 ADB\u2019s policy on Piloting a Disaster Response Facility became effective on 1 January 2013. \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fADB offers a comparative advantage in transport infrastructure reconstruction. ADB has \n11. \nbeen  supporting  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  and  improve  the  transport  sector  since \n2000 through six projects.6 The Sustainable Transport Improvement Investment Program, which \nwill  use  the  results-based  lending  modality,  is  under  preparation.  Some  of  the  ongoing  ADB \nTransport  Sector  Development  Project  (TSDP)  resources  have  been  redirected  to  assist  the \ndamage assessment and emergency restoration.   \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe  National  Transport  Plan  (NTP),  developed  with  support  from  ADB  technical \nassistance, 7  formally sets out a strategic and policy framework to (i) develop transport services, \n(ii)  maintain  and  develop  physical  infrastructure,  (iii)  improve  the  capacity  of  government \nagencies,  and  (iv)  develop  the  private  sector.  Under  ADB\u2019s  assistance,  the  government  has \nestablished the NTF, which pools the funds from the government and development partners for \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  transport  infrastructure.  ADB  will  provide  its  emergency \nassistance  through  a  sector  approach,  which  allows  the  government  to  take  the  lead  in \nidentifying, prioritizing, appraising, designing, and implementing subprojects in line with its NTP. \nMID  will  propose  the  transport  infrastructure  reconstruction  on  behalf  of  the  government.  The \napproval  of  the  subprojects  will  be  based  on  satisfactory  technical,  economic,  and  safeguard \nassessments  in  compliance  with  eligibility  criteria  agreed  between  the  government  and  ADB, \nbased on the prioritization and selection criteria defined in the NTP.8  \n \nB. \n \n13. \nlevels.

A  team  of \ninternational  and  national  consultants  will  be  mobilized  and  integrated  into  the  CPIU  to \nstrengthen  MID\u2019s  technical  and  managerial  capacity  in  project  implementation. 10  Advance \ncontracting  shall  be  undertaken  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants  to  accelerate  project \nimplementation. The government has requested ADB to recruit the consultants. The director of \nthe  CPIU  will  oversee  the  overall  implementation  of  the  project.  The  CPIU,  supported  by \nconsultants and MID\u2019s technical, administrative, and financial staff, will be responsible for design \nand  day-to-day  implementation,  financial  management,  safeguards,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation  of  the  project.  The  CPIU  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  and  administering \ncontracts  on  behalf  of  MID.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), and all \nconsulting  services  will  be  procured  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n19. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  2  years  and  9  months,  which  is  longer  than  the \ntypical  period  of  2  years  for  emergency  assistance  projects.  This  is  justified  because  of  the \nseverity  of  damages  in  the  transport  sector  caused  by  the  flooding,  and  the  government\u2019s \ncapacity  constraints  in  meeting  the  recovery  needs  and  in  ensuring  that  the  designs  include \nhigher  standards  of  climate  and  disaster  resilience  to  prevent  the  same  level  of  damage \noccurring in the future.  \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n20. \nthe project administration manual.11 \n\n \n\n                                                \n10 To  provide  prompt  emergency  response  in  line  with  the  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004),  the \nTSDP  will engage additional consultants using the grant savings (i) to strengthen the management and technical \ncapacity  of  the  CPIU  and  (ii)  to  undertake  feasibility  studies,  detailed  engineering  design,  and  tendering  of  civil \nworks to be implemented under this project.

The  project  is  coordinated  with,  and \nsupported  by,  other  development  partners,  and  the  sector-based  approach will  bolster country \nownership and further improve development coordination. The rapid assessment of macro and \nsector-specific impacts (footnote 4), which includes a long list of damaged sites, and Solomon \nIslands\u2019 NTP are the basis for the selection of subprojects. Subprojects will be chosen using the \nselection  criteria  (footnote  8),  option  analysis,  cost  estimates,  and  feasibility  studies.  The \ndetailed  engineering  designs  will  include  measures  to  support  the  socially  vulnerable  such  as \nwomen,  children,  and  the  disabled;  and  adopt  a  sustainable  maintenance  strategy  that  takes \ninto account future traffic growth as well as climate and disaster risks.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004) 12 provides  the  flexibility  to \n22. \nconduct  the  economic  analysis  after  ADB  Board  approval.  The  economic  analysis  for  the \nsubprojects  will  be  undertaken  before  their  implementation,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Project.13 MID  will  use  the  NTF  mechanism  to  fund \n\n                                                \n12  ADB. 2004.

The  NTF  is \nenhancing \nresources,  sustain \nimplementation  of  national  transport  infrastructure,  and  support  disaster  management  and \nrecovery. The financial analysis will include (i) a projection of incremental recurrent costs, such \nas  operations  and  maintenance  expenditures  to  ensure  sustainability  of  project  or  program \nbenefits; and (ii) an assessment of MID\u2019s capacity to fund recurrent costs. Sufficient resources \nwill be allocated to the economic and financial due diligence. \n\nto  prioritize  actions,  allocate \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  MID  conducted \nunder the TSDP has been updated for the project.14 The assessment evaluated MID in its role \nas  the  executing  agency  for  the  project.  It  concluded  that  despite  significant  improvements, \npublic financial management remains weak, but assessed the risks as moderate. One specific \nrisk  assessed  as  high  was  the  lack  of  internal  audit  function.  Since  the  implementation  of  the \nTSDP  in  2011,  MID  (through  the  CPIU)  has  been  involved  in  the  financial  management  of \nprojects,  accounting,  financial  reporting,  and  auditing.  MID\u2019s  financial  capacity  has  been \naugmented under the TSDP by a fulltime financial management specialist attached to the CPIU \nand by another financial management advisor stationed in MID\u2019s Accounts Section and financed \nby  the  Australian  Government,  both  building  capacity  of  MID  staff.  Given  that  the  proposed \nproject  will  also  be  implemented  by  CPIU,  sound  accounting  and  auditing  practices  will  be \napplied to project expenditures. \n\n24. \nProcurement.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  MID  was  conducted  for  the \nTSDP.  It  concluded  that  MID  has  established  procurement  policies  and  procedures  in  place, \nand  has  considerable  experience  in  implementing  external  assistance  projects.  The  CPIU  is \nadequately  staffed  and  will  be  supported  by  additional  procurement  and  implementation \nconsultants.  \n\n25. \nAnticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the executing agency. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual \n(footnote 11).  \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe project\u2019s expected poverty and social benefits, and its impacts on local communities \n26. \nwill  be  analyzed  by  reviewing  previous  social  and  poverty  analyses  and  consultations  with \nstakeholders.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  has  been  prepared. 15    As \nhighlighted  in  the  rapid  assessment  (footnote  4),  repairs  to  roads  and  bridges  are  being \nprioritized  to  minimize  secondary  impacts  on  the  economy,  and  to  restore  connectivity  to \nessential services.  \n\n27. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  action \nplan has been prepared. Gender differences are evident in travel patterns in Solomon Islands\u2014\nwomen tend to take  shorter,  more frequent,  and  dispersed  trips during  the  day  to fetch water, \ntend gardens,  collect firewood,  raise livestock, and process  cocoa  and copra. The  design  and \n\n                                                \n14 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fsupervision  consultants  will  ensure  that  the  reconstruction  will  include  gender-conscious \ndesigns  such  as  foot  paths  and  railings  on  bridges,  and  pathways  to  access  the  river. \nContractors are encouraged to prioritize the use of local materials and the employment of local \nworkers,  and  to  maximize  the  use  of  women  in  labor-intensive  activities.  Women  will  be \nencouraged  to  take  up  employment  during  project  implementation  and  subsequent  activities \nafter project completion. Equal wages for equal work will be paid to men and women engaged in \nthe  project.  Various  training  and  awareness  activities  will  be  undertaken,  such  as  training  on \nlabor-based,  equipment-supported  contracting  and  on  safeguards;  training  on  road  cleaning, \nroadside  vegetation  management,  and  waste  management;  and  awareness  raising  on \nHIV/AIDS,  gender-sensitive  transport  and  road  safety  issues.  A  resettlement  plan  will  be \nprepared  for  any  land  acquisition  or  other  non-land  impacts;  the  plan  will  ensure  that  equal \ncompensation  and  assistance  will  be  provided  to  affected  men  and  women.  Gender-specific \ntargets and indicators are integrated into the project\u2019s design and monitoring framework.  \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The project  is classified as category B for environment. It is expected to \n28. \nhave limited, site-specific, and\u2014in most cases\u2014temporary adverse impacts on the environment, \nwhich  can  be  readily  mitigated  and  managed  under  the  environmental  management  plans \n(EMPs)  included  in  the  environmental  assessment  of  each  subproject.  An  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  and  posted  on \nADB  website.16 The  EARF  requires  screening  and  assessment  of  each  road  segment  in  line \nwith the Environment Act 1998, and for any additional elements to comply with the SPS. During \nconstruction, environmental management will adopt the system now being implemented by the \nCPIU under the TSDP, whereby minor works are guided by either simple or developed EMPs, \nand major  works  associated  with  bridges  will  be  subject  to  full  EMPs  based  on  environmental \nassessments  and  updated  during  detailed  design.  In  line  with  ADB's  Public  Communications \nPolicy  2011,  all  relevant  environmental  information  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner \nand in a form and language understandable to affected people and other stakeholders. ADB will \npost the assessments on its website. \n\n29. \nLand acquisition and involuntary resettlement. The project is classified as category B \nfor  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  It  is  not  expected  to  involve  significant  land \nacquisition and resettlement activities, because most of the infrastructure will be rehabilitated or \nreconstructed  at  current  locations  within  the  existing  road  corridor.  However,  civil  works  will \nrequire  temporary  land  use  or  access  during  construction  and  this  will  be  obtained  through \nagreements with landowners or affected persons. A resettlement framework has been prepared \ndescribing  the  procedures  for  (i)  screening  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts;  (ii) \nsocial  impact  assessment  and  preparation  of  a  resettlement  plan,  if  needed;  and  (iii) \nnegotiations and agreements for land access.17 MID has endorsed the resettlement framework, \nwhich has been posted on ADB website.  \n\n30. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples. \nMelanesians  are  the  native  people  of  Solomon  Islands  and  comprise  the  vast  majority  of  the \npopulation.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  affect  any  distinct  and  vulnerable  groups  of \nindigenous peoples as defined under ADB's SPS. All project components will be implemented in \na culturally appropriate and participatory manner.  \n\n                                                \n16 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fThe  project  will  help  strengthen  MID\u2019s  capacity  for  effectively  managing  environmental \n31. \nand social impacts, including (i) training of MID staff and other persons on safeguard activities, \nand  (ii)  international  and  national  consultants  and  staff  in  the  CPIU  to  implement  and  monitor \nthe project's safeguard activities. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32. \nThe  project  has  three  main  risks  that  are  rated  medium  and  considered  manageable, \nand  they  will  be  largely  mitigated  during  implementation.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts \nare  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs  of  the  mitigating  measures.  Major  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.18 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nMore frequent or intense future floods or other \nnatural hazards  \n\nStretched administrative capacity and resources of \nthe government undermine implementation and \neffectiveness of the emergency assistance. \n\nLimited capacity of MID for operations and \nmaintenance jeopardizes the sustainability of the \ninfrastructure. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe project will ensure that infrastructure \ninvestments meet standards for climate and \ndisaster resilience. \nAdding capacity to the MID CPIU will strengthen \nimplementation and coordination capabilities, \nthereby ensuring effective delivery of the \nemergency assistance. \nThrough the institutional strengthening and \ncapacity development component of the TSDP, the \nexecuting agency is improving operations and \nmaintenance capacity; it is also undergoing training \nto improve its abilities for project implementation \nand operation, and asset management, which will \nboost infrastructure sustainability. \n\nCPIU = central project implementation unit, MID = Ministry of Infrastructure Development, TSDP = Transport Sector \nDevelopment Project \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n33. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and financing documents. \n\nThe  government  and  MID  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project, \n\n34. \nwhich are set forth in the financing agreement.  \n\n \n \n \n\n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n35. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR4,289,000  to  Solomon  Islands \nfor  the  Transport  Sector  Flood  Recovery  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  with an  interest  charge at the rate  of  1.0%  per  annum;
