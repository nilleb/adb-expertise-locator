THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan to India for the Strengthening Comprehensive Primary Health Care in Urban Areas \nProgram under Pradhan Mantri Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana. The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction for Strengthening Capacity for Comprehensive Primary Health Care in Urban \nAreas, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, approve the administration of the TA. \n \n2.  The Government of India launched the Ayushman Bharat (the Healthy India Initiative) \nHealth and Wellness Centres (AB-HWC) in 2018 to improve access to comprehensive primary \nhealth care (CPHC) as an important strategy to achieve universal health coverage. In 2020, the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  revealed  gaps  in  the  health  system,  so  the \ngovernment announced the Pradhan Mantri Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana (PM-ASBY) to \nstrengthen public health systems to prepare for future pandemics and other emergencies. The \nproposed results-based lending (RBL) program will assist the government in implementing the \nAB-HWC and the PM-ASBY to strengthen primary health care in the urban areas of 13 selected \nstates, and improve the urban population\u2019s access to quality CPHC services.1 The RBL program \ntarget beneficiaries are more than 256 million urban dwellers, including 51 million urban slum \ndwellers, especially the poor and vulnerable. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  India is one of the fast-growing large economies, with average growth of more than 6.7% \nfrom 2015 to 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic hit India\u2019s economy hard\u2014it contracted 23.9% in \nApril\u2013June 2020 because of the strict lockdown from late March to late May, and is projected to \ncontract 9.0% in FY2021.2 The recovery may take longer if the pandemic is prolonged. About 70 \nmillion people are likely to be pushed into extreme poverty.3 COVID-19 and the associated \nlockdown disrupted many routine and essential health services, undermining progress made on \nseveral health goals, such as maternal and infant health, tuberculosis and malaria treatment, and \nnoncommunicable  diseases  (NCDs).4 The  negative  mental  and  physical  health  impacts  of \nCOVID-19, especially on vulnerable populations such as the urban migrant population and the \nelderly, will require longer-term health system responses. \n \n4.  Current health status. From 1990 to 2017, India has seen substantial improvements in \nbasic health indicators: life expectancy increased by 8.9 years to 67.8 for men and by 9.8 years \nto 70.2 for women. Maternal deaths per 100,000 live births declined from 408 to 160 in the same \nperiod. The greatest achievement has been the reduction of under-five mortality\u2014from 111 to \n42 deaths per 1,000 live births. Tuberculosis declined by 29% and malaria incidence fell by 76%.5 \n \n1  Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, \nRajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal were selected based on the size of their urban and slum \npopulations as well as the growth rate of the urban population, the overall health system performance ranking by \nNITI Aayog (for a mix of well-performing and less well-performing states), previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nsupport in urban health, and ADB\u2019s urban development sector support. \n2  ADB. 2020.

Health-Related SDGs (accessed 23 April 2020). \n ", "2 \nDespite these achievements, India still accounts for 27% of TB and 4% of malaria cases in the \nworld,6 and has the third largest number of people living with HIV. It also faces the spread of \nvector-borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.7 For COVID-19, India has reported \nmore than 8.2 million confirmed cases, the second highest number after the United States as of \n2 November 2020.8 Despite the countrywide lockdown for more than 50 days from 25 March 2020 \nand increased testing capacity (more than 1.5 million samples per day) to detect and isolate cases, \nCOVID-19 cases are still increasing at an alarming rate. In addition, the demographic transition \ncaused by increased life expectancy and changing lifestyles from rapid urbanization have led to \na rise in NCDs. Cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes are major NCDs in \nIndia that kill about 4 million Indians annually, and most of these deaths are premature.9 This \nepidemiological transition leads to more NCD patients with disabilities, which poses a heavy \nfinancial burden on the health system and affected households. Given the ongoing COVID-19 \npandemic, people with underlying conditions, particularly NCDs, are also at increased risk of \nmortality during hospitalization.  \n \n5.  Urban health issues. In 2018, 461 million people or one-third of the Indian population \nwere living in cities, which is the second largest urban population in the world.10 The urban \npopulation is growing rapidly, and by 2050 will reach 877 million\u2014almost two-thirds of India\u2019s \npopulation.11 Urban populations grew faster than most cities\u2019 capacity to provide basic social \nservices for all. Despite the common perception of easier access to health services in urban areas \nbecause of the large presence of private sector providers, health indicators of the urban poor are \noften comparable to or worse than those of the rural population. Full immunization among children \naged 12\u201323 months is 57.7% for the urban poor compared with 61.3% for the rural population. \nAnemic children comprise 62.7% of the urban poor compared with 59.5% of the rural population. \nMost urban poor women do not seek preventive health measures: among urban poor women \naged 15\u201349 years, only 20.0% have undergone cervical examinations, 9.3% have had breast \nexaminations, and 10.3% have received oral cavity examinations.12 The NCD burden is higher in \nurban areas, and the urban poor are particularly vulnerable to communicable and vector-borne \ndiseases because of congested and poor living and health conditions. The risk of the spread of \nCOVID-19 is 1.09 times higher in urban areas and 1.89 times higher in urban slums compared \nwith rural areas based on the results of the first sero-survey conducted nationwide.13 More than \none-third (35%) of all COVID-19 cases in India are concentrated in 20 cities or districts.14 \n \n6.  Supply and demand constraints in urban primary health care. Private health providers \ndominate in urban areas. However, a large number of urban poor cannot access these services \nbecause of the possibility of incurring high out-of-pocket expenditures. Drugs and diagnostic \nservices make up 75% of out-of-pocket expenditures, which could be avoided if services were \n \n6  The Global Fund. 2019. Country Impact Report: India. Geneva. \n7  O.

However, it is limited to secondary and tertiary care, which treat more severe conditions \nthat require specialized knowledge and more intensive health monitoring. The public sector is \nalso far less expensive and caters to vulnerable population groups.16 In addition to the cost of \nhealth services, especially in the private sector, the poor and vulnerable population\u2019s access to \nprimary health care in urban areas is hampered by the poor quality of available services, poor \nhealth-seeking behaviors, lack of information and awareness of health care options, constraints \nsuch as working hours, mobility, and other physical and social barriers. Women\u2019s access to \nprimary health care is inadequate because of lack of empowerment and financial barriers: 63% \nof married women cannot take decisions related to their own health, and only 57% of women in \nurban areas can freely visit a health facility alone.17 Further, limited availability of female doctors \n(17% of doctors) hinders women from seeking care.18 \n \n7.  Achievements and remaining gaps in urban public primary health care system. To \naddress the large gaps in urban primary health care, especially for the poor and vulnerable \npopulations, the government launched the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) in 2013 as part \nof the National Health Mission (NHM). By 2019, the NUHM had established more than 4,500 \nfunctional urban primary health centers (UPHCs) across India, significantly improving the urban \npopulation\u2019s access to maternal and child health care; and implemented key mechanisms for \nurban health system governance and management.19 UPHCs have also played a crucial role in \nthe COVID-19 response through surveillance, contact tracing, and test referrals. Overall, primary \nhealth care in India prioritizes a narrow range of services such as reproductive and child health \nservices and selected communicable diseases. Currently, even a well-functioning primary health \ncenter provides limited services that cater to less than 15% of all morbidities for which people \nseek health care.20 For other morbidities, people use local private care providers, distant and \ncrowded district hospitals, or government medical college hospitals. Investment in primary health \ncare  is  cost-effective  and  can  reduce  overall  health  costs.21 The  public  sector  has  also \ncollaborated with the private sector in selected aspects of primary health care delivery, such as \ncontracting in of specialist services, mobile medical units for improved outreach, and biomedical \nwaste management. To strengthen private sector engagement, some states have contracted out \nthe entire management and service provision of primary health service centers to the private \nsector, usually nonprofit entities. The UPHCs need further improvement in infrastructure, human \nresources, and the availability of diagnostics and drugs. Outreach services also face challenges\u2014\nfrom a high attrition rate of community health workers, inadequate community organizations, \nunreached pockets of vulnerable populations, and poor health-seeking behavior of the urban poor. \nGaps in the health system have become even more apparent during the pandemic, where \nsignificantly underfunded and patchy public health systems, coupled with large variations in \n \n15 National Health System Resource Center. 2012.

The National Health Policy (2017) emphasized CPHC as an \nimportant strategy to achieve universal health coverage and committed two-thirds of the health \nbudget to primary health care.23 In addition to the services already provided, CPHC includes \npreventive,  promotive,  curative,  rehabilitative,  and  palliative  care.  In  February  2018,  the \ngovernment announced a plan to develop 150,000 HWCs in rural and urban areas by mainly \ntransforming  existing  primary  health  centers  into  HWCs  under  AB-HWC  as  a  vehicle  to \noperationalize CPHC. HWCs will offer a range of services including reproductive, maternal, \nneonatal, and child health care; adolescent care; the management of national communicable \ndisease programs; general outpatient and minor ailments care; screening, prevention, control, \nand management of NCDs; common ophthalmic, ear, nose, and throat care; basic oral health \ncare; elderly and palliative care; emergency medical services, including burns and trauma; and \nscreening and basic management of mental health illnesses. \n \n9.  In March 2020, the government announced the $2 billion COVID-19 Response and Health \nSystems  Preparedness  Project  to  carry  out  immediate  emergency  responses  through  the \nprovision of personal protective equipment, enhanced surveillance, improved health facilities, \ntraining of health workers, testing and tracking for the containment of COVID-19, and other \nnational  and  state  health  system  strengthening  efforts.24 The  continued  pandemic  led  the \ngovernment to take a longer-term approach to system strengthening. It launched the PM-ASBY \nin May 2020 to develop the capacity of health systems and institutions across the continuum of \ncare (primary, secondary, and tertiary levels) to respond effectively to the current pandemic while \nbuilding resilience for future emergencies. The PM-ASBY will be implemented from FY2021 to \nFY2026 and will cover (i) continued COVID-19 emergency responses, (ii) strengthening public \nhealth infrastructure for pandemic preparedness, and (iii) strengthening national systems for \npandemic and health emergencies.25 Under the PM-ASBY, an additional 10,380 urban HWCs will \nbe established across India; and about 20% of existing UPHCs will become polyclinics offering \nspecialist services, to augment AB-HWC toward CPHC. Several development partners, including \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), have supported the COVID-19 response project and will \nsupport the government in the PM-ASBY implementation, contributing to a common results \nframework under the coordination of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW). \n \n \n22 P.

In addition, the scheme has specific support \nto national systems, which include several key elements such as biosecurity preparedness and research (the One \nHealth Initiative), the national digital health mission, strengthening ports of entry, health emergency operation centers \nand mobile hospitals, surveillance of infectious diseases and outbreak response, and critical care hospital blocks in \ncentral hospitals. The government has requested ADB to support the PM-ASBY with $1 billion, which would be \nprocessed in four phases. The proposed RBL is the first phase, focusing on urban health. \n ", "5 \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n10.  Strategic alignment. The RBL program will assist the MOHFW in implementing the          \nAB-HWC and the PM-ASBY to achieve the goal of CPHC in urban areas by improving equitable \naccess to quality primary health services among the urban population. It is aligned with the country \npartnership strategy pillar 2: providing inclusive access to social services by providing better \nservices for the urban poor.26 It also aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities: \n(i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality, (iii) making cities more livable, and (iv) strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity. The program is included in ADB\u2019s India country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023.27 \n \n11.  Lessons. ADB has supported the NUHM since 2015 and recently provided support for \nIndia\u2019s COVID-19 response.28 The lessons from the NUHM support, according to the Independent \nEvaluation Department, include the following: (i) outcome-level disbursement-linked indicators \n(DLIs) need to be within the direct control of the program, (ii) meaningful gender targets should \nbe set, and (iii) independent verification should be used.29 The RBL program will incorporate \nlessons from the NUHM implementation and the COVID-19 response, such as (i) capacity building \nof  lower  performing  states  through  cross-learning  and  need-based  programs  rather  than \nspreading efforts thinly over the country; (ii) strengthening state-level planning for CPHC by \nclosely involving state and substate administrators for convergence with other urban services, \nespecially leveraging the experience of the COVID-19 response where a whole-of-government \napproach has been adopted; (iii) continuously fostering innovations and partnerships with the \nprivate  sector  through  DLIs;  (iv) strengthening  outreach  services  for  unreached  pockets  of \nvulnerable populations; and (v) leveraging information technology for evidence-based planning, \neffective service delivery, safer and more efficient training, and emergency responses. \n \n12.  Results-based  lending.  The  RBL  modality  is  suitable  since  (i)  RBL  incentivizes \nstakeholders to adopt new areas such as NCDs and better client orientation, while strengthening \nexisting systems using robust DLIs for change management and strengthening of systems and \ninstitutions;  (ii)  the  government  programs  have  a  well-defined  scope,  expected  results, \nexpenditure framework, financing plan, and accompanying institutions and systems; (iii) a large \nnumber of HWCs dispersed across several states require support to deliver sector results and \nstrengthen program institutions through a systems-based approach; (iv) strong government \ninterest and ownership is in place; (v) it builds on earlier RBL program implementation experience \nand knowledge of the sector; and (vi) it enhances development coordination and harmonization \namong development partners in the PM-ASBY support. \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s value addition. Only a few development partners have been supporting the urban \nhealth agenda in India, but with COVID-19, more partners are beginning to prioritize urban health \nunder the PM-ASBY. The program will complement the initiatives of the government and other \ndevelopment partners, and will promote synergy among ADB-supported interventions in the \nhealth sector, including the COVID-19 response project (footnote 24).

Program Results \n \n15.  The RBL program\u2019s impact will be universal access to good quality health care services \nachieved (footnote 23). The outcome will be equitable access to quality CPHC services in urban \nareas improved in 13 states (measured by increased utilization of urban HWC [DLI 1], increased \nNCD screening [DLI 2], and increased access of urban women to antenatal care [DLI 3]). The \ntarget beneficiaries will be the urban population of more than 256 million, including the urban slum \npopulation of 51 million and the vulnerable population in the 13 states. Selected DLIs, identified \nunder each output, will exert stakeholder efforts to achieve the outcome indicator.30 The ADB \nfinancing allocation per DLI is in Table 2. \n \n16.  Output 1: Comprehensive primary health care services in urban areas strengthened. \nThe first output covers supply-side interventions to roll out CPHC in urban areas: (i) an increased \nnumber  of  HWCs  that  meet  the  standards  of  CPHC  guidelines  in  urban  areas  (DLI  4);31 \n(ii) increased screening of five key NCDs at the HWCs, aligned with India\u2019s priority to reduce \nNCDs by 25% by 2025 (program action plan [PAP]); (iii) monitoring the availability of essential \nmedicines at urban HWCs (PAP); (iv) strengthening the mechanism for screening and referral of \ninfectious diseases, including COVID-19 suspected cases, to hospitals and laboratories for testing \nand case management (PAP); and (v) increased provision of specialist services through urban \nHWCs to offer the expanded range of services (DLI 5). \n \n17.  Output 2: Support for improved health-seeking behavior increased. The second \noutput will support demand-side interventions such as improving health-seeking behavior in \npatients, patient satisfaction in the HWCs, and the use of primary health care services through \noutreach. The overall objective of this output will be supported through (i) urban HWCs to improve \noutreach services in urban areas using information, education, and communication messages to \npotential patients on health and nutrition (DLI 6[i]); (ii) strengthening frontline workers\u2019 capacity in \nrisk communication and health promotion to enhance communities\u2019 knowledge of preventive \nmeasures and strategies against NCDs, COVID-19, and other communicable diseases (DLI 6[ii]); \nand (iii) an increasing number of urban HWCs capturing patient satisfaction information to reflect \nuser demand in continuous improvement of service delivery (DLI 7). \n \n18.  Output 3: Health systems strengthened. This output will strengthen systemic elements \nfor delivering urban primary health care, including digital tools, quality assurance mechanisms, \nhuman resources, and scalable models to engage the private sector to partner in improving health \noutcomes. It will support (i) the establishment of a technical division for urban health (DLI 8[i]); \n(ii) strengthening of state and substate capacity in urban health planning through convergence \nwith other urban services (DLI 8[ii]); (iii) increased adoption of innovative approaches and best \npractices, including private sector engagement (DLI 8 [iii]); and (iv) strengthening of the quality \nassurance  system  in  HWCs  through  Kayakalp,  a  national  award  scheme  that  promotes \ncleanliness, hygiene, and infection control practices in public health facilities, which are important \ngiven the escalation of the COVID-19 crisis in India (DLI 9). Areas such as technology systems \n \n30 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n31 Well-functioning HWCs require (i) strong institutional capacity for urban health at central, state, and municipal levels; \n(ii) expanded services; (iii) well-maintained infrastructure; (iv) human resources, equipment, diagnostics, and \nmedicine; (v) improved quality of care, including increased accountability, accreditation, and enforcement for quality \nassurance; (vi) effective referral mechanisms for the continuum of care; (vii) detailed and updated patient records; \n(viii) effective community outreach to increase health-seeking behavior; and (ix) robust information technology \nsystems for data analysis and decision support.

The MOHFW will be responsible for monitoring the AB-HWC, the PM-ASBY, and urban \nHWCs. The national program management unit under the MOHFW will provide regular reports on \nRBL program performance. A rigorous and detailed verification protocol has been developed \n(Appendix 3). An independent external verification agency, to be engaged by the MOHFW, will \nconfirm the achievement of targets following the verification protocol. Key prerequisites for \neffective implementation of the RBL program are identified as prior results.32 Prior results will be \nverified by independent technical experts engaged through ADB TA.33 \n \nE.  Expenditure Framework and Financing Plan \n \n20.  Program  expenditures.  The  RBL  program  expenditures  are  estimated  to  be \n$1,128.9 million from FY2021 to FY2024 (Table 3). The expenditures are mostly recurrent, as the \nNUHM  will  support  human  resources,  drugs,  diagnostics,  consumables,  rental,  information \ntechnology systems, and untied grants for utilities and other small expenses in urban HWCs. A \nsmaller capital budget (less than 2%) is allocated to support and/or establish new HWCs by \nrenovating rented spaces and providing the necessary equipment, furniture, and other fixtures. \n \n   \n \n32 These include (i) the approval of the PM-ASBY, including an increased number of and resources for urban HWCs; \n(ii) a guidance note issued on enabling the delivery of essential health services during the COVID-19 outbreak, with \na focus on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health care; (iii) the structure or organogram and \nroles and responsibilities of the technical division for urban health finalized; and (iv) online training for self-\nassessment tools for the quality assurance system made accessible to urban HWCs. \n33 ADB. 2015.

Program financing. The government has requested a regular loan of $300,000,000 from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 20-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the \nstraight-line method, the average maturity is 12.75 years, and there is no maturity premium \npayable  to  ADB.  The  government  may  request  ADB  to  provide  additional  financing  upon \nsatisfactory implementation of the RBL program, to bridge any financing gap from FY2025 to \nFY2026. The financing plan is summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Program Financing Plan, FY2021\u2013FY2024 \nAmount   Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nGovernment of India    377.3  33.4 \nState government    451.6  40.0 \nAsian Development Bank  \n  300.0  26.6 \nOrdinary capital resources (loan) \n    Total    1,128.9  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n22.  Disbursement  arrangements.  Disbursements  will  be  made  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed  between  the  government  and  ADB.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s  consolidated  fund.  A  rigorous  verification  protocol,  including  an  independent \nverification  agency,  has  been  developed.  ADB  disbursement  will  be  made  following  the \nachievement and independent verification of the agreed DLIs. Critical actions that are required to \nachieve subsequent performance targets are identified as prior results (footnote 32). The prior \nresults linked to $60 million are expected to be achieved within 12 months before the loan signing. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n23.  The RBL program has identified areas for institutional capacity and systems strengthening. \nIn addition to the technical and gender actions, several actions are identified to strengthen the \nprogram systems: (i) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) such as further development of the HWC \nportal functions and increasing HWC portal uptake, streamlining the data collection process, and \ntraining for HWC data management; (ii) financial management through gap assessment and \nimprovements in fund flow, accounting, internal control, and financial reporting in selected states; \n(iii) procurement through improved planning and facility level training to prevent drug shortages; \nand (iv) safeguards for improved biomedical waste and infection control management in quality \n ", "10 \nassurance guidelines and regular reporting. These actions are summarized in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1) as well as the PAP.34 \n \nG.  Technical Assistance \n \n24.  To support effective implementation of the RBL program, ADB will provide a TA grant.35 \nThe outputs of the TA are (i) core technical support for program implementation and coordination \nprovided; (ii) strategic capacity building supported in key CPHC areas (e.g., convergence, private \nsector participation, continuum of care, primary health care management, community processes, \nand leveraging information and communication technology); and (iii) innovation and knowledge-\ninto-practice supported. The TA is estimated to cost $2,200,000, of which $2,000,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \nThe government will support the TA in the form of counterpart staff, office and meeting facilities, \noffice supplies, coordination assistance, and other in-kind contributions. The TA duration will be \nJanuary 2021 to December 2023.  \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The RBL program will be implemented following the well-established NHM mechanisms, \nrelying on the urban health program management personnel at state, district, and city levels. The \nMOHFW  will  be  the  executing  agency,  responsible  for  overall  program  implementation, \ncoordinating program activities, and supporting state-level activities, assisted by the existing \nnational  program  management  unit  and  technical  resource  organizations.  The  states  will \nimplement  the  RBL  program  activities  based  on  the  annually  approved  state  program \nimplementation plans. The states will also prepare periodic reports on progress in meeting DLIs \nand the PAP as part of their regular reporting on overall NUHM implementation. The MOHFW will \nconsolidate state-level reports and submit periodic progress reports on the achievement of DLIs \nand  PAP  and  other  key  performance  indicators,  and  prepare  DLI  achievement  reports for \nindependent verification. Once the verification report is submitted by the independent verification \nagency, the MOHFW will submit the withdrawal application for disbursement. \n \n26.  Development coordination. Partners play a key role in supporting the central and state \nlevel implementation of disease control programs and system strengthening efforts. In response \nto  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  government\u2019s  $2  billion  Response  and  Health  Systems \nPreparedness  Project  was  supported  both  financially  and  technically  by  several  partners, \nincluding ADB, the World Bank, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The government\u2019s \nPM-ASBY will require external assistance estimated at $2,930 million for FY2021\u2013FY2026. This \nwill require support from several development partners, including ADB, the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank, the European Investment Bank, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nand the World Bank. Partners will contribute toward a common results framework under the \nMOHFW\u2019s  coordination to  define the  scope,  expected  results,  expenditure framework,  and \nfinancing  plan  of  the  proposed  interventions.  In  addition,  for  effective  coordination  of \nimplementation  issues  and  TA  needs,  an  informal  platform  hosted  by  the  World  Health \nOrganization  provides  the  opportunity  to  share  information  and  lessons.  ADB,  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, the Government of Norway, the United Nations Population \nFund, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank \nparticipate in the bimonthly meetings of this group. \n \n \n34 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n27.  The RBL program\u2019s soundness was assessed based on its relevance and adequacy. The \nprogram is highly relevant to India\u2019s universal health coverage agenda as well as sustainable and \ninclusive urban development. It will improve the health and well-being of the urban population, \nespecially the poor and the vulnerable, providing equitable access to a wider range of quality \nhealth services. The constraints on the cost-effectiveness of primary health care, disproportionate \nbenefits to the poor and vulnerable from free services, and health emergency preparedness, \njustify public provision of essential health services. In addition, the RBL program aims to facilitate \npartnerships with private health service providers to improve service coverage and availability, \nand to ensure speedy expansion leveraging the large private sector presence in urban areas. The \nRBL program will strengthen convergence with other urban services, building on the experience \nof India\u2019s COVID-19 response. \n \n28.  The RBL program design and implementation arrangements are sound, building on NHM \nmechanisms and previous RBL program experience. The results framework is well designed, \nfollowing a health systems approach. The DLIs are critical indicators for achieving overall program \nresults, sequenced to incentivize good performance. The expenditure framework and financing \nplan are robust. The sustainability of the results will be ensured through gender-responsive \ninstitutional capacity development and the development of a state-level road map for CPHC. The \neconomic  analysis  shows  that  the  positive  effects  of  reduced  out-of-pocket  expenses  and \nincreased productivity outweigh the program\u2019s economic costs. The estimated economic rate of \nreturn of 13.1% indicates that the program is economically viable. \n \n29.  The RBL program is categorized gender equity as a theme. It has a strong gender and \npro-poor focus. In addition to a wider range of services made available for the urban poor, the \nRBL program includes DLIs for improved outreach services and frontline health workers\u2019 capacity \nto support and facilitate access to services and health-seeking behaviors among the poor and the \nvulnerable, especially women and girls in urban areas. The RBL program includes specific actions \nand targets that will benefit women, such as (i) HWCs offering screening for cervical cancer and \nbreast cancer (PAP); (ii) outreach services that address gender-based violence issues (DLI 6[i]); \n(iii) employment for 40% women at the new urban health technical division (DLI 8 [i]); and (iv) a \nsection on gender-responsive service provision in the revised CPHC guidelines, as well as state \nroad maps for CPHC in urban areas (DLI 8 [i] and [ii]). Accredited social health activists and \nMahila Arogya Samitis (community women\u2019s groups), who are 90% women, will also benefit from \nthe trainings on infectious disease response. The expanded service package includes mental \nhealth screening and support, which will be important to address the psychological impact of a \nprolonged COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent socioeconomic hardships. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n30.  Monitoring and evaluation systems. The RBL program\u2019s M&E processes across central, \nstate, district, and facility levels are well defined, functional, and sufficiently robust for tracking the \nprogram outcomes and outputs, which are a subset of the PM-ASBY\u2019s common results framework. \nThe RBL program\u2019s M&E system for periodic review, supervision, and monitoring is largely based \non the HWC portal, an information system developed in 2019 and maintained by the National \nHealth Systems Resource Centre at MOHFW. The HWC portal is being used by HWCs and NHM \nstate and city program managers, and is complemented by other information systems developed \nunder the NHM, such as the health management information system, quarterly progress reports, \n ", "12 \ncommon review missions, the Integrated Health Information Platform, information from accredited \nsocial health activists, and the quality improvement micro-site. Areas for further strengthening \ninclude (i) enhancing state-level reporting in the HWC portal, (ii) streamlining data entry processes \nor mechanisms across multiple information systems to increase efficiency, and (iii) developing the \ncapacity of data entry operators and management information system officers. \n \n31.  Fiduciary systems. The financial management, procurement, and anticorruption systems \nassessments confirm that the existing program systems are adequate for the RBL program with \nsome risk mitigation measures.36 The overall financial management risk is substantial. Areas for \nimprovement include: (i) the NUHM financial management framework is not consistently applied \nby all states; (ii) states have varying levels of staff capacity and apply different fund flow models, \naccounting systems, and processes; and (iii) recurring control issues and audit observations are \nnot systematically followed up and addressed. ADB will support the Financial Management Group \nunder the MOHFW and the states to address these issues. The PAP includes the following \nmeasures: (i) the MOFHW conduct assessment of practices and gaps in bookkeeping, accounts \nstaffing, reporting, management and flow of funds, and tracking or follow-up of audit observations \nto identify good practices and deliver training and capacity building in financial management; and \n(ii) the MOHFW will submit 6-monthly financial management progress reports to ADB. \n \n32.  The RBL program procurement includes drugs, consumables, furniture, and equipment \nfor  HWCs,  consulting,  and  other  services  required  for  the  CPHC  rollout.  The  program \nprocurement system has improved since the inception of the NUHM in 2013, especially with the \nrollout  of  e-procurement  nationwide.  The  overall  procurement  risk  is  moderate.  Areas  for \nimprovement in some states include (i) the availability of adequately trained staff, (ii) effective \nprocurement planning to avoid delays, and (iii) supply management to ensure the availability of \nessential drugs. These areas will be supported by (i) procurement training, assisted by ADB\u2019s \nCapacity Development Resource Center, with online modules; and (ii) capacity building for \ntracking  drug  stocks  at  the  facility  level.  The  RBL  program  will  strengthen  the  continued \nimplementation  of  the  NHM  Governance  and  Accountability  Framework,  grievance  redress \nmechanism, and community processes in service delivery monitoring. The Guidelines to Prevent \nor Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities in Results-Based Lending for \nPrograms were explained to and discussed with the government and the MOHFW.37 \n \n33.  Safeguard systems. The RBL program\u2019s overall safeguard risk is moderate based on the \ninitial safeguards screening. The program is category B for the environment and category C for \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Urban HWCs will be established by refurbishing \nexisting  centers  and  rented  spaces  in  existing  buildings,  so  no  new  construction  or  land \nacquisition is envisaged. The potential environmental impacts include biomedical waste and \ninfection risks during operation. An assessment of the program safeguard systems has been \ncarried out to examine the program\u2019s environmental safeguard frameworks and practices against \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) principles. The assessment found that a wide range of \nrelevant policies, laws, and regulations are in place. Due diligence confirms that the program \nfaces no known programmatic, contextual, or institutional risks. The existing mechanisms in \nbiomedical waste management and health and safety measures are adequate to mitigate the \nprogram\u2019s environmental impacts. PAP will strengthen the existing mechanisms to guide urban-\nspecific practices and enhanced health and safety measures against COVID-19 and future \n \n36 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities in Results-Based Lending for \nPrograms in Appendix 5 of the Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "13 \npandemics (footnote 34).
