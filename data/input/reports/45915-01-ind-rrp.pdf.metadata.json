RPL is looking to reduce its dependency on fossil fuel resources \nand develop a renewable energy portfolio of wind and solar power assets. Solar energy is one \nof  the  focus  areas  for  RPL  as  recent  regulatory  initiatives  (such  as  mandatory  renewable \npurchase  obligations  and  revised  tariff  guidelines)  have  improved  the  viability  of  solar  power \nprojects  in  India.  The  Dahanu  Solar  Power  Project  will  be  the  first  solar  power  project  to  be \ndeveloped by RPL and will be the largest solar photovoltaic plant in India. \n \n3. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  was  approached  by  RPL  in  July  2011  to  help \nfinance  the  project.  From  initial  discussions,  ADB  viewed  that  the  project  possessed  sound \nfundamentals  in  various  aspects  including  the  financial  strength  of  the  sponsor,  high-quality \nproject  preparatory  work,  and  attractive  offtake  tariff.  In  addition,  with  its  direct  purchase  of \nrenewable energy by a private utility company to satisfy its renewable purchase obligations, the \nproject  promotes  a  sustainable  market  platform  for  the  development  of  renewable  energy  in \nIndia  and  endorses  the  recent  regulatory  reform  in  solar  energy.  The  project  will  strongly \ncomplement ADB\u2019s ongoing initiatives in solar energy in India. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design  \n\nThe  project  entails  the  construction  of  a  40-megawatt  (MW)  solar  photovoltaic  power \n4. \ngeneration plant near the village of Dhursar in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan state. The project \nsite is 180 kilometers (km) west of the city of Jodhpur and 10 km from the Jodhpur\u2013Jaisalmer \nnational  highway  (NH-114).  The  annual  global  horizontal  irradiance 2  at  the  project  site  is \nestimated to be 2,064 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter, one of the highest in the country. \n \n5. \nThe  project  will  use  fixed-tilt  cadmium  telluride  thin  film  solar  photovoltaic  modules. \nCadmium telluride technology is suited to warm and dry environment such as Rajasthan where \nambient air temperatures can exceed 40\uf0b0C in summer, which can reduce the net energy yield of \nthe modules. The solar photovoltaic modules have a projected degradation of 1.0% per year for \nthe first 10 years of operation and 0.6% per year for the next 15 years of operations. \n \nThe electricity generated from the project will be evacuated from the project site to the \n6. \nexisting  220-kilovolt  (kV)  Dechu  substation  of  Rajasthan  Vidyut  Prasaran  Nigam  Limited \n(RVPNL) through a 30 km long, 220 kV double-circuit transmission line to be built by DSPPL. \n\n                                                 \n1   National Stock Exchange, 14 September 2011. \n2   Measure  of  intensity  and  availability  of  sunlight  in  a  given  location,  which  can  be  converted  to  electricity  either \n\nthrough photovoltaic solar panels or concentrating solar thermal power technology. \n\n\f 2\n\nThe  transmission  line  has  been  sized  to  evacuate  additional  phases  of  DSPPL\u2019s  solar \nphotovoltaic project. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsor \n\n7. \nThe borrower, DSPPL, is a special purpose vehicle set up by RPL exclusively to develop \nthe project. DSPPL is a 100% subsidiary of RPL. RPL is a listed group company of the Reliance \nAnil  Dhirubhai  Ambani  Group  (Reliance  ADA  Group),  established  to  develop,  construct,  and \noperate power projects in India and abroad. The Reliance ADA Group is one of India\u2019s largest \nconglomerates  with  a  strong  presence  in  telecommunications,  media  and  entertainment, \nfinancial services, infrastructure, and energy. \n \nRPL  has  a  portfolio  of  33,440  MW  of  power  generation  capacity  in  various  stages  of \n8. \ndevelopment. The operational portfolio is 600 MW while 15,060 MW is under construction and \n17,780  MW  is  under  development.  Coal-fired  power  plants  (including  the  three  ultra-mega \npower projects\u2014Sasan, Tilaya, and Krishnapatnam) account for 61% of the total portfolio, gas-\nfired plants comprise 25%, and hydropower plants represent 14%. The  proposed project is its \nfirst solar energy project.

The development impact of the \nproject also includes environmental benefits through more efficient use of indigenous renewable \nenergy  resources  with  almost  no  emission  of  pollutants  or  greenhouse  gases.  In  addition,  the \nbuilding of the project will help prove the feasibility of utility-scale solar power projects in India \nand  the  operational  performance  in  a  location  (Rajasthan)  where  substantial  development  in \nsolar power is planned during 2012\u20132017. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   RPL. 2011. Audited Financial Results for the Year Ended March 31, 2011. Mumbai. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n12. \nThe project will demonstrate the profitability and sustainability of utility-scale private solar \npower  generation  in  India  by  generating  56,160  megawatt-hours  (MWh)4 of  clean  energy  per \nannum while delivering adequate returns for the private sponsor. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n  Successful implementation of the project will result in the construction and operation of \n13.  \nIndia\u2019s  first  utility-scale  solar  photovoltaic  power  plant  and  increase  solar  power  generation \ncapacity in the country by 40 MW. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations   \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nThe  project  supports  two  of  the  five  core  operational  areas  of  Strategy  2020\u2014\n14. \ninfrastructure  and  environment. 5  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  India  country  partnership \nstrategy  (CPS),  2009\u20132012.  One of  the  four strategy  pillars  of  the  CPS  is  to support  inclusive \nand environmentally sustainable growth through continued focus on infrastructure development \nand  enhanced  focus  on  renewable  energy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  one  key  outcome \nindicator  of  the  CPS,  which  targets  an  addition  of  at  least  70  MW  of  solar  power  generation \nthrough ADB assistance by 2012.6  \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Energy Policy and the Asia Solar Energy Initiative \n\n15. \nUnder  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  ADB\u2019s  investments  will  focus  on  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable  energy  projects,  as  well  as  expansion  of  energy  access.  The  policy  states  that \nsupport  for  renewable  energy  projects  will  be  prioritized  and  broadened,  with  an  objective  to \ncreate a framework that makes investing in renewable energy commercially viable. The policy \nenvisages that in the process of facilitating private investments in renewable energy, ADB  will \nassume  greater  (but  thoroughly  assessed)  risks  and  act  as  a catalyst for  investments  that  the \nprivate sector might not otherwise be willing to make.7 \n \n16. \nThe project is also directly aligned with ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative, which aims to \n(i)  facilitate  knowledge  sharing  and  transfer  for  solar  power;  (ii)  help  develop,  finance,  and \ncommission  3,000  MW  of  solar  power  generation  capacity  in  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs)  by  May  2013;  and  (iii)  pilot  test  innovative  financing  mechanisms  and  risk  mitigation \nmeasures specifically for solar power. The initiative seeks to stimulate solar power development \nin DMCs with the goal of (i) increasing economies of scale to reduce costs and improve solar \nenergy\u2019s competitiveness within the grid; (ii) exploiting select DMCs\u2019 solar radiation resources to \nserve their fast-growing electricity demand and utilize their greater availability of land compared \nwith  most  developed  countries;  and  (iii)  promoting  DMCs\u2019  potential  to  become  global  and \nregional manufacturing hubs for solar technology goods and equipment. \n \n\n                                                 \n4  Average energy production per annum over the life of the project. \n5  ADB.  2008.

In \nApril  2011,  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  Solar  Power  Generation  Guarantee \nFacility,  which  will  issue  partial  credit  guarantees  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  up  to \n$150 million (or its equivalent in Indian rupees or other foreign currency acceptable to ADB), in \nfavor of foreign and local commercial financial institutions (partner commercial banks) lending to \nsolar  power  generation  projects  in  India.  The  facility  will  support  multiple  solar  generation \nprojects up to a maximum capacity of 25 MW under a solar power program with the central or \nstate governments. This facility will catalyze commercial lending and private investment for the \nsmaller solar generation projects, while the proposed project aims to catalyze private investment \nin  larger  solar  generation  projects  with  a  capacity  greater  than  25  MW.  This  highlights  ADB\u2019s \nmultiproduct approach to promote private investment in solar energy and its ability to customize \nbased on market needs and associated risks.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $147.5 million. \n\n18. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.8 \n\n19. \n \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements\nThe Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission has specified that all \ndistribution licensees in Maharashtra state will have to purchase 0.25% of their \ntotal electricity requirements from solar energy sources from FY2011 to FY2013. \nThis renewable purchase obligation increases to 0.50% beginning FY2014. \n\nImplementation period \n\nThe construction period is from September 2011 to March 2012. The term of the \nenergy purchase agreement is 25 years from COD. \n\nConstruction arrangements \n\nEngineering, procurement, \nand construction  \n\n \nOn the basis of international competitive bidding, DSPPL has entered into a fixed \nprice turnkey EPC contract with R-Infra for (i) procurement and supply of foreign \nand domestic equipment; and (ii) erection, construction, and services for the \nproject.  \n\nEquipment supplier \n\nUnder the EPC contract, R-Infra will source the cadmium telluride solar \nphotovoltaic modules from First Solar (USA).  \n\nOperations arrangements \n\nRevenue structure \n\n  \nDSPPL has entered into an energy purchase agreement with R-Infra to sell 100% \nof the output of the project for a period of 25 years at a fixed tariff as specified by \nthe CERC RE Tariff guidelines 2009.  \n\nR-Infra distributes electricity to 2.8 million retail, commercial, and industrial \nconsumers in Mumbai. The electricity purchased from the project will be used by   \nR-Infra to offset its renewable purchase obligations stipulated by the Maharashtra \nElectricity Regulatory Commission. \n\nOperation and maintenance \n\n \n\n                                                 \n8   Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nAspects \n\nArrangements\nDSPPL will enter into a suitable agreement for O&M of the plant. \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nKey performance indicators will be reported by DSPPL and monitored by ADB and \nthe Export\u2013Import Bank of the United States. In addition, during the construction \nphase, ADB will appoint an independent lenders technical advisor to monitor \nprogress, attend performance testing, and certify COD. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COD = commercial operations date, DSPPL = Dahanu Solar Power Private Limited, \nEPC = engineering, procurement, and construction, FY = fiscal  year, km = kilometer, kV = kilovolt, kWh = kilowatt-\nhour, O&M = operation and maintenance, R-Infra = Reliance Infrastructure Limited, USA = United States of America. \nSource: Dahanu Solar Power Private Limited. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nThe project is financially viable and is economically sustainable as the economic internal \n\n20.  \nrate of return is higher than the social discount rate. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n21. \nThe proposed ADB loan of up to $48 million to DSPPL to finance the construction of the \nDahanu  Solar  Power  Project  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  without \ngovernment guarantee. The ADB loan will have a tenor of up to 17.5 years, including a grace \nperiod of up to 12 months and will be repaid semiannually. The ADB loan will carry an interest \nrate as well as other fees as approved by ADB\u2019s investment committee. \n   \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n22. \n\nThe proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i) \n\nThe  project  will  promote  the  efficient  use  of  a  relatively  untapped,  indigenous \nenergy  resource  resulting  in  low-cost,  carbon-efficient  electricity  generation. \nOnce  commissioned,  the  project  will  be  the  largest  solar  photovoltaic  project  in \nIndia. \nThe proposed ADB assistance will provide long-term, limited recourse financing, \nwhich is not readily available for large solar power generation projects in India. \nADB  participation  in  the  project  will  help  promote  global  standards  for  project \ndevelopment  and  due  diligence  in  a  nascent  sector,  thus  enabling  long-term \ncommercial financing for future solar power generation projects in India. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\n23. \nTariff  reset  risk.  The  tariff  is  established  in  the  energy  purchase  agreement  in \naccordance with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) renewable energy tariff \nregulations  of  2009,  which  are  in  effect  until  31  March  2012.  In  case  COD  is  delayed  beyond \n31 March  2012,  the  tariff  will  be  determined  by  the  new  order  passed by  the  CERC  to  extend \nthe  tariff  regulations  beyond  31  March  2012.  A  lower  tariff  will  reduce  cash  flows  from  the \nproject.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\n \n\n\f 6\n\n \n24. \nTechnology  risk.  Cadmium  telluride  is  a  proven  technology  that  has  been  in \ncommercial  operation  globally  since  2002.  However,  its  long  term  reliability  has  not  yet  been \nproven  and  the  data  evidencing  long  term  degradation  in  performance  is  limited.  Unique  local \nconditions  such  as  high  ambient  air  temperatures  and  high  levels  of  dust  and  soiling  could \nimpair  module  performance.  The  performance  warranties  provided  by  First  Solar  and \nconservative  forecast  of  energy  yields  mitigate  this  risk.  The  financial  analysis  has  factored  in \nthe loss in performance caused by high temperatures, soiling, and other factors. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n25. \nForeign  exchange  risk.  The  ADB  loan  will  be  denominated  in  US  dollars,  but  the \nproject  revenues  will  be  in  Indian  rupees.  The  loan  documentation  will  specify  hedging \nstrategies to mitigate this risk. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n26. \nInterconnection risk. DSPPL is responsible for constructing the 30 km, 220 kV double-\ncircuit transmission line from the project site to the Dechu substation of RVPNL. DSPPL is in the \nprocess  of  signing  a  grid  connectivity  agreement  with  RVPNL.  A  delay  in  construction  of  the \ntransmission  lines  will  result  in  loss  of  revenue  for  the  project.  ADB  will  closely  monitor  the \ntransmission line construction progress during the implementation period. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n27. \nOperation and maintenance risk. O&M for a solar photovoltaic plant is primarily limited \nto  ensuring  adequate  cleaning  of  the  panels  and  replacement  of  inverter  components  after \n10 years.  Therefore,  the  O&M  risk  is  not  considered  to  be  significant.  After  5  years,  the  O&M \nactivities will be undertaken in-house by DSPPL. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE  \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \n\nThe  project  is  classified  under  category  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary \n28. \nresettlement,  and  category  C  for  indigenous  people  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n2009.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  risks  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts and to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy 2001 are incorporated \nin  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  DSPPL  to \nmanage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  risks  are  deemed  adequate.  Information \ndisclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements.9 DSPPL will ensure that the project is in compliance with applicable national laws \nand  regulations  and  will  establish  and  maintain  appropriate  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards arrangements to manage impacts and risks, all in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement 2009 and Social Protection Strategy 2001. \n\n                                                 \n9   Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n29.  \nThe  project  will  be  constructed  on  vacant  and  barren  public  land.  The  findings  of  the \nSocial Safeguards Compliance Audit show that there are no permanent or temporary dwellings \nor cultivation at the site. Initial survey of the 30 km transmission line right of way indicates that it \nwill pass through vacant public and private lands characterized predominantly by sandy dunes, \nlight vegetation and barren land. The route and location of the transmission towers has not been \nfinalized. Hence the project has been conservatively classified under category B for involuntary \nresettlement  and  a  Resettlement  Framework  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements. \n \n30.   Environmental impacts during construction such as dust and noise from transportation of \nmaterials  and  construction  camps  are  likely  to  be  short  term  and  limited  to  the  project  site. \nImpacts  during  operations  are  expected  to  be  minor  and  limited  to  soil  quality,  ecology  and \noccupational  health  hazards.  Impacts  during  decommissioning  due  to  the  dismantling  of  the \nsolar  modules  will  be  addressed  by  collection  and  recycling  of  the  solar  modules  by  the \nequipment supplier. \n \n31.   DSPPL  and  its  contractors  will  enter  into  covenants  in  relation  to  core  labor  standards \nand  formulate  a  corporate  human  resources  policy  embodying  this.  Compliance  with  such \ncovenants  will  be  monitored  by  DSPPL  and  included  in  the  regular  reporting.  DSPPL  has \nconducted consultations with various stakeholders including local villagers, village heads, non-\ngovernment  organizations,  and  state  officials.  During  project  construction  and  the  operations \nphase,  DSPPL  will  continue  such  consultations  and  promote  women\u2019s  participation  in \ncommunity development programs, which the project will jointly implement with the community \nas part of DSPPL\u2019s corporate social responsibility initiative. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nDSPPL has been advised of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and its policy of implementing \n32. \ninternational best practices relating to the combating of money laundering and the financing of \nterrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  loan  documentation  includes  appropriate  anticorruption \nprovisions and remedies for ADB in the event of non-compliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  country,  industry,  group,  and  single  project  exposure \n\n33. \nlimits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n34. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  of  India  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nassistance  to  DSPPL.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  assistance  by  the  Board  of \nDirectors. \n \n\n
