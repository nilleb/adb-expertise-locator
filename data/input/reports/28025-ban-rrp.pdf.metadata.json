THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on two proposed\nloans to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Dhaka Power System Upgrade Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The Bangladesh  power  sector performed  poorly  through  the  late  1980s,  and  early\n1990s. The major sector constraints were (i) lack of institutional capability; (ii) unavailability of\nlong-term domestic capital for financing investments; (iii) limited foreign exchange debt service\ncapability of the economy; (iv) poor management systems and procedures; (v) low employee\ncommitment;  and  (vi)  institutional  weaknesses  in  banking,  law  enforcement,  and  judicial\nprocesses, which are external to the sector but are essential for its proper functioning.\n3.  In 1994, the Government of Bangladesh (the Government) adopted a paper titled\n\"Power Sector Reforms in Bangladesh\" (PSRB) which was formulated in consultation with the\nmajor power sector funding agencies1. The PSRB outlines the reform process proposed to be\nfollowed by the Government to gradually remove sector constraints by improving sector and\ncorporate  governance,  introducing  competition  and  facilitating  public-private  partnerships.\nReform of the external environment was to be introduced through targeted interventions in the\npower sector.\n4. In accordance with the PSRB, the power sector in Bangladesh has been undergoing a\ngradual structural change. The funding agencies have been supporting this change through\ntechnical assistance (TA) for planning and institutional strengthening, as well as capital for\nsystem expansion, in line with the principle of reform-linked assistance. The proposed Project,\nwhich is the third assistance provided by ADB in support of the reform process, is a part of\nADB\u2019s 1999 country assistance program for Bangladesh. The Project is an integral part of the\nleast-cost  development  plan  for  the  power  sector,  and  is  accorded  high  priority  by  the\nGovernment. The Project was appraised in May 1999.2   Appendix 1 provides the project\nframework.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n5. The power sector is organized under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. The\nGovernment,  through  the  Ministry,  wholly  owns  and supervises  the  Bangladesh  Power\nDevelopment Board (BPDB), Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority (DESA), and Rural Electrification\nBoard (REB), which are its three executing agencies (EAs) in the sector. Until FY1998, BPDB was\nresponsible for all generation and most of the transmission in the country, and also for distribution\nin district towns, municipalities, and some rural areas, while DESA was responsible for distribution\nin Dhaka, the capital. Electricity distribution in most of the rural areas is the responsibility of the\n54 rural electric cooperatives, the Palli Bidyut Samities (PBSs), which are organized, initially\n                                               \n1  The ADB, World Bank, Department For International Development of the United Kingdom, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr\nWiederaufbau of Germany, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (now the Japan  Bank for\nInternational Cooperation), and the United States Agency for International Development. The ADB is the aid\ncoordinator to the power sector and has played a major role in drawing up the reform assistance strategy of the\nfunding agencies.\n2  The Appraisal Mission comprised S. Chander, Mission Leader and Senior Project Engineer; S. Bajpai, Senior\nPrograms Officer; S. Nanwani, Senior Counsel; E. Ouano, Senior Environmental Specialist; K. Moktan, Senior\nFinancial Analyst; S. Ahmed, Senior Project Officer; D. Graczyk, Project Economist; and P. B. Song, Project\nEngineer.", "2\nfunded, and monitored by REB. Recently, as part of the sector reform process, new public sector\nentities such as the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Ltd. (PGCB) and the Dhaka Electric\nSupply Company Ltd. (DESCO), as well as private sector independent power producers (IPPs)\nsuch as the Rural Power Company Ltd. (RPC),3 the Meghnaghat AES Power Company Ltd. and\nthe Haripur AES Power Company Ltd., have been constituted. It is expected that over the next\nfew years these companies will own and operate a substantial part of the power sector\u2019s\ngenerating assets. The Government, BPDB, DESA, and REB have taken steps to involve the\nprivate  sector  by  (i) adopting  a  private  power  generation  policy  in  October  1996;  and  (ii)\nawarding contracts for about 1,400 megawatts MW of generating capacity on a build-own-\noperate (BOO) basis. Sector performance has been mixed, and the performance of most of the\nPBSs has been much better than that of BPDB or DESA (Table 1).\nTable 1: Comparison of the Performance of Power Sector Utilities During FY1999\nDistribution Revenue\nUtility Generation Share Distribution Share Losses Collections\nGWh % GWh % (% of imports) (% of billings)\nBPDB 12,872 94 3,725 40 23 71\nIPPs 816 6 - - - -\nDESA          -          - 3,362 36 25 75\nDESCO 1 - - 205 2 41 58\nREB(PBSs)          -          - 1,989 22 19 92\nTotal 13,688 100 9,281 100 23\n1    Part year only.\n6. Bangladesh\u2019s annual per capita electricity consumption of 70 kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  in\nFY1998  was  the  third  lowest  among  ADB's  developing  member  countries  after  Nepal  and\nCambodia.4  Despite  intensive  efforts  to  increase  coverage,  only  about  18  percent  of  the\npopulation has access to electricity.5 Consumption of electricity increased at an average annual\nrate of 8.5  percent from FY1994 to FY1999, with major increases in industrial and residential use.\nThe ADB-financed Power System Master Plan (PSMP) study 6  assessed  that the demand for\nelectricity will increase by about 8 percent per year; and the peak demand will be about 3,500 MW\nby FY2000, although this looks extremely unlikely given the supply constraints in the sector. The\ncurrent installed capacity is 3,611 MW, of which about 2,700 MW is available, the rest being shut\ndown for rehabilitation or major maintenance.\n7. Inadequate supply of electricity is a major constraint to economic growth. During FY1999,\nload-shedding ranging from 16 to 774 MW, was resorted to on 335 days for a total duration of\n1,690 hours. Inadequate gas supply was partly responsible for lower power generation during\nthe year. Although the gas supply situation has improved, load-shedding will continue until\nsubstantial new generation capacity is added to the system  to  (i)  replace  very old power\nstations,  (ii)  allow  for  routine  preventive  maintenance  by  creating  a  reserve  margin,  and\n(iii) meet  the  increased  demand.  Erratic  power  supply  has  tended  to  increase  consumers'\n                                               \n3  The Rural Power Company Ltd. has 49 percent of its shares held by the private sector and 51 percent by the public\nsector. In accordance with the covenants under ADB\u2019s Loan 1356-Ban(SF) : Rural Electrification Project, for\nSDR34.4 million, approved on 30 May 1995; the public sector shareholding has to be brought down to 41 percent\nwithin six months of  commissioning of the company's first gas turbine in November 1999.\n4  In 1998, the annual per capita consumption in Nepal was 50 kWh and in Cambodia 55 kWh. Comparable figures\nfor some other developing member countries were India 340 kWh, and Thailand 950 kWh.\n5  Comparable figures for some other developing member countries are Cambodia with less than 10 percent, Nepal\n14 percent, Pakistan 48 percent, India 82 percent, and Thailand 99 percent.\n6  TA 1962-BAN:Preparation of a Power System Master Plan, for $600,000, approved on 11 October 1993.", "3\nunwillingness to pay their bills. This in turn has led to shortages of funds for maintenance and\nfurther aggravated the situation.\n8. Since Bangladesh's terrain is flat, hydropower potential is limited. The Jamuna-Padma-\nMeghna river system, which runs north to south, divides the country in two. The country's entire\nproven recoverable reserves of oil (including condensate), estimated at 59 million barrels, and\nnatural gas, estimated at 15 trillion cubic feet, are located on the eastern side of the river system.\nThe limited hydropower potential is also in the eastern part of the country. The west has no\ndeveloped commercial sources of energy. Coal reserves, which are located in the northwest, are\ndeep beneath the surface and difficult to develop. Only one potential mine with a limited output of\nabout 1 million tons per annum is being developed with external assistance. Consequently, of the\ncountry's total installed generation capacity of 3,611 MW, only about 590 MW (fueled by diesel oil\nand heavy fuel oil), is in the west. Of the 3,021 MW in the east, 2,786 MW is based on natural\ngas, the country's primary commercial fuel, and 235 MW is hydropower. In terms of energy\ngenerated, about 90 percent of the total in FY1999 was from gas-fired power plants.\n9. In  FY1998,  BPDB's  average  retail  tariff  for  its  ultimate  consumers  was  Tk2.67/kWh\n($0.055/kWh),  DESA's  was  Tk2.63/kWh  ($0.052/kWh),  and  PBS's  Tk3.30/kWh  ($0.07/kWh),\nleading  to  a  weighted  average  tariff  of  Tk.2.76/kWh  ($0.058/kWh),  as  compared  with  the\nestimated long run marginal cost (LRMC) supply of Tk3.86/kWh ($0.078/kWh). The LRMC will,\nhowever, decline sharply by FY2002 due to the lower costs of production from private sector IPPs.\nRetail  tariffs  are  being  adjusted  semi-annually  to  take  into  account  fluctuations  in  foreign\nexchange rates and fuel costs in particular the price of natural gas.\nB. Government  Policies and Plans\n10. The PSRB envisions a power sector structure based on (i) the separation of sector\nregulation  and  operation;  (ii)  autonomy  and  commercial  orientation  of  the  sector  entities;\n(iii) unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution; and (iv) increased private sector\nparticipation. A new regulatory authority would be responsible for (i) setting electricity tariffs and\ndetermining the corresponding performance norms; (ii) collecting, verifying, and disseminating\nsector  statistics;  (iii)  reviewing  and  approving  long-term  power  planning;  (iv)  creating  and\nmaintaining a nondiscriminatory and commercial business environment in the sector; and (v)\nadjudicating disputes between sector entities. While the transmission segment would remain in\nthe  public  sector,  generation  and  distribution  assets  would  have  both  public  and  private\nownership. The objective is to eliminate monopolies and instill competition in order to achieve\ncommercial discipline and good customer service.\n11. After initiation of reforms in 1994, the organizational setup of the sector changed. In\n1994, all generation was with BPDB; today there are several public-private and private sector\nentities licensed to construct and operate power-generating facilities. The first private barge-\nmounted power station started operation in December 1998. RPC\u2019s first gas turbine at its\nMymensingh site was commissioned on 20 November 1999.7 Others, under varying degrees of\nconstruction, are three barge-mounted power stations totaling about 300 MW, the IPP stations\nat Meghnaghat (450 MW) 8 and Haripur (360 MW), and the 100 MW expansion at Baghabari.\n12. Good governance, at the sector and corporate levels, is emphasized in the PSRB. At the\nsector level, governance is to be improved through predictability (long-term planning, codification\nof rules and regulations, and independence of regulatory processes), transparency (systematic\n                                               \n7\nSupported by the Bank through its loan 1356-BAN(SF): Rural Electrification Project for SDR34.4 million approved\non 30 May 1995.\n8\nTA 2338-BAN: Solicitation for Private Sector Implementation of the Meghnaghat Power Project for $211,000\napproved on 30 May 1995, enhanced to $595,000 in March 1998.", "4\ndissemination of relevant sector information, public hearings, and discussions on issues before\nthey are decided) and accountability (cause-effect structure of incentives). At the corporate level,\ngovernance is to be enhanced through corporatization, independence of boards of directors from\nthe Government, defined delegation of powers to staff, computerized management information\nsystems, and commercialization of activities.\n13. The Government  realizes that the investment requirements for the power sector during\nthe next decade, estimated at about $6.6 billion, exceed the resources available in the public\nsector and could crowd out investment in other key sectors. Therefore, the Government has taken\na policy decision to invite the private sector to participate in sector development. The Government\nhas made substantial efforts to streamline administrative and commercial procedures and the\nprivate sector has responded positively in its participation. The Government, with the assistance\nof ADB, and the World Bank, has successfully solicited private sector participation in generation.\nTo streamline the legislative basis for the sector\u2019s restructuring and regulation, and to enable the\nestablishment of an independent regulatory authority, the Government is in the process of drafting\na new electricity reform act and is expected to introduce it to Parliament by December 1999. An\nADB  TA  will help draft power sector  regulations  to  be  administered  by  the  new  regulatory\nauthority.9  This will enable depoliticization of the tariff setting and licensing procedures, making\nthe sector\u2019s operations more transparent.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n14. Investment in the power sector during the last decade totaled $3,541 million. The major\nsources of external funding have been the ADB, the World Bank, France, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr\nWiederaufbau  (KfW),  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund  (OECF)10,  Department  For\nInternational  Development  (DFID),  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development\n(USAID), Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), People\u2019s Republic of China,\nand the Russia Federation. Other sources include the Islamic Development Bank; the Kuwait\nFund for Arab Economic Development; Saudi Fund for Development; Canadian International\nDevelopment  Agency;  United  Nations\u2019  Development  Program,  Swedish  International\nDevelopment  Cooperation  Agency;  Belgium,  Danish  International  Development  Assistance;\nand Department for International Development Cooperation Finland.  A summary of the external\nassistance to the sector,  detailing the Bank's assistance, is given in Appendix 2.\n15. While the ADB has supported generation, transmission, and distribution in urban areas,\nOECF  has  focused  on  generation  and  rural  electrification  projects.  DFID  has  financed\ntransmission and distribution in the Dhaka area in the past and is providing assistance to develop\nrenewable energy sources. USAID has been instrumental in establishing and funding REB and\nthe first PBSs, and continues to provide technical support to REB and the PBSs. KfW supported\ngenerating capacity augmentation and transmission reinforcement projects. Other aid agencies\nfinanced generation projects, and France and OPEC have financed some transmission and\ndistribution projects as well. The World Bank earlier supported distribution in smaller towns and\nrural areas. However, following initiation of the reforms, it has not provided any assistance to the\nsector other than TA for soliciting private sector participation and establishing the Power Cell. It is\ncurrently in the process of formulating a $600 million adjustable program lending modality loan to\nthe power sector.\n                                               \n9   TA 3129-BAN: Support for an Energy Regulatory Authority for $ 900,000,  approved on 16 December 1998.\n10  On 1 October 1999, OECF merged with the Export-Import Bank of Japan to form the Japan Bank for International\n     Cooperation.", "5\nD. Lessons Learned\n1. Contextual Issues\n16. The ADB has extensively supported the sector over the last 23 years. From its role as a\nproject financier in the 1970s, ADB provided funds as well as technical advice in the 1980s. Since\nthe initiation of the PSRB in 1994, ADB has provided policy advice to the Government on PSRB\nimplementation as well as funds to help achieve the least cost expansion program. During this\ninvolvement, ADB has learned the following lessons.\n17. Overall, macroeconomic/political issues of the country have a significant bearing on the\nsector's performance as well as its ability to reform. Political unrest, labor militancy, peace and\nsecurity enforcement, speed and quality of the judicial processes, and ability of the education\nsystem to provide the skilled labor, all affect the sector's performance, although there is very little\nthat  the  sector  by  itself  can  do  to  systematically  address  these  problems.  Power  sector\ndevelopment can only proceed in tandem with reforms in the rest of the economy and the\nsociopolitical regime, and to the level permitted by these external constraints. Forcing reforms\nbeyond this point becomes dysfunctional and may even jeopardize the entire reform process.\n18. Delegation of powers from the Government to the management of the utilities and from the\nmanagement to the staff is very limited, and despite efforts by ADB and other funding agencies,\nhas  not  been  sufficiently  enhanced.  The  entities  are  also  restricted  by  the  Government's\npersonnel and wage policies, which inhibit the recruitment and retention of competent staff, and\nthe retrenchment or dismissal of excess or nonperforming staff. Tariffs are based more on political\nconsiderations than on economic factors. The losses incurred by the utilities are compensated for\nby long-term, low interest loans from the Government; this is detrimental to the efficiency and\nfinancial health of the utilities. Losses incurred by the utilities are also compensated for by\nconverting Government debt to equity. Currently BPDB\u2019s debt-equity ratio stands at 40:60. These\nfactors clearly underscore the limited extent of improvements that can be made to the utilities in\ntheir present form. It is therefore essential that new sector entities be created that are not\nsubjected to the organizational limitations of BPDB and DESA, and that there be an overall\nenvironment of commercialization in the sector. Further, there is a need to distance the authority\nfor effecting tariff changes from the Government and depoliticize it.\n19. Fundamental changes in infrastructure sectors take time to implement even in developed\ncountries. In developing countries, change is more difficult to implement, and, therefore, requires\na more gradual approach. Speeding up reforms is functional only if the change is comprehensive.\nFor example, increasing tariffs too rapidly may help sector finances but often undermines the\nreform  objectives  by  penalizing  the  good  consumer  if  the  utilities  collect  only  from  a  low\npercentage of consumers. Affordability is also a factor. Rapid tariff increases can drive up the\ncosts of electricity,  making  it unaffordable to the poorer consumers, whereas  more  gradual\nincreases allow time for managing their effects.\n2. Compliance of Reform Actions Under Earlier Bank Loans\n20. The  ADB\u2019s  Eighth  Power  Project  will  close  in  December  1999  and  the  Rural\nElectrification Project is expected to be completed early next year. All structural reform-related\nconditionalities stipulated in these loans were met. The status of fulfillment of the restructuring\nconditionalities stipulated under the Bank\u2019s ongoing Ninth Power Project is as follows:\n(i)  Rationalization of DESA\u2019s Boundaries. As per the agreement, DESA was to have\nhanded over its rural areas to the PBSs by March 1998.  The law defining\nDESA\u2019s boundaries was amended on 19 April 1998. The Gazaria area was", "6\nhanded  over  to  the  PBSs  in  March  1998.  The  hand  over  of  the  Savar,\nNarshingdi,  and  Manikganj  areas  was  completed  in  September  1998.  The\nbalance was partially handed over in September and October 1999 with the last\ntransfer scheduled for December 1999. This rationalization has already improved\nperformance and reduced distribution losses by about 5 percent.\n(ii) Handover of Transmission Assets to PGCB. BPDB was to have handed over the\nComilla (North) and Haripur 230 kilovolt (kV) substations and about 45 kilometers\n(km) of 230 kV transmission lines by June 1998. However, there was a delay\nbecause  of  a  debate  on  whether  asset  transfers  should  be  gradual  or\nsimultaneous.  The  Government,  earlier  attempted  to  have  all  the  assets\nsimultaneously  transferred  in  February-March  1998.  The  excessive  financial,\nadministrative, and personnel problems faced by BPDB and PGCB made this\ntransfer impossible. The Government then decided in September 1998, that the\ntransfers would be gradual with the Ninth Power- related assets transferred in\nMarch 1999. The assets pertaining to the Bank\u2019s  Ninth Power  Project  were\nlegally transferred on 31 March 1999, and physical transfer was completed on\n13 October  1999.  This  transfer  has  started  the  process  of  segregating  the\nsubsectors.\n(iii)  Handover  of  DESA\u2019s  Mirpur  Assets  to  DESCO.  This  was  completed  on\n24 September 1998 with a delay of four months, and marks the start of the\ncorporatization process of the distribution subsector.\n(iv) Award of Contract for the Meghnaghat Project. This activity was to have been\ncompleted by June 1998. However, the selection of sponsors and award  of\ncontract for the Meghnaghat Power Project was delayed by over a year. All\nproject contracts were signed on 29 July 1999.\n(v) Liquidation of Government dues to BPDB and DESA. Arrangements have been\nmade for payment of Tk750 million in three tranches to liquidate BPDB arrears.\nThe first tranche of Tk250 million was paid, and budgetary provision made for\npayment  of  the  second  tranche  in  FY1999.  Similar  arrangements  are  being\nexplored for DESA. This is an ongoing activity and is expected to be completed\nby the end of FY2001.\n(vi)  Revision of Retail Tariffs.  As per the agreement between the Government and\nthe ADB, retail tariffs are reviewed and automatically adjusted for variations in\nfuel costs and foreign exchange value of the taka every six months, as per a\nformula. Retail tariffs have been reviewed and adjusted (when necessary) in\nMarch and September of each year except in 1999 when partial adjustments\nwere announced in July because the introduction of the value added tax on all\ncommodities and services. This tax affected retail electricity tariffs. In its review of\nSeptember 1999, the Government however, adjusted retail tariffs and made up\nthe shortfall of the March 1999 review.\n21. The fulfillment of conditions related to restructuring has been delayed in some cases by\nover a year. Nevertheless, the Government must be complimented on its determination to follow\nthrough with these politically difficult and sensitive actions. Some have led to law and order\nproblems that the Government had to tackle firmly. Since the commencement of the reform\nprogram in 1994, the Government has always delivered on the conditionalities it has agreed upon\nwith ADB as part of the process of power sector reforms. This gives ADB  confidence that\nnecessary actions will be taken by the Government and that it will determinedly pursue the\nreforms in the future.", "7\n22. The  political  situation  in  the  last  few  years  has  significantly  affected  the  collection\noperations of both BPDB and DESA since many commercial establishments, including banks,\nwere closed for prolonged periods and those that were open functioned with minimal services.\nDESA was particularly hard hit since Dhaka, as the capital city, was the center of the unrest, and\nnormal life in the city was disrupted for longer periods than in other towns. During FY1998, the\ncollection to generation ratio of BPDB and collection to import ratio of DESA were 64.03 percent\nand 57.98 percent respectively. These are far below the targets of 75 percent for BPDB and\n70 percent for DESA, and worse than the performance of FY1997. Performance of BPDB and\nDESA has also been affected by the constant changing of senior staff and low morale of staff\ncaused by the knowledge that other organizations will replace BPDB and DESA in the near\nfuture. On the other hand the performance of the seven PBSs supported by the ADB in the\nRural Electrification Project  has been very good with an average collection to import ratio of\n83.3 percent.\nE. ADB's Sector Strategy\n23. The ADB recognizes that (i) the substantial external assistance provided to the sector in\nthe past has induced a tendency in the sector agencies to depend on external assistance for\nfunding,  (ii)  recovery  and  development  must  be  led  from  within  the  sector,  and  (iii)  the\nGovernment and all major aid agencies must realign their individual strategies to emphasize this\nobjective. In consultation with the Government and the other funding agencies involved in the\nsector,  ADB has developed a medium-term plan to improve the power sector (Appendix 3). The\nstrategy  consists  of  (i) changes  in  the  business  environment  through  corporatization,\ncommercialization, and increasing private sector participation; (ii) institutional improvements in\nBPDB and DESA through introduction of modern management practices; (iii) creation of new\nsector agencies that could serve as role models for the sector; (iv) enlarging the scope of the\nPBSs; and (v) strengthening the long-term planning and regulatory processes in the sector. The\nproposed Project addresses items (i), (iii),  and (iv) of this strategy. Item (ii) is an ongoing process\nand item (v) has partially been addressed through the Power Sector Master Plan, the creation of\nthe Power Cell, and ADB's TA for support to the Energy Regulatory Authority.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n24. The ADB, World Bank, OECF, DFID, USAID, and KfW have been involved in a policy\ndialogue with the Government about issues in the power sector, with ADB playing the role of\ncoordinator. The ADB has played a major role in drawing up the reform assistance strategy of\nthe funding agencies, and in addition, has organized and coordinated aid coordination meetings\nfor the power sector in 1992, 1994, 1995, and 1996, and for the power and natural gas sectors\nin 1997 and 1998. ADB-led aid coordination meetings in December 1992, December 1994, and\nSeptember 1995 contributed to the formulation of reforms and the identification of reform-linked\nprojects in the sector. The ADB also provided TAs to review electricity legislation,11 prepare a\npower system master plan,12 upgrade the financial management of BPDB and DESA, 13 solicit for\nprivate sector implementation of the Meghnaghat Project14 and corporatize the Ashuganj Power\nStation of BPDB. 15 The Bank has been instrumental in assisting the Government to draw up a\nplan for the planned transformation of the sector, and the creation of new sector entities.\n                                               \n11 TA 1743-BAN: Review of Electricity Legislation and Regulations, for $90,000, approved on 18 August 1992.\n12TA 1962-BAN: Preparation   of  a Power System Master Plan for  $600,000, approved on  11 October 1993.\n13TA 2004-BAN: Financial Management Upgrade of BPDB and DESA, for $ 1,000,000, approved on 26 November\n1993.\n14 TA No. 2338-BAN: Solicitation of Private Sector Implementation of the Meghnaghat Project, approved on 30 May\n1995.\n15 Corporatization of Ashuganj Power Station for $1,000,000 to be presented for approval in December 1999.", "8\n25. The medium-term goals of the policy dialogue with the Government up to 2005 and the\nresults achieved so far are summarized at Appendix 3. Generation is no longer a monopoly, and\nhas sufficient private sector interest; the public sector stations are starting to be corporatized\nand commercialized. A start has been made in the process of segregating and corporatizing the\ntransmission function. Distribution is being corporatized in the Dhaka area, and the private\nsector PBSs have increased their share of sales from 13 percent in FY1993 to 22 percent in\nFY1999.  Average  retail  power  tariffs  were  increased  by  a  total  of  about  15  percent  (in\nSeptember and December 1996) and an interim formula for semiannual adjustment of retail\npower tariffs to take into account fluctuations in fuel costs and foreign exchange rates was\nsuccessfully implemented. 16 On the regulatory side, work has progressed through the creation\nof the Power Cell, which is mandated to plan and execute reform-related activities and act as a\nquasi-regulator  until  the statutory  regulator  is  appointed,  and  preparatory  studies  on  new\nlegislation, sector structure, and tariff framework have been completed. The draft Electricity and\nRegulatory Commission Act, 17 which will form the legal basis for power sector reform, is under\nreview by the cabinet  and is expected to be introduced in Parliament by December 1999.\n26. The funding agencies hold a coordination meeting every year to review sector policies\nand achievements. ADB missions have explained the rationale behind the Project in several\nmeetings. The funding agencies all support the Project itself but do not agree on all issues.\nWhile the World Bank is of the opinion that all BPDB generation plants should be privatized\nimmediately, this view is not supported by ADB, OECF, and KfW, the agencies involved in\nproviding funding for the power stations. They believe that corporatization and establishment of\na commercial structure for the sector should precede any attempt at privatization. In any case,\nthere is not enough private capital available in Bangladesh to purchase these assets and such a\nsale, if it fails, could affect successful private sector participation in other areas of the sector. All\nfunding agencies, however, agree that there  is a  limit  to  the country's foreign  investment\nabsorption capability. Too rapid an external investment rate in fixed assets would create a\nsqueeze in the local currency markets when repatriating debt servicing and profits.\n27. All funding agencies  consider distribution  subsector  reform  to  be  a  priority  as  this\nsubsector collects the entire revenues of the sector. The ADB has assumed responsibility for\nassisting with reforms in the Dhaka area and the World Bank for areas outside of Dhaka.\nExpansion of REB/PBS activities has been supported by ADB, the World Bank, OECF, and\nUSAID.\n28. DFID is concerned about DESA\u2019s performance being much below that targeted by the\nfunding agencies. Hence it is of the opinion that new assistance should not be provided to\nDESA until it achieves the targeted performance levels. ADB believes that the ultimate objective\nis to improve sector efficiencies without major disruptions in electricity service and without any\npolitical embarrassment to the Government, which could dilute its commitment to reform. The\nADB\u2019s operation in the Dhaka area and its support to DESA must also be viewed as a holding\noperation to enable other reforms to be initiated in the sector. Since DESA has failed to perform,\nDESCO  was  created;  it  will  gradually  take  over  DESA's  assets,  make  the  necessary\nimprovements and has the potential to be privatized. DESA\u2019s market share is being reduced\nprogressively by transferring parts of its distribution territory to DESCO and  the PBSs. In a\nsense, therefore ADB is investing in a DESCO of the future when it invests in present day\nDESA.  In  the  interim  period,  DESCO  will  provide  DESA  with  competition,  which  will  aid\n                                               \n16 Agreed as part of the policy dialogue under the ADB Loan 1505-BAN(SF): Ninth Power Project.\n17 Supported by the ADB under its TA to 1743-BAN: Review of Electricity Legislation and Regulations, approved on\n18 August 1992, as well as by a World Bank TA.", "9\nimprovement in DESA also. To not support DESA would create technical imbalance in service\nand be politically unacceptable to the Government.\n29. OECF  (now  JBIC) is  seeking  to  complement  the  Project  through  a  new  loan  of\n\u00a54,376 million (about $36.47 million) that will (i) strengthen and intensify rural electrification in\nfour PBSs, including one in the Dhaka area; and (ii) expand the system loss reduction scheme\nincluding for two feeders in the Dhaka area. In addition, JBIC is providing assistance for the\nexpansion of the Haripur power station, and has already conducted preliminary studies on\nreorganizing  its  operations  under  a  profit  center  concept  that  complements  ADB\u2019s  TA  for\ncorporatizing the Ashuganj Power Station. KfW, is considering a new operation to rehabilitate\nand subsequently modernize the Ashuganj power station, if it is successfully corporatized under\nADB\u2019s TA. KfW has also been in constant dialogue with the Government in support of liquidating\nthe Government's dues to BPDB and DESA. USAID has strengthened its support to REB/PBSs\nto help them handle their increasing responsibilities, and has also assisted them to draft a\ngraduation policy for the PBSs.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n30. The Project is a continuation of the long-term strategy of the Government and ADB for\npower sector reform. The rationale for the choice of the reform components of the Project is as\nfollows.\n1. Generation\n31. The private sector has the potential to add about 1,400 MW of capacity over the next five\nyears. This is 39 percent of the current installed capacity of 3,611 MW and 68 percent of the\ncurrently available capacity of about 2,400 MW. Thus there is a need to take stock of the\nsituation before further IPP capacity is committed. The Government has guaranteed conversion\nof  foreign  exchange  under  the  several  implementation  agreements  that  were  signed,  or\ncommitted to be signed, with the private sector IPPs; the amount under guarantee represents a\nsignificant portion of its total foreign exchange reserves. The total capacity of the new projects,\nincluding  additional  peaking  power  stations  as  required,  would  be  adequate  to  fulfill  the\nrequirements of the country until 2005 at the current rate of load  growth.\n32. Corporatization  of  the  generating  facilities  presently  under  BPDB  and  their\ncommercialization has commenced. Since economic dispatch routines will be enforced by the\nregulator, it is essential that the power stations owned and operated by BPDB be upgraded both\ntechnically and managerially; otherwise, they risk being marginalized under the new operating\nregime. Given that the present structure and internal procedures of BPDB are not conducive to\nrapid absorption of new routines, staffing norms, and internal discipline that would be demanded\nof it, a new corporatized subsidiary of BPDB is being created to take over the responsibility of\nmanaging the Ashuganj Power Station. This company will function as another IPP. Funding for\nupgrading the Ashuganj Power Station is being considered by KfW and JBIC.\n2. Transmission\n33. For transmission, priority investments include (i) the development of the National Load\nDispatch Center, (ii) the strengthening of the primary transmission system in the West Zone,\n(iii) the completion of the 230 kV double-circuit ring around Dhaka, and (iv) the completion of the\ninterconnection from Comilla to Chittagong. The World Bank has already indicated support for\nthe  National  Load  Dispatch  Center,  and  KfW  for  the  Comilla-Chittagong  interlink  and\ncomponents for strengthening the West Zone network.", "10\n34. With the assistance extended to PGCB as part of the ADB's Ninth Power Project and the\nproposed assistance being considered for it by the World Bank and KfW, completing the 230kV\ndouble-circuit ring system around Dhaka is the only remaining work of priority,  since  it  is\nessential for delivering adequate quantities of secure power to the Dhaka area and also for\nevacuation  and  economic  utilization  of  power  from  all  the  BOO/BOT  projects  now  being\ncontracted.\n3. Distribution\n35. Given the extensive participation of the private sector in generation projects, the financial\nviability of the power sector will be in jeopardy unless the distribution subsector is strengthened\nto ensure offtake of power as well as generate adequate revenues for servicing the investments\nin the generation and transmission subsectors. Otherwise, the Government's guarantees to the\nIPPs could be called, placing an unacceptable burden on its budgets. The ADB has two options\navailable; (i) to consolidate its involvement in the Dhaka area, or (ii) to help other major towns\nrestructure their distribution networks. Given (i) the precarious state of Dhaka\u2019s distribution\nnetwork and the requirement for large investments to upgrade it; (ii) the preponderance of\nDhaka as a economic center of Bangladesh; (iii) the considerable work ADB has put in as part\nof its previous operations in this area, which are just beginning to show results; and (iv) the\nlimitation of ADB\u2019s staff resources, it is appropriate for ADB to continue its support for upgrading\ndistribution in the Dhaka area.\n4. Institutional Strengthening\n36. The Bangladesh power sector will have to rapidly expand into the rural areas if the\ncurrent low access rate of electricity is to be speedily improved. This is going to place a major\nburden on the human resources of REB and the PBSs. At present REB has only a small\ntechnical training establishment at Savar near Dhaka, and skeletal managerial training facilities\nat its headquarters. This arrangement is inadequate for the future, and REB needs to develop\nfull facilities for training and development of PBS staff. Hence, REB has requested ADB's\nsupport  to  strengthen  human  resource  development  activities.  This  training  facility,  when\nestablished, would also be available for use by other sector entities on a cost sharing basis.\n37. Based on the foregoing analysis, it is appropriate for ADB to support (i) completing the\n230kV ring around Dhaka city; (ii) upgrading of distribution in the Dhaka area; (iii)  establishing\na training and managerial development institute in REB.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n38. The  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  enable  evacuation  and  economic  utilization\nof the power generated from the BOO/BOT projects now being contracted; (ii) reduce losses  and \nimprove reliability of the existing transmission and distribution system in the Dhaka area; and\n(iii) initiate preparatory works for a training and management development institute in REB.\n39. The Project comprises the following components:\n40. Part A: 230/132 kV Transmission System around Dhaka. This involves:\n(i)  construction of about 50 km of 230 kV double-circuit transmission lines\n(Tongi-Aminbazar-Hasnabad);\n(ii)  construction of about 10 km of 132 kV, double-circuit, overhead, and\nunderground transmission lines; turn in and out of the existing Tongi-\nHasnabad  132  kV  transmission  line  into  Aminbazar  and  Kalayanpur", "11\nsubstations; and connection of  Rampura 230 kV substation to Gulshan\nand Moghbazar 132 kV substations;\n(iii)  extension of the 230/132 kV substation at Tongi (2 bays);\n(iv)  extension of the 230/132 kV substation at Hasnabad (2 bays);\n(v)  extension of the 132 kV substation at Kalyanpur (2 bays); and\n(vi) Construction of a new 230/132kV substation at Aminbazar.\n41. Part B:  Upgrading of the Distribution System in Dhaka. This component includes:\n(i)  rehabilitation and expansion of the rural distribution network in the Dhaka\narea taken over by the PBSs from DESA;\n(ii)  upgrading and expansion of the distribution system of the Gulshan area;\nand\n(iii)  upgrading and expansion of the distribution system in the rest of Dhaka.\n42. Part C: Preparatory work for a training and management development institute. This\ncomponent provides consulting services to identify training needs; develop curriculum, identify\ntraining facilities and faculty; detail and prepare specifications for such facilities; and help with\nbid evaluation and award, and preconstruction activity.\nC. Cost Estimates\n43. The total cost of the Project is $300.0 million equivalent including foreign exchange\ncosts of $157.0 million (52.3 percent)  and local currency costs of $143.0 million equivalent\n(47.7 percent). The cost estimates are expressed in 1999 prices and include provisions for\nphysical and price contingencies, currency movements and interest, and other charges during\nconstruction. Import duties and taxes are included, at applicable rates, in the local currency cost\nestimates. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 2 and are presented in greater detail in\nAppendix 4.\nTable 2: Summary of Project Costs\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n44. It is proposed that  ADB provide  two  loans,  one  of  SDR54.319  million  ($75  million\nequivalent) from its Special Funds resources and one of $82 million 18 from its ordinary capital\nresources (OCR) to finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of the Project. The local\ncurrency requirements of the Project will be met by the Government through debt, grant, and\nequity contributions to the project EAs. The foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks\nwill be borne by the Project EAs for Parts A, B(ii), and B(iii), while the Government will assume\nthese risks for Parts B(i) and C. A summary financing plan is provided in Table 3.\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Per cent\nCurrency Currency Cost\nA. Long-Term Loans\nADB 157.0 0 157.0 52.3\nB.

The Special Funds resources loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace period\nof 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and\n1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The Borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh,\nand the proceeds will be relent to DESA and REB for parts B(i) and (iii) and C of the Project,\npursuant  to  subsidiary  loan  agreements  with  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB.\nRelending terms to DESA will include a repayment period of 20 years, including a 4-year grace\nperiod, and an interest rate of 8 percent per annum. For REB, relending terms will include a\nrepayment period of 30 years including a grace period of 8 years. Interest will be charged at a\nrate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 3 percent per annum thereafter. The\npreferential relending terms allowed to REB are in recognition of the noncommercial, human\nresource development nature of its activities.\n46. The OCR loan will be provided to the People's Republic of Bangladesh with a 20-year\nterm, including a grace period of 5 years and at an interest to be determined in accordance with\nADB's pool-based variable lending rate for such loans. It will be utilized to finance Parts A and\nB(ii) of the Project. The loan will be relent to PGCB and DESCO with a repayment period of\n20 years, including a 4-year grace period, and at the same interest rate plus a fee of 1 percent.\nThe OCR loan will be the first such loan to Bangladesh from the ADB since its reclassification\nas a B1 19 country. As such, it represents a substantial hardening of the ADB\u2019s support to the\n                                               \n18 This would be reduced to $75 million if the Islamic Development Bank provides cofinancing of $7.0 million. The\nproposed cofinancing will be for a discrete component of the Project and will be on a parallel basis. ADB will not\nadminister the cofinanced portion.\n19 R:204-98: A Graduation Policy for the Bank's DMCs, approved on 14 December 1998.", "13\ncountry. In order to ease problems of transition, this loan has been earmarked to support the\nnew corporatized entities.\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Executing Arrangements\n47. Part A will be executed by PGCB. Part B will be executed partly by REB, DESCO and\nDESA as summarized here:\n(i)  REB will be the EA for the rehabilitation and expansion of the rural distribution\nnetwork in the Dhaka area  taken over by the PBSs from DESA;\n(ii)  DESCO will be the EA for the upgrading and expansion of the distribution system\nin Gulshan; and\n(iii)  DESA will be the EA for the upgrading and expansion of the balance Dhaka\ndistribution system.\n48. Part C will be executed by REB.\n49. As part of the process of consolidating the transfer of assets from DESA to DESCO, the\nGulshan circle of DESA will be transferred to DESCO by June 2000, before implementing Part\nB(ii) of the Project. The Government plans to review DESCO's performance in December 1999,\nand help it identify and overcome weaknesses in its operations so as to smoothly absorb Gulshan\ncircle. The ADB has also accorded a small-scale TA to advise DESCO's management on key\norganization matters 20.\n2. Implementation Schedule and Performance Review\n50. The  project  implementation  schedule  is  given  in  Appendix  5.  Implementation  has\ncommenced in September 1999 and will be completed in September 2003. Direct supervision of\nsubproject  implementation  and  monitoring  of  subproject  operation  performance  will  be  the\nresponsibility of the EAs and the Government. EAs will provide quarterly progress reports to ADB\non their respective responsibilities, within 30 days of the end of each quarter. The ADB will review\nthe implementation and operation of the Project based on these reports and meet with the EAs\nand the Government  semiannually to discuss project progress. The ADB will also monitor the\noverall performance of the EAs.\n3. Procurement\n51. Procurement of goods and services financed by ADB will be carried out in accordance\nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. For such procurement, bid specifications will be prepared\nin  a  manner  to  ensure  maximum  competition  under  international  competitive  bidding.  To\nencourage  local  industry,  it  is  proposed  to  permit  the  EAs  to  accord  local  manufacturers\nparticipating in international bids under the project, price preference of up to a maximum of\n15 percent as per ADB's scheme for such preferences. A list of the major contract packages\nunder the Project with their cost estimates is given in Appendix 6.\n                                               \n20 TA 3244-BAN: Capacity Building for Dhaka Electric Supply Company Ltd., for $90,000, approved on 20 August\n1999.", "14\n4. Consulting Services\n52. Consultants for development of the REB training institute will be recruited in accordance\nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of reference for  consulting\nservices are given in Appendix 7.\n5. Advance Procurement Action\n53. All the EAs have sufficient expertise in procuring materials for the works entrusted to them\nunder the Project and have been allowed to initiate advance procurement action for the goods and\nservices to be financed by ADB. The Government was advised that ADB's approval of such\nadvance procurement action will not in any way commit it to subsequently approve the Project. All\nsuch advance procurement actions will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement\nand its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants as described in paras 51 and 52 respectively.\n6. Disbursement Procedures\n54. Since  the  disbursements  under  the  Project  will  be  mainly  for  supply  of  goods  and\nconsulting  services,  ADB's  commitment  and  direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for\ndisbursement purposes.\n7.  Reports,  Accounts,  and Audits\n55. The EAs will prepare separate progress reports for their respective components and\nsubmit them to ADB on a quarterly basis. The reports will provide a narrative description of\nprogress made during the period, changes to the implementation schedule, problems or difficulties\nencountered, the performance of the project implementation consultants, and the work to be\ncarried out in the upcoming period. The progress reports will also include a summary financial\naccount for the Project. This will consist of project expenditures during the period, year to date,\nand total expenditure to date. The ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project\nbased on these reports and meet with the EAs and the Government semiannually to discuss\nproject progress. Project completion reports will be submitted to ADB within six months of project\ncompletion.\n56. The EAs will have their annual financial statements and Project accounts audited by a\nprofessional auditing firm acceptable to ADB. Unaudited statements will be furnished to ADB\nwithin six months of the close of the financial year and audited statements within three months\nthereafter.\nF. Executing Agencies\n57. Organization charts and details with respect to financial performance and projections for\neach of the EAs are provided in supplementary appendixes. Projected financial statements and\nmajor assumptions used for the financial projections for each EA are provided in Appendix 8.\n1.  The Powergrid Company of Bangladesh\na. Responsibilities\n58.

A summary of DESCO's projected financial performance is provided in Table 5. Although\nincorporated in 1996, DESCO began commercial operations in September 1998 when assets of\nthe Mirpur distribution area were transferred from DESA. The future expansion of DESCO is in\naccordance with the sales forecast in the PSMP, and estimated system losses and asset\nacquisition are in agreement with the least cost expansion plan.

Organizational Structure\n66. DESA is governed by a board appointed by the Government and comprising a full-time\nchairperson and three full-time members.\nc. Financial Performance\n67. A summary of DESA's projected financial performance is provided in Table 6. DESA has\nbeen operating since 1991. When established, DESA assumed debt and accounts receivable in\naddition  to  assets  transferred  from  BPDB.  Over  the  past  eight  years,  DESA\u2019s  financial\nperformance has been less than satisfactory. DESA\u2019s systems losses are well above those\nnormally expected in an efficiently run distribution company, with some districts incurring actual\nlosses as high as 60 percent. DESA\u2019s collection ratio, which has at times dropped to as low as\n48 percent, and its increasing levels of accounts receivable, are evidenced by successive and\nsignificant cash flow deficits. As per the reform plans of the Government, DESA will have\ngradually handed over all its assets to DESCO or other successor companies by 2002 and\nhave ceased to exist in its present form. Therefore, although financial projections have been\nmade until 2008, they are only indicative.\nTable 6: Summary of DESA's Projected Financial Performance\nItem 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\nRate of Return (26.3) (13.2) (11.7) (9.1) (8.3) (7.9) (7.5) (7.0)\non Historic Net\nFixed Assets\n(%)\nOperating Ratio (22.8) (24.8) (15.1) (8.3) (3.8) (2.5) (1.6) (0.6)\n(%)\nRate of Return \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\non Average\na\nEquity (%) \nCurrent Ratio 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1\nDebt to Equity 100% debt 100% debt 100% debt 100% debt 100% debt 100% debt 100% debt 100% debt\nRatio (%)\nDebt Service (0.1) 0.3 0.6 (0.0) 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3\nCoverage Ratio\n(times)\nCollection to 97.7 122.3 116.8 80.7 81.7 81.7 81.7 81.7\nb\nImport Ratio \n(%)\nNet Income (5,021,931) (4,388,547) (4,109,395) (3,367,582) (3,175,866) (2,923,415) (2,687,120) (2,429,667)\n(Taka 000's)\na\n  As average net equity is in deficit (i.e., less than zero), computation of return on equity yields an illogical result.\nb\n  Higher than average collection to import ratio indicates transfer of assets and therefore lower import compared to\nimproved collection of outstanding accounts receivable.\n4.  Rural Electrification Board / Palli Bidyut Samities\na.  Responsibilities\n68. REB  is  an  infrastructure  development  agency  of  the  Government,  created  as  an\nautonomous entity under a Presidential Ordinance in 1977  to  implement  the  electrification\nprogram through consumer cooperatives, the PBSs. The creation of this autonomous body was", "18\none of the recommendations of the consulting firms that conducted feasibility studies for the\nGovernment\u2019s Rural Electrification Program in 1977, which was financed by USAID.\n69. The major functions of REB, as incorporated in its charter, are to (i) establish electricity\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution systems in rural areas of Bangladesh; (ii) organize\nprospective consumers of electricity into formal and informal groups such as societies and\ncompanies; (iii) formulate bylaws, for the PBSs and other groups registered with REB, and\ndetermine  the  methods  of  their  operations;  (iv)  advance  funds  for  the  implementation  of\napproved schemes, the operation and management of works and services, and construction of\nlines for members for electric connections; (v) hand over to the PBSs the completed projects for\noperation,  maintenance,  and  management;  (vi)  train  personnel  in  the  management  and\noperation  of  REB  and  the  PBSs;  (vii)  develop  standards  for  work,  equipment,  operation,\nmaintenance, procurement and warehousing, personnel and fiscal administration, and other\naspects of management to be followed by REB as well as by the PBSs and other groups\nregistered with REB.\n70. There are 54 PBSs that currently serve about 1.2 million consumers and distribute about\n22 percent of the electricity consumed in the country. The responsibilities of a PBS begin when\na distribution scheme is handed over to it for operation and maintenance after construction and\ncommissioning. Its principal  objective  is  to  supply  its  members and  other  consumers  with\nelectricity. Its functions include (i) distributing electricity and providing consumer connections;\n(ii) meter  reading,  billing, and  collection;  (iii)  purchasing  electricity from  BPDB  and  DESA;\n(iv) planning  and  implementing  the  expansion  of  local  distribution  acquiring  and  installing\nelectrical appliances, and improving system power factors through the installation of capacitors.\nb.  Organizational Structure\n71. REB is managed by a Board consisting of a chairperson and three full-time board\nmembers (finance, engineer, and PBSs and training). To coordinate with the rural electrification\nprogram  in  their  respective  fields,  four  part-time  Board  members,  represent  BPDB,  the\nBangladesh  Agricultural  Development  Corporation,  the  Bangladesh  Small  and  Cottage\nIndustries Corporation, and the Bangladesh Rural Development Board.\n72. Each PBS is a member-owned autonomous cooperative, distributing electricity in its\nservice area. The initial board of directors of a PBS is selected from local citizens, subject to the\napproval of REB\u2019s board of directors. After appointment, directors register the PBS with REB,\nwhich then proceeds to encourage potential consumers to become members of the PBS. The\nboard of directors consists of 10-15 members elected by an annual members\u2019 meeting. Eligibility\nto become or remain a director includes being a bona fide member of a PBS and a resident of\nits service area. Any person or organization in a PBS's area may become a member of the PBS\nfollowing acceptance by the board of directors and payment of a membership application fee of\nTk10. The Board elects a president who functions as its chief representative officer.\nc. Financial Performance\n73. The ultimate owners and operators of the REB-implemented component of the Project\nwill  be  the  seven  PBSs  of  Dhaka-1,  Dhaka-2,  Narshingdi-1,  Narshingdi-2,  Manikgonj,\nMymensing-1, and Munshigonj. To assess the financial position and performance of Part B(i),\nthe financial statements for the seven PBSs were consolidated and projected based on the\nconsolidated position. A summary of the consolidated financial performance is provided  in\nTable 7.", "19\n74. The PBSs have the authority to set retail tariffs (with the exception of agriculture tariffs,\nwhich are established by the Government). PBS tariffs tend to be sufficient to cover all operating\ncosts and debt service obligations, and provide an adequate return on equity. The PBSs are\nnontaxable and do not bear foreign exchange risks associated with foreign borrowing. Surplus\ncash and reserves are used to invest in expansion and technical improvement projects.\nTable 7: Summary of Consolidated PBS Projected Financial Performance\nItems 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\nRate of Return on 11.2 17.5 25.4 24.4 22.0 26.7 32.3 38.5\nHistoric Net Fixed\nAssets  (%)\nOperating Ratio (%) 20.7 26.6 31.8 34.2 34.5 35.8 36.9 37.6\nRate of Return on 20.6 24.2 24.2 21.8 18.9 18.4 17.8 17.1\nAverage Equity (%)\nCurrent Ratio 3.9 4.9 6.8 8.1 8.5 9.8 11.2 12.7\nDebt to Equity 65 60 56 52 46 41 36 31\nRatio (%)\nDebt Service 3.4 6.4 8.0 7.5 6.4 4.6 5.2 5.8\nCoverage Ratio\n(times)\nCollection to Import 73.0 83.2 86.9 82.0 82.8 83.3 84.1 84.1\nRatio (%)\nNet Income 349,538 537,988 760,176 936,921 1,016,120 1,189,115 1,383,517 1,584,047\n(Tk 000's)\nG. Environmental and Social Issues\n1. Environment\n75. The Project is classified as environment category B as per ADB\u2019s system of categorizing\nprojects, requiring a summary of the initial environmental examination report to be attached to the\nADB\u2019s Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board. A preliminary examination\nindicates  that  there  will  not  be  any  deleterious  impact  on  the environment  that  cannot  be\nmitigated. An initial environmental examination of the 230 kV and 132 kV transmission lines and\nsubstations covered by Part A of the Project was conducted by PGCB. Other project components\nhave negligible impact on the environment.\n76. The summary initial environmental examination is attached as Appendix 9. Approximately\n8 hectares of land will be acquired by PGCB for the new 230 kV substation at Aminbazar. The\nidentified land is low lying and is flooded every year. Hence it supports no permanent population\nor structures. There are also no trees on the identified site that need cutting. PGCB will need to\nacquire right of way for the transmission lines that will be constructed. DESA will need to acquire\nabout 0.4 hectare of land for a new 132 kV substation at Kamrangichar. This does not have any\nsignificant environmental impact.\n2. Social Analysis\n77. Project components were discussed in detail by ADB missions with the management as\nwell as the staff associations of BPDB and DESA, who in turn have briefed their members. ADB", "20\nmissions have also discussed the elements of the Project with potential beneficiaries, such as the\nFederation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, several industrialists, as well as\na few residential and commercial consumers of Dhaka. The beneficiaries are aware of the Project\nand support the power sector reforms now being implemented. The staff of the power sector\nutilities support the Project, but have expressed reservations regarding the restructuring and\ncorporatization activities.\n78. The Project does not involve significant displacement of persons. A maximum of 100\npersons who are dispersed along the transmission line will be affected. A short resettlement plan\nwas prepared based on ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement  and is given in Appendix 10.\nMinor rerouting of the transmission lines will be considered during project implementation, which\nwill further reduce the number of affected persons. Implementation of the plan for compensation\nand resettlement will be closely monitored by ADB's review missions.\n3. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n79. The benefit monitoring and evaluation of the Project will be done by PGCB, REB, DESCO,\nand DESA, and will be reviewed by ADB missions as part of the supervision work. This will\ninclude  verification  of  (i)  the  number  of  additional  connections  provided,  (ii)  the  consumer\ncategories of the new connections, and (iii) the service improvements for existing consumers in\nthe Dhaka area. Institutional parameters such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, and\nsystem loss will also be evaluated.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1.  Project Basis\n80. As part of its private power generation policy adopted in October 1996, the Government\nhas  invited  private  sector  investment  to  increase  the  generation  capacity  in  Bangladesh.\nProposals were solicited for about 1,400 MW of generating capacity on a BOO basis. It is\nexpected that these capacities will be available within the next three years.\n81. Almost all incremental generation expected to come from the IPPs, is in the Dhaka area.\nConsequently, to allow evacuation of power from the new plants, complementary investments in\ntransmission and distribution facilities are required. The completion of the 230 kV double-circuit\nring around Dhaka and upgrading of DESA\u2019s and DESCO\u2019s distribution network to allow import\nof the newly available generation capacity is necessary given that Dhaka is the main center of\neconomic activity in Bangladesh. Appendix 11 presents the consumer connection summary,\nwhich provides the basis for the financial and economic analyses of the Project.\n2. Financial Analysis\n82. The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 1998\nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to\nreal terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency\nfluctuations. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of\nthe EAs under with- and without-project scenarios. The weighted average financial internal rate\nof return (FIRR) for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 9.4 percent. This compares\nfavorably with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), also computed on an after-tax", "21\nbasis,  of  3.9  percent.  The  Project  is  considered  both  financially  viable  and  sustainable.\nSensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  weighted  average  FIRR  is  robust  under  adverse\nconditions. The FIRR analysis is summarized in Table 8, the weighted average cost of capital\nanalysis is  summarized in Table 9. Detailed financial evaluation is provided in Appendix 12.\nTable 8:  Financial Internal Rate of Return Summary\nCase Part A Part B (i) Part B (ii) Part B (iii) Weighted\nAverage\nBase Case 7.7 18.6 8.5 7.7 9.4\nRevenues Decrease by 10% 5.8 13.9 3.8 5.8 6.5\nOperating Expenses\n Increase by 10% 5.9 15.8 5.3 6.3 7.2\nOne-year Construction Delay\n with a 10% Cost Overrun 5.4 14.3 6.1 4.8 6.4\nTable 9:   Weighted Average Cost of Capital Summary\nCase Part A Part B (i) Part B (ii) Part B (iii) Weighted\nAverage\nBase Case 4.52 0.28 4.68 4.36 3.9\nRevenues Decrease by 10% 4.52 0.28 4.68 4.36 3.9\nOperating Expenses\n Increase by 10% 4.52 0.28 4.68 4.36 3.9\nOne-year Construction Delay\n with a 10% Cost Overrun 4.73 0.28 4.69 4.54 4.1\n3. Economic Rationale of the Project\n83. Historically, the power sector has been operated within a relatively monopolized market,\nwhich  has  led  to  high  inefficiencies  and  uneconomic  resource  allocations.  To  address  the\nnecessary  sector  and  corporate  restructuring  and  governance  aspects,  the  Project  lends\ninvestment  support  to  a  series  of  policy-based  initiatives  that  have  (i)  broken  monopolies,\n(ii) introduced market-based mechanisms for competition and tariff setting, and (iii) redefined the\nroles of the public and private sectors. The Project thereby facilitates movement towards a more\ncompetitive market structure and financial accountability.\n84. The creation of the new sector entities should instill discipline and financial viability into the\nsector. Presently, because of failure to manage the utilities properly, system losses and accounts\nreceivable  are  excessive  and  drain  the  sector  of  about  $80  million  per  year.  In  FY1995,\nGovernment  loans  to  BPDB  of  $345 million  were  converted  to  equity.  This  meant  that  the\nGovernment  had  foregone  the  domestic  mobilization  of  funds  inherent  in  the  onlending  of\ndevelopment loans and grants to the sector. The Government\u2019s equity in DESA, of $260 million\nhas been made almost worthless because of operational losses incurred since DESA's creation in\nFY1992. Efforts to remove the drain on the national exchequer and improve public financial\nmanagement are essential to aid in macroeconomic management, which is one of the objectives\nof the ADB\u2019s policy on good governance. 21\n                                               \n21 Board Document No. R151-95:Governance: Sound Development Management.", "22\n4. Project Costs in Economic Prices\n85. The economic analysis uses border price levels with a world price numeraire and 1998\nprices. To convert the financial capital cost into economic cost, taxes and duties were deducted.\nNo price contingencies are included in the base capital cost. However, the economic capital\ncosts include 10 percent physical contingencies. The costs are separated into foreign exchange,\nindirect foreign exchange, and local currency cost. Local costs are further  separated,  and\nspecific conversion factors are used for skilled and unskilled labor. The remaining local costs\nwere  converted  to  border  price  levels  by  applying  a  standard  conversion  factor.  Annual\noperation and maintenance costs were calculated in economic prices as a percentage of the\ntotal capital investment cost. It is assumed that after five years of full operation this percentage\nwill increase as more comprehensive maintenance works will be needed. The cost of energy at\nthe generation level is valued at the weighted average of IPP send-out cost of $.036/kWh. This\nreflects the fact that all incremental generation capacity in the greater Dhaka area is expected to\nbe supplied by the IPPs. Transmission and distribution losses are included in the total amount of\nenergy to be imported into the transmission and distribution system.\n5. Project Benefits in Economic Prices\n86. Economic benefits of electricity consumption were calculated for each major consumer\ncategory. For nonincremental consumption these are based on the alternative economic costs\nof other energy sources such as diesel generators and kerosene lamps, which will be replaced\nby electricity. The elimination of load-shedding is used as a proxy to estimate the amount of\nnonincremental consumption.\n87. Once all load-shedding is eliminated, all additional electricity consumption is considered\nincremental. For example, it is expected that once reliable electricity supply is created there will\nbe increased purchase for more sensitive electrical appliances like refrigerators by domestic\nconsumers or production equipment by industries. Incremental, or induced, consumption was\nvalued at the estimated average willingness to pay for electricity based on a weighted average\nof the alternative costs of providing similar energy-related services and the current electricity\ntariff for each consumer category. The evaluation is described in more detail in Appendix 13.\n88. The  base  case  economic  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at\n22.7 percent.  The EIRR was calculated over a 20-year period, corresponding to the estimated\nuseful life of the Project. No residual value was  considered. Sensitivity analysis for the EIRR\ndemonstrates  that  the  Project  remains  viable  even  with  adverse  movements  in  some\nparameters such as increase in capital cost, increase in LRMC at the generation level, or\nconstruction delays. Results of a switching value analysis are also provided in Appendix 13.\n6. Macroeconomic Effects\n89. As  a  direct  consequence  of  the  sector  inefficiencies,  the  country  is  experiencing\nsubstantial power supply constraints that have led to almost daily load-shedding. Uninterrupted\npower supply was available on only 30 days of FY1999. Scheduled load-shedding exists in\nparallel with the more frequent unscheduled load-shedding causing great disruption to economic\nactivity.22 Direct short-run costs consist of spoilage and damage due to unscheduled loan-\nshedding. They include shutdown and restart costs of equipment and reflect the opportunity\ncosts of under-utilization of production factors due to rescheduling of activities as a result of\ncontrolled load-shedding. Indirect short-run costs reflect the multiplier effects resulting from the\ntypical interdependence between one firm\u2019s input and another output. Long-run costs reflect the\n                                               \n22 This is based on Sanghvi, Arun P., 1991 Power Shortages in Developing Countries.", "23\nconsumers' adaptation strategies as a result of their expectations that power shortages will\npersist. In the domestic sector this can result in the purchase of voltage regulators to protect\nequipment and in investment in battery sets with inverters to run small appliances like fans and\ntelevisions. In the industry sector, the unreliability of the grid supply has led to heavy investment\nin captive generation.\n90. A World Bank study23 found that in FY1998 alone, generators with a total capacity of\n50 MW were imported into Bangladesh at a total cost of $24 million. Since these machines run\nmainly on oil or diesel, the fuel will also need to be imported, and total costs to the economy\ncould  be as  high  as $200  million.  These expenditures on captive power  generation  have\ntherefore heavy opportunity costs in terms of, for example, reduced investment for capacity\nexpansion in other sectors, and represent a misallocation of funds.  In  addition  to  slowing\nindustrial output, power shortages  also result in increased imports and a decrease of exports,\nwith potentially adverse impacts on national income, employment, foreign exchange reserves,\nand foreign direct investments.\n7. Tariff Analysis\n91. The Electricity Act of 1910, as amended by the 1972 Presidential Decree 59, requires\nthe electricity sector to earn a reasonable return after meeting its operating costs, debt service,\nand depreciation. The Government is responsible for making tariff adjustments, except in the\ncase of the PBSs which, being privately owned, are able to set their own tariffs.\n92. Until  September  1996,  the  weighted  average  national  tariff  was  Tk2.34/kWh\n($0.49/kWh), or about 50 percent of the LRMC at the distribution level as computed in 1996.\nThe Government raised electricity tariffs by 9.72 percent effective 1 October 1996, and an\nadditional 5.21 percent effective 1  December  1996, for a  total  increase  of  14.93 percent.\nEffective 1 January 1997, tariffs are now reviewed every six months and automatically adjusted\nas required, to take into account variations in key input costs, namely, fuel costs and exchange\nrates, the last being in September 1999. Future tariff revisions will be set by the independent\nregulatory commission that will be established as part of the reforms.\n93.  By the end of FY1998, the weighted national tariff was Tk2.76/kWh ($.0575/kWh),\nabout 59 percent of the LRMC at the distribution level. However, with the commissioning of IPPs\nwith  lower  tariffs  over  the next few  years,  the  LRMC  will  be  reduced  substantially.  As  a\nconsequence, the average national retail tariff at its 1999 level will be about 71 percent of the\nrecalculated LRMC at the distribution level. It is expected that the impact of the sector reforms,\nwhich include specific targets for loss reductions, will contribute to an improving ratio of tariff to\nLRMC. With poor operating efficiencies, the sector penalizes consumers who pay for their\nelectricity  rather  than  those  who  do  not.  Therefore,  raising  tariffs,  without  concomittant\nimprovements in efficiency is inequitable. In the future, the regulatory commission will have to\nbalance tariff revisions with the mandated efficiency improvements on the side of the utilities so\nas not to punish customers who are paying their bills. In preparing financial projections for the\nEAs,  it  is  assumed  that  average  bulk  tariffs  (including  transmission  charges)  will  remain\nconstant in nominal terms for the next six years, and from that time forward, will increase in line\nwith domestic inflation. Average retail tariffs are projected to remain constant in real terms,\nincreasing only to reflect the effect of domestic inflation.\n                                               \n23 Data from World Bank\u2019s draft Bangladesh: Energy Strategy Note, December 1998.", "24\nB. Social Dimensions\n94. The Project is designed to promote economic growth by increasing the access to electricity\nsupply in the Dhaka area, including the rural areas supplied by the PBSs from DESA. The Project is\nexpected to provide a reliable power supply, thereby improving chances of industrialization and\nproviding employment opportunities. Reliable electric supply will also enhance education, health,\nand security facilities.\n95. Although the Project is essentially gender neutral, there are benefits that will be derived by\nwomen as a result of electricity supply, such as education, security, and more comfortable living.\nWith the advantage of better lighting, women can spend more time on education or other home-\nbased vocations. Community televisions in the villages can improve general knowledge of health,\nhygiene, and prevention of diseases. Street lighting will provide better security to women after dark.\nFurther, women will derive distinctive benefits through their mandatory representation on the board\nof directors of the PBSs. Each PBS reserves 5 of its 15 director seats for female advisers, who serve\nas channels for expression of women development's needs in the given area. As the PBSs are\nresponsible for planning local distribution system expansions, the Project provides women with a\nchance to actively participate in the development process.\n96. The  Project  furthers  the  development  of  the  PBSs,  which  are  special  purpose\nnongovernment organizations. REB, as one of the project EAs, relies on the PBSs to operate and\nmaintain the distribution network after physical construction is completed by it, thereby shifting\nresponsibility for output sustainability to the PBSs. The PBSs operate on a nonprofit basis and do\nnot allow their annually elected unpaid directors to hold any political or government appointment,\nmandate,  or  employment.  The  PBSs  have  multidimensional  development  roles  including\ncommunity  mobilization,  capacity building, and  direct  management  and  monitoring  of  project\noutputs.\n97. The domestic tariff structure incorporates a lifeline tariff of Tk 2.00/kWh ($0.04) for the first\n300 kWh per month. This energy amount is more than sufficient to cover electricity consumed for\nlight, one or two fans, and small household appliances, which is considered the need for electricity\nconsumption of a lower middle class household. While increasing tariffs in the past, it has been\nensured that this lifeline tariff is affordable by the lower income groups. About 100 kWh is expected\nto meet basic needs of the urban and rural poor for lights and fans.\n98. Although there are no layoffs envisaged as part of this Project, the overall reforms process\nwill, in the future, lead to surpluses of  certain categories of BPDB and DESA staff. Such staff can be\nretrained in other skills for redeployment in REB, DESCO, and BPDB's successor organizations.\nStaff who are not employable in the sector will be given separation compensation packages. The\npower sector agencies, in association with ADB and other aid agencies, will conduct studies next\nyear and evolve an appropriate scheme to mitigate the social impact of the reforms.\nC. Impact on Poverty\n99. As per ADB's classification, the Project does not directly address poverty reduction\nbecause  the  primary  beneficiaries  are  largely  the  industrial,  commercial,  and  domestic\nconsumers, both rural and urban, in the Dhaka area. This mix of consumers is important to\nsafeguard the financial and economic viability of the Project. However, the Project yields very\nattractive  economic  returns,  and  with  increasing  employment  opportunities  as  a  result  of\nelectrification,  there  will  be  trickle-down  benefits for  the  poor.  Power  outages  affect  small\nbusinesses more than larger ones \u2014 the small shopkeeper and the artisan, as well as the\npoorer  residential  consumers  who  cannot  afford  backup  generators.  Although  no", "25\ncomprehensive survey was carried out, estimates from various manufacturers\u2019 associations in\nBangladesh indicate that industrial production could be about 10 percent higher if reliable power\nis available in sufficient quantity. Power constraints have a direct impact on low-income workers\nas  can  be  illustrated  by  the  example  of  the  ready-made  garment  manufacturing  (RMG)\nindustries.  RMG  manufacturing  plays  a  dominant  role  in  the  country\u2019s  export  sector  and\ncontributes significantly to the national economy, but depends heavily on recurrent orders from\nforeign clients. Once a producer is not able to deliver on time due to exogenous factors like\nenergy shortage it will be more difficult to secure new orders from international clients who were\ndefaulted.  Since  RMG  manufacturers  employ  about  1.5  million  workers,  including  about\n1.25 million women, who constitute a significant fraction of the low-income population in Dhaka,\nthese will be the first to suffer from suspension of production and decline in foreign orders as the\nworkers are paid on a daily basis and have no social safety net. Moreover, the income of the\ngarment industry workers represents a major share of business for the owners of small-scale\nretail outlets, who depend on the purchasing power of the RMG employees. Thus the Project,\nby improving reliability of power supply has a direct impact on the poor, especially women.\n100. The multiplier effect of electricity on the local rural economy was emphasized by the\nfindings of a USAID-funded comprehensive field study carried out in 1996 to investigate the\neconomic and  social  impact of the  rural  electrification  programs  implemented  through  the\nPBSs.24 A general finding of the study was that the creation of PBSs has caused local markets\nto expand and has given rise to a new class of entrepreneurs. Since the launch of the program,\n6,000 direct jobs were created in the PBSs and REB. As the PBSs mature, and the industries\ngrow more established, the use of local raw material also increases thereby establishing a\nsupport economy that increases local employment and cash income. This has resulted in the\ncreation of about 7,500 jobs at various industries and shops, which have opened in response to\nthe  demands  created  by  the  program.  The  establishment  of  industries  as  a  result  of\nelectrification, their growth, and the creation of a support industry for industrial inputs has\nanother beneficial aspect on the local economy \u2014 the gradual development of local demand\nmarkets.\n101. A  long-term research study on rural poverty, 25 published in 1995, covered 62 villages\nrepresenting 57 of 64 districts in Bangladesh. One of the articles compiled in the book analyzes\nthe  determinants  of  poverty  and  their  relative  significance.  One  of  the  six  major  factors\nidentified, physical infrastructure, was defined to comprise rural electrification, irrigation, and\ntransport facilities.\n102. The  methodology  employed  consisted  of  comparing  electrified  with  nonelectrified\nvillages. The incidence of poverty was estimated for electrified villages and was then compared\nwith that of villages without access to electricity. Poverty was substantially reduced on with\nspread of electrification. Only 14 percent of the residents in electrified villages are hard core\npoor, defined as persons whose aggregate expenditure falls below the normative poverty line of\n2,112 calories per day plus a 30 percent allowance for nonfood basis needs, as compared with\n31 percent for unelectrified villages. The matched figure for moderate poverty is 27 percent and\n31 percent respectively. It was thus concluded by the researchers that the extreme poor benefit\nmore from rural electrification than the moderate poor.\n103. Further, it was speculated that the benefit may have originated more from the generation\nof employment opportunities in the rural nonfarm sector than from increasing the profitability per\n                                               \n24 Socioeconomic Impact Estimation of the Rural Electrification Program in Bangladesh, NRECA International Ltd.,\nUSA for USAID.\n25 Edited by Rahman, H.Z. and Hossain, M. eds. 1995 Rethinking Rural Poverty \u2013 Bangladesh as a Case Study\u2019\npublished by H.Z. Rahman in 1995, The University Press Limited, Chapter 15.5", "26\nunit of land. This was supported by the finding that the incidence of poverty for households in\nthe land-size category of 2.5-4.3 acres is almost the same for electrified and nonelectrified\nvillages. For the functionally landless and the small farm households, poverty was found to be\nsubstantially lower for villages with access to electricity.\n 104. ADB recently initiated a study by staff consultants to undertake a similar kind of analysis\nfor the greater Dhaka area with a special focus on the urban poor. The study will quantify and\nassess  the  socioeconomic  benefits  of  electrification  and  improved  electricity  supply.  In\nparticular,  the  study  will  analyze  the  actual  expenditures  on  energy  in  electrified  and\nnonelectrified households for comparable energy outputs, and the impact of electrification on\nproductive activities and on service delivery of public service institutions like clinics and schools.\nThe study will also explore whether a link between the provision of reliable electricity services\nand expansion, turnover, and employment of micro and small business can be established. Until\nnow all research has focused on the rural population; none has assessed how the urban\npopulation  is  coping  with  the  present  inadequate  energy  supply,  what  share  of  their\nexpenditures  is  allocated  for  energy  consumption,  which  of  their  activities  (industrial,\ncommercial, household) could be facilitated by switching over to electricity if it is adequately\nsupplied, and up to what extent the urban poor would be willing and able to pay for enhanced\nelectricity services. Appendix 14 provides the outline terms of reference for the study.\nD. Project Risks\n105. The  success  of  the  Project  is  dependent  on  (i)  implementation  of  the  Meghnaghat\n(Phase-1) and Haripur projects, at least by FY2002; and (ii) maintenance of tariffs to ensure\nfinancial viability of PGCB, DESA and DESCO. The project FIRR and EIRR were tested for these\nsensitivities  and  found  to  be  robust.  Additionally,  to  mitigate  the  first  risk,  the  Project  was\nprocessed only after the contracts for the Haripur and Meghnaghat projects were signed. To\nminimize the second risk, (i) covenants were proposed to ensure the financial viability of PGCB,\nDESA, and DESCO for the short term; and (ii) the legal framework for the sector is being changed\nand an independent regulatory authority established. The ADB has accorded TA to the new\nregulatory authority to support its operationalization 26.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n106. The  Government,  DESA,  DESCO,  PGCB,  and  REB  have  given  the  following\nassurances, in addition to the standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal\ndocuments:\n(i) Until the establishment of an energy regulatory body, the Government will ensure\nthat PGCB\u2019s transmission tariffs are reviewed every six months and are adjusted\nto  reflect  the  impacts  of  inflation  and  foreign  currency  fluctuations.  The\ntransmission tariffs will be sufficient to ensure full cost recovery for operation,\nmaintenance  and  financial  charges,  and  an  adequate  rate  of  return  on\ninvestment. \n(ii) By 30 June 2000, (a) DESA will transfer its assets in the Gulshan distribution\ncircle to DESCO; and (b) the Government will cause BPDB to transfer to PGCB\n                                               \n26 TA No. 3129-BAN: Support for an Energy Regulatory Authority, for $900,000, approved on 16 December 1998.", "27\nthe Tongi and Hasnabad 230 kV substations and the Haripur-Hasnabad 230 kV\ntransmission line, all under arrangements satisfactory to ADB.\n(iii) The Government will ensure that all local currency funds required for the Project\nare (i) committed in advance of its Annual Development Program on the basis of\nanticipated expenditure for the relevant year, and (ii) transferred to the concerned\nProject EAs at least three months prior to the anticipated need or disbursement.\n(iv) The Government will cause DESA, DESCO, PGCB, and REB to carry out benefit\nmonitoring and evaluation activities under the Project for their respective Parts of\nthe Project.

The Rural Electrification Board (REB) proposes to establish a modern technical and\nmanagement development institute to provide training and development to the managers and\nstaff of the Palli Bidyut Samities (PBSs). This program will also incorporate upgraded versions\nof the technical training currently provided by REB.\n2.  The consultant will:\n(i)  review the current training, both technical and managerial, being provided by\nREB to staff of the PBSs;\n(ii)  review REB's facilities for training and management development;\n(iii)  develop  an  appropriate  curriculum  for  the  institute,  taking  into  account  the\ntechnical and managerial long-term needs of the PBSs;\n(iv)  design the delivery of the program and identify hardware as well as faculty and\ntraining resources for the suggested curriculum;\n(v)  develop the detailed designs for the institute buildings and facilities, prepare bid\ndocuments  for  its  construction,  assist  with  the  bid  process,  and  supervise\nconstruction;\n(vi)  provide  assistance  in  locating  appropriate  faculty  for  delivering  the  training\nprograms; and\n(vii)  suggest methods to progressively introduce more local training faculty, including\ntraining for trainers.\n3.  It is expected that about 30 person-months of international consulting will be needed\nfrom a firm specializing in conceptualization, design, architecture, and engineering of training\nand  management  development  institutes.  The  consultants  will  be  supported  by  about\n50 person-months  of  domestic  consulting  with  expertise  in  engineering,  architecture,  and\ntraining methods.\n4. In  addition  to  consulting  services,  the  Project  will  also  include  provision  of  up  to\n20 person-months of international and 20 person-months of domestic faculty to develop and\ndeliver key training programs, as well as funds to purchase training aids and equipment.\n5. It is expected that the services will commence in July 2000 and be completed in June\n2003.", "Appendix 8, page 1\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS\nA.  General\n1. The Project will be executed by four separate executing agencies: (i) Part A will be\nexecuted  by  Power  Grid  Company  of  Bangladesh  (PGCB);  (ii)  Part  B(i)  by  the  Rural\nElectrification Board (REB); (iii) Part B(ii) by the Dhaka Electric Supply Company (DESCO); and\n(iv) Part B(iii) by the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA). Upon completion of Part B(i),\nassets, operation and debt repayment obligations will pass from REB to the seven Palli Bidyut\nSamitys (PBSs) participating in the Project (Dhaka-1, Dhaka-2, Narshingdi-1, Narshingdi-2,\nManikgonj, Mymensing-1, and Munshigonj). The PBSs are rural electricity cooperatives. Both\nPGCB and DESCO are limited liability companies registered under the Companies Act 1994;\nPGCB was incorporated on 21 November 1996 and DESCO on 3 November 1996. DESA is a\nstatutory authority of the Government created by the DESA Ordinance of 1990 (Presidential\nOrdinance No. 6 of 1990).\n2. Financial  projections  were  completed  on  an  executing  agency  basis.  As  asset\nownership, debt service obligations, and operating and maintenance responsibilities for Part B(i)\nwill eventually lie with the PBSs, a consolidated model was produced based on the actual and\nprojected performance of the seven PBSs.\nB.  Past Financial Performance\n3. Although  established  in  1996,  PGCB  has  just  commenced  commercial  operations.\nBalance sheets and statements of preliminary expenses have been maintained in accordance\nwith acceptable accounting standards.\n4. Of the seven PBSs participating in the Project, five have existing operations. Two,\nDhaka-2 and  Munshigonj,  are  newly  established  PBSs.  At  Project  appraisal,  the  financial\npositions of the operational PBSs varied. Dhaka-1 and Narshingdi-1 are performing well, with\nhealthy balance sheets and sound profitability. The remaining three are in the initial stages of\noperation, balance sheets are sound, and they are gradually improving their overall profitability,\nhowever they continue to rely heavily on Government subsidies.\n5. Although incorporated in 1996, DESCO began commercial operations in September\n1998  when  approximately  58  percent  of  DESA\u2019s  Mirpur  distribution  circle  was  formally\ntransferred from DESA. At project appraisal, DESCO had completed nine months of operations.\nInitial  operating  performance  was  lower  than  originally  expected.  The  actual  number  of\nconsumers absorbed from DESA was considerably higher than DESA records indicated. This,\ncoupled with some initial start-up problems resulted in financial losses during these first few\nmonths  of  operation.  While  this  is  to  be  expected  from  a  start-up  company,  DESCO\nmanagement has been requested to implement measures to improve the overall situation.\n6. DESA commenced operations in 1991, upon separation from the Bangladesh Power\nDevelopment Board (BPDB). Legal title to distribution assets in the Dhaka Metropolitan Area\nwas transferred to DESA with the corresponding long-term domestic and foreign debt. After six\nyears of commercial operations, with dismal operational and financial performance, DESA has a\nnegative net worth as of 30 June 1998 of Tk.2,374 million.", "Appendix 8, page 2\nC Financial Projections\n1.  General\n7. The effect of the proposed Project on the financial position of PBCB, the seven PBSs,\nDESCO, and DESA are reflected in the financial projections for PGCB (presented in Tables\nA8.1 - A8.3), the PBSs (Tables A8.4-A8.6), DESCO (Tables A8.7-A8.9) and DESA (Tables\nA8.10-A8.12). These have been prepared on a nominal basis based on major assumptions\noutlined in the following paragraphs.\n8. Domestic inflation rates are assumed to be 7 percent for 1999, 5 percent for 2000, and\n4.5  percent  thereafter,  while  international  inflation  rates  are  assumed  to  be  2.4  percent\nthroughout the projection period.\n9. Although it is expected that the entire asset base of DESA will be absorbed by DESCO\nin the near future, the exact timing and details of the transfer were unclear at the time of project\nappraisal. As such, DESA financial performance is projected to 2020 in line with the projections\nprepared and presented for PGCB, the PBSs, and DESCO.\n2.  Revenues and Cost of Sales\na.  Transmission Revenues/Electricity Sales\n10. PGCB\u2019s revenues are derived from the transmission of electricity. A partial transfer of\ntransmission assets from BPDB was effected in October 1999. It has been assumed that the\ntransfer of assets associated with the Project will be completed by 1 July 2000 with the balance\nof BPDB transmission assets being transferred to PGCB by 1 July 2003.  For the purpose of the\nfinancial projections, it has been assumed that the transmission tariff will computed following a\nfull cost recovery methodology. An Operating and Maintenance provision has been assumed at\n2.0 percent of average fixed asset balance increased in line with domestic inflation. In addition\ndepreciation, foreign exchange losses and taxes have been covered by the tariff. It has been\nassumed that a gross margin on average historical fixed assets of 10 percent constitutes a\nreasonable return.\n11. For the purpose of the financial projections, it is assumed that the PBSs will assume\nownership of assets and the customer base associated with the Project by the end of December\n1999, and that DESCO will assume ownership of assets and the customer base of the Gulshan\nDistribution  Circle  by  1  July  2000.  Sales  projections  are  based  on  consumer  connection\nsummaries provided by REB and DESA. It is assumed that growth in electricity sales will result\nfrom (i) reduced brownouts and availability of additional power from the Independent Power\nProducer (IPP) plants; (ii) new consumption as a result of project investments; and (iii) new\nconsumption as a result of efficiency improvements.\nb. Electricity Importation\n12. The PBSs and DESCO purchase power from BPDB and DESA; DESA purchases power\ndirectly from BPDB. The amount of power purchased will be a function of consumer demand\nand system losses. According to PBS records, system losses, both technical and nontechnical,\nrange from 14 to 40 percent of bulk power purchases. It is assumed that through technical\nimprovements  and  efficiency  measures,  the  PBSs  will  be  able  to  reduce  the  losses  to\n14 percent over seven years after assuming operations of a  distribution area from  DESA.\nAccording  to  DESA  records,  historical  systems  losses,  both  technical  and  nontechnical,", "Appendix 8, page 3\namounted to 27  percent of bulk power  purchases for  the  Dhaka  Metropolitan  Area  (after\nsegregating the rural distribution areas handed over to the PBSs). It is assumed that through\ntechnical improvements and efficiency measures, that DESCO and DESA will be able to reduce\nsystems losses to 18 percent over a five-year period.\nc. Bulk Power Purchase and Retail Tariffs\n13. The PBSs, and DESA purchase power at a bulk selling rate. DESCO purchases power\nfrom DESA at the bulk rate plus a 2.5 percent wheeling charge. Since 1996, bulk power tariffs\nhave been reviewed and adjusted every six months with average increases of approximately\n3 to 4 percent per annum. With the commissioning of the IPP plants, the overall efficiency in the\ngeneration subsector is expected to improve dramatically, and the efficiency gains are expected\nto compensate for any increase in general price levels. As such, it is expected that the bulk\npower tariff will remain constant until 2003 and will increase in line with domestic inflation from\n2004 onward.\n14. The PBSs have the authority to set retail tariffs, with the exception of agricultural tariffs,\nwhich are established by the Government. Tariffs are reviewed regularly; the PBSs tend to\ncharge about 50 percent higher than DESA or DESCO. Given the projected stability in the bulk\npower tariff, it is assumed that the average retail tariff will level off and remain constant in real\nterms, therefore, the assumed growth in the weighted average retail tariff is limited to effects of\ndomestic inflation.\n15. It is assumed that DESCO will sell electricity to consumers following DESA\u2019s retail tariff\nstructure. DESA\u2019s retail tariffs are reviewed every six months, and since 1995, have been\nincreasing at a rate of approximately 8 percent per annum. However, given the projected\nstability of the bulk power tariff, it is assumed that the average retail tariff will level off and\nremain constant in real terms, therefore the assumed growth in the weighted average retail tariff\nis limited to the effects of domestic inflation.\n3.  Expenses\na.  Operating Expenses\n16. It is assumed that PGCB\u2019s operating expenses will include repairs and maintenance,\nmaterials  and  equipment,  salaries  and  wages,  contract  labor,  and  administrative  charges.\nFinancial projections are based on a budget prepared by the company and local costs are\nprojected to increase in line with domestic inflation. An average depreciation rate of 3.0 percent\nper annum is charged, on a declining balance basis, against the historical value of fixed assets.\nPreliminary expenses are amortized over a 10-year period commencing in 2001.\n17. It  is  assumed  that  the  PBSs  operating  expenses  include  distribution,  consumer\naccounts, consumer services, sales, administrative and general expenses, and depreciation.\nExpenses are based on historical performance, taking into consideration the impact of domestic\ninflation. An average depreciation rate of 3.0 percent per annum is charged, on a declining\nbalance basis, against the historical value of fixed assets.\n18. It is assumed that DESCO\u2019s operating expenses will include operation and maintenance,\ncommercial  (billing  and  collections),  salaries  and  wages,  depreciation,  amortization,  and\nadministrative charges. The level of operating expenses is  based on existing contracts, and\nbudgets prepared by DESCO taking into account the impact of domestic inflation. An average\ndepreciation rate of 5 percent per annum is charged, on a declining balance basis, against the", "Appendix 8, page 4\nhistorical value of fixed assets. Preliminary expenses and  computer  software development\nexpenditures are amortized over a five-year period commencing in 1999.\n19. It is assumed that DESA\u2019s operating expenses will include distribution, commercial,\ngeneral, administrative, and depreciation expense. Expense assumptions are based on DESA\u2019s\nhistorical  financial  performance  adjusted  to  reflect  the  impact  of  assets  and  operations\ntransferred to DESCO and the PBSs under ADB's  Ninth Power Project 1 and the proposed\nProject. An average depreciation rate of 3.2 percent per annum is charged, on a declining\nbalance basis, against fixed assets.\nb.  Interest Expense\n20. PGCB\u2019s current debt position was analyzed, and based on available information, an\namortization  schedule  was  prepared  to  project  annual  interest  expenditures.  PBCB  has\nassumed debt and equity associated with assets transferred from BPDB. In addition, future\ncapital expansion will be financed through a combination of equity, domestic and international\ndebt, and supplier\u2019s credit. Interest expense under Ninth Power Project was computed on the\nbasis of a Special Funds resources (SFR) service charge of 1 percent per annum together with\na domestic markup of 7 percent per annum. Interest expense for the Project loan is computed\non the basis of an ordinary capital resources (OCR) interest charge estimated at 7 percent per\nannum with a local mark-up of 1 percent per annum.\n21. The PBSs carry debt associated with capital expansion activities. The entire capital cost\nis  booked  as  debt  to  the  PBSs,  however,  the  interest  and  repayment  terms  are  heavily\nsubsidized. The existing debt situation at 30 June 1998 was analyzed and debt amortization and\ninterest expense used in the financial projections is based on that analysis. Interest expense for\nthe loan associated with the Project was computed on the basis of an SFR  interest charge of\n1.5 percent per annum with a local markup of 1.5 percent per annum. The PBSs are not\nresponsible for the foreign currency risk, as such, foreign-sourced borrowings are booked in\ndomestic currency.\n22. DESCO assumed debt and equity in association with the transfer of assets from DESA.\nIt is assumed that the interest rate on debt to DESA will be 8 percent per annum. The interest\nexpense on Ninth Power Project was computed on the basis of an SFR service charge of\n1 percent per annum together with a domestic markup of 7 percent per annum. Interest expense\nfor the project loan is computed on the basis of an OCR interest charge estimated 7 percent per\nannum with a local markup of 1 percent per annum. The existing and proposed Bank lending is\nthe only foreign debt held by DESCO.\n23. DESA carries a heavy debt burden,  with  significant domestic and foreign  currency\ndenominated debt. The existing debt situation as of 30 June 1998 was analyzed, and debt\namortization and interest expense is based upon that analysis. Interest expense on loan was\ncomputed on the basis of an SFR service charge of 1 percent together with a domestic markup\nof 7 percent per annum. Interest expense for the project loan was computed on the basis of an\nSFR interest charge of 1.5 percent per annum with a local markup of 6.5 percent per annum.\nc.  Tax Expense and Dividend Payment\n24. The PBSs, given their cooperative status, are exempt from payment of corporate income\ntax. For PGCB, DESCO, and DESA income tax is computed at 40 percent per annum. It is\n                                               \n1  Loan BAN 1505(SF):Ninth Power, for $134.4 million, approved on 18 December 1996.", "Appendix 8, page 5\nfurther assumed that PGCB and DESCO will be in a position to begin distributing dividends by\n2006. Dividends are assumed after taking into account future debt service obligations and\nworking capital requirements.\n4. Balance Sheet Assumptions\na.  Accounts Receivable\n25. Until such time as the entire balance of national transmission assets are transferred from\nBPDB to PGCB, it is assumed that the entire wheeling charge will be paid by BPDB, in its\ncapacity as power generator. The number of total customers is expected to be relatively small.\nAs such, it is assumed that accounts receivable will represent one month\u2019s sales and will\nbacked by a line of credit issued by the customers. As such, no provision is assumed for\ndoubtful accounts.\n26. Accounts receivable for the PBSs, as of 30 June 1998, on average represent almost\n5 months\u2019 total sales. It is assumed that as the PBSs gain operational experience, they will be\nable to reduce this, on average to 3 months by 2002. It is assumed that a provision for doubtful\naccounts will be maintained at 5 percent of the total accounts receivable balance.\n27. Following  9  months  of  initial  operations,  DESCO\u2019s  accounts  receivable  balance\nrepresented 6 months total sales. This was due in part to initial problems with the metering and\nbilling systems, which resulted in delayed production and presentation of invoices. As DESCO\nimproves its internal systems and gains operational experience, it is expected that accounts\nreceivable will represent 4 months, sales by the year 2000 and then will be maintained at\n2 months\u2019 sales thereafter. It has further assumed that a provision for doubtful accounts will be\nmaintained at 10 percent of the total accounts receivable balance.\n28. Accounts receivable for DESA, as of 30 June 1998, represented 12 month\u2019s sales. It has\nbeen assumed that 80 percent of this will be  recovered  over  a five-year period,  with  the\nremaining 20 percent written off over the same period. From 1999 onward, it is assumed that\naccounts receivable from new sales will represent 2 months sales. It is assumed that a provision\nfor doubtful accounts will be maintained at 10 percent of the accounts receivable balance.\nb. Inventory\n29. It  is  assumed  that  PGCB  and  DESCO  will  maintain  an  inventory  balance  of\napproximately 3 months usage of materials and spare parts, and that DESA will maintain an\ninventory balance of approximately 6 months usage of materials and spare parts. PBS inventory\nlevels are projected based upon existing levels adjusted for the planned capital expansion.\nc. Accounts Payable\n30. It has been assumed that PGCB\u2019s accounts payable will include 1 month of repairs and\nmaintenance,  contract  fees,  inventory  procurement,  and  administrative  charges.  It  is  also\nassumed that the PBSs accounts payable will include 2 months of  electricity import, 5 months\nother  operating expenses, and  six  months annual  procurement of  inventory  and  supplies.\nDESCO\u2019s accounts payable are assumed to include one month of electricity import, operation\nand maintenance, commercial, inventory procurement, and administrative expenditures.\n31. As  of  30  June  1998,  accounts  payable  from  DESA  to  BPDB  represented  almost\n12 months of electricity import. It is assumed that this will be reduced to 6 months by 2002.", "Appendix 8, page 6\nTrade accounts payable for DESA are assumed to represent two months of operation and\nmaintenance, commercial, inventory procurement, and administrative expenditures.\nd.  Capital Expenditures\n32. Capital  expenditures  are  based  on  the  ongoing  capital  expenditure  and  expansion\nprograms  for  PGCB,  the  PBSs,  DESCO,  and  DESA  to  2005.  Financing  for  the  planned\nexpenditures will be from domestic debt and equity, bilateral assistance, and supplier credit. For\nthe purposes of the financial projections, given the uncertainty for timing and amount of future\nexpenditures, it is assumed that no further investment in capital assets will be made after 2005.\ne.  Long-Term Debt\n33. As indicated in para. 23, PGCB\u2019s existing debt position was analyzed and based on\navailable  information,  an  amortization  schedule  was  prepared  to  project  annual  interest\nexpenditures,  foreign  exchange  losses  (on  foreign  denominated  debt),  and  debt  service\nobligations. It is assumed that the project loan will have a four-year grace period (to coincide\nwith the construction timetable) and a 16-year repayment period.\n34. As indicated in para. 24, the existing debt position of the PBSs was analyzed, and based\non available information, an amortization schedule was prepared to project annual interest\nexpenditures and debt service obligations. It is assumed that the project loan will be provided\nwith a 5-year grace period and a 20-year repayment period (onlending terms between REB and\nthe PBSs).\n35. DESCO\u2019s foreign-denominated, long-term debt is approximately $24.3 million provided\nunder loan 1505 and approximately $26.4 million for the proposed project loan. It is assumed\nthat the loan will be granted with a 4-year grace period and a 16-year repayment period.\nDESCO\u2019s domestic debt is limited to Tk405 million due to DESA as a result of the transfer of the\nMirpur and Gulshan distribution area assets. The transfer of assets, valued at DESA\u2019s net book\nvalue, has been assumed to be financed on a 60:40 debt to equity ratio. It is assumed that the\ndebt due to DESA will be provided with a 1-year grace period and a 15-year repayment period.\n36. As indicated in para. 26, the existing debt situation of DESA as of 30 June 1998 was\nanalyzed, and debt amortization  and  interest expense are based  upon  that analysis.  It  is\nassumed that the project loan will be provided with a 4-year grace period and a  16-year\nrepayment period.\nf.  Share Capital\n37. It is assumed that PGCB's share capital will increase due to (i) equity financing of assets\ntransferred from BPDB; (ii) counterpart financing under loan 1505; (iii) counterpart financing\nunder the Project; (iv) counterpart financing for ongoing expansion projects (i.e., not financed by\nthe ADB); and (v) additional equity contributions of Tk400 million for 2001-2002. It is assumed\nthat 64 percent of the domestic financing obligations of the Project will be financed through\nequity to comply with the overall debt-equity requirement for the Project of 70:30.\n38. The PBSs have a cooperative ownership structure. Rather than share capital, member's\nequity is derived from member\u2019s subscriptions. The entire project cost will be passed on from\nREB to the PBSs as a loan, denominated in taka and with concessionary terms; therefore, no\nincrease in member equity is projected.", "Appendix 8, page 7\n39. It is assumed that DESCO's share capital will increase due to (i) equity financing of asset\ntransfers from DESA; (ii) counterpart financing requirements under loan 1505; (iii) counterpart\nfinancing requirements under the Project; and (iv) additional equity contributions of Tk1,100 due\nfrom the Government during the 2000-2003. It is assumed that 75 percent of the domestic\nfinancing obligations of the Project will be financed through equity to comply with the debt-equity\nrequirement of 70:30.\n40. It  is  assumed  DESA  capital  will  increase  as  a  result  of  the  counterpart  financing\nrequirements  under  the  Project.

Introduction\n1. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out by the Power Grid Company of\nBangladesh  Ltd.  and  its  consultants  for  the  Dhaka  Power  System  Upgrade  Project.  The  IEE\nwas submitted to the Department of Environment (DOE) of the Ministry of Environment and Forest on\n4 July  1999.  The  DOE  issued  site  clearance  on  16  September  1999.  The  ADB\u2019s  environment\nspecialist visited the project site on 15 May 1999 to confirm the ADB\u2019s categorization of the Project as\ncategory B, a project with minor environmental impacts that could be easily mitigated using available\ntechnologies. The project components are described in paras. 40-42 of the main text.\nB. Description of the Environment\n2. The  project  sites  for  Part  A  consist  of  the  existing  Tongi,  Kalyanpur,  and  Hasnabad\nsubstations, additional 2,000 sqare meter (m2) beside the Kalyanpur substation, 20 acres of land for\nthe new Aminbazar substation and the 60 km right-of-way for the transmission facilities.  Tongi,\nKalyanpur, and Hasnabad substations are located in the mixed land uses, primarily industrial and\nresidential, areas that have sprouted up with the availability of more reliable power sources compared\nwith other areas of Dhaka. No new transformers will be installed at the existing premises of Tongi and\nHasnabad substations. Two bays with associated equipment and gantries will be installed each within\nthe  existing  premises  of  these  substations.  At  Kalyanpur  substation,  a  new  transformer  and\nassociated equipment and gantry structure will be installed; this requires additional 2,000 m2 of land to\nbe  acquired  from  an  adjacent  vacant  industrial  land  owned  by  a  state  agency  of  Bangladesh\nAgricultural Development Corporation. The area to be used for expansion of the substation facilities in\nthose areas was cleared and is being maintained for future expansion. The lands are fenced by a 3-m\nhigh concrete wall, and all installations including the proposed expansion are built 3 m from the wall\nfor security purposes. Part B and Part C will not require acquisition of land except about 0.4 hectare of\nland for a new 132 kilovolt (kV) substation at Kamrangichar in Dhaka.\n3. The 20 acres of land to be acquired for the Aminbazar substation is between two existing\ntransmission lines and approximately 200 m away from the highway. It is part of an artificial lagoon\nthat has developed from the manufacture of bricks and was to be a source of fill materials for earlier\nreal estate development in Dhaka. Brick production is still ongoing at the other side of the highway.\nThe area has marginal uses although some merchants have started to fill the area adjacent to the\nhighway to build stores. Aminbazar is on the outer fringe of Dhaka.\n4. The air and water quality around Tongi, Aminbazar, Kalyanpur, and Hasnabad are polluted\nfrom industrial and domestic waste discharges. Most of the industries in Tongi and Kalyanpur are in\ntextile and garment manufacturing, which require large quantities of hot water. The factories operate\nboilers using fuel oil and sometimes using wastes and scrap materials. The boilers have little or no\npollution control facilities. The storm drains are also the main receivers of wastewater discharges.\nDyes  and  highly  colored  wastewater  are  discharged  in  the  storm  drains.  Hasnabad  is  less\nindustrialized. The northern portion of Hasnabad substation is bounded by the Buriganga River.\nFerryboats serving Dhaka and other parts of the country use the riverbanks in the vicinity of the\nsubstation. The eastern and southern sections are cultivated with rice. The western section is a mixed\nindustrial and residential area.\n5. From  Tongi  substation,  the  transmission  line  will  pass  2  km  of  mixed  land  use  area\nsurrounding the substation. The air and water quality in this section is heavily polluted. Then the\ntransmission line right-of-way will move in parallel to the outer section of the flood control bund\nprotecting Dhaka city and 50 m from an existing transmission line through Aminbazar to Hasnabad.\nThe area outside of the bund is subject to 4 m flood during the peak of the monsoon season. The air", "Appendix 9, page 2\nand water quality in this section is relatively unpolluted. The main source of air pollution is from\nvehicular traffic and industries transported from the other side of the bund. As the water level on this\nside of the bund is often higher than in the heavily populated section of Dhaka, contamination is\nminimal. The transmission line will pass through some built up areas near the Savar Highway and\nclose to the proposed Aminbazar substation and in the vicinity of the Hasnabad substation.\n6. The land in Tongi, Kalyanpur, Aminbazar, and Hasnabad substations has been utilized for\nindustrial and residential purposes for a long time. For safety purposes, the open space within the\nsubstation was cleared of grasses and other vegetation, which  could accidentally flare up.  The\nperimeter clearance was cemented to facilitate movement of maintenance equipment and  crew.\nNative flora and fauna have long been dislocated in adjacent industrial and residential areas. The\nexisting flora and fauna are typical of urban ecology consisting mostly of household pets, insects and\ndomesticated animals.\n7. The ecology in the proposed Aminbazar substation is aquatic. It is expected that only plants\noccurring in seasonally flooded condition will be met in the project area. No forested vegetation was\nobserved in the project area. The aquatic flora and fauna have little or no commercial value nor are\nthey endangered or protected. The area is an artificial lagoon.\n8. The flora and fauna in the transmission line right-of-way varies from those of urban ecology in\nbuilt up areas such as those around the substations.  Most of the area transversed by the right-of-way\nis flooded for most of the year.  When the land is not flooded it is cultivated with rice and aquatic\nvegetables. Within the project area, there is no natural forest vegetation. The terrestrial flora of the\nproject consists mainly homestead plants. In addition, a large number of fruit and horticultural crops\nare  grown  in  the  homestead.  This  include  mango,  (Mangifera  indica)  jackfruit,  (Artocarpus\nheteroaphylla), coconut, Cocos nucifera Khoir (Treca catcha) bel (Aegel marmolos), etc. The area has\nbeen disturbed by agricultural activities for a long time and there are no endangered and protected\nspecies in the area.\n9. The filling materials will be dredged from the Turag/Buriganga River. The riverbed in the\nsections  around  Dhaka  has  been  polluted  from  untreated  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater\ndischarges. The benthic communities in the river have been dislocated for a long time. The large\nerosion rate and subsequent dredging operations to maintain the transportation and flood control\nfunctions of the river has further disturbed the benthic communities.  There are about 260 species of\nfreshwater fishes recorded for the whole country. Seasonal variation of the flooding regime has\nmarked variation on the ecology, biology, and behavior of the fish. The most common fish observed in\nthe open water aquatic habitat are rui, cattla, kalibush, pabda, pangas, etc. in the rivers; and koi,\nmagur, singh, sarputi, mola, tengra in the beels. Due to increasing pollution load and overexploitation\nthe fisheries resources are dwindling very fast. In the closed water habitats particularly in ponds,\nsome exotic fishes are reared including, silver carps, tilapia, panpsa, and Thai magur.\nD. Screening of Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigating Measures\n10. The potential environmental impacts of the expansion of the substation facilities at Tongi,\nKalyanpur, and Hasnabad are minor and reversible, as they mostly related to construction activities.\nThe  environmental  impacts  are  mostly  related  to  noise,  dust,  and  traffic  from  movement  of\nconstruction materials, heavy equipment, and construction workers.\n11. The filling operation for Aminbazar substation will reduce the size of the lagoon by 20 acres.\nThe filling operation will increase the lagoon turbidity. The benthic communities in the 8-hectare area\nwill be destroyed. This is a residual impact of the project. Migratory aquatic life will migrate and be\ndisplaced from this area. However as mentioned in para. 9, the aquatic life and flora have little or no", "Appendix 9, page 3\ncommercial value nor are they endangered or protected species. The construction activities after the\nfilling operation are similar to those in the other substations.\n12. The equipment to be used in the substations will conform to existing standards for electrical\nequipment and will not contain polychlorinated biphenyl for cooling agent in transformers. Asbestos\nwill not be used as an insulating agent.\n13. Noise from the transformers is low frequency noise and is damped by the perimeter walls. In\nTongi, Kalyanpur, and Hasnabad, the noise from the factories surrounding the substation is several\nmagnitudes higher than those generated by the transformers. The noise level measured from those\nareas varied from 62 to 77 decibels.\n14. There are seven abandoned 230 kV towers right at the end of Tongi substation. These towers\ncannot be used as they are not designed for the type of conductor to be used for the Project. The line\nroute may, however, be used, and new towers may be installed near the locations of these existing\nabandoned towers. Inconvenience and disturbance may be felt by the residents during construction of\nthe transmission lines. For the 50 km stretch of the transmission line, few permanent structures will\nhave to be relocated.  The houses will be relocated in adjacent areas outside the transmission line\nright-of-way.  The cultivators will be allowed to cultivate the land in the transmission line of right-of-\nway as currently practiced, i.e., the flooded sections are cultivated only during the dry season.\n15. The impact of the Project on the socioeconomic conditions of the service area is primarily\npositive. At present Dhaka City is experiencing frequent load-shedding up to six hours per day. The\nfrequent fluctuation in power voltage has resulted in rapid deterioration of household appliances and\nindustrial machinery. Efficiencies in industries and commercial establishments have been affected by\nload-shedding especially the small- and medium-scale industries that could not afford to buy their own\nelectric  generators.  Large  hotels  and  industries  buy  diesel-driven  electric  generators  often\nsecondhand equipment. The secondhand generators are often polluting with low electric-generating\nefficiencies.\nE. Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring\n16. During construction, PGCB will appoint an environmental and safety manager who will be\nsupported by three qualified engineers. The environmental and safety engineer will report directly to\nthe project director. The environmental and safety engineer will be responsible for monitoring the\ncompliance of the Project to all safety and environmental requirements of the government as well as\nthe mitigating measures identified in the IEE report.\n17. During the operation and maintenance of the Project, PGCB will appoint a suitably qualified\nengineer as safety and environmental officer who will report directly to the managing director. The\nenvironmental and safety engineer will be responsible for checking that the workplace procedures\ncomply with the environmental and safety standards of the industry as required by the Government.\nThe environmental and safety engineer will be also the focal person in the event that the Executing\nAgency applies for International Standard Organization certification. The PGCB will submit to ADB\nannually a copy of all licenses and permits required by the relevant agency of the Government for\nenvironmental and safety regulations. In the event that the Project is cited for violation of any safety\nand environmental standards within the reporting period, PGCB will submit to ADB a certification that\nthe defect has been corrected or an acceptable plan has been submitted to the relevant government\nagency.", "Appendix 9, page 4\nF. Findings and Recommendations\n18. The project environmental impact is minor and temporary and can be easily mitigated using\navailable technologies. The negative impacts of the Project are related to the construction activities.\nThe main residual impacts of the Project are related to the filling of artificial lagoon in Aminbazar\ncovering approximately 8 hectares and resulting in the displacement of benthic ecology in this area\nand dislocation of some aquatic flora and fauna. However, the aquatic flora and fauna are not\nendangered or protected nor do they have commercial value. The fill materials used in Aminbazar\nsubstation are left over from the dredging of the rivers and channels in Dhaka. The land in Aminbazar\nis basically a disposal area for the dredged materials.\nG. Conclusion\n19. The IEE reveals no significant adverse impact on the environment that cannot be mitigated.\nThe preparation of a detailed environmental impact assessment is not deemed necessary.", "Appendix 10, page 1\nSUMMARY LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT PLAN\nA. Background\n1. The proposed Dhaka Power System Upgrade Project involves construction of substations,\nand transmission and distribution facilities in the Greater Dhaka Area.  Almost all land acquisition\nand right of way activities will occur under Part A and affect a total of 2,000 square meters (m2) for\nKalyanpur substation, 20 acres of land for the Aminbazar substation, and 60 kilometers (km) of\nright-of-way for the transmission facilities. Part B and Part C will not require acquisition of land\nexcept about 0.4 hectare of land for a new 132 kilovolt (kV) substation at Kamrangichar in Dhaka.\nThe land proposed to be acquired for Aminbazar substation is private land that floods each year\nduring the monsoon and therefore does not support any permanent residents or activities. It is\nlargely used as a source of \"borrow\" earth to fill other sites. However, it is possible that in the dry\nseason some of this land may be used for temporary shelters or marginal farming. The main\nimpact of the project would occur during the stringing of the transmission lines. Possible impacts\ncould include damage to crops and displacement of persons although this would be only by about\nten meters in each case. It was assessed that these impacts are not significant and can be\nmitigated by (i) minimizing such impact through careful routing of the transmission line, and (ii)\nthrough  paying  adequate  compensation.  The  only  potentially  significant  impact  is  that  of\nresettlement, which affects a maximum of about 100 persons, mostly migrant slum dwellers and\nsemipermanent residents. This number can be reduced significantly through a proper delineation\nof the transmission lines. Compensation will be paid to all those affected.\nB. Good Practice\n1. Impact Minimization\n2. To minimize impact, the following guidelines for tower spotting will be observed:\n(i) The alignment will avoid, without exception, religious structures, and educational\ninstitutions.\n(ii) As far as may be practicable, the alignment will avoid houses (permanent or\ntemporary). In particular, special care will be taken to avoid human settlement\nclusters. Where unavoidable, the ground clearance will be increased to at least 10\nmeters so that no resettlement is necessitated.\n(iii) Where road and river crossing is unavoidable, prescribed vertical and horizontal\nclearance requirements will be strictly adhered to.\n(iv)  The proposed alignment will be submitted on  a no-objection basis to (at least) the\nfollowing  Archaelogocial  Survey,  Wildlife  Conservation  Agency,  Inland  Water\nTransport Authority, and Highway Department. These authorities will have 30 days\nto formally object to the project.\n(v) Compensation in terms of country and ADB norms will be paid to owners of all\nproperty, including crops, orchard trees, homesteads, water sources, etc., following\nprescribed procedures.\n2. Resettlement Principles\n3. Based on ADB Policy for Involuntary Resettlement, the following principles were  identified\nas being applicable for this activity for the Project:", "Appendix 10, page 2\n(i) The  principal  objective  of  involuntary  settlement  policies  is  to  ensure  that\npopulations affected by the Project should be at least as well off, if not better off\nthan they would have been without the Project. Affected populations should be\nable to maintain, and preferably improve their standard of living and quality of life.\n(ii) The populations affected by the Project are defined as those who stand to lose, as\na consequence of the Project, all or part of physical and nonphysical assets,\nincluding homes, homesteads, productive lands, commercial properties, tenancy,\nincome-earning opportunities, social and cultural activities and relationships, and\nother losses that may be identified during the process of resettlement planning.\nA preliminary socioeconomic survey was carried out as part of the routing of the\ntransmission line and the findings were filed with the deputy office. These will\nrepresent the cutoff date for compensation eligibility for physical assets as these\nwere identified.  Affected populations will receive fair (market-based replacement\ncost)  compensation  for  all  losses,  including  physical  and  nonphysical  assets.\nCompensation  will  include  not  only  immediate  losses,  but  also  opportunities\nforegone. Affected populations who stand to lose only part of their physical assets\nwill not be left with a proportion inadequate to sustain their current standard of\nliving, such a  minimum was  identified  and  agreed  to  during  the  resettlement\nplanning process.\n(iii) All affected populations will be equally eligible for compensation and mitigative\nmeasures, irrespective of tenurial status, social or economic standing, and any\nsuch factors that may discriminate against achieving the objectives outlined.\n(iv) Involuntary resettlement will be minimized by identifying possible alternative project\ndesigns; and appropriate social, economic, operational, and engineering solutions\nthat have the least impact on populations in the project area. As it is possible to\nidentify the affected population only during the actual stringing of the transmission\nlines, a short resettlement plan will be prepared for the affected populations and\nspecifying  those  affected,  all  losses  that  might  be  incurred,  and  appropriate\nmitigative measures.\n(v) Adequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  be  made  available\nto cover the costs of land acquisition within the agreed implementation period.\nThe project  performa  prepared  by  Power  Grid  Company  of  Bangladesh\nLtd. For the Hasnabad-Aminbazar  (Savar)-Tongi  and  the  Haripur-Meghnaghat\n230kV transmission line contains two cost items for this purpose.  An allocation of\nTk3.88 million for right-of-way payments and of Tk129 million for land acquisition\nfor substations is included on page 15, item 1 (c) of the project performa budget.\n(vi) Construction activities will not commence until the required lands have been fully\nacquired and populations appropriately relocated in accordance with the principles\nset out.\n(vii) Appropriate reporting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms will be identified\nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system.  Evaluation of the\nresettlement process and the final outcome will be conducted independent of the\nExecuting Agency.\n4. The current legislation governing land acquisition for public purposes in Bangladesh is\nthe Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance (Ordinance II of 1982) and its\nsubsequent  amendments  in  1993  and  1994.  In  accordance  with  the  ordinance,  the  legal\nprocess is initiated by an application by the requiring agency or department to the deputy", "Appendix 10, page 3\ncommissioner  of  the  district.  In  determining  the  amount  of  compensation  for  the  affected\nowners, the deputy commissioner takes into consideration a number of factors, e.g., present\nmarket rate to determine the value of the land. As there is no national policy for resettlement of\nproject-affected people in Bangladesh, ADB Policy on Involuntary Resettlement will guide the\nresettlement plan.\nC. Project Compensation Policy and Entitlement Matrix\n5. The  project  compensation  policy  and  entitlement  matrix  was  designed  to  cover\ncompensation for lost assets and restore or enhance the livelihoods of all categories (direct,\nindirect, title holders, and nontitle-holders) of affected people. The affected persons will not only\nreceive replacement land or cash for land and other assets at market price, many additional\nmeasures will be taken, e.g. moving allowance, assistance to household headed by women, to\nhelp the project-affected persons to regain or improve their lives in the postresettlement period.\nTable A10.1 explains the various compensation and entitlement policies applicable under the\nProject.\nType of Losses                                        Policy\n1 Loss of land due to \u2022  All kinds of land (including homestead and commercial\nacquisition plots) acquired will be compensated in kind (i.e.,\nreplacement land) or cash (i.e., average sales value plus\n50 percent due to compulsory acquisition) by district\ncommissioner\u2019s office\n\u2022  Additional cash grant based on market value of the land\n2 Loss of standing crops, \u2022  Cash compensation for trees based on age and value of\ntrees and perennials fruit over its lifetime.\n\u2022  Standing crops are valued at market prices\n3 Loss of living quarters \u2022  Cash compensation under law by DC for loss of structure\n(leased/rented)/temporary\nCommercial or other \u2022  One-time cash grant for alternative shelters at replacement\nstructures on the ROW value\n4 Shifting or moving \u2022  Shifting or moving allowance to affected households\nAllowance \u2022  Additional assistance for households headed by women to\nhire help for relocation\n5 Loss of employment/work \u2022  One-time cash grant for loss of income/work opportunities\n6 Income (daily wage \u2022  Additional assistance to vulnerable groups such as women\nlaborers, CBE employees, and landless workers for alternative income-generating\nand others indirectly program\naffected) due to\ndislocation and disruption\nDC - District Collector\nROW - Right of Way", "72\nAppendix 11\nCONSUMER CONNECTION SUMMARY\nExisting (1999) Total (1999-2003) Project Only\nNo. Number Number Number\nof % of of % of of % of\nConsumers Total Consumers Total Consumers Total\n(Incremental)\n1.

An economic evaluation for the entire Project consisting of transmission and distribution\ninvestments was undertaken, and the results are summarized here. Details of the economic\ninternal rate of return (EIRR) calculations are shown in Table A13.3, results of the switching\nvalue analysis are in Table A13.1, and the findings of the sensitivity analysis are given in Table\nA13.2.\n2. As the Project is specifically targeting the greater Dhaka area, there are only three major\nconsumer segments, domestic, commercial, and industrial, for which economic benefits were\ncalculated.  For each of the 13 distribution circles included in the Project the incremental power\nsupply was calculated and the breakdown for each consumer segment was analyzed. Economic\nbenefits were then calculated separately for each distribution circle and consumer segment.\n3. The shares of electricity supply assumed to replace an alternative energy source in each\nconsumer category were based on existing load-shedding data in each distribution circle. It is\nassumed that over a period of four years load-shedding will be eliminated in all circles covered\nunder the Project. New consumers will also be connected to the grid in each distribution circle\nover a four-year period. Their consumption in the first year after being connected to the grid is\nconsidered to replace other fuels and to result in economic resource cost saving. That is, the\neconomic cost of alternative energy, which the country saves by using electricity, is considered\nan economic benefit of the Project.\n4. The shares of incremental electricity supply corresponding to induced consumption for\nnewly connected consumers are assumed to grow rapidly for four years before normalizing. The\nassumed annual growth rates are 10, 15,13, and 10 percent before settling to normal growth at\n5  percent  per  annum.  Induced  consumption  was  valued  by  estimating  the  consumer\u2019s\nwillingness to pay for this part of incremental electricity supply. Given the sensitivity of demand\nto price for the various categories of consumers, only a portion of the maximum consumer\u2019s\nsurplus benefits  is assumed for the valuation of induced sales.\n5. Alternative  sources  of  power  used  by  the  three  major  consumer  segments  were\ndetermined, and their respective costs were estimated. It was found that the dominant sources\nof alternative power in the domestic sector are kerosene lamps and inverter batteries.  Private\nownership of small-sized diesel generators is very low and prevailing only among very high-\nincome urban consumers, and can thus not be considered for the purpose of estimating the\nwillingness-to-pay. A large proportion of total end-consumption in the domestic sector is used\nfor lighting purposes and to run small appliances like televisions, fans and radios. During power\ncuts, substitution of electricity is almost exclusively for lighting purposes. Therefore, economic\nbenefits for the replacement portion of alternative energy sources were valued at an economic\ncost of kerosene lamps at Tk5.2 per kilowatt hour (kWh). Induced consumption was valued\nusing the willingness-to-pay method plus the related consumer surplus with a curvature factor of\n0.3. However, the calculation was based on the use of inverter batteries as the alternative\nenergy source as induced consumption is more likely used for small appliances. The financial\ncost of using inverter batteries was estimated at Tk3.6 per kWh.\n6. Commercial sector use of alternative sources is represented by a mixture of small and\nmedium-size  generators  and  for  very  small  establishments  of  kerosene  lamps.  To\naccommodate the difference in use, two sizes of generators are included in the calculation. The\nconsumption  share  of  the  commercial  sector  was  divided  equally  between  2  and  5  kW", "Appendix 13, page 2\ngenerators for the calculation of benefits. Average economic cost of alternative energy sources\nfor commercial establishments has been estimated at Tk8.81 for a 2 kW generator and at\nTk5.28 for a 5 kW generator. A curvature factor of 0.4 was used in the calculations.\n7. As a result of the persistent power shortages in Bangladesh the industry sector has\ninstalled a large number of alternative sources of energy. Officially, 400 megawatts (MW) of\nprivate generation capacity exist in the country, which corresponds to about a fifth of the public\npower plants currently operating.1 Captive power facilities cover a wide range of unit sizes and\nplant  types  with  the  most  dominant  being  large  diesel  generator  sets.  The  average  cost\ndepends on the size of the generator and was estimated to lie between Tk5.25 per kWh for a\n240 kW generator and Tk5.5 per kWh for a 500kW generator.  As for the commercial segment,\na curvature factor of 0.4 was used.\n8. For  the  purposes  of  the  economic  analysis,  the  estimated  capital  costs  of  the\ntransmission and distribution components have been broken down into direct foreign exchange\nitems, indirect foreign exchange, and local goods and services. All costs elements are valued\nin border prices, using a domestic currency numeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded.\nA standard conversion factor of 0.855 is applied to nontraded items and a labor conversion\nfactor of 0.9 is used. Operating costs were calculated as a fixed percentage of economic\ninvestment cost. For the transmission component this percentage is kept constant over the\nevaluation period, while for the distribution component it is assumed that after five years of\noperation the percentage is increased to reflect higher maintenance needs.\n9. The economic benefits of transmission and distribution facilities required to evacuate\npower  from  new  generation  projects,  such  as  Haripur  IPP,  are  difficult  to  determine\nindependently.  Transmission  and  distribution  are  integral  parts  of  the  total  power  system\ndevelopment plan and not independent investments. The EIRR on the complete investment\nrequired in new generation projects plus associated transmission and distribution are normally\nconsidered as representative of the rate of return on transmission and distribution investments,\nas they are typically only a part of the total investment.\n10. Therefore,  the  economic  evaluations  of  transmission  and  distribution  components\ninclude  economic  sent-out  costs  of  power.  The  Project  specifically  targets  constructing\ntransmission and  distribution facilities  needed  to  evacuate  power  from  the  newly  solicited\nindependent power producers for about 1,400 MW of generating capacity. A number of IPP\nagreements have been concluded among them are independent power producers for about\n400 MW from barge-mounted plants of which 100 MW is already being produced. Another\n890 MW, including the Meghnaghat and Haripur plants have almost reached financial closure.\nLatest calculations of the long-run marginal cost (LRMC), which took into account the IPPs sent-\nout costs, show that the current LRMC in Bangladesh is about 30 per cent below its 1994 level.\nThis can mainly be attributed to lower unit investment costs and the higher fuel efficiency of new\ngas plants. Also, the economic cost of gas declined based on the actual costs incurred in\ndeveloping new gas fields. Consequently, the bid prices for sent-out energy received from the\nfirst IPPs were unexpectedly low, although higher than actual gas prices have already been\nassumed in the IPPs. However, to be more conservative, the economic evaluation used the\nweighted average of IPP sent-out cost instead of the recalculated LRMC.\n                                               \n1 According to the World Bank  1998, Energy Strategy Note.", "Appendix 13, page 3\n11.

Introduction\n1. Assessment of the socioeconomic impact of electrification is essential to gauge whether\noverarching poverty reduction goals of electrification are being met. Thus, in the context of the\nBank's Dhaka Power System Upgrade Project, the Bank is attempting to quantitatively and\nqualitatively  assess  the  socioeconomic  benefits  of  electrification,  and  improved  electricity\nsupply, in the Greater Dhaka Area with a special emphasis on the urban poor.\nB.  Scope of Work\n2. The consultants will determine through surveys, interviews, and  scrutiny of existing\nrecords,  the  (i)  actual  energy expenditures  in electrified  and  nonelectrified  households  for\ncomparable energy outputs; (ii) impact of electrification on productive activities; (iii) impact of\nelectrification  on  household  income  and  household  expenditures,  education,  and  social\nactivities; (iv) impact of electrification on public service institutions to include hospitals, clinics,\nschools, and related delivery agencies; and (v) impact of electrification on small and medium\nenterprises (SME).\n3. Tasks to be carried out by the consultants will include but not be limited to:\n(i)  selecting sample households reflecting different income levels, income sources,\nelectrified and nonelectrified households, and households with cottage industries\nand without;\n(ii)  selecting sample public service institutions and SMEs;\n(iii)  designing the questionnaires;\n(iv)  conducting interviews;\n(v)  cross-checking results with area officials, community leaders, and retailers (for\ncost indications);\n(vi)  analyzing and evaluating the collected data; and\n(vii)  preparing the final report\nC.  Outline Terms of Reference\n4. Three different consumer categories are included under the study: households, public\nservice institutions, and SMEs. For each of the categories, the specific link to electrification will\nbe established and WTP/ATP will be determined, as follows:\na. Domestic Consumers:\n5. The study will establish a link to household income by answering the following questions;\n(i)  How  does  electrification  relate  to  household  income  and  expenditure  in\ncomparison with nonelectrified households?\n(ii)  What is the pattern of wages, agricultural, and cottage industry income, and how\ndoes it relate to energy consumption?\n(iii)  Is there a link between electrification and higher profit (higher income)?\n(iv)  How does electrification relate to education, medical services, information, etc.?", "Appendix 14, page 2\n6. The study will gather day-to-day energy related information, e.g.:\n(i)  Identify which energy sources are used and how many times per day; if possible\nattention should be paid to gender differentiation in energy use, in particular in\ncottage industries.\n(ii)  Determine length of use per source and the cost per use per source.\n(iii)  Establish the activities avoided due to lack of energy that could be a result of\nload-shedding; insufficient cash to pay for fuel for nonelectricity energy sources;\nor of insufficient lumen produced by sources.\n7. Data should be collected to determine, e.g.\n(i)  the cost of existing energy sources per activity like cooking, lighting, and heating\nand to run appliances;\n(ii)  household expenditure on water, television, sewage disposal, municipal taxes,\ntransportation;\n(iii)  the most preferred energy sources per activity and indicate the reason;\n(iv)  willingness  and  ability-to-pay  for  electrification;  this  could  be  established  by\ninquiring if households could afford cost of wiring and how they would finance\nthis;\n(v)  perception of monetary losses due to inadequate energy supply and to link this\nperception to willingness-to-pay.\nb. Public Service Institutions\n8. The study will assess the adequacy of electricity/alternate energy sources, and their\ncontribution to an efficient delivery of public services, e.g.:\n(i)  Is there general satisfaction with service delivery, if not, what are the required\nimprovements?\n(ii)  Who pays for the cost of electricity/alternate energy source?\n(iii)  What are the future energy/electricity requirements, and can the institution afford\nthe cost;\n(iv)  If additional energy is required, how will it contribute to increased service delivery\nand client benefit?\n9. On the basis of the data establish:\n(i)  affordability and willingness to pay; and\n(ii)  recommendations, as relevant, for how increased costs will be met.\nc. Micro and Small Enterprises\n10. The study will establish a link between provision of reliable electricity services and\nexpansion of SME business turnover and employment, e.g.:\n(i)  Describe the production activities and employment capacity of the SMEs in the\ncontext of their contribution to the economy.\n(ii)  Identify how current energy requirements and energy costs are met;\n(iii)  Determine if the availability of energy is linked to production and profit.", "Appendix 14, page 3\n(iv)  Outline the future requirements for energy and how will this contribute to greater\nefficiency and expansion of the sector, including additional employment.\n11. On the basis of the data established, a link will be established on the willingness and\nability to pay for electrification (new or additional)."], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060324162003+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20000106095206Z", "Title": "Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Two Proposed Loans to the ", "Creator": "PSCRIPT.DRV Version 4.0", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows"}}
