The major sector  constraints  were  (i)  lack  of  institutional  capability;  (ii)  unavailability  of\nlong-term domestic capital for financing investments; (iii) limited foreign exchange debt service\ncapability  of  the  economy;  (iv)  poor  management  systems  and  procedures;  (v)  low  employee\ncommitment;  and  (vi)  institutional  weaknesses  in  banking,  law  enforcement,  and  judicial\nprocesses, which are external to the sector but are essential for its proper functioning.\n\n3.\n  In  1994,  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  (the  Government)  adopted  a  paper  titled\n\"Power Sector Reforms in Bangladesh\" (PSRB)  which  was formulated  in  consultation  with the\nmajor power sector funding agencies1. The PSRB outlines  the  reform process  proposed  to be\nfollowed  by  the  Government  to  gradually  remove  sector  constraints  by  improving  sector  and\ncorporate  governance,  introducing  competition  and  facilitating  public-private  partnerships.\nReform of the external environment was to be introduced through targeted interventions in the\npower sector.\n\n4.\nIn accordance with the PSRB, the power sector in Bangladesh has been undergoing a\ngradual  structural  change.  The  funding  agencies  have  been  supporting  this  change  through\ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  planning  and  institutional  strengthening,  as  well  as  capital  for\nsystem expansion, in line with the principle of reform-linked assistance. The proposed Project,\nwhich  is  the  third  assistance  provided  by  ADB  in  support  of  the  reform  process,  is  a  part  of\nADB\u2019s 1999 country assistance program for Bangladesh. The Project is an integral part  of  the\nleast-cost  development  plan  for  the  power  sector,  and  is  accorded  high  priority  by  the\nGovernment.  The  Project  was  appraised  in  May  1999.2      Appendix  1  provides  the  project\nframework.\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n5.\nThe power sector is organized under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. The\nthe  Ministry,  wholly  owns  and supervises  the  Bangladesh  Power\nGovernment,  through \nDevelopment Board (BPDB), Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority (DESA), and Rural Electrification\nBoard (REB), which are its three executing agencies (EAs) in the sector. Until FY1998, BPDB was\nresponsible for all generation and most of the transmission in the country, and also for distribution\nin district towns, municipalities, and some rural areas, while DESA was responsible for distribution\nin Dhaka, the capital. Electricity distribution  in  most  of the  rural areas  is the  responsibility of the\n54 rural  electric  cooperatives,  the  Palli  Bidyut  Samities  (PBSs),  which  are  organized,  initially\n\n                                               \n1  The  ADB,  World  Bank,  Department  For  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr\nWiederaufbau  of  Germany,  the  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund  of  Japan  (now  the  Japan  Bank  for\nInternational  Cooperation),  and  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development.  The  ADB  is  the  aid\ncoordinator to the power sector and  has  played  a major  role  in  drawing  up the  reform  assistance  strategy  of  the\nfunding agencies.\n\n2  The  Appraisal  Mission  comprised  S.  Chander,  Mission  Leader  and  Senior  Project  Engineer;  S.  Bajpai,  Senior\nPrograms  Officer;  S.  Nanwani,  Senior  Counsel;  E.  Ouano,  Senior  Environmental  Specialist;  K. Moktan,  Senior\nFinancial  Analyst;  S.  Ahmed,  Senior  Project  Officer;  D. Graczyk,  Project  Economist;  and  P.  B.  Song,  Project\nEngineer.\n\n\f2\n\nfunded, and monitored by REB. Recently, as part of the sector reform process, new public sector\nentities such as the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Ltd.  (PGCB) and  the  Dhaka Electric\nSupply Company Ltd. (DESCO), as well as private sector independent power producers (IPPs)\nsuch as the Rural Power Company Ltd. (RPC),3 the Meghnaghat AES Power Company Ltd. and\nthe Haripur AES Power Company Ltd., have been constituted. It is expected that over the next\nfew  years  these  companies  will  own  and  operate  a  substantial  part  of  the  power  sector\u2019s\ngenerating  assets.  The Government, BPDB,  DESA,  and  REB  have  taken  steps  to  involve  the\nprivate  sector  by  (i) adopting  a  private  power  generation  policy  in  October  1996;  and  (ii)\nawarding  contracts  for  about  1,400  megawatts  MW  of  generating  capacity  on  a  build-own-\noperate (BOO) basis. Sector performance has been mixed, and the performance of most of the\nPBSs has been much better than that of BPDB or DESA (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Comparison of the Performance of Power Sector Utilities During FY1999\n\nUtility\n\nGeneration Share\n\nDistribution Share\n\nGWh\n\n%\n\nGWh\n\n%\n\nDistribution\nLosses\n(% of imports)\n\nRevenue\nCollections\n(% of billings)\n\nBPDB\nIPPs\nDESA\nDESCO 1\nREB(PBSs)\nTotal\n\n12,872\n816\n         -\n-\n         -\n13,688\n\n94\n6\n         -\n-\n         -\n100\n\n3,725\n-\n3,362\n205\n1,989\n9,281\n\n40\n-\n36\n2\n22\n100\n\n23\n-\n25\n41\n19\n23\n\n71\n-\n75\n58\n92\n\n1    Part year only.\n\n6.\nBangladesh\u2019s  annual  per  capita  electricity  consumption  of  70  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  in\nFY1998  was  the  third  lowest  among  ADB's  developing  member  countries  after  Nepal  and\nCambodia.4  Despite  intensive  efforts  to  increase  coverage,  only  about  18  percent  of  the\npopulation has access to electricity.5  Consumption  of electricity  increased at an average annual\nrate of 8.5  percent from FY1994 to FY1999, with major increases in industrial and residential use.\nThe ADB-financed Power System  Master Plan  (PSMP)  study  6   assessed    that  the  demand  for\nelectricity will increase by about 8 percent per year; and the peak demand will be about 3,500 MW\nby FY2000, although this looks extremely unlikely given the supply constraints in the sector. The\ncurrent installed capacity is 3,611 MW, of which about 2,700 MW is available, the rest being shut\ndown for rehabilitation or major maintenance.\n\nInadequate supply of electricity is a major constraint to economic growth. During FY1999,\n7.\nload-shedding ranging from 16 to 774 MW, was resorted to on 335 days for a total duration of\n1,690 hours.  Inadequate gas  supply  was partly  responsible for  lower power generation during\nthe  year.  Although  the  gas  supply  situation  has  improved,  load-shedding  will  continue  until\nsubstantial  new  generation  capacity  is  added  to  the  system  to  (i)  replace  very  old  power\nstations,  (ii)  allow  for  routine  preventive  maintenance  by  creating  a  reserve  margin,  and\n(iii) meet  the  increased  demand.  Erratic  power  supply  has  tended  to  increase  consumers'\n\n                                               \n3  The Rural Power Company Ltd. has 49 percent of its shares held by the private sector and 51 percent by the public\nsector.  In  accordance  with  the  covenants  under  ADB\u2019s  Loan  1356-Ban(SF)  :  Rural Electrification Project,  for\nSDR34.4 million, approved on 30 May 1995; the public sector shareholding has to be brought down to 41 percent\nwithin six months of  commissioning of the company's first gas turbine in November 1999.\n\n4  In 1998, the annual per capita consumption in Nepal was 50 kWh and in Cambodia 55 kWh. Comparable figures\n\nfor some other developing member countries were India 340 kWh, and Thailand 950 kWh.\n\n5  Comparable figures for some other developing member countries are Cambodia with less than 10 percent, Nepal\n\n14 percent, Pakistan 48 percent, India 82 percent, and Thailand 99 percent.\n\n6  TA 1962-BAN:Preparation of a Power System Master Plan, for $600,000, approved on 11 October 1993.\n\n\f3\n\nunwillingness  to  pay  their  bills.  This  in  turn  has  led  to  shortages  of  funds  for  maintenance  and\nfurther aggravated the situation.\n\n8.\nSince  Bangladesh's  terrain  is  flat,  hydropower  potential  is  limited.  The  Jamuna-Padma-\nMeghna river system, which runs north to south, divides the country in two. The country's entire\nproven  recoverable  reserves  of  oil  (including  condensate),  estimated  at  59 million  barrels,  and\nnatural gas, estimated at 15 trillion cubic feet, are located on the eastern side of the river system.\nThe  limited  hydropower  potential  is  also  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  country.  The  west  has  no\ndeveloped commercial sources of energy. Coal reserves, which are located in the northwest, are\ndeep beneath the surface and difficult to develop. Only one potential mine with a limited output of\nabout 1 million tons per annum is being developed with external assistance. Consequently, of the\ncountry's total installed generation capacity of 3,611 MW, only about 590 MW (fueled by diesel oil\nand heavy fuel oil), is  in  the  west.  Of the 3,021  MW  in the east, 2,786  MW is based on natural\ngas,  the  country's  primary  commercial  fuel,  and  235  MW  is  hydropower.  In  terms  of  energy\ngenerated, about 90 percent of the total in FY1999 was from gas-fired power plants.\n\n9.\nIn  FY1998,  BPDB's  average  retail  tariff  for  its  ultimate  consumers  was  Tk2.67/kWh\n($0.055/kWh),  DESA's  was  Tk2.63/kWh  ($0.052/kWh),  and  PBS's  Tk3.30/kWh  ($0.07/kWh),\nleading  to  a  weighted  average  tariff  of  Tk.2.76/kWh  ($0.058/kWh),  as  compared  with  the\nestimated  long  run  marginal  cost  (LRMC)  supply  of  Tk3.86/kWh  ($0.078/kWh).  The  LRMC  will,\nhowever, decline sharply by FY2002 due to the lower costs of production from private sector IPPs.\nRetail  tariffs  are  being  adjusted  semi-annually  to  take  into  account  fluctuations  in  foreign\nexchange rates and fuel costs in particular the price of natural gas.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment  Policies and Plans\n\nThe  PSRB  envisions  a  power  sector  structure  based  on  (i) the separation  of  sector\n10.\nregulation  and  operation;  (ii)  autonomy  and  commercial  orientation  of  the  sector  entities;\n(iii) unbundling  of  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  and  (iv) increased  private  sector\nparticipation. A new regulatory authority would be responsible for (i) setting electricity tariffs and\ndetermining  the  corresponding performance norms;  (ii)  collecting,  verifying,  and  disseminating\nsector  statistics;  (iii)  reviewing  and  approving  long-term  power  planning;  (iv)  creating  and\nmaintaining  a  nondiscriminatory  and  commercial  business  environment  in  the  sector;  and  (v)\nadjudicating disputes between sector entities. While the transmission segment would remain in\nthe  public  sector,  generation  and  distribution  assets  would  have  both  public  and  private\nownership. The objective is  to  eliminate  monopolies and  instill  competition  in order to achieve\ncommercial discipline and good customer service.\n\nAfter  initiation  of  reforms  in  1994,  the  organizational  setup  of  the  sector  changed.  In\n11.\n1994, all generation  was  with BPDB;  today  there  are  several  public-private and private  sector\nentities  licensed  to  construct  and  operate  power-generating  facilities.  The  first  private  barge-\nmounted  power  station  started  operation  in  December  1998.  RPC\u2019s  first  gas  turbine  at  its\nMymensingh site was commissioned on 20 November 1999.7 Others, under varying degrees of\nconstruction, are three barge-mounted power stations totaling about 300 MW, the IPP stations\nat Meghnaghat (450 MW) 8 and Haripur (360 MW), and the 100 MW expansion at Baghabari.\n\nGood governance, at the sector and corporate levels, is emphasized in the PSRB. At the\n12.\nsector level, governance is to be improved through predictability (long-term planning, codification\nof  rules  and  regulations,  and  independence  of  regulatory  processes),  transparency  (systematic\n                                               \n7\n\nSupported by the Bank through its loan 1356-BAN(SF): Rural Electrification Project for SDR34.4 million approved\non 30 May 1995.\nTA  2338-BAN:  Solicitation for Private Sector Implementation of the Meghnaghat Power Project for  $211,000\napproved on 30 May 1995, enhanced to $595,000 in March 1998.\n\n8\n\n\f4\n\ndissemination  of  relevant  sector  information,  public  hearings,  and  discussions  on  issues  before\nthey are decided) and accountability (cause-effect structure of incentives). At the corporate level,\ngovernance is to be enhanced through corporatization, independence of boards of directors from\nthe  Government,  defined  delegation  of  powers  to  staff,  computerized  management  information\nsystems, and commercialization of activities.\n\n13.\nThe Government    realizes  that  the  investment  requirements  for  the  power  sector  during\nthe  next  decade,  estimated  at  about  $6.6  billion,  exceed  the  resources  available  in  the  public\nsector and could crowd out investment in other key sectors. Therefore, the Government has taken\na policy decision to invite the private sector to participate in sector development. The Government\nhas  made  substantial  efforts  to  streamline  administrative  and  commercial  procedures  and  the\nprivate sector has responded positively in its participation. The Government, with the assistance\nof ADB, and the World Bank, has successfully solicited private sector participation in generation.\nTo streamline the legislative basis for the sector\u2019s restructuring and regulation, and to enable the\nestablishment of an independent regulatory authority, the Government is in the process of drafting\na new electricity reform act and is expected to introduce it to Parliament by December 1999. An\nADB  TA  will  help  draft  power  sector  regulations  to  be  administered  by  the  new  regulatory\nauthority.9  This will  enable depoliticization of the tariff setting and  licensing procedures,  making\nthe sector\u2019s operations more transparent.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n14.\nInvestment in the power sector during the last decade totaled $3,541 million. The major\nsources  of  external  funding  have  been  the  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  France,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr\nWiederaufbau  (KfW),  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund  (OECF)10,  Department  For\nInternational  Development  (DFID),  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development\n(USAID), Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),  People\u2019s  Republic of  China,\nand  the  Russia  Federation.  Other  sources  include  the  Islamic  Development  Bank;  the  Kuwait\nFund  for  Arab  Economic  Development;  Saudi  Fund  for  Development;  Canadian  International\nInternational\nDevelopment  Agency;  United  Nations\u2019  Development  Program,  Swedish \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Agency;  Belgium,  Danish  International  Development  Assistance;\nand Department for International Development Cooperation Finland.  A summary of the external\nassistance to the sector,  detailing the Bank's assistance, is given in Appendix 2.\n\n15. While  the  ADB  has  supported  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  in  urban  areas,\nOECF  has  focused  on  generation  and  rural  electrification  projects.  DFID  has  financed\ntransmission and distribution in the Dhaka area in the past and is providing assistance to develop\nrenewable energy sources.  USAID  has  been  instrumental  in  establishing  and  funding  REB  and\nthe first PBSs, and continues to provide technical support to REB and the PBSs. KfW supported\ngenerating  capacity  augmentation  and  transmission  reinforcement  projects.  Other  aid  agencies\nfinanced  generation  projects,  and  France  and  OPEC  have  financed  some  transmission  and\ndistribution projects as  well.  The World Bank earlier supported distribution  in  smaller  towns  and\nrural areas. However, following initiation of the reforms, it has not provided any assistance to the\nsector other than TA for soliciting private sector participation and establishing the Power Cell. It is\ncurrently in the process of formulating a $600 million adjustable program lending modality loan to\nthe power sector.\n\n                                               \n9   TA 3129-BAN: Support for an Energy Regulatory Authority for $ 900,000,  approved on 16 December 1998.\n10  On 1 October 1999, OECF merged with the Export-Import Bank of Japan to form the Japan Bank for International\n     Cooperation.\n\n\fD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n1.\n\nContextual Issues\n\n5\n\n16.\nThe ADB has extensively supported the sector over the last 23 years. From its role as a\nproject financier in the 1970s, ADB provided funds as well as technical advice in the 1980s. Since\nthe initiation of the PSRB in 1994, ADB has provided policy advice to the Government on PSRB\nimplementation  as  well  as  funds  to  help  achieve  the  least  cost  expansion  program.  During  this\ninvolvement, ADB has learned the following lessons.\n\n17.\nOverall,  macroeconomic/political  issues  of  the  country  have  a  significant  bearing  on  the\nsector's  performance  as  well  as  its  ability  to  reform.  Political  unrest,  labor  militancy,  peace  and\nsecurity  enforcement,  speed  and  quality  of  the  judicial  processes,  and  ability  of  the  education\nsystem to provide the skilled labor, all affect the sector's performance, although there is very little\nthat  the  sector  by  itself  can  do  to  systematically  address  these  problems.  Power  sector\ndevelopment  can  only  proceed  in  tandem  with  reforms  in  the  rest  of  the  economy  and  the\nsociopolitical  regime,  and  to  the  level  permitted  by  these  external  constraints.  Forcing  reforms\nbeyond this point becomes dysfunctional and may even jeopardize the entire reform process.\n\n18.\nDelegation of powers from the Government to the management of the utilities and from the\nmanagement to the staff is very limited, and despite efforts by ADB and other funding agencies,\nhas  not  been  sufficiently  enhanced.  The  entities  are  also  restricted  by  the  Government's\npersonnel and wage policies, which inhibit the  recruitment and  retention of  competent staff, and\nthe retrenchment or dismissal of excess or nonperforming staff. Tariffs are based more on political\nconsiderations than on economic factors. The losses incurred by the utilities are compensated for\nby  long-term,  low  interest  loans  from  the  Government;  this  is  detrimental  to  the  efficiency  and\nfinancial  health  of  the  utilities.  Losses  incurred  by  the  utilities  are  also  compensated  for  by\nconverting Government debt to equity. Currently BPDB\u2019s debt-equity ratio stands at 40:60. These\nfactors clearly underscore the limited extent of improvements that can be made to the utilities in\ntheir  present  form.  It  is  therefore  essential  that  new  sector  entities  be  created  that  are  not\nsubjected  to  the  organizational  limitations  of  BPDB  and  DESA,  and  that  there  be  an  overall\nenvironment of commercialization in the sector. Further, there is a need to distance the authority\nfor effecting tariff changes from the Government and depoliticize it.\n\n19.\nFundamental changes in infrastructure sectors take time to implement even in developed\ncountries. In developing countries, change is more difficult to implement, and, therefore, requires\na more gradual approach. Speeding up reforms is functional only if the change is comprehensive.\nFor  example,  increasing  tariffs  too  rapidly  may  help  sector  finances  but  often  undermines  the\nreform  objectives  by  penalizing  the  good  consumer  if  the  utilities  collect  only  from  a  low\npercentage  of  consumers.  Affordability  is  also  a  factor.  Rapid  tariff  increases  can  drive  up  the\ncosts  of  electricity,  making  it  unaffordable  to  the  poorer  consumers,  whereas  more  gradual\nincreases allow time for managing their effects.\n\n2.\n\nCompliance of Reform Actions Under Earlier Bank Loans\n\nThe  ADB\u2019s  Eighth  Power  Project  will  close  in  December  1999  and  the  Rural\n20.\nElectrification Project is expected to be completed early next year. All structural reform-related\nconditionalities stipulated in these loans were met. The status of fulfillment of the restructuring\nconditionalities stipulated under the Bank\u2019s ongoing Ninth Power Project is as follows:\n\n(i) \n\nRationalization of DESA\u2019s Boundaries. As per the agreement, DESA was to have\nhanded  over  its  rural  areas  to  the  PBSs  by  March  1998.    The  law  defining\nDESA\u2019s  boundaries  was  amended  on  19  April  1998.  The  Gazaria  area  was\n\n\f(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi) \n\n6\n\nhanded  over  to  the  PBSs  in  March  1998.  The  hand  over  of  the  Savar,\nNarshingdi,  and  Manikganj  areas  was  completed  in  September  1998.  The\nbalance was partially handed over in September and October 1999 with the last\ntransfer scheduled for December 1999. This rationalization has already improved\nperformance and reduced distribution losses by about 5 percent.\n\nHandover of Transmission Assets to PGCB. BPDB was to have handed over the\nComilla (North) and Haripur 230 kilovolt (kV) substations and about 45 kilometers\n(km)  of  230  kV  transmission  lines  by  June  1998.  However,  there  was  a  delay\nbecause  of  a  debate  on  whether  asset  transfers  should  be  gradual  or\nsimultaneous.  The  Government,  earlier  attempted  to  have  all  the  assets\nsimultaneously  transferred  in  February-March  1998.  The  excessive  financial,\nadministrative,  and  personnel  problems  faced  by  BPDB  and  PGCB  made  this\ntransfer impossible. The Government then decided in September 1998, that the\ntransfers  would  be  gradual  with  the  Ninth  Power-  related  assets  transferred  in\nMarch  1999.  The  assets  pertaining  to  the  Bank\u2019s  Ninth  Power  Project  were\nlegally  transferred  on  31 March  1999,  and  physical  transfer  was  completed  on\n13 October  1999.  This  transfer  has  started  the  process  of  segregating  the\nsubsectors.\n\nHandover  of  DESA\u2019s  Mirpur  Assets  to  DESCO.  This  was  completed  on\n24 September  1998  with  a  delay  of  four  months,  and  marks  the  start  of  the\ncorporatization process of the distribution subsector.\n\nAward  of  Contract  for  the  Meghnaghat  Project.  This  activity  was  to  have  been\ncompleted  by  June  1998.  However,  the  selection  of  sponsors  and  award  of\ncontract  for  the  Meghnaghat  Power  Project  was  delayed  by  over  a  year.  All\nproject contracts were signed on 29 July 1999.\n\nLiquidation of Government dues to BPDB and  DESA.  Arrangements have been\nmade for payment of Tk750 million in three tranches to liquidate  BPDB arrears.\nThe  first  tranche  of  Tk250  million  was  paid,  and  budgetary  provision  made  for\npayment  of  the  second  tranche  in  FY1999.  Similar  arrangements  are  being\nexplored for DESA. This is an ongoing activity and is expected to be completed\nby the end of FY2001.\n\nRevision of Retail Tariffs.   As  per  the  agreement  between  the Government and\nthe  ADB,  retail  tariffs  are  reviewed  and  automatically  adjusted  for  variations  in\nfuel  costs  and  foreign  exchange  value  of  the  taka  every  six  months,  as  per  a\nformula.  Retail  tariffs  have  been  reviewed  and  adjusted  (when  necessary)  in\nMarch  and  September  of  each  year  except  in  1999  when  partial  adjustments\nwere  announced  in  July  because  the  introduction  of  the  value  added  tax  on  all\ncommodities and services. This tax affected retail electricity tariffs. In its review of\nSeptember 1999,  the Government however,  adjusted  retail  tariffs  and  made  up\nthe shortfall of the March 1999 review.\n\nThe fulfillment of  conditions related to  restructuring  has been delayed  in  some  cases  by\n21.\nover a year. Nevertheless, the Government must be complimented on its determination to follow\nthrough  with  these  politically  difficult  and  sensitive  actions.  Some  have  led  to  law  and  order\nproblems  that  the  Government  had  to  tackle  firmly.  Since  the  commencement  of  the  reform\nprogram in 1994, the Government has always delivered on the conditionalities it has agreed upon\nwith  ADB  as  part  of  the  process  of  power  sector  reforms.  This  gives  ADB  confidence  that\nnecessary  actions  will  be  taken  by  the  Government  and  that  it  will  determinedly  pursue  the\nreforms in the future.\n\n\f7\n\n22.\nThe  political  situation  in  the  last  few  years  has  significantly  affected  the  collection\noperations  of  both  BPDB  and  DESA  since  many  commercial  establishments,  including  banks,\nwere  closed  for  prolonged  periods  and  those  that  were  open  functioned  with  minimal  services.\nDESA was particularly hard hit since Dhaka, as the capital city, was the center of the unrest, and\nnormal  life  in  the  city  was disrupted for longer periods than  in  other  towns.  During  FY1998,  the\ncollection to generation ratio of BPDB and collection to import ratio of DESA were 64.03 percent\nand  57.98 percent  respectively.  These  are  far  below  the  targets  of  75 percent  for  BPDB  and\n70 percent for DESA, and worse than the performance of FY1997. Performance of  BPDB and\nDESA has also been affected by the constant changing of senior staff and low  morale of  staff\ncaused  by  the  knowledge  that  other  organizations  will  replace  BPDB  and  DESA  in  the  near\nfuture.  On  the  other  hand  the  performance  of  the  seven  PBSs  supported  by  the  ADB  in  the\nRural  Electrification  Project    has  been  very  good  with  an  average  collection  to  import  ratio  of\n83.3 percent.\n\nE.\n\nADB's Sector Strategy\n\n23.\nThe ADB recognizes that (i) the substantial external assistance provided to the  sector  in\nthe  past  has  induced  a  tendency  in  the  sector  agencies  to  depend  on  external  assistance  for\nfunding,  (ii)  recovery  and  development  must  be  led  from  within  the  sector,  and  (iii)  the\nGovernment and all major aid agencies must realign their individual strategies to emphasize this\nobjective.  In  consultation  with  the  Government  and  the  other  funding  agencies  involved  in  the\nsector,  ADB has developed a medium-term plan to improve the power sector (Appendix 3). The\nstrategy  consists  of  (i) changes \nthrough  corporatization,\ncommercialization,  and  increasing  private  sector  participation;  (ii) institutional  improvements  in\nBPDB  and  DESA  through  introduction  of  modern  management  practices;  (iii)  creation  of  new\nsector  agencies  that  could  serve  as  role  models  for  the  sector;  (iv)  enlarging  the  scope  of  the\nPBSs; and (v) strengthening the long-term planning and regulatory processes in the sector.  The\nproposed Project addresses items (i), (iii),  and (iv) of this strategy. Item (ii) is an ongoing process\nand item (v) has partially been addressed through the Power Sector Master Plan, the creation of\nthe Power Cell, and ADB's TA for support to the Energy Regulatory Authority.\n\nthe  business  environment \n\nin \n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nThe ADB, World Bank, OECF,  DFID,  USAID,  and  KfW have  been  involved  in  a  policy\n24.\ndialogue  with  the Government about  issues  in  the  power  sector,  with  ADB  playing  the  role  of\ncoordinator. The ADB has played a major role in drawing up the reform assistance strategy of\nthe funding agencies, and in addition, has organized and coordinated aid coordination meetings\nfor the power sector in 1992, 1994, 1995, and 1996, and for the power and natural gas sectors\nin 1997 and 1998. ADB-led aid coordination meetings in December 1992, December 1994, and\nSeptember 1995  contributed to  the formulation of reforms and the  identification of  reform-linked\nprojects  in  the  sector.  The  ADB  also  provided  TAs  to  review  electricity  legislation,11  prepare  a\npower system master plan,12 upgrade the financial management of BPDB and DESA, 13 solicit for\nprivate sector implementation of the  Meghnaghat Project14  and  corporatize the Ashuganj Power\nStation of BPDB.  15 The Bank has been instrumental  in assisting  the Government  to draw up a\nplan for the planned transformation of the sector, and the creation of new sector entities.\n\n                                               \n11 TA 1743-BAN: Review of Electricity Legislation and Regulations, for $90,000, approved on 18 August 1992.\n12 TA 1962-BAN: Preparation   of  a Power System Master Plan for  $600,000, approved on  11 October 1993.\n13 TA 2004-BAN: Financial Management Upgrade of BPDB and DESA, for  $  1,000,000,  approved  on  26 November\n\n14 TA No. 2338-BAN: Solicitation of Private Sector Implementation of the Meghnaghat Project, approved on 30 May\n\n1993.\n\n1995.\n\n15 Corporatization of Ashuganj Power Station for $1,000,000 to be presented for approval in December 1999.\n\n\f8\n\n25.\nThe medium-term goals of the policy dialogue with the Government up to 2005 and the\nresults achieved so far are summarized at Appendix 3. Generation is no longer a monopoly, and\nhas  sufficient  private  sector  interest;  the  public  sector  stations  are  starting  to  be  corporatized\nand commercialized. A start has been made in the process of segregating and corporatizing the\ntransmission  function.  Distribution  is  being  corporatized  in  the  Dhaka  area,  and  the  private\nsector PBSs have  increased  their  share of  sales  from  13  percent  in  FY1993  to  22  percent  in\nFY1999.  Average  retail  power  tariffs  were  increased  by  a  total  of  about  15  percent  (in\nSeptember  and  December  1996)  and  an interim  formula  for  semiannual  adjustment  of  retail\npower  tariffs  to  take  into  account  fluctuations  in  fuel  costs  and  foreign  exchange  rates  was\nsuccessfully implemented. 16 On the regulatory side, work has progressed through the creation\nof the Power Cell, which is mandated to plan and execute reform-related activities and act as a\nquasi-regulator  until  the statutory  regulator  is  appointed,  and  preparatory  studies  on  new\nlegislation, sector structure, and tariff framework have been completed. The draft Electricity and\nRegulatory Commission Act, 17 which will form the legal basis for power sector reform, is under\nreview by the cabinet  and is expected to be introduced in Parliament by December 1999.\n\n26.\nThe funding agencies hold  a coordination  meeting every  year  to  review  sector policies\nand  achievements.  ADB  missions  have  explained  the  rationale  behind  the  Project  in  several\nmeetings.  The  funding  agencies  all  support  the  Project  itself  but  do  not  agree  on  all  issues.\nWhile  the  World  Bank  is  of  the  opinion  that  all  BPDB  generation  plants  should  be  privatized\nimmediately,  this  view  is  not  supported  by  ADB,  OECF,  and  KfW,  the  agencies  involved  in\nproviding funding for the power stations. They believe that corporatization and establishment of\na commercial structure for the sector should precede any attempt at privatization. In any case,\nthere is not enough private capital available in Bangladesh to purchase these assets and such a\nsale, if it fails, could affect successful private sector participation in other areas of the sector. All\nfunding  agencies,  however,  agree  that  there  is  a  limit  to  the  country's  foreign  investment\nabsorption  capability.  Too  rapid  an  external  investment  rate  in  fixed  assets  would  create  a\nsqueeze in the local currency markets when repatriating debt servicing and profits.\n\nAll  funding  agencies  consider  distribution  subsector  reform  to  be  a  priority  as  this\n27.\nsubsector  collects  the  entire  revenues  of  the  sector.  The  ADB  has  assumed  responsibility  for\nassisting  with  reforms  in  the  Dhaka  area  and  the  World  Bank  for  areas  outside  of  Dhaka.\nExpansion  of  REB/PBS  activities  has  been  supported  by  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  OECF,  and\nUSAID.\n\n28.\nDFID  is  concerned  about  DESA\u2019s  performance  being  much below  that targeted  by  the\nfunding  agencies.  Hence  it  is  of  the  opinion  that  new  assistance  should  not  be  provided  to\nDESA until it achieves the targeted performance levels. ADB believes that the ultimate objective\nis to improve sector efficiencies without major disruptions in electricity service and without any\npolitical embarrassment to the  Government,  which could dilute  its  commitment  to  reform.  The\nADB\u2019s operation in the Dhaka area and its support to DESA must also be viewed as a holding\noperation to enable other reforms to be initiated in the sector. Since DESA has failed to perform,\nDESCO  was  created;  it  will  gradually  take  over  DESA's  assets,  make  the  necessary\nimprovements  and  has  the  potential  to  be  privatized.  DESA\u2019s  market  share  is  being  reduced\nprogressively  by  transferring  parts  of  its  distribution  territory  to  DESCO  and    the  PBSs.  In  a\nsense,  therefore  ADB  is  investing  in  a  DESCO  of  the  future  when  it  invests  in  present  day\nDESA.  In  the  interim  period,  DESCO  will  provide  DESA  with  competition,  which  will  aid\n\n                                               \n16 Agreed as part of the policy dialogue under the ADB Loan 1505-BAN(SF): Ninth Power Project.\n17 Supported by the ADB under its TA to 1743-BAN: Review of Electricity Legislation and Regulations, approved on\n\n18 August 1992, as well as by a World Bank TA.\n\n\f9\n\nimprovement in DESA also. To not support DESA would create technical imbalance in service\nand be politically unacceptable to the Government.\n\n29.\nOECF  (now  JBIC) is  seeking  to  complement  the  Project  through  a  new  loan  of\n\u00a54,376 million  (about  $36.47 million)  that  will  (i) strengthen  and  intensify  rural  electrification  in\nfour PBSs, including one in the Dhaka area; and (ii) expand the system loss reduction scheme\nincluding  for  two  feeders  in  the  Dhaka  area.  In  addition,  JBIC  is  providing  assistance  for  the\nexpansion  of  the  Haripur  power  station,  and  has  already  conducted  preliminary  studies  on\nreorganizing  its  operations  under  a  profit  center  concept  that  complements  ADB\u2019s  TA  for\ncorporatizing  the Ashuganj  Power  Station.  KfW,  is  considering  a  new  operation  to  rehabilitate\nand subsequently modernize the Ashuganj power station, if it is successfully corporatized under\nADB\u2019s TA. KfW has also been in constant dialogue with the Government in support of liquidating\nthe Government's dues to BPDB and DESA. USAID has strengthened its support to REB/PBSs\nto  help  them  handle  their  increasing  responsibilities,  and  has  also  assisted  them  to  draft  a\ngraduation policy for the PBSs.\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\n30.\nThe Project is a continuation of the long-term strategy of the Government and ADB for\npower sector reform. The rationale for the choice of the reform components of the Project is as\nfollows.\n\n1.\n\nGeneration\n\nThe private sector has the potential to add about 1,400 MW of capacity over the next five\n31.\nyears.  This  is 39  percent of  the  current  installed capacity  of  3,611  MW  and  68 percent  of  the\ncurrently  available  capacity  of  about  2,400  MW.  Thus  there  is  a  need  to  take  stock  of  the\nsituation before further IPP capacity is committed. The Government has guaranteed conversion\nof  foreign  exchange  under  the  several  implementation  agreements  that  were  signed,  or\ncommitted to be signed, with the private sector IPPs; the amount under guarantee represents a\nsignificant portion of its total foreign exchange reserves. The total capacity of the new projects,\nincluding  additional  peaking  power  stations  as  required,  would  be  adequate  to  fulfill  the\nrequirements of the country until 2005 at the current rate of load  growth.\n\nthe  generating \n\nCorporatization  of \n\nfacilities  presently  under  BPDB  and \n\n32.\ntheir\ncommercialization  has  commenced.  Since economic  dispatch  routines  will be enforced  by  the\nregulator, it is essential that the power stations owned and operated by BPDB be upgraded both\ntechnically and managerially; otherwise, they  risk  being  marginalized  under  the new operating\nregime. Given that the present structure and internal procedures of BPDB are not conducive to\nrapid absorption of new routines, staffing norms, and internal discipline that would be demanded\nof it, a new corporatized subsidiary of BPDB is being created to take over the responsibility of\nmanaging the Ashuganj Power Station. This company will function as another IPP. Funding for\nupgrading the Ashuganj Power Station is being considered by KfW and JBIC.\n\n2.\n\nTransmission\n\n33.\nFor transmission,  priority  investments  include  (i)  the  development of the  National Load\nDispatch  Center,  (ii) the  strengthening  of  the  primary  transmission  system  in  the  West  Zone,\n(iii) the completion of the 230 kV double-circuit ring around Dhaka, and (iv) the completion of the\ninterconnection from Comilla to Chittagong. The World Bank has  already  indicated  support for\nthe  National  Load  Dispatch  Center,  and  KfW  for  the  Comilla-Chittagong  interlink  and\ncomponents for strengthening the West Zone network.\n\n\f10\n\n34. With the assistance extended to PGCB as part of the ADB's Ninth Power Project and the\nproposed assistance being considered for it by the World Bank and KfW, completing the 230kV\ndouble-circuit  ring  system  around  Dhaka  is  the  only  remaining  work  of  priority,  since  it  is\nessential  for  delivering  adequate  quantities  of  secure  power  to  the  Dhaka  area  and  also  for\nevacuation  and  economic  utilization  of  power  from  all  the  BOO/BOT  projects  now  being\ncontracted.\n\n3.\n\nDistribution\n\n35.\nGiven the extensive participation of the private sector in generation projects, the financial\nviability of the power sector will be in jeopardy unless the distribution subsector is strengthened\nto ensure offtake of power as well as generate adequate revenues for servicing the investments\nin the generation and transmission subsectors. Otherwise, the Government's guarantees to the\nIPPs could be called, placing an unacceptable burden on its budgets. The ADB has two options\navailable; (i) to consolidate its involvement in the Dhaka area, or (ii) to help other major towns\nrestructure  their  distribution  networks.  Given  (i)  the  precarious  state  of  Dhaka\u2019s  distribution\nnetwork  and  the  requirement  for  large  investments  to  upgrade  it;  (ii)  the  preponderance  of\nDhaka as a economic center of Bangladesh; (iii) the considerable work ADB has put in as part\nof  its  previous  operations  in  this  area,  which  are  just  beginning  to  show  results;  and  (iv)  the\nlimitation of ADB\u2019s staff resources, it is appropriate for ADB to continue its support for upgrading\ndistribution in the Dhaka area.\n\n4.\n\nInstitutional Strengthening\n\n36.\nThe  Bangladesh  power  sector  will  have  to  rapidly  expand  into  the  rural  areas  if  the\ncurrent low access rate of electricity is to be speedily improved. This is going to place a major\nburden  on  the  human  resources  of  REB  and  the  PBSs.  At  present  REB  has  only  a  small\ntechnical training establishment at Savar near Dhaka, and skeletal managerial training facilities\nat its headquarters. This arrangement is inadequate for the future, and REB needs to develop\nfull  facilities  for  training  and  development  of  PBS  staff.  Hence,  REB  has  requested  ADB's\nsupport  to  strengthen  human  resource  development  activities.  This  training  facility,  when\nestablished, would also be available for use by other sector entities on a cost sharing basis.\n\n37.\nBased on the foregoing analysis, it is appropriate for ADB to support  (i) completing  the\n230kV ring around Dhaka city; (ii) upgrading of distribution in the Dhaka area; (iii)  establishing\na training and managerial development institute in REB.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n38.\nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  enable  evacuation  and  economic  utilization\nof the power generated from the BOO/BOT projects now being contracted; (ii) reduce losses  and \nimprove  reliability  of  the  existing  transmission  and  distribution  system  in  the  Dhaka  area;  and\n(iii) initiate preparatory works for a training and management development institute in REB.\n\n39.\n\n40.\n\nThe Project comprises the following components:\n\nPart A: 230/132 kV Transmission System around Dhaka.

The Government plans to  review DESCO's performance in December 1999,\nand help it identify and overcome weaknesses in its operations so as to smoothly absorb Gulshan\ncircle.  The  ADB  has  also  accorded  a  small-scale  TA  to  advise  DESCO's  management  on  key\norganization matters 20.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule and Performance Review\n\nThe  project  implementation  schedule  is  given  in  Appendix  5.  Implementation  has\n50.\ncommenced in September 1999 and will be completed in September 2003. Direct supervision of\nsubproject  implementation  and  monitoring  of  subproject  operation  performance  will  be  the\nresponsibility of the EAs and the Government. EAs will provide quarterly progress reports to ADB\non their respective responsibilities, within 30 days of the end of each quarter. The ADB will review\nthe implementation and operation of the Project based on  these reports and  meet with the EAs\nand  the  Government    semiannually  to  discuss  project  progress.  The  ADB  will  also  monitor  the\noverall performance of the EAs.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n51.\nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance\nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. For such procurement, bid specifications will be prepared\nin  a  manner  to  ensure  maximum  competition  under  international  competitive  bidding.  To\nencourage  local  industry,  it  is  proposed  to  permit  the  EAs  to  accord  local  manufacturers\nparticipating  in  international  bids  under  the  project,  price  preference  of  up  to  a  maximum  of\n15 percent  as  per  ADB's  scheme  for  such  preferences.

The  Government  was  advised  that  ADB's  approval  of  such\nadvance procurement action will not in any way commit it to subsequently approve the Project. All\nsuch advance procurement actions will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement\nand its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants as described in paras 51 and 52 respectively.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n54.\nSince  the  disbursements  under  the  Project  will  be  mainly  for  supply  of  goods  and\nconsulting  services,  ADB's  commitment  and  direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for\ndisbursement purposes.\n\n7. \n\nReports,  Accounts,  and Audits\n\n55.\nThe  EAs  will  prepare  separate  progress  reports  for  their  respective  components  and\nsubmit  them  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  reports  will  provide  a  narrative  description  of\nprogress made during the period, changes to the implementation schedule, problems or difficulties\nencountered,  the  performance  of  the  project  implementation  consultants,  and  the  work  to  be\ncarried  out  in  the  upcoming  period.  The  progress  reports  will  also  include  a  summary  financial\naccount for  the Project. This will  consist of project expenditures during the period, year to date,\nand total expenditure to date. The ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project\nbased  on  these  reports  and  meet  with  the  EAs  and  the  Government  semiannually  to  discuss\nproject progress. Project completion reports will be submitted to ADB within six months of project\ncompletion.\n\nThe  EAs  will  have  their  annual  financial  statements  and  Project  accounts  audited  by  a\n56.\nprofessional  auditing  firm  acceptable  to  ADB.

It has the responsibility to\npurchase electricity from BPDB at 132 kV and distribute the same to consumers in the  Dhaka\narea, other than those areas covered by the PBSs.\n\n\fDESA is governed by a board appointed by the Government and comprising a full-time\n\n66.\nchairperson and three full-time members.\n\nb.\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\n17\n\nc.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\n67.\nA summary of DESA's projected financial performance is provided in Table 6. DESA has\nbeen operating since 1991. When established, DESA assumed debt and accounts receivable in\naddition  to  assets  transferred  from  BPDB.  Over  the  past  eight  years,  DESA\u2019s  financial\nperformance  has  been  less  than  satisfactory.  DESA\u2019s  systems  losses  are  well  above  those\nnormally expected in an efficiently run distribution company, with some districts incurring actual\nlosses as high as 60 percent. DESA\u2019s collection ratio, which has at times dropped to as low as\n48 percent, and its increasing levels of accounts receivable, are evidenced by successive and\nsignificant  cash  flow  deficits.  As  per  the  reform  plans  of  the  Government,  DESA  will  have\ngradually  handed  over  all  its  assets  to  DESCO  or  other  successor  companies  by  2002  and\nhave  ceased  to  exist  in  its  present  form.  Therefore,  although  financial  projections  have  been\nmade until 2008, they are only indicative.\n\nTable 6: Summary of DESA's Projected Financial Performance\n\nItem\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n(26.3)\n\n(13.2)\n\n(11.7)\n\n(9.1)\n\n(8.3)\n\n(7.9)\n\n(7.5)\n\n(7.0)\n\nRate of Return\non Historic Net\nFixed Assets\n(%)\n\nOperating Ratio\n(%)\n\nRate of Return\non Average\na\nEquity (%) \n\nDebt to Equity\nRatio (%)\n\nDebt Service\nCoverage Ratio\n(times)\n\nCollection to\nb\nImport Ratio \n(%)\n\nNet Income\n(Taka 000's)\n\n(22.8)\n\n(24.8)\n\n(15.1)\n\n(8.3)\n\n(3.8)\n\n(2.5)\n\n(1.6)\n\n(0.6)\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nCurrent Ratio\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n100% debt\n\n100% debt\n\n100% debt\n\n100% debt\n\n100% debt\n\n100% debt\n\n100% debt\n\n100% debt\n\n(0.1)\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n(0.0)\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n97.7\n\n122.3\n\n116.8\n\n80.7\n\n81.7\n\n81.7\n\n81.7\n\n81.7\n\n(5,021,931)\n\n(4,388,547)\n\n(4,109,395)\n\n(3,367,582)\n\n(3,175,866)\n\n(2,923,415)\n\n(2,687,120)\n\n(2,429,667)\n\na\n  As average net equity is in deficit (i.e., less than zero), computation of return on equity yields an illogical result.\nb\n  Higher than average collection to import ratio indicates transfer of assets and therefore lower import compared to\n\nimproved collection of outstanding accounts receivable.\n\n4. \n\nRural Electrification Board / Palli Bidyut Samities\n\na. \n\nResponsibilities\n\nREB  is  an  infrastructure  development  agency  of  the  Government,  created  as  an\n68.\nautonomous  entity  under  a  Presidential  Ordinance  in  1977  to  implement  the  electrification\nprogram through consumer cooperatives, the PBSs. The creation of this autonomous body was\n\n\f18\n\none  of  the  recommendations  of  the  consulting  firms  that  conducted  feasibility  studies  for  the\nGovernment\u2019s Rural Electrification Program in 1977, which was financed by USAID.\n\n69.\nThe major functions of REB, as incorporated in its charter, are to (i) establish electricity\ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  systems  in  rural  areas  of  Bangladesh;  (ii)  organize\nprospective  consumers  of  electricity  into  formal  and  informal  groups  such  as  societies  and\ncompanies;  (iii)  formulate  bylaws,  for  the  PBSs  and  other  groups  registered  with  REB,  and\ndetermine  the  methods  of  their  operations;  (iv)  advance  funds  for  the  implementation  of\napproved schemes, the operation and management of works and services, and construction of\nlines for members for electric connections; (v) hand over to the PBSs the completed projects for\noperation,  maintenance,  and  management;  (vi)  train  personnel  in  the  management  and\noperation  of  REB  and  the  PBSs;  (vii)  develop  standards  for  work,  equipment,  operation,\nmaintenance,  procurement  and  warehousing,  personnel  and  fiscal  administration,  and  other\naspects  of  management  to  be  followed  by  REB  as  well  as  by  the  PBSs  and  other  groups\nregistered with REB.\n\n70.\nThere are 54 PBSs that currently serve about 1.2 million consumers and distribute about\n22 percent of the electricity consumed in the country. The responsibilities of a PBS begin when\na distribution scheme is handed over to it for operation and maintenance after construction and\ncommissioning.  Its  principal  objective  is  to  supply  its  members  and  other  consumers  with\nelectricity.  Its  functions  include  (i)  distributing  electricity  and  providing  consumer  connections;\n(ii) meter  reading,  billing,  and  collection;  (iii)  purchasing  electricity  from  BPDB  and  DESA;\n(iv) planning  and  implementing  the  expansion  of  local  distribution  acquiring  and  installing\nelectrical appliances, and improving system power factors through the installation of capacitors.\n\nb. \n\nOrganizational Structure\n\n71.\nREB  is  managed  by  a  Board  consisting  of  a  chairperson  and  three  full-time  board\nmembers (finance, engineer, and PBSs and training). To coordinate with the rural electrification\nprogram  in  their  respective  fields,  four  part-time  Board  members,  represent  BPDB,  the\nBangladesh  Agricultural  Development  Corporation,  the  Bangladesh  Small  and  Cottage\nIndustries Corporation, and the Bangladesh Rural Development Board.\n\nEach  PBS  is  a  member-owned  autonomous  cooperative,  distributing  electricity  in  its\n72.\nservice area. The initial board of directors of a PBS is selected from local citizens, subject to the\napproval of  REB\u2019s board  of  directors. After  appointment, directors  register  the  PBS  with  REB,\nwhich then proceeds to encourage potential consumers  to  become  members of the  PBS.  The\nboard of directors consists of 10-15 members elected by an annual members\u2019 meeting. Eligibility\nto become or remain a director includes being a bona fide member of a PBS and a resident of\nits service area. Any person or organization in a PBS's area may become a member of the PBS\nfollowing acceptance by the board of directors and payment of a membership application fee of\nTk10. The Board elects a president who functions as its chief representative officer.\n\nc.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nThe ultimate owners  and operators of  the  REB-implemented  component  of  the  Project\n73.\nwill  be  the  seven  PBSs  of  Dhaka-1,  Dhaka-2,  Narshingdi-1,  Narshingdi-2,  Manikgonj,\nMymensing-1, and  Munshigonj.  To assess  the financial  position  and  performance  of  Part  B(i),\nthe  financial  statements  for  the  seven  PBSs  were  consolidated  and  projected  based  on  the\nconsolidated  position.  A  summary  of  the  consolidated  financial  performance  is  provided  in\nTable 7.\n\n\f19\n\n74.\nThe PBSs have the authority to set retail tariffs (with the exception of agriculture tariffs,\nwhich are established by the Government). PBS tariffs tend to be sufficient to cover all operating\ncosts  and  debt  service  obligations,  and  provide  an  adequate  return  on  equity.  The  PBSs  are\nnontaxable and do not bear foreign exchange risks associated with foreign borrowing. Surplus\ncash and reserves are used to invest in expansion and technical improvement projects.\n\nTable 7: Summary of Consolidated PBS Projected Financial Performance\n\nItems\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n11.2\n\n17.5\n\n25.4\n\n24.4\n\n22.0\n\n26.7\n\n32.3\n\n38.5\n\nRate of Return on\nHistoric Net Fixed\nAssets  (%)\n\nOperating Ratio (%)\n\nRate of Return on\nAverage Equity (%)\n\nCurrent Ratio\n\nDebt to Equity\nRatio (%)\n\nDebt Service\nCoverage Ratio\n(times)\n\nCollection to Import\nRatio (%)\n\nNet Income\n(Tk 000's)\n\n20.7\n\n20.6\n\n3.9\n\n65\n\n3.4\n\n26.6\n\n24.2\n\n4.9\n\n60\n\n6.4\n\n31.8\n\n24.2\n\n6.8\n\n56\n\n8.0\n\n34.2\n\n21.8\n\n8.1\n\n52\n\n7.5\n\n34.5\n\n18.9\n\n8.5\n\n46\n\n6.4\n\n35.8\n\n18.4\n\n9.8\n\n41\n\n4.6\n\n36.9\n\n17.8\n\n11.2\n\n36\n\n5.2\n\n37.6\n\n17.1\n\n12.7\n\n31\n\n5.8\n\n73.0\n\n83.2\n\n86.9\n\n82.0\n\n82.8\n\n83.3\n\n84.1\n\n84.1\n\n349,538\n\n537,988\n\n760,176\n\n936,921\n\n1,016,120\n\n1,189,115\n\n1,383,517\n\n1,584,047\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Issues\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n75.\nThe Project is classified as environment category B as per ADB\u2019s system of categorizing\nprojects, requiring a summary of the initial environmental examination report to be attached to the\nADB\u2019s  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board.  A  preliminary  examination\nindicates  that  there  will  not  be  any  deleterious  impact  on  the environment  that  cannot  be\nmitigated. An initial environmental examination of the 230 kV and 132 kV transmission lines and\nsubstations covered by Part A of the Project was conducted by PGCB. Other project components\nhave negligible impact on the environment.\n\n76.\nThe summary initial environmental examination is attached as Appendix 9. Approximately\n8 hectares of  land  will be acquired by  PGCB for the new  230 kV substation at  Aminbazar.  The\nidentified land is low lying and is flooded every year. Hence it supports no permanent population\nor structures. There are also no trees on the identified site that need cutting. PGCB will need to\nacquire right of way for the transmission lines that will be constructed. DESA will need to acquire\nabout 0.4 hectare of land for a new 132 kV substation at Kamrangichar. This does not have any\nsignificant environmental impact.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n77.\nProject components were discussed  in detail by ADB  missions  with the  management as\nwell as the staff associations of BPDB and DESA, who in turn have briefed their members. ADB\n\n\f20\n\nmissions have also discussed the elements of the Project with potential beneficiaries, such as the\nFederation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, several industrialists, as well as\na few residential and commercial consumers of Dhaka. The beneficiaries are aware of the Project\nand  support  the  power  sector  reforms  now  being  implemented.  The  staff  of  the  power  sector\nutilities  support  the  Project,  but  have  expressed  reservations  regarding  the  restructuring  and\ncorporatization activities.\n\n78.\nThe  Project  does  not  involve  significant  displacement  of  persons.  A  maximum  of  100\npersons who are dispersed along the transmission line will be affected. A short resettlement plan\nwas prepared based on ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement  and is given in Appendix 10.\nMinor rerouting of the transmission lines will be considered during project implementation, which\nwill further reduce the number of affected persons. Implementation of the plan for compensation\nand resettlement will be closely monitored by ADB's review missions.\n\n3.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n79.\nThe benefit monitoring and evaluation of the Project will be done by PGCB, REB, DESCO,\nand  DESA,  and  will  be  reviewed  by  ADB  missions  as  part  of  the  supervision  work.  This  will\ninclude  verification  of  (i)  the  number  of  additional  connections  provided,  (ii)  the  consumer\ncategories of the new  connections, and  (iii) the  service  improvements for existing consumers  in\nthe  Dhaka  area.  Institutional  parameters  such  as  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable,  and\nsystem loss will also be evaluated.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1. \n\nProject Basis\n\n80.\nAs part of its private power generation policy adopted in October 1996, the Government\nhas  invited  private  sector  investment  to  increase  the  generation  capacity  in  Bangladesh.\nProposals  were  solicited  for  about  1,400  MW  of  generating  capacity  on  a  BOO  basis.  It  is\nexpected that these capacities will be available within the next three years.\n\n81.\nAlmost all incremental generation expected to come from the IPPs, is in the Dhaka area.\nConsequently, to allow evacuation of power from the new plants, complementary investments in\ntransmission and distribution facilities are required. The completion of the 230 kV double-circuit\nring around Dhaka and upgrading of DESA\u2019s and DESCO\u2019s distribution network to allow import\nof the newly available generation capacity is necessary given that Dhaka is the main center of\neconomic  activity  in  Bangladesh.  Appendix  11  presents  the  consumer  connection  summary,\nwhich provides the basis for the financial and economic analyses of the Project.\n\n2.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 1998\n82.\nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to\nreal terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic  inflation  and  currency\nfluctuations. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of\nthe EAs under with- and without-project scenarios. The weighted average financial internal rate\nof return (FIRR) for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 9.4 percent. This compares\nfavorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  also  computed  on  an  after-tax\n\n\fbasis,  of  3.9  percent.  The  Project  is  considered  both  financially  viable  and  sustainable.\nSensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  weighted  average  FIRR  is  robust  under  adverse\nconditions. The FIRR analysis is summarized in Table 8,  the  weighted average  cost of  capital\nanalysis is  summarized in Table 9. Detailed financial evaluation is provided in Appendix 12.\n\nTable 8:  Financial Internal Rate of Return Summary\n\nPart A\n\nPart B (i)\n\nPart B (ii)\n\nPart B (iii)\n\nWeighted\nAverage\n\nCase\n\nBase Case\n\nRevenues Decrease by 10%\n\nOperating Expenses\n Increase by 10%\n\nOne-year Construction Delay\n with a 10% Cost Overrun\n\nCase\n\nBase Case\n\nRevenues Decrease by 10%\n\nOperating Expenses\n Increase by 10%\n\nOne-year Construction Delay\n with a 10% Cost Overrun\n\n7.7\n\n5.8\n\n5.9\n\n5.4\n\n4.52\n\n4.52\n\n4.52\n\n4.73\n\n8.5\n\n3.8\n\n5.3\n\n6.1\n\n4.68\n\n4.68\n\n4.68\n\n4.69\n\n7.7\n\n5.8\n\n6.3\n\n4.8\n\n4.36\n\n4.36\n\n4.36\n\n4.54\n\n9.4\n\n6.5\n\n7.2\n\n6.4\n\n3.9\n\n3.9\n\n3.9\n\n4.1\n\nTable 9:   Weighted Average Cost of Capital Summary\n\nPart A\n\nPart B (i)\n\nPart B (ii)\n\nPart B (iii)\n\nWeighted\nAverage\n\n21\n\n18.6\n\n13.9\n\n15.8\n\n14.3\n\n0.28\n\n0.28\n\n0.28\n\n0.28\n\n3.\n\nEconomic Rationale of the Project\n\nHistorically, the power sector has been operated  within a  relatively  monopolized  market,\n83.\nwhich  has  led  to  high  inefficiencies  and  uneconomic  resource  allocations.  To  address  the\nnecessary  sector  and  corporate  restructuring  and  governance  aspects,  the  Project  lends\ninvestment  support  to  a  series  of  policy-based  initiatives  that  have  (i)  broken  monopolies,\n(ii) introduced market-based mechanisms for competition and tariff setting, and (iii) redefined the\nroles of the public and private sectors. The Project thereby facilitates movement towards a more\ncompetitive market structure and financial accountability.\n\nThe creation of the new sector entities should instill discipline and financial viability into the\n84.\nsector. Presently, because of failure to manage the utilities properly, system losses and accounts\nreceivable  are  excessive  and  drain  the  sector  of  about  $80  million  per  year.  In  FY1995,\nGovernment  loans  to  BPDB  of  $345 million  were  converted  to  equity.  This  meant  that  the\nGovernment  had  foregone  the  domestic  mobilization  of  funds  inherent  in  the  onlending  of\ndevelopment loans and grants to the  sector.  The Government\u2019s equity in  DESA, of $260  million\nhas been made almost worthless because of operational losses incurred since DESA's creation in\nFY1992.  Efforts  to  remove  the  drain  on  the  national  exchequer  and  improve  public  financial\nmanagement are essential to aid in macroeconomic management, which is one of the objectives\nof the ADB\u2019s policy on good governance. 21\n\n                                               \n21 Board Document No. R151-95:Governance: Sound Development Management.\n\n\f4.\n\nProject Costs in Economic Prices\n\n22\n\n85.\nThe economic analysis uses border price levels with a world price numeraire and 1998\nprices. To convert the financial capital cost into economic cost, taxes and duties were deducted.\nNo  price  contingencies  are  included  in  the  base  capital  cost.  However,  the  economic  capital\ncosts include 10 percent physical contingencies. The costs are separated into foreign exchange,\nindirect  foreign  exchange,  and  local  currency  cost.  Local  costs  are  further  separated,  and\nspecific conversion factors  are  used  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor.  The  remaining  local  costs\nwere  converted  to  border  price  levels  by  applying  a  standard  conversion  factor.  Annual\noperation  and  maintenance  costs  were  calculated  in  economic  prices  as  a  percentage  of  the\ntotal capital investment cost. It is assumed that after five years of full operation this percentage\nwill increase as more comprehensive maintenance works will be needed. The cost of energy at\nthe generation level is valued at the weighted average of IPP send-out cost of $.036/kWh. This\nreflects the fact that all incremental generation capacity in the greater Dhaka area is expected to\nbe supplied by the IPPs. Transmission and distribution losses are included in the total amount of\nenergy to be imported into the transmission and distribution system.\n\n5.\n\nProject Benefits in Economic Prices\n\n86.\nEconomic benefits of electricity  consumption  were calculated for each  major  consumer\ncategory. For nonincremental consumption these are based on the alternative  economic  costs\nof other energy sources such as diesel generators and kerosene lamps, which will be replaced\nby  electricity.  The  elimination  of  load-shedding  is  used  as  a  proxy  to  estimate  the  amount  of\nnonincremental consumption.\n\nOnce all load-shedding is eliminated, all additional electricity consumption is considered\n87.\nincremental. For example, it is expected that once reliable electricity supply is created there will\nbe  increased  purchase  for  more  sensitive  electrical  appliances  like  refrigerators  by  domestic\nconsumers  or  production  equipment  by  industries.  Incremental,  or  induced,  consumption  was\nvalued at the estimated average willingness to pay for electricity based on a weighted average\nof  the  alternative  costs  of  providing  similar  energy-related  services  and  the  current  electricity\ntariff for each consumer category. The evaluation is described in more detail in Appendix 13.\n\nThe  base  case  economic  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at\n88.\n22.7 percent.  The EIRR was calculated over a 20-year period, corresponding to the estimated\nuseful  life  of  the Project.  No  residual  value  was   considered.  Sensitivity  analysis for the  EIRR\ndemonstrates  that  the  Project  remains  viable  even  with  adverse  movements  in  some\nparameters  such  as  increase  in  capital  cost,  increase  in  LRMC  at  the  generation  level,  or\nconstruction delays. Results of a switching value analysis are also provided in Appendix 13.\n\n6.\n\nMacroeconomic Effects\n\n89.\nAs  a  direct  consequence  of  the  sector  inefficiencies,  the  country  is  experiencing\nsubstantial  power  supply  constraints  that  have  led  to  almost  daily  load-shedding.  Uninterrupted\npower  supply  was  available  on  only  30  days  of  FY1999.  Scheduled  load-shedding  exists  in\nparallel with the more frequent unscheduled load-shedding causing great disruption to economic\nactivity.22  Direct  short-run  costs  consist  of  spoilage  and  damage  due  to  unscheduled  loan-\nshedding.  They  include  shutdown  and  restart  costs  of  equipment  and  reflect  the  opportunity\ncosts  of  under-utilization  of  production  factors  due  to  rescheduling  of  activities  as  a  result  of\ncontrolled load-shedding. Indirect short-run costs reflect the multiplier effects resulting from the\ntypical interdependence between one firm\u2019s input and another output. Long-run costs reflect the\n                                               \n22 This is based on Sanghvi, Arun P., 1991 Power Shortages in Developing Countries.\n\n\f23\n\nconsumers'  adaptation  strategies  as  a  result  of  their  expectations  that  power  shortages  will\npersist.  In  the domestic  sector  this  can  result  in  the  purchase  of  voltage  regulators  to  protect\nequipment and in investment in battery sets with inverters to run small appliances like fans and\ntelevisions. In the industry sector, the unreliability of the grid supply has led to heavy investment\nin captive generation.\n\nA  World  Bank  study23  found  that  in  FY1998  alone,  generators  with  a  total  capacity  of\n90.\n50 MW were imported into Bangladesh at a total cost of $24 million. Since these machines run\nmainly  on oil  or diesel,  the fuel  will  also  need  to be  imported,  and total  costs to  the  economy\ncould  be  as  high  as  $200  million.  These  expenditures  on  captive  power  generation  have\ntherefore  heavy  opportunity  costs  in  terms  of,  for  example,  reduced  investment  for  capacity\nexpansion  in  other  sectors,  and  represent  a  misallocation  of  funds.  In  addition  to  slowing\nindustrial output, power shortages  also result in increased imports and a decrease of exports,\nwith  potentially  adverse  impacts on  national  income, employment, foreign  exchange  reserves,\nand foreign direct investments.\n\n7.\n\nTariff Analysis\n\n91.\nThe Electricity  Act  of  1910, as amended by  the  1972  Presidential  Decree  59,  requires\nthe electricity sector to earn a reasonable return after meeting its operating costs, debt service,\nand  depreciation.  The  Government  is  responsible  for  making  tariff  adjustments,  except  in  the\ncase of the PBSs which, being privately owned, are able to set their own tariffs.\n\nUntil  September  1996, \n\nthe  weighted  average  national \n\n92.\ntariff  was  Tk2.34/kWh\n($0.49/kWh),  or about 50  percent  of  the  LRMC  at  the  distribution  level  as  computed  in  1996.\nThe  Government  raised  electricity  tariffs  by  9.72  percent  effective  1  October  1996,  and  an\nadditional  5.21  percent  effective  1  December  1996,  for  a  total  increase  of  14.93  percent.\nEffective 1 January 1997, tariffs are now reviewed every six months and automatically adjusted\nas required, to take into account variations in key input costs, namely, fuel costs and exchange\nrates,  the  last being  in  September 1999.  Future tariff  revisions  will  be  set  by  the  independent\nregulatory commission that will be established as part of the reforms.\n\n93.\n  By  the  end  of  FY1998,  the  weighted  national  tariff  was  Tk2.76/kWh  ($.0575/kWh),\nabout 59 percent of the LRMC at the distribution level. However, with the commissioning of IPPs\nwith  lower  tariffs  over  the  next  few  years,  the  LRMC  will  be  reduced  substantially.  As  a\nconsequence, the average national retail tariff at its 1999 level will be about 71  percent of  the\nrecalculated LRMC at the distribution level. It is expected that the impact of the sector reforms,\nwhich include specific targets for loss reductions, will contribute to an improving ratio of tariff to\nLRMC.  With  poor  operating  efficiencies,  the  sector  penalizes  consumers  who  pay  for  their\nelectricity  rather  than  those  who  do  not.  Therefore,  raising  tariffs,  without  concomittant\nimprovements in efficiency is inequitable. In the future, the  regulatory  commission  will  have to\nbalance tariff revisions with the mandated efficiency improvements on the side of the utilities so\nas not to punish customers who are paying their bills. In preparing financial projections for the\nEAs,  it  is  assumed  that  average  bulk  tariffs  (including  transmission  charges)  will  remain\nconstant in nominal terms for the next six years, and from that time forward, will increase in line\nwith  domestic  inflation.  Average  retail  tariffs  are  projected  to  remain  constant  in  real  terms,\nincreasing only to reflect the effect of domestic inflation.\n\n                                               \n23 Data from World Bank\u2019s draft Bangladesh: Energy Strategy Note, December 1998.\n\n\fB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n24\n\n94.\nThe Project is designed to promote economic growth by increasing the access to electricity\nsupply in the Dhaka area, including the rural areas supplied by the PBSs from DESA. The Project is\nexpected  to  provide  a  reliable  power  supply,  thereby  improving  chances  of  industrialization  and\nproviding  employment  opportunities.  Reliable  electric  supply  will  also  enhance  education,  health,\nand security facilities.\n\n95.\nAlthough the Project is essentially gender neutral, there are benefits that will be derived by\nwomen  as  a  result  of  electricity  supply,  such  as  education,  security,  and  more  comfortable  living.\nWith  the  advantage  of  better  lighting,  women  can  spend  more  time  on  education  or  other  home-\nbased  vocations.  Community  televisions  in  the  villages  can  improve  general  knowledge  of  health,\nhygiene, and prevention of diseases. Street lighting will provide better security to women after dark.\nFurther, women will derive distinctive benefits through their mandatory representation on the board\nof directors of the PBSs. Each PBS reserves 5 of its 15 director seats for female advisers, who serve\nas  channels  for  expression  of  women  development's  needs  in  the  given  area.  As  the  PBSs  are\nresponsible  for  planning  local  distribution  system  expansions,  the  Project  provides  women  with  a\nchance to actively participate in the development process.\n\nThe  Project  furthers \n\n96.\nthe  development  of  the  PBSs,  which  are  special  purpose\nnongovernment organizations. REB, as one of the project EAs, relies on the PBSs to operate and\nmaintain  the  distribution  network  after  physical  construction  is  completed  by  it,  thereby  shifting\nresponsibility for output sustainability to the PBSs. The PBSs operate on a nonprofit basis and do\nnot allow their annually elected unpaid directors to hold any political or government appointment,\nmandate,  or  employment.  The  PBSs  have  multidimensional  development  roles  including\ncommunity  mobilization,  capacity  building,  and  direct  management  and  monitoring  of  project\noutputs.\n\n97.\nThe domestic tariff structure  incorporates a  lifeline tariff of Tk 2.00/kWh ($0.04) for the first\n300 kWh per month.  This energy amount  is  more than  sufficient  to  cover  electricity  consumed  for\nlight, one or two fans, and small household appliances, which is considered the need for electricity\nconsumption  of  a  lower  middle  class  household.  While  increasing  tariffs  in  the  past,  it  has  been\nensured that this lifeline tariff is affordable by the lower income groups. About 100 kWh is expected\nto meet basic needs of the urban and rural poor for lights and fans.\n\n98.\nAlthough there are no layoffs envisaged as part of this Project, the overall  reforms process\nwill, in the future, lead to surpluses of  certain categories of BPDB and DESA staff. Such staff can be\nretrained  in  other  skills  for  redeployment  in  REB,  DESCO,  and  BPDB's  successor  organizations.\nStaff who are  not  employable  in  the  sector  will  be  given  separation  compensation  packages.  The\npower  sector agencies,  in  association  with  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies,  will  conduct  studies  next\nyear and evolve an appropriate scheme to mitigate the social impact of the reforms.\n\nC.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n99.\nAs  per  ADB's  classification,  the  Project  does  not  directly  address  poverty  reduction\nbecause  the  primary  beneficiaries  are  largely  the  industrial,  commercial,  and  domestic\nconsumers,  both  rural  and  urban,  in  the  Dhaka  area.  This  mix  of  consumers  is  important  to\nsafeguard the financial and  economic  viability of  the  Project.  However, the  Project  yields  very\nattractive  economic  returns,  and  with  increasing  employment  opportunities  as  a  result  of\nelectrification,  there  will  be  trickle-down  benefits  for  the  poor.  Power  outages  affect  small\nbusinesses  more  than  larger  ones  \u2014  the  small  shopkeeper  and  the  artisan,  as  well  as  the\nresidential  consumers  who  cannot  afford  backup  generators.  Although  no\npoorer \n\n\f25\n\ncomprehensive  survey  was  carried  out,  estimates  from  various  manufacturers\u2019  associations  in\nBangladesh indicate that industrial production could be about 10 percent higher if reliable power\nis available in sufficient quantity. Power constraints have a direct impact on low-income workers\nas  can  be  illustrated  by  the  example  of  the  ready-made  garment  manufacturing  (RMG)\nindustries.  RMG  manufacturing  plays  a  dominant  role  in  the  country\u2019s  export  sector  and\ncontributes significantly to the national economy, but depends heavily on recurrent orders from\nforeign  clients.  Once  a  producer  is  not  able  to  deliver  on  time  due  to  exogenous  factors  like\nenergy shortage it will be more difficult to secure new orders from international clients who were\ndefaulted.  Since  RMG  manufacturers  employ  about  1.5  million  workers,  including  about\n1.25 million women, who constitute a significant fraction of the low-income population in Dhaka,\nthese will be the first to suffer from suspension of production and decline in foreign orders as the\nworkers are paid on a daily  basis  and  have  no  social  safety net.  Moreover,  the  income  of  the\ngarment  industry  workers  represents  a  major  share  of  business  for  the  owners  of  small-scale\nretail outlets, who depend on the purchasing power of the RMG employees.  Thus  the Project,\nby improving reliability of power supply has a direct impact on the poor, especially women.\n\n100.\nThe  multiplier  effect  of  electricity  on  the  local  rural  economy  was  emphasized  by  the\nfindings  of  a  USAID-funded  comprehensive  field  study  carried  out  in  1996  to  investigate  the\neconomic  and  social  impact  of  the  rural  electrification  programs  implemented  through  the\nPBSs.24 A general finding of the study was that the creation of PBSs has caused local markets\nto expand and has given rise to a new class of entrepreneurs. Since the launch of the program,\n6,000 direct jobs were created in the PBSs and REB. As the PBSs mature, and the industries\ngrow  more  established,  the  use  of  local  raw  material  also  increases  thereby  establishing  a\nsupport economy  that  increases  local  employment and  cash  income.  This  has  resulted  in  the\ncreation of about 7,500 jobs at various industries and shops, which have opened in response to\nthe  demands  created  by  the  program.  The  establishment  of  industries  as  a  result  of\nelectrification,  their  growth,  and  the  creation  of  a  support  industry  for  industrial  inputs  has\nanother  beneficial  aspect  on  the  local  economy  \u2014  the  gradual  development  of  local  demand\nmarkets.\n\n101. A  long-term research study on rural poverty,  25 published in 1995, covered 62  villages\nrepresenting 57 of 64 districts in Bangladesh. One of the articles compiled in the book analyzes\nthe  determinants  of  poverty  and  their  relative  significance.  One  of  the  six  major  factors\nidentified,  physical  infrastructure,  was  defined  to  comprise  rural  electrification,  irrigation,  and\ntransport facilities.\n\n102.\nThe  methodology  employed  consisted  of  comparing  electrified  with  nonelectrified\nvillages. The incidence of poverty was estimated for electrified villages and was then compared\nwith  that  of  villages  without  access  to  electricity.  Poverty  was  substantially  reduced  on  with\nspread  of  electrification.  Only  14  percent  of  the  residents  in  electrified  villages  are  hard  core\npoor, defined as persons whose aggregate expenditure falls below the normative poverty line of\n2,112 calories per day plus a 30 percent allowance for nonfood basis needs, as compared with\n31 percent for unelectrified villages. The matched figure for moderate poverty is 27 percent and\n31 percent respectively. It was thus concluded by the researchers that the extreme poor benefit\nmore from rural electrification than the moderate poor.\n\n103.\nFurther, it was speculated that the benefit may have originated more from the generation\nof employment opportunities in the rural nonfarm sector than from increasing the profitability per\n\n                                               \n24 Socioeconomic Impact Estimation of the Rural Electrification Program in Bangladesh,  NRECA  International  Ltd.,\n\nUSA for USAID.\n\n25  Edited  by  Rahman,  H.Z.  and  Hossain,  M.  eds.  1995 Rethinking Rural Poverty \u2013 Bangladesh as a Case Study\u2019\n\npublished by H.Z. Rahman in 1995, The University Press Limited, Chapter 15.5\n\n\f26\n\nunit of land. This was supported by the finding that the incidence  of poverty for  households  in\nthe  land-size  category  of  2.5-4.3  acres  is  almost  the  same  for  electrified  and  nonelectrified\nvillages. For the functionally landless and the small farm households, poverty was found to be\nsubstantially lower for villages with access to electricity.\n\n 104. ADB recently initiated a study by staff consultants to undertake a similar kind of analysis\nfor the greater Dhaka area with a special focus on the urban poor. The study will quantify and\nassess  the  socioeconomic  benefits  of  electrification  and  improved  electricity  supply.  In\nparticular,  the  study  will  analyze  the  actual  expenditures  on  energy  in  electrified  and\nnonelectrified  households  for  comparable  energy  outputs,  and  the  impact  of  electrification  on\nproductive activities and on service delivery of public service institutions like clinics and schools.\nThe study will also explore whether a link between the  provision  of  reliable electricity  services\nand expansion, turnover, and employment of micro and small business can be established. Until\nnow  all  research  has  focused  on  the  rural  population;  none  has  assessed  how  the  urban\npopulation  is  coping  with  the  present  inadequate  energy  supply,  what  share  of  their\nexpenditures  is  allocated  for  energy  consumption,  which  of  their  activities  (industrial,\ncommercial,  household)  could  be  facilitated  by  switching  over  to  electricity  if  it  is  adequately\nsupplied, and up to what extent the urban poor would be willing and able to pay for enhanced\nelectricity services. Appendix 14 provides the outline terms of reference for the study.\n\nD.\n\nProject Risks\n\n105.\nThe  success  of  the  Project  is  dependent  on  (i)  implementation  of  the  Meghnaghat\n(Phase-1)  and  Haripur  projects,  at  least  by  FY2002;  and  (ii)  maintenance  of  tariffs  to  ensure\nfinancial viability of PGCB, DESA and DESCO. The project FIRR and EIRR were tested for these\nsensitivities  and  found  to  be  robust.  Additionally,  to  mitigate  the  first  risk,  the  Project  was\nprocessed  only  after  the  contracts  for  the  Haripur  and  Meghnaghat  projects  were  signed.  To\nminimize the second risk, (i) covenants were proposed to ensure the financial viability of PGCB,\nDESA, and DESCO for the short term; and (ii) the legal framework for the sector is being changed\nand  an  independent  regulatory  authority  established.  The  ADB  has  accorded  TA  to  the  new\nregulatory authority to support its operationalization 26.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government,  DESA,  DESCO,  PGCB,  and  REB  have  given  the  following\n106.\nassurances, in addition to the standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal\ndocuments:\n\n(i)\n\nUntil the establishment of an energy regulatory body, the Government will ensure\nthat PGCB\u2019s transmission tariffs are reviewed every six months and are adjusted\nto  reflect  the  impacts  of  inflation  and  foreign  currency  fluctuations.  The\ntransmission  tariffs  will  be  sufficient  to  ensure  full  cost  recovery  for  operation,\nmaintenance  and  financial  charges,  and  an  adequate  rate  of  return  on\ninvestment. \n\n(ii)\n\nBy  30  June  2000,  (a)  DESA  will  transfer  its  assets  in  the  Gulshan  distribution\ncircle to DESCO; and (b) the Government will cause BPDB to transfer to PGCB\n\n                                               \n26 TA No. 3129-BAN: Support for an Energy Regulatory Authority, for $900,000, approved on 16 December 1998.\n\n\f27\n\nthe Tongi and Hasnabad 230 kV substations and the Haripur-Hasnabad 230 kV\ntransmission line, all under arrangements satisfactory to ADB.\n\nThe Government will ensure that all local currency funds required for the Project\nare (i) committed in advance of its Annual Development Program on the basis of\nanticipated expenditure for the relevant year, and (ii) transferred to the concerned\nProject EAs at least three months prior to the anticipated need or disbursement.\n\nThe Government will cause DESA, DESCO, PGCB, and REB to carry out benefit\nmonitoring and evaluation activities under the Project for their respective Parts of\nthe Project. These activities will be reviewed periodically by ADB and will include\nverification of the number of new connections, the consumer categories of such\nconnections,  and  the  improvement  of  service  to  consumers  in  Dhaka  and  its\nenvirons.\n\nPGCB will implement land acquisition and compensation under the Project on a\ntimely  basis  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  plan  agreed  upon  by  the\nBorrower,  PGCB and  ADB.  The Government,  PGCB and  ADB  will  carry out  an\nassessment  of  the  resettlement  plan  during  the  second  year  of  Project\nimplementation. If the number of persons to be resettled is assessed to be more\nthan  100,  PGCB  will  prepare  and  implement  a  revised  resettlement  plan\nsatisfactory to ADB.\n\nBy FY2003, DESCO will maintain the following operational standards: (i) systems\nlosses of not more than 18 percent computed on a monthly basis; (ii) a collection\nto  import  ratio  of  not  less  than  75  percent,  and  as  from  FY2005,  not  less  than\n80 percent;  (iii)  accounts  receivable  to  represent  not  more  than  two months  of\nsales;  and  (iv)  payables  for  electricity  import  to  represent  not  more  than  one\nmonth\u2019s average import.\n\nBy FY2003, DESA will maintain the following operational standards:  (i)  systems\nlosses of not more than 18 percent computed on a monthly basis; (ii) a collection\nto import ratio of not less than 80 percent; (iii) accounts  receivable  to  represent\nnot  more  than  two  months  of  sales;  and  (iv)  payables  for  electricity  import  to\nrepresent not more than six months of electricity purchases.\n\nBy  FY2003,  REB  will  cause  the  PBSs  to  maintain  the  following  operational\nstandards:  (i)  systems  losses  of  not  more  than  18  percent  computed  on  a\nmonthly  basis;  (ii)  a  collection  to  import  ratio  of  not  less  than  80  percent;\n(iii) accounts  receivable  to  represent  not  more  than  three  months  of  sales;  and\n(iv)  payables  for  electricity  import  to  represent  not  more  than  two  months  of\nelectricity purchases.\n\nBy FY 2003, PGCB will maintain the following operational standards: (i) a loss of\nload  probability of  less  than  1  percent; and  (ii)  transmission  losses at  less  than\n4 percent.\n\nThe  Government  will  make  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  invest  in\nDESCO as cash equity as follows: in FY2000, Tk300 million; and in FY2001 and\nFY2002, Tk400 million for each fiscal year.\n\nThe  Government  will  make  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  invest  in\nPGCB as  cash  equity  as  follows:  in  FY2001,  Tk100  million;  and  in  FY2002,\nTk 300 million.\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\n(viii)\n\n(ix)\n\n(x) \n\n(xi)\n\n\f28\n\n(xii)\n\n(xiii)\n\n(xiv)\n\n(xv)\n\nAs  from  FY2003,  DESCO  will  maintain  (i)  a  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  not\nless than 1.2; (ii) a current ratio of not less than 1.1; and (iii) a debt to equity ratio\nof not more than 70 to 30.\n\nDESCO will ensure that dividends are not declared unless DESCO maintains, for\na  period  of  at  least 12  consecutive  months,  (i)  a debt service  coverage  ratio  of\nnot less than 1.3; (ii) a current ratio of not less than 1.2; and (iii) a cash balance\nrepresenting not less than 6 months of future debt service obligations.\n\nAs  from  FY2003,  REB  will  cause  the  PBSs  to  maintain  (i)  a  debt  service\ncoverage ratio of not less than 1.2; and (ii) a current ratio of not less than 1.1.\n\nAs from FY2003, PGCB will maintain: (i) a debt service coverage ratio of not less\nthan 1.2; (ii) a current ratio of not less than 1.1; and (iii) a debt to equity ratio of\nnot more than 70 to 30.\n\n(xvi)  PGCB will ensure that dividends are not declared unless PGCB maintains, for a\nperiod of at least 12 consecutive months, (i) a debt service coverage ratio of not\nless  than  1.3;  (ii)  a current  ratio  of  not  less  than  1.2; and  (iii)  a  cash  balance\nrepresenting not less than 6 months of future debt service obligations.\n\nB. \n\nConditions of Award of Contract\n\n107.

This program will also incorporate upgraded versions\nof the technical training currently provided by REB.\n\n2. \n\nThe consultant will:\n\n(i) \n\nreview  the  current  training,  both  technical  and  managerial,  being  provided  by\nREB to staff of the PBSs;\n\n(ii) \n\nreview REB's facilities for training and management development;\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\ndevelop  an  appropriate  curriculum  for  the  institute,  taking  into  account  the\ntechnical and managerial long-term needs of the PBSs;\n\ndesign the delivery of the program and identify hardware as  well  as faculty and\ntraining resources for the suggested curriculum;\n\ndevelop the detailed designs for the institute buildings and facilities, prepare bid\ndocuments  for  its  construction,  assist  with  the  bid  process,  and  supervise\nconstruction;\n\nprovide  assistance  in  locating  appropriate  faculty  for  delivering  the  training\nprograms; and\n\nsuggest methods to progressively introduce more local training faculty, including\ntraining for trainers.\n\nIt  is  expected  that  about  30  person-months  of  international  consulting  will  be  needed\n3. \nfrom  a  firm  specializing  in  conceptualization,  design,  architecture,  and  engineering  of  training\nand  management  development  institutes.  The  consultants  will  be  supported  by  about\n50 person-months  of  domestic  consulting  with  expertise  in  engineering,  architecture,  and\ntraining methods.\n\n4.\nIn  addition  to  consulting  services,  the  Project  will  also  include  provision  of  up  to\n20 person-months  of  international  and  20  person-months  of  domestic  faculty  to  develop  and\ndeliver key training programs, as well as funds to purchase training aids and equipment.\n\nIt  is  expected that  the  services  will  commence  in  July 2000 and be completed  in  June\n\n5.\n2003.\n\n\fAppendix 8, page 1\n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS\n\nA. \n\nGeneral\n\nThe  Project  will  be  executed  by  four  separate  executing  agencies:  (i)  Part  A  will  be\n1.\nexecuted  by  Power  Grid  Company  of  Bangladesh  (PGCB);  (ii)  Part  B(i)  by  the  Rural\nElectrification Board (REB); (iii) Part B(ii) by the Dhaka Electric Supply Company (DESCO); and\n(iv)  Part  B(iii)  by  the  Dhaka  Electric  Supply  Authority  (DESA).  Upon  completion  of  Part  B(i),\nassets, operation and debt repayment obligations will pass from REB to the seven Palli Bidyut\nSamitys  (PBSs)  participating  in  the  Project  (Dhaka-1,  Dhaka-2,  Narshingdi-1,  Narshingdi-2,\nManikgonj,  Mymensing-1,  and  Munshigonj).  The  PBSs  are  rural  electricity  cooperatives.  Both\nPGCB  and  DESCO  are  limited  liability  companies  registered  under  the  Companies  Act  1994;\nPGCB was incorporated on 21 November 1996 and DESCO on 3 November 1996. DESA is a\nstatutory  authority  of  the  Government  created  by  the  DESA  Ordinance  of  1990  (Presidential\nOrdinance No. 6 of 1990).\n\nFinancial  projections  were  completed  on  an  executing  agency  basis.  As  asset\n2.\nownership, debt service obligations, and operating and maintenance responsibilities for Part B(i)\nwill eventually lie with the PBSs, a consolidated model was produced based on the actual and\nprojected performance of the seven PBSs.\n\nB. \n\nPast Financial Performance\n\n3.\nAlthough  established  in  1996,  PGCB  has  just  commenced  commercial  operations.\nBalance sheets and statements of  preliminary expenses have been  maintained  in accordance\nwith acceptable accounting standards.\n\n4.\nOf  the  seven  PBSs  participating  in  the  Project,  five  have  existing  operations.  Two,\nDhaka-2  and  Munshigonj,  are  newly  established  PBSs.  At  Project  appraisal,  the  financial\npositions of the operational  PBSs  varied.  Dhaka-1  and  Narshingdi-1  are  performing  well,  with\nhealthy balance sheets and  sound  profitability.  The  remaining  three are  in  the  initial  stages  of\noperation, balance sheets are sound, and they are gradually improving their overall profitability,\nhowever they continue to rely heavily on Government subsidies.\n\n5.\nAlthough  incorporated  in  1996,  DESCO  began  commercial  operations  in  September\n1998  when  approximately  58  percent  of  DESA\u2019s  Mirpur  distribution  circle  was  formally\ntransferred from DESA. At project appraisal, DESCO had completed nine months of operations.\nInitial  operating  performance  was  lower  than  originally  expected.  The  actual  number  of\nconsumers absorbed from DESA was considerably higher  than  DESA  records  indicated.  This,\ncoupled  with  some  initial  start-up  problems  resulted  in  financial  losses  during  these  first  few\nmonths  of  operation.  While  this  is  to  be  expected  from  a  start-up  company,  DESCO\nmanagement has been requested to implement measures to improve the overall situation.\n\nDESA  commenced  operations  in  1991,  upon  separation  from  the  Bangladesh  Power\n6.\nDevelopment  Board  (BPDB).  Legal  title  to  distribution  assets  in  the  Dhaka  Metropolitan  Area\nwas transferred to DESA with the corresponding long-term domestic and foreign debt. After six\nyears of commercial operations, with dismal operational and financial performance, DESA has a\nnegative net worth as of 30 June 1998 of Tk.2,374 million.\n\n\fAppendix 8, page 2\n\nC\n\nFinancial Projections\n\n1. \n\nGeneral\n\nThe effect of the proposed Project on  the financial  position of PBCB,  the  seven  PBSs,\n7.\nDESCO,  and  DESA  are  reflected  in  the  financial  projections  for  PGCB  (presented  in  Tables\nA8.1  -  A8.3),  the  PBSs  (Tables  A8.4-A8.6),  DESCO  (Tables  A8.7-A8.9)  and  DESA  (Tables\nA8.10-A8.12).  These  have  been  prepared  on  a  nominal  basis  based  on  major  assumptions\noutlined in the following paragraphs.\n\n8.\nDomestic inflation rates are assumed to be 7 percent for 1999, 5 percent for 2000, and\n4.5  percent  thereafter,  while  international  inflation  rates  are  assumed  to  be  2.4  percent\nthroughout the projection period.\n\n9.\nAlthough it is expected that the entire asset base of DESA will be absorbed by DESCO\nin the near future, the exact timing and details of the transfer were unclear at the time of project\nappraisal. As such, DESA financial performance is projected to 2020 in line with the projections\nprepared and presented for PGCB, the PBSs, and DESCO.\n\n2. \n\nRevenues and Cost of Sales\n\na. \n\nTransmission Revenues/Electricity Sales\n\n10.\nPGCB\u2019s  revenues  are  derived  from  the  transmission  of  electricity.  A  partial  transfer  of\ntransmission assets from BPDB  was  effected  in  October  1999.  It  has  been  assumed  that  the\ntransfer of assets associated with the Project will be completed by 1 July 2000 with the balance\nof BPDB transmission assets being transferred to PGCB by 1 July 2003.  For the purpose of the\nfinancial projections, it has been assumed that the transmission tariff will computed following a\nfull cost recovery methodology. An Operating and Maintenance provision has been assumed at\n2.0 percent of average fixed asset balance increased in line with domestic inflation. In addition\ndepreciation, foreign exchange  losses  and  taxes have been covered  by  the  tariff.  It  has  been\nassumed  that  a  gross  margin  on  average  historical  fixed  assets  of  10  percent  constitutes  a\nreasonable return.\n\n11.\nFor  the  purpose  of  the  financial  projections,  it  is  assumed  that  the  PBSs  will  assume\nownership of assets and the customer base associated with the Project by the end of December\n1999, and that DESCO will assume ownership of assets and the customer base of the Gulshan\nDistribution  Circle  by  1  July  2000.  Sales  projections  are  based  on  consumer  connection\nsummaries provided by REB and DESA. It is assumed that growth in electricity sales will result\nfrom  (i)  reduced  brownouts  and  availability  of  additional  power  from  the  Independent  Power\nProducer  (IPP)  plants;  (ii)  new  consumption  as  a  result  of  project  investments;  and  (iii) new\nconsumption as a result of efficiency improvements.\n\nb.\n\nElectricity Importation\n\n12.\nThe PBSs and DESCO purchase power from BPDB and DESA; DESA purchases power\ndirectly from  BPDB.  The  amount  of  power  purchased  will  be  a  function  of  consumer  demand\nand system losses. According to PBS records, system losses, both technical and nontechnical,\nrange  from  14  to  40  percent  of  bulk  power  purchases.  It  is  assumed  that  through  technical\nimprovements  and  efficiency  measures,  the  PBSs  will  be  able  to  reduce  the  losses  to\n14 percent  over  seven  years  after  assuming  operations  of  a  distribution  area  from  DESA.\nAccording  to  DESA  records,  historical  systems  losses,  both  technical  and  nontechnical,\n\n\fAppendix 8, page 3\n\namounted  to  27  percent  of  bulk  power  purchases  for  the  Dhaka  Metropolitan  Area  (after\nsegregating  the  rural  distribution  areas handed  over  to  the  PBSs).  It  is  assumed  that  through\ntechnical improvements and efficiency measures, that DESCO and DESA will be able to reduce\nsystems losses to 18 percent over a five-year period.\n\nc.\n\nBulk Power Purchase and Retail Tariffs\n\n13.\nThe PBSs, and DESA purchase power at a bulk selling rate. DESCO purchases power\nfrom DESA at the bulk rate plus a 2.5 percent wheeling charge. Since 1996, bulk power tariffs\nhave  been  reviewed  and  adjusted  every  six  months  with  average  increases  of  approximately\n3 to 4 percent per annum. With the commissioning of the IPP plants, the overall efficiency in the\ngeneration subsector is expected to improve dramatically, and the efficiency gains are expected\nto  compensate  for  any  increase  in  general  price  levels.  As  such,  it  is  expected  that  the  bulk\npower tariff will remain constant until 2003 and will increase in line with domestic inflation from\n2004 onward.\n\nThe PBSs have the authority to set retail tariffs, with the exception of agricultural tariffs,\n14.\nwhich  are  established  by  the  Government.  Tariffs  are  reviewed  regularly;  the  PBSs  tend  to\ncharge about 50 percent higher than DESA or DESCO. Given the projected stability in the bulk\npower tariff, it is assumed that the average retail tariff will level off and remain constant in real\nterms, therefore, the assumed growth in the weighted average retail tariff is limited to effects of\ndomestic inflation.\n\n15.\nIt is assumed that DESCO will sell electricity to consumers following DESA\u2019s retail tariff\nstructure.  DESA\u2019s  retail  tariffs  are  reviewed  every  six  months,  and  since  1995,  have  been\nincreasing  at  a  rate  of  approximately  8  percent  per  annum.  However,  given  the  projected\nstability  of  the  bulk  power  tariff,  it  is  assumed  that  the  average  retail  tariff  will  level  off  and\nremain constant in real terms, therefore the assumed growth in the weighted average retail tariff\nis limited to the effects of domestic inflation.\n\n3. \n\nExpenses\n\na. \n\nOperating Expenses\n\n16.\nIt  is  assumed  that  PGCB\u2019s  operating  expenses  will  include  repairs  and  maintenance,\nmaterials  and  equipment,  salaries  and  wages,  contract  labor,  and  administrative  charges.\nFinancial  projections  are  based  on  a  budget  prepared  by  the  company  and  local  costs  are\nprojected to increase in line with domestic inflation. An average depreciation rate of 3.0 percent\nper annum is charged, on a declining balance basis, against the historical value of fixed assets.\nPreliminary expenses are amortized over a 10-year period commencing in 2001.\n\n17.\nIt  is  assumed  that  the  PBSs  operating  expenses  include  distribution,  consumer\naccounts,  consumer  services,  sales,  administrative  and  general  expenses,  and  depreciation.\nExpenses are based on historical performance, taking into consideration the impact of domestic\ninflation.  An  average  depreciation  rate  of  3.0  percent  per  annum  is  charged,  on  a  declining\nbalance basis, against the historical value of fixed assets.\n\nIt is assumed that DESCO\u2019s operating expenses will include operation and maintenance,\n18.\ncommercial  (billing  and  collections),  salaries  and  wages,  depreciation,  amortization,  and\nadministrative  charges.  The  level  of  operating  expenses  is    based  on  existing  contracts,  and\nbudgets prepared by DESCO taking into account the impact of domestic  inflation.  An  average\ndepreciation rate of 5 percent per annum is charged, on a declining balance basis, against the\n\n\fAppendix 8, page 4\n\nhistorical  value  of  fixed  assets.  Preliminary  expenses  and  computer  software  development\nexpenditures are amortized over a five-year period commencing in 1999.\n\n19.\nIt  is  assumed  that  DESA\u2019s  operating  expenses  will  include  distribution,  commercial,\ngeneral, administrative, and depreciation expense. Expense assumptions are based on DESA\u2019s\nhistorical  financial  performance  adjusted  to  reflect  the  impact  of  assets  and  operations\ntransferred  to  DESCO  and  the  PBSs  under  ADB's    Ninth Power Project 1 and  the  proposed\nProject.  An  average  depreciation  rate  of  3.2  percent  per  annum  is  charged,  on  a  declining\nbalance basis, against fixed assets.\n\nb. \n\nInterest Expense\n\nPGCB\u2019s  current  debt  position  was  analyzed,  and  based  on  available  information,  an\n20.\namortization  schedule  was  prepared  to  project  annual  interest  expenditures.  PBCB  has\nassumed  debt  and  equity  associated  with  assets  transferred  from  BPDB.  In  addition,  future\ncapital expansion will be financed  through  a  combination  of  equity, domestic and  international\ndebt, and  supplier\u2019s  credit.  Interest  expense  under Ninth Power Project  was  computed  on  the\nbasis of a Special Funds resources (SFR) service charge of 1 percent per annum together with\na domestic markup of 7 percent per annum. Interest expense for the Project loan is computed\non the basis of an ordinary capital resources (OCR) interest charge estimated at 7 percent per\nannum with a local mark-up of 1 percent per annum.\n\n21.\nThe PBSs carry debt associated with capital expansion activities. The entire capital cost\nis  booked  as  debt  to  the  PBSs,  however,  the  interest  and  repayment  terms  are  heavily\nsubsidized. The existing debt situation at 30 June 1998 was analyzed and debt amortization and\ninterest expense used in the financial projections is based on that analysis. Interest expense for\nthe loan associated with the Project was computed on the basis of an SFR  interest charge of\n1.5  percent  per  annum  with  a  local  markup  of  1.5  percent  per  annum.  The  PBSs  are  not\nresponsible  for  the  foreign  currency  risk,  as  such,  foreign-sourced  borrowings  are  booked  in\ndomestic currency.\n\n22.\nDESCO assumed debt and equity in association with the transfer of assets from DESA.\nIt is assumed that the interest rate on debt to DESA will be 8 percent per annum. The interest\nexpense  on  Ninth Power Project  was  computed  on  the  basis  of  an  SFR  service  charge  of\n1 percent per annum together with a domestic markup of 7 percent per annum. Interest expense\nfor the project loan is computed on the basis of an OCR interest charge estimated 7 percent per\nannum with a local markup of 1 percent per annum. The existing and proposed Bank lending is\nthe only foreign debt held by DESCO.\n\nDESA  carries  a  heavy  debt  burden,  with  significant  domestic  and  foreign  currency\n23.\ndenominated  debt.  The  existing  debt  situation  as  of  30  June  1998  was  analyzed,  and  debt\namortization  and  interest expense  is  based  upon  that  analysis.  Interest  expense  on  loan  was\ncomputed on the basis of an SFR service charge of 1 percent together with a domestic markup\nof 7 percent per annum. Interest expense for the project loan was computed on the basis of an\nSFR interest charge of 1.5 percent per annum with a local markup of 6.5 percent per annum.\n\nc. \n\nTax Expense and Dividend Payment\n\n24.\nThe PBSs, given their cooperative status, are exempt from payment of corporate income\ntax.  For  PGCB,  DESCO,  and  DESA  income  tax  is  computed  at  40  percent  per  annum.  It  is\n\n                                               \n1 \n\nLoan BAN 1505(SF):Ninth Power, for $134.4 million, approved on 18 December 1996.\n\n\ffurther assumed that PGCB and DESCO will be in a position to begin distributing dividends by\n2006.  Dividends  are  assumed  after  taking  into  account  future  debt  service  obligations  and\nworking capital requirements.\n\nAppendix 8, page 5\n\n4.\n\nBalance Sheet Assumptions\n\na. \n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nUntil such time as the entire balance of national transmission assets are transferred from\n25.\nBPDB  to  PGCB,  it  is  assumed  that  the  entire  wheeling  charge  will  be  paid  by  BPDB,  in  its\ncapacity as power generator. The number of total customers is expected to be relatively small.\nAs  such,  it  is  assumed  that  accounts  receivable  will  represent  one  month\u2019s  sales  and  will\nbacked  by  a  line  of  credit  issued  by  the  customers.  As  such,  no  provision  is  assumed  for\ndoubtful accounts.\n\n26.\nAccounts  receivable  for  the  PBSs,  as  of  30  June  1998,  on  average  represent  almost\n5 months\u2019 total sales. It is assumed that as the PBSs gain operational experience, they will be\nable to reduce this, on average to 3 months by 2002. It is assumed that a provision for doubtful\naccounts will be maintained at 5 percent of the total accounts receivable balance.\n\nFollowing  9  months  of  initial  operations,  DESCO\u2019s  accounts  receivable  balance\n27.\nrepresented 6 months total sales. This was due in part to initial problems with the metering and\nbilling systems, which resulted in delayed production and presentation of invoices. As DESCO\nimproves  its  internal  systems  and  gains  operational  experience,  it  is  expected  that  accounts\nreceivable  will  represent  4  months,  sales  by  the  year  2000  and  then  will  be  maintained  at\n2 months\u2019 sales thereafter. It has further assumed that a provision for doubtful accounts will be\nmaintained at 10 percent of the total accounts receivable balance.\n\nAccounts receivable for DESA, as of 30 June 1998, represented 12 month\u2019s sales. It has\n28.\nbeen  assumed  that  80  percent  of  this  will  be  recovered  over  a  five-year  period,  with  the\nremaining 20 percent written off over the  same period.  From  1999 onward,  it  is  assumed  that\naccounts receivable from new sales will represent 2 months sales. It is assumed that a provision\nfor doubtful accounts will be maintained at 10 percent of the accounts receivable balance.\n\nb.\n\nInventory\n\nIt  is  assumed  that  PGCB  and  DESCO  will  maintain  an  inventory  balance  of\n29.\napproximately  3  months  usage  of  materials  and  spare  parts,  and  that  DESA  will  maintain  an\ninventory balance of approximately 6 months usage of materials and spare parts. PBS inventory\nlevels are projected based upon existing levels adjusted for the planned capital expansion.\n\nc.\n\nAccounts Payable\n\nIt has been assumed that PGCB\u2019s accounts payable will include 1 month of repairs and\n30.\nmaintenance,  contract  fees,  inventory  procurement,  and  administrative  charges.  It  is  also\nassumed that the PBSs accounts payable will include 2 months of  electricity import, 5 months\nother  operating  expenses,  and  six  months  annual  procurement  of  inventory  and  supplies.\nDESCO\u2019s accounts payable are  assumed  to  include one  month  of electricity  import,  operation\nand maintenance, commercial, inventory procurement, and administrative expenditures.\n\n31.\nAs  of  30  June  1998,  accounts  payable  from  DESA  to  BPDB  represented  almost\n12 months  of  electricity  import.  It  is  assumed  that  this  will  be  reduced  to  6  months  by  2002.\n\n\fAppendix 8, page 6\n\nTrade  accounts  payable  for  DESA  are  assumed  to  represent  two  months  of  operation  and\nmaintenance, commercial, inventory procurement, and administrative expenditures.\n\nd. \n\nCapital Expenditures\n\n32.\nCapital  expenditures  are  based  on  the  ongoing  capital  expenditure  and  expansion\nprograms  for  PGCB,  the  PBSs,  DESCO,  and  DESA  to  2005.  Financing  for  the  planned\nexpenditures will be from domestic debt and equity, bilateral assistance, and supplier credit. For\nthe purposes of the financial projections, given the uncertainty for timing and amount of future\nexpenditures, it is assumed that no further investment in capital assets will be made after 2005.\n\ne. \n\nLong-Term Debt\n\n33.\nAs  indicated  in  para.  23,  PGCB\u2019s  existing  debt  position  was  analyzed  and  based  on\navailable  information,  an  amortization  schedule  was  prepared  to  project  annual  interest\nexpenditures,  foreign  exchange  losses  (on  foreign  denominated  debt),  and  debt  service\nobligations.  It  is assumed  that  the project  loan  will  have  a  four-year  grace  period  (to  coincide\nwith the construction timetable) and a 16-year repayment period.\n\n34.\nAs indicated in para. 24, the existing debt position of the PBSs was analyzed, and based\non  available  information,  an  amortization  schedule  was  prepared  to  project  annual  interest\nexpenditures and debt service  obligations.  It  is assumed  that the project  loan  will  be provided\nwith a 5-year grace period and a 20-year repayment period (onlending terms between REB and\nthe PBSs).\n\n35.\nDESCO\u2019s foreign-denominated,  long-term  debt  is  approximately  $24.3  million  provided\nunder loan  1505 and  approximately  $26.4  million for  the proposed project  loan.  It  is  assumed\nthat  the  loan  will  be  granted  with  a  4-year  grace  period  and  a  16-year  repayment  period.\nDESCO\u2019s domestic debt is limited to Tk405 million due to DESA as a result of the transfer of the\nMirpur and Gulshan distribution area assets. The transfer of assets, valued at DESA\u2019s net book\nvalue, has been assumed to be financed on a 60:40 debt to equity ratio. It is assumed that the\ndebt due to DESA will be provided with a 1-year grace period and a 15-year repayment period.\n\n36.\nAs  indicated  in para. 26,  the  existing  debt  situation  of  DESA  as  of  30  June  1998  was\nanalyzed,  and  debt  amortization  and  interest  expense  are  based  upon  that  analysis.  It  is\nassumed  that  the  project  loan  will  be  provided  with  a  4-year  grace  period  and  a  16-year\nrepayment period.\n\nf. \n\nShare Capital\n\n37.\nIt is assumed that PGCB's share capital will increase due to (i) equity financing of assets\ntransferred  from  BPDB;  (ii)  counterpart  financing  under  loan  1505;  (iii) counterpart  financing\nunder the Project; (iv) counterpart financing for ongoing expansion projects (i.e., not financed by\nthe ADB); and (v) additional equity contributions of Tk400 million for 2001-2002. It is assumed\nthat  64  percent  of  the  domestic  financing  obligations  of  the  Project  will  be  financed  through\nequity to comply with the overall debt-equity requirement for the Project of 70:30.\n\nThe PBSs have a cooperative ownership structure. Rather than share capital, member's\n38.\nequity  is derived from  member\u2019s  subscriptions.  The entire  project  cost  will  be  passed  on  from\nREB to the PBSs as a loan, denominated in taka and with concessionary terms; therefore, no\nincrease in member equity is projected.\n\n\fAppendix 8, page 7\n\nIt is assumed that DESCO's share capital will increase due to (i) equity financing of asset\n39.\ntransfers from  DESA;  (ii) counterpart  financing  requirements  under  loan  1505;  (iii)  counterpart\nfinancing requirements under the Project; and (iv) additional equity contributions of Tk1,100 due\nfrom  the  Government  during  the  2000-2003.  It  is  assumed  that  75  percent  of  the  domestic\nfinancing obligations of the Project will be financed through equity to comply with the debt-equity\nrequirement of 70:30.\n\n40.\nIt  is  assumed  DESA  capital  will  increase  as  a  result  of  the  counterpart  financing\nrequirements  under  the  Project.  It  is  assumed  that  57  percent  of  the  domestic  financing\nobligations of the Project will be financed through  equity  to  comply  with an overall  debt-equity\nrequirement of 70:30.\n\n\fAppendix 9, page 8\n\n.\n\n \n\nd\nt\nL\nh\ns\ne\nd\na\ng\nn\na\nB\n\nl\n\n \n\n \nf\no\ny\nn\na\np\nm\no\nC\nd\ni\nr\ng\nr\ne\nw\no\nP\n\n

1\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  by  the  Power  Grid  Company  of\n1.\nBangladesh  Ltd.  and  its  consultants  for  the  Dhaka  Power  System  Upgrade  Project.  The  IEE\nwas submitted to the Department of Environment (DOE) of the Ministry of Environment and Forest on\n4 July  1999.  The  DOE  issued  site  clearance  on  16  September  1999.  The  ADB\u2019s  environment\nspecialist visited the project site on 15 May 1999 to confirm the ADB\u2019s categorization of the Project as\ncategory B, a project with minor environmental impacts that could be easily mitigated using available\ntechnologies. The project components are described in paras. 40-42 of the main text.\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n2.\nThe  project  sites  for  Part  A  consist  of  the  existing  Tongi,  Kalyanpur,  and  Hasnabad\nsubstations, additional 2,000 sqare meter (m2) beside the Kalyanpur substation, 20 acres of land for\nthe  new  Aminbazar  substation  and  the  60  km  right-of-way  for  the  transmission  facilities.  Tongi,\nKalyanpur,  and  Hasnabad  substations  are  located  in  the  mixed  land  uses,  primarily  industrial  and\nresidential, areas that have sprouted up with the availability of more reliable power sources compared\nwith other areas of Dhaka. No new transformers will be installed at the existing premises of Tongi and\nHasnabad substations. Two bays with associated equipment and gantries will be installed each within\nthe  existing  premises  of  these  substations.  At  Kalyanpur  substation,  a  new  transformer  and\nassociated equipment and gantry structure will be installed; this requires additional 2,000 m2 of land to\nbe  acquired  from  an  adjacent  vacant  industrial  land  owned  by  a  state  agency  of  Bangladesh\nAgricultural Development Corporation. The area to be used for expansion of the substation facilities in\nthose areas was cleared and is being maintained for future expansion. The lands are fenced by a 3-m\nhigh concrete wall, and all installations including the proposed expansion are built 3 m from the wall\nfor security purposes. Part B and Part C will not require acquisition of land except about 0.4 hectare of\nland for a new 132 kilovolt (kV) substation at Kamrangichar in Dhaka.\n\n3.\nThe  20  acres  of  land  to  be  acquired  for  the  Aminbazar  substation  is  between  two  existing\ntransmission lines and approximately 200 m  away  from  the highway.  It  is  part  of  an artificial  lagoon\nthat has developed from the manufacture of bricks and was to be a source of fill materials for earlier\nreal estate development in Dhaka. Brick production is still ongoing at  the  other  side  of  the highway.\nThe area  has  marginal  uses  although  some  merchants  have  started  to  fill  the  area  adjacent  to  the\nhighway to build stores. Aminbazar is on the outer fringe of Dhaka.\n\n4.\nThe  air  and  water  quality  around  Tongi,  Aminbazar,  Kalyanpur,  and  Hasnabad  are  polluted\nfrom industrial and domestic waste discharges. Most of the industries in Tongi and Kalyanpur are in\ntextile and garment manufacturing, which require large quantities of hot water. The factories operate\nboilers using fuel oil  and  sometimes using  wastes  and scrap  materials.  The  boilers  have  little  or no\npollution  control  facilities.  The  storm  drains  are  also  the  main  receivers  of  wastewater  discharges.\nDyes  and  highly  colored  wastewater  are  discharged  in  the  storm  drains.  Hasnabad  is  less\nindustrialized.  The  northern  portion  of  Hasnabad  substation  is  bounded  by  the  Buriganga  River.\nFerryboats  serving  Dhaka  and  other  parts  of  the  country  use  the  riverbanks  in  the  vicinity  of  the\nsubstation. The eastern and southern sections are cultivated with rice. The western section is a mixed\nindustrial and residential area.\n\nFrom  Tongi  substation,  the  transmission  line  will  pass  2  km  of  mixed  land  use  area\n5.\nsurrounding  the  substation.  The  air  and  water  quality  in  this  section  is  heavily  polluted.  Then  the\ntransmission  line  right-of-way  will  move  in  parallel  to  the  outer  section  of  the  flood  control  bund\nprotecting Dhaka city and 50 m from an existing transmission  line through  Aminbazar to  Hasnabad.\nThe area outside of the bund is subject to 4 m flood during the peak of the monsoon season. The air\n\n\fAppendix 9, page 2\n\nand  water  quality  in  this  section  is  relatively  unpolluted.  The  main  source  of  air  pollution  is  from\nvehicular traffic and industries transported from the other side of the bund. As the water level on this\nside  of  the  bund  is  often  higher  than  in  the  heavily  populated  section  of  Dhaka,  contamination  is\nminimal.  The  transmission  line  will  pass  through  some  built  up  areas  near  the  Savar  Highway  and\nclose to the proposed Aminbazar substation and in the vicinity of the Hasnabad substation.\n\n6.\nThe  land  in  Tongi,  Kalyanpur,  Aminbazar,  and  Hasnabad  substations  has  been  utilized  for\nindustrial  and  residential  purposes  for  a  long  time.  For  safety  purposes,  the  open  space  within  the\nsubstation  was  cleared  of  grasses  and  other  vegetation,  which  could  accidentally  flare  up.  The\nperimeter  clearance  was  cemented  to  facilitate  movement  of  maintenance  equipment  and  crew.\nNative  flora  and  fauna  have  long  been  dislocated  in  adjacent  industrial  and  residential  areas.  The\nexisting flora and fauna are typical of urban ecology consisting mostly of household pets, insects and\ndomesticated animals.\n\n7.\nThe ecology in the proposed Aminbazar  substation  is  aquatic.  It  is expected  that  only  plants\noccurring in seasonally flooded condition will be met in the project area. No forested vegetation was\nobserved in the project area. The aquatic flora and fauna have little or no commercial value nor are\nthey endangered or protected. The area is an artificial lagoon.\n\n8.\nThe flora and fauna in the transmission line right-of-way varies from those of urban ecology in\nbuilt up areas such as those around the substations.  Most of the area transversed by the right-of-way\nis  flooded  for  most  of  the  year.   When  the  land  is  not  flooded  it  is  cultivated  with  rice  and  aquatic\nvegetables. Within  the project area,  there  is  no natural  forest  vegetation.  The  terrestrial  flora  of  the\nproject consists mainly homestead plants. In addition, a large number of fruit and  horticultural  crops\nare  grown  in  the  homestead.  This  include  mango,  (Mangifera  indica)  jackfruit,  (Artocarpus\nheteroaphylla), coconut, Cocos nucifera Khoir (Treca catcha) bel (Aegel marmolos), etc. The area has\nbeen disturbed by  agricultural activities for a  long  time  and there are no endangered  and  protected\nspecies in the area.\n\n9.\nThe  filling  materials  will  be  dredged  from  the  Turag/Buriganga  River.  The  riverbed  in  the\nsections  around  Dhaka  has  been  polluted  from  untreated  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater\ndischarges.  The  benthic  communities  in  the  river  have  been  dislocated  for  a  long  time.  The  large\nerosion  rate  and  subsequent  dredging  operations  to  maintain  the  transportation  and  flood  control\nfunctions of the river has further disturbed the benthic communities.  There are about 260 species of\nfreshwater  fishes  recorded  for  the  whole  country.  Seasonal  variation  of  the  flooding  regime  has\nmarked variation on the ecology, biology, and behavior of the fish. The most common fish observed in\nthe  open  water  aquatic  habitat  are  rui,  cattla,  kalibush,  pabda,  pangas,  etc.  in  the  rivers;  and  koi,\nmagur, singh, sarputi, mola, tengra in the beels. Due to increasing pollution load and overexploitation\nthe  fisheries  resources  are  dwindling  very  fast.  In  the  closed  water  habitats  particularly  in  ponds,\nsome exotic fishes are reared including, silver carps, tilapia, panpsa, and Thai magur.\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigating Measures\n\n10.\nThe  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  expansion  of  the  substation  facilities  at  Tongi,\nKalyanpur, and Hasnabad are minor and reversible, as they mostly related to construction activities.\nThe  environmental  impacts  are  mostly  related  to  noise,  dust,  and  traffic  from  movement  of\nconstruction materials, heavy equipment, and construction workers.\n\nThe filling operation for Aminbazar substation will reduce the size of the lagoon by 20 acres.\n11.\nThe filling operation will increase the lagoon turbidity. The benthic communities in the 8-hectare area\nwill  be  destroyed.  This  is a  residual  impact  of  the  project.  Migratory  aquatic  life  will  migrate  and  be\ndisplaced from this area. However as mentioned in para. 9, the aquatic life and flora have little or no\n\n\fAppendix 9, page 3\n\ncommercial value nor are they endangered or protected species. The construction activities after the\nfilling operation are similar to those in the other substations.\n\n12.\nThe equipment  to  be  used  in the  substations  will  conform  to  existing  standards for  electrical\nequipment and  will  not  contain  polychlorinated  biphenyl for  cooling  agent  in  transformers.  Asbestos\nwill not be used as an insulating agent.\n\n13.\nNoise from the transformers is low frequency noise and is damped by the perimeter walls. In\nTongi, Kalyanpur, and Hasnabad,  the noise from the factories  surrounding the  substation  is  several\nmagnitudes higher than those generated by the  transformers.  The noise  level  measured from those\nareas varied from 62 to 77 decibels.\n\nThere are seven abandoned 230 kV towers right at the end of Tongi substation. These towers\n14.\ncannot be used as they are not designed for the type of conductor to be used for the Project. The line\nroute may, however, be used, and new towers may be installed near  the  locations  of  these  existing\nabandoned towers. Inconvenience and disturbance may be felt by the residents during construction of\nthe transmission lines. For the 50  km stretch of the  transmission  line, few permanent  structures  will\nhave  to  be  relocated.   The  houses  will  be  relocated  in  adjacent  areas outside  the  transmission  line\nright-of-way.  The  cultivators  will  be  allowed  to  cultivate  the  land  in  the  transmission  line of  right-of-\nway as currently practiced, i.e., the flooded sections are cultivated only during the dry season.\n\n15.\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the  service  area  is  primarily\npositive. At present Dhaka City is experiencing frequent load-shedding up to six hours per day.  The\nfrequent fluctuation in power voltage has resulted in rapid deterioration of household appliances and\nindustrial machinery. Efficiencies in industries and commercial establishments have been affected by\nload-shedding especially the small- and medium-scale industries that could not afford to buy their own\nelectric  generators.  Large  hotels  and  industries  buy  diesel-driven  electric  generators  often\nsecondhand  equipment.  The  secondhand  generators are often  polluting  with  low  electric-generating\nefficiencies.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring\n\nDuring  construction,  PGCB  will  appoint  an  environmental  and  safety  manager  who  will  be\n16.\nsupported by three qualified engineers. The environmental and safety engineer will report directly to\nthe  project  director.  The  environmental  and  safety  engineer  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the\ncompliance of the Project to all safety and environmental requirements of the government as well as\nthe mitigating measures identified in the IEE report.\n\n17.\nDuring the  operation and  maintenance  of  the  Project,  PGCB  will  appoint  a  suitably  qualified\nengineer  as  safety  and  environmental  officer  who  will  report  directly  to  the  managing  director.  The\nenvironmental  and  safety  engineer  will  be  responsible  for  checking  that  the  workplace  procedures\ncomply with the environmental and safety standards of the industry as required by the  Government.\nThe environmental and safety engineer will be also the focal person in the  event  that  the Executing\nAgency  applies  for  International  Standard  Organization  certification.  The  PGCB  will  submit  to  ADB\nannually  a  copy  of  all  licenses  and  permits  required  by  the  relevant  agency  of  the  Government  for\nenvironmental and safety regulations. In the event that the Project is cited for violation of any safety\nand environmental standards within the reporting period, PGCB will submit to ADB a certification that\nthe defect has been corrected or an acceptable plan has been submitted to the relevant government\nagency.\n\n\fAppendix 9, page 4\n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n18.\nThe project environmental  impact  is  minor  and temporary and  can  be  easily  mitigated  using\navailable technologies. The negative impacts of the Project are related to the  construction  activities.\nThe  main  residual  impacts  of  the  Project  are  related  to  the  filling  of  artificial  lagoon  in  Aminbazar\ncovering approximately 8  hectares and  resulting  in  the displacement  of  benthic ecology  in  this area\nand  dislocation  of  some  aquatic  flora  and  fauna.  However,  the  aquatic  flora  and  fauna  are  not\nendangered  or  protected  nor  do  they  have  commercial  value.  The  fill  materials  used  in  Aminbazar\nsubstation are left over from the dredging of the rivers and channels in Dhaka. The land in Aminbazar\nis basically a disposal area for the dredged materials.\n\nG.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe  IEE  reveals no  significant adverse  impact  on  the  environment  that  cannot  be  mitigated.\n\n19.\nThe preparation of a detailed environmental impact assessment is not deemed necessary.\n\n\fAppendix 10, page 1\n\nSUMMARY LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT PLAN\n\nA.\n\nBackground\n\nThe proposed Dhaka Power System Upgrade Project involves construction of substations,\n1.\nand transmission and distribution facilities in the Greater Dhaka Area.  Almost all land acquisition\nand right of way activities will occur under Part A and affect a total of 2,000 square meters (m2) for\nKalyanpur substation, 20 acres of land for the Aminbazar substation, and 60  kilometers  (km)  of\nright-of-way  for  the  transmission  facilities.  Part  B  and  Part  C  will  not  require  acquisition  of  land\nexcept about 0.4 hectare of land for a new 132 kilovolt (kV) substation at Kamrangichar in Dhaka.\nThe land proposed to be acquired for Aminbazar substation is private land that floods each year\nduring  the  monsoon  and  therefore  does  not  support  any  permanent  residents  or  activities.  It  is\nlargely used as a source of \"borrow\" earth to fill other sites. However, it is possible that in the dry\nseason  some  of  this  land  may  be  used  for  temporary  shelters  or  marginal  farming.  The  main\nimpact of the project would occur during the stringing of the transmission lines. Possible impacts\ncould include damage to crops and displacement of persons although this would be only by about\nten  meters  in  each  case.  It  was  assessed  that  these  impacts  are  not  significant  and  can  be\nmitigated  by  (i)  minimizing  such  impact  through  careful  routing  of  the  transmission  line,  and  (ii)\nthrough  paying  adequate  compensation.  The  only  potentially  significant  impact  is  that  of\nresettlement, which affects a maximum of about 100 persons, mostly migrant slum dwellers and\nsemipermanent residents. This number can be reduced significantly through a proper delineation\nof the transmission lines. Compensation will be paid to all those affected.\n\nB.\n\nGood Practice\n\n1.\n\nImpact Minimization\n\n2.\n\nTo minimize impact, the following guidelines for tower spotting will be observed:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv) \n\n(v)\n\nThe  alignment  will  avoid,  without  exception,  religious  structures,  and  educational\ninstitutions.\n\nAs  far  as  may  be  practicable,  the  alignment  will  avoid  houses  (permanent  or\ntemporary).  In  particular,  special  care  will  be  taken  to  avoid  human  settlement\nclusters. Where unavoidable, the ground clearance will be increased to at least 10\nmeters so that no resettlement is necessitated.\n\nWhere  road  and  river  crossing  is  unavoidable,  prescribed  vertical  and  horizontal\nclearance requirements will be strictly adhered to.\n\nThe proposed alignment will be submitted on  a no-objection basis to (at least) the\nfollowing  Archaelogocial  Survey,  Wildlife  Conservation  Agency,  Inland  Water\nTransport Authority, and Highway Department. These authorities will have 30 days\nto formally object to the project.\n\nCompensation  in  terms  of  country  and  ADB  norms  will  be  paid  to  owners  of  all\nproperty, including crops, orchard trees, homesteads, water sources, etc., following\nprescribed procedures.\n\n2.\n\nResettlement Principles\n\nBased on ADB Policy for Involuntary Resettlement, the following principles were  identified\n\n3.\nas being applicable for this activity for the Project:\n\n\fAppendix 10, page 2\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\nThe  principal  objective  of  involuntary  settlement  policies  is  to  ensure  that\npopulations affected by the Project should be at  least as well off, if not better off\nthan  they  would  have  been  without  the  Project.  Affected  populations  should  be\nable to maintain, and preferably improve their standard of living and quality of life.\n\nThe populations affected by the Project are defined as those who stand to lose, as\na  consequence  of  the  Project,  all  or  part  of  physical  and  nonphysical  assets,\nincluding  homes,  homesteads,  productive  lands,  commercial  properties,  tenancy,\nincome-earning  opportunities,  social  and  cultural  activities  and  relationships,  and\nother  losses  that  may  be  identified  during  the  process  of  resettlement  planning.\nA preliminary socioeconomic survey was  carried  out  as  part  of  the  routing  of  the\ntransmission  line  and  the  findings  were  filed  with  the  deputy  office.  These  will\nrepresent the cutoff date for  compensation  eligibility  for  physical  assets  as  these\nwere  identified.  Affected populations  will  receive  fair  (market-based  replacement\ncost)  compensation  for  all  losses,  including  physical  and  nonphysical  assets.\nCompensation  will  include  not  only  immediate  losses,  but  also  opportunities\nforegone. Affected populations who stand to lose only part of their physical assets\nwill  not  be  left  with  a  proportion  inadequate  to  sustain  their  current  standard  of\nliving,  such  a  minimum  was  identified  and  agreed  to  during  the  resettlement\nplanning process.\n\nAll  affected  populations  will  be  equally  eligible  for  compensation  and  mitigative\nmeasures,  irrespective  of  tenurial  status,  social  or  economic  standing,  and  any\nsuch factors that may discriminate against achieving the objectives outlined.\n\nInvoluntary resettlement will be minimized by identifying possible alternative project\ndesigns; and appropriate social, economic, operational, and engineering solutions\nthat have the  least  impact on populations  in  the project area. As  it  is  possible  to\nidentify the affected population only during the actual stringing of the transmission\nlines, a  short  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  for  the  affected  populations  and\nspecifying  those  affected,  all  losses  that  might  be  incurred,  and  appropriate\nmitigative measures.\n\nAdequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  be  made  available\nto cover  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  within  the  agreed  implementation  period.\nThe project  performa  prepared  by  Power  Grid  Company  of  Bangladesh\nLtd. For the Hasnabad-Aminbazar  (Savar)-Tongi  and  the  Haripur-Meghnaghat\n230kV transmission line contains two cost items for this purpose.  An allocation of\nTk3.88  million for  right-of-way payments and of Tk129  million  for  land  acquisition\nfor substations is included on page 15, item 1 (c) of the project performa budget.\n\nConstruction activities will not commence until the required  lands have been fully\nacquired and populations appropriately relocated in accordance with the principles\nset out.\n\nAppropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be  identified\nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system.  Evaluation of the\nresettlement process and the final outcome  will be  conducted  independent of the\nExecuting Agency.\n\nThe  current  legislation governing  land acquisition for  public purposes  in  Bangladesh  is\n4.\nthe Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance (Ordinance II of 1982) and its\nsubsequent  amendments  in  1993  and  1994.  In  accordance  with  the  ordinance,  the  legal\nprocess  is  initiated  by  an  application  by  the  requiring  agency  or  department  to  the  deputy\n\n\fAppendix 10, page 3\n\ncommissioner  of  the  district.  In  determining  the  amount  of  compensation  for  the  affected\nowners,  the  deputy  commissioner  takes  into  consideration  a  number  of  factors,  e.g.,  present\nmarket rate to determine the value of the land. As there is no national policy for resettlement of\nproject-affected people  in  Bangladesh,  ADB  Policy  on Involuntary  Resettlement  will  guide  the\nresettlement plan.\n\nC.\n\nProject Compensation Policy and Entitlement Matrix\n\n5.\nThe  project  compensation  policy  and  entitlement  matrix  was  designed  to  cover\ncompensation  for  lost  assets  and  restore  or  enhance  the  livelihoods  of  all  categories  (direct,\nindirect, title holders, and nontitle-holders) of affected people. The affected persons will not only\nreceive  replacement  land  or  cash  for  land  and  other  assets  at  market  price,  many  additional\nmeasures will be taken, e.g. moving allowance, assistance to household headed by women, to\nhelp the project-affected persons to regain or improve their lives in the postresettlement period.\nTable  A10.1  explains  the  various  compensation  and  entitlement  policies  applicable  under  the\nProject.\n\nType of Losses                                        Policy\n1\n\nLoss of land due to\nacquisition\n\n\u2022  All kinds of land (including homestead and commercial\n\nplots) acquired will be compensated in kind (i.e.,\nreplacement land) or cash (i.e., average sales value plus\n50 percent due to compulsory acquisition) by district\ncommissioner\u2019s office\n\n\u2022  Additional cash grant based on market value of the land\n\u2022  Cash compensation for trees based on age and value of\n\nfruit over its lifetime.\n\n\u2022  Standing crops are valued at market prices\n\u2022  Cash compensation under law by DC for loss of structure\n\n\u2022  One-time cash grant for alternative shelters at replacement\n\nvalue\n\n\u2022  Shifting or moving allowance to affected households\n\u2022  Additional assistance for households headed by women to\n\nhire help for relocation\n\n\u2022  One-time cash grant for loss of income/work opportunities\n\u2022  Additional assistance to vulnerable groups such as women\nand landless workers for alternative income-generating\nprogram\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n\nLoss of standing crops,\ntrees and perennials\n\nLoss of living quarters\n(leased/rented)/temporary\nCommercial or other\nstructures on the ROW\nShifting or moving\nAllowance\n\nLoss of employment/work\nIncome (daily wage\nlaborers, CBE employees,\nand others indirectly\naffected) due to\ndislocation and disruption\n\nDC - District Collector\nROW - Right of Way\n\n\f72\n\nCONSUMER CONNECTION SUMMARY\n\nAppendix 11\n\nExisting (1999)\n\nTotal (1999-2003)\n\nProject Only\n\nNumber\nof\nConsumers\n\n% of\nTotal\n\nNumber\nof\nConsumers\n\n% of\nTotal\n\nNumber\nof\nConsumers\n(Incremental)\n\n% of\nTotal\n\nNo.\n\n1.\n\nDESA\n\nDomestic \nCommercial \nIrrigation\nIndustry\nOthers\n\n367,023\n56,394\n1,376\n15,462\n2,766\n\n82.9 47,257,808\n7,239,737\n12.7\n171,017\n0.3\n1,995,203\n3.5\n342,035\n0.6\n\n82.9\n12.7\n0.3\n3.5\n0.6\n\n5,341,827\n818,350\n19,331\n225,530\n38,662\n\nTotal\n\n443,021\n\n100\n\n570,058\n\n100\n\n64,437\n\n2.\n\nDESCO/Gulshan\n\nDomestic \nCommercial \nIrrigation\nIndustry\nOthers\n\n53,754\n4,506\n28\n1,163\n210\n\n90.1\n7.6\n0.0\n1.9\n0.4\n\n6,794,171\n573,093\n0\n143,273\n30,163\n\n90.1\n7.6\n0.0\n1.9\n0.4\n\n1,416,012\n119,442\n0\n29,860\n6,286\n\nTotal\n\n59,661\n\n100\n\n75,407\n\n100\n\n15,716\n\n100\n\n3.\n\nPBS\n\nDomestic \nCommercial \nIrrigation\nIndustry\nOthers\n\n287,545\n43,408\n7,639\n10,657\n749\n\n82.2\n12.4\n2.2\n3.0\n0.2\n\n349,516\n52,763\n9,285\n12,952\n909\n\n82.2\n12.4\n2.2\n3.0\n0.2\n\n61,971\n9,355\n1,646\n2,295\n160\n\nTotal\n\n349,998\n\n100\n\n425,425\n\n100\n\n75,427\n\n100\n\n82.9\n12.7\n0.3\n3.5\n0.6\n\n100\n\n90.1\n7.6\n0.0\n1.9\n0.4\n\n82.2\n12.4\n2.2\n3.0\n0.2\n\n\fAppendix 12, page 1\n\nPROJECT FINANCIAL ANALYSIS\n\nA. \n\nGeneral\n\nThe  financial  evaluation  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  real  terms.

Given  the  overall  objectives  of  the\nProject, the financial performance is deemed acceptable.\n\n\fAppendix 13, page 1\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n\n1.\nAn economic evaluation for the entire Project consisting of transmission and distribution\ninvestments  was  undertaken,  and  the  results  are  summarized  here.  Details  of  the  economic\ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  calculations  are  shown  in  Table  A13.3,  results  of  the  switching\nvalue analysis are in Table A13.1, and the findings of the sensitivity analysis are given in Table\nA13.2.\n\n2.\nAs the Project is specifically targeting the greater Dhaka area, there are only three major\nconsumer  segments,  domestic,  commercial,  and  industrial,  for  which  economic  benefits  were\ncalculated.  For each of the 13 distribution circles included in the Project the incremental power\nsupply was calculated and the breakdown for each consumer segment was analyzed. Economic\nbenefits were then calculated separately for each distribution circle and consumer segment.\n\n3.\nThe shares of electricity supply assumed to replace an alternative energy source in each\nconsumer category  were  based  on existing  load-shedding data  in each distribution  circle.  It  is\nassumed that over a period of four years load-shedding will be eliminated in all circles covered\nunder the Project. New consumers will also be connected to the grid in each distribution circle\nover a four-year period. Their consumption in the first year after being connected to the grid is\nconsidered  to  replace other fuels and  to  result  in economic  resource  cost  saving.  That  is,  the\neconomic cost of alternative energy, which the country saves by using electricity, is considered\nan economic benefit of the Project.\n\nThe  shares of  incremental electricity  supply  corresponding  to  induced  consumption  for\n4.\nnewly connected consumers are assumed to grow rapidly for four years before normalizing. The\nassumed annual growth rates are 10, 15,13, and 10 percent before settling to normal growth at\n5  percent  per  annum.  Induced  consumption  was  valued  by  estimating  the  consumer\u2019s\nwillingness to pay for this part of incremental electricity supply. Given the sensitivity of demand\nto  price  for  the  various  categories  of  consumers,  only  a  portion  of  the  maximum  consumer\u2019s\nsurplus benefits  is assumed for the valuation of induced sales.\n\nAlternative  sources  of  power  used  by  the  three  major  consumer  segments  were\n5.\ndetermined, and their respective costs were estimated. It was found that the dominant sources\nof alternative power in the domestic sector are kerosene lamps and inverter batteries.  Private\nownership  of  small-sized  diesel  generators  is  very  low  and  prevailing  only  among  very  high-\nincome  urban  consumers,  and  can  thus  not  be  considered  for  the  purpose  of  estimating  the\nwillingness-to-pay. A  large proportion of total end-consumption  in the  domestic  sector  is  used\nfor lighting purposes and to run small appliances like televisions, fans and radios. During power\ncuts, substitution  of electricity  is almost  exclusively for  lighting purposes.  Therefore, economic\nbenefits for the replacement portion of alternative energy sources were valued at an economic\ncost  of  kerosene  lamps  at  Tk5.2  per  kilowatt  hour  (kWh).  Induced  consumption  was  valued\nusing the willingness-to-pay method plus the related consumer surplus with a curvature factor of\n0.3.  However,  the  calculation  was  based  on  the  use  of  inverter  batteries  as  the  alternative\nenergy source as induced consumption is more  likely used for  small appliances.  The financial\ncost of using inverter batteries was estimated at Tk3.6 per kWh.\n\nCommercial sector use of alternative sources is represented by a  mixture  of  small and\n6.\nlamps.  To\nmedium-size  generators  and \naccommodate the difference in use, two sizes of generators are included in the calculation. The\nconsumption  share  of  the  commercial  sector  was  divided  equally  between  2  and  5  kW\n\nfor  very  small  establishments  of  kerosene \n\n\fAppendix 13, page 2\n\ngenerators for the calculation of benefits. Average economic cost of alternative energy sources\nfor  commercial  establishments  has  been  estimated  at  Tk8.81  for  a  2  kW  generator  and  at\nTk5.28 for a 5 kW generator. A curvature factor of 0.4 was used in the calculations.\n\n7.\nAs  a  result  of  the  persistent  power  shortages  in  Bangladesh  the  industry  sector  has\ninstalled  a  large  number  of  alternative  sources  of  energy.  Officially,  400  megawatts  (MW)  of\nprivate generation capacity exist in the country, which corresponds to about a fifth of the public\npower plants currently operating.1 Captive power facilities cover a wide range of unit sizes and\nplant  types  with  the  most  dominant  being  large  diesel  generator  sets.  The  average  cost\ndepends on the size of the generator and was estimated to lie between Tk5.25  per  kWh for a\n240 kW generator and Tk5.5 per kWh for a 500kW generator.  As for the commercial segment,\na curvature factor of 0.4 was used.\n\n8.\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  economic  analysis,  the  estimated  capital  costs  of  the\ntransmission and distribution components have been broken down into direct foreign exchange\nitems, indirect foreign  exchange,  and  local goods  and  services.  All  costs  elements are  valued\nin border  prices,  using  a  domestic  currency  numeraire,  with  all  taxes  and  duties  excluded.\nA standard  conversion  factor  of  0.855  is  applied  to  nontraded  items  and  a  labor  conversion\nfactor  of  0.9  is  used.  Operating  costs  were  calculated  as  a  fixed  percentage  of  economic\ninvestment  cost.  For  the  transmission  component  this  percentage  is  kept  constant  over  the\nevaluation  period,  while  for  the  distribution  component  it  is  assumed  that  after  five  years  of\noperation the percentage is increased to reflect higher maintenance needs.\n\nThe  economic  benefits  of  transmission  and  distribution  facilities  required  to  evacuate\n9.\npower  from  new  generation  projects,  such  as  Haripur  IPP,  are  difficult  to  determine\nindependently.  Transmission  and  distribution  are  integral  parts  of  the  total  power  system\ndevelopment  plan  and  not  independent  investments.  The  EIRR  on  the  complete  investment\nrequired in new generation projects plus associated transmission and distribution are normally\nconsidered as representative of the rate of return on transmission and distribution investments,\nas they are typically only a part of the total investment.\n\nTherefore,  the  economic  evaluations  of  transmission  and  distribution  components\n10.\ninclude  economic  sent-out  costs  of  power.  The  Project  specifically  targets  constructing\ntransmission  and  distribution  facilities  needed  to  evacuate  power  from  the  newly  solicited\nindependent  power  producers  for  about  1,400  MW  of  generating  capacity.  A  number  of  IPP\nagreements  have  been  concluded  among  them  are  independent  power  producers  for  about\n400 MW  from  barge-mounted  plants  of  which  100  MW  is  already  being  produced.  Another\n890 MW, including the Meghnaghat and Haripur plants  have almost  reached financial  closure.\nLatest calculations of the long-run marginal cost (LRMC), which took into account the IPPs sent-\nout costs, show that the current LRMC in Bangladesh is about 30 per cent below its 1994 level.\nThis can mainly be attributed to lower unit investment costs and the higher fuel efficiency of new\ngas  plants.  Also,  the  economic  cost  of  gas  declined  based  on  the  actual  costs  incurred  in\ndeveloping new gas fields. Consequently, the bid prices for  sent-out energy  received from  the\nfirst  IPPs  were  unexpectedly  low,  although  higher  than  actual  gas  prices  have  already  been\nassumed  in  the  IPPs.  However,  to  be  more  conservative,  the  economic  evaluation  used  the\nweighted average of IPP sent-out cost instead of the recalculated LRMC.\n\n                                               \n1 According to the World Bank  1998, Energy Strategy Note.\n\n\fAppendix 13, page 3\n\nOn  the  basis  of  a  comparison  of  economic  costs  and  benefits  over  a  20-year  project\n11.\nlifetime, including a four-year construction period, the economic  internal  rate  of  returns  (EIRR)\nwas estimated at 22.7 percent with a net present value (NPV) of TK3,330 million.\n\nTable A13.1: Switching Value Analysis\n\nChange is applied to total project benefits and not segregated by consumer segment and executing agency.\n\nChange (%)\n+54\n(8)\n+29\n\nCapital Cost\n\na\n\nBenefits \nEnergy Cost\n\nItem\n\nBase Case\n\na\n\na\n\nTable A13.2: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nEIRR %\n\nSI\n\n22.7\n\nCapital Costs\n\n+10%\n\n19.99\n\nBenefits \n\na\n\n-10%\n\n15.65\n\nEnergy Cost\n\n+10%\n\n19.1\n\nOne-year delay\nTwo-year delay\n\n21.59\n19.57\n\n1.19\n\n3.10\n\n1.58\n\nEIRR = Economic Internal Rate of Return;  SI = Sensitivity Indicator\n\n.\n\nChange is applied to total project benefits and not segregated by consumer segment and executing agency.\n\n\fTABLE A13.4:  ECONOMIC INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN\nBAN: PROPOSED DHAKA POWER SYSTEM UPGRADE PROJECT\n\n(Tk Million)\n\nCapital Cost\n\nYear\n\nDistribution\n\nOperating Cost\nDistribution\n\nGeneration Total\nImport Cost\n\nBenefits\n\nTotal \n\nNet\n\nBenefits Benefits\n\nTrans-\nmission PBS Gulshan DESA mission PBS DESCO DESA\n\nTrans-\n\nPBS Gulshan DESA\n\n14\n217\n586\n270\n\n        \n        \n     \n        \n\n256\n516\n1,279\n915\n\n179\n638\n393\n\n273\n1999\n     \n838\n2000\n     \n     \n2001\n796\n2002 1,131\n  \n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n\n5\n22\n38\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n\n0\n8\n29\n38\n38\n38\n38\n38\n38\n54\n54\n54\n54\n54\n54\n54\n54\n54\n54\n\n0\n6\n29\n42\n42\n42\n42\n42\n42\n60\n60\n60\n60\n60\n60\n60\n60\n60\n60\n\n9\n27\n72\n104\n104\n104\n104\n104\n104\n148\n148\n148\n148\n148\n148\n148\n148\n148\n148\n\n543\n548 2,312\n904 4,266\n1,442 4,319\n1,983 2,228\n2,019 2,264\n2,036 2,281\n2,105 2,350\n2,171 2,416\n2,234 2,479\n2,297 2,620\n2,297 2,620\n2,297 2,620\n2,297 2,620\n2,297 2,620\n2,297 2,620\n2,297 2,620\n2,297 2,620\n2,297 2,620\n2,297 2,620\n\n124\n239\n331\n425\n486\n491\n496\n501\n507\n513\n513\n513\n513\n513\n513\n513\n513\n513\n513\n\n183\n346\n531\n725\n752\n779\n800\n812\n817\n817\n817\n817\n817\n817\n817\n817\n817\n817\n817\n\n847\n1,393\n1,997\n2,623\n2,694\n2,767\n2,823\n2,857\n2,869\n2,874\n2,874\n2,874\n2,874\n2,874\n2,874\n2,874\n2,874\n2,874\n2,874\n\n       \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n\n(543)\n(1,158)\n(2,288)\n(1,460)\n1,545\n1,668\n1,756\n1,769\n1,755\n1,714\n1,583\n1,583\n1,583\n1,583\n1,583\n1,583\n1,583\n1,583\n1,583\n1,583\n\n1,154\n1,978\n2,859\n3,773\n3,932\n4,037\n4,119\n4,171\n4,193\n4,203\n4,203\n4,203\n4,203\n4,203\n4,203\n4,203\n4,203\n4,203\n4,203\n\nEconomic Rate of Return:\nNet Present Value: Tk million\n\n22.7%\n  \n3,330.5\n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n4\n\n\fOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR  THE SOCIAL SURVEY\n\nAppendix 14, page 1\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nB. \n\nScope of Work\n\n1.\nAssessment of the socioeconomic impact of electrification is essential to gauge whether\noverarching poverty reduction goals of electrification are being met. Thus, in the context of the\nBank's  Dhaka  Power  System  Upgrade  Project,  the  Bank  is  attempting  to  quantitatively  and\nqualitatively  assess  the  socioeconomic  benefits  of  electrification,  and  improved  electricity\nsupply, in the Greater Dhaka Area with a special emphasis on the urban poor.\n\n2.\nThe  consultants  will  determine  through  surveys,  interviews,  and  scrutiny  of  existing\nrecords,  the  (i)  actual  energy  expenditures  in  electrified  and  nonelectrified  households  for\ncomparable  energy  outputs;  (ii)  impact  of  electrification  on  productive  activities;  (iii)  impact  of\nelectrification  on  household  income  and  household  expenditures,  education,  and  social\nactivities; (iv) impact of  electrification  on  public service  institutions to  include hospitals,  clinics,\nschools, and  related  delivery  agencies;  and  (v)  impact  of  electrification  on  small  and  medium\nenterprises (SME).\n\n3.\n\nTasks to be carried out by the consultants will include but not be limited to:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nselecting sample households reflecting different income levels, income sources,\nelectrified and nonelectrified households, and households with cottage industries\nand without;\nselecting sample public service institutions and SMEs;\ndesigning the questionnaires;\nconducting interviews;\ncross-checking results with area officials, community leaders, and retailers (for\ncost indications);\nanalyzing and evaluating the collected data; and\npreparing the final report\n\nC. \n\nOutline Terms of Reference\n\nThree  different  consumer  categories  are  included  under  the  study:  households,  public\n4.\nservice institutions, and SMEs. For each of the categories, the specific link to electrification will\nbe established and WTP/ATP will be determined, as follows:\n\na.\n\nDomestic Consumers:\n\n5.\n\nThe study will establish a link to household income by answering the following questions;\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nHow  does  electrification  relate  to  household  income  and  expenditure  in\ncomparison with nonelectrified households?\nWhat is the pattern of wages, agricultural, and cottage industry income, and how\ndoes it relate to energy consumption?\nIs there a link between electrification and higher profit (higher income)?\nHow does electrification relate to education, medical services, information, etc.?\n\n\fAppendix 14, page 2\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nc.\n\n6.\n\nThe study will gather day-to-day energy related information, e.g.:\n\nIdentify which energy sources are used and how many times per day; if possible\nattention should  be  paid  to  gender  differentiation  in  energy  use,  in  particular  in\ncottage industries.\nDetermine length of use per source and the cost per use per source.\nEstablish  the  activities  avoided  due  to  lack  of  energy  that  could  be  a  result  of\nload-shedding; insufficient cash to pay for fuel for nonelectricity energy sources;\nor of insufficient lumen produced by sources.\n\n7.\n\nData should be collected to determine, e.g.\n\nthe cost of existing energy sources per activity like cooking, lighting, and heating\nand to run appliances;\nhousehold  expenditure  on  water,  television,  sewage  disposal,  municipal  taxes,\ntransportation;\nthe most preferred energy sources per activity and indicate the reason;\nwillingness  and  ability-to-pay  for  electrification;  this  could  be  established  by\ninquiring  if  households  could  afford  cost  of  wiring  and  how  they  would  finance\nthis;\nperception of monetary losses due to  inadequate  energy  supply and  to  link  this\nperception to willingness-to-pay.\n\nb.\n\nPublic Service Institutions\n\nThe  study  will  assess  the  adequacy  of  electricity/alternate  energy  sources,  and  their\n\n8.\ncontribution to an efficient delivery of public services, e.g.:\n\n(i) \n\nIs  there  general  satisfaction  with  service  delivery,  if  not,  what  are  the  required\nimprovements?\nWho pays for the cost of electricity/alternate energy source?\n\n(ii) \n(iii)  What are the future energy/electricity requirements, and can the institution afford\n\nthe cost;\nIf additional energy is required, how will it contribute to increased service delivery\nand client benefit?\n\n9.\n\nOn the basis of the data establish:\n\naffordability and willingness to pay; and\nrecommendations, as relevant, for how increased costs will be met.\n\nMicro and Small Enterprises\n\nThe  study  will  establish  a  link  between  provision  of  reliable  electricity  services  and\n\n10.\nexpansion of SME business turnover and employment, e.g.:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nDescribe the production activities  and  employment  capacity of  the  SMEs  in  the\ncontext of their contribution to the economy.\nIdentify how current energy requirements and energy costs are met;\nDetermine if the availability of energy is linked to production and profit.\n\n\fAppendix 14, page 3\n\n(iv) \n\nOutline the future requirements for energy and how will this contribute to greater\nefficiency and expansion of the sector, including additional employment.\n\nOn  the  basis of  the  data  established,  a  link  will  be  established  on  the  willingness  and\n\n11.\nability to pay for electrification (new or additional).\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 4 November 1999)\n", "Currency Unit\nTk1.00\n$1.00\n", "-\n-\n-\n", "Taka (Tk)\n$0.0203\nTk49.35\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "BOO\nBPDB\nDESA\nDESCO\nDFID\nEA\nEIRR\nFIRR\nIPP\nJBIC\nKfW\nLRMC\nOECF\nPBS\nPGCB\nPSRB\nRMG\nREB\nTA\nUSAID\n", "Build-Own-Operate\nBangladesh Power Development Board\nDhaka Electric Supply Authority\nDhaka Electric Supply Company Ltd.\nDepartment For International Development of U.K.\nexecuting agency\neconomic internal rate of return\nfinancial internal rate of return\nindependent power producer\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation\nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau of Germany\nlong-run marginal cost\nOverseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan\nPalli Bidyut Samity (Rural Electric Cooperative)\nPower Grid Company of Bangladesh Ltd.\nPower Sector Reforms in Bangladesh\nready made garments\nRural Electrification Board\ntechnical assistance\nUnited States Agency for International Development\n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES\n", "V\n(volt)\nKV\n(kilovolt)\nW\n(watt)\nKW\n(kilowatt)\nMW\n(megawatt)\nWh\n(watt-hour)\nKWh\n(kilowatt-hour)\nMWh\n(megawatt-hour)\n(gigawatt-hour)\nGWh\nCct-km circuit kilometer\n", "-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n", "NOTES\n", "unit of voltage\n1,000 volts\nunit of active power\n1,000 W\n1,000,000 W\nunit of energy\n1,000 Wh\n1,000,000 Wh\n1,000,000,000 Wh\n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year of  the Government  ends on 30 June.
