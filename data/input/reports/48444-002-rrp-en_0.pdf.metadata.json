Aside from abundant and \nunderemployed labor resources, the region is endowed with agricultural and mineral resources which serve as an engine of \ngrowth for the national economy. Characterized by relative high levels of the national agricultural production of fresh produce \nand cash crops, mainly coffee, tea, and cocoa, the region contributes a third of gross domestic product; while the region's \nmineral and petroleum resources account for nearly 80% of national exports. The 1,200 km long 2-lane national Highlands \nHighway is the lifeline for the Highlands region connecting 1,800 km of regional and feeder roads and servicing the region's \npeople particularly those in the rural hinterland. The highway traverses the Highlands region connecting it to the coastal \nprovinces and the country's main port in Lae.\nImpact: Attainment of well-integrated, safe, affordable, and financially and environmentally sustainable transport systems that \nefficiently serve the economy and people of PNG (National Transport Strategy, 2014-2030)\n\nImproved access to health and education, and living standards of the people of PNG (National Strategy for Responsible \nSustainable Development for Papua New Guinea)\n\nIncreased opportunity for equality and prosperity in rural areas (Development Strategic Plan, 2010-2030) \nOutcome: Increased efficiency and safe movement of people, goods, and services between the Highlands Region and markets \nOutputs: (i)The 430 kilometer of two-lane rural Highlands Highway from Lae Nadzab airport to Kagamuga airport in Mt Hagen, \nis rehabilitated, upgraded, and effectively maintained, (ii)Road safety on the national Highlands Highway increased, \n(iii)Transport logistics and services in the Highlands Region improved,  and (iv)Institutional capacity of the DOW to deliver the \ninvestment program and sustain its benefits strengthened\n\nImplementation Arrangements: Department of Works will be the executing agency.\n\n \n\nProject Readiness: This proposed investment program has the potential to diversify the nation's economy and have a \ntransformational impact on PNG. The Highlands Highway is a top priority national road of the government's Development \nStrategic Plan (2010-2030), and similarly it was also identified as a priority investment in the National Transport Strategy \n2014-2030 (NTS), the government's roadmap for development in the transport sector which proposes a safe, integrated \ntransport network that ensures domestic and international connectivity by moving people and goods reliably at low cost. The \ninvestment program is aligned with ADB's Country Partnership Strategy, 2016-2020 and the Country Operations Business Plan \n2017-2019 for PNG, which aims at reducing transport and logistical costs to support sustainable development and inclusive \ngrowth. In addition to being aligned with the government's strategies and priorities, the proposed investment program is highly \ncomplementary to ongoing efforts of ADB and other development partners in the sector. Currently, ADB's ongoing MFF for \nHighlands Region Road Improvement Investment Program (HRRIIP) is rehabilitating regional roads connected to the Highlands \nHighway. Road maintenance is supported by Government of Australia and the World Bank, specifically in the coastal areas. For \na coordinated and well-guided approach for the Highlands Highway among government agencies and development partners, a \nhigh level Program Steering Committee, including a core working group (CWG), was established in 2015.\n\n11.

The  program  will  (i)  rehabilitate,  upgrade,  and  sustainably \nmaintain 430 kilometers (km) of the Highlands Highway; (ii) improve road safety; (iii) support the \nestablishment  of  logistics  platforms  and  services  for  agricultural  production;  and  (iv)  improve \nsector governance through reforms and institutional development. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  Highlands  Region  consists  of  seven  landlocked  provinces  that  are  home  to  about \n40% of the country\u2019s population, most of whom are involved in rural smallholder agriculture. With \nrelatively  high  production  levels  of  fresh  produce  and  cash  crops\u2014mainly  coffee,  tea,  and \ncocoa\u2014the region contributes one-third of PNG\u2019s gross domestic product, which was estimated \nat  approximately  $17  billion  for  2014.  Additionally,  the  region  has  rich  mineral  and  petroleum \nresources, which account for nearly 80% of PNG\u2019s national exports. Better transport infrastructure \nresulting from the investment program is expected to improve access to markets and services, \nand unlock the Highlands Region\u2019s vast economic development potential. \n \n4. \nThe 1,200-km-long, two-lane national Highlands Highway is the lifeline for the Highlands \nRegion, connecting 1,800 km of regional and feeder roads and servicing the regions estimated 3 \nmillion people in the rural hinterland. It connects landlocked mountainous provinces to the coastal \nprovince of Morobe and the Lae maritime port. Lae port is PNG\u2019s largest, busiest, and single most \nimportant sea port, serving as the nation\u2019s international gateway and a regional transshipment \nhub for the eastern reaches of the South Pacific.  \n \n5. \nDespite its importance to the region and the country, the Highlands Highway is in worse \ncondition  than  the  overall  national  sealed  road  network.  Nearly  all  sections  of  the  Highlands \nHighway are in poor condition, primarily because the government lacks the capacity to plan and \nexecute  maintenance  works.  Although  about  70%  of  the  alignment  is  in  fair  maintainable \ncondition, most of these road sections demand immediate and significant repairs.2 Vast stretches \nof the road require emergency works, significant rehabilitation, upgrades, and periodic and routine \nmaintenance. \n \n6. \nBecause of the mountainous terrain and inadequate engineering design for PNG\u2019s climatic \nconditions,  washouts  and  landslides  are  common  during  the  rainy  season  and  make  the \nHighlands Highway impassable at times. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency \nof  extreme  rain  events.  Road  safety  is  poor,  and  the  safety  rating  for  vehicle  occupants  and \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fpedestrians  is  2-star  and  below.3 In  its  current  state,  the  road  conditions  pose  serious  safety \nhazards  to  users  and  pedestrians,  with  levels  of  fatalities  and  injuries  far  exceeding  those  in \ndeveloped countries in Asia and the Pacific.4 \n \nThe poor condition of the Highlands Highway and the resulting inadequacy of transport \n7. \nservices  have  made  the  region\u2019s  agricultural  products  costly,  limiting  their  competitiveness  in \ndomestic and international markets. The absence of agricultural logistics facilities further restricts \nthe development of value chains for perishable and high-value products. Thus, given most rural \nhouseholds  engage  in  agricultural  livelihood  activities,  the  poor  condition  of  the  Highlands \nHighway is a major constraint on the region\u2019s inclusive growth and sustainable development. \n \n8. \nStrategic context, policy framework, and sector road map. This investment program \nis expected to have a transformational impact on PNG. Ensuring safe and efficient transport along \nthe Highlands Highway is a top government priority under PNG\u2019s Development Strategic Plan, \n2010\u20132030 and the National Transport Strategy, 2014\u20132030 (NTS). 5 The strategic emphasis is \non developing a safe and integrated transport network that ensures domestic and international \nconnectivity, and moving people and goods reliably at low cost. Additionally, the government\u2019s \npolicy framework as stipulated in the medium-term development plan (MTDP) for 2016\u20132017 also \ncalls for (i) increasing the proportion of roads that are in good condition, (ii) preserving investments \nin road infrastructure through road maintenance, (iii) encouraging a quality-based focus on new \nroad  construction  through  integrated  construction  and  maintenance  contracting  arrangements, \nand (iv) improving road safety infrastructure.6 \n \n9. \nPNG\u2019s long-term road investment plan up to 2030 requires more than $17 billion for capital \ninvestment and maintenance, as per the NTS and associated MTDPs with an estimated financing \ngap of $10 billion indicating a significant demand for external financial assistance. Through both \nthe  planned  physical  interventions  and  sector  reforms,  the  investment  program  will  assist  in \nreducing the funding gap in PNG\u2019s road investment plan. Table 1 summarizes the estimated cost \nof PNG\u2019s long-term investment plan for road network development and maintenance. \n \n\nTable 1: Long-Term Investment Plan, 2016\u20132030 \n($ billion) \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal  \n\nAmount \n\nItem \nRoad network development \nRoad network maintenance \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on the NTS. \n \n10. \nThe Development Strategic Plan, NTS, and MTDP identify the Highlands Highway as the \ntop priority economic corridor because it is the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure backbone that links \nto many other economic corridors. The region\u2019s economic corridors, consisting of interprovincial \n                                                 \n3  Road  Assessment  Services  Limited.  2015.

The combined economic impact \nof this integrated development is expected to be greater than its parts. The MTDP also places \nsignificant importance on maintenance and rehabilitation. A maintenance sustainability analysis \nfocused on national roads has identified the existing gaps in planning, financing, and institutional \nresponsibilities.7 The  investment  program  responds  to  these  gaps  through  a  long-term  plan  to \nrehabilitate,  upgrade  and  maintain  about  430  km  of  the  Highlands  Highway  and  develop \nsustainable economic corridors, consistent with the goals of the NTS and MTDP.8 \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s past investments, capacity development, and governance. In 2007, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) provided project loans to expand the capacity of the port facilities at \nLae.9 These works are now complete and options for port operations are being developed.10 In \n2008, ADB approved an MFF for the Highlands Region Road Improvement Investment Program \n(HRRIIP) to rehabilitate and improve priority sections of the core road network in the Highlands \nRegion.11 To date, this MFF is rated as \u201con track\u201d, having improved 343 km of the core feeder \nroad network that are connected to the Highlands Highway. In 2009, ADB approved an MFF for \nthe  Civil  Aviation  Development Investment  Program  (CADIP),  which  includes  the  rehabilitation \nand  upgrade  of  the  airports  at  Mt.  Hagen  and  Goroka,  two  key  population  centers  along  the \nHighlands  Highway.12 The  scheduled  completion  of  these  three  major  infrastructure  programs \nreinforces the government\u2019s designation of the Highland Highway as a top development priority, \nwhich will also complete the rehabilitation of PNG\u2019s northern transport network. \n \n12. \nIn  view  of  the  long-term nature  of  institutional  change  and the  need  to  have  continuing \nengagement,  the  investment  program  carries  forward  the  soft  (i.e.,  nonphysical)  infrastructure \nagenda being implemented under the existing HRRIIP. Under the HRRIIP, nonphysical outputs \nare  included  to  support  capacity  development,  improve  policy  frameworks,  and  strengthen \ngovernance of PNG government agencies involved in the road subsector. They include preparing \na  new  national  transport  development  plan,  increasing  road  user  charges,  establishing \nperformance-based  maintenance  contracts,  developing  the  capacity  of  the  National  Road \nAuthority (NRA), and increasing the focus on road safety. In July 2013, the government finalized \nthe NTS, which presents a strategic policy framework for the road subsector, anchored on clear \nprinciples  for  capital  investment, maintenance,  institutional  change,  and reform. The  NTS  also \noutlines  the  need  for  better  planning  and  oversight,  cost  recovery,  and  adherence  to  best \npractices  on  procurement,  safety,  construction  standards, \ntraffic  management,  gender \nconsiderations,  and  improved  governance.  The  NTS  recognizes  better  budgeting,  financial \nmanagement,  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  training  as  essential  for  strengthening  institutional \neffectiveness. \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Maintenance Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  The investment program road is the 430 km section of the Highlands Highway from Lae Nadzab airport to Kagamuga \nairport, comprising of the 57 km Chimbu crossing, which requires full major rehabilitation, and the remaining 373 km \nrequiring restoration, upgrade, and maintenance. \n\n9  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nThe  government  has  initiated  several  road  subsector  reforms  to  improve  governance, \n13. \nalthough  further  efforts  are  needed  to  ensure  that  such  initiatives  gain  broader  and  deeper \ntraction. On road maintenance financing, the government introduced road user charges through \na  fuel  tax  and  computerized  vehicle  registration  fees,  driver  licensing  fees,  and  mandatory \ninsurance programs, yet revenues are not being properly allocated for road maintenance works \nand the collective road user charges remain insufficient to provide full coverage of national road \nnetwork maintenance costs. On road maintenance contracting, the government introduced 5-year \nperformance-based maintenance contracts for the two roads completed under the first tranche of \nthe ongoing HRRIIP. The NRA was authorized by the government to manage these long-term \nperformance-based  maintenance  contracts,  but  clear  delineation  of  maintenance  responsibility \nbetween  the  NRA  and  the  Department  of  Works  (DOW)  remains  an  issue,  as  does  sufficient \nfunding  for  the  NRA\u2019s  current  mandate.  On  road  safety,  Road  Assessment  Services  Limited \ncompleted a comprehensive road safety study on the Highlands Highway in 2015 (footnote 6), \nand the staff and programs under the National Road Safety Council were centralized under the \nRoad Transport Authority in early 2017. \n \nThe  investment  program  responds  to  the  need  to  address  institutional  capacities  and \n14. \ngovernance risks in the areas of (i) project management and contract administration, (ii) financial \nmanagement, and (iii) procurement. Through dialogue with PNG\u2019s central and sector agencies as \nwell  as  other  participating  partners,  the  governance  concerns  and  corresponding  measures  to \naddress them are incorporated in the design and implementation of the investment program.13 \n \n15. \nNew multitranche financing facility and ADB value addition. The investment program \nrequires an overall investment of about $1 billion. The government has requested ADB to provide \na new MFF to rehabilitate, upgrade, and maintain the Highlands Highway through 2027. The MFF \nis  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  strategic  development  priorities  and  includes  policies  and \nreforms to strengthen institutional capacity and performance of the transport sector. The program \nis designed to be implemented through three tranches over a ten-year period. Detailed designs \nare fully completed for the first tranche and initial due diligence is under way for the remaining \ntwo tranches, but final designs will be prepared during MFF implementation.  \n \n16. \nThe  investment  program  is  included  in  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020 \nand country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for PNG, both of which indicate the importance \nof  reducing  transport  and  logistics  costs  to  support  sustainable  development  and  inclusive \ngrowth. 14  With  the  road  subsector  accounting  for  90%  of  government  expenditures  on \ninfrastructure,  the  investment  program  provides  an  opportunity  to  increase  resources  and \ninstitutional  capacities  for  more  effective  and  sustainable  road  maintenance  planning  and \nimplementation in the Highlands Region. As such, the use of the ADB-financed MFF represents \nsignificant value added for the government\u2019s investment in the road subsector. \n \nThe MFF is the most suitable funding modality. Firstly, it offers predicable financing over \n17. \na long-term implementation period. It also offers the flexibility and ability to sequence investments, \nwhich is especially valuable given the fragile and conflict-affected situations in PNG. Collectively, \nthese design features of the MFF assist the budget programming of the government\u2019s counterpart \nfunds. Secondly, the MFF supports sustained engagement and policy dialogue on implementing \n\n                                                 \n13 For  example,  aside  from  following  ADB  standards  on  procurement,  financial  management,  and  reporting,  the \nnegotiated and signed project agreement documents stipulate that the DOW will provide sufficient counterpart staff \nto  work  with  and  learn  from  the  international  consultants  of  the  program management  office  and  will  develop  an \noperations and maintenance plan. \n\n14  ADB.  2015.

Thirdly, it presents an \nopportunity  to  mobilize  significant  cofinancing  needed  for  the  investment  program.  Thus,  as \nhighlighted in the preceding paragraphs, all the preconditions for the MFF have been established: \n(i) Road Map (i.e., sector strategy), (ii) strategic context via the Country Partnership Strategy, (iii) \npolicy framework.  \n \n18.   With the ongoing MFFs for the HRRIIP and CADIP, the government, through the executing \nagencies, continues to develop a good record on MFF implementation in the transport sector. The \nexperience with the ongoing investment programs brings out emerging sector issues that are now \nincorporated  in  the  design  of  this  new  MFF.  The  most  important  lessons  revolve  around  new \nimplementation  arrangements,  including  the  use  of  larger  contracts,  improved  contractor  and \nconsultant quality gained through higher bidding standards and specifications, and regular ADB \nteam involvement led by its significant resources deployed in the field through the PNG Resident \nMission. \n \nB. \n \n19. \nThe  investment  program  responds  to  the  government\u2019s  national  development  and \ntransport  strategies  for  promoting  inclusive  and  sustainable  development  of  the  Highlands \nRegion. The impacts are aligned with (i) increased opportunity for equality and prosperity in rural \nareas;  (ii)  attainment  of  well-integrated,  safe,  affordable,  and  financially  and  environmentally \nsustainable transport systems; and (iii) improved access to health and education, and improved \nliving  standards  of  the  people  of  PNG. 15  The  outcome  will  be  increased  efficiency  and  safe \nmovement of people, goods, and services between the Highlands Region and markets. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nThe  investment  program  outputs  will  be  (i)  about  430  km  of  the  two-lane  national \nHighlands Highway from Lae Nadzab Airport to Kagamuga Airport rehabilitated, upgraded, and \neffectively maintained; (ii) road safety on the national Highlands Highway increased; (iii) transport \nlogistics and services in the Highlands Region improved; and (iv) institutional capacity of DOW to \ndeliver the investment program and sustain its benefits strengthened. \n \n21. \nThe outputs under tranche 1 will be (i) about 170 km of the two-lane national Highlands \nHighway from Lae Nadzab Airport to Kagamuga Airport rehabilitated and upgraded, and about \n430 km of the Highlands Highway effectively maintained; (ii) road safety on the national Highlands \nHighway increased; and (iii) institutional capacity of DOW strengthened. \n \n22. \nFuture  MFF  tranches  are  well  defined  and  preliminary  cost  estimates  and  initial \nprocurement plans are prepared. Aside from continuing rehabilitation and upgrade of prioritized \nsections of the Highlands Highway and ensuring that the restored assets are properly maintained, \ntranche 2 will focus on upgrading or reconstructing 29 one-lane and 40 two-lane bridges. Tranche \n3  will  (i)  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  roads  around  Goroka,  construct  a  new  bypass  road  to \naccommodate heavy and through traffic, and provide truck climbing lanes along steep gradients; \n(ii)  construct  two  logistics  platforms\u2014in  Goroka  and  in  Jiwaka  provinces\u2014for  the  trade  and \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n15 Footnote 8; and Government of PNG, Department of National Planning and Monitoring. 2014.

The investment program will be financed from the following sources: (i) \nup to $610.0 million regular loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR), (ii) up to $70.0 \nmillion concessional loans from ADB\u2019s OCR, (iii) about $186.5 million in cofinancing,17 and (iv) \nabout  $148.5  million  in  government  contribution  (Table  3).  For  tranche  1,  the  Government  of \nAustralia has committed an $11.5 million grant to be administered by ADB. Although still evolving, \nsignificant cofinancing is expected for future tranches. Financing under the MFF will cover taxes \nand duties.18 \n \n25. \nThe government has requested an MFF of (i) up to $610 million regular loans from ADB\u2019s \nOCR;  and  (ii)  up  to  $70.0  million  concessional  loans  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR  to  finance  part  of  the \n                                                 \n16 To  achieve  economies  of  scale,  value  for  money,  and  effectiveness,  each  major  civil  works  package  includes \nrehabilitation, upgrades, and maintenance. All three types of work have been planned and prioritized based on an \nengineering assessment of the entire length of the Highlands Highway and what is needed to restore and maintain \nit starting from the first tranche. For example, one section of the road may need urgent rehabilitation to restore it to \ngood  condition,  while  another  may  need  maintenance  to  prevent  deterioration.  Both  works  will  be  done \nsimultaneously to gradually restore and maintain the entire Highlands Highway to good condition. \n\n17  ADB-administered  cofinancing  will  be  approved  by  ADB  Management  consistent  with  Enhancing  Operational \n\nEfficiency of the Asian Development Bank.

The  MFF  will  consist  of  three  tranches,  subject  to  the  government\u2019s \nsubmission of related periodic financing requests, execution of related loan agreements for each \ntranche, and fulfillment of the terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework \nfinancing agreement.  \n \n26. \nThe  first  tranche  of  the  MFF  will  be  partially  financed  by  an  OCR  regular  loan  of  $272 \nmillion, an OCR concessional loan of $30 million and a grant of $11.5 million from the Government \nof Australia to be administered by ADB. The regular loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest rate determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered rate (LIBOR)-based  lending facility;  a  commitment charge  of  0.15%  per  year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the government\u2019s choice of \nthe straight-line repayment option, the average maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium \npayable to ADB is 0.2% per year. The concessional loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter \n(the interest and other charges during construction and commitment charges to be capitalized in \nthe loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan for the Investment Program \n\nAmount \n\nTotal \n\nSource \n\nTranche 1 \n($million) \n\nTranche 2      \n($ million) \n\nTranche 3      \n($ million) \n\nAmount        \n($ million) \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n\nAsian Development Bank \nOrdinary capital resources (regular \nloans) \nOrdinary capital resources \n(concessional loans) \n\nGovernment of Australia \n\nOther Development Partners \n\nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n272.0  \n\n191.0  \n\n147.0  \n\n610.0  \n\n30.0  \n\n11.5  \n\n0.0 \n\n44.0  \n\n357.5  \n\n40.0  \n\n0.0 \n\n115.0  \n\n49.0  \n\n395.0  \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n60.0  \n\n55.5  \n\n70.0  \n\n11.5  \n\n175.0  \n\n148.5  \n\n262.5  \n\n1,015.0  \n\n100% \n\n60% \n\n7% \n\n1% \n\n17% \n\n15% \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n \n The DOW will be the executing agency for the investment program. Based on lessons \n27. \nlearned  regarding  implementation  under  HRRIP\u2019s  existing  project  implementation  units (PIUs), \nPMO will be established to administer the investment program. The PMO will be larger than the \nHRRIP  PIUs  and,  as  a  single  PMO  for  the  duration  of  the  MFF,  it  is  designed  to  promote \nconsistency, uniformity, and continuity across the entire investment program; the PMO will also \nbuild the capacity of DOW through knowledge transfer and promote on-the-job learning by doing. \nThe  organizational  structure  and  staffing  complement  of  the  PMO  directly  responds  to  DOW\u2019s \ncapacity  gaps  in  procurement,  and  financial  management  in  addition  to  strengthening  project \nmanagement and administration functions. \n \n28. \nThe DOW will outsource project management and contract administration to the private \nsector  via  construction  supervision  consultants  and  international  specialists  employed  by  the \nPMO. The underlying premise is that the quality of implementation depends largely on the quality \nof the contractors and consultants. DOW outlined terms of reference for independent construction \nsupervision with emphasis on in-house qualified staff for core jobs, quality, and timely reporting. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nAn organizational structure for the PMO has been prepared, including interface channels with the \nDOW and specific terms of reference for all positions. In coordination and consultation with the \nDOW,  the  construction  supervision  and  PMO  consultants  will  be  required  to  clear  design \nproposals and payment requests against agreed contract schedules. All contracts will be subject \nto audits by independent external consultants. \n \n29. \nAll  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  As  tranche  1  will  be  jointly \nfinanced by ADB and the Government of Australia through its Department of Foreign Affairs and \nTrade,  universal  procurement  will  be  applied  to  works,  goods,  and  consulting  services  to  be \nfinanced under tranche 1.19 \n \n30. \nADB has taken specific actions to mitigate risks and ensure the efficient implementation \nof  future  works  under  the  investment  program  during  project  preparation  and  design.  The \ninvestment program is at a high state of project readiness based on completed and ongoing due \ndiligence  of  all  sections of the  430 km  Highlands  Highway.  For tranche  1,  DOW has  prepared \nbidding  documents  and associated  designs  and bills  of quantities  using ADB  standard  bidding \ndocuments  for  large  works.  The  use  of  large  contract  packages  is  preferred  to  promote \ninternational competition and reduce procurement delays from numerous smaller packages. \n \n31. \nthe facility administration manual.20 \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion \ndate \n(i)  Oversight bodies \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \nProcurementa \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting \nDisbursement \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n1 July 2017\u201321 June 2027 \n31 December 2021 (first tranche); the first tranche will close on 30 June 2022, while the \nMFF will close on 21 June 2027 \nProgram Steering Committee: Chief secretary (chair), DTR secretary, DNPM secretary, \nDOT secretary; Secretary: Provincial administrators from Morobe, Eastern Highlands, \nChimbu, Jiwaka, and Western Highlands provinces. \nDOW \nDOW, NRA, DOT, NRSC (RTA) \n\n12 contracts \n1 contract \n1,700 person-months \n700 person-months \n \n1,200 person-months \n280 person-months \n\nPMO-DOW in Goroka, 30 staff \nInternational competitive bidding \nNational competitive bidding \nConstruction supervision contracts \n(11), studies contracts (2), DOW \ncapacity building and implementation \nsupport (3), and \nRoad Safety Community support (3) \nAdvance action for procurement of civil works and recruitment of consultants will be \napplied.

The  preliminary  design  of  works,  bills  of  quantity,  and  associated \nbidding documents under tranche 1 were prepared including road maintenance, reconstruction, \nand upgrading; and road safety measures. \n \nB. \n \n33. \nThe investment program yields an economic rate of return of 16.4% and the first tranche \nyields  14.6%  demonstrating  their  economic  viability.  The  economic  analysis  is  conservative, \nfocusing on the direct benefits generated from savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time \ncosts. Based on the two-lane road design, the unit costs for periodic and routine maintenance of \nthe  Highlands  Highway  over  the  project  life  cycle  are  manageable.  The  financial  sustainability \nanalysis  demonstrates  that  the  government  has  sufficient  resources  to  meet  the  maintenance \nneeds of the Highlands Highway in the future (footnote 10), provided it follows best practices in \nasset management as articulated in the policy framework and priorities of the NTS. \n \nC. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to, and discussed \n34. \nwith,  the  government  and  the  DOW.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  facility  administration  manual.  ADB  found  the  government\u2019s \npolicies  and  procedures  on  financial  management,  procurement,  anticorruption,  and  other \ninstitutional  issues  and  mechanisms  to  be  satisfactory,  albeit  with  substantial  risks  requiring \nmitigation  measures.21 All  bidding  documents  for  contracts  under  the  investment  program  will \ninclude provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit records and accounts related to the MFF, as \nwell as those of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the MFF. The DOW and the Department of Treasury will take additional measures to strengthen \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency  under  the  MFF,  primarily  with  direct  payment \nprocedures. Key measures are (i) external auditing of contracts, project accounts, and financial \nstatements;  (ii) PMO  assistance  in  the  drafting  and  evaluation  of  procurement  documents;  (iii) \npublic disclosure on all procurement matters; and (iv) verification of contractors\u2019 payment claims \nby supervision consultants following clearly defined contract specifications. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity conducted three project procurement-related reviews in PNG of projects \nimplemented  by  the  DOW:  (i)  the  Road  Maintenance  and  Upgrading  (Sector)  Project,  published  in  2016;  (ii)  the \nBridge  Replacement  for  Improved  Rural  Access  Sector  Project,  to  be  published  in  2017;  and  (iii)  the  Highlands \nRegion  Road  Improvement  Investment  Program,  projects  1  and  2,  to  be  published  in  2017.  ADB\u2019s  Pacific \nDepartment, in collaboration with the DOW, is continuously working with the Office of Anticorruption and Integrity to \naddress  the  key  findings  from  these  reviews.  The  ADB  project  team  carefully  considered  these  lessons  when  it \nprepared this report and recommendation of the President. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  transport  assessment  identified  governance  weaknesses  related  to  the  financial \n35. \nsustainability  of  road  infrastructure  investments  because  of  inadequate  planning,  budgetary \nallocations,  and  execution  of  maintenance  works.  The  investment  program  will  address  these \nissues through long-term institutional strengthening and capacity building. International expertise \nprovided  by  the  PMO  will  course  sector  reforms  through  government  channels  and  guide  the \nDOW  through  the  application  of  international  best  practices  as  modified  to  the  PNG  context \nthrough the investment program.  \n \nAn institutional analysis and development plan was completed as part of the due diligence \n36. \nfor  the  investment  program. 22  Lessons  learned  from  the  ongoing  road  investment  program \nidentified capacity gaps in the functionality of the DOW, the NRA, and the PIUs. ADB specifically \ndesigned  a  PMO  to  support  the  DOW  in  addressing  these  gaps  to  effectively  administer  the \ninvestment  program  from  beginning  to  end,  deliver  the  core  outputs,  strengthen  project \nmanagement  capacities  of  the  involved  agencies,  and  promote  required  reforms  for  improved \nsector governance. By the end of the 10-year investment program, DOW staff will be trained to \nassume all necessary program implementation roles of the PMO. \n \nD. \n \n37. \nThe investment program is classified as a general intervention that will generate indirect \npoverty reduction impacts.23 Road users will benefit from shorter travel times and lower vehicle \noperating costs. Expanded access to improved roads will help drive the shift from subsistence to \nmarket-based agriculture, allowing farmers to grow commercial products that can be shipped to \nmarkets  more  quickly.  Farmers  may  also  diversify,  cultivate  high-value  crops,  and  grow  larger \nmarketable  surpluses  to  improve  their  income-earning  capacity.  Connectivity  will  create  more \nopportunities for about 3 million people living in the Highlands Region and their businesses, and \nwiden access to social services. \n \nThe gender action plan includes targeted activities to maximize benefits for communities \n38. \nand women along the investment program road. Specifically designed physical and nonphysical \ninterventions under the investment program include road safety improvements and awareness, \ndedicated female washing facilities and toilets, and roadside markets. The investment program \nalso  sets  minimum  thresholds  for  women\u2019s  participation  and  employment  during  construction. \nIncreased access to social services, economic opportunity, and consumer choice is expected to \nsignificantly increase the welfare of women and household incomes, and subsequently reduce \npoverty. \n \nE. \n \n39. \nThe impacts of tranche 1 on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples have been assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nDOW has prepared the required safeguards documents and mitigation measures in compliance \nwith  ADB  procedures  and  requirements  for  consultation  and  disclosure  to  the  public.  The \ngovernment has further illustrated its collective institutional capacity and commitment by agreeing \nto the institutional development plan, showing willingness to undertake an action plan to resolve \nany legacy land acquisition issues, and setting aside the funds required for land acquisition. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                 \n22 Institutional Analysis and Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f11 \n\nThe DOW prepared an environmental assessment and review framework, which sets out \n40. \na framework for screening, categorization, impact assessment, management, and monitoring for \nthe  investment  program.  Works  under  tranche  1  are  unlikely  to  result  in  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impact, and any potential temporary impacts during construction such as noise, \nemissions, or waste generation can be adequately monitored and mitigated. Therefore, tranche \n1  is  classified  as  category  B  for  the  environment.  The  DOW  included  an  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan in the initial environmental examination it prepared for tranche \n1. \n \n41. \nThe  DOW  prepared  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  for  the  investment \nprogram,  and  undertook  due  diligence  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  for  the \nproposed works financed under tranche 1. Given that all the proposed works and other activities \nare  within  the  existing  road  alignment,  the  interventions  are  classified  as  category  C  for \ninvoluntary resettlement. No person who can be defined as indigenous is in the project areas. As \nsuch,  the  indigenous  peoples\u2019  classification  is  category  C,  and  indigenous  peoples  safeguard \nmeasures are not required. \n \nF. \n \n42. \nThe  overall  risk  is  substantial,  but  manageable  through  the  application  of  mitigating \nmeasures.  Integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  costs.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \nThe main risks include (i) macroeconomic, (ii) sustainability and reforms, (iii) weak public financial \nmanagement,  (iv)  a  lack  of  transparency  in  procurement,  and  (v)  implementation  delays \nassociated with project readiness and procurement. The security of personnel and equipment is \nalso a risk that will be mitigated by constantly having close consultations with communities along \nthe road alignment and employing significant levels of local labor from these communities in the \nconstruction and maintenance works. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nMacroeconomic \n\nRisk \nAssessment \nHigh \n\nSustainability \nand reforms \n\nSubstantial \n\nWeak public \nfinancial \nmanagement \n\nSubstantial \n\nLack of \ntransparency in \nprocurement \n\nSubstantial \n\nMitigating Measures \nContinuous monitoring of macroeconomic conditions; assessment of impacts of external \nshocks,  particularly  with  respect  to  commodity  prices;  and  coordination  with  other \ndevelopment partners will be undertaken. \nAs  per  the  investment  program  design  and  associated  covenants,  adequate  future \nfunding  will  be  set  aside  for  maintenance.

Institutional and \nsector governance reforms will be accelerated through the PMO, and associated training \nprovided under the investment program will clarify mandates and responsibilities leading \nto  greater  institutional  effectiveness.  The  civil  works  contracts  and  concessions  will \ninclude performance-based maintenance for an initial period of 5 years. \nA financial management assessment has been undertaken. The skills of DOW finance \nand accounting staff in regional and provincial offices will be upgraded through rigorous \ntraining. Regular coordination meetings will be conducted between DOW regional and \nprovincial staff to identify problems early and avoid delays in the preparation of reports. \nDOW will hasten the implementation of the IFMS to include all regional and provincial \noffices and have a single unified financial management system. \nThrough  websites  and  published  notices  the  government  will  provide  and  disclose  (i) \nupdated and detailed information on project implementation; (ii) information on selection \nof consultants and contractors; (iii) independent verification of the quantity, quality, and \ncost of works; and (iv) expected service levels from performance-based contracts. \n\n                                                 \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nImplementation \ndelays \nassociated with \nproject readiness \nand procurement \n\nSubstantial \n\nImplementation  delays  may  be  caused  by  a  lack  of  project  readiness  and  the \nprocurement process. Project readiness will be increased by preparing detailed designs \nin  advance  of  procurement;  safeguards  plans;  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and \nservices; funding for land acquisition; and all internal approvals before ADB approves \nnew tranches. Readiness will eliminate or reduce delays.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DOW = Department of Works, IFMS = integrated financial management system, PMO \n= program management office. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Department of Works of Papua New Guinea. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n43. \nThe  government  and  DOW  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  investment \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as detailed \nin the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n44. \nThe government has given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in \nthe  framework  financing  agreement.
