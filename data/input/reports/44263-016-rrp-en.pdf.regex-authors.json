THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed  \npolicy-based loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 3 of the Inclusive Financial Sector \nDevelopment Program. \n \n2.   The program is part of a long-term partnership between the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the Government of Cambodia to develop an efficient and stable finance sector and to \nincrease financial inclusion. Subprogram 3 will build on the reforms achieved under subprograms \n1 and 2 by (i) providing mechanisms to improve access to credit for micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises (MSMEs), which will facilitate recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19) pandemic and beyond; (ii) implementing reforms to enhance financial stability, including \nstreamlining cross-sector institutional supervision and strengthening credit risk management; and \n(iii) upgrading financial  sector infrastructure by introducing innovative payment systems. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  ADB approved the programmatic approach and a policy-based loan for subprogram 1 in \nOctober 2016 and for subprogram 2 in September 2019.1 Subprogram 1 provided the foundation \nfor the government\u2019s financial inclusion and financial stability initiatives and developed a basic \nframework for cross-sector supervision. Subprogram 2 focused on the adoption of a national \nfinancial inclusion strategy as well as key legislation, including the Trust Law, the e-Commerce \nLaw, and the Consumer Protection Law. Under subprogram 3, the government has implemented \nthe national financial inclusion strategy and key legislation adopted under subprogram 2, and \nlaunched several initiatives to increase access to finance, including Cambodia\u2019s first-ever small \nand medium-sized enterprise (SME) public credit guarantee scheme (CGS). The government has \nalso made significant strides to preserve financial stability and improve crisis management. \n \n4.  Development problem and economic performance. During 2015\u20132019, Cambodia\u2019s \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  averaged  7.1%  per  year.  This  steady  growth  was \nunderpinned by high foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, strong export performance, prudent \nfiscal policy, low risk of sovereign debt distress, increasing domestic demand, and stable inflation \n(which averaged just 2.3% a year). The exchange rate between the riel and the US dollar has \nbeen stable. This sustained economic progress helped the country attain lower middle-income \nstatus in July 2016. The Rectangular Strategy (Phase IV) adopted in September 2018, prior to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, acknowledges that maintaining a broad-based 7% economic growth \nrate will require structural reforms. These include further diversification of the narrow economic \nbase (which is currently dominated by sectors that are at risk from automation of their labor-\nintensive processes, such as agriculture, tourism, garments, and construction) and promotion of \nprivate sector development and employment.2 \n \n5.  Impact  of  COVID-19. However,  in  2020,  the COVID-19  pandemic  caused  a  sharp \ndeceleration in the main engines of Cambodia\u2019s economy: tourism; construction; and garments, \ntextiles, and footwear. The pandemic also threatens to undermine Cambodia\u2019s progress in poverty \nreduction. As of December 2020, Cambodia\u2019s household debt was about 29.2% of GDP, up from \n \n1  ADB. 2016.

Phnom Penh. \n \n  ", "2 \n19.9% at the end of 2019.3 The crisis is expected to lead to an estimated loss of 570,000 jobs \nand may push an additional 1.1 million people into moderate poverty and 205,000 people into \nextreme  poverty.4 Moreover,  growth  prospects  have  been  affected  by  the  decision  of  the \nEuropean Union, which is among Cambodia\u2019s largest trading partners (accounting for 10.6% of \nCambodia\u2019s total trade in 2020), to partially suspend duty-free trade access under its Everything \nbut Arms scheme. Notwithstanding government measures to mitigate these impacts, including a \nfiscal stimulus package,5 GDP contracted by 3.1% in 2020 but is projected to rebound and grow \nby 1.9% in 2021 and 5.5% in 2022. The economic recovery in major trading partners will support \nstrong demand for Cambodia\u2019s merchandise exports and continued foreign direct investment.6  \n \n6.  Financial sector. Solid economic growth before the pandemic also created a favorable \nenvironment for the financial sector to expand and become more competitive and integrated with \nlocal and international markets. The banking subsector is sound and has adequate capital buffers. \nAsset quality has remained stable, with a slight increase in the gross nonperforming loan ratio \nfrom 2.0% in 2019 to 2.1% in 2020,7 as has capital adequacy, which decreased from 24.0% in \n2019 to 23.2% in 2020. However, Cambodia\u2019s financial sector remains narrow with the banking \nand  microfinance  subsectors  comprising  virtually  all  financial  sector  assets.  The  banking \nsubsector represented about 85.0% ($50.3 billion) of total sector assets, while the microfinance \nsubsector represented about 14.3% ($8.5 billion).8 In addition, liquidity and concentration risks, \nespecially in real estate, are increasing.9 At the end of 2020, bank loans to the real estate sector \n(construction,  real  estate  activities,  and  mortgages  for  owner-occupied  housing)  stood  at  \n$10.1 billion and microfinance institution (MFI) loans to the real estate sector were $0.26 billion. \nThis represented about 26.3% of the total credit portfolio in the banking system (up from 24.8% \nin 2019), of which banks accounted for 97.3% and MFIs for 2.5%. Growth in exposure to real \nestate and construction sectors was especially rapid before the COVID-19 pandemic but has \nsince had a slight downturn. Real estate credit in the banking subsector grew by 24.5% in 2020 \nand 37.9% in 2019. Compounding the issue of increasing liquidity and concentration risks in real \nestate, FDI inflows to Cambodia\u2019s real estate sector totaled $355.6 million in 2020, accounting for \n9.8% of total FDI inflows (footnote 8). \n \n7.  The  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  has  introduced  several  policy  measures  to \nenhance the resilience of the financial system and rein in credit growth, including increasing the \npaid-in capital requirement for commercial banks to $75 million, adopting the Basel III liquidity \ncoverage ratio, strengthening credit risk grading and provisioning requirements, and instituting \ncapital conservation buffers. However, more needs to be done to develop a more broad-based, \ninclusive, and sustainable financial sector. Subsectors that typically provide alternative channels \nof intermediation and long-term financing\u2014leasing, capital markets, insurance, and pension \nfunds\u2014remain underdeveloped compared with the rest of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN). In addition, there are few alternatives to offset the perceived higher levels of \ncredit risks associated with MSMEs. For example, there is a notable absence of CGSs and \n \n3  CEIC Data.

Enhancing efforts to \nensure financial stability remains critical as the economy is de facto dollarized, meaning there is \neffectively no lender of last resort. Cross-sector institutional supervision and regulation are not \nadequately streamlined, and credit risk management needs to be strengthened. \n \n8.  Financial inclusion and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. Cambodia has \na low level of financial inclusion because lending is fragmented, with credit readily available in \nurban areas, while rural areas and women remain underserved.10 According to the 2014 census, \nof the total 513,753 enterprises in the country, MSMEs accounted for 99.8% and employed 71.8% \nof the national labor force, and micro enterprises accounted for 97.6% of the enterprises in the \ncountry.11 In 2015, 62% of the micro enterprises and 26% of the SMEs were owned by women.12 \nThe Cambodian economy is highly informal, with only 5% of all enterprises registered at the \nMinistry of Commerce (MOC) or at a provincial or municipal commerce division as of 2014.13 \nThere is limited availability of financing for business growth and development. MSMEs have \nlimited access to finance, with only 17.7% of unregistered enterprises acquiring a loan or a line of \ncredit from a financial institution as of 2014. The financing gap for MSMEs is estimated to be  \n$7.7 billion ($4.2 billion for women-owned MSMEs and $3.5 billion for men-owned MSMEs).14 \nThe challenges facing women entrepreneurs are particularly severe, with only 3% having access \nto formal credit (footnote 12). Despite the high liquidity of the banking system, many banks have \ndifficulty lending to MSMEs because they find it challenging to evaluate MSMEs\u2019 creditworthiness. \nBanks usually rely on borrowers providing real estate as collateral, which MSMEs usually do not \nhave. As a result, the majority of MSMEs resort to informal sources of borrowing for investment \nand working capital, an exclusion that is likely to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n9.  Binding constraints. The government recognizes that generating better jobs to sustain \ngrowth and raise income levels in line with its COVID-19 recovery plans depends on broadening \nfinancial intermediation to support economic diversification. To meet this objective, the following \ndevelopment constraints must be addressed: (i) limited financial inclusion because of a lack of \nreasonably priced credit in local currency and an absence of consumer protection mechanisms, \n(ii) lack of a functional financial stability framework, and (iii) weaknesses in key financial sector \ninfrastructure relative to international standards. \n \n10.  Limited financial inclusion. Access to financial products and services for the poor is \nlimited and financial literacy is low. Only 21.7% of the adult population has a bank account despite \nCambodia\u2019s high private credit-to-GDP ratios.15 Microinsurance and financing to MSMEs and \nsmall farmers are limited. Businesses, including those owned by women, are hampered by their \ninability to access long-term finance due to a lack of collateral, the absence of government support \nsuch as guarantees, and financial illiteracy (e.g., in bookkeeping, accounting, and preparation of \nbusiness plans). Only 18% of Cambodians are considered financially literate; Cambodia ranked \n135th out of 144 economies in an Atlas and Standard & Poor\u2019s survey on financial literacy and \nachieved a low score of 11.5 out of a total possible score of 21 in a survey commissioned by the \n \n10 C.

A lack of \nchildhood financial education is likely to have a negative impact on the financial, economic, and \nsocial well-being of the vulnerable and low-income segment of the population. Consumers are \nnot well protected from unfair business practices. Implementing regulations and an enforcement \nframework for consumer protection are needed to ensure that trading is fair and competitive.  \n \n11.  Lack  of  a  functional  financial  stability  framework.  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  stability \nframework is weak while risks to financial stability have increased because of the acceleration of \ncredit growth, as well as potential liquidity risks owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and real estate \nlending. Financial instability disproportionately affects the poor with access to financial services \nbecause they are vulnerable to banking crises and the resulting disruptions to payment systems \nand bank closures. The poor are also indirectly impacted by instability in growth and inflation \ncaused by an unstable financial sector. The increasing use of financial technology (fintech), \nincluding  payment  systems,  requires  strengthened  regulation  of  cybersecurity,  consumer \nprotection, operational resilience, and anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism \n(AML/CFT). The government must address four primary constraints: (i) weak coordination of \nfinancial sector oversight and supervision among key government agencies, (ii) lack of protection \nfor the growing depositor base, (iii) lack of a local currency domestic debt market as an alternative \nto bank debt (lowering the economy\u2019s reliance on the banking subsector for credit), and (iv) lack \nof a formal cross-sector regulator of nonbank financial products. \n \n12.  Weaknesses in key financial sector infrastructure relative to international standards. \nCambodia\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and restricts access to finance and market \ndevelopment. It has critical gaps that inhibit wider local and foreign stakeholder participation, and \nthese have slowed the development of access channels to initiate and deliver cashless payments. \nThree limitations need to be addressed: (i) payment systems are outdated; (ii) implementing \nregulations for e-commerce, digital finance, and trust products do not exist; and (iii) compliance \nwith  global  standards  for  AML/CFT  such  as  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force  (FATF)  \n40 Recommendations is weak.17 \n \n13.  Strategic  alignment.  The  program  directly  supports  the  reforms  outlined  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s  National  Strategic  Development  Plan,  2019\u20132023; 18  the  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment Strategy (FSDS), 2016\u20132025;19 and Cambodia\u2019s commitment to implement the \n \nASEAN special declaration on COVID-19.20 The program also contributes to ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \noperational priorities  by addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; accelerating \nprogress in gender equality; tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability; promoting rural development and food security; and \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity.21 The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country \n \n16 Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center. 2016.

Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n14.  The government\u2019s reform agenda. The government considers its commitments under \nthe ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025 to be a catalyst for continued reforms of the \ndomestic and external financial sector integration.23 Anchored in the FSDS (footnote 19), the \ngovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda  prioritizes  the  development  of  a  sound  financial  sector  that \ncontributes to poverty reduction by supporting economic growth and increasing the poor\u2019s access \nto finance. Specific goals include (i) the development of the nonbank subsector and capital market, \n(ii) alignment of regulations and supervision with international standards, (iii) the establishment of \na formal crisis management mechanism, and (iv) financial inclusion. The National Financial \nInclusion Strategy (NFIS), 2019\u20132025, which is at an early stage of implementation, identifies \nshort-, medium-, and long-term interventions in inclusive finance and financial literacy.  \n \n15.  Programmatic approach. The program supports three reform areas: (i) access to formal \nfinancial services for the poor, (ii) financial sector stability, and (iii) financial sector infrastructure. \nAt the time of approval of subprogram 2, the government agreed to accomplish 17 indicative policy \nactions for subprogram 3. While all 17 were achieved, 15 policy actions are reflected in the policy \ndesign and monitoring framework. Two indicative policy actions on the preparation of draft laws \non the deposit protection scheme and on the bank resolution regime were achieved and thus \nmeet the requirements of the original indicative policy actions. They are being reviewed by the \ngovernment to ensure that they are practicable under all local laws and regulations. These laws \nhave become increasingly important in the context of the economic downturn brought about by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, and the government has requested the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) to further review and improve these laws to ensure that they are aligned with international \nstandards. In this regard,  ADB and the government  have agreed to strengthen these two \nindicative policy actions with their submission to the National Assembly and move them to the \npost-program partnership framework (P3F).24 This shift did not affect the expected outcome and \noutcome indicators.  A Trust Law implementing regulation was adopted, and female trustees were \nregistered under the new nonfinancial trusts. The indicative policy action was revised to reflect a \nmore important reform in subprogram 3 \u2013 the establishment of the trust regulator under the newly \ncreated Non-bank Financial Services Authority (NBFSA), which will supervise financial trusts \nwhen they are developed in the near future . There have been no significant revisions to the other \npolicy actions, which are discussed in a supplementary linked document.25 The changes are \nreflected in the policy design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n16.  Reform area 1: Access to formal financial services for the poor. This reform area built \non the achievements of subprograms 1 and 2 by promoting a more inclusive financial sector, \nintroducing landmark government-backed credit-enhancing financial products, and establishing a \nframework for adequate consumer protection. Under subprogram 3, (i) the government continued \nto implement the NFIS; (ii) the NBC collaborated with ASEAN on a regional monitoring and \n \n22 ADB. 2019.

To complement these initiatives, the NBC launched a \nprogram in conjunction with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport to incorporate financial \nliteracy into the national curriculum for primary and secondary schools in five subjects. Student \ntextbooks and teacher training manuals were developed, and physical classroom pilots were held \nin six schools across three provinces.26 Cambodia joins 59 countries that are implementing \nnational strategies for financial education or implementing financial education in schools.27 \n \n17.  The  Securities  and  Exchange  Regulator  of  Cambodia  (SERC)  developed  financial \nmanagement and securities literacy programs targeted at university students and investment \nprofessionals, and the Agricultural and Rural Development Bank (ARDB) implemented a training \nof trainers financial literacy program in basic accounting and cooperative management for rural \nfarmers and agriculture cooperatives. There was significant female staff participation in all three \nfinancial literacy programs. Embedding financial literacy in all facets of society, starting with boys \nand girls, will enable Cambodians to better manage their financial resources, support enterprises \nand capital market development, and contribute to financial empowerment and well-being. \n \n18.  In February 2020, the NBC awarded the ARDB a full commercial banking license. The \nARDB adopted a 3-year business plan (2021\u20132023), which incorporates COVID-19 recovery \nmeasures, to better serve the agriculture sector and support the transition of subsistence farmers \ninto agriculture entrepreneurs. Following the enactment of the Consumer Protection Law, the \ngovernment adopted implementing regulations which, among others, established the National \nCommission  for  Consumer  Protection  under  the  new  General  Department  of  Consumer \nProtection,  Competition  and  Fraud  Prevention  at  the  MOC,  the  enforcement  agency.28 To \nencourage  the  use  of  microinsurance  by  the  underserved  segment  of  the  population,  the \ngovernment licensed microinsurance operators, permitted banks to act as insurance agents, and \ndesigned tailored products such as insurance against breast cancer and discounted life insurance \nfor women. As a result, women accounted for 55% of microinsurance clients as of 2020. \n \n19.  Small and medium-sized enterprise credit guarantees. The Ministry of Economy and \nFinance (MEF) established Cambodia\u2019s first-ever public CGS, which is operated by the Credit \nGuarantee Corporation of Cambodia (CGCC), a state-owned enterprise, and provided $200 \nmillion  in  capital.  The  CGS,  named  the  Business  Recovery  Guarantee  Scheme,  will  be \nimplemented in two phases that will support MSMEs and large corporates through the COVID-19 \nrecovery period and beyond. Phase 1 (2021\u20132022) focuses on survival and preparation for \nCOVID-19 recovery, during which time large corporates will also be eligible;29 and phase 2 (2023 \nonward) will focus on recovery and economic diversification, during which only MSMEs will be \neligible. The CGS will initially target all sectors, as well as gender, rural areas, and job creation.30 \nA well-designed CGS will help to mitigate the collateral constraints of Cambodian SME borrowers, \nreduce the risks to banks of lending to SMEs (and hence unlock financing for the SMEs), and \npromote private sector development.

Reform area 2: Financial sector stability. Building on subprograms 1 and 2, this reform \narea established measures to increase financial sector stability and confidence, enlarge and \ndeepen the bank and nonbank financial subsectors, grow the capital market, and strengthen crisis \nmanagement. Under subprogram 3, a royal decree was adopted which established the National \nFinancial Stability Committee chaired by the Prime Minister and composed of senior agency \nofficials. This committee will protect the financial system against internal and external shocks and \nplay a critical role in managing financial crises. A law was also enacted to establish the NBFSA, \nwhich consolidates the responsibilities of the two existing nonbank financial regulators, the MEF \nand SERC, to strengthen the effective management, control, and development of the nonbank \nfinancial industry.31 To further diversify the nonbank financial subsector, the government also \napproved a framework for the establishment of collective investment schemes in trust form. \n \n21.  The regulation of fintech will be important for financial stability, given its growing use in \nCambodia\u2019s  financial  sector.  The  NBC  issued  regulations  for  Bakong,32 a  successful  and \ninnovative peer-to-peer payment system based on distributed ledger technology, to facilitate \ncashless transactions between retail customers of local banks and payment services providers.33 \nA fintech development road map was also adopted, which will improve digital financial literacy, \nincluding among women. The National Assembly approved the Law on Government Securities, \n2020, an abrogation of the 2007 version, to align government securities operations with the Law \non the Public Finance System and annual and supplemental budget laws.34 This enables, among \nothers, the issuance of local currency government debt securities, which will establish a yield \ncurve, a meaningful benchmark for pricing financial products and a prerequisite to developing the \ncountry\u2019s capital market. To prepare for bond issuance, the government built the capacity of key \nagency officials through stakeholder consultations and workshops, and prepared a road map for \nissuance, registration, and trading.  \n \n22.  Reform  area  3:  Financial  sector  infrastructure.  This  reform  area  built  on  the \nachievements  of  previous  subprograms  by  supporting  financial  infrastructure  upgrades, \nstrengthening AML/CFT, and enabling more financial products and services. The NBC launched \nthe operational phase of Bakong, a key e-commerce infrastructure (para. 21) and completed the \nfirst phase of its enhancement to incorporate a large-value payment system with the functionalities \nof a real-time gross settlement system such as credit transfer, transaction and information \nrequests,  and  settlements  and  statistics  reporting.  The  government  has  strengthened  its \nAML/CFT regime by adopting three laws, three sub-decrees, and one directive. As a result, an \ninternal assessment confirmed that the country had achieved largely compliant or compliant \nratings on 29 of the FATF 40 Recommendations (para. 12) in preparation for the next Asia/Pacific \nGroup on Money Laundering evaluation by the end of 2021. \n \n23.  The government adopted a sub-decree on Organization and Functioning of the NBFSA, \nwhich described the role and function of the trust regulator in implementing the Trust Law. Under \nthe trust scheme, the MEF has registered five female trustees out of a total 23 trustees. The \n \n31 The nonbank financial sector regulated by the newly formed NBFSA comprises insurance, private pensions, \nsecurities, social security, project bid management, accounting and auditing, real estate, and mortgages. \n32 Bakong combines e-wallets, mobile payments, online banking, and financial applications within one easy-to-use \ninterface for any preferred bank account. \n33 K.

Finally, \nthe MOC rolled out a comprehensive MSME e-commerce training program for public and private \nsector e-commerce trainer participants, more than 30% of whom were women. The aim of the \nprogram was to strengthen the skills and capacities of a pool of national e-commerce coaches to \nguide Cambodia's MSMEs and female entrepreneurs toward successful e-commerce ventures. \n \n24.  Post-program partnership framework. The P3F reflects the government\u2019s commitment \nto sustaining reform and will strengthen accomplishments under the program. The P3F includes \n(i) mainstreaming financial literacy in the national school curriculum; (ii) CGCC issuing guarantees \nto SME borrowers, targeting women-owned businesses; (iii) issuing local currency government \nbonds; (iv) operationalizing a large-value payment and settlements system; (v) making efforts to \nensure that Cambodia is removed from the FATF \u201cgrey list\u201d (the list of Jurisdictions under \nIncreased Monitoring); and (vi) submitting the deposit protection scheme and bank resolution laws \nto the National Assembly for approval.35 These reforms will be supported by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s experience. ADB has a long and productive engagement with Cambodia in \nsupport of financial sector development spanning more than 20 years (since 1999) through a \nseries of well-sequenced programmatic policy-based loans, technical assistance, and grant \nprojects, all aligned with the FSDS series.36 During this period, there have been several notable \naccomplishments (figure).37 Beginning in 2001, the first Financial Sector Program, 2001\u20132005 \nestablished a legal and regulatory regime for banking and insurance, strengthened supervision \nand surveillance of financial institutions, and developed key financial infrastructure.38 Under the \nSecond Financial Sector Program, 2006\u20132010, ADB supported modernization of the payment \nclearing and settlements system and the NBC fully computerized its core banking system.39 ADB \nalso supported the establishment of the Cambodia Financial Intelligence Unit to support AML/CFT. \nThe Third Financial Sector Program, 2011\u20132015 initiated ADB\u2019s support for capital markets and \n  s\nincorporated the recommendations of Cambodia\u2019s first Financial Sector Assessment Program.40 \n \n \n35 This legislation will designate a resolution authority to safeguard the public interest and ensure the continuity of \ncritical banking functions in a financial crisis.  \n36 ADB. 2001.

Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s long engagement in Cambodia\u2019s financial sector has provided \nthree key lessons that have informed subprogram 3.41 First, financial sector development is a \ngradual process that requires proper sequencing. Key foundational reforms to the banking \nsubsector must be in place before progressing to more complex reforms to the nonbank subsector. \nSecond, government coordination and ownership of reforms articulated through a series of \nFSDSs are necessary to ensure that financial sector development is based on predetermined \nsteps, with each one supported by interagency coordination to achieve broad support for reforms. \nThird, as financial services play a key role in supporting the growth of the real economy while \npromoting inclusive finance, a comprehensive reform approach is required to make the financial \nsector more inclusive.  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s value addition to the program design and implementation. ADB provided \ntechnical assistance (footnote 36) that contributed directly to the implementation of the reforms \nunder subprogram 3, including (i) the financial literacy program for the national school curriculum \nfor university and investment professionals and for the agriculture sector; (ii) regulations for \nconsumer protection and e-commerce; (iii) the design and legal and technical structuring of the \nCGS and CGCC; (iv) the fintech development road map; (v) development of a government bond \nmarket carried out jointly with the ASEAN Secretariat under the ASEAN Bond Market Initiative; \nand (vi) the dedicated MSME e-commerce training program. \n \n28.  Development partner coordination. ADB is the lead development partner supporting \nCambodia\u2019s financial sector and provides comprehensive support in coordination with some \nbilateral and multilateral development agencies. The IMF supports the government\u2019s efforts to \naddress elevated macro-financial risks by supporting the NBC on banking supervision and \nfinancial  stability,  monetary  policy  and  foreign  exchange  operations,  de-dollarization,  and \nstrengthening of AML/CFT. ADB collaborated with the IMF on macroeconomic analysis and, \nthrough this program\u2019s policy dialogue, on deposit protection, bank resolution, and COVID-19 \n \n41 ADB. 2016. Completion Report: Third Financial Sector Program in Cambodia. Manila. \n \n  ", "10 \nrecovery  measures  pertaining  to  the  financial  sector.  The  World  Bank  supports  banking \nsupervision, insurance, and financial inclusion. ADB continues to collaborate with the ASEAN \nSecretariat under the ASEAN Bond Market Initiative on policy reforms linked to developing a \ndomestic government debt market. ADB collaborated with the World Bank and the IMF while \ndesigning and structuring the CGS for CGCC. The government\u2019s implementation of the NFIS is \nsupported by the United Nations Capital Development Fund. \n \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n29.  The impact of the reforms is demonstrated through three primary channels, as reflected \nin the policy design and monitoring framework: (i) the growth of the financial sector, which will \nlead to increased intermediation and private sector growth; (ii) strengthened consumer deposit \nprotection, which will provide greater depositor confidence, as shown by the increased bank \ndeposit share to GDP; and (iii) increased financial inclusion, which will give more people access \nto a growing financial sector. During 2015\u20132020, the ratio of total private sector credit of banks to \nGDP grew from 75.4% to 137.1%, the M2-to-GDP ratio increased from 72.4% to 124.5%,42 and \nthe number of women with an account at a formal financial institution increased from 1.08 million \nto 2.68 million. Gross insurance premiums increased from $151.4 million in 2017 to $272.9 million \nin 2020. As a result of the reform progress made during the program, new outcome indicators \nwere added: up to 10% of SME loans are expected to be guaranteed by CGCC to support  \nCOVID-19 recovery, and the launch of a new financial trust product will promote diversification of \nthe financial sector. The program\u2019s economic assessment estimates that the 3-year GDP increase \nthat is expected from the financial inclusion reforms for 2021\u20132024 ranges from $198 million to \n$330 million.43 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n30.  The government has requested a concessional loan of $40 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 3. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per \nyear thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The \nsize of the loan is based on Cambodia\u2019s development financing needs as identified during country \nprogramming and strategy formulation, the development impact of the policy reform package, and \nthe development spending arising from the reforms. In 2021, the fiscal deficit is expected to be \n$2.0 billion or 7% of GDP. Based on the Budget Law for 2021, financing needs at the national \nlevel are $2.30 billion, with $1.04 billion to be financed domestically and $1.26 billion from foreign \nfinancing (with $210.43 million in budget support). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  The implementation period of subprogram 3 was from October 2019 to July 2021. The \nNBC  is  the  executing  agency.  The  ARDB,  MEF,  MOC,  and  SERC  are  the  implementing \nagencies.44 A financial sector steering committee, chaired by the governor of the NBC with \nrepresentatives of the implementing agencies as members, oversees the implementation of the \nprogram. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n42 M2 (broad money) includes notes and coins, and more illiquid money such as bank deposits, treasury bills, and gilts. \n43 Program Economic Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n44 In April 2020, the Rural Development Bank changed its name to the ARDB. In February 2021, the Securities and \nExchange Commission of Cambodia changed its name to the SERC. \n \n  ", "11 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n32.  Governance.  The government is committed to enhancing good governance in its public \nfinancial management (PFM) by introducing international best practices and standards and \ntransforming  its  PFM  systems  toward  result-based  fiscal  planning  and  decentralization. \nGovernance has been at the core of Cambodia\u2019s PFM reform strategy as reflected in the \nRectangular  Strategy  (Phase  IV)  (footnote  2).  In  August  2020,  ADB  approved  a  sector \ndevelopment program for continued strengthening of subnational fiscal planning, PFM, and public \nadministration,  which  supported  decentralization  and  deconcentration  reforms.  The  project \ncomponent  established  the  National  School  of  Local  Administration  to  provide  sustainable \ncapacity development for staff of subnational administrations.45  \n \n33.  Poverty  and  social.  The  program  is  categorized  general  intervention  to  support \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The promotion of inclusive finance extends \naffordable formal financial services to the poor and rural microenterprises. Key reforms include \npilot programs for financial literacy in the national school curriculum and for rural farmers, the \nimplementation of the NFIS, including its monitoring and evaluation framework, and mitigating \nfinancial  risk  in  low-income  households  through  affordable  microinsurance.  Strengthened \nconsumer protection and a dedicated public SME CGS targeting poorer entrepreneurs will instill \nconsumer confidence and ensure that the underserved benefit from financial services and \nproducts. \n \n34.  Gender. Subprogram 3 is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. It targets the \nincreased financial inclusion of women and sets gender equality targets for utilizing modern \nfinancial products. The government has achieved these through the implementation of the NFIS \nand has launched pilot programs for financial literacy in formal education, which benefits girls and \nboys. Of the teachers receiving financial literacy teacher training, 67% are women. The program \nto improve the financial literacy of the securities industry for university students and investment \nprofessionals includes women. A training of trainers program in financial literacy and basic \ncooperative management for rural farmers and agriculture cooperatives was attended by ARDB \nstaff, 24% of whom were women. Cambodia\u2019s first government-backed SME CGS prioritizes \ncompanies led by women and will provide a pathway for women\u2019s access to finance from \ncommercial banks. The MEF has made considerable efforts to raise awareness of the importance \nof  insurance  among  women-led  businesses  and  households  and,  as  a  result,  55%  of \nmicroinsurance clients in 2020 were female. The MEF has also registered five female trustees \nunder the newly enacted trust scheme. The MOC rolled out a dedicated MSME e-commerce \ntraining program to a pool of trainers, 30% of whom were women, who will guide Cambodia's \nMSMEs and female entrepreneurs toward e-commerce success. The NBC\u2019s fintech development \nroad map includes a dedicated financial and digital literacy program aimed at women. Women \nwill be the main beneficiaries of financial literacy and e-commerce reforms. \n \n35.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The \nprogram is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguard impacts within the \nmeaning of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n36.
