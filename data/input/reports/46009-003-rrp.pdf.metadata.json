The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be \nprovided  by  the  Government  of  Australia  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  project,  and  if  the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the administration of the grant for the additional financing.1  \n\n2. \nThe additional financing to the project includes four outputs to restore key infrastructure \ndamaged  by  the  2013  floods  that  affected  20  of  Cambodia\u2019s  24  provinces:  (i)  national  and \nprovincial roads rehabilitation, (ii) rural roads rehabilitation, (iii) irrigation rehabilitation and flood \nmanagement,  and  (iv)  project  management  and  facilitation.  The  project  covers  six  severely \nflood-affected  provinces:  Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  Kampong  Cham,  Kampong  Thom, \nOddar Meanchey, and Siem Reap.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\nCurrent  Flood  Damage  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project.  In  2012,  the  Asian \n3. \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Project  to  enable  economic  and  social  recovery  and \nrestore key infrastructure damaged during the 2011 floods, caused by exceptionally heavy rains, \nwhich  affected  18  of  Cambodia\u2019s  24  provinces.3 The  scope  included  (i)  national  and provincial \nroads  restoration,  (ii)  rural  roads  restoration,  (iii)  irrigation  and  flood  control,  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement. By the end of February 2014, overall progress was estimated at 65% against the \nelapsed  time  of  55%.  Cumulative contract  awards  of  the combined  loan  and grant  were  $55.2 \nmillion,  equivalent  to  93%  of  the  total  project  amounts;  cumulative  disbursements  were  $31.2 \nmillion, 52% of the total project amounts. \n \n4. \nThe project is performing well based on the criteria stated in ADB\u2019s Additional Financing \nPolicy:  4 (i)  the  strong  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  to  coordinate  and \nimplement the project and achieve the intended outputs and outcome without any major delay, \n(ii)  strong  contract  award  and  disbursement  records  against  projections,  (iii)  compliance  with \ncovenants \nthrough \nimplementation of the risk assessment and risk management plan. The project performance is \ncurrently on track. \n \n5. \nNeed  for  Additional  Financing.  Cambodia  experienced  serious  flash  floods  from  late \nSeptember to mid-October 2013. The damage to infrastructure was similar to that caused by the \nfloods  in  2011.  However,  the  floods  were  more  intense  and  sudden,  caused  by  heavy  rainfall \ncombined  with  runoff  from  Thailand  into  Cambodia\u2019s  northwestern  provinces.  Twenty  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  24  provinces  were  impacted,  168  deaths  recorded,  and  over  1.7  million  people \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Information  on  assistance  of  other  development  partners  is  given  in  Development  Coordination  (accessible  from \nthe  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The  Government  is  expected  to  cover  the  longer-term  infrastructure \nconstruction expenses of the remaining provinces from their own budget allocation.  \n\n(iv)  successful  management  of \n\nincluding  safeguards,  and \n\n3  The Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project was approved on 27 March 2012 and became effective on \n14  May  2012,  with  a  loan  closing  date  of  30  September  2015  in  the  amount  of  SDR35,347,000  ($55  million \nequivalent)  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund.  The  Government  of  Australia  provided  a  grant  of  A$5.00  million \n($5.25 million equivalent), while the government contributed $6.93 million equivalent. \n\nrisks \n\n4  ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/OP. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\naffected (about 10% of the national population). The damage from the 2013 floods, compared to \nthe  events  in  2011,5 appears  to  have  been  less  extensive  in  scale,  yet  in  some  provinces  the \nflood impact was more significant than in 2011 because of a combination of factors such as the \nunexpected severity of the floods, the longer time it took for waters to recede, repeated floods \nand  flash  floods,  limited  preparedness,  and  limited  early  warning.  According  to  the  National \nCommittee for Disaster Management, 45,905 households had to be evacuated, although many \npeople  have  since  been  able  to  return.  More  than  240,195  houses,  1,254  schools,  92  health \ncenters  and  hospitals,  and  533  pagodas  have  been  affected,  with  sizeable  infrastructure \ndamage, including 440 kilometers (km) of national roads and 3,569 km of rural roads. More than \n126,925  hectares  of  transplanted  rice  and  57,443  hectares  of  other  crops  were  damaged, \nrepresenting about 8% of the total cultivated area. \n\n \nThe  government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  urgent  assistance  to  support  relief, \n6. \nrehabilitation,  and  reconstruction  of  infrastructure  arising  from  flash  floods.6 ADB  approved  a \ngrant  of  $3  million  to  Cambodia  under  the  Asia  Pacific  Disaster  Response  Fund  on  14 \nNovember  2013.  Given  the  similar  nature  of  damage, the  emergency,  and  the  implementation \nmechanisms  in  the  current  project,  additional  financing  to  the  existing  emergency  assistance \nloan  is  the  most suitable response to the flood emergency. This  would (i)  maximize  synergies \nand  the  response  impacts,  (ii)  take  advantage of  the  lessons from  the  2011 flood response  to \nspeed  up  emergency  actions,  and  (iii)  utilize  the  existing  implementation  structures  and \ncapacities to achieve faster disbursements and implementation.7 \n \n7. \nDamage,  loss,  and  needs  assessment.  ADB  closely  cooperated  with  the  United \nNations Development Program to assist the government to conduct a post-floods early recovery \nneeds assessment, measuring the extent of the damage and providing a framework for recovery. \nThe  assessment  was  completed  in  late  January  2014.  Total  damage  and  losses  to  all  assets \nand  public  infrastructure,  including  roads  (national,  provincial,  and  rural),  irrigation  facilities, \nwater supply and sanitation facilities (mostly small-scale rural), schools, and health centers were \nestimated at $356 million. \n \n8. \nGovernment  response.  The government\u2019s  immediate  budget response to  the  crisis  in \n2013\u20132014 amounted to $24 million, which is far below the $118 million required for short-term \ninfrastructure recovery needs estimated in the Post-Floods Early Recovery Needs Assessment \nReport. Government fully expects to cover the rest of the longer-term infrastructure construction \nexpenses  from  its  own  budget  allocation,  other  related  infrastructure  projects,  and  assistance \nfrom development partners. \n \n9. \nthe restoration of flood-damaged infrastructure may be divided into three stages:  \n\nFlood impact response framework. As a framework for structuring the project activities, \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nStage  1.  Immediate  repairs  to  reestablish  use  of  the  infrastructure  on  a \ntemporary  basis  and  restore  communications.  The  most  urgent  work  has  been \nimplemented  by  the  government  using  its  own  resources,  and  therefore  ADB \nsupport will focus on stages 2 and 3. \nStage  2.  Fast-track  repairs  where  it  is  necessary  to  restore  functionality  before \nthe  next  wet  season  to  secure  the  existing  (undamaged)  works  and  thus  avoid \n\n                                                \n5  In  2011,  the  floods  affected  18  provinces  and  about  1.5  million  affected  people,  and  caused  250  deaths.  The \ndamage to infrastructure and agricultural crops was estimated at about $500 million.

Urgent  preparation  of \npackages under this stage is the current emphasis of the line ministries.  \nStage  3.  Complete  flood  damage restoration  over  the  following  two  dry  season \nconstruction  periods  (2015  and  2016).  Flood  capacity  of  key  structures \n(especially  spillways)  will  be  upgraded  and  improved  and  operational  plans  and \ncapacity  will  be  reviewed.  A  hydrological  review,  taking  into  account  climate \nchange  projections  and  impacts,  will  be  implemented  to  update  flood  flow \nestimates for improving design capacity of key infrastructure to support enhanced \nflood management planning and operations. The measures will reduce risks from \nfuture flooding. Design adjustments will also reflect lessons from implementation \nof the Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project. \n\n  \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  is  economic  and  social  recovery  from  the  2013  floods  in  the \nproject  provinces  accelerated.  The  outcome  of  the  project  is  reconstruction  of  critical \ninfrastructure to restore livelihoods and access and protect against future flooding. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nGiven  the  extent  of  the  infrastructure  damage  and  the  limited  resources  available,  the \n11. \nproposed  project  prioritizes  specific  areas  and  sectors,  and  infrastructure  rehabilitation  will  be \nconducted in two stages\u2014stage 2 and stage 3. \n \nOutput 1: National and provincial roads rehabilitated. This project output will include \n12. \nreconstruction  of  flood-damaged  national  and  provincial  roads  in  five  provinces.  In  Kampong \nCham, one bridge along provincial road 270, which was severely  weakened by the floods, will \nbe replaced and 16.19 km of national road 70 will be reconstructed. In Banteay Meanchey, 25.0 \nkm of provincial road 156D and 24.8 km of provincial road 2563 will be repaired and upgraded, \nand two bridges replaced. In Kampong Thom, 8.15 km of provincial road 264E and 7.50 km of \nprovincial road 264D will be reconstructed. In Siem Reap, 11.3 km of provincial road 265F and \n6.0 km of national road 63 will be reconstructed. In Battambang, 19.7 km of provincial road 1570 \nwill be reconstructed. Stage 1 works have already been completed under government funding to \nrestore minimum function of national and provincial roads.  \n \n13. \nOutput 2: Rural roads rehabilitated. There has been extensive damage to many rural \nroads as a result of the floods such that lifelines, particularly in project areas, were cut off. The \nhighest priority stage 2 works comprise 115 km of rural roads, to benefit 125,414 people in the \nselected  provinces,  by  rehabilitation  of  damaged  surface  and  structures.  Stage  3  works \ncomprise  142  km  of  rural  roads,  to  benefit  158,993  people,  through  improvements  for  reliable \nand  more  efficient  access  between  rural  communities  and  markets.  Improved  traffic  flow  and \nefficient communications will lead to reduced fuel consumption. These roads were selected from \nthe five priority provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, \nand Siem Reap. The stage 3 roads involve upgrading of a subset of the stage 2 roads, and are \nselected based on priority requirements for improvement and long-term climate resilience. \n \n14. \nOutput  3:  Irrigation  rehabilitated  and  improved  flood  management.  At  least  nine \nflood-damaged  irrigation  schemes  covering  about  37,500  hectares  will  be  rehabilitated  and \nin  five  provinces\u2014Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  Kampong  Thom,  Oddar \nimproved \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fMeanchey,  and  Siem  Reap.8 Stage  2  works  will  involve urgent rehabilitation to  restore  service \nfunctionality  for  implementation  during  the  2014  dry  season.  Stage  3  works  will  be  upgraded \nwith  infrastructure  improvements,  to  be  implemented  during  the  2015  and  2016  dry  seasons. \nCivil  works  and  development  of  hydromet  capacity  will  increase  future  flood  resilience  and \ncontribute  to  mitigation  strategies  to  lower  risk  arising  from  climate  change. 9  The  pilot \ndevelopment  of  a  hydromet  system  in  three  river  catchments  will  form  the  basis  for  improved \nflash  flood  forecasting  capacity  in  western  catchments.10 When  complete,  it  will  provide  real-\ntime  data  to  support  the  implementation  of  a  strategic  flood  management  plan  and  mitigate \nrecurrent flood risks emanating from large flows in those catchments that impact water storages \nand  infrastructure.  The  hydromet  equipment  will  be  complementary  to  the  strategic  water \nmanagement plan, being developed under ADB\u2019s program.11  \n \nOutput 4: Project management and facilitation. This output will support the Ministry of \n15. \nFinance, as executing agency, in overseeing and managing the project. It will be supported by \nconsultants  to  ensure  that  fiduciary  and  safeguards  procedures  are  followed  and  that \nimplementation  schedules  are kept  on track.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided to assist  the \nexecuting  agency  and  implementing  agencies  with  project  management  support  as  well  as \nassistance with the coordination and development of a cross-sector flood management strategy \nfor the affected areas. \n \nD. \n \n16. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $90.68 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n  \nB. \nC. \n  \n\n  \n\nBase Costb \n1.

To  ensure  that  project  activities  are \ncompleted  before  the  onset  of  the  wet  season  (July  2014),  stage  2  works  will  need  to \ncommence  before  loan  effectiveness.  The  government  has  requested  retroactive  financing  be \nused  to  secure  consulting  services  and  stage  2  procurement  packages.  Retroactive  financing \ncan  apply  to  eligible  expenditures  incurred  after  30  September  2013,  but  not  earlier  than  12 \nmonths  before  the  date  of  loan  or  grant  agreement,  provided  the  project  coordination  and \nmonitoring unit (PCMU), assisted by consultants, certifies the expenditures and that certification \nis  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  principle,  retroactive  financing  approval  will  be  sought  for  the  initial \ncosts of consultant recruitment and the procurement of stage 2 civil works contracts. Details on \nprocedures for retroactive financing and advance actions are in the PAM. The government has \nbeen advised that approval of advance action and/or retroactive financing does not commit ADB \nto finance any part of the project. \n \n20. \nProcurement.  Stage  2  contracts  will  be  awarded  under  direct  contracting,  using  those \ncontractors  that  performed  well  under  the  Flood  Damage  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project, \nsubject  to  following  relevant  prior-  and  post-review  processes.  Procedures  are  to  be \ndocumented  in  each  component\u2019s  procurement  plan.  Stage  3  contracts  are  expected  to  start \nafter the 2014 wet season. Competitive procurement procedures will be followed for all stage 3 \nproject packages. Civil works packages of less than $4 million may be procured using national \ncompetitive  bidding,  with  international  competitive  bidding  for  larger  packages,  as  per \nprocedures  outlined  in  the  procurement  plans.  Procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Detailed procedures \nare outlined in the PAM. \n \n21. \nConsulting  services.  Consultant  support  will  be  extended  for  the  additional  financing \nunder  variation  orders  to  support  the  PCMU  and  the  three  implementing  agencies.17 Under \noutputs  1\u20133,  the  existing  international  consulting  firms  in  association  with  national  consulting \n                                                \n17   ADB.  2014.

Individual consultants (one international \nand two national) will be invited to continue providing assistance to the PCMU under  output 4. \nThe  engagement  of  consultants  under  ADB  financing  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Complete \ndetails on the terms of reference of the consulting firms are provided in the PAM. \n \n22.  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  current  PCMU  will  use \nthe  existing  project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system using the targets, indicators, assumptions, and \nrisks in the design and monitoring framework. This will be updated for the additional financing. \nThe  data  will  be  disaggregated  by  income  levels,  gender,  and  ethnicity.  The  PCMU  and \nimplementing  agencies  will  continue \nloan \nassurances\u2014policy,  legal,  financial,  safeguards,  and  gender.  The  Flood  Damage  Emergency \nReconstruction  Project  midterm  review  confirmed  that  monitoring  and  evaluation  requirements \nare  being  completed,  including  adherence  to  safeguards.  Further  details  are  provided  in  the \nPAM. \n\nto  monitor  and  ensure \n\nthe  compliance  of \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nStandard  economic  and  financial  assessments  will  be  undertaken  for  all  subprojects \nunder  the  investment  packages  in  stage  3. 18  All  project  investments  are  expected  to  be \neconomically viable. The economic internal rate of return for all stage 3 subprojects is expected \nto  be  greater  than  12%. 19 Stage  3  subprojects  will  restore  basic  infrastructure  and,  in  the \nprocess, improve the welfare of affected people and businesses. The investments will improve \nconnectivity as well as trade, agriculture production, and access to social services. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nPublic  financial  management.   The  government  has  embarked  on  a  Public  Financial \n24. \nManagement Reform Program since 2004 and the public financial management system is being \ndeveloped,  but  improvements  are needed to achieve  full  accountability  in public  expenditures. \nThe  2010  Public  Expenditure  Financial  Accountability  Assessment  indicates  mixed  but \nimproving  performance.  An  update  assessment  in  2012  was  that  the  program  implementation \nwas  overall  on  track.  ADB  has  also  supported  capacity  building  for  three  rural  development \nministries  in  budget  preparation  and  execution,  financial  management  and  accounting, \nprocurement,  internal  audit  development,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.20 All  three  ministries \nhave made gradual improvements in these areas. In addition, the grant has also supported the \nNational  Audit  Authority  to  strengthen  its  capacity  in  audit  of  externally  funded  projects.  The \nNational Audit Authority has been progressively improving external audit scrutiny of government \nexpenditures and revenues, borrowings, and assets. \n \n\n                                                \n18   Economic  and  financial  analysis  were  not  undertaken  for  Stage  2  subprojects  due  to  urgent  repairs  to  restore \nfunctionality  before  the  next  wet  season  to  avoid  further  damage  to  the  undamaged  works.  The  incremental \nreturns  are  expected  to  far  exceed  the  costs,  given  that  without  urgent  repairs  the  structure  would  be  lost \naltogether in the coming rainy season. \n\n19   The average economic internal rate of return for stage 3 subprojects of the original project was 34%. \n20  ADB.  2009.

Three  rural \ndevelopment  ministries:  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries;  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and \nMeteorology; and Ministry of Rural Development. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fProcurement.  The  procurement  assessment,  drawing  on  procurement  diagnostic \n25. \nstudies, indicates limited recent progress. Significant domestically financed procurements occur \nthrough noncompetitive and informal procedures. Even though the Public Procurement Law was \nadopted  in  January  2012  and  the  Anti-Corruption  Law  was  adopted  in  2010,  implementation \nprogress  is  limited  and  the  risk  remains  high.  The  updated  Standard  Operating  Procedures, \nProcurement Manual, and Financial Management Manual for Externally Assisted Projects have \nbeen  applied  to  projects  financed  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners. 21 The  manuals \nconsist of the identification of mitigation measures designed to reduce the risk and improve the \nefficiency  and  effectiveness  of  management  and  administration  of  the  portfolio  of  externally \nassisted projects. \n\n \n26. \nAnticorruption.  The  anticorruption  assessment  identifies  that  the  Public  Finance \nSystem  Law  (2008),  strengthening  the  Penal  Code  for  Corrupt  Offenses  (2009),  and  the  Anti-\nCorruption Law (2010) have been adopted. Institutional work is focusing on early development \nof  the  Anti-Corruption  Unit  provided  under  the  Anti-Corruption  Law.  However,  corruption \nremains  a  major  issue  and  poses  significant  constraints  on  development  effectiveness  in \nCambodia.  ADB  support  to  improve  sector  governance  through  improvement  of  the  financial \nmanagement  and  procurement  systems, \nimplementation  of  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement  plan  at  the  project  level,  and  improved  local  accountability  through  support  for \ndecentralization initiative is expected to further improve the governance environment.  \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nanticorruption measures are described in the PAM. \n \n28. \nComplaints  redress  mechanism.  The  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies \nwill set up grievance redress mechanisms with outreach for all subprojects funded by ADB. The \ngrievance and complaints mechanism will be posted publicly on the project website.   \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nThe 2013 floods exacerbated poverty and vulnerability with a particularly long period of \ninundation  that  seriously  disrupted  livelihoods  and  damaged  infrastructure,  particularly  roads \nand  irrigation.  Damaged  roads  hamper  physical  access  to  markets,  goods,  and  services,  and \ndamaged irrigation hinders agricultural production. In the wake of the 2011 floods, studies found \nthat  a  large  proportion  of  affected  households  had  taken  out  loans  to  cope  with  the  negative \nimpact  of  the  floods,  and  that  loans  were  primarily  taken  to  meet  food  needs.  Poor  and \nvulnerable  families  can  very  easily  get  trapped  in  a  vicious  cycle  of  overindebtedness,  which \nmakes  the  reconstruction  of  damaged  infrastructure  all  the  more  urgent  so  that  productive \nactivities  can  be  resumed  as  soon  as  possible.  Restored  infrastructure  will  have  clear  direct \nbenefits for poor and vulnerable flood-affected rural households. The emergency restoration of \nrural roads has been given the highest priority under the project, since these are rural residents\u2019 \nlifelines. Other direct benefits will come from the construction jobs created and the cash income \nthey generate. \n \n30. \nGender  action  plan.  Rehabilitated  national,  provincial,  and  rural  roads  and  irrigation \nfacilities  will  benefit  women  and men.  To  support  the  reestablishment  of  livelihoods,  a  gender \naction  plan  was  developed  to  ensure  that  the  executing  agency,  implementing  agencies,  and \ncivil  works  contractors  pay  particular  attention  to  the  inclusion  of  local  unskilled  laborers,  and \n\n                                                \n21 Government of Cambodia. 2012. Standard Operating Procedures. Updated Version. Phnom Penh. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fparticularly unskilled women, on reconstruction crews. Women who are able to access income \nfrom construction jobs will be able to contribute to rebuilding their families\u2019 lives. The 2011 ADB \nCountry  Gender  Analysis  highlights that gender disparities in employment  remain extensive in \nCambodia,  primarily  because  of  traditional  attitudes  about  appropriate  occupations for  women \nand  men.22 This  is  particularly  true  in  the  construction  sector,  where  it  is  believed  that  women \neither cannot or do not wish to engage in manual labor. However, women are heavily engaged \nin  manual  labor  in  the  agriculture  sector,  and  social  and  gender  analysis  undertaken  in  the \ncontext  of  rural  road  improvement  projects  confirms  their  willingness  and  availability  for  such \nwork.  The  Ministry  of  Rural  Development\u2019s  Ready  for  Roads  suite  of  training,  monitoring,  and \noutreach  tools,  developed  in  2013,  will  be  used  to  ensure  that  women  are  able  to  access  at \nleast 25% of the unskilled work days created. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n31. \nEnvironment.  The project is deemed category B for environment. Subproject selection \ncriteria  are  formulated  to  avoid  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  An  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  was  prepared  in  2012  and  updated  in  2014,  and \ndisclosed on 3 March 2014 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \ngovernment  laws  and  subdecrees.23 The  EARF  includes  environmental  guidelines  to  mitigate \nimpacts  during  subproject  design  and  implementation.  The  PCMU  and  project  implementation \nunits  (PIUs)  will  use  experience  gained  from  ADB-financed  projects,  and  provide  adequate \ncapacity  to  manage  environmental  impacts  with  consultant  support.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations  and  environmental  management  plans  for  stage  2  subprojects  will  be  prepared \naccording  to  the  EARF  and  will  be  incorporated  into  bidding  and  contract  documents,  with \ninitial  environmental  examinations  and \nmonitoring  by  PIUs.  For  stage  3  subprojects, \nenvironmental  management  plans  will  be  prepared  consistent  with  the  EARF.  Environmental \nreporting to ADB by the PCMU will be semi-annual.  \n \nSocial.  The  project  is  deemed  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C \n32. \nfor indigenous peoples. Subproject selection criteria will minimize land acquisition, resettlement \nimpacts, and social risks.24 Resettlement framework was updated and disclosed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and government laws, regulations, and policies to guide \nplanning and design of subprojects.25 The PCMU and PIUs have gained safeguards monitoring \nexperience  from  the  Flood  Damage  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project,  thereby  ensuring  the \nPIUs  have  the  capability,  with  consultant  support,  to  prepare  resettlement  plans.  Consultation \nwill  be  undertaken  with  subproject  stakeholders  during  implementation  to  ensure  participation \nand disclosure as per resettlement framework section IV, Table 1. Responsibilities are identified \nfor  each  consultation  and  information  disclosure  activity.  The  executing  agency  will  ensure  a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  is  in  place  as  described  in  section  VI  of  the  resettlement \nframework. All consultation activities will be documented in the semi-annual monitoring reports \non  social  safeguards  by  the  external  monitoring  organization  for  ADB.  It  has  been  confirmed \nthat  there  are  no  indigenous  peoples  in  the  subproject  areas  covered  under  the  additional \nfinancing. \n\n                                                \n22  ADB. 2012.

Major  risks  identified  were  in  procurement,  financial  management,  and  perceived \ncorruption.  The  project  will  implement  specific  actions  to  mitigate  major  risks  through  (i) \nsupporting  executing  and  implementing  agencies  to  strengthen  their  capacity  for  procurement \nand  monitoring  contractors\u2019  works,  to  avoid  irregularities  during  bidding;  (ii)  strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  the  implementing  agencies  to  improve  financial  management  and  internal  control; \nand (iii) strictly monitoring and enforcing procurement procedures and contracts, and  improving \ntransparency through advertisements and disclosure of project information on executing agency \nwebsites.  The  complaint  handling  mechanisms  developed  under  the  original  project  will  be \nused. Joint investigation of irregularities will be undertaken by the National Audit Authority and \nADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity. Other risks and mitigating measures are described \nin  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 26  The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nCommunications.  A shared objective of the ADB\u2013government communication strategy \n34. \nis  to  build  public  awareness  and  recognition  of  the  collaboration  and  its  outcomes.27 ADB  and \nthe  government  will  proactively  make  maximum  use  of  well-proven  communication \nmethodologies  for  raising  awareness  of  the  viability  and  credibility  of  the  project,  as  well  as \nother government activities in response to the 2013 floods. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n35. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan and grant documents. \n \nConditions for  effectiveness. The grant agreement will have been duly executed and \n36. \ndelivered and become effective as a condition for the effectiveness of the loan agreement, and \nthe  loan  agreement  will  have  been  duly  executed  and  delivered  and  become  effective  as  a \ncondition  for  the  effectiveness  of  the  grant  agreement,  or  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB \nshall have been made for the fulfillment of those conditions within a period satisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n37. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR48,545,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  additional \nfinancing  of the  Flood  Damage  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project, from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum;  for  a  term  of  40  years, \nincluding a grace period of 10 years; with repayment of principal at 2% per annum for the first \n10  years  after  the  grace  period  and  4%  per  annum  thereafter;  and  such

The changes are mainly due to new \n\ntimelines and cumulative outputs of the additional financing. \n\nb  Baseline data will be surveyed and reported during the start of implementation (May-June 2014). \nc  The  reduction  in  percentage  of  women  from  30%  to 25% is due  to  the  experience  in  the  current  project  whereby \nconstructions are machined based, the works are short and intermittent, and the difficulties faced by women due to \nless than-competitive daily rates for women working in urban areas or in neighboring countries. \n\nd  The  length  of  rural  road  reconstructed  using  additional  financing  is  less  than  that  of  the  current  project  because \napproximately  50  are  paved  with  concrete  pavement.  The  rural  roads  reconstructed  by  the  current  project  used \nlaterite only. \n\nNotes:  \n1.  \u201cCurrent project\u201d refers to the original project with past additional financing (if any). For example, for the second \nadditional  financing,  \u201ccurrent  project\u201d  refers  to  the  original  project  and  the  first  additional  financing.  The  same \nprinciple applies to subsequent additional financing, if any. \n\n2.  \u201cOverall project\u201d refers to the original project with past (if any) and proposed additional financing. For example, for \nthe second additional financing, \u201coverall project\u201d refers to the original project, the first additional financing, and the \nsecond additional financing. The same principle applies to subsequent additional financing, if any. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLoan Agreement \n\nGrant Agreement \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=46009-003-3 \n\nSector Assessment (Summary): Transport and Agriculture and Natural Resources \n\nProject Administration Manual \n\nSummary of Project Performance \n\nContribution to the ADB Results Framework \n\nDevelopment Coordination \n\nCountry Economic Indicators \n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Framework \n\nResettlement Framework \n\nRisk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSupplementary Documents \n\nCambodia Post-Floods Early Recovery Needs Assessment Report \n\nDisaster Risk Management in Cambodia \n\nCommunication Plan \n\nGender Action Plan \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 12 March 2014) \n \n\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n", "riel (KR) \n \n$0.0002 \nKR3,993 \n", "Currency unit \n \nKR1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \nVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leaders \n", "Team members \n", "ADB \nEARF \nkm \nPCMU \nPAM \nPIU \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \nkilometer \nproject coordination and monitoring unit \nproject administration manual \nproject implementation unit \n", "NOTE \n \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars unless otherwise stated. \n \n", "S.
