The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  the\nlonger  term  goals  of  safeguarding  public  health  and  the\nenvironment,  supporting  private-sector  participation  in  waste\nmanagement,  and  increasing  public  awareness  of  responsible\nwaste  management  practices.  The  Project  combines  the  three\nprincipal  thrusts  of  policy  improvement,  capacity  building,  and\ninvestment  in  physical  facilities.  The  project  framework  is  in\nAppendix 1.\n\nThe project outputs will include\n\n(i)      efficient  waste  management  systems  in  Rarotonga  and\nAitutaki, through the construction of new disposal facilities\nfor solid wastes and septic tank sludge on each island;\n(ii)    an  institutionalized  recycling  program  in  Aitutaki,  to\ncomplement what is proposed in Rarotonga, and to reduce\nthe quantity of waste;\n\n(iii)    improved waste collection systems;\n(iv)   an improved institutional framework to allow contracting out\n\nof  waste management services;\n\n(v)     cost recovery systems; and\n(vi)    remediation strategies for existing waste disposal sites.\n\nThe Project\u2019s physical components include\n\n(i)      construction of a fully engineered, environmentally sound,\n\nlandfill site in Rarotonga;\n\n(ii)      construction of a similar landfill site in Aitutaki;\n(iii)    construction  of  septic  tank  sludge  treatment  lagoons\n\nadjacent to each landfill; and\n\n(iv)      supply  of  operating  equipment  for  each  landfill,  and  for\n\nrecycling waste materials in Aitutaki.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n:\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  as  $3.1  million\nequivalent, of which the foreign exchange costs amount to about\n$2.0 million equivalent (about 65 percent).\n\n\fiv\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n:\n\nIn view of the small scale and vulnerability of the Cook Islands\neconomy,  it  is  proposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) finance 70 percent of the cost of the Project with a loan of\n$2.2  million  equivalent  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The\nloan  would  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $0.2\nmillion  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs.

MOW  will  implement  the\nProject.\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\n: Goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.  Three  principal  contracts  will  be\nawarded under ADB\u2019s international shopping procedures. Small\npurchases  of  vehicles,  computers,  and  office  equipment  will  be\nmade  by  direct  purchase  procedures  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to\nensure compatibility with similar equipment already in use in the\nCook Islands.\n\n: Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  A  total  of  11\ninternational,  and  30  person-months  of\nperson-months  of \ndomestic  consulting  services  will  be  required.    An  individual\ndomestic  consultant  will  assist  in  project  management.  An\nindividual  international  waste  systems  engineer  will  assist  in\ncapacity building in waste management.

The estimated population in Rarotonga\nin  2000  was  7,000  people,  or  about  2,570  households.  The\npopulation of Aitutaki was estimated to be 2,000 people in 1999,\nor  440  households.  There  are  around  550  nonresidential\nestablishments  in  Rarotonga,  and  around  60  in  Aitutaki.  The\nbuildings\nincludes \nnonhousehold \n(Government  buildings,  schools,  and  hospitals),  hotels,\nrestaurants,  shops,  and  small  manufacturing  units.  About  10\npercent  of  the  population  of  Rarotonga  are  regarded  as  poor;\nthe proportion of poor beneficiaries in Aitutaki is higher than that\nin Rarotonga.\n\ninstitutional \n\nsector \n\nThe ultimate beneficiaries will be the economy or the community\nat  large.  Improved  solid  waste  management  services  will  be\nconducive  to  further  favorable  developments  in  the  tourism\nsector,  which  is  the  principal  engine  for  local  employment  and\neconomic growth.\n\n\fv\ni\n\fv\ni\ni\n\fv\ni\ni\ni\n\fI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\n\n1.\nloan to the Cook Islands for the Waste Management Project.\n\nI. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nThe  Government  of  the  Cook  Islands  first  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  an  integrated  urban  infrastructure  project  in  1993.  Project\npreparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided for a feasibility study that was completed in\n1995.a Early in 1996 however, ADB became aware that the Government was facing significant\neconomic  and  financial  difficulties,  and  further  processing  of  the  proposed  loan  was  deferred.\nADB  focused  its  operations  on  assisting  the  Government  in  planning  and  implementing\neconomic and fiscal reforms.\n\n3.\nImplementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  reform  program  has  progressed  well.  The\nGovernment  adopted  a  program  of  privatization,  asset  sales,  right-sizing  of  Government,  and\nprivate  sector-led  growth  that  has  stimulated  the  economy.  In  1998,  ADB  assessed  the  debt\nservicing  capacity  of  the  Cook  Islands.  The  principal  finding  was  that  the  country\u2019s  fiscal\nresources  were  extremely  limited,  and  that  it  would  be  necessary  to  restructure  its  high-cost\nloans  and  seek  debt  relief  from  major  creditors.  This  recommendation  provided  the  basis,  in\nSeptember 1998, for a debt restructuring exercise involving four main bilateral sources: France,\nItaly, Nauru and New Zealand. The exercise resulted in major concessions, such as debt write-\noffs, lower interest rates, and extended maturities.\n\nADB\u2019s most recent Country Economic Reportb has indicated that the country\u2019s economic\n4.\nprospects are the brightest that they have been in the past five years. However, the country\u2019s\ndebt  servicing  capacity,  while  improving,  remains  relatively  weak.  For  this  reason,  it  was  the\nconsensus of the parties at the debt restructuring talks that further lending to the Cook Islands in\nthe  medium  term  should  be  on  concessional  terms.  This  view  is  reflected  in  ADB\u2019s  current\ngraduation policy.\n\nEarly in 1998, the Government reaffirmed its request for assistance in developing basic\n5.\nurban infrastructure. In February 1999 ADB approved further project preparatory TA to the take\ninto account changes in demand and Government policies of privatization and asset sales. The\nTA, which is ongoing, includes a feasibility study for a proposed waste management project, a\nfeasibility  study  for  a  proposed  water  supply  and  sanitation  project,  and  assistance  in\nimplementing policy and institutional reforms and in community education.c\n\n6.\nADB\u2019s  1999  Country  Programming  Mission  discussed  with  the  Government  the\npackaging  of  urban  infrastructure  improvements.  The  Government  gave  priority  to  waste\nmanagement improvements, and ADB has programmed a loan for consideration in 2000. A loan\nFact-Finding  Mission  was  fielded  May  1999,  and  a  Preappraisal  Mission  was  fielded  in\nSeptember 1999. However, there were two changes of Government in the Cook Islands during\nthe  latter  part  of  1999.  It  was  not  possible  for  the  Preappraisal  Mission  to  obtain  from  the\ngovernment of the day firm commitments on sector policies or on project implementation issues.\n\n                  \n\na  TA 2070-COO: Integrated Urban Infrastructure Project, for $455,000 approved on 15 March 1994.\nb  Country Economic Review, the Cook Islands, 2000.\nc  TA 3085-COO: Urban Infrastructure Project, for $750,000 approved on 6 October 1998.\n\n\f2\n\nA Tripartite Review Mission for a draft feasibility study for the proposed water supply and\n7.\nsanitation project was fielded in January 2000. The Mission discussed issues pertaining to the\nproposed  Waste  Management  Project.  However,  the  new  Government  was  still,  at  that  time,\nunable to make any commitments on policy and project implementation issues.\n\n8.\nIn  correspondence  between  April  and  June  2000,  the  Government  advised  ADB  that  it\nwas  ready  to  recommence  discussions  on  project-related  issues.    A  Consultation  Mission\nsubsequently  approved  as  an  Appraisal  Mission  was  fielded  on  3-13  July  2000.d  The  Mission\nheld  discussions  with  the  Prime  Minister,  senior  officials,  and  other  stakeholders  and  reached\nunderstanding  on  policy,  institutional,  and  project  implementation  issues.    Subsequently,  the\nGovernment and ADB became aware of public objections to the use of a key site identified for\nthe Project in Rarotonga. The Government instituted a special program of public consultations;\nan  alternative  site  has  been  chosen,  and  public  opinion  is  in  favor  of  starting  project\nimplementation as soon as practicable. The Project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nThe Urban Development Context\n\n9.\nThe  Cook  Islands  comprises  15  small  islands  and  atolls  with  a  total  land  area  of  244\nsquare kilometers (sq km) dispersed over an ocean area of 1.8 million sq km. The capital is at\nAvarua  in  Rarotonga,  the  largest  island,  which  is  only  6  km  in  diameter.  The  islands  are\npredominantly  coastal  entities  and  because  of  their  size,  isolation,  and  vulnerability  of  their\necosystems,  their  biodiversity  is  among  the  most  threatened  in  the  world.  Special  attention  is\nneeded to protect the environment and ensure that development is sustainable.\n\nIn March 2000 the resident population of the Cook Islands was officially estimated to be\n10.\n14,700,  indicating  a  decrease  of  4,500  people  since  June  1996.    A  high  natural  increase  in\npopulation is offset by emigration to New Zealand and Australia. There is considerable internal\nmigration from the smaller islands to Rarotonga, where there is generally full employment. Since\nthe  1960s,  Rarotonga\u2019s  population  has  fluctuated  between  7,000  and  11,500  people.  Current\nGovernment  statistics  put  the  population  at  about  7,000,  indicating  a  significant  decline  from\n11,225  people  in  1996.  The  atoll  of  Aitutaki  is  the  second  most  populous  island  group,  with\nabout 2,000 people.\n\n11.\nThe  Government  recognizes  the  country\u2019s  narrow  resource  base  and  limitations  for\nachieving  economies  of  scale.  Tourism  and  pearl  production  dominate  the  economy.  The\nenvironment is one of the country\u2019s major assets. The climate, topography, and offshore reefs\nand lagoons make the country a popular tourist destination \u2013 more than 70,000 people currently\nvisit the country every year. However, visible signs of increasing environmental pollution caused\nby lack of appropriate waste management arrangements will adversely affect tourism.\n\n12.\nUntil 1996, solid waste management services were financed through the Government\u2019s\nannual  budgetary  allocation.  Water  supply  services  continue  to  be  funded  from  the\nGovernment\u2019s  annual  budgetary  allocations.e  Assets  have  deteriorated  due  to  deferred\nmaintenance, a situation that has been exacerbated by the Government\u2019s necessary budgetary\n\n                  \n\nd The Mission comprised E. Gordon Fox, Senior Project Implementation Specialist, who was assisted by consultants.\ne  Household charges for water supplies, on the basis of annual payments, were levied in the 1960s, but the system\n\nwas  subsequently abandoned.\n\n\f3\n\ncontrol  measures.    Public  utility  services  in  Rarotonga  have  been  provided  by  a  number  of\nagencies.  The  Ministry  of  Works  (MOW)  is  responsible  for  water  supply,  while  sewerage  and\nliquid waste management services are currently left up to householders and private contractors.\nCurrently, the Environmental Service provides solid waste management services, a corporatized\npower  authority  supplies  electricity,  while  a  private  company  operates  the  telecommunication\nservices. In Aitutaki, the Aitutaki Island Council (AIC) provides water supply services.  Currently\nthere  are  no  sewerage  or  solid  waste  management  services  except  for  the  Black  Pearl  Hotel\nwhich has recently introduced a liquid waste treatment plant.\n\n2.\n\nIncome Levels and Poverty\n\n13.\nVisible  signs  of  poverty  or  destitution  in  the  Cook  Islands  are  few.  Communities  in\nRarotonga  are  better-off  than  communities  in  the  outer  islands.  The  population  of  Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki are scattered among several smaller villages and communities. In each community\nthere  is  a  mix  of  income  groups,  and  there  is  a  strong  tradition  of  mutual  support  among\nextended families. Nevertheless, there are low-income households that are vulnerable to rises\nin  the  cost  of  living.  Other  low-income  groups  are  found  among  elderly  people,  single  female\nheads of households, and immigrants from the outer islands who are working in low-paying jobs\nand have no family support. There is evidence that the recent economic and fiscal reforms have\nhad a considerable impact on the population.f\n\n14.\nIn the 1998 Cook Islands Household Income and Expenditure Survey, about 10 percent\nof households in Rarotonga with a monthly income of less than $240 equivalent are considered\npoor.  About  10  percent  of  households  that  have  monthly  incomes  below  $450  equivalent,  but\nhigher than $240 equivalent, fall into the low-income category. Although survey data for Aitutaki\nare not yet available, general view is that the population there have relatively more households\nin the poor or low-income groups.\n\n3.\n\nSolid Waste Management Services\n\n15.\nThe  level  of  private  sector  participation  in  waste  management  in  Rarotonga  is  already\nhigh.  The  Environment  Service  contracts  out  to  a  private  contractor,g  the  collection  of  solid\nwastes from bins placed in public areas (roadsides, beaches, parks, and the like), and also the\ncollection  of  wastes  from  domestic  premises.  The  service  is  financed  from  an  environmental\nlevy that is included in the departure fee charged at Rarotonga\u2019s international airport.h A second\ncontractor  operates  a  purely  private  venture;  collecting  solid  wastes  in  truck-transported  bins\nfrom  commercial  premises,  and  directly  charges  customers  for  the  service.  Both  contractors\ntransport  their  collected  solid  wastes  to  an  existing  landfill  at  Nikao.  The  landowning  family\noperates the Nikao site (which is leased to the Government). Its operation is financed in part by\nthe  Government,  and  in  part  by  tipping  fees  for  wastes  that  are  generated  on  commercial\npremises.  However,  its  operation  is  environmentally  unsound;  compaction  and  covering  of\nwastes  are  not  carried  out  consistently,  and  the  site  has  no  built-in  environmental  protection\n\n                  \n\nf  The  impacts  of  the  reforms  are  documented  in Cook Island Reforms to April 1997 - Social Impact Assessment,\nprepared for New Zealand Official Development Assistance by Croydon Consultants, and in Cook Islands Financial\nManagement  and  Economic  Restructuring  Program  Review:  Social  Impact  Assessment,  Alastair  Wilkinson,\nNovember 1998.\n\ng  The contract, which is subject to annual review and renewal, contains little in the way of performance criteria.\nh  Rarotonga has a resident population of about 7,000 people. However tourism, one of the country\u2019s major economic\nactivities,  currently  brings  in  more  than  73,000  visitors  each  year.  Much  of  the  solid  waste  results  from  activities\nrelated  to  tourism.  The  Government  feels  that  imposition  of  the  environmental  levy  is  a  reasonable  means  of\nrecovering  the  cost  of  waste  management  services  from  visitors,  as  well  as  from  local  residents  many  of  whom\ntravel internationally.\n\n\f4\n\nmeasures.  Despite  the  environmentally  unsound  practice  of  waste  burning,  the  site  is  filling\nrapidly.\n\n16.\nThere  are  no  formal  waste  management  systems  in  the  other  islands;  informal\narrangements  exist  in  several    islands.  Island  councils,  which  have  been  established  on  each\nisland,  are  responsible  for  administration.  The  Office  of  the  Minister  of  Island  Administration\n(OMIA) is the Government\u2019s coordinating agency for island affairs.\n\n17. Waste  collection  and  disposal  services  in  Aitutaki  have  diminished  over  a  period  of\nyears, to the point where no service is currently operating. The situation is much more serious\nthan in Rarotonga. Commercial establishments use pits or trenches, which they themselves dig\non  vacant  land  for  solid  waste  disposal.  Several  pits  are  close  to  the  seashore  and  present  a\nserious  risk  of  polluting  Aitutaki\u2019s  lagoon.  Households  dump  their  wastes  on  any  convenient\nopen ground. Waste burning, an environmentally unsound manner, is common practice in both\nRarotonga and Aitutaki.\n\n4.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\n18.\nThere is evidence that the community is becoming increasingly conscious of the need for\nenvironmentally  sound  waste  management  practices.  In  Aitutaki,  where  there  is  no  central\nwaste  collection  service,  a  number  of  households  attempt  to  bury  or  burn  their  solid  wastes.\nHowever, this activity is limited, and households are dumping wastes in unoccupied land that is\nlargely  out  of  sight.  Rarotonga  has  a  number  of  community  and  private  sector  initiatives  for\nenvironmental protection and recycling of solid wastes.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe Rarotonga Environmental Awareness Programme (REAP), which started in\nJanuary  1998,  provides  containers  in  which  the  public  may  place  aluminum\ncans.  Glass and plastic bottles were purchased and distributed throughout the\nisland by a group of concerned citizens to encourage recycling.\nAn initiative of the Catholic Church Committee for the Environment in crushing\naluminum cans and storing them for future recycling, and in fostering recycling\nactivities  in  the  outer  islands,  was  \u2013  on  the  death  of  its  founder  \u2013  adopted  by\nCook Islands Can Crushers, which is a private company. Sorting and crushing\nare carried out in a building located in the former Ministry of Works depot.\nAnother private venture, Rarotonga Recycling, operated by Cook Islands Steel,\nalso crushes aluminum cans for recycling.\nGlass crushing is carried out by another private company, Multicontractors Ltd.\nThere is limited use of crushed glass as a concrete aggregate.\nThe  Taporoporoanga  Ipukarea  Society  was  established  as  an  all-volunteer,\nenvironmental nongovernment organization. It supported the Global Year of the\nCoral  Reef  program  in  1996  and  is  currently  involved  in  implementing\nenvironmental  awareness  programs.  It  has  adopted  a  program  for  people  to\nutilize biodegradable wrappings, rather than non degradable plastic bags.\nBusinesses  and \nimporters  established  a  Waste  Management  Steering\nCommittee in 1998. A number of importers initiated a Recycling Centre project.\nPrivate  firms  are  now  collaborating  in  a  common  recycling  center,  and  a  pilot\nrecycling  project  for  household  wastes  has  commenced.  New  Zealand  Official\nDevelopment  Assistance  (NZODA)  has  earmarked  funding.  A  pilot  domestic\nwaste segregation project has commenced.\n\n\f5\n\n19.\n\nOther private business initiatives in recycling include\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nwaste oil recovery system at the international oil company\u2019s central fuel depot;\naluminum  offcuts  and  cans  recycling  at  the  local  aluminum  and  steel  products\nmanufacturer, for export and resale; and\nlimited recycling of bottles at the soft drinks factory.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n20.\nThe Government recognizes that the national goal of enjoying the highest quality of life\nconsistent with its people\u2019s aspirations, and in harmony with their culture and environmenti can\nonly  be  attained  through  economic  growth.  Facilitation  of  private  sector-led  growth  and\ninvestment  is  a  key  task,  and  encouraging  private  sector  participation  is  official  Government\npolicy. The Government is looking toward an expanded role for private enterprises to become\n\u201cpartners and providers\u201d of infrastructure and services. Private sector participation offers greater\nefficiency,  which  is  derived  from  management  flexibility,  freedom  of  action,  greater  financial\ndiscipline,  and  adherence  to  market  forces.  The  challenges  ahead  include  private  sector\nparticipation in managing the international airport, Rarotonga\u2019s harbor, electric power supplies,\nwater  distribution,  and  waste  management.  The  Government  is  concentrating  on  providing  an\nenabling environment, the efficient use of resources, and safeguarding public welfare.\n\n21.\nA  number  of  issues  are  being  addressed  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  and\nprovide  improved  waste  management  services  in  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki.    They  include\nimplementing  a  structure  that  will  continue  to  encourage  private  sector  participation,  and\nencouraging  community  support  for  private  sector  involvement.  In  the  outer  islands,  including\nAitutaki,  the  Government  is  planning  to  give  greater  autonomy  to  individual  island  councils.\nSeveral  functions  that  were  at  one  time  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Outer  Islands\nDevelopment (MOID) are being transferred to island councils. MOID has been restructured and\nright-sized as OMIA.\n\n22.\nUnder the Rarotonga Environment Act (1994 - 95), substantial fines can be imposed on\npeople  or  organizations  found  guilty  of  disposing  of  wastes  in  an  environmentally  unsound\nmanner,  whether  in  a  public  place  or  on  private  land.  The  Government  proposes  that  the\nEnvironment  Service  become  a  monitoring  and  regulatory  agency,  and  assist  environmental\ncommittees  that  are  to  be  established  in  the  outer  islands,  including  Aitutaki.  A  new\nEnvironment Bill was introduced in Parliament and is under consideration.\n\n23.\nThe  Government  has  promoted  public  participation  in  planning  new  waste  disposal\nsystems, with assistance from ADB, and further public education and participation programs are\nbeing developed.  In Rarotonga the public is already accustomed to private sector participation\nin solid waste management and has expressed, through consultative processes, a clear desire\nto have the private sector continue providing waste management services.\n\ni  As defined at a national consultative retreat in November 1997.\n\n                  \n\n\f6\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n1.\n\nADB\u2019s Assistance\n\n24.\nADB  has  approved  11  loans  to  the  Cook  Islands.  None  were  specifically  for  the\ndevelopment  of  urban  infrastructure,  but  two  multiproject  loansj  have  included  infrastructure\ncomponents,  including  harbor  works,  wharves  and  rural  roads.  The  first  multiproject  loan\nincluded a drainage and flood control component in Rarotonga. The subproject was successfully\ncompleted  and  has  stood  the  test  of  subsequent  storm  events.  The  second  loan  was  to  have\nincluded a sewerage system for Avarua. At that time, however, the Government was reluctant to\nenact a users-pay policy, which was a precondition of ADB financing. The sewerage component\nwas therefore deleted from the Second Multiproject.\n\n2.\n\nOther Assistance\n\nThe  Government  has  received  assistance  for  developing  urban  services  from  several\n25.\nsources.  Until  the  late  1980s,  New  Zealand  was  the  principal  contributor  to  water  supply  and\nsanitation  development,  particularly  in  Rarotonga.  Assistance  has  also  been  received  from\nAustralia, Britain, Canada, Germany, the United States of America, and other bilateral sources.\nMultilateral  agencies  that  have  provided  assistance  to  the  sector  include  the  South  Pacific\nCommunity,k  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  World  Health  Organization,  and  the\nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund.  More  recently  the  French  Government  financed  the\nrehabilitation  of  water  supplies  and  electrical  power  generation  and  distribution  in  Rarotonga.\nAustralia is financing water supply improvements in Aitutaki. In 1997/98 New Zealand provided\nassistance  to  cover  the  cost  of  machine  hire  and  materials  needed  to  replace  water  supply\ndistribution  pipelines  in  Rarotonga.  New  Zealand  is  also  assisting  the  Environment  Service  to\nrefine  and  implement  its  environmental  impact  assessment  procedures;  this  project  currently\nawaits  the  outcome  of  a  consultative  process  between  the  Environment  Service  and\nnongovernment environment groups. A list of external assistance to the sector is in Appendix 2.\n\n26.\nIn its program for 2000/2001, NZODA has earmarked funds to provide a recycling facility\nin Rarotonga. This follows a private-sector led initiative for recycling used cans, glass, and other\nmaterials. This proposal will support and enhance the provision of waste management facilities\nin Rarotonga.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n1.\n\nThe ADB Experience\n\n27.\nOf  the  10  loans  approved  by  ADB,  project  completion  reports  have  been  prepared  for\neight,  and  two  have  been  postevaluated.  Experience  in  several  projects  has  indicated  that\nproject management assistance, provided as an integral part of the project, has enhanced the\nexecuting  agency\u2019s  implementation  capability.  Such  assistance  has  subsequently  become  an\nintegral part of ADB-financed operations in the Cook Islands.\n\n28.\nThe two ADB-financed multiprojects included significant amounts of civil works. Delays\nin  implementing  the  first  Multiproject  were  caused  by  limited  resources  of  the  several  small\n\nj  Loan 461-COO (SF) Multiproject, for $1.0 million, and Loan 849-COO (SF) Second Multiproject, for $2.75 million\n\n                  \n\napproved on 27 October 1987.\n\nk  Formerly known as the South Pacific Commission.\n\n\f7\n\nimplementing agencies. In retrospect it was felt that a reduced amount of construction work by\nthe (then) Public Works Department would have led to more rapid implementation. The Project\nCompletion  Report  (PCR)  pointed  to  the  need  for  more  realistic  implementation  schedules,  to\ntake into account the smallness of ADB\u2019s Pacific member countries, their limited resources, and\ntheir  geographic  remoteness.  The  Second  Multiproject  ran  into  more  serious  implementation\ndelays, particularly due to delayed release of the counterpart funds required to complete three\nsubprojects.  The  PCR  also  pointed  to  a  lack  of  direction  and  coordination  between  the\nexecuting  agency  and  the  implementing  agencies.  More  recently  the  PCR  for  the  ADB-\nsupported Economic Restructuring Program, which included a very significant downsizing of the\npublic  service,  indicated  that  lack  of  management  continuity  and  structural  changes  are\nimpeding service delivery and project implementation.\n\n2.\n\nOther Projects\n\n29.\nA  French-financed  water  supply  project  that  was  completed  in  Rarotonga  in  the  mid-\n1990s  was  not  accompanied  by  proposed  revenue-generating  measures.  The  project  would\nhave  supplied  and  installed  consumer  water  meters  and  would  have  introduced  consumption-\nbased water charges. However, the particular meters to be provided were rejected by the (then)\nGovernment\u2019s  Department  of  Water  Supply  as  being  difficult  to  read  and  maintain.    A  cost\nrecovery system for water supplies has still not been introduced.\n\n3.\n\nSummary of Lessons Learned\n\na.\n\nPublic Sector Reforms\n\n30.\nThe willingness of the Government to tackle vitally needed economic and fiscal reforms\nunder its ADB-supported economic reform program has been notable. Government departments\nhave  been  downsized,  and  Government  expenditure  has  been  significantly  reduced.  Further\nassistance is required to ensure the maintenance of the reform process, particularly with regard\nto encouraging private sector-led growth and sustainability of appropriate levels of service.\n\nb.\n\nRevenue Generation\n\n31.\nThe  nonadoption  of  revenue-generating  measures  in  urban  infrastructure  projects  \u2013\nnotably in water supply developments \u2013 has resulted in poor sustainability and lies at the heart\nof  problems  of  deferred  maintenance.    The  record  is  somewhat  better  in  respect  of  other\nservices  \u2013  notably  electric  power  supplies  in  Rarotonga,  which  are  operated  on  a  commercial\nbasis \u2013 and the national telecommunications system, which has private sector participation. The\nprincipal lesson learned is to ensure that adequate revenue generation measures are built into\nthe project design.\n\nc.\n\nProject Implementation\n\n32.\nDelays in implementing ADB-financed projects up to 1996 illustrated the limited capacity\nof  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  capacity  limitations  are  due  to  a  lack  of\nprofessional  expertise  and  paucity  of  professional  staff.  Timely  release  of  counterpart  finance\nhas also been a problem. Clearly, there needs to be greater emphasis on support during project\nimplementation.\n\n\f8\n\nd.\n\nAppropriate Technology\n\n33.\nAnother  lesson  that  has  emerged  relates  to  the  selection  of  materials  and  equipment.\nThe country\u2019s climate, which is warm, with high humidity and seawater-laden winds, accelerates\nthe  corrosion  of  mechanical,  electrical,  and  other  susceptible  equipment.  The  country  is  a\nconsiderable  distance  from  the  nearest  source  of  spare  parts.  While  servicing  skills  for  some\nfairly sophisticated equipment are available in Rarotonga, breakdown of critical components can\nput  equipment  out  of  service  for  considerable  periods  of  time  while  replacement  parts  are\nlocated, ordered, and delivered. To minimize the need to carry large inventories of spare parts,\nwhich may be subject to deterioration in storage, technology should be robust and appropriate\nto the local environment.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n34.\nADB\u2019s sector strategy fits within ADB\u2019s country operational strategy. ADB will continue to\nsupport,  and  help  to  reinforce  and  consolidate  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s\neconomic  reform  program.  In  particular,  ADB  will  support  the  achievement  of  macroeconomic\nstability;  ensure  structural  reforms,  with  private  sector-led  economic  recovery;  and  enhance\nequity and community participation. The maintenance of fiscal balance, restoration of business\nconfidence,  and  development  of  systems  for  sound  financial  and  economic  management  are\nkey  policy  issues.  ADB  is  assisting  in  developing  urban  infrastructure  to  support  the\nGovernment\u2019s  private  sector-led  growth  strategy.    The  development  of  urban  infrastructure\nincludes  strong  emphasis  on  private  sector  participation,  and  on  appropriate  institutional\nframeworks that will enhance ADB\u2019s support of improved governance.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n35.\nDialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB  is  continuing  on  several  sector  policy\nissues,  particularly  with  regard  to  (i)  establishing  an  appropriate  institutional  framework  for\neffective  operation  of  waste  management  services,  (ii)  private  sector  and  community\nparticipation  in  providing  solid  waste  management  services  and  (iii)  cost  recovery.  The\ninstitutional  framework  will  provide  for  performance,  economic,  and  environmental  regulation.\nThe  dialogue  is  focusing  in  particular  on  issues  pertaining  to  the  sustainability  of  appropriate\nlevels  of  service  and  the  reduction  of  direct  Government  involvement.    The  Government  is\nimplementing an Institutional and Policy Action Plan (Appendix 3).\n\n1.\n\nInstitutional Framework\n\nThe  Government  is  establishing,  with  ADB  assistance,l  the  following  institutional\n36.\nframework to ensure the sustainability of solid waste management facilities. In Rarotonga MOW\nwill be responsible for managing solid waste services. It will then contract out or franchise utility\nasset management and operations to the private sector and set performance targets.  In Aitutaki\nAICm  will  be  responsible  for  waste  management  services.    It  will  contract  out  the  operation  of\nwaste management services to the private sector, and also set performance targets.\n\n                  \n\nl ADB\u2019s assistance is being provided through TA 3085-COO: Urban Infrastructure Project  (Footnote 3).\nm  AIC  is  an  elected  body  that  has  the  power  of  passing  and  administering  ordinances  and  bylaws,  coordinating\neconomic and social development activities, assisting the Government in governance, and advising in disputes. It\nmay impose tolls, due fees and fines; control a number of activities, including waste disposal practices; and license\ninformal traders.\n\n\f9\n\n2.\n\nPrivate Sector Participation\n\n37.\n\nSeveral forms of private sector participation are appropriate in solid waste management.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nContracting.    The  Government  awards  term  contracts  to  private  companies  to\nundertake one or more functions such as collecting waste or operating disposal sites;\nConcessions.  The Government awards a concession to a private company to carry\nout  a  full  waste  management  process  that  may  include  collection,  recycling,  and\ndisposal.  The  private  firm  builds  the  facility,  operates  it,  and  may  transfer  it  to  the\nGovernment after some years of operation.\nFranchising. The Government awards an area monopoly to a private firm to deliver a\nsolid waste management service for a specific time period (the private firm recovers\nits cost and profit through user charges).\nOpen  competition.  The  Government  allows  qualified  private  firms  to  compete  for\nwaste management services. No firm holds an area monopoly and any number can\ncompete for the same area. The firms directly bill their customers.\n\n38.\nIn Rarotonga, a contracting system is already in place and the public is accustomed to\nprivate sector participation in providing waste management services. The Government proposes\nto  continue  this  form  of  private  sector  participation.  In  Aitutaki,  where  there  is  no  solid  waste\nmanagement  system  in  operation  at  present,  contracting  out  the  operation  of  solid  waste\nmanagement services is seen as the best option.\n\n3.\n\nRegulatory Framework\n\n39.\nThe  Government  has  proposed  a  regulatory  framework  for  solid  waste  management\nservices  on  two  islands.    In  Rarotonga    (i)  MOW  will  undertake  performance  regulation  in\nmanaging the operating contracts; (ii) the MFEM in consultation with MOW, will review charges,\nfees, and expenditures;  (iii) the Environment Service will be responsible for waste management\npolicy  and  education  and  awareness;  and  (iv)  the  Environment  Service  will  be  responsible  for\nenvironmental regulation.  In Aitutaki (i) AIC will undertake performance regulation in managing\nthe  operating  contracts;    (ii)  MFEM,  in  consultation  with  AIC,  will  review  charges,  fees,  and\nexpenditures; and (iii) the Environmental Committee, supported by the Environment Service, will\nbe responsible for environmental monitoring.\n\n4.\n\nCost Recovery\n\n40.\n\nThe key financial objectives are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(i)\n(ii)\n\ndevelop  financially  sustainable  solid  waste  management  services  in  Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki;\nreduce  Government\u2019s  direct  involvement  in  financing  solid  waste  management\nservices;\nimprove the levels of cost recovery from users of public utilities; and\nset charges that are affordable to lower income groups.\n\n41.\n\nA combination of four methods of cost recovery will be utilized:\n\ncontinuing direct charges from commercial and other establishments;\ncollecting  direct  charges  or  tipping  fees  at  waste  disposal  sites  for  wastes  from\npeople who transport wastes privately to the landfills;\n\n\f10\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\ncontinuing contributions from the environmental levy part of the departure tax at\nthe international airport, to ensure financial contributions from tourists; and\nintroducing  direct  household  charges  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery,  following  a\nreview  of  the  financial  position  of  waste  management  services,  one  year  after\ncompletion of the new waste management facilities.\n\n5.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\nConsultations  with  stakeholders,  which  commenced  during  the  project  feasibility  study,\n42.\nare  continuing.  The  public  is  becoming  aware  that  user  charges  are  likely  to  be  introduced  to\ncover  the  cost  of  urban  services.  This  is  a  significant  issue;  the  public,  over  a  long  period  of\ntime,  has  come  to  regard  the  provision  of  basic  urban  services  as  being  \u201cfree.\u201d    Public\nconsultation and education programs have been incorporated into the Project, and will continue\nafter project implementation through the activities of the Environment Service, MOW, and AIC.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n43.\nRarotonga\u2019s  present  waste  management  system  is  overloaded,  is  damaging  the\nenvironment, and presents health hazards. Storm water that runs off the existing waste disposal\nsites is polluting surface streams and groundwater.  The capacity of the present landfill is almost\nexhausted, despite recourse to the environmentally unsound practice of burning the wastes in\nsitu  at  the  landfill.  Aitutaki  has  no  waste  management  facility  at  all,  and  wastes  are  being\ndumped or burned with no control.\n\n44.\nThe principal thrust of the Project is to halt and reverse the environmental degradation\ncaused  by  inadequate  solid  waste  management  practices  in  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki.  The\nProject  will  also  provide  facilities  that  will  significantly  enhance  public  health  protection.  The\nfuture of tourism, which is one of the country\u2019s principal economic activities, depends to a large\nextent on the conservation of the country\u2019s natural environment.\n\nThe  Project  will  help  the  Government  improve  the  efficiency  of  urban  services  through\n45.\ninstitutional  reform,  and  will  consolidate  systems  for  recovering  the  costs  of  providing  waste\nmanagement  services.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  maximizing  private\nsector-led  growth,  through  a  thrust  toward  private  sector  participation  in  providing  solid  waste\nmanagement services. The Project will also help to underpin the development of tourism. The\nproject will serve the entire island of Rarotonga and the atoll of Aitutaki.\n\nB. \n\nObjective and Scope\n\n46.\nThe  principal  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  facilitate  sustainable  and  appropriate  waste\nmanagement practices in Rarotonga and Aitutaki. The Project will contribute to the achievement\nof the longer term goals of safeguarding public health and the environment, supporting private-\nsector  participation  in  waste  management,  and  increasing  public  awareness  of  responsible\nwaste  management  practices.  The  Project  combines  the  three  principal  thrusts  of  policy\nimprovement, capacity building, and investment in physical facilities.\n\n\f47.\n\nThe project outputs will include\n\n11\n\n(i) \n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nefficient  waste  management  systems  in  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  through  the\nconstruction of new disposal facilities for solid wastes and septic tank sludge on\neach island;\na recycling program institutionalized in Aitutaki to complement proposals in\nRarotonga, and  to reduce the quantity of waste;\nimproved waste collection systems;\nan improved institutional framework to enable waste management services to be\ncontracted out;\ncost recovery systems; and\nremediation strategies for existing waste disposal sites.\n\n48.\nThe physical works include (i) construction of a fully engineered, environmentally sound\nlandfill site in Rarotonga; (ii) construction of a similar landfill site in Aitutaki; (iii) construction of\nseptic  tank  sludge  treatment  lagoons  adjacent  to  each  landfill;  and  (iv)  supply  of  operating\nequipment  for  each  landfill,  and  for  recycling  waste  materials  in  Aitutaki.  The  services  of\nconsultants  will  be  required  to  assist  in  project  management,  and  to  carry  out  detailed  design\nservices,  construction  supervision,  training  in  solid  waste  management,  and  in  establishing\ntechnical  standards  for  operating  and  monitoring  solid  waste  management  facilities  and\nservices.\n\nC. \n\nTechnical Justification\n\nImmediate  improvements  to  waste  management  practices  are  required  in  both\n49.\nRarotonga  and  Aitutaki.  The  waste  stream  amounts  to  about  1,450  tons  each  year  in\nRarotonga, and about 200 tons each year in Aitutaki. Future waste generation will be influenced\nby  population  growth  and  tourism  development,  and  it  is  possible  that  changes  in  lifestyle  will\nlead to increased waste generation. It is also possible that current trends toward recovery and\nrecycling  of  waste  materials  will  reduce  the  volume  of  waste  generated  per  capita.  Waste\nmanagement methods must therefore be reasonably flexible to meet possible future changes in\nthe nature and quantity of wastes.\n\n50.\n\nThe following methodologies of waste disposal have been considered:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v)\n\nlandfilling\u2013environmentally  controlled  disposal  of  wastes  within  a  specially\ncontrolled site;\nIncineration\u2013burning  wastes  at  high  temperatures,  in  environmentally  controlled\nconditions, to reduce their volume;\nocean dumping\u2013transporting wastes to sea for dumping in deep ocean waters;\n\u201cwaste-to-energy\u201d  systems\u2013heat  from  incineration  is  utilized  to  generate  electric\npower; and\n\u201clong  haul\u201d  methods\u2013wastes  are  transported  to  remote,  offshore,  disposal\nfacilities.\n\n51.\nOf the above, ocean dumping is environmentally unacceptable and would violate current\nlegislation  in  the  Cook  Islands.  \u201cWaste-to-energy\u201d  systems  require  larger  waste  streams  than\nare generated in Rarotonga and Aitutaki. \u201cLong haul\u201d methods require a disposal site within the\nreception country and there is considerable social, environmental, legal, and political opposition\nto transporting wastes across international waters.\n\n\f12\n\nThe  options  that  have  been  included  in  a  least  cost  analysis  have  therefore  included\n52.\nincineration  and  landfilling.  Analysis  has  indicated  that  landfilling  is  the  most  economic  option,\nand its level of technology renders it the most suitable choice for the Cook Islands. Wastes will\nbe compacted and buried in a specially engineered site. The site will be lined with impervious\nmaterial,  and  the  compacted  wastes  will  be  covered  with  soil,  to  prevent  environmental\ncontamination. Leachaten control systems will be incorporated into landfill design.\n\n53.\nAs an adjunct to landfilling, the segregation of waste materials at source, with recycling\nof  materials  such  as  cans  and  crushed  glass  to  reduce  the  overall  volume  of  the  wastes,  will\nsignificantly extend the life of the landfill. The Project will include equipment for crushing these\nwastes,  and  will  incorporate  a  public  education  program  to  encourage  the  public  to  segregate\nwastes prior to collection.\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n54.\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated as $3.1 million equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange  cost  is  $2.0  million  (about  65  percent),  including  $0.1  million  for  interest  during\nconstruction  on  ADB\u2019s  loan.  A  summary  of  the  cost  estimates  is  in  Table  1.

MOW will implement the Project. A steering\ncommittee (SC), which includes the Financial Secretary and the Secretary of MOW, has been\nestablished under the chairmanship of the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (who is\nthe chair of ACC) to oversee and coordinate all project activities. The SC will ensure appropriate\nliaison  among  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation.  The  private  sector,  traditional\nleaders,  and  the  Environment  Service  are  represented  on  the  SC.  The  mayor  of  Aitutaki  will\nrepresent  AIC.    A  subcommittee  of  SC,  comprising  the  Secretary  of  MOW,  the  Financial\nSecretary, and the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister \u2018s Office will oversee and coordinate all\nproject  activities,  and  ensure  appropriate  liaison  amongst  the  agencies  involved  in  project\nimplementation.\n\n58.\nA Project Management Unit (PMU) headed by a project manager, who is a member of\nMOW\u2019s  staff,  has  been  established  in  MOW.  A  local  project  management  consultant  and  an\ninternational consultant waste systems engineer will assist the project manager. An engineering\nconsulting  team  that  will  carry  out  design,  procurement,  construction,  commissioning,  and\ntraining  functions  will  report  to  the  project  manager.  A  small  group  of  secretarial  and  support\nstaff  will  be  included  in  the  PMU.  Further  details  of  the  project  implementation  arrangements,\ntogether with organization charts, are in Appendix 5.\n\n2.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n59.\nIn  Rarotonga,  MOW  will  manage  the  waste  management  assets.  MOW  will  award\ncontracts  for  waste  collection  services  and  managing  the  Rarotonga  landfill  site,  after  setting\nappropriate  performance  targets.  In  Aitutaki,  AIC  will  award  contracts  for  waste  collection\nservices  and  for  managing  the  landfill  site,  again  setting  appropriate  performance  targets.\nProject assets will be handed over to AIC at the conclusion of project implementation.\n\nMOW  and  AIC  will  undertake  performance  regulation  through  their  roles  in  managing\n60.\ncontracts  for  waste  collection  and  landfill  management.  As  there  is  no  expertise  for  operating\nsolid  waste  management  systems  in  the  Cook  Islands,  consultants  engaged  under  the  Urban\nInfrastructure  Project  (footnote  3)  have  assisted  in  building  MOW\u2019s  capacity  in  waste\nin  preparing  waste\nmanagement.  Consultants  engaged  under \n\nthe  Project  will  assist \n\n\f14\n\nmanagement operating contracts, training landfill operators, and establishing appropriate waste\nmanagement practices and performance targets.\n\n61.\nIn Rarotonga, the Environment Service will be responsible for environmental regulation.\nIn Aitutaki, a specially appointed environment committee, with assistance from the Environment\nService,  will  carry  out  environmental  monitoring  of  waste  management  operations.  Again,\nconsultants  engaged  under  the  Project  will  assist  in  developing  environmental  monitoring\nexpertise for waste management operations in both Rarotonga and Aitutaki.\n\n3.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\n62.\nConsultations with beneficiaries, which have been an important component of the project\nfeasibility  study,  will  continue  during  and  after  project  implementation.  The  public  is  becoming\naware  that  user  charges  are  likely  to  be  introduced  to  cover  the  cost  of  urban  services.  The\nGovernment will continue public consultation and education during project implementation, and\nwill continue doing so after project implementation through the activities of the district councils in\nRarotonga and AIC in Aitutaki.\n\n4.\n\nProcurement\n\nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\n63.\nProcurement. Two contracts will be awarded under ADB\u2019s international shopping (IS) procedure\nfor  constructing  new  solid  waste  landfills  in  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki.  These  contracts  are\nestimated  to  cost  $1.0  million  equivalent  and  $0.2  million  equivalent,  respectively.  A  third\ncontract, estimated to cost $0.4 million equivalent, for the supply of operating equipment for the\nlandfills,  including  waste  collection  vehicles,  compactors,  and  waste  presses,  will  also  be\nawarded under ADB\u2019s IS procedure.\n\nUtility  and  service  vehicles,  computers,  photocopiers,  and  office  equipment  will  be\n64.\nprocured by direct purchase procedures acceptable to ADB, to ensure compatibility with similar\nvehicles and equipment currently in local use. A light utility vehicle, computers, photocopier, and\noffice equipment will be utilized by the PMU during project implementation, and will be handed\nover for general use by MOW and AIC afterwards.\n\n65.\nFor  contracts  under  IS  procedure  (i)  written  invitations  to  bid,  setting  out  the  technical\nspecifications and terms and conditions of the contract, will be issued: (ii) a notice inviting bids\nwill be advertised in an English language newspaper; and (iii) procedures of public bid opening\nwill be adopted; only such publicly opened bids will be evaluated. Invitations to bid will be from\nmore than one eligible source country. ADB will review the tendering procedures after the award\nof  contracts,  but  before  disbursement  is  authorized.  The  proposed  procurement  packages  are\nsummarized in Appendix 6.\n\n5.\n\nCapacity Building and Consulting Services\n\nConsulting  services  will  be  used  to  assist  in  project  management,  detailed  design  and\n66.\nconstruction supervision, and building local expertise in solid waste management. To enhance\nthe capacity of the Implementing Agency, an experienced domestic consultant will be engaged\nfor about 16 months to assist the project manager. This consultant will assist in the day-to-day\nrunning of the PMU, maintaining project records, preparing progress reports, and ensuring that\nproject  accounts  are  maintained  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB  and  the\nGovernment.\n\n\f15\n\nAn  international  consultant  waste  systems  engineer  will  be  engaged  for  about  three\n67.\nmonths  to  assist  the  project  manager  formulating  technical  and  performance  standards  for\nincorporation  into  contracts  for  operating  waste  management  facilities,  and  in  developing\nstandard  procedures  for  operating  and  monitoring  landfills.  The  waste  systems  engineer  will\nalso  assist  in  establishing  systems  of  identifying,  storing,  and  managing  intractable  and\nhazardous wastes; preparing remediation strategies for existing dump sites; and assessing the\nongoing pilot domestic waste segregation project.\n\ninternational  consultants  and  14  person-months \n\nEngineering  services,  including  site  investigations,  survey,  detailed  design,  contract\n68.\ndocumentation and tender evaluation, and supervision require about 8 person-months of input\nfrom \nfrom  domestic  consultants.  An\ninternational consulting firm, which will engage suitable domestic consultants, will provide these\nservices.  The  firm  will  provide  the  services  of  international  specialists  in  civil  works  design,\nhydrology, and civil works construction supervision. Domestic consultants engaged by the firm\nwill  support  design  and  construction  supervision,  and  will  carry  out  topographic  survey  work.\nThe  firm  will  provide  local  waste  management  personnel  with  training,  appropriate  to  the\nfacilities developed under the Project.\n\nThe  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\n69.\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are given in Appendix 7.\n\n6.\n\nAdvance Action\n\nADB has approved advance action and retroactive financing to expedite the recruitment\n70.\nof  the  domestic  consultant  who  will  assist  the  project  manager.    A  contract  with  the  project\nmanagement  consultant  will  be  negotiated  shortly.  Contracts  with  other  consultants  will  be\nentered  into  as  soon  as  the  loan  becomes  effective.  MOW  is  preparing  a  shortlist  of\ninternational  engineering  consulting  firms,  and  technical  proposals  will  be  requested  and\nevaluated,  to  enable  consulting  contracts  to  be  entered  into  as  soon  as  the  loan  becomes\neffective.\n\n71.\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement\nHandbook. ADB\u2019s direct payment procedures will be utilized for paying consultants, civil works\ncontractors, and supply of equipment.  Small items of services or equipment, valued at less than\n$50,000  equivalent,  will  be  reimbursed  through  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)\nprocedures.\n\n7.\n\nDisbursements\n\n8.\n\nImprest Fund\n\n72.\nAn  imprest  fund  account,  in  US  dollars,  will  be  established  at  a  reputable  commercial\nbank  by  MFEM  for  the  exclusive  use  of  the  Project.  On  receipt  and  approval  of  an  initial\nwithdrawal application, ADB will advance $100,000 to cover purchase of equipment and other\nexpenses  to  be  incurred  in  the  first  six  months  of  project  implementation.  As  eligible\nexpenditures are incurred and paid from the account, MFEM will request the replenishment of\nthe account, supported by the appropriate documentation. For items costing less than $50,000\nunder any one contract, SOE procedures may be utilized to replenish and liquidate the imprest\nfund account.\n\n\f16\n\n9.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n73.\nA  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  carried  out  after  detailed  design  has  been\ncompleted  and  major  contracts  have  been  awarded.  The  review  is  envisaged  to  take  place\nabout  eight  months  after  loan  effectiveness,  although  the  exact  timing  of  the  review  will  be\ndetermined  during  the  course  of  periodic  reviews  and  consultation  with  the  Government.  The\nmidterm  review  will  (i)  critically  examine  and  evaluate \nthe  Project,\nimplementation  procedures,  procurement,  project  performance  monitoring  activities,\nconsultants\u2019  performance,  community  participation  activities,  and  implementation  of  policy  and\ninstitutional  developments,  and  (ii)  formulate  measures  to  remedy  weaknesses  to  ensure\nachievement of project objectives.\n\nthe  progress  of \n\n10.\n\nLand Acquisition\n\n74.\nFor  landfill  sites,  about  1.8  hectares  (ha)  is  required  in  Rarotonga  and  about  1.0  ha  in\nAitutaki.  The  sites  have  been  identified,  and  agreements  have  been  entered  into  with\nlandowners.  The  agreements  will  become  effective  when  a  new  Environment  Act,  which  will\nrestrict the dumping of wastes on other lands, has been enacted, and when the Government\u2019s\nenvironmental impact procedures have been complied with during detailed project design.\n\n11.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n75.\nIt is proposed that the Project be completed over months. Detailed design is expected to\ncommence  in  November  2001,  to  permit  the  start  of  construction  in  Rarotonga  in  September\n2002.  Construction  in  Aitutaki  will  commence  in  March  2003.  The  completion  of  all  works  and\ncommissioning  are  expected  by  August  2003.  The  proposed  implementation  schedule  is  in\nAppendix 8.\n\n12.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n76.\nMOW  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Project,  and  will  have  the\naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.\nMOW will submit to ADB copies of the audited accounts and financial statements, together with\nthe  report  of  the  auditors,  not  later  than  nine  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  to  which\nthey  relate.  The  annual  audit  will  include  the  audit  of  the  Imprest  Account  and  SOE  and  a\nseparate audit opinion on the use of the Imprest Account and SOE will be included in the annual\naudit report.\n\n77.\nMOW  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation.  Within\nthree months of the physical completion of the Project, MOW will provide ADB with a report on\nproject  completion  and  the  initial  operation  of  the  project  facilities,  including  the  project  costs\nand compliance with the loan covenants.\n\n13.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring\n\n78.\nTo ensure that the Project is managed efficiently and that its benefits are maximized, a\npreliminary project performance monitoring system (PPMS) has been developed. The Executing\nAgency and ADB will use the PPMS during project implementation. The PPMS is based on the\nmeasurable outputs and impacts identified in the project framework.\n\n79.\nUnder  the  PPMS,  MOW  and  AIC  will  collect  records  of  waste  volumes,  cost  recovery,\nand other factors set out in Appendix 9. The project benefits will be evaluated after completion.\n\n\f17\n\nThe  PPMS  will  assist  MOW  and  AIC  in  the  ongoing  monitoring  of  waste  management\noperations after completion of construction.\n\nG. \n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n80.\nMFEM, the Executing Agency, was established by the Ministry of Finance and Economic\nManagement  Act  (1995-96),  and  is  charged  with  the  administration  of  economic,  fiscal,  and\nfinancial  management  of  the  Government.  In  its  role  of  managing  and  coordinating  externally\nfinanced assistance programs, MFEM, in conjunction with the Aid Coordinating Committee, will\ncoordinate  and  direct  the  Project.  MFEM  has  been  the  Executing  Agency  for  several  ADB-\nfinanced projects and TA operations, and is familiar with ADB\u2019s procedures and requirements.\n\nMOW,  which  will  implement  the  Project,  was  originally  established  by  the  Ministry  of\n81.\nSupportive Services Act (1974). Its functions made the Ministry the Government\u2019s construction,\nbuilding, and furniture-making arm; its water supply entity; the transport service for government\nvehicles; and its printing press. Over time its core functions have changed with the privatization\nof some services, the transfer of functions to others \u2013 particularly those for the outer islands \u2013\nand its amalgamation with other ministries of state. Its current establishment originates from two\nacts: the Public Service Act, 1995-96 including the Public Service (Identification of Departments)\nOrder 1996, and the Energy Act of 1998 that created the Energy Division within the Ministry.\n\nMOW has a total staff of 51 persons, and is headed by a Secretaryo who reports directly\n82.\nto  the  Minister.  During  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  economic  and  fiscal  reforms,  the\nMinistry was reduced by about 400 persons. While its aim is to become a regulatory agency for\npublic  works,  MOW  retains  some  engineering  functions  including  the  construction  and\nmaintenance of roads, bridges, and coastal protection works. It is also responsible for O&M of\nRarotonga\u2019s  water  supply  system.  Capital  expenditure  budget  and  operating  budget  in  FY\n1998/99  were  about  $1.5  million  and  $1.0  million  equivalent,  respectively.  MOW  collects\nrevenues from services provided. Organization charts for MFEM and MOW are in Appendix 10.\n\nH. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\n83.\nThe  proposed  locations  of  the  new  solid  waste  landfill  sites  in  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki\nhave  been  thoroughly  assessed.  In  Rarotonga  a  three-stage  process  of  site  selection  was\nadopted.    In  the  initial  phase,  documents  and  plans  were  reviewed  and  islandwide\nreconnaissance  was  carried  out.    A  total  of  23  potential  sites  were  identified;  each  was\nassessed and ranked on the basis of 21 factors for landfill development. The factors evaluated\nincluded effect on natural habitats, impact on watersheds, and loss of land use resource, as well\nas visual impact, shape, accessibility, and distance from populated areas. Land acquisition for\nthe  top  ranked  sites  was  then  assessed.  Of  all  the  evaluated  sites,  a  site  in  a  steep-sided,\nenclosed  valley  that  has  already  been  affected  by  quarrying  best  met  both  environmental  and\nengineering requirements. Site selection in Aitutaki followed a similar screening process.\n\n84.\nBoth  sites  had  previously  been  subject  to  disturbance.  The  Rarotonga  site  has  been\nsubstantially altered by quarry operations. Native forest has been removed; existing vegetation\nis limited to common grasses, bushes, and a few coconut palms. The Aitutaki site has also been\nsubject to disturbance; native forest has been cleared for agricultural development but the site is\nnot currently used for agricultural purposes.\n\no  The Secretary is a permanent Government official.\n\n                  \n\n\f18\n\n85.\nThe  operation  of  landfills  and  septic  sludge  treatment  lagoons  in  both  Rarotonga  and\nAitutaki has the potential to pollute groundwater and surface water due to discharge of leachate\nand  lagoon  effluent.  Both  landfills  will  have  two-layer  lining  systems,  with  a  lining  of  synthetic\nmaterial overlying a layer of compacted clay. Both landfills will have leachate collection systems,\nand  leachate  will  be  recirculated  through  the  landfills.  The  residual  leachate  will  be  treated  in\nrecirculating  sand  filters,  and  the  treated  leachate  will  be  disposed  of  in  the  ground  through\nshallow underground irrigation systems. The sludge lagoons will also be lined, and effluent will\nbe  treated  and  disposed  of  in  the  same  manner  as  landfill  leachate.  In  Rarotonga,  the  design\nincludes the rerouting of an intermittent drainage stream away from the landfill operations.\n\n86.\nHilly  ridges  that  surround  the  Rarotonga  site  provide  natural  screening,  and  lush\nvegetation that surrounds the Aitutaki site provides a natural buffer to the site\u2019s use as a waste\nmanagement  area.  The  nearest  residential  building  to  the  Rarotonga  site  is  a  prison,  which  is\nabout 400 m from the site but shielded from it by a hillside; a hospital is also screened by a high\nhill.  The  nearest  houses  are  about  800  m  from  the  site.  Capacity  building  in  the  operation,\nmonitoring, and management of landfills is included in the Project. The landfills will be operated\non  a  \u201ccell\u201d  system,  i.e.  wastes  are  compacted  and  covered  each  day.  This  will  provide  the\nprimary  protection  system  against  potential  nuisances  that  may  stem  from  odors  and  insects.\nThe landfills will also be equipped with pipe systems for collecting and venting gases that will be\ngenerated by the decomposition of wastes. These gases, which contain a significant proportion\nof methane, often cause the persistent fires in landfills.\n\n87.\nConstruction  operations  are  likely  to  generate  some  transient  environmental  intrusions.\nConstruction practices that will minimize the danger of soil erosion and potential nuisances from\ndust and noise will be adopted even though the sites provide a high degree of screening from\nthese  hazards.  Road  traffic  densities  will  increase  as  a  result  of  construction  and  operating\nactivities.  The  access  road  to  the  Rarotonga  site  will  be  diverted  away  from  nearby  houses.\nOtherwise,  roads  close  to  the  site  do  not  pass  through  significant  settlements.  Road  traffic\ndensities will be monitored and regulated.\n\n88. With  the  proposed  standards  of  engineering  design  and  operation,  the  negative\nenvironmental impacts of the Project will be minimal and will be far outweighed by the Project\u2019s\nenvironmental  benefits.  An  IEE  was  carried  out  and  a  summary  initial  environmental\nexamination was prepared.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Analysis\n\n89.\nConsumer surveys and public consultation have featured prominently in the conceptual\ndesign  of  the  Project.  The  Project  will  be  of  benefit  to  the  entire  population  of  the  two  most\npopulous  islands  in  the  Cook  Islands  group.  It  will  also  benefit  the  substantial  numbers  of\ntourists  who  visit  the  islands.  Surveys  and  consultations  covered  about  10  percent  of  the\npopulation  of  each  island;  special  consultative  groups  of  consumers  were  established  and\nconsulted on all facets of the Project.\n\n90.\nThe  populations  of  both  islands  are  scattered  among  several  villages  and  small\ncommunities.  Each  community  has  a  mix  of  income  groups.  As  there  are  few  immediately\nevident  signs  of  poverty,  it  is  difficult  to  identify  distinct  groups  of  low-income  households.\nNevertheless,  studies  have  shown  that  the  recent  economic  and  fiscal  reforms  have  had  a\nconsiderable impact on the population. There is also a strong tradition of mutual support within\nfamilies.  However,  some  low-income  groups  are  vulnerable,  notably  the  elderly,  who  are  left\nwith  little  support  when  younger  family  members  leave  to  seek  employment  overseas;  single\n\n\f19\n\nfemale  heads  of  households;  and  immigrants  from  outer  islands,  who  work  in  low-paying  jobs\nand have no family support.\n\n91.\nConsultations  have  indicated  that  a  significant  proportion  of  the  general  public  are\nreasonably aware of solid waste management issues. Many residents of Rarotonga feel that the\ncurrent  collection  system  meets  their  needs  \u2013  solid  wastes  are  collected  once  a  week,  but\npeople are not really aware of where the waste is taken. Most households have a waste bin of\nsome  sort.  Those  that  do  not  have  a  bin  or  receptacle  share  their  neighbors\u2019.  Recycling  of\naluminum  cans  and  glass  bottles  commenced  on  7  April  2001  with  plastics  and  papers  to  be\nreduced in the next phase. While casual dumping of wastes occurs, in localities where it is not\nreadily visible earlier public awareness programs have made some impact. Many people know\nof the potential benefits of waste reduction and recycling. The need to pay for essential public\nservices has limited acceptance.\n\n92.\nIn  Cook  Islands  society,  women  are  involved  in  formal  channels  of  consultation  and  in\ndeveloping  their  own  voice.  They  are  involved  in  traditional  society  structures  as  chiefs  and\ncommunity leaders. Within households, there is no apparent division of labor over the matter of\ndealing  with  household  solid  wastes.  Men,  women,  and  children  may  carry  wastes  to  the\ndisposal bin.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1. \n\nProject Beneficiaries\n\n93.\nThe  project  beneficiaries  are  the  households  and  nonresidential  establishments  in\nRarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  which  generate  solid  wastes.  In  1999  the  estimated  populations  were\n7,000 people, or about 2,570 households in Rarotonga and 2,000 people, or 440 households in\nAitutaki.  There  are  around  550  nonresidential  establishments  in  Rarotonga,  and  around  60  in\nAitutaki.  The  nonhousehold  sector  includes  institutional  buildings  (including  Government\nbuildings, schools, and hospitals), hotels, restaurants, shops, and small manufacturing units.\n\n94.\nThe  ultimate  beneficiaries  will  be  the  economy  or  community  at  large.  Improved  solid\nwaste management services will be conducive to further favorable developments in the tourism\nsector, which is the principal engine for local employment and economic growth.\n\n2. \n\nLeast Cost Analysis\n\n95.\nEconomic  least  cost  analysis  was  carried  out  on  two  levels.  First,  the  overall\nmethodology of waste management was considered. Assessed techniques included disposal in\nenvironmentally sound, engineered landfills; environmentally controlled incineration; disposal of\nwastes in deep ocean waters; \u201cwaste to energy\u201d techniques; and transportation of wastes to an\noverseas  location.    The  last  three  methods  are  considered  inappropriate,  as  they  fall  short  of\nenvironmental standards or are impractical for the Project.\n\nThe  second  step \n\nlandfill  and\n96.\nenvironmentally controlled incineration, which are the only two potentially usable alternatives for\nfuture solid waste disposal. Three alternative scenarios were compared for both Rarotonga and\nAitutaki:\n\nin  analyzing  alternatives  considered  sanitary \n\n\f20\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nScenario 1 \u2013 landfill for 30 years operation.\nScenario  2  \u2013  landfill  for  15  years  operation,  followed  by  a  second  stage  of\ndevelopment for another 15 years.\nScenario  3  \u2013  Incineration,  for  30  years  operation.  This  includes  replacement  of\nthe incinerator after 15 years.\n\n97.\nThe  financial  costs  of  each  alternative  were  converted  to  economic  costs  and  then\ndiscounted at 12 percent per annum to estimate net present values. The results of the analysis\nare summarized in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Comparison of Alternative Scenarios\n\nAlternative\n\nPresent Value of Costs ($ million)\n\nScenario 1: Landfill for 30 years operation\nScenario  2:  landfill  for  15  years  operation,\nfollowed by expansion for another 15 years\nScenario 3: Incineration\n\nRarotonga\n1.28\n1.08\n\n1.55\n\nAitutaki\n0.71\n0.63\n\n0.89\n\n98.\nScenario  3,  incineration,  has  the  highest  present  value  of  costs  on  both  islands.\nComparing  the  landfill  scenarios,  scenario  2,  with  phased  landfill  development,  has  the  lower\npresent value because a proportion of the expenditure is not needed until the second phase is\nrequired  in  15  years  time.  The  difference  between  scenarios  1  and  2  in  Aitutaki  is  small\nbecause the landfill is so small that there are \u201cdiseconomies\u201d of scale, and the cost of mobilizing\nfor the second phase almost overcomes the benefits of postponing expenditure.\n\n99.\nIn  comparing  nonvalued  factors,  landfills  have  several  advantages  over  incineration.\nThey  have  a  relatively  lower  level  of  technology,  and  operationally  are  more  appropriate  than\nincineration in the Cook Islands. O&M of incineration would require expertise that is not locally\navailable.  Socially,  landfills  would  have  less  impact  than  incineration  because  landfilling  is\nalready  an  accepted  method  of  waste  management.  Consequently,  sites  for  landfilling  have\nbeen  relatively  easy  to  identify.  As  incineration  is  not  well  known,  sites  are  difficult  to  identify\nand acquire.\n\n100. Scenario  2  is  economically  and  technically  the  best  option.  It  allows  flexibility  to\nincorporate advancements in waste management technology during the next 15 years. Phased\nlandfill construction was therefore adopted as the waste management method for the Project.\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Analysis, Cost Recovery and Sustainability\n\n101.\nThe  Project  aims  at  achieving  financial sustainability  through  full  cost  recovery  and\naffordability. It is intended to recover the costs of  O&M  and  debt  servicing  by  2003,  and  of\nO&M, depreciation, interest and a modest return on capital by 2004, through a combination of\nuser charges and an environmental tax levied on airport users. The financial analysis examines\nthe projected financial statements of the waste management operations, estimates the financial\ninternal rate of return (FIRR) and assesses the ability and willingness of the consumers to pay.\n\n  Financial  statements  were  projected  for  waste  management  operations  on  Rarotonga\n102.\nand  on  Aitutaki.  Detailed  financial  projections  up  to  the  year  2012  were  prepared  for  each\nproject  component  to  assess  the  impact  on  the  revenue  and  expenditure  streams  of  each\nmanaging  entity.  The  projected  financial  statements  are  presented  in  current  prices.  Key\n\n\f21\n\nfinancial  ratios  relating  to  liquidity,  gearing,  debt  service,  and  profitability  were  computed  and\nshow acceptable results. Detailed financial projections and ratios are in Appendix 11.\n\n103.\nFIRRs  were  computed  for  both  project  components.  The  analysis  was  undertaken  in\nconstant 1999 prices. Estimates of capital expenditures and O&M costs were phased according\nto  the  programmed  implementation  schedule.  The  financial  revenues  required  for  full  cost\nrecovery were estimated including domestic and commercial user charges, tipping fees, and a\nportion  of  the  environmental  levy.  Assumptions  underlying  the  FIRR  analysis  are  detailed  in\nAppendix 11 and the results summarized in Table 4.\n\nTable 4: Financial Internal Rates of Return\n\nItem\n\nRarotonga (%)\n   Sensitivity    Indicator\nAitutaki (%)\n  Sensitivity Indicator\n\nWeighted\nAverage\nCost of\nCapital\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nBase\nCase\n\nCosts\n Increased\nby 10%\n\nRevenues\nReduced\n by 10%\n\n3.6\n\n2.0\n\n1.6\n5.7\n0.1\n9.3\n\n1.3\n6.3\n-0.1\n10.3\n\nRevenues\nDelayed\n by One\nYear\n2.5\n\nCosts Increased\n by 5% and\nRevenues\n Reduced by 5%\n1.5\n\n0.0\n\n1.2\n\nAssuming Government funds are raised at 6 percent per annum, the ADB loan carries a service charge of 1.5 percent\nper annum and inflation is 2.5 percent.\n\n104.\n  The  base  case  FIRR  is  estimated  at  2.9  percent  for  the  Rarotonga  landfill  and  2.4\npercent  for  the  Aitutaki  landfill.  These  compare  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of\ncapital (WACC), estimated to be about 0.4 percent for both. Hence, no long-term subsidies will\nbe  involved  and  the  waste  management  services  will  be  sustainable  for  both  project\ncomponents. Conventional sensitivity tests show that the FIRR for both components is sensitive\nto  significant  changes  in  costs  and  revenues.  Only  in  the  most  adverse  scenarios  for  Aitutaki\ndoes the FIRR fall below the WACC; this is acceptable given the relatively higher costs and the\nlower revenue potential of Aitutaki\u2019s system.\n\n105. Revenues will come from five sources: (i) direct user charges from commercial and other\nnonhousehold establishments; (ii) contributions from the environmental levy, which is a portion\nof the airport departure tax from Rarotonga; (iii) tipping fees from the disposal of waste at the\nfacilities; (iv) charges for the dumping and treatment of septage; and (v) charges on households\nto be imposed from 2004 for the collection of solid wastes on Rarotonga and Aitutaki.\n\n106.\n Based on 1999 data, the commercial sector and tourists generate 38 percent by weight\nof all solid wastes on Rarotonga and 23 percent on Aitutaki. Of this, tourists generate about 10\npercent of all solid wastes on Rarotonga and about 9 percent on Aitutaki. Since a significant part\nof  the  solid  waste  is  generated  either  directly  by  tourists  or  by  tourist  related  activities\n(commercial establishments), it is justifiable to let the tourist sector as a whole cross-subsidize\nwaste  collection  services  provided  to  the  household  sector.  Accordingly,  waste  collection  and\ndisposal  services  will  be  provided  to  the  tourist  sector  on  a  full  cost  recovery  basis.  The\nenvironment  levy  therefore  will  be  increased  with  inflation.  This  revenue  source  effectively\ncross-subsidizes  the  services  to  the  local  population,  particularly  the  poor  and  low-income\nhouseholds.\n\n107.\n  During the  period  from the present to 2004, tipping fees for commercial and domestic\nwastes  will  double  in  Rarotonga,  and  will  be  imposed  in  Aitutaki  as  necessary  to  cover  waste\ndisposal site costs.  In addition, modest increases will be made in existing collection charges in\n\n\f22\n\nRarotonga, and a collection charge will be levied on commercial wastes in Aitutaki. In 2004, a\nnew collection charge for domestic wastes will be introduced and that will allow recovery of all\ncosts including a modest return on capital.\n\n The proposed household charge of NZ$2.80 equivalent per monthp on Rarotonga and\n108.\nNZ$1.88 equivalent on Aitutaki in 2004 is affordable to most people. Households with monthly\nincomes  at  the  10th  percentile  level  of  income  would  pay  1.3  percent  of  monthly  income  on\nRarotonga and 1.2 percent on Aitutaki. Households with monthly incomes at the 20th percentile\nwould  pay  0.7  percent  of  monthly  income  on  Rarotonga  and  0.6  percent  on  Aitutaki.  If  the\naffordability  level  were  set  at  2.0  percent  of  household  income,  then  over  90  percent  of  all\nhouseholds would be able to pay the proposed user charges.\n\n Socioeconomic surveys undertaken through focus group discussions on Rarotonga and\n109.\nAitutaki  in  1999  show  that  people  are  willing  to  pay  for  solid  waste  management  services.\nHouseholds on Aitutaki are prepared to pay an average of NZ$2.77 per week or about NZ$11\nper month. This is thought to be a conservative estimate and in reality is likely to be higher. The\ncurrent absence of a collection and disposal service on Aitutaki is causing some alarm among\nthe  population  and  many  are  willing  to  pay  for  the  introduction  of  the  service.  On  Rarotonga,\nhouseholds are prepared to pay an average of NZ$1.48 equivalent per week or about NZ$6.11\nequivalent per month.  This too is thought to be a conservative estimate.\n\n110.\n Results of the survey of tourists on Rarotonga indicate a general willingness to pay for\nsolid  waste  management  through  the  environmental  levy  on  the  departure  tax  paid  at  the\nairport. None of the respondents disagreed with the imposition of the levy. For all services, most\npeople expressed a willingness to pay more. An average of $1.10 equivalent was found to be\nthe additional amount that people would be willing to pay; this is about the increase needed to\nensure that other programs could still be supported by the levy.\n\n4.\n\nEconomic Analysis, Benefits, and Rate of Return\n\n111.\n  Economic  analysis  established  the  economic  rationale,  need,  and  demand  for  the\nProject;  assessed  the  impacts  of  alternatives;  and  analyzed  the  proposed  components.\nEconomic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  were  calculated  and  compared  with  the  economic\nopportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC)  for  each  component.  Project  components  were  also\nassessed in qualitative terms since nonvalued benefits are particularly important for this project.\nDetails are given in Appendix 12.\n\n112.\n  For  both  components  a  number  of  non-quantifiable  benefits  are  important.    These\ninclude  nonincremental  resource  savings,  recycling  and  reuse,  health  benefits,  visual  impact,\nenvironmental protection, and the potential direct and indirect economic impact of environmental\ndegradation  on  the  tourism  industry.  Resource  savings  include  time  savings  and  costs  of\ntransportation for residents and enterprises that currently dispose of waste themselves.  This is\nimportant  for  Aitutaki  where  pits  are  dug,  filled,  and  then  covered.    Health  benefits  are\nassociated  mainly  with  pest  control  and  with  sanitation-related  illnesses.  For  Aitutaki,\nuncontrolled  dumping  creates  breeding  grounds  for  mosquitoes  and  other  pests.  The  Project\nencourages  the  recycling  and  re-use  of  various  elements  of  the  waste  stream.  The  proposed\ndensification  of  materials  enables  them  to  be  re-used  for  other  purposes,  or  saves  volume,\nincreasing  the  life  of  the  landfill.  Residents,  nonresidential  establishments,  and  visitors  both\n\n                  \n\np Base figures of NZ$6 equivalent for Rarotonga and NZ$4 equivalent  per month per household were computed. To\nassess  affordability,  value-added  tax  (VAT)  at  12.5  percent  was  added  to  the  base  figures.  However,  it  is\nrecommended that waste management services be exempt from VAT.\n\n\f23\n\nneed  and  demand  the  Project.    The  findings  of  the  discussion  groups  demonstrated  effective\ndemand expressed as a willingness and ability to pay. The impacts of the Project are removing\nthe unsightly mounds of waste and preventing the pollution of groundwater, surface water, and\nair. Pollution of the lagoon may lead to the destruction of coral and other marine life. Protection\nof  the  environment  and  visual  cleanliness  are  prerequisites  for  safeguarding  the  tourism\nindustry, which is essential for economic survival.\n\n113.\n Declines in tourism have been experienced in similar sites in Asia and the Pacific due to\nenvironmental degradation. Without the Project, the number of tourists visiting the Cook Islands\nwould likely decline or would increase at a reduced rate.\n\nThe  analysis  of  project  components  included  calculating  the  EIRRq,  which  determines\n114.\nwhether  the  economic  benefits  outweigh  the  economic  costs  of  the  Project  at  the  chosen\nEOCC.  The  analysis  included  sensitivity  tests  and  an  assessment  of  nonvalued  factors.\nNonvalued  factors  are  important  for  environmental  projects,  given  the  difficulties  of  valuing\nbenefits. In calculating the EIRR, financial costs were converted to economic costs.  Costs were\nsplit  into  local  and  foreign  exchange  elements,  and  taxes  and  duties  were  excluded.\nConversion  factors  were  applied  to  reflect  the  opportunity  cost  of  the  landr  and  the  value  of\nunskilled  labors.    Economic  costs  were  phased  over  the  life  of  the  Project,  which  is  20  years.\nReplacement  values  were  included  for  material  and  equipment  at  appropriate  years  and  a\nresidual value for the civil works component included at the end of the project life.\n\n115.\nThe  Project  will  benefit  the  residents  and  nonresidential  establishments  on  Rarotonga\nand  Aitutaki.  For  both  islands,  the  economic  benefits  were  calculated  from  an  average\nwillingness  to  pay  (WTP)  based  on  questionnaires  completed  during  the  focus  discussion\ngroups  and  expected  revenues  from  the  nonhousehold  sector.    For  Rarotonga,  net  revenues\nfrom the additional recycling of aluminum cans, were also calculated. The WTP survey revealed\naverage willingness to pay around NZ$6.11 equivalent per household per month for Rarotonga\nand  NZ$5.17  equivalent  for  Aitutaki.  The  expected  revenues  from  the  nonhousehold  sector\ninclude a portion of the environmental levy on the airport departure tax, direct user charges, and\ntipping fees.  Expected revenues are detailed in Appendix 11.\n\nTable  2  summarizes  the  results  of  the  EIRR  analysis  and  the  sensitivity  tests  at  levels\n116.\nconsidered  appropriate  for  the  Project.    A  delay  in  the  benefit  stream  of  one  year  is  also\nconsidered.\n\nTable 2: Economic Internal Rates of Return and Sensitivity Tests\n\nItem\n\nRarotonga (%)\nSensitivity Indicator\nSwitching Value (%)\nAitutaki (%)\nSensitivity Indicator\nSwitching Value (%)\n\nBase\nCase\n\n14.2\n\n12.9\n\nCosts\nIncreased\nby 10%\n11.5\n1.7\n16.0\n10.2\n2.1\n11.0\n\nBenefits\nReduced\nby 10%\n11.2\n1.9\n14.0\n9.9\n2.3\n10.0\n\nBenefits\nDelayed by\none year\n10.9\n\nCosts Increased by\n10% and Benefits\nReduced by 10%\n8.6\n\n9.8\n\n7.4\n\n117.  For  both  Projects,  the  EIRR  is  higher  than  the  EOCC,  which,  in  accordance  with  ADB\nguidelines for projects with significant environmental benefits, is assumed to be 10 percent.  For\n\n                  \n\nq The analysis uses the domestic price numeraire, and constant 2000 prices.\nr The value of the land in its next best alternative use.\ns Conversion factor for unskilled labor is taken to be 0.8.\n\n\f24\n\nRarotonga,  the  EIRR  is  percent.  Only  under  the  worst  case  sensitivity  test  does  the  EIRR  fall\nbelow  10  percent.    Costs  would  have  to  increase  by  16  percent  and  benefits  would  have  to\ndecrease  by  14  percent  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  below  the  EOCC.    For  Aitutaki,  the  EIRR  is  12.9\npercent.  Under a number of assumptions, the EIRR marginally falls below 10 percent. Where\ncosts increase and benefits decrease both by 10 percent, the EIRR is 7.4 percent. Costs would\nhave to increase by 11 percent and benefits would have to decrease by 10 percent for the EIRR\nto  fall  below  the  EOCC.  As  an  alternative  method  to  calculating  the  EIRR,  which  is  based  on\nidentified  and  valued  benefits,  the  economic  analysis  also  calculated  the  reduction  in  tourism\nthat would have to occur for the EIRR to fall below the EOCC.\n\nB.\n\nEnvironmental\n\nThe Project will be of significant environmental benefit to the islands of Rarotonga and\n118.\nAitutaki.  Improved  waste  management  will  reduce  the  risk  of  surface  water  and  groundwater\npollution currently caused by landfill leachate. Air quality will be improved because wastes will\nno  longer  need  to  be  burned  under  uncontrolled  conditions;  smoke  emissions  will  be\nsignificantly reduced. Mitigation plans for the existing landfill site in Rarotonga will be developed.\nBy eliminating the need to dump wastes on vacant ground, the aesthetic improvements that will\nstem from the Project, will increase tourists\u2019 appreciation of the islands\u2019 environments, and will\nlead  to  continued  economic  benefits.  Involving  Environment  Service  staff  in  designing  and\nimplementing  the  Project  will  improve  their  practical  knowledge  and  capacity  in  waste\nmanagement technology.\n\nC. \n\nPoverty Impact\n\n119. All  poor  and  low-income  households  in  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki  are  expected  to  benefit\nfrom the Project. About 10 percent of all households in Rarotonga are considered poor, and the\nproportion is higher in Aitutaki. To minimize the impact on their cost of living, the poor, destitute,\nand  lower  income  households  will  not  be  required  to  pay  charges  based  on  the  full  average\nincremental cost of waste management services. The services will be subsidized under the cost\nrecovery arrangements proposed for the Project.\n\n120. Poor  and  low-income  households  in  the  project  area  will  also  indirectly  benefit  from\nsustained environmentally sound waste management services.  Such services are conducive to\nlong-term growth in tourism and the economy as a whole, favoring income-earning opportunities\nfor all, including the poor.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n121.\nassurance; which have been incorporated in the legal document:\n\n(i)\n\nThe Government will ensure that, by 31 December 2001\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\na  new  Environment  Act  is  presented  to  Parliament,  with  provisions\nprohibiting dumping of solid waste on private land, and requiring disposal\nof  solid  wastes  at  the  designated  landfill  sites  and  regular  removal  of\nsludge from septic tanks and disposal at the designated sites; and\nnecessary  legislative  change  are  introduced,  and  Cabinet  directives  are\nmade,  for  establishing  an  improved  institutional  framework  for  waste\nmanagement services  contracting out.\n\n\f25\n\n(ii)\n\nThe Borrower will also ensure that by 31 August 2003\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\nfor  monitoring \n\nthe  performance  of \n\n(a) MOW will contract out waste management services in Rarotonga, and AIC\nwill  contract  out  waste  management  services  in  Aitutaki,  the  relevant  draft\ncontracts are forwarded to ADB for approval three months before they take\neffect,  and  such  contracts  include  transparent  bidding  procedures  and  set\nout  appropriate  procedures \nthe\ncontractors;\ntaxes  and  fees  are  levied  at  the  landfill  site  for  waste  disposal  by  the\nnonhousehold sector and by households that dispose of wastes directly at\nthe landfill sites;\nthe  costs  of  O&M  and  debt  service  are  recovered  through  taxes  and  fees\nfrom waste management services;\nsuch taxes, fees, charges, and other expenditures are reviewed at regular\nintervals  by  MFEM  and  MOW  in  Rarotonga,  and  by  MFEM  and  AIC,  in\nAitutaki,  to ensure that they remain at appropriate levels;\nthe  Ministry  of  Health  assumes  responsibility  for  public  health  monitoring,\nestablishes  environmental  health  monitoring  systems,  and  monitors  and\nassesses public health impacts of waste management systems;\nthe  Environment  Service  assumes  responsibility \nfor  monitoring  and\nassessing  environmental  impacts  of  waste  management  systems  in\nRarotonga,  and  the  Environmental  Committee  to  be  established  by  the\nBorrower  prior  to  31  August  2003  assumes  the  same  responsibility  in\nAitutaki;\nthe  Environment  Service  assumes  responsibility  for  formulating  a  waste\nmanagement  policy,  public  consultation,  and  awareness  programs  in\nRarotonga,  and \nthe  same\nresponsibilities in Aitutaki; and\nthe  Environment  Service  prepares  integrated  waste  management  plans,\nincluding remediation strategies for existing waste disposal sites.\n\nthe  Environmental  Committee,  assumes \n\n(h)\n\n(g)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\n(iii)\n\nThe  Government  by  28  February  2004,  will  make  a  comprehensive  review  of  the\nfinancial  position  of  the  waste  management  services  with  a  view  to  achieving  full  cost\nrecovery  through  introduction  of  user  charges  by  31  August  2004  to  households  for\nwaste collection and disposal services. Full cost recovery will comprise recovery of the\ncosts  of  O&M,  debt  service,  depreciation,  and  a  modest  return  on  capital  deemed\nsuitable  by  the  Borrower.

The  main  thrusts  of  the\nAction Plan are\n\n\u2022  efficient, effective, and equitable provision of waste management services;\n\u2022  cost recovery through user charges for commercial users;\n\u2022  private sector participation, as appropriate;\n\u2022  community involvement and partnerships; and\n\u2022  environmental levy component of airport departure charges at Rarotonga airport.\n\n124. Actions  required  to  establish  the  policy  framework  are  in  Table  A3.1.    Measures  for\nlaying the  legal framework  are in Table A3.2 and the broad institutional framework is in Table\n3.3.  The  policy  and  legal  frameworks  are  valid  for  waste  management  services  in  Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki. The proposed institutional framework for cost recovery is in Table 3.4.\n\n125. Contracting  out  of  waste  management  services  will  continue  in  Rarotonga,  and  will  be\nintroduced in Aitutaki. Solid waste collection and disposal services for households in Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki will be financed from the environmental levy currently applied to departure fees at\nRarotonga  airport.  The  Ministry  of  Works  (MOW)  will  award  the  contract  and  will  monitor  the\ncontractors\u2019 performance. The contractor will collect tipping fees, which will be collected at the\nwaste  management  site,  from  users  who  take  wastes  directly  to  the  waste  management  site,\nand fees from non-household users.\n\nIn  Aitutaki,  the  Aitutaki  Island  Council  (AIC)  will  engage  a  private  contractor  for  waste\n126.\ncollection  and  operation  of  the  landfill  site.  Tariffs  and  charges  from  households  and  from  the\nnonhousehold sector will be collected through the Aitutaki Power Board.\n\nIn  both  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  charges  for  emptying  sludge  from  septic  tanks  will  be\n\n127.\nlevied by private contractors, who will pay tipping fees to the operators of the septage lagoons.\n\n\fTable A3.1: Policy Framework\n\nSequence of Reforms and

Appendix 11, page 1\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe financial objectives of the Project are to: (i) create a waste collection and disposal\n1.\nsystem that is financially viable and sustainable and (ii) provide waste collection and disposal at\na price that is affordable to users.\n\nThe  project  was  analysed  by  examining  the  projected  financial  statements,  calculating\n2.\nthe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  and,  average  incremental  financial  cost  (AIFC)  for\neach component and assessing the affordability of the proposed charges.\n\nThe  basic  premise  for  this  analysis  is  that  full  cost  recovery  will  be  accomplished  over\n3.\ntime.  This  stems  from  the  agreement  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the\nGovernment of the Cook Islands on cost recovery targets:\n\nto  recover  debt  servicing  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  through\ncommercial charges, tipping fees for nonhousehold wastes and household waste taken\ndirectly to the landfill, and the environmental levy on the airport departure charge during\nthe  first  year  of  operation;  and  to  cover  of  interest,  depreciation,  O&M  costs  and  a\nreturn on capital through the introduction of user charges to the household sector from\nAugust 2004.\n\n1. \n\nRarotonga\n\n4.\nThe Environment Service is currently responsible for public solid waste management on\nRarotonga  through  two  contracts  with  private  companies.  Each  is  bid  annually.  The  first  is  for\ndomestic  garbage  collection  by  a  private  contractor  (T  and  M  Heather)  for  a  budgeted  fee  of\nNZ$110,400  for  2000/01.  The  second  is  for  maintenance  of  the  public  disposal  site  and  is\nbudgeted at NZ$50,400 for 2000/01. Waste is collected from households once a week, but no\ndirect  charges  are  imposed.  The  domestic  collector  also  provides  services  to  some  42\ncommercial  establishments,  emptying  some  544  bins  a  month.  Charges  for  this  service  are\nNZ$4 per bin.\n\n5.\nOther private businesses, including hotels and resorts, pay a private contractor (General\nTransport) directly to collect and dispose of solid waste. Every month some 70 bins (known as\n\u201crarobins\u201d)  serving  26  major  establishments  are  emptiedt.    Charges  for  this  service  are\nNZ$56.25 per load, including value-added tax (VAT), of which NZ$11.25 represents the current\ntipping fee at the Nikao site. The firm is also implementing another scheme that involves 120-\nliter wheeled bins, of which 22 operate at present. The charge for collection by bin is NZ$10 per\nweek.\n\n6.\nSome domestic waste disposal is undertaken unofficially in a quarry. However, the bulk\nis  dumped  along  with  collected  commercial  garbage  at  Nikao,  a  site  originally  built  as  a\nreservoir.  The  tip  is  operated  by  the  landowners  and  functions  as  a  private  disposal  site.  The\nGovernment,  through  a  contractor,  pays  for  compacting  of  the  site.    Charges  levied  on  users\nare, about NZ$20 per truckload of commercial waste and NZ$5 for domestic waste.\n\nt   The largest generators are Edgewater Resort with 15 per month and Pacific Resort at 10 per month.\n\n                  \n\n\f    49\n\n    Appendix 11, page 2\n\nFunds for paying the domestic collection and landfill compaction contractors are from the\n7.\nenvironmental  protection  fund  sourced  by  environmental  levy  of  NZ$5  added  on  to  the  airport\npassenger  departure  charge.  Budget  estimates  of  these  revenues  for  financial  year  2000/01u\nare some NZ$332,000. The current domestic collection contract is budgeted at NZ$110,400 and\nthe landfill compaction at NZ$50,400 per year. Hence some NZ$160,800 will be financed from\nthe  environmental  levy  for  solid  waste  management.  This  is  about  40  percent  of  the  available\nfunds  for  2000/01,  representing  some  NZ$2.40  of  the  NZ$5  levy.  Since  no  major  new  public\nlandfill site has been developed, there are no provisions to recover the capital investment costs\nassociated with the assets. No capital cost recovery is undertaken.\n\n8.\nIn  Rarotonga,  septic  tanks  are  pumped  out  only  when  they  overflow  and  become  a\nnuisance.  Two  contractors  provide  septic  tank  desludging  services.  Septic  tank  desludging\ncosts  $80  for  a  household;  hotels  and  industries  are  charged  about  $200.  The  price  of  septic\ntank desludging is high, and competition should bring it down. Septic tank sludge or septage is\ncurrently dumped on vacant land behind Vaimaanga Hotel, or on farmers\u2019 fields at the request\nof the farmer. No payment is made by either party.\n\n2. \n\nAitutaki\n\n9.\nIn Aitutaki there is neither a rubbish collection service nor a disposal site. Residents and\nbusinesses dump their own garbage mainly in backyards or in semicommunal pits. The full cost\nof dumping is borne by households and businesses.\n\n10.\nThere is no current system for septic tank desludging, and a vacuum tanker purchased\nfor  this  purpose  is  now  used  as  a  general-purpose  construction  tanker  on  the  island.\nDiscussions  with  the  Aitutaki  Island  Council  indicated  that  people  were  not  aware  of  the\nimportance  of  septage  disposal  and  the  need  to  desludge  septic  tanks.  There  is  currently  no\nplace to put septage, and landowners do not allow the discharge of septage onto fields.\n\nB.\n\nFinancial Projections\n\n11.\nIndicative  financial  statements  have  been  projected  for  management  of  the  assets  in\nRarotonga  and  on  Aitutaki.    A  computer  financial  simulation  model  was  been  developed  for\neach  operation.  For  each  project  component  detailed  financial  projections  were  prepared  to\nassess the impact on the revenue and expenditure streams of each managing entity.\n\n1. \n\nRevenues\n\n12. With the objective of fully recovering the costs of the facilities and services over time, a\ncombination of five revenue sources is recommended.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\ndirect charges or tipping fees at the landfill sites for collections from commercial\nestablishments and private trips based on volumes produced;\ndirect  charges  for  commercial  and  other  establishments,  based  on  volumes\nproduced;\n\nu     Financial Secretary, July 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v) \n\ndirect  charges  for  dumping  and  treatment  of  septage,  according  to  volumes\nproduced;\ncontributions  from  the  environmental  levy  sourced  by  collections  from  departing\nair passengers from Rarotonga; and\ndirect household charges to be introduced in January 2004.\n\n13.\n\nThe main assumptions used to compute the charges are summarized in Table A11.1.\n\n  Table A11.1: Key Assumptions in the Financial Analysis\n\nAssumption\n\nRarotonga\n\nAnnual growth in commercial bins/establishments (%)\n\n1.25\n\nplus \n\nbins \n\n552 \n275\nestablishments  currently\nnot serviced\n\n57 establishments\n\nNot applicable\n\nAirport environmental levy (held constant\nin real terms) (NZ$)\n\nNumber of departing air passengers in\nyear 2000\n\nAnnual growth rate of departing air\nPassengers (%)\n\nPercent  of  households  that  will  be  charged  garbage\nfees from 2004 onward\n\nNumber of households in year 2001\n\nAnnual growth rate of households(%)\n\nNumber of commercial establishments/\nbins to be covered by the collection\nservice, 2000 base figure\n\nRarobins for disposal:\n\u2022  Number per month in year 2000\n\u2022  Annual increase in numbers (%)\n\nTrucks dumping commercial waste a/:\n\u2022  Number per month in year 2000\n\u2022  Annual increase (%)\n\nOther vehicles dropping commercial\n waste b/:\n\u2022  Number per month, 2000\n\u2022  Annual increase (%)\n\nTrucks and other vehicles\ndomestic waste\n\u2022  Number per month, 2000\n\u2022  Annual increase (%)\n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n2002\n2005\n2010\n2015\n\nCollection rate (percent of period debit)\n\n2.50\n\n61,600\n\n2\n\n95\n\n2,621\n\n1.0\n\n70\nNone\n\n30\nNone\n\n20\nNone\n\n15\nNone\n\n40\n40\n70\n80\n\n95\n\nPercentage coverage of septic tank cleaning service:\n\nTipping of Septic  Sludge\n\nAitutaki\n\n2.50\n\n95\n\n462\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n4\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n4\n1\n\n60\n80\n80\n80\n\n95\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\n14.\nThe  proposals  below  demonstrate  indicative  charges  that  would  need  to  be  made  to\nachieve  full  cost  recovery  over  the  medium  term.    These  are  based  on  assumptions  of  waste\nvolume generated, population, and consumers set out above.  These charges are based on the\nprinciples of:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii) \n\nusers pay, including households;\npromoting economic efficiency by minimizing cross-subsidies; and\naffordability, particularly of household charges.\n\nThe indicative charges in current prices for  households, \n\n15.\ncommercial  and  other\nestablishments,  and  tipping  fees  are  shown  in Table A11.2 for 2002 and 2004.  Thereafter, all\ncharges  more  assumed  to  increase  in  line  with  inflation  annually.    The  proposed  charges\nassume that the environmental levy of NZ$5, which forms part of the airport departure charge,\nrepresents an additional contribution of tourists to environmental protection.  This is consistent\nwith  the  principle  of  users  pay  since  the  tourism  industry  contributes  a  high  proportion  of  the\noverall  waste  stream.    If  this  source  of  revenue  were  not  made  available,  then  the  charges  to\ndomestic, commercial, and other establishments would need to increase substantially.\n\nTable A11.2:  Indicative Charges for Waste Management, Assuming Full Cost\n\nRecovery (NZ$)\n\nItem\nYear\n\nRarotonga\n2004\n\n2002\n\nAitutaki\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\nCollection Charges\nDomestic charge per residence a\nCommercial establishment charge b\nOther establishment charge c\n\n0\n9 /bin\n30\n\n6\n10 /bin\n50\n\n0\n25\nIncluded above\n\n6\n30\n\nTipping fees\nCommercial waste, large load\nCommercial waste, small load\nDomestic waste, average load\nRarobins\nSeptage sludge per tanker\n\n40\n25\n15\n25\n50\n\n50\n30\n20\n30\n55\n\n30\n15\n11\nna\n40\n\n35\n20\n15\nna\n45\n\na. It  was  assumed  that  household  charges  will  be  imposed  from  August  2004  onward  and  will  gradually\nincrease  over  time    up  to  a  maximum  of  NZ$16  per  month  on  Rarotonga  and  NZ$12  per  month  on\nAitutaki.\n\nb. For some business properties in Rarotonga there will be no collection charges levied by the government\nsince  they  are  served  by  private  collectors  under  a  number  of  arrangements.  All  private  contractors  will\nhave  to  dump  rubbish  at  the  landfill  site  and  will  be  charged  appropriate  tipping  fees.    This  charge  was\nbased  on  the  number  of  commercial  bins  currently  being  emptied  regularly  by  the  household  rubbish\ncollector.  It  is  assumed  that  this  collection  service  will  continue  and  will  be  encouraged    to  expand\ncoverage under the terms of the collection contract.  On Aitutaki this refers to the number of commercial\nestablishments  and  would  represent  an  average  charge.    Aitutaki  Lagoon  Resort  will  be  charged  more,\nbut this has not been detailed in the computations.\n\nc.  Basic  charge  for  commercial,  industrial,  and  business  premises  not  currently  covered  by  public  and\n\nprivate waste collection services on Rarotonga.\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\n16.\nFor the long term, it is recommended that dependence on the environmental levy as a\nsource of revenue be reduced.  Over time, the major source of cost recovery should be through\ndirect user charges and the target should be full cost recovery through this source. But, to keep\nthe  costs  to  households  and  businesses  down  and  satisfy  the  objective  of  affordability,  in  the\nnear future major revenues should be from the special environmental levy. The extent to which\nthe shift toward direct user charges would be possible should be reviewed regularly in relation to\nactual household income levels.  This review should be the function of the Ministry of Finance\nand Economic Management, and any changes in the pricing structure should be submitted to an\neconomic regulator, who would have responsibility for approving price changes.\n\n17.\nThe  proposed  charges  exclude  VAT,  including  it  would  increase  the  amounts  by  12.5\npercent.  It is recommended that waste management charges be exempt from VAT, to keep the\ncosts to users to a minimum.\n\n3. \n\nProjected Financial Statements\n\n18.\nDetailed  indicative  financial  projections  up  to  the  year  2020  were  prepared  for  each\nproject  component.  Projections  were  restricted  to  the  waste  management  operations  as\nproposed under the Project.  The projected financial statements are presented in current prices\nthat include inflation in each year.\n\na. \n\nRarotonga Solid Waste Management\n\n19.\n  Table  A11.3  presents  summary  balance  sheets,  income  statements,  and  sources  and\napplications of funds for the waste management operations of Rarotonga up to the year 2012,\nwhen  replacing  vehicles  and  equipment  first  becomes  necessary.  Total  assets  are  seen  to\ngradually increase from NZ5.2 million in 2002 to NZ$5.8 million in 2012 as a result of growth in\nretained earnings from the operation. Sufficient cash is generated to be able to pay off all debt\nservice requirements and to purchase replacement vehicles and equipment in 2012. The current\nratio is adequate throughout the projected period from 2003.\n\n20.\nOn the basis of the proposed charges, the operation will run at a profit from 2004 once\ndomestic charges are introduced. Net profits of NZ$7,000 will be realized in 2004 and this rises\nto NZ$249,000 in year 2012. Net income before interest yields a 0.2 percent annual return on\naverage  capital  employed  in  2004  and  5.7  percent  in  2012.  Internal  cash  generation  is  more\nthan  sufficient  to  service  the  ADB  loan.  Domestic  charges  contribute  about  35  percent  of  the\ntotal  revenue  in  2004.  This  rises  to  44  percent  in  2012,  countering  the  reduced  importance  of\nthe environmental levy, which is held constant in financial terms at its assumed 2004 level. The\nkey ratios show acceptable results.\n\nb. \n\nAitutaki Solid Waste Management\n\nTable  A11.4  presents  summary  balance  sheets,  income  statements,  and  sources  and\n21.\napplications of funds for the solid waste management of the operation on Aitutaki up to the year\n2012 when replacing vehicles and equipment first becomes necessary. Total assets are seen to\ngradually increase from NZ$1.7 million in 2002 to NZ$2.0 million in 2012 as a result of growth in\nretained  earnings  from  the  operation.  Sufficient  cash  is  generated  to  be  able  to  pay  all  debt\nservice requirements and to purchase replacement vehicles and equipment in 2012. The current\nratio is adequate throughout the projection period.\n\n\f53\n\n    Appendix 11, page 6\n\n22.\nOn the basis of the proposed charges, the operation will run at a profit from 2004. Net\nprofits  of  NZ$21,000  will  be  realized  in  2004,  after  the  introduction  of  domestic  user  charges.\nThe amount is projected to increase to NZ$63,000 in 2012. Net income before interest yields a\n1.5  percent  annual  return  on  average  capital  employed  in  2004  rising  to  a  maximum  of  4.1\npercent  in  2011.  Internal  cash  generation  is  more  than  sufficient  to  service  the  national  debt.\nDomestic  charges  contribute  some  14  percent  of  the  total  revenue  in  2004  and  rise  to  23\npercent by 2012. The key ratios show acceptable results.

The  analysis  was  undertaken  in\nconstant 2001 prices. Estimates of capital expenditures and O&M costs were phased according\nto  the  implementation  schedule.  Capital  expenditures  included  those  for  (i)    land  and  land\nacquisition; (ii) land development comprising civil works, materials, detailed engineering design,\nand  construction  supervision;    (iii)  vehicles  and  equipment;  and  (iv)  project  implementation\nassistance.\n\n24.\nRevenues were computed as domestic and commercial user charges, tipping fees, and\na  portion  of  the  environmental  levy.  Revenues  from  commercial  charges  were  assumed  to  be\nrealized once the facilities are completed and operations to start in September 2002. Domestic\nrevenues commence in 2004. All revenues were computed in constant 2001 prices.\n\n25.\nNet revenues were computed and a base case FIRR was determined. Sensitivity tests\nwere  carried  out  where  (i)  costs  increase  by  10  percent  to  reflect  the  adverse  impact  of  a\nsubstantial  depreciation  of  the  New  Zealand  dollarv;  (ii)  revenues  decrease  by  10  percent;  (iii)\nrevenues are delayed for one year; and (iv) costs increase by 5 percent and revenues decrease\nby 5 percent.  A 5 percent decrease in revenues was considered realistic since much of this is\nprojected to be from departing air passengers whose numbers are expected to increase.\n\n26.\n Net revenues were computed and a base case FIRR was determined. Sensitivity tests\nwere  carried  out  where  (i)  costs  increase  by  10  percent  to  reflect  the  adverse  impact  of  a\nsubstantial depreciation of the New Zealand dollar;w (ii) revenues decrease by 10 percent; (iii)\nrevenues  are  delayed  for  one  year;  and  (iv)  costs  increased  by  5  percent  and  revenues\ndecrease by 5 percent. A 5 percent decrease in revenues was considered realistic since much\nof  this  is  projected  to  be  from  departing  air  passengers  whose  numbers  are  expected  to\nincrease.\n\n Financial net present values were computed for each alternative by discounting the net\n\n27.\nrevenue stream at the rate of the WAC.\n\n                  \n\nw  It is realistic to assume that 30 percent devaluation of the New Zealand dollar would be unlikely, given the recent\ndevaluation of the currency. A lower rate of 15 percent was imputed, which would increase the total costs by 9.4\npercent.\n\n\f    54\n\nAppendix 11, page 7\n\n28.\nThe results and detailed computations are in Tables A11.5 and A11.6 for the Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki components, respectively. The base case FIRR is estimated at 2.9 percent for the\nRarotonga component and 2.4 percent for the Aitutaki component. This compares favorably with\nthe  WACC estimate  of  about 0.4  percent for Rarotonga and 0.5 percent for Aitutaki. Since no\nlong-term  subsidies  are  involved,  the  waste  management  services  will  be  sustainable  for  both\nproject  components.  Full  costs  recovery  for  land,  land  development,  equipment  and  vehicles\nand O&M is targeted and is demonstrated to be achievable.\n\n29.\nConventional  sensitivity  tests  show  that  the  FIRR  for  both  components  is  sensitive  to\nsignificant adverse changes in costs and revenues. In Rarotonga, the FIRR in all cases remains\nhigher than the WACC. In Aitutaki, the FIRR in the most adverse cases falls below the WACC.\nThis is because revenues were restricted to achieve a minimum return by limiting the domestic\nuser charge and maintaining the environmental level constant in financial terms. Nevertheless, it\nis considered unlikely that costs and revenues will both change by more than 5 percent, which\ngives further support to the sustainability of both project components.\n\n2. \n\nAverage Incremental Financial Cost (AIFC)\n\n30.\n  AIFCs  were  computed  for  both  components  and  were  compared  with  the  average\nincremental financial revenue (AIFR) for each. The figures are indicative because the volumes\nrelate to solid waste management only, while the costs cover those for both the landfills and the\nseptage lagoons. Annual capital investment and operation costs, total revenues, and the volume\nof  solid  waste  disposed  were  calculated  for  each  year  and  discounted  at  the  WACC.  Table\nA11.7  shows  that,  for  both  components,  the  AIFR  exceeds  the  AIFC.  This  shows  that  the\nrevenues  are  based  on  charges  that  would  exceed  incremental  costs  and  realize  positive\nreturns.\n\nTable A11.7: Average Incremental Financial Costs (NZ$ per ton)\n\nComponent\n\nRarotonga Waste Management\n\nAitutaki Waste Management\n\nAIFC\n\n407\n\n1,092\n\nAIFR\n\n458\n\n1,210\n\nD.\n\nWillingness and Ability to Pay\n\n1. \n\nImpact\n\n  A  major  concern  relates  to  the  ability  of  customers  to  pay  charges  for  waste\n31.\nmanagement.  The adoption of a domestic users-pay approach in 2004 and full cost recovery of\nthe  capital  and  operating  costs  incurred  means  that  households  will  have  to  pay  NZ$8  per\nmonth in Rarotonga and NZ$6 per month in Aitutaki in 2004. The charges will rise to NZ$16 per\nmonth and NZ$12 per month, respectively, by 2112 and 2116 assuming an increase of NZ$1.0\neach year for Rarotonga, and NZ$0.75 each year for Aitutaki. The introduction of user charges\nto partially cover the costs of waste management will have a minimal impact the budgets of the\nhouseholds.\n\n\f55\n\n            Appendix 11 page 8\n\n2. \n\nSocioeconomic Surveys\n\n  The  socioeconomic  household  surveyx  undertaken  for  the  previous  ADB-funded  TA\n32.\ncontained  questions  regarding  families  willingness  and  preferred  method  of  paying  for  public\nutilities.  Of  109  respondents,  representing  4.9  percent  of  the  total  households  on  Rarotonga,\nsome forty-four, or 43 percent, of 103 respondents supported paying for solid waste programs.\nForty-eight, or 81 percent of 59 respondents, thought the Government should accommodate the\ncost of the collection and disposal of garbage. Although not an overwhelming support for paying\nfor  services,  a  significant  minority  did  support  the  concept.  The  preferred  means  of  paying  for\nsolid  waste  management  are  shown  in  Table  A11.8.    The  highest  proportion  opted  for  user\ncharges as opposed to taxation.\n\nTable A11.8: Preferred Means of Payment for Solid Waste Public Utilities\n\nMethod\n\nNumber\n\nPercentage\n\nOwn Maintenance\nOne-off Payment/Connection Fee\nUser Charges\nTaxation\n\n                   Total\n\nSource: Economic Households Survey, January 1995.\n\n5\n8\n30\n22\n\n65\n\n8\n12\n46\n34\n\n100\n\nThe \n\nresults  of \n\nthe  survey  were supplemented  by  opinions  received  through\n33.\nmany  public  meetings  and  discussions  with concerned \nand\norganizations. A general consensus is emerging of the inevitability of paying directly for public\nutilities  and  many  accept  the  need  for  introducing  users-pay  concepts,  provided  services  are\nimproved and maintained. Most people now see charging as unavoidable in the near future and\nwould be willing to pay.\n\nindividuals \n\nprivate \n\n More recent socioeconomic surveys, undertaken by consultantsy in 1999, through focus\n34.\ngroup  discussions  in  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki  show  that  people  are  willing  to  pay  for  waste\nmanagement  services.  In  Rarotonga,  households  are  prepared  to  pay  an  average  of  NZ$3.14\nper week or NZ$13 per month.  This too is thought to be a conservative estimate.  Residents\nindicated  concern  about  future  solid  waste  management  and  the  environment,  although  many\nrespondents  were  not  aware  that  the  present  disposal  sites  are  inadequate.    Only  a  small\nnumber  of  residents  were  not  willing  to  pay.  In  Aitutaki,  households  are  prepared  to  pay  an\naverage  of  NZ$2.77  per  week  or  NZ$11  per  month.  This  is  also  thought  to  be  a  conservative\nestimate. The current absence of a collection and disposal service in Aitutaki is causing some\nalarm among the population and many are willing to pay for the introduction of the service.\n\n A 1999 survey by consultants of a sample of tourists on Rarotonga indicates a general\n35.\nwillingness  to  pay  for  solid  waste  management  through  the  environmental  levy  as  part  of  the\nairport departure tax. Not one of about 60 respondents disagreed with the imposition of the levy.\nFor  all  services,  most  people  expressed  a  willingness  to  pay  more.  An  average  of  NZ$4  was\nfound to be the additional amount that people would be willing to pay.\n\nx      Economic  Households  Survey,  Cook  Islands  Statistics  Office,  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Planning,\n\n                  \n\nJanuary 1995.\n\ny  engaged under TA No.3085-COO.\n\n\f56\n\n \n\n    Appendix 11, page 9\n\n3.\n\nAffordability of Household Charges\n\n36.\n A key financial objective of the proposed Project is to improve cost recovery from waste\ngenerators by establishing an appropriate framework for recovering costs. Based on 1999 data,\nthe  commercial  sector  and  tourists  generate  38  percent  by  weight  of  all  solid  wastes  in\nRarotonga and 23 percent in Aitutaki. Direct solid waste generation by tourists is estimated to\nbe about 10 percent of all solid waste for Rarotonga and about 9 percent for Aitutaki. Since a\nsignificant  part  of  the  solid  waste  is  generated  either  directly  by  tourists  or  by  tourist-related\nactivities (commercial establishments), it is justifiable to let the tourist sector as a whole cross-\nsubsidize  waste  collection  services  provided  to  the  household  sector.  Therefore,  waste\ncollection  services  will  be  provided  to  the  tourist  sector  on  a  full  cost  recovery  basis.  The\nenvironmental levy, which supports about 17 percent of total cost recovery on Rarotonga and 65\npercent on Aitutaki, effectively cross-subsidizes the services to the local population, particularly\nthe poor and low income households.\n\n37.\n Table A11.9 shows that the proposed household charge of NZ$8 net of VAT per month\nin  Rarotonga  and  NZ$6  net  of  VAT  in  Aitutaki  in  2004  is  affordable  to  most  households.\nHouseholds  with  monthly  incomes  at  the  10th  percentile  income  would  pay  1.7  percent  of\nmonthly income in Rarotonga and 1.7 percent in Aitutaki. Households with monthly incomes at\nthe  20th  percentile  would  pay  0.9  percent  of  monthly  income  in  Rarotonga  and  0.9  percent  in\nAitutaki.  If  the  affordability  level  were  set  at  2.0  percent  of  household  income,  then  over  90\npercent of all households would be able to pay the proposed user charges.\n\n38.\n  Increasing  the  charges  over  time  is  not  detrimental  to  affordability  overall  and\nhouseholds at the 10th percentile income would pay 2.9 percent and 2.8 percent of income in\n2012 for waste management in Rarotonga and Aitutaki respectively.\n\nTable A11.9: Affordability of Household Charges\n\n   \n\n    Rarotonga\n\n   Aitutaki\n\nPercentile\n\nMonthly\nHousehold\nIncome,\n2000\nNZ$a\n\nHousehold Charges\nas a Percentage\nof Household\n Incomesb\n\nMonthly\nHousehold\nincome,\n2000\nNZ$c\n\nHousehold charges\nas a percentage\nof household\nincomesb\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\n2004\n\n2012\n\n2004\n\n2012\n\n  420\n  800\n1,090\n1,380\n1,700\n2,200\n2,920\n\n1.7\n0.9\n0.7\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.3\n\n2.9\n1.5\n1.1\n0.9\n0.7\n0.5\n0.4\n\n320\n600\n820\n1,040\n1,280\n1,650\n2,190\n\n1.7\n0.9\n0.7\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.3\n\n2.8\n1.5\n1.1\n0.9\n0.7\n0.5\n0.4\n\nSource: Consultants, and income data from the Cook Islands Household Income and Expenditure Survey,\n1998, Statistics Office, Rarotonga.\n\na. With about 4 percent economic growth achieved in 1999 and a further forecast of 4 percent for 2000, the\ndistribution and income levels for 2000 were assumed to increase at 2 percent per annum, half the rate of\neconomic growth. This is a conservative estimate.\nb. Proposed household charges are shown as a proportion of monthly household income, in constant 2000\nprices for years 2004 and 2012.\nc. Assumed to be 75 percent that of Rarotonga.\n\n\f      57\n\n      Appendix 11, page 10\n\n39.\n  For  households  that  are  considered  destitute,  it  is  recommended  that  an  approach\nsimilar to that for electricity be adopted for waste management. Under that arrangement bills are\npaid by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\n40.\n  Over  the  longer  term,  charges  are  to  be  kept  constant  in  real  terms  and  are  almost\ncertain to fall as a percentage of household income. Disposable incomes are likely to increase\nas a result of national economic growth, which is forecast to be 4 percent per annum over the\nnext few years.\n\n4.\n\nAirport Departure Levy\n\n  The  total  amount  required  from  the  airport  departure  levy  has  been  estimated  to  be\n41.\nNZ$5.00, comprising NZ$2.50 for Aitutaki and NZ$2.50 for Rarotonga. This is an increase over\nthe amount currently estimated to be allocated, where some $2.25 of the $5.00 levy is used to\nfund  the  cost  of  operating  the  solid  waste  management  service.  This  environmental  levy\nsupports  a  fund  designed  to  finance  the  Environment  Service  and  specific  environmental\nprojects.    However,  the  Environment  Service  is  now  funded  mainly  through  Government\nbudgetary  appropriations  and  the  environmental  levy  is  to  support  environmental  projects,\nincluding waste management.\n\n42.\n  Projections  made  have  maintained  the  amount  to  be  financed  from  the  environmental\nlevy  constant  in  current  prices  at  NZ$5.  The  assumption  is  to  use  the  whole  NZ$5  currently\ncharged for each departing passenger. To retain funds for other environmental projects, the levy\ncould  be  increased  to  say  NZ$7.50  or  NZ$8.00.  This  is  well  within  the  additional  NZ$4  that\ntourists were found to be willing to pay.\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\n43.\n  Significantly,  the  adoption  of  the  proposed  charges,  including  the  allocation  of  the\nenvironmental levy, would achieve full cost recovery over the life of the project. The operation of\nthe  facilities  is  financially  viable  and  therefore  sustainable.  However,  the  projections  made\nassumed debt service at cost with no allowance given for either foreign exchange risk or a loan\nguarantee.  Nevertheless,  positive  returns  are  projected  under  the  principles  recommended  for\nrecovery,  and  sufficient  reserves  could  be  built  up  to  cover  any  major  foreign  exchange  risk.\nThis does assume that domestic user charges will be introduced and maintained on both islands\nfrom January 2004.\n\n44.\n  The  proposed  household  charges  were  estimated  on  the  basis  of  overall  revenues\nrequired,  including  the  proposed  funds  available  from  the  environmental  levy,  and  the\naffordability of business and household charges.  Under the full cost recovery scenario, charges\nare  considered  affordable  to  households  representing  about  less  than  2  percent  of  monthly\nincome for the 10 percent of households considered poor.  The charges are much less than the\naverage willingness to pay, as determined from the survey undertaken during the TA.  Destitute\nindividuals will be helped through an arrangement similar to that currently in place for electricity.\n\n\fTable A11.3: Rarotonga Landfill and Septage Sludge Treatment Facility Projected

services, is one of the main economic earners.\nImproved waste management services are necessary to protect the environment from damage\nand to sustain the tourism industry, which is necessary for economic survival.\n\n2.\nThe  economic  analysis  (i)  establishes  the  economic  rationale  and  the  without-project\noption;  (ii)  establishes  the  need  and  estimates  the  demand  for  the  Project;  (iii)  assesses\nalternatives to determine the most cost- effective option; (iv) undertakes a detailed analysis of\nthe  proposed  components,  calculating  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR),  conducting\nsensitivity analysis, and assessing the project that cannot be valued; and (v) benefits addresses\nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB)\u2019s new objective of poverty reduction and examines how\nthe Project will assist in reducing poverty.\n\n1. \n\nEconomic Rationale\n\n3.\nRarotonga  and  Aitutaki  require  immediate  improvements  in  waste  management.    Both\nislands need a controlled, environmentally safe method of disposing of solid waste, which will be\nprovided  by  the  engineered  landfill,  and  of  septic  tank  sludge,  which  will  be  provided  by  the\nseptage lagoons.\n\nIn Rarotonga, residents consider the current rubbish collection system to be reasonably\n4.\neffective, although improvement is required particularly for bulky waste including car bodies and\nwhite  goods.  There  is  a  septic  tank  cleaning  service  provided  by  the  private  sector.  Although\nsludge is dumped in the bush, and away from homes, there is no environmentally safe disposal\nsystem.\n\n5.\nIn  Aitutaki,  there  is  neither  a  centralized  collection  system  for  solid  waste  nor  a  septic\ntank  cleaning  service.  The  problem  of  uncontrolled  waste  disposal  is  visible  and  is  a  major\nconcern to residents.\n\n2. \n\nThe Without-Project Situation\n\nfor  both \n\nislands  will  result \n\nThe  without-project  option \n\nin  serious  problems  of\n6.\nenvironmental degradation. This is relatively unnoticed at present but will become more serious\nin the longer term.  Furthermore, the unsightly appearance of waste is an important feature of\nthe without-project option.  Avoiding this is critical from both environmental and economic views.\nThe islands depend heavily on tourism, which will suffer, if their visual beauty is impaired and\nthe environment is left to degenerate.  Protecting the tourism industry is essential for economic\nsurvival.    The  Project  can  therefore  be  considered  as  a  prerequisite  for  economic  growth.\nWithout  the  Project,  if  the  tourism  industry  declines,  many  households  could  be  left  without  a\nsource of income.\n\n\f63\n\n        Appendix 12, page 2\n\nB.\n\nNeed and Demand\n\n1. \n\nNeed\n\n7.\nThere  is  both  a  need  and  a  demand  for  the  Project,  from  residents,  nonresidential\nestablishments, and visitors.  Discussion groups during the technical assistance (TA) revealed\nthat  residents  were  concerned  about  the  environment.  They  considered  environmental\nprotection  an  important  priority  for  their  quality  of  life.  In  particular,  discussions  with  the\ncommercial  and  particularly  the  tourism-related  sector  revealed  concerns  for  the  environment\nand for the physical cleanliness of the islands to sustain the tourist industry.\n\n2. \n\nDemand\n\n8.\nThe  projected  demand  for  future  waste  disposal  was  based  on  the  estimated  waste\ngenerated by residences, nonresidential including commercial and institutional establishments,\nand tourists. The projections were based on an assessment of recent trends, current conditions,\nand future economic policy. In accordance with the per capita generation rates calculated in the\nwaste  stream  analysis,  three  forecasts  were  generated  for  each  island,  covering  resident\npopulation, commercial establishments, and tourist nights or tourist night equivalents.\n\n9.\nDemand forecasts generated in this analysis are not intended to be used as population,\ncommerce,  or  tourism  forecasts  per  se.    They  were  made  to  provide  one  of  the  inputs  to\nforecast  the  volume  of  waste  generated  and  to  determine  the  appropriate  size  of  the  required\nlandfill.  However, the risk associated with demand forecasts is that the landfill either will outlast\nthe  intended  design  life  if  projections  are  too  high,  or  with  not  last  as  long  as  the  intended\ndesign life if projections are too low.  Therefore, cautious but reasonably optimistic assumptions\nwere used.\n\n10.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv) \n\n(v)\n\nFor 1999, the annual waste generation rates were 0.09 ton per resident, 0.76 ton\nper  establishment,  and  0.0004  ton  per  tourist  night.    This  rate  was  assumed  to\nremain constant.\nFor 1999, of the total waste volume generated, 62 percent was household waste,\n28 percent was nonhousehold waste and 10 percent was tourist waste.\nPopulation would increase at 1 percent per annum.  However, given the ease of\naccess to New Zealand, changes in the economy can lead to sharp increases or\ndecreases in the population. This makes any forecast of population difficult. The\nlong-term average growth rate over the last 30 years is neutral.  The proportion\nof  the  total  Cook  Islands  population  living  in  Rarotonga  has  increased  from  40\npercent to around 60 percent, although the rate of change has slowed in recent\nyears.    The  assumption  of  1  percent  per  annum  growth  is  consistent  with  the\nassumed  economic  recovery  and  moderate \nlong-term  economic  growth\nprojections for the Cook Islands.\nThe  number  of  commercial  establishments  would  increase  at  1.5  percent  per\nannum. This is consistent with the assumed economic recovery and expansion of\nthe private sector, some spare capacity in the economy, and assumed increases\nin tourist arrivals.\nTourist arrivals may be assumed to increase at 5 percent per annum until 2002,\nin line with Government forecasts and then at a more moderate rate of 2 percent\nper annum.  This is  consistent with trends in tourist arrivals, which have shown\nan  average  growth  of  around  5  percent  per  annum  over  the  last  10  years.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nTourist  length  of  stay  was  assumed  to  remain  constant  at  an  average  of  seven\ndaysz.\n\n11.\n\nFor Aitutaki, the key assumptions were the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi) \n\nFor  1999,  the  annual  waste  generation  rates  were  0.054  ton  per  resident,  0.38\nton per establishment, and 0.0004 ton per tourist night.  This rate was assumed\nto remain constant over time.\nFor 1999, of the total waste volume generated, 76 percent was household waste,\n15 percent was nonhousehold waste and 9 percent was tourist waste.\nPopulation  would  increase  at  1  percent  per  annum,  in  line  with  forecasts  for\nRarotonga  and  the  Cook  Islands.  The  assumption  of  1  percent  per  annum  is\nconsistent  with  the  assumed  economic  recovery  and  moderate  long-term\neconomic growth projections for the Cook Islands.\nThe  number  of  commercial  establishments  would  increase  at  0.5  percent  per\nannum.  This is consistent with the assumed economic recovery and expansion\nof  the  private  sector,  some  spare  capacity  in  the  economy  and  assumed\nincreases in population and in tourist arrivals.\nThe number of tourist nightsaa assumed that of the planned hotel developments,\nonly one the Rapae, will take place.\nBy  the  year  2021,  of  the  total  waste  stream  generated,  76  percent  would\nhousehold  waste,  12  percent,  non-household  waste,  and  12  percent,  tourist\nwaste.\n\nThe  generated  waste  volumes  were  converted  to  in-place  volumes  in  the  landfill  to\n\n12.\ndetermine the appropriate size and potential design life of the facility.\n\n13.\nFor septage treatment, the size of the facility was based on average septage production\nlevels per person. Facilities are sized to accommodate 450 cubic meters per year on Rarotonga\nand 200 cubic meters per year on Aitutaki.\n\nC.\n\nLeast Cost Analysis\n\n14.\nProject alternatives were considered at the prefeasibility stage and a detailed least cost\nanalysis  was  undertaken.    The  analysis  focused  on  the  options  for  solid  waste  disposal,\ncommensurate with the relative cost of the facilities.\n\n1.\n\nSolid Waste Disposal\n\nThe  analysis  considered  five  alternative  waste  disposal  methodologies  and  concluded\n\n15.\nthat only two are appropriate for this Project: engineered landfill and incineration.\n\nThree  alternative  and \n\n16.\nfor  detailed\nconsideration  in  the  least  cost  analysis.    For  both  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki  they  were:  (i)\nengineered landfill, designed for 30 years waste disposal; (ii) engineered landfill, built in two 15-\nyear phases; and (iii) incineration.\n\nfeasible  options  were  drawn  up \n\ntechnically \n\n                  \n\nz \n\naa \n\nAverage  length  of  stay  in  1995.    Strategic  Guidelines  for  Tourism  Development  in  Rarotonga,  1995-2000.\nDepartment of Tourism Taskforce, October 1995.\nSource of tourism arrivals data for Aitutaki, Air Rarotonga, May 1999.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\n17.\nFor  both  islands,  options  were  costed  in  economic  terms,  split  into  foreign  and  local\ncosts, taxes and duties excluded, and appropriate conversion factors applied.   At this stage, it\nwas  considered  inappropriate  to  attach  conversion  factors  to  land,  since  the  option  for\nincineration did not have a specified site.  Each option was discounted at 12 percent to give the\npresent economic cost of each alternative.\n\n18.\nThe  least  cost  option  in  economic  terms  was  the  phased  landfill  for  both  islands.    The\nanalysis  also  considered  other  qualitative  factors.    The  phased  landfill  was  also  the  favored\noption when considering implementation considerations, particularly land acquisition, social and\nenvironmental impact, and sustainability.\n\n2.\n\nSeptage Treatment\n\n19.\nThree  alternatives  were  considered  for  septic  sludge  disposal:  drying  beds,  biological\ndigestion, and lagoons. The cost of the options was not prepared to the same level of detail as\nfor  solid  waste  disposal  since  this  would  be  inappropriate  for  the  analysis.  However,  both\nquantitative  and  qualitative  factors  were  included.  The  preferred  alternative  is  to  locate  two\nseptage  lagoons at the  landfill. This option is not the cheapest but it causes fewer health and\nenvironmental problems, is of moderate cost, and is simple to maintain and operate.\n\nD.\n\nEconomic Analysis of Project Components\n\n1.\n\nApproach\n\n20.\nThe analysis determines whether the economic benefits outweigh the economic costs of\nthe Project at the chosen 10 percent economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC).  The analysis\nincludes  calculation  of  an  economic  incremental  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  on  each\nisland using the domestic price numeraire and constant 2000 prices.  Solid waste and septage\ntreatment  are  considered  together  since  the  benefits  are  both  environmental  and  cannot  be\nseparated. The analysis includes sensitivity tests, particularly an assessment of the impact on\ntourism  that  would  have  to  occur  to  justify  the  Project.    It  also  includes  an  assessment  of\nnonvalued  factors.    These  are  particularly  important,  given  the  environmental  nature  of  the\nProject and the associated difficulties of valuing benefits.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Costs\n\n21.\nThe choice of an EOCC of 10 percent is justified, given the environmental nature of the\nProject,  which  has  significant  undervalued  benefits  and  nonincremental  resource  savings  that\ncould not be valued in monetary terms. In calculating the EIRR, financial costs were converted\nto  economic  costs.    Costs  were  split  into  local  and  foreign  exchange  elements  and  taxes  and\nduties were excluded.  Taxes include a 12.5 percent value added tax (VAT) for all goods and\nservices, and 10 percent duties on specific importsbb. Conversion factors were applied to reflect\nthe opportunity cost of the landcc and the value of unskilled labordd.\n\n 22.\nThe  opportunity  cost  of  land  for  Rarotonga  was  assumed  to  be  zero,  as  it  has  no\nproductive alternative use.  Apart from taxes and import duties, there are no significant nation-\nwide distortions and the standard conversion factor \u2013 and the shadow exchange rate factor as\n\n                  \n\nbb Ministry of Finance and Economic Management.\ncc The value of the land in its next best alternative use.\ndd For unskilled labor which supply is in excess of demand, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.8 was used.\n\n\f66\n\n     Appendix 12, page 5\n\nwell \u2013 was therefore taken as 1. For Aitutaki, the opportunity cost of land was assumed to be 10\npercent of the financial costs, given the present value of potential earnings from agricultural use.\nTaro was said to be the appropriate crop for the site.  The earnings per acre were based on a\nmarket  price  of  approximately  NZ$18-19  per  20  kilogram  bag;  yields  of  2,200kg  per  acre,  as\nadvised by local producers; and production costs of NZ$0.74 per kg published by the Ministry of\nAgriculture.  Discounted over the life of the project the potential revenue stream gives a present\nvalue  per  acre  in  the  region  of  NZ$3,000  --  NZ$4,000,  or  approximately  10  percent  of  the\nfinancial cost of the land, estimated at NZ$36,000 per acre.\n\n23.\nEconomic  costs  were  phased  over  the  life  of  the  Project,  which  is  20  years.\nReplacement  values  were  included  for  material  and  equipment  at  appropriate  years  and  a\nresidual value for the civil works component included at the end of the project life ee.\n\n3.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\na.\n\nValued Benefits\n\n24.\nThe  Project  will  benefit  the  residents  and  nonresidential  establishments  in  Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki. Economic benefits were given value, where possible.  For environmental projects,\nhowever,  valuation  of  project  benefits  is  difficult.    Several  important  benefit  categories\nconsidered qualitative, were excluded from the EIRR calculation.\n\n25.\nFor  both  islands,  the  valued  economic  benefits  were  calculated  from  an  average\nwillingness  to  pay  (WTP)  based  on  questionnaires  completed  during  the  focus  discussion\ngroups  and  expected  revenues  from  the  nonhousehold  sector.  Even  if  a  full  cost  recovery\napproach is not adopted, this is considered appropriate since charges will still be leveled at the\nbusiness sector.\n\nThe focus groups enabled leaders and participants to discuss the without-project option\n26.\nand  the  services  to  be  provided  under  the  Project.    Participants  were  asked  how  much  they\nwould be willing to pay for solid waste services.  Respondents were given the option to indicate\na monetary amount or, alternatively, to indicate which of a number of listed items they would be\nwilling to give up per week to pay for the services.  These items included a range of everyday\ngoods, costing from NZ$2 to NZ$25.  In analyzing the results, where respondents had indicated\nan item that they would be willing to forgo, the equivalent amount in NZ$ was used to calculate\nthe average willingness to payff.\n\n27.\nFor Rarotonga, net revenues from the additional recycling of aluminium cans, were also\ncalculated and included as a valued benefit. The WTP survey revealed an average willingness\nto  pay  of  around  NZ$13  per  household  for  Rarotonga  and  NZ$11  for  Aitutaki.      The  expected\nrevenues from the non-household sector include direct user charges and tipping fees.\n\n28.\nIn  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  recycling  of  aluminum  cans  already  takes  place.  An\nestimated  additional  41  tons  of  aluminum  cans  could  potentially  be  recycled  each  year  in\nRarotonga and an additional 9.9 per year in Aitutaki for 1999.  Assuming that around 70 percent\nof  this  target  is  achieved,  for  Rarotonga  this  amounts  to  approximately  two  containers  per\nannum  that  could  be  shipped  to  New  Zealand  for  recycling.  This  would  give  a  net  revenue  of\n\n                  \n\nee The life of the civil works component was assumed to be 40 years, and that of equipment 10 years.\nff  A conservative approach was adopted in calculating the average willingness to pay.  Where\n   respondents indicated both a monetary amount and an item forgone, the lower value was taken.\n\n\f67\n\n    Appendix 12, page 6\n\nNZ$320,000  per  annum  gg.    For  Aitutaki,  the  additional  9.9  tons  amounts  to  less  than  one\ncontainer per year, and may be included as a valued benefit in the analysis.\n\n29.\n Since there is no current waste disposal site in Aitutaki, and waste is burned and buried\non land around people\u2019s homes, the immediate visual impact of the \u2018without-project\u2019 situation is\nmore damaging.  For this reason, a small reduction in the number of tourists visiting the island\nhas  been  valued.    While  the  immediate  impact  is  not  considered  to  deter  large  numbers  of\ntourists, visual beauty and the environment are the major attractions of Aitutaki and thus a loss\nof 4 percent of revenues is a conservative estimate in the loss of tourism potential.  Assuming\nthat the average visitor stay in Aitutaki is half that in the Cook Islands as a whole, expenditure is\nestimated at NZ$539 per visitor, giving a value of NZ$196,000 per year.\n\nb.\n\nNon-Valued Benefits\n\n30.\nFor  both  components,  other  nonvalued  factors  that  were  not  considered  in  calculating\nthe  EIRR  are  important.    They  include  nonincremental  resource  savings,  recycling  and  reuse,\nhealth  benefits,  visual  impact,  environmental  protection,  and  the  potential  direct  and  indirect\neconomic impact of environmental degradation on the tourism industry.\n\n31.\nResource  savings  include  time  savings  and  costs  of  transportation  for  residents  and\nenterprises that currently dispose of waste themselves.  This is important for Aitutaki, where pits\nare  dug,  filled  and  then  covered.  Uncontrolled  dumping  tends  to  create  breeding  grounds  for\nmosquitoes, and other pests.   Health benefits are associated mainly with pest control and with\nsanitation related illnesses.\n\n32.\nThe  Project  encourages  the  recycling  and  reuse  of  various  elements  of  the  waste\nstream.   The proposed densification of materials enables them to be reused for other purposes,\nor saves volume, increasing the life of the landfill.\n\n33.\nDirect  impacts  are  the  unsightly  appearance  of  waste  pollution  of  ground  water  and\nsurface water, and air pollution.  Direct effects have knock-on or indirect impacts.  The unsightly\nappearance  may  discourage  tourists  from  returning  to  the  islands  and  lower  the  reputation  of\nthe  Cook  Islands  as  a  scenic  holiday  destination,  resulting  in  fewer  visitors.    The  pollution\neffects tend to be relatively unnoticed.  In the long term, polluted waters and lagoons may lead\nto the destruction of coral and other marine life. This may result in fewer visitors. Protection of\nthe  environment  and  visual  cleanliness  are  considered  conditions  for  long-term  economic\ngrowth, given the dependence on tourism, which contributes about 37 percent GDP.\n\n4.\n\nEconomic Internal Rates of Return\n\nTables  A12.1  and  A12.2  show  the  calculation  of  the  EIRR  and  the  sensitivity  tests  for\n34.\nRarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  respectively.    The  tables  include  the  calculation  of  the  EIRR  under\nsensitivity tests at levels considered appropriate for this Project.  A delay in the benefit stream of\none year is also considered.  Table A12.3 summarizes the results.\n\n                  \n\ngg The price of aluminum cans is NZ$1.15 per kg.  Each container carried approximately 15 tons.\n   Shipping costs are NZ$1,900 per container.\n\n\f68\n\n        Appendix 12, page 7\n\n35. \n\nFor  both  Projects,  the  EIRR  is  higher  than  the  EOCC,  which,  in  accordance  with  ADB\nguidelines,  is  assumed  to  be  10  percent.      For  Rarotonga,  the  EIRR  is  12.7  percent.\nOnly  under  the  worst  case  sensitivity  test  does  the  EIRR  fall  below  10  percent.    Costs\nwould  have  to  increase  by  13  percent  and  benefits  would  have  to  decrease  by  11\npercent  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  below  the  EOCC.    For  Aitutaki,  the  EIRR  is  13.2  percent.\nUnder the worst case sensitivity tests, the EIRR does fall below 10 percent. Increasing\ncost by 17 percent and decreasing benefits by 15 percent would cause the EIRR to fall\nbelow the EOCC. Given the difficulty of valuing benefits and the conservative approach\nadopted in valuing tourism, these results are seen as acceptable.\n\nTable A12.3:  Economic Internal Rates of Return and Sensitivity Tests\n\nItem\n\nEIRR\n\nSensitivity\n\nSwitching\n\nIndicator\n\nValue\n\nRarotonga\n\nBase case\n\nCosts increase by 10%\n\nBenefits reduce by 10%\n\nCosts  increase  by  10  %  and\nbenefits reduce by 10%\n\nBenefits delayed by one year\n\nAitutaki\n\nBase case\n\nCosts increase by 10%\n\nBenefits reduce by 10%\n\nCosts  increase  by  10  %  and\nbenefits reduce by 10%\n\nBenefits delayed by one year\n\n5.\n\nTourism Impact\n\n12.7\n10.6\n\n10.3\n\n8.3\n\n10.9\n\n13.2\n11.2\n\n11.0\n\n9.2\n\n10.8\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n1.3\n\n1.5\n\n13\n\n11\n\n17\n\n15\n\n36.\nIn  addition  to  computing  the  EIRR,  the  economic  analysis  calculates  the  overall\nreduction  in  tourism  that  would  have  to  occur  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  below  the  EOCC.    This  is\nconsidered  an  appropriate  alternative  in  assessing  the  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  for\ntourism,  to  estimating  the  potential  number  of  tourists  who  would  not  visit  the  Cook  Islands\nbecause the Project did not materialize.  If the proportion of tourists is low, then there is a strong\neconomic justification for the Project.\n\n37.\n  For  the  EIRR  to  exceed  10  percent  and  using  tourist  revenues  as  a  proxy  for  valued\nbenefits,  incremental  revenues  in  Rarotonga,  would  have  to  exceed  about  NZ$820,000  per\n\n\f69\n\n  Appendix 12, page 8\n\nyear.  Given that tourists spend on average NZ$1,078 per person,hh then the estimated number\nof tourist visitors, to generate adequate revenues is only 760, or 1.3 percent of tourist visitors in\n1999.  This demonstrates that, in terms of potential lost tourism revenues, the Project could be\njustified if it avoided a reduction in tourism of about 1 percent.\n\n38.\n  For  the  EIRR  to  exceed  10  percent  and  using  tourist  revenues  as  a  proxy  for  valued\nbenefits,  incremental  revenues  in  Aitutaki,  would  have  to  exceed  about  NZ$240,000  per  year.\nAssuming  that  the  average  visitor  stay  in  Aitutaki  is  half  that  of  the  Cook  Islands  as  a  whole,\nexpenditure  is  estimated  at  NZ$539  per  visitor,  the  estimated  number  of  tourist  visitors,  to\ngenerate adequate revenues is only 445, or 5 percent of tourist visitors to Aitutaki in 1999.  This\ndemonstrates that, in terms of potential lost tourism revenues, the Project could be justified if it\navoided a reduction in tourism of about 5 percent.\n\n6.\n\nPoverty Impact\n\nthe \n\nADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategyii  recognizes  the  vulnerability  of  the  small  island\n39.\ncommunities of the Pacific, with their limited ability to deal with external economic shocks.  The\nheavy dependence on tourism in the Cook Islands, estimated at 37 percent of GDP, makes the\neconomy  vulnerable.  Collapse  of \nindustry  would  have  severe  economic\ntourism \nconsequences  and  lead  to  a  loss  of  employment  and  income,  not  only  for  those  directly\nemployed  in  the  tourism  industry,  but  also  indirectly  on  local  service  industries.    The  strategy\nstates that the main factor in reducing poverty in recent years has been economic growth, and\nthe resulting opportunities for employment and income growth. Protecting the tourism industry in\nthe Cook Islands is critical to the nation\u2019s economic survival. Without tourism, a large number of\npeople would have no means of income, and poverty levels would increase. Developing of the\ntourism  industry,  which  employs  a  relatively  high  proportion  of  women,  will  provide  further\ngrowth  and  employment  opportunities  for  residents,  and  help  to  lift  above  the  poverty  line  the\nestimated 10 percent of those families living in poverty.\n\n40.\nThe  strategy  also  recognizes  poverty  as  a  deprivation  of  essential  assets  and\nopportunities.    This  includes  access  to  services  such  as  solid  waste  disposal  and  sanitation\nfacilities, which are essential for public health and sound environmental management.\n\n7.\n\nSummary\n\n41.\n  Economic  dependence  on  tourism  and  the  importance  of  the  physical  environment  in\nmaintaining  and  developing  the  tourist  industry  are  critical  in  assessing  this  Project.  The\nimportance  of  maintaining  the  environment  and  other  benefits  that  have  not  been  valued\nindicate that the true worth of the Project is likely to be much higher than the calculated EIRR.\nThe Project is economically justified.\n\n                  \n\nhh Tourism, Cook Islands, 2000.\nii  The Bank\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, Mission Statement, 1999.\n\n\fTable A12.1: Rarotonga Waste Management \u2013 Economic Analysis (NZ$\u2019000)\n\nFinancial Costs\n\nEconomic Costs\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\nSensitivity Tests\n\nYear\n\nCapital\nCost\n\nO&M\nCost\n\nCost\n\nTotal Cost Capital\n\nO&M Cost Total Cost\n\nHousehold\nWillingness to Pay\n\nNon\n\nresidential Recycling\n\nTotal\nBenefit\n\nNet\nBenefits\n\nCosts\nplus 10%\n\nBenefits\nless 10%\n\nCosts\nplus &\nbenefits\nless 10%\n\nBenefits\ndelayed\nby one\nyear\n\n             -\n\n533\n3,775\n\n           785\n        3,836\n           332            332\n           332            332\n           332            332\n           332            332\n           332            332\n           332            332\n           332            332\n           332            332\n           332            332\n\n2001            785\n2002         3,836\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012            466            332            798            498\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022 -
