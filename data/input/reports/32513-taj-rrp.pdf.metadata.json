About 79 percent of\nbeneficiaries  live  below  the  poverty  line.  Based  on  the\nclassification  criteria  applicable  in  2001,  the  Project  would\nqualify as a core poverty intervention.\nEnvironment Assessment Category  B:  An  initial  environmental  examination  was\nundertaken; the summary is a core appendix.\nRationale The power sector in Tajikistan has been severely affected by\nthe disintegration of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in\n1990.  Construction  of  new  hydropower  plants  has  been\nhalted,  and  maintenance  of  the  existing  infrastructure  has\nbeen neglected due to lack of funds.  As a result of the poor\neconomic situation of the country and damage caused by the\ncivil war, power supply is on the verge of collapse. In addition,\nwith  the  increase  in  prices  of  gas  and  petroleum  imports,\nresidential consumers have switched to electricity, generated\nby hydropower plants. This has placed additional demand on\nthe generation facilities. Power cuts are common throughout\nthe year, especially during winter when insufficient electricity\nis provided in rural areas. Without improvements in power\nsupply,  the  living  conditions,  particularly  of  the  poor,  will\ncontinue to be miserable. Social surveys during the feasibility\nstudy for the Project confirmed that the poor have significantly\nless  access  to  electricity  supply  than  other  sectors  of  the\npopulation. Given the urgent need to overcome power supply\nconstraints and to increase the efficiency of energy supply and\nuse,  top  priority  is  being  given  in  the  medium  term  to\nretrofitting  and  rehabilitating  existing  power  facilities  rather\nthan  adding  new  capacity.  Such  measures  will  particularly\nbenefit the poor who cannot afford alternative fuels.\nObjectives The Project will (i) improve people's quality of life and support\npoverty  reduction  in  the  project  areas  by  increasing  the\navailability  of  electricity;  and  (ii)  assist  in  the  postconflict\nrecovery of Tajikistan's economy. This will be achieved by\nincreasing the availability and reliability of power supply in an\nenvironment-friendly  manner,  through  the  rehabilitation  of\nexisting generation, transmission, and distribution facilities.", "ii\nScope Part A: rehabilitation and power supply improvement in poor  war-\ndamaged areas of Khatlon Region, consisting of rehabilitating CHPP,\nstrengthening transmission and distribution networks, installing consumer\nmeters, and providing electricity to about 24,000 mostly poor households.\nPart B: rehabilitation of NHPP and associated transmission\nfacilities to improve reliability of power supply from this most\nimportant power plant in Tajikistan.\nPart C: rehabilitation of two major distribution substations in\nDushanbe  region  to  improve  reliability  of  power  supply  to\nabout 148,000 mostly poor households.\nPart D: improvement of bulk metering for import and export of electricity\nfrom and to the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan, and for power exchange\namong regional distribution networks.\nPart E: consulting services to support project implementation,\naudit corporate and project accounts of Barki Tajik for fiscal\nyears 2000 and 2001, and develop implementing regulations\nfor the Energy Law.\nCost Estimates The Project is estimated to cost $62.8 million equivalent comprising a\nforeign exchange cost of $49.3 million and a local currency cost of $13.5\nmillion equivalent.\nFinancing Plan The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will finance $34 million of\nthe foreign exchange cost, representing 54 percent of the total\nproject  cost.

The proceeds of\ncofinancing by the Swiss Government will be relent by the\nGovernment  to  Barki  Tajik  under  similar  conditions  as\nrelending of the ADB loan. The proceeds of cofinancing by\nIDB will be relent by the Government to Barki Tajik on the\nsame terms as that to the Government. The foreign exchange\nrisk related to all relending will be borne by the Government.\nThe  Government  will  retain  $0.6  million  equivalent  for\ndeveloping implementing regulations for the Energy Law.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2006\nExecuting Agency Barki Tajik, the state-owned power company\nImplementation Barki  Tajik  has  established  a  project  implementation  unit,\nArrangements headed  by  a  project  manager,  to  coordinate  project\nimplementation  activities  and  to  liaise  with  ADB  and  the\ncofinanciers. Project implementation will be coordinated with\nthe  local  United  Nations  office  to  ensure  safe  working\nconditions.\nProcurement All  goods  and  services  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be\nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nProcurement. Contract packages financed by the cofinanciers\nwill be procured using their procedures.\nConsulting Services The consultants will be recruited by the Government and Barki\nTajik  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on\nthe engagement of domestic consultants. The consulting input\nwill  comprise  (i)  for  project  implementation,  106  person-\nmonths of international and 110 person-months of domestic\nconsultants;  (ii)  for  auditing  of  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  corporate  and\nproject  accounts,  6  person-months  of  international  and  15\nperson-months  of  domestic  consultants;  and  (iii)  for\ndeveloping implementing regulations for the Energy Law, 17\nperson-months  of  international  and  7  person-months  of\ndomestic consultants.\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date 31 December 2005\nBenefits and Beneficiaries The  Project  will  improve  power  supply  availability  and\nreliability  to  about  172,000  households  and  facilities  in\nTajikistan. Part A of the Project will provide adequate and", "iv\nreliable  electricity  to  about  24,000  mostly  poor  returnee\nhouseholds in war-damaged areas, where 96 percent of the\npeople  live  below  the  national  poverty  line.  Returnee\nhousehold heads typically work in collective farms receiving\nseasonal incomes of about $1-5 per month and supplement\ntheir income through home plots, livestock, and small-scale\nretail trade. Adequate electricity supply, especially in winter,\nwill  improve  heating,  supply  of  safe  drinking  water,  and\neducation  and  health  services,  and  will  allow  the\nestablishment  of  small  industries.  This  will  have  positive\neffects  on  health,  productivity,  and  income-earning\nopportunities.  The  impact  will  be  particularly  positive  for\nvulnerable  groups  such  as  women  and  children  who  are\nprimarily responsible for collecting alternative fuels such as\nfuelwood and biomass. Part B will remove the risk of a major\npower  supply  breakdown  in  Tajikistan,  by  funding  urgently\nneeded rehabilitation work in the country's largest hydropower\nplant, thus benefiting the whole economy. The restructuring of\nthe  energy  sector,  enhancement  of  cost  recovery  through\nelectricity prices, and restructuring and commercialization of\nBarki Tajik will improve sector governance, reduce losses, and\nstrengthen Barki Tajik's financial position. Part C will reinforce\nelectricity distribution in Dushanbe region where 72 percent of\nthe households live below the national poverty line. This will\nsupport  economic  recovery  in  this  region.  The  financial\ninternal rate of return of the Project is 7.7 percent, and the\neconomic internal rate of return is 28.0 percent. About 57\npercent of the project's net economic benefits (not considering\nsome indirect benefits) will go to the poor.\nTechnical Assistance A  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  of  $500,000  equivalent,\nfinanced  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the\nGovernment of Japan, will be used to design and implement a\nbilling and collection system to help Barki Tajik reduce its\naccounts  receivable.  Another  TA  grant  of    $500,000\nequivalent, financed from the Japan Special Fund, funded by\nthe  Government  of  Japan,  will  help  Barki  Tajik  introduce\ninternational accounting standards and prepare its corporate\naccounts  for  fiscal  year  2001.  The  TA  consultants  will  be\nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on\nthe engagement of domestic consultants.", "v", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Power  Rehabilitation  Project.

INTRODUCTION\n2. Tajikistan ranks among the poorest countries in the world and is the poorest of the\nformer Soviet Union (FSU) economies, with a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997\nof $178. In terms of the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s human development index,1\nin 1999 Tajikistan ranked 108 of 174 countries surveyed. Of the population, 83 percent live\nbelow the poverty line and 33 percent live in absolute poverty. Six years of civil conflict and\nnatural disasters have severely damaged the infrastructure in the energy sector, particularly in\nrural areas. In addition, the conflict has resulted in resources being diverted from much needed\nrehabilitation. In the face of the energy crisis,2 the Government has taken initial measures to\nreform the energy sector. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting these\nreforms through a program loan accompanied by TA.3\n3. In  1998,  the  Government  requested  ADB\u2019s  financial  assistance  to  rehabilitate  and\nstrengthen critical generation, transmission, and distribution systems of Barki Tajik, the state-\nowned power company. In response, ADB provided TA4 in 1999 to examine the feasibility of\ninvestment programs as the basis of a project that could be supported by ADB. Following\ncompletion  of  the  project  preparation  studies  including  a  priority  plan  for  rehabilitating  the\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution systems, the Appraisal Mission5 visited Tajikistan in\nAugust 2000 to discuss the Project with the Government and Barki Tajik. The primary objective\nof the Project is poverty reduction through (i) improving reliability of power supply throughout the\nyear; (ii) improving the quality of life of poor rural communities by making electricity available for\nheating, lighting, and cooking; (iii) improving health and education facilities by making electricity\navailable for heating, lighting, and refrigeration; (iv) facilitating the creation of income generating\nopportunities for small private enterprises and agriculture by improving irrigation; (v) saving time\nfor poor rural households who must search for alternative fuels;6 and (vi) introducing sector\nreforms to ensure increased access to affordable electricity for the poor. About 79 percent of the\nbeneficiaries are expected to be the poor living below the poverty line. The Project framework is\nin Appendix 1.\n                  \n1  A measure of meeting basic human needs that comprises: (i) life expectancy at birth, (ii) adult literacy rate, (iii)\nschool enrolment rate, and (iv) real GDP per capita.\n2  Most parts of the country do not have adequate electricity throughout the year, especially in winter.\n3 Loan 1651-TAJ: Postconflict Infrastructure Program, for $20 million, and TA 3114-TAJ: Institutional Strengthening\nof the Transport and Energy Sectors, for $1.5 million, both approved on 10 December 1998.\n4  TA 3207-TAJ: Power Sector Development Project, for  $840,000, approved on 17 June 1999.\n5  The Mission comprised S. Vivekananda (Mission Leader-Senior Energy Specialist), J. Ordo\u00f1a (Senior Financial\nAnalyst), P. Abeygunawardena (Senior Economist for Environment), L. Campbell (Senior Counsel), B. Coleman\n(Program Economist), and S. Tamondong (Poverty Reduction Coordinator).\n6  Fuelwood (collection takes up to 15 days to provide a month\u2019s supply) and biomass (cow dung briquettes are made\none hour each day in summer to provide for the winter supply). The use of biomass for fuel also reduces its\navailability as fertilizer and results in the decline of soil fertility.", "2\nIII. BACKGROUND\n4. The dissolution of the FSU and the subsequent civil war in Tajikistan have had severe\nsocial and economic consequences for the country in general, and for the project area of\nKhatlon Region in the south in particular. The war, the general economic crisis, and the loss of\nsocial services have caused a drastic deterioration in the living conditions of most of the\npopulation. GDP contracted by about 60 percent in the six years following independence in\n1991. Unemployment, virtually nonexistent before independence, increased to an estimated\n30 percent in 1999.7 Thirty-three percent of the population live in absolute poverty, based on a\nmonthly per capita income of TJR10,000 ($5.9). The average per capita monthly income of\nTJR12,3908 ($7.3) buys less than half of the minimum consumption basket. As a consequence,\nthe human development index for Tajikistan, estimated by the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), fell from 0.63 in 1991 to 0.54 in 1998.9 The Government places a high\npriority on poverty reduction as demonstrated by its policy on social expenditures and by\ndrafting a national poverty reduction strategy (para. 23).\n5. Khatlon Region is the poorest area of the country. Its poverty rate of 96 percent exceeds\nthe national average10 (Table 1). Khatlon was the site of the worst fighting and devastation of\nthe civil war. Beyond the terrible loss of life and human suffering caused by the war,11 much of\nthe infrastructure, private homes, and other property were destroyed or severely damaged.\nTable 1: Key Human Development Indicators\nIndicator Khatlon Region Tajikistan\nPoverty Incidence (%) 96 83\nPopulation Growth Rate (%) 3.5 2.0\nMaternal Mortality Rate per 100,000 live births 115 88\nPopulation per Doctor 932 491\nEducation Enrollment Rate, age 7-23 (%) 61 68\nLife Expectancy at Birth (years) 68.8 68.4\n                  Source:  Tajikistan - Human Development Report (1999)\n6. The civil war and the economic crisis caused tax revenues to decline. As a result, the\nGovernment\u2019s ability to maintain basic infrastructure, including that of the energy sector, was\nseverely strained. Due to the poor condition of the existing infrastructure, power outages are\ncommon. This affects agricultural, commercial, and industrial consumers, which leads to lower\nproduction, higher production costs, and loss of income.\n7. In  winter,  when  energy  supply  is  crucial,  most  rural  villages  have  insufficient  and\nunreliable electricity supply. Major towns fare somewhat better, but daily outages of 3-6 hours\nare common especially in winter. The poor quality of electricity supply in turn reduces the quality\nof life of residential consumers. The restricted supply limits basic necessities like cooking and\nheating  in  winter  and  constrains  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  provide  health,  social,  and\neducational  services  in  rural  areas.  Hence,  improving  electricity  supply  services  will  have\npositive effects on the health and nutrition of the poor in the project areas, which will in turn\n                  \n7 The official unemployment rate was 3.2 percent in 1998 and 3.1 percent in 1999. However, these statistics\nunderestimate  actual  unemployment  because  (i)  they  do  not  account  for  substantial  unemployment  and\nunderemployment in inactive state-owned enterprises and in rural areas, (ii) many of the unemployed have not\nregistered, and (iii) there is a continuing repatriation of refugees as well as demobilization of opposition fighters.\n8  United Nations Development Programme's and World Bank's Tajjikistan Living Standards Survey, May 1999.\n9  The human development index for Kazakhstan is 0.67, Kyrgyz Republic 0.70, and Uzbekistan 0.69.\n10World Bank\u2019s Tajikistan Poverty Assessment, June 2000.\n11The war claimed over 60,000 lives and created 700,000 refugees. About 26,000 families lost their male heads of\nhousehold, and 55,000 children were orphaned.", "3\nimprove  their  economic  productivity.  Economic  productivity  will  also  be  improved  because\nelectricity is a necessary input to many small enterprises.\n8. Although the poverty rate in the region around the capital, Dushanbe, is below the\nnational average, it is a high 72 percent.12 The Dushanbe region could be Tajikistan\u2019s primary\ngrowth vehicle and absorb a large portion of the unemployed workforce. Reliable and efficient\npower supply is essential for the Government efforts to achieve macroeconomic stabilization\nand economic recovery. Given the urgent need to overcome power supply constraints and\nincrease the efficiency of supply and use of electricity, priority is being given in the medium term\nto  retrofitting  and  rehabilitating  existing  power  facilities,  especially  those  that  can  provide\nelectricity  throughout  the  year  (e.g.,  the  Nurek  Hydropower  Plant  [NHPP]  and  the  Central\nHydropower Plant [CHPP]). The current situation provides a good opportunity to reduce poverty\nby rehabilitating the power supply facilities and restructuring the sector.\nA.  The Energy Sector\n1.  Overview\n9. In Tajikistan, hydropower supplies 90 percent of energy produced and, hence, plays an\nimportant role in the economy. The potential for hydropower is estimated at 527 terawatt hours\n(TWh), of which only about 19 TWh (4 percent) is utilized. The extensive mountain ranges, such\nas the Pamir and Fan mountains, which are among the highest in the world, have a layer of\nglaciers that melts in the summer, resulting in extensive flow of water. During 1995 to 1998 this\nproduced on average an electric power surplus of about 4.2 TWh in summer, which used to be\nexported mostly to Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. In winter, there was on average\na net deficit of about 1.0 TWh for the same period, which was met by imports from Kyrgyz\nRepublic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n10. Because of the seasonal nature of hydropower resources, the country depends on\nimported oil, gas, and coal to meet its energy requirements. In 1999, energy imports totaled\n$103 million while exports (primarily electricity) amounted to $17.5 million. Net energy imports\nare expected to increase as the domestic demand for imported fuels rises with the acceleration\nof economic recovery. Prospects for increasing electricity exports are limited in the short to\nmedium  term  because  of  the  decline  in  electricity  demand  in  the  neighboring  countries.\nMeasures to promote efficient use of electricity and to increase domestic oil, gas, and coal\nproduction are vital to improving the country\u2019s overall balance of payments.\n11. The country\u2019s future energy production and trade will depend on a number of factors,\nincluding (i) the rate of economic recovery of Tajikistan and the neighboring countries; (ii) the\ntrading arrangements negotiated with the neighboring countries; and (iii) the country\u2019s ability to\nattract private sector financing to develop domestic coal, oil, natural gas, and hydroelectric\npower  resources.  Regional  energy  trade  will  continue  to  be  important  for  Tajikistan,  and\nnegotiated long-term contracts for power exports on equitable terms are a high priority for the\nGovernment.\n2.  Energy Supply and Demand\n12. At the beginning of the 1990s, about two-thirds of Tajikistan's primary energy supplies\ncame from imports, mainly petroleum products and natural gas from Uzbekistan. In 1991, net\nimports amounted to 1.58 million tons of petroleum products, 1.76 billion cubic meters of natural\n                  \n12 Based on information provided by the State Statistical Office at appraisal.", "4\ngas, 1.2 TWh of electricity, and 375,000 tons of coal. By 1999, because of reduced economic\nactivity due to the civil war and import price increases to international levels, net imports of\nprimary energy had fallen sharply to around one third of total supplies. In 1999, Tajikistan had\nnet imports of 300,000 tons of petroleum products and 0.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas,\nand net exports of 0.18 TWh of electricity.13\n13. Between 1991 and 1999, domestic energy consumption fell from about 7.8 million tons\nof oil equivalent (toe) to about 3.0 million toe. The economic slowdown also caused a change in\nthe consumption pattern. In 1991, residential consumers accounted for 29 percent, industry for\n40 percent, water supply and agriculture for 19 percent, and others for 12 percent. In 1999,\nresidential energy consumption increased to 36 percent, while industrial consumption remained\nat 40 percent, water supply and agriculture dropped slightly to 17 percent, and others dropped\nto 7 percent. In 1999, the per capita domestic energy consumption was about 0.5 toe. This was\nabout  20  percent  higher  than  the  average  for  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries,  partly\nbecause of the relatively low end-use efficiency and high heating requirements during winter.\nWith the rise in prices of imported fuel toward international levels during the past few years,\nhouseholds switched to electricity, generated mainly by hydropower plants, for heating and\ncooking. This partly accounts for the decrease of coal consumption from 690,000 tons in 1991\nto 16,000 tons in 1999; and that of petroleum products from 1.68 million tons to 323,000 tons.\n14. After a substantial decrease in electricity consumption due mainly to the effect of the civil\nwar and the related drop in industrial production, electricity consumption in Tajikistan has begun\nto rise again, by 24 percent in 1998 and 6.5 percent in 1999. Despite this, the 1999 sales of\n13.3  TWh  of  electricity  sales  were  still  significantly  below  the  levels  in  the  early  1990s\n(18.0 TWh). Future demand growth will depend on industrial and agricultural production. GDP is\nestimated to have grown by 3.7 percent in 1999, and is expected to grow further at 5.0 percent\nper year in 2000 and 2001, and 6.0 percent in 2002.14 The expansion of the economy will put\nupward pressure on power demand.\n3.  Power System\n15. Tajikistan\u2019s power system comprises three separate power grids, the north, south, and\nGorno-Badakhshan systems, which are operated by Barki Tajik (Map). The installed capacity\ntotals  4,354  megawatts  (MW),  including  4,000  MW  of  hydropower  capacity.15  The  annual\naverage power generation of the hydropower plants is about 15.0 TWh. Although part of the\nnorthwestern Gorno-Badakhshan system is connected to the south system around Dushanbe\nthrough 110 kilovolt (kV) and 35 kV transmission lines, it is considered separate from an\noperational  point  of  view.  The  northern  region  is  the  most  industrially  developed  part  of\nTajikistan but has only one hydropower plant, Kairrakumskaya (126 MW). This plant on the Syr\nDarya (river) operates for irrigation in summer to meet the agriculture demands of Kazakhstan,\nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan, and generates limited power during winter. Therefore, Tajikistan\npurchases power from Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan to meet the power\ndeficit. The north system is not connected directly to the main grid in the south but through the\nUzbekistan  power  network,  which  results  in  expensive  wheeling  charges  and  significant\ntechnical losses. North Tajikistan therefore suffers from acute power deficits and depends on\npower supply from Uzbekistan. To reduce Tajikistan's reliance on such arrangements, a north-\nsouth connection would be ideal, but the high mountain ranges make its construction difficult\nand expensive.\n                  \n13 Net exports of electricity have dropped in recent years with the decline in electricity demand in neighboring\ncountries.\n14CER:TAJ 2000-03. ADB\u2019s Tajikistan: Country Economic Report, April 2000.\n15 North system - 130 MW; south system - 4,194 MW; and Gorno-Badakhshan system - 30 MW.", "5\n16. All major hydropower plants in the south are on the Vaksh River. NHPP with 3,000 MW\nof installed capacity is the largest in Central Asia and generates electricity throughout the year.\nIt was constructed in stages from 1962 to 1979, and regulates the Vaksh River flow for irrigation\nneeds in the Amu Darya basin countries (Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) during the growing\nseason  (May  to  July).  Baipinskaya  hydropower  plant  supplies  600  MW  and  has  been  in\noperation since 1985. The Vaksh cascade, with 3 hydropower plants (including CHPP), provides\n285 MW and has been in operation since the early 1960s. The Varzob cascade with three small\nhydropower plants provides 25 MW in total and was built during 1932-1952.\n17. Tajikistan has only two combined heat and power plants, with a total installed capacity of\n346 MW. Both are in the south system. One, at Yavan, was closed in 1997 while the second, at\nDushanbe, operates only in winter, mainly to supply district heating to the city.\n18. The Gorno-Badakhshan power system is much less developed than the north and south\nsystems. It covers the eastern mountainous part of Tajikistan (comprising about 46 percent of\nthe country\u2019s territory), serves 216,000 people, and consists of several isolated network systems\nand small and mini-hydropower plants with total installed capacity of about 30 MW. The largest\nhydropower plants are Pamir 1 (14 MW) and Khorog (7 MW).\n19. Prior to the break-up of the FSU, Tajikistan\u2019s power system was operated as part of the\nelectricity pool of Central Asia,16 and was instrumental in providing peak capacity and reserve to\nregulate  voltage  and  frequency  in  the  region.  Tajikistan  supplied  the  region  with  low  cost\nhydroelectric power and received imports of oil and gas through net resource transfers. The\nchanges in trading relations and energy supply requirements among the neighboring countries\nafter their independence have complicated their energy sector operations. Hence, Tajikistan,\nwhich used to generate about 4.2 TWh of excess electric power during the summer, is usually\nnot able to export all its surplus power to offset imports during the winter period. Therefore, ADB\nis encouraging through TA,17 regional cooperation for power transfers between electricity grids\nof the Central Asian republics to optimize use of their power generation sources and improve\nthe stability and reliability of their power systems.\n20. Tajikistan has 4,268 kilometers (km) of power transmission lines, comprising 226 km of\nhigh voltage 500 kV lines, 1,203 km of 220 kV lines, and 2,839 km of 110 kV lines. The\ndistribution system consists of 35 kV, 10 kV and 6 kV lines, and of low voltage (0.4 kV) lines.\nThe power system has continued to provide electricity during the transition years to support vital\neconomic sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture. Power outages are scheduled on a\nrotational basis for urban and rural households, particularly during winter, due to nonavailability\nof generating plant and lack of water resources for power generation. With a lack of spare parts\nand funds for maintenance, power cuts are becoming more frequent.\n4.  Energy Pricing\n21. The historical and current fuel and electricity prices in Tajikistan are summarized in\ntables 2 and 3. Prices of petroleum products, natural gas, and coal for industry are now largely\nat international market levels, with import prices being passed on to consumers. This price\nliberalization is in line with the Government\u2019s general policy of eliminating distortions caused by\nthe former command economy and reducing the state\u2019s role. However, electricity prices remain\nunder  Government  control  and  have  been  kept  artificially  low  and  structured  in  favor  of\n                  \n16 The main 110 kV, 220 kV and 500 kV transmission lines were linked for synchronous operation of the power\nsystems of Kyrgyz Republic, South Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n17 TA 5818-REG: Regional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia, for $1,350,000, approved on 11 December 1998.", "6\nresidential consumers because of the Government\u2019s concern about inflation and consumers\u2019\nability to pay. The current economic situation has made the adjustment of electricity prices\ndifficult for the customers to bear, thus contributing to the accumulation of accounts receivable\nand underrecovery of costs. This has led to distorted consumption patterns, inequitable pricing\namong some consumer categories, and deteriorating financial condition of the energy supply\nutilities. Under the second enhanced structural adjustment facility18 of the International Monetary\nFund  (IMF)  and  ADB\u2019s  Postconflict  Infrastructure  Program  Loan  (PCIPL),  the  Government\nagreed to raise energy tariffs to improve cost recovery. ADB has had extensive policy dialogue\nwith the Government to reduce energy utilities' accounts receivable and improve revenues to\nrecover the cost of operation and maintenance (paras. 38-44).\nTable 2: Fuel Prices in Tajikistan\n      1997    1998      1999       2000 (August)\n       $   TJR     $   TJR     $   TJR     $        TJR\nGasoline (per liter) 0.34 183 0.24 183 0.35 427 0.40 800\nDiesel (per liter) 0.22 120 0.15 120 0.19 226 0.33 650\nKerosene (per liter) 0.19 100 0.13 100 0.21 250 0.27 540\nLPG (per cubic meter) 0.65 350 0.45 350 0.58 700 0.67 1,340\nNatural Gas\nDomestic (per person) 0.83 450 0.58 450 0.75 900 0.80 1,600\nIndustry (per 1,000 cubic meters) 64.94 35,000 51.48 40,000 66.28 80,000 52.10 104,000\nImport Price (per 1,000 cubic meters) 56.21 30,000 56.21 44,000 51.10 62,000 51.10 102,000\nExchange Rate (TJR/$) 539 777 1,207 2,000\nSource:  Staff estimates.\nTable 3: Electricity Prices in Tajikistan\n1997 1998 1999 2000 (August)\nUS\u00a2/kWh TJR/kWh US\u00a2/kWh TJR/kWh US\u00a2/kWh TJR/kWh US\u00a2/kWh   TJR/kWh\nResidential 0.04 0.20 0.06 0.50      -      -       -         -\n< 150 kWh           -      -      -      - 0.21 2.50 0.25   5.00\n> 150 kWh           -      -      -      - 0.70 8.50 0.55 11.00\nIndustry\n        TADAZ 1.35 7.28 0.63 4.90 0.63 7.60 0.63 12.60\n        Others 1.35 7.28 0.94 7.30 0.94   11.34 0.94 18.80\nCommercial 2.00    10.78 1.35   10.49 1.35   16.29 1.35 27.00\nAgriculture 1.50 8.09 1.35   10.49 1.35   16.29 1.35 27.00\nWater Supply/Govt. 0.09 0.50 0.06 0.50 0.21 2.50 0.13   2.50\nExchange Rate (TJR/$) 5.39  777    1,207     2,000\n- = not applicable; Govt. = Government; TADAZ = Tajik Aluminum Smelter.\nSource:  Staff estimates.\n5.  Institutional and Regulatory Framework\n22. The key oversight agencies in the energy sector are Barki Tajik for electricity and district\nheating supply; Tajik Committee for Oil and Gas (Tajikneft) for oil and gas exploration and\nproduction;  Naftrason19  for  petroleum  products  importation  and  distribution;  and\nTajikkommunservice for natural gas importation and distribution and district heating (except in\nKhujand and Dushanbe, which are under Barki Tajik). The State Committee on Industrial Affairs\n                  \n18 Now called Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.\n19 Formerly known as Tajikneftprodukt.", "7\nis in charge of coal mining, and the Geology Department (Tajikglavgeolia) is responsible for\nmineral resources exploration at a national level.  The Fuel and Energy Department of the\nPresident\u2019s Office is responsible for the overall supervision of the energy sector, and has\nauthority  over  the  above  agencies.  Each  agency  reports  directly  to  the  Fuel  and  Energy\nDepartment.  Since  the  energy  sector  is  important,  and  the  department  is  significantly\nunderstaffed,  its  capacity  to  effectively  coordinate  policies  of  the  energy  sector  is  limited.\nTherefore, the Government will establish a Ministry of Energy (MOE), by 25 December 2000 to\neffectively oversee and coordinate policy matters for the sector (Supplementary Appendix A).\nB.  Government Plans and Policies\n23. The Government places a high priority on poverty reduction as demonstrated by (i) its\npolicy of maintaining social expenditures at 22 percent of the Government budget, (ii) launching\nthe drafting of a poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) with the World Bank and IMF in March\n2000, and (iii) holding a seminar in May 2000 to discuss the results of the World Bank\u2019s poverty\nassessment study. By Presidential Decree of 24 March 2000, a special working group was\ncreated to begin work on the PRSP, which eventually will be the national poverty reduction\nstrategy. This working group includes leading Tajik academics and deputy ministers, and is\nscheduled to complete its assignment in the first half of 2001. The Government has requested\nADB to collaborate in this effort by carrying out additional focused poverty studies, providing\ninputs into the final PRSP, and assisting the Government to develop a poverty monitoring\nmechanism.\n24. The  Government  recognizes  the  need  to  expand  and  diversify  Tajikistan\u2019s  energy\nsystem to supply reliable, efficient, and affordable energy to more people, support poverty\nreduction, improve the standard of living, and bring economic development to rural areas. To\nthat end, the Government has adopted a strategy addressing policy and institutional reforms,\nand rehabilitating and adequately maintaining the existing power systems. The sector policies\nare designed to (i) facilitate the development of a legal and regulatory framework for efficient\noperations (by 2002), (ii) increase the level of electricity tariffs toward full cost recovery (by\n2004), (iii) encourage private sector participation in the generation and supply of power (by\nenacting the Energy Law in October 2000), and (iv) promote energy conservation (by 2001).\n25. A sound policy and regulatory framework is a prerequisite for more efficient public sector\noperations and greater private sector participation in energy production and delivery services.\nThe Government recognizes the need to limit its involvement to policy and regulatory activities.\nResponsibility for energy policy, planning, and oversight of energy enterprises is to be assumed\nby the proposed MOE, which is to be staffed with an adequate number of qualified personnel.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n26. External assistance to the energy sector has been limited. The World Bank\u2019s Post\nConflict Emergency Reconstruction Project, which was approved in 1998, allocated $1.9 million\nfor rehabilitation of damaged energy infrastructure, and the European Union provided in 1998 a\nTA to help develop the energy sector strategy and undertake feasibility studies on bankable\nenergy projects. In addition, the Aga Khan Foundation extended in 1996 financial assistance of\n$12 million for completion of the Pamir I and II hydropower plants. In March 2000, the Aga Khan\nFoundation, International Finance Corporation, and Government reached a general agreement\nto establish a privately owned company that will operate the 14 MW Pamir II hydropower plant\nand the electrical system in Gorno-Badakhsan Region. The company will be granted a 15-year\nconcession and will have a high degree of autonomy. The Swiss Agency for Development and\nCooperation has supported the Aga Khan Foundation with funding for 9 micro-hydroelectric", "8\nprojects in Gorno-Badakhshan Region. The United Nations Office for Project Services has\nimplemented  13  micro  projects  involving  rehabilitation  of  war-damaged  property  and\ninfrastructure in Khatlon Region for a budget of $0.2 million. In late 1999, the Kuwait Fund\napproved a TA grant of $0.4 million to examine the rehabilitation of the power distribution\nsystem in Dushanbe, and will follow up with a distribution rehabilitation project for Dushanbe in\n2002 for $15 million.\n27. ADB  has  been  coordinating  its  operations  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  energy  sector  with  other\nagencies, particularly the World Bank and IMF. ADB's PCIPL and IMF's Poverty Reduction\nGrowth Facility have common conditionalities to the Government and Barki Tajik, and the\nproposed Project incorporates similar or updated conditions.\nD. Lessons Learned\n28. ADB\u2019s experience in the energy sector in Tajikistan is limited. With regard to policy\naspects, under the PCIPL it was noted that restructuring of the energy sector in transition\neconomies requires considerable time and effort and that some policy reforms under the PCIPL\nhad unrealistic targets and time frames. The proposed Project will be the first loan project in the\npower sector,  but it draws on ADB's  experience in providing  rehabilitation  assistance  to other\ncountries in transition such as the Kyrgyz Republic20 and Mongolia.21 The major lessons learned\nabout project planning and implementation in such countries include (i) the need for human\nresource development, capacity building, and training; (ii) the shortage of counterpart financing;\nand (iii) the lack of familiarity with the policies and practices of multilateral financing agencies. In\nparticular, ADB experience has shown that it takes considerable time and effort to restructure,\ncorporatize and commercialize, and achieve full cost recovery in an economy that is undergoing\ntransformation.  ADB  projects  have  had  front-end  delays  in  implementation  due  to  the\ngovernments' unfamiliarity with ADB procedures. Human resource development, assistance with\nestablishing the legal framework for restructuring, setting realistic targets for cost recovery and\nfinancial performance, and familiarization with procurement and disbursement policies of ADB\nand cofinanciers will therefore be an integral part of the Project. To overcome local counterpart\nfunding constraints, policy dialogue is focused on improving Barki Tajik\u2019s financial situation.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sectoral Strategy\n29. ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy (IOS) for Tajikistan was approved by ADB's Board of\nDirectors in October 1998.22 Facilitating the transition to a market economy is the principal\nobjective of the strategy. In the near term, this objective will entail (i) supporting macroeconomic\nand  sectoral  policy  reforms,  (ii)  facilitating  the  country\u2019s  transition  to  a  market  economy,\n(iii)  assisting  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  postconflict  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  efforts,  and\n(iv) supporting natural disaster rehabilitation. ADB\u2019s assistance will be provided to support policy\nreforms, institution building, and investment operations.\n30. Because of ADB\u2019s comparative advantage at the sector level, the objectives of\nthe IOS will be achieved through sector operations. Given ADB\u2019s resource constraints, the IOS\nand  ADB\u2019s  country  assistance  program  focus  on  a  few  priority  sectors  to  maximize  the\ndevelopment impact. In view of the Government\u2019s development priorities and the activities of\n                  \n20 Loan 1443 -KYZ: Power and District Heating Rehabilitating Project, for $30 million, approved on 6 June 1996.\n21 Loan 1152-MON (SF): Egiin Hydropower Project, for $3.8 million, approved on 9 January 1992; Loan 1334-MON:\nPower Rehabilitation Project,  for  $40  million,  approved  on  19  November  1994;  Loan  1492-  MON: Energy\nConservation Project, for $10 million, approved on 26 November 1996; and Loan 1548-MON:Ulaanbaatar Heat\nEfficiency Project, for $40 million, approved on 25 September 1997.\n22 IN.253-98: ADB\u2019s Economic Report and Interim Operational Strategy for Tajikistan, November 1998.", "9\nother aid agencies, ADB assistance in the near term will concentrate on three priority areas:\n(i) infrastructure rehabilitation, especially power and roads; (ii) agriculture and agro-processing;\nand (iii) education, health, and social protection. Involvement in these sectors builds on ADB\u2019s\ncomparative advantage as ADB has gained significant experience from its operations in other\nCentral Asian republics and Mongolia.\n31. In the energy sector, the power subsector will be the focus of ADB assistance. ADB will\nassist  the  Government  to  implement  sector  reforms  and  rehabilitate  the  deteriorating\ninfrastructure.  ADB  operations  aim  at  (i)  establishing  an  efficient  policy  and  regulatory\nframework;  (ii)  fostering  commercialization  and  privatization  of  state-owned  enterprises;\n(iii)  encouraging  private  sector  involvement  in  energy  production  and  delivery  services;\n(iv) increasing revenues of energy providers by phasing out electricity subsidies, improving\ncollection  of  electricity  payments,  and  installing  meters  for  all  energy  consumers;\n(v) rehabilitating existing infrastructure and improving maintenance operations; (vi) developing\nthe necessary human skills; and (vii) strengthening government institutions to achieve good\ngovernance. Considering the economy\u2019s state of transition and the uncertain demand in the\nnear term for electricity from importing countries, long-range investment planning is still difficult.\nThe immediate priority is rehabilitation of facilities, which are in serious condition. In many\nhouseholds, electricity consumption is not metered, and users are charged on the basis of the\nnumber of rooms. This does not provide sufficient incentive to conserve electricity, leading to\ninefficient electricity consumption. There is also a need to assist Barki Tajik to attain financial\nsustainability by improving billing and collection to reduce accounts receivable and by adjusting\nelectricity tariffs to achieve full cost recovery.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n32. ADB's policy dialogue with the Government has focused on strengthening the ongoing\npolicy  reform  initiatives,  defining  further  areas  of  institutional  reform,  and  assisting\nimplementation  of  reforms.  These  include  market-oriented  policy  and  regulatory  reforms,\ninstitutional strengthening of Barki Tajik, and measures to reach full cost recovery and financial\nsustainability of Barki Tajik.\n1. Policy and Regulatory Framework\n33. The  Government\u2019s  regulatory  role  in  the  energy  sector  is  essentially  limited  to  the\ndetermination of tariffs and technical matters. Recognizing the important role of the energy\nsector in the economic recovery, the Government expects the sector to become increasingly\nself-financing,  thus  reducing  demands  on  the  national  budget.  However,  this  needs  to  be\nmatched by a strengthened role of the Government in sector regulation. In its efforts to develop\na clear and well-defined policy and legal framework, the Government issued the Energy Sector\nPolicy Statement (ESPS) in 1998 emphasizing its commitment to market-based reforms through\nexplicit policies and guidelines for defining its function as regulator. The ESPS envisaged\nrestructuring the energy sector to (i) increase the role of the private sector in providing services,\n(ii) improve management efficiency and cost recovery of enterprises that remain under state\ncontrol, and (iii) allow market-based pricing. Under the policy reform agenda of PCIPL, the\nGovernment was to enact an energy law that would restructure the energy sector, introduce\nmarket-oriented  reforms,  reduce  its  involvement  as  an  investor  in  the  sector,  enhance  its\nregulatory  functions,  facilitate  private  sector  involvement  in  developing  domestic  energy\nresources, and unify the energy subsectors to improve management efficiency by establishing\nthe  MOE.  The  Government  was  to  have  made  substantial  progress  in  these  reforms  by\nDecember 1999 but actual progress has been much slower because of the difficult economic\nsituation, political developments, national elections between November 1999 and March 2000,", "10\nand  the  rather  ambitious  targets  and  time  frame  envisaged  for  the  reform  agenda.  The\nGovernment nevertheless remains committed to carry out the reform agenda. To enable this,\nthe  time  period  for  various  actions  under  the  PCIPL-supported  reform  agenda  has  been\nextended by adopting the Energy Sector Action Plan (ESAP, Appendix 2) formulated with ADB\nassistance. In accordance with the ESAP, the Energy Law was enacted in October 2000 and\nthe MOE will be fully established by December 2000.23 Other actions such as developing\ncharters and implementing regulations for the Energy Law are expected to follow with help from\nconsultants to be financed under the proposed loan.\n2.  Governance Reforms\n34. The ESPS emphasizes the importance of facilitating privatization of energy enterprises.\nAt present, energy enterprises are either directly state owned, or are in the form of a joint-stock\ncompany. Since 1999, the Government has been creating business units from some of the\npower generation and distribution subsidiaries, with ownership rights vested directly in the State\nProperty  Committee  on  behalf  of  the  Government  but  with  business  management\nresponsibilities assigned to Barki Tajik. The Government has begun restructuring Barki Tajik as\npart of its plan to eventually privatize it. Under ADB TA (footnote 3), the Government prepared\ntime-bound action plans to corporatize and commercialize key agencies in the energy sector,\nnamely Barki Tajik (Appendix 2), Tajikkommunservice, and Naftrason.  A corporate charter for\nBarki Tajik is to be adopted by December 2001. Elsewhere in the energy sector, greater\nprogress has been made, for example in privatizing state-owned gasoline stations.\n3.  Program Loan\n35. Under the PCIPL, a total of 30 policy reform measures were to be completed during\nJanuary 1999 to December 2000. Of these measures, 11 were required to be fulfilled as\nconditions for the release of the second tranche. As of loan negotiations (6-8 November 2000),\nthe overall compliance of the policy reform measures was 14 out of 30 measures and for\nsecond tranche conditions, 8 out of 11 conditions. Another three policy reform measures are\nexpected to be complied with by December 2000.\n36. With regard to the second tranche release, two conditions relate to transport, one to\nforeign investment, three to gas, and five to electricity (Appendix 3). To date, eight conditions\n(one for foreign investment, two for gas, three for electricity, and two for transport) have been\nmet: (i) issuing amendments to the Foreign Investment Law, (ii) enactment of amendments to\nthe  Transport  Law,  (iii)  enactment  of  the  Energy  Law,  (iv)  implementation  of  a  quarterly\nautomatic tariff adjustment mechanism for electricity to take into account input cost factors that\nare beyond the control of Barki Tajik, (v) achieving 75 percent cost recovery for electricity supply\nto industry and agriculture, (vi) taking measures to ensure that Tajikkommunservice is able to\ngenerate  sufficient  revenue  to  fully  recover  its  operational  costs,  (vii)  implementing  price\nvariations for gas supply to achieve cost recovery, and (viii) completing a comprehensive review\nof the present road financing and cost recovery mechanisms to ensure sufficient revenue is\ngenerated to recover the cost of operation and maintenance (O&M) of roads.\n37. Based on the above, three second tranche conditions remain unfulfilled as of loan\nnegotiations: (i) achieving 50 percent cost recovery of electricity supply to residential consumers\n(at present 23 percent); (ii) implementing measures to ensure that accounts receivable of Barki\nTajik will be at a level of 6 months or less of equivalent electricity sales (for 1999 it was 11\nmonths);  and  (iii)  implementing  measures  to  ensure  that  accounts  receivable  of\n                  \n23 The PCIPL target date for these activities was December 1999.", "11\nTajikkommunservice will be at a level of 3 months or less of equivalent gas sales (for 1999 it\nwas 23 months). These and other remaining policy measures required to be adopted under the\nPCIPL are discussed here.\na.  Cost Recovery for Residential and Industrial Supplies of Electricity\n38. With the benefit of hindsight, the time targets set under the PCIPL for cost recovery were\nnot realistic. For example, full cost recovery was envisaged to be achieved over the two-year\nprogram period 1999 and 2000. Even assuming no further local currency depreciation for the\nrest of 2000, this would necessitate tariff increases in Tajik ruble terms over the 1998 levels by\n5,900 percent for residential consumers and 289 percent for industry.  Such high tariff increase\nrequirements are partly an outcome of the significant devaluation of the Tajik ruble vis-\u00e0-vis the\nUS dollar (from TJR777/$1 in 1998 to TJR2,000 in August 2000) and partly due to the low tariff\nbase in 1998, and are just not feasible in the two-year period originally envisaged.\n39. The  Government  has  nevertheless  made  major  tariff  increases.  Over  the  period\n1 January 1999 to 1 April 2000, residential tariffs were increased by 1,300 percent (in Tajik ruble\nterms), thus achieving an average cost recovery of 23 percent, still below the 50 percent cost\nrecovery stipulated for the second tranche release and the 100 percent recovery required by the\nend  of  the  program  period.  Increases  in  the  other  categories  have  also  been  significant\n(157 percent), resulting in cost recoveries of 100 percent for agriculture (above the 75 percent\nrequired for the second tranche release and meeting the 100 percent target required by the end\nof the program period) and 66 percent for industry. The Government also implemented a\nquarterly automatic tariff adjustment mechanism for electricity from 1 September 2000, taking\ninto  account  input  cost  factors  that  are  beyond  the  control  of  Barki  Tajik  (Supplementary\nAppendix B). Despite having made these large tariff increases, the Government undertook a\nfurther base tariff increase of 51 percent for industry on 1 November 2000 resulting in 75\npercent cost recovery for industry, in line with the target for second tranche release.\n40. Taking into account the current state of the economy, the major tariff increases already\nmade, the electricity consumers\u2019 low ability to pay, and ADB\u2019s experience in other transition\neconomies, the tariff increases required to achieve PCIPL cost recovery targets will require\nmore  time,  particularly  for  residential  consumers.  Realistic  targets  for  achieving  full  cost\nrecovery for industry and residential consumers would be as follows:  (i) 50 percent and 100\npercent  cost  recovery  for  residential  consumers  in  December  2002  and  December  2004\nrespectively, and (ii) 100 percent cost recovery for industrial consumers in December 2001.\nIMF has been consulted on these relaxed targets for cost recovery and has incorporated them\nin the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility for Tajikistan.\n41. Accordingly, the Government will adopt a strategy whereby industrial and residential\ntariffs will be gradually increased to achieve full cost recovery in accordance with the ESAP. In\nformulating its strategy, the Government agreed to adhere to financial covenants for Barki Tajik\non  operating  ratio24  and  rate  of  return  on  net  fixed  assets25  that  would  facilitate  full  cost\nrecovery.  The Government agreed that, to protect poor and vulnerable groups from the impact\nof tariff increases, the lifeline tariff structure will be maintained in the medium term until a\nnational poverty reduction strategy, currently under formulation, is developed.26 Accordingly,\nthere will be no real increase in tariff for the initial consumption of 150 kWh per month for\nresidential consumers.  The lifeline tariff targets mostly the poor whose low purchasing power\n                  \n24 Operating expenses including depreciation divided by operating revenues.\n25 A 6 percent return on net fixed assets is considered appropriate in the medium term.\n26 The strategy will review the need for maintaining the lifeline tariff structure.", "12\nwill limit their consumption while wealthier consumers can be expected to consume more than\n150  kWh  per  month  and  pay  significantly  higher  rates  for  the  extra  consumption.  The\nGovernment also proposes to use the interest margin arising from relending the loan from ADB\nand cofinancing from the Swiss Government to Barki Tajik to fund part of the subsidy for the\nlifeline tariff. If required, the Government will take necessary measures to make up for any\nshortfall in the subsidy.27  Under the ESAP, the Government is to prepare by January 2002\nproposals acceptable to ADB, for an adequate safety net to protect poor and vulnerable groups\nadequately with regard to the impact of tariff increases in the long term.\nb.  Accounts Receivable for Electricity and Gas\n42. Barki  Tajik  has  significant  accounts  receivable,  mainly  from  industrial  customers.\nAlthough its accounts receivable decreased from 13 months of sales in 1998 to 11 months of\nsales in 1999, it will not be able to achieve the second-tranche PCIPL target of 6 months of\nsales in the short term. This is mainly because the Tajik Aluminum Smelter (TADAZ), the\nGovernment-owned aluminum smelting company, which is one of the largest in the world and\naccounts for more than half of the total accounts receivable, cannot clear all its arrears in a\nshort period. The decline in economic conditions has reduced industrial production and delayed\npayments from the industrial sector. TADAZ accounts for 34 percent of the electricity consumed\nand, up to early 1999, the facility was not producing enough to cover its costs and accumulated\nsubstantial  arrears  in  payment.  However,  with  the  Government's  ongoing  restructuring  of\nTADAZ (with the assistance of the International Finance Corporation) and some improvement in\ninternational prices for aluminum, TADAZ is expected to gradually increase its production and\nprofitability levels. Under the recently issued Government Resolution No. 70 of 11 February\n2000, TADAZ was required to restructure its outstanding electricity arrears and to ensure full\npayment hereafter. As a result of the policy dialogue, the Government and TADAZ agreed on a\npayment schedule for June 2000 to December 2002 for liquidating TADAZ\u2019s arrears of $18.3\nmillion equivalent to Barki Tajik.28 In August 2000, TADAZ made two payments to Barki Tajik\ntotaling $3 million. TADAZ has also been making cash payments in full from January 2000 on\nfor its current payables. In accordance with the decree issued in August 2000, Barki Tajik\nstopped barter trading and requires cash payments in full from all consumers in accordance with\nthe ESAP.\n43. Tajikkommunservice\u2019s accounts receivable of 23 months of gas sales are mainly with\nresidential consumers who account for 62 percent of the arrears. Natural gas is used by urban\nhouseholds for cooking, as well as for district heating, mainly for households in urban areas,\nduring  winter.  Tajikkommunservice  has  commenced  implementation  of  a  computer-based\nsystem to monitor residential customer information, produce invoices, and record collections\nwith the aim of reducing its accounts receivable. As a result of the civil war and its impact on the\ncountry\u2019s economy, the Government issued decrees in 1997 to restructure the debts of major\ngas  consuming  enterprises  and  residential  consumers,  with  payment  of  their  debts  being\ndeferred up to 4 years. As a consequence, it will be difficult for Tajikkommunservice to comply in\nthe near term with the second-tranche condition of three months for accounts receivable.\n44. Taking into account the above facts, the lack of management skills and an inadequate\nbilling  and  collection  system  at  Barki  Tajik,  and  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  other  transition\neconomies,  the  PCIPL's  deadline  of  December  2000  for  reducing  Barki  Tajik's  and\nTajikkommunservice's accounts receivable to three months cannot be met. The Government\nprepared a time-bound action plan under the ESAP, extending the period to December 2002.\n                  \n27 The shortfall is estimated at about 1 percent of the Government's current annual budget.\n28 The agreement was confirmed in a letter from TADAZ to the Government dated 21 April 2000.", "13\nTo help in this regard, ADB will provide, in conjunction with the proposed Project, TA for the\ndesign  and  implementation  of  a  billing  and  collection  system  for  Barki  Tajik  (para.  95).\nTajikkommunservice  has  enforced  a  strict  disconnection  policy  for  overdue  accounts  and\noffered  discounts  for  early  payment  since  October  2000.  These  measures  would  allow\nTajikkommunservice to meet the targets set under the ESAP. IMF has agreed to defer the target\nfor accounts receivable of Barki Tajik and Tajikkommunservice to December 2002 and has\naccordingly incorporated them in the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility for Tajikistan.\nc.  Other Action Plans\n45. In addition to the ESAP, the Government provided ADB with action plans for complying\nwith  the  remaining  policy  reform  measures  identified  under  the  PCIPL.29  These  relate  to\ncorporatization and commercialization of large agencies in the energy sector, development of\nimplementing regulations for the Energy Law, and creation of the MOE.30 To the extent the\nadditional policy reform measures relate to the energy sector and go beyond the PCIPL period,\nthe Government has assured ADB that, under the Project, it will implement such measures.\nWith regard to the Project, satisfactory progress has been achieved under the PCIPL by loan\nnegotiations on the legal framework, sector reform, and tariffs to allow further processing of the\nProject.\n4.  Capacity Building\n46. Capacity building in Tajikistan needs to start from the basic levels of defining new\nstructures  and  procedures,  updating  technology  and  skills,  and  improving  corporate\nmanagement. Under the PCIPL, ADB provided TA (footnote 3) for institutional strengthening of\nthe  energy  sector,  particularly  for  implementing  market-oriented  reform  initiatives.  The  TA\nconsultants identified the areas of tariff structure, accounts receivable, billing and collection,\nfinancial management, project management, and power plant O&M as key components for\ncapacity building and training. Under the proposed Project, Barki Tajik will acquire project\nmanagement and benefit monitoring and evaluation skills through on-the-job training with the\nimplementation consultants. MOE staff and government legal officers will undergo on-the-job\ntraining with the consultants retained to assist in developing implementing regulations under the\nEnergy  Law.  Other  priority  areas  of  capacity  building  such  as  billing  and  collection\nimprovements for accounts receivable, introduction of IAS, and financial management will be\naddressed through the two TAs processed parallel to the Project (paras. 95-97).\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n47. The power sector in Tajikistan has been severely affected by the disintegration of the\nFSU in 1990. Since then, construction of new hydropower plants has been halted and the\nmaintenance of existing infrastructure neglected due to lack of funds.  As a result of the poor\neconomic situation of the country and damage caused by the civil war, the present condition of\npower facilities is serious (paras. 6-7). In addition, with the increase in prices of gas and\npetroleum imports, residential consumers have switched to electricity generated by hydropower\n                  \n29Including outstanding policy reform measures in the transport sector.\n30 With compliance of eight second tranche conditions and achieving satisfactory progress on the ESAP and other\naction plans, a progress report is to be circulated to the Board in end November 2000, seeking (i) waiver of full\ncompliance with the 3 outstanding conditions and release of the second tranche of the loan, and (ii) extension of\ntime for compliance with the 3 outstanding second tranche release conditions and 10 outstanding policy reform\nmeasures.", "14\nplants, and use it also for heating. This has placed additional demand on the existing generation\nfacilities. Without improvements in power supply, the living conditions, particularly of the poor,\nwill be miserable as they cannot afford alternative fuels. In addressing poverty reduction, the\nproject design pays special attention to (i) facilitating the creation of employment opportunities\nand additional income for the poor in the project areas, and (ii) improving living standards by\nrehabilitating basic infrastructure.\n48. A reliable and efficient power infrastructure is an important basic requirement for the\nmacroeconomic stabilization and economic recovery efforts of the Government. As the power\nsystem  is  predominantly  hydro-based,  the  actual  generation  and  supply  depend  on  the\nhydrological situation as well as on the condition of power plants, which in general is well below\nfull capacity because of lack of funds for maintenance and spare parts.  Based on GDP\nprojections (para. 14), energy sales are estimated to increase by 2 percent per year up to 2002.\nGiven the urgent need to overcome the power supply constraints and increase the efficiency of\nsupplying and utilizing energy, priority is being given in the medium term to retrofitting and\nrehabilitating existing power facilities, rather than adding new capacity. The Project will therefore\nrehabilitate and reinforce high-priority power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities\nin various parts of the country. Benefits from the Project accruing from 2003 onwards will be\ntimely as energy sales are expected to increase by 3 percent per year in 2003 and 2004, and by\nabout 5 percent per year thereafter.\n49. Better electricity supply will considerably improve irrigation and drainage for agricultural\nproduction, the mainstay of economic activities in the project areas. The availability of electricity\nwill also reduce constraints on the development of cottage and small industries, which have a\nsignificant potential of increasing employment and raising incomes. Better energy supply will\nalso have considerable benefits for the health of the population, particularly the poor.  Drinking\nwater supply and household electrical appliances such as cooking stoves and electric heaters\ndepend on electricity; when it is not available, people, mostly women and children, have to walk\nfar to fetch water and work hard to collect fuelwood. The availability of electricity will improve\ndrainage of farmland thus reducing the risk of malaria, allow the use of piped water for cooking\nand drinking, and improve services at hospitals, health centers, and schools.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n50. The objectives of the Project are to (i) improve the peoples' quality of life, particularly the\npoor,  and  support  poverty  reduction  through  increased  availability  of  electricity;  and\n(ii) assist in the postconflict economic recovery of Tajikistan. This will be achieved by increasing\nthe availability and reliability of power supply in an environment-friendly manner, through the\nrehabilitation of existing generation, transmission, and distribution facilities developed during the\nFSU era.\n51. The  project  components  were  selected  to  provide  a  reliable  and  efficient  power\ninfrastructure to improve the quality of life of the people, support poverty reduction, and assist in\nthe  economic  recovery  of  Tajikistan  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The  Project  has  five\ncomponents (see Map):\n(i)   part A: rehabilitation and power supply improvement in mainly poor areas in Khatlon\nRegion comprises rehabilitation of the\n(a)  15 MW CHPP;", "15\n(b)  power transmission and distribution system, to benefit 24,000 households who\nare mainly poor returnees who were displaced by the civil war;\n(c)  Sovhoz 2 (collective farm) substation in Bishkent District; and\n(d)  telecommunication system;\n(ii)   part B: rehabilitation of NHPP and associated transmission facilities comprises\n(a)  rehabilitation and stabilization of the 220 kV switchyard foundations,\n(b)  rehabilitation and replacement of obsolete 220 kV and 500 kV switchgear and\nprotective relays at the NHPP and Regar substations,\n(c)  excavation of NHPP\u2019s tailrace channel, and\n(d)  monitoring of NHPP's dam safety;\n(iii)  part  C:  improvement  of  power  supply  reliability  in  Dushanbe  region  comprises\nrehabilitation of two main 220 kV substations at Novaya and Djangal;\n(iv)  part D: bulk metering of power supply comprises provision of\n(a)  equipment to meter imports and exports of power, and\n(b)  distribution network metering; and\n(v)  part E: consulting services includes\n(a)  supporting project implementation,\n(b)  auditing Barki Tajik\u2019s corporate and project accounts, and\n(c)  developing implementing regulations for the Energy Law.\nC. Technical Justification\n1.  Part A: Rehabilitation and Power Supply Improvement in Poor Areas in\nKhatlon Region\n52. In addition to the general degradation of power generation, transmission, and distribution\nfacilities  because  of  inadequate  maintenance,  supply  of  electricity  in  Khatlon  Region  has\nsuffered considerably from consequences of the civil war from 1992-1996. The region covers\nmost of the area south of Dushanbe, with a population of more than 2 million. Of 330,000\nhouseholds in the region, about 24,000 households were cut off from power supply due to the\ndestruction of the local distribution system during the civil war. No substantial repair work has\ntaken place since, and in some areas households have managed to reestablish supply with\nsubstandard lines and connections that are often unsafe. Such practices have increased line\nlosses significantly and overloaded distribution transformers.\n53. The Project will rehabilitate about 230 km of medium voltage lines, 415 km of low\nvoltage lines, and 107 substations that supply these households. The substation rehabilitation", "16\nconsists mainly of increasing the capacity of existing transformers that are overloaded, thus\nreducing  transmission  losses  and  improving  reliability  of  electricity  supply.  In  addition,  the\nhouseholds will be provided with consumer meters to encourage more efficient consumption, as\nconsumers would pay for actual electricity consumption rather than the current system based on\nthe number of rooms per household.\n54. The collective farm, Sovhoz 2, covering 2,500 hectares in Bishkent District of Khatlon\nRegion is of particular importance as it is in an agricultural district providing employment to\n10,000 people. Due to lack of electricity supply to the drainage pumping station, the land cannot\nbe adequately drained to allow for cultivation and malaria is common in the area. Lack of proper\ndrainage has raised the salinity of the land, making it nonarable, and increasing the salinity of\ndrinking water, making it unsafe for human consumption.  The rehabilitation of the associated\nsubstation will provide power to the pumping station.\n55. In addition, the Project will increase supply of electricity, especially in winter, in the\nregion by rehabilitating the 15 MW CHPP, which has not been operating for about eight years\ndue to lack of funds to procure spare parts. The Project will support the reconditioning of\ngenerators,  replacement  of  auxiliary  equipment,  addition  of  a  new  110  kV  circuit  breaker,\nrefurbishment of the lubrication and cooling system, realignment of turbines, modernization of\nthe governing and control system, and reconditioning of intake gate and penstocks. These\nmeasures will allow CHPP's plant life to be extended for least another 10 years and generation\nof 36 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity per annum.\n56. The efficiency of electricity supply operations in Khatlon Region has been severely\nreduced by the lack of an adequate telecommunication system. The Project will improve the\ntelecommunication system by providing new ultra high frequency and very high frequency radio\nequipment (covering 94 channels and 20 stations), and installing a new digital power line carrier\nsystem including data acquisition connected with the dispatch center in Dushanbe.\n2. Part B: Rehabilitation of NHPP and Associated Transmission Facilities\n57. Given its size, the 3,000 MW NHPP plays a predominant role throughout the year in\nTajikistan's power supply. The Project will cover critical rehabilitation measures. The main\nconcern at present is stability of the 220 kV high voltage switchyard, where large sinkholes\ncaused by deteriorating subsoil conditions have appeared in 25 percent of the switchyard area.\nWhile Barki Tajik is undertaking some remedial measures, the Project aims at providing a\nreliable long-term solution to stabilize the foundations in the affected area. If the affected part of\nthe 220 kV switchyard were to collapse, two transmission lines would be disconnected resulting\nin serious disruption in power supply in the south system including Dushanbe. In addition, the\n27-year  old  circuit  breakers  need  to  be  replaced  with  new  circuit  breakers  that  are  more\ncompact and efficient, thus reducing the loading on the foundations. New protection relays are\nincluded for all circuits, together with new voltage transformers and capacitor couplers for the\n500 kV switchyard.\n58. In the Soviet era, stability of the NHPP dam, which is the largest rock-filled dam in the\nworld, was analyzed on a regular basis. Dam monitoring is essential for safety but at present,\nBarki Tajik cannot monitor the dam properly due to lack of equipment and technology. The\nProject will include computer hardware, software, and training for the dam monitoring system.\nThe tailrace water head at NHPP is six meters higher than the design head, due to sediments\ndeposited downstream from the powerhouse. Under the Project, dredging of the tailrace section\nof the river will increase power generation by 320 GWh per year.", "17\n59. A significant portion of electricity supplied in Tajikistan is delivered through 500 kV and\n220 kV substations at Regar, in addition to the main electricity exchange with Uzbekistan via the\nCentral Asia grid. The rehabilitation of these substations will improve the grid\u2019s efficiency and\nreliability of power supply. This entails replacement of all seven 500 kV and eighteen 220 kV\ncircuit breakers, 500 kV capacitor couplers and voltage transformers, and protective relays.\n3. Part C: Improvement of Power Supply Reliability in Dushanbe Region\n60. The following measures are needed to improve power supply reliability in the Dushanbe\nregion, which has one million people: (i) increase the 220/110 kV transformer capacity at the\nNovaya and Djangal substations, which currently have two transformers of 125 million volt-\namperes each, by an additional transformer at each substation; and (ii) replace the 220 kV and\n110 kV bulk oil circuit breakers, which are 30 years old, at the two substations. The two\nsubstations are the main supply points to the Dushanbe region and supply about 9 GWh daily.\nThe existing transformers are overloaded, and with no spares available in stock, a transformer\noutage would significantly reduce power supply for at least a month. The failure of circuit\nbreakers would also result in interruptions or reductions in power supply to the Dushanbe\nregion.\n4. Part D: Bulk Metering of Power Supply\n61. About 500 electronic high-voltage meters will be installed at power plants and\nhigh-voltage  substations  to  accurately  measure  electricity  exports  and  imports,  electricity\ngenerated and sent-out, and the amount of electricity exchanged among Barki Tajik\u2019s regional\ndistribution networks. The existing meters are old, and their accuracy is doubtful. The new\nexport-import meters will help resolve disputes over payment for electricity transfers, and will\nallow accurate computation of power losses, thus benefiting consumers in the long run.\n62. The  meters  at  the  boundaries  of  regional  distribution  networks  will  allow  accurate\nmeasurement  of  power  transfers  between  supply  companies,  and  identification  of  losses.\nConsumers will benefit from such measures to reduce losses. The meters will also allow load\nprofiles to be monitored thus enabling proper planning of electricity dispatch, and in future will\npermit the automatic collection of data (when the communication system is put in place).\n5.  Part E: Consulting Services\n63. Approximately  216  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  needed  for  project\nimplementation activities, comprising project management services, social and environmental\nmonitoring, assistance with benefit monitoring and evaluation, engineering design, tendering,\nsupervision of installation, testing and commissioning of equipment, technical support, and\ntraining.  Consulting services (approximately 21 person-months) will also be provided to audit\nBarki Tajik\u2019s corporate and project accounts for 2000 and 2001 in accordance with IAS, and to\nformulate recommendations for improving financial management at Barki Tajik. In addition, to\ndevelop corporate charters and regulations for implementing the Energy Law, about 24 person-\nmonths of consulting services will be provided to the Government.\nD. Cost Estimates\n64. The estimated total project cost is $62.8 million equivalent, including physical and price\ncontingencies and interest and other charges during construction (Table 4 and Appendix 4). The\nProject is expected to be exempt from taxes and duties in connection with procurement of", "18\ngoods and services.31 Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $49.3 million (78.5 percent) and\nlocal currency costs at $13.5 million equivalent (21.5 percent).\nTable 4: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign   Local      Total\nItem\nCurrency Currency      Cost\nA.

ADB will finance $34 million equivalent of the foreign exchange costs, representing\n54 percent of the total project cost. Parallel cofinancing of $9.3 million (15 percent of the total\nproject cost) from the Islamic Development Bank and $6 million (9 percent of the total project\ncost) from the Swiss Government is expected to finance the rest of the foreign exchange costs.\nBarki Tajik will bear the entire local currency costs, amounting to 22 percent of the total project\ncost. The financing plan is summarized in Table 5.\nTable 5: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local\nExchange Currency Total Percent\nADB 34.00 0.00 34.00 54.1\nIslamic Development Bank 9.30 0.00   9.30 14.8\nSwiss Government 6.00 0.00   6.00 9.6\nBarki Tajik 0.00 13.50 13.50 21.5\n              Total 49.30 13.50 62.80 100.0\n            Source: Staff estimates.\n66. The ADB loan of $34 million equivalent from the Special Funds resources will have a\nrepayment period of 32 years, including an 8-year grace period. The service charge on the ADB\nloan  will  be  1.0  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter. The Borrower will be the Republic of Tajikistan, and the entire loan proceeds, except\nfor $0.6 million (for the consulting services for the implementing regulations of the Energy Law)\nwill be relent to Barki Tajik pursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions\nacceptable to ADB. The relending terms will include a repayment period of 25 years, including a\n5-year grace period. Relending will be denominated in local currency and at ADB\u2019s ordinary\ncapital resources interest rate for multicurrency loans, as indicative local interest rates are not\n                  \n31 An amendment to the tax code to provide tax exemption for goods and services acquired with proceeds of\nconcessionary  loans  from  international  financial  institutions  to  the  Government  is  under  consideration  by\nParliament and is expected to be passed prior to loan effectiveness. The Government has given its assurance that\nif the amendment is not passed and any taxes are imposed, the Government will cover the cost of any such taxes.", "19\nreadily available. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government, as Barki Tajik's\nfinancial situation is not healthy and the Government does not want to distress it further by\nadding the foreign exchange risk to the onlent funds. The proceeds of cofinancing by the Swiss\nGovernment  will  be  relent  by  the  Government  to  Barki  Tajik  under  similar  conditions  as\nrelending of the ADB loan. The proceeds of cofinancing by the Islamic Development Bank will\nbe made available by the Government to Barki Tajik on the same terms as those to the\nGovernment.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Implementation\n67. Barki Tajik, which has managed several small power projects will be the Executing\nAgency for the Project and will be responsible for its overall execution and management.  Barki\nTajik will also enter into a project agreement with ADB to confirm it will use the loan proceeds\nfor  the  Project  and  comply  with  all  relevant  provisions  of  the  loan  agreement.  Project\nimplementation will be coordinated with the local United Nations (UN) office to ensure safe\nworking conditions. A project implementation unit (PIU) was set up in June 2000 to undertake\ncoordination, reporting, procurement, and disbursement for all project components except for\npart E (c). The PIU is headed by a project manager, appointed by Barki Tajik and having\nqualifications acceptable to ADB.  Project implementation consultants will assist the PIU in\nproject management, social and environmental matters, procurement, construction supervision,\nand training activities. All project components are scheduled to be completed by December\n2005 (Appendix 5).\n68. For the rehabilitation of CHPP (part A) and NHPP (part B), the major activities are\n(i) detailed planning and preparation of bidding documents, during the first six months of 2001;\n(ii) invitation to bid within a period of three months from July 2001; (iii) contract awards at the\nend of 2001; and (iv) completion of construction within two and a half years from January 2002.\nThe longer schedule for rehabilitation of the transmission and distribution system in Khatlon\nRegion is based on the complexity of works involved and similar experience in other transition\neconomies. For this component, the invitation to bid will be issued by mid-2001, the contract will\nbe awarded by the end of 2001, and commissioning will take place almost four years thereafter.\nPart C is expected to be completed within three years and Part D within two and half years from\nJanuary 2002. For part E, shortlisting of project implementation consultants is to be completed\nby the end of 2000 and the selection of consultants will take three months from January 2001.\nConsulting services for implementation will be provided until the end of the Project in late 2005.\nFor auditing Barki Tajik and implementing Energy Law regulations, consultants will be recruited\nby mid-2001 and services provided from 2001 to 2002. MOE will be the Implementing Agency\nresponsible for the selection and supervision of the consultants for the Energy Law regulations.\n2. Procurement\n69. All goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contract packages financed by cofinanciers will be procured\nusing their procedures. The procurement packages for transmission and distribution equipment\nand materials have been optimized to facilitate procurement administration, and to make such\npackages attractive for international competitive bidding (Appendix 6). All ADB-financed civil\nworks contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of more than $1 million and all supply contracts\nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  more  than  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of\n$1 million or less and supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or less will", "20\nbe awarded on the basis of international shopping. The project implementation consultants will\nprescribe the functional design, and the contractor will be responsible for detailed design of\nplant and equipment on the basis of a two-stage bidding approach. The civil works at the NHPP\nswitchyard  foundations  financed  by  Barki  Tajik  will  comprise  a  package  suitable  for  local\ncompetitive bidding, for which Barki Tajik will use ADB's standard bidding documents. Barki\nTajik will maintain transparency and accountability as required under ADB's anticorruption policy\nin undertaking procurement of goods and services.\n3.  Consulting Services\n70. Consulting services will be required for implementing parts A to D. Approximately 106\nperson-months of international and 110 person-months of domestic consultants will be needed\n(Supplementary Appendix D). Consulting services will also be provided to audit Barki Tajik\u2019s\ncorporate  and  project  accounts  for  fiscal  years  2000  and  2001.  The  auditing  will  be  in\naccordance with IAS and the consultants will make recommendations for improving Barki Tajik's\nfinancial management. This will require about 6 person-months of international and 15 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants (Supplementary Appendix E). In addition, consulting services\nwill be provided to help the Government develop charters and regulations to implement the\nEnergy Law. This will require about 17 person-months of international and 7 person-months of\ndomestic consulting services (Supplementary Appendix F). All consultants will be recruited by\nthe Government and Barki Tajik in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The\nGovernment has requested that the internationally-recruited consultants shall collaborate with\nthe domestic consultants. ADB has agreed to this request and specific arrangements relating to\nthe collaboration will be included in the consultants' proposals.\n4. Disbursement\n71. The  Government  and  Barki  Tajik  will  adopt  either  of  the  following  disbursement\nprocedures for withdrawing proceeds of the loan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook: (i) a direct payment procedure, where ADB at the request of the Government will\npay a designated beneficiary directly; or (ii) a commitment procedure, where ADB at the request\nof the Government, will reimburse a commercial bank for payments made or to be made to a\nsupplier against a letter of credit financed from the loan account.\n5.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n72. There will be continued monitoring and evaluation of project implementation, with timely\nreporting. Barki Tajik will prepare quarterly reports on progress of project implementation and\nfurnish ADB and cofinanciers with copies of these reports. ADB will review implementation of\nthe Project on a regular basis, at least once a year, and will monitor overall performance of\nBarki Tajik. Within three months of completion of the Project, Barki Tajik will furnish ADB with a\nproject completion report covering details of implementation and other information required by\nADB. Barki Tajik will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project and will have the\naccounts  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Copies  of  audited\nproject accounts will be provided to ADB within nine months after the end of each relevant fiscal\nyear. Barki Tajik will also provide ADB with copies of its audited corporate accounts within 12\nmonths of the end of its fiscal year. Loan funds will be used to retain auditors for the first two\nannual audits of the project and corporate accounts. Barki Tajik will finance the subsequent\nannual audits.", "21\n6. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n 73. Barki Tajik and its environmental and social monitoring unit will carry out all benefit\nmonitoring and evaluation activities of the Project. These will be undertaken in accordance with\nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation: A Handbook for Bank Staff,\nStaff of Executing Agencies, and Consultants. At the beginning of project implementation, Barki\nTajik will submit to ADB a report on the benchmark information, to be followed by annual\nperformance reports for at least the first five years of project implementation. Upon project\ncompletion, a comprehensive report will be submitted. In addition, three years after completion,\nBarki Tajik will finance out of its own funds a benefit monitoring and evaluation study to assess\noverall benefits of the Project and review the results of the social and environmental monitoring.\n74. Each of the project\u2019s 24,000 beneficiary households in Khatlon Region will be identified\nin Barki Tajik\u2019s records to distinguish them from nonproject households. During the benchmark\nsurvey, annual reviews, and after completion of the Project, Barki Tajik will collect information\non (i) cost of new connections including metering; (ii) increase in the household electrification\nratio resulting from the Project; (iii) electricity sales to the newly connected households and\nrelated O&M costs; (iv) new economic activities induced by providing reliable electricity supply;\n(v) estimated total value of economic activities induced by rehabilitation of the transmission and\ndistribution systems; (vi) estimated average income levels; and (vii) perceived importance of\nvarious types of noneconomic benefits (disaggregated by gender) created by electricity supply,\nsuch  as  improved  quality  of  life  and  leisure  activities,  better  environment  for  study,  and\nimproved health standards. Barki Tajik will also concurrently survey average income levels and\nother socioeconomic indicators in selected communities where the electricity supply system has\nbeen and has not been affected by the Project. Based on this information, a comprehensive\nreport on poverty reduction impacts of the Project will be prepared by Barki Tajik and be\nsubmitted to ADB within three months after Project completion.\nG.  Executing Agency\n1. Barki Tajik\n75. Barki  Tajik  is  the  state-owned  utility  responsible  for  generation,  transmission,  and\ndistribution of electricity and heat32 in Tajikistan. Prior to the country\u2019s independence, the entity\nwas administratively part of the FSU's MOE. Upon independence in 1992, it became a state\njoint stock holding company.33 Although it is fully owned by the Government, Barki Tajik enjoys\nautonomous status according to its charter.\n 76. Under the present institutional arrangement, Barki Tajik consists of a network of 10\nsubsidiary power generation companies, 11 subsidiary distribution companies, and 8 supporting\ncompanies  such  as  a  research  institute  and  construction  companies  (Supplementary\nAppendix G). The chairperson of Barki Tajik, who has overall responsibility for operations,\nreports directly to the Prime Minister, and is appointed by the Government with no fixed term.\nThe chairperson is assisted by the first deputy chairperson (chief engineer), who manages Barki\nTajik\u2019s day-to-day operations, and six deputy chairpersons who are in charge of the technical\ndepartments, supporting services, and subsidiary power generation and distribution companies.\nSince 1999, the Government has created business units for some of these subsidiaries,34 with\nownership rights vested directly in the State Property Committee on behalf of the Government\nbut with business management responsibilities assigned to Barki Tajik.\n                  \n32 Barki Tajik is responsible for heat supply to Dushanbe and Khujand only.\n33 Decree No. 272 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Tajikistan of 24 July 1992.\n34Tursunzade, Dushanbe Central, Khulyab region, Khulyab City, Ura-Tyube and Panjikent networks; Baipinskaya\nand Pamir hydropower plants; Tajik Energy Construction Enterprise, and Tajikenergo Naladka Installations.", "22\n77. Barki Tajik's organizational structure needs improvement. The roles and responsibilities\nbetween executive and nonexecutive leadership are not clearly defined and there is a relatively\nhigh degree of overlapping of functions and responsibilities between various departments, both\ntechnical and commercial. Therefore, substantial changes, both organizational and regulatory,\nare needed. In accordance with the ESAP, the corporatization and commercialization of Barki\nTajik will involve restructuring along its business unit lines for generation, transmission, and\ndistribution, and a reorganization of its structure.\n2.  Accounting and Financial Management\n78. Barki  Tajik's  accounting  standards  do  not  fully  meet  IAS  requirements.  TA  will  be\nprovided to Barki Tajik to introduce IAS (para. 96). The accounting and financial management\nfunctions of Barki Tajik\u2019s subsidiaries are managed by the respective company accounting\ndepartments. The Central Accounting Department within Barki Tajik\u2019s head office prepares Barki\nTajik\u2019s consolidated financial statements and management reports, and is responsible for cash\nflow management. There are 155 accounting staff employed across Barki Tajik, of which 13 are\nemployed in the head office.\n79. The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  regulates  the  accounting  systems  of  state-owned\nenterprises. The accounting regulations, while amended in 1997, are not in conformity with IAS.\nBarki Tajik submits quarterly and annual financial reports to MOF. MOF, with the assistance of a\ntax  committee,  audits  Barki  Tajik's  financial  statements  biennially.  Barki  Tajik's  Planning\nDepartment  is  responsible  for  preparing  the  annual  budget  and  reviewing  it  quarterly.\nComputerization of Barki Tajik's accounting procedures in both head office and subsidiaries is\nlimited.\n3. Past Financial Performance\n80. During the FSU era, the power sector within Tajikistan operated as a part of the MOE\nbased in Moscow. Tariffs were uniform throughout the FSU, and fuel costs were kept artificially\nlower than world prices. Any financial surpluses produced by the power sector were transferred\nto the state budget, which in turn financed all Barki Tajik\u2019s investment requirements. Hence,\nthere are no long-term borrowings in Barki Tajik\u2019s books.\n81. An  analysis  of  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  past  financial  performance  is  complex  considering  the\nnoncompliance with IAS, the lack of reliable information, and the high depreciation of the Tajik\nruble.35 Barki Tajik\u2019s financial statements for 1997 to 1999 (Appendix 7), have been restated by\nTA consultants (footnote 3) in dollar terms to broadly conform with IAS and are summarized in\nTable 6. Overall, Barki Tajik's past financial performance has been weak. Revenues have not\nbeen sufficient to cover operating costs and returns on net fixed assets have been negative.\nThe collection efficiency has been low, resulting in high accounts receivable. Furthermore,\nhuman, managerial, and office resources have been inadequate. Mainly because of the Tajik\nruble\u2019s depreciation in 1998, gross revenues, in dollar equivalent, fell from $77.7 million in 1997\nto $44.9 million in 1998. Tariff increases made for residential, water supply, and public sector\nconsumers in 1999 (in dollar terms) resulted in a growth of gross revenues that year. A major\ncost item accounting for 37 percent of Barki Tajik's cash operating costs is the import of natural\ngas used by the Dushanbe Thermal Power Plant.36 Another major expense (19 percent of the\ntotal) is the purchase of electricity, at about $0.05/kWh, from Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan,\n                  \n35 From $1=TJR50 in May 1995 to $1=TJR2,000 in August 2000, a depreciation of 97 percent over 64 months.\n36 The other thermal power plant, Yavan in the south system, has not operated since 1997.", "23\nand Uzbekistan. Under the national accounting system, Barki Tajik had to pay income tax from\n1997 to 1999; however, under IAS accounting presentation, Barki Tajik\u2019s operations would have\nresulted in net operating losses and not be subject to tax. As of the end of 1999, fixed assets\nwere grossly undervalued in Barki Tajik\u2019s books, with a total of only $96 million against a gross\nreplacement  value  estimated  at  about  $3.75  billion.  As  a  result,  tariffs  failed  to  ensure\nappropriate capital cost recovery. Barki Tajik\u2019s accounts receivable have been a major problem\nwith a gross total at the end of 1999 of $67 million, or a net total of $46.8 million after deducting\nprovision for bad debts; this is the equivalent of 11.4 months of gross billings (paras. 42 to 44).\nRetained earnings are minimal in Barki Tajik\u2019s balance sheets as all operating surpluses are\ntransferred to the Government.\n4. Financial Projections\n82. A  major  part  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  has  been  devoted  to\nimproving Barki Tajik\u2019s financial performance. A comprehensive approach has been developed\nin the ESAP that involves (i) improving operational efficiency and reducing losses, (ii) improving\nthe financial management system and accounting standards, and (iii) adjusting the level and\nstructure of tariffs.\n83. Barki  Tajik\u2019s  financial  projections  are  based  on  agreements  reached  with  the\nGovernment to implement financial reforms that include the following: (i) Barki Tajik will adopt a\ndebt service covenant of at least 1.3 times; (ii) the Government will undertake all necessary\nactions, including base tariff increases and implementation of tariff adjustments arising from the\nquarterly automatic tariff adjustment mechanism, to ensure that Barki Tajik's operating ratio will\nbe below 90 percent from 2002 on, and Barki Tajik will generate a rate of return of 6 percent on\nnet fixed assets from the end of 2005 on; and (iii) Barki Tajik will reduce accounts receivable to\nthe equivalent of six months of billings by December 2001 and three months of billings by\nDecember 2002.\n84. With  the  implementation  of  these  measures,  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  financial  performance  is\nexpected to gradually improve (Appendix 7 and Table 6). The financial projections assume\nannual tariff increases in dollar terms of 22 percent in 2000, 25 percent between 2001 and\n2005, and 10 percent thereafter. Such increases are realistic given the low tariff level and the\napplication of the lifeline tariff which benefits mostly the poor. Electricity sales are conservatively\nestimated to grow at 2.0 percent per year between 2000 and 2002, at an average of 3.2 percent\nper year between 2003 and 2004, and at an average of 5.3 percent per year from 2005 to\n2015.37 The operating ratio is expected to deteriorate in 2000, mainly due to the revaluation of\nBarki Tajik\u2019s fixed assets and resulting depreciation expenses, but will gradually improve to 77\npercent by 2003. After generating a negative return on net fixed assets during 2000 and\nbreaking even in 2001, Barki Tajik is expected to yield a rate of return of 6.7 percent by 2005.\n                  \n37 In 1998 and 1999, the sales growth was 24 percent and 7 percent respectively.", "24\nTable 6: Barki Tajik's Past and Projected Financial Performance\nActual Projected\nItem Unit 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nElectricity Sales GWh 10,045 12,495 13,310 13,576 13,848 14,125 14,478 15,035 15,808 16,651\nIncrease in Sales % 0.0 24.4 6.5 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.5 3.8 5.1 5.3\nAverage Tariff US\u00a2/kWh 0.773 0.359 0.367 0.448 0.559 0.699 0.874 1.093 1.366 1.502\nIncrease in Tariff % 0.0 -53.5 2.1 22.0 25.0 25.0 25.0 25.0 25.0 10.0\nElectricity Sales $ million 78 45 49 61 77 99 127 164 216 250\nOperating Income Before Tax $ million -24 -4 -6 -10 0 11 33 72 115 141\nTotal Assets a $ million 110 201 155 1,310 1,307 1,332 1,347 1,366 1,372 1,373\nLong-Term Debt $ million 0 0 0 0 2 24 50 59 63 64\nTotal Equity $ million 60 159 120 1,291 1,291 1,299 1,292 1,302 1,302 1,301\nOperating Ratio % 131 108 111 116 100 89 77 59 49 44\nReturn on Net Fixed Assets % -38.2 -4.4 -5.2 -1.5 0.0 0.6 1.9 4.1 6.7 8.7\nAccounts Receivable Months 5.3 12.7 11.4 8.4 6.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0\nDebt Service Ratio Times - - - - - - - - - 28.1\n      a  Assets were revalued in 2000; - = no debt  repayment requirement.\nSource:  Staff estimates.\nH.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental Impacts\n85. The Project is not expected to have any major adverse impact on the environment. It\nconsists entirely of rehabilitation of existing structures and facilities. The rehabilitation includes\nreplacing switchgear and transformers at existing substations, rehabilitating existing hydropower\nplant components, and retrofitting new components to existing equipment. The Project has been\nclassified as Category B in ADB\u2019s environmental classification system. An initial environmental\nexamination  was  undertaken  according  to  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  at  the  feasibility  study  stage\n(Appendix 8).\n86. During construction, there could be air pollution and noise caused by trucks and other\nvehicles for transport of materials and use of machines at sites. However, due to (i) the limited\nscope and duration of construction, (ii) the type of materials to be transported, and (iii) the fact\nthat  measures  in  NHPP  take  place  outside  inhabited  areas,  no  negative  impact  requiring\nspecific mitigation measures will occur. An estimated 0.5-1.0 million cubic meters of material will\nhave to be excavated from the NHPP dam tailrace. An uninhabited unlevel area of about\n7 hectares has been identified near the construction site as appropriate for depositing the\nexcavated material. The land belongs to the local government and Barki Tajik has obtained\nauthorization to use the excavated material to fill the uneven pockets. The material to be\nexcavated will not present any environmental risk and consists of rocks and sediments. Positive\nenvironmental impacts from this are expected since tree cover can be established once the\nfilled area is leveled. The Project requires replacement of about 500 tons of transformer oil that\ndoes not contain any poly-chlorine-biphenyl, which would be hazardous to health and the\nenvironment. During replacement of transformers, this oil will be filtered and recycled for use as\nfuel by Barki Tajik. The Government and Barki Tajik have agreed to remove and dispose of all\nhazardous  waste  materials  associated  with  the  Project,  in  a  safe  and  environmentally\nresponsible manner.", "25\n2. Social Aspects\n87. Under the project preparatory TA (footnote 4), an initial social assessment was carried\nout  and  a  summary  of  the  assessment  was  prepared  according  to  the  ADB  guidelines\n(Appendix 9). This assessment has shown that the risk of negative socioeconomic impacts is\nsmall or nonexistent. None of the components identified will require any resettlement, and no\nadditional land is required except for the 7 hectares near NHPP. The improvement of energy\nsupply in the project areas will substantially improve the well-being of the people.\n88. Electricity supply is a prerequisite for improving the economic situation and quality of life\nin the project areas, as it is required for agriculture (irrigation and drainage), drinking water\nsupply, health, education, industry, and small-scale enterprises. Adequate energy supply will\nremove an important obstacle to investments, and facilitate operation of private enterprises.\nAgriculture  will  benefit  due  to  improved  irrigation  and  drainage.  Direct  and  indirect  health\nbenefits include (i) improved drainage that will reduce the risks from malaria, and saline water in\nfarmland and water table, (ii) improved water supply through use of electric pumps, and (iii)\nability to boil water efficiently thus reducing risks from unsafe water. Provision of lighting and\nheating in schools will improve the education facilities and increase school enrolment.\n3.  Gender and Development\n89. Based on UNDP's gender-related development index, which fell from 0.57 in 1995 to\n0.53 in 1998, the relative position of women has deteriorated. Women are more likely to be\nunemployed than men: the unemployment rates are 28.8 percent for women and 25.3 percent\nfor  men.38  Women\u2019s  wages  average  only  $2  per  month  as  compared  with  men\u2019s  wages\naveraging $6 per month. Women spend an average of 6.3 hours per day of unpaid work\n(cooking, working on private plots, cleaning, laundry, etc.) compared to 3.3 hours by men. The\nwar has left an estimated 26,000 widows and 55,000 orphans who are even more severely\naffected.\n90. Women and children disproportionately bear the burden of using alternative fuels to\naugment the lack of reliable electricity supply. Such use has economic, time, labor, health, and\nsocial impacts. A one-month supply of fuelwood takes up to 15 days to gather. Work on cow\ndung briquettes takes at least one hour per day per household during the summer to prepare\nthe  required  supply  for  winter.  The  use  of  these  energy  sources,  typically  for  cooking  in\nunventilated  rooms,  constitutes  health  hazards  for  women  and  children,  who  spend\napproximately five hours per day in such rooms. Prior to independence, piped water had been\nprovided to households. However, pumping from reservoirs and deep-wells has been restricted\nbecause  of  the  current  irregular  electricity  supply.  Women  and  children  in  particular  fetch\ndrinking water which takes substantial amount of time, as they need to walk up to 15 km to\nwater sources. Due to transportation and storage, water obtained is often contaminated, and is\nfrequently not boiled due to scarcity of electricity. Consequently, the Project will have significant\npositive impacts on poor women and children, particularly in Khatlon Region, in better health, a\nreduced burden of household chores, and increased time for economic activities.\n4. Poverty Reduction and Improving the Quality of Life of the Poor\n91. The serious energy shortage, particularly in rural areas and mainly during winter, has\nbeen  identified  by  the  Government,  households,  community  development  organizations,\nnongovernment organizations, and international aid agencies as one of the most important\n                  \n38Falkingham, J. 1999. Women and Gender Relations in Tajikistan. London School of Economics, London.", "26\nchallenges to reducing poverty and improving the quality of life of the poor. Unless addressed,\nTajikistan will have difficulty resuming economic growth; increasing agricultural and industrial\nproductivity; generating employment; increasing incomes; and meeting basic needs such as\nheating, safe water, and social services. Restoration and improvement of electricity supply is a\nprerequisite for reducing poverty, improving quality of life, and sustaining economic growth.\n92. Participatory rural assessments conducted during project preparation39 confirmed high\nlevels of poverty, particularly in rural areas. Formal employment is low, and, where available,\nconsists mostly of civil service employment where salaries are often several months late; or\nseasonal employment in collective farms paying TJR2,000 ($1) per month during spring and\nTJR10,000  ($5)  per  month  during  summer.  Formal  employment  for  women  is  even  less\navailable.  Women  spend  more  time  than  men  at  home  doing  unpaid  work.  Households\nsupplement their incomes through home plots, milk production, livestock, and small-scale retail\nactivities. In most households visited, these activities constituted the main source of income.\nMost  income  is  received  during  summer  and  fall  harvest  season,  but  most  expenses  are\nincurred during winter and spring, mainly for heating and clothing. Poor households receive\nhumanitarian aid from donor agencies through the local government, consisting of 5 liters of\ncooking oil and/or 10 kilos of flour supplied every 3-6 months.\n93. In the project areas, households report that electricity is available intermittently for most\nof the year except during the winter (December to March), when electricity is available only for\n2-4 hours a day. Because of lack of electricity, people have shifted to alternative sources of fuel.\nHouseholds spend as much as TJR25,000 (including time and cost) for fuelwood during winter\nmonths, and where fuelwood is scarce, animal dung is used exclusively, averaging 1,500\nbriquettes during the winter and 300 briquettes during the rest of the year, which is valued at\nTJR15,000 mainly for labor cost. Diesel is primarily used for lighting and igniting fuelwood or\nanimal dung, and its cost can reach TJR18,000 during winter months. Field visits confirmed that\nthe Project would have substantial impacts on reduction of poverty and improving the quality of\nlife of the poor through provision of cheaper and reliable electricity supply (valued at a lifeline\ntariff of $0.003/kWh against alternative fuel costs of about $0.032/kWh) and freeing up time\nused for gathering and using alternative fuels for generating additional income (e.g., working on\nhome plots, bread making, and sewing). In addition, the scarcity of electricity has health, social\nand gender impacts (para. 90).\n94. The large agricultural base, which is dependent on irrigation, has suffered from lack of\npumping facilities. As a result, farm yield has dropped to 20-25 percent of levels when Tajikistan\nwas part of the FSU. The provision of reliable electricity supply through the Project will reduce\npoverty by increasing farming activity and providing employment opportunities to the poor in\nparticular.  The  provision  of  education  and  health  services  to  the  population  is  similarly\nhampered by lack of electricity, thus reducing the quality of life of the poor in particular. Schools\nare closed for two months during winter due to inadequate electricity for heating. This forces\nschools to operate for extended hours during summer. School enrolment has dropped because\npoor children, lacking warm clothes and shoes, do not attend school during the rest of winter.\nHospitals also lack heating, and delivery of services is greatly hampered by lack of electricity\nsupply. In particular, crucial medicines and vaccines cannot be properly stored at controlled\nconditions. Hospitals that remain operational are in urban administrative centers, resulting in\nhigh transportation costs and long travel time leading to even higher expenses for the poor who\nlive far from the centers. The Project will improve people's quality of life (especially for the poor)\nby providing reliable and adequate electricity supply to schools and hospitals.\n                  \n39 Financed under TA 5894-REG: Facilitating Capacity Building and Participatory Activities II, for $400,000, approved\non 28 December 1999.", "27\nI. Technical Assistance\n95. To help Barki Tajik meet targets set under the ESAP, the Government requested two\nTAs40  to  be  provided  under  the  Project.  The  first  TA,  Improving  Barki  Tajik's  Billing  and\nCollection System, will help Barki Tajik design and implement a billing and collection system to\nreduce its accounts receivable. The TA will (i) cover implementation of a pilot computerized\nsystem  to  support  the  billing  and  collection  system  at  a  large  distribution  subsidiary,  (ii)\nformulate recommendations for improvement of the consumer management process covering\nbilling and collection for electricity customers, and (iii) provide training for Barki Tajik staff in the\nuse of the system. About 12 person-months of international and about 10 person-months of\ndomestic consulting services will be required. The study will be carried out by an international\naccounting firm with expertise in consumer accounting, financial management, and information\nsystems. The terms of reference are given in Supplementary Appendix H. The total cost of the\nTA is estimated at $586,000 equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of $492,000 and a local\ncurrency cost of $94,000 equivalent. $500,000 equivalent will be financed by ADB on a grant\nbasis from the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan, to cover the entire\nforeign exchange costs and part of the local currency costs amounting to $8,000 equivalent.\nThe remaining local currency cost of $86,000 equivalent, representing 15 percent of the total\ncost of the TA, will be financed by Barki Tajik to cover (i) counterpart staff, (ii) local transport for\nconsultants and counterpart staff, (iii) secretarial support and office supplies, and (iv) office\naccommodation. The TA is expected to commence in May 2001 and will require about 8 months\nto be completed.\n96. The second TA, Introducing IAS at Barki Tajik, will help Barki Tajik introduce IAS and\nprepare its corporate accounts for the year 2001 in line with both national regulations and IAS.\nBarki  Tajik\u2019s  accounting  practices  are  rudimentary  and  need  to  be  improved  to  reflect  its\nfinancial situation correctly. Enhanced accounting practices will also support systems to improve\ncost  recovery  and  reduce  accounts  receivable.  Approximately  11.5  person-months  of\ninternational and 10-person months of domestic consulting services are required. The study will\nbe  carried  out  by  an  international  accounting  firm  with  expertise  in  accounting,  financial\nmanagement, and information systems. The terms of reference are given in Supplementary\nAppendix  I.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $586,000  equivalent,  with  a  foreign\nexchange  cost  of  $490,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $96,000  equivalent.  $500,000\nequivalent will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund funded by the\nGovernment of Japan, to cover the entire foreign exchange costs and part of the local currency\ncosts amounting to $10,000 equivalent. The remaining local currency cost of $86,000 equivalent\n(representing 15 percent of the total cost of the TA) will be financed by Barki Tajik to cover\n(i) counterpart staff, (ii) local transport for consultants and counterpart staff, (iii) secretarial\nsupport and office supplies, and (iv) office accommodation. The TA is expected to commence in\nJuly 2001 and will require about 10 months to be completed.\n97. Both TAs are essential for the commercialization of Barki Tajik and will facilitate the\ncreation of an appropriate new organizational structure. For both TAs, full technical proposals\nwill be requested from shortlisted firms, and consultants will be engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB on the\nengagement of domestic consultants.\n                  \n40 The TAs were first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities on 15 May 2000 and 15 September  2000.", "28\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1.  Least Cost Analysis\n98. During  the  feasibility  study  (footnote  4),  a  large  number  of  potential  alternatives,\nincluding a do-nothing option, and their costs have been analyzed. For example, dredging of the\nNHPP tailrace was compared with four options: (i) import of an additional 320 GWh of energy,\n(ii) build a new hydro or diesel power plant providing 320 GWh, (iii) increase turbine efficiency\nwith new runners, and (iv) do nothing. In a similar manner, least cost options were examined for\nother project-components, with more than 25 options considered in all. This analysis confirmed\nthat all project components are part of the least cost plan for power development in Tajikistan.\n2.  Financial Analysis\n99. Financial analysis for the Project from the perspective of Barki Tajik is based on capital\ncosts of $52.9 million\u2014base costs plus physical contingencies, assuming an economic life of 15\nyears\u20145  years  for  construction  and  10  years  for  operation41  (Appendix  10).  Incremental\nbenefits of the Project are based on a \"with project\" and \"without project\" comparison and\ninclude the incremental energy generated, improved reliability of power supply, and avoided\nelectricity losses.42 In particular, such incremental benefits are expected to be gained from (i)\nincreased power generation and supply reliability in Khatlon Region due to improved voltage\nand uninterrupted electricity supply, avoided technical losses, and reduction of substandard\ninefficient  connections;  (ii)  increased  power  generation  and  supply  reliability  through  the\nrehabilitation of NHPP; and (iii) increased power supply reliability and transmission efficiency\nthrough the rehabilitation of the Novaya and Djangal substations. These incremental benefits\nare measured in billed electricity sales estimated at about 7.6 TWh during the period of analysis,\nand valued at average revenue as per financial projections for Barki Tajik (but at constant year\n2000 prices). On this basis, and after allowance for adequate O&M costs and income tax, the\nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project is 7.7 percent. The weighted average cost\nof  project  capital  has  not  been  determined,  because  the  uncertain  economic  conditions\nprevailing in Tajikistan do not allow determination of an indicative set of interest rates and rates\nof return. However, the FIRR level indicates that the Project is financially viable in comparison\nwith the onlending rate to Barki Tajik. The results of sensitivity analysis, which are summarized\nin Table 7, show that the Project remains financially viable with changes in key assumptions.\nTable 7: Financial Analysis of the Project\nCase Change FIRR (%) Sensitivity Indicator\n1.

If a comprehensive comparison were made between \u201cwith\nproject\" and \"without project\" situations, larger benefits would result, particularly given the likely rapid deterioration\nof the system in the \"without project\" situation.", "29\n3. Economic Analysis\n100. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) has also been estimated comparing the\n\"with project\" and \"without project\" scenarios following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis\nof Projects (Appendix 11). All applicable assumptions used for the financial analysis have been\nmaintained for the economic analysis. In addition, for the economic analysis, (i) capital and\noperating cost data taken from the financial analysis have been adjusted to reflect economic\nvalues; and (ii) in calculating the economic capital costs, all duties, taxes, and subsidies have\nbeen excluded. Total electricity demand has been divided into incremental and nonincremental\ncomponents. The nonincremental part of energy demand is assumed to be about two-thirds of\ntotal demand and is valued at resource cost savings. The incremental part is valued in terms of\nusers\u2019 willingness to pay. All tradable commodities are valued at border price at the prevailing\nexchange rate (TJR2,000 = $1). Nontradable commodities are valued at shadow price using a\nstandard conversion factor of 0.9.\n101. On this basis, the EIRR for the Project is 28.0 percent, which is well above ADB\u2019s\nthreshold for economic viability of 12 percent. The net present value of the Project is estimated\nat TJR84.6 billion at 12 percent discount rate. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for\nincreased capital cost, reduced benefits, implementation delay, change in willingness to pay,\nand a combination of cases (Table 8). The assumptions made are conservative, the estimated\neconomic  indicators  robust,  the  poverty  reduction  impacts  substantial,  and  the  project\ncomponents part of the least cost plan for power development. Consequently, the proposed\nProject is considered economically justified.\nTable 8: EIRR and Sensitivity Analysis\nEIRR (%)\nCase Change Part A Part B Part C Project SI SV (%)\n1.

Project Beneficiaries and Impact on Poverty\n102. The rehabilitation of NHPP, CHPP, and transmission and distribution systems will benefit\nthe people in Tajikistan directly (about 1 million people or 172,000 households) and indirectly.\nThe reduced electricity losses and inefficiencies in direct utilization for household activities will\nmake more electricity available and improve the well-being of the population in the project\nareas,  in  particular  during  winter.  The  difference  between  the  financial  and  economic  net\npresent values, and consequent gains and losses for different stakeholders, provide the basis\nfor considering the impact of the Project on the poor. For the poverty impact assessment, the\nproject beneficiaries are divided into three groups: consumers, Government economy, and\nlabor. The net economic benefits by group are distributed between poor and nonpoor. The\nincreased, more efficient, and reliable electricity supply resulting from the Project will benefit the\npoor directly and indirectly. Net economic benefits accruing to the poor are estimated at about\n$27 million (Appendix 12).  The poverty impact ratio, which expresses the proportion of net\neconomic benefits of the Project accruing to the poor, is estimated at 57 percent. This is", "30\nconservative as some indirect economic and social benefits are not considered. Hence, a\nsubstantial portion of the project benefits will go to the poor and the Project can achieve its\nprimary objective of poverty reduction.\n103. The  participatory  rural  assessments  (footnote  39)  confirmed  that  the  Project  would\nreduce poverty. The project areas are characterized by high levels of poverty and are largely\nrural. Due to climatic conditions, electricity is a basic need for heat, cooking, and irrigation water\nin the project areas. The Project will also support improvement of other essential services such\nas drinking water, education, and health. Adequate and reliable electricity will help generate\njobs through (i) economic development, and (ii) reduction of time spent obtaining and using\nenergy alternatives for productive activities. This will have significant impact on vulnerable\ngroups, particularly women and children.\n104. Part A of the Project will have the greatest impact on the poor because it will improve\npower supply for approximately 24,000 households comprised mostly of civil war returnees in\nKhatlon Region. Field visits confirmed that returnees are among the poorest segment of society.\nThe collective farm Sovhoz 2 in the war-affected Bishkent District is of particular importance for\nagricultural  production  (para.  54).  The  substation  rehabilitation  will  provide  power  to  the\npumping station, which will considerably improve conditions for agricultural production in the\ndistrict and reduce constraints on the development of small industries.\n105. Electricity is required for economic growth and higher incomes, but it cannot be supplied\nat the current low prices on a sustainable basis. The prevalent extreme levels of poverty affect\nthe ability of a significant portion of the population to pay higher electricity prices. If Barki Tajik is\nunable to collect its bills, the power system will eventually collapse, making the poor even\nworse-off.  The  Government  has  studied  several  possibilities  of  introducing  social  safety\nmeasures to subsidize electricity for the poorest segment of the population (Appendix 13).\nDuring the policy dialogue, the Government has agreed that in the medium term, there will be\nno real increases in the tariff for an initial household consumption of 150 kWh per month.\nA study of alternative fuel costs paid by poor households shows that the current tariff of\nTJR5/kWh  to  be  applied  to  this  lifeline  consumption  is  affordable.  As  83  percent  of  the\npopulation  live  below  the  poverty  line,  such  an  arrangement  is  considered  justified.  The\nGovernment also proposes to use the interest margin arising from relending the loan from ADB\nand cofinancing from the Swiss Government to Barki Tajik to fund the subsidy for the lifeline\ntariff. If required, the Government will make up for any shortfall in the subsidy to Barki Tajik.\nUnder the ESAP, by January 2002, the Government is to provide proposals, acceptable to ADB,\nfor a safety net to protect the poor and vulnerable groups adequately with regard to impact of\ntariff increases in the long term. Measures to be considered include changes to the tariff\nstructure for residential consumers, and the provision of a well targeted cash subsidy scheme to\nthe poor and vulnerable groups.\nB.  Environment\n106. The  Project  will  have  considerable  environmental  benefits,  mainly  through  reducing\nlosses in energy production at NHPP; eliminating the risk of NHPP's switchyard collapsing\nwhich could lead to oil from the transformers contaminating the Vaksh River; improving dam\nsafety at NHPP; reducing electricity losses in the distribution system in Khatlon Region; and\nreducing  pressure  on  alternative  sources  of  energy,  mainly  fuelwood43  and  other  biomass\nresources.\n                  \n43 The forest cover in Tajikistan is only 2.3 percent.", "31\nC. Social Dimensions\n107. The risk of negative socioeconomic impacts from the Project is small or nonexistent.\nSince the Project focuses only on rehabilitation of existing facilities, none of the components will\nrequire any resettlement. About 7 hectares of uninhabited land is required as a dumping ground\nfor rocks and sediments from the dredging of Vaksh River and Barki Tajik has already received\nthe  local  government's  approval  to  use  this  land  at  no  cost  (para.  86).  The  Project  will\nsubstantially improve the social well-being of about 172,000 households, most of which are\npoor. Given the climate in the project areas, electricity is a basic need for heat, cooking, and\npumping of safe drinking water. The Project will also support the improvement of essential\nservices such as irrigation and drainage, education, and health; facilitate direct employment;\nand help generate jobs through induced economic development and by releasing time spent\nsearching  for  and  using  energy  alternatives  for  more  productive  activities.  This  will  have\nsignificant impacts on vulnerable groups, particularly women and children.\nD. Risks\n108. Risks affecting the Project may be divided into two broad categories. Short- to medium-\nterm risks are associated with implementation and the achievement of immediate output. The\nlong-term strategic risks relate to the overall impact and sustainability of improvements brought\nabout by the Project. The former risks are related to availability of local funds, timeliness in\nproject implementation, and adequate project management. The Government has assured ADB\nthat the Project is given top priority for the economic development of Tajikistan, the necessary\nfunds will be made available in a timely manner, and adequate measures will be taken to\nimprove Barki Tajik\u2019s financial situation. Given that this is ADB\u2019s first power project in Tajikistan,\nproblems could be encountered in its implementation because of Barki Tajik's unfamiliarity  with\npolicies and practices of multilateral financing institutions. This risk will be mitigated through the\nprovision of (i) adequate and continued implementation consulting services; (ii) an adequate\ntime period to complete the Project, taking into account ADB's experience in other transition\neconomies; and (iii) regular training by ADB and the project implementation consultants for PIU\nand  Barki  Tajik  staff  in  matters  related  to  procurement,  project  management,  social  and\nenvironmental  issues,  benefit  monitoring,  and  loan  disbursement.  Adequate  project\nmanagement will also be ensured through ADB approval for key positions in the PIU.\n109. In the long term, the risks associated with the sustainability of project benefits are related\nto (i) the political stability in Tajikistan, (ii) the Government's commitment to energy sector\nreform and periodic electricity tariff increases, (iii) Barki Tajik's financial position, (iv) adequate\nmaintenance of project facilities, and (v) the provision of an adequate safety net for poor and\nvulnerable groups against tariff increases. The political situation in Tajikistan is improving as\nevidenced by the reduced need for UN peace-keeping efforts in future.44 Under the PCIPL, the\nGovernment is committed to reform the energy sector by (i) developing a legal and regulatory\nframework for efficient energy sector operations, (ii) increasing the level of electricity tariffs\ntoward full cost recovery, (iii) encouraging private sector participation in the generation and\ndistribution of power, and (iv) promoting energy conservation. While progress in these areas\nslowed  recently  partly  due  to  the  poor  economic  situation  in  the  country  and  the  general\nelections, the Government nevertheless remains committed to the reform program and has\n                  \n44 After independence in 1991, Tajikistan suffered a five-year civil war. A peace agreement, signed in 1997, provided\nthe basis for national reconciliation and established a framework for holding parliamentary elections. Despite\noccasional disruptions, the peace process made significant progress in 1998 and 1999. Tajikistan\u2019s President was\nre-elected in November 1999. Holding parliamentary elections, which were completed in March 2000 as scheduled,\nconcluded the peace process. The UN Security Council withdrew its observers from Tajikistan in May 2000 and\nopened a small office in Dushanbe to support the country\u2019s stability.", "32\nagreed to continue the reform agenda through adoption of the ESAP, with emphasis on full cost\nrecovery for electricity supply and restructuring of Barki Tajik to improve its accountability and\nfinancial viability. To verify Barki Tajik\u2019s performance in meeting financial covenants set under\nthe Project, consulting services will be provided to audit Barki Tajik\u2019s corporate and project\naccounts for 2000 and 2001 in accordance with IAS. In conjunction with the Project, two TAs\n(paras.  95-97)  will  help  Barki  Tajik  improve  its  billing  and  collection  system  to  reduce  its\naccounts  receivable,  and  to  introduce  IAS  at  Barki  Tajik  to  make  its  corporate  accounts\ncompatible with international practices. With regard to maintenance, the proper maintenance of\nproject facilities is essential for the sustainability of project benefits. The Government and Barki\nTajik have agreed to implement recommendations of implementation consultants and to provide\nfor adequate funds annually for O&M. The Government also places priority on protecting the\npoor  and  vulnerable  groups  from  the  impact  of  tariff  increases,  and  in  that  regard  the\nGovernment agreed to maintain the lifeline tariff structure in the medium term and to use the\ninterest margin arising from onlent funds to Barki Tajik to fund the subsidy for the lifeline tariff.\nVI.

The financial statements of Barki Tajik are presented in Tables A7.1 to A7.3. Figures for\n1997-1999 are based on actual operations while those for 2000-2010 are projections based on\nnotes and assumptions described below.\nA.  Prices, Inflation, and Exchange Rate\n2.     Since the country\u2019s independence, the Tajik ruble has continually devalued against the\nUS dollar. The exchange rate per US dollar decreased from TJR50 in 1995 to TJR2,000 in\n2000, a depreciation of 97 percent in five years. Year-to-year inflation was 170 percent in\nSeptember 1997; this fell to 2.7 percent by December 1998, but rose to 64 percent by August\n1999.  The  medium-term  and  long-term  stability  of  both  local  inflation  and  the  Tajik  ruble\nexchange rate has not yet been established. The financial projections have been carried out in\ncurrent dollar equivalents considering the difficulty projecting prices of goods and services in\nTajik ruble. Prices in dollar terms are assumed to increase in accordance with the international\ninflation rate, estimated at 2.4 percent per year throughout the projection period.\nB.  Income Statement\n3.     Revenues. Electricity sales are estimated to grow at 2 percent per year during 2000-\n2002 and at an average of 3.2 percent during 2003-2004. With full realization of the benefits of\nthe Project, sales are expected to grow by an average of 5.3 percent annually during 2005-\n2015. The forecast increase in sales growth is lower than the actual growth in 1997-1999\nconsidering that Barki Tajik's generation capacity is limited by the poor operating condition of\nthe power plants. The average tariff as of August 2000 amounts to $0.0045/kilowatt-hour (kWh).\nTo achieve financial cost recovery and a return of 6 percent on net fixed assets by 2005, it is\nassumed that the average revenue will be increased by 25 percent annually during 2001-2005.\n4.     Operating Expenses. Fuel consumption is based on the requirements of the generating\nunits. Fuel used in the Dushanbe Thermal Power Plant is imported from Uzbekistan at about\n$50-55 per thousand cubic meters. Annual operating and maintenance expenses are estimated\nat 1.0 percent of gross fixed assets. Annual depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis at\n2.5 percent of revalued gross fixed assets.\n5.     Interest and Taxes. Interest expenses on long-term debt are calculated on the indicated\nterms and conditions on committed loans. Taxable income is subject to 30 percent income tax.\nC.  Balance Sheet\n6.     Fixed Assets. The fixed assets have been significantly undervalued in previous years. It\nis assumed that the assets will be revalued in 2000 with an estimated gross replacement value\nof $3.75 billion and an accumulated depreciation of $2.5 billion.", "47 Appendix 7, page 2\n7.     Accounts Receivable. It is expected that accounts receivable will amount to six months\ngross sales by 2001 and further improve to three months gross sales by 2002. Provision for bad\ndebts is made annually for 10 percent of the previous year\u2019s outstanding accounts receivable.\n8.     Long-Term Debt. Long-term debts take into account the financing required for the\nProject and the capital investment program of Barki Tajik. Financial conditions for the additional\nloans are assumed to be similar to those for project loans.\nD.  Cash Flow Statement\n9.     Capital Investment Program. The medium-term capital investment plan is based on\nBarki Tajik\u2019s indicated rehabilitation projects planned for the period 2001-2005.\n10.     Dividends. It is assumed that dividends will be declared whenever the year-end cash\nbalance exceeds minimum cash balance operating requirements.", "48 Appendix 7, page 3\nTable A7.1:  Income Statements\nBarki

Introduction\n1. The initial environmental examination (IEE) study was undertaken by consultants as a\npart of the technical assistance (TA)1 financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The\nsummary IEE report covers the environmental aspects of the proposed Project. The Project has\nfive parts and it covers mainly central and southern regions including Dushanbe, the capital of\nthe country. ADB fact-finding and appraisal missions visited the sites and held discussions with\ngovernment agencies, local government representatives, district officers, Barki Tajik (the state\npower company) representatives, and local residents during 10 to 25 April and 14 to 29 August\n2000.  ADB  classified  the  Project  as  environmental  category  B.  Barki  Tajik,  the  Executing\nAgency, prepared the summary IEE for the Project with the inputs from IEE, TA consultants,\nand ADB Missions.\nB. Description of the Project\n2. The aim of the Project is to improve power supply to end users in Tajikistan. As a\nconsequence of the break-up of the Soviet Union and the civil war from 1992 to 1996, much of\nthe electricity installations were destroyed or damaged in the country. The heavily degraded\nelectricity  transmission  and  distribution  systems  are  not  capable  of  providing  adequate\nelectricity supply to the end users, particularly poor and rural households.\n3. The Project comprises five parts. Part A consists of improving the power supply in\nKhatlon Region, the region south of the country. In addition to the general degradation of the\ntransmission, distribution, and supply network due to minimal maintenance over the last 10\nyears,  the  electricity  supply  network  in  this  region  has  suffered  considerably  from  the\nconsequences of the civil war. This component of the Project will improve power supply to a\nlarge number of households, mainly civil war returnee villages. One specific component consists\nof rehabilitating the Sovhoz 2 substation, in the Bishkent District. The rehabilitation will provide\nelectricity to a drainage pumping station that in the past provided drainage for 2,500 hectares of\nland, giving employment to 10,000 people. Because of the lack of reliable electricity supply, the\nland is heavily waterlogged and certain areas are flooded and cannot be cultivated. Well water\nhas become saline, requiring villagers to collect drinking water from the river. Part B comprises\nrehabilitation measures at Nurek Hydropower Plant (NHPP), the most important power plant in\nTajikistan. Part B consists of  (i) improvement measures at the 220 kilovolt (kV) switchyard;\n(ii) improvement of the NHPP tailrace; (iii) NHPP dam monitoring; and (iv) improvement of\nRegar 500 kV and 220 kV substations, through which a significant portion of the electricity\nsupplied in Dushanbe region is delivered, together with the main export-import to Uzbekistan\nand the Central Asia grid. Part C comprises rehabilitation of two 220/110 kV substations at\nNovaya and Djangal, by repairing and partially replacing electromechanical equipment. These\ntwo substations are main supply points for Dushanbe region, with about 1 million people. Part D\nwill provide funds for about 500 high voltage electronic meters to be installed at power stations\nand high voltage substations to measure exported and imported energy, generated and sent-out\nenergy,  and  the  energy  exchanged  between  each  of  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  regional  distribution\norganizations. Project implementation consulting services are provided under Part E.\n                  \n1 TA 3207-TAJ: Power Sector Development Project, for $840,000, approved on 17 June 1999.", "52\nAppendix 8, page 2\nC. Description of the Environment\n1. Physical Resources\n4. Tajikistan is characterized by a strongly continental climate with hot, dry summers and\ncold winters, especially in mountainous areas. Daily temperature fluctuations are usually quite\nlarge. The cold winters make heating a necessity for winter months in the whole country.\nApproximately 97 percent of the country is mountainous, and almost half of it is at altitudes of\nmore than 3,000 meters above sea level. The few flat areas available are intensively used for\nagriculture, which is done almost exclusively under irrigation. For this reason, the considerable\nwater resources of the country, stemming from the high mountain areas, are important for power\ngeneration as well as for irrigation. A large proportion of the irrigated areas lies in Khatlon, the\nregion where power supply will be improved by the Project.\n2. Biological Resources\n5. The project area consists mainly of two parts: (i) the immediate surroundings of NHPP,\nand (ii) the inhabited areas of the whole of Khatlon Region. Both these areas are intensively\nused and occupied by human activities. These areas have no rare or endangered species of\nwildlife or plants, and the Project will not have any negative effects on biological resources.\n6. The construction of the NHPP dam undoubtedly affected its environment, especially the\nriver ecosystem. However, the present Project will not influence or change the impacts of the\nexisting dam. Information about the situation before the dam was built in 1962 is not available.\nForests are a very rare resource in Tajikistan; only about 2.3 percent of the country is currently\ncovered with forests. The reduction of fuel imports, particularly gas from Uzbekistan and coal\nfrom Russia, has led to an increase in pressure on forests.\n3. Human and Economic Development\n7. Studies, including surveys made by the TA consultants, uniformly show a population\nwhich that is largely (83 percent) below the poverty line. In some of the districts that will be\nserved by the Project, more than half of the population left their homes during the civil war for\nother countries. Most have returned, but face a difficult situation, because many of their houses\nhave been destroyed. Electricity supply is unreliable due to damaged and deficient installations,\nand often dangerous because of makeshift electricity connections. The Project (Part A) will\nimprove this situation.\n8. Agriculture, mainly under irrigation, is the most important economic activity, and cotton is\nthe  most  important  product.  Since  much  of  the  irrigation  requires  electric  pumps,  the\nimprovement of electricity supply will contribute to an improvement in the general economic\ndevelopment or rehabilitation of the area. The Project will involve rehabilitating the Sovhoz 2\nsubstation.\nD. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Potential Environmental Impacts\n9. The  Project  consists  of  rehabilitating  existing  structures.  The  rehabilitation  will  be\nimplemented by small-scale, decentralized works (e.g., at all substations to be improved); no\nlarge construction site will be operated for project implementation. After completion, the Project", "", "54\nAppendix 8, page 4\nOther material, which cannot be recycled, will be deposited in controlled waste deposit sites and\nBarki Tajik agreed to take such steps during project implementation.\n12. During construction at any site, care will have to be taken to prevent contamination of\nsoil and water with fuel and lubricants. This can be done through storage of such substances (if\nany) in suitable containers away from water, preferably on an impermeable surface to prevent\noil from leaching into the ground, and by proper maintenance of machines and trucks. These\nare normal engineering procedures and detailed steps will be included in contract and bid\ndocuments. Barki Tajik will assure periodic site monitoring and supervision in order to ensure\ncompliance.\nE. Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n13. Environmental impact assessments and environmental monitoring in Tajikistan is the\nresponsibility of the Ministry of Environment (MOEN). MOEN has the human resources required\nto carry out its obligations, but lacks funding, which makes it difficult for staff to carry out these\nobligations.\n14. Barki Tajik has a small environmental unit and, given the importance of the relationship\nbetween energy and the environment and the pipeline of other energy projects in the country in\nfuture, Barki Tajik agreed to form an environmental and social monitoring unit to support project\nimplementation  activities.  Two  person-months  of  international  and  four  person-months  of\ndomestic consultant services will be provided under the Project to ensure all environmental\nmitigation  and  monitoring  activities  will  be  carried  as  specified  in  the  IEE.  The  people\nresponsible for this unit will also be trained in environmental and social monitoring activities. The\nproject implementation unit (PIU) will carry out proposed mitigation and monitoring measures on\nbehalf of Barki Tajik. MOEN will continue its supervisory and advisory functions.\n15. Environmental  monitoring  for  the  Project  includes  baseline  surveys,  periodic  visits,\nmonitoring and supervision of construction sites for contractors' compliance with regulations and\nassurance for proper disposal of waste material. The PIU, with support from the environmental\nand social monitoring unit within Barki Tajik, will keep MOEN and ADB informed about progress\nof environmental monitoring, and will submit review reports every six months.\nF. Findings and Recommendations\n16. The Project will improve power supply in Tajikistan (through improvements made at\nNHPP) particularly in the south of the country by improving distribution and transmission in 13\ndistricts of Khatlon Region. Adverse environmental impacts of the Project will be very small, and\nwill be limited to the construction period. The most important measures to be taken consist of\nproper disposal of discarded material (replaced transformers and exchanged transformer oil).\nAdverse impacts can be mitigated through standard engineering and good construction and civil\nworks procedures. No negative environmental impact will persist during the operation phase.\nThe Project will not involve resettlement or significant land acquisition.\n17. The Project will have considerable environmental benefits, mainly through (i) reducing\nlosses in energy production at NHPP; (ii) eliminating the risk of transformer oil polluting the\nVaksh River at NHPP; (iii) improving the safety of NHPP's dam; (iv) reducing electricity losses in\nthe distribution system in Khatlon Region, and (v) reducing pressure on alternative sources of\nenergy, mainly forest resources. In addition, the Project will have considerable social benefits\nthrough improving energy supply and thereby general living conditions of the population. In the", "55\nAppendix 8, page 5\nproject area, improved drinking water supplies; better heating for rural schools, hospitals, clinics,\nand other public facilities; and induced agricultural and income generating activities will improve\nthe social welfare significantly. Since all identified adverse environmental impacts are minor and\ncan  be  mitigated  through  standard  engineering  and  civil  works  practices,  a  detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment is not needed for the Project.", "56\nAppendix 9, page 1\nSUMMARY INITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\nA. Introduction\n1. An initial social assessment (ISA) was undertaken by consultants as part of the technical\nassistance (TA)1 financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The summary ISA covers\nsocial aspects of the Project. The Project has five parts covering the central and southern\nregions of Tajikistan. ADB fact-finding and appraisal missions visited the project area and held\ndiscussions with government agencies, local government representatives, district officers, Barki\nTajik (the state power company) representatives, and local residents from 10 to 25 April and\n14 to 29 August 2000. The summary ISA was prepared by Barki Tajik, the Executing Agency for\nthe Project, with inputs from consultants and ADB staff.\nB. Description of the Project\n2. The Project consists of five parts (main text, paras. 51-63).\nC. Present Living Conditions of the Population\n3. The population of Tajikistan was 6.13 million in early 2000 and is anticipated to reach\n11 million in 2025. The population is highly concentrated in the lower lying areas with fertile\nland, while mountainous areas are thinly populated. The 1997 gross domestic product per\ncapita  was  $178,  about  33  percent  of  its  level  prior  to  independence.  Tajikistan\u2019s  human\ndevelopment index decreased from 0.63 in 1991 to 0.54 in 1998, with the country ranked 108\nout of 174 countries surveyed. Tajikistan has a high level of poverty. Official data shows that\nalthough the nominal average monthly wages, minimum wages, and minimum pension have\nbeen  increasing  relative  to  1995  levels,  they  are  still  lower  than  1992  levels,  and  more\nimportantly, are significantly lower than the minimum consumption basket. Average monthly per\ncapita income is only 25.9 percent of the 1998 minimum consumption basket, and average\nmonthly wages, 38.9 percent. Legislated minimum wages and minimum pensions constitute\nonly 8.5 percent of the 1998 minimum consumption basket.\n4. Initial social examinations confirm the high levels of poverty, particularly in rural areas. In\nFebruary 2000 the State Statistical Agency estimated that 83 percent of the total population is\npoor, if monthly expenditure of TJR20,000 was used as the poverty line. Formal employment is\nlow, and where available, consists mostly of civil service employment, where salaries are often\nseveral months in arrears. Collective farms offer seasonal employment with wages of TJR2,000\nper month in spring and TJR10,000 during summer. Households supplement their incomes\nthrough home plots, animal husbandry, and small-scale retail. In most households visited, these\nconstituted  the  main  source  of  income.  In  some  areas  households  have  been  provided\nhumanitarian aid by donor agencies through the local government, consisting of 5 liters of\ncooking oil and/or 10 kilos of flour supplied every 3-6 months. Most income is received during\nsummer and fall, coinciding with harvests, but most expenses are incurred during winter and\nspring, mainly for heating and clothing.\n                  \n1 TA No. 3207-TAJ: Power Sector Development Project, for $840,000, approved on 17 June 1999.", "57\nAppendix 9, page 2\nD. Social Position of Women\n5. The  relative  position  of  women  has  deteriorated  based  on  the  United  Nations\nDevelopment Programme's gender-related development index, which fell from 0.571 to 0.534\nfrom  1995  to  1998.  Women  are  more  likely  to  be  unemployed  than  men,  with  their\nunemployment rates at 28.8 and 25.3 percent, respectively.2 Women\u2019s wages average $2 per\nmonth; men\u2019s wages are $6 per month. Women bear most, if not all of the burden of work within\nthe household and spend an average of 6.3 hours per day of unpaid work (cooking, working on\nprivate plots, cleaning, laundry, collecting fuelwood and biomass, etc.) compared to 3.3 hours\nby men.\n6. The project area includes Khatlon Region, consisting of 13 districts. The whole region\nhas been severely affected by war, which damaged infrastructure and forced a large proportion\nof the population to leave their homes. Most of the refugees have returned, and are facing\ndifficult conditions as most of their houses have been destroyed. The war left an estimated\n26,000 widows and 55,000 orphans, and their position is worse than that of the rest of the\npeople.\nE. Screening of Potential Impacts of the Project\n7. Field visits supported the view that provision of electricity will have a substantial impact\non the alleviation of poverty. Aside from high economic costs of using alternative fuel, time,\nlabor, health, social, and gender impacts are associated with scarcity of electricity. Fuelwood\nand agricultural biomass gathering takes 15 days for a month\u2019s supply. Cow dung briquettes are\nmade one hour of each day in summer, to generate the required supply for winter. These\nenergy sources are primarily gathered and prepared by women and children. The use of these\nenergy sources typically for cooking in unventilated rooms constitutes a health hazard for\nwomen and children, who spend approximately five hours per day in these cooking rooms. Safe\nwater is unavailable partly because of lack of electricity, and pumping from reservoirs and\ndeepwells  is  restricted.  The  alternatives  for  securing  water  and  storage  are  both  time\nconsuming, and often result in contaminated water.\n8. The collective farm Sovhoz 2 in the Bishkent District is of particular importance as it\nprovides  employment  to  10,000  people.  Due  to  lack  of  electricity  supply  to  the  drainage\npumping station, the land cannot be drained adequately for cultivation, and 2,500 hectares of\nland is now under saline water. Rehabilitation of the associated substation (under Part A) will\nprovide power to the pumping station.\n9. Metering  will  be  an  important  aspect  of  encouraging  energy  conservation  and  will\nprovide  for  a  fair  system  of  billing  based  on  consumption.  Where  there  are  no  meters,\nhouseholds do not practice energy conservation because electricity tariffs are based on the\nnumber of rooms per household. Although many households have arrears for their electricity\nbills, during focus group discussions, they indicated a willingness to pay up to double the\nexisting rates for reliable electricity supply.\n                  \n2  Falkingham, 1999. Women and Gender Relations in Tajikistan, London School of Economics, London.", "58\nAppendix 9, page 3\nF. Findings and Recommendations\n10. The Project will not have any adverse or undesirable social impacts. No resettlement is\nrequired, and the Project will not affect productive land or any other assets of the population.\nThe Project will directly improve electricity supply to a large number of villages, with a high\npercentage of returnee population. In addition, the Project will have considerable social benefits\nthrough  improving  the  general  living  conditions  of  the  population.  Such  benefits  include\nimproved drinking water supplies; better heating for rural schools, hospitals, clinics, and other\npublic facilities; improved drainage and control of malaria; increased agricultural production; and\ninduced income generating activities, that will improve the social welfare significantly. Therefore,\nthe Project will contribute in a substantial way to poverty reduction.\n11. Because 83 percent of the population live below the national poverty line, lifeline tariff\nsupport is essential to subsidize electricity payments of the poor. The lifeline tariff system\nprovides 150 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity to the poor without any real increase of price.\nOther options to maximize social impacts of the Project include awareness building in energy\nuse, safety, and energy conservation.  The Government has agreed to undertake a public\nawareness program to educate the public on the need for a rational tariff scheme and the\nimportance of energy conservation. In the future, Barki Tajik will promote integrated energy\ndevelopment programs with community participation and social mobilization, with emphasis on\ncleaner  and  alternative  energy  sources.  Current  community  structures  are  conducive  to\ncommunity participation and social mobilization in matters related to electricity provision, such\nas household safety in use of electricity, tree planting for fuelwood, and use of alternative\nsources of fuel.\n12. During the policy dialogue, Barki Tajik agreed to establish an environmental and social\nimpact monitoring unit to work very closely with the project implementation unit. This unit will\nalso carry out regular project benefit monitoring and evaluation activities, including annual\nreview reports. Barki Tajik agreed to provide the unit with adequate equipment, office supplies,\ntraining facilities, and staff resources throughout the project implementation period. Under the\nProject, two person-months of international and four person-months of domestic consultants\nwith expertise in social impact monitoring will be provided with the project implementation\nconsulting services.", "59\nAppendix 10, page 1\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT\n1. The Project was analyzed for its financial viability from the perspective of Barki Tajik\nbased on the following notes and assumptions:\n(i)   The Project will have a construction period of 5 years and an economic life of 10\nyears.\n(ii)   The  project  cost,  including  physical  contingencies  but  excluding  price\ncontingencies and interest during construction, is $52.9 million.\n(iii)   Revenues and costs are presented in constant 2000 prices.\n(iv)   Benefits in terms of additional electricity consumed on with-project and without-\nproject scenarios1 are valued at the projected tariffs of Barki Tajik. Benefits for\npart A: rehabilitation and power supply improvement in poor areas of Khatlon\nRegion, include (a) additional energy to returnee villages, (b) loss reduction in\nreturnee villages, (c) additional supply due to rehabilitation of the Sovhoz 2\nsubstation, (d) additional supply due to the rehabilitation of the southern region\ntransmission lines, and (e) additional supply due to the rehabilitation of the\nCentral  Hydropower  Plant.

Introduction\n1. The Project comprises five parts (main text, paras. 51-63). The project components are\npart of the least-cost energy development plan for the project area. The Project will generate\nincremental  energy,  improve  reliability  of  power  supply,  and  avoid  energy  losses,  thus\ncontributing to poverty reduction, social mobilization, and improvement of well being of the\npeople. Basic information about the Project and its benefits are summarized in Table A11.1.\nTable A11.1: Project Components and Benefits\nItem Unit Part A Part B Part C Part D Project\nEconomic Capital Cost (discounted)  $ million 13.08 14.37 7.63 0.67 35.75\nIncremental Energy   GWh 1,813 4,249 1,470 39 7,571\nHouseholds Served Directly Number 24,481 -   148,265 -   172,746\n - = not applicable\n Source:  Staff estimates.\nB. Assumptions\n2. For  all  components,  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios  were  compared\nbased on the following assumptions:\n(i)  Data for capital and operating costs were taken from the financial analysis and\nadjusted to reflect economic values. In calculating economic capital costs, all\nduties, taxes, and subsidies were excluded.\n(ii)  A 10-year1 operational economic life was assumed for the Project (total of 15\nyears  including  construction  period).  The  physical  contingency  factor  was\nassumed at 10 percent of capital costs.\n(iii)  All tradable commodities were valued at border prices at the prevailing exchange\nrate (TJR2,000 = $1). Nontradable commodities were valued at shadow price\nusing a standard conversion factor of 0.9.\n(iv)  The  generated  energy  is  comprised  of  two  components:  incremental  and\nnonincremental. The incremental component was valued at willingness-to-pay\n(WTP)  TJR90.1/kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  ($0.0450/kWh)  and  the  nonincremental\ncomponent  valued  at  resource  cost  savings  of  TJR64.8/kWh  ($0.0324/kWh).\nBoth of these values have been conservatively estimated.\n(v)  Similar to the other Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects, WTP for electricity\nwas estimated using the value of the most likely or next best alternative available\nfor electricity consumers. The weighted average value of different electricity user\n                  \n1  Since the Project does not involve complete rehabilitation of all components, a 10-year period for operation has\nbeen assumed on a conservative basis. Such an approach has been adopted on similar projects in other transition\neconomies, such as Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia.", "62\nAppendix 11, page 2\ncategories such as industry, households, and agriculture was used as the final\nfigure of WTP (paras. 9 and 10).\n(vi)  The value of complementary investments made by some households for such\nitems as bulbs, heaters, and stoves and the cost of connection to the system\nwere not included in the project cost.\nC. Part A\n3. Part A consists of rehabilitation and power supply improvement to poor areas in Khatlon\nRegion. It comprises improvement of the power supply, strengthening of transmission and\ndistribution networks, provision of consumer metering, and improvement of living conditions of\nabout 24,800 households.\n4. The major economic benefits of the component are an improvement in the Central\nHydropower Plant (15 megawatts), rehabilitation of about 100 villages in 13 districts of Khatlon\nRegion,  rehabilitation  of  district  transmission  and  distribution  system,  and  installation  of\nconsumer meters. The component\u2019s benefits include (i) avoided energy losses, (ii) reduction in\ntechnical and other energy losses, (iii) increased energy sales due to improved voltage and\nmore reliable electricity supply, (iv) savings in costs of operation and maintenance, and (iv)\nenhancement of well-being of households living in these villages.\nD. Part B\n5. Part  B  consists  of  rehabilitating  NHPP  and  associated  transmission  to  improve  its\nreliability of power supply. NHPP supplies about 80 percent of electricity generation in the\ncountry.  This plant was built in stages from 1962 to 1979 and there had been minimal or no\nmaintenance work carried out on a regular basis. As a result, heavy siltation and deposition of\nother debris downstream of NHPP effectively reduced the design head by about six meters,\ncausing substantial loss of electricity generation.  The switchyard is built on ground that has\nbecome unstable and this can cause major problems if the foundations are not rehabilitated.\nFailure of one switchyard could reduce power transmission for several months causing major\neconomic loss.\nE.  Part C\n6. Part C includes improvement of the reliability of electricity supplied in Dushanbe region,\nthe  national  capital  district.  This  component  will  cover  rehabilitation  of  two  substations,\nrelocating the existing transformers to locations outside the city.\n7. The  provision  of  better  transformers  and  modernization  of  distribution  system  in\nDushanbe region will greatly improve economic activities in the national capital region, which is\nsubject to frequent power shortages under prevailing conditions. These substations are critical\nbut are overloaded, more than 30 years old, and at the end of their economic life. Their\nrehabilitation will improve energy transmission efficiency, reduce energy losses, and improve\nworkplace safety.\nF.  Parts D and E\n8. Part D includes provision of electricity meters to measure power exports and imports and\npower exchanged between distribution networks. The estimated cost of about $0.7 million was", "63\nAppendix 11, page 3\nincluded in the economic analysis but in view of the small benefits, a separate analysis was not\nundertaken. Similarly, only the cost of part E, provision of consulting services, was included in\nthe economic analysis. The benefits are small and as it would be difficult to disaggregate the\nbenefits, these have been conservatively taken as zero.\nG. Willingness to Pay\n9. Similar to the other ADB projects, WTP for electricity was estimated using value of the\nmost likely or next best alternative available for electricity users. The weighted average of costs\nof different electricity user categories (such as industry, households, and agriculture) was used\nas the final figure of WTP (Table A11.2).\nTable A11.2: Willingness to Pay for Electricity\n           Cost\nSupply Option             (TJR/kWh)\nAverage Tariff   9.0\nLarge Power Plant (Coal fired 300 MW) 124.0\nSmall Diesel  Generator (0.5 MW) 254.0\nKerosene 422.0\nIndustrial Tariff   13.6\nHousehold Tariff     7.0\nCommercial/Agriculture    27.0\nImported Electricity Cost  100.0\nWTP Estimatea     90.1\n     a  Weighted average based on electricity consumption: industry = 41 percent;\n          water supply and agriculture = 18 percent; households = 36 percent; and\n          Government and others = 5 percent.\n     Source: Staff estimates.\n10. The incremental power output of the Project is valued on the basis of weighted average\nof WTP of TJR90.1/kWh ($0.0450/kWh). This is based on (i) an upper bound of TJR422.0/kWh\nfor alternative energy source (kerosene) and a lower bound of TJR7.0/kWh (average tariff for\nhouseholds), and (ii) curve-linear relationship of 0.3. The nonincremental part of the electricity\ngeneration was estimated taking into account the weighted average cost of alternative (present\nuse) energy sources. Cost data for this estimation was obtained from the participatory poverty\nimpact analysis conducted during the feasibility study stage (Appendix 12).\nH. Least Cost Analysis\n11. There is no alternative to the Project given the urgent need for improved power output\nand fiscal constraints on building new power facilities. The diversity among project components\nmade such analysis not possible. However, during the feasibility study, the Project was divided\ninto a large number of subcomponents and a set of potential alternatives, including a do-nothing\noption, and their costs were analyzed. For example, NHPP tailrace dredging was compared with\nfour options: (i) importing an additional 320 gigawatt-hours (GWh), (ii) building a new hydro or\ndiesel power plant providing 320 GWh, (iii) increasing efficiency of the turbine with new runners,\nand (iv) do-nothing. The proposed tailrace dredging is the least cost option. In a similar manner,\nleast-cost options were examined for the 13 subcomponents of the Project, resulting in more\nthan 25 options. These analyses confirmed that all project components are a part of the least-\ncost plan for power subsector development in the country.", "64\nAppendix 11, page 4\nI. Cost-Benefit Analysis\n12. The base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 28.0 percent,\nwhich is above ADB\u2019s threshold for economic viability of 12 percent (Table A11.3). Calculation\ndetails  are  presented  in  Table  A11.4.  Economic  viability  remains  robust  with  changes  in\nassumptions. Sensitivity analysis was carried out for various changes such as increase in\ncapital  cost,  reduction  in  revenue,  delay  in  implementation,  and  a  combination  of  cases\n(Table A11.3).

The EIRR for the Project is estimated at 28.0 percent, which is favorable relative to\nADB\u2019s generally accepted cutoff rate of 12 percent. A high EIRR is normal for rehabilitation\nprojects,  due  to  their  substantial  benefits.  The  Project\u2019s  assumptions  are  conservative,\nestimated economic indicators are robust, poverty reduction benefits are substantial, and project\ncomponents are part of the least cost plan for power subsector development in the country.\nTherefore, the proposed Project is economically justified.", "Table A11.4: Economic Analysis\n(TJR million)\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\nPART A\nCapital Cost           1,599               9,174             15,752            6,112         5,007\nO&M                15                    98                  241               297            328             354                   354             354            3 54              354           3 54          3 54           354           354                354\nBenefits 0 0               2,107            5,989         9,526        10,078              10,561        11,034       1 1,508         11,963       11,963     1 1,963      11,963      11,963           11,963\nNet Benefits          (1,613)              (9,272)            (13,886)             ( 420)         4,191          9,723              10,206        10,680       1 1,153         11,609      1 1,609     1 1,609      11,609      11,609           11,609\nEIRR               24.2\nNPV           18,484\nPART B\nCapital Cost 0             18,241             15,341            3,135\nO&M 0                  166                  305               334            361             361                   361             361            3 61              361           3 61          3 61           361           361                361 65\nBenefits 0 0 0          11,606       20,534        20,832              21,055        21,278       2 1,576         21,799       21,799     2 1,799      21,799      21,799           21,799\nNet Benefits 0            (18,407)            (15,646)            8,138       20,173        20,471              20,694        20,917       2 1,215         21,438      2 1,438     2 1,438      21,438      21,438           21,438\nEIRR               40.3\nNPV           58,422\nPART C\nCapital Cost              196               4,861             10,133            5,076\nO&M                  2                    46                  138               184            209             209                   209             209            2 09              209           2 09          2 09           209           209                209\nBenefits 0 0 0               373            549             856                2,341          4,550         9 ,085         14,958       14,958     1 4,958      14,958      14,958           14,958\nNet Benefits             (198)              (4,907)            (10,271)           (4,888)            340             647                2,132          4,341         8 ,876         14,749      1 4,749     1 4,749      14,749      14,749           14,749\nEIRR               21.6\nNPV           13,801\nPROJECT A\nCapital Cost           4,286             35,214             42,417          15,269         5,007 p\np\nO&M                16                  322                  699               830            914             940                   940             940            9 40              940           9 40          9 40           940           940                940 e\nBenefits 0 0               2,107          17,968       30,608        31,765              33,956        36,862       4 2,168         48,720       48,720     4 8,720      48,720      48,720           48,720 n\nd\nNet Benefits          (4,302)            (35,536)            (41,010)            1,873       24,691        30,828              33,019        35,925       4 1,231         47,783      4 7,783     4 7,783      47,783      47,783           47,783 ix\nEIRR               28.0  1\nNPV           84,616 1\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; NPV = net present value; O&M = operation and maintenance. , p\nSource:  Staff estimates. a\ng\ne\n 5", "66\nAppendix 12, page 1\nSUMMARY POVERTY IMPACT ANALYSIS\nA. Introduction\n1. The poverty reduction impact of the Project was assessed during project preparation.1\nSix  household-based  focus  groups,  three  village-based  workshops,  four  discussions  with\ninterest groups, and a national-level consultative meeting with stakeholders were conducted in\nthe project area. Participatory development exercises were held to understand the quality and\naccessibility of electricity and determine its linkages with levels of poverty in the project area.\nThe Project has five parts (paras. 51-63 of the main report).\nB. Poverty in Tajikistan\n2. Tajikistan  is  composed  of  four  geographical  regions:  Gorno-Badakhshan,  Khatlon,\nLenninabad, and Region of Republican Subordination. Although the country was the poorest\nrepublic in the former Soviet Union, investment in social infrastructure through large budget\ntransfers from Moscow, equivalent to 40 percent of gross domestic product, helped sustain\nsocial and economic infrastructure. Tajikistan inherited high levels of human capital which have\nnot been sustained after independence, when the absence of budget transfers, collapse of\ninterrepublican trading, poor economic management until mid-1990s, civil conflict, and major\nnatural disasters led to a decline in living conditions.\n3. Tajikistan  is  experiencing  high  levels  of  poverty.  A  World  Bank  study2  reports  that\napproximately 83 percent of the population are poor, and have insufficient resources to cover all\nbasic needs of food, shelter, clothing, education, and health despite supplementary income.\nSome of the poverty is cyclical, with shortages of fuel during winter and food during spring. Of\nthis group, roughly 5 percent are classified as destitute, and unable to care for themselves\n(including the aged, orphans and street children, disabled, and unemployed); and 12 percent\nare experiencing extreme poverty, facing chronic food insecurity or malnutrition with no regular\nor dependable source of income.\n4. Although the nominal average monthly wages, minimum wages, and minimum pension\nhas been increasing relative to 1995 levels, they are substantially lower than 1992 levels, and\nmore importantly, are significantly lower than the cost of the minimum consumption basket.\nAverage monthly per capita income is only 25.9 percent of the 1998 minimum consumption\nbasket; average monthly wages, 38.9 percent. Legislated minimum wage and minimum pension\nconstitute only 8.5 percent of the 1998 minimum consumption basket.\n5. Based  on  income  and  expenditure  patterns  of  households,3  the  national  minimum\nconsumption basket in 1998 was equivalent to TJR18,399. Since there is no regional minimum\nconsumption basket for Khatlon Region, if TJR15,000 was used as the poverty line, at least\n80.2 percent of the population is poor based on their incomes. Using expenditure patterns, the\npercentage of poor individuals is slightly higher at 81.4 percent. Rural poverty based on the\nminimum consumption basket is lower than urban poverty based on income at 79.3 percent and\n85.5 percent, respectively; and slightly higher based on expenditures at 81.3 percent and 81.1\npercent, respectively.\n                                                          \n1 TA  5894-REG:  Facilitating Capacity Building and Participatory Activities II,  for  $400,000,  approved  on\n28 December 1999.\n2  Falkingham, J. 1999.

Potential Poverty Reduction Impacts\n6. Participatory development exercises confirm high levels of poverty, particularly in rural\nareas.  Formal  employment  is  low,  and  where  available,  consists  mostly  of  civil  service\nemployment where salaries are often several months in arrears; or seasonal employment in\ncollective farms paying TJR2,000 per month during spring and TJR10,000 during summer.\nWomen have lower levels of formal employment than men. Women spend more time at home\ndoing unpaid work. Households supplement their incomes through working on home plots, milk\nproduction, livestock, and small-scale retail. In most households visited, these constituted the\nmain  source  of  income.  Poor  households  receive  from  donor  agencies  through  the  local\ngovernment humanitarian aid consisting of 5 liters of cooking oil and/or 10 kilos of flour supplied\nevery 3-6 months. Most income is received during summer and fall, coinciding with harvests, but\nmost expenses are incurred during winter and spring, mainly for heating and clothing.\n7. Before independence in 1991, electricity supply had been reliable. But since then, the\nprovision of electricity has deteriorated sharply. Households confirm that electricity is available\nintermittently for most of the year except during the winter months (December to March) when\nelectricity is only available for 2-4 hours a day. Because of lack of electricity, people have\nincreased  their  reliance  on  alternative  sources  of  fuel.  The  most  typical  alternatives  are\nfuelwood, agricultural waste, animal dung, and diesel. Three to five cubic meters of fuelwood\nand agricultural waste are required per month during winter, and 1-2 cubic meters during\nsummer months. At a market value of TJR5,000 per cubic meter, households spend as much as\nTJR25,000 (including time and cost) on fuel during winter months. Where fuelwood is scarce,\nanimal dung is used intensively, averaging 1,500 briquettes per household during winter months\nand 300 briquettes during rest of the year, valued at TJR15,000 mainly for labor cost. Diesel is\nprimarily  used  for  lighting  and  igniting  fuelwood  or  animal  dung.  Interviews  with  some\nhouseholds show that the cost for using diesel for illumination can reach TJR18,000 during\nwinter when electricity is not available. Other alternatives such as kerosene, coal, and liquefied\npetroleum gas, though available, are used in limited quantities due to prohibitive costs. Further,\nthe sources of these fuels are typically several kilometers from villages, and households do not\nstore these fuels due to indoor safety considerations.\n8. Field visits supported the view that the provision of electricity will have substantial impact\non reduction of poverty and improving the living conditions of the poor. In Tajikistan, as in other\nCentral Asian countries, electricity provision has clear links with the level of poverty. Due to\nharsh winters, heat is a basic need. For three decades the Tajik people had reliable, year-round\nelectricity, but are now often deprived of it.\n9. Alternative fuels are expensive and entail high costs in time, labor, health, social and\ngender impacts. Fuelwood, agricultural waste, and biomass gathering takes 15 days for one\nmonth of use. Households spend one hour daily each summer making cow dung briquettes to\ngenerate the required supply for winter. Gathering and preparing these energy sources is done\nprimarily by women and children. The use of these energy sources, typically for cooking in\nunventilated rooms, is a health hazard for women and children who spend approximately five\nhours per day in these cooking rooms. During focus group discussions, participants ranked\nelectricity as the best form of energy based on availability, convenience, affordability, time,\nindoor safety, environmental considerations, and storage requirements. This is often followed by\nfuelwood, agricultural wastes, animal dung, and diesel.", "68\nAppendix 12, page 3\n10. Households identified the lack of food, clothing, shelter, water, and employment as the\nmain issues concerning poverty, and recognized that energy is an important element in the\nprovision of basic needs. In the areas visited, safe water is unavailable partly because of the\nlack  of  electricity.  Prior  to  independence,  piped  water  had  been  provided  to  households.\nHowever, due to the irregular and inadequate electricity supply, pumping from reservoirs and\ndeepwells has been restricted. The people have coped by obtaining water from rivers and\nreservoirs using donkeys and trolleys, and may have to travel up to 15 kilometers to such\nsources. Due to transportation and storage, water obtained is often contaminated. Community\norganizations  have  developed  open  water  pools  made  of  compacted  clay  to  store  water\ndelivered by trucks for local consumption. However, the pools are exposed to contamination,\nmaking their water unsuitable for drinking. This water is often not boiled due to the scarcity of\nelectricity.\n11. On the issue of employment, the large agricultural base, which depends on irrigation,\nhas suffered from the unavailability of pumped irrigation. As a result, the yield has dropped to\n20-25 percent of former levels. In one village, 2,500 hectares of productive fields that once\nemployed 10,000 individuals have become flooded. The flood water is saline, and this has\ncontaminated the groundwater. Malaria is also common in the area. In areas where the problem\nis not as severe, pumping and drainage facilities often break down, and irrigation is available\nonly irregularly.\n12. The provision of education and health services to the population is similarly hampered\nby the lack of electricity. Since electricity is available in rural areas for only up to two hours daily\nduring winter, schools do not receive adequate electricity for heating and lighting. They have\ntried alternative forms of energy, such generators, but these have not been widely adopted\nbecause of the high cost involved. In some areas, children are asked to bring a bundle of\nfuelwood or agricultural waste to fuel indoor stoves. Because heating is often not available,\nschools are typically closed for two months during winter, and operate for extended hours during\nsummer, which has negative psychological effects on students. School enrolment has dropped,\nparticularly since poor children may lack warm clothes and shoes, and therefore do not attend\nschool during the rest of winter. Hospitals also lack heating. In winter, surgical operations can\nonly be performed during the few hours when electricity is available. This affects the ability to\nrespond to emergency medical situations and forces hospitals to prioritize cases accordingly.\nMedicines and vaccines cannot be properly stored at controlled conditions due to the lack of\nelectricity. As a consequence, many hospitals have been closed and those that are open are at\nthe administrative centers. This results in high transportation costs and travel time for patients,\nleading to even higher expenses for the poor who do not live near the centers.\n13. Households  identified  employment  and  small  entrepreneurial  activities  they  could\nundertake if electricity were available. Households invest considerable time collecting alternative\nfuel (such as fuelwood, agricultural waste or cow dung). This prevents women from greater\nparticipation in the labor force and limits productive home activities such as working on home\nplots. If more electricity were available, households would  (i) increase their entrepreneurial\nactivities  such  as  grain  milling,  baking,  sewing,  small-scale  and  trade  activities;  (ii)  have\nincreased information from mass media; and (iii) have greater convenience from use of light\nbulbs and small household appliances. Electricity is also necessary for encouraging private\ninvestments.", "69\nAppendix 12, page 4\nD.  Benefit Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis\n14. The difference between the financial and economic net present values, and consequent\ngains and losses for different project participants, provide the basis for considering the impact of\nthe Project on the poor. For the poverty impact assessment, the project beneficiaries are divided\ninto three groups: consumers, Government economy, and labor. The net economic benefits by\ngroup are distributed between poor and nonpoor.\n15. The principal economic benefit of the Project to the consumers will arise from increasing\nthe power supply to meet incremental electricity demand, particularly in war damaged areas.\nThe incremental electricity in the project area will benefit the poor more than the nonpoor as\ntheir consumption is projected to increase faster because of (i) their current lower electricity\nconsumption level,  (ii) the lower electricity tariffs compared to alternative energy costs, and\n(iii) more connections due to the Project. The consumers will also benefit from rehabilitation of\nNurek Hydropower Plant, as it is the least-cost option. Based on the Project's share of poor\nconsumers, their electricity consumption pattern, and the number of people living below the\npoverty  line,  59  percent  of  the  benefits  to  consumers  would  go  to  the  poor.  This  is  a\nconservative estimate given that indirect benefits from industrial consumption and all other\nsources have not been fully taken into account and are likely to benefit the poor more than\nothers. In Tajikistan, 83 percent of the population live below official poverty line. Staff estimated4\nthat 76 percent of the return to the Government benefits the poor. Similarly, 70 percent of the\nlabor benefits are expected to go to the poor.\n16. The increased, more efficient, and more reliable electricity supply resulting from the\nProject will benefit the poor directly and indirectly (Table A12). The net economic benefits\naccruing to the poor amount to $27 million. Thus, 57 percent of the net economic benefits of the\nProject will accrue to the poor (i.e., the poverty impact ratio is 57 percent). Some indirect\neconomic and social benefits were not captured in this analysis. If these benefits were also\nconsidered, it is expected that a substantial portion of the project benefits will go to the poor, in\nsupport of the Project's primary objective of poverty reduction.\n                                                          \n4 UNDP's and World Bank's Tajikistan Living Standards Survey, May 1999.", "70\nAppendix 12, page 5\nTable A12 :  Benefit Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis\n($ million)\nBenefits Beneficiaries\nFinancial Economic Government\nAccounts Accounts Difference Consumers Economy Labor Total\nA.

Conclusions\n17. The Project will help reduce poverty, and its poverty impact ratio is 57 percent. The\nproject area is characterized by high levels of poverty and is largely rural. Electricity is a basic\nneed in the project area for heat, cooking, and pumping of safe drinking water. The Project will\nalso support the improvement of essential services such as water for irrigation, education, and\nhealth. It will provide direct employment, and make the environment conducive for generating\nmore jobs through (i) economic development as a direct input of production, and (ii) reducing\nthe  time  spent  on  using  energy  alternatives  for  more  productive  activities.  This  will  have\nsignificant impact on vulnerable groups, particularly women and children.", "71\nAppendix 13, page 1\nIMPACT OF TARIFF INCREASES ON THE POOR IN TAJIKISTAN\nA.  Introduction\n1. Electricity tariffs have to be increased over the coming years to full cost recovery (FCR)\nof electricity supply, to ensure the financial sustainability of Barki Tajik. However, the increase in\ntariff is especially difficult for the poor to bear, particularly households headed by women,\nhouseholds with the elderly people, and rural households with many children. Therefore, a\nmechanism is needed to safeguard the poor from the effects of increased electricity tariff.\nB. Options for Consideration\n2. Under  Asian  Development  Bank  funded  technical  assistance1  (TA),  five  options  for\nelectricity tariffs were investigated, taking into account the current situation in Tajikistan:\n(i)  charge a tariff equal to FCR with no subsidy;\n(ii)  charge  a  tariff  equal  to  FCR  and  pay  a  subsidy  to  the  poorest\n20 percent  of households so that they are left no worse off for the price increase;\n(iii)  charge  a  tariff  equal  to  FCR  and  pay  a  subsidy  to  the  poorest\n20 percent of households that partially offsets the increased burden of paying a\nhigher tariff;\n(iv)  continue to provide 150 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month at the existing price to all\nhouseholds  (with  no  real  increase)  and  charge  a  tariff  equal  to  FCR  for\nconsumption in excess of 150 kWh; and\n(v)  implement a three-tier pricing system: a subsidized rate for the first 150 kWh per\nmonth  for  all  households,  a  tariff  equal  to  FCR  for  the  second\n150 kWh, and a tariff above cost for any consumption in excess of 300 kWh per\nmonth.\n3. The TA concluded that the first option is not viable as it does not have a social safety\ncomponent. Other than the lifeline tariff initiated in 1999, Tajikistan currently has no functioning\nsafety net. If residential tariffs were raised to FCR as per option 1, this would be a 500 percent\nincrease in tariff to the poor, who would be spending 8.3 percent of their incomes on electricity\ncompared to current expenditures of 1.8 percent.2 Options 2 and 3 pose difficulties, namely: (i)\nthe definition of the poverty line (the \"poorest 20 percent\" is an arbitrary line without any\nobjective poverty criteria); (ii) the identification of households entitled for lifeline subsidy, as\nmany people who would be entitled for nonemployment payment or other social security are not\nregistered, partly because the procedures involved are cumbersome and costs are high; and\n                                                          \n1 TA 3114-TAJ: Institutional Strengthening of the Transport and Energy Sectors, for $1.5 million, approved on\n10 December 1998.\n2  Since poor households spend about 79 percent of their income on food, if tariffs were raised to FCR, about\n40 percent of their nonfood expenditure would be on electricity alone, compared to 9 percent at present.", "72\nAppendix 13, page 2\n(iii) the actual disbursement of the lifeline subsidy. Option 4 overcomes these problems but\ntreats  all  households  equally.  However,  as  83  percent  of  the  population  is  poor,  it  is  not\nabsolutely  devoid  of  targeting,  since  only  the  first  150  kWh  is  subsidized.  Option  5  is  a\nrefinement of option 4 and is not feasible with the present economic situation as it requires a\nsignificant number of households consuming over 300 kWh per month to provide the cross-\nsubsidy.\n4. Option 4 represents the status quo up to a consumption level of 150 kWh per month as a\nlifeline tariff, with increases in tariff up to FCR for consumption beyond 150 kWh. Based on data\nof Falkingham3 and the World Bank survey,4 and on the assumption that 150 kWh as a basic\nsupply to be subsidized, the findings of this analysis show that the poorest 20 percent of\nhouseholds, under present conditions, pay 3 percent of their monthly income for electricity.\nIncome as defined includes the monetized contribution of their subsistence production, as\n83 percent of the population are poor.  Since salaries make up only a part of the total income,\nthe electricity bill consumes a larger percentage of their actual cash income.\nC. Estimation of Cost of Lifeline Subsidy\n5. Lifeline subsidy for electricity supply of households involves costs, which will have to be\npaid by the Government to Barki Tajik. Based on certain assumptions, the financial cost of the\nlifeline tariff subsidy was estimated. Table A13 highlights these costs, which are based on the\nfollowing assumptions. The present level of lifeline tariff is $0.0025/kWh and this is adjusted for\ninflation only. The present level of electricity consumption is about 80 kWh per month per\nhousehold  and  this  is  not  expected  to  increase  without  the  Project.  This  is  a  reasonable\nassumption as electricity supply will deteriorate without the Project. Poor households require\nabout 150 kWh of electricity per month for basic needs. This includes lighting, heating (during\nwinter only), and cooking for four hours per day.\n6. The analysis shows the subsidy per year by the Government to fund the lifeline tariff will\nrise from 2004 (about $0.6 million) to 2008 (about $4.0 million). As the Government proposes to\nuse the interest margin arising from relending of Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan and\ncofinancier (Swiss Government) proceeds to fund subsidies to Barki Tajik for the lifeline tariff,\nthe net subsidy per year from Government budget in 2004 is expected to be about $0.6 million,5\nwhich rises to $2.1 million in 2008. Hence, during 2004 to 2008, a cumulative subsidy of about\n$6.3 million is required from the Government budget. On average this is equivalent annually to\nabout 1 percent of the current annual Government budget. The Government has agreed that it\nwill take necessary measures to make up for any shortfall in the subsidy to Barki Tajik arising\nfrom the implementation of the lifeline tariff.\nD. Conclusion\n7. Inclusion of all households in the lifeline subsidy is justified because 83 percent of the\npopulation are poor, and eliminates the administrative problem of targeting and delivering to\nthose entitled to the subsidy. The present lifeline tariff of TJR5/kWh is considered acceptable for\npoor households. After the power supply improves, the lifeline subsidy is to be reviewed and\n                                                          \n3  Falkingham, J. 1999.

The aim should be to ultimately eliminate the lifeline subsidy by a gradual\nrise of the tariff until this reaches FCR.\n8. The Government in principle has agreed to:\n(i)  maintain  the  current  lifeline  tariff  (in  real  terms)  and  level  until  the  national\npoverty reduction strategy, which is to be finalized in mid-2001, is implemented\n(among the proposals to be considered include a cash compensation scheme for\nthe poor and vulnerable groups, and the gradual introduction of a three-tier tariff\nfor residential consumers);\n(ii)  discuss  with  the  national  Poverty  Reduction  Working  Group  and  develop  a\nproposal for a satisfactory safety net for the poor and vulnerable groups affected\nby  electricity  tariff  increases;  proposals  must  be  acceptable  to  ADB  and\nsubmitted by January 2002 as per the Energy Sector Action Plan; and\n(iii)  hold a public awareness program from January 2001 to educate the public on the\nneed for a rational tariff scheme and the importance of energy conservation.", "Table A13: Financial Subsidy Calculation\nItem 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\nResidential Consumers\n  Khatlon Region (Part A) 24,481 25,215 25,972 26,751 27,554 28,380 29,232 30,109 31,012\n  Dushanbe Region (Part D) 148,265 151,230 154,255 157,340 160,487 163,697 166,970 170,310 173,716\nTotal Consumers in Project Area 172,746 176,446 180,227 184,091 188,040 192,077 196,202 200,418 204,728\nIncremental Consumers 0 3,700 7,481 11,345 15,294 19,331 23,456 27,672 31,982\nConsumption without Project (kWh) 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80\nConsumption with Project (kWh) 80 80 80 80 100 110 150 170 190\nIncremental Consumption up to Lifeline 0 0 0 0 20 30 70 70 70\nDomestic Tariff (US\u00a2/kWh) 0.55 0.63 0.79 0.99 1.24 1.54 1.70 1.87 2.06\nLifeline Tariff (US\u00a2/kWh) 0.25 0.32 0.32 0.32 0.32 0.32 0.32 0.32 0.32\nSubsidy per kWh 0.30 0.32 0.47 0.67 0.92 1.23 1.38 1.55 1.74\nAdditional Subsidy ($ thousand/yr)\n  - For New Consumers $0 $11 $34 $73 $168 $313 $583 $773 $1,000\n  - For Increased Consumption of Present Consumers $0 $0 $0 $0 $414 $848 $2,276 $2,611 $2,989 7\n4\nTotal Subsidy Required ($ thousand/year) $0 $11 $34 $73 $583 $1,161 $2,859 $3,384 $3,989\nLoan Relending Differential Income ($ thousand) $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $2,012 $1,919 $1,825\nNet Budgetary Transfer ($ thousand per year) $0 ($11) ($34) ($73) ($583) ($1,161) ($847) ($1,465) ($2,164)\nNet BudgetaryTransfer - Cumulative ($ thousand) $0 ($11) ($45) ($118) ($701) ($1,862) ($2,709) ($4,174) ($6,338)\nkWh = kilowatt-hour.\nSource:  Staff estimates\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 1\n3\n, p\na\ng\ne\n 4"], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070710102922+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20010827175538Z", "Title": "Power Rehabilitation Project ", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Author": "j3m", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows"}}
