About  79  percent  of\nbeneficiaries  live  below  the  poverty  line.  Based  on  the\nclassification  criteria  applicable  in  2001,  the  Project  would\nqualify as a core poverty intervention.\n\nThe power sector in Tajikistan has been severely affected by\nthe disintegration of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in\n1990.  Construction  of  new  hydropower  plants  has  been\nhalted,  and  maintenance  of  the  existing  infrastructure  has\nbeen neglected due to lack of funds.  As a result of the poor\neconomic situation of the country and damage caused by the\ncivil war, power supply is on the verge of collapse. In addition,\nwith  the  increase  in  prices  of  gas  and  petroleum  imports,\nresidential  consumers  have  switched  to  electricity,  generated\nby hydropower plants. This has placed additional demand on\nthe  generation  facilities.  Power  cuts  are  common  throughout\nthe  year,  especially  during  winter  when  insufficient  electricity\nis  provided  in  rural  areas.  Without  improvements  in  power\nsupply,  the  living  conditions,  particularly  of  the  poor,  will\ncontinue to be miserable. Social surveys during the feasibility\nstudy for the Project confirmed that the poor have significantly\nless  access  to  electricity  supply  than  other  sectors  of  the\npopulation. Given the urgent need to overcome power supply\nconstraints and to increase the efficiency of energy supply and\nuse,  top  priority  is  being  given  in  the  medium  term  to\nretrofitting  and  rehabilitating  existing  power  facilities  rather\nthan  adding  new  capacity.  Such  measures  will  particularly\nbenefit the poor who cannot afford alternative fuels.\n\nThe Project will (i) improve people's quality of life and support\npoverty  reduction  in  the  project  areas  by  increasing  the\navailability  of  electricity;  and  (ii)  assist  in  the  postconflict\nrecovery  of  Tajikistan's  economy.  This  will  be  achieved  by\nincreasing the availability and reliability of power supply in an\nenvironment-friendly  manner,  through  the  rehabilitation  of\nexisting generation, transmission, and distribution facilities.\n\n\fii\n\nScope\n\nPart A: rehabilitation and power supply improvement in poor  war-\ndamaged areas of Khatlon Region, consisting of rehabilitating CHPP,\nstrengthening transmission and distribution networks, installing consumer\nmeters, and providing electricity to about 24,000 mostly poor households.\n\nPart  B:  rehabilitation  of  NHPP  and  associated  transmission\nfacilities  to  improve  reliability  of  power  supply  from  this  most\nimportant power plant in Tajikistan.\n\nPart  C:  rehabilitation  of  two  major  distribution  substations  in\nDushanbe  region  to  improve  reliability  of  power  supply  to\nabout 148,000 mostly poor households.\n\nPart D: improvement of bulk metering for import and export of electricity\nfrom and to the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan, and for power exchange\namong regional distribution networks.\n\nPart E: consulting services to support project implementation,\naudit  corporate  and  project  accounts  of  Barki  Tajik  for  fiscal\nyears  2000  and  2001,  and  develop  implementing  regulations\nfor the Energy Law.\n\nThe Project is estimated to cost $62.8 million equivalent comprising a\nforeign exchange cost of $49.3 million and a local currency cost of $13.5\nmillion equivalent.\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will finance $34 million of\nthe foreign exchange cost, representing 54 percent of the total\nproject  cost.  Parallel  cofinancing  totaling  $15.3  million  (24\npercent) is proposed by  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IDB)\nand  the  Swiss  Government  to  meet  the  remaining  foreign\nexchange  requirements.

The proceeds of\ncofinancing  by  the  Swiss  Government  will  be  relent  by  the\nGovernment \nto  Barki  Tajik  under  similar  conditions  as\nrelending  of  the  ADB  loan.  The  proceeds  of  cofinancing  by\nIDB  will  be  relent  by  the  Government  to  Barki  Tajik  on  the\nsame terms as that to the Government. The foreign exchange\nrisk related to all relending will be borne by the Government.\n\nThe  Government  will  retain  $0.6  million  equivalent \ndeveloping implementing regulations for the Energy Law.\n\nfor\n\nBarki  Tajik  has  established  a  project  implementation  unit,\nheaded  by  a  project  manager, \nto  coordinate  project\nimplementation  activities  and  to  liaise  with  ADB  and  the\ncofinanciers.  Project  implementation  will  be  coordinated  with\nthe  local  United  Nations  office  to  ensure  safe  working\nconditions.\n\nAll  goods  and  services  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nprocured \nProcurement. Contract packages financed by the cofinanciers\nwill be procured using their procedures.\n\nThe consultants will be recruited by the Government and Barki\nTajik  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on\nthe engagement of domestic consultants. The consulting input\nwill  comprise  (i)  for  project  implementation,  106  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  110  person-months  of  domestic\nconsultants;  (ii)  for  auditing  of  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  corporate  and\nproject  accounts,  6  person-months  of  international  and  15\nperson-months  of  domestic  consultants;  and \nfor\ndeveloping  implementing  regulations  for  the  Energy  Law,  17\nperson-months  of  international  and  7  person-months  of\ndomestic consultants.\n\n(iii) \n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\n31 December 2005\n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries\n\nimprove  power  supply  availability  and\nThe  Project  will \nreliability  to  about  172,000  households  and  facilities  in\nTajikistan.  Part  A  of  the  Project  will  provide  adequate  and\n\n\fiv\n\nlive  below \n\nthe  national  poverty \n\nreliable  electricity  to  about  24,000  mostly  poor  returnee\nhouseholds  in  war-damaged  areas,  where  96  percent  of  the\nline.  Returnee\npeople \nhousehold  heads  typically  work  in  collective  farms  receiving\nseasonal  incomes  of  about  $1-5  per  month  and  supplement\ntheir  income  through  home  plots,  livestock,  and  small-scale\nretail  trade.  Adequate  electricity  supply,  especially  in  winter,\nwill  improve  heating,  supply  of  safe  drinking  water,  and\nthe\neducation  and  health  services,  and  will  allow \nestablishment  of  small  industries.  This  will  have  positive\neffects  on  health,  productivity,  and \nincome-earning\nopportunities.  The  impact  will  be  particularly  positive  for\nvulnerable  groups  such  as  women  and  children  who  are\nprimarily  responsible  for  collecting  alternative  fuels  such  as\nfuelwood and biomass. Part B will remove the risk of a major\npower  supply  breakdown  in  Tajikistan,  by  funding  urgently\nneeded rehabilitation work in the country's largest hydropower\nplant, thus benefiting the whole economy. The restructuring of\nthe  energy  sector,  enhancement  of  cost  recovery  through\nelectricity  prices,  and  restructuring  and  commercialization  of\nBarki Tajik will improve sector governance, reduce losses, and\nstrengthen Barki Tajik's financial position. Part C will reinforce\nelectricity distribution in Dushanbe region where 72 percent of\nthe  households  live  below  the  national  poverty  line.  This  will\nsupport  economic  recovery  in  this  region.  The  financial\ninternal  rate  of  return  of  the  Project  is  7.7  percent,  and  the\neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  is  28.0  percent.  About  57\npercent of the project's net economic benefits (not considering\nsome indirect benefits) will go to the poor.\n\nA  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  of  $500,000  equivalent,\nfinanced  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the\nGovernment of Japan, will be used to design and implement a\nbilling  and  collection  system  to  help  Barki  Tajik  reduce  its\n  $500,000\nreceivable.  Another  TA  grant  of \naccounts \nequivalent, financed from the Japan Special Fund, funded by\nthe  Government  of  Japan,  will  help  Barki  Tajik  introduce\ninternational  accounting  standards  and  prepare  its  corporate\naccounts  for  fiscal  year  2001.  The  TA  consultants  will  be\nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on\nthe engagement of domestic consultants.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n\fv\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Power  Rehabilitation  Project.  The  Report  also\ndescribes  two  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  for  (i)  Improving  Barki  Tajik's  Billing  and\nCollection System, and (ii) Introducing International Accounting Standards (IAS) at Barki Tajik,\nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by\nthe Board, will approve the TAs.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nTajikistan  ranks  among  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world  and  is  the  poorest  of  the\nformer Soviet Union (FSU) economies, with a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997\nof $178. In terms of the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s human development index,1\nin  1999  Tajikistan  ranked  108  of  174  countries  surveyed.  Of  the  population,  83  percent  live\nbelow  the  poverty  line  and  33  percent  live  in  absolute  poverty.  Six  years  of  civil  conflict  and\nnatural disasters have severely damaged the infrastructure in the energy sector, particularly in\nrural areas. In addition, the conflict has resulted in resources being diverted from much needed\nrehabilitation.  In  the  face  of  the  energy  crisis,2  the  Government  has  taken  initial  measures  to\nreform  the  energy  sector.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  these\nreforms through a program loan accompanied by TA.3\n\n3.\nIn  1998,  the  Government  requested  ADB\u2019s  financial  assistance  to  rehabilitate  and\nstrengthen  critical  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  systems  of  Barki  Tajik,  the  state-\nowned  power  company.  In  response,  ADB  provided  TA4  in  1999  to  examine  the  feasibility  of\ninvestment  programs  as  the  basis  of  a  project  that  could  be  supported  by  ADB.  Following\ncompletion  of  the  project  preparation  studies  including  a  priority  plan  for  rehabilitating  the\ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  systems,  the  Appraisal  Mission5  visited  Tajikistan  in\nAugust 2000 to discuss the Project with the Government and Barki Tajik. The primary objective\nof the Project is poverty reduction through (i) improving reliability of power supply throughout the\nyear; (ii) improving the quality of life of poor rural communities by making electricity available for\nheating, lighting, and cooking; (iii) improving health and education facilities by making electricity\navailable for heating, lighting, and refrigeration; (iv) facilitating the creation of income generating\nopportunities for small private enterprises and agriculture by improving irrigation; (v) saving time\nfor  poor  rural  households  who  must  search  for  alternative  fuels;6  and  (vi)  introducing  sector\nreforms to ensure increased access to affordable electricity for the poor. About 79 percent of the\nbeneficiaries are expected to be the poor living below the poverty line. The Project framework is\nin Appendix 1.\n\n                  \n\n1  A  measure  of  meeting  basic  human  needs  that  comprises:  (i)  life  expectancy  at  birth,  (ii)  adult  literacy  rate,  (iii)\n\nschool enrolment rate, and (iv) real GDP per capita.\n\n2  Most parts of the country do not have adequate electricity throughout the year, especially in winter.\n3 Loan 1651-TAJ: Postconflict Infrastructure Program, for $20 million, and TA 3114-TAJ: Institutional Strengthening\n\nof the Transport and Energy Sectors, for $1.5 million, both approved on 10 December 1998.\n4  TA 3207-TAJ: Power Sector Development Project, for  $840,000, approved on 17 June 1999.\n5    The  Mission  comprised  S.  Vivekananda  (Mission  Leader-Senior  Energy  Specialist),  J.  Ordo\u00f1a  (Senior  Financial\nAnalyst),  P.  Abeygunawardena  (Senior  Economist  for  Environment),  L.  Campbell  (Senior  Counsel),  B.  Coleman\n(Program Economist), and S. Tamondong (Poverty Reduction Coordinator).\n\n6  Fuelwood (collection takes up to 15 days to provide a month\u2019s supply) and biomass (cow dung briquettes are made\none  hour  each  day  in  summer  to  provide  for  the  winter  supply).  The  use  of  biomass  for  fuel  also  reduces  its\navailability as fertilizer and results in the decline of soil fertility.\n\n\f2\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n4.\nThe dissolution of the FSU and the subsequent civil war in Tajikistan have had severe\nsocial  and  economic  consequences  for  the  country  in  general,  and  for  the  project  area  of\nKhatlon Region in the south in particular. The war, the general economic crisis, and the loss of\nsocial  services  have  caused  a  drastic  deterioration  in  the  living  conditions  of  most  of  the\npopulation.  GDP  contracted  by  about  60  percent  in  the  six  years  following  independence  in\n1991.  Unemployment,  virtually  nonexistent  before  independence,  increased  to  an  estimated\n30 percent in 1999.7 Thirty-three percent of the population live in absolute poverty, based on a\nmonthly  per  capita  income  of  TJR10,000  ($5.9).  The  average  per  capita  monthly  income  of\nTJR12,3908 ($7.3) buys less than half of the minimum consumption basket. As a consequence,\nthe  human  development  index  for  Tajikistan,  estimated  by  the  United  Nations  Development\nProgramme  (UNDP),  fell  from  0.63  in  1991  to  0.54  in  1998.9  The  Government  places  a  high\npriority  on  poverty  reduction  as  demonstrated  by  its  policy  on  social  expenditures  and  by\ndrafting a national poverty reduction strategy (para. 23).\n\nKhatlon Region is the poorest area of the country. Its poverty rate of 96 percent exceeds\n5.\nthe  national  average10  (Table  1).  Khatlon  was  the  site  of  the  worst  fighting  and  devastation  of\nthe civil war. Beyond the terrible loss of life and human suffering caused by the war,11 much of\nthe infrastructure, private homes, and other property were destroyed or severely damaged.\n\nTable 1: Key Human Development Indicators\n\nIndicator\nPoverty Incidence (%)\nPopulation Growth Rate (%)\nMaternal Mortality Rate per 100,000 live births\nPopulation per Doctor\nEducation Enrollment Rate, age 7-23 (%)\nLife Expectancy at Birth (years)\n\nKhatlon Region\n96\n3.5\n115\n932\n61\n68.8\n\nTajikistan\n83\n2.0\n88\n491\n68\n68.4\n\n                  Source:  Tajikistan - Human Development Report (1999)\n\n6.\nThe  civil  war  and  the  economic  crisis  caused  tax  revenues  to  decline.  As  a  result,  the\nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  maintain  basic  infrastructure,  including  that  of  the  energy  sector,  was\nseverely  strained.  Due  to  the  poor  condition  of  the  existing  infrastructure,  power  outages  are\ncommon. This affects agricultural, commercial, and industrial consumers, which leads to lower\nproduction, higher production costs, and loss of income.\n\nIn  winter,  when  energy  supply  is  crucial,  most  rural  villages  have  insufficient  and\n7.\nunreliable electricity supply. Major towns fare somewhat better, but daily outages of 3-6 hours\nare common especially in winter. The poor quality of electricity supply in turn reduces the quality\nof  life  of  residential  consumers.  The  restricted  supply  limits  basic  necessities  like  cooking  and\nheating  in  winter  and  constrains  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  provide  health,  social,  and\neducational  services  in  rural  areas.  Hence,  improving  electricity  supply  services  will  have\npositive  effects  on  the  health  and  nutrition  of  the  poor  in  the  project  areas,  which  will  in  turn\n\n                  \n\n7  The  official  unemployment  rate  was  3.2  percent  in  1998  and  3.1  percent  in  1999.  However,  these  statistics\nunderestimate  actual  unemployment  because  (i)  they  do  not  account  for  substantial  unemployment  and\nunderemployment  in  inactive  state-owned  enterprises  and  in  rural  areas,  (ii)  many  of  the  unemployed  have  not\nregistered, and (iii) there is a continuing repatriation of refugees as well as demobilization of opposition fighters.\n\n8  United Nations Development Programme's and World Bank's Tajjikistan Living Standards Survey, May 1999.\n9  The human development index for Kazakhstan is 0.67, Kyrgyz Republic 0.70, and Uzbekistan 0.69.\n10 World Bank\u2019s Tajikistan Poverty Assessment, June 2000.\n11 The war claimed over 60,000 lives and created 700,000 refugees. About 26,000 families lost their male heads of\n\nhousehold, and 55,000 children were orphaned.\n\n\f3\n\nimprove  their  economic  productivity.  Economic  productivity  will  also  be  improved  because\nelectricity is a necessary input to many small enterprises.\n\n8.\nAlthough  the  poverty  rate  in  the  region  around  the  capital,  Dushanbe,  is  below  the\nnational average, it is a high 72 percent.12 The Dushanbe region could be Tajikistan\u2019s primary\ngrowth vehicle and absorb a large portion of the unemployed workforce. Reliable and efficient\npower  supply  is  essential  for  the  Government  efforts  to  achieve  macroeconomic  stabilization\nand  economic  recovery.  Given  the  urgent  need  to  overcome  power  supply  constraints  and\nincrease the efficiency of supply and use of electricity, priority is being given in the medium term\nto  retrofitting  and  rehabilitating  existing  power  facilities,  especially  those  that  can  provide\nelectricity  throughout  the  year  (e.g.,  the  Nurek  Hydropower  Plant  [NHPP]  and  the  Central\nHydropower Plant [CHPP]). The current situation provides a good opportunity to reduce poverty\nby rehabilitating the power supply facilities and restructuring the sector.\n\nA. \n\nThe Energy Sector\n\n1. \n\nOverview\n\n9.\nIn Tajikistan, hydropower supplies 90 percent of energy produced and, hence, plays an\nimportant role in the economy. The potential for hydropower is estimated at 527 terawatt hours\n(TWh), of which only about 19 TWh (4 percent) is utilized. The extensive mountain ranges, such\nas  the  Pamir  and  Fan  mountains,  which  are  among  the  highest  in  the  world,  have  a  layer  of\nglaciers that melts in the summer, resulting in extensive flow of water. During 1995 to 1998 this\nproduced on average an electric power surplus of about 4.2 TWh in summer, which used to be\nexported mostly to Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. In winter, there was on average\na  net  deficit  of  about  1.0  TWh  for  the  same  period,  which  was  met  by  imports  from  Kyrgyz\nRepublic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n\nBecause  of  the  seasonal  nature  of  hydropower  resources,  the  country  depends  on\n10.\nimported  oil,  gas,  and  coal  to  meet  its  energy  requirements.  In  1999,  energy  imports  totaled\n$103 million while exports (primarily electricity) amounted to $17.5 million. Net energy imports\nare expected to increase as the domestic demand for imported fuels rises with the acceleration\nof  economic  recovery.  Prospects  for  increasing  electricity  exports  are  limited  in  the  short  to\nmedium  term  because  of  the  decline  in  electricity  demand  in  the  neighboring  countries.\nMeasures  to  promote  efficient  use  of  electricity  and  to  increase  domestic  oil,  gas,  and  coal\nproduction are vital to improving the country\u2019s overall balance of payments.\n\n11.\nThe  country\u2019s  future  energy  production  and  trade  will  depend  on  a  number  of  factors,\nincluding  (i)  the  rate  of  economic  recovery  of  Tajikistan  and  the  neighboring  countries;  (ii)  the\ntrading arrangements negotiated with the neighboring countries; and (iii) the country\u2019s ability to\nattract  private  sector  financing  to  develop  domestic  coal,  oil,  natural  gas,  and  hydroelectric\npower  resources.  Regional  energy  trade  will  continue  to  be  important  for  Tajikistan,  and\nnegotiated long-term  contracts for power exports on equitable terms are a high priority for the\nGovernment.\n\n2. \n\nEnergy Supply and Demand\n\n12.\nAt  the  beginning  of  the  1990s,  about  two-thirds  of  Tajikistan's  primary  energy  supplies\ncame  from  imports,  mainly  petroleum  products  and  natural  gas  from  Uzbekistan.  In  1991,  net\nimports amounted to 1.58 million tons of petroleum products, 1.76 billion cubic meters of natural\n\n12 Based on information provided by the State Statistical Office at appraisal.\n\n                  \n\n\f4\n\ngas, 1.2 TWh of electricity, and 375,000 tons of coal. By 1999, because of reduced economic\nactivity  due  to  the  civil  war  and  import  price  increases  to  international  levels,  net  imports  of\nprimary energy had fallen sharply to around one third of total supplies. In 1999, Tajikistan had\nnet imports of 300,000 tons of petroleum products and 0.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas,\nand net exports of 0.18 TWh of electricity.13\n\n13.\nBetween 1991 and 1999, domestic energy consumption fell from about 7.8 million tons\nof oil equivalent (toe) to about 3.0 million toe. The economic slowdown also caused a change in\nthe consumption pattern. In 1991, residential consumers accounted for 29 percent, industry for\n40  percent,  water  supply  and  agriculture  for  19  percent,  and  others  for  12  percent.  In  1999,\nresidential energy consumption increased to 36 percent, while industrial consumption remained\nat 40 percent, water supply and agriculture dropped slightly to 17 percent, and others dropped\nto 7 percent. In 1999, the per capita domestic energy consumption was about 0.5 toe. This was\nabout  20  percent  higher  than  the  average  for  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries,  partly\nbecause  of  the  relatively  low  end-use  efficiency  and  high  heating  requirements  during  winter.\nWith  the  rise  in  prices  of  imported  fuel  toward  international  levels  during  the  past  few  years,\nhouseholds  switched  to  electricity,  generated  mainly  by  hydropower  plants,  for  heating  and\ncooking. This partly accounts for the decrease of coal consumption from 690,000 tons in 1991\nto 16,000 tons in 1999; and that of petroleum products from 1.68 million tons to 323,000 tons.\n\nAfter a substantial decrease in electricity consumption due mainly to the effect of the civil\n14.\nwar and the related drop in industrial production, electricity consumption in Tajikistan has begun\nto  rise  again,  by  24  percent  in  1998  and  6.5  percent  in  1999.  Despite  this,  the  1999  sales  of\n13.3  TWh  of  electricity  sales  were  still  significantly  below  the  levels  in  the  early  1990s\n(18.0 TWh). Future demand growth will depend on industrial and agricultural production. GDP is\nestimated to have grown by 3.7 percent in 1999, and is expected to grow further at 5.0 percent\nper year in 2000 and 2001, and 6.0 percent in 2002.14 The expansion of the economy will put\nupward pressure on power demand.\n\n3. \n\nPower System\n\n15.\nTajikistan\u2019s  power  system  comprises  three  separate  power  grids,  the  north,  south,  and\nGorno-Badakhshan  systems,  which  are  operated  by  Barki  Tajik  (Map).  The  installed  capacity\ntotals  4,354  megawatts  (MW),  including  4,000  MW  of  hydropower  capacity.15  The  annual\naverage  power  generation  of  the  hydropower  plants  is  about  15.0  TWh.  Although  part  of  the\nnorthwestern  Gorno-Badakhshan  system  is  connected  to  the  south  system  around  Dushanbe\nthrough  110  kilovolt  (kV)  and  35  kV  transmission  lines,  it  is  considered  separate  from  an\noperational  point  of  view.  The  northern  region  is  the  most  industrially  developed  part  of\nTajikistan but has only one hydropower plant, Kairrakumskaya (126 MW). This plant on the Syr\nDarya (river) operates for irrigation in summer to meet the agriculture demands of Kazakhstan,\nTajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan,  and  generates  limited  power  during  winter.  Therefore,  Tajikistan\npurchases  power  from  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan  to  meet  the  power\ndeficit. The north system is not connected directly to the main grid in the south but through the\nUzbekistan  power  network,  which  results  in  expensive  wheeling  charges  and  significant\ntechnical  losses.  North  Tajikistan  therefore  suffers  from  acute  power  deficits  and  depends  on\npower supply from Uzbekistan. To reduce Tajikistan's reliance on such arrangements, a north-\nsouth  connection  would  be  ideal,  but  the  high  mountain  ranges  make  its  construction  difficult\nand expensive.\n\n                  \n\n13  Net  exports  of  electricity  have  dropped  in  recent  years  with  the  decline  in  electricity  demand  in  neighboring\n\ncountries.\n\n14 CER:TAJ 2000-03. ADB\u2019s Tajikistan: Country Economic Report, April 2000.\n15 North system - 130 MW; south system - 4,194 MW; and Gorno-Badakhshan system - 30 MW.\n\n\f5\n\n16.\nAll major hydropower plants in the south are on the Vaksh River. NHPP with 3,000 MW\nof installed capacity is the largest in Central Asia and generates electricity throughout the year.\nIt was constructed in stages from 1962 to 1979, and regulates the Vaksh River flow for irrigation\nneeds  in  the  Amu  Darya  basin  countries  (Turkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan)  during  the  growing\nseason  (May  to  July).  Baipinskaya  hydropower  plant  supplies  600  MW  and  has  been  in\noperation since 1985. The Vaksh cascade, with 3 hydropower plants (including CHPP), provides\n285 MW and has been in operation since the early 1960s. The Varzob cascade with three small\nhydropower plants provides 25 MW in total and was built during 1932-1952.\n\nTajikistan has only two combined heat and power plants, with a total installed capacity of\n17.\n346 MW. Both are in the south system. One, at Yavan, was closed in 1997 while the second, at\nDushanbe, operates only in winter, mainly to supply district heating to the city.\n\nThe Gorno-Badakhshan power system is much less developed than the north and south\n18.\nsystems. It covers the  eastern mountainous part of Tajikistan (comprising about 46 percent of\nthe country\u2019s territory), serves 216,000 people, and consists of several isolated network systems\nand small and mini-hydropower plants with total installed capacity of about 30 MW. The largest\nhydropower plants are Pamir 1 (14 MW) and Khorog (7 MW).\n\n19.\nPrior to the break-up of the FSU, Tajikistan\u2019s power system was operated as part of the\nelectricity pool of Central Asia,16 and was instrumental in providing peak capacity and reserve to\nregulate  voltage  and  frequency  in  the  region.  Tajikistan  supplied  the  region  with  low  cost\nhydroelectric  power  and  received  imports  of  oil  and  gas  through  net  resource  transfers.  The\nchanges in trading relations and energy supply requirements among the neighboring countries\nafter  their  independence  have  complicated  their  energy  sector  operations.  Hence,  Tajikistan,\nwhich used to generate about 4.2 TWh of excess electric power during the summer, is usually\nnot able to export all its surplus power to offset imports during the winter period. Therefore, ADB\nis encouraging through TA,17 regional cooperation for power transfers between electricity grids\nof  the  Central  Asian  republics  to  optimize  use  of  their  power  generation  sources  and  improve\nthe stability and reliability of their power systems.\n\n20.\nTajikistan has 4,268 kilometers (km) of power transmission lines, comprising 226 km of\nhigh  voltage  500  kV  lines,  1,203  km  of  220  kV  lines,  and  2,839  km  of  110  kV  lines.  The\ndistribution system consists of 35 kV, 10 kV and 6 kV lines, and of low voltage (0.4 kV) lines.\nThe power system has continued to provide electricity during the transition years to support vital\neconomic  sectors  such  as  manufacturing  and  agriculture.  Power  outages  are  scheduled  on  a\nrotational basis for urban and rural households, particularly during winter, due to nonavailability\nof generating plant and lack of water resources for power generation. With a lack of spare parts\nand funds for maintenance, power cuts are becoming more frequent.\n\n4. \n\nEnergy Pricing\n\n21.\nThe  historical  and  current  fuel  and  electricity  prices  in  Tajikistan  are  summarized  in\ntables 2 and 3. Prices of petroleum products, natural gas, and coal for industry are now largely\nat  international  market  levels,  with  import  prices  being  passed  on  to  consumers.  This  price\nliberalization is in line with the Government\u2019s general policy of eliminating distortions caused by\nthe former command economy and reducing the state\u2019s role. However, electricity prices remain\nunder  Government  control  and  have  been  kept  artificially  low  and  structured  in  favor  of\n\n                  \n\n16  The  main  110  kV,  220  kV  and  500  kV  transmission  lines  were  linked  for  synchronous  operation  of  the  power\n\nsystems of Kyrgyz Republic, South Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n\n17 TA 5818-REG: Regional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia, for $1,350,000, approved on 11 December 1998.\n\n\f6\n\nresidential  consumers  because  of  the  Government\u2019s  concern  about  inflation  and  consumers\u2019\nability  to  pay.  The  current  economic  situation  has  made  the  adjustment  of  electricity  prices\ndifficult for the customers to bear, thus contributing to the accumulation of accounts receivable\nand underrecovery of costs. This has led to distorted consumption patterns, inequitable pricing\namong  some  consumer  categories,  and  deteriorating  financial  condition  of  the  energy  supply\nutilities. Under the second enhanced structural adjustment facility18 of the International Monetary\nFund  (IMF)  and  ADB\u2019s  Postconflict  Infrastructure  Program  Loan  (PCIPL),  the  Government\nagreed to raise energy tariffs to improve cost recovery. ADB has had extensive policy dialogue\nwith  the  Government  to  reduce  energy  utilities'  accounts  receivable  and  improve  revenues  to\nrecover the cost of operation and maintenance (paras. 38-44).\n\nGasoline (per liter)\nDiesel (per liter)\nKerosene (per liter)\nLPG (per cubic meter)\nNatural Gas\n\nTable 2: Fuel Prices in Tajikistan\n\n      1997\n       $   TJR\n\n   1998\n\n     1999\n\n      2000 (August)\n\n    $\n\n  TJR\n\n    $\n\n  TJR\n\n    $\n\n       TJR\n\n0.34\n0.22\n0.19\n0.65\n\n183\n120\n100\n350\n\n0.24\n0.15\n0.13\n0.45\n\n183\n120\n100\n350\n\n0.35\n0.19\n0.21\n0.58\n\n427\n226\n250\n700\n\n800\n650\n540\n1,340\n\n1,600\n104,000\n102,000\n\n0.40\n0.33\n0.27\n0.67\n\n0.80\n52.10\n51.10\n2,000\n\nDomestic (per person)\n450\n64.94 35,000\nIndustry (per 1,000 cubic meters)\nImport Price (per 1,000 cubic meters) 56.21 30,000\n\n0.83\n\n0.58\n\n450\n51.48 40,000\n56.21 44,000\n\nExchange Rate (TJR/$)\nSource:  Staff estimates.\n\n539\n\n777\n\n0.75\n\n900\n66.28 80,000\n51.10 62,000\n1,207\n\nTable 3: Electricity Prices in Tajikistan\n\n1997\nUS\u00a2/kWh TJR/kWh\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000 (August)\n\nUS\u00a2/kWh TJR/kWh US\u00a2/kWh TJR/kWh US\u00a2/kWh   TJR/kWh\n\nResidential\n\n< 150 kWh\n> 150 kWh\n\n0.04\n          -\n          -\n\n0.20\n     -\n     -\n\n0.06\n     -\n     -\n\n0.50\n     -\n     -\n\nIndustry\n        TADAZ\n        Others\nCommercial\nAgriculture\nWater Supply/Govt.\nExchange Rate (TJR/$)\n- = not applicable; Govt. = Government; TADAZ = Tajik Aluminum Smelter.\nSource:  Staff estimates.\n\n7.28\n7.28\n   10.78\n8.09\n0.50\n\n4.90\n7.30\n  10.49\n  10.49\n0.50\n\n0.63\n0.94\n1.35\n1.35\n0.06\n 777\n\n1.35\n1.35\n2.00\n1.50\n0.09\n5.39\n\n     -\n0.21\n0.70\n\n0.63\n0.94\n1.35\n1.35\n0.21\n   1,207\n\n     -\n2.50\n8.50\n\n7.60\n  11.34\n  16.29\n  16.29\n2.50\n\n      -\n0.25\n0.55\n\n0.63\n0.94\n1.35\n1.35\n0.13\n    2,000\n\n        -\n  5.00\n11.00\n\n12.60\n18.80\n27.00\n27.00\n  2.50\n\n5. \n\nInstitutional and Regulatory Framework\n\nThe key oversight agencies in the energy sector are Barki Tajik for electricity and district\n22.\nheating  supply;  Tajik  Committee  for  Oil  and  Gas  (Tajikneft)  for  oil  and  gas  exploration  and\nproduction;  Naftrason19 \nimportation  and  distribution;  and\nTajikkommunservice  for  natural  gas  importation  and  distribution  and  district  heating  (except  in\nKhujand and Dushanbe, which are under Barki Tajik). The State Committee on Industrial Affairs\n\nfor  petroleum  products \n\n                  \n\n18 Now called Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.\n19 Formerly known as Tajikneftprodukt.\n\n\f7\n\nis  in  charge  of  coal  mining,  and  the  Geology  Department  (Tajikglavgeolia)  is  responsible  for\nmineral  resources  exploration  at  a  national  level.    The  Fuel  and  Energy  Department  of  the\nPresident\u2019s  Office  is  responsible  for  the  overall  supervision  of  the  energy  sector,  and  has\nauthority  over  the  above  agencies.  Each  agency  reports  directly  to  the  Fuel  and  Energy\nDepartment.  Since  the  energy  sector  is  important,  and  the  department  is  significantly\nunderstaffed,  its  capacity  to  effectively  coordinate  policies  of  the  energy  sector  is  limited.\nTherefore, the Government will establish a Ministry of Energy (MOE), by 25 December 2000 to\neffectively oversee and coordinate policy matters for the sector (Supplementary Appendix A).\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Plans and Policies\n\n23.\nThe  Government  places  a  high  priority  on  poverty  reduction  as  demonstrated  by  (i)  its\npolicy of maintaining social expenditures at 22 percent of the Government budget, (ii) launching\nthe drafting of a poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) with the World Bank and IMF in March\n2000, and (iii) holding a seminar in May 2000 to discuss the results of the World Bank\u2019s poverty\nassessment  study.  By  Presidential  Decree  of  24  March  2000,  a  special  working  group  was\ncreated  to  begin  work  on  the  PRSP,  which  eventually  will  be  the  national  poverty  reduction\nstrategy.  This  working  group  includes  leading  Tajik  academics  and  deputy  ministers,  and  is\nscheduled to complete its assignment in the first half of 2001. The Government has requested\nADB  to  collaborate  in  this  effort  by  carrying  out  additional  focused  poverty  studies,  providing\ninputs  into  the  final  PRSP,  and  assisting  the  Government  to  develop  a  poverty  monitoring\nmechanism.\n\n24.\nThe  Government  recognizes  the  need  to  expand  and  diversify  Tajikistan\u2019s  energy\nsystem  to  supply  reliable,  efficient,  and  affordable  energy  to  more  people,  support  poverty\nreduction,  improve  the  standard  of  living,  and  bring  economic  development  to  rural  areas.  To\nthat  end,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  strategy  addressing  policy  and  institutional  reforms,\nand  rehabilitating  and  adequately  maintaining  the  existing  power  systems.  The  sector  policies\nare  designed  to  (i)  facilitate  the  development  of  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  efficient\noperations  (by  2002),  (ii)  increase  the  level  of  electricity  tariffs  toward  full  cost  recovery  (by\n2004),  (iii)  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  the  generation  and  supply  of  power  (by\nenacting the Energy Law in October 2000), and (iv) promote energy conservation (by 2001).\n\n25.\nA sound policy and regulatory framework is a prerequisite for more efficient public sector\noperations  and  greater  private  sector  participation  in  energy  production  and  delivery  services.\nThe Government recognizes the need to limit its involvement to policy and regulatory activities.\nResponsibility for energy policy, planning, and oversight of energy enterprises is to be assumed\nby the proposed MOE, which is to be staffed with an adequate number of qualified personnel.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n26.\nExternal  assistance  to  the  energy  sector  has  been  limited.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Post\nConflict Emergency Reconstruction Project, which was approved in 1998, allocated $1.9 million\nfor rehabilitation of damaged energy infrastructure, and the European Union provided in 1998 a\nTA  to  help  develop  the  energy  sector  strategy  and  undertake  feasibility  studies  on  bankable\nenergy projects. In addition, the Aga Khan Foundation extended in 1996 financial assistance of\n$12 million for completion of the Pamir I and II hydropower plants. In March 2000, the Aga Khan\nFoundation, International Finance Corporation, and Government reached a general agreement\nto establish a privately owned company that will operate the 14 MW Pamir II hydropower plant\nand the electrical system in Gorno-Badakhsan Region. The company will be granted a 15-year\nconcession and will have a high degree of autonomy. The Swiss Agency for Development and\nCooperation  has  supported  the  Aga  Khan  Foundation  with  funding  for  9  micro-hydroelectric\n\n\f8\n\nprojects  in  Gorno-Badakhshan  Region.  The  United  Nations  Office  for  Project  Services  has\ninvolving  rehabilitation  of  war-damaged  property  and\nimplemented  13  micro  projects \ninfrastructure  in  Khatlon  Region  for  a  budget  of  $0.2  million.  In  late  1999,  the  Kuwait  Fund\napproved  a  TA  grant  of  $0.4  million  to  examine  the  rehabilitation  of  the  power  distribution\nsystem in Dushanbe, and will follow up with a distribution rehabilitation project for Dushanbe in\n2002 for $15 million.\n\n27.\nADB  has  been  coordinating  its  operations  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  energy  sector  with  other\nagencies,  particularly  the  World  Bank  and  IMF.  ADB's  PCIPL  and  IMF's  Poverty  Reduction\nGrowth  Facility  have  common  conditionalities  to  the  Government  and  Barki  Tajik,  and  the\nproposed Project incorporates similar or updated conditions.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n28.\nADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  energy  sector  in  Tajikistan  is  limited.  With  regard  to  policy\naspects,  under  the  PCIPL  it  was  noted  that  restructuring  of  the  energy  sector  in  transition\neconomies requires considerable time and effort and that some policy reforms under the PCIPL\nhad unrealistic targets and time frames. The proposed Project will be the first loan project in the\npower sector,  but it draws on ADB's  experience in providing  rehabilitation  assistance  to other\ncountries in transition such as the Kyrgyz Republic20 and Mongolia.21 The major lessons learned\nabout  project  planning  and  implementation  in  such  countries  include  (i)  the  need  for  human\nresource development, capacity building, and training; (ii) the shortage of counterpart financing;\nand (iii) the lack of familiarity with the policies and practices of multilateral financing agencies. In\nparticular, ADB experience has shown that it takes considerable time and effort to restructure,\ncorporatize and commercialize, and achieve full cost recovery in an economy that is undergoing\ntransformation.  ADB  projects  have  had  front-end  delays  in  implementation  due  to  the\ngovernments' unfamiliarity with ADB procedures. Human resource development, assistance with\nestablishing the legal framework for restructuring, setting realistic targets for cost recovery and\nfinancial  performance,  and  familiarization  with  procurement  and  disbursement  policies  of  ADB\nand cofinanciers will therefore be an integral part of the Project. To overcome local counterpart\nfunding constraints, policy dialogue is focused on improving Barki Tajik\u2019s financial situation.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sectoral Strategy\n\n29.\nADB\u2019s interim operational strategy (IOS) for Tajikistan was approved by ADB's Board of\nDirectors  in  October  1998.22  Facilitating  the  transition  to  a  market  economy  is  the  principal\nobjective of the strategy. In the near term, this objective will entail (i) supporting macroeconomic\nand  sectoral  policy  reforms,  (ii)  facilitating  the  country\u2019s  transition  to  a  market  economy,\n(iii)  assisting \nin  Tajikistan\u2019s  postconflict  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  efforts,  and\n(iv) supporting natural disaster rehabilitation. ADB\u2019s assistance will be provided to support policy\nreforms, institution building, and investment operations.\n\n30.\nBecause  of  ADB\u2019s  comparative  advantage  at  the  sector  level,  the  objectives  of\nthe IOS will be achieved through sector operations. Given ADB\u2019s resource constraints, the IOS\nand  ADB\u2019s  country  assistance  program  focus  on  a  few  priority  sectors  to  maximize  the\ndevelopment  impact.  In  view  of  the  Government\u2019s  development  priorities  and  the  activities  of\n\n                  \n\n20 Loan 1443 -KYZ: Power and District Heating Rehabilitating Project, for $30 million, approved on 6 June 1996.\n21 Loan 1152-MON (SF): Egiin Hydropower Project, for $3.8 million, approved on 9 January 1992; Loan 1334-MON:\nPower  Rehabilitation  Project,  for  $40  million,  approved  on  19  November  1994;  Loan  1492-  MON:  Energy\nConservation Project,  for  $10  million,  approved  on  26  November  1996;  and  Loan  1548-MON:Ulaanbaatar Heat\nEfficiency Project, for $40 million, approved on 25 September 1997.\n\n22 IN.253-98: ADB\u2019s Economic Report and Interim Operational Strategy for Tajikistan, November 1998.\n\n\f9\n\nother  aid  agencies,  ADB  assistance  in  the  near  term  will  concentrate  on  three  priority  areas:\n(i) infrastructure rehabilitation, especially power and roads; (ii) agriculture and agro-processing;\nand (iii) education, health, and social protection. Involvement in these sectors builds on ADB\u2019s\ncomparative  advantage  as  ADB  has  gained  significant  experience  from  its  operations  in  other\nCentral Asian republics and Mongolia.\n\n31.\nIn the energy sector, the power subsector will be the focus of ADB assistance. ADB will\nassist  the  Government  to  implement  sector  reforms  and  rehabilitate  the  deteriorating\ninfrastructure.  ADB  operations  aim  at  (i)  establishing  an  efficient  policy  and  regulatory\nframework;  (ii)  fostering  commercialization  and  privatization  of  state-owned  enterprises;\n(iii)  encouraging  private  sector  involvement  in  energy  production  and  delivery  services;\n(iv)  increasing  revenues  of  energy  providers  by  phasing  out  electricity  subsidies,  improving\ncollection  of  electricity  payments,  and \nfor  all  energy  consumers;\n(v)  rehabilitating  existing  infrastructure  and  improving  maintenance  operations;  (vi)  developing\nthe  necessary  human  skills;  and  (vii)  strengthening  government  institutions  to  achieve  good\ngovernance.  Considering  the  economy\u2019s  state  of  transition  and  the  uncertain  demand  in  the\nnear term for electricity from importing countries, long-range investment planning is still difficult.\nThe  immediate  priority  is  rehabilitation  of  facilities,  which  are  in  serious  condition.  In  many\nhouseholds, electricity consumption is not metered, and users are charged on the basis of the\nnumber  of  rooms.  This  does  not  provide  sufficient  incentive  to  conserve  electricity,  leading  to\ninefficient  electricity  consumption.  There  is  also  a  need  to  assist  Barki  Tajik  to  attain  financial\nsustainability by improving billing and collection to reduce accounts receivable and by adjusting\nelectricity tariffs to achieve full cost recovery.\n\ninstalling  meters \n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nADB's  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  has  focused  on  strengthening  the  ongoing\n32.\npolicy  reform \ninstitutional  reform,  and  assisting\nfurther  areas  of \nimplementation  of  reforms.  These  include  market-oriented  policy  and  regulatory  reforms,\ninstitutional strengthening of Barki Tajik, and measures to reach full cost recovery and financial\nsustainability of Barki Tajik.\n\ninitiatives,  defining \n\n1.\n\nPolicy and Regulatory Framework\n\n33.\nThe  Government\u2019s  regulatory  role  in  the  energy  sector  is  essentially  limited  to  the\ndetermination  of  tariffs  and  technical  matters.  Recognizing  the  important  role  of  the  energy\nsector  in  the  economic  recovery,  the  Government  expects  the  sector  to  become  increasingly\nself-financing,  thus  reducing  demands  on  the  national  budget.  However,  this  needs  to  be\nmatched by a strengthened role of the Government in sector regulation. In its efforts to develop\na clear and well-defined policy and legal framework, the Government issued the Energy Sector\nPolicy Statement (ESPS) in 1998 emphasizing its commitment to market-based reforms through\nexplicit  policies  and  guidelines  for  defining  its  function  as  regulator.  The  ESPS  envisaged\nrestructuring the energy sector to (i) increase the role of the private sector in providing services,\n(ii)  improve  management  efficiency  and  cost  recovery  of  enterprises  that  remain  under  state\ncontrol,  and  (iii)  allow  market-based  pricing.  Under  the  policy  reform  agenda  of  PCIPL,  the\nGovernment  was  to  enact  an  energy  law  that  would  restructure  the  energy  sector,  introduce\nmarket-oriented  reforms,  reduce  its  involvement  as  an  investor  in  the  sector,  enhance  its\nregulatory  functions,  facilitate  private  sector  involvement  in  developing  domestic  energy\nresources, and unify the energy subsectors to improve management efficiency by establishing\nthe  MOE.  The  Government  was  to  have  made  substantial  progress  in  these  reforms  by\nDecember  1999  but  actual  progress  has  been  much  slower  because  of  the  difficult  economic\nsituation, political developments, national elections between November 1999 and March 2000,\n\n\f10\n\nand  the  rather  ambitious  targets  and  time  frame  envisaged  for  the  reform  agenda.  The\nGovernment  nevertheless  remains  committed  to  carry  out  the  reform  agenda.  To  enable  this,\nthe  time  period  for  various  actions  under  the  PCIPL-supported  reform  agenda  has  been\nextended by adopting the Energy Sector Action Plan (ESAP, Appendix 2) formulated with ADB\nassistance.  In  accordance  with  the  ESAP,  the  Energy  Law  was  enacted  in  October  2000  and\nthe  MOE  will  be  fully  established  by  December  2000.23  Other  actions  such  as  developing\ncharters and implementing regulations for the Energy Law are expected to follow with help from\nconsultants to be financed under the proposed loan.\n\n2. \n\nGovernance Reforms\n\n34.\nThe ESPS emphasizes the importance of facilitating privatization of energy enterprises.\nAt present, energy enterprises are either directly state owned, or are in the form of a joint-stock\ncompany.  Since  1999,  the  Government  has  been  creating  business  units  from  some  of  the\npower generation and distribution subsidiaries, with ownership rights vested directly in the State\nProperty  Committee  on  behalf  of \nthe  Government  but  with  business  management\nresponsibilities assigned to Barki Tajik. The Government has begun restructuring Barki Tajik as\npart of its plan to eventually privatize it. Under ADB TA (footnote 3), the Government prepared\ntime-bound  action  plans  to  corporatize  and  commercialize  key  agencies  in  the  energy  sector,\nnamely Barki Tajik (Appendix 2), Tajikkommunservice, and Naftrason.  A corporate charter for\nBarki  Tajik  is  to  be  adopted  by  December  2001.  Elsewhere  in  the  energy  sector,  greater\nprogress has been made, for example in privatizing state-owned gasoline stations.\n\n3. \n\nProgram Loan\n\n35.\nUnder  the  PCIPL,  a  total  of  30  policy  reform  measures  were  to  be  completed  during\nJanuary  1999  to  December  2000.  Of  these  measures,  11  were  required  to  be  fulfilled  as\nconditions for the release of the second tranche. As of loan negotiations (6-8 November 2000),\nthe  overall  compliance  of  the  policy  reform  measures  was  14  out  of  30  measures  and  for\nsecond  tranche  conditions,  8  out  of  11  conditions.  Another  three  policy  reform  measures  are\nexpected to be complied with by December 2000.\n\n36. With  regard  to  the  second  tranche  release,  two  conditions  relate  to  transport,  one  to\nforeign  investment,  three  to  gas,  and  five  to  electricity  (Appendix  3).  To  date,  eight  conditions\n(one for foreign investment, two for gas, three for electricity, and two for transport) have been\nmet:  (i)  issuing  amendments  to  the  Foreign  Investment  Law,  (ii)  enactment  of  amendments  to\nthe  Transport  Law,  (iii)  enactment  of  the  Energy  Law,  (iv)  implementation  of  a  quarterly\nautomatic tariff adjustment mechanism for electricity to take into account input cost factors that\nare beyond the control of Barki Tajik, (v) achieving 75 percent cost recovery for electricity supply\nto  industry  and  agriculture,  (vi)  taking  measures  to  ensure  that  Tajikkommunservice  is  able  to\ngenerate  sufficient  revenue  to  fully  recover  its  operational  costs,  (vii)  implementing  price\nvariations for gas supply to achieve cost recovery, and (viii) completing a comprehensive review\nof  the  present  road  financing  and  cost  recovery  mechanisms  to  ensure  sufficient  revenue  is\ngenerated to recover the cost of operation and maintenance (O&M) of roads.\n\n37.\nBased  on  the  above,  three  second  tranche  conditions  remain  unfulfilled  as  of  loan\nnegotiations: (i) achieving 50 percent cost recovery of electricity supply to residential consumers\n(at present 23 percent); (ii) implementing measures to ensure that accounts receivable of Barki\nTajik  will  be  at  a  level  of  6  months  or  less  of  equivalent  electricity  sales  (for  1999  it  was  11\nreceivable  of\nmonths);  and \n\nimplementing  measures \n\nthat  accounts \n\nto  ensure \n\n(iii) \n\n23 The PCIPL target date for these activities was December 1999.\n\n                  \n\n\f11\n\nTajikkommunservice  will  be  at  a  level  of  3  months  or  less  of  equivalent  gas  sales  (for  1999  it\nwas 23 months). These and other remaining policy measures required to be adopted under the\nPCIPL are discussed here.\n\na. \n\nCost Recovery for Residential and Industrial Supplies of Electricity\n\n38. With the benefit of hindsight, the time targets set under the PCIPL for cost recovery were\nnot  realistic.  For  example,  full  cost  recovery  was  envisaged  to  be  achieved  over  the  two-year\nprogram  period  1999  and  2000.  Even  assuming  no  further  local  currency  depreciation  for  the\nrest of 2000, this would necessitate tariff increases in Tajik ruble terms over the 1998 levels by\n5,900 percent for residential consumers and 289 percent for industry.  Such high tariff increase\nrequirements are partly an outcome of the significant devaluation of the Tajik ruble vis-\u00e0-vis the\nUS dollar (from TJR777/$1 in 1998 to TJR2,000 in August 2000) and partly due to the low tariff\nbase in 1998, and are just not feasible in the two-year period originally envisaged.\n\n39.\nThe  Government  has  nevertheless  made  major  tariff  increases.  Over  the  period\n1 January 1999 to 1 April 2000, residential tariffs were increased by 1,300 percent (in Tajik ruble\nterms), thus achieving an average cost recovery of 23 percent, still below the 50 percent cost\nrecovery stipulated for the second tranche release and the 100 percent recovery required by the\nend  of  the  program  period.  Increases  in  the  other  categories  have  also  been  significant\n(157 percent), resulting in cost recoveries of 100 percent for agriculture (above the 75 percent\nrequired for the second tranche release and meeting the 100 percent target required by the end\nof  the  program  period)  and  66  percent  for  industry.  The  Government  also  implemented  a\nquarterly  automatic  tariff  adjustment  mechanism  for  electricity  from  1  September  2000,  taking\ninto  account  input  cost  factors  that  are  beyond  the  control  of  Barki  Tajik  (Supplementary\nAppendix  B).  Despite  having  made  these  large  tariff  increases,  the  Government  undertook  a\nfurther  base  tariff  increase  of  51  percent  for  industry  on  1  November  2000  resulting  in  75\npercent cost recovery for industry, in line with the target for second tranche release.\n\n40.\nTaking into account the current state of the economy, the major tariff increases already\nmade,  the  electricity  consumers\u2019  low  ability  to  pay,  and  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  other  transition\neconomies,  the  tariff  increases  required  to  achieve  PCIPL  cost  recovery  targets  will  require\nmore  time,  particularly  for  residential  consumers.  Realistic  targets  for  achieving  full  cost\nrecovery  for  industry  and  residential  consumers  would  be  as  follows:    (i)  50  percent  and  100\npercent  cost  recovery  for  residential  consumers  in  December  2002  and  December  2004\nrespectively,  and  (ii)  100  percent  cost  recovery  for  industrial  consumers  in  December  2001.\nIMF has been consulted on these relaxed targets for cost recovery and has incorporated them\nin the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility for Tajikistan.\n\n41.\nAccordingly,  the  Government  will  adopt  a  strategy  whereby  industrial  and  residential\ntariffs will be gradually increased to achieve full cost recovery in accordance with the ESAP. In\nformulating its strategy, the Government agreed to adhere to financial covenants for Barki Tajik\non  operating  ratio24  and  rate  of  return  on  net  fixed  assets25  that  would  facilitate  full  cost\nrecovery.  The Government agreed that, to protect poor and vulnerable groups from the impact\nof  tariff  increases,  the  lifeline  tariff  structure  will  be  maintained  in  the  medium  term  until  a\nnational  poverty  reduction  strategy,  currently  under  formulation,  is  developed.26  Accordingly,\nthere  will  be  no  real  increase  in  tariff  for  the  initial  consumption  of  150  kWh  per  month  for\nresidential  consumers.    The  lifeline  tariff  targets  mostly  the  poor  whose  low  purchasing  power\n\n                  \n\n24 Operating expenses including depreciation divided by operating revenues.\n25 A 6 percent return on net fixed assets is considered appropriate in the medium term.\n26 The strategy will review the need for maintaining the lifeline tariff structure.\n\n\f12\n\nwill limit their consumption while wealthier consumers can be expected to consume more than\n150  kWh  per  month  and  pay  significantly  higher  rates  for  the  extra  consumption.  The\nGovernment also proposes to use the interest margin arising from relending the loan from ADB\nand  cofinancing  from  the  Swiss  Government  to  Barki  Tajik  to  fund  part  of  the  subsidy  for  the\nlifeline  tariff.  If  required,  the  Government  will  take  necessary  measures  to  make  up  for  any\nshortfall  in  the  subsidy.27    Under  the  ESAP,  the  Government  is  to  prepare  by  January  2002\nproposals acceptable to ADB, for an adequate safety net to protect poor and vulnerable groups\nadequately with regard to the impact of tariff increases in the long term.\n\nb. \n\nAccounts Receivable for Electricity and Gas\n\n42.\nBarki  Tajik  has  significant  accounts  receivable,  mainly  from  industrial  customers.\nAlthough  its  accounts  receivable  decreased  from  13  months  of  sales  in  1998  to  11  months  of\nsales  in  1999,  it  will  not  be  able  to  achieve  the  second-tranche  PCIPL  target  of  6  months  of\nsales  in  the  short  term.  This  is  mainly  because  the  Tajik  Aluminum  Smelter  (TADAZ),  the\nGovernment-owned  aluminum  smelting  company,  which  is  one  of  the  largest  in  the  world  and\naccounts  for  more  than  half  of  the  total  accounts  receivable,  cannot  clear  all  its  arrears  in  a\nshort period. The decline in economic conditions has reduced industrial production and delayed\npayments from the industrial sector. TADAZ accounts for 34 percent of the electricity consumed\nand, up to early 1999, the facility was not producing enough to cover its costs and accumulated\nsubstantial  arrears  in  payment.  However,  with  the  Government's  ongoing  restructuring  of\nTADAZ (with the assistance of the International Finance Corporation) and some improvement in\ninternational  prices  for  aluminum,  TADAZ  is  expected  to  gradually  increase  its  production  and\nprofitability  levels.  Under  the  recently  issued  Government  Resolution  No.  70  of  11  February\n2000,  TADAZ  was  required  to  restructure  its  outstanding  electricity  arrears  and  to  ensure  full\npayment hereafter. As a result of the policy dialogue, the Government and TADAZ agreed on a\npayment  schedule  for  June  2000  to  December  2002  for  liquidating  TADAZ\u2019s  arrears  of  $18.3\nmillion  equivalent  to  Barki  Tajik.28  In  August  2000,  TADAZ  made  two  payments  to  Barki  Tajik\ntotaling $3 million. TADAZ has also been making cash payments in full from January 2000 on\nfor  its  current  payables.  In  accordance  with  the  decree  issued  in  August  2000,  Barki  Tajik\nstopped barter trading and requires cash payments in full from all consumers in accordance with\nthe ESAP.\n\n43.\nTajikkommunservice\u2019s  accounts  receivable  of  23  months  of  gas  sales  are  mainly  with\nresidential consumers who account for 62 percent of the arrears. Natural gas is used by urban\nhouseholds  for  cooking,  as  well  as  for  district  heating,  mainly  for  households  in  urban  areas,\nduring  winter.  Tajikkommunservice  has  commenced  implementation  of  a  computer-based\nsystem  to  monitor  residential  customer  information,  produce  invoices,  and  record  collections\nwith the aim of reducing its accounts receivable. As a result of the civil war and its impact on the\ncountry\u2019s  economy,  the  Government  issued  decrees  in  1997  to  restructure  the  debts  of  major\ngas  consuming  enterprises  and  residential  consumers,  with  payment  of  their  debts  being\ndeferred up to 4 years. As a consequence, it will be difficult for Tajikkommunservice to comply in\nthe near term with the second-tranche condition of three months for accounts receivable.\n\nTaking into account the above facts, the lack of management skills and an inadequate\n44.\nbilling  and  collection  system  at  Barki  Tajik,  and  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  other  transition\neconomies, \nfor  reducing  Barki  Tajik's  and\nTajikkommunservice's  accounts  receivable  to  three  months  cannot  be  met.  The  Government\nprepared  a  time-bound  action  plan  under  the  ESAP,  extending  the  period  to  December  2002.\n\nthe  PCIPL's  deadline  of  December  2000 \n\n                  \n\n27 The shortfall is estimated at about 1 percent of the Government's current annual budget.\n28 The agreement was confirmed in a letter from TADAZ to the Government dated 21 April 2000.\n\n\f13\n\nTo  help  in  this  regard,  ADB  will  provide,  in  conjunction  with  the  proposed  Project,  TA  for  the\ndesign  and  implementation  of  a  billing  and  collection  system  for  Barki  Tajik  (para.  95).\nTajikkommunservice  has  enforced  a  strict  disconnection  policy  for  overdue  accounts  and\noffered  discounts  for  early  payment  since  October  2000.  These  measures  would  allow\nTajikkommunservice to meet the targets set under the ESAP. IMF has agreed to defer the target\nfor  accounts  receivable  of  Barki  Tajik  and  Tajikkommunservice  to  December  2002  and  has\naccordingly incorporated them in the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility for Tajikistan.\n\nc. \n\nOther Action Plans\n\n45.\nIn addition to the ESAP, the Government provided ADB with action plans for complying\nwith  the  remaining  policy  reform  measures  identified  under  the  PCIPL.29  These  relate  to\ncorporatization  and  commercialization  of  large  agencies  in  the  energy  sector,  development  of\nimplementing  regulations  for  the  Energy  Law,  and  creation  of  the  MOE.30  To  the  extent  the\nadditional policy reform measures relate to the energy sector and go beyond the PCIPL period,\nthe  Government  has  assured  ADB  that,  under  the  Project,  it  will  implement  such  measures.\nWith  regard  to  the  Project,  satisfactory  progress  has  been  achieved  under  the  PCIPL  by  loan\nnegotiations on the legal framework, sector reform, and tariffs to allow further processing of the\nProject.\n\n4. \n\nCapacity Building\n\ntechnology  and  skills,  and \n\nCapacity  building  in  Tajikistan  needs  to  start  from  the  basic  levels  of  defining  new\n46.\nstructures  and  procedures,  updating \nimproving  corporate\nmanagement. Under the PCIPL, ADB provided TA (footnote 3) for institutional strengthening of\nthe  energy  sector,  particularly  for  implementing  market-oriented  reform  initiatives.  The  TA\nconsultants  identified  the  areas  of  tariff  structure,  accounts  receivable,  billing  and  collection,\nfinancial  management,  project  management,  and  power  plant  O&M  as  key  components  for\ncapacity  building  and  training.  Under  the  proposed  Project,  Barki  Tajik  will  acquire  project\nmanagement  and  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  skills  through  on-the-job  training  with  the\nimplementation  consultants.  MOE  staff  and  government  legal  officers  will  undergo  on-the-job\ntraining with the consultants retained to assist in developing implementing regulations under the\nEnergy  Law.  Other  priority  areas  of  capacity  building  such  as  billing  and  collection\nimprovements  for  accounts  receivable,  introduction  of  IAS,  and  financial  management  will  be\naddressed through the two TAs processed parallel to the Project (paras. 95-97).\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nThe  power  sector  in  Tajikistan  has  been  severely  affected  by  the  disintegration  of  the\n47.\nFSU  in  1990.  Since  then,  construction  of  new  hydropower  plants  has  been  halted  and  the\nmaintenance  of  existing  infrastructure  neglected  due  to  lack  of  funds.    As  a  result  of  the  poor\neconomic situation of the country and damage caused by the civil war, the present condition of\npower  facilities  is  serious  (paras.  6-7).  In  addition,  with  the  increase  in  prices  of  gas  and\npetroleum imports, residential consumers have switched to electricity generated by hydropower\n\n                  \n\n29 Including outstanding policy reform measures in the transport sector.\n30  With  compliance  of  eight  second  tranche  conditions  and  achieving  satisfactory  progress  on  the  ESAP  and  other\naction  plans,  a  progress  report  is  to  be  circulated  to  the  Board  in  end  November  2000,  seeking  (i)  waiver  of  full\ncompliance with the 3 outstanding conditions and release of the second tranche of the loan, and (ii) extension of\ntime  for  compliance  with  the  3  outstanding  second  tranche  release  conditions  and  10  outstanding  policy  reform\nmeasures.\n\n\f14\n\nplants, and use it also for heating. This has placed additional demand on the existing generation\nfacilities.  Without  improvements  in  power  supply,  the  living  conditions,  particularly  of  the  poor,\nwill  be  miserable  as  they  cannot  afford  alternative  fuels.  In  addressing  poverty  reduction,  the\nproject design pays special attention to (i) facilitating the creation of employment opportunities\nand  additional  income  for  the  poor  in  the  project  areas,  and  (ii)  improving  living  standards  by\nrehabilitating basic infrastructure.\n\n48.\nA  reliable  and  efficient  power  infrastructure  is  an  important  basic  requirement  for  the\nmacroeconomic  stabilization  and  economic  recovery  efforts  of  the  Government.  As  the  power\nsystem  is  predominantly  hydro-based,  the  actual  generation  and  supply  depend  on  the\nhydrological situation as well as on the condition of power plants, which in general is well below\nfull  capacity  because  of  lack  of  funds  for  maintenance  and  spare  parts.    Based  on  GDP\nprojections (para. 14), energy sales are estimated to increase by 2 percent per year up to 2002.\nGiven the urgent need to overcome the power supply constraints and increase the efficiency of\nsupplying  and  utilizing  energy,  priority  is  being  given  in  the  medium  term  to  retrofitting  and\nrehabilitating existing power facilities, rather than adding new capacity. The Project will therefore\nrehabilitate and reinforce high-priority power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities\nin  various  parts  of  the  country.  Benefits  from  the  Project  accruing  from  2003  onwards  will  be\ntimely as energy sales are expected to increase by 3 percent per year in 2003 and 2004, and by\nabout 5 percent per year thereafter.\n\n49.\nBetter electricity supply will considerably improve irrigation and drainage for agricultural\nproduction, the mainstay of economic activities in the project areas. The availability of electricity\nwill also reduce constraints on the development of cottage and small industries, which have a\nsignificant  potential  of  increasing  employment  and  raising  incomes.  Better  energy  supply  will\nalso have considerable benefits for the health of the population, particularly the poor.  Drinking\nwater supply and household electrical appliances such as cooking stoves and electric heaters\ndepend on electricity; when it is not available, people, mostly women and children, have to walk\nfar  to  fetch  water  and  work  hard  to  collect  fuelwood.  The  availability  of  electricity  will  improve\ndrainage of farmland thus reducing the risk of malaria, allow the use of piped water for cooking\nand drinking, and improve services at hospitals, health centers, and schools.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe objectives of the Project are to (i) improve the peoples' quality of life, particularly the\n50.\npoor,  and  support  poverty  reduction \nincreased  availability  of  electricity;  and\nthrough \n(ii) assist in the postconflict economic recovery of Tajikistan. This will be achieved by increasing\nthe  availability  and  reliability  of  power  supply  in  an  environment-friendly  manner,  through  the\nrehabilitation of existing generation, transmission, and distribution facilities developed during the\nFSU era.\n\n51.\nThe  project  components  were  selected  to  provide  a  reliable  and  efficient  power\ninfrastructure to improve the quality of life of the people, support poverty reduction, and assist in\nthe  economic  recovery  of  Tajikistan  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The  Project  has  five\ncomponents (see Map):\n\n (i) \n\npart A: rehabilitation and power supply improvement in mainly poor areas in Khatlon\nRegion comprises rehabilitation of the\n\n(a)  15 MW CHPP;\n\n\f15\n\n(b)  power  transmission  and  distribution  system,  to  benefit  24,000  households  who\n\nare mainly poor returnees who were displaced by the civil war;\n\n(c)  Sovhoz 2 (collective farm) substation in Bishkent District; and\n\n(d)  telecommunication system;\n\n(ii) \n \n\npart B: rehabilitation of NHPP and associated transmission facilities comprises\n\n(a)  rehabilitation and stabilization of the 220 kV switchyard foundations,\n\n(b)  rehabilitation  and  replacement  of  obsolete  220  kV  and  500  kV  switchgear  and\n\nprotective relays at the NHPP and Regar substations,\n\n(c)  excavation of NHPP\u2019s tailrace channel, and\n\n(d)  monitoring of NHPP's dam safety;\n\n(iii) \n\npart  C:  improvement  of  power  supply  reliability  in  Dushanbe  region  comprises\nrehabilitation of two main 220 kV substations at Novaya and Djangal;\n\n(iv) \n\npart D: bulk metering of power supply comprises provision of\n\n(a)  equipment to meter imports and exports of power, and\n\n(b)  distribution network metering; and\n\n(v) \n\npart E: consulting services includes\n\n(a)  supporting project implementation,\n\n(b)  auditing Barki Tajik\u2019s corporate and project accounts, and\n\n(c)  developing implementing regulations for the Energy Law.\n\nC.\n\nTechnical Justification\n\n1. \n\nPart  A:  Rehabilitation  and  Power  Supply  Improvement  in  Poor  Areas  in\nKhatlon Region\n\nIn addition to the general degradation of power generation, transmission, and distribution\n52.\nfacilities  because  of  inadequate  maintenance,  supply  of  electricity  in  Khatlon  Region  has\nsuffered  considerably  from  consequences  of  the  civil  war  from  1992-1996.  The  region  covers\nmost  of  the  area  south  of  Dushanbe,  with  a  population  of  more  than  2  million.  Of  330,000\nhouseholds in the region, about 24,000 households were cut off from power supply due to the\ndestruction of the local distribution  system during the civil war. No substantial repair work has\ntaken  place  since,  and  in  some  areas  households  have  managed  to  reestablish  supply  with\nsubstandard  lines  and  connections  that  are  often  unsafe.  Such  practices  have  increased  line\nlosses significantly and overloaded distribution transformers.\n\n53.\nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  about  230  km  of  medium  voltage  lines,  415  km  of  low\nvoltage  lines,  and  107  substations  that  supply  these  households.  The  substation  rehabilitation\n\n\f16\n\nconsists  mainly  of  increasing  the  capacity  of  existing  transformers  that  are  overloaded,  thus\nreducing  transmission  losses  and  improving  reliability  of  electricity  supply.  In  addition,  the\nhouseholds will be provided with consumer meters to encourage more efficient consumption, as\nconsumers would pay for actual electricity consumption rather than the current system based on\nthe number of rooms per household.\n\n54.\nThe  collective  farm,  Sovhoz  2,  covering  2,500  hectares  in  Bishkent  District  of  Khatlon\nRegion  is  of  particular  importance  as  it  is  in  an  agricultural  district  providing  employment  to\n10,000 people. Due to lack of electricity supply to the drainage pumping station, the land cannot\nbe adequately drained to allow for cultivation and malaria is common in the area. Lack of proper\ndrainage has raised the salinity of the land, making it nonarable, and increasing the salinity of\ndrinking  water,  making  it  unsafe  for  human  consumption.    The  rehabilitation  of  the  associated\nsubstation will provide power to the pumping station.\n\n55.\nIn  addition,  the  Project  will  increase  supply  of  electricity,  especially  in  winter,  in  the\nregion by rehabilitating the 15 MW CHPP, which has not been operating for about eight years\ndue  to  lack  of  funds  to  procure  spare  parts.  The  Project  will  support  the  reconditioning  of\ngenerators,  replacement  of  auxiliary  equipment,  addition  of  a  new  110  kV  circuit  breaker,\nrefurbishment  of  the  lubrication  and  cooling  system,  realignment  of  turbines,  modernization  of\nthe  governing  and  control  system,  and  reconditioning  of  intake  gate  and  penstocks.  These\nmeasures will allow CHPP's plant life to be extended for least another 10 years and generation\nof 36 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity per annum.\n\n56.\nThe  efficiency  of  electricity  supply  operations  in  Khatlon  Region  has  been  severely\nreduced  by  the  lack  of  an  adequate  telecommunication  system.  The  Project  will  improve  the\ntelecommunication system by providing new ultra high frequency and very high frequency radio\nequipment (covering 94 channels and 20 stations), and installing a new digital power line carrier\nsystem including data acquisition connected with the dispatch center in Dushanbe.\n\n2.\n\nPart B: Rehabilitation of NHPP and Associated Transmission Facilities\n\n57.\nGiven  its  size,  the  3,000  MW  NHPP  plays  a  predominant  role  throughout  the  year  in\nTajikistan's  power  supply.  The  Project  will  cover  critical  rehabilitation  measures.  The  main\nconcern  at  present  is  stability  of  the  220  kV  high  voltage  switchyard,  where  large  sinkholes\ncaused by deteriorating subsoil conditions have appeared in 25 percent of the switchyard area.\nWhile  Barki  Tajik  is  undertaking  some  remedial  measures,  the  Project  aims  at  providing  a\nreliable long-term solution to stabilize the foundations in the affected area. If the affected part of\nthe 220 kV switchyard were to collapse, two transmission lines would be disconnected resulting\nin serious disruption in power supply in the south system including Dushanbe. In addition, the\n27-year  old  circuit  breakers  need  to  be  replaced  with  new  circuit  breakers  that  are  more\ncompact and efficient, thus reducing the loading on the foundations. New protection relays are\nincluded  for  all  circuits,  together  with  new  voltage  transformers  and  capacitor  couplers  for  the\n500 kV switchyard.\n\nIn the Soviet era, stability of the NHPP dam, which is the largest rock-filled dam in the\n58.\nworld, was analyzed on a regular basis. Dam monitoring is essential for safety but at present,\nBarki  Tajik  cannot  monitor  the  dam  properly  due  to  lack  of  equipment  and  technology.  The\nProject  will  include  computer  hardware,  software,  and  training  for  the  dam  monitoring  system.\nThe tailrace water head at NHPP is six meters higher than the design head, due to sediments\ndeposited downstream from the powerhouse. Under the Project, dredging of the tailrace section\nof the river will increase power generation by 320 GWh per year.\n\n\f17\n\n59.\nA significant portion of electricity supplied in Tajikistan is delivered through 500 kV and\n220 kV substations at Regar, in addition to the main electricity exchange with Uzbekistan via the\nCentral  Asia  grid.  The  rehabilitation  of  these  substations  will  improve  the  grid\u2019s  efficiency  and\nreliability  of  power  supply.  This  entails  replacement  of  all  seven  500  kV  and  eighteen  220  kV\ncircuit breakers, 500 kV capacitor couplers and voltage transformers, and protective relays.\n\n3.\n\nPart C: Improvement of Power Supply Reliability in Dushanbe Region\n\n60.\nThe following measures are needed to improve power supply reliability in the Dushanbe\nregion,  which  has  one  million  people:  (i)  increase  the  220/110  kV  transformer  capacity  at  the\nNovaya  and  Djangal  substations,  which  currently  have  two  transformers  of  125  million  volt-\namperes each, by an additional transformer at each substation; and (ii) replace the 220 kV and\n110  kV  bulk  oil  circuit  breakers,  which  are  30  years  old,  at  the  two  substations.  The  two\nsubstations are the main supply points to the Dushanbe region and supply about 9 GWh daily.\nThe existing transformers are overloaded, and with no spares available in stock, a transformer\noutage  would  significantly  reduce  power  supply  for  at  least  a  month.  The  failure  of  circuit\nbreakers  would  also  result  in  interruptions  or  reductions  in  power  supply  to  the  Dushanbe\nregion.\n\n4.\n\nPart D: Bulk Metering of Power Supply\n\n61.\nAbout  500  electronic  high-voltage  meters  will  be  installed  at  power  plants  and\nhigh-voltage  substations  to  accurately  measure  electricity  exports  and  imports,  electricity\ngenerated and sent-out, and the amount of electricity exchanged among Barki Tajik\u2019s regional\ndistribution  networks.  The  existing  meters  are  old,  and  their  accuracy  is  doubtful.  The  new\nexport-import  meters  will  help  resolve  disputes  over  payment  for  electricity  transfers,  and  will\nallow accurate computation of power losses, thus benefiting consumers in the long run.\n\nThe  meters  at  the  boundaries  of  regional  distribution  networks  will  allow  accurate\n62.\nmeasurement  of  power  transfers  between  supply  companies,  and  identification  of  losses.\nConsumers  will  benefit  from  such  measures  to  reduce  losses.  The  meters  will  also  allow  load\nprofiles to be monitored thus enabling proper planning of electricity dispatch, and in future will\npermit the automatic collection of data (when the communication system is put in place).\n\n5. \n\nPart E: Consulting Services\n\nApproximately  216  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  needed  for  project\n63.\nimplementation  activities,  comprising  project  management  services,  social  and  environmental\nmonitoring,  assistance  with  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation,  engineering  design,  tendering,\nsupervision  of  installation,  testing  and  commissioning  of  equipment,  technical  support,  and\ntraining.    Consulting  services  (approximately  21  person-months)  will  also  be  provided  to  audit\nBarki Tajik\u2019s corporate and project accounts for 2000 and 2001 in accordance with IAS, and to\nformulate  recommendations  for  improving  financial  management  at  Barki  Tajik.  In  addition,  to\ndevelop corporate charters and regulations for implementing the Energy Law, about 24 person-\nmonths of consulting services will be provided to the Government.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe estimated total project cost is $62.8 million equivalent, including physical and price\n64.\ncontingencies and interest and other charges during construction (Table 4 and Appendix 4). The\nProject  is  expected  to  be  exempt  from  taxes  and  duties  in  connection  with  procurement  of\n\n\fgoods and services.31 Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $49.3 million (78.5 percent) and\nlocal currency costs at $13.5 million equivalent (21.5 percent).\n\n18\n\nTable 4: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nForeign\nCurrency\n\n  Local\nCurrency\n\n     Total\n     Cost\n\nRehabilitation and Improvement of Power Supply to Khatlon Region\nRehabilitation of NHPP and Associated Transmission\nImproving Reliability of Power Supply to Dushanbe Region\n\n14.93\n13.81\n9.28\n0.71\n3.17\n41.90\n\n3.73\n2.38\n6.11\n1.29\n49.30\n\n2.53\n3.22\n0.57\n0.05\n0.27\n6.64\n\n0.64\n0.68\n1.32\n5.54\n13.50\n\n17.46\n17.03\n9.85\n0.76\n3.44\n48.54\n\n4.37\n3.06\n7.43\n6.83\n62.80\n\nA.

Parallel cofinancing of $9.3 million (15 percent of the total\nproject  cost)  from  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  and  $6  million  (9  percent  of  the  total  project\ncost) from the Swiss Government is expected to finance the rest of the foreign exchange costs.\nBarki Tajik will bear the entire local currency costs, amounting to 22 percent of the total project\ncost. The financing plan is summarized in Table 5.\n\nTable 5: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n34.00\n9.30\n6.00\n0.00\n49.30\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n13.50\n13.50\n\nTotal\n34.00\n  9.30\n  6.00\n13.50\n62.80\n\nPercent\n54.1\n14.8\n9.6\n21.5\n100.0\n\nADB\nIslamic Development Bank\nSwiss Government\nBarki Tajik\n              Total\n\n            Source: Staff estimates.\n\n66.\nThe  ADB  loan  of  $34  million  equivalent  from  the  Special  Funds  resources  will  have  a\nrepayment period of 32 years, including an 8-year grace period. The service charge on the ADB\nloan  will  be  1.0  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter. The Borrower will be the Republic of Tajikistan, and the entire loan proceeds, except\nfor $0.6 million (for the consulting services for the implementing regulations of the Energy Law)\nwill  be  relent  to  Barki  Tajik  pursuant  to  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  on  terms  and  conditions\nacceptable to ADB. The relending terms will include a repayment period of 25 years, including a\n5-year  grace  period.  Relending  will  be  denominated  in  local  currency  and  at  ADB\u2019s  ordinary\ncapital resources interest rate for multicurrency loans, as indicative local interest rates are not\n\n                  \n\n31  An  amendment  to  the  tax  code  to  provide  tax  exemption  for  goods  and  services  acquired  with  proceeds  of\nconcessionary  loans  from  international  financial  institutions  to  the  Government  is  under  consideration  by\nParliament and is expected to be passed prior to loan effectiveness. The Government has given its assurance that\nif the amendment is not passed and any taxes are imposed, the Government will cover the cost of any such taxes.\n\n\f19\n\nreadily available. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government, as Barki Tajik's\nfinancial  situation  is  not  healthy  and  the  Government  does  not  want  to  distress  it  further  by\nadding the foreign exchange risk to the onlent funds. The proceeds of cofinancing by the Swiss\nGovernment  will  be  relent  by  the  Government  to  Barki  Tajik  under  similar  conditions  as\nrelending of the ADB loan. The proceeds of cofinancing by the Islamic Development Bank will\nbe  made  available  by  the  Government  to  Barki  Tajik  on  the  same  terms  as  those  to  the\nGovernment.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Implementation\n\n67.\nBarki  Tajik,  which  has  managed  several  small  power  projects  will  be  the  Executing\nAgency for the Project and will be responsible for its overall execution and management.  Barki\nTajik will also enter into a project agreement with ADB to confirm it will use the loan proceeds\nfor  the  Project  and  comply  with  all  relevant  provisions  of  the  loan  agreement.  Project\nimplementation  will  be  coordinated  with  the  local  United  Nations  (UN)  office  to  ensure  safe\nworking conditions. A project implementation unit (PIU) was set up in June 2000 to undertake\ncoordination,  reporting,  procurement,  and  disbursement  for  all  project  components  except  for\npart  E  (c).  The  PIU  is  headed  by  a  project  manager,  appointed  by  Barki  Tajik  and  having\nqualifications  acceptable  to  ADB.    Project  implementation  consultants  will  assist  the  PIU  in\nproject management, social and environmental matters, procurement, construction supervision,\nand  training  activities.  All  project  components  are  scheduled  to  be  completed  by  December\n2005 (Appendix 5).\n\n68.\nFor  the  rehabilitation  of  CHPP  (part  A)  and  NHPP  (part  B),  the  major  activities  are\n(i) detailed planning and preparation of bidding documents, during the first six months of 2001;\n(ii) invitation to bid within a period of three months from July 2001; (iii) contract awards at the\nend of 2001; and (iv) completion of construction within two and a half years from January 2002.\nThe  longer  schedule  for  rehabilitation  of  the  transmission  and  distribution  system  in  Khatlon\nRegion is based on the complexity of works involved and similar experience in other transition\neconomies. For this component, the invitation to bid will be issued by mid-2001, the contract will\nbe awarded by the end of 2001, and commissioning will take place almost four years thereafter.\nPart C is expected to be completed within three years and Part D within two and half years from\nJanuary 2002. For part E, shortlisting of project implementation consultants is to be completed\nby the end of 2000 and the selection of consultants will take three months from January 2001.\nConsulting services for implementation will be provided until the end of the Project in late 2005.\nFor auditing Barki Tajik and implementing Energy Law regulations, consultants will be recruited\nby mid-2001 and services provided from 2001 to 2002. MOE will be the Implementing Agency\nresponsible for the selection and supervision of the consultants for the Energy Law regulations.\n\n2.\n\nProcurement\n\n69.\nAll  goods  and  services  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contract packages financed by cofinanciers will be procured\nusing their procedures. The procurement packages for transmission and distribution equipment\nand materials have been optimized to facilitate procurement administration, and to make such\npackages  attractive  for  international  competitive  bidding  (Appendix  6).  All  ADB-financed  civil\nworks contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of more than $1 million and all supply contracts\nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  more  than  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of\n$1 million or less and supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or less will\n\n\f20\n\nbe awarded on the basis of international shopping. The project implementation consultants will\nprescribe  the  functional  design,  and  the  contractor  will  be  responsible  for  detailed  design  of\nplant and equipment on the basis of a two-stage bidding approach. The civil works at the NHPP\nswitchyard  foundations  financed  by  Barki  Tajik  will  comprise  a  package  suitable  for  local\ncompetitive  bidding,  for  which  Barki  Tajik  will  use  ADB's  standard  bidding  documents.  Barki\nTajik will maintain transparency and accountability as required under ADB's anticorruption policy\nin undertaking procurement of goods and services.\n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n70.\nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  implementing  parts  A  to  D.  Approximately  106\nperson-months of international and 110 person-months of domestic consultants will be needed\n(Supplementary  Appendix  D).  Consulting  services  will  also  be  provided  to  audit  Barki  Tajik\u2019s\ncorporate  and  project  accounts  for  fiscal  years  2000  and  2001.  The  auditing  will  be  in\naccordance with IAS and the consultants will make recommendations for improving Barki Tajik's\nfinancial management. This will require about 6 person-months of international and 15 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consultants  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  In  addition,  consulting  services\nwill  be  provided  to  help  the  Government  develop  charters  and  regulations  to  implement  the\nEnergy Law. This will require about 17 person-months of international and 7 person-months of\ndomestic  consulting  services  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  by\nthe Government and Barki Tajik in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The\nGovernment  has  requested  that  the  internationally-recruited  consultants  shall  collaborate  with\nthe domestic consultants. ADB has agreed to this request and specific arrangements relating to\nthe collaboration will be included in the consultants' proposals.\n\n4.\n\nDisbursement\n\nThe  Government  and  Barki  Tajik  will  adopt  either  of  the  following  disbursement\n71.\nprocedures for withdrawing proceeds of the loan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook:  (i)  a  direct  payment  procedure,  where  ADB  at  the  request  of  the  Government  will\npay a designated beneficiary directly; or (ii) a commitment procedure, where ADB at the request\nof  the  Government,  will  reimburse  a  commercial  bank  for  payments  made  or  to  be  made  to  a\nsupplier against a letter of credit financed from the loan account.\n\n5. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n72.\nThere will be continued monitoring and evaluation of project implementation, with timely\nreporting.  Barki  Tajik  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  progress  of  project  implementation  and\nfurnish  ADB  and  cofinanciers  with  copies  of  these  reports.  ADB  will  review  implementation  of\nthe  Project  on  a  regular  basis,  at  least  once  a  year,  and  will  monitor  overall  performance  of\nBarki Tajik. Within three months of completion of the Project, Barki Tajik will furnish ADB with a\nproject  completion  report  covering  details  of  implementation  and  other  information  required  by\nADB. Barki Tajik will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project and will have the\naccounts  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Copies  of  audited\nproject accounts will be provided to ADB within nine months after the end of each relevant fiscal\nyear.  Barki  Tajik  will  also  provide  ADB  with  copies  of  its  audited  corporate  accounts  within  12\nmonths of the end of its fiscal year. Loan funds will be used to retain auditors for the first two\nannual  audits  of  the  project  and  corporate  accounts.  Barki  Tajik  will  finance  the  subsequent\nannual audits.\n\n\f6.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n21\n\n 73.\nBarki  Tajik  and  its  environmental  and  social  monitoring  unit  will  carry  out  all  benefit\nmonitoring and evaluation activities of the Project. These will be undertaken in accordance with\nrelevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation: A Handbook for Bank Staff,\nStaff of Executing Agencies, and Consultants. At the beginning of project implementation, Barki\nTajik  will  submit  to  ADB  a  report  on  the  benchmark  information,  to  be  followed  by  annual\nperformance  reports  for  at  least  the  first  five  years  of  project  implementation.  Upon  project\ncompletion, a comprehensive report will be submitted. In addition, three years after completion,\nBarki Tajik will finance out of its own funds a benefit monitoring and evaluation study to assess\noverall benefits of the Project and review the results of the social and environmental monitoring.\n\n74.\nEach of the project\u2019s 24,000 beneficiary households in Khatlon Region will be identified\nin Barki Tajik\u2019s records to distinguish them from nonproject households. During the benchmark\nsurvey,  annual  reviews,  and  after  completion  of  the  Project,  Barki  Tajik  will  collect  information\non  (i)  cost  of  new  connections  including  metering;  (ii)  increase  in  the  household  electrification\nratio  resulting  from  the  Project;  (iii)  electricity  sales  to  the  newly  connected  households  and\nrelated O&M costs; (iv) new economic activities induced by providing reliable electricity supply;\n(v) estimated total value of economic activities induced by rehabilitation of the transmission and\ndistribution  systems;  (vi)  estimated  average  income  levels;  and  (vii)  perceived  importance  of\nvarious types of noneconomic benefits (disaggregated by gender) created by electricity supply,\nsuch  as  improved  quality  of  life  and  leisure  activities,  better  environment  for  study,  and\nimproved health standards. Barki Tajik will also concurrently survey average income levels and\nother socioeconomic indicators in selected communities where the electricity supply system has\nbeen  and  has  not  been  affected  by  the  Project.  Based  on  this  information,  a  comprehensive\nreport  on  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  prepared  by  Barki  Tajik  and  be\nsubmitted to ADB within three months after Project completion.\n\nG. \n\nExecuting Agency\n\n1.\n\nBarki Tajik\n\n75.\nBarki  Tajik  is  the  state-owned  utility  responsible  for  generation,  transmission,  and\ndistribution of electricity and heat32 in Tajikistan. Prior to the country\u2019s independence, the entity\nwas  administratively  part  of  the  FSU's  MOE.  Upon  independence  in  1992,  it  became  a  state\njoint stock holding company.33 Although it is fully owned by the Government, Barki Tajik enjoys\nautonomous status according to its charter.\n\n 76.\nUnder  the  present  institutional  arrangement,  Barki  Tajik  consists  of  a  network  of  10\nsubsidiary power generation companies, 11 subsidiary distribution companies, and 8 supporting\ncompanies  such  as  a  research \ninstitute  and  construction  companies  (Supplementary\nAppendix  G).  The  chairperson  of  Barki  Tajik,  who  has  overall  responsibility  for  operations,\nreports directly to the Prime Minister, and is appointed by the Government with no fixed term.\nThe chairperson is assisted by the first deputy chairperson (chief engineer), who manages Barki\nTajik\u2019s  day-to-day  operations,  and  six  deputy  chairpersons  who  are  in  charge  of  the  technical\ndepartments, supporting services, and subsidiary power generation and distribution companies.\nSince 1999, the Government has created business units for some of these subsidiaries,34 with\nownership rights vested directly in the State Property Committee on behalf of the Government\nbut with business management responsibilities assigned to Barki Tajik.\n\n                  \n\n32 Barki Tajik is responsible for heat supply to Dushanbe and Khujand only.\n33 Decree No. 272 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Tajikistan of 24 July 1992.\n34 Tursunzade,  Dushanbe  Central,  Khulyab  region,  Khulyab  City,  Ura-Tyube  and  Panjikent  networks;  Baipinskaya\n\nand Pamir hydropower plants; Tajik Energy Construction Enterprise, and Tajikenergo Naladka Installations.\n\n\f22\n\nBarki Tajik's organizational structure needs improvement. The roles and responsibilities\n77.\nbetween executive and nonexecutive leadership are not clearly defined and there is a relatively\nhigh degree of overlapping of functions and responsibilities between various departments, both\ntechnical  and  commercial.  Therefore,  substantial  changes,  both  organizational  and  regulatory,\nare  needed.  In  accordance  with  the  ESAP,  the  corporatization  and  commercialization  of  Barki\nTajik  will  involve  restructuring  along  its  business  unit  lines  for  generation,  transmission,  and\ndistribution, and a reorganization of its structure.\n\n2. \n\nAccounting and Financial Management\n\n78.\nBarki  Tajik's  accounting  standards  do  not  fully  meet  IAS  requirements.  TA  will  be\nprovided to Barki Tajik to introduce IAS (para. 96). The accounting and financial management\nfunctions  of  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  subsidiaries  are  managed  by  the  respective  company  accounting\ndepartments. The Central Accounting Department within Barki Tajik\u2019s head office prepares Barki\nTajik\u2019s consolidated financial statements and management reports, and is responsible for cash\nflow management. There are 155 accounting staff employed across Barki Tajik, of which 13 are\nemployed in the head office.\n\n79.\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  regulates  the  accounting  systems  of  state-owned\nenterprises. The accounting regulations, while amended in 1997, are not in conformity with IAS.\nBarki Tajik submits quarterly and annual financial reports to MOF. MOF, with the assistance of a\ntax  committee,  audits  Barki  Tajik's  financial  statements  biennially.  Barki  Tajik's  Planning\nDepartment  is  responsible  for  preparing  the  annual  budget  and  reviewing  it  quarterly.\nComputerization of Barki Tajik's accounting procedures in both head office and subsidiaries is\nlimited.\n\n3.\n\nPast Financial Performance\n\n80.\nDuring  the  FSU  era,  the  power  sector  within  Tajikistan  operated  as  a  part  of  the  MOE\nbased in Moscow. Tariffs were uniform throughout the FSU, and fuel costs were kept artificially\nlower than world prices. Any financial surpluses produced by the power sector were transferred\nto  the  state  budget,  which  in  turn  financed  all  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  investment  requirements.  Hence,\nthere are no long-term borrowings in Barki Tajik\u2019s books.\n\n81.\nAn  analysis  of  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  past  financial  performance  is  complex  considering  the\nnoncompliance with IAS, the lack of reliable information, and the high depreciation of the Tajik\nruble.35 Barki Tajik\u2019s financial statements for 1997 to 1999 (Appendix 7), have been restated by\nTA consultants (footnote 3) in dollar terms to broadly conform with IAS and are summarized in\nTable  6.  Overall,  Barki  Tajik's  past  financial  performance  has  been  weak.  Revenues  have  not\nbeen  sufficient  to  cover  operating  costs  and  returns  on  net  fixed  assets  have  been  negative.\nThe  collection  efficiency  has  been  low,  resulting  in  high  accounts  receivable.  Furthermore,\nhuman,  managerial,  and  office  resources  have  been  inadequate.  Mainly  because  of  the  Tajik\nruble\u2019s depreciation in 1998, gross revenues, in dollar equivalent, fell from $77.7 million in 1997\nto  $44.9  million  in  1998.  Tariff  increases  made  for  residential,  water  supply,  and  public  sector\nconsumers in 1999 (in dollar terms) resulted in a growth of gross revenues that year. A major\ncost item accounting for 37 percent of Barki Tajik's cash operating costs is the import of natural\ngas used by the Dushanbe Thermal Power Plant.36 Another major expense (19 percent of the\ntotal)  is  the  purchase  of  electricity,  at  about  $0.05/kWh,  from  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Turkmenistan,\n\n                  \n\n35 From $1=TJR50 in May 1995 to $1=TJR2,000 in August 2000, a depreciation of 97 percent over 64 months.\n36 The other thermal power plant, Yavan in the south system, has not operated since 1997.\n\n\f23\n\nand Uzbekistan. Under the national accounting system, Barki Tajik had to pay income tax from\n1997 to 1999; however, under IAS accounting presentation, Barki Tajik\u2019s operations would have\nresulted in net operating losses and not be subject to tax. As of the end of 1999, fixed assets\nwere grossly undervalued in Barki Tajik\u2019s books, with a total of only $96 million against a gross\nreplacement  value  estimated  at  about  $3.75  billion.  As  a  result,  tariffs  failed  to  ensure\nappropriate capital cost recovery. Barki Tajik\u2019s accounts receivable have been a major problem\nwith a gross total at the end of 1999 of $67 million, or a net total of $46.8 million after deducting\nprovision for bad debts; this is the equivalent of 11.4 months of gross billings (paras. 42 to 44).\nRetained  earnings  are  minimal  in  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  balance  sheets  as  all  operating  surpluses  are\ntransferred to the Government.\n\n4.\n\nFinancial Projections\n\nA  major  part  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  has  been  devoted  to\n82.\nimproving Barki Tajik\u2019s financial performance. A comprehensive approach has been developed\nin the ESAP that involves (i) improving operational efficiency and reducing losses, (ii) improving\nthe  financial  management  system  and  accounting  standards,  and  (iii)  adjusting  the  level  and\nstructure of tariffs.\n\n83.\nBarki  Tajik\u2019s  financial  projections  are  based  on  agreements  reached  with  the\nGovernment to implement financial reforms that include the following: (i) Barki Tajik will adopt a\ndebt  service  covenant  of  at  least  1.3  times;  (ii)  the  Government  will  undertake  all  necessary\nactions, including base tariff increases and implementation of tariff adjustments arising from the\nquarterly automatic tariff adjustment mechanism, to ensure that Barki Tajik's operating ratio will\nbe below 90 percent from 2002 on, and Barki Tajik will generate a rate of return of 6 percent on\nnet fixed assets from the end of 2005 on; and (iii) Barki Tajik will reduce accounts receivable to\nthe  equivalent  of  six  months  of  billings  by  December  2001  and  three  months  of  billings  by\nDecember 2002.\n\n84. With  the  implementation  of  these  measures,  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  financial  performance  is\nexpected  to  gradually  improve  (Appendix  7  and  Table  6).  The  financial  projections  assume\nannual  tariff  increases  in  dollar  terms  of  22  percent  in  2000,  25  percent  between  2001  and\n2005, and 10 percent thereafter. Such increases are realistic given the low tariff level and the\napplication of the lifeline tariff which benefits mostly the poor. Electricity sales are conservatively\nestimated to grow at 2.0 percent per year between 2000 and 2002, at an average of 3.2 percent\nper  year  between  2003  and  2004,  and  at  an  average  of  5.3  percent  per  year  from  2005  to\n2015.37 The operating ratio is expected to deteriorate in 2000, mainly due to the revaluation of\nBarki Tajik\u2019s fixed assets and resulting depreciation expenses, but will gradually improve to 77\npercent  by  2003.  After  generating  a  negative  return  on  net  fixed  assets  during  2000  and\nbreaking even in 2001, Barki Tajik is expected to yield a rate of return of 6.7 percent by 2005.\n\n37 In 1998 and 1999, the sales growth was 24 percent and 7 percent respectively.\n\n                  \n\n\f24\n\nActual\n1998\n\nTable 6: Barki Tajik's Past and Projected Financial Performance\n\nProjected\n2003\n\nItem\n\nUnit\nGWh\nElectricity Sales\n%\nIncrease in Sales\nUS\u00a2/kWh\nAverage Tariff\n%\nIncrease in Tariff\nElectricity Sales\n$ million\nOperating Income Before Tax $ million\nTotal Assets a\n$ million\n$ million\nLong-Term Debt\n$ million\nTotal Equity\n%\nOperating Ratio\nReturn on Net Fixed Assets %\nAccounts Receivable\nDebt Service Ratio\n\nMonths\nTimes\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.8\n\n5.1\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n0.0\n\n6.5\n\n24.4\n\n2004\n\n2002\n\n2005\n\n1997\n\n2001\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2.1\n49\n-6\n\n22.0\n61\n-10\n\n2006\n10,045 12,495 13,310 13,576 13,848 14,125 14,478 15,035 15,808 16,651\n5.3\n0.773 0.359 0.367 0.448 0.559 0.699 0.874 1.093 1.366 1.502\n10.0\n250\n141\n155 1,310 1,307 1,332 1,347 1,366 1,372 1,373\n64\n120 1,291 1,291 1,299 1,292 1,302 1,302 1,301\n44\n111\n8.7\n-5.2\n3.0\n11.4\n28.1\n-\n\n0.0\n78\n-24\n110\n0\n60\n131\n-38.2\n5.3\n-\n\n-53.5\n45\n-4\n201\n0\n159\n108\n-4.4\n12.7\n-\n\n116\n-1.5\n8.4\n-\n\n100\n0.0\n6.0\n-\n\n25.0\n216\n115\n\n25.0\n164\n72\n\n25.0\n127\n33\n\n25.0\n99\n11\n\n25.0\n77\n0\n\n89\n0.6\n3.0\n-\n\n77\n1.9\n3.0\n-\n\n59\n4.1\n3.0\n-\n\n49\n6.7\n3.0\n-\n\n24\n\n50\n\n59\n\n63\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n      a  Assets were revalued in 2000; - = no debt  repayment requirement.\n\nSource:  Staff estimates.\n\nH. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\n85.\nThe  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  major  adverse  impact  on  the  environment.  It\nconsists entirely of rehabilitation of existing structures and facilities. The rehabilitation includes\nreplacing switchgear and transformers at existing substations, rehabilitating existing hydropower\nplant components, and retrofitting new components to existing equipment. The Project has been\nclassified as Category B in ADB\u2019s environmental classification system. An initial environmental\nexamination  was  undertaken  according  to  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  at  the  feasibility  study  stage\n(Appendix 8).\n\n86.\nDuring  construction,  there  could  be  air  pollution  and  noise  caused  by  trucks  and  other\nvehicles for transport of materials and use of machines at sites. However, due to (i) the limited\nscope and duration of construction, (ii) the type of materials to be transported, and (iii) the fact\nthat  measures  in  NHPP  take  place  outside  inhabited  areas,  no  negative  impact  requiring\nspecific mitigation measures will occur. An estimated 0.5-1.0 million cubic meters of material will\nhave  to  be  excavated  from  the  NHPP  dam  tailrace.  An  uninhabited  unlevel  area  of  about\n7  hectares  has  been  identified  near  the  construction  site  as  appropriate  for  depositing  the\nexcavated  material.  The  land  belongs  to  the  local  government  and  Barki  Tajik  has  obtained\nauthorization  to  use  the  excavated  material  to  fill  the  uneven  pockets.  The  material  to  be\nexcavated will not present any environmental risk and consists of rocks and sediments. Positive\nenvironmental  impacts  from  this  are  expected  since  tree  cover  can  be  established  once  the\nfilled area is leveled. The Project requires replacement of about 500 tons of transformer oil that\ndoes  not  contain  any  poly-chlorine-biphenyl,  which  would  be  hazardous  to  health  and  the\nenvironment. During replacement of transformers, this oil will be filtered and recycled for use as\nfuel by Barki Tajik. The Government and Barki Tajik have agreed to remove and dispose of all\nhazardous  waste  materials  associated  with  the  Project,  in  a  safe  and  environmentally\nresponsible manner.\n\n\f2.\n\nSocial Aspects\n\n25\n\n87.\nUnder the project preparatory TA (footnote 4), an initial social assessment was carried\nout  and  a  summary  of  the  assessment  was  prepared  according  to  the  ADB  guidelines\n(Appendix  9).  This  assessment  has  shown  that  the  risk  of  negative  socioeconomic  impacts  is\nsmall  or  nonexistent.  None  of  the  components  identified  will  require  any  resettlement,  and  no\nadditional  land  is  required  except  for  the  7  hectares  near  NHPP.  The  improvement  of  energy\nsupply in the project areas will substantially improve the well-being of the people.\n\nElectricity supply is a prerequisite for improving the economic situation and quality of life\n88.\nin  the  project  areas,  as  it  is  required  for  agriculture  (irrigation  and  drainage),  drinking  water\nsupply,  health,  education,  industry,  and  small-scale  enterprises.  Adequate  energy  supply  will\nremove  an  important  obstacle  to  investments,  and  facilitate  operation  of  private  enterprises.\nAgriculture  will  benefit  due  to  improved  irrigation  and  drainage.  Direct  and  indirect  health\nbenefits include (i) improved drainage that will reduce the risks from malaria, and saline water in\nfarmland  and  water  table,  (ii)  improved  water  supply  through  use  of  electric  pumps,  and  (iii)\nability  to  boil  water  efficiently  thus  reducing  risks  from  unsafe  water.  Provision  of  lighting  and\nheating in schools will improve the education facilities and increase school enrolment.\n\n3. \n\nGender and Development\n\n89.\nBased  on  UNDP's  gender-related  development  index,  which  fell  from  0.57  in  1995  to\n0.53  in  1998,  the  relative  position  of  women  has  deteriorated.  Women  are  more  likely  to  be\nunemployed than men: the unemployment rates are 28.8 percent for women and 25.3 percent\nfor  men.38  Women\u2019s  wages  average  only  $2  per  month  as  compared  with  men\u2019s  wages\naveraging  $6  per  month.  Women  spend  an  average  of  6.3  hours  per  day  of  unpaid  work\n(cooking, working on private plots, cleaning, laundry, etc.) compared to 3.3 hours by men. The\nwar  has  left  an  estimated  26,000  widows  and  55,000  orphans  who  are  even  more  severely\naffected.\n\n90. Women  and  children  disproportionately  bear  the  burden  of  using  alternative  fuels  to\naugment the lack of reliable electricity supply. Such use has economic, time, labor, health, and\nsocial  impacts.  A  one-month  supply  of  fuelwood  takes  up  to  15  days  to  gather.  Work  on  cow\ndung  briquettes  takes  at  least  one  hour  per  day  per  household  during  the  summer  to  prepare\nthe  required  supply  for  winter.  The  use  of  these  energy  sources,  typically  for  cooking  in\nunventilated  rooms,  constitutes  health  hazards \nfor  women  and  children,  who  spend\napproximately five hours per day in such rooms. Prior to independence, piped water had been\nprovided to households. However, pumping from reservoirs and deep-wells has been restricted\nbecause  of  the  current  irregular  electricity  supply.  Women  and  children  in  particular  fetch\ndrinking  water  which  takes  substantial  amount  of  time,  as  they  need  to  walk  up  to  15  km  to\nwater sources. Due to transportation and storage, water obtained is often contaminated, and is\nfrequently not boiled due to scarcity of electricity. Consequently, the Project will have significant\npositive impacts on poor women and children, particularly in Khatlon Region, in better health, a\nreduced burden of household chores, and increased time for economic activities.\n\n4.\n\nPoverty Reduction and Improving the Quality of Life of the Poor\n\n91.\nThe  serious  energy  shortage,  particularly  in  rural  areas  and  mainly  during  winter,  has\nbeen  identified  by  the  Government,  households,  community  development  organizations,\nnongovernment  organizations,  and  international  aid  agencies  as  one  of  the  most  important\n\n38 Falkingham, J. 1999. Women and Gender Relations in Tajikistan. London School of Economics, London.\n\n                  \n\n\f26\n\nchallenges to reducing poverty and improving the quality of life of the poor. Unless addressed,\nTajikistan  will  have  difficulty  resuming  economic  growth;  increasing  agricultural  and  industrial\nproductivity;  generating  employment;  increasing  incomes;  and  meeting  basic  needs  such  as\nheating, safe water, and social services. Restoration and improvement of electricity supply is a\nprerequisite for reducing poverty, improving quality of life, and sustaining economic growth.\n\nParticipatory  rural  assessments  conducted  during  project  preparation39  confirmed  high\n92.\nlevels  of  poverty,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  Formal  employment  is  low,  and,  where  available,\nconsists  mostly  of  civil  service  employment  where  salaries  are  often  several  months  late;  or\nseasonal  employment  in  collective  farms  paying  TJR2,000  ($1)  per  month  during  spring  and\nTJR10,000  ($5)  per  month  during  summer.  Formal  employment  for  women  is  even  less\navailable.  Women  spend  more  time  than  men  at  home  doing  unpaid  work.  Households\nsupplement their incomes through home plots, milk production, livestock, and small-scale retail\nactivities.  In  most  households  visited,  these  activities  constituted  the  main  source  of  income.\nMost  income  is  received  during  summer  and  fall  harvest  season,  but  most  expenses  are\nincurred  during  winter  and  spring,  mainly  for  heating  and  clothing.  Poor  households  receive\nhumanitarian  aid  from  donor  agencies  through  the  local  government,  consisting  of  5  liters  of\ncooking oil and/or 10 kilos of flour supplied every 3-6 months.\n\n93.\nIn the project areas, households report that electricity is available intermittently for most\nof the year except during the winter (December to March), when electricity is available only for\n2-4 hours a day. Because of lack of electricity, people have shifted to alternative sources of fuel.\nHouseholds spend as much as TJR25,000 (including time and cost) for fuelwood during winter\nmonths,  and  where  fuelwood  is  scarce,  animal  dung  is  used  exclusively,  averaging  1,500\nbriquettes  during  the  winter  and  300  briquettes  during  the  rest  of  the  year,  which  is  valued  at\nTJR15,000  mainly  for  labor  cost.  Diesel  is  primarily  used  for  lighting  and  igniting  fuelwood  or\nanimal dung, and its cost can reach TJR18,000 during winter months. Field visits confirmed that\nthe Project would have substantial impacts on reduction of poverty and improving the quality of\nlife  of  the  poor  through  provision  of  cheaper  and  reliable  electricity  supply  (valued  at  a  lifeline\ntariff  of  $0.003/kWh  against  alternative  fuel  costs  of  about  $0.032/kWh)  and  freeing  up  time\nused for gathering and using alternative fuels for generating additional income (e.g., working on\nhome plots, bread making, and sewing). In addition, the scarcity of electricity has health, social\nand gender impacts (para. 90).\n\n94.\nThe large  agricultural base,  which is dependent on irrigation, has suffered from lack of\npumping facilities. As a result, farm yield has dropped to 20-25 percent of levels when Tajikistan\nwas part of the FSU. The provision of reliable electricity supply through the Project will reduce\npoverty  by  increasing  farming  activity  and  providing  employment  opportunities  to  the  poor  in\nparticular.  The  provision  of  education  and  health  services  to  the  population  is  similarly\nhampered by lack of electricity, thus reducing the quality of life of the poor in particular. Schools\nare  closed  for  two  months  during  winter  due  to  inadequate  electricity  for  heating.  This  forces\nschools to operate for extended hours during summer. School enrolment has dropped because\npoor children, lacking warm clothes and shoes, do not attend school during the rest of winter.\nHospitals  also  lack  heating,  and  delivery  of  services  is  greatly  hampered  by  lack  of  electricity\nsupply.  In  particular,  crucial  medicines  and  vaccines  cannot  be  properly  stored  at  controlled\nconditions.  Hospitals  that  remain  operational  are  in  urban  administrative  centers,  resulting  in\nhigh transportation costs and long travel time leading to even higher expenses for the poor who\nlive far from the centers. The Project will improve people's quality of life (especially for the poor)\nby providing reliable and adequate electricity supply to schools and hospitals.\n\n39 Financed under TA 5894-REG: Facilitating Capacity Building and Participatory Activities II, for $400,000, approved\n\n                  \n\non 28 December 1999.\n\n\f27\n\nI.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n95.\nTo  help  Barki  Tajik  meet  targets  set  under  the  ESAP,  the  Government  requested  two\nTAs40  to  be  provided  under  the  Project.  The  first  TA,  Improving  Barki  Tajik's  Billing  and\nCollection System, will help Barki Tajik design and implement a billing and collection system to\nreduce  its  accounts  receivable.  The  TA  will  (i)  cover  implementation  of  a  pilot  computerized\nsystem  to  support  the  billing  and  collection  system  at  a  large  distribution  subsidiary,  (ii)\nformulate  recommendations  for  improvement  of  the  consumer  management  process  covering\nbilling and collection for electricity customers, and (iii) provide training for Barki Tajik staff in the\nuse  of  the  system.  About  12  person-months  of  international  and  about  10  person-months  of\ndomestic consulting services will be required. The study will be carried out by an international\naccounting firm with expertise in consumer accounting, financial management, and information\nsystems. The terms of reference are given in Supplementary Appendix H. The total cost of the\nTA is estimated at $586,000 equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of $492,000 and a local\ncurrency  cost  of  $94,000  equivalent.  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant\nbasis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan,  to  cover  the  entire\nforeign  exchange  costs  and  part  of  the  local  currency  costs  amounting  to  $8,000  equivalent.\nThe  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $86,000  equivalent,  representing  15  percent  of  the  total\ncost of the TA, will be financed by Barki Tajik to cover (i) counterpart staff, (ii) local transport for\nconsultants  and  counterpart  staff,  (iii)  secretarial  support  and  office  supplies,  and  (iv)  office\naccommodation. The TA is expected to commence in May 2001 and will require about 8 months\nto be completed.\n\nThe  second  TA,  Introducing  IAS  at  Barki  Tajik,  will  help  Barki  Tajik  introduce  IAS  and\n96.\nprepare its corporate accounts for the year 2001 in line with both national regulations and IAS.\nBarki  Tajik\u2019s  accounting  practices  are  rudimentary  and  need  to  be  improved  to  reflect  its\nfinancial situation correctly. Enhanced accounting practices will also support systems to improve\ncost  recovery  and  reduce  accounts  receivable.  Approximately  11.5  person-months  of\ninternational and 10-person months of domestic consulting services are required. The study will\nbe  carried  out  by  an  international  accounting  firm  with  expertise  in  accounting,  financial\nmanagement,  and  information  systems.  The  terms  of  reference  are  given  in  Supplementary\nAppendix  I.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $586,000  equivalent,  with  a  foreign\nexchange  cost  of  $490,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $96,000  equivalent.  $500,000\nequivalent will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund funded by the\nGovernment of Japan, to cover the entire foreign exchange costs and part of the local currency\ncosts amounting to $10,000 equivalent. The remaining local currency cost of $86,000 equivalent\n(representing  15  percent  of  the  total  cost  of  the  TA)  will  be  financed  by  Barki  Tajik  to  cover\n(i)  counterpart  staff,  (ii)  local  transport  for  consultants  and  counterpart  staff,  (iii)  secretarial\nsupport and office supplies, and (iv) office accommodation. The TA is expected to commence in\nJuly 2001 and will require about 10 months to be completed.\n\n97.\nBoth  TAs  are  essential  for  the  commercialization  of  Barki  Tajik  and  will  facilitate  the\ncreation  of  an  appropriate  new  organizational  structure.  For  both  TAs,  full  technical  proposals\nwill  be  requested  from  shortlisted  firms,  and  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB on the\nengagement of domestic consultants.\n\n40 The TAs were first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities on 15 May 2000 and 15 September  2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f28\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1. \n\nLeast Cost Analysis\n\n98.\nDuring  the  feasibility  study  (footnote  4),  a  large  number  of  potential  alternatives,\nincluding a do-nothing option, and their costs have been analyzed. For example, dredging of the\nNHPP tailrace was compared with four options: (i) import of an additional 320 GWh of energy,\n(ii) build a new hydro or diesel power plant providing 320 GWh, (iii) increase turbine efficiency\nwith new runners, and (iv) do nothing. In a similar manner, least cost options were examined for\nother project-components, with more than 25 options considered in all. This analysis confirmed\nthat all project components are part of the least cost plan for power development in Tajikistan.\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nFinancial analysis for the Project from the perspective of Barki Tajik is based on capital\n99.\ncosts of $52.9 million\u2014base costs plus physical contingencies, assuming an economic life of 15\nyears\u20145  years  for  construction  and  10  years  for  operation41  (Appendix  10).  Incremental\nbenefits  of  the  Project  are  based  on  a  \"with  project\"  and  \"without  project\"  comparison  and\ninclude  the  incremental  energy  generated,  improved  reliability  of  power  supply,  and  avoided\nelectricity  losses.42  In  particular,  such  incremental  benefits  are  expected  to  be  gained  from  (i)\nincreased  power  generation  and  supply  reliability  in  Khatlon  Region  due  to  improved  voltage\nand  uninterrupted  electricity  supply,  avoided  technical  losses,  and  reduction  of  substandard\ninefficient  connections;  (ii)  increased  power  generation  and  supply  reliability  through  the\nrehabilitation  of  NHPP;  and  (iii)  increased  power  supply  reliability  and  transmission  efficiency\nthrough  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Novaya  and  Djangal  substations.  These  incremental  benefits\nare measured in billed electricity sales estimated at about 7.6 TWh during the period of analysis,\nand valued at average revenue as per financial projections for Barki Tajik (but at constant year\n2000 prices). On this basis, and after allowance for adequate O&M costs and income tax, the\nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project is 7.7 percent. The weighted average cost\nof  project  capital  has  not  been  determined,  because  the  uncertain  economic  conditions\nprevailing in Tajikistan do not allow determination of an indicative set of interest rates and rates\nof return. However, the FIRR level indicates that the Project is financially viable in comparison\nwith the onlending rate to Barki Tajik. The results of sensitivity analysis, which are summarized\nin Table 7, show that the Project remains financially viable with changes in key assumptions.\n\nCase\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nBase Case\nCapital Cost\nBenefits\nImplementation Delay\n\n        - = not applicable.\n        Source: Staff estimates.\n\nTable 7: Financial Analysis of the Project\n\nChange\n\n+10%\n-10%\nOne year\n\nFIRR (%)\n7.7\n6.4\n6.3\n6.8\n\nSensitivity Indicator\n    -\n1.71\n1.89\n0.58\n\n                  \n\n41 Since  the  Project  does  not  involve  complete  rehabilitation  of  all  components,  a  10-year  period  for  operation  was\n\nconservatively assumed as for similar projects in Mongolia and Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n42 This approach to valuation of benefits is conservative. If a comprehensive comparison were made between \u201cwith\nproject\" and \"without project\" situations, larger benefits would result, particularly given the likely rapid deterioration\nof the system in the \"without project\" situation.\n\n\f3.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n29\n\n100.\nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  has  also  been  estimated  comparing  the\n\"with project\" and \"without project\" scenarios following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis\nof Projects (Appendix 11). All applicable assumptions used for the financial analysis have been\nmaintained  for  the  economic  analysis.  In  addition,  for  the  economic  analysis,  (i)  capital  and\noperating  cost  data  taken  from  the  financial  analysis  have  been  adjusted  to  reflect  economic\nvalues; and  (ii) in  calculating the  economic capital costs, all duties, taxes, and subsidies have\nbeen excluded. Total electricity demand has been divided into incremental and nonincremental\ncomponents. The nonincremental part of energy demand is assumed to be about two-thirds of\ntotal demand and is valued at resource cost savings. The incremental part is valued in terms of\nusers\u2019 willingness to pay. All tradable commodities are valued at border price at the prevailing\nexchange rate (TJR2,000 = $1). Nontradable commodities are valued at shadow price using a\nstandard conversion factor of 0.9.\n\n101. On  this  basis,  the  EIRR  for  the  Project  is  28.0  percent,  which  is  well  above  ADB\u2019s\nthreshold for economic viability of 12 percent. The net present value of the Project is estimated\nat  TJR84.6  billion  at  12  percent  discount  rate.  Sensitivity  analysis  has  been  carried  out  for\nincreased  capital  cost,  reduced  benefits,  implementation  delay,  change  in  willingness  to  pay,\nand a combination of cases (Table 8). The assumptions made are conservative, the estimated\neconomic  indicators  robust,  the  poverty  reduction  impacts  substantial,  and  the  project\ncomponents  part  of  the  least  cost  plan  for  power  development.  Consequently,  the  proposed\nProject is considered economically justified.\n\nTable 8: EIRR and Sensitivity Analysis\n\nCase\n\nChange\n\nEIRR (%)\nPart B Part C\n21.6\n40.3\n20.1\n37.3\n19.9\n36.8\n17.9\n31.5\n18.5\n33.9\n16.6\n29.3\n16.4\n29.0\n21.6\n       -\n23.2\n43.2\n  SI = sensitivity indicator; SV = switching value; WTP = willingness to pay; - = not applicable.\n  Source: Staff estimates.\n\n1.

The  difference  between  the  financial  and  economic  net\npresent  values,  and  consequent  gains  and  losses  for  different  stakeholders,  provide  the  basis\nfor  considering the  impact  of the Project on the poor. For the poverty impact assessment, the\nproject  beneficiaries  are  divided  into  three  groups:  consumers,  Government  economy,  and\nlabor.  The  net  economic  benefits  by  group  are  distributed  between  poor  and  nonpoor.  The\nincreased, more efficient, and reliable electricity supply resulting from the Project will benefit the\npoor directly and indirectly. Net economic benefits accruing to the poor are estimated at about\n$27  million  (Appendix  12).    The  poverty  impact  ratio,  which  expresses  the  proportion  of  net\neconomic  benefits  of  the  Project  accruing  to  the  poor,  is  estimated  at  57  percent.  This  is\n\n\f30\n\nconservative  as  some  indirect  economic  and  social  benefits  are  not  considered.  Hence,  a\nsubstantial  portion  of  the  project  benefits  will  go  to  the  poor  and  the  Project  can  achieve  its\nprimary objective of poverty reduction.\n\n103.\nThe  participatory  rural  assessments  (footnote  39)  confirmed  that  the  Project  would\nreduce  poverty.  The  project  areas  are  characterized  by  high  levels  of  poverty  and  are  largely\nrural. Due to climatic conditions, electricity is a basic need for heat, cooking, and irrigation water\nin the project areas. The Project will also support improvement of other essential services such\nas  drinking  water,  education,  and  health.  Adequate  and  reliable  electricity  will  help  generate\njobs  through  (i)  economic  development,  and  (ii)  reduction  of  time  spent  obtaining  and  using\nenergy  alternatives  for  productive  activities.  This  will  have  significant  impact  on  vulnerable\ngroups, particularly women and children.\n\n104. Part  A  of  the  Project  will  have  the  greatest  impact  on  the  poor  because  it  will  improve\npower  supply  for  approximately  24,000  households  comprised  mostly  of  civil  war  returnees  in\nKhatlon Region. Field visits confirmed that returnees are among the poorest segment of society.\nThe collective farm Sovhoz 2 in the war-affected Bishkent District is of particular importance for\nagricultural  production  (para.  54).  The  substation  rehabilitation  will  provide  power  to  the\npumping  station,  which  will  considerably  improve  conditions  for  agricultural  production  in  the\ndistrict and reduce constraints on the development of small industries.\n\n105. Electricity is required for economic growth and higher incomes, but it cannot be supplied\nat the current low prices on a sustainable basis. The prevalent extreme levels of poverty affect\nthe ability of a significant portion of the population to pay higher electricity prices. If Barki Tajik is\nunable  to  collect  its  bills,  the  power  system  will  eventually  collapse,  making  the  poor  even\nworse-off.  The  Government  has  studied  several  possibilities  of  introducing  social  safety\nmeasures  to  subsidize  electricity  for  the  poorest  segment  of  the  population  (Appendix  13).\nDuring the policy dialogue, the Government has agreed that in the medium term, there will be\nno  real  increases  in  the  tariff  for  an  initial  household  consumption  of  150  kWh  per  month.\nA  study  of  alternative  fuel  costs  paid  by  poor  households  shows  that  the  current  tariff  of\nTJR5/kWh  to  be  applied  to  this  lifeline  consumption  is  affordable.  As  83  percent  of  the\npopulation  live  below  the  poverty  line,  such  an  arrangement  is  considered  justified.  The\nGovernment also proposes to use the interest margin arising from relending the loan from ADB\nand  cofinancing  from  the  Swiss  Government  to  Barki  Tajik  to  fund  the  subsidy  for  the  lifeline\ntariff.  If  required,  the  Government  will  make  up  for  any  shortfall  in  the  subsidy  to  Barki  Tajik.\nUnder the ESAP, by January 2002, the Government is to provide proposals, acceptable to ADB,\nfor a safety net to protect the poor and vulnerable groups adequately with regard to impact of\ntariff  increases  in  the  long  term.  Measures  to  be  considered  include  changes  to  the  tariff\nstructure for residential consumers, and the provision of a well targeted cash subsidy scheme to\nthe poor and vulnerable groups.\n\nB. \n\nEnvironment\n\n106.\nThe  Project  will  have  considerable  environmental  benefits,  mainly  through  reducing\nlosses  in  energy  production  at  NHPP;  eliminating  the  risk  of  NHPP's  switchyard  collapsing\nwhich  could  lead  to  oil  from  the  transformers  contaminating  the  Vaksh  River;  improving  dam\nsafety  at  NHPP;  reducing  electricity  losses  in  the  distribution  system  in  Khatlon  Region;  and\nreducing  pressure  on  alternative  sources  of  energy,  mainly  fuelwood43  and  other  biomass\nresources.\n\n43 The forest cover in Tajikistan is only 2.3 percent.\n\n                  \n\n\fC.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n31\n\n107.\nThe  risk  of  negative  socioeconomic  impacts  from  the  Project  is  small  or  nonexistent.\nSince the Project focuses only on rehabilitation of existing facilities, none of the components will\nrequire any resettlement. About 7 hectares of uninhabited land is required as a dumping ground\nfor rocks and sediments from the dredging of Vaksh River and Barki Tajik has already received\nthe  local  government's  approval  to  use  this  land  at  no  cost  (para.  86).  The  Project  will\nsubstantially  improve  the  social  well-being  of  about  172,000  households,  most  of  which  are\npoor.  Given  the  climate  in  the  project  areas,  electricity  is  a  basic  need  for  heat,  cooking,  and\npumping  of  safe  drinking  water.  The  Project  will  also  support  the  improvement  of  essential\nservices  such  as  irrigation  and  drainage,  education,  and  health;  facilitate  direct  employment;\nand  help  generate  jobs  through  induced  economic  development  and  by  releasing  time  spent\nsearching  for  and  using  energy  alternatives  for  more  productive  activities.  This  will  have\nsignificant impacts on vulnerable groups, particularly women and children.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n108. Risks affecting the Project may be divided into two broad categories. Short- to medium-\nterm  risks  are  associated  with  implementation  and  the  achievement  of  immediate  output.  The\nlong-term strategic risks relate to the overall impact and sustainability of improvements brought\nabout  by  the  Project.  The  former  risks  are  related  to  availability  of  local  funds,  timeliness  in\nproject implementation, and adequate project management. The Government has assured ADB\nthat the Project is given top priority for the economic development of Tajikistan, the necessary\nfunds  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner,  and  adequate  measures  will  be  taken  to\nimprove Barki Tajik\u2019s financial situation. Given that this is ADB\u2019s first power project in Tajikistan,\nproblems could be encountered in its implementation because of Barki Tajik's unfamiliarity  with\npolicies and practices of multilateral financing institutions. This risk will be mitigated through the\nprovision  of  (i)  adequate  and  continued  implementation  consulting  services;  (ii)  an  adequate\ntime  period  to  complete  the  Project,  taking  into  account  ADB's  experience  in  other  transition\neconomies; and (iii) regular training by ADB and the project implementation consultants for PIU\nand  Barki  Tajik  staff  in  matters  related  to  procurement,  project  management,  social  and\nenvironmental \nloan  disbursement.  Adequate  project\nmanagement will also be ensured through ADB approval for key positions in the PIU.\n\nissues,  benefit  monitoring,  and \n\n109.\nIn the long term, the risks associated with the sustainability of project benefits are related\nto  (i)  the  political  stability  in  Tajikistan,  (ii)  the  Government's  commitment  to  energy  sector\nreform and periodic electricity tariff increases, (iii) Barki Tajik's financial position, (iv) adequate\nmaintenance  of  project  facilities,  and  (v)  the  provision  of  an  adequate  safety  net  for  poor  and\nvulnerable  groups  against  tariff  increases.  The  political  situation  in  Tajikistan  is  improving  as\nevidenced by the reduced need for UN peace-keeping efforts in future.44 Under the PCIPL, the\nGovernment is committed to reform the energy sector by (i) developing a legal and regulatory\nframework  for  efficient  energy  sector  operations,  (ii)  increasing  the  level  of  electricity  tariffs\ntoward  full  cost  recovery,  (iii)  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  the  generation  and\ndistribution  of  power,  and  (iv)  promoting  energy  conservation.  While  progress  in  these  areas\nslowed  recently  partly  due  to  the  poor  economic  situation  in  the  country  and  the  general\nelections,  the  Government  nevertheless  remains  committed  to  the  reform  program  and  has\n\n                  \n\n44 After independence in 1991, Tajikistan suffered a five-year civil war. A peace agreement, signed in 1997, provided\nthe  basis  for  national  reconciliation  and  established  a  framework  for  holding  parliamentary  elections.  Despite\noccasional disruptions, the peace process made significant progress in 1998 and 1999. Tajikistan\u2019s President was\nre-elected in November 1999. Holding parliamentary elections, which were completed in March 2000 as scheduled,\nconcluded  the  peace  process.  The  UN  Security  Council  withdrew  its  observers  from  Tajikistan  in  May  2000  and\nopened a small office in Dushanbe to support the country\u2019s stability.\n\n\f32\n\nagreed to continue the reform agenda through adoption of the ESAP, with emphasis on full cost\nrecovery for electricity supply  and  restructuring of Barki Tajik to improve its accountability and\nfinancial  viability.  To  verify  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  performance  in  meeting  financial  covenants  set  under\nthe  Project,  consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  audit  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  corporate  and  project\naccounts  for  2000  and  2001  in  accordance  with  IAS.  In  conjunction  with  the  Project,  two  TAs\n(paras.  95-97)  will  help  Barki  Tajik  improve  its  billing  and  collection  system  to  reduce  its\naccounts  receivable,  and  to  introduce  IAS  at  Barki  Tajik  to  make  its  corporate  accounts\ncompatible with international practices. With regard to maintenance, the proper maintenance of\nproject facilities is essential for the sustainability of project benefits. The Government and Barki\nTajik have agreed to implement recommendations of implementation consultants and to provide\nfor  adequate  funds  annually  for  O&M.  The  Government  also  places  priority  on  protecting  the\npoor  and  vulnerable  groups  from  the  impact  of  tariff  increases,  and  in  that  regard  the\nGovernment  agreed  to  maintain  the  lifeline  tariff  structure  in  the  medium  term  and  to  use  the\ninterest margin arising from onlent funds to Barki Tajik to fund the subsidy for the lifeline tariff.\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nThe  Government  and  Barki  Tajik  provided  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the\n\n110.\nstandard assurances, which will be incorporated

Figures for\n1997-1999 are based on actual operations while those for 2000-2010 are projections based on\nnotes and assumptions described below.\n\nA. \n\nPrices, Inflation, and Exchange Rate\n\n2.     Since the country\u2019s independence, the Tajik ruble has continually devalued against the\nUS  dollar.  The  exchange  rate  per  US  dollar  decreased  from  TJR50  in  1995  to  TJR2,000  in\n2000,  a  depreciation  of  97  percent  in  five  years.  Year-to-year  inflation  was  170  percent  in\nSeptember 1997; this fell to 2.7 percent by December 1998, but rose to 64 percent by August\n1999.  The  medium-term  and  long-term  stability  of  both  local  inflation  and  the  Tajik  ruble\nexchange rate has not yet been established. The financial projections have been carried out in\ncurrent  dollar  equivalents  considering  the  difficulty  projecting  prices  of  goods  and  services  in\nTajik ruble. Prices in dollar terms are assumed to increase in accordance with the international\ninflation rate, estimated at 2.4 percent per year throughout the projection period.\n\nB. \n\nIncome Statement\n\n3.     Revenues.  Electricity  sales  are  estimated  to  grow  at  2  percent  per  year  during  2000-\n2002 and at an average of 3.2 percent during 2003-2004. With full realization of the benefits of\nthe  Project,  sales  are  expected  to  grow  by  an  average  of  5.3  percent  annually  during  2005-\n2015.  The  forecast  increase  in  sales  growth  is  lower  than  the  actual  growth  in  1997-1999\nconsidering  that  Barki  Tajik's  generation  capacity  is  limited  by  the  poor  operating  condition  of\nthe power plants. The average tariff as of August 2000 amounts to $0.0045/kilowatt-hour (kWh).\nTo achieve financial cost recovery and a return of 6 percent on net fixed assets by 2005, it is\nassumed that the average revenue will be increased by 25 percent annually during 2001-2005.\n\n4.     Operating Expenses. Fuel consumption is based on the requirements of the generating\nunits.  Fuel  used  in  the  Dushanbe  Thermal  Power  Plant  is  imported  from  Uzbekistan  at  about\n$50-55 per thousand cubic meters. Annual operating and maintenance expenses are estimated\nat 1.0 percent of gross fixed assets. Annual depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis at\n2.5 percent of revalued gross fixed assets.\n\nInterest and Taxes. Interest expenses on long-term debt are calculated on the indicated\n\n5.    \nterms and conditions on committed loans. Taxable income is subject to 30 percent income tax.\n\nC. \n\nBalance Sheet\n\n6.    \nFixed Assets. The fixed assets have been significantly undervalued in previous years. It\nis assumed that the assets will be revalued in 2000 with an estimated gross replacement value\nof $3.75 billion and an accumulated depreciation of $2.5 billion.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\n7.     Accounts Receivable. It is expected that accounts receivable will amount to six months\ngross sales by 2001 and further improve to three months gross sales by 2002. Provision for bad\ndebts is made annually for 10 percent of the previous year\u2019s outstanding accounts receivable.\n\nLong-Term  Debt.  Long-term  debts  take  into  account  the  financing  required  for  the\n8.    \nProject and the capital investment program of Barki Tajik. Financial conditions for the additional\nloans are assumed to be similar to those for project loans.\n\nD. \n\nCash Flow Statement\n\n9.     Capital  Investment  Program.  The  medium-term  capital  investment  plan  is  based  on\nBarki Tajik\u2019s indicated rehabilitation projects planned for the period 2001-2005.\n\n10.     Dividends.  It  is  assumed  that  dividends  will  be  declared  whenever  the  year-end  cash\nbalance exceeds minimum cash balance operating requirements.\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 7, page 3\n\nTable A7.1:  Income

consultants  as  a\npart  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)1  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The\nsummary IEE report covers the environmental aspects of the proposed Project. The Project has\nfive parts and it covers mainly central and southern regions including Dushanbe, the capital of\nthe country. ADB fact-finding and appraisal missions visited the sites and held discussions with\ngovernment  agencies,  local  government  representatives,  district  officers,  Barki  Tajik  (the  state\npower company) representatives, and local residents during 10 to 25 April and 14 to 29 August\n2000.  ADB  classified  the  Project  as  environmental  category  B.  Barki  Tajik,  the  Executing\nAgency,  prepared  the  summary  IEE  for  the  Project  with  the  inputs  from  IEE,  TA  consultants,\nand ADB Missions.\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\n2.\nThe  aim  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  power  supply  to  end  users  in  Tajikistan.  As  a\nconsequence of the break-up of the Soviet Union and the civil war from 1992 to 1996, much of\nthe  electricity  installations  were  destroyed  or  damaged  in  the  country.  The  heavily  degraded\nelectricity  transmission  and  distribution  systems  are  not  capable  of  providing  adequate\nelectricity supply to the end users, particularly poor and rural households.\n\n3.\nThe  Project  comprises  five  parts.  Part  A  consists  of  improving  the  power  supply  in\nKhatlon  Region,  the  region  south  of  the  country.  In  addition  to  the  general  degradation  of  the\ntransmission,  distribution,  and  supply  network  due  to  minimal  maintenance  over  the  last  10\nyears,  the  electricity  supply  network  in  this  region  has  suffered  considerably  from  the\nconsequences  of  the  civil  war.  This  component  of  the  Project  will  improve  power  supply  to  a\nlarge number of households, mainly civil war returnee villages. One specific component consists\nof rehabilitating the Sovhoz 2 substation, in the Bishkent District. The rehabilitation will provide\nelectricity to a drainage pumping station that in the past provided drainage for 2,500 hectares of\nland, giving employment to 10,000 people. Because of the lack of reliable electricity supply, the\nland is heavily waterlogged and certain areas are flooded and cannot be cultivated. Well water\nhas become saline, requiring villagers to collect drinking water from the river. Part B comprises\nrehabilitation measures at Nurek Hydropower Plant (NHPP), the most important power plant in\nTajikistan.  Part  B  consists  of    (i)  improvement  measures  at  the  220  kilovolt  (kV)  switchyard;\n(ii)  improvement  of  the  NHPP  tailrace;  (iii)  NHPP  dam  monitoring;  and  (iv)  improvement  of\nRegar  500  kV  and  220  kV  substations,  through  which  a  significant  portion  of  the  electricity\nsupplied  in  Dushanbe  region  is  delivered,  together  with  the  main  export-import  to  Uzbekistan\nand  the  Central  Asia  grid.  Part  C  comprises  rehabilitation  of  two  220/110  kV  substations  at\nNovaya  and  Djangal,  by  repairing  and  partially  replacing  electromechanical  equipment.  These\ntwo substations are main supply points for Dushanbe region, with about 1 million people. Part D\nwill provide funds for about 500 high voltage electronic meters to be installed at power stations\nand high voltage substations to measure exported and imported energy, generated and sent-out\nenergy,  and  the  energy  exchanged  between  each  of  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  regional  distribution\norganizations. Project implementation consulting services are provided under Part E.\n\n1 TA 3207-TAJ: Power Sector Development Project, for $840,000, approved on 17 June 1999.\n\n                  \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Resources\n\nTajikistan  is  characterized  by  a  strongly  continental  climate  with  hot,  dry  summers  and\n4.\ncold  winters,  especially  in  mountainous  areas.  Daily  temperature  fluctuations  are  usually  quite\nlarge.  The  cold  winters  make  heating  a  necessity  for  winter  months  in  the  whole  country.\nApproximately 97 percent of the country is mountainous, and almost half of it is at altitudes of\nmore than 3,000 meters above sea level. The few flat areas available are intensively used for\nagriculture, which is done almost exclusively under irrigation. For this reason, the considerable\nwater resources of the country, stemming from the high mountain areas, are important for power\ngeneration as well as for irrigation. A large proportion of the irrigated areas lies in Khatlon, the\nregion where power supply will be improved by the Project.\n\n2.\n\nBiological Resources\n\nThe project area consists mainly of two parts: (i) the immediate surroundings of NHPP,\n5.\nand  (ii)  the  inhabited  areas  of  the  whole  of  Khatlon  Region.  Both  these  areas  are  intensively\nused  and  occupied  by  human  activities.  These  areas  have  no  rare  or  endangered  species  of\nwildlife or plants, and the Project will not have any negative effects on biological resources.\n\n6.\nThe construction of the NHPP dam undoubtedly affected its environment, especially the\nriver  ecosystem.  However,  the  present  Project  will  not  influence  or  change  the  impacts  of  the\nexisting dam. Information about the situation before the dam was built in 1962 is not available.\nForests are a very rare resource in Tajikistan; only about 2.3 percent of the country is currently\ncovered  with  forests.  The  reduction  of  fuel  imports,  particularly  gas  from  Uzbekistan  and  coal\nfrom Russia, has led to an increase in pressure on forests.\n\n3.\n\nHuman and Economic Development\n\n7.\nStudies,  including  surveys  made  by  the  TA  consultants,  uniformly  show  a  population\nwhich  that  is  largely  (83  percent)  below  the  poverty  line.  In  some  of  the  districts  that  will  be\nserved by the Project, more than half of the population left their homes during the civil war for\nother countries. Most have returned, but face a difficult situation, because many of their houses\nhave been destroyed. Electricity supply is unreliable due to damaged and deficient installations,\nand  often  dangerous  because  of  makeshift  electricity  connections.  The  Project  (Part  A)  will\nimprove this situation.\n\n8.\nAgriculture, mainly under irrigation, is the most important economic activity, and cotton is\nthe  most  important  product.  Since  much  of  the  irrigation  requires  electric  pumps,  the\nimprovement  of  electricity  supply  will  contribute  to  an  improvement  in  the  general  economic\ndevelopment  or  rehabilitation  of  the  area.  The  Project  will  involve  rehabilitating  the  Sovhoz  2\nsubstation.\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nPotential Environmental Impacts\n\nThe  Project  consists  of  rehabilitating  existing  structures.  The  rehabilitation  will  be\n9.\nimplemented  by  small-scale,  decentralized  works  (e.g.,  at  all  substations  to  be  improved);  no\nlarge construction site will be operated for project implementation. After completion, the Project\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 8, page 3\n\nwill not have any undesirable environmental impacts. All potential impacts would happen during\nconstruction.\n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\n(iii) \n \n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\nAir  pollution  and  noise  will  result  from  trucks  carrying  materials,  and  from\nmachinery  (especially  for  the  excavation  at  NHPP  tailrace).  However,  due  to  the\nsmall  size  of  the  works,  their  limited  duration,  the  low  amount  of  materials  to  be\ntransported,  and  NHPP's  site  being  in  low  populated  areas,  no  impact  requiring\nspecific mitigation measures will occur.\n\nAn estimated 0.5 to 1.0 million cubic meters of material will have to be excavated\nand  dumped  from  the  NHPP  tailrace.  The  material  to  be  excavated  does  not\npresent any environmental risk and consists of rocks and sediments. The material\nwill  be  dumped  in  an  area  of  about  7 hectares  that  is  unlevel,  uncultivated,\nuninhabited,  and  is  close  to  the  construction  site.  This  land  belongs  to  the  local\ngovernment  and  Barki  Tajik  has  obtained  the  government's  authorization  to  use\nthe  excavated  material  to  fill  the  uneven  pockets.  Such  highly  eroded  land  will\nbenefit from the filling with the fertile soil dredged from the tailrace. After levelling,\nsome form of natural tree cover may develop as a consequence.\n\nSome of the electromechanical equipment in all substations and switchyards to be\nimproved  will  have  to  be  replaced,  as  they  are  worn  out  or  obsolete,  with  spare\nparts no longer being available. About 500 tons of transformer oil will be replaced.\nThe  Government  confirmed  that  no  poly-chlorine-biphenyl  is  included  in  the  oil,\nand that the removed oil will be filtered and sold or reused as fuel oil.\n\n10.\n\nThe Project will have substantial environmental benefits.\n\nExcavating the tailrace channel at NHPP will increase the production of energy by\n320 gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  per  year.  This  amount  of  energy  is  equivalent  to  the\nelectricity  generated  annually  by  a  40  megawatt  (MW)  coal  fired  power  plant,\nwhich would introduce a large amount of air pollution and carbon emission.\n\nLarge  sinkholes  have  opened  in  the  NHPP  switchyard,  and  could  result  in  the\ncollapse  and  dislocation  of  one  or  more  transformers.  A  rupture  of  these\ntransformers could lead to an oil spill that could contaminate the Vaksh River. This\nriver is a main source of irrigation water, and such pollution would adversely affect\nthe irrigation systems. The Project will eliminate this risk.\n\n(iii)  NHPP's  dam  must  be  properly  monitored  to  ensure  the  safety  of  downstream\n\n \n\ncommunities.\n\n(iv) \n \n\nImproving  electricity  supply  to  the  Khatlon  Region  population  will  not  directly  and\nfully  replace  use  of  other  forms  of  energy,  but  will  reduce  pressure  on  other\nresources, mainly on fuelwood used for cooking. Reduced pressure on the scarce\nremaining forest cover will be an additional environmental benefit of the Project.\n\n2.\n\nMitigation Measures\n\nThe  most  important  environmental  mitigation  measure  in  relation  to  the  Project  will  be\n11.\nproper  disposal  of  discarded  material,  especially  transformer  oil  that  has  to  be  replaced.\nContractors  will  be  required  to  filter  and  sell  or  reuse  the  remaining  transformer  oil  as  fuel  oil.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 8, page 4\n\nOther material, which cannot be recycled, will be deposited in controlled waste deposit sites and\nBarki Tajik agreed to take such steps during project implementation.\n\n12.\nDuring  construction  at  any  site,  care  will  have  to  be  taken  to  prevent  contamination  of\nsoil and water with fuel and lubricants. This can be done through storage of such substances (if\nany) in suitable containers away from water, preferably on an impermeable surface to prevent\noil  from  leaching  into  the  ground,  and  by  proper  maintenance  of  machines  and  trucks.  These\nare  normal  engineering  procedures  and  detailed  steps  will  be  included  in  contract  and  bid\ndocuments.  Barki  Tajik  will  assure  periodic  site  monitoring  and  supervision  in  order  to  ensure\ncompliance.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n13.\nEnvironmental  impact  assessments  and  environmental  monitoring  in  Tajikistan  is  the\nresponsibility of the Ministry of Environment (MOEN). MOEN has the human resources required\nto carry out its obligations, but lacks funding, which makes it difficult for staff to carry out these\nobligations.\n\n14.\nBarki Tajik has a small environmental unit and, given the importance of the relationship\nbetween energy and the environment and the pipeline of other energy projects in the country in\nfuture, Barki Tajik agreed to form an environmental and social monitoring unit to support project\nimplementation  activities.  Two  person-months  of  international  and  four  person-months  of\ndomestic  consultant  services  will  be  provided  under  the  Project  to  ensure  all  environmental\nmitigation  and  monitoring  activities  will  be  carried  as  specified  in  the  IEE.  The  people\nresponsible for this unit will also be trained in environmental and social monitoring activities. The\nproject implementation unit (PIU) will carry out proposed mitigation and monitoring measures on\nbehalf of Barki Tajik. MOEN will continue its supervisory and advisory functions.\n\nEnvironmental  monitoring  for  the  Project  includes  baseline  surveys,  periodic  visits,\n15.\nmonitoring and supervision of construction sites for contractors' compliance with regulations and\nassurance for proper disposal of waste material. The PIU, with support from the environmental\nand social monitoring unit within Barki Tajik, will keep MOEN and ADB informed about progress\nof environmental monitoring, and will submit review reports every six months.\n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\nThe  Project  will  improve  power  supply  in  Tajikistan  (through  improvements  made  at\n16.\nNHPP) particularly in the south of the country by improving distribution and transmission in 13\ndistricts of Khatlon Region. Adverse environmental impacts of the Project will be very small, and\nwill be limited  to the construction period. The most important measures to be taken consist of\nproper  disposal  of  discarded  material  (replaced  transformers  and  exchanged  transformer  oil).\nAdverse impacts can be mitigated through standard engineering and good construction and civil\nworks  procedures.  No  negative  environmental  impact  will  persist  during  the  operation  phase.\nThe Project will not involve resettlement or significant land acquisition.\n\n17.\nThe  Project  will  have  considerable  environmental  benefits,  mainly  through  (i)  reducing\nlosses  in  energy  production  at  NHPP;  (ii)  eliminating  the  risk  of  transformer  oil  polluting  the\nVaksh River at NHPP; (iii) improving the safety of NHPP's dam; (iv) reducing electricity losses in\nthe  distribution system in Khatlon Region, and (v) reducing pressure on alternative sources of\nenergy,  mainly  forest  resources.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  have  considerable  social  benefits\nthrough improving energy supply and thereby general living conditions of the population. In the\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 8, page 5\n\nproject area, improved drinking water supplies; better heating for rural schools, hospitals, clinics,\nand other public facilities; and induced agricultural and income generating activities will improve\nthe social welfare significantly. Since all identified adverse environmental impacts are minor and\ncan  be  mitigated  through  standard  engineering  and  civil  works  practices,  a  detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment is not needed for the Project.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 9, page 1\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\nAn initial social assessment (ISA) was undertaken by consultants as part of the technical\nassistance  (TA)1  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  summary  ISA  covers\nsocial  aspects  of  the  Project.  The  Project  has  five  parts  covering  the  central  and  southern\nregions of Tajikistan. ADB fact-finding and appraisal missions visited the project area and held\ndiscussions with government agencies, local government representatives, district officers, Barki\nTajik  (the  state  power  company)  representatives,  and  local  residents  from  10  to  25  April  and\n14 to 29 August 2000. The summary ISA was prepared by Barki Tajik, the Executing Agency for\nthe Project, with inputs from consultants and ADB staff.\n\nB.\n\n2.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\nThe Project consists of five parts (main text, paras. 51-63).\n\nPresent Living Conditions of the Population\n\nThe  population  of  Tajikistan  was  6.13  million  in  early  2000  and  is  anticipated  to  reach\n3.\n11 million  in  2025.  The  population  is  highly  concentrated  in  the  lower  lying  areas  with  fertile\nland,  while  mountainous  areas  are  thinly  populated.  The  1997  gross  domestic  product  per\ncapita  was  $178,  about  33  percent  of  its  level  prior  to  independence.  Tajikistan\u2019s  human\ndevelopment index decreased from 0.63 in 1991 to 0.54 in 1998, with the country ranked 108\nout  of  174 countries  surveyed.  Tajikistan  has  a  high  level  of  poverty.  Official  data  shows  that\nalthough  the  nominal  average  monthly  wages,  minimum  wages,  and  minimum  pension  have\nbeen  increasing  relative  to  1995  levels,  they  are  still  lower  than  1992  levels,  and  more\nimportantly, are significantly lower than the minimum consumption basket. Average monthly per\ncapita  income  is  only  25.9  percent  of  the  1998  minimum  consumption  basket,  and  average\nmonthly  wages,  38.9  percent.  Legislated  minimum  wages  and  minimum  pensions  constitute\nonly 8.5 percent of the 1998 minimum consumption basket.\n\n4.\nInitial social examinations confirm the high levels of poverty, particularly in rural areas. In\nFebruary 2000 the State Statistical Agency estimated that 83 percent of the total population is\npoor, if monthly expenditure of TJR20,000 was used as the poverty line. Formal employment is\nlow, and where available, consists mostly of civil service employment, where salaries are often\nseveral months in arrears. Collective farms offer seasonal employment with wages of TJR2,000\nper  month  in  spring  and  TJR10,000  during  summer.  Households  supplement  their  incomes\nthrough home plots, animal husbandry, and small-scale retail. In most households visited, these\nconstituted  the  main  source  of  income.  In  some  areas  households  have  been  provided\nhumanitarian  aid  by  donor  agencies  through  the  local  government,  consisting  of  5  liters  of\ncooking oil and/or 10 kilos of flour supplied every 3-6 months. Most income is received during\nsummer  and  fall,  coinciding  with  harvests,  but  most  expenses  are  incurred  during  winter  and\nspring, mainly for heating and clothing.\n\n1 TA No. 3207-TAJ: Power Sector Development Project, for $840,000, approved on 17 June 1999.\n\n                  \n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nD.\n\nSocial Position of Women\n\n5.\nThe  relative  position  of  women  has  deteriorated  based  on  the  United  Nations\nDevelopment  Programme's  gender-related  development  index,  which  fell  from  0.571  to  0.534\nfrom  1995  to  1998.  Women  are  more  likely  to  be  unemployed  than  men,  with  their\nunemployment  rates  at  28.8  and  25.3  percent,  respectively.2  Women\u2019s  wages  average  $2  per\nmonth; men\u2019s wages are $6 per month. Women bear most, if not all of the burden of work within\nthe household and spend an average of 6.3 hours per day of unpaid work (cooking, working on\nprivate  plots,  cleaning,  laundry,  collecting  fuelwood  and  biomass,  etc.)  compared  to  3.3  hours\nby men.\n\n6.\nThe  project  area  includes  Khatlon  Region,  consisting  of  13  districts.  The  whole  region\nhas been severely affected by war, which damaged infrastructure and forced a large proportion\nof  the  population  to  leave  their  homes.  Most  of  the  refugees  have  returned,  and  are  facing\ndifficult  conditions  as  most  of  their  houses  have  been  destroyed.  The  war  left  an  estimated\n26,000  widows  and  55,000  orphans,  and  their  position  is  worse  than  that  of  the  rest  of  the\npeople.\n\nE.\n\nScreening of Potential Impacts of the Project\n\nField visits supported the view that provision of electricity will have a substantial impact\n7.\non  the  alleviation  of  poverty.  Aside  from  high  economic  costs  of  using  alternative  fuel,  time,\nlabor,  health,  social,  and  gender  impacts  are  associated  with  scarcity  of  electricity.  Fuelwood\nand agricultural biomass gathering takes 15 days for a month\u2019s supply. Cow dung briquettes are\nmade  one  hour  of  each  day  in  summer,  to  generate  the  required  supply  for  winter.  These\nenergy sources are primarily gathered and prepared by women and children. The use of these\nenergy  sources  typically  for  cooking  in  unventilated  rooms  constitutes  a  health  hazard  for\nwomen and children, who spend approximately five hours per day in these cooking rooms. Safe\nwater  is  unavailable  partly  because  of  lack  of  electricity,  and  pumping  from  reservoirs  and\ndeepwells  is  restricted.  The  alternatives  for  securing  water  and  storage  are  both  time\nconsuming, and often result in contaminated water.\n\nThe  collective  farm  Sovhoz  2  in  the  Bishkent  District  is  of  particular  importance  as  it\n8.\nprovides  employment  to  10,000  people.  Due  to  lack  of  electricity  supply  to  the  drainage\npumping  station,  the  land  cannot  be  drained  adequately  for  cultivation,  and  2,500 hectares  of\nland  is  now  under  saline  water.  Rehabilitation  of  the  associated  substation  (under  Part  A)  will\nprovide power to the pumping station.\n\n9.\nMetering  will  be  an  important  aspect  of  encouraging  energy  conservation  and  will\nprovide  for  a  fair  system  of  billing  based  on  consumption.  Where  there  are  no  meters,\nhouseholds  do  not  practice  energy  conservation  because  electricity  tariffs  are  based  on  the\nnumber  of  rooms  per  household.  Although  many  households  have  arrears  for  their  electricity\nbills,  during  focus  group  discussions,  they  indicated  a  willingness  to  pay  up  to  double  the\nexisting rates for reliable electricity supply.\n\n2  Falkingham, 1999. Women and Gender Relations in Tajikistan, London School of Economics, London.\n\n                  \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n10.\nThe Project will not have any adverse or undesirable social impacts. No resettlement is\nrequired,  and  the  Project  will  not  affect  productive  land  or  any  other  assets  of  the  population.\nThe  Project  will  directly  improve  electricity  supply  to  a  large  number  of  villages,  with  a  high\npercentage of returnee population. In addition, the Project will have considerable social benefits\nthrough  improving  the  general  living  conditions  of  the  population.  Such  benefits  include\nimproved  drinking  water  supplies;  better  heating  for  rural  schools,  hospitals,  clinics,  and  other\npublic facilities; improved drainage and control of malaria; increased agricultural production; and\ninduced income generating activities, that will improve the social welfare significantly. Therefore,\nthe Project will contribute in a substantial way to poverty reduction.\n\nBecause  83  percent  of  the  population  live  below  the  national  poverty  line,  lifeline  tariff\n11.\nsupport  is  essential  to  subsidize  electricity  payments  of  the  poor.  The  lifeline  tariff  system\nprovides  150  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  of  electricity  to  the  poor  without  any  real  increase  of  price.\nOther  options  to  maximize  social  impacts  of  the  Project  include  awareness  building  in  energy\nuse,  safety,  and  energy  conservation.    The  Government  has  agreed  to  undertake  a  public\nawareness  program  to  educate  the  public  on  the  need  for  a  rational  tariff  scheme  and  the\nimportance  of  energy  conservation.  In  the  future,  Barki  Tajik  will  promote  integrated  energy\ndevelopment programs with community participation and social mobilization, with emphasis on\ncleaner  and  alternative  energy  sources.  Current  community  structures  are  conducive  to\ncommunity  participation  and  social  mobilization  in  matters  related  to  electricity  provision,  such\nas  household  safety  in  use  of  electricity,  tree  planting  for  fuelwood,  and  use  of  alternative\nsources of fuel.\n\n12.\nDuring the policy dialogue, Barki Tajik agreed to establish an environmental and social\nimpact  monitoring  unit  to  work  very  closely  with  the  project  implementation  unit.  This  unit  will\nalso  carry  out  regular  project  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  including  annual\nreview reports. Barki Tajik agreed to provide the unit with adequate equipment, office supplies,\ntraining  facilities,  and  staff  resources  throughout  the  project  implementation  period.  Under  the\nProject,  two  person-months  of  international  and  four  person-months  of  domestic  consultants\nwith  expertise  in  social  impact  monitoring  will  be  provided  with  the  project  implementation\nconsulting services.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT\n\nThe  Project  was  analyzed  for  its  financial  viability  from  the  perspective  of  Barki  Tajik\n\n1.\nbased on the following notes and assumptions:\n\nThe Project will have a construction period of 5 years and an economic life of 10\nyears.\n\nThe  project  cost, \ncontingencies and interest during construction, is $52.9 million.\n\nincluding  physical  contingencies  but  excluding  price\n\n(iii) \n \n\nRevenues and costs are presented in constant 2000 prices.\n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\n(iv) \n \n\nBenefits in terms of additional electricity consumed on with-project and without-\nproject scenarios1 are valued at the projected tariffs of Barki Tajik. Benefits for\npart  A:  rehabilitation  and  power  supply  improvement  in  poor  areas  of  Khatlon\nRegion,  include  (a)  additional  energy  to  returnee  villages,  (b)  loss  reduction  in\nreturnee  villages,  (c)  additional  supply  due  to  rehabilitation  of  the  Sovhoz  2\nsubstation, (d) additional supply due to the rehabilitation of the southern region\ntransmission  lines,  and  (e)  additional  supply  due  to  the  rehabilitation  of  the\nCentral  Hydropower  Plant.  Benefits  from  part  B:  rehabilitation  of  Nurek\nHydropower  Plant  and  associated \nfacilities,  and  part  C:\nimprovement  of  power  supply  reliability  in  Dushanbe  region  include  increased\nelectricity supply.\n\ntransmission \n\n(v) \n \n\nAnnual  operating  and  maintenance  costs  are  estimated  at  1  percent  of  gross\ncapital expenditures.\n\n(vi) \n \n\nIncremental taxable income is subject to 30 percent income tax.\n\n(vii) \n \n\nThe benefits for part E: consulting services have not been computed as they are\ndifficult to disaggregate and conservatively have been assumed to be zero.\n\n2.\n\nThe financial internal rate of return of the overall Project is 7.73% (Table A10).\n\n                                            \n1 This approach to valuation of benefits is conservative. If a comprehensive comparison were made between 'with\nproject' and 'without project' situations, larger benefits would result, particularly given the likely rapid deterioration of\nthe system in the 'without project' situation.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nTable A10:  Financial Analysis of the Project\n\nItem\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2015\n\nBenefits, Additional Electricity (GWh)\nPart A: Rehabilitation and Power Supply\n\n  Improvement in Poor Areas of Khatlon Region\nReturnee Villages, Additional Energy\nReturnee Villages, Loss Reduction\nSovhoz 2 Substation Rehabilitation\nSouthern Districts Transmission Rehabilitation\nCentral Hydropower Plant\nTelecommunications Systems\n\nSubtotal, Part A\n\nPart B: Rehabilitation of Nurek Hydropower\n\n      Plant and Associated Transmission\nSwitchyard Foundations\nSwitches and Protection\nDredging of Tailrace Channel\n\nSubtotal, Part B\n\nPart C: Improvement of Power Supply\n\n      Reliability in Dushanbe Region\nAdditional Energy due to Switchgear\nReduced Losses due to Transformers\nForegone Investment\nSubtotal, Part C\n\nPart D: Bulk Metering of Power Supply\n\nBilling Inaccuracies\nSubtotal, Part D\n\nTotal Project\n\nAverage Electricity Tariff\n\n(US\u00a2/kWh, constant 2000 prices)\n\nCash Flow Analysis ($ million)\n\n3.6\n\n4.3\n5.1\n\n3.6\n5.1\n\n25.2 29.2 33.6 38.0 42.2 46.1 53.0\n7.2 10.1\n5.1\n6.1\n5.1\n5.1\n5.1\n5.1\n42.8 42.8 42.8 42.8 42.8\n24.0 24.0 26.0 27.0 28.0 30.0\n20.0 20.4 20.8 21.2 21.6 22.5\n28.8 81.9 130.2 137.8 144.4 150.9 163.6\n\n12.0 14.0 16.0 18.0 20.0 24.0\n24.0 22.0 24.0 25.0 26.0 29.0\n160.0 320.0 320.0 320.0 320.0 320.0\n0.0 196.0 356.0 360.0 363.0 366.0 373.0\n\n3.8\n1.3\n\n30\n2\n\n6\n1.5\n\n10\n1.7\n\n200\n2.7\n1.8\n7.5 11.7 32.0 62.2 204.5\n\n60\n2.2\n\n0.0\n\n5.1\n\n3\n3.0\n\n3.1\n3.1\n\n3.1\n3.1\n\n3.2\n3.2\n\n3.2\n3.2\n\n3.4\n3.4\n\n0.0\n\n28.8 286.0 496.8 512.6 542.6 582.3 744.5\n\n0.814 0.993 1.115 1.198 1.287 1.382 2.279\n\nCash Inflow\nTotal\n\nCash Outflow\n\nCapital Cost\nOperating Cost\nIncome Tax\nTotal\n\nNet Cash Flow\n\n0.23 2.84 5.54 6.14 6.98 8.05 16.97\n\n2.00 17.73 21.68 7.82 3.07\n\n0.39 0.47 0.49 0.49 0.49 0.49 0.49\n0.00 0.00 0.73 0.91 1.16 1.48 4.16\n2.00 17.73 22.07 8.29 4.30 1.40 1.65 1.97 4.65\n-2.00 -17.73 -21.84 -5.45 1.25 4.74 5.33 6.07 12.32\n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR)\n\n7.73%\n\nSource:  Staff estimates.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Project comprises five parts (main text, paras. 51-63). The project components are\n1.\npart  of  the  least-cost  energy  development  plan  for  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  generate\nincremental  energy,  improve  reliability  of  power  supply,  and  avoid  energy  losses,  thus\ncontributing  to  poverty  reduction,  social  mobilization,  and  improvement  of  well  being  of  the\npeople. Basic information about the Project and its benefits are summarized in Table A11.1.\n\nTable A11.1: Project Components and Benefits\n\nItem\nEconomic Capital Cost (discounted)\nIncremental Energy\nHouseholds Served Directly\n\nUnit\n $ million\n\n  GWh\n\nNumber\n\nPart A\n13.08\n1,813\n24,481\n\nPart B\n14.37\n4,249\n-\n\nPart C\n7.63\n1,470\n  148,265\n\nPart D\n0.67\n39\n-\n\nProject\n35.75\n7,571\n  172,746\n\n - = not applicable\n Source:  Staff estimates.\n\nB.\n\nAssumptions\n\nFor  all  components,  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios  were  compared\n\n2.\nbased on the following assumptions:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nData  for  capital  and  operating  costs  were  taken  from  the  financial  analysis  and\nadjusted  to  reflect  economic  values.  In  calculating  economic  capital  costs,  all\nduties, taxes, and subsidies were excluded.\n\nA  10-year1  operational  economic  life  was  assumed  for  the  Project  (total  of  15\nyears  including  construction  period).  The  physical  contingency  factor  was\nassumed at 10 percent of capital costs.\n\nAll tradable commodities were valued at border prices at the prevailing exchange\nrate  (TJR2,000  =  $1).  Nontradable  commodities  were  valued  at  shadow  price\nusing a standard conversion factor of 0.9.\n\nThe  generated  energy  is  comprised  of  two  components:  incremental  and\nnonincremental.  The  incremental  component  was  valued  at  willingness-to-pay\n(WTP)  TJR90.1/kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  ($0.0450/kWh)  and  the  nonincremental\ncomponent  valued  at  resource  cost  savings  of  TJR64.8/kWh  ($0.0324/kWh).\nBoth of these values have been conservatively estimated.\n\n(v) \n\nSimilar to the other Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects, WTP for electricity\nwas estimated using the value of the most likely or next best alternative available\nfor electricity consumers. The weighted average value of different electricity user\n\n                  \n\n1  Since  the  Project  does  not  involve  complete  rehabilitation  of  all  components,  a  10-year  period  for  operation  has\nbeen assumed on a conservative basis. Such an approach has been adopted on similar projects in other transition\neconomies, such as Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\ncategories  such  as  industry,  households,  and  agriculture  was  used  as  the  final\nfigure of WTP (paras. 9 and 10).\n\n(vi) \n\nThe  value  of  complementary  investments  made  by  some  households  for  such\nitems  as  bulbs,  heaters,  and  stoves  and  the  cost  of  connection  to  the  system\nwere not included in the project cost.\n\nC.\n\nPart A\n\n3.\nPart A consists of rehabilitation and power supply improvement to poor areas in Khatlon\nRegion.  It  comprises  improvement  of  the  power  supply,  strengthening  of  transmission  and\ndistribution networks, provision of consumer metering, and improvement of living conditions of\nabout 24,800 households.\n\n4.\nThe  major  economic  benefits  of  the  component  are  an  improvement  in  the  Central\nHydropower Plant (15 megawatts), rehabilitation of about 100 villages in 13 districts of Khatlon\nRegion,  rehabilitation  of  district  transmission  and  distribution  system,  and  installation  of\nconsumer meters. The component\u2019s benefits include (i) avoided energy losses, (ii) reduction in\ntechnical  and  other  energy  losses,  (iii)  increased  energy  sales  due  to  improved  voltage  and\nmore  reliable  electricity  supply,  (iv)  savings  in  costs  of  operation  and  maintenance,  and  (iv)\nenhancement of well-being of households living in these villages.\n\nD.\n\nPart B\n\nE. \n\nPart C\n\nPart  B  consists  of  rehabilitating  NHPP  and  associated  transmission  to  improve  its\n5.\nreliability  of  power  supply.  NHPP  supplies  about  80  percent  of  electricity  generation  in  the\ncountry.    This  plant  was  built  in  stages  from  1962  to  1979  and  there  had  been  minimal  or  no\nmaintenance work carried out on a regular basis. As a result, heavy siltation and deposition of\nother  debris  downstream  of  NHPP  effectively  reduced  the  design  head  by  about  six  meters,\ncausing  substantial  loss  of  electricity  generation.    The  switchyard  is  built  on  ground  that  has\nbecome  unstable  and  this  can  cause  major  problems  if  the  foundations  are  not  rehabilitated.\nFailure  of  one  switchyard  could  reduce  power  transmission  for  several  months  causing  major\neconomic loss.\n\nPart C includes improvement of the reliability of electricity supplied in Dushanbe region,\n6.\nthe  national  capital  district.  This  component  will  cover  rehabilitation  of  two  substations,\nrelocating the existing transformers to locations outside the city.\n\nThe  provision  of  better  transformers  and  modernization  of  distribution  system  in\n7.\nDushanbe region will greatly improve economic activities in the national capital region, which is\nsubject to frequent power shortages under prevailing conditions. These substations are critical\nbut  are  overloaded,  more  than  30  years  old,  and  at  the  end  of  their  economic  life.  Their\nrehabilitation  will  improve  energy  transmission  efficiency,  reduce  energy  losses,  and  improve\nworkplace safety.\n\nF. \n\nParts D and E\n\n8.\nPart D includes provision of electricity meters to measure power exports and imports and\npower exchanged between distribution networks. The estimated cost of about $0.7 million was\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nincluded in the economic analysis but in view of the small benefits, a separate analysis was not\nundertaken. Similarly, only the cost of part E, provision of consulting services, was included in\nthe  economic  analysis.  The  benefits  are  small  and  as  it  would  be  difficult  to  disaggregate  the\nbenefits, these have been conservatively taken as zero.\n\nG.\n\nWillingness to Pay\n\n9.\nSimilar to the other ADB projects, WTP for electricity was estimated using value of the\nmost likely or next best alternative available for electricity users. The weighted average of costs\nof different electricity user categories (such as industry, households, and agriculture) was used\nas the final figure of WTP (Table A11.2).\n\nTable A11.2: Willingness to Pay for Electricity\n\nSupply Option\n\nAverage Tariff\nLarge Power Plant (Coal fired 300 MW)\nSmall Diesel  Generator (0.5 MW)\nKerosene\nIndustrial Tariff\nHousehold Tariff\nCommercial/Agriculture\nImported Electricity Cost\n\nWTP Estimatea\n\n           Cost\n            (TJR/kWh)\n\n  9.0\n124.0\n254.0\n422.0\n  13.6\n    7.0\n   27.0\n 100.0\n\n    90.1\n\n     a  Weighted average based on electricity consumption: industry = 41 percent;\n\n          water supply and agriculture = 18 percent; households = 36 percent; and\n          Government and others = 5 percent.\n \n\n   Source: Staff estimates.\n\n10.\nThe incremental power output of the Project is valued on the basis of weighted average\nof WTP of TJR90.1/kWh ($0.0450/kWh). This is based on (i) an upper bound of TJR422.0/kWh\nfor  alternative  energy  source  (kerosene)  and  a  lower  bound  of  TJR7.0/kWh  (average  tariff  for\nhouseholds), and (ii) curve-linear relationship of 0.3. The nonincremental part of the electricity\ngeneration was estimated taking into account the weighted average cost of alternative (present\nuse) energy sources. Cost data for this estimation was obtained from the participatory poverty\nimpact analysis conducted during the feasibility study stage (Appendix 12).\n\nH.\n\nLeast Cost Analysis\n\nThere is no alternative to the Project given the urgent need for improved power output\n11.\nand fiscal constraints on building new power facilities. The diversity among project components\nmade such analysis not possible. However, during the feasibility study, the Project was divided\ninto a large number of subcomponents and a set of potential alternatives, including a do-nothing\noption, and their costs were analyzed. For example, NHPP tailrace dredging was compared with\nfour options: (i) importing an additional 320 gigawatt-hours (GWh), (ii) building a new hydro or\ndiesel power plant providing 320 GWh, (iii) increasing efficiency of the turbine with new runners,\nand (iv) do-nothing. The proposed tailrace dredging is the least cost option. In a similar manner,\nleast-cost  options  were  examined  for  the  13  subcomponents  of  the  Project,  resulting  in  more\nthan 25 options. These analyses confirmed that all project components are a part of the least-\ncost plan for power subsector development in the country.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\nI.\n\nCost-Benefit Analysis\n\n12.\nThe  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  is  28.0  percent,\nwhich is above ADB\u2019s threshold for economic viability of 12 percent (Table A11.3). Calculation\ndetails  are  presented  in  Table  A11.4.  Economic  viability  remains  robust  with  changes  in\nassumptions.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  for  various  changes  such  as  increase  in\ncapital  cost,  reduction  in  revenue,  delay  in  implementation,  and  a  combination  of  cases\n(Table A11.3).

Participatory development exercises were held to understand the quality and\naccessibility  of  electricity  and  determine  its  linkages  with  levels  of  poverty  in  the  project  area.\nThe Project has five parts (paras. 51-63 of the main report).\n\nB.\n\nPoverty in Tajikistan\n\n2.\nTajikistan  is  composed  of  four  geographical  regions:  Gorno-Badakhshan,  Khatlon,\nLenninabad,  and  Region  of  Republican  Subordination.  Although  the  country  was  the  poorest\nrepublic  in  the  former  Soviet  Union,  investment  in  social  infrastructure  through  large  budget\ntransfers  from  Moscow,  equivalent  to  40  percent  of  gross  domestic  product,  helped  sustain\nsocial and economic infrastructure. Tajikistan inherited high levels of human capital which have\nnot  been  sustained  after  independence,  when  the  absence  of  budget  transfers,  collapse  of\ninterrepublican  trading,  poor  economic  management  until  mid-1990s,  civil  conflict,  and  major\nnatural disasters led to a decline in living conditions.\n\nTajikistan  is  experiencing  high  levels  of  poverty.  A  World  Bank  study2  reports  that\n3.\napproximately 83 percent of the population are poor, and have insufficient resources to cover all\nbasic  needs  of  food,  shelter,  clothing,  education,  and  health  despite  supplementary  income.\nSome of the poverty is cyclical, with shortages of fuel during winter and food during spring. Of\nthis  group,  roughly  5  percent  are  classified  as  destitute,  and  unable  to  care  for  themselves\n(including  the  aged,  orphans  and  street  children,  disabled,  and  unemployed);  and  12  percent\nare experiencing extreme poverty, facing chronic food insecurity or malnutrition with no regular\nor dependable source of income.\n\nAlthough the nominal average monthly wages, minimum wages, and minimum pension\n4.\nhas been increasing relative to 1995 levels, they are substantially lower than 1992 levels, and\nmore  importantly,  are  significantly  lower  than  the  cost  of  the  minimum  consumption  basket.\nAverage  monthly  per  capita  income  is  only  25.9  percent  of  the  1998  minimum  consumption\nbasket; average monthly wages, 38.9 percent. Legislated minimum wage and minimum pension\nconstitute only 8.5 percent of the 1998 minimum consumption basket.\n\nBased  on  income  and  expenditure  patterns  of  households,3  the  national  minimum\n5.\nconsumption basket in 1998 was equivalent to TJR18,399. Since there is no regional minimum\nconsumption  basket  for  Khatlon  Region,  if  TJR15,000  was  used  as  the  poverty  line,  at  least\n80.2 percent of the population is poor based on their incomes. Using expenditure patterns, the\npercentage  of  poor  individuals  is  slightly  higher  at  81.4  percent.  Rural  poverty  based  on  the\nminimum consumption basket is lower than urban poverty based on income at 79.3 percent and\n85.5 percent, respectively; and slightly higher based on expenditures at 81.3 percent and 81.1\npercent, respectively.\n                                                          \n1 TA  5894-REG:  Facilitating  Capacity  Building  and  Participatory  Activities  II,  for  $400,000,  approved  on\n\n28 December 1999.\n\n2  Falkingham, J. 1999.

Formal  employment  is  low,  and  where  available,  consists  mostly  of  civil  service\nemployment  where  salaries  are  often  several  months  in  arrears;  or  seasonal  employment  in\ncollective  farms  paying  TJR2,000  per  month  during  spring  and  TJR10,000  during  summer.\nWomen have lower levels of formal employment than men. Women spend more time at home\ndoing unpaid work. Households supplement their incomes through working on home plots, milk\nproduction,  livestock,  and  small-scale  retail.  In  most  households  visited,  these  constituted  the\nmain  source  of  income.  Poor  households  receive  from  donor  agencies  through  the  local\ngovernment humanitarian aid consisting of 5 liters of cooking oil and/or 10 kilos of flour supplied\nevery 3-6 months. Most income is received during summer and fall, coinciding with harvests, but\nmost expenses are incurred during winter and spring, mainly for heating and clothing.\n\n7.\nBefore  independence  in  1991,  electricity  supply  had  been  reliable.  But  since  then,  the\nprovision of electricity has deteriorated sharply. Households confirm that electricity is available\nintermittently for most of the year except during the winter months (December to March) when\nelectricity  is  only  available  for  2-4  hours  a  day.  Because  of  lack  of  electricity,  people  have\nincreased  their  reliance  on  alternative  sources  of  fuel.  The  most  typical  alternatives  are\nfuelwood,  agricultural  waste,  animal  dung,  and  diesel.  Three  to  five  cubic  meters  of  fuelwood\nand  agricultural  waste  are  required  per  month  during  winter,  and  1-2  cubic  meters  during\nsummer months. At a market value of TJR5,000 per cubic meter, households spend as much as\nTJR25,000  (including  time  and  cost)  on  fuel  during  winter  months.  Where  fuelwood  is  scarce,\nanimal dung is used intensively, averaging 1,500 briquettes per household during winter months\nand 300 briquettes during rest of the year, valued at TJR15,000 mainly for labor cost. Diesel is\nprimarily  used  for  lighting  and  igniting  fuelwood  or  animal  dung.  Interviews  with  some\nhouseholds  show  that  the  cost  for  using  diesel  for  illumination  can  reach  TJR18,000  during\nwinter when electricity is not available. Other alternatives such as kerosene, coal, and liquefied\npetroleum gas, though available, are used in limited quantities due to prohibitive costs. Further,\nthe sources of these fuels are typically several kilometers from villages, and households do not\nstore these fuels due to indoor safety considerations.\n\n8.\nField visits supported the view that the provision of electricity will have substantial impact\non reduction of poverty and improving the living conditions of the poor. In Tajikistan, as in other\nCentral  Asian  countries,  electricity  provision  has  clear  links  with  the  level  of  poverty.  Due  to\nharsh winters, heat is a basic need. For three decades the Tajik people had reliable, year-round\nelectricity, but are now often deprived of it.\n\n9.\nAlternative  fuels  are  expensive  and  entail  high  costs  in  time,  labor,  health,  social  and\ngender  impacts.  Fuelwood,  agricultural  waste,  and  biomass  gathering  takes  15  days  for  one\nmonth of use. Households spend one hour daily each summer making cow dung briquettes to\ngenerate the required supply for winter. Gathering and preparing these energy sources is done\nprimarily  by  women  and  children.  The  use  of  these  energy  sources,  typically  for  cooking  in\nunventilated  rooms,  is  a  health  hazard  for  women  and  children  who  spend  approximately  five\nhours  per  day  in  these  cooking  rooms.  During  focus  group  discussions,  participants  ranked\nelectricity  as  the  best  form  of  energy  based  on  availability,  convenience,  affordability,  time,\nindoor safety, environmental considerations, and storage requirements. This is often followed by\nfuelwood, agricultural wastes, animal dung, and diesel.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nHouseholds identified the lack of food, clothing, shelter, water, and employment as the\n10.\nmain  issues  concerning  poverty,  and  recognized  that  energy  is  an  important  element  in  the\nprovision  of  basic  needs.  In  the  areas  visited,  safe  water  is  unavailable  partly  because  of  the\nlack  of  electricity.  Prior  to  independence,  piped  water  had  been  provided  to  households.\nHowever,  due  to  the  irregular  and  inadequate  electricity  supply,  pumping  from  reservoirs  and\ndeepwells  has  been  restricted.  The  people  have  coped  by  obtaining  water  from  rivers  and\nreservoirs  using  donkeys  and  trolleys,  and  may  have  to  travel  up  to  15  kilometers  to  such\nsources. Due to transportation and storage, water obtained is often contaminated. Community\norganizations  have  developed  open  water  pools  made  of  compacted  clay  to  store  water\ndelivered  by  trucks  for  local  consumption.  However,  the  pools  are  exposed  to  contamination,\nmaking their water unsuitable for drinking. This water is often not boiled due to the scarcity of\nelectricity.\n\n11.\nOn  the  issue  of  employment,  the  large  agricultural  base,  which  depends  on  irrigation,\nhas suffered from the unavailability of pumped irrigation. As a result, the yield has dropped to\n20-25  percent  of  former  levels.  In  one  village,  2,500  hectares  of  productive  fields  that  once\nemployed  10,000  individuals  have  become  flooded.  The  flood  water  is  saline,  and  this  has\ncontaminated the groundwater. Malaria is also common in the area. In areas where the problem\nis  not  as  severe,  pumping  and  drainage  facilities  often  break  down,  and  irrigation  is  available\nonly irregularly.\n\n12.\nThe  provision  of  education  and  health  services  to  the  population  is  similarly  hampered\nby the lack of electricity. Since electricity is available in rural areas for only up to two hours daily\nduring  winter,  schools  do  not  receive  adequate  electricity  for  heating  and  lighting.  They  have\ntried  alternative  forms  of  energy,  such  generators,  but  these  have  not  been  widely  adopted\nbecause  of  the  high  cost  involved.  In  some  areas,  children  are  asked  to  bring  a  bundle  of\nfuelwood  or  agricultural  waste  to  fuel  indoor  stoves.  Because  heating  is  often  not  available,\nschools are typically closed for two months during winter, and operate for extended hours during\nsummer, which has negative psychological effects on students. School enrolment has dropped,\nparticularly since poor children may lack warm clothes and shoes, and therefore do not attend\nschool during the rest of winter. Hospitals also lack heating. In winter, surgical operations can\nonly be  performed during the  few hours when electricity is available. This affects the ability to\nrespond  to  emergency  medical  situations  and  forces  hospitals  to  prioritize  cases  accordingly.\nMedicines  and  vaccines  cannot  be  properly  stored  at  controlled  conditions  due  to  the  lack  of\nelectricity. As a consequence, many hospitals have been closed and those that are open are at\nthe administrative centers. This results in high transportation costs and travel time for patients,\nleading to even higher expenses for the poor who do not live near the centers.\n\n13.\nHouseholds  identified  employment  and  small  entrepreneurial  activities  they  could\nundertake if electricity were available. Households invest considerable time collecting alternative\nfuel  (such  as  fuelwood,  agricultural  waste  or  cow  dung).  This  prevents  women  from  greater\nparticipation  in  the  labor  force  and  limits  productive  home  activities  such  as  working  on  home\nplots.  If  more  electricity  were  available,  households  would    (i)  increase  their  entrepreneurial\nactivities  such  as  grain  milling,  baking,  sewing,  small-scale  and  trade  activities;  (ii)  have\nincreased  information  from  mass  media;  and  (iii)  have  greater  convenience  from  use  of  light\nbulbs  and  small  household  appliances.  Electricity  is  also  necessary  for  encouraging  private\ninvestments.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nD. \n\nBenefit Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis\n\n14.\nThe difference between the financial and economic net present values, and consequent\ngains and losses for different project participants, provide the basis for considering the impact of\nthe Project on the poor. For the poverty impact assessment, the project beneficiaries are divided\ninto three groups: consumers, Government economy, and labor. The net economic benefits by\ngroup are distributed between poor and nonpoor.\n\nThe principal economic benefit of the Project to the consumers will arise from increasing\n15.\nthe  power  supply  to  meet  incremental  electricity  demand,  particularly  in  war  damaged  areas.\nThe  incremental  electricity  in  the  project  area  will  benefit  the  poor  more  than  the  nonpoor  as\ntheir  consumption  is  projected  to  increase  faster  because  of  (i)  their  current  lower  electricity\nconsumption  level,    (ii)  the  lower  electricity  tariffs  compared  to  alternative  energy  costs,  and\n(iii) more connections due to the Project. The consumers will also benefit from rehabilitation of\nNurek  Hydropower  Plant,  as  it  is  the  least-cost  option.  Based  on  the  Project's  share  of  poor\nconsumers,  their  electricity  consumption  pattern,  and  the  number  of  people  living  below  the\npoverty  line,  59  percent  of  the  benefits  to  consumers  would  go  to  the  poor.  This  is  a\nconservative  estimate  given  that  indirect  benefits  from  industrial  consumption  and  all  other\nsources  have  not  been  fully  taken  into  account  and  are  likely  to  benefit  the  poor  more  than\nothers. In Tajikistan, 83 percent of the population live below official poverty line. Staff estimated4\nthat 76 percent of the return to the Government benefits the poor. Similarly, 70 percent of the\nlabor benefits are expected to go to the poor.\n\n16.\nThe  increased,  more  efficient,  and  more  reliable  electricity  supply  resulting  from  the\nProject  will  benefit  the  poor  directly  and  indirectly  (Table  A12).  The  net  economic  benefits\naccruing to the poor amount to $27 million. Thus, 57 percent of the net economic benefits of the\nProject  will  accrue  to  the  poor  (i.e.,  the  poverty  impact  ratio  is  57  percent).  Some  indirect\neconomic  and  social  benefits  were  not  captured  in  this  analysis.  If  these  benefits  were  also\nconsidered, it is expected that a substantial portion of the project benefits will go to the poor, in\nsupport of the Project's primary objective of poverty reduction.\n\n                                                          \n4 UNDP's and World Bank's Tajikistan Living Standards Survey, May 1999.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\nTable A12 :  Benefit Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis\n($ million)\n\nBenefits\nFinancial Economic\nAccounts Accounts Difference Consumers Economy\n\nGovernment\n\nBeneficiaries\n\nLabor Total\n\n38.84\n38.56\n0.45\n1.80\n-1.97\n\n90.24\n41.04\n0.53\n2.13\n46.54\n\n51.40\n-2.48\n-0.08\n-0.33\n48.51\n\n51.40\n0\n0\n0\n51.40\n\n0\n-2.48\n-0.08\n0\n-2.56\n\n0\n0\n0\n-0.33\n-0.33\n\n51.40\n-2.48\n-0.08\n-0.33\n48.51\n\n        -\n\n51.40\n\n-2.56\n-1.97\n-4.53\n51.40\n59.00              76.00\n-3.44\n30.33\n\n-0.33\n-\n-0.33\n70.00\n-0.23\n\n48.51\n 1.97\n46.54\n\n26.66\n57.28\n\nA.

The\nproject area is characterized by high levels of poverty and is largely rural. Electricity is a basic\nneed in the project area for heat, cooking, and pumping of safe drinking water. The Project will\nalso support the improvement of essential services such as water for irrigation, education, and\nhealth.  It  will  provide  direct  employment,  and  make  the  environment  conducive  for  generating\nmore  jobs  through  (i)  economic  development  as  a  direct  input  of  production,  and  (ii)  reducing\nthe  time  spent  on  using  energy  alternatives  for  more  productive  activities.  This  will  have\nsignificant impact on vulnerable groups, particularly women and children.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nIMPACT OF TARIFF INCREASES ON THE POOR IN TAJIKISTAN\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nElectricity tariffs have to be increased over the coming years to full cost recovery (FCR)\n1.\nof electricity supply, to ensure the financial sustainability of Barki Tajik. However, the increase in\ntariff  is  especially  difficult  for  the  poor  to  bear,  particularly  households  headed  by  women,\nhouseholds  with  the  elderly  people,  and  rural  households  with  many  children.  Therefore,  a\nmechanism is needed to safeguard the poor from the effects of increased electricity tariff.\n\nB.\n\nOptions for Consideration\n\nUnder  Asian  Development  Bank  funded  technical  assistance1  (TA),  five  options  for\n\n2.\nelectricity tariffs were investigated, taking into account the current situation in Tajikistan:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ncharge a tariff equal to FCR with no subsidy;\n\ncharge  a \nthe  poorest\n20 percent  of households so that they are left no worse off for the price increase;\n\nto  FCR  and  pay  a  subsidy \n\ntariff  equal \n\nto \n\ntariff  equal \n\nthe  poorest\ncharge  a \n20 percent of households that partially offsets the increased burden of paying a\nhigher tariff;\n\nto  FCR  and  pay  a  subsidy \n\nto \n\ncontinue to provide 150 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month at the existing price to all\nhouseholds  (with  no  real  increase)  and  charge  a  tariff  equal  to  FCR  for\nconsumption in excess of 150 kWh; and\n\nimplement a three-tier pricing system: a subsidized rate for the first 150 kWh per\nmonth \nthe  second\n150 kWh, and a tariff above cost for any consumption in excess of 300 kWh per\nmonth.\n\nfor  all  households,  a \n\ntariff  equal \n\nto  FCR \n\nfor \n\n3.\nThe  TA  concluded  that  the  first  option  is  not  viable  as  it  does  not  have  a  social  safety\ncomponent. Other than the lifeline tariff initiated in 1999, Tajikistan currently has no functioning\nsafety net. If residential tariffs were raised to FCR as per option 1, this would be a 500 percent\nincrease in tariff to the poor, who would be spending 8.3 percent of their incomes on electricity\ncompared to current expenditures of 1.8 percent.2 Options 2 and 3 pose difficulties, namely: (i)\nthe  definition  of  the  poverty  line  (the  \"poorest  20  percent\"  is  an  arbitrary  line  without  any\nobjective  poverty  criteria);  (ii)  the  identification  of  households  entitled  for  lifeline  subsidy,  as\nmany people who would be entitled for nonemployment payment or other social security are not\nregistered,  partly  because  the  procedures  involved  are  cumbersome  and  costs  are  high;  and\n\n                                                          \n1 TA  3114-TAJ:  Institutional Strengthening of the Transport and Energy Sectors,  for  $1.5  million,  approved  on\n\n10 December 1998.\n\n2  Since  poor  households  spend  about  79  percent  of  their  income  on  food,  if  tariffs  were  raised  to  FCR,  about\n\n40 percent of their nonfood expenditure would be on electricity alone, compared to 9 percent at present.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\n(iii)  the  actual  disbursement  of  the  lifeline  subsidy.  Option  4  overcomes  these  problems  but\ntreats  all  households  equally.  However,  as  83  percent  of  the  population  is  poor,  it  is  not\nabsolutely  devoid  of  targeting,  since  only  the  first  150  kWh  is  subsidized.  Option  5  is  a\nrefinement  of  option  4  and  is  not  feasible  with  the  present  economic  situation  as  it  requires  a\nsignificant  number  of  households  consuming  over  300  kWh  per  month  to  provide  the  cross-\nsubsidy.\n\n4.\nOption 4 represents the status quo up to a consumption level of 150 kWh per month as a\nlifeline tariff, with increases in tariff up to FCR for consumption beyond 150 kWh. Based on data\nof  Falkingham3 and the World  Bank survey,4  and  on  the  assumption  that  150  kWh  as  a  basic\nsupply  to  be  subsidized,  the  findings  of  this  analysis  show  that  the  poorest  20  percent  of\nhouseholds,  under  present  conditions,  pay  3  percent  of  their  monthly  income  for  electricity.\nIncome  as  defined  includes  the  monetized  contribution  of  their  subsistence  production,  as\n83 percent of the population are poor.  Since salaries make up only a part of the total income,\nthe electricity bill consumes a larger percentage of their actual cash income.\n\nC.\n\nEstimation of Cost of Lifeline Subsidy\n\nLifeline subsidy for electricity supply of households involves costs, which will have to be\n5.\npaid by the Government to Barki Tajik. Based on certain assumptions, the financial cost of the\nlifeline tariff subsidy was estimated. Table A13 highlights these costs, which are based on the\nfollowing assumptions. The present level of lifeline tariff is $0.0025/kWh and this is adjusted for\ninflation  only.  The  present  level  of  electricity  consumption  is  about  80  kWh  per  month  per\nhousehold  and  this  is  not  expected  to  increase  without  the  Project.  This  is  a  reasonable\nassumption  as  electricity  supply  will  deteriorate  without  the  Project.  Poor  households  require\nabout 150 kWh of electricity per month for basic needs. This includes lighting, heating (during\nwinter only), and cooking for four hours per day.\n\n6.\nThe analysis shows the subsidy per year by the Government to fund the lifeline tariff will\nrise from 2004 (about $0.6 million) to 2008 (about $4.0 million). As the Government proposes to\nuse  the  interest  margin  arising  from  relending  of  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  and\ncofinancier  (Swiss  Government)  proceeds  to  fund  subsidies  to  Barki  Tajik  for  the  lifeline  tariff,\nthe net subsidy per year from Government budget in 2004 is expected to be about $0.6 million,5\nwhich rises to $2.1 million in 2008. Hence, during 2004 to 2008, a cumulative subsidy of about\n$6.3 million is required from the Government budget. On average this is equivalent annually to\nabout 1 percent of the current annual Government budget. The Government has agreed that it\nwill take necessary measures to make up for any shortfall in the subsidy to Barki Tajik arising\nfrom the implementation of the lifeline tariff.\n\nD.\n\nConclusion\n\nInclusion  of  all  households  in  the  lifeline  subsidy  is  justified  because  83  percent  of  the\n7.\npopulation  are  poor,  and  eliminates  the  administrative  problem  of  targeting  and  delivering  to\nthose entitled to the subsidy. The present lifeline tariff of TJR5/kWh is considered acceptable for\npoor  households.  After  the  power  supply  improves,  the  lifeline  subsidy  is  to  be  reviewed  and\n\n                                                          \n3  Falkingham, J. 1999.

The aim should be to ultimately eliminate the lifeline subsidy by a gradual\nrise of the tariff until this reaches FCR.\n\n8.\n\nThe Government in principle has agreed to:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nmaintain  the  current  lifeline  tariff  (in  real  terms)  and  level  until  the  national\npoverty  reduction  strategy,  which  is  to  be  finalized  in  mid-2001,  is  implemented\n(among the proposals to be considered include a cash compensation scheme for\nthe poor and vulnerable groups, and the gradual introduction of a three-tier tariff\nfor residential consumers);\n\ndiscuss  with  the  national  Poverty  Reduction  Working  Group  and  develop  a\nproposal for a satisfactory safety net for the poor and vulnerable groups affected\nby  electricity  tariff  increases;  proposals  must  be  acceptable  to  ADB  and\nsubmitted by January 2002 as per the Energy Sector Action Plan; and\n\n(iii) \n\nhold a public awareness program from January 2001 to educate the public on the\nneed for a rational tariff scheme and the importance of energy conservation.\n\n\fTable A13: Financial Subsidy Calculation\n\nItem\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\nResidential Consumers\n  Khatlon Region (Part A)\n  Dushanbe Region (Part D)\nTotal Consumers in Project Area\nIncremental Consumers\n\nConsumption without Project (kWh)\nConsumption with Project (kWh)\nIncremental Consumption up to Lifeline\nDomestic Tariff (US\u00a2/kWh)\n\nLifeline Tariff (US\u00a2/kWh)\nSubsidy per kWh\nAdditional Subsidy ($ thousand/yr)\n  - For New Consumers\n  - For Increased Consumption of Present Consumers\nTotal Subsidy Required ($ thousand/year)\nLoan Relending Differential Income ($ thousand)\nNet Budgetary Transfer ($ thousand per year)\nNet BudgetaryTransfer - Cumulative ($ thousand)\nkWh = kilowatt-hour.\nSource:  Staff estimates\n\n25,215\n\n25,972\n\n24,481\n\n31,012\n148,265 151,230 154,255 157,340 160,487 163,697 166,970 170,310 173,716\n172,746 176,446 180,227 184,091 188,040 192,077 196,202 200,418 204,728\n31,982\n\n26,751 27,554\n\n11,345 15,294\n\n23,456 27,672\n\n29,232 30,109\n\n28,380\n\n19,331\n\n3,700\n\n7,481\n\n0\n\n80\n80\n0\n0.55\n\n0.25\n0.30\n\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n\n80\n80\n0\n0.63\n\n0.32\n0.32\n\n$11\n$0\n$11\n$0\n($11)\n($11)\n\n80\n80\n0\n0.79\n\n0.32\n0.47\n\n$34\n$0\n$34\n$0\n($34)\n($45)\n\n80\n80\n0\n0.99\n\n0.32\n0.67\n\n80\n100\n20\n1.24\n\n0.32\n0.92\n\n80\n110\n30\n1.54\n\n0.32\n1.23\n\n80\n150\n70\n1.70\n\n0.32\n1.38\n\n80\n170\n70\n1.87\n\n0.32\n1.55\n\n80\n190\n70\n2.06\n\n0.32\n1.74\n\n$73\n$0\n$73\n$0\n($73)\n($118)\n\n$168\n$414\n$583\n$0\n($583)\n($701)\n\n$313\n$848\n$1,161\n$0\n($1,161)\n($1,862)\n\n$583\n\n$773\n$2,276 $2,611\n$2,859 $3,384\n$2,012 $1,919\n($847) ($1,465)\n($2,709) ($4,174)\n\n$1,000\n$2,989\n$3,989\n$1,825\n($2,164)\n($6,338)\n\n7\n4\n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n\n \n\n4\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 31 October 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nTJR1\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Tajik Ruble (TJR)\n$0.0005\nTJR2,200\n", "An exchange rate of TJR2,000 to $1.00, prevailing at appraisal, has been used in this report.
