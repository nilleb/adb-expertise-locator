The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nA. \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n2. \nIn  most  developing  countries,  SMEs  are  important  supporters  of  economic  growth  and \nkey contributors to poverty reduction through increases to individual incomes and employment \ncreation. In the Kyrgyz Republic, private sector enterprises grew to become an important part of \nthe  economy  following  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union.  The  total  SME  contribution  to \nemployment  increased  from  12.8%  in  2006  to  14.2%  in  2009,  and  the  contribution  to  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  grew  from  45.2%  to  45.8%  over  the  same  period.1   While  the  overall \ninput  of  SMEs  to  the  country\u2019s  economy  is  significant,  it  is  important  to  note  that  there  were \nminimal increases in SME employment and contribution to GDP from 2006 to 2009. \n \n3. \nGrowth  in  the  SME  sector  has  been  hampered  by  a  number  of  factors.  A  2010 \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) study on the SME sector in the Kyrgyz Republic cites a \ndifficult  investment  climate,  cumbersome  procedures,  and,  in  particular,  a  lack  of  access  to \nfinance  as  \u201chindrances  to  business  development\u201d. 2    Access  to  finance  was  also  severely \ncurtailed due to political strife in 2010. Bank lending has increased as a result of stabilization of \nthe  political  situation  and  continued  strengthening  of  the  economy,  but  a  gap  in  SME  funding \nneeds  remains,  as  banks  continue  to  focus  on  large,  top-tier  companies  that  are  perceived  to \nhave lower risks.3 \n \n4. \nThe  provision  of  medium  and  long-term  financing  to  SMEs  is  essential  for  these \ncompanies to be able to invest in the technology and capital needed to increase productivity and \ncompetitiveness. To expand access to finance in the Kyrgyz Republic, the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  began  exploring  possible  opportunities  in  2009  with  banks  with  a  strong  market \npresence,  good  distribution  networks,  and  experience  in  commercial  and  SME  lending.  KICB \nwas selected as a potential borrower based on its desire and ability to expand its SME portfolio, \nits  sound  credit  profile,  strong  shareholders,  and  its  interest  in  establishing  a  longer-term \nrelationship  with  ADB.  This  will  be  the  first  investment  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  supported  by \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n5. \nKICB  is  a  joint  stock  company  incorporated  in  2001.  KICB\u2019s  mission  is  to  provide \ncommercially viable banking services to a broad base of the population that contributes to the \neconomic  growth  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and,  in  particular,  to  SMEs,  which  were  seriously \naffected  by  the  recent  turmoil.  KICB  provides  a  range  of  loan  and  deposit  products  for \ncompanies  and  individuals  that  are  appropriate  for  the  small  size  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s \neconomy,  and  the  small  size  of  business  and  household  financing  needs.  KICB  is  the  third \n                                                 \n1  State  Statistics  Committee  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  2009.

Seoul (October 2010). \n\n \n\n\f 2\n\nlargest bank in the country in terms of total assets ($144.7 million as of 30 June 2011). It has 18 \nbranches,  9  subbranches,  46  ATMs,  and  400  staff.  As  of  the  end  of  June  2011,  KICB  had  a \n10.5% market share in terms of total banking loans, 10.8% in terms of deposits, and 11.0% in \nterms of total assets.4 The allocation of KICB\u2019s loans is 60% corporate and 40% retail. \n \nKICB\u2019s SME business is part of its broader retail segment and represented 17% of the \n6. \nretail portfolio as of the end of August 2011. KICB has been active in the retail segment and with \nSME lending since 2005 with the help of the technical assistance (TA) from the European Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Female borrowers constitute 45% of this portfolio \n(as of August 2011), which is a focal market for KICB.5 KICB targets SMEs by segmenting them \nby size into micro and small enterprises (loans of $250\u2013$10,000 equivalent) and SMEs (loans of \n$10,000\u2013$100,000  equivalent).  KICB  does  not  provide  microfinance  loans.  SME  loans  are \nsecured  and  cover  a  wide  range  of  industries,  including  agriculture,  trade,  fisheries, \nmanufacturing,  distribution,  tourism,  construction  and  transport.  The  highest  concentration  of \nassets  is  in  trade  (75%  of  the  total  loan  portfolio  as  of  the  end  of  June  2011)  and  agriculture \n(14%).6 KICB  intends  to  shift  its  portfolio  to  focus  less  on  trade  and  more  on  production  and \nasset generation to enable SMEs to thrive and grow. The SME portfolio has surpassed the 2010 \nlevel as a proportion of the retail segment, and is currently expected to have an average growth \nrate of about 20%\u201330% per annum for the next 3 years; the retail portfolio is expected to grow \nto about 50% of the loan portfolio by 2013\u20132014. \n \nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\n7. \nKICB is owned by three development financial institutions, each of which own 17% of the \nbank\u2019s  shareholding:  Deutsche  Investitions-  und  Entwicklungsgesellschaft  mbH,  EBRD,  and \nIFC. Additional shareholders include the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED) \n(21%),  Habib  Bank  of  Pakistan  (18%),  and  the  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  (10%). \nAKFED is the private sector investment agency of the Aga Khan Development Network. AKFED \nalso has a 51% ownership stake in Habib Bank, which is the largest bank in Pakistan. Hence, \neffectively  AKFED  owns  30%  of  KICB.  Given  the  development  mandates  of  the  major \nshareholders, it is expected that they will be long-term investors. \n \n\n2. \n\nManagement \n\n8. \nKICB\u2019s senior management team is comprised of experienced banking executives who \npreviously  worked  at  various  banks  throughout  Asia;  they  are  responsible  for  managing  the \nbank in conformity with its stated goals. The key senior positions are: (i) chief executive officer \n(CEO), (ii) chief banking officer, (iii) chief operating officer, (iv) chief corporate officer, (v) chief \nretail  officer,  and  (vi)  chief  financial  officer.  The  CEO  (Kwan  Young  Choi)  has  36  years  of \nbanking experience, including 15 in Central Asia, and 11 with KICB.7 \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\n9. \nKICB is managed through various levels of corporate governance. KICB is overseen by \na  board  of  directors,  which  approves  the  bank's  strategy,  business  plan,  and  corporate  plan, \nreviews  all  of  the  bank's  general  policies  and  principles,  and  is  involved  with  other  matters \nrelating to overall bank functioning as appropriate. There are three management committees\u2014 \n\n                                                 \n4  KICB. KICB Revised Business Plan for 2011\u20133013.

These  committees  facilitate  management  of  KICB's \noperations,  and  the  internal  and  external  audit  function.  The  board  of  directors  comprises  five \nnominee directors representing each shareholder with the exception of IFC.  \n  \nThe  board  of  directors  has  overall  responsibility  for  oversight  of  the  risk  management \n10. \nframework,  ensuring  that  management  of  key  risks  and  risk  management  policies  and \nprocedures are  implemented  and  followed.  The  head  of  the  risk  department  is  responsible  for \nrisk management and ensuring that implementation of controls and procedures are in place and \nadhered to. A monthly risk position report is provided to the board of directors and management \non (i) the current position, and (ii) proposed recommendations to ensure that KICB is within the \ninternal and central bank parameters.8 \n \nCredit is managed though a system of credit committees, and liquidity and market risks \n11. \nthrough the asset and liability committee. The asset and liability management committee (which \nis chaired by the CEO) approves risk limits, based on recommendations by the risk department. \nEBRD has provided TA for cash flow, credit, and SME business plan analysis. An experienced \ninternational risk management consultant is working closely and proactively with KICB, and the \nbank is adding internal staff to this function.9 \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n1. \n\nCurrent Performance \n\n12. \nOne of KICB\u2019s primary  strategic objectives is capital recovery through  profit generation \nand  retention  by  creating  a  strong  market  presence  across  all  sectors  of  the  business  and \ngeneral  community.  KICB  increased  its  asset  base  considerably  in  2011  as  a  result  of  the \nimprovement  in  the  investment  climate.  Total  gross  loans  as  of  the  end  of  August  2011  were \n$90 million. Total assets were $144.7 million as of 30 June 2011, an increase of 22% from the \nend of 2010. As of 30 June 2011, total loans were $70.9 million (up from $68.1 million at the end \nof  2010);  deposits  were  $84.4  million  (up  from  $71.9  million  at  the  end  of  2010).  Demand  for \nSME  loans  has  increased  considerably.  From  June  2010  to  June  2011,  KICB\u2019s  SME  loan \nportfolio grew by 58% in dollar terms and by 23% in volume (from 1,953 to 2,420 loans). Total \nequity  is  $26.3  million.

Capitalization and Capital Adequacy \n\n13. \nKICB has a strong capital adequacy ratio of 35.8% as of the end of June 2011, which is \nwell  above  the  12%  regulatory  limit  and  the  bank\u2019s  15%  internal  limit.  KICB\u2019s  tier  1  capital  is \n29.1%.  KICB\u2019s  level  of  capitalization  has  remained  strong  as  a  result  of  continued  profitability \nand the recent $7.5 million equity injection from shareholders. Dividends were distributed for the \nfirst time in April 2011, amounting to $300,000. \n \n\nb.  Earnings \n\nKICB\u2019s  financial  performance  from  2005  through  2009  was  sound,  as  exhibited  by  a \n14. \ncompounded  annual  growth  rate  for  net  income  of  26%.  Net  income  for  the  year  ending  31 \nDecember 2010 was $1.8 million, which represented a decrease of 42% from 2009 due to the \npolitical events in the Kyrgyz Republic, which resulted in KICB not being fully operational for a \nperiod  of  5  months.  However,  reporting  as  of  the  end  of  June  2011  shows  considerable \nimprovement, with net income at $2.4 million, a 33% increase over the full year\u2019s performance in \n2010.  Operating  income  for  2010  was  $10.4  million  and  $6.1  million  for  the  6  months  ending \nJune 30, 2011. The cost-to-income ratio decreased slightly to 59% in the first half of 2011 from \n60% as of the end of 2010. Costs reflect the increase in staffing as a result of the growing loan \nportfolio, opening of branches, and purchase of new software. Return on equity increased 1.6% \nfrom  the  2010  level,  reaching  9.5%  for  the  first  6  months  of  2011;  return  on  assets  increased \n0.2%  to  1.8%.  With  political  stability  and  an  improving  economic  environment,  growth  is \nexpected to continue over the near term. \n \n\nc.  Funding and Liquidity \n\n15. \nKICB has a strong funding and liquidity profile through customer deposits and external \nborrowings. The main funding source for KICB is deposits and international financial institution \n(IFI)  loans. Deposits  accounted  for 60%  of  funding  in  2010,  and  58%  for  the  first 6  months  of \n2011. Approximately 73% of these deposits are demand deposits and 27% are time deposits. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nKICB is targeting at least 30% deposit growth by 2012. Deposits had already grown by 22% as \nof the end of August 2011 (to $84.4 million). In addition to deposits, the other major source of \nfunding is external borrowings (19.9%) and equity (18%). KICB has a minimum liquid assets-to-\nshort-term liabilities ratio of 30% (up to 30 days). As of the end of the second quarter of 2011, \nthe  liquidity  ratio  was  91%  and  the  aggregate  open  currency  position was  0.53%.  As  treasury \nbills  command  high  interest  rates  (22%  in  June  2011)  and  are  liquid,  management  plans  to \nmaintain government securities at about 7% of total assets over the next 3 years. \n \n16. \nKICB  has  limited  maturity  mismatches  (all  buckets  less  than  100%  of  equity)  as  it  has \nhad  access  to  mostly  short-term  funding  and  has,  therefore,  restricted  its  lending  to  relatively \nshort-term  tenors.  KICB  has  insignificant  foreign  exchange  mismatches.  Given  that  the \neconomy  is  largely  dollar  denominated,  KICB\u2019s  portfolio  comprises  88%  US  dollar  loans;  the \nincome  of  these  borrowers  is  generated  primarily  in  US  dollars.11 The  maximum  open  foreign \ncurrency  position  a  bank  can  hold  per  currency  (other  than  US  dollars)  is  15%  of  capital;  the \naggregate open foreign currency position cannot exceed 20% of capital. \n\n \n\nd.  Asset Quality \n\n17. \nKICB  has  a  diversified  loan  portfolio  across  17  sectors.  It  has  a  concentration  limit  of \n30%  per  sector  with  the  largest  single  exposure  in  trade  (27.5%);  other  sectors  include \nmanufacturing  (19.2%),  tourism  (6.3%),  private  households  (24.9%),  and  agriculture  (5.0%). \nThe  majority  of  KICB\u2019s  borrowers  are  based  in  the  outskirts  of  Bishkek.  The  20  largest \nborrowers account for 34.5% of KICB\u2019s total portfolio. Related party exposure is minimal at 0.4% \nas of the end of June 2011.12 KICB has no outstanding loans to state-owned enterprises. \n \n18.  Most  sectors  of  the  economy  were  affected  by  the  crisis.  KICB\u2019s  nonperforming  loans \n(NPLs)  increased  from  3.2%  in  2009  to  8.7%  in  2010,  which  was  lower  than  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  banking  industry  average  of  15.8%.13 KICB\u2019s  segment  with  the  largest  proportion  of \nNPLs  was  tourism  (7.7%).  The  tourism  sector  has  subsequently  rebounded  in  2011  as \nconfidence  continues  to  increase.  As  of  the  end  of  June  2011,  KICB\u2019s  NPL  ratio  had  further \ndeclined to 8.1%. KICB expects that NPLs will decrease to 5.6% in 2011 and to 4.6% in 2012 as \na  result  of  its  ongoing  efforts  to  strengthen  its  credit  risk  functions.  All  of  KICB\u2019s  loans  are \nbacked  by  collateral  with  a  loan-to-value  ratio  of  70%  of  the  liquidation  value  and  a  loan-to-\nincome ratio of 70%. Provisioning increased significantly in 2010 to $2.08 million as a result of \nweakening  asset  quality. 14 However,  loan  loss  reserves  amounted  to  only  63%  of  NPL\u2019s  in \n2010,  compared  with  95%  in  2009.  Provisioning  as  of  the  first  6  months  of  2011  was  already \n95%.  As  a  precautionary  measure,  KICB  allocated  an  additional  amount  of  $2.3  million  to  a \nreserve  for  general  banking  risks,  increasing  their  provisions  to  105%  as  of  the  end  of \nDecember 2010. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 There are no restrictions on convertibility of currencies in the Kyrgyz Republic. Foreign exchange rates are floating \n\nand determined by demand and supply. \n\n12 The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic related-party exposure limit is 15%. \n13 These  are  NPL  calculations  as  per  the  National  Bank  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  calculated  by  KICB.  NPL \n\ncalculations including non-accruals for 2010 as calculated by ADB was 11.9%.  \n\n14 Provisioning  required  by  the  National  Bank  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is:  satisfactory  loans,  2%;  watch  loans  (non-\nclassified  loans),  10%;  substandard  loans,  25%;  doubtful  loans,  50%;  and  losses,  100%.  Loans  are  classified  as \nfollows,  based  on  the  number  of  days  overdue:  satisfactory  loans:  <  30  days;  watch  loans  31\u201390  days; \nsubstandard loans: 91\u2013180 days; doubtful loans: 181\u2013360 days; loss > 360 days. \n\n \n\n\f 6\n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n19. \nADB  proposes  extending  a  $10  million  senior  unsecured  loan  in  two  tranches  to  KICB \nwith an overall tenor of 8 years.15 As noted, KICB will use ADB\u2019s funds exclusively for onlending \nto  SMEs.  KICB\u2019s  needs  for  funding  growth  in  its  SME  portfolio  were  carefully  assessed,  and \ncompared with recently signed and anticipated facilities from other IFIs to estimate the funding \ngap.  \n \nLoan  parameters.  Eligible  SMEs  under  the  program  are  defined  as  small  or  medium-\n20. \nsized enterprises that employ fewer than 200 employees and meet at least one of the following \ntwo criteria: (i) has annual revenues or sales up to a maximum of Som450,000,000 (about $10 \nmillion); or (ii) has assets, the combined value of which do not exceed Som450, 000,000 (about \n$10  million).  The  definition  is  suitable  for  the  market  and  conforms  to  the  government\u2019s  SME \ndefinition. \n \n21. \nTechnical  assistance.  Capacity  development  TA  is  being  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nCapacity  Building  for  Financial  Institutions,  Phase  2,  approved  in  December  2010. 16  \nSpecifically,  ADB  will  help  strengthen  KICB\u2019s  SME  lending  practices,  which  will  complement \nongoing TA from its strategic international shareholders and will be tailored to KICB\u2019s needs in \nthis  area.  The  capacity  development  TA  is  expected  to  focus  on  improving  credit  assessment \ntechniques  (e.g.,  assisting  KICB  develop  a  scorecard  for  SME  evaluation  and  portfolio \nmanagement). Once KICB\u2019s capacity building needs for its SME business are met, funds from \nthe  capacity  development  TA  may  also  be  used  to  help  the  bank  build  its  mobile  banking \nplatform. In many developing countries, mobile banking is often the primary way in which SMEs \nconduct banking. \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nKICB  will  be  required  to  provide  the  following  information:  (i)  unaudited  financial \n22. \nstatements  on  a  quarterly  basis,  (ii)  audited  financial  statements  on  an  annual  basis,  (iii) \ncompliance certificates for agreed-upon financial covenants on a quarterly basis, (iv) reports on \nthe  subborrowers  on  a  semiannual  basis,  and  (v)  an  annual  environmental  and  social \nperformance  report  (including  a  report  on  onlending  to  SMEs  owned  or  managed  by  women). \nPursuant to the ADB Operations Manual, monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to \nADB on a regular basis, but at least annually.17 The first monitoring report will be submitted no \nlater than 12 months after ADB Board of Directors approval. \n \nC. \n\n \nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n23. \nThe loan will provide critically needed long-term funding to SMEs in the Kyrgyz Republic \nwhose ability to access funds has been constrained by the country\u2019s low level of financial sector \ndevelopment  (FSD)\u2014including  the  absence  of  a  well-developed  capital  market\u2014which  limits \navailability  of  such  funding.  Moreover,  SMEs  were  particularly  impacted  by  the  2010  political \ncrisis;  although  recovering,  they  need  funding  to  support  future  growth.  The  capacity \ndevelopment TA will provide KICB with support to prudently expand and increase the efficiency \nand  sustainability  of  services  to  SMEs,  thereby  supporting  the  SME  sector\u2019s  contribution  to \noverall economic growth and employment generation in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n\n                                                 \n15 Tenor of tranche 1 is 5 years. Tranche 2 will only be disbursed upon compliance with conditions precedent set over \n\nand above what is required for tranche 1 and will have a maximum repayment period of 8 years. \n\n16 ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nD. \n\nRisks \n\nAggressive  Business  Strategy \n\n24. \nin  SME  Lending  and  Asset  Quality  Risks. \nPreviously,  KICB  has  catered  to  corporate  customers  and  is  now  shifting  its  focus  towards \nSMEs. Currently, NPLs have declined to 7.8% as of the end of June 2011 (from 11.9% as of the \nend  of  2010)  and  KICB  expects  that  NPLs  will  continue  to  decline 18 .    ADB  will  evaluate \nimplementation of KICB\u2019s business plan as well as the performance of the SME business prior \nto the disbursement of the second tranche.19  \n \nEvolving  Risk  Management.  KICB  is  taking  further  steps  to  further  strengthen  its \n25. \nunderwriting  and  SME  capacity  to  adapt  to  the  shift  in  focus  toward  SME  lending.  ADB\u2019s \ncapacity  development  TA  will  be  critical  to  help  strengthen  KICB\u2019s  SME  lending  practices  and \nsafeguard asset quality as the bank\u2019s business in this segment expands.  \n \n26. \nPolitical Risk. The Kyrgyz Republic continues to recover from the political crisis in 2010. \nThe shift to a parliamentary democracy has provided a unique opportunity to break with the past \nand strengthen governance and reform the economy. The political situation is improving and the \nelections were carried out peacefully.20GDP is projected to expand by 6% on average through \n2013 and the country\u2019s overall outlook is positive, assuming continued political stability.   \n \n27. \nSustainability  of  funding  for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  lending.  The \nKyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  banking  system  is  small  by  international  standards  and  the  local  capital \nmarkets  are  undeveloped.  This  limits  funding  sources  for  banks,  which  must  depend  on \ndeposits  and  financial  support  from  IFIs  such  as  ADB.  When  ADB\u2019s  loan  expires,  KICB  may \nneed to seek additional funding from external sources. KICB is increasing its deposit base and \nenjoys  support  from  strong  shareholders  and  other  IFIs.  The  lasting  impact  of  this  loan,  in \naddition to the funding enabling KICB to provide access to longer-term funding for the country\u2019s \nSMEs,  will  be  sustainable  development  of  KICB's  SME-lending  activities  in  the  future  through \nADB\u2019s capacity development TA.  \n \n28. \nForeign  Currency  Risk.  ADB\u2019s  investment  will  be  denominated  in  US  dollars  and,  as \nsuch,  there  will  be  an  element  of  foreign  exchange  risk.  The  primary  mitigation  for  this  risk  is \nthat  KICB\u2019s  functional  currency  is  the  US  dollar,  and  the  majority  of  its  financial  assets  and \nliabilities  are  denominated  in  dollars  (e.g.  75%  of  KICB  deposits  are  in  US  dollars).  KICB \nmitigates  this  risk  through  its  credit  assessment  process,  where  US  dollar  borrowers  are \nrequired to have at least 50% of their planned income in US dollars. \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n29. \nImpact. Increasing the SME sector\u2019s share in the economy will help contribute to broad-\nbased GDP growth. Supporting SME development by increasing access to finance as a result of \nthe positive demonstration effect from ADB\u2019s loan can help raise total employment, and lead to \ninclusive economic growth. \n \nOutcome. ADB\u2019s loan and capacity development TA is expected to help KICB establish \n30. \na  profitable  and  sustainable  SME  program  and  broaden  access  to  finance  for  previously \nunbanked SMEs.  \n \n\n                                                 \n18 NPL\u2019s as calculated by ADB. \n19 The second tranche is up to $5m. \n20 Presidential elections in the Kyrgyz Republic were held on 30 October 2011.  \n\n \n\n\f 8\n\n31. \nOutputs.  This  loan  will  provide  KICB  with  additional  funds  for  onlending  to  SMEs. \nOutputs  include  KICB  having  access  to  longer-term  funds  for  SME  onlending,  which  will \nincrease  its  lending  activities  to  this  sector.  Additional  output  of  this  project  will  be  product \ndevelopment in KICB, supported by TA from ADB. Reporting of sex-disaggregated data will be \nundertaken as appropriate. \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nStrategy 2020 identifies private sector development and private sector operations as one \n32. \nof  the  five  drivers  of  change  to  mobilize  resources  to  help  alleviate  poverty  in  the  region,  and  \nFSD  is  noted  as  one  of  the  five  operating  areas  that  will  be  undertaken  in  support  of  this \nagenda.21  The proposed investment is consistent with the government\u2019s  priorities and desires \nto  encourage  economic  growth,  broaden  access  to  finance,  address  low  private  sector \ninvestment, and reduce unemployment.22 Expanding access to finance via banks and increasing \nprivate sector investments with development impact potential is one of the objectives set forth in \nthe country operation business plan, 2011\u20132012.23 The project is consistent with Strategy 2020 \nand the country operations business plan as it will support private sector development through \nFSD  by  increasing  the  capacity  and  ability  of  KICB  to  expand  its  lending  activities  to  SMEs, \nwhich comprise an important and underserved portion of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s economy. The \nnew  3-year  country  partnership  strategy  is  currently  being  drafted  and  will  be  completed  in \n2012. Broadening access to finance through private sector interventions in the banking sector is \nexpected  to  continue  to  be  an  ongoing  priority  for  the  country.  ADB\u2019s  Investment  Climate \nImprovement Program,  subprogram 2, will include a component aimed at improving access to \nfinance.24   The  policy  reforms  to  be implemented  under  this loan  are  expected  to  complement \nthis project by increasing the capacity of financial institutions to provide finance to Kyrgyz firms. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n33. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  at  a  \u201cnascent\u201d  stage  of  FSD.  Under  the  PSCM  Business  Plan \nand  Priorities,  2010\u20132012,25 ADB\u2019s  response  is  to  assist  stronger  private  banks  with  loans, \nequity, and TA to support early movers. ADB intervention in such situations will likely involve a \nlong  process,  with  repeat  and  follow-on  loans  from  ADB  or  other  IFI  programs.  The  Financial \nSector Operational Plan26 calls for enhanced financial inclusion of the traditionally underserved, \nincluding  SMEs,  which  will  lead  to  inclusive  growth,  one  of  the  three  strategic  agendas  of \nStrategy 2020. It recognizes that the region\u2019s \u201cbase of the pyramid\u201d27 and SMEs have yet to gain \nadequate  access  to  financial  services.  The  plan  notes  that  capacity  building  for  participating \nintermediaries  and  end-borrowers  in  credit  assessment  should  be  supported.  This  project  will \nthus support FSD through expansion of access to finance for SMEs. \n \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB.  2008.

KICB\u2019s \nexisting  environmental  and  social  management  systems  (ESMS)  or  equivalent  systems  have \nbeen  reviewed,  areas  requiring  improvements  have  been  identified  and  effective  measures  to \naddress  them  are  laid  out  in  the  ESMS  arrangement.28 KICB  will  (i)  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited \ninvestment activities list, (ii) screen and exclude all projects that will have adverse environment \nand  social  safeguards  impacts,  (iii)  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds  abide  by \napplicable  national  laws  and  regulations,  and  (iv)  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). KICB will be assisted by ADB to enhance their ESMS, which is integrated in \ntheir  Credit  Department  Operations  Manual  and  (i)  incorporates  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment \nactivities  list  and  the  screening  and  reporting  procedures,  and  (ii)  complies  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). A revised operations manual will be submitted to ADB prior \nto  the  first  disbursement.  The  ESMS  will  include  arrangements  to  comply  with  national  labor \nlaws and ADB Social Protection Strategy (2001) to ensure adherence with core labor standards. \n \n35. \nSMEs owned or managed by women constitute more than 40% of the loan applications \nprocessed  and  approved  by  KICB  from  2007  to  2010.  KICB  will  continue  to  track  and  target \nmaintenance of this level of onlending to SMEs owned or managed by women until 2016. The \nKyrgyz Republic has ratified all conventions related to core labor standards, and KICB\u2019s annual \nreports  will  include  a  report  on  compliance  with  core  labor  standards  by  KICB  and  their \ncustomers that use ADB funds. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n36. \nKICB  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  and  its  policy  of  implementing \nbest  international  practice  relating  to  the  combating  of  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of \nterrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation between ADB and KICB includes \nappropriate anticorruption provisions and remedies for ADB in the event of non-compliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nThe  proposed  transaction,  once  approved  and  signed,  will  increase  ADB's  projected \n37. \nnonsovereign exposure by June 2012 to $7.52 billion. It will increase nonsovereign exposure to \nthe Kyrgyz Republic to $10 million or 0.13% of total nonsovereign exposure, increase exposure \nin the finance sector to $3.13 billion or 42% of total nonsovereign exposure, and the domestic \ncommercial  bank  subsector  to  $536.3  million  or  7.1%  of  total  nonsovereign  exposure.  The \nprojected  weighted  average  risk  rating  of  the  portfolio  (as  of  30  June  2012)  will  remain  at  6.5 \nafter inclusion of the $10 million loan to KICB. The proposed financing is within ADB\u2019s approved \nmedium-term,  country,  industry  single  obligor,  and  group  exposure  limits  for  nonsovereign \ninvestment. \n \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 29  the \n38. \nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic will  be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the \nproposed assistance to KICB.
