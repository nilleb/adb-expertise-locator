I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Second Rural Connectivity Investment \nProgram.1 The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Enhancing \nSustainability and Innovation in Rural Road Development, and if the Board approves the proposed \nMFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The  investment  program  will  improve  rural  connectivity  in  the  states  of  Assam, \nChhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal (the investment program states), \nfacilitating safer and more efficient access to livelihood and socioeconomic opportunities for the \nrural communities. 2 It will construct all-weather rural roads for the unconnected habitations and \nupgrade rural roads linking to the investment program states\u2019 district centers for an aggregate \nlength of 12,000 kilometers (km). For the investment in physical infrastructure to be effective and \nsustainable, the investment program will strengthen the institutional capacity of the implementing \nagencies on road safety and road maintenance.   \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.   Rationale \n3.  In India, rural roads comprise 80% of the overall road network, connecting rural habitations \nwith major district roads, state roads, and national highways. The magnitude of the rural road \nnetwork and its contribution in delivering inclusive economic growth in the country\u2019s rural area \nrequire continued engagement in the sector. The requirement of all-weather rural roads is \nessential for the last mile connectivity to enhance access to markets, health centers, education \nfacilities, and other socioeconomic opportunities. \n \n4.  Road map. The Government of India seeks to improve rural connectivity through the \nPrime Minister\u2019s Rural Road Program or Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). It is a \nnational flagship program, and is included in India\u2019s Three Year Action Agenda for FY2018\u2013\nFY2020.3 The first phase of the PMGSY (PMGSY-I) started in 2000 to provide basic connectivity \nfor  about  133,900  rural  habitations  in  all  states  by  constructing  rural  roads  to  all-weather \nstandards (531,500 km). So far in 2017, 513,000 km of rural roads (96.5%) have been built.4 The \nstates that have substantially completed PMGSY-I will be eligible to proceed to the second phase \nof the PMGSY (PMGSY-II), which plans to upgrade an additional 50,000 km to improve access \nto district centers and rural hubs.5 \n \n5.  Strategic context. Collectively, the PMGSY\u2019s main goals are to (i) reduce poverty faster \nfor more inclusive growth; (ii) expand rural infrastructure to accelerate agricultural growth and the \nrural economy; (iii) create more jobs; and (iv) enable social development to improve education, \nhealth, and social indicators. PMGSY-I started with a basic and inclusive goal: to provide essential \nconnectivity for all rural habitations. PMGSY-II is the next step: to enable mobility for self-\nemployment and livelihood opportunities. It does this by upgrading existing rural roads that meet \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA for the Second Rural Connectivity Investment \nProgram (TA 8828-IND).  \n3  Government of India, National Institution for Transforming India Aayog. 2017. India: Three Year Action Agenda, \n2017\u201318 to 2019\u201320. New Delhi.  \n4  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. http://omms.nic.in/Home/CitizenPage/ (accessed on 24 June 2017). \n5  So far, 7,700 km of rural roads have been upgraded under PMGSY-II.  ", "2 \ncertain criteria based on their economic potential and their role in facilitating such impacts. This \nprovides additional capacity for traffic, including larger vehicles, and enables safer and more \nefficient mobility of people and goods.6 To ensure sustainability of its strategic outcomes, PMGSY \nincludes a 5-year post construction maintenance provision included in the civil works contracts.  \n \n6.  Policy framework. The Ministry of Rural Development (MORD) has established the \nNational Rural Roads Development Agency (NRRDA) to manage the implementation of the \nPMGSY by the state governments. The NRRDA\u2019s tasks are to (i) oversee the technical aspects, \n(ii) conduct quality control and monitoring, and (iii) ease coordination between implementing \nagencies in the states. A program guideline is available to regulate (i) the selection and approval \nof subprojects to ensure effective use of funding, (ii) rural road maintenance, (iii) rural road safety, \nand (iv) funding flow between the central and state governments. Collectively, this institutional \nand  regulatory  set-up  have  been  recognized  as  a  sound  country  system  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and other development partners. However, ensuring the capacity of \nthe state governments to fully sustain the benefits is critical. This includes assuming responsibility \nfor conducting maintenance beyond the 5-year post-construction maintenance provision, and \nensuring road safety with suitable technical measures and community awareness campaigns. \n \n7.  Previous ADB assistance. Since 2003, ADB has provided assistance to PMGSY-I in the \ninvestment program states through loans totaling $1.15 billion, and constructed over 22,600 km \nof all-weather rural roads. These were completed satisfactorily and rated successful or highly \nsuccessful.7 In 2012, the first Rural Connectivity Investment Program (RCIP) using the MFF \nmodality was approved for $800 million to provide additional coverage under PMGSY-I for about \n9,000 km of all-weather rural roads in the investment program states.8 The first and the second \ntranches were substantially completed, and the third tranche is ongoing.9 By the end of the first \nRCIP, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh will have completed their scope for PMGSY-I, and \nready to proceed with PMGSY-II. The first RCIP also aims to strengthen institutional capacity to \nmanage rural roads in the investment program states. This entails establishing rural road network \nmanagement units (RRNMUs) for asset management and operation of the rural road networks, \nand rural connectivity training and research centers (RCTRCs) for staff training, knowledge \nmanagement, and research. Under the first RCIP, the implementing agencies have successfully \nestablished one pilot RRNMU and one RCTRC in each investment program state, equipped with \noperation manuals and procedures prepared under ADB\u2019s technical assistance.10 Using the \ninstitutional set-up of the pilot RRNMU as a model, the implementing agencies are currently \nestablishing another 25 RRNMUs to manage rural roads in the entire investment program states.  \n \n8.  The investment program. The proposed Second Rural Connectivity Investment Program \nwill encompass both PMGSY-I and PMGSY-II to improve about 12,000 km of rural roads in the \ninvestment program states. It will continue capacity development and build on the achievement \n                                                \n6  PMGSY-II roads will have a standard width of 5.50 meters, wider than that of PMGSY-I (3.75 meters). \n7  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nof the first RCIP by strengthening the operations of the 25 RRNMUs and RCTRCs to sustain rural \nroad maintenance and safety as required by the PMGSY guidelines. The investment program will \nallow continued assistance to the PMGSY and support the government\u2019s long-term goal for rural \ndevelopment. It will further strengthen the government\u2019s initiative toward achieving more inclusive \neconomic growth and is also closely aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 \nfor India.11 Lessons from the previous MMFs have been incorporated in the design: provision of \ndedicated road safety support for the RRNMUs in each state, and financing of consulting services \nby the governments to allow continuous technical supports for the entire investment program. \n \n9.  An MFF is proposed as the financing modality because it is suitable for a large-scale \ninvestment requiring long-term implementation period and involving a large number of subprojects. \nAn MFF allows a long-term partnership with the government for policy dialogue and capacity \ndevelopment. The NRRDA and the implementing agencies in the investment program states are \nfamiliar with the requirements and procedures of the MFF, and have a good track record of \nimplementing the PMGSY under the MFF modality from over 10 years of ADB assistance in the \nrural road sector. All subprojects under tranche 1 and the subsequent tranches will be of a similar \nnature. Subproject with safeguard category A will not be included. \n \n10.  Climate  change  adaptation.  Climate  risks  in  the  investment  program  states  are \nincreased intensity and frequency of rainfall, and storm surges in the states with coastal areas.  \nThe  inundation  and  flooding  of  roads,  slope  failure,  and  inadequate  capacity  of  drainage \nstructures are the program roads\u2019 key climate risks. The engineering design will include suitable \nadaptation measures such as greater elevation of road embankments in flood-prone and coastal \nareas, increased capacity of side and cross drains, and slope protection. The incremental cost for \nthe climate change adaptation measures in the investment program is about $28.33 million. \n \n11.  Innovative approach in rural road development. The investment program will support \nthe  government\u2019s  initiative  for  innovative  approaches  to  reducing  costs,  conserving  non-\nrenewable natural resources, and promoting the use of waste materials. This includes the use of \nalternative materials such as jute fiber for soil stabilization, and alternative construction methods \nsuch as asphalt cold-mixing for about 15% of the total length of rural roads in each investment \nprogram state. The implementing agencies will also explore other innovative approaches to \nensure the technical feasibility for future implementation. \n \n12.  Finance plus. The investment program will help bring about a transformational impact by \ninstitutionalizing  road  safety  and  road  maintenance  through  the  RRNMUs\u2019  and  RCTRCs\u2019 \noperations in the investment program states. The investment program will continue to help \ndevelop their institutional capacity to deliver the road maintenance and safety objectives, and to \noperate as an integral part of the respective state rural road development agencies (SRRDAs). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the investment program will be mobility and accessibility in India are \nimproved. The outcome will be rural connectivity in the investment program states improved. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The outputs of the investment program will be: (i) rural roads in the investment program \nstates improved, (ii) institutional capacity of PMGSY implementing agencies strengthened, and \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2017.

The physical component includes the \nconstruction of 12,000 km of roads in the investment program states, i.e., building all-weather \nrural roads for unconnected habitations, and upgrading rural roads linking to the state\u2019s district \ncenters. 12  The  capacity-strengthening  component  includes  providing  training  to  PMGSY \nengineers and giving support to RRNMUs and RCTRCs on road safety and road maintenance in \nthe investment program states. \n \n15.  Road safety. The implementing agencies, through the RRNMU operations, will carry out \nthe road safety audits (RSAs) on the program roads at the design, construction and operation \nstages, following the procedures set out in the Rural Road Safety Manual, which was developed \nunder ADB\u2019s TA (footnote 10). MORD approved the manual for application in the entire PMGSY. \nThe investment program will strengthen the RRNMUs to manage and conduct the RSAs. The \nRCTRCs will provide regular training on rural road safety to retain the skill sets within the \ninstitutions. \n \n16.  Sustainable  road  maintenance.  The  program  team  will  support  the  RRNMUs  in \nmanaging  road  maintenance  beyond  the  5-year  post-construction  maintenance  period  by \npreparing  and  implementing  a  systematic  road  maintenance  plan.  This  will  prioritize  the \nidentification of scope for road maintenance and the associated costs for financing by the \nrespective state government. \n \n17.  The first tranche of the investment program will deliver the following outputs:  \n(i)  Rural roads in the investment program states improved. This includes (a) \n3,145.67 km of rural roads constructed to all-weather standards under PMGSY-I \n(976.99 km in Assam; 1,571.28 km in Odisha; and 597.40 km in West Bengal); \nand (b) 3,108.59 km of rural roads upgraded under PMGSY-II (1,001.08 km in \nChhattisgarh and 2,107.51 km in Madhya Pradesh).  \n(ii)  Institutional capacity of the PMGSY implementing agencies strengthened. \nThe RCTRCs will conduct and manage the training programs for 2,000 PMGSY \nengineers, including the project implementation units (PIUs) and RRNMU staff, \npanchayat  raj  institution  staff,  as  well  as  consultants  and  contractors  in  the \ninvestment program states.13  \n(iii)  Operation and maintenance of the PMGSY roads sustained. This includes \ntechnical support for the RRNMUs to roll out RSAs and road maintenance. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n18.  The investment program is estimated to cost $1,225.26 million, including taxes and duties, \nphysical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 1). \n \n19.  The government has requested an MFF in an amount of up to $500 million from ADB's \nordinary capital resources to help finance a part of the investment program. The MFF will consist \nof two tranches, subject to the government's submission of related periodic financing requests, \nexecution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms \n                                                \n12 It consists of 2,000 km in Assam, 2,000 km in Chhattisgarh, 4,000 km in Madhya Pradesh, 3,000 km in Odisha, and \n1,000 km in West Bengal. \n13 A panchayat is a body of directly elected people responsible for development activities in an area. There are three \nlevels: gram panchayat at the village, intermediate panchayat at the block, and zilla panchayat at the district. These \nare collectively called the panchayat raj institution.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n22.  ADB will provide TA to strengthen the capacity of the implementing agencies in terms of \nroad maintenance, disaster resilience, and innovation. To achieve this objective, the project team, \nthrough the TA, will (i) support the RRNMUs to prepare and implement a systematic road \nmaintenance program, (ii) prepare disaster risk and vulnerability assessments in natural-disaster-\nprone areas, and (iii) engage with RCTRCs to identify and assess the feasibility of innovative \napproaches in rural road development.  \n \n23.  The TA is estimated to cost $720,000, of which $500,000 equivalent will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government \nwill provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office accommodation, office supplies, fees \nfor research organizations and academic institutions, testing materials, travel and logistics during \nsite visits, and other in-kind contributions. The executing agency of the TA will be MORD through \nthe NRRDA, and the implementing agencies will be the state governments through the respective \nSRRDAs. The TA will be implemented over 48 months, from January 2018 to December 2021. \nADB will recruit an international consulting firm and an individual expert as capacity-building \n ", "7 \nconsultants. The recruitment will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm will submit a biodata \ntechnical proposal, and the selection will be in accordance with the quality- and cost-based \nselection method, using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10.16 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n24.  The rural roads to be constructed or upgraded are selected on a priority basis following \nthe PMGSY-I and PGMSY-II guidelines.17 The rural road design follows the design criteria in line \nwith applicable Indian Road Congress regulations, particularly regarding road safety aspects.18 It \nalso considers site-specific information gathered during transect walks.19 ADB will recruit road \nsafety experts to support the RRNMUs in rolling out RSAs. The project implementation consultant \n(PIC) includes safeguard experts to ensure the proper incorporation of safeguard requirements in \nthe bidding documents. The technical support consultant (TSC) will monitor the implementation \nof the safeguard requirements and road safety requirements.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  Under PMGSY-I, the rural roads will be reconstructed or upgraded to bituminous surfaced \nroads with sufficient side and cross drains to provide safe all-year access to the habitations. Under \nPMGSY-II, the rural road upgrades include widening single-lane roads to intermediate-lane roads \nwhere  traffic  projections  indicate  the  need  for  capacity  augmentation.  The  program  team \nconducted economic analysis for tranche 1 on the sample roads in each state. The benefits \nconsidered in the analysis are: (i) vehicle operating costs savings for motorized vehicles, (ii) travel \ntime savings for passengers of motorized vehicles, (iii) value of equivalent energy savings for \nslow-moving vehicles, (iv) savings from avoided higher travel costs during rainy seasons in the \ncase of existing gravel or earthen roads, and (v) savings from reduced emissions valued in \nmonetary terms. The analysis indicated that, overall, the investment program is economically \nviable\u2014the economic internal rates of return range from 13.0% to 15.9% depending on the state, \nwhich is well above the acceptable rate of 9%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that, with a 10% \nincrease in capital costs or a 10% decrease in benefits, the overall investment program remains \neconomically viable. All-year access will bring several additional benefits to the villages, such as \ngreater crop diversification and less spoilage, an increase in land values, more educational \nopportunities, and better access to health facilities. These additional benefits are not included in \nthe economic analysis. The investment program includes an impact evaluation study that will \ncompare socioeconomic conditions of affected communities before and after the implementation \nof PMGSY-II in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. The results and recommendations from this \nstudy will be shared with the MORD to inform the planning for future investment. \n \n                                                \n16  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 A rural road to be built under PMGSY-I will connect a habitation with at least 500 residents in plain areas, or at least \n250 residents in hilly areas. A rural road to be upgraded under PMGSY-II is proposed by the state as part of a district \nrural road plan to be approved by MORD. Government of India, Ministry of Rural Development. 2015.

A transect walk is performed jointly by \nthe design consultant, the PIC, and PIU staff for each subproject road. \n ", "8 \n26.  The program will not generate revenue. The sustainability of rural roads constructed or \nupgraded  under  the  investment  program  is  ensured  through  the  5-year  post-construction \nmaintenance included in each civil works contract. After this period, road maintenance will be \nmanaged by the SRRDAs through the RRNMUs\u2019 operations. The state government will finance \nroad maintenance in accordance with the PMGSY guidelines (footnote 17). In 2016, the SRRDAs \nspent an aggregate amount of $306.16 million on the maintenance of PMGSY roads. The \nincremental recurring cost for the state governments of the rural roads built under tranche 1 are \nestimated to range from 2.6% to 6.0%. Observations during project preparation confirmed that \nthe rural roads that had benefited from the 5-year post-construction maintenance agenda were in \nreasonably good conditions. The investment program will support the RRNMUs in devising and \nimplementing a systematic road maintenance program to ensure the most effective maintenance. \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  Institutional. Each investment program state has established equivalents of the SRRDAs \nand field PIUs to manage PMGSY implementation. Since the start of the PMGSY in 2000, the \nSRRDAs have gained adequate implementation experience and strengthened staff qualifications. \nThe PIC will support the SRRDAs in implementing safeguard frameworks and RSAs. The NRRDA \nhas shown a good track record in providing technical supports to the SRRDAs and working with \nADB to monitor the overall project implementation. The TSC will support MORD and the NRRDA \nin overall due diligence and compliance monitoring. ADB and the NRRDA will recruit consulting \nservices to provide hands-on operational support to the newly established RRNMUs and RCTRCs \nin the investment program states. \n \n28.  Financial management. The fund flow from the central to the state governments will \nfollow the pattern of grants-in-aid under the centrally sponsored schemes of the government, and \nits relevant financial rules will apply. All states use the PMGSY\u2019s online management, monitoring, \nand accounting system for project accounting and reporting. The program team conducted a \nfinancial  management  assessment  of  the  SRRDAs,  covering  fund-flow  arrangements, \ngovernance, staffing, budgeting, accounting and financial reporting systems, internal control \nprocedures, financial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The \nassessment concluded that (i) the minimum required policies and procedures are in place, and \nthat (ii) the statutory audit function of the SRRDAs is currently carried out by an independent \nauditor appointed as per the PMGSY guidelines. The assessment also found that the overall \nfinancial management risk is moderate, and suggested mitigation measures for the key risks: \n(i) improve the records of financial transactions, (ii) ensure regular submission of reliable financial \nstatements, (iii) ensure reliable monitoring reports, and (iv) maintain the financial assets.20  \n \n29.  The SRRDAs will continue to maintain separate program records and accounts to identify \nthe financing resources received and expenditures under the program, ensuring an adequate \naudit trail. This will also lead to the review of the annual financial statements by an auditor \nacceptable to ADB, following auditing standards acceptable to ADB. \n \n30.  Procurement of civil works. The procurement of civil works will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). It will follow national \ncompetitive bidding procedures and use the standard bidding document used for the first RCIP \nas well as an electronic procurement system (e-procurement) that has been improved as needed, \n                                                \n20 The financial management assessment was carried out in 2016. Further details are in the FAM. \n ", "9 \nin agreement with ADB.21 The procurement procedures adopted under the investment program \nare detailed in the FAM (footnote 15). \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the central government and the governments of the investment program states. Specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  Poverty and social. The investment program states still lag behind various development \nindicators. The provision of all-weather roads in rural areas will be a key factor in reducing poverty. \nSpecifically, (i) farmers will benefit from better access to rural markets and stronger agricultural \nproductivity will increase their incomes, (ii) rural communities will be able to shift from subsistence \nfarming  to  more  commercially  oriented  agricultural  production,  (iii) production  of  high-value \nperishable products will be possible, (iv) poor households will be able to access better-paying \njobs outside their villages, (v) investments in nonagricultural enterprises will grow at a faster pace, \nand (vi) the investment program itself will create labor opportunities for the rural poor. \n \n33.  Gender and development. During preparation, the program team consulted more than \n14,130 women who participated in transect walks, representing about 27% of the total number of \nparticipants.  Gender  analysis  highlighted  several key  benefits,  which  the  all-weather roads \nconstructed under the investment program will bring, including an increase in the rate of safe child \ndeliveries, reduction in maternal and prenatal deaths and mortality of children, and increased \nenrollment of girls in schools and universities. The gender action plan prepared for tranche 1 \nincorporates several gender mainstreaming targets\u2014(i) participation of women in the transect \nwalks to be at least 20%; (ii) 100% of vulnerable households led by women and affected by the \ninvestment program to be identified and to directly benefit from appropriate mitigation measures, \nand/or to be linked to poverty alleviation and/or livelihood restoration programs; (iii) at least 33% \nof workers hired in road construction and road maintenance works to be women; and (iv) at least \n30% of members in the grievance redress committees are women. \n \n34.  HIV/AIDS and labor. The investment program\u2019s social assessments do not anticipate any \nrise in the incidence of HIV/AIDS. Each investment program state will ensure that works contracts \nfollow all applicable labor laws and regulations and include provisions requiring contractors to \nconduct HIV/AIDS awareness programs for those employed during road construction. The PIUs \nwill conduct close monitoring and, along with the contractors, will coordinate with the State AIDS \nControl Society on carrying out HIV/AIDS awareness programs. Core labor standards will be \nfollowed. Men and women will be paid equal wages for equal work. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  Environment. Tranche 1 is categorized as B in accordance with the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). None of the project roads will be located inside or near a protected or \nenvironmentally sensitive area. The program team prepared an environmental assessment and \nreview framework (EARF) for the MFF and initial environmental examination reports for each state \nfor tranche 1, which were disclosed on the ADB website. The predicted environmental impacts \nare minimal, temporary, and reversible since they relate mainly to occupational health and safety \nor to minor issues of dust, noise, and water pollution, which occur mostly during construction. The \nprogram team developed mitigation measures for all environmental impacts and integrated them \n                                                \n21 ADB approved the e-procurement for national competitive bidding in all investment program states in 2009\u20132011. \n ", "10 \nby incorporating a standard environmental management plan (EMP) in the bidding documents, \nand providing road-specific EMPs in the detailed project reports. The program team conducted \npublic consultations on all roads during transect walks, as required under the PMGSY guidelines. \nEnvironmental checklists prepared from the data collected on the transect walks were integrated \ninto the EMP to give proper guidance on site-specific issues. The environmental assessment of \nthe subsequent tranches will follow the same approach as used for tranche 1 and is given in the \nEARF. A grievance redress mechanism will manage the concerns of local stakeholders. The PIC \nwill  assist  the  safeguard  focal  person  at  each  SRRDA  in  supervising  the  contractor\u2019s \nimplementation of the EMP and preparing the required monitoring reports. The TSC will carry out \nexternal monitoring of environmental safeguards. The institutional capacities and arrangements \nshould therefore suffice to effectively implement the EARF, initial environment examinations, and \nEMPs. \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement. Tranche 1 is categorized as C in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Road construction or upgrades will be mostly within existing rights-\nof-way, with some cases of widening and minor realignments that will require narrow strips of land \nto be made available. In such cases, the voluntary land donation principle will apply, as it did in \nthe preceding ADB interventions. Activities under the investment program are not expected to \ninvolve involuntary resettlement, and the state government will ensure that no involuntary land \nacquisition takes place. In case of refusal to donate land, eminent domain will not take place, and \nthat the Safeguard Policy Statement will not be triggered. Specific procedural requirements \ninvolving comprehensive consultations with the communities are provided in the state-specific \ncommunity participation frameworks (CPFs), which are disclosed on the ADB website. The social \ndue  diligence  for  tranche  1  confirmed  that  the  communities  and  affected  individuals  were \nconsulted about the project roads. In accordance with the CPF, the program team conducted \ntransect walks for all project roads. Affected persons were made aware that they had the option \nto refuse land donation and, as a result, some of the road designs were slightly altered. The \nimplementing agencies conducted census surveys and identified 9,938 persons who donated \nland; 1,938 of them are considered vulnerable. Vulnerable affected individuals who do not benefit \nfrom government-sponsored poverty alleviation schemes will be linked to these programs through \nthe investment program. The surveys revealed that no physical relocation would result from the \nprogram, as impacts identified were minor\u2014affecting 5% or less of an individual\u2019s plot of land and, \nin rare instances, external sections of privately owned structures, which the panchayats will \nsupport in rebuilding. No affected person has fallen under the poverty line as a result of the \ndonations. The PIUs secured a memorandum of understanding with each affected individual, \nverified by a third party. A grievance redress committee was set up for each project road. For \nmore information, state-specific social compliance reports for the tranche 1 roads were disclosed \non the ADB website. \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples. Tranche 1 is categorized as C in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The social assessment identified the presence of scheduled tribes in all \ninvestment  program  states.  However,  these  groups  are  largely  assimilated  into  the  local \npopulation. The investment program will not have any differential impact on scheduled tribes\u2014 \nthey will receive similar benefits from the investment program as nonscheduled tribe households, \nand the impact on tribal and cultural identity will not be significant. All outputs will be delivered in \na culturally appropriate and participatory manner. To further mitigate the risks, the CPFs identify \nspecial provisions for all scheduled tribe households, ensuring that their living standards are not \nadversely affected because of land donation or in the event of any loss of nonland assets and \nimpacts on their livelihoods.  \n \n ", "11 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  The integrated benefits and impacts of the investment program are expected to outweigh \nthe costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.22  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLow response by contractors during  Advance contracting will be used.

ASSURANCES \n39.  The  Government  of  India  and  the  state  governments  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation of the program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n40.  The Government of India and the state governments have given ADB certain undertakings \nfor the MFF, which are set forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed \nby the Government of India and the state governments with respect to individual tranches under \nthe MFF are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the multitranche financing facility to India for the Second Rural Connectivity Investment \nProgram in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000,000, which \ncomprises the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with \ninterest and other terms to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; and is subject to such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the framework financing agreement presented \nto the Board.  \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n7 November 2017 \n \n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nMobility and accessibility in India improved (India: Three Year Action Agenda, 2017\u201318 to 2019\u201320)a \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with  Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nRural connectivity in  By 2024:  a\u2013b.
