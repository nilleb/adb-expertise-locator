The  INO-CS  is  to  be  provided  as  a  single  tranche \nloan  under \nthe  Asian \nthe  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  of \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Public sector management (economic and public \naffairs management) \nTheme (subtheme): Economic growth (promoting macroeconomic \nstability)  \nLocation impact: National (high) \n \nCategory C \n\nThe global crisis that intensified after September 2008 has affected the \nIndonesian economy in four related respects: (i) the first-round effects of \nthe  global  financial  crisis  had  repercussions  for  the  domestic  financial \nsector, leading to significant capital flight and exchange rate depreciation \nin  the  second  half  of  2008;  (ii)  the  second-round  effects  of  global \ndemand destruction have hurt the real economy, resulting in a slowdown \nin  economic  growth  from  the  fourth  quarter  (Q4)  of  2008  until  now; \n(iii) the  crisis  has  had  feedback  to  fiscal  policy,  resulting  in  a  decline  in \ntax  revenue  collection  and  a  wider  government  budget  deficit  than \ninitially planned, at a time of limited access to global credit markets; and \n(iv) \nin \nthreaten \nunemployment and poverty reduction.  \n\nthe  economic \n\nrecent  gains \n\nto  undo \n\nimpacts \n\nIn the context of the second-round effects on the real economy and the \nemerging  fiscal  constraint,  the  Government  of  Indonesia  has  requested \nADB to provide a countercyclical support loan of $500 million to support \nits  public  expenditure  program  for  2009.  The  request  for  financing \nstemmed from the Government\u2019s concerns to ensure predictability in its \nbudget  financing,  given  the  necessity  for  a  temporary  fiscal  stimulus \nwithin  its  medium-term  fiscal  program.  The  Government  projects  gross \nfinancing requirements for 2009 at $24.5 billion, including domestic and \nexternal debt that matures in 2009. Net financing (after amortization) for \n2009 is projected at $13.6 billion, of which 64% will need to be raised in \nthe  second  half  of  2009.  Therefore,  the  INO-CS  will  provide  additional \nfinancing  to  the  Government  for  its  larger  fiscal  stimulus  in  2009  and \n2010. This will allow the Government to stimulate an economic recovery, \nprotect  its  social  spending  and  poverty  alleviation  programs,  and \ncontinue with its longer-term development objectives in 2009 and 2010.   \n\nThe Government\u2019s fiscal policy response to the economic slowdown has \nbeen swift and broadly effective. Like most other developing economies, \nthe  national  government  budget  does  not  have  automatic  stabilizers \n\n \nBorrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nClassification \n\nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\nThe Program \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \nii \n \n\n \nObjective, Scope, \nand Coverage of \nLoan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\ninfrastructure  projects, \n\nembedded  on  the  expenditure  side  of  the  budget.  Therefore,  with  the \neconomy  quickly  decelerating  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008,  it  was \nnecessary for the Government to announce an additional countercyclical \nfiscal  program  in  February  2009  to  compensate  for  the  fall  in  private \nconsumption  and  investment  and  focusing  on  tax  relief,  carrying  over \n2008 \nincreasing  capital  spending  and \nmaintenance, expanding flagship social assistance programs, and policy \nmeasures to speed up disbursements of critical public spending. Overall, \nthe  Government's  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus  amounts  to  about \nRp113 trillion.  \n \nADB  staff  estimates  that  without  this  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus \npackage,  economic  growth  would  be  between  2.0%  and  3.0%  in  2009. \nADB  staff  estimates  also  show \ninformal  employment  and \nunemployment  could  rise  by  more  than  1.8  million  persons.  Poverty \ncould  also  increase  by  about  3  million\u20134 million  persons  or  about  1\u20132 \npercentage  points  of  the  population\u2014reversing  recent  gains  in  poverty \nreduction.  \n\nthat \n\nto  debt  and \n\nThe  INO-CS  is  anchored  by  ADB\u2019s  existing  Development  and  Policy \nSupport  Program  (DPSP)  series.  Under  the  DPSP  series,  reform \nmeasures  relating \nfiscal  policy  management  have \ncontributed  considerably  to  lower  levels  of  debt  to  GDP  and  a \nconsiderable  increase  in  non-oil  tax  revenues.  Rating  agencies  have \nalso cited debt reduction and the Government\u2019s commitment to reforms, \nincluding changes to the investment law, customs and tax reforms, and \nfiscal  reforms\u2014all  activities  supported  by  the  DPSP\u2014as  the  reason  for \nrecent  sovereign  rating  upgrades.  Policy  actions  supported  under  the \ninvestment  climate  have  led  to  significant  improvements  in  business \nstart-up times, value-added tax (VAT) refund times, and establishment of \na  sounder  and  sustainable  financial  safety  net.  Important  steps  were \nalso  established  to  help  lay  the  groundwork  for  improving  poverty \ntargeting  of  basis  services.  As  the  2005  fuel  price  hike  made  available \nmore  funds  for  social  spending,  the  DPSP  series  supported  building \ncapacity \nto  create  a  more  evaluative \ninstitutional  framework  that  would  improve  the  targeting  of  these \nreleased  funds.  Lessons  from  targeting  were  incorporated  into  the \nreactivated cash transfer program that accompanied the May 2008 fuel \nprice increase. \n \nThe  objective  of  the  INO-CS  loan  is  to  provide  support  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s countercyclical spending program for 2009 and therefore \nensure predictability in its budget financing, given limited market access \nand  the  need  for  a  temporary  fiscal  expansion.  This  will  allow  the \nGovernment  to  stimulate  the  economic  recovery  in  2009  and  2010, \nprotect  its  social  spending  and  poverty  alleviation  programs  and \nobjectives, and continue with its longer term development objectives.   \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $500,000,000  under  the \nINO-CS  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n\nin  government \n\ninstitutions \n\n\f \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n \nCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \nExecuting Agency   Ministry of Finance (MOF)  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\niii \n\n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  plus  200  basis  points  (bps);  a  5-year \nterm,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. \n \nThe  period  specified  for  the  INO-CS  will  be  from  1  September  2009  to \n31 December  2010,  with  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $500  million  to  be \ndisbursed  when  the  Government  has  met  the  conditions  for  loan \neffectiveness. \n \nThe Government will use the local currency counterpart funds generated \nby  the  loan  proceeds  to  help  maintain  current  social  expenditure  and \ninfrastructure spending. \n \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nINO-CS \n\nfor  Economic  Affairs  have  established \n\nthe  Government's \nfocal \nthe \n\n \nMOF will be the Executing Agency to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate \nimplementation  of \nthe  Government\u2019s  countercyclical  expenditure \nprogram  supported  by  the  loan.

The  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed  to  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements \nfor Program Loans. \n \nThe INO-CS will provide significant benefits and have a positive impact \non the economy and the poor because of the following:  \n\n(i)  Higher  infrastructure  spending  will  generate  long-term  growth, \n\nstimulate investment, create jobs, and raise incomes. \n\n(ii)  The  INO-CS  will  help  close  the  budget  financing  gap  within  a \nthereby  supporting  economic \n\nfiscal  program, \n\nmedium-term \ngrowth and macroeconomic stability. \n\nThe  loan  supplements  financing  from  other  ADB  programs  such  as  the \nproposed  the  Fifth  Development  Policy  Support.  The  DPSP  is  firmly \nembedded in the Government\u2019s national medium-term development plan \n(RPJM)  \n \nRisks include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\nThe global financial crisis has hurt Indonesia. A prolonged global \n\n \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n\frecession will place further stress on the fiscal situation and the \nbudget  financing  gap.  A  weakening  economy  and  increased \nstress  in  the  labor  market  will  result  in  increased  poverty \nincidence  in  2009.  However,  this  will  be  partially  offset  through \nsocial  assistance  programs  and  the  increase  of  infrastructure \ndevelopment in 2009 and 2010. \n\n(ii)  The  absorptive  capacity  of  key  spending  agencies  may  be \nstretched,  affecting  the  timeliness  and  effectiveness  of  the \ncountercyclical  expenditure  program.  The  Government  has \nintroduced  several  policy  measures  to  expedite  disbursements \nand this will mitigate some of these constraints. \n\n(iii)  Some  social  assistance  programs  and \n\ninfrastructure  are \nvulnerable  to  leakages,  poor  targeting,  and  corruption.  The \nGovernment is committed to addressing these problems through \ninstruments  such  as  public  financial  reforms,  enhancement  in \nprocurement  practice,  and  its  anticorruption  and  anti-money-\nlaundering efforts.  \n\n \niv \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Countercyclical  Support.  The  development  policy  letter \nconfirming  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  implement  its  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus \nprogram and its medium-term development program is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nREQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE                                            \nCOUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY \n\n2. \nThe  proposed  loan  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  (CSF)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) comes at a critical time for Indonesia. 1  It is designed to maintain the \nmomentum  of  its  economic  recovery  and  key  development  efforts  at  a  challenging  time  of \nlimited access to global financial markets and the first global recession since World War II. The \nglobal crisis that intensified after September 2008 has affected the Indonesian economy in four \nrelated respects: (i) the first-round effects of the global financial crisis had repercussions for the \ndomestic financial sector, leading to significant capital flight and exchange rate depreciation in \nthe second half of 2008; (ii) the second-round effects of the sharp contraction in global demand \nhave hurt the real economy, resulting in a slowdown in economic growth from the fourth quarter \n(Q4) of 2008 until now; (iii) the crisis has had feedbacks to fiscal policy, resulting in a decline in \ntax revenue collection and a wider government budget deficit than initially planned, at a time of \nlimited access to global credit markets; and (iv) the economic impact of the global financial crisis \nthreatens to undo recent gains in unemployment reduction and poverty reduction.  \n\nGiven the second-round effects on the real economy and the emerging fiscal constraint, \n3. \nthe  Government  of  Indonesia  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  countercyclical  support  loan  of \n$500  million  to  support  its  public  expenditure  program  for  the  second  half  of  2009  and  2010. \nThe  request  for  financing  stemmed  from  the  Government\u2019s  concerns  about  ensuring \npredictability in its budget financing, given the necessity for a temporary fiscal stimulus in 2009 \nand its continuation in 2010. The Government projects gross financing requirements for 2009 at \n$24.5  billion,  including  domestic  and  external  debt  that  matures  in  2009.  Net  financing  (after \namortization)  for  2009  is  projected  at  $13.6  billion,  of  which  64%  will  need  to  be  raised  in  the \nsecond half of 2009 (Table 4). Therefore, the INO-CS will provide additional official financing to \nthe Government for its larger fiscal stimulus in 2009 and 2010, while the costs of servicing the \nexisting debt are also projected to rise. The Government has met the access criteria under the \nCountercyclical Support Facility (Appendix 2). \n\n4. \nAdverse effects of the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis has adversely \naffected the economy. This impact is manifested in several ways. While domestic consumption \ngrowth  remained  positive  in  the  first  semester  of  2009,  partly  supported  by  the  Government\u2019s \neffective fiscal stimulus, economic growth weakened to 4.0% in Q2 2009 from 4.4% in Q1, and \nis projected to weaken further in the second semester compared with 6.1% economic growth in \n2008. The  contraction  in  exports  of  27%  in  the  first  semester  of  2009  and  collapse  in  foreign \ndirect investment were the key factors behind this sharper than expected economic slowdown.2 \nIndonesia is also experiencing temporary fiscal stress because of the economic slowdown. Tax \nrevenues declined by 6.2% in the first semester of 2009 over the same period in 2008 and non-\ntax revenue (primarily natural resource revenues) declined by 33% over the same period.

Manila.  \n\nand softening domestic demand. \n\n \n\n\finterest costs are now projected to rise by an additional $1 billion in the revised 2009 national \ngovernment budget because of higher interest rates on government debt issuances. The 2009 \nnational  government  budget  deficit  is  now  projected  to  widen  from  the  original  programmed \ndeficit of 1.0% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 2.5% of GDP, which is still relatively low by \ninternational standards, reflecting the Government\u2019s prudent fiscal stance.  \n \n5. \nSound  macroeconomic  management.  The  Government  has  maintained  sound \nmacroeconomic  management  and  introduced  preemptive  measures  to  manage  the  increased \ndownside  risks  to  the  domestic  financial  sector  and  external  position.  This  is  reflected  in  an \nimprovement in the external balance, with gross international reserves equivalent to 6 months of \nimport  cover  and  servicing  of  official  external  debt,  a  low  inflation  environment,  and  a  sound \nbanking sector. The Government has operated a prudent fiscal policy for the last several years, \nwhich has resulted in a continuous decline in Indonesia\u2019s public debt\u2013GDP ratio from over 55% \nin 2004 to around 32% at the end of 2008. \n \n6. \nPrudent fiscal response. The Government\u2019s fiscal response to the crisis has been swift \nand  effective.  It  announced  a  countercyclical  spending  program  in  February  2009.  The \ncountercyclical program focuses on (i) providing substantial tax cuts to boost household income \nand payroll tax relief to firms operating in labor-intensive industries to protect jobs, (ii) expanding \ncapital  expenditure  and  carrying  over  the  2008  infrastructure  projects,  increasing  capital \nmaintenance and material spending, and (iii) scaling up key social assistance programs. \n \n7. \nFiscal  space  and  debt  sustainability.  In  the  context  of  its  debt  level,  the \ncountercyclical  spending  program  is  expected  not  to  adversely  affect  debt  sustainability  as  a \nlarge proportion of the 2009 budget stimulus is temporary in nature. A cross country comparison \ndrawing on IMF publications indicates that Indonesia is well placed to sustain its debt at prudent \nlevels (Appendix 9 Table A9.2). A more recent IMF country study finds that a primary surplus of \n0.3% of GDP will stabilize debt below 30% of GDP (Appendix 4).  \n \n8. \nDonor  coordination.  The  INO-CS  is  an  outcome  of  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment  and  coordination  with  development  partners  under  existing  loan  programs  to \nIndonesia, and complements the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP)3 and the Public \nExpenditure Support Facility (PESF).4 The DPSP is a series of five annual, single-tranche loans \nsupporting  the  development  policy  agenda  of  the  Government  as  envisioned  in  the  national \nmedium-term  development  plan  (RPJM),  and  cofinanced  with  the  World  Bank  and  the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  cluster  aims  to  help  the  Government  achieve  its  medium-term \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  objectives  through  four  core  policy  areas:  (i) macroeconomic \nstability  and  creditworthiness  through  continued  monitoring  of  macroeconomic  indicators; \n(ii) improving the investment climate  through regulatory reforms, tax and customs reforms, and \nstrengthening financial sector and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) access to finance; \n(iii) improving public financial management and governance by strengthening budgeting, internal \ncontrol  systems,  transparency  and  procurement,  and  civil  service  reform;  and  (iv)  improving \ndelivery  of  public  services  to  the  poor  through  pro-poor  targeting  of  public  programs  and \nstrengthening community-driven development. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008.

Policy  actions  supported  under  the  investment  climate  have  led  to  significant \nimprovements \ntimes,  and \nestablishment  of  a  sounder  and  sustainable  financial  safety  net.  Important  steps  were  also \ntaken to help lay the groundwork for improving poverty targeting of basis services. As the 2005 \nfuel  price  hike  made  available  more  funds  for  social  spending,  the  DPSP  series  supported \nbuilding capacity in government institutions to create a more evaluative institutional framework \nthat  would  improve  the  targeting  of  these  released  funds.  Lessons  from  targeting  were \nincorporated  into  the  reactivated  cash  transfer  program  that  accompanied  the  May  2008  fuel \nprice increase.  \n \n10. \nIn  response  to  global  financial  market  failure  in  September  2008  and  subsequently \nIndonesia\u2019s  restricted  access  to  credit  markets  at  that  time,  development  partners  (ADB,  the \nGovernment of Australia, the Government of Japan, and the World Bank) approved the PESF. \nAs  a  stand-by  loan  facility,  its  key  objective  is  to  provide  insurance  in  the  event  that  global \nfinancial  markets  fail  again  as  in  Q3  2008.  The  access  conditions  to  the  funds  include  an \ninability  to  meet  specified  quarterly  financing  targets  within  agreed  market  access  conditions \nand the continued maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework. Since then, \nglobal financial markets have begun to stabilize. Therefore, it is projected that the PESF funds \nwill  not  be  disbursed  in  2009  as  market  conditions  improve  relative  to  September  2008.  The \nfor  crisis-related  policy  dialogue  between \nPESF  established  a  structured  mechanism \ndevelopment  partners  and  the  Government.  It  also  established  a  macroeconomic  monitoring \nmechanism  through  which  quarterly  reports  and  meetings  between  the  Government  and \ndevelopment  partners  are  held.  This  mechanism  will  be  used  to  monitor  the  macroeconomic \nperformance  under  the  INO-CS  (paras.  47\u201351).  The  formulation  of  the  INO-CS  has  greatly \nbenefited from this consultative and monitoring process, as it has been an invaluable vehicle for \nproviding the Government with input on its countercyclical fiscal program, additional measures \nto mitigate the increased downside risks to the macro economy, and ways to strengthen poverty \nmonitoring and coordination efforts (Appendix 7).   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE GLOBAL CRISIS AND COUNTRY CONTEXT \n\n \nA. \n\nThe  Global  Crisis  and  its  Impact  on  the  Indonesian  Economy,  Employment,  and \nPoverty \n\n \n11. \nThe global economic downturn, triggered by the collapse of the US subprime mortgage \nmarket, has turned into one of the sharpest global economic recessions in modern history. Most \ndeveloped  economies  are  in  deep  recession  in  2009,  and  the  pace  of  economic  growth  in \ndeveloping countries has declined significantly, and in some cases has become negative. The \nlatest International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections suggest that economic growth in developed \ncountries this year will contract by 3.8%. The volume of world trade is expected to fall by 12.2% \nand foreign direct investment is estimated to fall by about 30% from 2008 levels. The IMF also \nprojects  that  the  global  economy  will  only  moderately  recover  next  year,  as  financial  market \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nstabilization  will  take  longer  than  previously  envisioned.  Developing  countries\u2019  access  to \ninternational credit markets will remain curtailed as a consequence. 5 \n \n12. \nFirst-round  effects  of  the  global  financial  crisis. Spillovers from the global financial \ncrisis on the Indonesian financial sector\u2014mainly equity markets and the balance of payments\u2014\nwere particularly severe in Q4 2008 and more so than in most other regional economies. Equity \nprices  fell  by  50%  and  investors  unbundled  financial  portfolios,  resulting  in  a  decline  of \n$6.5 billion in gross international reserves in Q4 and a 31% depreciation in the rupiah exchange \nrate  from  November  2008  to  February  2009.  Spillovers  to  the  domestic  banking  system  have \nbeen relatively muted because of the limited exposure to troubled US assets, and low exposure \nto  securitization  and  off-balance  sheet  activities.  The  banking  system  remains  sound,  with  a \ncapital asset ratio of 17% and gross nonperforming loans at under 5% as of June 2009.    \n  \n13. \nHowever,  the  global  credit  crunch  that  started  in  mid-2008  and  intensified  in  Q4  2008 \nhurt  the  Indonesian  economy  by  making  access  to  international  and  domestic  credit  markets \nmore  expensive  for  both  the  public  and  private  sectors.  Yields  on  Indonesian  domestic  bonds \npicked  up  since  mid-2008  and  spiked  sharply  in  October  to  as  high  as  20%,  and  spreads \non  Indonesia\u2019s international bond surged by about 650 basis points (bps) (Figure 1e). This was \ndue to a rapid increase in domestic lending of about 30%, in part attributable to the squeeze on \nUS  dollar  lines,  and  capital  outflow  and  the  associated  rupiah  exchange  rate  depreciation. \nElevated  risk  perceptions  about  the  Indonesian  financial  sector  and  economy  have  limited \nIndonesia\u2019s access to international credit markets and raised the cost of borrowing.  \n \n14. \nSecond-round  effects  of  global  demand  destruction.  Indonesia  is  experiencing  the \nsecond-round  effects  of  the  global  economic  downturn.  Initially,  it  seemed  the  impact  of  the \nglobal downturn on Indonesia\u2019s growth conditions was moderate. Economic growth was 5.5% in \nQ4 2008 and a respectable 4.4% in Q1 2009. The latest economic data from the Central Bureau \nof Statistics indicate that the economy is weakening, with growth at 4.0% in Q2 2009 on a year-\non-year  basis.  Moreover,  the  data  show  that  public  expenditure  on  goods  and  services  has \nbeen  the  main  engine  of  growth  in  the  first  semester  of  2009,  followed  by  household \nconsumption, benefiting from one-off election spending and tax cuts implemented as part of the \nstimulus package. Private consumption and investment growth are weakening and exports have \nseverely  contracted  (Figure  1a).  As  a  consequence  a  negative  output  gap  (actual  economic \ngrowth below potential growth) of between 3.0% and 4.0% has emerged in 2009 (Figure 1b). In \nJanuary  2009,  year-on-year  export  values  had  fallen  about  36%.  Although  the  rate  of  decline \nhas slowed, export values are still down by 27% in June 2009 on a year-on-year basis. Import \nvalues have also contracted by 36% in the first half or 2009 because of lower commodity prices \non resource exports, declining imports of components for the export sector and falling domestic \ndemand. Inflow of remittances also declined by 15% from $1.3 billion in Q4 2008 to $1.1 billion \nin Q2 2009 suppressing incomes of poorer families reliant on remittances. ADB staff estimates \nthat without the fiscal stimulus package implemented in the first half of 2009, economic growth \nwould have been between 2.0% and 3.0% (Appendix 3).   \n \n15.  With  this  background,  the  Government  revised  its  macroeconomic  framework  in  June \n2009  and  now  projects  growth  of  4.3%  for  2009  with  higher  unemployment  and  poverty.  The \nIMF  and  ADB  staff  project  economic  growth  at  3\u20134%  for  2009  because  of  suppressed  export \ngrowth  and  falling  investments.  However,  because  of  lower  trade  intensity,  Indonesia\u2019s \nvulnerability  to  export  fluctuations  is  less  than  its  neighbors.  These  projections  translate  to \n\n                                                 \n5   International Monetary Fund. 2009.  World Economic Outlook Update: Contractionary Forces Receding But Weak \n\nRecovery Ahead. Washington, DC (July). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n  \n\nreduced  per  capita  incomes  from  about  4.5%  in  2008  to  1.5%-2.8%  in  2009.  Past  experience \nwith these lower growth rates suggest adverse effects for employment generation and poverty \nreduction (para. 17). \n \nThe  global  financial  crisis  and  economic  downturn  affects  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \n16. \nposition  in  three  ways.  First,  the  tight  liquidity  in  global  credit  markets  and  elevated  risk \npremiums  on  Indonesian  sovereign  debt  have  increased  the  cost  of  financing  the  budget  and \nrefinancing public debt. The government finances have been especially vulnerable because of \nthe country\u2019s large gross financing needs. During normal market conditions, Indonesia was able \nto  raise  a  sufficient  amount  (in  the  range  of  $12  billion\u2013$13  billion)  from  domestic  and \ninternational  markets  in  2007  and  2008.  Tighter  global  liquidity  and  higher  risk  premiums \ncombined  with  high  gross  financing  needs  have  raised  interest  rates  on  Indonesian  debt \ncompared  with  other  economies  in  the  region.  Consequently,  debt  interest  costs  are  now \nprojected to rise by an additional $1 billion in the revised 2009 budget. Second, with weakening \neconomic growth, the Government needs to provide a fiscal stimulus in 2009 and 2010. Third, \nthe collapse in commodity prices and a slowing economy have resulted in a decline in budget \nrevenues of about 13.6% in the first semester of 2009 over the same period in 2008. Income tax \ncollections  have  declined  4.5%,  customs  collection  declined  by  16.5%,  and  non-tax  collection \n(including  resource  revenues)  declined  by  33%  (Figure  1f).  Tax  cuts  as  part  of  the  fiscal \nstimulus  also  contributed  to  the  decline  in  tax  revenue  collection  in  2009.  As  a  result  of \nincreased spending and decline in budget revenues, the 2009 budget deficit is now projected to \nwiden from the original programmed deficit of 1.0% to 2.5% of GDP, which is still relatively low \nby international standards reflecting the Government\u2019s prudent fiscal stance. It is programming a \nbudget  deficit  of  1.6%  of  GDP  for  2010  to  maintain  the  fiscal  stimulus,  given  the  projected \nfurther weakening of the economy.  \n \n17. \nfallen  by  about \n1 percentage point per year since 2003, reaching 17.8% in 2006, and falling further to 14.2% in \nearly  2009.  However,  poverty  remains  a  serious  problem  in  absolute  terms  in  Indonesia  with \nover  35  million  people  below  the  national  poverty  line  and  another  42%  of  the  population \nvulnerable  to  falling  into  poverty  if  their  circumstances  suddenly  deteriorate.  Indicative  of  this \nvulnerability  to  poverty,  the  labor  market  has  severely  weakened  in  recent  months.  Figure  1d \ndescribes rising labor market stress in 2009. Four years of solid economic growth generated 2.7 \nmillion formal jobs (defined as regular wage jobs) from 2005 to 2008, of which 1.6 million were \ncreated  in  2008.  Coinciding  with  robust  employment  growth  was  a  continuous  decline  in \nunemployment from 11.5% of the labor force in 2003 to 8.1% in 2008. According to the latest \nhousehold  labor  survey  carried  out  in  February  2009,  employers  have  significantly  reduced \nhiring activity, with only about an additional 400,000 formal jobs created from February 2008 to \nFebruary 2009. On the other hand, the informal sector continues to expand with more than an \nadditional 2 million workers now engaged in informal activities (defined as casual workers, self-\nemployed,  and  unpaid  family  workers).  The  Government  is  concerned  that  the  current  global \nfinancial crisis will have adverse effects on its efforts to reduce poverty if there is a significant \nreduction in economic growth, retrenchments, and shrinking employment opportunities. Recent \nretrenchment  data  from  the  Department  of  Manpower  and  Transmigration  point  to  increased \nlayoffs,  particularly  in  the  export  sector.  Based  on  the  current  low  growth  scenario  of  3\u20134.% \ngrowth  for  2009,  ADB  staff  estimates  that  only  about  half  a  million  formal  jobs  would  be \ngenerated  and  informal  employment  and  unemployment  would  rise  by  more  than  1.5  million \npersons.  ADB  staff  estimates  also  show  that  without  the  fiscal  stimulus  informal  employment \nand unemployment could have risen by more than 1.8 million persons. Poverty could have also \nincreased  by  about  3  million\u20134 million  persons  or  about  1\u20132  percentage  points  of  the \npopulation\u2014reversing recent gains in poverty reduction.  \n\nPoverty  alleviation  and  employment.  The  poverty  rate  has \n\n \n\n\fThe Government's Macroeconomic Management \n\nB.  \n \n18. \nAppropriate  and  responsive  policy. The Government\u2019s macroeconomic policy stance \nto the increased downside risks to the economy from the global crisis has been appropriate and \nresponsive.  Stability  is  reflected  in  the  improvement  of  key  macroeconomic  indicators.  On  the \nexternal  side,  earlier  concerns  about  external  risks  to  the  balance  of  payments  arising  from \ncorporate  rollover  and  domestic  resident  capital  outflows  did  not  materialize.  Foreign  reserves \nhave  stabilized  since  November  2008  to  $57.9  billion  at  the  end  of  August  2009,  sufficient  to \ncover 6 months of imports. Conventionally, at least 3 months of import coverage is considered a \nsufficient buffer against modest shocks to the balance of payments. On the monetary side, Bank \nIndonesia has broadly operated an appropriate monetary policy stance throughout the crisis. In \nearly 2008, it raised interest rates to counter the threat of second-round inflationary pressures \narising from the surge in global commodity prices. It then shifted to an expansionary monetary \nposition  at  the  end  of  2008  to  provide  sufficient  liquidity  to  the  banking  system  against  the \nbackdrop  of  rapidly  falling  inflation.  Inflation  fell  to  2.7%  (year-on-year)  in  July  2009,  from  its \npeak of 12.1% in August 2008. Inflation is expected to remain benign for the rest of this year, \nindicative of the slump in domestic economic activity and lower commodity prices.  \n \n19. \nThe  Government\u2019s  response  to  mitigating  the  risk  of  the  global  financial  crisis  on  the \nIndonesian  economy  was  swift  and  involves  a  number  of  proactive  measures  aimed  at \nreassuring confidence in the domestic financial sector, increasing liquidity in the banking system, \nand strengthening Bank Indonesia\u2019s lender of last resort facility. To maintain the confidence and \nstability of the financial system, the Government (i) issued a financial safety net regulation that \nclearly  establishes  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and  procedures  that  govern  the  actions  and \nresponses of Bank Indonesia, the minister of finance, and the Deposit Insurance Corporation in \nthe  event  of  the  failure  of  a  financial  institution;  (ii)  strengthened  the  role  of  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s \nlender of last resort facility by allowing banks to borrow in the short term from the central bank, \nbacked  up  by  high  quality  assets  such  as  government  bonds  and  Bank  Indonesia  Certificate; \n(iii) increased coverage of the deposit insurance scheme; and (iv) eased liquidity in the banking \nsector  through  monetary  expansion.  Policy  measures  on  the  latter  include  gradually  cutting \nBank  Indonesia  policy  rates  from  9.5%  in  December  2008  to  6.5%  by  August  2009,  injecting \nrupiah  liquidity  through  repurchase  agreements,  and  reducing  the  reserve  requirement  for \nforeign  currency  deposits.  With  these  proactive  measures  in  place,  indicators  show  signs  of \nimprovement.  Bank  liquidity  eased  at  the  end  of  2008,  and  growth  in  bank  lending  started  to \npick  up  to  about  16%  in  the  first  semester  of  2009  on  a  year-on-year  basis;  the  stock  market \nand the rupiah exchange rate recovered ground since December 2008; and yields on short-term \ndomestic  bonds  have  declined,  although  yields  on  medium-  and  longer-term  bonds  remain \nelevated indicating a steeper yield curve compared to prior the global financial crisis.  \n \n20. \nTo  strengthen  the  external  position,  the  Government  arranged  multilateral  and  bilateral \nswap arrangements to gain ability to call for more foreign reserves when needed. For example, \nIndonesia has access to a $14.6 billion swap facility with the People\u2019s Republic of China. In this \ncontext  of  slowing  exports  and  waning  market  confidence,  Bank  Indonesia  has  activated  its \nrediscount window for trade receivables and the Government has established an export\u2013import \nfinancing  agency  that  would  provide  different  trade  finance  products,  including  export  credit \nguarantees, as well as a mandate to support diversification of export markets and SMEs\u2019 access \nto trade finance.  \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 1: Key Economic indicators \n \n(a)  Economic Growth in 2009 by Major Expenditure Group     (b)  Potential and Actual Economic Growth \n(1980 \u20132009)                                   \n\nh\nt\n\n30\n\n10\n\n20\n\n        (% first semester growth year-on-year)                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nC\no\nn\ns\nu\nm\np\nt\ni\n\nc\no\nn\ns\nu\nm\np\nt\ni\n\nE\nx\np\no\nr\nt\ns\n\nm\np\no\nr\nt\ns\n\nI\nn\nv\ne\ns\nt\n\nm\ne\nn\nt\n\nw\no\nr\ng\n\nv\na\nt\ne\n\n2009\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\nP\nu\nb\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\no\nn\n\no\nn\n\n%\n\nP\n\nr\ni\n\n0\n\nc\n\n \n\nI\n\ni\n\nl\n\n9\n\n7\n\n5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n-1\n1981\n-3\n\n-5\n\n1983\n\n1985\n\n1987\n\n1989\n\n1991\n\n1993\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2005\n\n2007\n\n2009\n\nActual Growth\n\nPotential growth\n\n      (c)  Export and Import Growth (year-on-year) \n                   \n\n             \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n   (d) Changes in Employment and Unemployment \n \n\n  (in number of persons) \n\nt\n\n \n\nh\n\n0\n\n \n\n%\n\n0.0\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n300\n\n500\n\n40.0\n\n80.0\n\n20.0\n\n60.0\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n-500\n\n-40.0\n\n-20.0\n\n-60.0\n\n3000\n\n1500\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\nw\no\nr\ng\n\n-1000\n\n-1500\n\n \n \n\n)\ny\no\ny\n(\n \n\nExports\n\nImports\n\n2008-09\n\n2007-08\n\n2005-07\n\nJan-07\n\nJan-05\n\nJan-09\n\nJan-06\n\nJan-08\n\nInformal emp\n\nSep-08\n\nSep-05\n\nSep-06\n\nMay-06\n\nMay-05\n\nMay-08\n\nMay-07\n\nMay-09\n\nSep-07\n\nFormal emp Unemployed\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n     (e) Spreads on Sovereign Dollar Bonds                                   (f) Budget Revenues in 2009 over 2008     \n                                                                                                               Levels (first semester, Rp trillion) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNote:  Formal  employment  defined  as  regular  wage  employment.

With the sharp fall in global demand in Q4 2008 and the spillovers of \nthe  crisis  to  the  domestic  economy,  as  well  as  the  recognition  by  the  Government  and \ndevelopment  partners  that  a  larger  fiscal  expansion  is  needed,  the  Government  revised  the \n2009  budget  in  February  2009  and  again  in  July  2009  to  accommodate  weaker  economic \nprospects  and  the  projected  decline  in  tax  collection,  and  provide  additional  fiscal  stimulus \nmeasures. It now projects a national government budget deficit of 2.5% of GDP up from 1.0% \nas  originally  programmed,  and  up  from  a  0.1%  budget  deficit  in  2008.  The  revised  budget \ntranslates to a fiscal expansion of 2.4% of GDP from the 2008 budget, which is low by regional \nstandards.  ADB  staff  projects  that  tax  revenue  collection  will  be  slightly  weaker  than  in  the \nrevised budget. At the same time spending by line ministries is expected to be about 5% below \n\nIncome tax\n\nPhilippines\n\nIndonesia\n\nCustoms\n\nEast Asia\n\nMalaysia\n\n2009Q1\n\n2008Q1\n\nNon-tax\n\nb\ne\nF\n-\n1\n\nb\ne\nF\n-\n1\n\nn\nu\nJ\n-\n1\n\nn\na\nJ\n-\n1\n\nn\nu\nJ\n-\n1\n\nn\na\nJ\n-\n1\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\nr\nt\n \n\nu\nJ\n-\n1\n\nu\nJ\n-\n1\n\ny\na\nM\n\ny\na\nM\n\nv\no\nN\n\nc\ne\nD\n\np\ne\nS\n\ng\nu\nA\n\nr\na\nM\n\nr\na\nM\n\nr\np\nA\n\nr\np\nA\n\nt\nc\nO\n\n100\n\n200\n\n250\n\n150\n\n200\n\np\nR\n\nn\no\n\n50\n\n-\n1\n\n-\n1\n\n-\n1\n\n-\n1\n\n-\n1\n\n-\n1\n\n-\n1\n\n-\n1\n\n-\n1\n\n-\n1\n\n-\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nl\n\nl\n\n \n\n\ftheir  revised  budget.

Therefore,  the  Government  plans  to  maintain  supportive  role  of  fiscal \npolicy.  The  outgoing  Government  targets  a  deficit  of  1.6%  of  GDP  in  2010,  although  this \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n  \n\ntranslates  to  a  modest  fiscal  contraction  of  up  to  0.8%  of  GDP  over  the  2009  revised  budget. \nADB staff project the budget deficit for 2010 slightly higher in the order of 1.8% of GDP on the \nback of less optimistic macroeconomic projections, revenue collections and the possibility for a \nslightly  larger  second  round  fiscal  stimulus  program  in  the  2010  budget  than  currently \nanticipated. The Government also recognizes that budget stability could be improved over the \nmedium  term  by  further  reducing  the  subsidies  in  the  budget,  enhancing  budget  execution, \nexpanding  the  tax  base,  and  strengthening  tax  administration.  Based  on  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment to fiscal prudence and overall sound macroeconomic management, the three major \nrating  agencies  have  maintained  the  Indonesia  sovereign  credit  ratings  at  2008  levels  of  B1 \npositive (Moody\u2019s); BB-stable (Standard and Poor\u2019s), and BB stable (Fitch).  \n \n\nTable 2: Budget and Fiscal Projections \n(trillion Rp) \n\n2009 \nProposed \nRevised \nBudget \n\nADB \nProjections \n\nProposed  \nBudget \n\nADB  \nProjections \n\n2010 \n\n \n \n \nItem \nA.

The risks of the uncertain global economic \n23. \nand regional recovery on Indonesia\u2019s recovery and financial market are large. While some signs \nhave emerged that the export decline may have bottomed out, the weak external environment is \nexpected  to  continue  to  depress  export  performance.  Weakening  trade  flows  and  economic \ngrowth are projected to continue to affect government revenue negatively. On budget financing, \nwhile the PESF has helped improve the Government\u2019s access to the capital market and yields \non  sovereign  debt  have  improved  significantly  since  May  2009,  domestic  bond  yields  remain \nelevated  above  pre-crisis  levels  and  bond  tenures  have  shortened  significantly.  As  a  result  of \nhigher  interest  rates,  the  Government\u2019s  interest  costs  are  projected  to  increase  by  about \n$1 billion  in  2009.  In  real  terms,  bond  yields  have  actually  widened  significantly  because  of \ndeclining inflation since early 2009 (Figure 2a).

In  addition,  although  the  Government  has \nraised  about  80%  of  its  market  financing  needs  as  of  August  2009,  it  still  needs  to  raise  a \nsignificant  amount  (Rp85  trillion,  64%)  in  terms  of  net  financing  in  the  second  semester \n(Table 4).  \n \n\nFigure 2: Bond yields and Net Foreign Buying of Rupiah Bond \n \n\n(a) Domestic Real Bond Yields 2008\u20132009 \n\n \n\n \n\n     (b) Net Foreign Buying (billion Rp)   \n\n6000\n\n4000\n\n2000\n\n0\n\n-2000\n\n-4000\n\n-6000\n\nJan-08\n\nApr-08\n\nJul-08\n\nOct-08\n\nJan-09\n\nApr-09\n\nJul-09\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nInflation\n\n5Y-Domestic Bond Yield\n\n \n\n   \n \nSources: Ministry of Finance. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE GOVERNMENT\u2019S COUNTERCYCLICAL FISCAL STIMULUS PROGRAM \n\n  \nThe Government\u2019s fiscal policy response to the economic slowdown has been swift and \n24. \nbroadly effective. Like most other developing economies, the national government budget does \nnot  have  automatic  stabilizers  embedded  on  the  expenditure  side  of  the  budget.  Empirical \nevidence for Indonesia suggests that only two budget items have historically exhibited a relation \nwith  the  economic  cycle\u2014government  purchases  of  goods and  services,  and  debt servicing\u2014\nand the former has exhibited a distinct pro-cyclical response.6 Debt servicing costs have been \ncountercyclical  because  of  the  non-discretionary  nature  of  debt  service.  Government  bond \npremiums  tend  to  rise  during  economic  downturns  along  with  currency  depreciation.  On  the \nrevenue  side,  there  appear  to  be  modest  automatic  stabilizers,  i.e.,  tax  revenues  and  non-tax \nrevenues fall during downturns. Therefore, with the economy quickly decelerating in Q4 2008, it \nwas  necessary  for  the  Government  to  announce  a  national  budget  in  February  2009  that  was \ncountercyclical  focusing  on  increasing  priority  capital  spending  and  carrying  over  some \ninfrastructure projects from 2008, substantially increasing the materials and capital maintenance \nbudget,  expanding  flagship  social  assistance  programs,  and  providing  tax  relief  to  businesses \nand  households.  The  Government  also  announced  additional  stimulus  spending  on \ninfrastructure  and  maintenance  in  July  2009  as  part  of  its  fiscal  stimulus  efforts.  Overall,  the \ncountercyclical  component  of  the  budget  is  estimated  at  Rp113  trillion.  To  enhance  the \neffectiveness  of  the  countercyclical  spending  program  the  Government  also  introduced  policy \nmeasures to speed up disbursements of critical public spending.  \n \nThe  Government  intends  to  undertake  a  second-round  fiscal  stimulus  in  the  2010 \n25. \nnational  government  budget  focusing  on  infrastructure  spending.  The  INO-CS  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  infrastructure  investments  included  in  the  revised  2009  budget  and  the  2010 \nbudget  aimed  at  improving  the  welfare  of  targeted  groups  in  the  social  sector,  and  especially \n\n                                                 \n6  International Monetary Fund. 2009.

It  will  also  support  scaling  up  of  the \nsocial assistance programs in 2009 and its maintenance of this spending in 2010 (Table 3 and \nthe development policy letter in Appendix 1). A mechanism for monitoring implementation of the \nGovernment\u2019s countercyclical fiscal stimulus program has been established under the INO-CS \n(paras. 47\u201351). \n \n26. \nComposition  of  the  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus. The central government budget \ndeficit is projected to increase from 0.1% of GDP in 2008 to 2.5% in 2009, which translates to a \n2.4% fiscal expansion. Overall, the countercyclical component of the budget amounts to Rp113 \ntrillion or about 2.1% of GDP to support domestic demand. Of this, about half stem from lower \nincome taxation and other tax exemptions and 36% from infrastructure, maintenance and other \nexpenditure  items.  Scaling  up  social  assistance  programs  account  for  the  rest  of  the \ncountercyclical program (Figure 3). The tax cuts were motivated and designed to have had an \nimmediate  impact  on  stimulating  household  consumption  as  infrastructure  spending  is  only \nexpected  to  have  an  impact  in  the  second  semester  of  2009  and  2010  because  of  the  longer \ntime involved in the procurement and disbursement process. The countercyclical fiscal stimulus \npackage  announced  in  February  2009  was  incremental  to  additional  countercyclical  spending \nthat has been incorporated into the 2009 budget.  The Government more than doubled capital \nmaintenance  spending  and  increased  material  spending  in  the  order  of  Rp25  trillion  with \nimmediate and significant stimulus effects in 2009 (Table 2). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n27. \nTemporary components of the countercyclical fiscal stimulus. About 56% (0.7% of \nGDP) of the fiscal stimulus package is attributed to one-off or temporary policy measures, which \nwill  be  reversed  once  economic  recovery  sets  in.  These  include  the  stimulus  spending  on \ninfrastructure and temporary payroll tax relief to businesses and indirect tax relief to families. At \nthe  same  time  the  2009  budget  includes  a  one-off  election  related  spending  and  contingent \n\nFigure 3: Composition of Fiscal Stimulus Measures\n (trillion Rp)\n\nInfrastructure and Maintenance Social Assistance\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance budget reports. \n\nTax Cuts\n\n16\n\n56\n\n41\n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nfiscal risk reserve of about 0.4% of GDP. The underlying (cyclically adjusted) budget deficit for \n2009 is therefore estimated at about 1.4% of GDP. 7 \n \n28. \nTax cuts. The tax cuts are a combination of temporary tax rate cuts to provide financial \nrelief to families and enterprises in labor-intensive sectors, and permanent rate reductions in line \nwith the Government\u2019s longer term tax reform program to increase tax registrations and the tax \nbase. The permanent tax cuts include lower personal and income tax rates and the increase in \nthe taxable income threshold to Rp15.8 million per year (benefiting mainly low-income earners) \neffective  from  January  2009.  The  tax  cuts  appear  to  have  had  an  immediate  impact  on \nstimulating  household  consumption  in  Q1  2009.  These  measures  are  expected  to  boost \nhousehold incomes by about Rp43 trillion (about $4 billion) in 2009, although some proportion \nwill  be  saved\u2014reducing  the  stimulus  effect.  With  the  onset  of  the  economic  slowdown,  the \nGovernment  introduced  further  temporary  tax  relief  (such  as  reduction  in  VAT  on  cooking  oil, \nimport  duties  on  raw  materials  and  capital  goods,  and  payroll  tax  relief  for  firms  in  labor-\nintensive sectors) projected to total about Rp13 trillion. While the permanent tax cuts will reduce \nrevenue  in  the  short  term,  some  of  the  revenue  loss  will  be  recovered  in  the  medium  term \nthrough improved competitiveness of the economy and tax administration. \n \n\nTable 3: Indonesia\u2014Selected Infrastructure and Social Assistance Programs \n\nProgram \n\nProgram Description \n\nTargeted Beneficiaries    \nfor 2009 \n\nBudget Allocations in \n2008, 2009 and 2010 \n(where applicable) \n\nImplementation \nProgress \n(as of August \n2009) \n\n \nInfrastructure Programs \n \n    Competitiveness Enhancing Investments in the productive sector \n \n1.

The  Government  has  announced  a  series  of  infrastructure  projects \nspecifically  to  support  its  fiscal  stimulus  efforts  in  2009  and  2010  with  a  strong  development \nfocus  (Table  3),  in  addition  to  capital  spending  already  in  the  pipeline  for  the  2009  budget. \nThese include projects already in the investment pipeline but with procurement advanced by 12 \nmonths ahead to have an impact in the second semester of 2009 and 2010. Other infrastructure \nprojects  are  new  and  designed  for  the  fiscal  stimulus  as  quick-disbursing,  labor-intensive \nprojects.  The  projects  are  also  selected  to  have  a  social  welfare  impact  (such  as  housing  for \npoor families in remote coastal fishing villages) and are designed to enhance competitiveness in \nselected  sectors  especially  agriculture  and  downstream  sectors  such  as  the  traditional \ndistribution  sector  and  SMEs  operating  in  these  sectors.  These  include  enhancing  rural \nproductivity projects (construction and rehabilitation of feeder roads and irrigation in rural areas); \nenhancing  competitiveness  in  the  traditional  distribution  system  (construction  of  traditional \nmarkets  and  SME  support);  and  economy-wide  competitiveness  enhancing  projects \n(construction  of  national  infrastructure).  As  noted  above,  the  Government  also  doubled  capital \nmaintenance  spending  in  2009  which  are  quick-disbursing,  labor-intensive  activities  including \nnational road reparation, repairs to school buildings, health facilities etc. These competitiveness \nenhancing infrastructure and SME programs will continue in the 2010 budget.     \n \nSocial  assistance  programs.  The  Government  has  scaled  up  its  flagship  social \n30. \nassistance programs as part of its longer term reform program and also to mitigate the poverty \nimpacts  of  the  economic  slowdown.  In  recent  years,  the  Government  has  introduced  better \ntargeted  social  assistance  programs  in  response  to  lessons  learned  from  the  1998  economic \ncrisis  where  the  absence  of  effective  social  assistance  programs  resulted  in  substantial \nincreases in poverty. The new programs include the unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program \nfirst introduced in 2005 and its offspring program the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program \ncurrently  under  pilot  testing.  The  community-based  development  program  in  rural  areas \n(Kecamatan  Development  Program)  and  in  urban  areas  (Urban  Poverty  Project)  were  pilot \ntested  after  the  1998  crisis,  and  recently  rolled  out  on  a  national  level  as  the  National \nCommunity Empowerment Program Mandiri (PNPM). Under the PNPM, the central Government \nprovides  block  grants \nin \ninfrastructure, social and productive economy. \n \n31. \nCash  transfer  programs.  In  2008,  the  Government  reactivated  the  UCT  program  to \ncompensate  poor  households  for  the  surge  in  commodity  and  food  prices.  The  UCT  program \ncovered 18.5 million households based on the database used in the previous UCT in 2005 and \n2006.  Each  household  received  Rp100,000  per  month  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Available  data \nabout  the  antipoverty  effectiveness  of  the  UCT  are  encouraging.  According  to  data  from  the \n2008  National  Socioeconomic  Survey  (SUSENAS),  the  UCT  maintained  the  welfare  levels  of \n60% of recipient households and assisted 30% of recipient households to escape from poverty, \nwhile  about  10%  of  households  under  the  scheme  fell  into  poverty  because  of  food  price \ninflation  in  2008.  The  Government  had  extended  the  UCT  program  for  2  months  in  2009 \n\nfor  community-based  development  projects \n\nto  communities \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n  \n\ncovering  18.5  million  households.  It  was  suspended  in  the  lead-up  to  the  national  legislative \nelections in May 2009 and the presidential elections in July 2009. The CCT program is in pilot \nstage and covers about 720,000 households in 13 provinces. Families receive Rp100,000 per \nmonth conditional on meeting achievements on selected child education and health targets. The \nGovernment  intends  to  use  some  of  the  proceeds  of  the  INO  CS  loan  to  enhance  the  CCT \nprogram in 2010. \n \n32. \nOther programs. The Government has allocated a total of Rp10.4 trillion for the PNPM \nfor  2009,  of  which  Rp0.7  trillion  was  added  as  part  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  package.  The \nOperational Aid to School Program (BOS) is the largest program and provides block grants to \nneedy  elementary  schools.  In  addition,  the  Government  provides  for  payment  of  health \ninsurance premiums for the poor under the Government's new social health insurance scheme. \nThese programs have advantageously placed the Government to channel resources to the poor \nin  a  timely  and  transparent  manner,  and  thereby  mitigate  the  worst  effects  of  the  economic \ndownturn and external shocks on the poor. \n \nThese social assistance programs are the pillars of the new poverty reduction framework \n33. \nintroduced  in  response  to  the  current  global  crisis.  In  March  2009,  the  Government  issued  a \npresidential  regulation  on  coordination  of  national  poverty  reduction  efforts.  The  decree  helps \ncoordinate and streamline the implementation of poverty reduction efforts at national and local \nlevels.  The decree  outlines  the  functions,  responsibilities, and  organization  of  the coordination \ncommittees for poverty reduction at national, provincial, and district levels. At the national level, \nthe  coordination  committee  is  led  by  the  coordinating  minister  for  social  welfare,  with \nmembership from all ministries. At the provincial level, the committee is chaired by the provincial \ngovernor  and  at  district  level  by  the  district  mayor  or  regent.  The  committees  will  have  three \nprogram clusters focusing on social safety net programs, community empowerment programs, \nand  microcredit  and  small  business  development.  With  the  decree,  the  Government  will \nharmonize  and  streamline  interventions  from  some  60  community-based  projects  executed  by \n22  sectoral  ministries.  This  will  enable  the  Government  to  respond  more  efficiently  to  poverty \nimpacts  from  the  global  financial  crisis.  Supporting  the  framework,  the  Government  is \nestablishing  a  poverty  monitoring  mechanism  designed  to  provide  a  timely  assessment  of  the \npoverty impact of the current global financial crisis to stakeholders. \n \n34. \nSubsidies. The central government budget still contains sizeable subsidies intended to \nprotect  the  welfare  of  the  poor  (such  as  subsidies  applied  to  rice,  gasoline,  kerosene,  and \nelectricity, among others) amounting to 14% of the central government budget in 2009. However, \nthese  subsidies  are  poorly  targeted  and  with  leakages  and  the  overall  results  in  terms  of  net \nwelfare  to  intended  recipient  groups  are  mixed.  While  the  Government  has  cut  the  share  of \nsubsidies in the budget by half from 5.6% of GDP in 2008 to 2.9% of GDP in the revised 2009 \nbudget,  there  is  still  substantial  room  to  cut  them  back  further  and  allocate  savings  to \ndiscretionary  countercyclical  spending  in  social  assistance  programs  and  infrastructure. \nRecognizing  the  need  to  contain  these  subsidies,  the  Government  is  finalizing  its  regulatory \nframework for determining and allocating subsidies within the central government budget.   \n \nStrengthening  public  financial  management. The effectiveness of the Government\u2019s \n35. \nfiscal  stimulus  package  depends  on  better  budget  execution.  The  key  spending  agencies \n(Ministries  of  Education,  Health,  Public  Works,  Communication  and  Transportation)  have \nrelatively low absorptive capacity rates, causing delays in disbursements and procurement that \ncould  undermine  the  Government\u2019s  stimulus  package,  especially  with  its  record  of  under-\nexecution (especially in capital spending) and back-loaded spending toward the end of the year. \nFor  example,  only  about  19%  of  programmed  capital  spending  was  disbursed  in  the  first \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n5 months of 2008. To address the low disbursement rates in the first semester of the fiscal year, \nMOF  implemented  a  series  of  measures  at  the  end  of  2008  aimed  at  accelerating  the \nprocurement process and utilization of savings from the 2008 budget outturn. These measures \nincluded  (i)  implementing  a  campaign  to  promote  advance  procurement  processing,  appoint \nmultiyear treasury officers, and speed up disbursements through the Treasury; (ii) establishing a \nmonitoring  committee  for  the  budget  activity  list  2009  to  improve  budget  disbursements;  (iii) \nimproving the recording and reporting system in budget spending units; and (iv) issuing a series \nof  circulars  with  simplified  mechanisms  and  processes  for  carryover  of  unspent  2008  budget. \nThese measures have improved the disbursement rates of government expenditure, especially \ncurrent and social assistance. The measures provided a modest improvement in disbursement \nrates  of  capital  spending  in  the  first  semester  of  2009.  The  overall  disbursement  rate  of  line \nministries  and  agencies  in  the  first  semester  of  2009  was  35.8%  of  the  total  2009  budget,  up \nfrom 28.5% in 2008 and 28.1% in 2007.  \n \n36. \nUnder  the  public  financial  management  reforms,  the  Government  is  introducing \nmeasures aimed at addressing problems with leakages and corruption with programs. This is a \nlong-term effort that is also shaped by the regional autonomy implemented since 2001. These \nmeasures  include  (i)  developing  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  supplemented  with  a \nfiscal  policy  framework;  (ii)  program  and  performance  budgeting;  and  (iii)  modernizing  the \ntreasury system, including the establishment of a consolidated Treasury Single Account, and a \nfinancial management information system. Other supporting measures include unification of the \nplanning and budgeting processes, a revised chart of accounts and budget classification, new \ntreasury  processes,  and  improved  internal  and  external  auditing.  In  addition,  the  Independent \nAnticorruption  Commission  (KPK)  has  been  making  substantial  progress  in  investigating  and \nprosecuting  senior  government  officials  involved  in  corrupt  practices  and  this  has  helped \nimprove Indonesia\u2019s global rankings in control of corruption.8 The oversight body has improved \nimplementation of the Government's PNPM Mandiri program.  \n \n\nV. \n\nECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE COUNTERCYCLICAL PROGRAM \n\n \n37. \nThe  economic  stimulus  effects.  The  fiscal  stimulus  package  is  projected  at  1.4%  of \nGDP, covering about half of the estimated output gap for 2009 (negative output gap estimated \nat  about  3.0%\u20134.0%  before  the  stimulus).  On  this  basis,  the  stimulus  appears  to  be  of  an \nappropriate  size.  ADB  assessment  indicates  that  the  fiscal  multiplier  of  the  package  could  be \n1.5%\u20131.6% of GDP, depending on the type of fiscal stimulus, their multiplier effects, and their \ntiming (Appendix 3). For example, the total tax breaks of Rp56 trillion are likely to expand GDP \nby  less  than  this  amount  as  some  proportion  will  be  saved,  while  the  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure and social assistance spending of Rp57 trillion is likely to stimulate the economy \nby  up  to  Rp68 trillion  (assuming  a  multiplier  of  1.2).  The  tax  cuts,  social  assistance  programs \n(especially  the  UCT)  and  the  boost  in  capital  maintenance  spending  have  had  an  immediate \nimpact on household consumption. Some of the larger infrastructure projects, however, will take \nup to 12 months to have an impact because of the longer procurement and disbursement period. \nADB  staff  estimates  that,  without  the  stimulus  package,  economic  growth  for  2009  would  be \nbetween 2.0%\u20133.0%. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  The World Bank governance indicators show that Indonesia\u2019s global ranking for control of corruption has improved \nsubstantially  since  2000.  Indonesia  was  ranked  at  the  bottom  14.1  percentile  in  2000,  meaning  that  86%  of  all \ncountries in the index had a higher score than Indonesia. In 2004, Indonesia\u2019s ranking improved to 18.9. It jumped \nto the 31st percentile in 2008, meaning that 69% (instead of 86%) of all countries have a better score. Indonesia\u2019s \nranking  in  Transparency  International\u2019s  corruption  perceptions  index  also  improved  to  126  in  2008  from  133  in \n2004. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n  \n\nPoverty impacts. An economic slowdown from 6% in 2008 to a projected 3.0%\u20134.0% in \n38. \n2009  will  reduce  the  growth  in  per  capita  incomes  from  about  4.5%  in  2008  to  1.5%\u20132.5%  in \n2009. Based on experience with similar low growth rates, such as in 2001 to 2004, poverty is \nlikely to increase in the short term. Over the medium term, a slow economic recovery will create \npersistently higher unemployment and suppressed earnings in the informal sector as new labor \nmarket entrants outnumber new jobs created. The Government\u2019s fiscal stimulus through quick-\ndisbursing labor-intensive programs will and has partially offset the unemployment and poverty \nimpacts  of  the  crisis.  However,  an  economic  growth  rate  of  about  6%  per  annum  in  2011  is \nnecessary to ensure a sustained reduction in unemployment and poverty (Appendix 3).  \n \n\nVI. \n\nOBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND COVERAGE OF THE LOAN \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $500,000,000  under  the  CSF  from  ADB\u2019s \n39. \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  plus  200  bps;  a  5-year  term,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  3  years;  commitment  charge  of  75  bps  on  the  undisbursed  loan  balance;  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \ndraft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the  Board.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these \nterms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n40. \nThe gross financing needs of the Government have increased from $18.2 billion in 2008 \nto  $24.5  billion  in  2009  based  on  the  revised  2009  budget.  These  growing  financing  needs \nreflect increased levels of domestic and foreign debt principal repayments, and changes to the \n2009  budget.  The  revised  2009  budget  projects  a  lower  increase  in  revenues  because  of  the \neconomic  slowdown,  and  the  need  for  additional  spending  to  stimulate  the  economy  in  2009 \nand  for  poverty  alleviation  programs.  Overall,  the  Government  is  budgeting  for  additional \nspending  and  countercyclical  spending  up  to  Rp113  trillion in  2009.  The  Government  plans  to \nmeet the financing needs from the following sources: (i) $13.8 billion from issuance of domestic \nand  international  bond  issuance  in  the  markets,  (ii)  $5.4  billion  from  the  banking  system  and \nexcess  financing  from  2008,  and  (iii)  $6.6  billion  from  the  Official  Development  Assistance \nprogram and project lending (excluding the PESF). The Government will draw down the PESF \nand related support from other development partners when it cannot meet its financing targets \nfrom  the  markets  within  specified  market  access  conditions  specified  in  the  Government\u2019s \nfinancing plan and other conditions set out in the PESF loan agreement.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nIMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n\nA. \n\nCountercyclical Support Facility Management \n\n41.  MOF will be the Executing Agency to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate implementation \nof  the  Government\u2019s  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus  programs  supported  by  the  loan.  MOF  will \nform a committee to oversee the implementation of the Government\u2019s countercyclical programs. \nThe  committee  will  meet  regularly  to  monitor  progress  and  oversee  implementation  of  the \ncountercyclical public expenditure program (para 47-51).  \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nPeriod and Tranching \n\n42. \nThe  period  specified  for  the  INO-CS  will  be  from  1  September  2009  to  31  December \n2010, with a single tranche loan of $500 million to be disbursed when the Government has met \nthe conditions for loan effectiveness. \n  \nTable 4: Projected Net Financing Requirements of the Government of Indonesia for 2009 \n($ billion)  \n2007 \nAudited \n\nRevised \nBudget \n\nBudget \n\n \n \nItem \nA.

ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n  \n\nof  Indonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its \ncompliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation \nunder  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  Disbursements  will  be  made  under  the  simplified \nprocedures for program loans. In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and \nrelated requirements for program loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB \nmember  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB.  \n\n \nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n\nD. \n\n44. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  INO-CS.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  INO-CS.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  INO-CS  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the INO-CS. \n \n45. \nAn update of the country\u2019s financial management systems was assessed for the INO-CS. \nThis  assessment  draws  on  recent  economic  and  sector  work  undertaken  by  the  World  Bank, \nADB, 10  and  is  anchored  in  the  results  of  a  public  expenditure  and  financial  assessment \nconcluded in June 2008.11 Based on this assessment, the fiduciary arrangements proposed for \nthe INO-CS remain acceptable. Over the past 12 years, substantial progress has been made in \nimproving the regulatory framework for improved public financial management, under the troika \nof  laws  (The  2003  Law  on  State  Finance,  The  2004  State  Treasury  Law,  and  the  2004  State \nAudit  Law),  and  other  complementary  laws  on  planning  and  procurement,  and  related \nimplementing  regulations.  The  Fiscal  Policy  Office  within  MOF  has  a  mandate  to  undertake \nmacro-fiscal projections and analysis. Budget documentation and disclosures to the public have \nimproved.  A  fiscal  risk  statement  is  now  included  in  the  annual  budget  documents\u2014making \nIndonesia one of the pioneers in fiscal risk analysis among emerging market economies. A more \nrecent focus has been on improving budget execution to avoid under-spending, as allocation of \nfunds and the implementation of budget remain serious constraints. The 2007 government cash \nmanagement  regulations  have  contributed  to  consolidating  government  bank  accounts,  and \nimproved  cash  management  by  including  off-budget  accounts  in  the  single  treasury  account. \nThe  Corruption  Eradication  Commission  has  effectively  prosecuted  some  very  high-ranking \nofficials.  Other  major  public  financial  management  reforms  are  also  under  way  in  Indonesia \n(para  36):  these  include  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework;  program  and  performance \nbudgeting; and modernizing the treasury system, including a financial management information \nsystem.  Other  complementary  measures  include  unification  of  the  planning  and  budgeting \n\n                                                 \n10   ADB.  2007.

Before  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen a deposit account at the central bank (Bank Indonesia) to receive all loan proceeds. The \naccount will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nF. \n\nPerformance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  of  the  Macro  Economy  and  the \nCountercyclical Expenditure Program  \n\n47. \nIn cooperation with the Executing Agency (para. 41), during the period specified for the \ncountercyclical  programs,  ADB  will  carry  out  semiannual  reviews  of  macroeconomic \nperformance and implementation of the Government\u2019s countercyclical expenditure program and \nreport  to  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  mechanism  for  the  proposed  INO-CS  loan  is  based  on \ncountry  monitoring  systems  and  civil  society  participation.  The  monitoring  mechanism \ncomprises three parts: (i) an established interministerial committee (and process) for monitoring; \n(ii) use  of  country  public  financial  management  systems  for  monitoring  budget  execution  of \nprojects and programs supported under the INO-CS loan (Table 3); and (iii) use of civil society \norganizations  and  development  partners\u2019  mechanisms  for  monitoring  selected  projects \nsupported under the loan and an assessment of their development impact.  \n \nThe monitoring mechanism (process). The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, \n48. \nMOF  and  BAPPENAS  have  established  a  coordination  arrangement \nfor  monitoring \nimplementation of the fiscal stimulus program of the Government. MOF will be the coordinator \nfor macroeconomic performance monitoring through the PESF mechanism (that meets quarterly) \ncomprising key development partners (ADB, AusAID, the Government of Japan, and the World \nBank). BAPPENAS through its Evaluations and Monitoring Directorate, in coordination with the \nrelevant line ministries, will report on implementation of the countercyclical expenditure program. \nADB staff meets with the monitoring committee quarterly and a report to the Board of Directors \nfor the loan will be done on a semiannual basis. MOF will provide budget disbursement data of \nthe spending line ministries. BAPPENAS will provide data on selected project implementation. \n \n49.  Monitoring macroeconomic performance. ADB will review and assess developments \nin  the  key  macroeconomic  indicators  presented  and  described  in  the  access  criteria  matrix  in \nAppendix  2,  including  quarterly  fiscal  data  and  budget  outturns,  public  debt  ratios,  external \nbalance,  and  monetary  survey.  In  assessing  macroeconomic  performance,  it  will  draw  on  the \nMOF  quarterly  reports  provided  under  the  PESF  monitoring  mechanism;  IMF  reports  on \nIndonesia,  including  its annual  Article  IV  Consultations  with  the  Government  and  the  Selected \nIssues; and any other relevant materials. ADB staff will also draw on the results of the economic \ncrisis  monitoring  survey  that  will  be  carried  out  by  the  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  in \ncollaboration with BAPPENAS, the World Bank and funded by AusAID. 12 Finally, ADB staff will \nalso draw on the results of the broader dialogue over, and monitoring and evaluation of, reforms \nunder the DPSP series. \n \n\n                                                 \n12 The crisis monitoring survey was carried out in August 2009, and will be carried out again in November 2009 and \nFebruary  2010. The  survey  will  comprise  12,000  households  nationwide. The  survey  will  collect  information  from \nhousehold heads on income, expenditure, access to public services and social assistance programs.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n  \n\n50.  Monitoring  the  Government\u2019s  countercyclical  expenditure  program.  ADB  will \nmonitor  and  review  the  program  in  three  respects.  First,  at  the  macro  level  it  will  monitor \naggregate budget outturns for the countercyclical expenditure program and disbursement rates \nof the key agencies, collected by MOF through its monthly budget outturn reports. Second, it will \nmonitor implementation of selected programs and projects supported by the INO-CSF loan and \nidentified in Table 3. These include investments in the social sector (such as low cost housing \nfor  families remote  fishing  villages, and  students)  and  competitiveness  enhancing investments \nin the agriculture sector and downstream traditional distribution sector (such as farm to market \nroads,  traditional  wet  and  dry  urban  markets  and  SME  support),  among  other  investments, \nCollection  of  budget  disbursement  data  and  project  accomplishments  including  additional \nemployment  generated  under  the  projects  will  be  coordinated  through  the  Evaluations  and \nMonitoring  Directorate  at  BAPPENAS.  BAPPENAS  collects  implementation  data  on  a  monthly \nbasis from all relevant line ministries using a standard template. BAPPENAS will provide ADB \nwith  monthly  fiscal  stimulus  monitoring  reports13 on  implementation  of  projects  and  programs \nunder  the  fiscal  stimulus  package,  including  the  number  of  jobs  created  under  the  programs. \nThird, ADB in collaboration with BAPPENAS will report on the development impact of selected \nprograms and projects identified in Table 3 (such as the construction of traditional markets, rural \nfeeder roads, construction of low cost housing for the poor). This will be done through carrying \nout participatory audits and field surveys in 2010 of selected infrastructure projects supported by \nthe  INO-CS  loan  at  the  end  of  the  facility  period  (December  2010).  This  will  also  promote \nindependent  quality  control  of  selected  infrastructure  projects.  The  model  for  the  participatory \naudit will draw on the proposed Philippines road sector institutional development and investment \nprogram  currently  under  processing  and  expected  to  be  submitted  to  the  Board  for \nconsideration in December 2009. The participatory audits and surveys will be jointly undertaken \nby  BAPPENAS  and  civil  society  organizations  engaged  in  the  relevant  sector  to  assess  the \nwelfare and development impact of selected projects. The audits and surveys will be financed \nunder ADB technical assistance under preparation. \n \nFor  the  infrastructure  projects  under  PNPM  monitoring  of  its  implementation  will  be \n51. \ncoordinated  using  mechanisms  established  under  the  PNPM  and  supported  by  previous  ADB \nand World Bank programs. Mechanisms under the PNPM have established strict protocols for \nreporting  and  monitoring  disbursements,  engagement  of  civil  society  groups  and  community \nfacilitators.  For  the  social  assistance  programs  such  as  BOS  monitoring  of  its  implementation \nwill be coordinated using country mechanisms established under the BOS.    \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n52. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$500,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Countercyclical  Support  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 200 basis points; a term of 5 years, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.  \n\n22 September 2009 \n\n                                                 \n13 The  monthly  reports  are  titled  BAPPENAS.

Adverse Impact of \nthe Global Economic \nCrisis \n\n \n\nIndicators \n\nSTATE OF ACCESS CRITERIA COMPLIANCE MATRIX \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nThe Indonesian economy has been adversely affected by the global economic crisis in several ways. \nGovernment  finances  have  been  more  vulnerable  to  the  deteriorating  external  market  conditions \nbecause of the country\u2019s large gross financing needs and its reliance on international capital markets \nto finance its budget. The economy has also been under pressure from a sharp decline in trade flows \nand  investment  growth.  Although  the  economy  is  still  resilient,  growth  has  weakened  significantly. \nWith  the  external  environment  continuing  to  deteriorate,  economic  growth  is  projected  to  weaken \nfurther to a level significantly lower than that needed to continue the current pace of poverty reduction. \nWithout  strong  domestic  efforts  and  fiscal  stimulus,  poverty  incidence  is  projected  to  increase \nsignificantly. \nAlthough  domestic  consumption  remained  robust,  partly  because  of  the  fiscal  stimulus,  economic \ngrowth weakened significantly to 4% in Q2 2009 and is projected to weaken further to 3.0%\u20134.0% for \nthe rest of the year. \nExports in June 2009 contracted by 27% and investment growth also weakened significantly to 3.5% \nin Q1 2009 from 13.7% in the same period last year.    \nRemittances declined by 15% from $1.3 billion in Q4 2008 to $1.1 billion in Q2 2009. \nTo accommodate the fiscal stimulus, the Government increased the budget deficit from 1.0% to 2.5% \nof GDP in the revised budget approved by the Parliament in July 2009. \nTax revenue has softened considerably because of weakening growth, declining trade flows, and the \ntax-related  stimulus  package.  Actual  tax  revenue  for  the  first  6  months  was  about  43%  of  the  2009 \nannual target. \nSpreads surged on dollar bonds to about 1,100 bps in November 2008 from an average of 320 bps in \nthe first 6 months of the year. Spreads have gradually declined since April 2009, but remain higher at \naround  430  bps  and  more  volatile  than  those  of  other  countries  in  Southeast  Asia.    Spreads  on \ndomestic bonds rose to over 650 bps in 2008. \nThe Government is implementing a countercyclical program that focuses on (i) supporting consumers\u2019 \npurchasing  power,  (ii)  protecting  the  business  sector  from  the  global  downturn,  and  (iii)  generating \nemployment to mitigate the impact of job losses in the private sector. \nThe 2009 budget plans to increase infrastructure spending at all level of governments by 25% in real \nterms,  thanks  to  the  reduction  in  public  spending  on  subsidies.  The  stimulus  package  introduced  in \nFebruary 2009 also includes an additional $1 billion  spending for infrastructure beyond programmed \ncapital  spending  approved  in  the  original  2009  budget.  Proceeds  from  the  INO-CS  loan  will  support \npart  of  the  Government's  infrastructure  program  such  as  low  cost  housing  program,  enhancing  rural \nsector productivity projects, among others (Table 3 page 12).  \nThe  Government  has  scaled  up  its  National  Community  Empowerment  Program  (PNPM)  for  2009. \nUnder  lower  growth  scenarios  for  2009,  BAPPENAS  projects  that  poverty-related  spending  will \nincrease to about Rp36.3 trillion (Rp26.0 trillion for the existing social protection programs and Rp10.4 \ntrillion for the PNPM). The Government has budgeted Rp3.8 trillion for its unconditional cash transfer \nprogram  for  January  and  February  2009  to  mitigate  the  poverty  impact  of  the  global  crisis.  The \nconditional cash transfer program is still in a pilot stage, covering 720,000 households, and is likely to \nbe  scaled  up  to  mitigate  the  poverty  effects  of  the  economic  slowdown.

This  involved  taking  a  number  of  preemptive \nmeasures  aimed  at  maintaining  the  stability  of  the  domestic  bank  system  by  increasing  liquidity, \nassuring  the  confidence  of  depositors,  and  strengthening  the  central  bank\u2019s  lender  of  last  resort \nfacility.  The  Government  also  introduced  fiscal  stimulus  measures  while  easing  monetary  policy \nappropriately to respond to weakening growth prospects. \n\nBank Indonesia has responded prudently throughout the crisis. Inflationary pressure  was a concern \nprior to the crisis. To arrest emergent inflationary pressure, Bank Indonesia progressively increased \nits  policy  rate  to  9.5%  in  October  2008.  As  inflationary  pressure  waned  with  the  fall  in  global \ncommodity  prices  and  economic  growth  prospects  weakened  rapidly,  Bank  Indonesia  shifted  its \npolicy direction and lowered its policy rate to 6.50% by August 2009. Year-on-year inflation declined \nto 2.7% in July. \nThe  Government  has  taken  a  number  of  proactive  measures  aimed  at  reducing  the  likelihood  of \nfurther disruption, and maintaining the confidence and stability of the financial system. Key measures \ninclude  the  following:  (i)  creation  of  emergency  powers  that  establish  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and \nprocedures that govern the actions and responses of Bank Indonesia, the minister of finance, and the \nDeposit Insurance Corporation in the event of the failure of a financial institution; (ii) the central bank \nstrengthened its lender of last resort facility; (iii) increased coverage of the deposit insurance scheme; \nand (iv) the central bank eased liquidity in the banking sector through monetary expansion. \nPublic  debt  is  sustainable.  Prudent  fiscal  policy  has  enabled  Indonesia  to  reduce  its  public  debt \nburden  significantly.  In  the  past  5  years,  Indonesia\u2019s  public  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  has  fallen  sharply,  from \nover 55% in 2004 to around 33% at the end of 2008. The latest debt sustainability analysis suggests \nthat, under the baseline scenario of continued historical growth and low budget deficit, the debt\u2013GDP \nratio will decline to 28.5% in 2014. Under most types of shocks, Indonesia\u2019s debt levels and servicing \nobligations  would  remain  sustainable.  Fiscal  contingent  liabilities  amounting  to  10%  of  GDP  could \nraise the public sector debt to almost 38% of GDP by 2014. A 30% depreciation of the rupiah would \nraise  the  debt  ratio  by  9  percentage  points  during  the  same  period.  Other  macroeconomic  shocks \nhave  more  limited  impact  on  the  country\u2019s  debt  sustainability.  The  fiscal  space  for  the  stimulus \npackage is sustainable as the primary balance required to stabilize debt is about 0.3% of GDP. \nThe  Government  has  an  aggressive  PFM  reform  program  supported  under  the  Development  Policy \nSupport  Program  (DPSP)  series  and  other  development  partners\u2019  assistance.  Key  reforms  include \nstrengthening the budgetary process, budget transparency, and civil service reforms.  \nThe external balance position is strong. Gross international reserves at the end of August 2009 were \n$57.9 billion, sufficient for 6.0 months of imports and servicing of official external debt. \n\nMonetary policy and \ninflation \n\nAdjustment policy \nmeasures to address \nthe financial crisis \n\nDebt sustainability \nanalysis \n\nPublic financial \nmanagement \nsystems \nExternal balance \n\nBAPPENAS = National Development Planning Agency, CSF = countercyclical support facility, DPSP = Development Support Program, GDP = gross domestic \nproduct, PFM = public financial management, PNPM = National Community Empowerment Program. \nSource: Bank Indonesia, International Monetary Fund, and Asian Development Bank.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29    \n\nECONOMIC AND POVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT  \n\nEconomic Contraction  \n\n \nA. \n \nThe economy began to slow in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2008 and growth decelerated to \n1. \n4% in Q2 2009 on a year-on-year basis, compared to a 6% growth rate in 2008. The slowdown \nin growth was broad-based, with most major economic sectors declining, driven by the export-\noriented  manufacturing  sector.  Depressed  external  demand  for  goods  and  sluggish  foreign \ndirect investment inflows were the primary drivers behind the economic deceleration in Q2 2009. \nOn the expenditure side, private consumption growth remained positive in the first semester of \n2009\u2014partly supported by the one-off election spending in Q1 and the tax cuts as part of the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  stimulus  package\u2014but  consumption  began  to  weaken  in  Q2.  Public \nexpenditure was a key engine of growth in the first semester of 2009, growing by 18% over the \nsame period in 2008, up from an average growth rate of 3\u20134% in first semesters of 2006 and \n2007, indicative of the large magnitude of the Government\u2019s spending program in 2009 (Figure \nA3a). \n \n2. \nAnother way of looking at economic performance is the output gap, which measures the \ndifference between potential output and actual output in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth. A small output gap suggests that the economy is at its long-run trend or full employment. \nIf growth exceeds the potential growth rate (i.e., a positive output gap), it suggests the economy \nrisks overheating associated with above-trend inflation. If actual growth is below potential (i.e., a \nnegative output gap), this suggests an economic downturn usually associated with below-trend \ninflation.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  staff  estimates  indicate  that  Indonesia\u2019s  potential \neconomic  growth  is  6.0%\u20136.5%  per  annum.  Staff  estimates  also  indicate  the  emergence  of  a \nsignificant output gap in 2009, projected at 3\u20134% (in the absence of the fiscal stimulus), similar \nin  magnitude  to  the  one  that  emerged  in  the  late  1980s  (Figure A3b).  Inflation  is  subdued, \nindicative of weakening aggregate demand and the fall in commodity prices (Figure A3c).  \n \nB.  \n \n3. \nEconomic  stimulus  effects.  In  times  of  a  negative  output  gap,  governments  may \nstimulate  the  economy  through  a  combination  of  policy  instruments  such  as  (i)  expansionary \nmonetary policy and therefore lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and consumption, \nand  (ii)  fiscal  expansion  through  tax  cuts  and  increasing  discretionary  public  spending.  An \nappropriate fiscal expansion will depend on its size relative to the output gap and the multiplier \n(or second-round effects) of the different components of the fiscal stimulus. Empirical evidence \nfor  other  countries  indicates  that  infrastructure  spending  has  the  largest  multiplier  effects, \nfollowed  by  cash  transfers  to  poor  families;  tax  breaks  have  the  lowest  multiplier  effects \n(generally less than 1) as some proportion will be saved. \n \n4. \nThe Government is using both instruments to stimulate the economy. In aggregate, the \nnational government budget deficit is projected at 2.5% of GDP or an expansion of 2.4% over \n2008  (budget  deficit  of  0.1%  in  2008).  Overall,  the  fiscal  stimulus  component  (incremental \nrevenue and spending measures) amounts to about 1.4% of GDP to support domestic demand. \nWith multiplier effects, the stimulus could add 1.5\u20131.6% to GDP. Of the stimulus package about \nhalf  stems  from  lower  income  taxation  and  other  tax  exemptions  and  the  rest  from  other \nexpenditure items, mainly new and/or advanced infrastructure projects. The tax cuts comprise a \npermanent  increase  in  the  taxable  income  threshold  to  Rp15.8  million  and  a  reduction  in \npersonal and corporate income tax rates.

This is just under about half of the negative output \ngap that would emerge without the fiscal stimulus. The fiscal response from the 2009 budget is \nexpected  to  carry  over  into  early  2010  at  a  much  smaller  magnitude,  perhaps  in  the  order  of \n0.3% of GDP (Figure A3 d).  \n \n6. \nPoverty impacts. The economic slow down in the order of GDP by 3.0%\u20134.0% in 2009 \nwill reduce per capita incomes growth to 1.5\u20132.5% in 2009. This could increase poverty in the \nshort run through a weak labor market and reduced household earnings. Over the medium term, \na slow economic recovery will create persistently high unemployment and suppressed earnings \nin the informal sector as new labor market entrants outstrip new jobs created. This in turn will \nlead  to  persistently  higher  poverty.  The  Government's  fiscal  stimulus  through  quick  disbursing \nand  labor  intensive  projects  will  partially  offset  the  unemployment  and  poverty  impacts  of  the \ncrisis.  However,  employment\u2013GDP  elasticity  indicates  that  an  economic  recovery  of  6\u20137%  in \n2011 is necessary to ensure a sustained reversal in deterioration of the labor market (Table A3).  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fTable A3: Poverty Impact Assessment Matrix \n\nSupport for the Government's countercyclical fiscal stimulus program. The global economic crisis is likely to hurt the poor in the short and medium term through \nthree  channels.  The  first  channel  is  the  weak  labor  market  as  hiring  activity  across  most  sectors  has  slowed  with  loss  of  jobs  in  the  export  sector  and  shift  to \ninformal labor markets in 2009. The second channel is through lower household incomes with lower consumer spending. The third channel is through poor families \nreduced  access  to  social  services  such  as  education,  health  and  sanitation.  This  may  also  increase  the  poverty  incidence  rate  in  the  medium  term.  The \nGovernment's countercyclical fiscal stimulus program (CFSP) is designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis on the poor by creating employment and mitigating \nthe impact of job losses through the labor intensive infrastructure construction policy, increased spending in the social sectors and scaling up key social assistance \nprograms. The Government's fiscal stimulus program amounts to Rp113 trillion. \n\n3\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\nChannel of Effect \n\nGeneral \n \nAccess to \nemployment and \nwages  \n\nSpecific \n \nFormal and \ninformal sector \nlabor markets \n\nMedium Run \n \nA slow economic \nrecovery may create \npersistent \nunemployment as new \nlabor market entrants \noutstrip job creation or \ngo to the informal \nsectors. \n \nAs larger infrastructure \nprograms begin to be  \nimplemented, \nemployment  for semi-\nskilled and skilled labor \nwill arise, but limited by \nthe size of the CFSP. \n\nEffects on the Poor \n\nIndirect Short Term \n \nJob losses In the export \nsector and movement to \nthe informal sectors have \nled to second round \neffects of reduced \nconsumer spending. \n \n \n \nAn economic slow down \nfrom 6% in 2008 to the \nprojected 3.0%\u20134.0% in \n2009 will directly or \nindirectly reduce the \ngrowth in per capita \nincomes from 5% in 2008 \nto 1.5-2.5% in 2009 with \nadditional persons falling \nbelow the poverty line. \n \nJobs created by \ninfrastructure and block \ngrant programs is \nexpected to help those \nemployed maintain their \nconsumption although \nbasic consumption items \nand at levels limited by the \nsize of the CFSP. \n\nDirect Short Term \n \nMass lay offs have taken \nplace in export-oriented \nindustries. This is \nexpected to be followed in \nother sectors including \ntextile, paper and wood \nindustries. \n \n \nThe global economic crisis \nis also expected to lead to \nloss of employment for \noverseas Indonesian \nworkers adding pressure \non the domestic labor \nmarket. \n \nThe unemployment rate \ndecreased in early 2009 to \n8.14 percent from 8.39 \npercent in August 2008 \nprimarily due to labor \nmovement to informal \nsectors.

This  is  expected  to  increase  poverty  in  the  short  run  through  a  weak  labor  market  and  reduced  household  earnings.  Over  the  medium  term,  a  slow \neconomic recovery will lead to persistently high unemployment and lower earnings in the informal sector as new labor market entrants outstrip new jobs created.  \nThis in turn will lead to higher poverty. Structural poverty may persist as poor families' access to social services is reduced. The Government's fiscal stimulus will \npartially  offset  the  unemployment  and  poverty  impacts  of  the  crisis  however,  an  economic  recovery  in  the  order  of  6  percent  in  2011  is  necessary  to  ensure  a \nsustained reduction in unemployment and poverty. The increased coverage of social assistance program will have an immediate impact on welfare of families and \nin reducing longer term poverty by supporting access to employment, maintaining access to education for poor households and ensuring access to targeted cash \ntransfers. \n \n\nTime  dimensions:  The  increased  spending  in  social  assistance  programs  will  have  an  immediate  positive  effect  on  the  poor.  The  labor  intensive  infrastructure \nconstruction programs like PNPM will have an immediate positive impact on the labor market and incomes of the poor. The larger infrastructure projects will impact \non the economy and create jobs once the procurement process has been completed and investments made most likely in 2010. Increased subsidies for health and \neducation services access as well as transfers through the Government's social assistance programs such as cash transfers and nutrition maintenance through \nfood subsidies are expected to maintain the social welfare of poor households, placing them on a better social welfare footing and employability for reintegration \ninto the economy once an upturn materializes. \n\nCrucial Assumptions \nThe Government advances procurement and is able to make substantial progress towards front loading public spending to at least 50 percent of the annual budget \nof the major procurement agencies like the department of public works and national education in the first semester of 2009. \n\nCFSP = countercyclical fiscal stimulus program, CSF = countercyclical support loan, MDG = Millenium Development Goal. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n3\n \n\n3\n5\n\n \n\n\f     Appendix 4 \n\n   36 \n\nINDONESIA\u2014PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY \nIN THE BASELINE SCENARIO \n \n\nPublic Debt \n\nA. \n \n1. \nPublic  sector  debt  has  declined  as  a  share  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  since \n2000.1 The  ratio  fell  to  a  post-crisis  record-low  level  of  33%  in  2008  (Figure A4.1) owing  to \nprudent fiscal management, which led to fiscal surpluses averaging almost 2% of GDP per year \nin the last decade. Reduced risk premiums, lower interest rates, and high real GDP growth also \ncontributed to debt consolidation. Foreign-currency debt (mostly to multilateral institutions) has \nfallen markedly to about half of total debt, as the improved fiscal position facilitated government \naccess to the domestic capital market.  \n \n2. \nIn  the  baseline  scenario,  a  moderate  further  decline  in  public  sector  debt  is  likely. \nDespite  a  larger  fiscal  deficit,  public  debt  is  projected  to  fall  to  about  31% of  GDP  in  2009, \nreflecting  rupiah  appreciation  and  falling  interest  rates.  In  the  medium  term,  the  public  debt\u2013\nGDP  ratio  is  expected  to  decline  gradually  to  28.5%  by  2014.  Strong  growth  from  2011  and \nsustained  fiscal  prudence  drive  this  result.  A  return  to  positive  primary  balances  from  2011  is \nconsistent with accommodating extra resources for development spending. \n \nStandard  stress  tests  suggest  that  the  projected  decline  in  the  debt  ratio  could  be \n3. \nvulnerable  to  contingent  liabilities,  sharp  exchange  rate  movements,  and  higher  interest  rates \n(Figure A4.1). Fiscal contingent liabilities amounting to 10% of GDP could raise the public sector \ndebt to almost 38% of GDP by 2014, with the ratio above 40% in 2010 (a level not seen since \n2005). A 30% currency depreciation would raise the debt ratio by 9 percentage points compared \nto  the  baseline.  A  large  increase  in  real  interest  rates  would  have  smaller,  but  still  sizeable, \neffects, with the debt ratio reaching 33% by 2014. Other macroeconomic shocks have a more \nlimited impact.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nIndonesia\u2019s external debt has also declined steadily since the crisis, from over 150% of \nGDP in 1998 to 29% in 2008 (Figure A4.2). External debt as a percentage of exports has also \ndeclined, from 288% to 97%, over the same period. \n \n5. \nIn  the  baseline  scenario,  the  external  debt  dynamics  are  projected  to  be  sustainable. \nThe debt\u2013GDP ratio is projected to decline to around 22% by 2014. The main driving factors are \n(i) the projected increase in real GDP growth to 5%\u22126% over the medium term; (ii) a projected \npositive  growth-interest  rate  differential;  and  (iii) an  expected  increase  in  non-debt-creating \ncapital inflows. The favorable trend in external debt may be reversed if these expected positive \ndevelopments do not occur. \n \n6. \nThe  external  debt  ratio  is  most  vulnerable  to  shocks  to  the  exchange  rate.  A  one-time \n30% real exchange rate depreciation would raise the debt ratio by 14 percentage points in 2010, \nwith the impact falling to 12 percentage points over the baseline by 2014. \n\nExternal Debt \n\n                                                 \n1   Extracted  with  permission  from  International  Monetary  Fund.  2009.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (NPRS)  has  five  basic  strategies  for  poverty  reduction:  (i)  broadening \nopportunities,  (ii)  empowering  community  institutions,  (iii)  increasing  capacity,  (iv)  providing  social  protection,  and \n(v) promoting global partnerships. The NPRS is to be implemented through macroeconomic strategy and policies for fulfilling \nbasic  rights,  promoting  gender  justice  and  equality,  and  regional  development.  It  considers  macroeconomic  policies  as  the \nfoundation  for  reducing  poverty  through  a  supportive  business  environment  and  broad  opportunities  for  increasing  the \ncapability  of  the  poor  through  four  related  objectives:  (i)  create  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  promote  economic  growth, \n(iii) increase  opportunities  for  employment  and  entrepreneurship,  and  (iv)  reduce  inequalities  between  regions.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  medium-term  national  development  plan  (RPJM)  includes  the  main  tenets  of  the  previous  draft  NPRS  and \nincorporates  the  eight  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs). This  provides  an  overarching  framework  that  places  human \ndevelopment and poverty reduction at the center of the development agenda. \n \nThe  country  poverty  assessmenta  and  country  poverty  partnership  agreementb  consider  macroeconomic  stability  as  a \nfundamental underpinning to poverty reduction. The poverty agreement also calls for expanding and improving such key basic \nservices  as  health,  education,  water  supply,  and  sanitation  through  public\u2013private  partnerships;  and  points  out  the  need  to \nexpand the system of social protection. The Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF) provides support to government measures \naimed at mitigating the impact of the global financial crisis and keeping the country on track to meet MDG targets. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nThe current global financial crisis is expected to lead to reduced economic growth, retrenchments, move to informal sectors, \nand  decreased  real  wages  and  living  standards  for  a  significant  portion  of  the  population. The  economy  is  slowing  down  in \n2009, with growth projections ranging from 3.0% to 4%. Exports in June declined by 27% on a year-on-year basis, suggesting \nthat  the  lower  end  of  projections  is  an  increasingly  likely  outcome  for  2009.  ADB  staff  estimates  that  without  the  fiscal \nstimulus, poverty could rise by 3 to 4 million person or 1 to 2 percentage points of the population.  \n \n2. Design Features  \n \nIndonesia Countercyclical Support (INO-CS) supports government efforts to mitigate the effects of the crisis by supporting a \nstimulus package, cash transfer programs for the poor, and maintaining critical spending on social sectors and infrastructure. \n \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nThe recent fall in inflation and thus food prices has benefited the poor, which spend a larger proportion of their budget on food \nthan the average household. The poverty rate declined to 14.2% in early 2009 from 14.4% in early 2008, showing the effects \nof the good rice harvest, stability in food and fuel prices, and the impact of the unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program to \nthe  poor  and  near  poor  that  was  implemented  in  2008\u20132009.  The  country  defines  poverty  based  on  a  consumption  bundle \nthat consists of food items (to satisfy 2,100 calories) and basic non-food items determined by the pattern of consumption of \nreference  households  near  the  poverty  line.  As  in  most  developing  economies,  poverty  is  mostly  a  rural  phenomenon  in \nIndonesia.  \n \nThe  unemployment  rate  decreased  to  8.14%  in  February  2009  from  8.46%  in  February  2008.However,  stress  in  the  labor \nmarket is showing up in a surge in people entering the informal sector in 2009, with new hire in the formal sector declining to \n400.000  from  about  1.8  million  in  2008.  Public  services  also  remain  inadequate  in  Indonesia  from  a  middle-income  country \nstandard. High malnutrition and maternal mortality rates, inadequate access to safe water and sanitation, and poor education \noutcomes  are  other  dimensions  of  poverty.  Access  to  rural  infrastructure  is  also  limited.  Inequality  has  increased  over  time \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n    \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n43\n\nand disparities between regions remain high, with regional pockets of relatively higher poverty in East Indonesia, Papua, and \nLampung.   \n \nEconomic growth, with rapid formal employment creation and stable prices, remain the most important anti-poverty drivers in \nIndonesia.  The  CSF  supports  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  stimulus  package,  aimed  at  mitigating  the  impact  of  the  crisis\u2014\nparticularly on poor and vulnerable groups\u2014as well as measures aimed at reducing poverty. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nAccording  to  data  from  the  2008  National  Socioeconomic  Survey  (SUSENAS),  the  Government\u2019s  UCT  program  maintained \nthe welfare levels of 60% of household UCT recipients and assisted 30% of recipient households to escape from poverty. The \npolicy  actions  under  the  CSF  support  the  Government  to  maintain  progress  achieved  under  the  UCT  and  other  poverty \nalleviation and social protection programs. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nAs part of program preparation, extensive consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, including the private \nsector, civil society groups, and development partners. \n \n2.

If no, explain why. The CSF process supports the Government\u2019s C&P process.  \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \nThe INO-CS has an indirect gender impact through the National Community Empowerment Program and its role in reducing \npoverty  and  unemployment  by  supporting  an  increase  in  public  expenditure  to  social  services.  The  improved  poverty \norientation of public spending increases women\u2019s access to essential services needed for achieving MDG targets, including \nimproving child and maternal health.  \n \n2.

The  DPL  is  a  series  of  five  annual,  single-tranche  loans  supporting  the \ndevelopment  policy  agenda  of  the  Government  of  Indonesia,  as  envisioned  in  the  national \nmedium term development plan (RPJM). The cluster aims to help the Government achieve its \nmedium-term  growth  and  poverty  reduction  objectives  through  four  core  policy  areas: \nthrough  continued  monitoring  of \n(i) macroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness \nmacroeconomic indicators; (ii) improving the investment climate through regulatory reforms, tax \nand  customs  reforms,  and  strengthening  financial  sector  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises\u2019  (SMEs\u2019)  access  to  finance;  (iii)  improving  public  financial  management  and \ngovernance  by  strengthening  budgeting,  controls,  transparency  and  procurement,  and  civil \nservice  reform;  and  (iv)  improving  delivery  of  public  services  to  the  poor  through  pro-poor \ntargeting of public programs and strengthening community-driven development.  \n \nSupport for the RPJM through parallel cofinancing of the DPSP series is a key pillar of \n2. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  2006\u20132009.2 Under  the  country  strategy  and  program,  a \ndual-track  approach  is  adopted  to  ensure  that  the  high-level  macroeconomic  and  governance \nreforms  supported  through  the  policy  dialogue  of  the  DPSP  series  complement,  and  are \nreinforced by, ADB\u2019s sector programs. The approach involves structuring ADB support through \n(i)  participation  in  the  DPSP  to  strengthen  the  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  framework  while \naddressing  crosscutting  concerns;  and  (ii)  sector-specific  policy  interventions  in  the  areas  of \ninfrastructure,  financial  deepening,  local  government  finance,  and  poverty  reduction  and \naccelerated  progress  toward  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  ADB\u2019s  dual-track \napproach aims to harmonize and align development partner strategies with Indonesia\u2019s country \nstrategy and priorities. Moreover, development partner harmonization around the Government\u2019s \nown programs has bolstered country ownership of the reform process.  \n \n3. \nKey  features.  At  its  inception  in  2004,  the  DPL  series  was  designed  to  support \nIndonesia\u2019s  transition  from  postcrisis  stabilization  to  more  long-term  development.  It  was \nexpected to provide the foundation for continued, medium-term policy engagement in the areas \nof  macroeconomic  stability,  the  investment  climate,  and  public  financial  management  and \nanticorruption. It also provided for a flexible means of taking into account the pace and direction \nof  the  reforms.  Hence,  as  the  program  has  evolved,  the  scope  of  the  reform  agenda  has \nbecome broader. The broadening of the agenda has also been accompanied by deepening of \nreforms,  whereby  successive  DPL  and  PSP  operations  have  built  on  previous  ones  to  ensure \nincremental  implementation.  The  theme  of  the  DPL-1  was  on  restoring  and  maintaining \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  consolidating  macroeconomic  achievements  at  a  time  when \nIndonesia  was  leaving  its  postcrisis  International  Monetary  Fund  program.  In  this  context,  the \nfocus was on macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, the investment climate, and public \nfinancial  management  and  governance.  The  theme  of  the  DPL-2/DPSP-1  progressed  toward \ncreating fiscal space. This led to themes more focused on implementation. The emphasis of the \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  success \n\nDPL-3/DPSP-2 was on utilizing the fiscal space that had been created in the DPL-2 to have a \ngreater  impact  on  service  delivery,  while  the  theme  of  the  DPL-4/DPSP-3  carried  this  further \nforward by deepening the process of institutional reform. Reflecting the flexibility of the program \nand \nin  achieving  macroeconomic  stability  and  attaining \nmacroeconomic  triggers  ahead  of  time,  the  Government  and  development  partners  agreed  in \nearly 2006 to remove the macroeconomic pillar for the DPL-4/DPSP-3, but to continue the policy \ndialogue on macroeconomic stability. At the same time, the increased fiscal space generated by \nreduction  in  fuel  subsidies,  declining  debt  service  payments,  and  increasing  revenues  had \nopened up opportunities for a greater focus on public service delivery as a new policy area. \n \n4. \nAccomplishments. Policy actions under the macroeconomic pillar relating to debt and \nfiscal  policy  management  contributed  considerably  to  lower  levels  of  debt  to  GDP  and  a \nconsiderable increase in non-oil tax revenues. Rating agencies have also cited debt reduction \nand  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms,  including  changes  to  the  investment  law, \ncustoms and tax reforms, and fiscal reforms\u2014all activities supported by the DPL/DPSP\u2014as the \nreason  for  recent  sovereign  rating  upgrades.  Policy  actions  supported  under  the  investment \nclimate have led to significant improvements in business start-up times, value-added tax (VAT) \nrefund  times,  and  the  establishment  of  a  sounder  and  sustainable  financial  safety  net. \nDPL/DPSP  policy  measures  have  also  supported  revisions  to  the  Tax  Law  in  2008,  the \nimplementing  decree  relating  to  tax  audit  procedures,  implementation  decrees  supporting  the \ninvestment law, and the rollout of a national single window with online clearance of merchandise. \nA key achievement under the public financial management pillar has been the implementation of \nthe Treasury Single Account to improve cash management of public finances. The DPL/DPSP \nhas helped move forward reforms to reengineer business processes across the budget cycle.  \n \n5. \nThe  national  budget  is  now  compatible  with  the  international  standard  government \nfinance  statistics  classification.  Fiscal  reporting  is  more  comprehensive  and  timely,  and \nelements of a medium-term expenditure framework have been introduced, although they are not \nfully  operational  in  the  budget  system.  Initial  steps  to  address  civil  service  reform  have  also \nbeen  launched.  As  an  initial  measure,  the  DPL/DPSP  supported  the  development  of  a \ncomprehensive  reform  of  the  structure  and  remuneration  framework  for  high-ranking  state \nofficials. A task force was set up to examine the entire compensation package with the goal of \ncreating a more transparent, systematic, and coherent framework for pay and allowances based \non  a  comprehensive  job  evaluation  and  pay  grading.  Building  on  this,  the  Ministry  of  Finance \nhas  developed  a  comprehensive  civil  service  reform  action  plan,  which  is  being  pilot  tested  in \nother agencies. Important steps were also established to help lay the groundwork for improving \npoverty targeting of basis services. As the 2005 fuel price hike made available more funds for \nsocial spending, the DPL/DPSP supported building capacity in government institutions to create \na  more  evaluative  institutional  framework  that  would  improve  the  targeting  of  these  released \nfunds.  Lessons  from  targeting  were  incorporated  into  the  new  cash  transfer  program  that \naccompanied the May 2008 fuel price increase. The DPSP/DPL also supported critical actions \nto improve the quality of public service delivery in education and community-based development. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Public  Expenditure  Support  Facility  (PESF)3 is  part  of  a  joint  effort  of  the  World \n6. \nBank,  ADB,  Government  of  Australia,  and  Government  of  Japan  to  support  a  common  crisis-\nmitigating  action  agenda  with  the  Government  of  Indonesia,  and  provide  contingent  budget \n\nPublic Expenditure Support Facility  \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2009.

The  PESF  complements  the  World  Bank\u2019s  DPL  and  ADB\u2019s  DPSP \nseries,  which  reflect  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms  over  the  medium \nterm. \n \n7. \nUnder the PESF, the Government will implement a series of confidence-boosting policy \nmeasures  aimed  at  sending  a  strong  positive  signal  to  the  markets,  making  it  more  likely  that \nIndonesia  will  meet  its  commercial  market  borrowing  targets  for  2009. These  policy  measures \naddress the increased short-term vulnerabilities and risks to the Indonesian economy from the \nglobal financial crisis and sharp slowdown in the global economy, and underpin the key priorities \nof  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  These  measures  include  actions  to  (i) reassure  financial \nmarkets  and  maintain  financial  system  stability,  (ii) sustain  critical  public  expenditures  while \nmaintaining  budget  discipline  to  mitigate  the  poverty  impacts  of  the  growth  slowdown,  and \n(iii) crowd in private investment and support exports.  \n\n \n\n8. \nKey features of the PESF include (i) a single tranche loan with scheduled and multiple \nwithdrawals;  (ii)  a  small  number  of  high-impact  policy  measures  designed  to  address  the \nadverse impacts of the ongoing financial crisis completed prior to consideration by ADB\u2019s Board \nof Directors; (iii) a financing plan for the Government\u2019s projected gross financing needs for 2009, \nincluding  projected  commercial  borrowings  in  the  domestic  and  international  markets;  and \n(iv) withdrawals  of  the  loan  amount  to  be  made  when  the  drawdown  triggers  set  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  financing  plan  are  met  and  the  policy  measures  introduced  under  the  Program \ncontinue to remain in place. In this way, the PESF program mirrors features of the World Bank\u2019s \nPESF parallel cofinancing loan of a development  policy loan with a deferred drawdown option \nwhereby  subsequent  withdrawals  of  the  single  tranche  loan  are  contingent  on  the  drawdown \ntriggers  set  out  in  the  financing  plan  being  met.  Under  the  best  case  scenario,  where  the \nGovernment meets all of its financing targets from market sources, in which the global financial \nconditions  do  not  deteriorate  substantially,  and  approval  of  the  PESF  sends  a  strong  positive \nmarket signal, no withdrawal would be expected under the PESF. Under a second scenario, in \nwhich the market condition remains tight and the drawdown triggers set out in the financing plan \nare  met,  the  Government  can  exercise  its  options  to  access  the  PESF  funds.  Under  a  third \nscenario,  in  which  there  is  a  sharp  deterioration  in  the  global  financial  market  creating \nmacroeconomic  instability  and/or  a  balance-of-payments  crisis,  the  PESF  is  unlikely  to  be \neffective and Indonesia will need crisis mitigation support. \n \n9. \nThe Government has indicated that its first preference is to use its access to domestic \nand/or  international  markets  to  meet  its  financing  targets.  The  financing  plan  incorporates \nquarterly  targets  for  rupiah  and  US  dollar  bond  issuances.  Under  the  financing  plan,  the \nGovernment has projected financing requirements from the market of $12.5 billion equivalent for \n2009.  However,  in  the  event  of  tight  market  conditions,  the  Government  and  development \npartners  have  established  broad  parameters  on  the  basis  of  which  the  Government  may \nwithdraw the $5.5 billion funds available from the PESF to meet its quarterly financing shortfall \nduring  the  program  period.  The  Government  and  development  partners  will  assess  the \nGovernment\u2019s financing shortfall every quarter and determine if disbursement from the PESF is \nrequired.  \n \n10. \ncommitted to the principles that the loan would be used only in the following circumstances: \n \n\nIn  line  with  the  financing  plan,  the  Government  and  development  partners  have \n\n(i) \n\nSound  macroeconomic  framework.  The  overall  macroeconomic  situation \ncontinues  to  be  sound  and  the  policy  program  on  track.  However,  given  the \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nglobal  financing  crisis  and  the  importance  of  the  Government\u2019s  financing  plan, \nthe development partners and the Government have decided that a review of the \nGovernment\u2019s macroeconomic policy framework and its progress in carrying out \nthe PESF (including its financing plan) will be undertaken on a quarterly basis in \naccordance with the jointly agreed governance arrangements. \nLimited market access. Indonesia has limited market access because of global \nand/or domestic liquidity constraints, so it needs access to the facility to maintain \npublic spending and/or requires additional fiscal stimulus. The withdrawals will be \nlinked  to  Indonesia\u2019s  access  to  market  finance,  where  access  will  be  assessed \nfrom a set of objective criteria.    \nPhased  withdrawals. Withdrawals  from  the  PESF  are  phased  as  needed.  The \nfull  amount  of  the  loan  is  unlikely  to  be  required  at  once.  Therefore,  the \nGovernment  has  articulated  a  schedule  of  withdrawals  in  line  with  its  financing \nplan.  It  is  expected  that  the  loan  will  be  withdrawn  each  quarter  after  the  joint \ngovernment  and  development  partner  review  meeting,  with  a  cap  on  the \nmaximum amount that can be drawn down each quarter.  \nProportionate  disbursement  from  development  partners. The financing plan \nindicates  that  if  the  withdrawal  is  warranted,  the  Government  will  draw  down \nsupport  from  development  partners  proportional  to  their  commitment.  This  way, \nthe support and risk would be spread across all the partners participating in the \nPESF.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n11. \nThe financing plan includes a governance arrangement that allows the Government and \nits  development  partners,  including  ADB,  to  meet  in  the  quarterly  meetings  or  extraordinary \nmeetings  to  (i)  assess  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic  policy  framework,  (ii)  evaluate \nprogress  in  implementation  of  the  financing  plan,  and  (iii)  determine  the  amount  that  the \nGovernment  will  draw  on  support  provided  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  The \nGovernment and any development partner could also request additional meetings to respond to \nevolving  economic  conditions.  In  the  event  that  the  Government  proposes  changes  to  the \nfinancing  plan,  but  the changes  do  not  involve  a  change  to  the  objective  of  the  financing  plan \n(such as changes in the Government\u2019s financing targets or its market access parameters), these \nwill be done on a consensus basis with the Government and other development partners. The \nrevisions  to  the  parameters  will  be  guided  by,  but  not  limited  to,  the  following  considerations: \n(i) inflation rate, (ii) increased cost of bonds with longer maturities, (iii) bond maturities structure \nand  volume  consistent  with  past  practice  and  prudent  debt  management,  and  (iv)  possible \ncrowding effects on the private sector. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n    \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n49\n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\nLoan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  currency  expenditures  for the  reasonable cost  of \n\n1. \nimported goods required during the Countercyclical Support for Indonesia.  \n \n2. \n \n\nNo withdrawals will be made for the following: \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  included  in  the  following  groups  or  subgroups  of  the \nUnited  Nations  Standard  International  Trade  Classification,  Revision  3  (SITC, \nRev. 3) or any successor groups or subgroups under future revisions to the SITC, \nas designated by the Asian Development Bank by notice to the Borrower: \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n112 \n121 \n122 \n\n525 \n667 \n718 \n\n728 \n897 \n\n971 \n\nChapter  Heading \n\nDescription of Items \n\nTable A8: Ineligible Items \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n718.70 \n\n728.43 \n897.30 \n\nAlcoholic beverages \nTobacco, unmanufactured; tobacco refuse \nTobacco, manufactured (whether or not containing tobacco \nsubstitute \nRadioactive and associated materials \nPearls, precious and semiprecious stones, unworked or worked \nNuclear reactors, and parts thereof, fuel elements (cartridges), \nnonirradiated for nuclear reactors \nTobacco processing machinery \nJewelry of gold, silver, or platinum-group metals (except watches \nand watch cases) and goldsmiths\u2019 or silversmiths\u2019 wares \n(including set gems) \nGold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ore and concentrates) \n\nSource: United Nations. \n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nexpenditures  in  the  currency  of  the  Borrower  or  of  goods  supplied  from  the \nterritory of the Borrower; \nexpenditures  for  goods  supplied  under  a  contract  that  any  national  or \ninternational  financing  institution  or  agency  will  have  financed  or  has  agreed  to \nfinance,  including  any  contract  financed  under  any  loans  or  grants  from  Asian \nDevelopment Bank; \nexpenditures  for  goods  intended  for  a  military  or  paramilitary  purpose  or  for \nluxury consumption; \nexpenditures for narcotics; \nexpenditures  for  environmentally  hazardous  goods,  the  manufacture,  use,  or \nimport  of  which  is  prohibited  under  the  laws  of  the  Borrower  or  international \nagreements to which the Borrower is a party; and \nexpenditures  on  account  of  any  payment  prohibited  by  the  Borrower  in \ncompliance  with  a  decision  of  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  taken  under \nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nFISCAL STIMULUS PACKAGES\u2014INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE \n\n \n1. \nThis  appendix  summarizes  the  determinants  of  the  size  and  composition  of  fiscal \nstimulus packages and draws on the findings a number of recent International Monetary Fund \n(IMF)  cross-country  studies. 1 Two  sets  of  factors  help  explain  the  relative  size  of  stimulus \npackages: (i) differences across countries in the need for stimulus, and (ii) differences in fiscal \nspace. \n \nNeed  for  stimulus.  The  magnitude  of  the  overall  fiscal  expansion  (including  both \n2. \ndiscretionary  and  nondiscretionary  components)  should  depend  on  the  size  of  the  output  gap \nthat  each  country  faces  in  the  absence  of  fiscal  support.  The  fiscal  expansion  in  a  particular \ncountry should also be larger if multipliers are lower.   \n \n3. \nComposition  of  stimulus.  Fiscal  stimulus  packages  are  typically  comprised  of  (i)  tax-\nrelated measures, (ii) social sector spending, and (iii) infrastructure expenditures. However, the \nweight  given  to  any  one  of  these  components  depends  on  preexisting  fiscal  characteristics. \nCountries  in  which  the  automatic  stabilizers  are  smaller  (e.g.,  those  that  have  less  extensive \nsocial benefits programs) will require greater discretionary stimulus\u2014this is true of most of the \ncountries  in  Asia  in  relation  to  developed  economies.  Tax  stimulus  measures  can  be \nimplemented  relatively  quickly  and  their  impact  is  already  being  felt  in  the  fiscal  accounts. \nExpenditure  measures,  however,  tend  to  proceed  more  slowly,  reflecting  normal  budgetary \ncontrols and typical start-up delays in new programs. Multipliers, however, tend to be higher for \nexpenditure-related stimulus measures than for tax-related ones. A recent IMF paper suggests \nthat  in  a  global  recession  fiscal  multipliers  for  an  individual  economy  will  be  higher  if  other \ncountries  operate  fiscal  stimulus  programs  through  spillovers  to  imports,  than  if  an  individual \ncountry  operates  a  fiscal  expansion  in  isolation.2 The  fiscal  multipliers  are  larger  if  monetary \npolicy is also accommodative.  \n \nDifferences  in  fiscal  space.  Key  factors  that  determine  a  country\u2019s  fiscal  space  to \n4. \nexpand include levels of deficits, public debt, contingent liabilities, and interest rates. Countries \nfacing  relatively  higher  real  interest  rates  or  elevated  debt  levels  have  less  room  to  expand; \ncompeting crisis-related needs, such as that for financial sector support (mainly in the US and \nEurope), are also factors in determining available fiscal space. \n \n5. \nIncreasing  fiscal  space.  The  available  fiscal  space  can  be  increased  through \nappropriate policy  design.  Ideally,  a  larger  fiscal  expansion in  times  of economic  crisis  can  be \naccommodated  if  policy  design  increases  the  likelihood  of  a  fiscal  tightening  once  conditions \nimprove, to ensure long-term fiscal solvency. In this respect, the IMF has offered a number of \nrecommendations: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nStimulus  packages  should  not  have  permanent  effects  on  deficits.  Table  A9.1 \nprovides  a  cross-country  comparison  of  stimulus  packages  in  terms  of  the \npermanent or temporary nature of their fiscal impact. \nMedium-term  fiscal  frameworks  should  clarify  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \nfiscal correction once economic conditions improve. \n\n                                                 \n1   IMF.  2009.

The  necessary  effort  for  each  country  to \nstabilize  its  level  of  debt  and  ensure  long-run  fiscal  sustainability  will  depend  on  its  own \ncircumstances.3 In this respect, emerging economies in Southeast Asia may be more favorably \nplaced  than  most  advanced  economies  as  they  have  lower  initial  debt  positions,  and  are  less \nsubject  to  fiscal  challenges  brought  about  by  aging  populations.  Table  A9.2  provides  a  cross-\ncountry comparison of debt positions and the debt-stabilizing primary balance needed to bring \ndebt down to threshold levels commensurate with maintaining market confidence as estimated \nby  the  IMF.4 As  can  be  seen  from  Table  A9.2,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Indonesia,  the \nPhilippines, and  Malaysia  only  require  primary  budget  balances  in  the  range  of  0.3%\u20131.1%  of \ngross domestic product (GDP) to stabilize debt.   \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3   The  debt\u2013gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  ratio  evolves  according  to  the  identity: \u0394  (D/Y),  =  (r-g/1+g)(D/Y)t-1-pb, \nwhere D is the debt stock, Y is GDP, r is the nominal interest rate, g is the nominal growth rate, pb is the primary \nfiscal balance as a share of GDP, and \u0394 indicates a change over the previous year. The debt ratio is constant when \npb = (D/Y)(r-g)/(1+g). \n\n4  The threshold may be higher for some countries such as the US. \n\n \n\n\f5\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n9\n \n\ni\n\nTable A9.1: Composition of Fiscal Stimulus Packages \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nS \n\nITA \n\nJAP  UK  US \n\nINO  PHI  VIE  MAL  SIN  THA \n\n \nSelected SERD economies \n\n \nMajor developed economies \n\nMajor \nemerging \neconomies \nIND  PRC  CAN  FRA  GER \n\n \n \n \nItem \nExpenditure \nInfrastructure \ninvestment \nSupport to \nSME/farmers \nSafety nets \n \nHousing/ construction \nsupport \nStrategic industries \nsupport \nIncrease in public \nwages \nOther \n \nRevenue \nCorporate income tax/ \ndepreciation/incentives \nPersonal income tax/ \nexemptions/deductions \nIndirect tax \nreductions/exemptions \nOther \n \nCAN  =  Canada,  FRA  =  France,  GER  =    Germany,  IND  =  India,  INO  =  Indonesia,  ITA  =  Italy,  JAP  =  Japan,  MAL  =  Malaysia,  P  =  permanent  measures  (with \nrecurrent  fiscal  costs),  PHI  =  Philippines,  PRC  =  People's  Republic  of  China,  S  =  self-reversing  measures  (costs  are  recouped  by  compensatory  measures  in \nfuture years), S: self-reversing measures (costs are recouped by compensatory measures in future years), SERD = Southeast Asia Department, SIN = Singapore, \nT = temporary measures (with explicit sunset provisions or time-bound spending), THA = Thailand, UK = United Kingdom, US = United States, VIE = Viet Nam. \nSource: Country Authorities, Asian Development Bank, International Monetary Fund. \n\nP \n\nP \n\nS \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nP \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\nT \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n53 \n\nTable A9.2: Debt and Primary Balance \n(% of GDP) \n\nPre-crisis WEO projections  \n\nCurrent WEO projections \n\nDebt \n\nPB \n\nDebt \n\nPB \n\n2009 \n\n2012 \n\n2009 \n\n2012 \n\n2009 \n\n2014 \n\n2009 \n\n2014 \n\nDebt-stabilizing \nPB or PB needed \nto bring debt to \nbenchmark levela \n\n61.0 \n63.0 \n61.1 \n104.1 \n194.2 \n42.9 \n63.4 \n13.4 \n\n51.3 \n60.5 \n59.4 \n102.0 \n189.6 \n42.5 \n65.8 \n11.2 \n\n1.2 \n(0.3) \n2.1 \n2.5 \n(1.8) \n(0.5) \n(0.8) \n(0.4) \n\n0.5 \n0.8 \n2.0 \n2.6 \n(0.2) \n0.2 \n(0.3) \n(0.6) \n\n75.6 \n77.4 \n79.8 \n117.3 \n217.4 \n68.6 \n88.8 \n20.9 \n\n65.4 \n95.5 \n91.4 \n132.2 \n239.2 \n99.7 \n112.0 \n21.3 \n\n(3.5) \n(5.3) \n(2.3) \n(0.9) \n(9.0) \n(10.0) \n(12.3) \n(3.8) \n\n(0.4) \n(2.1) \n1.9 \n0.5 \n(5.1) \n(3.8) \n0.3 \n(0.4) \n\n1.0 \n3.1 \n2.8 \n5.8 \n9.8 \n3.4 \n4.3 \n0.2 \n\n69.8 \n32.8 \n40.7 \n45.1 \n\n0.2 \n0.1 \n(1.1) \n2.2 \n\n0.5 \n0.6 \n(1.6) \n1.9 \n\n61.5 \n27.7 \n35.8 \n42.7 \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, PB = primary budget balance. \na Average primary balance needed to stabilize debt at end-2014 level if the respective debt-to-GDP ratio is less than 60 \npercent for advanced economies or 40 percent for emerging market economies (no shading); or to bring debt ratio to 60 \npercent  (halve  for  Japan  and  reduce  to  40  percent  for  emerging  market  economies)  in  2029  (shaded  entries).
