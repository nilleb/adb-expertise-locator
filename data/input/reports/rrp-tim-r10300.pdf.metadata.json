The  roads  have  been\ndamaged  in  many  locations and  can  only  carry  very  small  loads.\nHumanitarian  aid  and  military  vehicles  have  been  lost  in  river\ncrossings  and  one  person  died  on  a  steep  and  weak\nembankment.  Food aid  is  flown  in  at  the  cost  of  $1,000  per  ton.\nBecause of Dili Port's extremely limited capacity, it has become a\nbottleneck  to  channelling  humanitarian  aid  to  the  population.\nPower supply is needed to facilitate water supply and is essential\nto  health  services,  but  most  of \nthe  power  stations  are\nunoperational  due  to  damage  and  because  operating  staff  and\nfuel are lacking. Restoration of power supply will enable operation\nof borehole water pumps, provision of emergency health care, and\nresumption of economic activities.\n\nthe  port \n\nThe  Project  will  (i)  undertake  emergency  road  repair  works  to\nfacilitate  efficient  transport  of  humanitarian  aid  and  help  revive\nto  reduce\neconomic  activity;  (ii)  expand \ncongestion,  and  (iii)  reinstate power  supply.  The  Project  will  also\nsupport \nthe  power  sector,  and\nimplementation of transport sector institutions. The closely related\nADB technical assistance (TA) 3401: Transport Sector Restoration\nProject will help establish management of the transport subsectors\nand  support,  in  tandem  with  the  Project,  implementation  of\nefficient management mechanisms and institutions.\n\nfinancial  management  of \n\nfacilities \n\nThe Project has been classified as environmental category B. An\ninitial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken,  and \nits\nsummary is a core appendix.\n\nThe  immediate  benefits  of  the  Project  include  facilitating  the  (i)\nprovision of food supplies to famine stricken areas, (ii) provision of\nagricultural  supplies  to  enable  cultivation,  (iii)  resettlement  of\ninternally  displaced  persons  and  refugees,  and  (iv)  movement  of\nthe United Nations Peacekeeping Forces. The Project will employ\npeople  especially  in  rural  areas,  where  poverty  is  extreme  and\nmost  people  do  not  have  income-generating  opportunities.  The\nuse  of  local  labor  will  stimulate  the  economy  and  thus  help  the\nreconstruction of the communities.\n\nThe beneficiaries of the power component are primarily the urban\nand semiurban population. The reinstatement of power  supply will\nmake possible provision of essential services such as water supply,\nhospitals, schools, commercial establishments, and industries.\n\n\fiii\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nCost Estimates\n\nand Financing Plan\n\nThe  United  Nations  Transitional Administration  in  East  Timor  will\nbe  the  recipient  of  the  grant.  The  Project  will  be  executed  and\nimplemented  by  a  project  management  unit  (PMU),  comprising\nfive East Timorese project management staff and five international\ncounterparts including a chief technical adviser. A project steering\ncommittee involving broad stakeholder representation will monitor\nimplementation.\n\nThe total Project cost is estimated at $29.8 million equivalent. The\nProject will be financed by a grant of $29.8 million from the Trust\nFund for East Timor (TFET). These funds  have  been  contributed\ninclude  resources  from  the  Asian\nby  donors  and  do  not \nDevelopment  Bank \nInternational  Development\n(ADB).  The \nAssociation of the World Bank Group is the Trustee of TFET.\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 31 December 2002.\n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date\n\n31 May 2002.\n\nProcurement of Goods\n\nand Services\n\nCivil works will be awarded on the basis of international shopping\nand  international  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nInternational  contractors  are\nGuidelines  on  Procurement. \nencouraged  to  include  joint-venture  arrangements  with  local\ncontractors  and  will  utilize \nlabor-intensive  methodologies.\nEligibility  for  procurement  and  engagement  of  consultants  will\ninclude  ADB  member  countries,  East  Timor,  and  all  donors  and\nmembers  of  international  organizations  that  have  contributed  to\nthe TFET.\n\nInternational consulting services will be required for the PMU and\nconstruction  supervision.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of\ndomestic consultants.\n\n\f\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  information  the  following  report  on  a  project  grant  to  the  United\nNations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor  (UNTAET)  for  the  benefit  of  East  Timor\nfrom  the  Trust  Fund for  East  Timor  (TFET)  for  the  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation\nProject.1 The Project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nThe  UNTAET  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  prepare\nemergency  assistance  to  rehabilitate  the  damaged  infrastructure  for  early  restoration  of\nnormal socioeconomic activities. An ADB appraisal mission2 visited East Timor from 7 to 18\nFebruary  2000  and  prepared  the  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  Project  with  the\nauthorized  UNTAET  representatives.  The  agreements  reached  were  confirmed  in  a\nmemorandum of understanding. Funding for the Project will be drawn from the TFET, which is\nestablished  under  the  trusteeship  of  the  International  Development  Association  (IDA)  of  the\nWorld Bank Group. The TFET does not include ADB\u2019s own resources. The Project has been\nprepared in accordance with Doc. R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund\nfor East Timor, approved by the Board on 23 March 2000, and also in accordance with ADB\u2019s\npolicies  and  procedures  for  rehabilitation  assistance  after  disasters  (Doc.  R191-88,  Rev.  1,\nFinal), including disasters caused by civil strife. Doc. R191-88 specifically allows for shortened\nprocessing  procedures  and  flexibility  in  implementation  arrangements  for  such  assistance.\nNegotiations of the Grant Agreement for the Project were completed with the UNTAET on 29\nMarch in the field.\n\nA. \n\nDescription of Damage\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n3.\nIn  the  democratic  consultation  of  30  August  1999,  the  people  of  East  Timor  voted\noverwhelmingly  for  independence.  During  the  following  month,  East  Timor  experienced  a\ncampaign  of  destruction  and  terror,  during  which  three  quarters  of  the  population  fled  their\nhomes  and  most  of  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  and  private  homes  were  destroyed.  In  the\nwestern  half  of  the  territory  and  the  highland  areas,  all  property  of  value  were  removed,\nburned, or destroyed, including residential and public buildings, utilities, telecommunications\nfacilities, inventories of essential food, and agriculture stocks. The eastern half experienced\nsimilar  attacks  with  an  estimated  75  percent  of  residential  buildings  destroyed.  East  Timor\nremains only partially inhabited. Refugees are gradually returning from West Timor  and  the\nforest,  with  the  support  of  humanitarian  relief  coordinated  by  the  Office  for  Coordination  of\nthe  postconsultation  destruction,  all\nHumanitarian  Affairs  (OCHA).  Consequent \nadministrative structures are dysfunctional. This includes public offices tasked to manage the\ninfrastructure sectors. All public documentation and premises have been destroyed.\n\nto \n\n                                                       \n1\n\n2\n\nThe Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 2000.\nThe  mission  comprised  S.  Jarvenpaa,  Project  Economist  (Mission  Leader);  E.  Ouano,  Sr.  Environmental\nSpecialist;  M.  Carr,  Road  Engineer/Consultant;  M.  Lewis,  Energy  Engineer/Consultant;  E.  To,  United  Nations\nDevelopment  Programme  Infrastructure  Specialist;  K.  Lonngren,  Energy  Adviser,  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,\nFinland; E. da Silva, Counterpart Team Leader; J. Alves, Counterpart Road Engineer; V. Guterrez, Counterpart\nPower Specialist; and F. Guterrez, Counterpart Port Specialist.\n\n\f2\n\nB.\n\nResponse to Crisis\n\n1. \n\nUNTAET Organization\n\n4.\nUnder  a  resolution  of  the  Security  Council  of  the  United  Nations  (UN),  the  UNTAET\nwas established with powers to (i) ensure stability, (ii) establish a transitional government, and\n(iii) establish the judiciary, laws, and policies. The UNTAET will administer East Timor for 2-3\nyears, when general elections are planned. The UNTAET  is headed by an administrator and\ncomprises \nthree  sections:  (i)  humanitarian  assistance,  (ii)  public  administration  and\ngovernance,  and  (iii)  the  United  Nations  Peacekeeping  Force  (UNPKF).  Each  section  is\nheaded by a deputy special representative of the Secretary General (DSRSG). Management of\ninfrastructure sectors  is a  responsibility of the head  of  infrastructure,  who  is  a  UNTAET  staff\nmember under the public administration and governance section,  and  is supported by a  staff\nperson  responsible  for  telecommunications,  postal  services,  electricity,  water  and  sanitation,\ntransport and roads, port management, and civil aviation. The UNTAET\u2019s organization chart is\nin  Appendix  2.  The  UNTAET\u2019s  recurrent  budget  is  drawn  from  its  trust  fund  using  UN\ndisbursement guidelines. For the first quarter of 2000, transport has been allocated a recurrent\nbudget of $390,000 and electricity, $825,000. The  allocations  will be  reassessed for the next\nquarter. Under the UN disbursement guidelines, the allocations will be used for salaries of East\nTimorese  employees  and  recurrent  consumables  such  as  fuel.  The  UNTAET\u2019s  financial\nadministration  will  be  strengthened  with  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  technical\nassistance  (TA).  The  UNTAET's  financial  year  runs  from  1  August  to  31  July.  The  National\nConsultative  Council  (NCC)  comprising  representatives  of  the  UNTAET,  East  Timorese  civil\nsociety,  and  Catholic  church,  coordinates  UNTAET  activities  with  East  Timor  civil  society.\nCurrently, the UNTAET chairs sector committees to coordinate sector activities among donors,\nUN agencies, and nongovernment ogranizations (NGOs).\n\nThe  capital  development  budget,  to  be  drawn  from  the  TFET,  was  assessed  by  a\n5.\nWorld  Bank-coordinated  and  multiagency  joint  assessment  mission  (JAM)  in  October-\nNovember  1999.  The  JAM  identified  needs  for  TA  and  investment  projects  in  consultation\nwith the National Council for East Timorese Resistance (CNRT), World Bank, and UNTAET,\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the International Force for East Timor\n(Interfet).  During  the  JAM,  ADB  reviewed  transport  sector  restoration  and  development\nrequirements in the short term (1-2 years) and medium term (2-3 years).\n\n2.\n\nImpact of Crisis on Poverty\n\n6.\nIn  1996,  when East  Timor  was  part of  Indonesia,  its gross  domestic  product  (GDP)\nper capita income was $431. The Indonesian national average was $1,153. As a result of the\n1997 Asian crisis, GDP in Indonesia including East Timor declined as the devaluation of the\nIndonesian  rupiah  and  high  interest  rates  dampened  economic  activities  throughout\nSoutheast  Asia.  Indonesia  was  the  country  hit  hardest  by  the  Asian  crisis,  and  poverty\nincreased.  However,  the  decline  in  East  Timor's  GDP  was  more  pronounced  due  to  its\ndependence  on  Indonesian  central government  grants,  which  financed  up  to  85  percent  of\nthe  current  and  capital  expenditure.  Between  1997  and  the  1999  referendum,  the  East\nTimorese  GDP  was  estimated  to  have  contracted  by  25  percent  as  a  result  of  the  Asian\nfinancial  crisis.  In  1996,  30  percent  of  the  households  were  living  in  poverty\u2014double  the\nnational average in Indonesia. The number of households living below the poverty line rose\nto an estimated 50-60 percent as the result of the Asian crisis.\n\n\f3\n\nOn 4 September 1999, the results of the democratic referendum were announced to\n7.\nfavor  independence.  The  ensuing  violence  resulted  in  extensive  damage  to  private  and\npublic  buildings,  their  contents,  and  basic  infrastructure.  About  75  percent  of  the\ninfrastructure  was  destroyed  and  GDP  declined  to  half  or  less  of  its  previous  level.  About\n175,000  people  were displaced  out of East  Timor  and  reduced  to  acute  poverty  in  refugee\ncamps. Another 200,000 people were displaced within East Timor. More than 50 percent of\nthe total population were dislocated by the violence. Although an estimated 118,000 people\nhave  returned  to  their  villages,  a  large  portion  of  the  population  faces  starvation  as  their\ncrops, seeds,  and  other  means  of  livelihood  were  destroyed.  The  international  community,\nspecifically  through  the  World  Food  Programme  (WFP),  has  been  distributing  food  and\nseeds. Even the small East Timorese middle and upper income groups were not spared from\npoverty  as  banks  and  their  records  were  burned.  The  banking  sector  in  East  Timor  was\nexclusively serviced by Indonesian banks, and only three have plans to reopen and possibly\nsettle  depositors\u2019  claims.  Up  to  80  percent  of  the  East  Timorese  could  be  living  below  the\npoverty  line  and  a  large  portion  are  facing  starvation.  However,  the  food  stability  would\nimprove if agriculture recovers as expected this year. WFP estimates that by the end of the\nyear 2000, a considerable portion of the population will no longer be at risk of starvation, and\nWFP will then be able to scale down its intervention.\n\nThe  savings  rates of  families  who  find  employment  in  the  reconstruction  activities,  or\n8.\nthose  able  to  harvest  crops  in  2000,  are  expected  to  be  very  low  for  the  next  five  years.  A\nconsiderable  portion  of  these  incomes  will  be  used  for  rebuilding  residences,  replacing  their\ncontents,  and  rebuilding  livelihoods.  The  current  living  conditions  are  extremely  poor,\naggravated  by a very high  level of unemployment.  The population  is  surviving  on  day-to-day\naccess  to  nourishment.  Burned  houses  are  temporarily  rebuilt  using  plastic  sheets,  tenting\nmaterials,  and  scraps. While  reconstruction  activities  are  expected  to  generate  employment,\nthe neglect of basic infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports, and power supply facilities has\nincreased the cost of moving goods and services within the country. For example, travel from\nDili  to  Ainaro  now  costs  $4.30  compared  to  $0.70  a  year  ago.  Food  prices  increased  by  as\nmuch as 200 percent during the two months of the violence. These have since declined due to\nintervention from the international community. While the  risk of starvation  is being overcome,\ninfrastructure bottlenecks hamper the aid delivery and economic recovery.\n\n3.\n\nRestoration Programs\n\nIn  response  to  the  crisis,  the  United  Nations  Mission  in  East  Timor  (UNAMET)\n9.\nestablished  emergency  services  and  humanitarian  assistance  of  the  UN  and  bilateral\nagencies. The Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\u2019 short-term needs assessment,\nthe Consolidated Appeal, identified immediate humanitarian needs for the first three months\nfrom  December  1999  to  March  2000  in  the  amount  of  $199  million.  These  do  not  include\nrestoration of the infrastructure.\n\n10.\nTo  plan  for  the  urgent  medium-term  rehabilitation  in  a  coordinated  manner,  ADB\njoined  the  JAM  in  October-November  1999.  A  concurrent  IMF  mission  assessed  the\nmacroeconomic parameters and prepared an initial macroeconomic framework. As a result,\nADB and the World Bank have agreed to work together to assist the East Timorese people\nand  UNTAET  in  the  reconstruction  and  socioeconomic  development  of  the  country.  In\nparticular, during the Tokyo donors\u2019 conference of 17 December 1999, representatives of the\ntwo institutions and other donors have endorsed the cooperative use of grant resources from\nthe TFET. ADB is to be the lead agency for restoring the infrastructure sector including the\n\n\f4\n\ntransport, energy, telecommunications, and water and sanitation. ADB's Board has approved\ndelegated  approval  of  project  proposals  by  ADB's  Management,  expanded  eligibility  under\nADB's  procurement  guidelines,  disbursement  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB's\ndisbursement  guidelines,  and  the  establishment  of  grant  agreements  of  projects  funded\nunder the TFET.3\n\n11.\nConcurrently with the JAM, UNDP commissioned a short-term needs assessment  in\nthe  infrastructure  sectors  covering,  inter  alia,  roads,  ports,  and  energy.  UNDP  does  not,\nhowever, have the resources to address the identified emergency infrastructure rehabilitation\nrequirements.  Subsequently,  UNDP  has  endorsed  ADB\u2019s  lead-agency  mandate  in  the\ninfrastructure sectors and in preparing the Project.\n\nThe  ADB-funded  TA  3401:  Transport  Sector  Restoration  Project4  will  implement\n12.\nADB\u2019s  first  intervention  in  the  three  transport  subsectors  by  taking  steps  to  establish  the\ninstitutions  and  regulatory  frameworks  in  the  road,  port,  and  airport  subsectors,  and  by\nreviewing the long-term development requirements to enable these subsectors to contribute\nto poverty reduction and economic growth. The Project will be integrated with this process. In\nthe  power  subsector,  Portugal  will  assist  the  UNTAET  to  establish  a  power  utility  and  the\nProject  will  support  development  of  financial  management.  ADB  has  undertaken  port  and\nairport subsector pricing studies that advise the UNTAET on immediately implementable user\ncharges. A similar study will be conducted in the power subsector in March 2000.\n\nC.\n\nTransport Subsector Description\n\n13.\nThe transport system in East Timor is multimodal, comprising about 8,000 kilometers\n(km)  of  roads,  1,400  km  being  major  arteries;  one  container  port,  three  smaller  wharves,\nsmall jetties, and landings; and two international airports and eight grass airstrips. The past\ndemand  for  the  transport  system  in  East  Timor  has  been  that  of  a  provincial  economy.\nInternal traffic in East Timor depends on land transport. The domestic  maritime  transport  is\ncurrently  limited  and  has  potential  for  growth.  Infrastructure  has  been  constructed  under\nIndonesian  central  government  budget.  Only  limited,  if  any,  maintenance  has  been  carried\nout.  While  there  is  no  evidence  of  physical  damage  to  the  transport  infrastructure,  the\npostreferendum  violence  resulted  in  the  removal  and  destruction  of  all  transport-related\nproperty, including equipment and vehicles. Infrastructure has also suffered from a long-term\nlack of maintenance.\n\n1. \n\nRoads\n\na.\n\nDescription\n\n14.\nEast Timor is 265 km long and 92 km wide, with a central mountain spine closer to the\nnorthern than to  the southern  coast.  The highland is  typically  precipitous,  but  rarely  exceeds\n3,000  meters  (m).  The  predominant  geology  in  the  highland  area  is  lightly  consolidated\nsedimentary materials overlying limestone. The island lies wholly within the equatorial region,\nand  receives  monsoon  rainfall  from  November  to  April,  averaging  2,500  millimeter  per  year.\n\n                                                       \n3  R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, 23 March. An arrangement for the\nTFET  and  an  expansion  of  eligibility  under  ADB's  procurement  and  engagement  of  consultant  guidelines  to\ninclude  member  countries,  East  Timor,  and  all  donor  and  member  of  international  organizations  that  have\nprovided contribution funds to the TFET.\nTA 3401-ETM: Transport Sector Restoration, for $1,000,000, approved on 10 February 2000.\n\n4\n\n\f5\n\nThe rest of the year is hot and dry. Vegetation is tropical savannah with medium  to  light  tree\ncover.  Coffee  is  grown  and  cattle  are  reared  in  parts  of  the  central  highlands.  The  southern\ncoastal plain is suited to rice and wheat production, but is not developed.\n\n15.\nThe  road  network  is  supported  by  the  main  coastal  east-west  arteries  along  the\nnorthern and southern coast lines. These are connected by the north-south secondary roads.\nThe  main  road  network  totals  1,400  km  and  about  6,600  km  of  rural  roads,  with  about  50\npercent of them sealed. All roads have suffered from long-term neglect of maintenance. The\nmain  centers  of  population,  including  the  capital,  Dili,  are  on  the  north  coast,  and  are\nconnected by the county\u2019s principal  roads.  The  condition of  the  southern  coastal  road  varies\ngreatly: some sections are paved and are in good condition,  while others are  little  more than\ntracks.  The  route  crosses  a  number  of  large  braided  rivers  by  a  combination  of  bridges  and\ncauseways. These causeways are vulnerable to the natural realignment of the waterways, and\ntwo  major  bridges,  Punta  Cassa  and  Zumala,  are  incomplete.  Five  national  and  provincial\nnorth-south roads, all showing severe signs of neglect, provide vehicular access to the  south\ncoast. During the dry season, the riverbeds are exposed and are inappropriate for inland river\ntravel. During the rainy season, rivers cut the roads and interrupt the transport system. The\nroad  drainage  needs  immediate  clearance  and  restoration.  In  all  towns,  the  road  drainage\nneeds  to  be  cleared  to  avoid  disruptive  flooding.  The  roads  have  narrow  carriageways  of\nabout  3  m,  steep  banks  with  poor  stability,  and  poor  pavement  surfaces  and  drainage.  An\ninventory of the road network and bridges is in Appendix 3.\n\n16.\nPresent  road  usage  is  dominated  by  Interfet,  the  UN  military,  and  by  aid  agencies'\nvehicles,  in  particular  by  those  of  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees\n(UNHCR) and WFP. This will continue in the foreseeable future. This usage exposes the roads\nto relatively heavy  loads,  which has exacerbated widespread pavement damage.  In addition,\ntracked  military  vehicles  have  damaged  road  surfaces  in  some  places.  Much  of  the  road\nnetwork  has  deteriorated  significantly  due  to  lack  of  maintenance  and  an  upsurge  in  traffic.\nDuring  the  rains  that  commenced  in  November  1999,  some  roads  became  impassable,  and\nothers dangerous and difficult to use. Humanitarian aid can also be delivered through coastal\nshipping  and  to  beaches,  and  by  air.  However,  these  modes  are  more  expensive  than  land\ntransport and the onward distribution relies on part of the road network.\n\n17.\nThe  road  network  is  fragile.  It  has  been  constructed  for  low  traffic  volumes  and  light\naxle  loadings.  It  traverses  steep  and  unstable  mountain  slopes,  experiences  intense  tropical\nrainfall, and crosses many wide rivers with ill-defined riverbeds. Under normal conditions, the\nnetwork would require a moderately high  level of maintenance.  Under  current  conditions, the\nroads are rapidly deteriorating. Interfet was able to maintain the road access it requires, but the\nexpedient nature of such works means that the improvements are frequently transitory and of\nlittle benefit to other users. Interfet has maintained key parts of the road network to give access\nto  civilian  vehicles\u2014particularly  on  sections  of  the  northern  east-west  road.  Since  January\n2000, Interfet has handed security operations to UNPKF. UNPKF will have a reduced capacity\nto maintain roads in future.\n\n18.\nAbout half of the road network is paved. This represents an extremely valuable national\nasset.  Given  the  foreseeable  economic  circumstances  for  the  country,  an  extensively  paved\nnational  road  network  could  be  an  irreplaceable  national  asset  that  could  be  irreparably\ndamaged if regular maintenance is not instituted as a matter of urgency. Road conditions are\ngiven in Appendix 4.\n\n\f6\n\nb.\n\nMedium- to Long-Term Sector Development\n\n19.\nA 12-month emergency works program for keeping the roads open has been outlined in\na UNDP-funded short-term study. The works were estimated to cost $15 million. The identified\nworks include repair of road bank slips, slides, and potholes, and embankment strengthening.\nUNDP  is  funding  labor-based  drainage  clearance  with  $0.5  million  from  the  Government  of\nNorway. The Government of United Kingdom will fund $1.6 million of these needs through its\nDepartment  for  International  Development.  Both  programs  are  highly  labor-intensive  and  will\nend in April 2000.\n\n20.\nADB-funded  TA  for  transport  restoration  (footnote  4)  will  prepare  a  comprehensive\ntransport  sector  plan.  This  will  focus  on  establishing  an  efficient  and  effective  multimodal\ntransport  system  to  support  long-term  development  and  growth  in  East  Timor.  The  plan  will\noutline  and  initiate  establishment  of  efficient  institutions  in  the  transport  subsectors.  In\ndeveloping these, the proposals and implementation mechanisms will pay particular  attention\nto private sector  involvement  and  to  the  infrastructure  requirements  of  the  poor.  Specifically,\nthe  TA  will  (i)  review  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  policy  frameworks;  (ii)  propose  and  establish\nimmediate  management  and  administrative  structures;  and  (iii)  outline  specifications  for\nimmediate and long-term restoration needs and development. The TA includes development of\nmanagement contracts for airports and ports to integrate efficient  sector operations, and cost\nrecovery development.  It  will also prepare  a  road  sector  management  system  integrating the\nstrengthening  and  training  activities  under  the  Project  with  long-term  sector  development\nneeds.\n\nc.\n\nSubsector Management\n\n21.\nThe  UNTAET\u2019s  current  sector  management  involves  four  people:  the  head  of\ninfrastructure,  a  roads  engineer,  a  port  manager,  and  an  aviation  official.  A  department  of\ntransport and works (DTW), with headquarters in Dili, is proposed to be established to manage\nthe transport system covering all subsectors. The  DTW would be  set up during the UNTAET\ntenure, for transport infrastructure management and to concurrently facilitate long-term sector\ndevelopment  and  capacity  building.  The  DTW's  structure  will  incorporate  the  principles  of\nprivate  sector  participation,  development  of  a  maintenance  culture,  human  resources\ndevelopment, and competition. An objective is to gradually develop East Timorese capacity to\nmanage,  and  improve  the  transport  infrastructure  assets  to  facilitate  economic  development\nand growth. The DTW\u2019s administrative structure will aim to institute a road asset management\nand  maintenance  system  that  establishes  local  capacity  to  manage  transport  needs  for\neconomic  development.  The  DTW  will  have  four  major  divisions:  (i)  a  transport  division  to\nassume  regulatory  and  policy  responsibilities  for  the  three  modal  subsectors,  (ii)  a  planning\nand design division, (iii) an operations division, and (iv) a finance division. Consultant support\nto the UNTAET will be provided under the ADB-funded TA for transport restoration, to initiate\nestablishment of the DTW. The project management unit will become the nucleus of the new\nadministration. A total of 115 staff members are required in the first year, including a maximum\nof 21 foreign staff. The number of foreign staff will be reduced gradually to 10 in the third year\nas  technology  transfer  is  incorporated  in  the  incentives  under  the  incumbents\u2019  contracts.  All\ninternational positions will be coupled with East Timorese counterparts. An organization chart\nof the planned DTW is in Appendix 5.\n\n\f7\n\n2. \n\nPorts\n\na.\n\nSubsector Description\n\n22.\nThe  maritime  infrastructure  includes  Dili  Port;  Carabela  Port  in  Laleia  with  a\nmechanical  roll-on  roll-off  facility;  Com  Port;  smaller  wharves  in  Oecusse  and  Liquica;  and\nslip  landing  structures  and  sites  in  Dili,  Batugade,  Oecusse,  and  Suai.  While  the  port\nstructures have not been  damaged by  the postconsultation destruction,  all equipment  were\ndestroyed.  Few  navigation  aids  exist,  and  these  are  now  in  operation.  There  are  no\nestablished cargo handling systems or cargo handling equipment, save an inoperable crane\non wheels. Shippers make their own arrangements with two Australian private sector cargo-\nhandlers,  who  bring  their  own  equipment.  At  all  the  ports,  all  vessels  need  to  be  self-\nsufficient with lifting gear. Other than at Dili Port and cargo landings at Suai, the wharves are\nused only to a very limited extent; some not at all. The use of port facilities outside of Dili is\nconstrained by narrow roads and poor road conditions.\n\n23.\nGiven  the  large  cargo  volumes  and  the  physical  constraints,  Dili  Port  is  under\npressure  and  highly  congested.  Commercial  vessels  have  experienced  long  turn-around\ntimes. This congestion hampers timely delivery of relief and security goods to East Timor. It\nalso increases the cost of humanitarian aid, and has led to acute shortage of food and other\nrelief material in the rural areas, where returning refugees are left with minimal support.\n\ni.\n\nOperations at Dili Port\n\n24.\nThe wharf at Dili Port is 180 m long and 20 m wide, has a draft of 7.2 m, and has the\ncapacity to handle 7,000 tons. Demand for port services and infrastructure has dramatically\nincreased since the consultation as a result of the humanitarian and  security activities.  The\nberths at Dili Port have a queue time ranging from 9 to 12 days. Ships are turned around in\n12-24  hours.  There  are  no  detailed  data  on  the  cargo  volumes  handled  by  the  port.\nCommercial  cargo  accounts  for  70  percent  of  the  current  total  volume,  and  includes\nhumanitarian  aid,  business  cargo,  and  used  vehicles.  Military  and  peacekeeping  cargo  is\ndominated  by  food  rations.  Under  a  letter  of  assistance,  Interfet  will  continue  to  handle\nUNPKF military cargo until the end of UNPKF\u2019s mandate in East Timor. The current volumes\nexceed  the  port\u2019s  capacity,  and  over  the  next  two  months,  the  cargo  volumes  will  further\nsurge temporarily as Interfet exports its equipment and hands over the security control to the\nUNPKF.\n\n25.\nTwo  Australian  cargo-handling  companies  operate  at  Dili  Port.  Additionally,  Interfet\nand aid agencies carry out their own stevedoring. A temporary barge has been attached  to\nthe  western  end  of  the  berth  to  alleviate  pressure  on  the  berth  space.  Interfet  resides\ncurrently  in  the  storage facilities  within  Dili  Port,  and  is  scheduled  to  vacate  these  facilities\ngradually  by  30  June  2000.  By  1  April  2000,  Interfet  and  UNTAET  will  determine  how  to\ncontinue the leases for equipment currently leased. The JAM recommends that the UNTAET\ncontinue leases for the 25 ton forklift truck and the temporary barge. The UNTAET could then\nsublease  the  forklift  truck  to  commercial  operators  on  a  cost  recovery  basis  until  cargo\nvolumes  have  stabilized.  The  barge  will  provide  additional  space  for  cargo  handling\noperations until the third berth is constructed.\n\n\f8\n\nii.\n\nSuai Beach Landing\n\nBecause the road network is in poor condition, relief goods are also being unloaded\n26.\nfrom barges in Suai. Interfet\u2019s unloading equipment was removed when Interfet departed on\n23 February. However, as humanitarian relief cargo will continue to be unloaded at Suai until\nthe  end of 2000, additional  cargo-handling equipment  is  needed  in  Suai  under  the  Project.\nThis equipment will be under the control of the UNPKF until the planned DTW can assume\nresponsibility for it.\n\nb.\n\nDemand for Port Services\n\n27. While meaningful trade data are  missing,  Dili's  importance  is clear.  Most  international\ntrade  enters  East  Timor  through  Dili  Port,  and  the  infrastructure  in  Dili  is  far  more  extensive\nthan at any of the other port sites. While beach landing sites are currently used for the delivery\nof military supplies and reconstruction materials, the future demand for port facilities outside of\nDili, Oecusse, and Com is in considerable doubt, and the port revenues are likely to be limited\nto Dili Port. Past trade data demonstrates that most exports are agricultural (coffee) and most\nimports  are  food  and  construction  materials.  The  number  of  trading  ships  visiting  Dili  Port\nduring  the  preconsultation  period  ranged  from  170  to  270  vessels  per  year.  The  current\nshortages of commodities, especially rice, suggest considerable volatility in these volumes. No\nformal statistics have been kept on vessel movements through Dili Port since the consultation.\nPast  cargo data and a  reasonably  comprehensive  list  of  the  current  main  movements  at  the\nPort are summarized in Appendix 6.\n\ni.\n\nUNTAET Cargo\n\n28. While the UNTAET has not estimated its future cargo volumes, logistics support of the\nUNTAET\u2019s operations will dominate total cargo over the next 2-3 years. Although in the short\nrun  the  replacement of  Interfet  with  the  UNPKF will  cause a surge  in  exported  and  imported\ncargoes, this is unlikely to affect the volumes on a sustained basis. Force reductions are likely\nto occur in June 2000, with similar reductions taking place every 4-6 months thereafter.\n\nii.\n\nFood and Medical Cargoes\n\nThe total shipments of food aid during March-June 2000 are estimated to rise to 50,000\n29.\ntons,  but  thereafter  will  likely  settle  to  30,000-40,000  tons  per  annum.  Medical  aid  cargoes\ncurrently fill 5-10 containers per  week, and  are  likely  to  continue  for  the  next  2-3  years,  and\npossibly longer.\n\niii.\n\nConstruction Materials\n\n30.\nUNHCR anticipates shipping approximately 500 housing units every two weeks through\nDili  Port  over  the  next  three  months,  and  an  additional  1,000  units  through  other  ports  and\nbeaches, each unit with a mass of about 1.5 tons. The International Red Cross will ship 5,500\nhousing  units  (excluding  cement)  over  the  next  12  months,  while  World  Vision  will  import\n10,000 packs of roof sheltering and timber in the second quarter of this year. Other NGOs have\nsmaller  housing  programs  that  will  also  generate  import  volumes.  The  United  Nations\nChildren's Fund (UNICEF) has building and water programs that generate modest amounts of\n\n\f9\n\nconstruction  cargoes,  including  about  5  containers  per  month,  plus  100-150  cubic  meters  of\nloose construction materials.\n\niv.\n\nCommercial Cargoes\n\n31. While  it  is  extremely  difficult  to  estimate  commercial  imports,  the  large  demand  for\nconstruction  materials needs to be  recognized. Apart from the large influx  of vehicles  for  the\nUNTAET, demand for imported motor vehicles, mostly second hand, has recently surged and\nis estimated at 100-200 vehicles per month, with the likelihood of significant future growth.\n\nc.\n\nLong-Term Subsector Development\n\n32.\nADB-funded  TA  (footnote  4)  will  (i)  prepare  port  traffic  forecasts;  (ii)  undertake  long-\nterm port subsector planning, including development of a port and maritime  master plan and\npreparation  of  related  feasibility  documentation;  (iii)  prepare  an  operational  management\ncontract  for  port  subsector  operations;  (iv)  recommend  modalities  for  service  provision\ncontracts; (v) prepare applications for joining international subsector organizations; (vi) identify\npotential  partnership  arrangements;  (vii)  recommend  efficient  cargo  handling  services  at  the\nports;  (viii)  review  needs  related  to  hydrographic  charting,  navigational  aids,  search  and\nrescue, emergency oil spill  response, and other  maritime  safety  operations;  and  (ix)  develop\nrecommendations for establishment of a maritime authority.\n\nd.\n\nPort Management and Cost Recovery\n\n33.\nInterfet  manages  the  port  sector.  It  will  implement  minor  civil  works  to  facilitate  its\noperations.  These  include  demolishing  sheds  on  the  western  end  of  the  wharf  to  provide\naccess  to  a  newly  developed  private  gravel-surfaced  container  yard.  Interfet\u2019s  tenure  in  the\nmanagement of the subsector expired on 28 February. Between now and June 2000, Interfet\nwill gradually move out of the port facilities. The UNTAET has appointed a Portuguese-funded\nharbor master who will manage the port in the interim together with the UNTAET port manager\nuntil  a  management  contract  is  in  place.  ADB-funded  TA  (footnote  4)  will  prepare  a\nmanagement  contract  to  facilitate  East  Timorese  management  of  the  subsector  and  to\nestablish  a  port  authority.  This  management  contract  will  be  tendered  in  April  2000.  The\ntendered management contract will be financed from UNTAET\u2019s trust fund and port charges.\n\nADB  is  conducting  a  port  pricing  study  that  will  prepare  a  detailed  analysis  of  the\n34.\nmarginal costs of the port sector and develop a port tariff for immediate  implementation.  The\nrecommendations  of  the  study  will  be  available  in  late  March  2000.  In  the  interim,  the  port\nmanager has developed a set of provisional tariffs based on comparisons  with other regional\nports, and a provisional staffing structure for the port. The implications of these for the level of\ncost  recovery  in  the  port  will  be  examined  and  administrative  collection  mechanisms  will  be\ndeveloped  in  detail  under  ADB\u2019s  intervention.  The  practicalities  of  implementation  have  also\nbeen  discussed  in  some  detail.  The  principles  governing  the  recommendations  are  to  (i)\nminimize the risk  of facilitation  payments  and  illegal  transfer  of  funds,  and  (ii)  avoid  revenue\ncollection hindering vessel and cargo movements.\n\n\f10\n\n3.\n\nEnergy\n\na.\n\nSubsector Description\n\n35.\nEast Timor has 57 electricity  generating  stations.  All electricity  generation has  been\nproduced  by  diesel  engines  operating  on  light  diesel  fuel.  The  installed  capacity  in  the\nstations  ranged  (prior  to  the  postconsultation  destruction)  from  25  kilowatts  (kW)  to\napproximately 16,000 kW. Most of the total generation capacity, approximately 24 megawatts\n(MW), is provided by the two power stations serving Dili. The distribution system consists of\napproximately 700 km of 20 kilovolt lines for transmission, and about 700 km of 230/400 volt\ndistribution lines. The peak demand prior to August 1999 was about 32 MW. The load factor\nfor most generating stations was very low (about 10-20 percent). The system facilities have\nbeen correctly installed, but the maintenance of the stations and network has been of a low\nstandard.\n\n36.\nThe  power  system  was  heavily  damaged  during  the  post  consultation  destruction.\nMost generating station  equipment and  powerhouse  structures  were  damaged  and  most  of\nthe  control  panels,  fuel  systems,  and  wiring  were  destroyed  by  fire.  Many  auxiliary  items,\nsuch  as  batteries  and  starter  motors,  were  removed.  Of  the  57  stations,  21  have  been\nreturned  to  operation  under  bilateral  assistance  from  the  Government  of  United  Kingdom.\nSmaller  single-  unit  stations  are  now  able  to  produce  a  high  percentage  of  their  installed\ncapacity, while other larger multiple unit stations are reduced to a single-unit operation. The\nComoro station in Dili, serving most of the Dili area load, has been returned to a capacity of\n7-8 MW operation. Although this station was not damaged, poor maintenance has severely\nreduced its reliability and operation. Many regional centers remain without power or receive\nsignificantly reduced supply. Oecusse Enclave of East Timor has had no central generation\nsince the popular consultation.\n\n37.\nThe  distribution  network  suffered  considerable  damage  to  the  low-voltage  system\nwhen homes and buildings adjacent to the overhead lines were burned. Lack of maintenance\nhas  reduced  the  network's  reliability  significantly.  Most  service  connections  have  been\nburned  and  many  are  now  hanging  free  from  the  distribution  lines,  presenting  a  danger  to\npeople and preventing the restoration effort. Many of the system transformers were drained\nof insulating fluid. These cannot be returned to service until they are refilled.\n\nb.\n\nSubsector Management\n\n38.\nThe  power  subsector  suffers  from  acute  shortage  of  trained  personnel  at  all  levels\nand  poses  a  severe  difficulty  to  restoring  the  proper  operation  of  the  electrical  system.  In\nparticular, there is a  lack  of  experienced operators  at  all power  stations,  including  linemen,\ndiesel mechanics, and technicians. A shell for an operating utility company has been formed\nin Dili, but does not have experienced management personnel.\n\n39.\nUnder  a  contract  with  UNDP  funded  from  the  TFET,  Electricity  of  Portugal  will\ndevelop  the  power  sector  institution  and  provide  the  related  managerial  and  technical\ntraining.  Under  the Project,  support  will  be  provided  to  develop  financial  management,  i.e.,\nbilling  and  collection  systems,  financial  accounts  and  recording,  audit,  financial  planning,\nbudgeting, and bookkeeping of the power subsector institution.\n\n\f11\n\nIn  light  of  ADB\u2019s  lead  agency  role  in  the  sector,  support  for  preparing  a  long-term\n40.\ndevelopment  plan  is  proposed  for  funding  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  program.  This  would  cover\ngeneration expansion, transmission and distribution augmentation, and related action over a\n20-year  time  frame.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  study  will  be  sent  for  the  UNTAET\nendorsement.\n\nD.\n\nExternal Assistance and Donor Coordination\n\n41.\nThe  Project  is  fully  coordinated  with  donors  involved  in  the  overall  emergency\nrestoration  support  for  East  Timor  and  in  particular  with  the  donors  and  partners  who  are\nassisting  emergency  programs  in  the  three  sectors  under  the  Project.  These  include  UNDP\nand the Department for International Development, which implement bilateral labor-based road\nrepair  work.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  is  currently  implementing  a\nstudy on urgent  rehabilitation  in  East Timor under an agreement with the UNTAET  dated  12\nJanuary 2000. The estimated cost of the study is $2.5  million and includes a pilot project for\nroad repair on the Dili-Aileu section. An inception report was prepared in late February and the\nfinal report will be completed in August 2000. The objective of the study is to urgently prepare\nrehabilitation plan for roads, bridges, ports, irrigation, and power in East Timor. The Project is\nprepared  so  that  it  can  be  adjusted  to  accommodate  works  under  additional  funding  from\nJapan or other donors, and complementary assistance from JICA would address irrigation and\nbridge rehabilitation.\n\n42.\nElectricity of Portugal will implement $1.0 million of TFET funds in the power subsector.\nThis support will focus on developing a power entity, training staff resources, and rehabilitating\n1-2 power stations. The Project will continue the works that have been initiated by programs of\nother donors and are yet to be completed. Appendix 7 lists ongoing projects.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nB.\n\nObjectives\n\n43.\nUNTAET  is  implementing  a  program of humanitarian  assistance  in  East  Timor.  The\nprimary objective of rehabilitating the transport and power infrastructure is to provide the East\nTimorese with access to this humanitarian relief and to facilitate peace and security.\n\n44.\nThe  Project  will  (i)  undertake  emergency  road  repair  works  to  facilitate  efficient\ntransport of humanitarian aid and security cargo, and to induce revival of economic activity;\n(ii) expand the capacity of port facilities  to  reduce  congestion as  soon as possible;  and  (iii)\nreinstate  power  supply.  Despite  the  apparent  emergency  nature  of  the  Project,  in  fact  the\nProject  also  supports  long-term  sector  development  with  civil  works,  strengthening  of  the\nlocal  contracting  industry,  instituting  operation  and  maintenance  systems,  and  capacity\nbuilding for sector management.\n\nC.\n\nScope\n\n45.\n\nThe scope of the Project includes the following components:\n\n\f12\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)\n\nroad  rehabilitation,  including  (a)  road  repair,  (b)  equipment  for  road  repair\nworks,  (c)  labor-based  road  and  causeway  restoration,  and  (d)  rehabilitation\nand reinstatement of bridges and depot facilities;\n\nport  rehabilitation,  including  (a)  wharf  extension  at  Dili  Port;  (b)  restoration  of\nthe landing craft slipway at Dili Port; (c) restoration of the container yard at Dili\nPort; (d) provision of beach matting at Beacu, Betano, and Suai; (e) port repairs;\nand (f) equipment for landing of goods;\n\npower sector rehabilitation, including (a) rehabilitation of 15 power stations, (b)\nrehabilitation  and  reinstatement  of  distribution \nlines,  (c)  restoration  of\ncommunications between Dili and power stations, (d) replacement of destroyed\nComoro  power  station  switchgear,  and  (e)  support  to  financial  sector\nmanagement; and\n\n(iv) \n\na project management unit.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $29.8 million. The estimated costs of the\n\n46.\ncomponents are summarized in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 8.\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($ million)\n15 May-\n31 Jul\n\n1 Aug-\n31 Dec\n\n1 Jan 2001-\n15 Dec 2002\n\nDescription\n\nBase Costs\n\n1.

The  Project  financing  needs  to  be\nsensitive to the  TFET's  cash  receipts. This  has  been  taken  into  account  in  the  packaging  of\ncontracts.\n\n48.\nAs reported to the Board on 23 March 2000, the provision of funds to TFET by donors\nhas so far been rather slow. At the present time, there are insufficient funds in TFET to finance\n\n\f13\n\nthe entire Project, although it is anticipated that substantial contributions to TFET will be made\nover the next few months and that funds will become available for the Project in good time for\nimplementation. The Trustee has also confirmed in writing that $7 million is available now. The\nnegotiated  Grant  Agreement  therefore  refers  to  this  initial  amount  of  $7  million  but  also\nanticipates  that  the  Trustee  will  confirm  from  time  to  time  that  further  amounts  may  be\nwithdrawn  as  they  become  available.  The  Grant  Agreement  provides  that,  as  and  when  the\nTrustee  confirms  such    availability  of  further  amounts,  ADB  and  UNTAET  will  enter  into\nsupplementary exchanges of letters to record the new amounts. Therefore, although the total\nproject cost is $29.8 million, the initial amount of $7 million to be provided from TFET may not\nbe exceeded without a subsequent written confirmation from the Trustee and a supplementary\nexchange of letters between ADB and UNTAET.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n49.\nThe UNTAET will be the recipient of the Grant. It will establish a project management\nunit  (PMU)  that  reports  to  the  UNTAET  head  of  infrastructure.  The  PMU  will  program,\nadminister, and coordinate daily project  activities,  and  will  assume  the  role of an  executing\nagency.  The  PMU  will  be  headed  by  an  East  Timorese  project  manager  and  comprise  an\nEast Timorese project accountant and three subsector engineers. The selection of these will\nbe  subject  to  ADB's  approval.  The  project  manager  will  be  supported  by  internationally\nrecruited  consultants:  a chief  technical  adviser  and  a  financial  manager,  and  engineers  for\nroads,  ports,  and  electricity,  totaling  120  person-months.  The  chief  technical  adviser  will\nsupport the project manager in administering the Project and its contracts in accordance with\nADB  guidelines,  and  will  be  accountable  to  ADB  for  the  quality  and  timeliness  of  project\nimplementation.  Engineers  will  program  and  coordinate  daily  project  activities,  including\ndesign,  supervision,  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  and  management  of  civil  works\ncontracts. Once established, the DTW will absorb the PMU. The international consultants will\ntrain East Timorese counterparts in their areas of responsibility. The consultant services will\nbe selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  However,  the\nterm \"member countries\" under these guidelines for purposes of this Project will include ADB\nmember  countries,  East  Timor,  and  all  donors  and  members  of  international  organizations\nthat  have  provided  contribution  funds  to  the  TFET.  The  PMU  will  be  funded  under  the\nProject. An organization chart and terms of reference of the PMU are in Appendix 9. Under\nthe UNTAET's organization framework, the PMU will become the nucleus of the DTW and be\nabsorbed  within  it.  Both  the  PMU  and  DTW  will  report  to  the  head  of  infrastructure  as  its\nUNTAET ministerial equivalent.\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nTechnical Approach\n\na.\n\nEmergency Road Repair\n\nThe  works  under  the  Project  will  incorporate  labor-intensive  employment  generating\n50.\nmethodologies,  where  possible.  The  equipment  under  the  Project  will  be  held  at  five  depots\nand  be  hired  to  East  Timorese  subcontractors  to  build  their  capacity  to  do  urgently  needed\nroad  repairs.  Least-cost  methodologies  have  been  adopted  for  the  technical  solutions  under\nthe Project. These include maximum use of local labor, materials, and contractors, and simple\ntechnologies contributing to sustainability of these works.\n\n\f14\n\n51.\nFive short-term contracts for road repair will be tendered to engage local people in road\nworks  on  an  urgent  basis.  Concurrently,  five  longer-term  international  contractors  will  be\nselected, one to be based in each regional center: Baucau, Dili, Maliana, Oecusse, and Same.\nEach  contractor  will  (i)  reinstate  priority  lengths  of  unstable,  collapsed,  subsided,  or  eroded\nroad;  (ii)  restore  functional  drainage  to  priority  road  lengths;  (iii)  repair  local  areas  of  heavily\ndamaged  road  pavement;  (iv)  provide  appropriate  river  crossings  where  essential  to  the\nhumanitarian  effort;  (v)  refurbish  regional  DTW  depots,  as  required;  (vi)  develop  local  road\nrepair capacity by mentoring the selected local subcontractors; and (vii) involve communities in\nthe unskilled road repair activities.\n\nThe Project is designed to ensure maximum coordination with ongoing road works and\n52.\nto facilitate a coordinated approach to any further works funded by resources additional to the\nTFET. This is possible as each of the five contracts will be responsible for restoring roads in a\nregion, with works focused on prioritized roads. The contractor will switch to other priority road\nsections, when additional support is mobilized.\n\nb.\n\nEmergency Port Restoration\n\nDili  Port  suffers  from  a  high  level  of  congestion.  To  facilitate  the  delivery  of  the\n53.\nhumanitarian aid and security cargo, Dili Port requires, on an urgent basis, additional wharf\nand cargo handling capacity, and improved management.\n\nConstruction of a 48.7 m by 12.1 m extension has been incomplete since 1997 with\n54.\nonly the concrete deck and ancillary work needed.  The  structure  comprises  steel piles  with\nreinforced steel, and longitudinal and transverse reinforced concrete beams. Completing the\nextension will avoid a loss of the earlier investment. A landing site at Dili Port serves barge-\nlanding  of  goods,  and  is  particularly  useful  for  landing  military  and  humanitarian  aid.  The\nconcrete  landing  ramp  has  deteriorated  to  a  very  poor  state,  with  uneven  surface,  deep\ncavitation, and cracking, and is of limited use. Restoration of the slipway will allow additional\nlanding capacity at all tides at the port. The container storage area at the port is a soft area\n225  m  long  and  40  m  wide.  Hardening  of  the  area  will  improve  container  management  by\nproviding additional maneuvering space, and will alleviate space constraints at the Port. The\nselected engineering solutions represent least-cost actions using local materials to the extent\npossible and local contractors under supervision of a mentoring contractor.\n\nc.\n\nEmergency Power Rehabilitation\n\n55.\nThirty-six generating stations in the rural areas need immediate  rehabilitation,  ranging\nfrom repair of burn damage to total reconstruction. A detailed specification of requirements and\ndesign  work  at  each  station  will  be  carried  out  as  a  component  of  the  Project.  Least-cost\nmethodologies  will  be  adopted.  The  specifications  will  include  portable  generating  sets  to\nenable  rehabilitation.  After  restoring  the  original  generating  units,  the  portable  sets  will  be\nmoved to other sites and the process repeated.\n\n56.\nAt present there is no communication between the power utility headquarters in Dili and\nthe rest of the system. The Project will install a system of radios and repeater stations to allow\nfor communication from the Dili utility to the outlying stations and vehicles.\n\n\f15\n\nThe  power  sector  also  lacks  basic  tools  and  equipment  for  rehabilitation  of  the\n57.\ndistribution system and restoration of the services. No instruments are available to measure\nvoltage or current in the circuits. While most of the network overhead conductors are sound,\nsome  spans  need  replacement.  Service  connections  have  also  been  damaged.  Many  of\nthese  need  replacement  as  customers  are  reconnected  to  the  system.  The  Project  will\ninclude  providing  multimeters  and  other  basic  equipment,  and  overhead  and  service\nconductors; rehabilitating distribution circuits; and providing related training.\n\n58.\nThe  Project  will  support  development  of  financial  management  capabilities  in  the\nfuture power entity, to ensure that the people involved understand the need for cost recovery.\nCurrently,  power  supply  is  mismanaged  because  it  is  supplied  free  to  only  a  very  few\nconsumers.\n\n2.\n\nSteering Committee\n\nThe UNTAET  will  establish,  with the  support of the  TA 3401  (footnote 4), a  steering\n59.\ncommittee  for  the  Project  to  involve  broader  stakeholder  representation  in  project\nimplementation. The steering committee will be convened prior to the approval of the Project\nto  inform  the  stakeholders  of  the  project  activities.  The  steering  committee  will  then  meet\nmonthly to discuss and resolve emerging issues in project implementation, procurement, and\ncommunity employment, and to review and comment on the project reports for submission to\nADB.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\n60.\nAll  procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement used for loan financed projects (footnote 3). The proceeds of the\nProject will finance imports of goods and services, local purchases, and civil works identified\nunder the Project. Under ADB's Guidelines for Procurement, these may be procured through\ndirect purchase, or through international shopping, local competitive bidding, or international\ncompetitive  bidding,  as  appropriate.  Five  short-term  civil  works  contracts  will  be  tendered\nusing  international  shopping  procedures  to  ensure  expedited  restoration  of  infrastructure.\nThese will engage local labor. Thereafter, five long-term civil works contracts will be tendered\nusing international competitive bidding procedures.\n\n4.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n61.\nThe  project  implementation  period  is  24  months,  commencing  in  May  2000.  Every\nquarter,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a  detailed  implementation  schedule  for  project  activities.\nProject implementation consultants will be selected as soon as the Project is approved and\nthe  grant  effective.  Small \nlabor-intensive  works  contracts,  preparation  of  designs,\nprequalification  of  contractors,  and  tendering  of  international  competitive  bidding  contracts\nwill commence upon project approval and grant effectiveness. Port rehabilitation, road works,\nand  rehabilitation  of  power  stations  will  start  from  June  2000.  The  Project  activities  will  be\ncompleted by December 2001. A technical review of the Project will be conducted jointly by\nADB and the UNTAET one year after project approval. The Project implementation schedule\nis shown in Appendix 10.\n\n\f16\n\n5.\n\nRights-of-Way\n\nMost  works  under  the  Project  are  within  existing  rights-of-way.  The  UNTAET  will,  if\n62.\nneeded,  acquire  or obtain  rights  to  any  land  required  on  a  timely  basis  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Policy on Resettlement and Compensation  and  provide  compensation  (including  for\ncrops),  as  required,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  relevant  guidelines.  Detailed  designs  will\nminimize land acquisition.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\nAs agreed with IDA, disbursements for eligible expenditures will be made pursuant to\n63.\nADB\u2019s Disbursement Guidelines set out in  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, 1996 and\nmay  be  made  as  direct  payment  or  reimbursement,  or  through  an  imprest  account.  The\nimprest account  will  be  replenished  in  accordance  with  ADB's Guidelines on Imprest Fund\nand Statement of Expenditures Procedures.  The  chief  technical adviser  will  be  responsible\nfor  transactions,  replenishments,  and  use  of  the  imprest  account.  Payments  under  these\nagreements will be made by IDA based on ADB\u2019s request.\n\na.\n\nDirect Payment\n\n64.\nUnder the direct purchase procedure, the PMU will request ADB for a direct payment\nto be made to the supplier of goods and services. ADB will authorize the request and send it\nto IDA, which will pay the supplier directly. Payment will be requested using ADB\u2019s standard\nwithdrawal application. The PMU will indicate in the withdrawal application the date on which\npayment  becomes  due  to  the  supplier. A  separate  application  should be filled  out  for  each\ncurrency  in  which  the  payment  is  requested.  The  application  should  be  submitted  with\nsupporting  documents  such  as  contracts,  invoices,  receipts,  and  vouchers.  This  procedure\nwill be used for payment of (i) consultants' fees, (ii) equipment, and (iii) civil works contracts\nawarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Copies of signed contracts will be\nforwarded to ADB as early as possible to facilitate timely payments.\n\nb.\n\nReimbursement Procedures\n\n65.\nThe reimbursement procedure will be used when eligible expenditures are paid from\nthe UNTAET\u2019s budget and reimbursement claimed through ADB from the TFET. Withdrawal\napplications  with  supporting  documents  and  summary  sheets  of  expenditures  will  be\nprepared by the PMU, and payments will be made to the UNTAET by IDA based on ADB's\nauthorization. The reimbursement procedure will be used for payment of (i) small purchases,\nand (ii) short-term civil works contracts.\n\nc.\n\nImprest Fund\n\nUnder the imprest account fund procedure, ADB will request IDA to advance funds to\n66.\nthe  PMU  to  meet  subproject  expenditures  to  prefinance  payments  to  contractors  and\nsuppliers. The imprest account will be used for short-term civil works, small-scale design and\nsupervision  services,  remuneration  of  East  Timorese  project  staff,  and  small  purchases\nunder all cost categories eligible for financing. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedure will\nbe used for reimbursement of expenditures and for the liquidation of the imprest account for\npayments with value equal to or  below $50,000  each.  The  currency  of  the  imprest  account\n\n\f17\n\nwill be the United States dollar and the maximum initial advance will be $500,000. The chief\ntechnical adviser supported by the PMU will be responsible for administrative and accounting\ntasks under the Project and will establish adequate internal control, accounting, and auditing\nprocedures  to  ensure  efficient  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  its  operation.  The  imprest\naccount will be established in Darwin, Australia.\n\n7.\n\nReporting\n\n67.\nThe  UNTAET  with  the  support  of  the  PMU  will  furnish  ADB  with  quarterly  progress\nreports concerning all aspects, including finances, procurement of services, equipment, and\nall  civil  works  in  the Project.  The  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  expenditure  budgets  a  month\nprior  to  the  commencement of  the following  quarter.  The  UNTAET,  with  the  support  of  the\nPMU, will also provide quarterly reports on the use of the recurrent UNTAET road, port, and\npower  budget,  including  activities  and  expenditures;  and  report  progress  in  implementing\npolicy initiatives, transport policy and regulations, and organizational changes. The PMU will\nalso prepare a final project completion report on all aspects of the Project in accordance with\nADB's relevant guidelines.\n\n8.\n\nAccounts\n\n68.\nThe  PMU  will  establish  the  necessary  accounts  in  Dili,  if  possible,  and  in  Darwin,\nAustralia,  if  required.  These  bank  accounts  will  be  under  the  control  of  the  chief  technical\nadviser. The PMU will establish and maintain separate accounts for all expenditures under the\nProject, including its individual contracts and other  project components. The PMU will furnish\nADB  with accounts and  related  financial  statements  reflecting  the  accounts  for  each  project-\nrelated  contract.  These  financial  statements  will  be  audited  using  generally  accepted\naccounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited financial statements together\nwith the auditor\u2019s report will be forwarded to ADB within six months of the end of each related\nfiscal year. The PMU consultants will keep detailed records on the costing and expenditures of\nthe project components and will assist with reporting.\n\n9.\n\nTechnical Midterm Review\n\n69.\nIn addition to a schedule of regular reviews to monitor the progress of the Project, a\ntechnical review of the Project will be carried out one year after mobilization. The focus of the\nreview is to determine the need for any deviations from the project design or implementation.\nThe  review  will  also  assess  adequacy  of  funds,  cost  overruns,  need  for  reallocations,  and\nother  factors,  if  any,  including  assumptions  and  risks,  that  might  constrain  the  satisfactory\nimplementation of the Project and achievement of development objectives.\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impact of the Project\n\n70.\nThe Project has been  classified as environmental  category B. Accordingly, an  initial\nenvironmental  examination  is  in  Appendix  11.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the\nProject are related to construction activities, and are limited, temporary, and reversible. The\nmedium- and  long-term  impact  of  the  Project  is  positive,  especially  in  promoting  economic\nand social development of East Timor and facilitating its reconstruction and development. A\ndetailed environmental impact assessment is not needed.\n\n\f18\n\n71.\nUnder  the  UNTAET\u2019s  transitional  administration,  Indonesian  environmental  laws\nremain  valid.  The  capacity  to  review  and  evaluate  environmental  impacts  of  infrastructure\nprojects  and  to  monitor  implementation  of  the  mitigating  measures  needs  to  be  developed\nwithin  the  UNTAET.  There  is  also  a  need  to  review  the  applicability  of  the  prevailing\nenvironmental  management  laws,  regulations,  and  standards  to  the  East  Timorese  social,\nlegal,  and  institutional  context.  In  the  light  of  ADB\u2019s  lead  agency  role  in  infrastructure\nrestoration,  ADB  will  assist  in development of  institutional  and  human  resource  capacity  to\naddress  environmental  and  natural  resources  management  in  infrastructure  projects.  The\nProject  will  be  used  to  train  PMU  counterparts  to  become  familiar  with  environmental\nmitigation activities during construction.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Assessment\n\n72.\nThe  Project  will  restore  the  transport  and  power  sector  assets  and  supply.  This  is\nexpected  to  have  a  significant  positive  social  impact.  An  initial  social  assessment  is  in\nAppendix  12. The  Project  will  not  involve  any  relocation  or  resettlement.  The  beneficiary\nconsultations confirm widespread support for the Project. The Project will improve the quality of\nlife.  All  people  will  benefit  from  the  more  reliable  flow  of  goods,  fuel,  health  care  services,\nfood,  and  access  to  reviving  markets.  The  Project  will  generate  significant  employment\namong  the  people,  most  of  whom  are  returning  refugees  who  have  lost  their  property  and\nlivelihoods. Civil works under the Project are designed to maximize the use of labor.\n\nIn the  next 10  months, the  road and  port  rehabilitation  will  facilitate  the  movement  of\n73.\nfood  and  agricultural  supply  to  poverty-stricken  and  starvation-threatened  areas.  And  since\npower  is  used  in  a  number  of  labor-intensive  industries  and  services,  particularly  in  Dili  and\nother  urban  centers,  its  restoration  will  facilitate  basic  services  such  as  water  and  hospital\nfacilities returning to normal.\n\nV.\n\nAPPROVAL\n\nThe  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the\n74.\nprovision  and  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  to  the  United  Nations  Transitional\nAdministration  in  East  Timor,  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  $29,800,000  and  subject  to  the\nprocedures described in paragraph 48, to be financed by the Trust Fund for East Timor on  a\ngrant basis, for the Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  Project, and hereby  reports  such\naction to the Board.\n\n13 April 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPRESIDENT\n\n\f19\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNo.\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nProject Framework\n\nUNTAET Organization Chart\n\nRoad Lengths, Pavement Types and Standards, and\nRoad Conditions, 1999\n\nPresent Road Conditions\n\nProposed Structure of the Planned Department of\nTransport and Works\n\nCargo Volumes in 1990 and Current Main Movements\nin Dili Port\n\nOngoing Assistance to Roads, Ports, and Power\nSectors\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates\n\nOutline  Terms  of  Reference  for  Support  to  the  East\nTimor Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation\n\nProject Implementation Schedule\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\nInitial Social Assessment\n\n20\n\n23\n\n24\n\n26\n\n30\n\n33\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n50\n\n51\n\n55\n\n1, 1\n\n2, 4\n\n5, 15\n\n5, 18\n\n6, 21\n\n8, 27\n\n11, 42\n\n12, 46\n\n13, 49\n\n15, 61\n\n17, 70\n\n17, 72\n\n\fDesign Summary\n\nSector Goal\nEnable transport and\npower infrastructure to\nallow access to\nhumanitarian\nassistance, health care,\nand water supply.\n\n20\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nTargets\n\nProject Monitoring\nMechanism\n\nRisk/Assumptions\n\n1.

These were augmented with interviews with\nkey road users in Ambino enclave.\n\nTable A4.4: Visual Road Condition Assessment\n\nSample Route\n1\n\nDili-Aileu-Maubisse-Same-Ainaro-Zumalai\n\nName\nNorth-south route 2: Combination\nof provincial and district roads\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nZumalai-Suai-Zumalai\n\nSouth coast road\n\nZumalai-Maliana-Balibo\n\nNorth-south route 1: district road\n\nBalibo-Atabae-Maubara-Dili\n\nNorth coast road\n\nOecusse-Citrana-Oecusse\n\nAmbino enclave coastal road (W)\n\nCitrana-Tumin-Pune\n\nAmbino district roads\n\nCitrana-Baqui-Nenopen\n\nAmbino district roads\n\nCitrana-Passabe\n\nAmbino district roads\n\n5.\nDrainage-based defects were noted on the north-south (route 1) at about 1 km intervals,\nand this represented the highest observed level of distress. The south coast road (Route 2) was\nmostly paved and in good condition, except for major river crossings. The bridge over the Cassa\nRiver is a large steel truss with a reinforced in-situ concrete deck over steel beams. The truss\nfor the center span has not been assembled, although the major components are presumably all\non  site.  The  deck  for  another  span  was  under  construction  when  work  stopped.  At  present,\nvehicles ford the river, but this is a difficult and potentially dangerous, and only made possible\nby the assistance of local people who indicate the shallowest route.\n\nA  second  river  crossing  on  the  south  coast  road,  over  the  Mota  River  (Zumalai),  was\n6.\nalso temporarily impassable due  to  scour at the  back of an  abutment.  The  problem has  since\nbeen  fixed  temporarily,  but  illustrates  the  risk  of  using  causeways  to  reduce  the  length  of\nbridging wide braided rivers. Such a strategy is only sustainable in conjunction with dry season\nriverbed management to reposition sand banks and boulder reefs. This is necessary every year\nand is best regarded as a routine maintenance activity.\n\nThe Oecusse Coastal Road West (Route 5), ends after about 7 km at a wide river ford.\n7.\nThe  road  pavement  is  constructed  from  a  naturally  occurring  mix  of  bitumen  and  crushed\nlimestone known locally as Ashburton. This material was specified exclusively for district roads\nand  was  the  lightest  form  of  pavement  constructed  during  the  Indonesian  administration.  It  is\nunsuited  to  the  heavy  traffic  generated  by  military  and  aid  vehicles.  As  a  result,  although  the\nroad  is  on  the  flat  coastal  plain  and  has  therefore  suffered  little  or  no  damage  to  the  road\nformation, the pavement is failing and the surface heavily potholed.\n\n\f29\n\nAppendix 4, page 4\n\n8.\nAt  present,  aid  agencies  are  unable  to  access  the  interior  of  Ambino  due  to  the\nextremely poor condition of the district and feeder road networks, and all support is provided by\nair. The military has had to declare the worst of the roads as one-way, due to the loss of road\nwidth.\n\n9.\n\nOther issues relevant to the strategy for the Ambino interior road network are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAbout 40,000 East Timorese need support because their subsistence agriculture\nwas disrupted and of the rural administration collapsed.\n\nThe road network has probably always been in relatively poor condition, but the\ncessation of regular maintenance has dramatically worsened the situation.\n\nMuch  of the  work needed  on  this  network  will  involve  reconstruction.  However,\nmaintenance  is  still  necessary  to  preserve  even  limited  road  access  to  the\naffected  areas,  pending  a  formal  engineering  evaluation  to  determine  the\noptimum reinstatement strategy.\n\nAccess  to  the  interior  of  Ambino  is  limited  during  the  rainy  season  by  four\nimpassable river crossings. Two of these crossings have wide, braided beds with\nunstable  meandering  watercourses  that  make  them  unsuitable  for  low  or  even\nmedium cost bridging, and pipe causeways are proposed. The riverbeds contain\nall  required  aggregates,  and  the  method  of  construction  will  be  labor-intensive,\naffording much needed employment to the area around Oecusse.

The roads will need to be reclassified, and the DTW structure\nwill manage all the roads, given the small size of the network. The proposed administrative\nstructure aims to ensure development of a road management and maintenance system that\nestablishes  local  capacity  to  manage,  and  improve  the  road  assets  to  facilitate  transport\nand economic development and  growth.  The  principles  guiding  establishment  of  the  DTW\nwill  include  (i)  establishment  of  a  private  sector  contracting  industry,  (ii)  development  of  a\nroad  maintenance  culture  in  the  DTW  and  the  communities,  (iii)  use  of  local  human\nresources, and (iv) encouragement of competition. The DTW is to be headquartered in Dili\nand  to  have  four  major  divisions:  (i)  a  transport  division,  to  assume  regulatory  and  policy\nresponsibilities for roads; (ii) a planning and design division; (iii) an operations division, and\n(iv) a finance division. Consultant support to the United Nations Transitional Administration\nin East  Timor  (UNTAET)  is  proposed  in  detail  to  initiate  establishment  of  the  DTW.  In  the\nfirst year, 115 staff will be required, including 21 foreign staff. The number of foreign staff is\nproposed  to  be  reduced  gradually  to  10  in  the  third  year  as  technology  transfer  is\nincorporated in the incentives under the incumbents\u2019 contracts. All international positions will\nbe  in  partnership  with  an  East  Timorese  counterpart.  The  organizational  structure  of  the\nDTW  is  to  include  four  major  functions:  transport,  planning  and  design,  operations,  and\nfinance.\n\n(i)\n\nThe transport division will cover three areas:\n\n(a)\n\nLand transport regulation activities will include\n\nreclassifying roads;\n\nreviewing,  revising,  and  adjusting  the  road  sector  legal\nframework, including a road safety program, to directly cater to\nthe needs of East Timor road users;\n\nestablishing  and  implementing  road  transport  regulations  in\ncollaboration with the police; and\n\nsupporting  the  central  UNTAET  in  preparing  procurement\nguidelines \nthese  are\nfor  works  and  supplies  contracts; \nproposed  to  adhere  to  the  principles  of  economic  efficiency\nfrom  competition  and  establishment  of  a  local  contracting\nindustry.\n\n(b)\n\nMaritime and port sector regulation activities will include\n\nimplementing international conventions, and\n\nmanaging contracts; and\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n\f31\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\n(c)\n\nAviation sector regulation activities will include\n\nimplementing international conventions, and\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nmanaging contracts.\n\n(ii)\n\nThe planning and design division's activities will include\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nmanagement of feasibility studies for capital investment projects, and\ntechnical evaluation of international tenders;\n\ncontract management;\n\nrelations with external financiers; and\n\ndevelopment of a road asset management system.\n\n(iii)\n\nThe  operations  division  will  have  five  regional  centers:  Baucau,  Dili,\nMaliana,  Oecusse,  and  Same.  It  will  carry  out  routine  and  periodic\nmaintenance, and manage works through (a) minor labor-based contracts to\nthe communities to maintain community minor roads (district roads),  and  (b)\nspecific maintenance and periodic maintenance contracts to organized labor.\n\n(iv)\n\nThe  finance  division  will  prepare  budget  requests,  budget  allocation,  and\nreports on disbursements and payments to the national administration.\n\n2.\nThe DTW\u2019s regional centers will be staffed by an international chief road and bridge\nengineer, the chief engineer, an accountant, and a few clerical staff. To the extent possible,\nthe  positions  will  be  filled  with  East  Timorese  who  have  the  appropriate  skills.  The  DTW\nstructure  includes  no  labor  contingent.  Small  labor  groups  are  expected  to  be  provided\nthrough  contractors  that  were  operational  during  the  previous  administration  in  the  sector\nand  have  received  some  experience  during  the  first  months\u2019  emergency  works  proposed\nunder  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s  short-term  road  sector  assessment.\nWhile  skill  levels  will  vary  from  region  to  region,  technical  and  supervisory  skills  are\nexpected  to  be  available.  The  chief  engineers  will  identify  these  skills  and  prepare  a\ntechnical  on-the-job  training  program  to  build  a  local  contracting  industry.  Private  sector\npractices  will  be  encouraged  by,  for  example,  leasing  the  plant  pool  to  local  groups\norganized for undertaking the works.\n\nThe  regional  centers  will  monitor  and  record  road  conditions,  establishing,  in\n3.\ncollaboration with the headquarters, a road asset management system. This will provide the\nbasis  for  prioritizing  road  rehabilitation  requirements  and  maintenance  works  schedules.\nThrough the asset management system, the DTW will establish a road maintenance regime\ncapable  of  carrying  out  works  in  the  immediate  future  based  on  preventive  maintenance\nplanning in the long term and continued monitoring of the road conditions.\n\nA minimum road maintenance plant is proposed to establish a maintenance function\n4.\nand carry out routine and periodic maintenance activities. These activities will be transferred\nto the private sector as soon as the private sector operators have achieved the necessary\n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 5, page 3\n\ncapacity. This capacity building will be supported by the DTW\u2019s operational centers through\ntraining, small contracts, monitoring of the works' standards, and leasing of equipment. Staff\nin the centers will determine, case by case, the requirements for such a support program.\n\nFigure A5: Organization of the Department of Transport and Works\n\nS ecretary -1 (1)\n\nD irector-1  (1 )\nTransp ort\n\nD irector -1  (1 )\nP lannin g an d D es ig n\n\nD irector - 1 (1 )\nO peration s\n\nD irector 1  (1)\nFin ance\n\nLand Tran sport R egu lation  3 (3)\n\nD esign  - 2  (2 )\n\nA ccoun tants  2 (2)\n\nA viation Sector Regulation - 1 (1)\n\nM ajor P rojec ts - 2  (2 )\n\nP orts  S ector R egu lation - 1 (1)\n\nLab oratory 1  (2 )\n\nA sset M anagem ent System  1  (1 )\n\nD ili\n\nB aucau\n\nM alian a\n\nO ecu sse\n\nS am e\n\nD epot C hief (E n gineer)1 (1 )\nTotal D epot S taff 1 6\n\nR oad E ng ineer 1\nB rid ge E n gineer 1\nA ccou ntan t 1\nS urveyors 3\nS up ervisors 2\nM echan ic 2\nO perator Train ers 3\nA dm inistrative A ssistan t 1\n\nNote:\n\nNumbers  outside  of  parenthesis  reflect  year  1  requirement  for  international  staff  and  those  within\nparenthesis domestic staff.

The  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor\n(UNTAET) will award road repair contracts with funding arranged by the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) from the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET) and the consultants will administer\nthe  contracts  to  facilitate  the  establishment  of  regional  road  maintenance  organizations.\nSpecific responsibilities are as follows:\n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\n(iii) \n \n\n(iv) \n \n\n(v) \n \n\n(vi) \n \n\nThe  UNTAET  infrastructure  section  will  open  appropriate  trust  accounts  to\nreceive project funds.\n\nThe UNTAET has awarded a number of short-term emergency road contracts\nthat  effectively  divide  the  road  network  into  five  operational  areas.  These\nareas  are  generally  based  on  the  regional  centers  proposed  by  the  joint\nassessment mission (main text,  para.  5).  The  works  under  the  Project  have\nthe\nbeen  organized  to  coincide  with \nrecommended regional centers will be used to administer project road works.\n\nthis  regional  arrangement  and \n\nThe  UNTAET,  in  collaboration  with  ADB,  will  engage  appropriately-qualified\ndomestic  staff  for  the  Project  as  follows:  (a)  a  project  manager  who  will  be\ncounterpart  to  the  chief  roads  engineer;  (b)  a  project  accountant,  as\ncounterpart  to  a  financial  adviser  (international  consultant);  and  (c)  three\nengineers as counterparts to international road, port, and power engineers.\n\nInternational  contractors  will  be  engaged  to  undertake  priority  maintenance\nworks in each region.\n\nOnce  the  international  contractors  have  established  their  regional  centers,\nthe  UNTAET,  in  collaboration  with  ADB's  technical  assistance  (TA)  for\ntransport  restoration1  and  the  Project,  will  identify  and  engage  the  following\nappropriately  qualified  field  staff  for  the  Project:  (a)  5  regional  engineers  to\nbe  assigned  to  the  regional  centers  as  road  administrators;  (b)  10  road\nsupervisors, 2 assigned to each regional administration; (c) 10 clerical staff, 2\nassigned \ncamp\nwatchmen/cleaners,  3  assigned  to  each  regional  administration.  These  will\nbe funded from the UNTAET\u2019s trust fund.\n\nregional  administration;  and \n\nto  each \n\n(d)  15 \n\nThe  international  contractors  will  work  to  budgets  set  by  network  managers\nfor  road  repairs  and  emergency  power  rehabilitation.

An  ADB  environment  specialist  visited  the  project  sites.  Although  the  Indonesian\nenvironmental  laws  and  regulations  remain  in  effect  in  West  Timor,  the  enforcement  and\nimplementation  capacity  does  not  exist.  The  environmental  management  authorities  were\nmanaged primarily by Indonesian civil servants, who are unlikely to return.\n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project\n\n2.\nThe  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor  (UNTAET)  is  executing  a\nprogram of  humanitarian assistance  in East  Timor.  The  primary objective  of  the  transport  and\npower  infrastructure  is  to  provide  access  to  this  humanitarian  relief.  In  its  current  significantly\ndeteriorated  state,  the  transport  sectors  are  not  able  to  facilitate  humanitarian  efforts  or  help\nensure the security of the country. The  roads  have  become  interrupted  in  many  locations and\ncan carry only very small loads. Humanitarian supply and military vehicles have been lost in the\nriver  crossings  and  a  life  was  lost  on  steep  and  weak  embankment.  Humanitarian  food\ndeliveries are made by flight at the cost of $1,000 per ton. Dili Port has become a bottleneck. Its\ncapacity is extremely limited, evidenced by long queues, at their extreme exceeding a month.\n\n3.\nTransport  and  power  infrastructure  are  essential  to  the  revival  of  economic  activity  in\nEast Timor. Only through revival of the economy and employment can social security and food\nstability be achieved. The Project aims to ensure that the infrastructure can meet these goals. It\nwill incorporate employment-generating methodologies that contribute to poverty reduction and\nnormalization  of  conditions  in East  Timor.  The Project  will (i) undertake emergency  road  repair\nworks to facilitate efficient transport of humanitarian aid and security cargo, and to induce revival\nof  economic  activity;  (ii)  expand  the  capacity  of  port  facilities  to  reduce  congestion;  and  (iii)\nreinstate  power  supply.  The  scope  of  the  Project  includes  (i)  road  rehabilitation,  (ii)  port\nrehabilitation, (iii) power sector rehabilitation, and (iv) establishment of a project management unit.\n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Environment\n\n4.\nEast Timor is eastern half of Timor Island. East Timor has a contiguous area of 19,000\nsquare kilometers (km2), with additional 2,461 km2 in the Oecusse-Ambino enclave inside West\nTimor.    East  Timor  is  the  largest  and  eastern  most  of  the  Lesser  Sunda  Archipelago.  The\nclimate is tropical. The rainy season starts in December and ends in April although the dry and\nwet seasons are not well defined.\n\n5.\nThe island is along the junction of the Australian and the Asian geological plates. Thus, it\nis subject to frequent earthquakes. The rock formations are primarily sedimentary karst uplifted\nby the collision of the two plates. As the formation is quite recent, the  karst  is highly fractured\nand  crumbles  easily.  Metamorphic  rock  from  past  volcanic  activity  is  limited  to  northern  and\ncentral  sections  of  the  island.  The  high  erosion  rates  from  the  crumbling  karst  layers  have\nresulted  in  the  formation  of  alluvial  plains  and  isolated  fertile  valleys.  The  river  systems  are\nshort,  running  almost  perpendicular  to  the  coastline.  The  rivers  cut  deep  ravines  into  the\nunstable rock, forming deep canyons in the highlands and abruptly widening as they reach the\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nflat alluvial plains. Often the rivers narrow as they approache the sea because of obstruction by\nsandbars and intertidal deposits.\n\n2.\n\nBiological Environment\n\n6.\nTimor is on the western side of the Wallacia line. The flora and fauna are similar to that\nof  the  tropical Australia-Pacific  group.  Timor has  no  large animals, but  many  small  mammals,\nsuch as deer, and brightly colored birds. Timor was one of the first islands settled by Europeans\nbecause of its proximity to the Spice Islands. A number of domesticated and feral animals have\nbeen  introduced  to  the  islands,  such  as  horses,  cattle,  chicken,  and  pigs.  During  the  last  10\nyears, the deforestation was officially estimated at 70,000 hectares, with the unofficial estimate\ndouble  this  level.  The  central  highlands  are  cultivated  with  coffee,  mainly  the  robusta  variety.\nEast Timor coffee commands a high price in the world market because of its higher-than-normal\nalkaline  properties.  Rice,  corn,  sorghum,  beans,  and  root  crops  are  grown  in  the  lowlands.\nSlash-and-burn agriculture is common even on the steep hillsides.\n\n3.\n\nSociocultural Environment\n\n7.\nMost of the population is concentrated in the northern  coastal  towns and  in fertile  river\nvalleys in the interior. The coastal flat lands in the south are sparsely populated because of the\nharsh  mountain  terrain  that  divides  the  island.  Sea  travel  from  the  north  to  the  south  is\nconstrained by strong waves most of the year. The economy is based on agriculture, with coffee\nthe  major export  crop.  Surplus  rice,  corn,  and other agricultural produce  are  consumed  within\nthe island.  The poor road and port facilities discourage exporting although the potential is high,\nespecially from the flat plains in the south. There is little industry or manufacturing. A number of\nmineral  deposits  have  been  identified,  but  their  commercial  potential  has  not  been  explored.\nThe  service  industry  was,  during  the  Indonesian  period,  limited  to  the  civil  service  and  state-\nowned corporations, such as telecommunications, power, and oil and gas  distribution.  Trading\nand  other  commercial  activities  were  limited  to  traditional  market  places  in  small  settlements.\nBanks,  restaurants,  hotels,  and  other  businesses  were  mostly  found  in  the  two  large  urban\ncenters:  Dili  and  Baucau.  Most  of  the  formal  businesses  were  burned  down  during  the\npostconsultation destruction.\n\nAlmost 70  percent  of  the  schools  were destroyed  during the  postconsultation  violence.\n\n8.\nAt present, classes are conducted in open yards and roofless buildings.\n\nTetum is the local language, with Bhasa Indonesia and Portuguese spoken by sizeable\n9.\nportions  of  the  population.  Almost  95  percent  of  the  population  are  Roman  Catholics,  with  a\nsmall Muslim and Protestant population.\n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigating Measures\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Environment\n\nRoad Works. The main impact of the emergency road project is quarrying for rock and\n10.\nsand. However, the quarry sites are small and scattered along the road with alignments close to\nriver systems. In most instances, less than a 100 cubic meters of sand and rock will be required\nfrom a particular quarry site. Most of the road erosion is caused by poor drainage design, lack of\nmaintenance, and impact of heavy loads. Silt from drainage cleaning will be used to fill quarry\nsites, especially those beyond rivers. Farmers who want some landfill will be allowed access to\nthe silt. When constructing the drainage lines, careful attention will be paid to directing the flow\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nof the water as close as possible to the normal drainage channel and away from farmlands and\nother road sections that could be eroded.\n\n11.\nPort  Works:  The  impact  of  the  emergency  port  project  is  limited  to  normal  noise  and\nincreases in seawater turbidity related to the construction activity. Those effects are temporary\nand reversible. Oil pollution from ballast discharge and maintenance of ship engines may have\nlonger  term  impacts  on  the  environment.  Oil  slicks  were  noted  in  the  harbor.  Effective\nsurveillance  of  the  berthed  ships  is  an  important  component  of  the  environmental  monitoring\ncapacity  of  the  port  authorities,  and  will  be  developed  under  the  ADB-funded  technical\nassistance  (TA)  3401,  the  Transport  Sector  Restoration  Project.  Improved  port  environmental\nmanagement is expected to improve the environmental conditions even with an increase in ship\ntraffic.\n\nPower  Subproject.  The  main  concern  with  rehabilitation  of  the  power  generation  and\n12.\ndistribution  capacity  is  the  proper  collection  of  unusable \nthat  could  be\ncontaminated  with  polychlorinated  biphenyl  (PCB).  PCB  has  been  known  to  cause  serious\nhealth problem in birds, fish, and reptiles, although its impact on mammals (including humans)\nis low. Transformers and electrical devices that may be contaminated with PCB will be collected\nand  stored  in  a  secured  area.  The  area  will  be  fenced  to  prevent  accidental  recovery  of\ncontaminated  materials,  and  bound  to  prevent  contamination  through  surface  runoff.  Ultimate\ndisposal of PCB and PCB-contaminated materials is expensive.  In some  developed countries,\nhigh  temperature  incinerators  are  used  to  destroy  PCB,  but  are  reluctant  to  accept\ncontaminated  materials  from  foreign  sources  for  processing.  Thus,  secured  storage  for  future\nprocessing is the most logical procedure for East Timor\n\ntransformers \n\n.\n2.\n\nBiological Environment\n\n13.\nRoad  Works.  The  emergency  road  works  will  have  limited  impact  on  the  biological\nenvironment.  The  most  serious  impact  would  result from  erosion  if  the  drainage  channels  are\nnot  properly  designed,  as  some  trees  maybe  washed  out  if  the  water  flows  away  from  the\nnormal drainage pattern. The civil works will be sensitive to these potential impacts.\n\nPort  Works.  The  emergency  port  works  will  have  a  minimal  impact  on  the  biological\n14.\nenvironment  because  they  merely  involve  concreting.  Dili  Port  will  not  involve  any  dredging,\nbackfilling, or piling operations.\n\nPower  Subproject.  The  emergency  power  subproject  will  have  no  impact  on  the\n15.\nbiological environment as it will be implemented within the existing power plant structure and the\ndistribution  lines  along  the  existing  rights-of-way.  Improved  handling  of  PCB-contaminated\ntransformers, spent oil, and sludge will remove those potential pollutants from the environment.\n\n3.\n\nSociocultural Environment\n\n16.\nRoad Works. The works will use the existing road rights-of-way. No land acquisition or\nresettlement will be required. The sociocultural impact will be mostly positive. During the next 12\nmonths, the works are expected to assist in the flow of food and agricultural supplies to famine\nstricken areas, resettlement of displaced persons, and enforcement of peace and order. In the\nmedium  term,  the  Project  will  help  reconstruct  East  Timor.  Improved  road  conditions  are\nexpected  to  facilitate  commerce,  communication,  and  cultural  interaction  among  the  different\nparts of East Timor.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\n17.\nPort  Works.  The  port  works  will  not  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  The\nimpacts and benefits of the project on the sociocultural environment are similar to those of the\nroad works.\n\n18.\nPower Subproject. The subproject will restore the  power  supply  to  vital  services  such\nas water supply, hospital, schools, markets, communication, and cottage industries. The project\nwill not require any land or resettlement. Thus, the impacts on the sociocultural environment are\nmostly positive, similar to those of the road and port works.\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\nIndonesian  environmental  laws  and  regulations  remain  in  effect  in  East  Timor.  The\n19.\npersonnel  implementing  and  enforcing  the  environmental  laws  and  regulations  were  mostly\nIndonesian nationals and are not expected to return to East Timor. The UNTAET needs support\nin  reviewing \nto  undertake  environmental\nassessments. ADB\u2019s TA is proposed to assist in these areas.\n\nthese  regulations  and  developing  capacity \n\n20.\nThe  project  will  also  establish  capacity  in  the  port  sector  to  analyze  oil  in  water  and\nmonitor oil pollution in the sea and in discharges from ships. In the power subsector, capacity to\nanalyze for oil pollution, noise, and smoke  will be  provided.  In  the  road  subsector,  capacity to\nmonitor  noise,  suspended  solids,  and  sediment  load  will  be  included  in  the  project.  The\npersonnel trained in the project will report directly to the project manager.\n\nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\nHuman  resources  and  institutions  need  to  be  trained  for  environmental  and  natural\n\n21.\nresources management. A database and monitoring programs need to be developed\n\nG.\n\nConclusions\n\n22.\nThe  potential  environmental  impacts  are  limited  to  construction  activities  that  are\ntemporary  and  reversible.  The  medium-  and  long-term  impacts  of  the  proposed  Project  are\npositive, especially in promoting the economic and social development of East Timor, facilitating\nreconstruction and redevelopment. A detailed environmental impact assessment is not needed.\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nA.\n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries\n\nINITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n\nOn  4  September  1999  when  the  referendum  results  were  announced  in  favor  of\n1.\nindependence,  violence  broke out  in  East  Timor.  More  than 80  percent  of  the  population  was\ndisplaced. Their houses, workplaces, schools, hospitals, and places of worship were destroyed,\nand  farmlands  were  abandoned.  Massive  relief  efforts  by  the  international  community  were\nneeded to avert famine and restore peace and order, basic services, and infrastructure. Details\nof the damage and its impact on the population are given in paragraphs 3 and 5-7 of the main\nreport on the project grant.\n\nThe  immediate benefits  of  the  emergency  port  and  road  projects  are  facilitating  the  (i)\n2.\nmovement  of  food  supplies  to  famine-stricken  areas;  (ii)  movement  of  agricultural  supplies,\nspecifically  seeds  for  farmers  to  start  growing  food;  (iii)  resettlement  of  internally  displaced\npersons  and  refugees;  and  (iv)  movement  of  the  United  Nations  peacekeeping  forces.  These\nprojects will utilize labor, especially in rural areas where heavy equipment is difficult to transfer\nand the required road standards are low. The use of local labor will stimulate the local economy\nand  help  in  the  reconstruction of  the  communities.  The  immediate  beneficiaries  of  the  Project\nare the famine stricken areas of East Timor and the semi- and unemployed rural workers.\n\n3.\nBeneficiaries  of  the  emergency power  subproject  will primarily  be the  urban  and  semi-\nurban  population.  The  power  project  will  assist  in  the  operation  of  essential  services  such  as\nwater supply, hospitals, schools, commercial establishments, and industries.\n\nB.\n\nNeeds, Demands, and Absorptive Capacity\n\n4.\nThe emergency Project will restore the roads and power supply to levels equal to those\nthat  existed  prior  to  the  conflict.    The  demands  are  slightly  lower  from  the  local  population\nbecause of  the  economic  dislocation,  but demand  from  the  international  community  relief  and\nrehabilitation efforts more than accounts for the slack in domestic demand.  The relief efforts are\ncongesting the ports and straining the road network as food is rushed to famine stricken areas,\ndisplaced  people  return  to  their  homes,  and  support  services  are  provided.  These  include\nmedicines, seeds and agricultural inputs, temporary shelters, and reconstruction materials. The\nproject  will  also  stimulate  employment  in  the  rural  areas  and  assist  in  the  long-term\nreconstruction of East Timor.\n\n5.\nThe Project  will  have a direct  positive  impact  on  the  estimated  80  percent  of  the  East\nTimorese displaced by the conflict. As the Project will restore road conditions and power supply\nto  the  level  available before the  conflict,  its outputs are  within  the  absorptive  capacity  of  East\nTimor.  The  completion of the unfinished  section  of  the  port  facilities  and  repair  of  the  landing\nfacilities  are  also  within  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the  local  economy  and  the  international\ncommunity currently operating in the country.\n\nC.\n\nAdverse Effects on Vulnerable Groups\n\nThe Project will not involve any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement. Project  works  will  use\n\n6.\nthe existing rights-of-way. The Project will not have negative impacts on any vulnerable group.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nD.\n\nSocial Dimensions in Project Design\n\n7.\nPoverty.  The  conflict  has  reduced  a  large  portion  of  East  Timor  to  poverty,  and  in  a\nnumber  of  instances  potentially  to  starvation.  The  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  in\ngenerating employment especially for unskilled and semiskilled labor, under the road repair and\npower restoration components. Most of the industries and services in East Timor are using low\ntechnology  that  easily  accommodates  low  skilled  workers.  The  Project  is  expected  to  hire\ndirectly 10,000 semiskilled workers throughout East Timor for short durations during the next 12\nmonths.\n\n8.\nGender. Women,  especially  the  pregnant  and  those  with  infant  children,  are  the  most\nvulnerable  group  to  insufficient  food  intake.  The  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  group  is  most\npositive, as  it  will help  transport  food  and  agricultural  inputs  to  rebuild  farms.  The  emergency\npower project will help restore water supply and health care facilities, and reestablish schools.\n\nMinorities.  East  Timor  has  no  identified  minority  groups.    Rural  communities  are  the\n9.\nmain beneficiaries of the road works, specifically areas that were not able to plant in late 1999\nand early 2000 because of the conflict and are currently facing possible famine. The project will\nalso  help  rural  communities  rebuild  the  agriculture  sector,  which  will  help  them  buy  needed\nconstruction materials to rebuild houses and buildings destroyed during the conflict.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement. The project will not involve any land acquisition or\n\n10.\nresettlement, as described (para. 6).\n\nE.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n11.\nThe project management unit will supervise, monitor, and review with the road and port\ncontractors, the recruitment and hiring of local residents during implementation. The emergency\nroad repair program will be coordinated with various relief and assistance  activities,  especially\nthe World Food Program and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. The program\nwill focus on sections that need high priority maintenance and  repair.  The  Asian  Development\nBank  is  currently  doing  a  tariff  study  for  the  power  sector  and  a  socioeconomic  profile  of  the\nusers will be made. The tariffs established will include mechanisms to allow the poor access to\nthe electricity.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CONTENTS\n", "THE PROPOSAL\n", "INTRODUCTION\n", "SUMMARY\n", "MAP\n", "I.\n", "II.\n", "III.\n", "IV.\n", "BACKGROUND\nA.\nB.\nC.\nD.\n", "Description of Damage\nResponse to Crisis\nTransport Subsector Description\nExternal Assistance and Donor Coordination\n", "REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE\nA.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\nG. \nH.\n", "Rationale\nObjectives\nScope\nCost Estimates\nFinancing Plan\nThe Executing Agency\nImplementing Arrangements\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n", "V. \n", "APPROVAL\n", "APPENDIXES\n", "Page\n", "ii\n", "iv\n", "1\n", "1\n", "1\n1\n2\n4\n11\n", "11\n11\n11\n11\n12\n12\n13\n13\n17\n", "18\n", "ADB\nDTW\nGDP\nIDA\nIMF\nInterfet\nJAM\nNGO\nPMU\nTA\nTFET\nUN\nUNDP\nUNHCR\nUNPKF\nUNTAET\nWFP\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Development Bank\ndepartment of transport and works\ngross domestic product\nInternational Development Association\nInternational Monetary Fund\nInternational Force for East Timor\njoint assessment mission\nnongovernment organization\nproject management unit\ntechnical assistance\nTrust Fund for East Timor\nUnited Nations\nUnited Nations Development Programme\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\nUnited Nations Peacekeeping Force\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor\nWorld Food Programme\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES\n", "km (kilometers)\nkW (kilowatt)\nm (meters)\nMW (megawatt)\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "1,000 meters\n1,000 watts\nunit of length\n1,000,000 watts\n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n(ii)\n", "The fiscal year of UNTAET is from 1 August to 31 July.\nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.\n"]}
