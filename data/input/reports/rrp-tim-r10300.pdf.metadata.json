The  roads  have  been\ndamaged in many locations and can only carry very small loads.\nHumanitarian aid  and  military  vehicles  have been  lost  in  river\ncrossings  and  one  person  died  on  a  steep  and  weak\nembankment. Food aid is flown in at the cost of $1,000 per ton.\nBecause of Dili Port's extremely limited capacity, it has become a\nbottleneck  to  channelling  humanitarian  aid  to  the  population.\nPower supply is needed to facilitate water supply and is essential\nto  health  services,  but  most  of  the  power  stations  are\nunoperational due to damage and because operating staff and\nfuel are lacking. Restoration of power supply will enable operation\nof borehole water pumps, provision of emergency health care, and\nresumption of economic activities.\nBeneficiary East Timor.\nProject Description The Project will (i) undertake emergency road  repair  works to\nfacilitate efficient transport of humanitarian aid and help revive\neconomic  activity;  (ii)  expand  the  port  facilities  to  reduce\ncongestion, and (iii) reinstate power supply. The Project will also\nsupport  financial  management  of  the  power  sector,  and\nimplementation of transport sector institutions. The closely related\nADB technical assistance (TA) 3401: Transport Sector Restoration\nProject will help establish management of the transport subsectors\nand  support,  in  tandem  with  the  Project,  implementation  of\nefficient management mechanisms and institutions.\nThe Project has been classified as environmental category B. An\ninitial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken,  and  its\nsummary is a core appendix.\nThe immediate benefits of the Project include facilitating the (i)\nprovision of food supplies to famine stricken areas, (ii) provision of\nagricultural  supplies  to  enable  cultivation,  (iii)  resettlement  of\ninternally displaced persons and refugees, and (iv) movement of\nthe United Nations Peacekeeping Forces. The Project will employ\npeople especially in rural areas, where poverty is extreme and\nmost people do not have income-generating opportunities. The\nuse of local labor will stimulate the economy and thus help the\nreconstruction of the communities.\nThe beneficiaries of the power component are primarily the urban\nand semiurban population. The reinstatement of power supply will\nmake possible provision of essential services such as water supply,\nhospitals, schools, commercial establishments, and industries.", "iii\nExecuting Agency The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor will\nbe the recipient of the grant. The Project will be executed and\nimplemented by a project management unit (PMU), comprising\nfive East Timorese project management staff and five international\ncounterparts including a chief technical adviser. A project steering\ncommittee involving broad stakeholder representation will monitor\nimplementation.\nCost Estimates The total Project cost is estimated at $29.8 million equivalent. The\nand Financing Plan Project will be financed by a grant of $29.8 million from the Trust\nFund for East Timor (TFET). These funds have been contributed\nby  donors  and  do  not  include  resources  from  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  International  Development\nAssociation of the World Bank Group is the Trustee of TFET.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 December 2002.\nEstimated Project  31 May 2002.\nCompletion Date\nProcurement of Goods Civil works will be awarded on the basis of international shopping\nand Services and international competitive bidding in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  on  Procurement.  International  contractors  are\nencouraged  to  include  joint-venture  arrangements  with  local\ncontractors  and  will  utilize  labor-intensive  methodologies.\nEligibility  for  procurement  and  engagement  of  consultants  will\ninclude ADB member countries, East Timor, and all donors and\nmembers of international organizations that have contributed to\nthe TFET.\nInternational consulting services will be required for the PMU and\nconstruction  supervision.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of\ndomestic consultants.", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your information the following report on a project grant to the United\nNations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) for the benefit of East Timor\nfrom the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET) for the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation\nProject.1 The Project framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The  UNTAET  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  prepare\nemergency assistance to rehabilitate the damaged  infrastructure for  early  restoration  of\nnormal socioeconomic activities. An ADB appraisal mission2 visited East Timor from 7 to 18\nFebruary 2000 and prepared the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project with the\nauthorized  UNTAET  representatives.  The  agreements  reached  were  confirmed  in  a\nmemorandum of understanding. Funding for the Project will be drawn from the TFET, which is\nestablished under the trusteeship of the International Development Association (IDA) of the\nWorld Bank Group. The TFET does not include ADB\u2019s own resources. The Project has been\nprepared in accordance with Doc. R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund\nfor East Timor, approved by the Board on 23 March 2000, and also in accordance with ADB\u2019s\npolicies and procedures for rehabilitation assistance after disasters (Doc. R191-88, Rev. 1,\nFinal), including disasters caused by civil strife. Doc. R191-88 specifically allows for shortened\nprocessing procedures and flexibility in implementation arrangements for such assistance.\nNegotiations of the Grant Agreement for the Project were completed with the UNTAET on 29\nMarch in the field.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA.  Description of Damage\n3. In the democratic consultation of 30 August 1999, the people of East Timor voted\noverwhelmingly for independence. During the following month, East Timor experienced a\ncampaign of destruction and terror, during which three quarters of the population fled their\nhomes and most of the country\u2019s infrastructure and private homes were destroyed. In the\nwestern half of the territory and the highland areas, all property of value were removed,\nburned, or destroyed, including residential and public buildings, utilities, telecommunications\nfacilities, inventories of essential food, and agriculture stocks. The eastern half experienced\nsimilar attacks with an estimated 75 percent of residential buildings destroyed. East Timor\nremains only partially inhabited. Refugees are gradually returning from West Timor and the\nforest, with the support of humanitarian relief coordinated by the Office for Coordination of\nHumanitarian  Affairs  (OCHA).  Consequent  to  the  postconsultation  destruction,  all\nadministrative structures are dysfunctional. This includes public offices tasked to manage the\ninfrastructure sectors. All public documentation and premises have been destroyed.\n                                                       \n1 The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 2000.\n2\nThe mission comprised S. Jarvenpaa, Project Economist (Mission Leader); E. Ouano, Sr. Environmental\nSpecialist; M. Carr, Road Engineer/Consultant; M. Lewis, Energy Engineer/Consultant; E. To, United Nations\nDevelopment Programme Infrastructure Specialist; K. Lonngren, Energy Adviser, Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\nFinland; E. da Silva, Counterpart Team Leader; J. Alves, Counterpart Road Engineer; V. Guterrez, Counterpart\nPower Specialist; and F. Guterrez, Counterpart Port Specialist.", "2\nB. Response to Crisis\n1.  UNTAET Organization\n4. Under a resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations (UN), the UNTAET\nwas established with powers to (i) ensure stability, (ii) establish a transitional government, and\n(iii) establish the judiciary, laws, and policies. The UNTAET will administer East Timor for 2-3\nyears, when general elections are planned. The UNTAET is headed by an administrator and\ncomprises  three  sections:  (i)  humanitarian  assistance,  (ii)  public  administration  and\ngovernance,  and  (iii)  the  United  Nations  Peacekeeping  Force  (UNPKF).  Each  section  is\nheaded by a deputy special representative of the Secretary General (DSRSG). Management of\ninfrastructure sectors is a responsibility of the head of infrastructure, who is a UNTAET staff\nmember under the public administration and governance section, and is supported by a staff\nperson responsible for telecommunications, postal services, electricity, water and sanitation,\ntransport and roads, port management, and civil aviation. The UNTAET\u2019s organization chart is\nin  Appendix  2.  The  UNTAET\u2019s  recurrent  budget  is  drawn  from  its  trust  fund  using  UN\ndisbursement guidelines. For the first quarter of 2000, transport has been allocated a recurrent\nbudget of $390,000 and electricity, $825,000. The allocations will be reassessed for the next\nquarter. Under the UN disbursement guidelines, the allocations will be used for salaries of East\nTimorese  employees  and  recurrent  consumables  such  as  fuel.  The  UNTAET\u2019s  financial\nadministration  will  be  strengthened  with  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  technical\nassistance (TA). The UNTAET's financial year runs from 1 August to 31 July. The National\nConsultative Council (NCC) comprising representatives of the UNTAET, East Timorese civil\nsociety, and Catholic church, coordinates UNTAET activities with East Timor civil society.\nCurrently, the UNTAET chairs sector committees to coordinate sector activities among donors,\nUN agencies, and nongovernment ogranizations (NGOs).\n5. The capital development budget, to be drawn from the TFET, was assessed by a\nWorld  Bank-coordinated  and  multiagency  joint  assessment  mission  (JAM)  in  October-\nNovember 1999. The JAM identified needs for TA and investment projects in consultation\nwith the National Council for East Timorese Resistance (CNRT), World Bank, and UNTAET,\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the International Force for East Timor\n(Interfet).  During  the  JAM,  ADB  reviewed  transport  sector  restoration  and  development\nrequirements in the short term (1-2 years) and medium term (2-3 years).\n2. Impact of Crisis on Poverty\n6. In 1996, when East Timor was part of Indonesia, its gross domestic product (GDP)\nper capita income was $431. The Indonesian national average was $1,153. As a result of the\n1997 Asian crisis, GDP in Indonesia including East Timor declined as the devaluation of the\nIndonesian  rupiah  and  high  interest  rates  dampened  economic  activities  throughout\nSoutheast Asia. Indonesia was the country hit hardest by the Asian crisis, and poverty\nincreased. However, the decline in East Timor's GDP was more pronounced due to its\ndependence on Indonesian central government grants, which financed up to 85 percent of\nthe current and capital expenditure. Between 1997 and the 1999 referendum, the East\nTimorese GDP was estimated to have contracted by 25 percent as a result of the Asian\nfinancial crisis. In 1996, 30 percent of the households were living in poverty\u2014double the\nnational average in Indonesia. The number of households living below the poverty line rose\nto an estimated 50-60 percent as the result of the Asian crisis.", "3\n7. On 4 September 1999, the results of the democratic referendum were announced to\nfavor independence. The ensuing violence resulted in extensive damage to private and\npublic  buildings,  their  contents,  and  basic  infrastructure.  About  75  percent  of  the\ninfrastructure was destroyed and GDP declined to half or less of its previous level. About\n175,000 people were displaced out of East Timor and reduced to acute poverty in refugee\ncamps. Another 200,000 people were displaced within East Timor. More than 50 percent of\nthe total population were dislocated by the violence. Although an estimated 118,000 people\nhave returned to their villages, a large portion of the population faces starvation as their\ncrops, seeds, and other means of livelihood were destroyed. The international community,\nspecifically through the World Food Programme (WFP),  has been distributing food and\nseeds. Even the small East Timorese middle and upper income groups were not spared from\npoverty as banks and their records were burned. The banking sector in East Timor was\nexclusively serviced by Indonesian banks, and only three have plans to reopen and possibly\nsettle depositors\u2019 claims. Up to 80 percent of the East Timorese could be living below the\npoverty line and a large portion are facing starvation. However, the food stability would\nimprove if agriculture recovers as expected this year. WFP estimates that by the end of the\nyear 2000, a considerable portion of the population will no longer be at risk of starvation, and\nWFP will then be able to scale down its intervention.\n8. The savings rates of families who find employment in the reconstruction activities, or\nthose able to harvest crops in 2000, are expected to be very low for the next five years. A\nconsiderable portion of these incomes will be used for rebuilding residences, replacing their\ncontents,  and  rebuilding  livelihoods.  The  current  living  conditions  are  extremely  poor,\naggravated by a very high level of unemployment. The population is surviving on day-to-day\naccess to nourishment. Burned houses are temporarily rebuilt using plastic sheets, tenting\nmaterials, and scraps. While reconstruction activities are expected to generate employment,\nthe neglect of basic infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports, and power supply facilities has\nincreased the cost of moving goods and services within the country. For example, travel from\nDili to Ainaro now costs $4.30 compared to $0.70 a year ago. Food prices increased by as\nmuch as 200 percent during the two months of the violence. These have since declined due to\nintervention from the international community. While the risk of starvation is being overcome,\ninfrastructure bottlenecks hamper the aid delivery and economic recovery.\n3. Restoration Programs\n9. In  response  to  the  crisis,  the  United  Nations  Mission  in  East  Timor  (UNAMET)\nestablished  emergency  services  and  humanitarian  assistance  of  the  UN  and  bilateral\nagencies. The Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\u2019 short-term needs assessment,\nthe Consolidated Appeal, identified immediate humanitarian needs for the first three months\nfrom December 1999 to March 2000 in the amount of $199 million. These do not include\nrestoration of the infrastructure.\n10. To plan for the urgent medium-term rehabilitation in a coordinated manner, ADB\njoined  the  JAM  in  October-November  1999.  A  concurrent  IMF  mission  assessed  the\nmacroeconomic parameters and prepared an initial macroeconomic framework. As a result,\nADB and the World Bank have agreed to work together to assist the East Timorese people\nand  UNTAET  in  the  reconstruction  and  socioeconomic  development  of  the  country.  In\nparticular, during the Tokyo donors\u2019 conference of 17 December 1999, representatives of the\ntwo institutions and other donors have endorsed the cooperative use of grant resources from\nthe TFET. ADB is to be the lead agency for restoring the infrastructure sector including the", "4\ntransport, energy, telecommunications, and water and sanitation. ADB's Board has approved\ndelegated approval of project proposals by ADB's Management, expanded eligibility under\nADB's  procurement  guidelines,  disbursement  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB's\ndisbursement guidelines, and the establishment of grant agreements of projects funded\nunder the TFET.3\n11. Concurrently with the JAM, UNDP commissioned a short-term needs assessment in\nthe infrastructure sectors covering, inter alia, roads, ports, and energy. UNDP does not,\nhowever, have the resources to address the identified emergency infrastructure rehabilitation\nrequirements.  Subsequently,  UNDP  has  endorsed  ADB\u2019s  lead-agency  mandate  in  the\ninfrastructure sectors and in preparing the Project.\n12. The  ADB-funded  TA  3401:  Transport  Sector  Restoration  Project4  will  implement\nADB\u2019s first intervention in the three transport subsectors by taking steps to establish the\ninstitutions and regulatory frameworks in the road, port, and airport subsectors, and by\nreviewing the long-term development requirements to enable these subsectors to contribute\nto poverty reduction and economic growth. The Project will be integrated with this process. In\nthe power subsector, Portugal will assist the UNTAET to establish a power utility and the\nProject will support development of financial management. ADB has undertaken port and\nairport subsector pricing studies that advise the UNTAET on immediately implementable user\ncharges. A similar study will be conducted in the power subsector in March 2000.\nC. Transport Subsector Description\n13. The transport system in East Timor is multimodal, comprising about 8,000 kilometers\n(km) of roads, 1,400 km being major arteries; one container port, three smaller wharves,\nsmall jetties, and landings; and two international airports and eight grass airstrips. The past\ndemand for the transport system in East Timor has been that of a provincial economy.\nInternal traffic in East Timor depends on land transport. The domestic maritime transport is\ncurrently limited and has potential for growth. Infrastructure has been constructed under\nIndonesian central government budget. Only limited, if any, maintenance has been carried\nout. While there is no  evidence  of  physical damage  to  the  transport  infrastructure,  the\npostreferendum violence resulted in the  removal and  destruction of all  transport-related\nproperty, including equipment and vehicles. Infrastructure has also suffered from a long-term\nlack of maintenance.\n1.  Roads\na. Description\n14. East Timor is 265 km long and 92 km wide, with a central mountain spine closer to the\nnorthern than to the southern coast. The highland is typically precipitous, but rarely exceeds\n3,000  meters  (m).  The  predominant  geology  in  the  highland  area  is  lightly  consolidated\nsedimentary materials overlying limestone. The island lies wholly within the equatorial region,\nand receives monsoon rainfall from November to April, averaging 2,500 millimeter per year.\n                                                       \n3 R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, 23 March. An arrangement for the\nTFET and an expansion of eligibility under ADB's procurement and engagement of consultant guidelines to\ninclude member countries, East Timor, and all donor and member of international organizations that have\nprovided contribution funds to the TFET.\n4\nTA 3401-ETM: Transport Sector Restoration, for $1,000,000, approved on 10 February 2000.", "5\nThe rest of the year is hot and dry. Vegetation is tropical savannah with medium to light tree\ncover. Coffee is grown and cattle are reared in parts of the central highlands. The southern\ncoastal plain is suited to rice and wheat production, but is not developed.\n15. The road network is supported by the main coastal east-west arteries along the\nnorthern and southern coast lines. These are connected by the north-south secondary roads.\nThe main road network totals 1,400 km and about 6,600 km of rural roads, with about 50\npercent of them sealed. All roads have suffered from long-term neglect of maintenance. The\nmain  centers  of  population,  including  the  capital,  Dili,  are  on  the  north  coast,  and  are\nconnected by the county\u2019s principal roads. The condition of the southern coastal road varies\ngreatly: some sections are paved and are in good condition, while others are little more than\ntracks. The route crosses a number of large braided rivers by a combination of bridges and\ncauseways. These causeways are vulnerable to the natural realignment of the waterways, and\ntwo major bridges, Punta Cassa and Zumala, are incomplete. Five national and provincial\nnorth-south roads, all showing severe signs of neglect, provide vehicular access to the south\ncoast. During the dry season, the riverbeds are exposed and are inappropriate for inland river\ntravel. During the rainy season, rivers cut the roads and interrupt the transport system. The\nroad drainage needs immediate clearance and restoration. In all towns, the road drainage\nneeds to be cleared to avoid disruptive flooding. The roads have narrow carriageways of\nabout 3 m, steep banks with poor stability, and poor pavement surfaces and drainage. An\ninventory of the road network and bridges is in Appendix 3.\n16. Present road usage is dominated by Interfet, the UN military, and by aid agencies'\nvehicles,  in  particular  by  those  of  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees\n(UNHCR) and WFP. This will continue in the foreseeable future. This usage exposes the roads\nto relatively heavy loads, which has exacerbated widespread pavement damage. In addition,\ntracked military vehicles have damaged road surfaces in some places. Much of the road\nnetwork has deteriorated significantly due to lack of maintenance and an upsurge in traffic.\nDuring the rains that commenced in November 1999, some roads became impassable, and\nothers dangerous and difficult to use. Humanitarian aid can also be delivered through coastal\nshipping and to beaches, and by air. However, these modes are more expensive than land\ntransport and the onward distribution relies on part of the road network.\n17. The road network is fragile. It has been constructed for low traffic volumes and light\naxle loadings. It traverses steep and unstable mountain slopes, experiences intense tropical\nrainfall, and crosses many wide rivers with ill-defined riverbeds. Under normal conditions, the\nnetwork would require a moderately high level of maintenance. Under current conditions, the\nroads are rapidly deteriorating. Interfet was able to maintain the road access it requires, but the\nexpedient nature of such works means that the improvements are frequently transitory and of\nlittle benefit to other users. Interfet has maintained key parts of the road network to give access\nto civilian vehicles\u2014particularly on sections of the northern east-west road. Since January\n2000, Interfet has handed security operations to UNPKF. UNPKF will have a reduced capacity\nto maintain roads in future.\n18. About half of the road network is paved. This represents an extremely valuable national\nasset. Given the foreseeable economic circumstances for the country, an extensively paved\nnational road network could be  an  irreplaceable  national  asset  that  could  be  irreparably\ndamaged if regular maintenance is not instituted as a matter of urgency. Road conditions are\ngiven in Appendix 4.", "6\nb. Medium- to Long-Term Sector Development\n19. A 12-month emergency works program for keeping the roads open has been outlined in\na UNDP-funded short-term study. The works were estimated to cost $15 million. The identified\nworks include repair of road bank slips, slides, and potholes, and embankment strengthening.\nUNDP is funding labor-based drainage clearance with $0.5 million from the Government of\nNorway. The Government of United Kingdom will fund $1.6 million of these needs through its\nDepartment for International Development. Both programs are highly labor-intensive and will\nend in April 2000.\n20. ADB-funded TA for transport restoration (footnote 4) will prepare a comprehensive\ntransport sector plan. This will focus on establishing an efficient and effective multimodal\ntransport system to support long-term development and growth in East Timor. The plan will\noutline  and  initiate  establishment  of  efficient  institutions  in  the  transport  subsectors.  In\ndeveloping these, the proposals and implementation mechanisms will pay particular attention\nto private sector involvement and to the infrastructure requirements of the poor. Specifically,\nthe TA will (i) review the legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks; (ii) propose and establish\nimmediate  management  and  administrative  structures;  and  (iii)  outline  specifications  for\nimmediate and long-term restoration needs and development. The TA includes development of\nmanagement contracts for airports and ports to integrate efficient sector operations, and cost\nrecovery development. It will also prepare a road sector management system integrating the\nstrengthening and training activities under the  Project  with  long-term  sector  development\nneeds.\nc. Subsector Management\n21. The  UNTAET\u2019s  current  sector  management  involves  four  people:  the  head  of\ninfrastructure, a roads engineer, a port manager, and an aviation official. A department of\ntransport and works (DTW), with headquarters in Dili, is proposed to be established to manage\nthe transport system covering all subsectors. The DTW would be set up during the UNTAET\ntenure, for transport infrastructure management and to concurrently facilitate long-term sector\ndevelopment and capacity building. The DTW's structure will incorporate the principles of\nprivate  sector  participation,  development  of  a  maintenance  culture,  human  resources\ndevelopment, and competition. An objective is to gradually develop East Timorese capacity to\nmanage, and improve the transport infrastructure assets to facilitate economic development\nand growth. The DTW\u2019s administrative structure will aim to institute a road asset management\nand  maintenance  system  that  establishes  local  capacity  to  manage  transport  needs  for\neconomic development. The DTW will have four major divisions: (i) a transport division to\nassume regulatory and policy responsibilities for the three modal subsectors, (ii) a planning\nand design division, (iii) an operations division, and (iv) a finance division. Consultant support\nto the UNTAET will be provided under the ADB-funded TA for transport restoration, to initiate\nestablishment of the DTW. The project management unit will become the nucleus of the new\nadministration. A total of 115 staff members are required in the first year, including a maximum\nof 21 foreign staff. The number of foreign staff will be reduced gradually to 10 in the third year\nas technology transfer is incorporated in the incentives under the incumbents\u2019 contracts. All\ninternational positions will be coupled with East Timorese counterparts. An organization chart\nof the planned DTW is in Appendix 5.", "7\n2.  Ports\na. Subsector Description\n22. The  maritime  infrastructure  includes  Dili  Port;  Carabela  Port  in  Laleia  with  a\nmechanical roll-on roll-off facility; Com Port; smaller wharves in Oecusse and Liquica; and\nslip  landing  structures  and  sites  in  Dili,  Batugade,  Oecusse,  and  Suai. While  the  port\nstructures have not been damaged by the postconsultation destruction, all equipment were\ndestroyed.  Few  navigation  aids  exist,  and  these  are  now  in  operation.  There  are  no\nestablished cargo handling systems or cargo handling equipment, save an inoperable crane\non wheels. Shippers make their own arrangements with two Australian private sector cargo-\nhandlers, who bring their own equipment. At all the ports, all vessels need to be  self-\nsufficient with lifting gear. Other than at Dili Port and cargo landings at Suai, the wharves are\nused only to a very limited extent; some not at all. The use of port facilities outside of Dili is\nconstrained by narrow roads and poor road conditions.\n23. Given  the  large  cargo  volumes  and  the  physical  constraints,  Dili  Port  is  under\npressure and highly congested. Commercial vessels have experienced long turn-around\ntimes. This congestion hampers timely delivery of relief and security goods to East Timor. It\nalso increases the cost of humanitarian aid, and has led to acute shortage of food and other\nrelief material in the rural areas, where returning refugees are left with minimal support.\ni. Operations at Dili Port\n24. The wharf at Dili Port is 180 m long and 20 m wide, has a draft of 7.2 m, and has the\ncapacity to handle 7,000 tons. Demand for port services and infrastructure has dramatically\nincreased since the consultation as a result of the humanitarian and security activities. The\nberths at Dili Port have a queue time ranging from 9 to 12 days. Ships are turned around in\n12-24  hours.  There  are  no  detailed  data  on  the  cargo  volumes  handled  by  the  port.\nCommercial  cargo  accounts  for  70  percent  of  the  current  total  volume,  and  includes\nhumanitarian aid, business cargo, and used vehicles. Military and peacekeeping cargo is\ndominated by food rations. Under a letter of assistance, Interfet will continue to handle\nUNPKF military cargo until the end of UNPKF\u2019s mandate in East Timor. The current volumes\nexceed the port\u2019s capacity, and over the next two months, the cargo volumes will further\nsurge temporarily as Interfet exports its equipment and hands over the security control to the\nUNPKF.\n25. Two Australian cargo-handling companies operate at Dili Port. Additionally, Interfet\nand aid agencies carry out their own stevedoring. A temporary barge has been attached to\nthe western end of the berth to alleviate  pressure  on  the  berth space.  Interfet  resides\ncurrently in the storage facilities within Dili Port, and is scheduled to vacate these facilities\ngradually by 30 June 2000. By 1 April 2000, Interfet and UNTAET will determine how to\ncontinue the leases for equipment currently leased. The JAM recommends that the UNTAET\ncontinue leases for the 25 ton forklift truck and the temporary barge. The UNTAET could then\nsublease the forklift truck to commercial operators on a cost recovery basis until cargo\nvolumes  have  stabilized.  The  barge  will  provide  additional  space  for  cargo  handling\noperations until the third berth is constructed.", "8\nii. Suai Beach Landing\n26. Because the road network is in poor condition, relief goods are also being unloaded\nfrom barges in Suai. Interfet\u2019s unloading equipment was removed when Interfet departed on\n23 February. However, as humanitarian relief cargo will continue to be unloaded at Suai until\nthe end of 2000, additional cargo-handling equipment is needed in Suai under the Project.\nThis equipment will be under the control of the UNPKF until the planned DTW can assume\nresponsibility for it.\nb. Demand for Port Services\n27. While meaningful trade data are missing, Dili's importance is clear. Most international\ntrade enters East Timor through Dili Port, and the infrastructure in Dili is far more extensive\nthan at any of the other port sites. While beach landing sites are currently used for the delivery\nof military supplies and reconstruction materials, the future demand for port facilities outside of\nDili, Oecusse, and Com is in considerable doubt, and the port revenues are likely to be limited\nto Dili Port. Past trade data demonstrates that most exports are agricultural (coffee) and most\nimports are food and construction materials. The number of trading ships visiting Dili Port\nduring the preconsultation period ranged from 170  to 270 vessels per  year.  The  current\nshortages of commodities, especially rice, suggest considerable volatility in these volumes. No\nformal statistics have been kept on vessel movements through Dili Port since the consultation.\nPast cargo data and a reasonably comprehensive list of the current main movements at the\nPort are summarized in Appendix 6.\ni. UNTAET Cargo\n28. While the UNTAET has not estimated its future cargo volumes, logistics support of the\nUNTAET\u2019s operations will dominate total cargo over the next 2-3 years. Although in the short\nrun the replacement of Interfet with the UNPKF will cause a surge in exported and imported\ncargoes, this is unlikely to affect the volumes on a sustained basis. Force reductions are likely\nto occur in June 2000, with similar reductions taking place every 4-6 months thereafter.\nii. Food and Medical Cargoes\n29. The total shipments of food aid during March-June 2000 are estimated to rise to 50,000\ntons, but thereafter will likely settle to 30,000-40,000 tons per annum. Medical aid cargoes\ncurrently fill 5-10 containers per week, and are likely to continue for the next 2-3 years, and\npossibly longer.\niii. Construction Materials\n30. UNHCR anticipates shipping approximately 500 housing units every two weeks through\nDili Port over the next three months, and an additional 1,000 units through other ports and\nbeaches, each unit with a mass of about 1.5 tons. The International Red Cross will ship 5,500\nhousing units (excluding cement) over the next 12 months, while World Vision will import\n10,000 packs of roof sheltering and timber in the second quarter of this year. Other NGOs have\nsmaller  housing  programs  that  will  also  generate  import  volumes.  The  United  Nations\nChildren's Fund (UNICEF) has building and water programs that generate modest amounts of", "9\nconstruction cargoes, including about 5 containers per month, plus 100-150 cubic meters of\nloose construction materials.\niv. Commercial Cargoes\n31. While it is extremely difficult to estimate commercial imports, the large demand for\nconstruction materials needs to be recognized. Apart from the large influx of vehicles for the\nUNTAET, demand for imported motor vehicles, mostly second hand, has recently surged and\nis estimated at 100-200 vehicles per month, with the likelihood of significant future growth.\nc. Long-Term Subsector Development\n32. ADB-funded TA (footnote 4) will (i) prepare port traffic forecasts; (ii) undertake long-\nterm port subsector planning, including development of a port and maritime master plan and\npreparation  of  related  feasibility  documentation;  (iii)  prepare  an  operational  management\ncontract  for  port  subsector  operations;  (iv)  recommend  modalities  for  service  provision\ncontracts; (v) prepare applications for joining international subsector organizations; (vi) identify\npotential partnership arrangements; (vii) recommend efficient cargo handling services at the\nports;  (viii)  review  needs  related  to  hydrographic  charting,  navigational  aids,  search  and\nrescue, emergency oil spill response, and other maritime safety operations; and (ix) develop\nrecommendations for establishment of a maritime authority.\nd. Port Management and Cost Recovery\n33. Interfet manages the port sector. It will implement minor civil works to facilitate its\noperations. These include demolishing sheds on the western end of the wharf to provide\naccess to a newly developed private gravel-surfaced container yard. Interfet\u2019s tenure in the\nmanagement of the subsector expired on 28 February. Between now and June 2000, Interfet\nwill gradually move out of the port facilities. The UNTAET has appointed a Portuguese-funded\nharbor master who will manage the port in the interim together with the UNTAET port manager\nuntil  a  management  contract  is  in  place.  ADB-funded  TA  (footnote  4)  will  prepare  a\nmanagement  contract  to  facilitate  East  Timorese  management  of  the  subsector  and  to\nestablish a port authority. This management contract will be tendered in April 2000. The\ntendered management contract will be financed from UNTAET\u2019s trust fund and port charges.\n34. ADB is conducting a port pricing study that will prepare a detailed analysis of the\nmarginal costs of the port sector and develop a port tariff for immediate implementation. The\nrecommendations of the study will be available in late March 2000. In the interim, the port\nmanager has developed a set of provisional tariffs based on comparisons with other regional\nports, and a provisional staffing structure for the port. The implications of these for the level of\ncost recovery in the port will be examined and administrative collection mechanisms will be\ndeveloped in detail under ADB\u2019s intervention. The practicalities of implementation have also\nbeen discussed in some detail. The principles governing the  recommendations are  to  (i)\nminimize the risk of facilitation payments and illegal transfer of funds, and (ii) avoid revenue\ncollection hindering vessel and cargo movements.", "10\n3. Energy\na. Subsector Description\n35. East Timor has 57 electricity generating stations. All electricity generation has been\nproduced by diesel engines operating on light diesel fuel. The installed capacity in  the\nstations  ranged  (prior  to  the  postconsultation  destruction)  from  25  kilowatts  (kW)  to\napproximately 16,000 kW. Most of the total generation capacity, approximately 24 megawatts\n(MW), is provided by the two power stations serving Dili. The distribution system consists of\napproximately 700 km of 20 kilovolt lines for transmission, and about 700 km of 230/400 volt\ndistribution lines. The peak demand prior to August 1999 was about 32 MW. The load factor\nfor most generating stations was very low (about 10-20 percent). The system facilities have\nbeen correctly installed, but the maintenance of the stations and network has been of a low\nstandard.\n36. The power system was heavily damaged during the post consultation destruction.\nMost generating station equipment and powerhouse structures were damaged and most of\nthe control panels, fuel systems, and wiring were destroyed by fire. Many auxiliary items,\nsuch as batteries and starter motors, were removed. Of the 57 stations, 21 have been\nreturned to operation under bilateral assistance from the Government of United Kingdom.\nSmaller single- unit stations are now able to produce a high percentage of their installed\ncapacity, while other larger multiple unit stations are reduced to a single-unit operation. The\nComoro station in Dili, serving most of the Dili area load, has been returned to a capacity of\n7-8 MW operation. Although this station was not damaged, poor maintenance has severely\nreduced its reliability and operation. Many regional centers remain without power or receive\nsignificantly reduced supply. Oecusse Enclave of East Timor has had no central generation\nsince the popular consultation.\n37. The distribution network suffered considerable damage to the low-voltage system\nwhen homes and buildings adjacent to the overhead lines were burned. Lack of maintenance\nhas  reduced  the  network's  reliability  significantly.  Most  service  connections  have  been\nburned and many are now hanging free from the distribution lines, presenting a danger to\npeople and preventing the restoration effort. Many of the system transformers were drained\nof insulating fluid. These cannot be returned to service until they are refilled.\nb. Subsector Management\n38. The power subsector suffers from acute shortage of trained personnel at all levels\nand poses a severe difficulty to restoring the proper operation of the electrical system. In\nparticular, there is a lack of experienced operators at all power stations, including linemen,\ndiesel mechanics, and technicians. A shell for an operating utility company has been formed\nin Dili, but does not have experienced management personnel.\n39. Under  a  contract  with  UNDP  funded  from  the  TFET,  Electricity  of  Portugal  will\ndevelop  the  power  sector  institution  and  provide  the  related  managerial  and  technical\ntraining. Under the Project, support will be provided to develop financial management, i.e.,\nbilling and collection systems, financial accounts and recording, audit, financial planning,\nbudgeting, and bookkeeping of the power subsector institution.", "11\n40. In light of ADB\u2019s lead agency role in the sector, support for preparing a long-term\ndevelopment  plan  is  proposed  for  funding  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  program.  This  would  cover\ngeneration expansion, transmission and distribution augmentation, and related action over a\n20-year  time  frame.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  study  will  be  sent  for  the  UNTAET\nendorsement.\nD. External Assistance and Donor Coordination\n41. The  Project  is  fully  coordinated  with  donors  involved  in  the  overall  emergency\nrestoration support for East Timor and in particular with the donors and partners who are\nassisting emergency programs in the three sectors under the Project. These include UNDP\nand the Department for International Development, which implement bilateral labor-based road\nrepair work. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is currently implementing a\nstudy on urgent rehabilitation in East Timor under an agreement with the UNTAET dated 12\nJanuary 2000. The estimated cost of the study is $2.5 million and includes a pilot project for\nroad repair on the Dili-Aileu section. An inception report was prepared in late February and the\nfinal report will be completed in August 2000. The objective of the study is to urgently prepare\nrehabilitation plan for roads, bridges, ports, irrigation, and power in East Timor. The Project is\nprepared so that it can be adjusted to accommodate works under additional funding from\nJapan or other donors, and complementary assistance from JICA would address irrigation and\nbridge rehabilitation.\n42. Electricity of Portugal will implement $1.0 million of TFET funds in the power subsector.\nThis support will focus on developing a power entity, training staff resources, and rehabilitating\n1-2 power stations. The Project will continue the works that have been initiated by programs of\nother donors and are yet to be completed. Appendix 7 lists ongoing projects.\nIV.  THE REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE\nA. Rationale\n43. UNTAET is implementing a program of humanitarian assistance in East Timor. The\nprimary objective of rehabilitating the transport and power infrastructure is to provide the East\nTimorese with access to this humanitarian relief and to facilitate peace and security.\nB. Objectives\n44. The Project  will  (i)  undertake  emergency  road  repair  works  to  facilitate  efficient\ntransport of humanitarian aid and security cargo, and to induce revival of economic activity;\n(ii) expand the capacity of port facilities to reduce congestion as soon as possible; and (iii)\nreinstate power supply. Despite the apparent emergency nature of the Project, in fact the\nProject also supports long-term sector development with civil works, strengthening of the\nlocal  contracting  industry,  instituting  operation  and  maintenance  systems,  and  capacity\nbuilding for sector management.\nC. Scope\n45. The scope of the Project includes the following components:", "12\n(i)  road rehabilitation, including (a) road repair, (b) equipment for road repair\nworks, (c) labor-based road and causeway restoration, and (d) rehabilitation\nand reinstatement of bridges and depot facilities;\n(ii)  port rehabilitation, including (a) wharf extension at Dili Port; (b) restoration of\nthe landing craft slipway at Dili Port; (c) restoration of the container yard at Dili\nPort; (d) provision of beach matting at Beacu, Betano, and Suai; (e) port repairs;\nand (f) equipment for landing of goods;\n(iii) power sector rehabilitation, including (a) rehabilitation of 15 power stations, (b)\nrehabilitation  and  reinstatement  of  distribution  lines,  (c)  restoration  of\ncommunications between Dili and power stations, (d) replacement of destroyed\nComoro  power  station  switchgear,  and  (e)  support  to  financial  sector\nmanagement; and\n(iv)  a project management unit.\nD. Cost Estimates\n46. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $29.8 million. The estimated costs of the\ncomponents are summarized in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 8.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($ million)\nDescription 15 May- 1 Aug- 1 Jan 2001- Total\n31 Jul 31 Dec 15 Dec 2002 Cost\nBase Costs\n1.Emergency Port Rehabilitation 0.66 1.40 0.0 2.06\n2.Emergency Road Rehabilitationa 2.50 3.24 14.81 20.55\n3.Emergency Power Rehabilitation 0.96 1.28 0.53 2.77\n4.Project Management Unit 0.32 0.64 2.10 3.05\nSubtotal A 4.44 6.55 17.43 28.42\nContingenciesb\n1.Physical Contingency 0.12 0.25 0.81 1.18\n2.Price Contingency 0.02 0.03 0.11 0.16\nSubtotal B 0.14 0.28 0.92 1.34\nTotal 4.58 6.83 18.35 29.76\na Physical (15 percent) and price (2 percent) contingencies are included\nb Contingencies exclude physical and price contingencies on the road rehabilitation.\nSource: Staff estimates.\nE. Financing Plan\n47. The  total  cost  of  the  Project  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  TFET.\nContributions to the TFET do not include ADB resources. The Project financing needs to be\nsensitive to the TFET's cash receipts. This has been taken into account in the packaging of\ncontracts.\n48. As reported to the Board on 23 March 2000, the provision of funds to TFET by donors\nhas so far been rather slow. At the present time, there are insufficient funds in TFET to finance", "13\nthe entire Project, although it is anticipated that substantial contributions to TFET will be made\nover the next few months and that funds will become available for the Project in good time for\nimplementation. The Trustee has also confirmed in writing that $7 million is available now. The\nnegotiated Grant Agreement therefore  refers to  this initial amount  of  $7  million  but  also\nanticipates that the  Trustee  will  confirm  from  time  to  time  that  further  amounts  may  be\nwithdrawn as they become available. The Grant Agreement provides that, as and when the\nTrustee confirms such   availability of further amounts,  ADB and  UNTAET  will enter  into\nsupplementary exchanges of letters to record the new amounts. Therefore, although the total\nproject cost is $29.8 million, the initial amount of $7 million to be provided from TFET may not\nbe exceeded without a subsequent written confirmation from the Trustee and a supplementary\nexchange of letters between ADB and UNTAET.\nF. The Executing Agency\n49. The UNTAET will be the recipient of the Grant. It will establish a project management\nunit (PMU) that reports to  the  UNTAET head  of  infrastructure.  The PMU  will  program,\nadminister, and coordinate daily project activities, and will assume the role of an executing\nagency. The PMU will be headed by an East Timorese project manager and comprise an\nEast Timorese project accountant and three subsector engineers. The selection of these will\nbe subject to ADB's approval. The project manager will be supported by internationally\nrecruited consultants: a chief technical adviser and a financial manager, and engineers for\nroads, ports, and electricity, totaling 120 person-months. The chief technical adviser will\nsupport the project manager in administering the Project and its contracts in accordance with\nADB guidelines, and will be accountable to ADB for the quality and timeliness of project\nimplementation.  Engineers  will  program  and  coordinate daily project  activities,  including\ndesign, supervision, procurement of goods and services, and management of civil works\ncontracts. Once established, the DTW will absorb the PMU. The international consultants will\ntrain East Timorese counterparts in their areas of responsibility. The consultant services will\nbe selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. However, the\nterm \"member countries\" under these guidelines for purposes of this Project will include ADB\nmember countries, East Timor, and all donors and members of international organizations\nthat have provided contribution funds to the TFET. The PMU will be funded under the\nProject. An organization chart and terms of reference of the PMU are in Appendix 9. Under\nthe UNTAET's organization framework, the PMU will become the nucleus of the DTW and be\nabsorbed within it. Both the PMU and DTW will report to the head of infrastructure as its\nUNTAET ministerial equivalent.\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Technical Approach\na. Emergency Road Repair\n50. The works under the Project will incorporate labor-intensive employment generating\nmethodologies, where possible. The equipment under the Project will be held at five depots\nand be hired to East Timorese subcontractors to build their capacity to do urgently needed\nroad repairs. Least-cost methodologies have been adopted for the technical solutions under\nthe Project. These include maximum use of local labor, materials, and contractors, and simple\ntechnologies contributing to sustainability of these works.", "14\n51. Five short-term contracts for road repair will be tendered to engage local people in road\nworks on an urgent basis.  Concurrently, five  longer-term  international  contractors  will  be\nselected, one to be based in each regional center: Baucau, Dili, Maliana, Oecusse, and Same.\nEach contractor will (i) reinstate priority lengths of unstable, collapsed, subsided, or eroded\nroad; (ii) restore functional drainage to priority road lengths; (iii) repair local areas of heavily\ndamaged  road  pavement;  (iv)  provide  appropriate  river  crossings  where  essential  to  the\nhumanitarian effort; (v) refurbish regional DTW depots, as required; (vi) develop local road\nrepair capacity by mentoring the selected local subcontractors; and (vii) involve communities in\nthe unskilled road repair activities.\n52. The Project is designed to ensure maximum coordination with ongoing road works and\nto facilitate a coordinated approach to any further works funded by resources additional to the\nTFET. This is possible as each of the five contracts will be responsible for restoring roads in a\nregion, with works focused on prioritized roads. The contractor will switch to other priority road\nsections, when additional support is mobilized.\nb. Emergency Port Restoration\n53. Dili Port suffers from a high level of congestion. To facilitate the delivery of the\nhumanitarian aid and security cargo, Dili Port requires, on an urgent basis, additional wharf\nand cargo handling capacity, and improved management.\n54. Construction of a 48.7 m by 12.1 m extension has been incomplete since 1997 with\nonly the concrete deck and ancillary work needed. The structure comprises steel piles with\nreinforced steel, and longitudinal and transverse reinforced concrete beams. Completing the\nextension will avoid a loss of the earlier investment. A landing site at Dili Port serves barge-\nlanding of goods, and is particularly useful for landing military and humanitarian aid. The\nconcrete landing ramp has deteriorated to a very poor state, with uneven surface, deep\ncavitation, and cracking, and is of limited use. Restoration of the slipway will allow additional\nlanding capacity at all tides at the port. The container storage area at the port is a soft area\n225 m long and 40 m wide. Hardening of the area will improve container management by\nproviding additional maneuvering space, and will alleviate space constraints at the Port. The\nselected engineering solutions represent least-cost actions using local materials to the extent\npossible and local contractors under supervision of a mentoring contractor.\nc. Emergency Power Rehabilitation\n55. Thirty-six generating stations in the rural areas need immediate rehabilitation, ranging\nfrom repair of burn damage to total reconstruction. A detailed specification of requirements and\ndesign work at each station will be carried out as a component of the Project. Least-cost\nmethodologies will be adopted. The specifications will include portable generating sets to\nenable rehabilitation. After restoring the original generating units, the portable sets will be\nmoved to other sites and the process repeated.\n56. At present there is no communication between the power utility headquarters in Dili and\nthe rest of the system. The Project will install a system of radios and repeater stations to allow\nfor communication from the Dili utility to the outlying stations and vehicles.", "15\n57. The power  sector also  lacks basic  tools and  equipment  for  rehabilitation  of  the\ndistribution system and restoration of the services. No instruments are available to measure\nvoltage or current in the circuits. While most of the network overhead conductors are sound,\nsome spans need replacement. Service connections have also been damaged. Many of\nthese need replacement as customers are reconnected to the system.  The  Project  will\ninclude  providing  multimeters  and  other  basic  equipment,  and  overhead  and  service\nconductors; rehabilitating distribution circuits; and providing related training.\n58. The Project will support development of financial management capabilities in the\nfuture power entity, to ensure that the people involved understand the need for cost recovery.\nCurrently, power supply is mismanaged because it is  supplied free to only  a  very few\nconsumers.\n2. Steering Committee\n59. The UNTAET will establish, with the support of the TA 3401 (footnote 4), a steering\ncommittee  for  the  Project  to  involve  broader  stakeholder  representation  in  project\nimplementation. The steering committee will be convened prior to the approval of the Project\nto inform the stakeholders of the project activities. The steering committee will then meet\nmonthly to discuss and resolve emerging issues in project implementation, procurement, and\ncommunity employment, and to review and comment on the project reports for submission to\nADB.\n3. Procurement of Goods and Services\n60. All  procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement used for loan financed projects (footnote 3). The proceeds of the\nProject will finance imports of goods and services, local purchases, and civil works identified\nunder the Project. Under ADB's Guidelines for Procurement, these may be procured through\ndirect purchase, or through international shopping, local competitive bidding, or international\ncompetitive bidding, as appropriate. Five short-term civil works contracts will be tendered\nusing international shopping procedures to ensure expedited restoration of infrastructure.\nThese will engage local labor. Thereafter, five long-term civil works contracts will be tendered\nusing international competitive bidding procedures.\n4. Implementation Schedule\n61. The project implementation period is 24 months, commencing in May 2000. Every\nquarter, the  PMU  will  prepare a detailed  implementation  schedule for  project  activities.\nProject implementation consultants will be selected as soon as the Project is approved and\nthe  grant  effective.  Small  labor-intensive  works  contracts,  preparation  of  designs,\nprequalification of contractors, and tendering of international competitive bidding contracts\nwill commence upon project approval and grant effectiveness. Port rehabilitation, road works,\nand rehabilitation of power stations will start from June 2000. The Project activities will be\ncompleted by December 2001. A technical review of the Project will be conducted jointly by\nADB and the UNTAET one year after project approval. The Project implementation schedule\nis shown in Appendix 10.", "16\n5. Rights-of-Way\n62. Most works under the Project are within existing rights-of-way. The UNTAET will, if\nneeded, acquire or obtain rights to any land required on a timely basis in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Policy on Resettlement and Compensation and provide compensation (including for\ncrops), as required, in accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant guidelines. Detailed designs will\nminimize land acquisition.\n6. Disbursement Procedures\n63. As agreed with IDA, disbursements for eligible expenditures will be made pursuant to\nADB\u2019s Disbursement Guidelines set out in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, 1996 and\nmay be made as direct payment or reimbursement, or through an imprest account. The\nimprest account will be replenished in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on Imprest Fund\nand Statement of Expenditures Procedures. The chief technical adviser will be responsible\nfor transactions, replenishments, and use of the imprest account. Payments under these\nagreements will be made by IDA based on ADB\u2019s request.\na. Direct Payment\n64. Under the direct purchase procedure, the PMU will request ADB for a direct payment\nto be made to the supplier of goods and services. ADB will authorize the request and send it\nto IDA, which will pay the supplier directly. Payment will be requested using ADB\u2019s standard\nwithdrawal application. The PMU will indicate in the withdrawal application the date on which\npayment becomes due to the supplier. A separate application should be filled out for each\ncurrency in  which the  payment  is  requested.  The  application  should  be  submitted  with\nsupporting documents such as contracts, invoices, receipts, and vouchers. This procedure\nwill be used for payment of (i) consultants' fees, (ii) equipment, and (iii) civil works contracts\nawarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Copies of signed contracts will be\nforwarded to ADB as early as possible to facilitate timely payments.\nb. Reimbursement Procedures\n65. The reimbursement procedure will be used when eligible expenditures are paid from\nthe UNTAET\u2019s budget and reimbursement claimed through ADB from the TFET. Withdrawal\napplications  with  supporting  documents  and  summary  sheets  of  expenditures  will  be\nprepared by the PMU, and payments will be made to the UNTAET by IDA based on ADB's\nauthorization. The reimbursement procedure will be used for payment of (i) small purchases,\nand (ii) short-term civil works contracts.\nc. Imprest Fund\n66. Under the imprest account fund procedure, ADB will request IDA to advance funds to\nthe  PMU  to  meet  subproject  expenditures  to  prefinance  payments  to  contractors  and\nsuppliers. The imprest account will be used for short-term civil works, small-scale design and\nsupervision services, remuneration of East  Timorese project  staff,  and  small  purchases\nunder all cost categories eligible for financing. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedure will\nbe used for reimbursement of expenditures and for the liquidation of the imprest account for\npayments with value equal to or below $50,000 each. The currency of the imprest account", "17\nwill be the United States dollar and the maximum initial advance will be $500,000. The chief\ntechnical adviser supported by the PMU will be responsible for administrative and accounting\ntasks under the Project and will establish adequate internal control, accounting, and auditing\nprocedures to ensure efficient use of the imprest account and its operation. The imprest\naccount will be established in Darwin, Australia.\n7. Reporting\n67. The UNTAET with the support of the PMU will furnish ADB with quarterly progress\nreports concerning all aspects, including finances, procurement of services, equipment, and\nall civil works in the Project. The PMU will prepare quarterly expenditure budgets a month\nprior to the commencement of the following quarter. The UNTAET, with the support of the\nPMU, will also provide quarterly reports on the use of the recurrent UNTAET road, port, and\npower budget, including activities and expenditures; and report progress in implementing\npolicy initiatives, transport policy and regulations, and organizational changes. The PMU will\nalso prepare a final project completion report on all aspects of the Project in accordance with\nADB's relevant guidelines.\n8. Accounts\n68. The PMU will establish the necessary accounts in Dili, if possible, and in Darwin,\nAustralia, if required. These bank accounts will be under the control of the chief technical\nadviser. The PMU will establish and maintain separate accounts for all expenditures under the\nProject, including its individual contracts and other project components. The PMU will furnish\nADB with accounts and related financial statements reflecting the accounts for each project-\nrelated  contract.  These  financial  statements  will  be  audited  using  generally  accepted\naccounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited financial statements together\nwith the auditor\u2019s report will be forwarded to ADB within six months of the end of each related\nfiscal year. The PMU consultants will keep detailed records on the costing and expenditures of\nthe project components and will assist with reporting.\n9. Technical Midterm Review\n69. In addition to a schedule of regular reviews to monitor the progress of the Project, a\ntechnical review of the Project will be carried out one year after mobilization. The focus of the\nreview is to determine the need for any deviations from the project design or implementation.\nThe review will also assess adequacy of funds, cost overruns, need for reallocations, and\nother factors, if any, including assumptions and risks, that might constrain the satisfactory\nimplementation of the Project and achievement of development objectives.\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environmental Impact of the Project\n70. The Project has been classified as environmental category B. Accordingly, an initial\nenvironmental examination is in Appendix 11. The potential environmental impacts of the\nProject are related to construction activities, and are limited, temporary, and reversible. The\nmedium- and long-term impact of the Project is positive, especially in promoting economic\nand social development of East Timor and facilitating its reconstruction and development. A\ndetailed environmental impact assessment is not needed.", "18\n71. Under  the  UNTAET\u2019s  transitional  administration,  Indonesian  environmental  laws\nremain valid. The capacity to review and evaluate environmental impacts of infrastructure\nprojects and to monitor implementation of the mitigating measures needs to be developed\nwithin  the  UNTAET.  There  is  also  a  need  to  review  the  applicability  of  the  prevailing\nenvironmental management laws, regulations, and standards to the East Timorese social,\nlegal,  and  institutional  context.  In  the  light  of  ADB\u2019s  lead  agency  role  in  infrastructure\nrestoration, ADB will assist in development of institutional and human resource capacity to\naddress environmental and natural resources management in infrastructure projects. The\nProject  will  be  used  to  train  PMU  counterparts  to  become  familiar  with  environmental\nmitigation activities during construction.\n2. Social Assessment\n72. The Project will restore the transport and power sector assets and supply. This is\nexpected  to  have  a  significant  positive  social  impact.  An  initial  social  assessment  is  in\nAppendix 12. The Project will not involve any relocation or resettlement. The beneficiary\nconsultations confirm widespread support for the Project. The Project will improve the quality of\nlife. All people will benefit from the more reliable flow of goods, fuel, health care services,\nfood, and access to reviving markets. The Project  will  generate  significant employment\namong the people, most of whom are returning refugees who have lost their property and\nlivelihoods. Civil works under the Project are designed to maximize the use of labor.\n73. In the next 10 months, the road and port rehabilitation will facilitate the movement of\nfood and agricultural supply to poverty-stricken and starvation-threatened areas. And since\npower is used in a number of labor-intensive industries and services, particularly in Dili and\nother urban centers, its restoration will facilitate basic services such as water and hospital\nfacilities returning to normal.\nV. APPROVAL\n74. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision  and  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  to  the  United  Nations  Transitional\nAdministration in East Timor, in an amount not exceeding $29,800,000 and subject to the\nprocedures described in paragraph 48, to be financed by the Trust Fund for East Timor on a\ngrant basis, for the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project, and hereby reports such\naction to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\nPRESIDENT\n13 April 2000", "19\nAPPENDIXES\nNo. Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 Project Framework 20 1, 1\n2 UNTAET Organization Chart 23 2, 4\n3 Road Lengths, Pavement Types and Standards, and\nRoad Conditions, 1999 24 5, 15\n4 Present Road Conditions 26 5, 18\n5 Proposed Structure of the Planned Department of\nTransport and Works 30 6, 21\n6 Cargo Volumes in 1990 and Current Main Movements\nin Dili Port 33 8, 27\n7 Ongoing Assistance to Roads, Ports, and Power\nSectors 35 11, 42\n8 Detailed Cost Estimates 36 12, 46\n9 Outline Terms of Reference for Support to the East\nTimor Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation 37 13, 49\n10 Project Implementation Schedule 50 15, 61\n11 Summary Initial Environmental Examination 51 17, 70\n12 Initial Social Assessment 55 17, 72", "20 Appendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nProject Monitoring\nDesign Summary Targets Mechanism Risk/Assumptions\nSector Goal\nEnable transport and 1.

Road Inventory\n1. The road network is classified according to the Indonesian system as shown in Table\nA4.1.\nTable A4.1: Road Classification\nClass Purpose Design Standard\nNational Interprovincial roads connecting Carriageway: 5-7.5m,\ncities, agro/industrial centers and Shoulders: 1-2m depending on traffic \ncenters of tourism. volume and terrain.\nPavement type: hot-laid asphalt\nProvincial Connecting principal district centers Carriageway: 3.5-4.5m\nwith the provincial capital.

The original alignment for most of the national and provincial road network dates from\nthe Portuguese occupation, and was generally winding, narrow, and unpaved. Indonesian policy\nwas to upgrade the networks to the above specifications, but problems with mountain-slope\ninstabilities resulted in many roads being narrower that the specified standard. A road inventory\n(Appendix 3) indicates that the network consisted of 496 kilometers (km) of national roads,\n1,001.5 km of provincial roads, and 4,214.9 km of district roads. A road condition assessment\nconducted in December 1997 is in Table A4.2.\nTable A4.2: 1997 Road Condition Survey\nAssessed Condition\nRoad Class Good Fair Poor\nNational 130.67 0 0\nProvincial 181.40 211.84 39.11\nDistrict 91.85 21.60 8.73\nFeeder 0 64.31 27.52\n2.

Extent of Defects\n4. A visual condition assessment that estimates the distance between defects of the same\ntype was conducted on sample roads (Table A4.4). These were augmented with interviews with\nkey road users in Ambino enclave.\nTable A4.4: Visual Road Condition Assessment\nSample Route Name\n1 Dili-Aileu-Maubisse-Same-Ainaro-Zumalai North-south route 2: Combination\nof provincial and district roads\n2 Zumalai-Suai-Zumalai South coast road\n3 Zumalai-Maliana-Balibo North-south route 1: district road\n4 Balibo-Atabae-Maubara-Dili North coast road\n5 Oecusse-Citrana-Oecusse Ambino enclave coastal road (W)\n6 Citrana-Tumin-Pune Ambino district roads\n7 Citrana-Baqui-Nenopen Ambino district roads\n8 Citrana-Passabe Ambino district roads\n5. Drainage-based defects were noted on the north-south (route 1) at about 1 km intervals,\nand this represented the highest observed level of distress. The south coast road (Route 2) was\nmostly paved and in good condition, except for major river crossings. The bridge over the Cassa\nRiver is a large steel truss with a reinforced in-situ concrete deck over steel beams. The truss\nfor the center span has not been assembled, although the major components are presumably all\non site. The deck for another span was under construction when work stopped. At present,\nvehicles ford the river, but this is a difficult and potentially dangerous, and only made possible\nby the assistance of local people who indicate the shallowest route.\n6. A second river crossing on the south coast road, over the Mota River (Zumalai), was\nalso temporarily impassable due to scour at the back of an abutment. The problem has since\nbeen fixed temporarily, but illustrates the risk of using causeways to reduce the length of\nbridging wide braided rivers. Such a strategy is only sustainable in conjunction with dry season\nriverbed management to reposition sand banks and boulder reefs. This is necessary every year\nand is best regarded as a routine maintenance activity.\n7. The Oecusse Coastal Road West (Route 5), ends after about 7 km at a wide river ford.\nThe road pavement is constructed from a naturally occurring mix of bitumen and crushed\nlimestone known locally as Ashburton. This material was specified exclusively for district roads\nand was the lightest form of pavement constructed during the Indonesian administration. It is\nunsuited to the heavy traffic generated by military and aid vehicles. As a result, although the\nroad is on the flat coastal plain and has therefore suffered little or no damage to the road\nformation, the pavement is failing and the surface heavily potholed.", "29 Appendix 4, page 4\n8. At  present,  aid  agencies  are  unable  to  access  the  interior  of  Ambino  due  to  the\nextremely poor condition of the district and feeder road networks, and all support is provided by\nair. The military has had to declare the worst of the roads as one-way, due to the loss of road\nwidth.\n9. Other issues relevant to the strategy for the Ambino interior road network are as follows:\n(i)  About 40,000 East Timorese need support because their subsistence agriculture\nwas disrupted and of the rural administration collapsed.\n(ii)  The road network has probably always been in relatively poor condition, but the\ncessation of regular maintenance has dramatically worsened the situation.\n(iii)  Much of the work needed on this network will involve reconstruction. However,\nmaintenance  is  still  necessary  to  preserve  even  limited  road  access  to  the\naffected  areas,  pending  a  formal  engineering  evaluation  to  determine  the\noptimum reinstatement strategy.\n(iv)  Access  to  the  interior of Ambino  is  limited during  the  rainy  season by four\nimpassable river crossings. Two of these crossings have wide, braided beds with\nunstable meandering watercourses that make them unsuitable for low or even\nmedium cost bridging, and pipe causeways are proposed. The riverbeds contain\nall required aggregates, and the method of construction will be labor-intensive,\naffording much needed employment to the area around Oecusse. The other two\ncrossings are much narrower and more stable, making both sites suitable for\nsteel  truss  bridging.  Bailey  Bridges  or  similar  constructions  are  proposed,\npending a more detailed appraisal of the two sites by the implementation team,\nonce the river levels fall sufficiently to permit safe crossing.\n(v)  The results of the interviews and drive-through condition assessments is in Table\nA4.5.\nTable A4.5: Oecusse-Ambino Enclave Road Conditions\nSample Bank Bench Pavement Surface Drainage\nRoad Slips Slips Subsidence Failure Failure Failure\n1 Poor Bad Poor Poor Poor Bad\n2 Bad Bad Poor Poor Poor Bad\n3 Fair Fair Poor Poor Bad Bad\n4 Poor Poor Fair Poor Fair Bad\n5 Fair Fair Fair Bad Bad Bad\n6 Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad\n7 Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad\n8 Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad", "30 Appendix 5, page 1\nPROPOSED STRUCTURE OF THE\nPLANNED DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT AND WORKS\n1. Establishment of a maintenance regime is proposed through a central department of\ntransport and works (DTW). The roads will need to be reclassified, and the DTW structure\nwill manage all the roads, given the small size of the network. The proposed administrative\nstructure aims to ensure development of a road management and maintenance system that\nestablishes local capacity to manage, and improve the road assets to facilitate transport\nand economic development and growth. The principles guiding establishment of the DTW\nwill include (i) establishment of a private sector contracting industry, (ii) development of a\nroad  maintenance  culture  in  the  DTW  and  the  communities,  (iii)  use  of  local  human\nresources, and (iv) encouragement of competition. The DTW is to be headquartered in Dili\nand to have four major divisions: (i) a transport division, to assume regulatory and policy\nresponsibilities for roads; (ii) a planning and design division; (iii) an operations division, and\n(iv) a finance division. Consultant support to the United Nations Transitional Administration\nin East Timor (UNTAET) is proposed in detail to initiate establishment of the DTW. In the\nfirst year, 115 staff will be required, including 21 foreign staff. The number of foreign staff is\nproposed  to  be  reduced  gradually  to  10  in  the  third  year  as  technology  transfer  is\nincorporated in the incentives under the incumbents\u2019 contracts. All international positions will\nbe in partnership with an East Timorese counterpart. The organizational structure of the\nDTW is to include four major functions: transport, planning and design, operations, and\nfinance.\n(i) The transport division will cover three areas:\n(a) Land transport regulation activities will include\n(i) reclassifying roads;\n(ii) reviewing,  revising,  and  adjusting  the  road  sector  legal\nframework, including a road safety program, to directly cater to\nthe needs of East Timor road users;\n(iii) establishing and implementing road  transport  regulations  in\ncollaboration with the police; and\n(iv) supporting  the  central  UNTAET  in  preparing  procurement\nguidelines  for  works  and  supplies  contracts;  these  are\nproposed to adhere to the principles of economic efficiency\nfrom  competition  and  establishment  of  a  local  contracting\nindustry.\n(b) Maritime and port sector regulation activities will include\n(i) implementing international conventions, and\n(ii) managing contracts; and", "31 Appendix 5, page 2\n(c) Aviation sector regulation activities will include\n(i) implementing international conventions, and\n(ii) managing contracts.\n(ii) The planning and design division's activities will include\n(a) management of feasibility studies for capital investment projects, and\ntechnical evaluation of international tenders;\n(b) contract management;\n(c) relations with external financiers; and\n(d) development of a road asset management system.\n(iii) The  operations  division  will  have  five  regional  centers:  Baucau,  Dili,\nMaliana,  Oecusse,  and  Same.  It  will  carry  out  routine  and  periodic\nmaintenance, and manage works through (a) minor labor-based contracts to\nthe communities to maintain community minor roads (district roads), and (b)\nspecific maintenance and periodic maintenance contracts to organized labor.\n(iv) The finance division will prepare budget requests, budget allocation, and\nreports on disbursements and payments to the national administration.\n2. The DTW\u2019s regional centers will be staffed by an international chief road and bridge\nengineer, the chief engineer, an accountant, and a few clerical staff. To the extent possible,\nthe positions will be filled with East Timorese who have the appropriate skills. The DTW\nstructure includes no labor contingent. Small labor groups are expected to be provided\nthrough contractors that were operational during the previous administration in the sector\nand have received some experience during the first months\u2019 emergency works proposed\nunder the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s short-term road sector assessment.\nWhile  skill  levels  will  vary  from  region  to  region,  technical  and  supervisory  skills  are\nexpected  to  be  available.  The  chief  engineers  will  identify  these  skills  and  prepare  a\ntechnical on-the-job training program to build a local contracting industry. Private sector\npractices  will  be  encouraged  by,  for  example,  leasing  the  plant  pool  to  local  groups\norganized for undertaking the works.\n3. The  regional  centers  will  monitor  and  record  road  conditions,  establishing,  in\ncollaboration with the headquarters, a road asset management system. This will provide the\nbasis for prioritizing road rehabilitation requirements and maintenance works schedules.\nThrough the asset management system, the DTW will establish a road maintenance regime\ncapable of carrying out works in the immediate future based on preventive maintenance\nplanning in the long term and continued monitoring of the road conditions.\n4. A minimum road maintenance plant is proposed to establish a maintenance function\nand carry out routine and periodic maintenance activities. These activities will be transferred\nto the private sector as soon as the private sector operators have achieved the necessary", "32 Appendix 5, page 3\ncapacity. This capacity building will be supported by the DTW\u2019s operational centers through\ntraining, small contracts, monitoring of the works' standards, and leasing of equipment. Staff\nin the centers will determine, case by case, the requirements for such a support program.\nFigure A5: Organization of the Department of Transport and Works\nSecretary -1 (1)\nDirector-1 (1) Director -1 (1) Director - 1 (1) Director 1 (1)\nTransport Planning and Design Operations Finance\nLand Transport Regulation 3 (3) Design - 2 (2) Dili Accountants 2 (2)\nAviation Sector Regulation - 1 (1) Major Projects - 2 (2) Baucau\nPorts Sector Regulation - 1 (1) Laboratory 1 (2) Maliana\nAsset Management System 1 (1) Oecusse\nSame\nDepot Chief (Engineer)1 (1)\nTotal Depot Staff 16\nRoad Engineer 1\nBridge Engineer 1\nAccountant 1\nSurveyors 3\nSupervisors 2\nMechanic 2\nOperator Trainers 3\nAdministrative Assistant 1\nNote: Numbers outside of parenthesis reflect year 1 requirement for international staff and those within\nparenthesis domestic staff.

Project Management Unit\n1. Specialists engaged under this consultancy will guide the management of a project\nto assist East Timor's recuperation by addressing emergency needs for repairing road, port,\nand  energy  facilities.  The  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor\n(UNTAET) will award road repair contracts with funding arranged by the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) from the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET) and the consultants will administer\nthe contracts to facilitate the establishment of regional road maintenance organizations.\nSpecific responsibilities are as follows:\n(i)   The UNTAET infrastructure section will open appropriate trust accounts to\nreceive project funds.\n(ii)   The UNTAET has awarded a number of short-term emergency road contracts\nthat effectively divide the road network into five operational areas. These\nareas are generally based on the regional centers proposed by the joint\nassessment mission (main text, para. 5). The works under the Project have\nbeen  organized  to  coincide  with  this  regional  arrangement  and  the\nrecommended regional centers will be used to administer project road works.\n(iii)   The UNTAET, in collaboration with ADB, will engage appropriately-qualified\ndomestic staff for the Project as follows: (a) a project manager who will be\ncounterpart  to  the  chief  roads  engineer;  (b)  a  project  accountant,  as\ncounterpart to a financial adviser (international consultant); and (c) three\nengineers as counterparts to international road, port, and power engineers.\n(iv)   International contractors will be engaged to undertake priority maintenance\nworks in each region.\n(v)   Once the international contractors have established their regional centers,\nthe  UNTAET,  in  collaboration  with  ADB's  technical  assistance  (TA)  for\ntransport restoration1 and the Project, will identify and engage the following\nappropriately qualified field staff for the Project: (a) 5 regional engineers to\nbe assigned  to  the  regional  centers  as  road  administrators;  (b)  10  road\nsupervisors, 2 assigned to each regional administration; (c) 10 clerical staff, 2\nassigned  to  each  regional  administration;  and  (d)  15  camp\nwatchmen/cleaners, 3 assigned to each regional administration. These will\nbe funded from the UNTAET\u2019s trust fund.\n(vi)   The international contractors will work to budgets set by network managers\nfor  road  repairs  and  emergency  power  rehabilitation.  ADB  funds  will  be\ndisbursed to the international contractors on the production of appropriate\nmeasurement certificates.\n                                               \n1  TA 3401-ETM: Transport Sector Restoration, for $1,000,000, approved on 10 February 2000.", "38 Appendix 9, page 2\n(vii)   Repair  works  and  power  station  rehabilitation  will  focus  on  priorities\ndetermined by network managers.\n(viii)   During months 1-12 of the contract, international contractors will take specific\nresponsibility  for  emergency  maintenance  repairs,  most  notably  the  road\nbench and drainage systems, and construction of specified river crossings.\nAt the same time they will engage and train  domestic  subcontractors  to\nundertake skilled routine and emergency maintenance, and will engage rural\ncommunity  labor  to  carry  out  unskilled  maintenance  on  their  local  road\nsections.\n(ix)   During  months  13-18,  the  international  contractors  will  carry  out  limited\nemergency periodic maintenance, while continuing to guide and train their\ndomestic subcontractors.\n(x)   During  months  18-24,  the  international  contractors  will  progressively\ndemobilize, leaving the domestic contractors to continue routine maintenance\nunder the supervision of the local road administration. The key function of the\ninternational  contractors  in  this  phase  is  to  serve  as  a  conduit  for  the\ndisbursement of funds for the ongoing routine and emergency maintenance.\n(xi)   Where a single domestic contractor has the potential capacity to carry out all\nthe  tasks  listed  in  para.  1(xiii),  one  such  subcontractor  may  suffice.\nAlternatively,  where  prospective  subcontractors  have  little  or  no  relevant\nequipment  or  experience,  it  may  be  preferable  to  engage  several\nsubcontractors to specialize in one or more of the various repair skills. The\nProject will procure specialist equipment to assist such contractors.\n(xii)   After training, the local subcontractors are expected to be capable of carrying\nout all normal maintenance repairs, including (a) selecting and preparing\nsuitable materials for the repair activities, including small crusher operations;\n(b) patching with hot and cold asphalt, including the use of small spot mixers;\n(c) completing concrete works; (d) laying culverts; (e) installing drainage; (f)\ncompleting stone pitching; (g) constructing gabion retaining walls; and (h)\nengaging, organizing, and supervising local community labor to carry out\nunskilled and labor-intensive routine maintenance.\n2. A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  implement  the  Project  by  assuming  the\nresponsibilities of an executing agency. The PMU will be led by an East Timorese project\nmanager, and comprise an East Timorese accountant and three East Timorese engineers\n(one each for roads, ports, and power subsectors). International consultant services are\nrequired to support project implementation and to strengthen the PMU. Five individually\nappointed international consultants will provide these services through the positions of (a) a\nchief  technical  adviser,  (b)  a  financial  adviser,  and  (c)  three  engineers  for  the  three\nsubsectors under the Project. The chief technical adviser will assume responsibility for the\nproject implementation and reporting to ADB, the project funds, and the Project's imprest\naccount.", "39 Appendix 9, page 3\n3. The  PMU  will  report  to  the  head  of  infrastructure  within  the  UNTAET.  Project\nmonitoring will be strengthened by a steering committee comprising senior representatives\nof project stakeholder organizations in both the public and private sectors. The steering\ncommittee will be established by the TA for transport restoration (footnote 1). The PMU will\nfully coordinate its activities with the recommendations and activities of the TA. The PMU\nwill implement the sector management recommendations of the TA using the Project as a\ntraining opportunity to streamline new functions of the department of transport and works\n(DTW), which is to be organized through the TA.\n4. The  UNTAET  will  appoint  staff  needed  to  provide  a  minimum  monitoring  and\nsupervision capacity at each of five regional works centers as proposed under the Project.\nThe centers will be funded from UNTAET's trust fund. UNTAET will identify and engage, in\ncollaboration with the Project, personnel with previous relevant experience in the  road\nmaintenance, power, and ports administrations.\n5. The  PMU  will  prepare  terms  of  reference  for,  engage,  and  manage  the  East\nTimorese staff under the PMU, provide terms of reference for supervision contracts, prepare\ndesigns, conduct tender process, manage project disbursements, report on the  all  the\nproject  activities  to  ADB  and  UNTAET,  and  specifically  be  responsible  (albeit  not\nexclusively) for the following:\n(i)   Ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines,\nthese  terms  of  reference,  and  the  laws  of  East  Timor  and  UNTAET\nregulations,  excercising  efficient,  effective,  and  economic  implementation\nmethodologies.\n(ii)   In the road subsector, assure the serviceability of key sections of the road\nnetwork by quickly implementing road repairs and establishing a sustainable\nand systematic road maintenance operation in the project areas.\n(iii)   In the port subsector, improve and maintain port facilities so that the value of\nthe existing assets is preserved and congestion reduced particularly in areas\ncritical to the delivery of humanitarian assistance and other goods.\n(iv)   In  the  power  subsector,  rehabilitate  power  supply  facilities,  ensure  safe\npower distribution, and thereby enable restoration of power supply in the\nservice areas of the 15 power stations selected for the Project.\n(v)   Open a project imprest account to facilitate disbursement of project funds in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines on disbursement\n(vi)   Identify and engage appropriately qualified local staff for the Project. The\nstaff are described in para. 1(iii).\n(vii)   Administer  the  preparation  of  tender  documents  and  conduct  the  tender\nprocess for all contracts for civil works, equipment, and consultant services\nunder the Project, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nAdminister, implement, and monitor international and local contracts for civil\nworks, equipment, and consultant services under the Project.", "40 Appendix 9, page 4\n(viii)   Engage, manage, and train appropriately-qualified staff of the DTW under\nUNTAET recurrent funding.

Introduction\n1. The project\u2019s environmental impact is classified as category B by the Asian Development\nBank  (ADB),  a  project  whose  potential  impacts  could  be  mitigated  using  established\nprocedures. An ADB environment specialist visited the project sites. Although the Indonesian\nenvironmental  laws and  regulations  remain  in  effect  in West  Timor,  the  enforcement  and\nimplementation  capacity  does  not  exist.  The  environmental  management  authorities  were\nmanaged primarily by Indonesian civil servants, who are unlikely to return.\nB.  Description of the Project\n2. The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) is executing a\nprogram of humanitarian assistance in East Timor. The primary objective of the transport and\npower infrastructure is to provide access to this humanitarian relief. In its current significantly\ndeteriorated state, the transport sectors are not able to facilitate humanitarian efforts or help\nensure the security of the country. The roads have become interrupted in many locations and\ncan carry only very small loads. Humanitarian supply and military vehicles have been lost in the\nriver  crossings  and  a  life  was  lost  on  steep  and  weak  embankment.  Humanitarian  food\ndeliveries are made by flight at the cost of $1,000 per ton. Dili Port has become a bottleneck. Its\ncapacity is extremely limited, evidenced by long queues, at their extreme exceeding a month.\n3. Transport and power infrastructure are essential to the revival of economic activity in\nEast Timor. Only through revival of the economy and employment can social security and food\nstability be achieved. The Project aims to ensure that the infrastructure can meet these goals. It\nwill incorporate employment-generating methodologies that contribute to poverty reduction and\nnormalization of conditions in East Timor. The Project will (i) undertake emergency road repair\nworks to facilitate efficient transport of humanitarian aid and security cargo, and to induce revival\nof economic activity; (ii) expand the capacity of port facilities to reduce congestion; and (iii)\nreinstate  power  supply.  The  scope  of  the  Project  includes  (i)  road  rehabilitation,  (ii)  port\nrehabilitation, (iii) power sector rehabilitation, and (iv) establishment of a project management unit.\nC.  Description of the Environment\n1. Physical Environment\n4. East Timor is eastern half of Timor Island. East Timor has a contiguous area of 19,000\nsquare kilometers (km2), with additional 2,461 km2 in the Oecusse-Ambino enclave inside West\nTimor.  East Timor is the largest and eastern most of the Lesser Sunda Archipelago. The\nclimate is tropical. The rainy season starts in December and ends in April although the dry and\nwet seasons are not well defined.\n5. The island is along the junction of the Australian and the Asian geological plates. Thus, it\nis subject to frequent earthquakes. The rock formations are primarily sedimentary karst uplifted\nby the collision of the two plates. As the formation is quite recent, the karst is highly fractured\nand crumbles easily. Metamorphic rock from past volcanic activity is limited to northern and\ncentral sections of the island. The high erosion rates from the crumbling karst layers have\nresulted in the formation of alluvial plains and isolated fertile valleys. The river systems are\nshort,  running almost perpendicular  to  the  coastline.  The  rivers  cut  deep  ravines  into  the\nunstable rock, forming deep canyons in the highlands and abruptly widening as they reach the", "52 Appendix 11, page 2\nflat alluvial plains. Often the rivers narrow as they approache the sea because of obstruction by\nsandbars and intertidal deposits.\n2. Biological Environment\n6. Timor is on the western side of the Wallacia line. The flora and fauna are similar to that\nof the tropical Australia-Pacific group. Timor has no large animals, but many small mammals,\nsuch as deer, and brightly colored birds. Timor was one of the first islands settled by Europeans\nbecause of its proximity to the Spice Islands. A number of domesticated and feral animals have\nbeen introduced to the islands, such as horses, cattle, chicken, and pigs. During the last 10\nyears, the deforestation was officially estimated at 70,000 hectares, with the unofficial estimate\ndouble this level. The central highlands are cultivated with coffee, mainly the robusta variety.\nEast Timor coffee commands a high price in the world market because of its higher-than-normal\nalkaline properties. Rice, corn, sorghum, beans, and root crops are grown in the lowlands.\nSlash-and-burn agriculture is common even on the steep hillsides.\n3. Sociocultural Environment\n7. Most of the population is concentrated in the northern coastal towns and in fertile river\nvalleys in the interior. The coastal flat lands in the south are sparsely populated because of the\nharsh  mountain  terrain  that  divides  the  island.  Sea  travel  from  the  north  to  the  south  is\nconstrained by strong waves most of the year. The economy is based on agriculture, with coffee\nthe major export crop. Surplus rice, corn, and other agricultural produce are consumed within\nthe island.  The poor road and port facilities discourage exporting although the potential is high,\nespecially from the flat plains in the south. There is little industry or manufacturing. A number of\nmineral deposits have been identified, but their commercial potential has not been explored.\nThe service industry was, during the Indonesian period, limited to the civil service and state-\nowned corporations, such as telecommunications, power, and oil and gas distribution. Trading\nand other commercial activities were limited to traditional market places in small settlements.\nBanks, restaurants, hotels, and other businesses were mostly found in the two large urban\ncenters:  Dili  and  Baucau.  Most  of  the  formal  businesses  were  burned  down  during  the\npostconsultation destruction.\n8. Almost 70 percent of the schools were destroyed during the postconsultation violence.\nAt present, classes are conducted in open yards and roofless buildings.\n9. Tetum is the local language, with Bhasa Indonesia and Portuguese spoken by sizeable\nportions of the population. Almost 95 percent of the population are Roman Catholics, with a\nsmall Muslim and Protestant population.\nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigating Measures\n1. Physical Environment\n10. Road Works. The main impact of the emergency road project is quarrying for rock and\nsand. However, the quarry sites are small and scattered along the road with alignments close to\nriver systems. In most instances, less than a 100 cubic meters of sand and rock will be required\nfrom a particular quarry site. Most of the road erosion is caused by poor drainage design, lack of\nmaintenance, and impact of heavy loads. Silt from drainage cleaning will be used to fill quarry\nsites, especially those beyond rivers. Farmers who want some landfill will be allowed access to\nthe silt. When constructing the drainage lines, careful attention will be paid to directing the flow", "53 Appendix 11, page 3\nof the water as close as possible to the normal drainage channel and away from farmlands and\nother road sections that could be eroded.\n11. Port Works: The impact of the emergency port project is limited to normal noise and\nincreases in seawater turbidity related to the construction activity. Those effects are temporary\nand reversible. Oil pollution from ballast discharge and maintenance of ship engines may have\nlonger  term  impacts  on  the  environment.  Oil  slicks  were  noted  in  the  harbor.  Effective\nsurveillance of the berthed ships is an important component of the environmental monitoring\ncapacity  of  the  port  authorities,  and  will  be  developed  under  the  ADB-funded  technical\nassistance (TA) 3401, the Transport Sector Restoration Project. Improved port environmental\nmanagement is expected to improve the environmental conditions even with an increase in ship\ntraffic.\n12. Power Subproject. The main concern with rehabilitation of the power generation and\ndistribution  capacity  is  the  proper  collection  of  unusable  transformers  that  could  be\ncontaminated with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). PCB has been known to cause serious\nhealth problem in birds, fish, and reptiles, although its impact on mammals (including humans)\nis low. Transformers and electrical devices that may be contaminated with PCB will be collected\nand stored in a  secured area.  The area  will  be fenced  to  prevent accidental  recovery  of\ncontaminated materials, and bound to prevent contamination through surface runoff. Ultimate\ndisposal of PCB and PCB-contaminated materials is expensive. In some developed countries,\nhigh  temperature  incinerators  are  used  to  destroy  PCB,  but  are  reluctant  to  accept\ncontaminated materials from foreign sources for processing. Thus, secured storage for future\nprocessing is the most logical procedure for East Timor\n.\n2. Biological Environment\n13. Road Works. The emergency road works will have limited impact on the biological\nenvironment. The most serious impact would result from erosion if the drainage channels are\nnot properly designed, as some trees maybe washed out if the water flows away from the\nnormal drainage pattern. The civil works will be sensitive to these potential impacts.\n14. Port Works. The emergency port works will have a minimal impact on the biological\nenvironment because they merely involve concreting. Dili Port will not involve any dredging,\nbackfilling, or piling operations.\n15. Power  Subproject.  The  emergency  power  subproject  will  have  no  impact  on  the\nbiological environment as it will be implemented within the existing power plant structure and the\ndistribution  lines  along  the  existing  rights-of-way.  Improved  handling  of  PCB-contaminated\ntransformers, spent oil, and sludge will remove those potential pollutants from the environment.\n3. Sociocultural Environment\n16. Road Works. The works will use the existing road rights-of-way. No land acquisition or\nresettlement will be required. The sociocultural impact will be mostly positive. During the next 12\nmonths, the works are expected to assist in the flow of food and agricultural supplies to famine\nstricken areas, resettlement of displaced persons, and enforcement of peace and order. In the\nmedium  term,  the  Project  will  help  reconstruct  East  Timor.  Improved  road  conditions  are\nexpected to facilitate commerce, communication, and cultural interaction among the different\nparts of East Timor.", "54 Appendix 11, page 4\n17. Port  Works.  The  port  works  will  not  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  The\nimpacts and benefits of the project on the sociocultural environment are similar to those of the\nroad works.\n18. Power Subproject. The subproject will restore the power supply to vital services such\nas water supply, hospital, schools, markets, communication, and cottage industries. The project\nwill not require any land or resettlement. Thus, the impacts on the sociocultural environment are\nmostly positive, similar to those of the road and port works.\nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n19. Indonesian environmental laws and regulations remain in effect in East Timor. The\npersonnel implementing and enforcing the environmental laws and regulations were mostly\nIndonesian nationals and are not expected to return to East Timor. The UNTAET needs support\nin  reviewing  these  regulations  and  developing  capacity  to  undertake  environmental\nassessments. ADB\u2019s TA is proposed to assist in these areas.\n20. The project will also establish capacity in the port sector to analyze oil in water and\nmonitor oil pollution in the sea and in discharges from ships. In the power subsector, capacity to\nanalyze for oil pollution, noise, and smoke will be provided. In the road subsector, capacity to\nmonitor  noise,  suspended  solids,  and  sediment  load  will  be  included  in  the  project.  The\npersonnel trained in the project will report directly to the project manager.\nF.  Findings and Recommendations\n21. Human resources and institutions need to be trained for environmental and natural\nresources management. A database and monitoring programs need to be developed\nG. Conclusions\n22. The  potential  environmental  impacts  are  limited  to  construction  activities  that  are\ntemporary and reversible. The medium- and long-term impacts of the proposed Project are\npositive, especially in promoting the economic and social development of East Timor, facilitating\nreconstruction and redevelopment. A detailed environmental impact assessment is not needed.", "55 Appendix 12, page 1\nINITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\nA. Benefits and Beneficiaries\n1. On  4  September  1999  when  the  referendum  results  were  announced  in  favor  of\nindependence, violence broke out in East Timor. More than 80 percent of the population was\ndisplaced. Their houses, workplaces, schools, hospitals, and places of worship were destroyed,\nand farmlands were abandoned. Massive relief efforts by the international community were\nneeded to avert famine and restore peace and order, basic services, and infrastructure. Details\nof the damage and its impact on the population are given in paragraphs 3 and 5-7 of the main\nreport on the project grant.\n2. The immediate benefits of the emergency port and road projects are facilitating the (i)\nmovement of food supplies to famine-stricken areas; (ii) movement of agricultural supplies,\nspecifically seeds for farmers to start growing food; (iii) resettlement of internally displaced\npersons and refugees; and (iv) movement of the United Nations peacekeeping forces. These\nprojects will utilize labor, especially in rural areas where heavy equipment is difficult to transfer\nand the required road standards are low. The use of local labor will stimulate the local economy\nand help in the reconstruction of the communities. The immediate beneficiaries of the Project\nare the famine stricken areas of East Timor and the semi- and unemployed rural workers.\n3. Beneficiaries of the emergency power subproject will primarily be the urban and semi-\nurban population. The power project will assist in the operation of essential services such as\nwater supply, hospitals, schools, commercial establishments, and industries.\nB. Needs, Demands, and Absorptive Capacity\n4. The emergency Project will restore the roads and power supply to levels equal to those\nthat existed prior to the conflict.  The demands are slightly lower from the local population\nbecause of the economic dislocation, but demand from the international community relief and\nrehabilitation efforts more than accounts for the slack in domestic demand.  The relief efforts are\ncongesting the ports and straining the road network as food is rushed to famine stricken areas,\ndisplaced people return to their homes, and support services are provided. These include\nmedicines, seeds and agricultural inputs, temporary shelters, and reconstruction materials. The\nproject  will  also  stimulate  employment  in  the  rural  areas  and  assist  in  the  long-term\nreconstruction of East Timor.\n5. The Project will have a direct positive impact on the estimated 80 percent of the East\nTimorese displaced by the conflict. As the Project will restore road conditions and power supply\nto the level available before the conflict, its outputs are within the absorptive capacity of East\nTimor. The completion of the unfinished section of the port facilities and repair of the landing\nfacilities are also within the absorptive capacity of the local economy and the international\ncommunity currently operating in the country.\nC. Adverse Effects on Vulnerable Groups\n6. The Project will not involve any land acquisition or resettlement. Project works will use\nthe existing rights-of-way. The Project will not have negative impacts on any vulnerable group.", "56 Appendix 12, page 2\nD. Social Dimensions in Project Design\n7. Poverty. The conflict has reduced a large portion of East Timor to poverty, and in a\nnumber  of  instances  potentially  to  starvation.  The  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  in\ngenerating employment especially for unskilled and semiskilled labor, under the road repair and\npower restoration components. Most of the industries and services in East Timor are using low\ntechnology that easily accommodates low skilled workers. The Project is expected  to hire\ndirectly 10,000 semiskilled workers throughout East Timor for short durations during the next 12\nmonths.\n8. Gender. Women, especially the pregnant and those with infant children, are the most\nvulnerable group to insufficient food intake. The impact of the Project on the group is most\npositive, as it will help transport food and agricultural inputs to rebuild farms. The emergency\npower project will help restore water supply and health care facilities, and reestablish schools.\n9. Minorities. East Timor has no identified minority groups.  Rural communities are the\nmain beneficiaries of the road works, specifically areas that were not able to plant in late 1999\nand early 2000 because of the conflict and are currently facing possible famine. The project will\nalso help rural communities rebuild the agriculture sector, which will help them buy needed\nconstruction materials to rebuild houses and buildings destroyed during the conflict.\n10. Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The project will not involve any land acquisition or\nresettlement, as described (para. 6).\nE. Monitoring and Evaluation\n11. The project management unit will supervise, monitor, and review with the road and port\ncontractors, the recruitment and hiring of local residents during implementation. The emergency\nroad repair program will be coordinated with various relief and assistance activities, especially\nthe World Food Program and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. The program\nwill focus on sections that need high priority maintenance and repair. The Asian Development\nBank is currently doing a tariff study for the power sector and a socioeconomic profile of the\nusers will be made. The tariffs established will include mechanisms to allow the poor access to\nthe electricity."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20000601152458Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Creator": "PSCRIPT.DRV Version 4.0", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R103-00.cover.doc", "ModDate": "D:20040401181609+08'00'"}}
