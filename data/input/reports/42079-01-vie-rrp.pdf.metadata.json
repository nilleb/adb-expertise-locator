This NMU\u2014the University of Science and \nTechnology  of  Hanoi  (USTH)\u2014will  demonstrate  a  new  policy  framework  for  the  governance, \nfinancing,  and  quality  assurance  of  universities  in  Viet  Nam.  The  USTH  will  be  established  in \npartnership  with  the  Government  of  France  and  the  Vietnam  Academy  of  Science  and  Technology \n(VAST).  The  Government  of  France  will  provide  about  \u20ac100  million  to  support  development  and \noperating  costs  until  at  least  2020,  including  provision  of  curricula,  research  capacity,  the  rector, \nacademic  staff,  and  scholarships.  The  USTH  opened  in  October  2010  using  facilities  at  VAST  and \nenrollments are expected to reach 1,000 by 2014. It will migrate to its new campus at Hoa Lac High \nTech Park (HHTP), which is being developed in cooperation with the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, once it is ready. The World Bank approved the development of an NMU\u2014the Vietnamese\u2013\nGerman University\u2014in June 2010.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nEconomy.  Viet  Nam  has  been  one  of  Asia\u2019s  fastest-growing  economies,  with  growth  in  real \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  averaging  7.4%  from  1989  to  2008.  Viet  Nam's  rapid  economic \ndevelopment has significantly changed the structure of the economy, with the industry share of GDP \ngrowing, and that of agriculture falling, between 1995 and 2005. The modernization of the  Viet Nam \neconomy has had a big impact on the demand for skilled labor and the nature of skills required. There \nis  increasing  demand  for  skilled  workers  in  those  occupations  that  traditionally  recruit  tertiary \neducation graduates, and in developing sectors such as manufacturing and electricity. From 1998 to \n2004, the share of higher education graduates in the manufacturing, construction, and utilities sectors \nrose substantially in Viet Nam. Demand for skilled workers is being driven by both demand and supply \nfactors. \n \n4. \nAchievements. The higher education system in Viet Nam has changed markedly since 1990. \nIn  2009\u20132010,  there  were  more  than  1.79  million  Vietnamese  enrolled  in  376  higher  education \ninstitutions (HEIs), 150 of which award degrees, compared with just 162,000 students in 110 HEIs in \n1993, showing significantly increased access to higher education. Other improvements to the  higher \neducation  system  include  a  shift  from  small  specialized  institutes  toward  larger  multidisciplinary \nuniversities,  better  integration  of  research  within  universities,  and  increased  private  financing  and \ndelivery  of  higher  education.  Despite  these  developments  in  increasing  system  capacity,  the  higher \neducation system is ill-equipped to meet the needs of the fast-growing Vietnamese economy and the \nincreasing need for innovation and higher-order skills.  \n \n5. \nAccess and staffing. The higher education system could accommodate only one-third of those \nseeking  admission  in  2009.  The  gross  enrollment  ratio,  estimated  at  no  more  than  16%  in  2005,  is \nbelow  that  of  other  high-performing  countries  such  as  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (20%)  and \nMalaysia (32%). Furthermore, there are wide disparities in access, with tertiary education enrollments \nfrom  the  richest  quintile  being  about  four  times  that  of  the  lowest  quintile.  From  1987  to  2009,  the \nstudent\u2013teacher  ratio  increased  more  than  fourfold,  to  29:1.  There  are  wide  differences  across  HEI \n                                                \n1   The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  Project  preparation  was  carried  out  through  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB). 2010. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Higher Education Sector \nDevelopment Project. Manila (TA 7105-VIE). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ntypes,  with the  student\u2013teacher ratio  ranging from  15:1  at  colleges  to  54:1 at regional  universities\u2014\nabove levels in many member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Staff quality is \nbelow requirements due to low salaries and the cumbersome promotion procedures that limit rewards \nfor academic achievement. Faculty qualifications are low, with less than half of academic staff having \npostgraduate qualifications, with most at the masters level. Quality control is also problematic.   \n \n6. \nGovernance. The governance of the higher education system is overly centralized and pays too \nlittle attention to quality, outputs, and outcomes. Public HEIs have limited governance and management \nautonomy\u2014university  enrollments  are  strictly  controlled  through  a  quota  system,  tuition  fees  are \ncapped,  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  makes  most  management  decisions, \nincluding  appointing  the  rector  and  establishing  rules  on  budgeting,  spending,  and  personnel \nmanagement.  Academic  staff  are  poorly  paid  and,  because  they  are  public  servants,  the  rules \nsurrounding  pay  levels,  staff  promotion,  and  hiring  and  firing  are  made  centrally.  The  MOET  must \napprove institutional budgets.   \n \n7. \nFinancing. Viet Nam's total expenditure on colleges and universities in 2002 was  equal to just \n0.41% of GDP\u2014significantly lower than in other East Asian countries (1.62%) and lower than the 75 \ncountries  reporting  tertiary  education  expenditures  to  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and \nCultural  Organization  (1.22%).  Public  universities  generate  too  little  funding  from  private  sources\u2014\nonly one-third of revenues, which compares with more than 80% for semipublic, people-founded, and \nprivate  universities.  Public  universities  also  generate  little  revenue  from  contractual  research  and \ndevelopment\u2014only  1.3%  of  revenue,  compared  to  2.0%\u20132.5%  for  semipublic,  people-founded,  and \nprivate universities. Per-student spending on public universities was estimated at $400 in 2009.   \n \n8. \nInnovation. The generation, diffusion, absorption, and application of new ideas are increasingly \nbeing  seen  as  important  factors  in  explaining  economic  growth  and  development.  As  the  Vietnamese \neconomy evolves, innovation and skill are likely to be called upon to play an increasingly important role \nin driving economic growth and development. Unfortunately, Viet Nam scores poorly compared to key \nAsian  neighbors  such  as  Malaysia  and  Thailand  on  a  range  of  innovation  measures,  including  the \nnumber of researchers in research and development (R&D), total expenditure on R&D as a percentage \nof GDP, university\u2013company collaboration, and patents granted. The same is true for other indicators\u2014\ne.g., the number of peer-reviewed articles published by Vietnamese academics is low, and substantially \nlower than in neighboring countries. \n   \n9. \nResearch  and  development.  Developing  the  country\u2019s  teaching  and  research  base, \nparticularly in the area of science and technology, will be critical if Viet Nam is to transform itself into a \nmodern, industrialized nation. University  R&D can positively affect economic development, while  the \nperceived quality of research institutions and public\u2013private linkages are seen as having a significant \npositive impact on productivity and on the intensity of countries' R&D performance. In  Viet Nam, the \nhigher education system does not play the role of innovation incubator or provider of skilled labor that \nit  does  in  successful  middle-income  countries,  thus  constraining  knowledge  creation\u2014a  key  to \nimproved  productivity  and  competitiveness.  This  owes  much  to  the  weak  state  of  higher  education \nresearch  in  the  country,  which  is  due  to  factors  such  as  low  levels  of  state  and  nonstate  research \nfunding,  the  separation  of  teaching  (typically  conducted  at  universities)  and  research  (conducted  at \nspecialized  research  organizations),  a  lack  of  research  being  undertaken  by  higher  education \nacademics, a lack of qualified academic staff, and limited numbers of postgraduate students.    \n \n10. \nHigher Education Reform Agenda 2006\u20132020. The Government of Viet Nam recognizes the \nneed  to  address  higher  education  challenges,  as  reflected  in  the  Higher  Education  Reform  Agenda \n(HERA),  its  strategy  for  developing  a  competitive  higher  education  system  with  advanced  teaching \nand research capacity. The HERA\u2019s main objectives are to (i) dramatically increase the participation \nrate  in  universities,  (ii)  boost  quality  and  efficiency,  (iii)  strengthen  research  capacity  in  universities, \nand (iv) improve governance of the higher education system.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\ntechnology \n\nindustry,  establishing  knowledge  exchange  and \n\n \nKey  features.  The  project  focuses  on  improving  the  teaching  and  research  capacity  of  the \n11. \nViet  Nam  higher  education  system  by  supporting  the  establishment  of  an  NMU  with  (i)  governance \nand  management  autonomy;  (ii)  a  curriculum  that  fosters  innovation  and  cross-disciplinary  work, \nsupported  by  the  appropriate  facilities;  (iii)  more  flexible  staffing  and  pay  arrangements;  (iv)  higher \nlevels  of state recurrent funding,  including research funding;  and  (v)  increased scope for generating \nprivate  revenue  through  tuition  fees  and  other  means.  More  broadly,  the  project  will  pilot  the  more \nflexible  policy  framework  developed  during  project  preparation,  which  will  be  refined  during \nimplementation, to serve as a basis for reforms that would allow it to be extended to other HEIs. The \nproject places considerable emphasis on building strong links between the USTH and the private sector to \nensure the quality and relevance of its teaching and research and to increase the institution\u2019s operating \nrevenues.  The  USTH  council  will  include  private  sector  membership.  The  industry  engagement  center \nwithin  the  USTH  will  be  a  key  channel  for  enhancing  public\u2013private  links  through  developing  regular \ntransfer  services, \ninteractions  with \ncommercializing research, and developing industry internships for staff and students. The USTH will also \ndevelop a foundation to solicit philanthropic contributions from industry.   \n \nDevelopment  partner  support  to  the  higher  education  sector.  A number of development \n12. \npartners  operate  in  the  higher  education  sector  in  Viet  Nam,  including  the  World  Bank,  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  France,  and  the  Netherlands.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Second  Higher \nEducation  Project2 and  Higher  Education  Development  Policy  Program3 support  the  implementation \nof  the  government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  and  HERA.  The  Second  Higher  Education \nProject  seeks  to  increase  the  quality  of  teaching  and  research  in  universities  to  improve  graduate \nemployability and research relevance by developing policy and building central government capacity, \nand  building  capacity,  relevance,  and  autonomy  at  the  university  level.  The  Higher  Education \nDevelopment Policy Program aims to strengthen governance, rationalize financing, improve teaching \nand  research,  increase  accountability,  and  improve  financial  management  in  the  higher  education \nsector. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) project is part of a two-track approach to achieving policy \nreform in higher education, with the institutional focus of ADB and World Bank NMUs complementing \nthe broader reforms under the Second Higher Education Project and Higher Education Development \nPolicy  Program.  ADB\u2019s Private  Sector Operations  Department  supported  the  establishment  of  RMIT \nInternational University Viet Nam in 2001.   \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe expected impact of the project is improved performance of the higher education system in \nViet  Nam.  The  performance  target  is  that  Viet  Nam\u2019s  rank  on  the  innovation  pillar  of  the  World \nEconomic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Index increases from  49th in 2010 to 45th by 2022. The \nproject's  expected  outcome  is  a  high-quality  NMU  that  generates  industry-relevant  science  and \ntechnology teaching and research.  \n \nC. \n \n14. \nThe project will deliver four outputs: (i)  an effective management and governance system for \nthe  USTH  will  be  developed  and  implemented,  (ii)  systems  to  promote  high-quality  and  relevant \nacademic  programs  at  the  USTH  will  be  developed  and  implemented,  (iii)  physical  facilities  at  the \nUSTH will be constructed and outfitted, and (iv) effective project management and implementation.   \n \n                                                \n2   World Bank. 2007.

The  USTH  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  outputs  1  and  2.  The  MOET  has \nestablished  an  overall  PMU  (the  PMU  for  universities  of  excellence,  PMU-UE)  to  (i)  manage  and \noversee overall project activities, (ii) facilitate dialogue and coordinate across MOET departments and \nother  relevant  agencies,  and  (iii)  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  World  Bank  NMU  project.  The \nminister  of  education  will  head  the  PMU-UE.  The  MOET  will  establish  a  PMU  for  USTH  (the  PMU-\nUSTH)  to  (i)  implement  output  3,  (ii)  process  withdrawal  applications,  (iii)  support  the  UIU  in  the \nimplementation of outputs 1 and 2, (iv) monitor USTH activities, and (v)  prepare project reports. The \nPMU-USTH  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  professional  project  manager  and  supported  by  a  full-time \nstanding deputy director, drawn from the MOET, and will have at least eight full-time staff.   \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency \n(ii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iii)  Implementation unit \nProcurement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\n1 January  2012 \u2212 31 December 2017 \n31 December  2017 \n\nMOET \nMOET, USTH \nPMU-USTH: 8 full-time staff; UIU: 11 full-time-equivalent staff \n\nConsulting services and \nconstruction \n\nAdvance action and retroactive \nfinancing \n\n9 contracts \n2 \n1 contracts \n1 \n5 \n3 \n\nICB \nNCB \nShopping \nQBS (education) \nQBS (construction) \nQCBS (construction) \nProcurement for project readiness (firm) and procurement adviser.

The UIU will be headed by \na manager and will have at least 11 full-time-equivalent staff.   \n\n24. \nThe government asked ADB to approve advance action and retroactive financing to expedite \nthe recruitment of consultants. ADB advised the government that any approval of advance action and \nretroactive financing do not commit ADB to financing the project.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n25. \nThe  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  project  will  be  the  approximately  5,000  students  who,  in  any \ngiven year, will be enrolled at the USTH once the new facilities have been constructed and who will \ntherefore  benefit  from  attendance  at  an  international-standard  university  focused  on  science  and \ntechnology. In particular, students will benefit from improved teaching, international standard curricula, \nand  teaching  facilities.  Approximately  100  female  students  at  any  given  time  will  benefit  from \nscholarship  assistance  to  attend  the  USTH.  The  new  dormitory  accommodation  will  benefit  some \n1,800  students  at  any  given  time,  of  which  approximately  40%  will  be  female.  Academic  staff  and \nstudents  at  the  USTH  and  researchers  at  VAST  will  benefit  significantly  from  the  provision  of \ninternational-standard  research  laboratories  and  equipment,  as  well  as  extended  networks  with \nresearchers from around the world. Academic staff and administrators will benefit from the extensive \ntraining and mentoring programs provided under the project.  \n \n26. \nViet  Nam  industrial  development  will  benefit  indirectly  from  an  injection  of  higher-skilled  and \nmore  productive  workers  and  the  utilization  of  outputs  of  locally  conducted  science  and  technology \nresearch  that  is  expected  to  boost  capacity  for  innovation  and  expansion.  The  public  will  benefit \nindirectly through increases in socioeconomic development over time, as the NMU contributes higher \nskills  that  facilitate  Vietnam\u2019s  progress  through  medium-income  status  and  underpins  the  country\u2019s \nmove  to  more  intensive  industrialization.  The  higher  education  system  will  benefit  from  training  and \nhigher  skill  acquisition  and  new  facilities  for  Vietnamese  researchers  who  might  otherwise  work \nabroad. Future students will directly benefit from improved educational outcomes, better employment \nprospects, and a higher rate of return on skills.   \n \nA. \n \n27. \nThe  project funds the  construction of  a  new greenfield  campus for  a  science  and technology \nuniversity  of  international  standard,  including  the  building  and  equipping  of  leading-edge  science \nlaboratories  for  postgraduate  research  and  teaching.  The  local  construction  industry  has  little \nexperience in managing such projects. The project will use international firms to manage the design, \nconstruction, and fit out of the USTH. The French international partner will provide doctorate training \nin  France  for  future  USTH  academic  staff.  The  project  will  fund  capacity  building  for  laboratory \nmaintenance  and  training  of  technicians,  and  will  also  support  the  government  to  develop  more \nappropriate  policies  and  approaches  to  (i)  providing  sustainable  levels  of  recurrent  financing  for \nresearch activities, and (ii) depreciation to support a systematic maintenance and replacement plan. \n \nB. \n \n28. \n The  economic  benefits  of  the  project  will  flow  from  increased  numbers  of  science  and \ntechnology  graduates,  and  from  industry  utilization  of  more,  and  more  relevant,  locally  conducted \nscience  and  technology  research,  which  is  expected  to  boost  innovation.  The  output  of  graduates \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nTechnical  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance  \n\nfrom  the  USTH  will  be  significant  at  postgraduate  level,  particularly  as  regards  graduates  of  high \nquality in science and technology. The USTH will provide a quantum injection of science teaching and \nresearch  capacity  and,  at  initial  design  capacity  of  5,000  students,  will  increase  research  outputs  of \ndoctorate  students  in  Viet  Nam  and  research  publications.  Development  of  this  high-caliber  science \ncapacity will support the development of a more highly industrialized economy, and will take at least a \ngeneration to mature. Viet Nam needs to start its expanded investment now to ensure it keeps pace \nwith its planned rate of industrialization. Costs per graduate will be high relative to current levels, but \nrates  of  return  to  higher  education  are  increasing.  No  rate  of  return  has  been  calculated  given  the \nnovelty of this type of investment in Viet Nam and the paucity of relevant data.  \n \n29. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  USTH  is  projected  to  absorb  about  2%  of  higher  education \nsystem resources (exclusive of loan repayments) by 2020. These estimates allow for some increase \nin  unit  costs  at  the  USTH,  as  will  be  necessary  to  progress  upwards  through  regional  and  global \nuniversity  rankings,  and  to  sustain  the  university\u2019s  asset  base.  In  assessing  long-term  financial \nsustainability,  the  government  will  need  to  take  into  account  the  significant  costs  projected  for  both \nNMUs,  not  just  the  USTH.  To  ensure  financial  sustainability  in  the  years  immediately  following \nestablishment, the government will develop a special financing mechanism that will provide recurrent \nfunding  for  the  USTH  at  rates  per  student  that  are  well  above  those  provided  to  existing  public \nuniversities.  In  addition,  the  USTH  will  benefit  from  substantial  assistance  from  the  Government  of \nFrance in the form of management and academic staff and curriculum, at least until 2020. The USTH \nwill  also  benefit  increasingly  from  private  sector  revenue  in  the  form  of  tuition  fees,  consulting,  and \nresearch income. Tuition fees will be well above those charged by other public universities.      \n  \nC. \n \nFinancial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessments  of  the  MOET  and  PMU-UE \n30. \nwere conducted and found that they will face significant challenges in implementing the project unless \nmitigating measures are instituted. The key concern is that the MOET is responsible for implementing \nmany projects, including from ADB, the World Bank, bilateral development partners, and government \nprojects  in  neighboring  countries.  This  heavy  workload,  coupled  with  limits  on  the  number  and \ncapacity  of  staff,  would  tax  the  ability  of  the  MOET  and  PMU-UE  to  carry  out  timely  and  effective \nprocurement  and  disbursements.  The  financial  management  assessment  highlighted  the  limited \ncapacity, lack of finance and accounting staff, and the existence of two accounting systems operating \nwithin the MOET, which could create confusion during implementation. \n \n31. \nThe MOET will hire additional qualified finance and accounting officers to strengthen existing \nPMU-UE  staff.  The  PMU-UE  will  address  the  accounting  system  issue  and  will  urgently  procure \naccounting software. The procurement office of MOET is familiar with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time) and requirements, as it has worked with ADB for many years. \nThe  limited  number  of  qualified  staff  to  support  ongoing  projects  is  a  concern,  as  is  the  lack  of \ntechnical expertise within the MOET and the PMU-UE in the procurement of science laboratories and \nequipment.  PMU-UE  staff  indicated  that  they  will  recruit  qualified  and  experienced  procurement \nspecialists  to  ensure  that  the  availability  of  human  resources  is  in  line  with  the  procurement \nrequirements  for  the  implementation  of  such  a  large  civil  works  project.  International  experts  will \nsupport PMU-USTH in the procurement and management of the complex construction contracts. The \nproject  also  splits  procurement  between PMU-USTH  and  the  UIU,  with the  latter responsible for the \nacademic and university management outputs.   \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe  government  and  the  MOET.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual.4 \n                                                \n4   Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \nD. \n \n33. \nKey  issues  related  to  poverty  and  social  equity  in  higher  education  relate  to  affordability. \nStudents  from  poor  and  lower-income  families  have  limited  access  to  fee-paying  HEIs.  Further,  the \nlack  of  high-quality  primary  and  secondary  education  limits  students\u2019  (especially  those  from  ethnic \ngroups  and  in  remote  areas)  access  to  postsecondary  education.  The  project  addresses  to  some \ndegree  these  constraints  through  the  provision  of  scholarships  to  attend  the  USTH,  allocation  of \ndormitory  spaces  for  poor  and  disadvantaged  students  including  girls,  secondary  school  outreach \nprograms, and provision of student support services.5 \n \n34. \nGender  and  development.  The  project  is  categorized  as  gender  mainstreaming.  It  includes \nelements  that  address  key  constraints  on  female  participation  in  higher  education  in  science  and \ntechnology  fields,  female  perceptions  of  science  and  technology  studies  and  careers,  and  gender \nimbalance  among  academic  staff.  The  project  includes  a  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  to  facilitate  and \npromote increased female participation and benefits from the project. The GAP addresses access and \nequity issues by setting targets and gender-responsive design features, including (i) development and \nimplementation  of  equity  strategies,  such  as  scholarships,  outreach  programs,  and  mentoring;  (ii) \nreservation of 40% of dormitory places for girls; (iii)  a quota of 20% females in senior management, \nacademic  staff,  and  university  council  positions;  (iv)  30%  female  representation  in  capacity-building \nprograms; (v) gender balance in industry placement programs; (vi) provision of gender training to key \nstakeholders;  (vii)  gender-inclusive  design  of  physical  facilities;  and  (viii)  development  of  monitoring \nand evaluation indicators to track GAP implementation.6  \n \n35. \nEthnic groups. No ethnic group development plan has been prepared as the USTH is unlikely \nto have a significant impact on ethnic groups given its selective nature and the underrepresentation of \nethnic groups in higher education.   \n \nE. \n \n36. \nThe involuntary resettlement category is A. The site requires clearance and resettlement, with \nover  300  affected  persons  identified  for  resettlement  and/or  compensation.  A  resettlement  plan  has \nbeen  prepared.  The  total  cost  of  resettlement  compensation  is  estimated  at  $3.0  million.  The \nindigenous  peoples\u2019  categorization  is  C,  as  the  project  is  not  expected  to  have  either  positive  or \nnegative impacts on indigenous people. The environmental categorization is B. During construction of \nthe  campus,  contractors  will  keep  noise  and  dust  within  locally  acceptable  levels,  and  manage  fill, \nexcavated  material,  and  solid  waste  in  a  way  that  does  not  create  a  permanent  impact.  Guidelines \nhave  been  prepared  to  ensure  that  buildings,  especially  laboratories,  are  secure  and  capable  of \nproper  management  of  toxic  materials.  Water  supply  in  the  dormitories  will  meet  national  drinking \nwater quality standards.   \n \nF. \n \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.7 The major risks are: (i) the government fails to provide \nthe appropriate management and academic autonomy and levels of recurrent funding required for the \nUSTH  to  meet  international  standards  for  teaching  and  research,  (ii)  the  foreign  strategic  partner \nwithdraws  support  for  the  USTH  or  cannot  sustain  support  at  a  level  required  for  capacity  building, \nand (iii) campus construction is delayed due to slower-than-anticipated development of the HHTP or \ndelays in government approval of the USTH site plan.     \n                                                \n5   Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6   Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked docs in Appendix 2). \n7   Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nOutcome \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \n\nGovernment of Viet Nam abandons commitment to the \nconcept of new model universities. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\n \nPolicy framework underlying new model university \nconcept is set out in USTH charter.
