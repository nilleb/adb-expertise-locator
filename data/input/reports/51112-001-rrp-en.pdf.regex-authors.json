THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $250,000,000 to PT. Jawa Satu Power for the development of the Jawa-1 Liquefied Natural \nGas-to-Power Project in Indonesia. The report also describes the proposed administration of a \nloan of up to $150,000,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s Private Infrastructure Fund1 \n(LEAP), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the loan. \n \n2.  Under the proposed project, PT. Jawa Satu Power will build, operate, and maintain a \ncombined-cycle, gas-fired power plant with a nominal capacity of 1,760 megawatts (MW) in \nCilamaya, Karawang, West Jawa. The loans will support the development of one of the first and \nlargest power projects using liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Indonesia, testifying to the commitment \nof the Government of Indonesia to reduce the country\u2019s dependency on coal while using cleaner \ndomestic energy sources. The project will also provide an affordable power generation source \nthat could increase the penetration capacity of renewable energy sources on the Jawa\u2013Bali grid. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  Indonesia is the largest economy in Southeast Asia, with a gross domestic product of \n$1 trillion in 2017. Economic growth has averaged 5.0% from 2015 to 2017, but stronger growth \nis needed to drive poverty down to a single digit and reverse the situation of high inequality.2 \nGrowth remains below potential because of structural impediments such as deficient energy \ninfrastructure.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  estimates  Indonesia\u2019s  infrastructure \ninvestment needs at $1.1 trillion for 2016\u20132030, or $1.3 trillion if climate adaptation measures are \nincluded.3 Accelerating investment in affordable and sustainable energy is critical for achieving \nthe country\u2019s economic and social development goals. \n \n4.  The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) anticipates power demand to \nexceed current forecasts, resulting in a shortage that could undermine the country\u2019s sustainable \ngrowth potential if not addressed adequately. Every year, MEMR issues a rolling 10-year plan \nprepared by Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the national electric utility, to prioritize new power \ninvestments. The National Electricity Business Plan\u2014or Rencana Umum Penyediaan Tenaga \nListrik (RUPTL), as it is known in Bahasa Indonesia\u2014for 2018\u201320274 indicates that, during this \nperiod, 56 gigawatts (GW) will be added to PLN\u2019s network.5  \n \n                                                \n1   The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is the financing partner.  \n2  The proportion of people living in poverty has declined by more than half, from 24% in 1999 to 10.1% in 2017, but \nremains high for a lower middle-income country. \n3  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia's Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n4  Government of Indonesia, MEMR. 2018. Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik 2018\u20132027. Jakarta. \n5  In the RUPTL for 2018\u20132027, power demand was revised downward from 2015\u20132017 levels because economic \ngrowth was lower than expected. However, the required overall power capacity, including an adequate reserve \nmargin, still exceeds the existing capacity. \n \n ", "2 \n5.  Supporting sustainable growth. The RUPTL 2018\u20132027 stresses an increased use of \nLNG as a source of fuel.6 It anticipates LNG as a share of total natural gas to increase from 33% \nin 2018 to almost 60% in 2027. The use of combined-cycle7 gas-fired generation can improve the \nenvironmental sustainability of the current energy mix by displacing diesel and coal as fuels for \nelectricity generation. Gas turbines can ramp up more quickly than coal or diesel units, and thus \nare better suited to respond rapidly to load fluctuations. In turn, this can enable greater use of \nintermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Therefore, the increase in the use \nof natural gas will help the government reach the target of 23% for power generation from \nrenewable energy sources. \n \n6.  Increasing power affordability. The Jawa-1 LNG-to-power project will also help lower \nthe average power generation cost in Indonesia\u2019s largest power grid. From 2015 to 2017, the \ngovernment has attempted to reduce the cost of electricity. The MEMR issued new regulations in \nJanuary 2017 to set energy tariffs against the local and national grid price.8 The cost of power \ngeneration (commonly referred to as BPP, which is short for Biaya Pokok Pembangkitan) is \ndetermined by the MEMR every year.9  \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n7.  The project entails the construction, operation, and maintenance of a 1,760-MW load-\nfollowing, combined-cycle, gas turbine (CCGT) power plant about 100 kilometers (km) east of \nJakarta on the Javanese coastline. PLN is responsible for sourcing the LNG The project will be \nimplemented under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with PLN.  \n \n3.  Borrower and Sponsors \n \n8.  The project will be implemented through a special purpose vehicle (SPV), PT. Jawa Satu \nPower (the borrower). The SPV is owned by reputable sponsors: (i) a major Japanese trading \nhouse, Marubeni Corporation,; (ii) Sojitz Corporation, also a large Japanese trading house; and \n(iii) PT. Pertamina (Persero), an integrated national oil, gas, and geothermal company, wholly \nowned by the Government of Indonesia.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n9.  Integrity due diligence10 and enhanced tax due diligence11 have been conducted on the \nborrower and related entities.  \n \n                                                \n6  Of this new capacity, 57% is expected to be developed by independent power producers (IPPs).

The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed to the nearby steam \nturbine, which generates extra power. \n8  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  While the tariff ceilings apply to new and renewable energy, the BPP provides an indication of the average price of \nPLN\u2019s grid. Regulation No. 50 imposed caps on tariffs based on PLN\u2019s cost of generation. If the cost of generation \nin the area is less or equal to the national average (as is the case for Java, Sumatra, and Bali), the local area cost of \ngeneration applies as cap. \n10  ADB. 2003.

The project will contribute to reestablish Indonesia\u2019s energy independence by \nredirecting energy resources from export markets to the domestic market. Over time Indonesia is \ntransitioning from an export economy into one based on domestic consumption. \n \n11.  Outcome. The project outcome is: an increase in power generated from local energy \nsources. The project will generate 9,400 gigawatt-hours of energy annually and 120 local jobs \nduring operations, of which at least 15 will be for women.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n12.  Outputs. The project outputs are: (i) the installation of a 1,760 MW combined cycle gas-\nfired power plant and ancillary infrastructure; (ii) the generation of local employment with the \ncreation of at least 4,000 jobs during construction, of which at least 240 will be for women; and \n(iii) support of local economic growth through domestic purchases during construction. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n13.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project supports private \nsector participation in infrastructure, a core pillar of ADB\u2019s long-term strategy as affirmed by \nStrategy 2030.12 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132019 \nfor Indonesia in supporting the expansion of infrastructure and environment-friendly technologies \nfor clean energy generation.13 It also contributes to the objectives of Indonesia\u2019s National Energy \nPlan.14 \n \n14.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy,15 which states that support for power infrastructure using \nLNG is to be broadened. The project fully aligns with ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy for Indonesia, \nwhich aims at strengthening the reach, reliability, and efficiency of the nation\u2019s electricity grid; and \nenabling greater use of clean energy. It also complements recent ADB assistance programs to \nthe MEMR and PLN for policy-based lending and direct investments.16 The project builds on \nADB\u2019s private sector experience and recent support to the LNG industry (footnote 12). \n \n15.  ADB is also the partner of choice for Indonesia\u2019s strategy to finance low-carbon power \ngeneration  through  private  sector  participation.  ADB  is  supporting  the  country\u2019s  efforts  to \nstrengthen the LNG supply chain, and to increase energy independence, while contributing to \nreduce power generation costs. ADB\u2019s contribution in support of the private sector in Indonesia\u2019s \nnatural gas value chain dates back to 2005, when ADB provided a $350 million loan for the \ngreenfield development of Tangguh LNG.17 In 2016, ADB financed the expansion of the Tangguh \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2018.

The proposed assistance will promote the use of domestic gas, likely \nto come from the Tangguh LNG expansion. Private sector operations complement sovereign \noperations in supporting natural gas generation in more remote areas of the country.

Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.19 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  The project is being implemented under the Electricity Law (30/2009), which \nframework  sets out the framework for private sector participation in power. In addition, \ngovernment regulation 14/2012, as amended by regulation 23/2014, sets out \nimplementation guidelines for private electricity supply. \nManagement  The project will be owned by PT. Jawa Satu Power (the borrower), which is \nsponsored by Marubeni, Sojitz, and Pertamina.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nImplementation  The project is developed on a build, own, operate, and transfer basis under a \nperiod  25-year power purchase agreement with PLN.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nConstruction  The power plant, pipeline, and transmission line will be built under offshore and \narrangements  onshore  EPC  contract arrangements.  For  the offshore  EPC  contract,  the \nselected contractor is a joint venture of GE and Samsung C&T. For the onshore \nEPC  contract,  the  contractor  is  a  joint  venture  between  GE  Indonesia, \nSamsung C&T, and PT. Meindo Elang Indah, a local contractor.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nOperations  The borrower will be responsible to operate and maintain the project. To do so, \narrangements  the borrower will enter into a long-term service agreement with GE to provide \nparts for and maintenance of the combustion turbines, steam turbines, and \ngenerators. \nSupply  PLN will supply LNG. \narrangements  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nPerformance  Lenders will receive key performance indicators, including output and outcome \nmonitoring  indicators.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s assistance will have two components: (i) a direct loan of up to $250 million; and (ii) \na parallel loan of up to $150 million to be provided by LEAP and administered by ADB; both to \nPT. Jawa Satu Power.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n18.  ADB is playing a critical role in ensuring implementation of environmental and social \nsafeguards  that  exceed  the  requirement  of  Indonesia\u2019s  standards.  As  a  result  of  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement in the project, expected emissions of air pollutants have been lowered, impact of \nconstruction noise and discharges is reduced compared to the original project proposal, and 20 \nvulnerable households that are expected to be affected by the project have been identified. A \nlivelihood restoration program will ensure additional protections for the vulnerable households. In \naddition, ADB involvement is accelerating the borrower\u2019s adoption of an anti-corruption policy and \ncode of conduct.  \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n19.  ADB has categorized the investment as follows: environment category A, involuntary \nresettlement category B, and indigenous peoples category C.20 To meet ADB requirements for an \nenvironment category A project, a draft environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) was \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 23 March 2018.21 This includes an environmental and social \nmanagement  plan  to  manage  and  monitor  impacts  of  the  project  during  construction  and \noperation.  The  sponsors  will  recruit  experienced  safeguards  staff  to  ensure  effective \nimplementation. \n \n20.  Environment. The power plant, transmission line and onshore pipelines occupy modified \nagricultural land (paddy fields and fish farms). The jetty, seaward sections of the pipelines are \nlocated in the marine environment. The power plant is adjacent to an existing LNG processing \nfacility, which includes a gas pipeline that runs parallel to the proposed pipelines. The coast \nfeatures fishponds and sparse mangroves and is zoned as protected forest and an endemic bird \narea.22 Impacts on the mangroves and bird habitat are potentially possible, so a precautionary \n                                                \n20 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n21 https://www.adb.org/projects/51112-001/main \n22 http://datazone.birdlife.org/eba/factsheet/161 \n ", "6 \napproach was taken in the disclosed ESIA. On ADB\u2019s advice, a targeted survey was conducted \nby an avifauna specialist engaged by the environmental consultant. The survey confirmed that \nthe project site does not provide suitable habitat for endangered bird species, and, therefore, it is \nnot classified as critical habitat. The clearance of natural habitat consisting of 0.33 hectares (ha) \nof mangroves, for the project will be mitigated by the protection and restoration of remnant coastal \nvegetation to achieve no net loss in biodiversity. The 52-kilometer transmission line crosses paddy \nfields, watercourses, roads, and villages. Tower design, placement, and height minimize noise, \nelectric magnetic fields, health and safety risks, and other environmental impacts as much as \npossible. \n \n21.  The project will use natural gas as fuel. The main air pollutant of potential concern is \nnitrogen dioxide (NO ). The baseline level of NO  indicates that the airshed is non-degraded. Air \n2 2\ndispersion modeling for operation of the plant shows that NO  emissions will comply  with \n2\nIndonesian air quality standards and World Health Organization guidelines.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n22.  The Java Sea has degraded water quality. The project area has few sensitive marine \nspecies and does not support coral or sea grass. Seawater will be used for all water needs, \nincluding closed-loop cooling. Wastewater will be treated on site, and discharges will comply with \nIFC and Indonesian marine water guidelines. Modeling confirms that, after mixing, changes in \ntemperature and salinity are within the range of natural variation at the site. Dredging volumes for \nthe jetty and pipeline will be 45,981 m3, less than the originally proposed 80,000 m3. Dredged \nmaterials are to be disposed on the seabed adjacent to the works area. The impact on fisherfolks \nand potential risks were considered as part of the ESIA. \n \n23.  Ambient noise levels are above IFC residential criteria. Noise modelling for construction \nindicates  localized  exceedances  in  noise  standards,  therefore  the  sponsor  has  agreed  to \nimplement mitigation measures. This includes pre-boring of piles, use of dampers when impact \npiling, restricting noisy work to daytime hours and installation of a noise wall. Noise modeling was \nconducted for the operation phase, which predicts that elevated noise levels comply with IFC \nguidelines and do not result in perceptible increases of more than 3 A-weighted decibels (dBA). \n \n24.  Stakeholder consultation was undertaken during the local environmental approval process \nand  during  the  preparation  of  the  ESIA.  A  community  grievance  redress  mechanism  was \ndeveloped and socialized. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n25.  Involuntary resettlement. The project will require the acquisition of land for the power \nplant, onshore pipeline, jetty, pumphouse, transmission line tower footings, and the substation,. \nThe land will be acquired through negotiation of voluntary sales (willing buyer\u2013willing seller). In \naddition, land below the transmission line will be subject to land use restriction. \n \n26.  The transmission line tower footings and the substation  were acquired between 2017 and \n2018 on a purely willing seller\u2013willing buyer basis,. All the  landowners have received at least \n80% of the compensation, while the remaining 20% will be paid when the land transfer is formally \ncompleted. The transmission line\u2019s right of way will impose land use restriction, such as maximum \nheight of trees and structures. As the transmission line footings positions have been defined, \npeople under the transmission line alignment will not have a choice to refuse. The land for the \npower plant, which is currently vacant, will be acquired from Pertamina Gas (Pertagas) through \n ", "7 \ntransfer of land ownership. Pertagas, as part of its corporate social responsibility program, had \ngiven permission for people to temporarily cultivate the land. The program activity formally ended \nin November 2016. The vacant land is used for the time being as a goat grazing area by random \ngoat owners from different villages. \n \n27.  The land for the onshore pipeline and access road will be partly acquired and partly leased. \nThe area is being used for paddy and fishponds. The land belongs to the Ministry of Environment \nand Forestry and is categorized as a protected forest. However, the surrounding communities \nhave cultivated the land for years, and some of them already obtained proof of ownership from \nthe National Land Agency and from village authority. These landowners will still be receiving their \ncompensation for the land. Land may also be leased for temporary use as laydown area during \nthe construction of the transmission line, onshore pipeline, and access road, if the already \nacquired land is not sufficient.  \n \n28.  The borrower has prepared a resettlement plan (RP)23 to guide the negotiations for land \nacquisition through a willing seller-willing buyer approach and the negotiated settlement for the \ntransmission line right of way. The RP also includes a livelihood restoration program for vulnerable \naffected land owners. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n29.  Indigenous people. No recognized indigenous peoples reside in the vicinity of the \nproposed  project  sites  in West  Java.  Java  island  dwellers  are the  largest  ethnic group  in \nIndonesia. Most of the landowners and people in the Karawang area, including Cilamaya, belong \nto the Sundanese ethnic group or a mixture of Sundanese and Javanese, while those in the \nBekasi area are Sundanese and Betawi. These people do not display a collective attachment to \nthe area. All groups speak their distinct local language but also communicate smoothly in Bahasa \nIndonesia  for  their  day-to-day  interaction.
