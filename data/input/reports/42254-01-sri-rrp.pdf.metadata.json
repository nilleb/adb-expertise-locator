It will \nfacilitate economic growth and contribute to reducing disparities in Sri Lanka, consistent with one \nof the government\u2019s key goals, which emphasizes equitable growth.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nNorthern Province is one of the worst conflict-affected regions in the country, emerging \nfrom nearly three decades of civil war. The damage to physical infrastructure has been severe \nand extensive. In particular, the road network lies in a state of total disrepair due to prolonged \nneglect and underinvestment. People in this region no longer have access to markets or basic \nsocial services as they once had and the transport of goods has dramatically slowed. Mobility \nbetween Northern Province and the country's southern region is also poor due to the substantial \ntravel time required because of the poor condition of the linking national arterial roads. This has \nhindered  the  spread  of  economic  activities  and  development.  Northern  Province  has  one  of  the \nhighest poverty rates in the country. \n \n4. \nThe 140 km of provincial roads to be rehabilitated are in Mannar and Vavuniya districts, \nand comprise minor feeder roads connecting settlements with markets, and major feeder roads \nconnecting towns and villages. Ultimately, these roads connect to the main north\u2013south national \narterial  road.2 The  170  km  of  national  roads  to  be  rehabilitated  comprise  108  km  connecting \nmajor provincial centers within Northern Province and 62 km in NCP. They will help link Northern \nProvince with major city centers in the country's southern region. The roads in Northern Province \nwill  be  rehabilitated  to  all-weather  bituminous  surfaces  and  will  facilitate  access  to  basic  social \nservices,  such  as  schools,  hospitals,  and  local  markets.  The  national  link  roads  in  NCP  will \nreceive improved surfacing and marginal widening, which will reduce travel time and cost, helping \nto  revitalize  travel  to  and  from  the  north.  Consequently,  the  improved  road  connectivity  will \nstimulate new economic opportunities. \n \n5. \nThe project has been designed in coordination with other development partners to ensure \nequitable geographic coverage and avoid overlaps,3 and complements ADB's recently approved \nsupplementary loan for the North East Community Restoration and Development Project II4 and \n                                                 \n1   Ministry of Finance and Planning. 2006.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Supplementary \nLoan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and \nDevelopment Project II. Manila (Loan 2168-SRI, for $52.8 million, approved on 2 March). \n\n\f2 \n\nthe  Conflict  Affected  Region  Emergency  Assistance  Project, 5  which  focus  on  reconstructing \nNorthern  Province's  essential  physical  infrastructure,  schools,  hospitals,  and  administrative \nbuildings.  These  and  other  assistance  program  being  prepared, 6 collectively,  help  ensure  that \nADB  assistance  is  provided  in  an  integrated  fashion  and  will  effectively  help  the  government  to \nbuild capacity for sustainable social and economic integration. \n \n6. \nThe project is consistent with the strategic objective set out in ADB's country partnership \nstrategy  (2009\u20132011):  To  improve  the  transport  system  in  Sri  Lanka,  and  promote  regionally \nbalanced  and  socially  inclusive  economic  growth.  The  project  is  included  in  the  country \noperations business plan, Sri Lanka (2010\u20132012). \n \n7. \nIn conjunction  with the  project,  an  associated  TA  is proposed to  develop the capacity of \nthe Northern Provincial Road Development Department (NPRDD) to effectively manage Northern \nProvince's provincial road network. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nIn  support  of  the  country  partnership  strategy,  the  project  impact  will  be  balanced  and \ninclusive growth in Northern Province. The project's immediate outcome will be improved road \nconnectivity within Northern Province and with the southern region of the country. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n9. \nThe project outputs are (i) approximately 170 km of national roads in Northern Province \nand  NCP  are  rehabilitated;  (ii)  approximately  140  km  of  provincial  roads  in  Northern  Province \nare rehabilitated, and selected bridge links are rehabilitated or replaced; and (iii) NPRDD offices \nare rehabilitated. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $173  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  about  \n$18.6  million  to  be  financed  by  the  government.  The  total  cost  includes  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  implementation.  The  detailed  cost \nestimates  by  expenditure  category  and  detailed  cost  estimates  by  financier  are  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM). The investment plan is summarized in Table 1. \n \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $130  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n11. \nresources  to  help  finance  civil  works  for  national  roads  and  recurrent  costs  for  project \nmanagement and consulting services, and a loan of SDR 16,080,000 ($24.4 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s  Special Funds resources to help finance civil works for provincial roads, recurrent \ncosts for project management, and equipment-vehicles. \n \n12. \nThe  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and other \nsuch terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Eastern and North Central \nProvincial Project. Manila (Loan 2546-SRI, for $70 million, approved on 16 September). \n\nSource: Government of Sri Lanka. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nDomestic  preference.  Although  Sri  Lanka's  current  annual  gross  national  income  per \n17. \ncapita  (formerly  gross  national  product)  is  above  the  eligible  threshold,9 the  government  has \nrequested domestic preference under international competitive bidding to facilitate the country's \npost conflict recovery by encouraging participation of the domestic construction industry. During \nthe  conflict  period,  the  domestic  construction  industry  suffered  from  limited  opportunities  and, \nmore recently, the fallout from the global financial crisis. Many contractors are facing a difficult \noutlook  and  there  is  a  potential  of  losing  permanent  technical  staff  due  to  migration.  As  the \nreconstruction  in  the  north  begins,  the  government's  priority  is  to  ensure  opportunities  for  the \ndomestic  contractors  who  now  have  the  necessary  capacity  as  well  as  knowledge  of  local \nconditions.  In  support  of  the  government's  request,  the  project  proposes  to  use  a  domestic \npreference  of  7.5%  in  evaluating  civil  works  under  international  competitive  bidding  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).10 The \nproject's  eligibility  for  domestic  preference  is  being  proposed  in  consideration  of  the \nrecommended  approach  to  engaging  with  Weakly  Performing  Countries  (WPC). 11 While  Sri \nLanka  is  no  longer  considered  a  WPC,  the  country  is  emerging  from  a  prolonged  period  of \nconflict and the economy of the northern region in particular does exhibit weak performance due \nto  its  post  conflict  fragility.  The  domestic  preference  will  help  ensure  opportunities  for  local \ncontractors to recover and strengthen. It will also contribute to a harmonized approach among \ndonors,  as  the  World  Bank,  which  uses  the  identical  eligibility  threshold,  is  currently  providing \nsimilar domestic preference for works for road transport projects in Sri Lanka. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n18. \nThe  percentage  of  maintainable  roads  in  Northern  Province,  although  very  small  at \npresent, will rise in time as more roads are rehabilitated to maintainable conditions. Therefore, \nin conjunction with the  project, capacity development TA will be provided with the  objective of \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Northern  Provincial  Council\u2013Northern  Provincial  Road \nDevelopment  Department  (NPC\u2013NPRDD)  to  effectively  manage  and  maintain  the  provincial \nroad  network.  This  is  consistent  with  lessons  from  ADB's  previous  projects  on  the  need  to \nensure that provincial road development departments or agencies strengthen their capacity and \nutilize a systematic approach for road asset management. To maximize effectiveness,12 the TA \nwill  focus  on  NPC\u2013NPRDD,  as  ADB's  other  ongoing  project13 is  strengthening  the  capacity  of \nthe Road Development Authority (RDA). The TA will carry out the following activities: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nEngage a TA consultant by June 2011. \nPrepare  a  capacity  development  plan  by  September  2011,  which  includes \nimproved  organizational  arrangements,  optimized  staffing  allocation  and \n\n                                                 \n9   Current limit set in the World Bank OM (OP3.10 \u2013 Annex D) is $975 and Sri Lanka's annual GNI is $1,780. \n10  Bidding  for  the  national  road  packages,  which  will  be  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding,  will \n\ncommence upon ADB Board approval of the proposed domestic preference. \n\n11  ADB.  2007.

The estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) range from 20.1% to 24.1% \nfor  national  road  sections.  The  sensitivity  analysis  with  adverse  variation  in  project  costs  and \nproject benefits17 also indicates that the national road sections have an EIRR above 12% even \n                                                 \n14  One vehicle (double cap utility type) will be procured under the TA to carry out road inventory and condition survey.  \n15  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n16 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n17 Sensitivity  factors:  15%  decrease  in  project  benefits  (vehicle  operating  cost  and  travel  time  savings),  and  15% \n\nincrease in project cost individually and in combination \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nwith increased costs and reduced benefits. The EIRRs for provincial roads range from 12.8% to \n49.9%. The overall estimated EIRR for the provincial road component is 21.3%. The sensitivity \nanalysis of the provincial road component resulted in an EIRR above 12% in all sensitivity tests. \nA few of the provincial road sections, individually, may have an EIRR below 12% if there is an \nadverse  variation  in  costs  and  benefits.  However,  these  provincial  road  sections  provide \nessential  accessibility  to  the  rural  and  poor  population  in  the  interior  areas.  Based  on  the \nfindings  of  the  economic  assessment,  the  proposed  improvements  under  the  project  are \neconomically viable and sustainable, and are justified in social cost\u2013benefit terms. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nPolicy and legal. RDA, the implementing agency for the national road component, was \nestablished  by  the  Road  Development  Authority  Act  in  1981.  Under  the  Ministry  of  Highways \n(MOH),  RDA  is  responsible  for  the  development  and  maintenance  of  the  national  highway \nnetwork comprising the class A and class B trunk roads. RDA is headed by a chairperson who \nreports  to  the  secretary  of  MOH.  NPC,  the  implementing  agency  for  the  provincial  road \ncomponent, in accordance with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution,18 is responsible for the \ndevelopment and maintenance of Northern Province's provincial road network comprising class \nC and D roads. NPC\u2013NPRDD carries out the functions for planning and executing rehabilitation \nand  improvements.  NPRDD  is  headed  by  a  provincial  director  who  reports  to  Northern \nProvince's  chief  secretary  through  the  secretary  of  MIDR.  Northern  Province  was  a  conflict-\naffected region and still does not have an elected council, but elections are expected to be held \nvery  soon.  This,  however,  is  not  anticipated  to  affect  project  implementation  as  the  chief \nsecretary  of  Northern  Province,  who  is  the  chief  executive  officer  with  wide  provincial \nadministrative  authority,  will  chair  the  project  coordinating  committee,  which  is  responsible  for \nmonitoring  provincial  project  implementation.  This  is  similar  to  the  arrangement  adopted  for \nADB's ongoing project in neighboring Eastern Province.19 \n \nInstitutional  capacity.  NPRDD's  capacity  has  been  supplemented  through  the  project \n23. \npreparatory stage with support provided by the ongoing ADB Road Project Preparatory Facility \n(footnote  8).  NPRDD's  capacity  for  implementation  will  be  supported  by  the  provision  of  a \nproject  implementation  consultant  who  will  assist  with  the  supervision  of  works.  For  long-term \ncapacity  strengthening,  a  piggy-backed  CDTA  will  be  provided  to  enhance  organizational \neffectiveness  with  respect  to  developing  and  maintaining  the  provincial  roads.  RDA  has \nsufficient capacity, past experience, and institutional strength to implement the project.20 \n \nFinancial  management.  Financial  management  assessment  was  carried  out  for  the \n24. \nimplementing  agencies\u2014RDA  for  the  national  road  component  and  NPC\u2013NPRDD  for  the \nprovincial  road  component.  RDA  has  prior  and  ongoing  experience  with  implementing  ADB-\nfunded  projects  and  has  satisfactory  capacity  in  terms  of  project  financial  accounting  and \nknowledge  of  ADB  disbursement  procedures.  Within  the  project  implementation  unit  for  the \nnational road component, RDA will establish a dedicated project accounting and finance team \n\n                                                 \n18  An important milestone in the long-term solution to the conflict, the 13th Amendment to the Constitution attempts to \ndecentralize administration by devolution. It established nine provincial councils and granted them powers to plan, \nexecute, and manage selected functions. \n\n19  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance  Grant  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Eastern  and  North  Central  Provincial \nProject. Manila (Loan 2546-SRI, for $70 million, approved on 16 September). \n\n20  RDA was established in 1981 and has been undergoing reform and institutional strengthening with assistance from \nADB's  Road  Sector  Development  Project  (Loan  1986-SRI),  completed  in  December  2009,  and  the  ongoing  ADB \nNational Highways Sector Project (Loan 2217-SRI). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nwith  suitably  qualified  accountants:  a  project  accountant,  an  assistant  accountant,  and  three \naccount clerks. NPC\u2013NPRDD does not have recent experience with externally funded projects \nand  necessary  capacity  strengthening  will  be  carried  out  before  and  during  implementation. \nWithin  the  project  implementation  unit  for  the  provincial  road  component,  NPC\u2013NPRDD  will \nestablish  a  dedicated  project  accounting  and  finance  team  with  suitably  qualified  accountants \ncomprising a project accountant and two management accountants. This team will be provided \nwith training and guidance by MLGPC staff who have practical knowledge of ADB disbursement \nguidelines and procedure. NPC\u2013NPRDD's capacity will be strengthened during implementation \nunder  the  capacity  development  TA,  by  implementing  a  financial  management  information \nsystem that includes accounting software, networked computers, and training.  \n \n25. \nBoth  RDA  and  NPC\u2013NPRDD  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  project  records  and \naccounts  to  identify  the  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  for  the  project, \nensuring an adequate audit trail. The government's Office of Auditor General will annually audit \nthe  project accounts and  related  financial statements  in  accordance  with  international  auditing \nstandards.  To  further  minimize  any  risks,  ADB's  direct  payment  procedure  will  be  utilized  for \nsubstantial disbursement of payments for works, goods, and consulting services. \n \n26. \nProcurement and anticorruption. Procurement of goods and works will be carried out \nin  terms  of  the  relevant  ADB  guidelines,  with  prior  reviews  by  ADB  at  key  steps  in  the \nprocurement process. The Bribery Act, No. 11 of 1954 (as amended), the Declaration of Asset \nand  Liabilities  Act,  No.  1  of  1975,  and  Permanent  Commission  to  Investigate  Allegations  of \nBribery and Corruption Act, No 19 of 1994, provide a strong legal basis to deal with bribery and \ncorruption. The Permanent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption is \nconducting  decentralized  bribery-related  investigations  in  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  to \ncoincide  with  large  amounts  of  post-conflict  development  assistance  and  investment.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment,  executing  agencies  (MOH  and  MLGPC),  and  implementing  agencies  (RDA  and \nNPC-NPRDD). The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nImproving road access within the project area and connectivity to other provinces in the \n27. \ncountry  are  expected  to  develop  and  expand  agriculture,  fishing,  commercial  activities,  and \nother  services.  The  beneficiary  group  includes  subsistence  farmers,  poor  fisherfolk,  small \ntraders,  and  other  services  providers.  The  project  will  have  positive  social  and  economic \nbenefits for all ethnic groups in the project area. The project does not have substantive gender \nissues  as impacts  and  benefits  will  apply  equally  to  men  and  women.  The  project  will  provide \nequally positive benefits for both genders in terms  of improved access to schools, health care \ninstitutions,  and  other  services.  The  contracts  for  civil  works  will  include  measures  to  ensure \nsafe and healthy working environment for both men and  women laborers. The contractors will \nbe  required  to  implement  appropriate  measures  with  respect  to  compliance  of  equal  pay  for \nequal work for men and women, health and safety at construction sites and labor camps, and \nawareness program for workers on prevention of HIV. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n\n \n28. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB's  new  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). During the project preparatory studies and assessments, project strip \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nplans, based on cross sections, were prepared and verified the project boundaries and limits of \nthe  new  construction.  Based  on  this,  the  improvement  works  are  envisaged  to  be  within  the \nexisting right-of-way boundaries. However, if a land acquisition requirement is identified during \nimplementation,  such  as  small  strips  of  land  adjacent  to  the  road  that  could  affect  some \nproperties, including boundary walls, business establishments, crops and trees, home gardens, \nor other resettlement impacts, the following steps will be taken; (i) assess whether any type of \npermanent or temporary displacement\u2014physical or economic or both\u2014will take place because \nof the project, (ii) formulate a resettlement plan in consultation with affected peoples and other \nstakeholders  for  approval  by  ADB  and  disclosure  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  resettlement \nframework  and  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  (iii)  implement  the  resettlement  plan. \nThe  construction  activities  may  proceed,  after  these  requirements  are  met  satisfactorily.  The \nproject is not expected to have impacts on Indigenous Peoples and, therefore, is categorized as \nCategory C. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  the  environment,  and  initial  environmental \n29. \nexaminations  (IEEs),  in  accordance  with  ADB's  new  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  were \nconducted for each of the identified roads. Based on the findings of the IEEs, the project does \nnot give rise to any significant adverse impacts that are irreversible, diverse, or unprecedented. \nAll  impacts  can  be  managed  through  the  adoption  of  suitable  mitigation  measures,  which  are \ndescribed in the respective IEEs and environmental management plans (EMPs),  which will be \nincorporated in the contract documents. Typical impacts associated with road construction work, \nsuch as dust generation, temporary disruption to traffic, temporary disruption of access to those \nliving in areas adjoining work areas, and soil erosion from exposed surfaces, can be mitigated \nthrough  measures  described  in  the  IEEs  and  EMPs.  The  main  environmental  concern  is  the \navailability of suitable borrow and quarry sites within the project area. Most of the suitable sites \nare  located  outside  Northern  Province,  which  may  results  in  long  haulage  distances.  The \nimplementing  agencies  will  ensure  that  sites  selected  as  borrow  and  quarry  sites  will  have \nsufficient  material  to  cater  to  the  project  needs,  while  not  compromising  the  requirements  of \nexisting users within the area where the sites are located, and that haulage will be done along \nroads approved by respective local authorities to ensure that the roads have sufficient carrying \ncapacity for such haulage. While the project envisages using borrow and quarry sites already in \noperation,  if  any  new  sites  are  to  be  opened  the  implementing  agencies  will  ensure  that \nmeasures  described  in  the  EMPs  are  adopted  during  selection  and  site  closure,  and  relevant \napprovals from the respective authorities are obtained. The project road improvement proposals \nhave  been  approved  by  the  Central  Environmental  Authority,  and  its  recommendations  were \nincorporated  in  the  EMPs  and  bidding  documents.  The  public  were  consulted  during  project \npreparation and consultations will continue throughout implementation. \n \nRDA  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  EMPs  are  implemented  in  the  national  roads \n30. \ncomponent.  The  Environmental  and  Social  Division  under  RDA  will  monitor  environment \ncompliance  by  the  contractors  on  behalf  of  RDA.  To  ensure  adequacy,  the  project \nimplementation  consultant  team,  including  an  environment  specialist,  will  supplement  the \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Division\u2019s  field  monitoring.  For  the  provincial  roads,  NPC,  through \nNPRDD, will be responsible for ensuring implementation of the respective EMPs. Since NPRDD \ndoes not have adequately skilled staff, the project implementation consultant team, including an \nenvironmental specialist, will help NPRDD monitor environmental compliance. \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and \n\n31. \nmitigating measures are summarized in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n32. \nThe government, MLGPC, MOH, NPC, and RDA have assured ADB that implementation \nof  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n33. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreements.  \n \n\nThe government, MOH, and MLGPC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n34. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $130,000,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for \nthe  Northern  Road  Connectivity  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources, \nwith  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board; and \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR  16,080,000  to  the  Democratic \nSocialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Northern  Road  Connectivity  Project  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and \nproject agreements presented to the Board. \n\n \n35. \nI  also  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  proposal  set  out  in  paragraph  17  of  this \nreport  that  a  domestic  preference  of  7.5%  when  evaluating  civil  works  under  international \ncompetitive  bidding  be  applied  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) for the Northern Road Connectivity Project. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n17 May 2010\n\n                                                 \n21 Risk assessment and risk management plan (Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nImpact \nBalanced and \ninclusive growth in \nNorthern Province \n \n\nBy 2018: \nPer capita annual income in \nNorthern Province increases \nfrom $952 to $1,688 and \npercentage of national average \nfrom 50% to 80% \n \n\nPublications of the \nMinistry of Finance and \nPlanning \n \nPublications of the \nMinistry of Local \nGovernment and \nProvincial Councils \n\nOutcome \nImproved road \nconnectivity within \nNorthern Province \nand to the southern \nregion of the country. \n\nOutputs  \n \n1.
