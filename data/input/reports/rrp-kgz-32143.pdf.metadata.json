The  Project  is \ndirectly  relevant  to  the  human  development  needs  of  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic \nthe  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive \nDevelopment Framework and Education Strategy for 2010. It will \nalso  contribute  to  the  attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals (MDGs) to reduce infant mortality rate (IMR) and under-five \nmortality  rate  (U5MR)  and  sustain  universal  primary  education. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  the  12  poorest  raions  (districts),  while \nensuring that the extended program of immunization will cover the \nneeds  of  all  eligible  children  in  the  country.  In  addition  to \ninterventions  in  health,  nutrition,  and  education,  the  Project  will \npay  special  attention  to  building  the  capacity  of  the  ayil  okmotus \n(AOs\u2013village  authorities)  and  communities  to  plan,  improve,  and \nsustain child development. \n \nYoung  children  suffer  most  in  times  of  economic  contraction. \nInternational  research  shows \nthat  poverty  has  measurable \ndetrimental  effects  on  children\u2019s  physical  growth,  cognitive \ncapacity,  and  psychosocial  adjustment.  Long-term  impacts  are \nmost  severe  when  children  are  unprotected  in  the  years  before \nthey enter school. Health, nutrition, and education directly impact \nthe  lives  of  young  children  in  poor  families.  Targeted  programs \nthat  integrate  health,  nutrition,  and  education/care  for  young \nchildren offset the deleterious effects of poverty. Without targeted \ninterventions,  the  majority  of  children  in  poverty  will  not  develop \nfully  in  their  early  years,  thus  permanently  diminishing  their \ncapacity  to  achieve  their  potential.  Recent  years  have  seen \ndeclines  in  budgets,  coverage,  and  quality  of  social  services, \nparticularly  in  rural  and  remote  areas.  Remote  health  posts  and \nschools  are \ntraining \nopportunities. Basic indicators on child development in the Kyrgyz \nimprovement.  Early \nRepublic  show  substantial  scope \nchildhood  development  (ECD)  has  important  implications  for \nwomen  as  well  since  their  lives  are  closely  intertwined  with  their \nchildren\u2019s.  ECD  interventions  will  reduce  women\u2019s  time  spent  on \ncaring for sick children. Increased access to affordable preschool \nprograms  will  enable  women  to  avail  themselves  of  economic \nopportunities.   Reduction   of   iron   deficiency  anemia  (IDA) will  \n\nfrom  supplies  or \n\nto  benefit \n\nlast \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n\fObjectives and Scope \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\niii \n\nimprove  women\u2019s  productivity,  and  reduce  pregnancy-related \nrisks, including maternal mortality. \n \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  health,  nutrition,  and \npsychosocial  development  of  children  between  birth  and  8  years \nof  age  in  the  12  poorest  raions.  Specific  objectives  are  to  (i) \nreduce IMR and U5MR, (ii) reduce iodine deficiency disorder, (iii) \nreduce  IDA  both  among  children  and  pregnant  women,  and  (iv) \nimprove  the  psychosocial  development  of  preschool  children.  By \nimproving  children\u2019s  health  and  nutrition  status  and  increasing \naccess to preschool programs, the Project can increase women\u2019s \neconomic  opportunities  outside  the  home.  The  Project  will \ncontribute  to  the  attainment  of  the  MDGs  to  reduce  IMR  and \nU5MR  and \nto  achieve  universal  primary  education.  The \ncomponents and the strategies adopted under each follow: \n \nThe child health and nutrition component will (i) ensure universal \nimprove  case \ncoverage  and  quality  of \nmanagement \nimprove \nfunctioning  of  primary  health  care  posts,  (iv)  universalize \nconsumption of iodized salt, and (v) introduce behavioral change \nto  prevent \nIDA.  The  early  childhood  care  and  education \ncomponent  will  (i)  improve  access  of  poor  children  to  preschool \nprograms, \nincluding  state-run  preschools  and  community \npreschool programs; (ii) improve the quality of grade 1 education; \nand  (iii)  improve  the  quality  of  child  care  at  home.  The  capacity \nbuilding  component  will  (i)  develop \nlocal \ngovernments  and  communities  to  plan,  implement,  and  monitor \nECD  activities,  and  (ii)  improve  collection  of  community  and \ncentral government data and monitoring of development indicators \nfor young children between birth and 8 years of age. \n\nfor  major  childhood  morbidities,  (iii) \n\nthe  capacity  of \n\nimmunization, \n\n(ii) \n\n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $13.47  million  equivalent.  The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  $10.5 \nmillion  equivalent  from  its  Special  Funds  resources,  representing \n78% of the total project cost. The Government will provide $2.57 \nmillion  equivalent,  and  communities  will  contribute  $0.40  million \nequivalent by sharing the cost of community projects.   \n \n\n \n\n     \nSource  \n   Asian    \n   Development Bank \n   Government \n   Communities  \n \n\n \n\n     5,383 \n            0 \n            0 \n \n\n($\u2019000) \n\nForeign \n\nLocal \n\n  Total  Percent \n\nExchange Currency   Cost  \n\n \n\n    \n     5,117 \n10,500  \n     2,570      2,570  \n        400         400  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n    \n13,470  \n\n   78\n19\n3\n\n 100\n\n  \n \n \n\nTotal \n\n     5,383 \n\n     8,087 \n\n\fLoan Amount and Terms  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  of \nSDR7,545,000  equivalent from its Special Funds resources, with \na maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and an \ninterest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period,  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 30 June 2009 \n \n31 December 2008 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\niv \n\n \n\nthe  President\u2019s  office  has  been  selected  as \n\n \nTo ensure strong leadership to coordinate the different ministries \nthe \ninvolved, \nExecuting  Agency.  The  President\u2019s  office  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for project coordination and implementation, and will \nappoint  a project coordinator  from  among  its  senior  officials.  The \nProject will establish a project management office in Bishkek. An \ninteragency  steering  committee  will  give  advice  and  decide  on \npolicy matters. Many project activities will be implemented by AOs \nand  communities.  To  support  decentralized  implementation,  a \nproject coordination office will be established in each of the three \nparticipating oblasts.   \n \nThe President\u2019s Office \n \nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment will be procured by \n(i)  international  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  valued  at \n$500,000  or  more;  (ii)  international  shopping  for  contracts  below \n$500,000;  and  (iii)  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  or  direct \npurchase for items valued at less than $50,000. Due to the small \nand  scattered  nature  of  civil  works,  rehabilitation  of  physical \nfacilities  will  be  carried  out  through  LCB.  Furniture,  some \nequipment, and learning materials are produced locally. Domestic \nproduction  capacity,  quality,  and  prices  are  satisfactory.  Such \nitems  will  be  procured  through  LCB.  Vaccines  will  be  procured \nthrough  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  under  arrangements \nsatisfactory to the Ministry of Health and ADB. \n \nADB-financed  consulting  services  by  firms  or  individuals  will  be \nawarded  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Consulting  services  financed  under  the  loan  will  be \nfor  project  management  and  capacity  building  for  the  local \nadministration.  A  total  of  665  person-months  of  consulting \nservices  (23  international  and  642  domestic)  will  be  required  in \nmanagement,  finance,  procurement,  information  system,  early \nchildhood  care  and  education,  primary  health  care,  community \nplanning  and  mobilization,  evaluation,  and  architecture/ \nengineering. \n \n\n\fProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nv \n\nDirect  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  are  about  148,000  children \nbetween  birth  and  8  years  of  age  in  the  12  poorest  raions.  In \naddition,  support  for  immunization  will  benefit  all  infants  in  the \ncountry.  The  Project  will  directly  enhance  the  development  of \nchildren and their future productivity.  \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  child \ndevelopment  services.  Some  services  in  the  health  sector  have \nbeen unable to achieve their full potential due to gaps in training \nand irregular supply of essential drugs. By bridging the gaps, the \nProject  will  improve  the  effectiveness  of  existing  services  at \nminimal  additional  cost.  The  Project  will  also  improve  the  cost-\nefficiency  of  early  education  programs  by  introducing  alternative \ncommunity-based  models  to  complement  formal  preschools,  and \nimproving child care at home.  \n\nThe  Project  will  build  the  capacity  of  the  AOs  and  communities. \nMany project activities will be implemented at the community level \nand  managed  by  AOs.  This  focus  on  AOs  and  communities  will \nimprove  governance  by  bringing  activities  closer  to  the  intended \nbeneficiaries,  and  facilitate  the  achievement  of  project  objectives \nby providing\u2013through a village initiative fund\u2013opportunities for the \ncommunities  to  design  and  implement  activities  that  meet  their \nneeds.  \n\nThe  Project  involves  almost  no  technical  risk.  The  selected \ninterventions have been tested and proven effective in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and internationally. The most significant challenge will be  \neffective  implementation  through  multiple  ministries  and  central \nand local government  bodies. A steering committee consisting of \nexperienced  representatives  of  concerned  ministries  and  oblasts \n(provinces) has been established and will provide policy guidance \nto the Project. The Project provides for substantial training of AO \nrepresentatives and assistance of the child and family coordinator \nduring the first 2 years of project implementation. \n \nAnother  challenge  is  sustainability  of  the  services  after  the \ncompletion of the Project. Maintaining the quality of primary health \ncare and preschool programs will require predictable, timely, and \nadequate budget allocations. Recurrent costs will be about 1% of \nthe national health and education budget. The Project will ensure \nthat  the  Government  develops  sustainability  plans  for  vaccines \nand essential drugs, which are the major needed supplies. \n \n\n\fvi \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nfor \n\nto  help \n\nthe  Government \n\nInstitutional  Strengthening \n\nfor \nTechnical  assistance \nCommunity-Based  Early  Childhood  Development  aims  to  fill  the \nmajor institutional and capacity gaps so that the Government can \npursue an effective ECD Program. The main objectives of the TA \n(i)  develop  an  updated \nare \ncomprehensive  strategy  for  ECD;  (ii)  develop  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation  system  for  ECD;  and  (iii)  introduce  parent  education \nmodels  to  improve  child  care  practice  at  home.  The  TA  will \nfinance  consulting  services  for  13  person-months  of  international \nconsultants,  and  54  of  domestic  consultants  with  expertise  in \nECD;  preschool \ninformation,  education,  and \ncommunication;  and  evaluation  and  monitoring.  The  total  TA \namount is estimated at $600,000 equivalent comprising $378,000 \nin  foreign  exchange  and  $222,000  equivalent  in  local  currency \ncost. ADB will provide $500,000 as a grant from the Japan Special \nFund  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan  to  finance  the  entire \nforeign exchange costs and $122,000 equivalent of local currency \nexpenditures.

The \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Institutional  Strengthening  for \nCommunity-Based Early Childhood Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nYoung  children  suffer  most  in  times  of  economic  contraction.  International  research \n2. \nshows that poverty has measurable detrimental effects on children\u2019s physical growth, cognitive \ncapacity, and psychosocial adjustment. The long-term impacts of these effects are most severe \nwhen  children  are  unprotected  during  the  years  before  they  enter  school.  Targeted  programs \nthat  integrate  health,  nutrition,  and  education/care  for  young  children  offset  the  deleterious \neffects  of  poverty.  Without  targeted  interventions,  the  majority  of  children  in  poverty  will \nexperience inadequate development in their early years, permanently diminishing their capacity \nto achieve their potential.   \n \n3. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  a  population  of  5  million,  about  22%  of  whom  are  below  8 \nyears  of  age.  The  per  capita  income  is  about  $300,  the  second  lowest  among  Central  Asian \ncountries,  and  poverty  is  prevalent.  According  to  the  National  Statistical  Committee,  40%  and \n47% of the population live in poverty in urban and rural areas, respectively. The health, nutrition, \nand education sectors have direct impacts on the lives of young children in poor families. These \nsectors  were  funded  centrally  during  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU)  and,  until  its  final  years, \nwere relatively protected. The Kyrgyz Republic had achieved a high level of education and had \ndeveloped  extensive  education  and  health  care  networks  before  independence.  However, \nbudgets,  coverage,  and  quality  of  services  have  declined  in  recent  years.  Rural  and  urban \ndisparities  are  widening.  Scarce  resources  are  concentrated  in  the  major  cities  and  towns; \ntraining and supplies reach remote, impoverished rural health posts and schools last.  \n \nSocial  indicators  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  show  the  effects  of  increased  poverty  and \n4. \ndeclining  public \nthe  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  (MDGs)  to  which  both  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  subscribe  may  be  at  risk.  Major  efforts  will  be  required  especially  to  meet  the \ntargets  of  reducing  infant  mortality  rate  (IMR)  and  under-five  mortality  rate  (U5MR)  and \nsustaining  universal  primary  education  by  arresting  the  problem  of  increasing  dropouts.  The \nProject seeks to help the Government improve health, nutrition, and psychosocial development \nof young children and attain the MDGs. The Project framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n5. \nThe IMR remains high in the Kyrgyz Republic despite almost universal literacy and high \nlevels of attended births (95% of deliveries take place at health facilities supervised by trained \nmedical staff). Government statistics in 2001, which use the Soviet definition of live birth, show \nthat IMR was 21.7 and U5MR was 29.7. According to the 1997 Demographic and Health Survey \n(DHS)  that  used  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  standard  definitions,  IMR  was  61.3  and \nU5MR  was  72.3.  Both  the  Government  and  DHS  figures  on  the  IMR  and  U5MR  were  much \n\nin  child  development.  Achieving  by  2015 \n\ninvestment \n\n\f2 \n\nhigher than the European average.1 The DHS figures place the Kyrgyz Republic in the group of \nlower human development countries with weak health care systems and lower literacy. \n   \n6. \nChildren\u2019s nutrition status has deteriorated since independence. In addition to a general \nincrease  in  poverty,  the  reduced  availability  of  food  subsidies  targeted  at  children  and  meals \nformally  provided  through  preschools  has  eliminated  key  nutrition  sources  for  young  children. \nThe  collapse  of  the  production  and  distribution  of  fortified  food  has  increased  micronutrient \ndeficiency.  According  to  DHS,  the  prevalence  of  stunting,  which  is  highly  correlated  with \nreduced cognitive performance, reached 29% and 30% in Osh and Naryn oblasts (provinces), \nrespectively. The prevalence of iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) is increasing. The Government \nreports  that  the  number  of  IDD  cases  has  increased  by  8-10  times  in  the  last  10  years. \nInternational  research  has  clearly  and  consistently  demonstrated  that  an  average  of  13  IQ \npoints is lost in iodine-deficient children living in areas where goiter is endemic.2 Iron deficiency \nanemia  (IDA)  is  also  highly  prevalent:  48.5%  of  children  below  3  years  of  age  and  38%  of \nwomen  were  anemic  in  1997.  Women  with  IDA  face  a  higher  risk  of  pregnancy-related \ncomplications  that  contribute  to  higher  maternal  mortality  ratio.  Mothers  with  IDA  give  birth  to \ninfants whose psychomotor and cognitive skills are diminished or developmentally delayed.  The \nschool performance of children with IDA, is also affected. Among adults, productivity losses due \nto  IDA  have  been  estimated  at  5-17%  depending  on  the  kind  of  work.  Overall,  micronutrient \nmalnutrition in developing countries costs at least a 5% loss of gross domestic product.3 \n \n7. \nMany  young  children  have  not  benefited  from  psychosocial  development  opportunities \nand  primary  school  dropouts  are  increasing.  Prior  to  independence,  preschool  institutions \ncomprising full-day nurseries and kindergartens offered a package of child nutrition, health, and \neducation  services  free  of  charge  to  more  than  a  third  of  preschool-age  children.  However, \nmany  preschool  institutions  have  been  closed down.  Rural  areas  are  especially  hard  hit.  Only \none  third  of  operating  preschools  are  located  in  rural  areas.  The  surviving  preschools  have \nstarted  charging  small  fees  to  compensate  for  reduced  state  support  and  have  become \nunaffordable to poor children. In 2000, only 7.1%, 3.6%, and 2.3% of preschool-age children in \nJalal-abad,  Osh,  and  Naryn,  respectively,  attended  preschool.  Parents  have  not  been  able  to \nreplace  the  functions  of  preschools.  Parents  in  rural  areas  lack  knowledge  of  child  care \npractices to stimulate children\u2019s psychosocial development, and have little time or inclination to \ncommunicate or play with their children. A study conducted during Project preparation revealed \nthat many young children in the Kyrgyz Republic are left unattended for most of the day. Four- \nyear olds were with some caretaker only for 5 hours a day and spend the rest of the day alone.  \n \nBefore,  extensive  preschool  coverage  resulted  in  children  joining  the  formal  school \n8. \nsystem already able to read and write. In contrast, most children now enter grade 1 unprepared \neither academically or socially. The average age at school entry has declined: in 1991, 27,200 \n6-year-olds entered grade 1, and in 1999, 40,000 did. This suggests that grade 1 is increasingly \nserving as kindergarten and a school preparation class. The result is added pressure on grade 1 \nteaching.  According  to  the  Government\u2019s  2000  Education  for  All  Report,  the  primary  school \ncompletion rate is only 85%. This lower-than-expected completion rate is at least partly due to \nlack of preparation for school at entry. Children who attend preshool are more likely to complete \nprimary school and show higher school achievement. \n\n                                                 \n1  The average IMR of Europe is 12.8 in 1996 (WHO).  \n2  Bleichrodt,  N.  and  M.

Enriching  Lives:  Overcoming  Vitamin  and  Mineral  Malnutrition  in  Developing  Countries. \n\nDevelopment in Practice Series. \n\n\f3 \n\nThe condition of poor young children and their families and deteriorating public services \n9. \nfor children require effective early childhood development (ECD) programs. Investment in ECD \nbenefits not only children and their families, but also society as a whole. Society benefits from \ngreater productivity in later life. Investment in ECD can reduce the needs for and cost of future \nsocial  welfare  programs,  and  public  expenditures  in  the  health  care  system.  Children  who \nbenefit  from  health  and  nutrition  interventions  and  preschool  experiences  are  more  likely  to \nenroll  and  persist  in  school,  to  be  healthier,  to  need  fewer  social  protection  or  criminal  justice \nservices,  and  to  earn  higher  incomes  as  adults.  Research  shows  a  positive  correlation  of  ill \nhealth  as  a  child,  with  physical  impairments  and  health  problems  later  in  life,  all  of  which  are \nburdens on health services. ECD also addresses an important societal concern of equity. ECD \nhas larger impacts on deprived children than better-off children and contributes to narrowing the \ndifferences  in  development  at  the  beginning  of  life  among  children  of  various  economic \nbackgrounds.  This  is  especially  important  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  other  FSU  countries \nwhere economic inequality is widening.  \n \n10. \nECD also has positive impacts on women, especially mothers, since mothers and child \nhealth are closely intertwined. Improvements in child health results in less time needed to care \nfor sick children and reduced costs of health care. Aside from the obvious benefits of improved \nhealth  for  both  mothers  and  children,  ECD  interventions,  especially  increased  availability  of \npreschools,  enable  women  to  access  economic  opportunities  outside  the  home.  Provision  of \npreschools releases women from full-time child care, and gives them opportunities to participate \nin  the  labor  market  and  earn  incomes.  Reduction  of  IDA  among  pregnant  women  reduces \npregnancy-related risks and contributes to overall improvement of women's health. \n \nThe Government has long recognized the importance of child development. The Law on \n11. \nProtection  of  the  Kyrgyz  People\u2019s  Health  clearly  stipulates  the  state\u2019s  responsibility  for \nprotecting  children\u2019s  right  to  living  conditions  required  for  sound  physical,  cognitive,  and \npsychosocial  development,  and  the  obligation  of  citizens  to  take  care  of  children\u2019s  health, \nphysical, cognitive, and psychosocial development. Investing in ECD is directly relevant to the \nbasic human development needs of the Kyrgyz Republic as stated in the Government\u2019s poverty \nreduction strategy and also the Education Strategy for 2010.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n12.  While the problems associated with ECD in the Kyrgyz Republic are challenging, most of \nthem  have  well-established  remedies.  The  Project  will  select \nthe  most  cost-effective \ninterventions in the areas of health, nutrition, and early childhood care and education consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Education  (2002),  and  Policy  for  the  Health  Sector  (1999).  ECD  is  a \npriority  subsector  under  the  education  policy.  The  health  policy  prioritizes  support  for  primary \nhealth care that benefits the poor and identifies priority, cost-effective health interventions. The \nsector/subsector analysis is presented in Appendix 2.   \n \n13.  \n Child  Health.    According  to  Government  data,  the  major  causes  of  infant  deaths  are \nacute respiratory infections and diarrhea\u2013diseases that were responsible for 38.2% and 12.4% \nof all infant deaths in 2001. Causes of under-five deaths follow the same pattern. Child deaths \ndue to these diseases can be prevented by quality primary health care. In the Kyrgyz Republic, \nprimary  health  care  providers  consist  of  FAPs  (primary  health  care  posts)  and  Family  Group \nPractices  (FGPs).  FAPs  have  feldshers  (primary  health  care  workers)  and  midwives  and  are \noften  the  only  health  care  providers  located  in  remote  villages.  FGPs  have  medical  doctors  in \nplace.  They  provide  primary  health  care  services  to  people  and  supervise  the  FAPs.  While \nFGPs  have  received  assistance  under  other  projects  in  recent  years,  FAPs  have  been \n\n\f4 \n\nneglected. Therefore, to reduce child mortality in rural areas, improving the FAPs will be crucial. \nImmunization  is  arguably  the  most  important  means  to  prevent  infant  deaths.  The  Kyrgyz \nRepublic has maintained universal immunization for children, relying on vaccines funded by the \nGovernment  of  Japan  and  the  Global  Alliance  for  Vaccines  and  Immunization.  However,  this \nassistance is due to end in 2004. Given its fiscal constraints, the Government will need interim \nfinancial  support  to  sustain  universal  immunization.  The  Integrated  Management  of  Childhood \nIllnesses (IMCI) program was developed by WHO and UNICEF to efficiently reduce the severity \nof major childhood illnesses and deaths due to illnesses among children less than 5 years old. \nIMCI has been piloted in three raions, but not on a large scale for lack of resources. \n \n14. \nChild Nutrition. The most effective means to prevent IDD and IDA is to promote use of \niodized  salt  and  iron  fortification  of  staple  food.4  Since  2001,  ADB  has  been  administering  a \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  project  for  improving  nutrition  of  women  and \nchildren.5 The Project has contributed to production of iodized salt and iron-fortified wheat flour \nof  good  quality,  enforcement  of  the  universal  salt  iodization  law,  and  increased  public \nawareness  of  the  importance  of  using  iodized  salt  and  fortified  food.  The  Government \nintroduced  the  National  Program  for  Reduction  of  IDD  for  2003-2007  (approved  9  December \n2002)  to  accelerate  actions  to  prevent  IDD.  The  main  objectives  of  the  program  are  to  (i) \nachieve compulsory salt iodate fortification and refortification; (ii) increase the percentage of the \npopulation  consuming  iodized  salt  to  95%;  (iii)  prevent  industrial  salt  use  for  human \nconsumption;  (iv)  conduct  social  mobilization  for  IDD  prevention;  and  (v)  train  primary  health \ncare providers on IDD prevention, diagnosis and treatment. \n \n15. \nEarly  Childhood  Care  and  Education.  Expanding  early  childhood  education  is  a \npriority  of  the  Government  Strategy  on  Education  Development  to  2010.  The  number  of \npreschools  will  be  increased  and  the  curriculum  will  be  reformed.  The  FSU  model  of  full-day, \nfull-service  nurseries  and  kindergartens  is  expensive  and  beyond  the  financial  means  of  the \nGovernment and poor families. Pedagogy used at the conventional preschools also need to be \nupdated  and  made  more  child-centered.  Several  alternative  preschool  programs  have  been \npiloted  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic6  and  the  Project  will  support  systematic  development  of \nalternative  preschools  in  the  community  or  at  home  to  extend  the  access  of  poor  children  to \npreschools,  and  improve  grade  1  teaching.  The  combination  of  increasing  preschool \nopportunities  and  better  grade  1  teaching  will  contribute  not  only  to  children\u2019s  psychosocial \ndevelopment  but  also  to  increasing  the  primary  school  completion  rate  and  learning \nachievement.  Even  with increased availability of preschool programs, families will continue to \nbe  the  primary  child  care  providers,  and  the  quality  of  child  care  at  home  will  have  significant \nimpacts  on  child  development.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  also  aim  to  improve  child  care \npractices at home. \n \n16. \nExternal  Assistance.  Several  international  organizations  are  supporting  different \naspects  of  ECD,  focusing  on  either  child  health  or  programs  (Appendix  3).  Major  partner \norganizations  including  the  World  Bank,  UNICEF,  WHO,  and  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency were regularly consulted during project preparation.   \n\n                                                 \n4 Dietary diversification through a broad-based food policy and supplementation for high-risk groups remain options in \nan integrated strategy for eliminating micronutrient malnutrition, but both have limitations. \n5  ADB.  2001.  Grant  assistance  to  Azerbaijan,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan, \nfunded  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  for  Improving  Nutrition  of  Poor  Women  and  Children  in  Asian \nCountries in Transition. Manila. \n6  For  example,  Mothers  Schools,  Summer  Preparatory  Courses,  programs  assisted  by  Step  by  Step,  Save  the \nChildren-UK, Bilingual Education, and Global Education Institute. \n\n\f5 \n\nLessons  Learned  and  Special  Features.  The  Project  has  three  distinct  design \n17. \nfeatures:  integrated  ECD,  multisectoral  and  decentralized  implementation,  and  community-\nbased  interventions.  Health,  nutrition,  and  education  are  interactive  determinants  of  child \ndevelopment, and programs to optimize child development should integrate these features. The \nintegrated ECD interventions have been found to be more effective than isolated single sector \ninterventions. Most ECD interventions by the Government or international organizations remain \nisolated  and  narrowly  focused  pilots,  small  in  scale,  often  covering  only  a  few  raions.  The \nProject will consolidate successful pilot interventions as an integrated package of ECD services, \ntake  them  to  scale,  and  coordinate  multiple  agencies  to  achieve  tangible  effects.  The \nexperience of ADB-financed ECD projects in the Philippines shows that strong leadership at the \nnational  Government  level  is  crucial  in  leading  a  multisectoral  ECD  project,  and  also  that \nactivities entrusted to local governments are more likely to progress than those handled by the \ncentral  government.  The  President\u2019s  office  has  been  selected  to  be  the  Executing  Agency  to \nlead this multisectoral Project and to coordinate different ministries. A substantial part of project \nactivities  will  take  place  at  the  ayil  okmotu  (AO,  village  authority)  level.  The  AO  and  the \ncommunity will be entrusted with organizing community-based preschools. AO and community \ninitiatives will be supported by providing grants from a village initiative fund (VIF). This model is \nbased on a positive experience of the discretionary fund under the ADB-financed Social Service \nDelivery Project in the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe  goal  of  the  Community-Based  Early  Childhood  Development  Project  is  to  improve \n18. \nhealth, nutrition, and psychosocial development of children between birth and 8 years of age in \nthe 12 poorest raions. Specific objectives are to (i) reduce IMR and U5MR, (ii) reduce IDD, (iii) \nreduce  IDA  both  among  children  and  pregnant  women,  and  (iv)  improve  psychosocial \ndevelopment of preschool children. The Project will contribute to attaining the MDGs to reduce \nIMR  and  U5MR  and  achieve  universal  primary  education.  The  Project  will  also  contribute  to \nincreasing  women\u2019s  economic  opportunities  outside  the  home  by  improving  children\u2019s  health \nand nutrition status, and increasing access to preschool programs.  \n \n19. \nThe  Project  has  three  components.  The  child  health  and  nutrition  component  will  (i) \nensure universal coverage and quality of immunization, (ii) improve case management for major \nchildhood  morbidities,  (iii)  improve  functioning  of  primary  health  care  posts,  (iv)  universalize \nconsumption  of  iodized  salt,  and  (v)  introduce  behavioral  change  to  prevent  IDA.  The  early \nchildhood care and education component will (i) improve access of poor children to preschool \nprograms  including  state-run  preschools  and  community  preschool  programs,  (ii)  improve  the \nquality  of  grade  1  education,  and  (iii)  improve  the  quality  of  child  care  at  home.  The  capacity \nbuilding component will (i) develop the capacity of local governments and communities to plan, \nimplement,  and  monitor  ECD  activities;  and  (ii)  improve  data  collection  and  monitoring  of \ndevelopment indicators for young children between birth and 8 years of age from the community \nto the central Government levels. \n\n \n\n20. \nThe  Project  will  target  poor  children  between  birth  and  8  years  of  age.  Using  poverty \nstatistics,  the  Project  will  target  the  12  poorest  raions  with  poverty  rate  above  69%  in  2001.7 \n\n                                                 \n7  Ak-Tala, At-Bashy, Jumgal, Kochkor, and Naryn raions in Naryn oblast; Chatkal, Toktokul and Toguz-Toro in Jalal-\n\nAbad oblast; and Alay, Kara-Khulja, Chon-Alay, and Nookat raions in Osh oblast. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nAbout 148,000 children are expected to directly benefit from the integrated interventions in the \nproject raions, while about a million children will benefit from immunization in the entire country. \nThe profile of the project raions are in Appendix 4. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nChild Health and Nutrition \n\n \n\na. \n\nSustaining Universal Immunization of Children \n\n \nExpected outputs of the component are (i) sustained universal immunization of children \n21. \nin the country, (ii) expanded use of IMCI, (iii) universal use of iodized salt by households, and \n(iv) rehabilitated primary health care facilities.  \n \n \n \n22. \nThe Project will support the purchase of vaccines and procure equipment necessary for \nmaintaining  an  effective  cold  chain  from  participating  raion  centers  (i.e.,  principal  towns)  to \nprimary health care facilities. The Government will be accountable for maintaining the cold chain \nfrom  the  vaccines'  point  of  entry  to  the  country  to  the  raion  centers,  and  for  ensuring  an \nadequate  supply  of  power  to  primary  health  care  facilities.  Considering  the  importance  of \nimmunization  in  containing  IMR  and  infant  morbidity,  the  Project  will  finance  the  national \nrequirements  of  vaccines  for  an  extended  program  of  immunization  (EPI)  from  2005  to  2008, \nand provide refrigerators at primary health care facilities and the Sanitary and Epidemiological \nServices.   \n \n \n \n23. \nIMCI  reduces  the  mortality  of  children  between  6  months  and  5  years  of  age  by \naddressing the common causes of child mortality\u2013acute respiratory infections and diarrhea\u2013and \nmitigating  malnutrition.  The  Project  will  support  the  training  of  primary  health  care  workers \n(feldshers) on IMCI in the project raions. In addition to the main clinical and nutrition module, the \ncare module that will promote psychosocial development of children will be included as part of \nIMCI  training.  Piloting  of  the  care  module  has  started  with  support  of  UNICEF  and  WHO,  and \nthe  Government  will  adopt  the  IMCI  care  module  by  the  end  of  2003.  While  training  the  FGP \ndoctors  on  IMCI  will  be  primarily  the  Government\u2019s  responsibility,  the  Project  will  provide  for \ntraining  about  25  doctors  in  the  targeted  raions.  The  Project  will  also  support  essential  drugs \nand medical supplies required by FAPs to implement IMCI. Essential drugs at FAPs have been \nin short supply, although the situation is gradually improving. The Government has introduced \ncorrective  measures  including  the  cofinancing  of  essential  drugs  by  the  Mandatory  Health \nInsurance  Fund  (MHIF).  However,  it  will  take  the  Government  some  time  to  allocate  sufficient \nfunds for the MHIF, and to increase the availability of pharmacies in rural areas. Therefore, the \nProject\u2019s support is necessary as an interim measure.  \n \n\nReducing Child Mortality \n\nb. \n\n \n\nc. \n\nReducing IDD and IDA \n\n \nThe Project will support the national program for reduction of IDD. It will finance social \n24. \nmobilization, especially monitoring of iodized salt by communities and retailers. The Project will \nprovide  salt  testing  kits,  and  information,  education,  and  communication  (IEC)  materials.  \nCommunity  salt  monitoring  has  been  piloted  in  Naryn  oblast  by  the  Swiss  Red  Cross  and  the \nJFPR project. It has increased awareness of the importance of iodized salt and the availability of \niodized salt in the market. Support  for IDA reduction consists of iron supplements\u2013iron tablets \nfor children and women and syrup for young children\u2013as part of the essential drug package, and \n\n\f7 \n\nIEC activities. IEC will promote diets that would increase iron intake and absorption, discourage \nbehaviors  that  inhibit  iron  absorption,  and  advocate  implementation  of  nutrition  policies.  IEC \nmaterials  on  IDD  and  IDA  which  were  developed  under  the  JFPR  project  and  by  other  aid \nagencies will be utilized in this Project.  \n \n\nd. \n\nRehabilitation of Primary Health Care Facilities \n\n \n2. \n\n25. \nEquipment  and  facilities  in  FAPs  are  in  serious  disrepair  and  affect  the  quality  of \nservices for children. The maintenance of the primary health care facilities is the responsibility of \noblast  governments,  which  often  lack  financial  resources.  This  subcomponent  will  aim  at \nrehabilitating  the  FAPs,  which  need  major  repair.  It  is  estimated  that  120  FAPs  at  most,  need \nmajor  repair.  The  Project  will  also  finance  the essential  equipment  in FAPs,  which  need  to  be \nreplaced in the project raions.  \n  \n \n \n26.  Major outputs of this component are (i) new community or home based preschools, (ii) \nimproved grade 1 education, (iii) improved child care practices at home, (iv) revised standards \nfor preschool programs, and (v) rehabilitation of currently operating kindergartens and a limited \nnumber  of  grade  1  classrooms.  Community  or  home-based  preschool programs  will  serve  not \nonly  as  instrument  to  impart  psychosocial stimulation  activities  to  children  but  also as  efficient \nmeans to health and nutrition education.  \n \n\nEarly Childhood Care and Education \n\na. \n\nCommunity and Home-Based Preschools \n\n27. \nThis subcomponent will help communities to develop cost-effective preschool programs.  \nThe  Project  will  support  (i)  child  and  family  coordinators  (CFCs)  who  will  work  with  AOs, \nmobilize  communities,  and  initiate  preschool  programs  in  the  community;  (ii)  one  resource \nkindergarten  per  raion  as  a  resource  center  for  community  or  home-based  preschools;  (iii) \nproviding  instructional  materials  and  supplies  necessary  for  children's  activities,  and  other \nnecessary  supplies  to  AOs;  and  (iv)  training  for  teachers  of  kindergarten  preparatory  courses, \nand  community  or  home-based  preschools,  and  monitoring  their  performance.  The  Ministry  of \nEducation  and  Culture  (MOEC)  will  select  one  resource  kindergarten  in  each  raion  among \ncurrently  operational  kindergartens.  The  resource  kindergartens  will  have  complete  lending \nlibraries  of  reference  materials  for  other  kindergartens  and  community  or  home-based \npreschools and will be used as training sites. Kindergartens that will serve as hub kindergartens \nto  advise  and  supervise  a  group  of  community  or  home-based  kindergartens  will  also  be \nprovided with learning materials and in-service teacher training.    \n \n \n \n28. \nThis  subcomponent  will  improve  the  quality  of  grade  1  in  primary  schools,  and  ensure \nuniversal enrollment and completion of grade 1. Textbooks and learning materials are in short \nsupply in many primary schools, and many grade 1 teachers have not received regular refresher \ntraining. The Project will provide (i) complete sets of textbooks and learning materials for grade \n1 pupils and (ii) in-service training for grade 1 teachers.  \n                         \n                        c. \n \n29. \nThis subcomponent aims at improving child care practice especially parents\u2019 knowledge \nof  and  skills  in  child  care.  The  Project  will  support  development  of  an  IEC  strategy  for  better \n\nImproving Child Care Practice \n\nImproving Grade 1 \n\nb. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nchild  care,  production  of  IEC  materials,  and  training.  IEC  will  focus  on  building  awareness  of \nfamily  impacts  on  ECD,  feasible  activities  at  home  for  psychosocial  development  (e.g.,  verbal \ninteraction,  reading,  and  play),  and  nutrition  education.  This  component,  complementing  the \nactivities  for  reducing  IDD  and  IDA,  will  provide  a  comprehensive  package  of  key  nutrition \nmessages  covering  exclusive  breastfeeding,  complementary  feeding,  use  of  iodized  salt,  and \nintake  of  iron  supplements.  Parent  education  materials  will  be  developed  by  a  working  group \ncomprising representatives of MOEC, Ministry of Health (MOH) and other experts, assisted by \nan international consultant.      \n \n \n \n30. \nStandards  and  regulations  for  preschool  programs  have  not  been  updated  since \nindependence  and  need  major  updates.  MOEC  proposes  to  develop  new  standards  for \npreschool  programs  including  state  kindergartens  and  nurseries,  community/home  based \npreschools, preparatory courses, and preschools run by nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nor  the  private  sector  that  meet  world  standards.  The  Project  will  support  the  development  of \nstandards by providing an international consultant for the advisory TA to work with the working \ngroup appointed and led by MOEC. \n \n\nDeveloping Standards for Preschool Programs \n\nd. \n\n \n\ne. \n\nRehabilitating of Grade 1 Classrooms and Kindergartens \n\n \n31. \nSome schools and kindergartens need repair to create a safe learning environment for \nchildren.  The  Project  will  support  rehabilitation  of  selected  grade  1  classrooms  and \nkindergartens.  About  30  kindergartens  and  50  grade  1  classrooms  will  need  major  repair.  \nMOEC  will  select  the  50  schools  based  on  geographic  accessibility,  quality  of  teachers,  and \npossibility of offering preparatory courses for preschool children. The 30 kindergartens for major \nrehabilitation  work  will  be  selected  based  on  the  need  for  repair  and  capacity  to  support \ncommunity-based preschools. \n \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Building \n\n32. \nThis  component  will  develop  the  capacity  of  AOs  and  committees  to  improve  ECD  by \nplanning  and  managing  ECD  activities,  and  strengthen  the  Government  capacity  to  monitor \nindicators  of  child  development.  The  outputs  of  the  component  are  (i)  community-based \nactivities  for  improving  ECD  financed  by  the  VIF,  (ii)  strengthened  capacity  of  AOs  and \ncommunities to plan and carry out activities for child development with the assistance of CFCs, \nand (iii) improved monitoring of child development indicators. \n\n \na. \n\nStrengthening AO\u2019s Capacity \n\n \nThe  AO\u2019s  capacity  to  plan  and  implement  project  activities  will  be  strengthened  by \n33. \ntraining on management and by CFCs. CFCs will be selected on a competitive basis from the \nlocality  and  hired  on  a  contractual  basis  for  2  years  and  supported  by  the  Project.  Their  main \ntasks are to (i) assist the AO to develop work plans for project activities carried out at the AO \nand  community  levels,  (ii)  mobilize  and  help  communities  establish  a  child  development \ncommittee and identify needs of their children, (iii) initiate new preschool and child activities, (iv) \nmanage  the  IEC  campaign,  (v)  review  the  project  activities  conducted  at  AO  or  community \nlevels,  (vi)  monitor  performance  indicators  and  prepare  project  progress  reports.  The  outline \nterms of reference of CFCs is attached as Appendix 5. CFCs are meant to support the AOs and \ncommunities  during  the  initial  stage  of  the  Project,  which  requires  intensive  community \nmobilization  and  IEC  activities.  After  2  years,  CFCs'  work  will  be  transferred  to  existing  social \n\n\f9 \n\nworkers  or  another  category  of  workers,  which  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection \n(MLSP)  is  piloting  in  a  few  raions  and  is  planning  to  introduce  more  widely  in  the  future. \nOtherwise, AOs will support the CFCs from their own budget. The Project will support training of \nCFCs  and  social  workers  on  community  mobilization,  essential  topics  on  child  development, \nproject activities and administration. \n \n\nb. \n\nVillage Initiative Fund \n\n \n\nc. \n\nMonitoring ECD Indicators \n\n \nThe  VIF  subcomponent  will  provide  the  AO  and  communities  with  financial  resources \n34. \nand opportunities to address their specific needs in ECD. Funds will be made available over 5 \nyears for the projects in the project raions that will have a direct, tangible, and positive impact on \nchildren between birth and 8 years of age. Communities will be eligible to apply for VIF financing \nthrough AOs; each application should not exceed $5,000. Project raions or  groups of AOs that \nwish  to  implement  a  project  that  will  benefit  children  across  different  AOs  can  apply  for  VIF \nfinancing  through  the  raion  administrations.  In  this  case,  each  application  should  not  exceed \n$15,000  dollars.  The  community  will  share  20%  of  the  project  cost:  10%  in  cash  and  10%  in \nkind.  The  operational  framework  of  the  VIF  is  presented  in  Appendix  6.  VIF  will  become \noperational within 3 months of project effectiveness. \n \n \n \n35.  MLSP  has  been  conducting  the  Social  Passport  Survey  since  2000.  It  is  an  annual \nsurvey  to  update  the  database  on  the  economic  status  of  each  household  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic.    Social  workers  posted  at  AOs  visit  each  household  to  collect  data  on  household \nincome and other welfare indicators, which are used to facilitate targeting of social assistance \nprograms.  A  module  on  ECD  indicators  will  be  added  to  the  standard  Social  Passport  Survey \nquestionnaire  under  the  Project,  which  will  allow  key  project  output  indicators  for  ECD  to  be \nregularly  monitored.  The  data  from  AOs  will  first  be  compiled  at  the  raion  Social  Protection \nDepartment; sent on to the oblast administration, which will compile the data for the oblast; and \nthen  submitted  to  the  central  Government.  The  results  of  analysis  will  be  fed  back  to  the \nconcerned ministries, oblast and raion administrations, and AOs. To ensure quality survey data, \nthe Project will support data management training for social workers in the targeted raions and \nMLSP staff in the raion, oblast, and central Government who are responsible for management of \nsurvey data. The Project will also assist the Government in computerizing such data. Once the \nquality  of  data  enumeration  is  improved,  each  of  the  participating  raions  and  oblasts  will  be \nprovided  a  computer,  if  the  respective  government  agencies  agree  to  bear  recurrent  and \nmaintenance costs for the computers and data management. \n \n36. \nApart  from  the  regular  social  passport  monitoring,  surveys  will  be  conducted  at  the \nbeginning  and  end  of  the  Project  to  establish  the  baseline  and  end  values  of  ECD  indicators. \nThe  survey  will  be  designed  with  TA  to  allow  rigorous  evaluation  of  the  outcome  of  project \ninterventions.  \n \nC. \n \n37. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $13.470 million equivalent, including duties \nand  taxes.  Of  the  total,  $5.383  million  or  40%  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  including  $0.226 \nmillion  in  interest  charges;  and  $8.087  million  equivalent  (60%)  represents  the  local  currency \ncosts.

The  amount  will  finance  100%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$5.117 million equivalent of the local currency cost or about 63% of the local currency cost. The \nloan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The remaining $2.970 \nmillion  equivalent  as  counterpart  financing  or  22%  of  the  total  cost  will  be  contributions  of \nGovernment  ($2.570  million  for  all  taxes  and  local  recurrent  costs  for  maintenance  of \nrehabilitated facilities, equipment, and furniture) and of communities ($0.400 million for financing \nmaterials  and  labor  for  small  civil  works,  taxes  and  duties,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of \nproject facilities).

Further,  the  underdeveloped  financial  sector \nprevents  the  Government  from  mobilizing  domestic  private  savings;  consequently,  the \nGovernment  relies  on  external  assistance  to  finance  almost  the  entire  PIP.  A  relatively  large \nexternal  support  for  local  currency  costs  will  be  necessary  until  the  Government  overcomes \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB.1995.

The  President\u2019s  office  will  have \noverall  responsibility  for  project  coordination  and  implementation,  and  will  appoint  a  project \ndirector among its senior officials.  An interagency steering committee will meet at least once in \n3 months, and more often as necessary, to provide overall policy guidance, monitor the project \nactivities and outputs, and advise and decide on policy-related matters. The steering committee \nwill  consist  of  representatives  of  the  President's  office,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  MOH, \nMOEC, MLSP, and Ministry of Local and Self Government. A project management office (PMO) \nwill  be  established  under  the  President\u2019s  office  but  physically  located  outside  the  office  to  be \nmore  accessible  to  stakeholders.  An  oblast  project  coordination  office  (PCO)  in  each  of  the \nthree participating oblasts will be established within 1 month of project effectiveness. The PMO \nwill  oversee  day-to-day  project  management  and  implementation  and  be  responsible  for \nprocurement.  PCOs  will  be  situated  in  the  oblast  governments  and  assist  local  governments \n(raion  administrations  and  AOs)  in  planning  and  monitoring  project  activities.  The  PMO  in \nBishkek  will  be  (i)  staffed  by  domestic  consultants  including  a  project  manager,  procurement \nspecialist,  and  a  financial  specialist  and  an  assistant;  and  (ii)  also  assisted  by  domestic \nconsultants  on  primary  health  care/IMCI,  early  childhood  care  and  education,  community \nplanning  and  mobilization,  evaluation  and  information  system.  Each  of  the  three  PCOs  will  be \nstaffed with domestic consultants including a project coordinator, an assistant, and a part-time \narchitect  or  engineer.  The  Project  will  support  the  salary  of  the  consultants,  office  equipment \nand operational costs. The PMO will be assisted by an international management specialist on a \ndeclining basis over the project implementation period. The structure of project management is \nin Appendix 8. \n \n41.  MOH  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  child  health  and  nutrition  component. \nMOEC will be responsible for the early childhood care and education component while MOEC \nand  MOH  will  be  jointly  responsible  for  the  subcomponent  on  improving  child  care  practice. \nMLSP will be responsible for collecting data and monitoring ECD indicators through the regular \nSocial Passport Survey, and will, in consultation with AOs, develop a plan for sustaining CFC\u2019s \nwork without the Project\u2019s support. AOs will be responsible for organizing community and home-\nbased  preschool  programs,  and  mobilizing  and  assisting  communities  in  developing  and \nimplementing projects to be financed by the VIF.   \n \n \n \n42. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  starting  in  January  2004  and  ending  in \nDecember  2008.  In  the  first  year,  priority  will  be  given  to  making  arrangements  with  the \nconcerned  communities  to  start  rehabilitation  works  in  the  spring  of  2004  and  be  completed \nbefore  the  fall  of  2005.  Due  to  extreme  winter  weather  in  most  project  areas,  physical \nrehabilitation  work  will  occur  from  April  to  November.  Other  first  year  activities  will  comprise \nfielding  consultants;  recruiting  CFCs,  and  training  AOs,  CFCs,  and  social  workers;  reviewing \nbaseline data for monitoring and evaluation (M&E), detailed project planning; setting up imprest \naccounts for loan and counterpart funds; raion and community workshops for key implementing \nagents  (AOs,  teachers,  health  personnel,  social  workers);  and  developing  preschool  program \nstandards.  The  modest  start  will  allow  the  PMO  to  develop  and  test  project  procedures,  build \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n2. \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\ncapacity within local government units and enlist the cooperation of concerned communities in \nexecuting the works. The process of tendering for rehabilitation of structural components will be \nbased  on  surveys  and  detailed  work  plans.  Monitoring  of  civil  works  and  services  to  each \ncommunity  will  be  done  by  each  ministry  through  their  affiliated  departments  in  the  oblast \nadministrations,  assisted  by  AOs,  CFCs,  and  communities.  The  implementation  schedule is in \nAppendix 9. \n \n43. \nAn implementation plan for the first year covering all project activities will be submitted to \nADB  before  project  inception.  Subsequently,  the  PMO  will  prepare  an  annual  implementation \nplan covering all project activities by September of each year that will allow the Government to \nallocate counterpart funding in the following year\u2019s budget. The required information will include \n(i) a time schedule for all tasks, the duration and linking of tasks, and their estimated cost; and \n(ii) a list of projected contract awards and disbursements.  \n \n \n \nProcurement for ADB-financed goods and services will be carried out in accordance with \n44. \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The PMO will be responsible for overall procurement and, in \nconsultation  with  MOH,  MOEC,  and  MLSP  for  procurement  relevant  to  each  ministry. \nEquipment will be procured by (i) international competitive bidding (ICB) for contracts valued at \n$500,000  or  more;  (ii)  international  shopping  (IS)  for  contracts  below  $500,000;  and  (iii)  local \ncompetitive bidding (LCB) or direct purchase for items valued at  less than $50,000. ICB will be \nused  for  civil  works  contracts  over  $1,000,000.  Due  to  the  small  and  scattered  nature  of  the \nphysical facilities to be rehabilitated, civil works  will be carried out through LCB.  Major repairs \nwill  be  managed  by  the  PMO  through  contractors,  and  minor  rehabilitation  will  be  handled  by \ncommunities  under  the  VIF  with  20%  of  costs  shared  by  communities  in  kind  and  cash.  \nEssential drugs will be procured through ICB, and other health and education supplies through \nIS.  Furniture  and  some  equipment  and  learning  materials  (largely  classroom/FAP  furnishing, \ntextbooks  and  teaching  support  materials)  are  produced  locally  and  will  be  procured  through \nLCB. Domestic production capacity and quality are satisfactory and prices are reasonable. It is \nunlikely that foreign suppliers will be interested  in these small contracts. MOH and MOEC will \ndevelop distribution systems for essential drugs and textbooks, respectively, acceptable to ADB, \nthat will ensure transparent distribution of these goods to project beneficiaries, before disbursing \nthe loan funds for them. Indicative procurement packages are reported in Appendix 10. \n \n45. \nVaccines  will  be  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member  countries  through  UNICEF  under \narrangements  satisfactory  to  MOH  and  ADB.  Each  purchase  of  vaccines  will  be  subject  to \nADB\u2019s approval. The Kyrgyz Republic has been procuring EPI vaccines through UNICEF. Such \nprocurement  is  the  safest  and  most  economical  method  for  developing  member  countries  at \npresent.  WHO  controls  the  quality  of  vaccines  procured  through  UNICEF.  ADB\u2019s  research \nshowed that procurement of vaccines through by UNICEF is cost-effective.9    \n \n \n \nThe  project  will  provide  substantial  in-country  training,  totaling  about  300,000  person- \n46. \ndays. The training schedule has been designed to bring training as close as possible to actual \nproject activities. Training for health care personnel on IMCI, and in-service training for grade 1 \nand  kindergarten  teachers  will  take  place  in  the  oblasts;  training  for  CFCs,  social  workers, \nfeldshers, and community or home-based preschool teachers will take place in the raions; and \n\nTraining \n\n4. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2001.

Training on IMCI will be conducted by the State Medical Institute for \nContinuous Training, that has most of IMCI trainers as its staff and has been the main training \ninstitute  for IMCI.  Service  providers  for  training  the  CFCs  and  social  workers,  and  teachers  of \nkindergartens,  preparatory  courses,  and  community  or  home-based  preschools,  and  grade  1 \nteachers will be selected by the PMO in coordination with MLSP and MOEC, in accordance with \nprocedures acceptable  to  ADB  and  agreed-upon  terms  of  reference  (Appendix  12).  MLSP  will \ntrain its data management staff at the raion, oblast, and central levels on data management and \nanalysis, and social workers on Social Passport Survey data enumeration.  \n \n \n \nConsulting  services  by  firms  or  individuals  financed  by  ADB  will  be  selected  in \n47. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Consulting  services  financed \nunder  the  loan  will  be  for  project  management  and  implementation  support.  A  total  of  665 \nperson-months  of  individual  consulting  services  (23  international  and  642  domestic)  will  be \nrequired  in  management,  finance,  procurement,  early  childhood  care  and  education,  primary \nhealth  care/IMCI,  community  planning  and  mobilization,  evaluation,  information  system,  and \narchitecture/engineering.  Approximately  300  person-months  of  domestic  consultant  inputs  will \nbe allocated to PMO and PCO support services. International and domestic individual consulting \nservices will be engaged in accordance with the procedure satisfactory to ADB. The individual \ninternational  consultants  will  assist  PMO  staff  to  develop  appropriate  systems  for  project \nmanagement  and  train  the  PMO  and  PCO  staff  on  project  planning  and  management.  The \ninternational consulting services will be provided on a declining basis over the project period. At \nthe  end  of  each  year,  the  PMO  and  ADB  will  review  the  performance  of  both  domestic  and \ninternational consultants. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 13.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n48. \nThe  President\u2019s  office  will  set  up  the  PMO.  Before  loan  effectiveness,  key  consultants \nthat  will  staff  PMO  will  be  recruited:  a  project  manager,  financial  specialist,  and  procurement \nspecialist.  The  Project  will  retroactively  finance  the  costs  incurred  after  the  conclusion  of \nappraisal (18 June 2003) and related to advertising  posts, shortlisting, and placing the staff in \nthe PMO, and purchasing necessary office equipment not exceeding $200,000. However, ADB \nconcurrence  in  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the \nrelated expenditure under the Project, or to finance the Project. \n \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n7. \n \n49. \nAn imprest account will be established after loan effectiveness to facilitate disbursing the \nloan  proceeds.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  and  detailed  arrangements  between  MOF  and  ADB.  The  PMO  will \nopen  the  account  in  a  commercial  bank,  selected  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  initial \ndeposit in the imprest account will be 10% of the loan amount, or the estimated expenditures for \nthe next 6 months whichever is lower.  PCOs will assist oblast, raion, and AO administrations in \nformulating  project  activities  for  the  5-year  implementation  of  the  Project,  complete  with \nexpenditure  estimates  for  each  year  of  implementation.  These  budgets  will  be  reviewed  and \nupdated  quarterly.  All  budgets  will be  reviewed  and  approved  by  MOF  before  implementation. \nApproved  expenditures  will  be  recorded  at  source  by  the  PCOs  and  the  PMO.  The  PMO  will \napprove  and  supervise  all  disbursement  arrangements.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures \n\n\f14 \n\nprocedures  will  be  followed  to  liquidate  the  imprest  account  and  to  reimburse  individual \npayments that do not exceed $3,000 equivalent. \n\n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n50. \nThe  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation.  The  PMO  will  consolidate \nthe  reports  and  will  particularly  address \nimprovements in ECD indicators and the institutional development aspects of the Project. The \nquarterly progress reports will have information on the physical progress of rehabilitation work, \nstatus of ECD, compliance with loan covenants, organizational and financial issues, and actions \ntaken  or  planned  to  remedy  them,  and  the  proposed  program  of  activities  and  expected \nprogress in the next 6 months. The PMO will also report annually, the results of M&E based on \nthe  community  survey  conducted  by  social  workers.  Within  3  months  of  substantial  physical \ncompletion  of  the  Project,  PCOs  and  the  PMO  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report \nthat  will  cover  the  details  of  implementation,  cost,  M&E  activities,  and  other  information \nrequested by ADB. \n \n51. \nThe  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  recording  project  expenditures  based  on  its  own \nexpenditures  and  reports  of  expenditures  carried  out  by  PCOs.  The  PMO  will  report  project \nexpenditures monthly to MOF, with copies to ADB,  with quarterly and annual summaries. The \nimprest  account,  SOE  records,  statement  of  accounting  policies;  statement  of  income  (cash \nreceipts), statement of expenses (cash payments), cash flow statement; and notes to financial \nstatements will be audited at the end of each calendar year in accordance with the Guidelines \nfor  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  and  the  Loan \nAgreement. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nAn  integrated  system  of  data  collection  and  analysis  will  be  developed  to  monitor \n52. \nprogress in achieving the project objectives. Specifically the system will provide the Government \nand  ADB  with  the  data  and  indicators  to  monitor  project  inputs,  processes,  and  outputs  as \nprovided  in  the  project  framework  and  in  key  performance  indicators  and  to  assess  the \ntechnical, social, and economic impacts of the Project. The system will be sufficiently specific to \naddress the evaluation needs of the Project. Additionally, the project management information \nsystem will monitor the implementation of specific components; furnish evidence of project fund \noutlays,  including  the  entity  that  received  the  funds,  and  the  completion  status  of  the  funded \nactivities. ECD indicators will be collected through the Social Passport Survey. The Project will \nalso  conduct  baseline  and  evaluation  surveys.  The  surveys  will  be  designed  with  the  help  of \ninternational  and  domestic  evaluation  specialists  for  the  advisory  TA,  to  enable  rigorous \nevaluation of the project outcome.  \n \n53. \nThe  Project  will  conduct  qualitative  monitoring  of  project  activities.  MOH,  MOE,  and \nMLSP  will  be  involved  in  monitoring  the  technical  quality  of  activities  in  the  component  under \ntheir  responsibility.  Technical  specialists  of  each  ministry  will  visit  project  sites  together  with \nPMO  or  PCO  staff  and  report  the  findings  to  each  ministry,  PMO,  and  PCO.  There  will  be \nindependent monitoring and evaluation for the subprojects funded by VIF. At the end of years 2, \n3  and  4  of  project  implementation,  at  least  10%  of  randomly  sampled  subprojects  will  be \nreviewed and evaluated by a third party financed by the Project.   \n\n \n54.  Within  4  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMO  will  develop  and  submit  to  ADB  for \nreview  and  concurrence  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  M&E  and  for  preparing  baseline \n\n\f15 \n\ninformation.  Annual  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  through  the  PMO  throughout  project \nimplementation;  these  reports  will  include  indicators  of  project  completion,  delivery,  and \nbenefits.   \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n55. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  carry  out  project  supervisory  missions  every  6  months. \nBefore  each  ADB  visit,  the  President\u2019s  office  will  prepare  an  updated  progress  report.  ADB \nreviews  will  examine  records  of  M&E  activities  and  meet  with  central  and  local  Government, \ncommunity  leaders  and  Project  beneficiaries.  Within  2  years  after  project  effectiveness,  the \nGovernment and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review to (i) examine the scope, \ndesign,  implementation  arrangements,  and  other  relevant  issues  in  light  of  the  Government\u2019s \ndevelopment of ECD strategies and policies; (ii) assess the Project's progress and achievement \nof  the  objectives;  (iii)  identify  problems  and  constraints;  and  (iii)  recommend  any  required \nmodifications, restructuring, and reallocations.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nfor \n\nThe  TA \n\nInstitutional  Strengthening \n\n56. \nfor  Community-Based  Early  Childhood \nDevelopment aims to assist the Government in filling the major institutional and capacity gaps to \npursue  an  effective  ECD  program  in  the  long  run.  The  main  objectives  are  to  help  the \nGovernment  (i)  develop  an  updated,  comprehensive  strategy  for  ECD;  (ii)  develop  an  M&E \nsystem  for  ECD;  and  (iii)  introduce  parent  education  models.  Activities  planned  under  each \nobjective follow. (i) A task force will be constituted to develop an ECD strategy for the country, \nwith  the  help  of  international  specialists  that  have  expertise  in  global  and  domestic  ECD \npolicies. (ii) Data on ECD are scattered across different sector surveys and some indicators are \nsimply  not  available.  To  monitor  the  status  of  ECD  and  rigorously  evaluate  the  effects  of \nprojects/programs on ECD, proper information systems will be developed. An evaluation study \nframework  will  also  be  designed  at  the  beginning  of  the  Project  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  the \nproject  interventions.  (iii)  Parents  play  the  most  important  role  in  ECD,  especially  for  children \nbelow 3 years of age. The TA will support developing a comprehensive package of messages, \ntraining, and materials for parents' education on ECD. \n \n57. \nThe TA will last for 18 months starting in January 2004. It will finance 13 person-months \nof  international  consultants,  and  54  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  with  expertise  in \nECD,  preschool  standards,  and  project  evaluation  and  monitoring.  ADB  will  engage  individual \nconsultants  for  the  ECD  team,  and  a  consulting  firm  for  monitoring  and  evaluation,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A consulting firm will be selected \nby quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) and simplified proposals will be invited from short \nlisted firms. The Executing Agency for the TA is the President's office. TA consultants will work \nclosely with the PMO, and their outputs will be submitted to both PMO and ADB. The total cost \nof  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $600,000  equivalent  comprising  $378,000  in  foreign  exchange  cost \nand $222,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will provide $500,000 on a grant basis from \nthe  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan,  to  cover  the  entire  foreign \nexchange costs and $122,000 equivalent of the local currency expenditures. The Government \nwill  provide  the  remaining  $100,000  equivalent  in  kind.  Outline  terms  of  reference  and  cost \nestimates are in Appendix 14. \n \n\n\f16 \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n2. \n\ninvestments \n\nfamilies.  ECD \n\nStrengthening Local Self-Governance \n\n \n58. \nInvestment  in  ECD  results  in  improved  human  capital  in  the  long  run  and  high  future \nincomes of individuals. The investment is especially effective among children from economically \ntargeting  poor  children  will  help  prevent \ndisadvantaged \nintergenerational transfer of poverty. Large regional variations in the poverty rate and availability \nof poverty data at the raion level enabled the Project to adopt efficient geographic targeting of \nthe poor population. The 12 targeted raions are the poorest, with poverty rates above 69% as of \nJuly  2002.  Activities  under  the  Project  are  also  pro-poor,  focusing  on  primary  health  care  and \ncommunity-based activities in rural areas. Except for support for immunization, which covers the \nentire  child  population  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  activities  concentrate  at  community-level \ninterventions, including support for the FAPs the first health care contact point for the rural poor \nand preschool activities in rural communities. The combination of efficient geographic targeting \nand selecting pro-poor interventions will ensure that more than 50% of the project beneficiaries \nare poor.   \n \n \n \n59. \nThe AO is the lowest elected political body. At the level of the AO and the community, \nmany Project activities will be carried out and substantial training will be given. This focus on the \nAO and the community will help improve governance by bringing activities closer to the intended \nbeneficiaries,  and  improve  efficiency  by  giving  the  communities  opportunities  to  design  and \nimplement  through  the  VIF,  projects  catering  to  their  specific  needs.  The  experience  with  an \nADB-financed  ECD  project  in  the  Philippines  also  shows  that  activities  entrusted  to  local \ngovernments are more likely to progress than those handled by the central Government.    \n \n \n \nSome services in the health sector, such as IMCI, have not achieved their full potential \n60. \ndue  to  remaining  gaps  in  training  and  insufficient  supply  of  essential  drugs.  The  Government \nhas been able to mobilize resources for training FGP doctors on IMCI, but has not been able to \ntrain  feldshers,  who  are  the  first  health  care  contact  for  the  rural  population.  Essential  drugs \nnecessary  for  implementing  IMCI  have  not  reached  all  primary  health  care  providers.  Filling \nthese gaps, the Project is improving the effectiveness of existing services at minimal additional \ncosts. \n \nThe Project will also improve the cost-efficiency of preschools. Replicating existing state-\n61. \nrun  kindergartens  is  not  a  financially  viable  option  for  MOEC\u2019s  endeavor  to  increase  the \ncoverage  of  preschools.  The  annual  expenditure  per  child  in  state-run  kindergartens  ranged \nfrom  $60  to  $100  equivalent  in  2000.  The  Government  budget  that  covers  between  65%  and \n90% of the expenditure, depending on the oblast, mostly pays for teachers\u2019 salary.  By contrast, \nthe  Project  expects  that  the  annual  recurrent  expenditure  per  child  of  a  community  or  home-\nbased  preschool  will  be  $30-40  following  an  initial  $1,500-2,000  investment  in  equipment, \nfurniture, and learning materials.   \n \n \n \n\nImproved Effectiveness and Efficiency of Services \n\n3. \n\n\f17 \n\nAnalysis of Economic and Financial Sustainability \n\nB. \n \n62. \nThe Project is expected to directly benefit more than 148,000 children between birth and \n8 years of age in the 12 target raions. Over 20 years, the beneficiaries will total 484,000 children \nand 368,000 pregnant women. In addition, the immunization subcomponent will cover all infants \nin the Kyrgyz Republic. The economic benefits of the Project will come from (i) savings in health \nexpenditures due to fewer hospital visits, (ii) savings in education expenditures due to reduced \ngrade  repetition,  (iii)  productivity  gains  from  an  increased  life-span  and  reduced  mortality,  (iv) \nproductivity  gains  from  improved  education  achievements  especially  through  reduced  dropout \nrates,  (v)  productivity  gains  from  reduced  IDA,  and  (vi)  social  protection  benefits  through \nimproved social behavior. The estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project \nis 63.6%.  Because of practical difficulties in estimating them, the calculation did not include the \nbenefits  in  (vi),  or  the  benefits  to  children  outside  the  project  raions  but  who  benefit  through \nimmunization  and  improved  national  ECD  policies.  The  actual  return  will  be  higher  when  the \nexcluded benefits are factored in. The EIRR is highly sensitive to assumptions made, especially \nexternal  factors,  such  as  the  macroeconomic  situation  of  the  country,  which  will  determine \neconomic opportunities for the population. Therefore, even if the Project succeeds its achieving \nobjectives, the high EIRR may not materialize due to external economic factors. The economic \nanalysis is presented in Appendix 15.   \n \nThe Project avoids introducing new functionaries in the Government payroll or facilities \n63. \nto  be  sustained  by  the  Government  budget.  The  Project\u2019s  recurrent  costs  that  cover \nmaintenance  of  facilities,  equipment,  supplies  (vaccines,  essential  drugs,  and  education \nmaterials),  training,  and  monitoring  will  represent  less  than  1%  of  the  national  health  and \neducation budget over the forecast period of 20 years.10 The Project encourages cost sharing \nby the AO and the community. If their contributions are considered, the percentage will further \ndecrease.  Major  recurrent  costs  are  vaccines  and  essential  drugs.  The  Government  has \ncommitted  itself  to  financially  sustainable  procurement  of  vaccines.  Essential  drugs  will  be \nincreasingly  made  available  as  the  MHIF  improves  its  performance  and  more  pharmacies \nbecome available in rural areas. Therefore, sustaining the project activities beyond the project \nperiod is expected to be within the fiscal capacity of the Government.  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \nThe  Project  will  not  have  significant  adverse  environmental  effects.  Civil  works  are \n64. \nlimited to rehabilitating of existing health facilities, kindergartens or grade 1 classrooms in rural \nareas. The Project will not procure potentially hazardous medical supplies such as syringes and \nneedles.  The  Project  will  finance  mostly  preventive  medical  activities,  which  leave  almost  no \nmedical wastes. The Government also has a regulation on medical waste management. Project \nsupervision  will  closely  monitor  the  issue  of  medical  wastes  in  health  facilities  during \nimplementation and introduce corrective measures if a problem is found.   \n \n\n \n2. \n\nSocial Analysis \n\n \n65. \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  adverse  social  impacts.  A  social  analysis  undertaken \nduring project preparation involved various stakeholders. In addition to surveys, national, oblast, \n\n                                                 \n10  It  is  assumed  that  the  share  of  the  Government  budget  in  the  total  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  remains  the \n\nsame and that the GDP grows on average 4%. \n\n\f18 \n\nRisks \n\nand raion task forces have identified problems, opportunities, and available resources through \nconsultation  with  stakeholders  and  workshops.  The  Project  will  need  no  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement. Current ECD indicators including preschool attendance or health-seeking behavior \ndo not demonstrate gender inequality. Vulnerability, ECD indicators, and access to basic social \nservices in the Kyrgyz Republic vary by region, residence (rural or urban), and economic status. \nThere is no evidence that ethnicity determines vulnerability or disadvantage in access to basic \nsocial services. The summary poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 16.     \n \nD. \n \n66. \nThe  Project  involves  almost  no  technical  risk.  The  selected  interventions  have  been \ntested  and  proven  effective  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  internationally.  The  most  significant \nchallenge is the efficiency of implementation involving multiple ministries, both national and local \ngovernment  bodies,  and  the  AO.  The  AO  became  an  elected  body  only  recently,  and  its \ncapability  to  plan  and  manage  a  project  is  untested.  To  ensure  strong  leadership  and  to \neffectively coordinate policies and activities among different ministries, the President\u2019s office has \nbeen  selected  as  the  Executing  Agency.  The  President\u2019s  office  has  constituted  the  steering \ncommittee  comprising  representatives  of  concerned  ministries  and  project  oblasts  to  provide \npolicy  guidance.  The  Project  has  made  substantial  provisions  for  supporting  AOs  through \ntraining and CFCs during the first 2 years of project implementation.  \n \n67. \nAnother  challenge  is  sustainability  of  the  services  after  project  completion.  Maintaining \nquality  primary  health  care  and  preschool  programs  requires  Government  commitment  to \nallocate sufficient funds to carry out the ECD strategy and sector reforms. Supplies of essential \ndrugs  and  vaccines  will  be  the  major  items  of  recurrent  costs.  The  Project  will  help  the \nGovernment plan for these supplies.   \n   \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n68. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:   \n \n\n1. \n\nChild Health \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  FGP  doctors  and  feldshers  will  be  trained  on  IMCI, \n69. \nbased  on  the  IMCI  training  module  including  the  care  module,  in  accordance  with  the  training \nplan to be agreed upon with ADB.   \n \nBy the end of year 3 of project implementation, MOH will develop a plan satisfactory to \n70. \nADB  for  sustaining  universal  immunization  coverage,  IMCI  training  for  relevant  health \npersonnel, and supplying of essential drugs after the Project.   \n\n \n2. \n\nEarly Childhood Care and Education \n\n \n71.  MOEC  will  ensure  that  training  of  grade  1  teachers,  kindergarten  teachers,  and \ncommunity-based  preschool \nin \naccordance with a set of training guidelines to be developed under the TA.   \n \n\nteachers  will  be  conducted  by  appropriate \n\ninstitutions \n\n\f19 \n\n72.  MOEC will ensure that it will adopt the standard for preschools acceptable to ADB within \na year after loan effectiveness.    \n \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Building \n\n \n73.  Within 4 months after loan effectiveness, the President\u2019s office will adopt a project M&E \nplan acceptable to ADB. The key performance indicators agreed upon by the Government and \nADB will be used to evaluate the achievements and impact of the Project. \n \n74. \nA  baseline  survey  for  the  target  raions  will  be  carried  out  within  12  months  after  loan \neffectiveness,  and  its  findings  will  be  used  to  confirm  or  modify,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  the \nbase values and target values for the Project's key indicators. A survey will be carried out not \nlater than 6 months before the end of the implementation period to evaluate the achievements \nand impacts of the Project. The Government and ADB will conduct a joint midterm review of the \nProject in year 3 of project implementation. \n \nThe  President\u2019s  office  will  ensure  that  the  AOs  will  select  the  CFCs  through  a \n75. \ncompetitive  selection  process  and  recruit  CFCs  on  a  contractual  basis  for  the  first  2  years  of  \nproject implementation based on criteria agreed upon with ADB. \n \nBy  the  18th  month  of  the  CFCs\u2019  recruitment,  both  MLSP  and  AO  will  jointly  develop  a \n76. \nplan  on  how  to  sustain  the  work  of  the  CFCs  without  financial  support  from  the  Project  and \nsubmit the plan for ADB\u2019s consideration. \n \n77.  MOF will promptly allocate and transfer to MHIF the budgetary resources needed for the \nhealth insurance scheme covering children below 16 years of age. \n \n78. \nThe  President\u2019s  office  in  coordination  with  MLSP,  will  ensure  that  CFCs  and  social \nworkers will be trained by appropriate institutions selected according to criteria agreed upon with \nADB. \n \n79.  MLSP will ensure that the computers provided to the raions and oblasts will be utilized in \ncompiling  and  analyzing  the  data  of  the  Social  Passport  Survey  and  information  on  ECD \ncollected as part of the survey in the project raions. The Government will ensure that computers \nare  operated  and  maintained,  and  necessary  allocations  are  made  in  a  timely  manner  for  the \nrecurrent costs. \n \n80. \nThe  Government  will  enter  into  an  agreement,  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  the  recipient \ncommunities before disbursing funds from the VIF to finance the subprojects. The Government \nwill  ensure  that  not  less  than  20%  of  each  subproject\u2019s  costs  are  borne  by  the  recipient \ncommunity:10% in cash, 10% in kind. \n \n81. \nThe  final  decision  on  award  of  funds  from  the  VIF  will  be  made  by  the  PMO,  with  the \nassistance of the VIF evaluation subcommittee, and in accordance with criteria agreed upon by \nthe Government and ADB. \n   \n\nEnvironment   \n\n4. \n \nBy  year  2  of  implementation,  the  Government  in  consultation  with  ADB  will  review  the \n82. \nstatus of handling of medical wastes at FAPs, and introduce corrective measures if a problem is \nfound.   \n\n\fConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  project  director  has  been  appointed  and  that  key \n\nB. \n \n83. \ncontractual staff for the PMO have been selected. \n \n84. \nThe  President\u2019s  office  will  issue  the  order  that  will  specify  the  responsibility  of  MOF, \nMOEC, MOH, MLSP, and project oblast administrations, with respect to project implementation. \n \n85.  MOF will issue an order with respect to the establishment of the VIF.   \n \nC. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\n86.  MOH  and  MOEC  will  develop  distribution  systems  for  essential  drugs  and  textbooks, \nrespectively,  that  is  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  that  will  ensure  transparent  distribution  of  those \ngoods to project beneficiaries.   \n \n87. \nmanagement, scope, operations and reporting requirements of the VIF. \n \n\nThe  Government,  through  MOF,  will  promulgate  operational  regulations  covering  the \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n88. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  7,545,000  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Community-Based  Early \nChildhood Development Project from ADB's Special Funds resources with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n\n \n2 September 2003 \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nGoal \n \nImprove health, nutrition \nand psychosocial \ndevelopment of children \nbetween birth and 8 years \nof age in the 12 poorest \nraions \n\nPurpose \n \nImprove access of \nchildren to and quality of \nbasic child health and \nnutrition services \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nImprove access of \nchildren to and quality of \npreschools run by the \nstate, or based on \ncommunities or home \n \nImprove the capacity of  \ncommunities to plan and \n\nPerformance \nIndicators/Targets \n\n \n \nInfant mortality rate (IMR) \nin project raions (districts) \nreduced by 20% from \n2004 levels by 2009  \nUnder-five mortality rate \n(U5MR) in project raions \nreduced by 30% from \n2004 levels by 2009 \nPrevalence of iodine \ndeficiency disorder (IDD) \nin project raions reduced \nby 90% from 2004 levels \nby 2009 \nIron deficiency anemia \n(IDA) in project raions \nreduced among pregnant \nwomen by 30% from 2004 \nlevels by 2009 \nThe percentage of grade 1 \nchildren who pass the \nbasic literacy, \nmathematics, and life skill \ntest in project raions \nincreased by 30% from \n2004 levels by 2009 \n  \n \n \nSustained universal \nimmunization coverage \n \n \nBy 2009, increase by 50% \nof percentage of child \nillnesses, especially \ndiarrhea and acute \nrespiratory cases treated \naccording to Integrated \nManagement of Childhood \nIllnesses  (IMCI) \nguidelines \n \nBy 2009, increased to \n100% of percentage of \nhouseholds using iodized \nsalt  \n \n \nAt least 50% of children \nenter primary school after \npreschool (vs. against \nthose without any kind of \npreschool)  \n \nAt least 80% of aiyl \nokmotus (AOs) \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\n \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic maintains \nits commitment to child \ndevelopment. \n \nModest economic growth will \ncontinue and the poverty rate \nwill be contained. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nMonitoring  \nMechanisms \n\n \n \nStatistics of national, oblast, \nand raion governments \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProject baseline and \nevaluation survey at the last \nyear of the project \n\n \n \nSurvey by the Ministry of \nHealth (MOH)  \n \n \nThe monitoring reports by \nFamily Group Practices \n(FGPs)  \n \nRegular recording at primary \nhealth care posts (FAPs) \n \nAnnual household survey by \nsocial workers \n \nAnnual household survey by \nsocial workers \n \n \n \n \nSurvey by grade 1 teachers \n \n \n \n \n \nRegular reports by the project \nmanagement office (PMO) \n\n \n \nThe health reform efforts will \ncontinue. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMinistry of Education and \nCulture (MOEC) will maintain its \ncommitment to preschool \nreform. \n \n \nThe government maintains the \ndecentralization efforts. \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nmanage child \ndevelopment \n\nOutputs/Activities \n \n1.

Their  physical,  emotional,  social,  and  cognitive  development \nare  intertwined  and  cannot  be  addressed  in  isolation.  Health,  nutrition,  and  education  have \ndirect  impacts  on  the  lives  of  young  children  in  poor  families.  These  services  were  funded \ncentrally  during  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU)  and,  until  its  final  years,  were  relatively \nprotected.  However,  recent  years  have  seen  declines  in  budgets,  coverage,  and  quality  of \nservices.  Scarce  resources  are  concentrated  in  major  cities  and  towns.Training  and  supplies \nreach remote impoverished health posts and schools last, even though poverty rates are higher \nin rural areas than urban areas. \n \nB.  \n\nHealth, Nutrition, and Early Childhood Development \n\nThe  officially  reported  infant  mortality  rate  (IMR)  fell  during  the  1980s  and  1990s. \n2. \nNevertheless, the IMR remains high for a country with almost universal literacy and health care \ncoverage and places the Kyrgyz Republic in the league with poor countries with a weak health \ncare system. According to government statistics for 1983-1996, the IMR declined from 40 to 26 \nper 1,000 births in 1996. However, the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 1997, which \nfollowed  the  definitions  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  reported  an  IMR  of  61  per \n1000  live  births  based  on  the  international  standard  definitions  over  the  period  1992-1997 \n(Table A2.1). Official statistics reported IMR at 21.7 per 1,000 live births in 2001. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Infant and Child Mortality Rates by 5-Year Periods \n(per 1,000 live births) \n\nPost- \nNeonatal \nMortality \n29.7 \n36.2 \n55.2 \n\nYears \nPreceding  \nDHS \n0-4 \n5-9 \n10-14 \n\nPeriod \n\nNeonatal \nMortality \n\nInfant Mortality \n\nUnder-5 \nMortality \n\n1992-1997 \n1987-1992 \n1982-1987 \n\n31.6 \n34.6 \n26.8 \n\n61.3 \n70.8 \n82.0 \n\n72.3 \n79.2 \n99.0 \n\nDHS = Demographic and Health Survey. \nSource: 1997 DHS of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nThe  1997  DHS  also  found  that  25%  of  children  were  severely  or  moderately  stunted, \n3. \nreflecting  chronic  malnutrition;  and  3%  were  severely  or  moderately  wasted,  indicating  acute \nmalnutrition.  Children  aged  6-23  months  were  less  well  nourished,  reflecting  poor  diets  and \nillnesses  during  weaning.    Among  schoolchildren  52%  exhibited  iodine  deficiency  in  a  2000 \nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  study.  The  cognitive  deficits  caused  by  iodine \ndeficiency during pregnancy and early childhood are severe and permanent. Since the collapse \nof  the  FSU,  regulatory  frameworks  for  iodized  salt  have  failed.  The  supply  of  iodized  salt  is \nlimited.  Some  salt  marketed  as  iodized  is  not  iodized,  or  does  not  meet  minimum  standards; \nconsequently, consumer confidence and demand have been weakened.   \n \n4. \nThe problem of child malnutrition and reduced food consumption is severe in rural and \nremote  areas,  especially  in  eastern  and  southern  regions.  In  rural  areas  only  tea,  bread,  and \npotato are available for ordinary meals. Rates of moderate and severe anemia among children \nand  pregnant  women  have  risen.  Anemia  among  pregnant  women  was  16%  and  almost  one \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nquarter of children under the age of three suffered from moderate or severe anemia in 1997. A \n2001 UNICEF study in Naryn reported a rate above 40%. \n \n5. \nHealth sector investments have not grown sufficiently to meet these challenges. Health \ncare  expenditures  as  a  percentage  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  as  a  percentage  of \ngovernment  expenditures  have  declined  from  3.9%  to  2.1%  and  from  13.6%  to  11.5%, \nrespectively (Table A2.2). Expenditures on FAPs (primary health care posts), which service the \npoorest  and  most  remote  communities,  have  lagged  slightly  behind  other  categories  of  local \nexpenditure.  The  real  declines  in  community-based  health  services  seriously  threaten  the \ndevelopment  of  the  most  vulnerable  children.  Central  Government  expenditures  have  risen \nmore  than  local  expenditures  despite  reforms  that  are  explicitly  intended  to  decentralize \nresponsibilities for service delivery and financing. The Mandatory Health Insurance Fund (MHIF) \nwas  set  up  in  1996  to  improve  helath  care  financing.    In  1997,  the  fund  began  to  receive  \ninsurance  preimums  and  finance  health  care  services.    However,  MHIF  has  encoutered \ndifficulties. The revenue collecated was much lower, and received insufficient transfers from the \nGovernment.  \n \n \n\nTable A2.2: Health Care Expenditure Analysis, 1995-2000 \n \n\nItem \nHealth Sector as % of GDP \nTotal Government \nExpenditure (som million) \n\nHealth Sector \nHealth Sector Share (%) \nPrimary health care (PHC) \n     Polyclinics, Dispensary,     \n     Ambulance Station\uf02a \n     Primary Health Care Posts \nPHC/Health Sector (%)  \nFAP/Health Sector (%) \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \nC. \n\nTotal \nCentral \n Local \nTotal \nTotal \nLocal \n\n1995 \n          3.9 \n   4,611 \n   3,270 \n   1,913 \n      627 \n        13.6 \n        50.3 \n        40.2 \n\n1996 \n           3.1 \n    5,202 \n    3,746 \n    1,873 \n       733 \n         14.1 \n         58.8 \n         47.9 \n\n1997 \n           3.2 \n    6,696 \n    5,657 \n    2,136 \n       977 \n         13.7 \n         65.9 \n         55.1 \n\n1998 \n           2.8 \n    7,298 \n    6,128 \n    2,386 \n       962 \n         13.2 \n         70.5 \n         58.9 \n\n1999 \n           2.3 \n    9,312 \n    7,950 \n    2,809 \n    1,126 \n         12.1 \n         90.8 \n         75.8 \n\n2000 \n           2.1 \n  11,308 \n    9,697 \n    3,407 \n    1,296 \n         11.5 \n         99.3 \n         83.5 \n\nLocal \nLocal \n\n        10.1 \n        10.3 \n          2.1 \n\n         10.9 \n         11.1 \n           2.1 \n\n         10.8 \n         11.2 \n           1.8 \n\n         11.6 \n         10.7 \n           1.8 \n\n         15.0 \n         11.8 \n           1.9 \n\n        15.8 \n        11.4 \n          1.8 \n\nEducation, Child Care, and Early Childhood Development \n\n6. \nFollowing  independence,  many  kindergartens  were  closed  down  and  preschool \nenrollment declined overall from approximately 40% (for children 1-6 years old, with lower rates \nfor the youngest children and much higher rates for older children) to less than 10% nationwide \n(Table A2.3). Recent studies estimated a rate of approximately 16% in urban areas, 8% in raion \n(district) centers, and less than 5% in rural villages. Of the 468 kindergartens still in operation, \n63% serve cities and towns, 37% serve rural areas, generally raion centers rather than villages. \nThese  data  capture  only  state-supported  full-day  kindergartens  and  a  handful  of  private \nkindergartens.  Preschool  services  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  are  few  and \npreschool enrollments would not be materially altered if such schools were included.   \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nTable A2.3: Kindergartens and Enrollment, 1990-2000 \n \n\n  468 \n\n   639 \n\n   1,380 \n\n2000 \n45.6 \n\n1994 \n 58.9 \n\n1920 \n   143.2 \n\n1993 \n     92.2 \n998 \n\n1991 \n     144.7 \n  1,604 \n\n1990 \n      151.5 \n   1,696 \n\nItem \nKindergarten Enrollment (\u2018000) \nNumber of kindergartens (no.) \n \n7. \nWith  the  earlier  extensive  provision  of  preschool  and  early  childhood  education  in \nkindergartens, the majority of the children joining the school system already knew how to read \nand  write.  In  contrast,  most  children  now  enter  grade  1  without  the  necessary  preparation  for \nschool. In addition, the reduced availability of meals in schools and closure of milk kitchens and \npreschools,  especially  in  rural  areas,  aggravated  the  problems  of  poverty.  Cost  recovery  for \nmeals and introduction of fees for enrollment in preschools have eliminated a key component of \nthe social safety net for young children and their family. \n \n8. \nThe lack of kindergarten facilities may result in overcrowding the early grades of primary \nschool, particularly in rural areas. Before independence, when kindergartens provided care for 1 \nto  6-year-olds,  most  children  started  grade  1  at  7  years  of  age.  In  1991,  27,200  6-year-olds \nattended grade 1; in 1999, 40,000 6-year-olds were attending grade 1, suggesting that families \nare using grade 1 as kindergartens.   \n \nPrimary  school  enrollments  continue  to  rise  and  new  schools  are  being  built  to \n9. \naccommodate  them  (Table  A2.4).  UNICEF  reports  a  98%  gross  enrollment  rate  for  primary \nschools  (grades  1-4).  For  secondary  schools,  gross  enrollment  ratios  are  75%  for  males  and \n83% for females.  \n \n \n\nTable A2.4 :Primary School Enrollment, 1993\u20132002 \n\nItem \n\nChildren in Primary \nEducation (\u2018000) \n\nPrimary and General \nSchools (no.) \n\n1993 \n\n378.6 \n\n1994 \n\n385.9 \n\n1995 \n\n470.7 \n\n1997 \n\n470.9 \n\n1998 \n\n469.5 \n\n2000 \n\n457.2 \n\n2002 \n\n469.5 \n\n1,832 \n\n1,840 \n\n1,843 \n\n1,889 \n\n1,918 \n\n1,975 \n\n2,014 \n\nSource:  Statistics Department of the MOEC. \n \nExpenditures  for  primary  education  and  preschool  have  not  kept  pace  with  GDP  or \n10. \noverall  budget  growth  (Table  A2.5).  Between  1995  and  2000,  total  government  expenditures \nincreased by a factor of 2.45, while the education sector increased by a factor of 2.15, and its \nshare  of  the  total  budget  decreased  from  23.1%  to  20.3%.  Local  primary  school  expenditures \ndropped  from  36.6%  of  the  sector  budget  to  32.4%.  The  proportion  of  the  sector  budget \ndedicated to kindergartens fluctuated, but did not drop substantially.   \n \n11. \nThe availability of textbooks, new or old, has become a chronic problem. Teachers are \noverworked,  underpaid,  and  undertrained;  less  than  10%  receive  in-service  training  annually \ndespite a national target of 20%. Most remote rural teachers have had no training in a decade. \nMany  classrooms  and  schools  need  maintenance  and  new  equipment.  Playgrounds  are \ndangerous, with broken equipment and multiple hazards. Buildings, heating systems, electrical \nequipment,  toilets,  and  sewerage  systems  are  in  serious  disrepair.  These  conditions  are \ndisincentives to school attendance; only about 85% of enrolled children attend daily. \n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nItem \nEducation as % of GDP \n\nTotal Government \n  Expenditures \n\nEducation Sector \nEducation Sector  \n   Share of Govt (%) \n\nExpenses \n\nKindergarten \nPrimary (grades 1-4)a \nPrimary   Education   \n   Sector Share (%)a  \n\nTable A2.5: Education Sector Expenditure Analysis, 1995-2000 \n \n\n \n \n\nSom \nMillion  \n\nTotal \nTotal \n\nCentral \nLocal \nTotal \nLocal \nLocal \n\n1995 \n         6.6 \n\n1996 \n         5.2 \n\n1997 \n          4.9 \n\n1998 \n         4.9 \n\n1999 \n         4.1 \n\n2000 \n          3.5 \n\n  4,611 \n\n  5,202 \n\n   6,696 \n\n  7,298 \n\n  9,312 \n\n 11,308 \n\n  1,065 \n       23.1 \n\n  1,223 \n       23.5 \n\n   1,514 \n        22.6 \n\n  1,682 \n       23 \n\n  1,991 \n       21 \n\n   2,203 \n        19.5 \n\n     216 \n     849 \n       74.2 \n     311.3 \n       36.6 \n\n     346 \n     877 \n       78.0 \n     312.1 \n       35.6 \n\n      518 \n      996 \n        87.1 \n      344.1 \n        34.5 \n\n     581 \n  1,100 \n     107.6 \n     363.5 \n       33.0 \n\n     638 \n  1,353 \n     131.5 \n     437.9 \n       32.4 \n\n      740 \n   1,563 \n      143.8 \n      506.0 \n        32.4 \n\n         6.9 \n\n         6.3 \n\n         6.6 \n\n         6.3 \n\n          5.7 \n\n          6.5 \n\nKindergarten Sector Share (%)  Total \na Estimates on local data.

It is a good private \ninvestment for the families that can afford the subsidized kindergarten fees, but those same fees \nmake the services inaccessible for the children who really need them. Average family costs for \nkindergarten are more than 5 times the cost of primary school, vary among the target oblasts, \nand  are  markedly  higher  in  urban  than  in  rural  areas.  Despite  family  payments,  government \ncosts per child for kindergarten are extremely high and the effectiveness of the programs is low. \nMeasuring psychosocial development of young children is very difficult and there is a debate on \nthe  most  reliable  indicators.  Nevertheless,  research  has  shown  no  improved  performance  on \nachievement  tests  for  most  children  from  kindergartens  with  the  notable  exception  of  those \nsupported  by  an  NGO,  Step  by  Step.  Returns  on  public  investment  in  present  state-run \nkindergartens  are  likely  to  be  marginally  positive  over  the  long  term.  However,  returns  on \ninvestment for poor children would be between 1:3 and 1:7 according to international research.  \n\n \n \n\nTable A2.6: Costs for Kindergarten and Grade 1, 2000 \n\n \n \n \nOblast \n \nNational Average \nJalal-Abad \nOsh \nNaryn \n\nGovernment Costs  \nper Child per Year  \nin Kindergarten  \n(Som) \nCity \n4,296 \n3,331 \n3,068 \n3,580 \n\nRaion \n2,579 \n1,255 \n2,735 \n3,310 \n\nTotal \n3,530 \n2,088 \n3,079 \n3,430 \n\nFamily Cost  \nper Child per Year \nin Kindergarten \n(Som)  \nTotal \n1,070 \n   585 \n1,554 \n   226 \n\nFamily Cost \n per Child per Year \nin Grade 1-4 \n(Som)  \nTotal \n206 \n126 \n209 \n226 \n\nSource: Ministry of Finance.  \n \n13. \nLess  comprehensive,  less  expensive  preschool  models  would  likely  produce  similar \nbenefits and high returns if children from impoverished families participated. Communities and \nfamilies  have  different  needs;  in  some,  seasonal  child  care  is  an  urgent  need;  in  some, \nextended  families  still  care  for  young  children;  in  others,  women  are  single  parents  and  have \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nSummary \n\nconstant need for child care. It is urgent that poor families and children obtain access to high- \nquality care and school preparation. \n \nD. \n \n14.      ECD  services  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  are  in  short  supply,  often  of  poor  quality,  and \ninaccessible to most poor families because of distance or fees.  Investments in these services \ndo not reliably reach areas where poor families predominate, and when they do, fees and costs \nare  insurmountable  barriers  to  families  and  children  who  need  the  services  most  and  would \nbenefit most from them. Targeted investments to reach poor young children, including in remote \nrural  communities,  would  yield  significant  long-term  benefits.  Improved  capacities,  which  are \ndefined  in  the  early  years,  would  make  investments  in  the  education  system  much  more \nefficient. \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nFunding \nAgency \n\n \nADB \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC  \nIN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT SECTOR \n \nProject \nAmount     \n\nDuration \n\nProject \n\nSubsector \n\nActivity \n\n \nMultisector \n(Education/ \nHealth) \n\n \nSocial \nServices \nDelivery and \nFinance \nProject  \n\n($ millions) \n \n10.0 \n(loan) \n \n\n \n1999-2003 \n\nEducation \n\nEducation \nSector \nDevelopment \nProgram \n\n12.9 \n(loan) \n\n1998-2003 \n\n \nEducation and health reforms;

The  principal  tasks  of  the  CFCs  are  to  (i) \nhelp  the  AO  develop  a  project  work  plan  and  proposal;  (ii)  launch  project  activities  in  each \ncommunity  of  the  AO;  (iii)  coordinate  inputs  from  the  Ministry  of  Health,  the  Ministry  of \nEducation and Culture, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP), and integrate \nEarly  Childhood  Development  (ECD)  messages  and  services  in  health  centers,  schools,  and \nsocial  passport  activities;  (iv)  initiate  new  preschool  and  child  development  activities  in  the \ncommunity;  (v)  offer  parent  education  and  support;  (vi)  manage  the  implementation  of  the \ninformation,  education and  communication campaign  in  the  communities;  (vii)  develop  training \nand  public  education  programs  considered  necessary  to  ensure  the  full  participation  of  all \nstakeholders  in  developing  and  managing  ECD  activities;  (viii)  identify  community  needs  for \nassistance and capacity building; (ix) annually review the performance of subprojects and take \ntimely  action  to  remedy  weaknesses  to  ensure  that  activities  and  expenditure  information  are \ntransparent  and  readily  accessible  to  stakeholders;  (x)  ensure  women  and  the  poor  are  fully \ninvolved  in  planning  and  implementation  and,  to  the  extent  possible,  management  of \nsubprojects, (xi) assist the social worker in collecting and handling data, and reporting; and (xii) \nprepare semiannual reports and other reports as needed by the project coordination office. \n \nThe  CFC  will  (i)  be  a  local  person  who  understands  the  problems  of  children  and \n2. \nparents,  (ii)  be  a  respected  leader,  (iii)  possess  strong  organizational  skills,  (iv)  have  good \ncommunication skills; and (v) be independent and prepared to travel extensively.  \n \nThe CFC will be selected on a competitive basis. The position will be advertised, and the \n3. \ncandidates  will  be  evaluated  by  the  selection  committee  comprising  the  AO  and  project \ncoordination  office  in  the  oblast.  CFCs  will  be  hired  on  a  contractual  basis  for  2  years  fully \nfunded under the Project. The CFC will be supervised on site by the AO, but will report to the \nproject coordinator for the oblast.  \n \n4. \nTraining for CFCs will be conducted in the raion. Social workers will be included in the \ntraining.  If  in  2  years  it  is  determined  that  the  work  has  positive  results  and  a  dedicated  staff \nperson  is  needed,  then  AOs  may  finance  the  position.  Otherwise,  the  work  of  the  CFC  is \nexpected to be absorbed by the social worker, or another category of workers, whom MLSP is \npresently trying out in a few raions and planning to introduce more widely in the future. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\nVILLAGE INITIATIVE FUND \n \n\nObjectives \n\nA. \n \nThe Village Initiative Fund (VIF) will be used to finance community projects that will have \n1. \ntangible positive impacts on child development in the communities, and to support minor repairs \nof FAPs (primary health care posts), preschools, or grade 1 classrooms. The goal of the VIF is \nto improve child development in the communities. The objectives are to (i) build local capacity to \nidentify  the  needs  of  children  and  opportunities  for  improving  child  development;  (ii)  promote \nparticipation of local communities in early childhood development activities; and (iii) support the \npolicy of decentralization to local administration. \n \nEligible  applicants  are  the  communities  under  the  aiyl  okmotus  (AOs)  in  the  12  project \n2. \nraions, and the 12 raion administrations. The communities may choose to partner with any other \norganization,  including  a  nongovernment  organization  (NGO),  in  preparing  applications  and \nimplementing a project. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nGrants  will  be  provided  to  fund  minor  rehabilitation  or  maintenance  of  primary  health \ncare facilities, preschools, and grade 1 classrooms. Major repair involving repair of roofs will be \ncontracted out by the project management office (PMO). \n\nSelection Criteria and Procedures \n\n \n\nThe VIF will also support projects that will have a positive impact on the development of \n\n4. \npoor children.  A few examples of such projects follow \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\npreparing facilities for community-based preschools, \ncreating a parent resource center, \ndeveloping  a  community  care  and  home  visitation  program  for  children  with \nspecial needs, \ngrowing vegetables to improve children\u2019s diets, \nproducing learning materials for children, \ncreating a library for children, \nrehabilitating  water  supply  systems  to  provide  safe  drinking  water  for  children, \nand  \nimproving hygiene in the community to prevent waterborne diseases. \n\n \n5. \nCommunities will submit applications to the AO, which will ensure that the application is \nin  order  and  will  send  it  to  the  PMO  via  the  oblast  project  coordination  office  (PCO).  If  the \nproposed  project  covers  children  across  different  AOs  in  a  raion,  the  raion  administration  will \nconsult the concerned AOs before submitting an application to the PMO via the PCO. Specific \nsteps are involved in the procedure: \n \n\n            (ii) \n\n(i)  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe PCO will train the child and family coordinator (CFC) to assist the community \nin preparing proposals. \nThe  community  or  group  of  communities  will  develop  a  proposal  with  the \nguidance  or  assistance  of  the  CFC.  In  developing  a  proposal,  the  community \nmay choose to work with a school, FAP, women\u2019s group, or an NGO.   \nThe raion administration will develop a proposal in consultation with the relevant \ndepartments, AOs, and CFCs \nCommunity proposals must be endorsed by the AO  \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nA  community  proposal  is  submitted  directly  to  the  PCO  by  the  AO,  and  a  raion \nproposal by the raion administration. \nThe  proposal  is  reviewed  by  the  PCO  who  will  consult  with  raions,  education, \nhealth,  and  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection  (MLSP)  officials  for \nguidance, if necessary and \nThe PMO, assisted by a VIF evaluation committee to be formed under the project \nsteering committee, makes the final award of the funds.  \n\n \nThe  PMO  and  PCOs  will  assist  the  AO,  CFC,  and  community  to  organize  information \n6. \ndissemination meetings, train them to write proposals, and provide consultation and necessary \ninformation.  \n \nApplications  will  be  reviewed  once  in  3  months  by  the  evaluation  subcommittee  under \n7. \nthe steering committee. The subcommittee will comprise the PMO, PCO, and representatives of \nthe Ministry of Health, Education and Culture, Finance and MLSP. The evaluation will be based \non the criteria agreed upon in the Project, including expected impact of the project on targeted \nchildren and participation of the community in planning and implementation.  \n \n8. \nFor minor rehabilitation of facilities, the maximum amount of each grant will be $2,500. \nFor  child  development  projects,  the  maximum  amount  will  be  $5,000  for  a  community  project, \nand  $15,000  for  a  project  that  covers  children  in  more  than  one  AO.  The  community  will \ncontribute at least 10% of the total project cost in kind, and another 10% in cash.    \n \n9. \nThe  PMO  and  the  receiving  community  will  make  an  agreement  on  a  grant.  After  the \nreceiving  community  deposits  its  cash  contributions  to  the  project  bank account,  the  PMO  will \npay the grant in one or several tranches, depending on the requested amount.  \n \n10. \nConcerned  ministries,  through  their  counterpart  departments  in  oblast  administrations, \nwill  be  responsible  for  supervising  of  the  rehabilitation  of  facilities  financed  by  the  VIF.  The \nsupervising  bodies  will  submit  quarterly  monitoring  reports  to  the  PMO.  The  AO  will  be \nresponsible  for  submitting  progress  and  completion  reports  on  the  VIF  funded  projects  in  the \ncommunities to the PCO, which will compile the reports and then send the consolidated form to \nthe  PMO along with a quarterly report.  \n \n11.  When notified by the AO of the completion of  the grant project, the supervising bodies \nwill  check  the  state  of  the  project,  and  submit  final  reports  for  each  individual  grant  to  the \nMinistry of Finance and the PMO.   \n \n12. \nbe conducted at the end of years 2, 3 and 4 of project implementation.   \n \n13. \nthe originally agreed upon plan are found.  \n \n14. \nright to randomly inspect the use of VIF by visiting rehabilitated facilities or project sites.   \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe  PMO  can  stop  payments  for  a  grant  project  if  violations  or  major  differences  from \n\nThe PMO, the PCOs, the President\u2019s office, or oblast and raion administrations have the \n\nIndependent monitoring and evaluation of at least 10% of randomly sampled projects will \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \nItem \n\nInvestment Costs \n A.

The  analysis  is  based  on  the \nproject interventions outlined in the project framework (Appendix 1). It describes the economic \nrationale  and  target  beneficiaries,  provides  with-and  without  project  analysis,  establishes \neconomic  benefits  and  economic  costs,  and  compares  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) with the economic opportunity cost of capital, which is assumed to be 10%.1 Sensitivity \nanalysis tests changes in the EIRR with modified assumptions about project costs and benefits. \nThe period of analysis covers 20 years period carried out in constant 2002 dollar prices.    \n \nB. \n \nThe project objectives and components are described in the main text. The three project \n2. \noblasts  of  Jalal-Abad,  Naryn,  and  Osh  have  a  population  of  2.9  million  (69%  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation),  of  whom  about  2  million  live  in  rural  areas.  The  Project  will  improve  access  to \nquality  health  and  education  services  for  the  rural  population,  thereby  directly  or  indirectly \nimproving  the  health  and  education  status  of  some  484,440  children  living  in  the  12  poorest \nraions of the target oblasts, including children born during the 20-year period. \n \n3. \nImprovements  in  infant  and  child  mortality  in  the  target  raions  are  based  on  targets \nconsistent  with  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  by  2015. \nThe Project aims to contribute to the MDG targets of reducing by two thirds the infant mortality \nrate (IMR) from 61.3 (1997) to 20.8 (2015) and the under 5 mortality rate (U5MR), from 72.3 to \n24.6 in the same period.   \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  economic  rationale  for  investing  in  early  childhood  development  (ECD)  is  strong. \nInvestment in ECD will improve an individual\u2019s future prospect of earning. The improvement will \ncontribute  to  individual  wealth  and  poverty  reduction,  increase  future  productivity  of  the  labor \nforce, and lead to economic development. Numerous studies demonstrate that improved health, \neducation, and poverty that impact the first several years of children\u2019s development are directly \nrelated to improved adult and societal productivity. The early years of human life are a critical \nperiod  during  which  the  foundations  for  healthy  physical,  cognitive,  emotional,  and  social \ndevelopment  are  laid.  Neuroscience  has  revealed  the  importance  for  brain  development  of  a \nchild\u2019s health, activities, and experiences in the first few years of life. Children who are deprived \nof appropriate stimulation, care, and nutrition during their early years often develop poorly and \ncannot reach their full potential. Although not always impossible, it is very difficult and expensive \nto  alter  the  outcomes  of  this  critical  period  in  later  life.  Some  deficits,  for  example,  iodine  and \niron deficiency, cause irreversible damage. \n \n5. \nInvestment  in  ECD  benefits  not  only  children  and  their  families,  but  also  society  as  a \nwhole.  Society  benefits  from  ECD  through  greater  productivity  in  later  life.  The  child  care \nprograms  free  up  women  to  work  and  thus  increase  the  availability  of  the  labor  force. \nInvestment in ECD is also preventive and can reduce the need for and costs of social welfare \n\nRationale for Investment and Approach \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997.

Children who benefit from health \nand  nutrition  interventions  and  preschool  experiences  are  more  likely  to  enroll  and  persist  in \nschool, to be healthier, to need fewer social protection or criminal justice services, and to earn \nhigher  incomes  as  adults.  Research  shows  a  positive  correlation  of  ill  health  as  a  child,  and \nphysical  impairments  and  health  problems  later  in  life,  all  of  which  are  burdens  on  health \nservices.  ECD also addresses the important societal concern of equity. ECD is known to have a \nlarger  impact  on  deprived  children  than  better-off  children.  Therefore,  ECD  will  contribute  to \nnarrow  differences  in  development  among  children  who  come  from  various  economic \nbackgrounds. This is especially important for the Kyrgyz Republic and other former Soviet Union \ncountries where economic inequality is widening.  \n \n6. \nIntegrated  Approach.  Health,  nutrition,  education,  and  home  care  are  interactive \ndeterminants of child outcomes, and therefore programs to optimize child development should \nintegrate these features. Experience shows that integrated ECD interventions are more effective \nthan  isolated  single  sector  intervention.  Young  children  are  very  susceptible  to  infections  and \ndiseases, and this vulnerability is greater when a child is malnourished. Malnutrition, illness, or \nneglect  during  childhood  has  immediate  and  long-term  effects  on  cognitive  development  and \nlearning achievement through loss of concentration, apathy, and reduced activity. Children who \nare  malnourished  or  neglected  during  early  childhood  are  more  likely  to  delay  enrollment  in \nprimary  school;  they  are  likely  to  perform  less  well  and  to  learn  less  than  well-nourished \nchildren.  \n \n7. \nCommunity-Based Approach. The preschool system in the former Soviet Union was a \ndistinctly center-based approach that prevented the involvement of communities and parents in \nchild  development,  and  imposed  centrally  planned  standardized  curriculum.  The  center-based \napproach  was  an  expensive  model.  The  existing  state-run  kindergartens  are  not  a  financially \nviable  option  for  endeavor  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Culture\u2019s  (MOEC)  to  increase  the \ncoverage  of  preschool.  The  annual  expenditure  per  child  in  a  kindergarten  in  Jalal-Abad  was \n$60-100 equivalent in 2000. The Government budget covers between 65% and over 90% of the \nexpenditure,  depending on  the  oblast,  and  pays  mostly  for  teachers' salaries.  By contrast,  the \ncommunity-based  preschool  programs  introduced  under  the  Project  expects  the  per  child \nannual recurrent expenditure of a community/home-based preschool to be $30-40 in addition to \nthe  initial  $1,500-2,000  investment  on  equipment,  furniture,  and  learning  materials.  With  the \nProject,  household  expenditures  on  health  care  due  to  child  morbidity  will  decline.  Increased \naccess to preschool programs may increase total expenditures on preschool programs by both \nhousehold  and  government  in  the  end,  but  will  substantially  reduce  the  expenditure  per  child \nwho benefits from preschool programs.   \n \nD. \n \nThe quantitative cost-benefit analysis for the Project follows the methodologies outlined \n8. \nin ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. The analysis uses domestic prices \nas the numeraire. The economic opportunity cost of capital was assumed to be 10% (footnote1). \nSensitivity  analysis  tested  changes  in  the  to  EIRR  with  modified  assumptions  about  project \ncosts  and  benefits.  The  period  of  analysis  covered  20  years  and  was  carried  out  in  constant \n2002 dollar prices. To simplify the calculation, the analysis focused on benefits from the Project \nin  the  12  project  raions,  while  some  project  activities  including  immunization  and  policy \ndevelopment will benefit children across the country.  \n\nCost Benefit Analysis \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n53 \n\n2. \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Costs \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \n \n9. \nBase investment costs are in constant 2002 dollar prices, with domestic prices used as \nnumeraire. Taxes and duties account for 19% of the project costs. Incremental recurrent costs \nare  calculated  for  the  15  years  following  the  5-year  project  implementation  period  and  are \nestimated at about 119% of project costs. These costs are high relative to many health projects \nbecause  the  loan  will  cover  the  purchase  of  vaccines,  equipment,  and  supplies  for  universal \nimmunization of the country\u2019s entire child population. These costs for immunization are the main \nelement of recurrent costing. Cost items in foreign exchange are converted to domestic prices \nusing a shadow exchange rate factor of 0.9. \n \n \n \n10.  Major benefits from the Project include cost savings to the health sector due to reduced \nchild  morbidity  and  mortality,  increased  earnings  contributed  to  society  by  the  increased  lives \nsaved, and the impacts on the education system and the increased earnings resulting from an \nadditional year of schooling. \n \n \n \nCost  savings  that  accrue  to  the  health  sector  from  lower  morbidity  are  estimated  to  be \n11. \napproximately  $79.15  per  child  (Table  A15.1).  The  analysis  assumes  the  following  (i) \nGovernment  expenditures  on  health  care  are  approximately  $10.50  per  person,  with  an \nestimated  30%  increase  for  treating  severe  cases;  (ii)  out-of-pocket  expenses  are about  $26.2 \n(iii) If children are severely ill, it is likely that 1-2 doctor\u2019s visits will occur before hospitalization. \nThe  cost  of  a  doctor\u2019s  visit  and  transport  from  a  rural  area  is  about  $12.50;  and  (iv)  cost  of \nmedication is $15.00.3 An estimated total net present value is $7,585,429 over 20 years   based \non saving 15,119 children and improving the health of 484,440 children benefited by the Project \nover a 20-year period.4 Given that the per capita income of the Kyrgyz Republic is only $300, \nthe health care cost of a sick child is a burden on households.  \n \n\nCost Savings \n\na. \n\n \n\nTable A15.1:  Cost of Health Care for Severe Illness/Death of Child ($) \n\n Government Expenditures  \n Out-of Pocket Expenses  \n Out-patient Visits  \n Medication  \n                      Total  \n\n                     13.15  \n                     26.00  \n                     25.00  \n                     15.00  \n                     79.15  \n\n \n\nb. \n\nBenefits of Reduced Child Mortality \n\n \n \n \n12. \nImproving  infant  and  child  mortality  in  the  target  raions  is  based  on  targets  consistent \nwith the MDGs for the Kyrgyz Republic by 2015, which are to achieve a two-thirds decrease in \nIMR from 61.3 in 1997 to 20.8 in 2015, and a decrease in U5MR from 72.3 in 1997 to 24.6 in \n2015.  The  Project  estimates  a  30%  reduction  in  U5MR  from  2004  to  2009,  followed  by  an \n                                                 \n2 Calculated from the hospital discharge survey. \n3  The  Uzbekistan  household  survey  showed  that  the  average  drug  expenditure  for  respiratory  and  intestinal  illness \nranged  from  $3.50  to  $10.60  at  the  unofficial  exchange  rate  and  $14-43  at  the  official  exchange  rate.    The  $15 \nmedication expense is based on an average. \n\n4 This figure represents the difference in the number of children in the target population in the with project scenario \nless the number of children in the without project scenario, or estimated children\u2019s lives saved by reducing under-5 \nchild mortality through project interventions. \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nadditional 36% reduction between 2009 and 2015. The U5MR continues to decline after 2015, \nbut  at  a  slower  rate  beyond.  Immunization,  integrated  management  of  childhood  illness, \nimproved  nutritional  practices  in  homes,  and  improved  facilities,  equipment  and  training  in \nhealth  centers  will  help  achieve  MDG  targets  provided  the  Government  sustains  these \ninterventions beyond the project period. The improvement in these health indicators is used to \ncalculate the income benefits of lives saved for the project target beneficiaries. The population \naged  0-4  years  was  selected  as  the  base  population  for  constructing  cohort  life  tables  that \nallowed  age-specific  mortality  rates  to  be  applied  to  the  group  of  children  benefiting  from  the \nProject.  Life  tables  were  constructed  by  partitioning  time  into  intervals,  and  then  counting  for \neach time interval the number of subjects alive at the start of the interval, those who die during \nthe interval, and those who are lost to follow-up or withdrawn during the interval. The analysis \nassumes that those alive at the end of a time interval are at risk for the entire interval. \n \n13. \nAs  a  result  of  the  Project,  the  15,119  additional  people  in  the  12  project  raions  will \neconomically  contribute  to  society.  The  probability  of  finding  employment  affects  how  many \npeople  in  each  age  category  are  able  to  find  work.  It  is  assumed  that  children  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic begin to enter the workforce at age 15. This assumption is supported by statistics on \nthe  International  Labor  Organization  (ILO)  web  site.  The  age-specific  probability  of  work \nstatistics was taken from the ILO  web site and is based on the projected probability of finding \nwork in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2010.5 The increased earnings accruing to society are calculated \nby  multiplying  the  age-  specific  population  by  the  probability  of  finding  employment  and  the \nagricultural  wage  rate  of  $224.  Table  A15.2  shows  the  additional  earnings  that  the  15,119 \npersons who are saved will contribute over their lifetimes. The wage rate represents 80% of the \ngross national income of $280/year. A 3% annual increase in wages is assumed throughout the \nlife of the population.  \n \n\nTable A15.2: Income Benefits to Society of Reduced Child Mortality ($) \n\n \n\n \nAgricultural Wage Rate  (per year) \n224 \n230 \n\nBenefit (Net Present Value) \n4,323,380 \n4,439,122 \n\n \n\nc. \n\nEducational Benefits \n\n \n14. \nNote  that  the  economic  benefits  accruing  to  society  from  reduced  child  mortality  are \ntaken  from  just  one  project  impact  \u2013  a  group  of  economically  active  children  that  would  have \nperished without the Project.  \n \n \n \nVarious  studies  conclude  that  increasing  educational  attainment  contributes  to  an \n15. \nincrease in wage levels. No relevant studies show the percentage increase in wages attributable \nto 1 year of additional education in the Kyrgyz Republic. The average length of schooling in the \nKyrgyz  Republic  is  approximately  9  years.  It  is  assumed  that  the  Project  will  increase  the \naverage years of education by 1 year. Using this information and studies from other countries, \nwe  assume  1  one  year  of  additional  education  contributes  to  a  2.6%  increase  in  wage  levels. \nApplying  age-specific  probability  of  work  statistics  and  mortality  rates  to  the  484,440  children \nbenefited  by  the  Project,  the  increase  in  wages  will  lead  to  an  additional  lifetime  earnings \ncontribution of about $5,971,759 by these children over 40 years.  \n                                                 \n5  ILO statistics are provided for the year 2000 and projected for 2010, based on current estimates.  Since the under 5 \npopulation will begin entering the workforce in 2010, the projections for 2010 were used to project lifetime earnings. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n55 \n\nLocal  educators  acknowledge  that  enrollment  and  completion  data  in  rural  areas  are \n16. \ninflated and that the official average 9 years of schooling is an overstatement for those areas. \nInternational  research  points  to  community  mobilization,  parent  education,  and  preschool  as \ninterventions  that  measurably  increase  school  enrollment  and  completion  rates.  Increased \nenrollment and completion in the early years of primary school results in higher benefits than a \ntenth  year  of  schooling.  Therefore  the  returns  in  Table  A15.3  likely  underestimate  the \neducational  benefits  of  the  Project  in  two  ways:  by  the  numbers  of  out-of-school  children  who \nwill enroll or complete additional years, and the value of the additional years completed. \n \n\nTable A15.3: Summary of Education Benefits ($) \n\nWage \n224.00 \n228.48 \n\nBenefit (Net Present Value) \n224,765,737 \n230,737,496 \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n \nE. \n \n17. \nThe calculated EIRRs in Table A15.4 are expected to be lower than the true EIRR. The \nbenefits of ECD investments accrue over the full lifetimes of beneficiaries and improved health \nand  education  of  the  next  generation;  these  longer-term  outcomes  are  not  captured  in  the \nanalyses.  Other  benefits  not  fully  captured  or  discussed  here  include  improved  efficiency  in \nhealth and education systems; reinforcement of decentralization and local capacities; improved \nwomen\u2019s knowledge, skills, employment opportunities, and access to services (gender benefits); \nsavings  due  to  reduced  rates  of  child  morbidity  and  malnutrition  (which  reduce  the  need  for \ncurative  services)  and  improved  cognitive  development  and  school  performance;  expected \nreturns  on  schooling  in  terms  of  learning  about  new  technologies  and  markets  related  to \ninformation  technology  (a  government  priority);  and  improved  quality  of  life  for  at  least  two \ngenerations.  Table  A15.4  shows  the  results  of  comparing  the  with-  and  -without  Project \nscenarios. Since research indicates that children that are healthier stay in school longer and are \nbetter prepared to learn, it is likely that in the future they will earn higher wages.  Therefore, it is \nassumed that the wage level without the Project is $224, and that with the Project is $230.  \n \n\n \nBase Case \nIncrease Costs 10%  \nIncrease Costs 20%  \nDecrease Benefits 10%  \nDecrease Benefits 20%  \nCosts Increase 10%  \nBenefits Decrease 10%  \nCosts Increase 20%  \nBenefits Decrease 20%  \n\nTable A15.4: Sensitivity Analysis \n \nCosts \n($) \n\n                (15,284,820) \n                (16,813,302) \n                (18,341,784) \n                (15,284,820) \n                (15,284,820) \n\nBenefits \n($) \n\n            25,005,192  \n            25,005,192 \n            25,005,192 \n            22,504,673  \n            20,004,153  \n\n                (16,813,302) \n\n            22,004,153  \n\n                (18,341,784) \n\n            22,504,673  \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n   63.6 \n   48.8 \n   36.3 \n   47.2 \n   30.9 \n\n   33.9 \n\n     9.3 \n\nEven if the costs increase by 10% and benefits decrease by 10%, the Project still shows \n\n \n18. \npositive gains, with an EIRR of 33.9%. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nFinancial Sustainability Analysis \n\nF. \n \n19. \nThe Project\u2019s recurrent costs that include maintenance of facilities, equipment, supplies \n(vaccines, essential drugs, and education materials), training, and monitoring will be a little over \n$1 million and represent less than 1% of the total health and education budget over the forecast \nperiod of 20 years (Table A15.5).

If  their \n20. \ncontributions  are  considered,  the  percentage  will  further  decrease.  Major  sources  of  recurrent \ncosts are vaccines and essential drugs. The Government has committed itself to be financially \nself-sustainable  in  procuring  vaccines.  Essential  drugs  will  be  increasingly  made  available  as \nthe Mandatory Health Insurance Fund improves its function. Therefore, sustaining the activities \nplanned under the Project beyond the project period is expected to be within the fiscal capacity \nof  the  Government.  Advance  planning  for  procurement  of  vaccines  and  essential  drugs  has \nbeen included as a specific assurance to facilitate budget allocation upon project completion. \n \nG. \n \n21. \nThe  economic  and  social  implications  of  not  undertaking  the  ECD  Project  are  serious \ngiven the recent trends in poverty, health, and education services in the Kyrgyz Republic. ECD \ninvestments are among the most effective means interrupting of the intergenerational transfer of \npoverty.  The  analysis  shows  a  high  EIRR  of  63.6%  can  be  expected  from  the  Project.  If \nimmunization  and  other  benefits  for  children  outside  the  12  Project  raions  are  factored  in,  the \nEIRR  would  be  even  higher.  However,  caution  is  needed  in  interpreting  the  EIRR.  As  the \neconomic  returns  of  ECD  interventions  will  largely  materialize  over  a  long  term,  estimation  of \neconomic  returns  inevitably  relies  on  a  series  of  assumptions  on  costs  and  benefits  of  the \ninterventions, and external factors such as economic growth.

Yes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?  The poverty partnership \nagreement (PPA) will be developed by the end of 2003. \n \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Krygyz Republic: \nThe quality of primary health care and early education, including diagnosis and treatment of chronic illnesses, disease \nand  malnutrition,  provides  the  basis  for  growth  and  development  of  children.  Without  adequate  health  services,  the \nlifetime  opportunities  of  children  may  be  limited  before  the  children  enroll  at  school.  Problems  of  children  are \ncompounded in families living in poverty, especially in poor communities. Public investment in better health, nutrition, \nwater/sanitation,  and  early  childhood  development  offers  long-term  human  development  benefits.  Reduction  in \ndiseases due to iodine deficiencies offers immediate savings in public health expenditure. \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nProposed Classification: Core Poverty Intervention \n\n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? In 2001,the poor comprised 40% of the population in urban areas, and 47% \nin rural areas, according to the Government national sample expenditure survey. The \"social passport\" data from the \nMinistry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) indicate higher poverty rate based on income data. Analysis of data \ncollected during project preparation reveals that larger families are concentrated in rural areas, and that the number of \nchildren  aged  0-8  are  greater  in  poor  rural  families.  In  addition  to  income  poverty,  analysis  reveals  higher  rates  of \niodine  deficiency,  anemia,  and  malnutrition  in  rural  communities.  Access  to  primary  health  care  is  reduced  by  lower \nlevel  of  services,  lack  of  medicines  and  equipment,  and  the  prohibitive  cost  of  travel  to  the  raion  center  for  testing, \ndiagnosis, and treatment. Any preschool opportunities outside the raion center are the exception. Small/isolated rural \ncommunities  lack  both  information  about  health,  nutrition,  and  child  development  as  well  as  the    resources  to  meet \nidentified  needs.  The  Project  targets  the  12  poorest  raions  where  poverty  rate  is  above  69%,  and  most  of  the \ninterventions cover all eligible children. Therefore, more than 50% of the beneficiaries will be the poor. \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nStakeholder analysis? National task forces and oblast task groups (raions vs oblasts) have identified services that no \nlonger meet standards achieved in former Soviet times. Solutions proposed tended to seek funding to meet the former \nSoviet Union\u2019s standards rather than reviewing needs and the most effective response to need. Participatory dialogue \nstakeholder  opportunities  and  resources  as  well  as  problem  analysis  have  been  completed,  and  new  solutions  are \ndeveloping. \n \nParticipation strategy? The proposed project aims at community mobilization, including rapidly assessing needs, and \nidentifying  potential  responses,  combined  with  a  Village  Initiative  Fund  giving  communities  some  resources  to \nprovide/improve  children\u2019s  services  and  an  incentive  to  make  those  improvements.  Project  will  also  coordinate  the  \ncommunity  response  to  identified  needs  and  improve  the  quality  of  basic  health  care,  information  about  hygiene, \nnutrition, and child development, and thus, ensure a better preparation for children entering school. \n \nContribution  of  the  sector/subsector  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  Krygyz  Republic:  Early  Childhood  Development  (ECD) \ninterventions are key to interrupting intergenerational transfer of poverty by building opportunities for and capacities of \nindividuals born into poverty.  ECD interventions enable women to work and older girls to attend school. Project will be \nimplemented  in  the  poorest  raions,  thus  maximizing  the  effects  of  ECD  interventions,  which  have  the  strongest \nimpacts, where participating children are from marginalized and low-income families. \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n59 \n\nD.         Gender and Development \n\n  \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  No  gender  bias  in  primary  health  care  or  preschool  education  has  been \nfound.  The  Project  pays  special  attention  to  improved  diagnosis  of  iodine  and  iron  deficiencies  in  pregnant  women. \nEarly  childhood  development  has  implications  for  women\u2019s  life  as  well.  Women\u2019s  life  is  closely  intertwined  with  their \nchildren\u2019s.  ECD  interventions  will  reduce  women\u2019s  time  spent  on  caring  for  sick  children.  Increased  access  to \naffordable  preschool  programs  will  enable  women  to  avail  of  economic  opportunities.  Reduction  of  iron  deficiency \nanemia will improve women\u2019s productivity, and reduce pregnancy related risks including maternal mortality. \n \nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n \n\n \nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nNone \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n\nResettlement \n\nNo resettlement  The Project will need no land acquisition or resettlement. \n\nNone \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n\n \nLabor \n\n \nAffordability \n\n \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \n\nNot significant \n\nVulnerability,  social  indicators,  and  access  to  basic  services \nare determined by economic status rather than by ethnicity.  \n\nNot significant  No issues are expected. \n\nSignificant \n\nImproving  access \nfacilities, \nservices/medicines  available,  and  travel  costs  for  poor \nfamilies requiring raion/oblast services \n\nto  primary  health  care \n\nNot Significant  No issues are expected.  \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nYes \n\nNone \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 5 August 2003) \n", "Currency Unit\nSom1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "som (Som) \n$0.0247 \nSom 40.4850 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "AO \nADB \nCFC \nDHS \nECD \nEIRR \nEPI \nFAP \nFGP \nFSU \nIDA \nIDD \nIEC \nIMCI \nIMR \nJFPR  \nM&E \nMDG \nMHIF \nMLSP  \nMOEC \nMOF  \nMOH  \nNGO \nPCO \nPMO \nTA \nU5MR \nUNICEF \nUSAID \nVIF \nWHO \n", "ayil okmotu (village authority) \n\u2013 \nAsian Development Bank \n\u2013 \nchild and family coordinator \n\u2013 \nDemographic and Health Survey \n\u2013 \nearly childhood development \n\u2013 \neconomic internal rate of return \n\u2013 \nExtended Program of Immunization \n\u2013 \nfeldshers accoucheur (midwife) post \n\u2013 \nFamily Group Practice \n\u2013 \nformer Soviet Union \n\u2013 \niron deficiency anemia \n\u2013 \niodine deficiency disorder \n\u2013 \ninformation, education, and communication \n\u2013 \nIntegrated Management of Childhood Illnesses \n\u2013 \ninfant mortality rate \n\u2013 \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n\u2013 \nmonitoring and evaluation \n\u2013 \nMillennium Development Goal \n\u2013 \nMandatory Health Insurance Fund \n\u2013 \nMinistry of Labor and Social Protection \n\u2013 \nMinistry of Education and Culture \n\u2013 \nMinistry of Finance \n\u2013 \nMinistry of Health \n\u2013 \nnongovernment organization \n\u2013 \nproject coordination office \n\u2013 \nproject management office \n\u2013 \ntechnical assistance  \n\u2013 \nunder-five mortality rate \n\u2013 \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n\u2013 \nUnited States Agency for International Development \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nVillage Initiative Fund \n\u2013  World Health Organization \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "This  report  was  prepared  by  R.
