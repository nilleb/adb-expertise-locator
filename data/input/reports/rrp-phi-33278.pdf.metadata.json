Further, \nitself  suffers \ninadequate \n\n \nTo  improve  their  health,  poor  people  in  the  Philippines  require \nimproved  access  to  health  insurance,  and  better  quality  and \nefficiency  in  the  provision  of  accessible  primary  health  care. \nAlthough the health status of Filipinos has continuously improved \nover  the  last  decades,  the  common  illnesses of  poverty,  such  as \ninfectious diseases, have not been reduced to acceptable levels. \nSocial  and  economic  changes  have  created  new  challenges  in \nthe \nterms  of  degenerative  and \nfrom  an \norganization  of \ninappropriate \nregulatory \nsystem, \nmechanisms,  and  inappropriate  health  care  financing  methods. \nThe  Philippine  Government  has  established  the  Health  Sector \nReform  Agenda  (HSRA)  to  address  issues.  The  HSRA  defines \nkey \ninequities  and \ninefficiencies in the sector. \n \nIn  1999  the  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  was  charged  with \nimplementing  the  HSRA.  Although  some  reform  measures  have \nbeen  tested  successfully,  most  of  the  HSRA  strategies  in  the \nareas of health insurance, provider payment, quality of care, and \ngovernance  have  not  been  operationalized  and  tested.  The \nGovernment  has  requested  assistance  to  fully  implement  these \nreforms.  \n \nThe Health Sector Development Program (HSDP) comprised two \nloans. A Program loan to support the financing of comprehensive \nsector  reforms  and  a  project  loan  for  implementation  of  the \nreforms  in  selected  provinces.  The  program  loan  policy  reforms \nand actions outlined in the policy matrix will remove obstacles for \nHSRA  implementation  and  catalyze  future  investments.  The \nproject  loan  will  support  design  and  initial  implementation  of \nreform interventions by local government units (LGUs) level in five \nselected provinces. \n \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Sector Development Program \n \n \n\nThe  goal  of  the  HSDP  is  to  improve  the  health  status  of  the \npopulation,  especially  of  the  poor,  and  to  achieve  the  health-\nrelated  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  of  the  United \nNations.  Implementing  an  integrated  set  of  health  sector  reforms \nthat  benefits  the  poor  will  include  system-wide  changes  and  the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  project  interventions  in  selected \npilot provinces that build on the HSRA. The HSRA delineates the \nrange of issues to be addressed to accelerate reduction of poverty \ncaused by and contributing to ill health.  \n \n \nThe  Program  will  address  the  root  causes  for  the  lack  of \nsubstantial changes since the publication of the HSRA in 1999 by \nputting  into  place  the  appropriate  incentives  for  change  in \nsystems,  processes,  and  rewards.  The  Program  takes  into \naccount  the  lack  of  fiscal  space  available  to  Government  for \ninvesting  in  health  and  in  poverty  reduction,  and  proposes  a \nrefocus of health spending and higher expenditures in areas that \ndirectly  benefit  the  poor.  The  Program  follows  a  strategy,  which \ninvests in people and primary health facilities and that focuses on \ncost  containment  and  cost  efficiency.  The  envisaged  policy \nactions  and  reform  interventions  emphasize  performance-based \nincreased  accountability  and  good \nresource  allocation, \ngovernance, and consumer participation. \n \n\nreforms \n\nThe  program  loan  supports  the  overall  goal  of  the  Program  by \npromoting  cost-effectiveness  of  health  services  and  equity  of \nhealth status through implementation of an integrated set of health \nsector  reforms.  The  system-wide  changes  will  largely  concern \nimproving  the  ways  that  HSRA  reforms  are  implemented  and \nmanaged  at  all  levels  in  the  health  sector.  The  Program  follows \nthree fundamental objectives deriving from the sector analysis and \nlessons learned. These are (i) improving focus on the poor and on \nthe  sector \n(ii)  structural \nprimary  health  care, \norganizations,  and  (iii)  operationalizing  regulatory  reform  and \nimproved governance in the sector. \n \nThe  adjustment  and  other  costs  of  the  policy  reforms  addressed \nby  the  program  loan  are  estimated  to  be  at  least  $280  million \nequivalent. \n \nThe  Program  will  be  financed  by  a  loan  of  $200,000,000 \nequivalent  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  ADB  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have an amortization period of \n15 years including a grace period of 3 years, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n\nin \n\nImportant Features \n\nThe Program Loan \n \nObjectives and Scope \n\nCost Estimates \n\nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n\fProgram Period and \nTranching \n\nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement, \nDisbursement, and \nCounterpart Funds \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nThe Project Loan \n\nObjectives  \n\n \n\nv \n\nThe  loan  will  be  utilized  from  1  January  2005  to  30  June  2007. \nThe  first  tranche  of  $100  million  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness,  expected  in  December  2004.  The  second  tranche \nof $100 million is expected to be released by June 2006 (or about \n18 months after the first tranche). Throughout implementation, the \nsteering  committee  and  the  UPMU  will  monitor  quarterly  the \nimplementation of policy and institutional reforms envisaged under \nthe  HSDP.  In  cooperation  with  the  UMPU,  ADB  will  carry  out \nsemiannual  review  missions  to  assess  implementation  of  the \npolicy  agenda  and  discuss  major  policy  developments  with  the \nconcerned  agencies.  Such  missions  will  be  fielded  to  assess \nwhether  conditions  for  the  release  of  the  second  loan  tranche \nhave  been  fulfilled.  To  obtain  the  release  of  the  second  loan \ntranche,  the  Government  will  be  required  to  carry  out  actions \nidentified  in  the  policy  matrix  as  conditions  for  tranche  release, \nand  to  demonstrate  satisfactory  progress  in  implementing  the \nproject loan. \n \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) will be the EA of the program \nloan. DOF will chair a program interagency steering committee to \ncoordinate the program loan activities. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of \neligible  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB's  member \ncountries.  Procurement  of  eligible  items  finance  under  the \nprogram  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  standard \ngovernment  procedures  or  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Government  will  use  the \ncounterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  to \nfinance the costs of implementing the HSRA. \n \nFrom 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2007. \n \n \n \nThe  project  loan  will  result  in  more  affordable  and  better  quality \nhealth care, and thus increase utilization through cost savings and \noutput  enhancing  health  sector  reforms \nin  six  areas:  (i) \nrationalizing health care financing and increasing health insurance \ncoverage  of  the  poor;  (ii)  improving  governance,  operational \nefficiency, and service provision of public hospitals; (iii) increasing \nutilization  of \n(iv) \nstrengthening regulatory functions for improved quality, efficiency, \nand  safety;  (v)  promoting  service  integration  in  local  health \nsystems;  and  (vi)  promoting  organizational  effectiveness  and \npublic accountability in the health sector.  \n \n\nimproved  public  health  care  services; \n\nComponents and Outputs  While  policy  actions  will  address  national  reform  issues,  the \nproject loan will create outputs related to the five principle reform \nareas and support cultural change in the health system.

In  the  selected  provinces,  support  will  be \nprovided to cities and municipalities with the highest incidence of \npoverty. \n \nFive  provinces  have  been  surveyed  and  are  eligible  for  project \nsupport: three neighboring provinces in the north of Luzon (Ifugao, \nIlocos Norte, and Nueva Vizcaya); and two poor island provinces \n(Oriental  Mindoro  and  Romblon).  The  Project  will  have  five \ncomponents:  health  sector  governance,  regulatory  reform,  local \nhealth sector reform, hospital reform, and public health reform. \n \nProject  costs  of  the  investment  package  for  five  selected \nprovinces are estimated at $23.3 million equivalent. \n\n \n \n\nADB \nGovernment  \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange\n  6.25 \n0.00 \n 6.25 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n 6.75 \n10.33 \n17.08 \n\nTotal \nCost \n13.00 \n10.33 \n23.33 \n\n($ million)\n% \n\n56 \n44 \n100 \n\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe project loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period \nof 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. \n \nParticipating  LGUs  will  share  the  costs  of  the  Project  in  terms  of \ncounterpart  funds  for  civil  works  and  equipment  in  accordance \nwith their fiscal capacity of borrowing.

Equipment  (medical  and  non-medical),  vehicles,  and \nsupplies will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement, on the basis of international competitive bidding for \ncontracts  over  $500,000, \nlocal \ninternational  shopping  and \ncompetitive  bidding \nfor  contracts  between  $100,000  and \n$500,000,  or  direct  purchase.  Civil  works  will  be  partially  funded \nand  contracted  by  the  local  governments.    For  civil  works, \ncontracts of over $2 million will be procured through international \ncompetitive  bidding,  all  other  contracts  will  be  based  on  local \ncompetitive bidding. \n \nDOH,  through  UPMD,  will  engage  international  and  domestic \nconsultants,  either \nfirms. \nRecruitment  of  consultants  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB \nfor  domestic  consultants.  ADB\u2019s  Quality-  and  Cost-Based \nSelection method will apply for consulting firms. \n \nThe main benefits will be (i) reduced poverty and improved health \nstatus  of  the  poor,  (ii)  improved  governance  (iii)  consumer \nempowerment,  and  (iv)  strengthened  local  government  capacity. \nThe  main  beneficiaries  will  be  poor  people  who  benefit  from \nexpanded  health  insurance  coverage  and  from  improved  access \nto and higher quality of health service.  \n \nThe HSDP will contribute to the overall reform process as defined \nin \nby \norganizational  and  professional  cultures,  introduce  continuous \nimprovement  processes,  and  empower  health  service  personnel \nand consumers. The Project loan will benefit over 725,000 people \nin selected LGUs in the Philippines by upgrading local health care \nservices and facilities and increasing access to care. \n \nAlthough  supported  and  endorsed  by  leading  advocates  and \nanalysts  in  the  health  sector  in  the  Philippines,  the  main  risk  is \nthat the reform approach of the HSRA and the Program will not be \naccepted  by  those  that  carry  the  main  responsibility  for  program \nimplementation, particularly the hospitals and LGUs. The HSDP is \nthese \nthe  appropriate \nstructured \nstakeholders  and  to  mitigate  this  risk.  Capacity  constraints  in \nLGUs will require support from DOH. The HSDP has resources to \nundertake the required capacity building for HSRA implementation \nin its areas of focus. \n \n\nfacilitate  changes \n\nIn  particular, \n\nthe  HSRA. \n\nincentives \n\nto  offer \n\nit  will \n\nfor \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Health  Sector  Development  Program  (HSDP).  The \nprogram framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n1. \n\nSector Structure and Financing \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n \nA. \n \n \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  role  and  presence  in  the  health  sector  is  a  constitutional  mandate. \n2. \nUnder  the  1987  Constitution,  health  is  both  an  objective  of,  and  the  instrument  to,  achieve \neconomic  development.  To  fulfill  its  constitutional  mandate,  each  government  administration \noutlines,  among  others,  its  health  objectives,  policies  and  strategies  in  the  Medium  Term \nPhilippine  Development  Plan\u2014the  master  plan  on  which  the  specific  objectives,  programs, \nactivities and projects of each government agency are anchored. According to the 2000\u20132004 \nplan, Filipinos of all ages should have access to health, nutrition, and population management \nservices that are essential to achieve full human potential leading to a sustainable improvement \nin the quality of life. The sector analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n3. \nThe Philippine Government has not provided sufficient support to meet the health care \nneeds  of  the  poor.  Total  health  expenditure  in  2001  was  estimated  at  P119.4  billion,  3.5%  of \ngross  domestic  product.  Of  this,  75.8%  was  spent  on  personal  curative  health  care  and  only \n13.2% on public health (the balance being used in research, training, and administrative costs). \nPublic health is only 31% of the Government health budget, while curative health is 48%, which \nmeans that the Government is directly providing support for curative services at provincial and \nteaching  hospitals  that  could  more  efficiently  be  provided  at  a  much  lower  level  of  the  health \nsystem. The Government spends 6.2% of its budget on health, and only 0.8% on public health \nprograms.  It  seems  unlikely  in  the  current  economic  climate  that  the  percentage  allocated  to \nhealth can be increased or that the total Government budget will expand. However, the amount \nallocated to public and preventive health (which disproportionately benefits the poor) is very low \nand a reallocation of the currently available funds can have a significant impact on the delivery \nof services for the poor. Curative/personal health expenditures are paid mainly from household \nout-of-pocket sources, with social insurance covering only 9% of the costs (2001). The national \nGovernment covers 12% of curative costs and local government 9%. Household out-of-pocket \nspending  amounted  to  42.8%  of  total  health  expenditures, while  social  health  insurance  spent \nP9.3  billion,  or  only  7.8%  of  the  total.  Government  sources  (national  and  local  governments) \naccounted for 37.4% of total health care spending. Efficiency in the system would be improved if \nadditional  costs  for  curative  care  could  be  shifted  from  the  national  Government  to  local \ngovernments by providing first-line curative services and referral at the barangay health stations \n(BHSs)  and  rural  health  units  (RHUs)  instead  of  burdening  the  Department  of  Health  (DOH)-\nretained hospitals with this level of health care. The percentage of curative personal health care \ncovered by social insurance should be greatly increased and increased amounts of government \nhealth funds allocated to public and preventive health programs. \n \nFor  the  wide  variety  of  public,  private  and  non-profit  hospitals,  clinics,  and  medical \n4. \npractices,  financing  sources  include  local  and  central  governments,  various  agencies  within \ngovernments,  locally  and  centrally  operated  health  insurance  schemes,  foreign  and  in-country \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n\ndonations,  and  several  channels  of  formal  and  informal  self-pay.  The  private  health  sector  is \nfinanced  principally  from  user  fees  and  health  insurance  proceeds;  government  subsidies  are \nthe  main  source  of  revenue  for  public  health  facilities  and  programs.  Disadvantages  of  this \ncomplicated mix include high administration costs, weak information systems, cost-shifting (and \nconsequent penalties in terms of mistrust), and conflicting financial incentives for care providers \nand patients. Health insurance contributed less than 10% from 1991\u20132000, although it has been \nsteadily  growing  in  the  past  3  years,  driven  by  special  programs  of  national  and  local \ngovernment that have been targeting the poor. Almost half of the money spent on health came \nfrom  direct  out-of-pocket  payments  by  individuals.  This  is  of  great  concern  because  self-pay \ndecisions, especially of the poor, are often poorly informed, increase supplier-induced demand, \nand reduce the degree of progressivity of health care financing. \n \nThe  Government  decided  to  address  these  weaknesses  in  1995  by  establishing  the \n5. \nNational  Health  Insurance  Program  under  the  management  of  a  new  government  agency,  the \nPhilippines  Health  Insurance  Corporation  or  PhilHealth.  This  brought  together  several  existing \nhealth  insurance  schemes  and  provided  a  vehicle  for  later  aggregation  of  financing \nmechanisms. Attempts to increase the proportion of health financing through this channel have \nbeen only partially successful and less so for the informal sector, which represents a huge part \nof the Philippine economy. Coverage of the poor has increased since 2000, but membership by \nother  sections  of  the  population  has  grown  only  marginally\u2014their  participation  is  desirable  to \noffset some of the costs associated with coverage of the poor. \n \n6. \nDOH controls service quality through various health regulations. The 1963 Food, Drug, \nand  Cosmetic  Act  created  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration,  which  ensures  the  safety  and \npurity  of  foods,  drugs,  and  cosmetics  made  available  to  the  public.  The  Generic  Act  of  1988 \nmandated  the  establishment  of  the  Philippines  National  Drug  Policy  in  response  to  the \ninadequate provision of affordable quality drugs to the people. The 1965 Hospital Licensure Act \nrequires that all hospitals in the country be licensed by DOH. PhilHealth plays an important role \nin maintaining service quality through its accreditation mechanisms: only those health facilities \nmeeting PhilHealth accreditation criteria are reimbursed for health services provided to insured \npatients.  \n \nSince  the  passage  of  the  Local  Government  Code  in  1991,  national  public  health \n7. \nprograms such as tuberculosis control, immunization and family planning are delivered by local \ngovernment units (LGUs) with national Government support in the form of medical supplies and \ntechnical assistance. Private health services providers, both nongovernment organizations and \nfor-profit  private  providers,  have  been  progressively  involved,  in  particular  in  the  tuberculosis \nand family planning programs. \n \n\nHealth Status \n\n2. \n \n8. \nThe  health  status  of  Filipinos  has  improved  in  the  last  two  decades.  Infant  mortality \ndeclined from 57 to 29 per 1000 live births between 1990 and 2003, and under-5 mortality from \n80 to 40. Maternal mortality fell from 209 to 172 per 100,000 live births between 1990 and 1998. \nHowever,  there  are  reasons  for  concern.  First,  the  common  illnesses  of  poverty  (such  as \ninfectious diseases, and malnutrition) have not been reduced to acceptable levels, while social \nand  economic  changes  are  creating  new  costly  challenges  in  terms  of  lifestyle  diseases. \nSecond,  improvements  in  health  status  have  been  less  significant  than  in  many  similar \ncountries.  Third,  while  avoidable  mortality  has  declined,  many  non-fatal  health  problems  have \nreceived less attention. For example, malnutrition in children under-5 only declined from 34.5% \nto 32% between 1990 and 1998. Fourth, the improvements have not been equally shared: for \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nincidence  of  HIV/AIDS  (human \n\nexample,  the  national  infant  mortality  rate  is  29  per  1,000  live  births,  but  it  varies  from  22  in \nManila to 61 in Eastern Visayas. \n \n9. \nFilipinos  are  suffering  from  a  double  burden  of  illness  from  infectious  and  lifestyle \ndiseases, some of which are new to the country. The country has not successfully rid itself of \ninfectious  diseases,  such  as  pneumonia,  tuberculosis,  gastroenteritis,  malaria,  and  measles, \nwhich continue to be leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Acute respiratory infection still \nclaims  the  highest  number  of  lives  of  children  under-5  years  of  age.  Tuberculosis  remains  a \nmajor public health threat: with 297 tuberculosis cases per 100,000. However, lifestyle diseases, \nsuch  as  cardiovascular  diseases,  malignancies,  and  pulmonary  disorders  (e.g.,  asthma  and \nchronic  obstructive  lung  disorders),  are  moving  up  in  the  top  10  causes  of  mortality  and \nmorbidity.  A  growing \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome), and emerging diseases such as SARS (severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome)  and  avian  flu  also  pose  a  potential  threat  to  the  country  and  require  particular \nattention.  \n \n10.  Malnutrition and nutrition deficiencies, major factors influencing the health of mother and \nchildren remain public health issues. Iron deficiency anemia affects 29% of the population, with \nwomen  constituting  a  majority  of  those  afflicted.  Among  pregnant  women,  the  prevalence  of \nvitamin  A  deficiency  increased  from  16.4%  in  1993  to  22.2%  in  1998.  Fertility  continues  to \ndecline  gradually,  but  the  Philippines\u2019  total  fertility  rate1  of  3.7  and  population  growth  rate  of \n2.4% are still considerably higher than the 1998 rates in neighboring Southeast Asian countries. \nWith a national contraceptive prevalence rate of only 45%, much lower than its neighbors, the \nPhilippines  has  a  high  unmet  demand  for  effective  family  planning.  With  poor  reproductive \nhealth, sexually transmitted diseases are not satisfactorily controlled. Many risk factors for the \nrapid spread of HIV/AIDS are present. \n \n \n \n11. \nThe poor have less access to quality health care and consequently are in worse health \nthan  the  rich.  The  Philippines  has  one  of  the  highest  income  disparity  ratios  in  Asia,  with  the \nrichest population decile commanding more than 20 times the income of the lowest population \ndecile in 2003. Public health delivery systems have deteriorated in recent years and support for \npreventive health serving the rural and poor segments of the population has not kept up with the \nincreases in the number of people that must be served.  Poor people reported seeing a doctor \nonly  25%  of  the  time  when  they  were  sick  while  the  rich  saw  a  doctor  48%  of  the  time.  Over \n90% of poor women deliver their children at home with traditional birth attendants, while the rich \ndeliver  in  hospitals  where  the  risk is  much  lower.  This  is  one  of  the  factors  contributing  to  the \nfact that the infant mortality rate among the poorest 20% of the population is more than double \nthat of the richest 20%. The under-5 mortality rate among the poor is nearly three times higher \nthan  among  the  rich.  The  Philippines  has  the  lowest  use  of  contraceptives  and  the  highest \nfertility  rates  and  population  growth  rates  in  Asia  (2.36%  per  year).  The  poor  have  much  less \naccess to family planning methods than do the rich. The poor have 6.5 births per woman (1998) \nwhile the rich have only 2.1 births. Only 20% of the poor use contraceptives as opposed to 30% \nof  the  rich.    Malnutrition  and  maternal  mortality  are  health  issues  linked  to  poverty  and  high \npopulation growth. In the Philippines, malnutrition has not declined significantly during the past \n20  years  from  34%  in  1990  to  32  %  in  2001.  Maternal  mortality  has  declined  less  in  the \nPhilippines  than  in  the  neighboring  countries  of  Southeast  Asia.    Access  to  quality  care, \nespecially  for  the  rural  poor,  has  been  declining.  This  is  due  to  overcrowding  of  higher  level \n\nPoverty and Health \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n1   The total fertility rate gives an indication of the average number of births per women during her childbearing age. \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n \n\npublic  hospitals,  reduced  health  expenditures,  and  a  shift  of  public  resources  away  from  the \nlocally-funded primary and secondary health centers and hospitals, including BHSs and RHUs \nin favor of larger centrally-funded health institutions and tertiary care facilities. \n \nB. \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nOverview \n\n(para.  29)  and \n\nDespite  significant  external  assistance \n\n \nIn contrast to the undeniable achievements in improving the health status of the rapidly \n12.  \nincreasing  population  during  the  last  decades,  progress  in  recent  years  has  slowed.  The \nproportion of fully immunized children over the past 10 years has not reached the desired level \nof  at  least  80%.  In  2001,  only  62.9  %  of  children  were  fully  immunized.  Although  deaths  from \ndiarrhea  for  all  ages  declined  from  1980  to  1990,  its  rate  of  prevalence  among  children \nincreased  sharply  in  1998  to  1  out  of  14  children  under  5.  Variations  in  life  expectancy  and \ninfant and maternal mortality are significant for different regions in the country. These variations \nreflect  the  inequitable  sharing  of  health  services  among  regions  and  among  segments  of  the \npopulation  within  each  region:  there  is  inequity  in  geographical  access  to  health  facilities  and \nhealth  providers,  but  also  in  the  quality  and  the  cost  of  available  health  services.  As  a \nconsequence, the overall performance of the Philippine health sector lags far behind those of its \nSoutheast Asian neighbors. \n \n13. \nrelatively  successful \nimplementation of narrowly focused programs, inequity and inefficiency remain the major issues \nof the Philippines health sector. The large variations in health status among social classes and \namong  regions  reflect  unequal  access  to  health  services  and,  in  particular,  to  quality  health \nservices  and  affordable  drugs.  Quality  health  services  and  drugs  are  available,  but  too  often \nonly in the private sector, are expensive and are concentrated in urban areas. Physical access \nis  limited  in  non-urban  areas  and  many  people,  in  particular  the  poor,  can  only  afford  health \nservices  provided  by  public  facilities,  which  in  most  cases  are  not  able  to  provide  quality \nservices because of resources constraints and inefficiencies in the delivery system. \n \n14.  Much  inefficiency  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  Philippines  health  system  has  not  yet \nadapted to the conditions created by devolution under the Local Government Code (1991). The \ndevolution  of  health  services  from  the  national  government  to  the  LGUs  resulted  in \nfragmentation  of  the  public  health  care  delivery  system,  with  provincial  governments  taking \nresponsibility  for  referral  hospitals,  and  municipal  and  city  governments  managing  primary \nhealth care facilities (RHUs and BHSs) and providing some public health services. At present, \nno formal referral and patient gate-keeping arrangement is in place for DOH-retained and LGU \nhospitals.  Patients  tend  to  by-pass  lower  level  referral  centers  and  proceed  directly  to  higher-\nlevel  facilities,  often  because  of  the  lack  of  drugs  and  competent  health  personnel  at  lower \nfacilities. Drug procurement for public health facilities, no longer centralized, is also fragmented \namong LGUs, resulting in logistics problems, stock outages, and increased drug prices because \ndrugs  are  ordered  in  small  quantities.  Health  personnel  are  also  affected,  as  they  no  longer \nhave a clear career path to advance in the ranks of DOH and thus are more hesitant to practice \nin  remote  areas  and  among  the  poor.  Moreover,  a  salary  ceiling  (50%  of  the  local  budget) \nimposed  by  the  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  reduces  LGUs\u2019  capacity  to  hire \nadditional  staff.  Studies  suggest  a  wide  variance  in  health  system  status  across  LGUs.  The \nLGUs  that  gave  priority  to  health  have  significantly  better  systems  and  health  outcomes  while \nthose that did not suffered. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n2. \n\nStructural Issues \n\nThe poor are mainly using public health services and public hospitals, because that is all \n15. \nthat is available in remote areas or because private providers are too expensive. Improving the \nquality of services provided by public hospitals and facilities is essential if the needs of the poor \nare  to  be  addressed.  However,  besides  severe  under-funding  of  public  hospitals,  the  present \nadministrative  system  provides  few  incentives  for  public  hospitals  to  improve  cost-efficiency. \nThis situation is aggravated by a significant lack of managerial and administrative skills in public \nhospitals. \n \nGovernment  action  is  needed  to  coordinate  the  diverse  actors  in  the  sector  under \n16. \ndecentralization.  In  1999,  DOH  developed  the  Health  Sector  Reform  Agenda  (HSRA),  which \ndefines  key  reforms  and  strategies  required  to  address  inequity  and  inefficiency,  and  achieve \nthe  millennium  development  goals  (MDGs).  The  HSRA  has  the  following  goals:  expand  the \neffective coverage of public health programs; increase access and utilization, especially by the \npoor,  of  hospital  services  from  both  public  and  private  health  care  providers;  and  reduce  the \nfinancial  burden  on  individual  families  in  need of  health  care.  To  achieve  these  goals,  several \nunderlying  structural  constraints  need  to  be  addressed  by  (i)  increasing  public  resources  and \nthe  efficiency  with  which  they  are  used,  (ii)  improving  in  the  health  insurance  system,  (iii) \nimproving  hospitals  and  local  government  health  systems,  and  (iv)  introducing  regulatory \nreforms. A description of the structural reform requirements in these areas follows. \n \n \n \n17. \n At  3.5%  of  gross  domestic  product  in  2001,  health  care  spending  in  the  Philippines  is \nstill below the 5% benchmark set by the World Health Organization. The spending pattern raises \nconcern for the efficiency, equity, and adequacy of health care provision. The disproportionate \nspending  on  personal  health  care  (75.7%)  is  inefficient  because,  relative  to  public  health, \npersonal  health  care  is  less  cost-effective  and  benefits  much  fewer  people  per  peso  of \ninvestment.  Placing  the  largest  burden  of  payment  on  household  out-of-pocket  payments \n(42.8%) is both inefficient and inequitable considering that a large segment of the population is \npoor. \n \n18. \nBy  law,  the  health  insurance  premium  of  the  poorest  (some  25%  of  the  population) \nshould be paid by LGUs, but severe budget constraints prevent LGUs from fully covering their \npoor  populations.  The  national  Government  has  extended  an  earlier  decision  to  provide \nsubsidies to the poorest LGUs to help them cover the poor. However, several issues need to be \naddressed. First, national subsidies are only provided to LGUs that commit their own funds for \nthe insurance premium; many LGUs still need to be convinced to allocate enough resources to \ncover  their poor.  Second,  another  25%  of  the  population,  mostly  poor, are  not  covered  by  the \nlaw and cannot afford to pay the full cost of health care. Third, even those poor who are covered \nare not aware of the benefits and are not utilizing health services effectively. Finally, the benefit \npackages of PhilHealth need to be improved to better respond to the needs of the poor. Health \ninsurers  are  still  studying  how  to  establish  adequate  mechanisms  for  specifying  the  volumes \nand  types  of  services;  appropriate  prices;  and  control  of  utilization,  costs,  and  quality  of  care. \nPhilHealth has made some progress in the last 2 or 3 years but much remains to be done. For \nexample,  the  basis  for  payment  for  inpatient  care  is  still  mainly  on  the  basis  of  days  of  stay, \nwhich  encourages  prolongation  of  the  period  of  hospitalization.  Fee  for  service  is  always \nproblematic  to  the  extent  that  few  patients  are  sufficiently  well-informed  to  judge  whether  the \nservices  are  appropriate  or  reasonably  priced.  Given  the  particular  relations  between  service \nproviders  and  patients  in  the  health  sector,  there  are  many  opportunities  for  supplier-induced \ndemand and unnecessary or otherwise inappropriate care. \n \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\nThe Philippines is fortunate to have many skilled and dedicated health professionals who \n19. \ndo  a  good  job  in  the  circumstances.  However,  the  many  workforce  problems  include  low \nmotivation, poor working standards, lack of flexibility of roles and functions, and poor training in \nsome  clinical  areas.  The  uneven  distribution  of  clinical  staff  is  a  major  problem.  One \ndistributional  aspect  is  the  concentration  of  health  professionals  in  urban  areas,  and  acute \nshortages  in  some  of  the  more  remote  rural  areas.  Another  aspect  is  the  sometimes \ninappropriate  mix  of  staff.  The  Government\u2019s  target  for  barangay  health  workers  is  1  per  20 \nhouseholds,  but  the  actual  ratio  was  1  per  72  households  in  2000.2  The  doctor  to  population \nratio is also below the target (1 per 26,000 compared with the target of 1 per 20,000). There is a \nsimilar  trend  in  the  nurse  to  population  ratio.  The  issue  is  to  retain  a  portion  of  the  overseas \ncontract  workers  who  are  well-trained  health  professionals.  Lifting  of  human  resource \nconstraints  is  critical  for  improving  performance  of  the  health  system  and  deserves  urgent \nattention.  These  constraints  are  linked  to  conditions  of  service,  training,  remuneration,  and \nincentives;  and  will  fundamentally  determine  capacities  for  sustained  improvement  in  health \nservices. \n \nIn  total,  problems  of  efficiency  and  effectiveness  are  significant  at  all  levels  of  health \n20. \ncare facilities, whether Government or private. One reason is that few incentives are provided to \nencourage  care  providers  to  be  aware  of,  and  comply  with,  best  practice.  Community-based \ncare is reasonably well regulated with regard to selected services (such as child immunizations), \nbut  many  health  care  providers  are  inadequately  trained  or  motivated.  At  the  other  extreme, \nmany  highly  trained  medical  specialists  believe  they  have  the  right  to  autonomy  in  their \npractices,  and  may  resist  attempts  to  conduct  auditing  processes.  This  is  reflected  in  the \nrelatively  high  degree  of  clinical  practice  variation  in  both  cost  and  method  of  care.  Second, \nclinical  teamwork  is  often  unsatisfactory.  This  is  reflected  in  poor  communications  between \nclinical  professions\u2014and  especially  between  doctors  and  nurses.  It  is  also  evident  between \nhealth care settings. For example, communications and coordination are typically weak between \nhospitals,  community  health  centers,  and  general  practitioners.  Third,  consumers  are  seldom \nadequately  involved  in  the  health  care  process.  This  means  they  may  be  provided  with  care \nabout which they have  been poorly informed, and that they do not feel empowered to provide \nfeedback on their health care service experiences in the interests of service improvement. \n \nClinical  pathways  and  clinical  practice  guidelines  (CPGs)3  have  emerged  as  critical \n21. \ncomponents of well-run health systems in the last 20 years. Some use is made of CPGs in the \nPhilippines. For example, midwives in rural health units have simple pathways for common case \ntypes  that  are  based  on  national  designs.  A  few  of  the  more  innovative  hospitals  are \nprogressively  introducing  clinical  pathways  of  their  own  volition,  for  reasons  of  quality  control, \ncompetitive advantage, and reduction of risks of litigation. PhilHealth has mandated the use of \npathways  for  a  small  number  of  case  types,  including  uncomplicated  pregnancies, ambulatory \ntreatment of tuberculosis, and cataract removal. However, most health care remains uncovered \nby CPGs and clinical pathways. \n \n22. \nOnly 13% of total health expenditures are used for public health. Public health programs, \nsuch as family planning (as part of reproductive health), the program against tuberculosis, and \nhealthy life-style promotion, lack adequate financing despite their high benefit for the poor and \n\n                                                 \n2   Department of Health. 2000. Field Health Service Information System. Manila. \n3  A clinical pathway is a form used in the management of an individual patient\u2019s care (and there are different forms \nfor each case type). It guides the care team (thus increasing efficiency and quality of care), serves as an integrated \nhealth record of the care actually given by all types of clinicians, and informs patients of the care they may expect \nto  receive.  Clinical  practice  guidelines  outline  a  more  broad  description  of  case  specific  treatments.  Clinical \nprotocols is a more generic term for both, clinical pathways and clinical practice guidelines.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\ntheir  significant  positive  externalities  for  society.  Moreover,  these  programs  suffer  from \ninefficient organization and incentives. Yearly budgetary allocations prevent adequate planning \nand, combined with lack of management skills at the local level, result in logistics problems and \nrupture  of  stock  of  supplies.  National  subsidies  are  allocated  to  the  LGUs  responsible  for \nimplementing the program, but subsidies are allocated on a per capita basis without taking into \nconsideration  LGU  need  or  fiscal  capacity.  And  despite  progress  in  recent  years  (e.g.,  in \naddressing  tuberculosis)  tremendous  opportunities  still  exist  to  better  involve  the  private  and \nnon-profit health sector, for example in the family planning and tuberculosis programs.  \n \n23. \nDevolution  has  resulted  in  many  improvements.  For  example,  several  LGUs  (including \nthose  in  Capiz,  Pangasinan,  and  Pasay  City)  have  been  remarkably  successful  in  enrolling \nindigents  in  the  national  health  insurance  scheme.  Some  LGUs  (and  particularly  in  Capiz  and \nPangasinan)  have  improved  methods  of  drugs  procurement  and  management  in  response  to \ngaps in supply. Bukidnon LGU made some innovative changes in contracts for hospital staff to \novercome  recruitment  difficulties  under  the  national  payment  rules.  Other  local initiatives  have \nconcerned facilities and resource sharing between public and private health facilities in Makati \nCity,  Negros  Oriental,  and  South  Cotabato;  integration  of  several  development  activities  (in \nNegros Oriental); improvements in continuity of governance (in South Cotabato); and improved \nreferral systems (through interlocal health zones [ILHZs]).  \n \n24.  Many  problems  have  resulted  from  the  failure  to  give  adequate  consideration  to  the \ncomplexities of devolution. One obvious initial problem was that of disagreement about the cost \nof services transferred to the LGUs in relation to the additional revenues allocated to the LGUs. \nAnother  issue  relates  to  the  fragmentation  of  referral  systems  and  the  coordination  and \nintegration of services. The longstanding problems of service coordination at the local level were \naccentuated by the devolution process. Although greater local autonomy created opportunities \nto  integrate  services  within  each  LGU,  it  had  several  unintended  adverse  effects,  including  a \nweakening of coordination between LGUs. One corrective measure was to develop the concept \nof  ILHZs,  whereby  LGUs  could  agree  to  collaborate  to  improve  the  quality,  efficiency,  and \neffectiveness  of  health  service  provision.  Details  of  the  design  were  specified  in  a  DOH \nadministrative  order  in  2001  (AO  37).  The  idea  was  partially  tested  in  a  few  provinces  and \nparticularly  in  South  Cotabato  in  the  Integrated  Community  Health  Services  Project  (ICHSP),4 \nwhich  was  implemented  from  1997  to  2003.  But  evidence  regarding  the  cost-effectiveness  of \nthe specified design is lacking. \n \n25.  Many  regulations  are  outdated,  predating  devolution.  This  has  a  particularly  significant \nimpact for the procurement of drugs and development of an efficient public-private partnership \nin  the  health  sector.  With  devolution,  drugs  are  procured  locally,  resulting  often  in  more \nexpensive drugs and creating problems for quality control of drugs and medical supplies. Lack \nof  clear  regulations  for  coordination  with  the  private  health  sector  has  resulted  in  missed \nopportunities for better coordination and complementarity and sometimes led to a chaotic supply \nof hospital services (facilities and medical equipment) across provinces. \n \n26. \nIn summary, the structural issues, which require reforms, revolve around access of the \npoor  to  the  insurance  system,  funding  and  quality  of  both  hospitals  and  local  health  systems, \naccess  to  quality  public  health  care,  and  provision  of  regulatory  incentives  and  capacity  for \nincreased  efficiency.  To  implement  these  reforms  effectively,  coordinated  interventions  are \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  1995.

ADB's  ICHSP  provided  very  important  lessons  for  the  HSRA.  The \nproblems  and  issues  are  not  unique  to  the  Philippines.  A  number  of  key  lessons  have  been \nlearned  both  from  developing  and  developed  country  experience  (Appendix  3).  While  health \nsystems  vary  enormously,  these  lessons  are  nevertheless  applicable  across  most  systems. \nFirst, in developing countries any initially focus should be on the poor and basic health services, \nknowing  that  the  poor  are  benefiting  most  from  basic  health  care  at  the  community  level. \nSecond,  the  structure  of  health-care  systems  must  be  changed  so  that  competitive  pressures \npush  them  in  a  more  useful  direction,  enhancing  the  power  of  purchasers  and  increasing \ncompetition  in  the  supply  of  medical  care.  Another  lesson  is  that  just  because  governments \nfinance  so  much  of  health  care,  they  do  not  necessarily  have  to  deliver  it  themselves. \nGovernments should also review their role as regulators. A better role for regulators would be to \nsponsor  competition.  Regulators  should  set  out  quality  standards  and  monitor  performance, \nbuilding  on  some  positive  initiatives  in  other  countries.  The  re-engineering  of  health  care  will \nrequire reform in the way medical providers are paid. Successful reform will involve rewarding \nquality  and  performance,  and  paying  directly  for  better  outcomes,  and  for  steps  that  reduce \ncosts of care. \n \n28. \nExperience  in  implementing  the  ICHSP  and  other  Philippine  health  sector  projects  has \nshown that successful implementation of development-supported projects in a devolved context \nrequires a well-planned effort to build stakeholder partnerships. The ICHSP initially experienced \nconfrontations  between  the  central  Government  agencies  and  the  LGUs,  and  between  LGUs \nthemselves. The challenge was to change confrontation into collaboration; this occurred as the \nstakeholders  saw  the  benefits  of  partnership.  The  ICHSP  eventually  became  an  effective \nvehicle  to  re-establish  collegial  partnership  between  DOH  and  the  various  levels  of  LGUs  in \nplanning, managing, and financing health services within a devolved set-up. In a significant way, \nit helped to break barriers, bridge gaps, and bring about a new partnership in managing health \nservices in the country. Additional recurrent issues hampering effective project implementation \nin  the  Philippines  include  a  prolonged  approval  process  and  time  consuming  procedures  for \nprocurement  of  goods  and  civil  works  encountered  at  the  central  level.  Implementation  of  the \nICHSP tested the initiative of empowering LGUs: bidding of civil works was entirely managed by \nLGUs, including opening of bids in the project provinces. This positive experience demonstrates \nthat contract award processing can be made significantly more effective and efficient. \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n \n \n29. \nExternal  assistance  to  the  sector  has  been  extensive  but  has  not  had  significant \nstructural impact as it was mainly piloting and testing technical improvements under devolution. \nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided the initial support for the \nHSRA through the Health Sector Reform Technical Assistance Program. With the assistance of \nthe  World  Bank,  DOH  has  developed  comprehensive  reform  proposals  for  social  health \ninsurance, drug procurement and, as part of the Second Women\u2019s Health and Safe Motherhood \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n5. \n\nOpportunities \n\nProject  (WHSMP  II),  reproductive  health-family  planning.  The  World  Bank  also  supports  the \nEarly  Childhood  Development  Project,  jointly  financed  by  ADB,5  and  the  Social  Expenditure \nManagement  Project  2,  used  for  budgetary  support  in  procuring  vaccines,  tuberculosis  drugs \nand oral contraceptives. USAID provides technical assistance to the tuberculosis program, the \nInfectious  Disease  Surveillance  and  Control  Project  and  the  Integrated  Family  Planning  and \nMaternal Health Program. The family planning program has also been supported by Deutsche \nGesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbei (German Agency for Technical Cooperation, GTZ) \nand  USAID.  GTZ  has  tested  community  participation  mechanisms  in  local  financing  and \nsupports  reproductive  health  and  family  planning.  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  is \ninvolved in tuberculosis control, the Philippine Pharmacopeia project, measles elimination, and \ncommunity  health.  Other  partners  include  the  United  Nations  agencies  (Wolrd  Health \nOrganization,  United  Nations  Children's  Fund  [UNICEF],  United  Nations  Population  Fund,  and \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme),  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development, \nand the Austrian, Spanish, and Belgian cooperation. ADB has been a long time partner of DOH \nwith  its  cofinancing  of  the  Women's  Health  and  Safe  Motherhood  Project6  and  the  Integrated \nCommunity  Health  Services  Project7  cofinanced  by  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment. ADB partnered with DOH in other projects: Early Childhood Development Project \nand the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Details are provided in Appendix 4. \n \n \n \n30. \nAs  a  consequence  of  the  technical  focus  of  much  assistance,  many  of  the  strategic \nobjectives  of  the  HSRA  still  to  be  operationalized.  Only  some  reforms  have  thus  been  tested \nwith the assistance of DOH\u2019s development partners and lessons learned. The Government has \nauthorized  collection  of  user  fees  and  retention  of  revenue  in  DOH  hospitals,  and  some \nprovinces  have  successfully  tested  financial  and  managerial  autonomy  in  their  provincial \nhospitals. The enrollment of some indigents in PhilHealth by the LGUs has taken place in most \nconvergence sites.8 Pooled procurement of drugs in a few provinces has significantly reduced \nprices. In several LGUs, public and private hospitals have forged agreements to share high-tech \nmedical equipment, or to use a private hospital as a referral hospital for the area. Some LGUs \nhave  provided  tax  incentives  to  the  private  sector  to  facilitate  services  to  the  poor  by  private \nhospitals.  In  several  parts  of  the  country,  LGUs  have  initiated  the  establishment  of  ILHZs \ninvolving  all  health  services  providers  in  the  area.  Involvement  of  the  community  and  the \ndevelopment  of  a  functional  community-based  referral  system  have  been  successfully \nintroduced in several ILHZs. One ILHZ in Negros Oriental registered with the Security Exchange \nCommission,  facilitating  independent  management  with  for  example  independent  hiring  of \nadditional health personnel with increased salaries. These experiments have provided important \ninsights for DOH and LGUs. \n \n31. \nDOH  has  asked  all  its  development  partners  to  support  the  HSRA.  The  ADB  health \nsector policy,9 with its emphasis on access for all to essential health services that are effective, \ncost-efficient  and  affordable,  fully  supports  the  HSRA's  objectives.  In  view  of  this,  ADB  has \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  1998.

Policy for the Health Sector. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\nproposed  the  Health  Sector  Development  Program  (HSDP)  taking  into  account  the  lessons \nlearned. The key principles utilized are: \n \n \n \n\nshift public spending to the poor and vulnerable; \ndecrease  costs  by  encouraging  competition  among  providers,  increasing  use  of \nefficient clinical protocols, and focusing at basic levels of care; and \nincrease  quality  of  human  resources  in  clinical  areas,  facility  management,  and \npolicy.  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\nInitially, the interventions supported by the HSDP will be budget neutral and after the Philippines \nrecovers  from  its  current  fiscal  constraints,  expenditures  will  rise  to  international  norms.  The \nprogram loan will provide support for defraying the adjustment costs of regulatory changes, and \nthe investment loan will assist the Government to implement the changes. \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n32. \nThe overall goal of the HSDP is to improve the health status of the population, especially \nof the poor, and achieve health-related MDG targets. The purpose of the HSDP is to increase \nutilization of affordable and financially sustainable quality health services by the poor based on \nthe progressive implementation of cost-saving and output-enhancing health sector reforms that \nare  guided  by  the  HSRA.  The  focus  is  on  results,  emphasizing  improved  access  to  health \nservices  and  better  outcomes  for  the  poor,  and  including  greater  access  to  essential  drugs, \nstrengthened health systems and better management. The HSDP consists of a program loan to \nsupport national health sector reforms and an investment loan to finance specific interventions. \nThe  program  loan  will  catalyze  the  implementation  of  health  sector  reforms  by  creating  a \nsupportive policy environment for substantial changes in sector operations and for investments \nat  the  national  and  local  levels.  The  project  loan  will  advocate,  design,  initiate,  and  evaluate \nspecific interventions in support of the HSRA at the national level and in five selected provinces \nwith  the  objective  to  translate  agreed  policy  reform  into  changes  in  corporate  cultures  and  in \nconcrete improvements of health services, especially for the poor. The program framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nB. \n \n33. \nADB has been at the core of policy dialogue in the sector over a number of years. The \nkey  policy  reforms  targeted  under  this  Program  have  been  discussed  at  donor  forums  and, \ntogether with DOH, the key agenda items have been developed. As other development partners \nmay become involved in implementing HSRA in other provinces, it is also essential that DOH be \nable  to  coordinate  efficiently  all  external  assistance  for  HSRA  and  institutionalization  of  this \ncoordination is required. This refers particularly to grant funds that may become available from \nbilateral donors and the European Union.10 The HSDP will address the root causes of the lack \nof  substantial  changes  since  the  publication  of  the  HSRA  in  1999  by  putting  into  place  the \nappropriate  incentives  for  change  in  systems,  processes,  and  rewards.  The  HSDP  takes  into \naccount the lack of fiscal resources available to the Government to invest in health and poverty \nreduction;  and  proposes  a  refocus  of  health  spending  and  higher  expenditures  in  areas  that \ndirectly benefit the poor. The HSDP follows a strategy that invests in people and primary health \nfacilities,  and  focuses  on  cost  containment  and  cost  efficiency.  The  envisaged  policy  actions \n\nImportant Features \n\n                                                 \n10  The  European  Union  has  earmarked  EURO32  million  in  support  of  implementing  HSRA  and  has  expressed  its \n\nintention to cofinance the Program. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\ninterventions  emphasize  performance-based  resource  allocation, \n\nincreased \nand  reform \naccountability and good governance, and consumer participation. The structure of the program \nloan, based on the five pillars of the HSRA, enables these strategies, and the lessons learned \n(paras. 27 and 28), to be integrated with ongoing and future investments in the sector (Appendix \n4).  The  Program  aims  at  system-wide  changes  of  organizational  and  professional  cultures, \nmethods of health care financing, resource allocation and health care regulation. \n \n34. \nThe  Program  reforms  will  be  supported  by  the  project  loan,  which  will  implement  all \nproposed  policy  changes  in  selected  pilot  LGUs  (convergence  sites).  Convergence  sites \ncomprise  clusters  of  LGUs  in  the  provinces  of  Ifugao,  Ilocos  North,  Nueva  Vizcaya,  Oriental \nMindoro,  and  Romblon.  In  order  to  learn  a  maximum  of  lessons  for  national  replication,  the \nProject area includes provinces with high and low fiscal capacity. HSDP however was designed \nas a poverty intervention, and in all provinces, the focus will be on the needs of the poor and \nmarginalized  groups  with  special  attention  to  indigenous  people.  The  Project  loan  is  also \nstructured  by  the  five  pillars  of  HSRA.  The  two  loans  of  the  Program  are  the  first  external \nassistance  supporting  a  systematic  and  comprehensive  implementation  of  the  reforms  at \nnational level and in selected convergence sites. DOH intends to implement HSRA in ten more \nprovinces  during  the  coming  years.  Close  collaboration  among  development  partners  under \nDOH\u2019s leadership has been going on during the last years and will form the basis for analyzing \nlessons learned before additional external assistance will help to extend the implementation of \nthe HSRA to other provinces.  \n \nC. \n \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjective  \n\n \n35. \nThe program loan supports the overall goal of the HSDP by promoting cost-effectiveness \nof  health  services  and  equity  of  health  status  through  implementation  of  an  integrated  set  of \nhealth  sector  reforms.  The  system-wide  changes  will  largely  concern  improving  the  ways  that \nHSRA  reforms  are  implemented  and  managed  at  all  levels  in  the  health  sector.  The  program  \nloan support three fundamental objectives: (i) improve the focus on the poor and primary health \ncare,  (ii)  support  structural  reform  of  sector  organizations,  and  (iii)  operationalize  regulatory \nreform and improve governance in the sector.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \nThe  policy  matrix  and  the  development  policy  letter  in  appendix  5  and  6  describe  the \n36. \nreforms  considered  important  and  necessary  to  achieve  the  HSRA  objectives  and  specific \nsector investments. The reforms are grouped into the five HSRA reform areas: (i) social health \ninsurance,  (ii)  hospital  autonomy,  (iii)  public  health  programs,  (iv)  ILHZs,  and  (v)  regulatory \nfunctions. The program loan will also support reform in health sector governance, although the \nmain thrust of activities in this area will be undertaken through the project loan. \n \n \n \n37. \nSocial health insurance reforms aim at expanding PhilHealth coverage to at least 85% of \nthe  population,  with  universal  coverage  of  the  poor.  The  objectives  of  the  reforms  are  to \nincrease membership and improve benefit packages. To increase coverage of the poor, national \nsubsidies that complement local governments\u2019 partial payment of the health insurance premium \nfor the poor will continue, and the Department of Budget Management will establish appropriate \nmechanisms to ensure that national funds are timely remitted to PhilHealth. The establishment \n\nHealth Care Finance Reform \n\na. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nHospital Reforms \n\nby PhilHealth of progressive premium contributions based on one\u2019s capacity to pay will improve \nfairness and facilitate increased coverage of the informal sector. PhilHealth will pilot a low health \ninsurance  premium  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  who  cannot  benefit  by  law  from  government \nsubsidies  (about  25%  of  the  population).  PhilHealth  will  multiply  enrollment  and  payment \ncenters  and  authorize  group  enrollment  through  cooperatives,  unions,  and  other  community \ngroups.  The  benefit  package  will  be  improved,  with  better  coverage  of  hospital  services, \ncatastrophic  and  expensive  illnesses,  and  outpatient  services.  Treatment  and  prevention  of \ndiseases that still represent a public health threat (tuberculosis, rabies, and vaccine-preventable \ninfections), and family planning will progressively be covered. To increase utilization of services, \nPhilHealth will develop and implement an information campaign, especially targeting the poor. \n \n \n \n38.  \nThe  reforms  will  enhance  the  sustainability  and  efficiency  of  hospitals  by  restructuring \nthem into corporations and supporting participation of the private and nonprofit sector. They will \nalso encourage the upgrading of lower tier hospitals to provide better quality care, relieving the \nstress  on  regional  hospitals.  Hospital  reforms  will  ensure  that  quality  health  services  are \nprovided cost-efficiently, linking hospital revenue to quality of services. Financially autonomous \npublic hospitals are expected to become less dependent on direct budget subsidies from DOH. \nA first step is to secure authority for public hospitals to earn, retain and utilize all their revenues. \nThe two main sources of revenues will be: users\u2019 fees and reimbursement of hospital services \nby  PhilHealth.11  Hospital  autonomy,  however,  will  require  building  management  capacity  of \nhospital administrators and developing good corporate governance through various guidelines, \nregulations and accountability mechanisms. Various management tools such as business plans, \ncontinuing quality improvement programs and use of clinical protocols will be introduced. While \nsubsidies will still be required, they will become performance-based rather than facility-based. \n \n \n \n39. \nThe  objective  of  these  reforms  is  to  increase  financial  resources  for,  and  effectiveness \nof, primary health care. Public health programs such as immunization, the tuberculosis program \nand  the  reproductive  health  and  family  planning  program  are  cost-effective  approaches  to \nimprove the health of the Filipinos and achieve the MDGs. With devolution, DOH continues to \nplan, monitor and finance these programs, but LGUs are responsible for delivering the services. \nReforms  will  secure  continuous  financing  of  the  Program  through  multi-year,  performance-\nbased budgets. To improve equity and efficiency, DOH subsidies to the LGUs to implement the \nprograms  will  no  longer  be  allocated  on  a  population-based  formula,  but  rather  based  on  the \nLGUs\u2019 fiscal capacity and poverty prevalence. The reforms will be tested by focusing first on the \nprogram  against  tuberculosis  and the  family  planning  program,  both  high  priority  programs  for \nthe Government. \n \n \n \n40. \n The  fragmentation  of  the  local  health  systems,  an  unforeseen  result  of  devolution, \nneeds  to  be  addressed.  ILHZs  will  be  established\u2014and  ultimately  legally  registered  as \nautonomous entities\u2014by convincing neighboring LGUs in specific catchment areas to cooperate \n\nLocal Health System Reform \n\nPublic Health Reforms \n\nd. \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n11  PhilHealth only reimburses hospitals,  public or private, that are accredited. Lack of investment (rehabilitation and \nmedical equipment) in many public hospitals sometimes prevents accreditation and most often reduces the quality \nof services they can offer. The investment loan will provide the needed resources for hospitals in the five selected \nproject provinces. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\ne. \n\nRegulatory Reform \n\nand share functional facilities and services in a local health network involving the private health \nproviders. To increase efficiency and as an incentive for the LGUs to collaborate, PhilHealth will \ndevelop accreditation criteria and mechanisms that specifically apply to ILHZs. \n \n \n \n41.   Health-related  regulations  will  be  updated  to  answer  new  requirements  related  to \ndevolution.  Focusing  on  the  need  to  guarantee  quality  of  services,  regulatory  reforms  will  first \nstreamline licensing and accreditation procedures for health facilities, strengthening in particular \nprimary  health  care  services  and  ensuring  an  equitable  and  cost-effective  distribution  of \nhospitals and high-technology medical devices across the country. High priority is also given to \ndeveloping regulations and incentives that will ensure availability of quality drugs at a cheaper \nprice.  Another  priority,  highlighted  by  the  recent  SARS  and  avian  flu  outbreaks  in  Southeast, \nand Eastern Asia, is the need to strengthen the national disease surveillance system. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n42. \nThe proposed loan size is based on the estimated direct short- to medium-term costs of \nthe reform program net of $280 million. In addition, associated restructuring costs resulting from \nHSRA  implementation  are  substantial  and  include  the  following  (Appendix  7):  (i)  according  to \nthe  law,  national  Government  and  LGUs  share  the  costs  for  subsidizing  the  payment  of \nPhilHealth  premiums  of  the  poor.  With  the  HSRA  and  in  accordance  with  the  law,  the \nGovernment is aiming at universal coverage from the current estimated 50% coverage; (ii) the \ncost  of  nationwide  social  marketing  and  information  campaigns  addressing  all  relevant \nstakeholders,  including  DOH  personnel  at  central  and  regional  level,  local  authorities, \nprofessional organizations, and the population at large are significant; and (iii) additional efforts \nof testing, monitoring, and evaluating reform interventions by DOH and LGUs will require strong \ninputs  in  terms  of  staff  years  and  operational  costs.  The  Government  estimates  that \nimplementation of the reforms may eventually cost more than $2.2 billion. \n \n43. \nThe Government has requested a loan of $200,000,000 equivalent from ADB's ordinary \ncapital  resources  to  help  finance  the  HSDP  and  cover  adjustment  costs.  The  loan  will  have  a \n15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own ondependent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The loan, expected to be utilized over 16 months, from \n1  January  2005  to  30  June  2007,  will  be  released  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $100 \nmillion  will  be  made  available  upon  meeting  the  conditions  of  the  first  tranche  and  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  second  tranche  of  $100  million  is  expected  to  be  released  in  mid-2006  or \nabout  15  months  after  first  tranche  release.  Prior  to  the  release  of  the  second  tranche,  the \nGovernment will be required to meet the agreed upon conditions described in the policy matrix \nsummarized in Appendix 5 to demonstrate satisfactory progress with program implementation. \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nDOF will be the Executing Agency for the program loan. DOH and its agencies as well \n44. \nas other concerned departments will be responsible for implementing the reforms described in \nthe policy matrix and reporting implementation progress to ADB. The loan proceeds will be used \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\nby the Government for the coverage of the poor by PhilHealth; to implement nation-wide social \nmarketing and information campaigns; and to cover the additional costs of testing, monitoring, \nand evaluating reform interventions by DOH and LGUs. \n\n5. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  review  program  implementation;  and  assess  the \n45. \nimplementation  and  impact  of  the  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  reforms,  and  other  changes \nenvisaged  under  the  HSDP.  To  facilitate  such  a  review  the  Government,  through  DOH,  will \nprovide relevant data and information in a quarterly report. DOH will submit to ADB a detailed \nreport on the progress and impact of policy reforms during the first year of the HSDP within 3 \nmonths after the end of the first year of implementation. The measures specified as conditions \nfor  the  release  of  the  second  tranche  of  the  loan  are  set  out  in  the  program  policy  matrix \n(Appendix 5). \n \n \n \n46. \nThe policy loan proceeds will be used to finance the equivalent foreign exchange costs \nof items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding listed ineligible items and \nimports financed under other official development assistance. The Government will certify that \n(i)  if  the  loan  proceeds  will  finance  imports  already  made,  the  value  of  eligible  imports  in  the \nperiod concerned exceeds the amount of the requested withdrawal, or (ii) if the loan proceeds \nwill finance items to be imported, the value of eligible imports in the immediately preceding 1-\nyear  period  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  requested  withdrawal  plus  all  other \namounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  during  the succeeding 1-year  period.  Appendix  8  provides \nthe list of ineligible items. \n \n \n \n47. \nThroughout implementation, the steering committee and the UPMD will monitor quarterly \nthe  implementation  of  policy  and  institutional  reforms  envisaged  under  the  HSDP.  In \ncooperation  with  the  UMPD,  ADB  will  carry  out  semiannual  review  missions  to  assess \nimplementation of the policy agenda and discuss major policy developments with the concerned \nagencies.  Such  missions  will  be  fielded  to  assess  whether  conditions  for  the  release  of  the \nsecond  loan  tranche  have  been  fulfilled.  The  first  tranche  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness, expected in December 2004. The second tranche is expected to be released by \nJune 2006 (or about 18 months after the first tranche). To obtain the release of the second loan \ntranche,  the  Government  will  be  required  to  carry  out  actions  identified  in  the  policy  matrix  as \nconditions  for  tranche  release,  and  to  demonstrate  satisfactory  progress  in  implementing  the \nproject loan. \n \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n48. \nThe Government will use the local currency funds generated by the HSDP loan to meet \nprogram  expenditures  and  associated  costs  of  reform  and  to  help  maintain  current  levels  of \nsocial expenditures. \n \nD. \n \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \n49. \nBased on the goal of the HSDP, the Health Sector Development Project aims to make \nsignificant improvements in the health status of poor, marginalized, and vulnerable groups of the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\npopulation in selected provinces by increasing their access to, and utilization of, quality health \nservices. The Project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of delivery of health care to \nthe poor by focusing on the investments and HSRA reforms needed to implement a number of \nCPGs  critical  to  the  health  of  the  poor.  Interventions  will  support  the  implementation  of  these \nCPGs in selected convergence sites, and in DOH, PhilHealth and other agencies at the central \nand  regional  levels.  Project  loan  implementation  will  be  progressive  and  performance-based, \nresponding to  identifiable  outputs  and  achievements  of  the  convergence  sites,  to  demonstrate \nthe effectiveness and the cost-efficiency of the HSRA in the selected provinces and thus provide \nthe foundation for expanding the HSRA package into other provinces. \n \n50. \nThe  Project  is  designed  as  a  sector  project  and  is  expected  to  cover  five  provinces. \nCurrently,  five  provinces  have  been  surveyed  and  are  eligible  for  project  support:  three \nneighboring provinces in the north of Luzon  (Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, and Nueva Vizcaya); and two \npoor  island  provinces  (Oriental  Mindoro  and  Romblon)  although  other  provinces  may \nparticipate. These provinces are convergence sites identified by DOH as having a strong LGU \ncommitment  to  health  reforms  including  a  willingness  to  borrow  and  to  provide  counterpart \nfunds.  This  will  be  confirmed  by  contracts  between  DOH  and  the  LGUs  before  the  start  of \nproject activities in the concerned provinces. These provinces are relatively easy to access from \nManila, a major advantage for project administration as learned from  previous ADB supported \nprojects. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \n\na. \n\nHealth Sector Governance \n\n \n51. \nThe  Project  consists  of  five  components  implemented  through  two  funding  streams. \nDOH  will  finance  consultancy  and  sector  capacity  building  activity  and  investments  to  support \nHSRA  implementation.  The  special  purpose  entity  nominated  as  the  Municipal  Finance \nCorporation (MFC) will provide finance to LGUs to undertake required civil works and equipment \npurchase. The integration of activity and outputs across the five components is set out below.    \n \n \n \n52. \nThis  component  will  strengthen  participating  provinces  and  LGUs  to  implement  the \nHSRA.  Focusing  on  the  promotion  of  a  cross-disciplinary  culture  promoting  efficient  and \neffective care, it will enhance appropriate administrative and clinical skills, encourage adoption \nof  improved  clinical  protocols  (CPGs  and  clinical  pathways),  facilitate  participation  in  health \nmanagement and planning, and strengthen monitoring systems that allow effective oversight. To \nstrengthen DOH, capacity building at all levels will be supported by a master plan, specific staff \ndevelopment  activities,  fellowships  and  information  campaigns.  Crucial  expertise  in  areas  like \nhealth financing and economics, management, sociology and anthropology, and marketing will \nbe needed at national, provincial, and municipal health offices. The Project will help DOH design \nand  develop  a  national  resource  center.  The  center  will  be  established  (i)  to  provide  policy \nanalysis  and  advice,  (ii)  to  spearhead  operations  research,  and  (iii)  as  a  repository  of  HSRA \nresource  materials.  The  center  will  systematically  document  lessons  learned  from  HSRA \nimplementation in the provinces, as well as compile and disseminate health-related information \nbased on a revamped health information system. Consumer satisfaction surveys, reflecting the \nperceived  quality  of  services,  will  be  initiated  and  the  results  published  to  support  informed \nchoice and foster competition. Support for more effective public-private partnerships will include \nhospital area planning and improved implementation of CPGs including public health programs, \nin  particular  the  program  against  tuberculosis  and  the  reproductive  health  program  including \nfamily planning. This component will provide the resources to design the systems for extension \nof PhilHealth coverage to lower income groups, implemented through the following components. \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nRegulatory Reforms \n\nOther activities under this component are more logically discussed in relation to the components \nthey support and are set out in the following sections. \n \n \n \n53. \nThis component will provide systems to DOH and LGUs to bolster cost-efficiency in the \nhealth  sector.  DOH  will  institute  systems  to  help  provinces  and  LGUs  increase  efficiency  and \nreduce the cost of essential drug purchases, promoting the use of generic drugs. The devolution \nof some functions of the Bureau of Food and Drugs, such as monitoring and rapid preliminary \ntesting  of  drug  quality,  will  be  piloted  in  the  project  area.  DOH  will  help  LGUs  and  ILHZs  to \nestablish  already  successfully  tested  mechanisms  for  the  procurement  and  distribution  of \npharmaceuticals,  such  as  outsourcing  the  procurement  of  drugs  and  pooled  procurement. \nActivities  under  the  health  sector  governance  component  will  design  and  test  approaches  like \nsocial  franchising  in  the  pharmaceutical  sector,  currently  tested  in  more  than  10  provinces, \nwhich is regarded as appropriate for procurement and distribution of low-cost quality medicines \nto remote areas and supporting involvement of the private health sector. Also under the health \nsector  governance  component,  DOH  will  carefully  monitor  LGUs  and  ILHZs  to  ensure \nsatisfactory performance before continuing and extending the new policies.  \n \n54. \nTo  support  these  initiatives,  performance  will  become  the  basis  for  resource  allocation \nthrough  the  PhilHealth  insurance  system.  Designed  under  the  health  sector  governance \ncomponent,  other  cost-containment  measures  such  as  the  introduction  of  competition  into  the \nprovision  of  services,  guidelines  on  the  procurement  of  high-tech  medical  equipment,  and  the \nprovision of expensive health services, will also be implemented to avoid oversupply and cost- \ninefficiencies. The Project will provide systems to PhilHealth so it may adopt a fee schedule for \nreimbursement of services and pharmaceuticals, which contains appropriate incentives to make \nhealth care service provision more accessible, competitive, and equitable both in public and in \nprivate facilities. \n \n \n \n55. \nThe third component will invest in improved health care systems and facilities at the LGU \nlevel,  enhancing  their  sustainability  and  effectiveness.  Project  resources  will  be  used  to \nimplement an agreed package of CPG-focused interventions in a sequenced manner, based on \na  business  plan  and  the  actual  performance  of  the  concerned  LGUs.  The  Project  will  support \nthe development of systems to administer ILHZs, establishing an efficient and effective referral \nnetwork of health facilities linking primary health care services with hospital services and public \nhealth programs. In return for project assistance, the LGUs will have to first ensure the coverage \nof  the  local  poor  under  PhilHealth.  Enrollment  of  people  in  the  non-formal  sector  will  be \nencouraged using a range of locally appropriate incentives, including group enrollment through \norganized groups. The existing means test will be reviewed to improve targeting of government \nsubsidies.  When  LGUs  meet  the  coverage  conditions,  project  funds  will  be  released  to \nrehabilitate  local  primary  and  secondary  health  care  facilities  to  conform  to  licensing  and \naccreditation requirements. The availability of affordable quality drugs is a major problem in the \nhealth sector, and the Project will integrate mechanisms for the procurement and management \nof drugs (logistics management, inventory control, and rational use of drugs) established under \nthe  health  sector  governance  and  regulatory  reform  components  in  every  ILHZ.  In  agreement \nwith the concerned LGUs, the Project has undertaken 13 case studies of ILHZ implementation \nin Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Nueva Vizcaya, Oriental Mindoro, and Romblon. ILHZ will involve both \npublic and private health sector providers.  \n \n\nLocal Health Sector Reform \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\nAs  the  Project  concentrates  on  the  needs  of  the  poor,  marginalized  and  vulnerable, \n56. \nspecific project activities will focus on building their capacity to help themselves, facilitate their \nrepresentation  in  local  health  boards,  and  increase  their  utilization  of  health  services  taking \nadvantage of PhilHealth coverage. Information campaigns specifically designed for the poor and \nmarginalized groups will be implemented, explaining PhilHealth benefits besides the traditional \nhealth information campaigns related to disease prevention and promotion of healthy life-style. \nThrough ILHZ outreach activities, community financing to cover health costs not reimbursed by \nPhilHealth (transport to hospital, outpatient drugs, etc), and group activities in support of health-\nrelated  activities  such  as  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  nutrition-related  improvements  will  be \nencouraged.  The  health  sector  governance  component  will  establish  a  community-focused \ndatabase, building on the Department of Interior Local Government initiative started in 2002, to \nimprove identification of poor and vulnerable groups. \n \n\n \n\nd.  \n\nHospital Reform \n\n \n57. \nThe objective of this component is to enhance sustainability and efficiency of hospitals \nby  restructuring  them  into  corporations  and  support  participation  of  the  private  and  nonprofit \nsector  integrated  into  CPGs.  ILHZ  and  coordination  mechanisms  have  been  developed,  and \nhospital  financial  autonomy  and  capacity  building  activities  will  be  undertaken  through  the \ngovernance reform component. Project funds will be used to rehabilitate local public hospitals, \nwith  the  objectives  to  (i)  provide  better  quality  services,  particularly  for  the  poor,  and  (ii) \nstimulate healthy competition between public and private health sector providers based on the \nquality of services offered. Civil works will mainly consist of rehabilitating and upgrading existing \nhealth  facilities.  In  some  cases,  hospitals  will  be  expanded  and  some  primary  health  care \nfacilities  will  be  built  in  poorly  served  remote  areas  (particularly  in  areas  with  indigenous \npeople). An initial environmental examination was performed for the civil works to be financed \nby the HSDP (Appendix 9). The Project will also finance the procurement of medical and office \nequipment,  and  vehicles.  Recurrent  costs  generated  by  these  investments  in  the  local  health \nsystem  will  be  compensated  by  efficiency  gains  and  resulting  cost  savings.  The  governance \ncomponent  will  assist  PhilHealth  to  design  benefit  packages  and  systems  to  reinforce  the \nobjectives of hospital reform. \n \n \n \n58. \nThis  component  will  provide  cost-efficient  systems  for  effective  public  health  programs \nintegrated  into  CPGs.  The  Project  will  support  in  particular  the  implementation  of  the  program \nagainst tuberculosis and the reproductive health. Program implementation and subsidies will be \nlinked  to  performance  in  the  ILHZs  and  project  LGUs.  For  tuberculosis,  the  Project  will \nstrengthen the World Health Organization-recommended DOTS.12 For reproductive health and \nfamily  planning,  the  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  a  core  package  of  services \ndeveloped  by  DOH  under  the  Second  Women\u2019s  Health  and  Safe  Motherhood  Project.  The \ngovernance  component  of  the  Project  will  provide  systems  design  and  support  for  effective \noperation  of  public  health  systems  at  LGU  and  provincial  levels,  and  for  related  PhilHealth \nsystems. \n \n\nPublic Health Reform \n\ne. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n12  Directly  Observed  Therapy  Strategy  (DOTS)  is  the  most  effective  strategy  available  today  for  controlling  the \ntuberculosis  epidemic.  DOTS  combines  five  elements:  political  commitment,  microscopy  services,  drug  supplies, \nsurveillance and monitoring systems, and use of highly efficacious regimes with direct observation of treatment. \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProject Cost Estimates \n\n \n59. \nThe  project  costs  amount  to  $23.3  million,  with  $14.1  million  accruing  to  national \norganizations  and  $3.6  million  for  LGUs.  The  remaining  $1.3  million  covers  contingencies, \ninterest,  and  other  charges.  Of  the  total,  $6.3  million  (27%)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$17.1  million  equivalent  (73%)  represents  the  local  currency  costs.

The  loan  will  have  a  26-year  term,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  6  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility,  and  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communiction  or  advice  from  ADB.  ADB  will  fund \n100% of the foreign exchange cost, totaling 28% of the estimated project cost, and 40% of the \nlocal  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $10.3  million  equivalent  as \ncounterpart  financing,  which  accounts  for  44%  of  the  total  costs.  This  includes  financing  civil \nworks,  in-country  training,  workshops,  materials  and  consumables,  project  management,  and \ntaxes  and  duties.  DOH  will  finance  consulting  and  sector  capacity-building  actitvity.  The  loan \nproceeds  will  be  utilized  over  6  years  fro  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  financing  plan  is \nsummarized in Table 2. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\nSource \n\nADB \nGovernment \n\nDepartment of Health \nLocal government units \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n 6.25 \n0.00 \n \n \n 6.25 \n\nLocal  \nCurrency \n6.75 \n10.33 \n8.88 \n1.45 \n17.08 \n\nTotal \nCost \n13.00 \n10.33 \n8.88 \n1.45 \n23.33 \n\nPercent \n\n56 \n44 \n \n \n100 \n\n      Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n61. \n$7.77  million  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  lent  to  LGUs  at  market  rates  in  accordance \nwith  the  Local  Government  Code  and  based  on  LGUs\u2019  fiscal  capacity.  Participating  LGUs  will \nshare the costs of the Project in terms of counterpart funds for civil works and equipment. The \nnominated  special  purpose  entity,  the  Municipal  Finance  Corporation  (MFC)  will  provide  the \nloan financing to LGUs from the loan proceeds to undertake required civil works and equipment \npurchases, MFC, a wholly Government-owned development finance institution, was established \nas the Municipal Development Finance Office of DOF in 1984, and has gained relevant capacity \nofr LGU financing by implementing a wide variety of World Bank and ADB projects. In 2004, the \nGovernment  corporatized  the  organization  creating  MFC.  It  is  scheduled  to  commence \ncorporate  operations  in  February  2005.  Its  mission  is  to  provide  medium-  and  long-term \nfinancing to Philippine LGUs. It is capitalized at P1 billion. The funds flow for the Project is set \nout in Appendix 11. \n\n \n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n62. \nDOH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  and  provide  overall  guidance  for \nproject  implementation.  The  DOH\u2019s  undersecretary  for  external  affairs  will  be  the  project \ndirector. The director of the Health Policy Development and Planning Bureau will be the overall \nproject  technical  coordinator.  The  Bureau  of  International  Health  Cooperation  through  the \nUnified Project Management Division (UPMD) will be responsible for the overall management of \nthe Project. The head of UPMD will be the overall project manager. A team of consultants will \nbe  recruited  to  assist  UPMD  as  the  unified  project  management  unit  (UPMU),  which  will  be \ndirectly responsible for project implementation. MFC will establish a project management unit to \nundertake assessment and maintenance of loans to LGUs. This unit will be supported by UPMU \nconsultants. The secretary of DOH will lead a steering committee providing overall guidance to \nthe  Project. Members  will  include  DOF,  MFC,  PhilHealth,  representatives  of  the  private  sector \n(nongovernment  organizations,  professional  associations,  private  health  care  providers),  and \nconsumer groups. The director of the Center for Health Development or DOH\u2019s regional health \noffice  will  be  the  regional  project  supervisor  and  will  designate  the  existing  regional  unified \nproject management team as the regional supervisory unit for the Project. The regional unified \nproject management team will (i) ensure coordination between UPMD at the national level and \nthe project province(s) in their jurisdiction; (ii) provide technical support when appropriate, and \n(iii) be responsible for monitoring, evaluation and auditing of project activities.  \n \n63. \nIn  the  project  provinces,  the  provincial  governor  will  be  the  project  director  and  the \nprovincial health officer the project coordinator. The provincial steering committee will comprise \nthe governor, project director, and chairs of the ILHZ boards. The provincial project coordinator \nwill assign one of his or her permanent staff as provincial project manager assisted by a team of \nconsultants and technical health experts, who will form the provincial PMU, which will be directly \nresponsible  for  implementation  of  project  activities  in  the  province.  The  provincial  project \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n \n\n6. \n\nProcurement \n\ndirector  will  facilitate  establishment  of  an  ILHZ.    Each  ILHZ  will  have  a  board  and  permanent \nsecretariat. The HSDP will be implemented over 6 years. Every year, each ILHZ will prepare an \noperational plan (comprising a plan of action, a program of activities, and a financial plan) that \nwill be submitted to the national UPMD for approval via the provincial project coordinator, with a \ncopy to the Health Policy Development and Planning Bureau via the regional health office. The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 12. \n \n \n \n64. \nThe  procurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement and following existing standard operating procedures established by \nUPMD.  ADB  and  Government  procedures  and  rules  in  calling  for  tenders,  whether  for \ninternational  or  local  competitive  bidding,  will  be  followed.  The  existing  bids  and  awards \ncommittee of DOH will handle bid evaluation and contract awards. Civil works will be awarded \nby  the  LGUs  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding.  Procurement  for  most  of  the  project \ngoods will be consolidated at the national UPMD level, with a limited number of procurements \ntaking place at the regional or provincial levels. Equipment (medical and non-medical), vehicles, \nand supplies will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding for contracts over \n$500,000, international shopping and local competitive bidding  for contracts between $100,000 \nand $500,000, or direct purchase. Civil works will be partially funded and contracted by the local \ngovernments.  For civil works, contracts of over $2 million will be procured through international \ncompetitive bidding; all other contracts will use local competitive bidding. Philippines experience \nhas  shown  that  local  companies  alone  will  bid  below  these  thresholds,  local  capacity  is \nadequate,  domestic  procurement  processes  are  satisfactory,  and  the  Government  has \nrequested local competitive bidding be used where appropriate. For certain types of specialized \nmedical equipment, international shopping may be appropriate as the number of suppliers in the \nfield is limited. Indicative procurement packages are set out in Appendix 13. \n \n\n7.  \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n65. \nDOH  will  recruit  a  team  of  management  consultants  consisting  of  experts  in  financing, \nprocurement, civil works, monitoring and evaluation, and good governance and a technical team \nto  provide  advisory  assistance  to  the  Project.  The  technical  advisory  group  of  consultants  will \ninclude experts in relevant health sector reform areas. Total input is estimated at 523 person-\nmonths of international and domestic consulting, comprising 86 person-months for international \nspecialists and 437 person-months for domestic specialists. The total cost of such services will \nbe  $7.25  million  with  staff  comprising  $2.44  million  and  the  remainder  comprising  training  in \nhealth care reform and clinical and managerial training for staff of DOH, the participating LGUs, \nand  the  health  facilities  involved.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  through  an  international \nconsulting  firm  following  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  or  through  individual  consultant \nselection  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  Consultant  Selection  or  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants (outline terms of reference are \nin Appendix 14). \n \n \n \n66. \nTo  expedite  disbursement  for  project  expenditures,  the  Government  will  establish  two \nimprest  accounts  for  eligible  expenditures  with  the  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas,  one  each  for \nDOH  and  MFC.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  managed,  liquidated,  and  replenished  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on Imprest Fund and Statement of Expenditures Procedures. \nThe  initial  amount  to  be  advanced  under  the  imprest  account  will  be  the  maximum  of  the \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n8. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n9. \n\nAuditing \n\nequivalent  of  $1  million  for  MFC  and  $500,000  for  DOH.  ADB's  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating  or  replenishing \nadvances  up  to  a  maximum  amount  of  $200,000  per  contract.  The  imprest  account  and \nstatement of expenditures records will be audited annually separately by auditors acceptable to \nADB. \n \n \n \nProject  expenditures  will  be  recorded  according  to  the  standard  requirements  of  the \n67. \nCommission on Audit. All agencies involved in project implementation will prepare and maintain \nseparate accounts for project-related disbursements. UPMD will consolidate the accounts from \nthe various national offices and provinces and submit them to the DOH Finance Service, which \nwill review the consolidated accounts and, after audit, submit them to DOF and ADB. The audit \nreport  will  include  a  statement  verifying  that  funds  disbursed  by  ADB  against  statements  of \nexpenditures have been used for the purpose for which they were provided. Project accounts, \ntogether  with  disbursement  documents,  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable to ADB, and will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. \nA  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedures \nshould be included in the annual audit report. \n \n \n \n68. \nQuarterly  progress  reports  will  be  prepared  by  every  provincial  project  management \nteam, duly signed and endorsed by the governor as the provincial project director. These teams \nwill be responsible for coordinating project activities and for preparing reports on their status and \noutcomes. The reports will be furnished simultaneously to UPMD and the DOH regional health \noffice  (regional  project  supervisor),  and  will  be  consolidated  at  the  national  level.  UPMD  will \nprepare its own report on the implementation of national activities funded by the Project. It will \nprepare  a  single  report  on  project  accomplishments  to  be  submitted  quarterly  to  the  project \ndirector and subsequently forwarded to ADB. \n \n\nReports \n\n10. \n\n \n11. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring System \n\n \n69. \nThe  project  performance  monitoring  system  will  contain  data  and  information  on  each \nhealth  sector  reform  area,  relevant  management  data  and  in  particular  detailed  financial  data \ndocumenting  Project  progress  and  adherence  to  principles  of  good  governance.  Achievement \nwill  be  checked  against  performance  targets  set  by  DOH  at  the  beginning  of  each  year.  The \nperformance  parameters  will  include  (i)  activities  and  outputs  realized  vis-\u00e0-vis  plans  and \ntargets,  (ii)  independently  verified  physical  accomplishments,  and  (iii)  actual  costs  against \nbudgeted amounts.  \n \nSpecific  monitoring  forms13  will  be  developed  and  used  to  monitor  progress  and \n70. \naccomplishments.  The  monitoring  system  will  be  designed  to  enable  prompt  remedial  action. \nEvaluation  of  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  primarily  through  a  set  of  baseline  and  end-of-\nProject  surveys.  While  a  poverty  survey  has  been  undertaken  during  project  preparation,  a \ngeneral  population-based  survey  is  needed  on  the  current  status  and  outcome  of  the  HSRA \ninitiatives in all five provinces to validate the indicative levels of outcome and impact indicators \nreflected  in  the  HSDP  framework.  Available  data  in  existing  DOH  and  provincial  reports  are \n\n                                                 \n13 Under the leadership of DOH, donors and financing institutions are expected to agree on common formats of \nreports and monitoring forms for all externally funded projects that are supporting implementation of HSRA. \n\n \n\n\f22\n\n \n\n \n\n12. \n\nProject Review \n\ninsufficient to establish detailed objectives and targets for project activities in the next 5 years. A \nsurvey at the end of the Project will evaluate the impact of the HSDP on the overall health status \nin the five provinces at the time. UPMD will contract nongovernment organizations to undertake \nthe baseline and end-of-project evaluation surveys.  \n \n \n \n71. \nA  Project  Inception  Mission  comprising  ADB  and  DOH  staff  will  be  fielded  shortly  after \nthe  project  loan  becomes  effective.  Yearly  project  review  missions  will  (i)  monitor  progress  of \nproject  implementation;  (ii)  identify  areas  of  concern;  and  (iii)  suggest  remedial  actions.  A \ncomprehensive  midterm  review  of  project  performance  will  be  conducted  to  identify  problems \nand constraints encountered during the first half of the Project and to adjust the design and the \nproject framework or take remedial actions as required. Technical or budgetary changes of the \nProject based on the results of the project performance  monitoring system  will be considered, \nas will additional activities, or expansion of activities and sites for the remaining project period. \n \n \n \n72. \nThe  Project  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  and  guidelines.  DOH  and  the \nimplementing  agency  will  ensure  timely  submission  of  project  accounts.  Subprojects  will  be \nselected,  components  approved,  and  goods  and  services  procured  according  to  the  agreed \nguidelines  and  criteria.  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  the  national  and  the \npreselected \nlocal  governments,  DOH,  and  PhilHealth  during  project  processing.  The \nanticorruption  provisions  added  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  were  also \ndiscussed, and the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement were \nemphasized. A strict project performance monitoring system will allow DOH and ADB to confirm \nthe appropriate use of project funds. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n13. \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  HSDP  will  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  the  health  status  of  the  population, \n73. \nparticularly  the  poor  and  other  marginalized  and  vulnerable  population  groups,  through \nimplementation of a package of reforms that will improve quality of health services, and facilitate \ntheir  availability  to  the  poor.  Improving  the  health  status  of  the  population  will  impact  on  their \nhuman capital and thus on their productive capacities. For women, in particular, improved health \nstatus and reduced fertility through enhanced family planning and reproductive health services \nare anticipated to improve individual productivity. The HSDP will facilitate the empowerment of \npoor,  marginalized,  and  vulnerable  groups  by  supporting  their  participation  on  local  health \nboards.  \n \n74. \nThe  Project  directly  targets  approximately  175,000  poor  and  subsistence  poor \nhouseholds, or close to a million people, in the five preselected project provinces: Ifugao, Ilocos \nNorte, Nueva Vizcaya, Oriental Mindoro, and Romblon (in 2000, the five project provinces had a \ntotal  population  of  approximately  2.1  million  people,  or  400,000  households).  These \nbeneficiaries are composed of poor families, and vulnerable, and marginalized groups such as \nwomen of reproductive age (15-49 years of age), households headed by women, children under \n5,  and  indigenous  people.  Of  the  total  number  of  project  beneficiaries,  more  than  half  of  the \nfemale beneficiaries will be women of childbearing age (15-49), and 13% will be children under \n5.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  at  least  (i)  95%  of  children  in  the  project  areas  are  fully \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\nSocial and Poverty Analysis \n\nimmunized; (ii) the contraceptive prevalence increase by 15%; (iii) 90% of the poor are enrolled \nin the National Center for Health Promotion, either as indigent, sponsored, or individually paying \nmembers; (iv) 80% of births are delivered in a certified or accredited health facility and attended \nby a trained health care professional; (v) 70% of the poor and indigenous population are located \nwithin 5 km or 1 hour from a primary health care service provider; and (vi) 50% of the poor are \nusing  primary  health  care  facilities  (BHSs  and  RHUs)  or  hospital  out-patient  departments  for \ntreatment or preventive services. \n \nB. \n \n75. \nThe  primary  source  of  income  in  the  five  provinces  is  farming  followed  by  wage \nemployment  in  the  formal  and  informal  sectors.  Other  sources  of  income    include  rents,  and \nremittances (from  family  members  who  are  working  abroad  or  domestically).  Poor  households \nspend almost 50% of their income on food items. Because of their meager incomes, investing in \nhealth  is  simply  not  a  priority  for  poor  households.  Improved  access  to  quality  and  affordable \nhealth  services  is  identified  as  a  high  priority  among  the  poor  in  the  provinces.  Distance,  bad \nroads, and inadequate transportation hamper access to health facilities, services, and providers.   \n  \n76. \nTo  maximize  the  benefits  for  the  poor,  the  Project  will  (i)  construct  approximately  160 \nBHSs,  and  upgrade  and  expand  RHUs  and  BHSs;  (ii)  establish  an  effective  mechanism  for \nidentifying  and  prioritizing  the  poor,  and  determine  their  unmet  needs  for  essential  health \nservices;  (iii)  strengthen  or  help  organizations/associations  of  the  poor  so  that  they  can  be \nappropriately  represented  in  at  least  70%  of  local  health  boards  at  project  sites;  (iv)  train  and \norganize barangay health workers and family health volunteers to promote healthy lifestyles and \ndisseminate  information  on  essential  health  services  that  are  made  available  at  BHSs  and \nRHUs in barangays with a majority of poor and indigenous people; (v) provide health insurance \ncoverage for at least 90% of the poor and indigenous households in the areas covered by the \nProject,  and  facilitate  provision  of  social  health  insurance  coverage  to  at  least  90%  of  poor \npeople; (vi) provides technical and financial support for community-based health programs and \nprojects  targeting  poor  and  other  marginalized  groups  in  particular;  and  (vii)  upgrade  the \ncapacity of frontline health workers. \n \nOne of the main objectives of the HSDP is to make quality health care accessible and \n77. \naffordable for the poor and to meet the health needs of women in particular. A gender analysis \nwas conducted during HSDP preparation. Main aspects constraining women\u2019s access to health \nservice facilities are (i) lack of privacy in health facilities and inappropriate scheduling of health \nservice  provision,  (ii)  lack  of  mobility  and  efficient  transport,  and  (iii)  lack  of  female  health \nprofessionals. The gender analysis stresses that because of the constraints for women\u2019s access \nto health service facilities and their economic situation, women will benefit particularly from the \nupgrading and/or expansion of BHSs and RHUs into birthing and lying-in clinics in areas where \nthe  core  referral  hospitals  are  more  than  1.5  hours  away.  Aside  from  the  existing  health \nprograms being implemented by the BHSs and RHUs, core health packages for these facilities \nwill include enhanced services for family planning and reproductive health counseling. Women \nwill  also  be \ninformation,  education  and \ncommunication  campaigns.  They  will  be  actively  involved  in  setting  up  the  community-based \ninformation system for identifying and prioritizing the needs of poor women for essential health \nservices and social health insurances. Women will also be selected for skills upgrading in health \ncare  since  the  majority  of  health  caregivers  in  the  communities  are  women.  Finally,  groups  of \npoor  women  will  receive  limited  financial  assistance  in  the  form  of  seed  money  to  set  up \ncommunity-based projects for health. \n   \n\nthe  major  participants  and  beneficiaries  of \n\n \n\n\f24\n\n \n\n \n\nEnvironment \n\nTo  ensure  that  the  gender  aspects  are  mainstreamed  in  the  Project,  a  poverty  and \n78. \ngender specialist will be included in the technical team of consultants. This specialist will (i) work \nwith DOH and other relevant stakeholders to design a community-based information system that \nintegrates  gender  and  poverty  issues  in  coordination  with  the  community-based  information \nsystem specialists; and (ii) develop a gender and development plan, monitoring and evaluation \nindicators; and specific gender and development reporting requirements. While not expected to \nhave  significant  resettlement  impacts,  implementation  of  the  Project  may  involve  limited \nresettlement and involvement with indigenous peoples. Participatory strategies for dealing with \nthese  issues  have  been  developed.  The  summary  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment, \nincluding  gender,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  is  in  Appendix  15,  the  summary \nresettlement framework is in Appendix 16, and a summary indigenous peoples framework is in \nAppendix 17. \n \nC. \n \n79. \nThe  HSDP  will  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  health  facilities  in  the  project  area,  such  as \nhospitals, health centers, sub-health centers, and village health posts. An initial environmental \nexamination  for  project activities  was  completed  during  project  preparation  (the  summary  is  in \nAppendix  9).  The  assessment  and  evaluation  of  the  interventions  showed  that  none  would \nrequire  the  preparation  of  an  environmental  impact  assessment.  No  interventions/activities \nproposed  can  be  considered  environmentally  critical  or  are  projected  to  create  significant \nadverse  or  negative  impacts  on  the  environment.  Although  proposed  activities/interventions, \nspecifically  the  upgrading  of  existing  health  facilities,  may  be  significant  in  degree,  albeit \ntemporary  in  nature,  these  impacts  are  avoidable,  localized  in  scope,  and  mitigable  through \nproper planning and the employment of appropriate construction methodologies. Positive socio-\neconomic impacts are predicted to occur as a result of the implementation of the activities and \ninterventions.  Hospital  waste  management  will  become  part  of  the  capacity-building  program \nleading to improvements in the environmental management of health facilities. All building and \ncivil works will be designed to minimize damage to the environment.  \n \nD. \n \n The  HSDP  finances  crucial  structural  changes  in  the  sector,  which  have  previously \n80. \nfrustrated HSRA implementation, specifically through (i) more efficient health spending; (ii) pro-\npoor restructuring of health budgets; (iii) rationalization of local health, public health and hospital \nsystems; and (iv) improvement of regulation, organization, and governance of the health sector.  \nOverall,  the  implementation  of  policy  measures  will  result  in  additional  costs  totaling  $280 \nmillion. In annual terms, the net impact is equivalent to nearly $100 million per year (a figure to \nbe  compared  with  the  2001  recurrent  health  budget  of  about  $702  million).  The  HSDP  is \nassumed  to  increase  the  proportion  of  the  population  with  access  to  quality  health  care, \nparticularly  among  the  poor  and  marginalized.  Improvement  of  the  referral  system  and \norganizational reform of the management system toward integrated care, from the first point of \ncontact to the referral hospital, should have a beneficial effect on the overall system\u2019s efficiency \nat the provincial level. The sustainability of funds for sector reform has been considered and, in \naddition  to  the  assurances  in  the  policy  letter,  the  contribution  of  the  Government  has  been \nstructured to have no budget impact in the first 2 years and to increase with projected growth \nthereafter. In addition, the Project is structured to be affordable and revenue generating for the \nLGUs, thus providing an incentive for replication and a means of enhancing the sustainability of \nhealth care provision. The HSDP is expected to yield an economic rate of return of about 28% \n(Appendix 18). Considerable social return on investment is anticipated through: (i) resource cost \nsavings, and (ii) productivity benefits from a population in better health.  \n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n81. \nFinancial  analysis  was  also  conducted  on  the  nominated  special  purpose  entity,  MFC. \nMFC is scheduled to commence corporate operations in February 2005 with capital of P1 billion. \nTo  ensure  the  financial  viability  of  the  MFC  loan  and  sound  financial  management,  MFC  will \nmaintain  a  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  at  least  10%\u2014in  keeping  with  the  requirement  of  the \nBangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  for  similar  institutions\u2014and  provide  solid  provisioning  for  asset \nquality. The financial projections for MFC are in Appendix 18. \n \nE. \n \n\nRisks and Assumptions  \n\n1. \n\nPolitical Risks \n\nThe governance of organizations involved in the health sector is weak and constitutes a \n82. \nrisk at the policy and management levels; both are subject to political interference. The HSDP \nwill therefore provide consultants to upgrade systems and train staff, and change organizational \nand managerial cultures through training, improved coordination, and involvement of the public \nin monitoring progress. \n \n83. \nPolitical commitment by all parties is fundamental to progress toward the MDGs and to \nsuccessful  implementation  of  a  new  vision  for  health;  and  requires  the  finance,  economic \nplanning,  and  health  departments  to  collaborate  at  all  levels  to  create  an  environment  of \nsustained attention to the challenges linking macro-economy and health. A pre-requisite to risk \nminimization is anticipation and open discussion of the problems and the taking of actions that \ndirectly address them. In addition, the project loan provides appropriate incentives in the form of \nstaff  and  investment  resources  to  the  involved  organizations  to  support  them  in  HSRA \nimplementation. \n \n\n2. \n\nMacroeconomic and Financial Risks \n\n \n\n \n\n84.  \nThe economic and financial risks are considered less prominent as the HSDP does not \nintend  to  substantially  increase  health  care  spending.  The  lack  of  a  viable  credit  market  for \nfinancing the investment needs of the aggregate LGUs has inhibited infrastructure investment, \nwhich has affected the construction or rehabilitation of hospitals and other health infrastructure.  \nFor  much  of  the  health  sector  expenditures,  LGUs  will  undertake  cost  savings  and  quality \nimprovements  financed  through  efficiency  gains  and  new  operations\u2019  modalities  that  allow \nsharing of facilities and services and economies of scale at the local level. Without the HSDP, \nthe  likely  success  of  such  pathways  could  not  be  demonstrated  and  poverty  reduction  and \nachievement of MDGs would remain a distant objective. \n \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Constraints \n\n \n85. \nThe capacity of organizations involved in the health sector is weak and constitutes a risk \nin  three  dimensions.  Skills  are  limited  and  are  constantly  being  eroded  through  emigration. \nFurther, inappropriate organizational and professional cultures also constrain reform. The HSDP \nwill therefore provide consultants to upgrade systems and train staff, and address organizational \nand professional cultures in various ways\u2014both directly and indirectly\u2014through training, better \ncoordination,  and  increased  public  accountability.  Although  the  beginning  of  devolution  in  the \nPhilippines  dates  back  to  1991  and  the  HSRA  was  published  in  1999,  the  HSDP  is  the  first \nintervention  that  aims  at  full  implementation  of  the  reform  agenda  in  all  its  complexity.  The \ndevolved  functions  of  several  components  of  the  HSRA  need  to  be  operationalized  and  DOH \n\n \n\n\f26\n\n \n\n \n\nand  UPMD  should  provide  full  support  in  the  context  of  the  project  loan  to  mitigate  the  risks \nassociated with the limited capacities of many LGUs. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances  \n\n \nA. \n \n86. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nThe  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  HSDP  Loan \nAgreement, as described in the development policy letter, will continue in effect \nfor  the  duration  of  the  HSDP  loan  period,  and  the  Government  will  promptly \nadopt  the  other  policies  and  take  the  other  actions  included  in  the  HSDP,  as \nspecified  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  HSDP  Loan  Agreement,  and \nensure  that  such  policies  and  actions  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the \nHSDP loan period. \n\nThe Government will seek prior approval of ADB to any change of UPMD Project \nManager and of Provincial Project Coordinators, and will ensure that UPMD and \nprovincial PMU staff will be transferred no more than once in 2 years. \n\nin  accordance  with \nfor \n\nThe Government will ensure that (i) an environmental assessment is carried out \nfor each Subproject in a participatory manner as part of the planning process of \nthe  Environmental  Assessment \nthe  Subprojects  and \nthe  Project;  (ii)  based  on  such  environmental \nFramework  prepared \nassessments,  an  environmental  management  plan, \nincluding  mitigation \nmeasures,  institutional  arrangements,  monitoring  plan  and  sufficient  budget  for \nits implementation, is developed by the LGUs and approved by the UPMD; (iii) an \nenvironmental  impact  assessment,  where  necessary,  is  undertaken  for  each \nSubproject  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  concurrence  prior  to  Subproject  approval; \n(iv)  adequate  environmental  mitigation  measures  are  incorporated  into  all \nSubproject  design,  construction,  operation,  maintenance  and  monitoring \narrangements \nlaws, \nregulations,  and  standards,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  and  (v) \nthe  subproject \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans \nmanagement  plans  are  implemented  effectively  and  in  a  timely  manner \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n\nthe  Borrower\u2019s  environmental \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nrequired \n\nin \n\nIn the event that land acquisition and/or involuntary resettlement are required for \nany  subproject,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  such  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary  resettlement  are  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  Borrower\u2019s \napplicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995) \nand the Project\u2019s Resettlement Framework  as agreed between the Borrower and \nADB, and disclosed to public in accordance with the relevant procedures of ADB; \n(b)  where  necessary,  resettlement  plans  acceptable  to  ADB  are  prepared,  with \nappropriate participation of and disclosure to the affected people, and submitted \nfor  ADB\u2019s  approval;  (c)  measures  indicated  in  such  resettlement  plans  are  duly \ncarried  out  prior  to  award  of  the  respective  civil  works  contract;  and  (d)  all \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27\n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\ncompensation payments and resettlement assistance are provided to the affected \npeople prior to displacement and/or dispossession. \n\nThe Government will ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998) and take all necessary actions \nto encourage women living in the Project provinces to participate in planning and \nimplementation  of  the  subprojects.

The  Philippines  has  a  gross  national  product \nper  capita  50%  higher  than  Indonesia,  but  has  lower  nutrition,  immunization,  and  safe  water \nstatistics (Table A2.1). Other health variables, such as child mortality, tuberculosis prevalence, \nand  maternal  mortality  rates  also  lag  if  adjusted  for  the  relative  income  levels.  Quality  of  care \nespecially for the rural poor has been declining in the Philippines, due to overcrowding of higher \nlevel public hospitals, reduced recurrent expenditures and a shift of public resources in favor of \nlarger  institutions  and  tertiary  care  facilities  and  increasing  levels  of  private  practice  by  public \nservice doctors. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Comparative Health Statistics  \n>5 Mortality \nrate \n\nTuberculosis \nprevalence \n\n1-year olds \nimmunized \nvs Measles\n\nRural Pop \nwith safe \nwater \n\nPoverty \u2013 \nrural (%) \n\nGNP per \nCapita ($) \n\nMaternal \nmortality \nrate \n\n \n \n \nCountry \nPhilippines \nIndonesia \nMalaysia \nThailand \nViet Nam \nSingapore \nGNP = gross national product, Pop. = population. \nSource: World Bank. 2000.

However, \nprimary  health  services  for  the  poor  are  understaffed  and  underfunded;  lack  drugs,  medical \nequipment, and supplies; and provide poor quality care. Patients are bypassing these facilities \nand  using  the  outpatient  facilities  at  provincial  and  teaching  hospitals  for  minor  ailments.  This \nleads  to  both  operational  and  allocative  inefficiency  in  the  use  of  health  care  resources. \nOvercrowding at provincial and teaching hospitals also prevents the provision of quality services \nfor patients who need higher level care. Improved management, reorganization, and additional \nfinancial resources are needed to improve quality of care at the primary health care level and to \nimprove  access  to  quality  health  services  by  the  poor.  These  issues  point  to  the  need  for \nstructural change and health sector reforms. \n \nB. \n \nFaced  with  budgetary  constraints  on  one  hand  and  the  need  to  improve  the  quality  of \n4. \nhealth  care  for  the  poor,  on  the  other,  the  Government  developed  the  Health  Sector  Reform \nAgenda (HSRA) to implement alternative means of managing service delivery and financing. A \nnumber  of  health  sector  management  strategies  have  been  developed  and  implemented \nthroughout the world to improve health services. The public sector can be made more efficient \nthrough  decentralizing,  and  providing  management  autonomy  for  hospitals,  and  by  providing \nappropriate incentives for staff at different levels. Additional gains in efficiency can be achieved \n\nHealth Sector Reforms \n\n \n\n\f34\n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nby  contracting  out  specific  tasks  to  the  private  sector  and  nongovernment  organizations. \nHowever,  implementation  of  any  of  these  options  results  in  additional  administrative  costs  for \ntracking money and ensuring service quality. \n \nThe comparative advantage of any specific strategy for a public health system can only \n5. \nbe  determined  by  conducting  cost-effectiveness  analyses  based  on  appropriate  incentives  for \nthe  various  providers  (see  Table  A2.2).  Some  options  will  require  field-testing  or  operations \nresearch to determine their effectiveness and total costs. Only after that can they be expanded \nor  replicated  in  larger  areas.  The  degree  of  success  in  implementing  health  partnerships  will \ndepend  on  effective  decentralization  and  the  active  participation  of  local  government  and \ncommunities. \n\n \nFinancing of \nServices \nPublic \n\nPrivate \n\n \nTable A2.2: Incentives for Health Providers \n\nProvision of Services \n\nPublic \n\nPrivate \n\nDecentralization \nAutonomous hospitals \nIncentives in public facilities \nUser charges \n \nPrivate practice in public \nfacilities \nCommunity financing \n \n\nServices contracted to private \nprovider \n\nInstitutional provider funded by: \n\n\u2022  Private insurance \n\u2022  Pre-paid care \n\nIndividual providers \nPrivatization of health facilities \nand services \n\n    Source: ADB Studies. \n \n6. \nThe  HSRA  aims  to  provide  these  incentives  and  is  the  collective  responsibility  of  the \nHealth  Policy  Development  and  Planning  Bureau,  Bureau  of  Local  Health  and  Development, \nNational  Center  for  Disease  Prevention  and  Control,  National  Center  for  Health  Facility  and \nDevelopment, Bureau of Food and Drug, Bureau of Health Devices and Technology, the Bureau \nof  Health  Facilities  and  Services,  and  National  Center  for  Health  Promotion.  The  Philippines \nHealth  Insurance  Corporation  (PhilHealth)  has  been  given  the  responsibility  for  leadership  in \nhealth financing reform. The 17 regional health offices are the arms of Department of Health at \nthe  local  level  to  propel  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  health  sector  reform  initiatives  by \nlocal government units. \n \nThe HSRA is a plan to exercise, in a coherent and well-orchestrated manner, the policy \n7. \ninstruments of financing, regulation, information, and direct service delivery as mandated by the \nhealth reform enabling laws:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPublic  hospitals  must  become  effective  instruments  not  only  for  inpatient  care, \nbut  also  for  ensuring  that  subsidies  are  equitably  dispensed  through  socialized \nfees.  Moreover,  public  hospitals  must  be  competitive  and  therefore  influence \nservices and prices in the private sector. \nTechnical  leadership  in  public  health  programs  (information,  research,  and \ntechnical  guidelines)  must  become  an  effective  instrument  in  influencing  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2\n\n35\n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\neffectiveness  of  service  delivery  in  the  field  that  was  devolved  and  shared  with \nprivate providers.  \nMulti-year  budgets  must  be  provided  to  ensure  that  priority  public  health \ncampaigns are sustained long enough to meet targets and demonstrate impact. \nLocal  health  systems,  where  local  government  units  jointly  govern  and  share \nresponsibilities for a health catchment area must be recognized as the frontline in \nservice delivery and sustained financing. \nThe  capacity  of  health  regulatory  agencies  must  be  upgraded  to  effectively \nperform their traditional functions, as well as new roles in public information and \ncompetition promotion. \nThe  National  Health  Insurance  Program  (NHIP)  must  expand  enrollment  and \nimprove  benefits  to  reduce  the  financing  burden,  and  leverage  effective  and \naffordable services from both public and private providers. \n\n \n9. \nThe  reform  areas  are  highly  interdependent  and  complementary,  and  therefore  should \nbe  implemented  as  a  package.  Health  financing  reforms  through  NHIP  expansion  will  make \nhospital  autonomy  viable  and  will  ensure  that  the  poor  remain  protected.  Hospital  reforms,  in \nturn,  will  free  up  resources  for  investments  in  public  health  programs,  health  systems \ndevelopment,  and  health  regulations  at  national  and  local  levels.  Effective  public  health \nprograms  and  local  health  systems  will  relieve  the  NHIP  from  paying  for  hospitalizations  that \nshould have otherwise been prevented or better handled at primary care facilities, and effective \nregulation will ensure that health facilities, equipment, and products meet quality standards and \nare competitively priced so that national and local health budgets and NHIP benefits get good \nvalue for money. \n\n \n\n\f36\n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nLESSONS LEARNED \n\n \n1. \nIn general terms, the Philippines provides a clear example of the need to address core \nprimary  health  care  (particularly  communicable  disease  and  reproductive  health),  targeting, \ncompetition, coordination, and sustainable financing (Table A3).   \n \n2. \nPrimary Health Care Delivery. A key issue is whether performance can be improved for \nthe  poor  by  increasing  their  voice  in  decision-making.  This  can  be  accomplished  in  several \nways.  The  first  is  the  direct  management  of  local  clinical  services,  through  community  health \ncenters or revolving drug funds, as in the Bamako Initiative. A second is mobilizing communities \nfor  health-promotion  activities,  from  malaria  prevention  to  improved  water  supply.  A  third  is \nparticipating  in  monitoring  the  performance  of  facilities  and  providers.  Another  issue  is  how  to \nimprove  accessibility.  Physical  proximity  to  poor  clients  can  be  improved  through  investment \ndecisions. But opportunities also exist for consolidation because of improved infrastructure; this \nshould  be  pursued  to  improve  quality  and  productivity.  Accessibility  can  be  improved  at  lower \ncost  not  by  duplicating  available  services  in  the  private  and  charitable  sector,  but  by  allowing \nclients  more  choice  of  service  delivery  outlets  through  contracts  with  nongovernment \norganizations and private providers, and by improving technical efficiency and incentives among \npublic service providers. Moreover, nongovernment organizations may have greater experience \nin dealing with certain at-risk groups, such as people with disabilities or youth at risk of sexually \ntransmitted diseases, than the Government. Health care facilities, which have shown to be both \ncostly  and  inefficient  at  treating  their  intended  beneficiaries,  such  as  residential  institutions  for \nthe  mentally  ill  or  physically  disabled,  should  be  reconsidered  in  favor  of  lower-cost,  higher-\nimpact services, such as day-care facilities. \n \n3. \nMore  Equitable  Government  Spending.  At  the  macro  level,  the  key  issue  for  the \nPhilippines  is  how  facilities  and  insurance  funds  are  accessed  by  the  poor.  Many  developing \nand middle-income countries have developed core packages, which define health interventions \navailable  at  the  village  (health  post),  community  (health  center),  and  district  levels  (district \nhospital).  Effective  packages  respond  in  a  cost-effective  way  to  the  needs  of  the  poorest \nsegments  of  the  population,  and  represent  priority  activities  for  public  financing.  They  should \ninclude services that respond to the burden of disease afflicting the poor and should be linked to \npoverty maps to facilitate geographic targeting. Virtually all of the interventions are community \nand  clinic-based,  but  they  also  require  supporting  infrastructure  of  population-based  services, \ncommunication and knowledge dissemination, school health, and environmental health. \n \nCompetition and Input Markets. Governments have a major role to play in the two key \n4. \nmarkets that support and feed into the health system \u2013 the pharmaceutical and labor markets. \nThe availability of drugs affects the clinical quality of health services, costs, and perceptions of \nclients. Purchasing pharmaceuticals in the private market is also one of the main out-of-pocket \nexpenditure  items  for  the  poor.  Key  aspects  to  be  assessed  include  selection,  procurement, \ndistribution, pricing, and quality. Instruments for improving pharmaceuticals transactions market \nwide  include  (i)  communications  campaigns  to  improve  the  understanding  of  drugs  among \nclients and sellers, (ii) social marketing to improve the quality and availability of drugs and family \nplanning  supplies,  and  (iii)  impartial  enforcement  of  regulations  to  protect  consumers.  By \nmaintaining  and  disseminating  essential  drugs  lists  and  pursuing  policies  to  encourage  use  of \nlow-cost,  high-quality  generic  drugs,  governments  can  improve  the  functioning  of  the \npharmaceutical system. Procurement in the public sector can be improved through an essential \nlists  of  drugs,  supplies,  and  equipment;  use  of  competitive  bidding;  and  encouragement  of \ncompetition  in  logistics  and  distribution  systems.  The  labor  market  too  is  a  key  issue.  The \nquality,  distribution,  and  responsiveness  of  health  personnel  influence  the  availability,  quality, \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n  37\n\nand  access  to  interventions  by  the  poor.  Issues  to  examine  include  (i)  the  total  number  and \ndistribution of various types of providers, by geographic location and level of care; (ii) retention \ncapacity of the system for trained staff; (iii) quality of education and technical skills, as well as \nresponsiveness to the client; and (iv) underlying incentives for provider performance, particularly \nin relation to poor clients.  \n \n5. \nGovernance  Issues  in  Health  Provision.  A  core  responsibility  of  government  in  a \nmixed  system  is  to  exercise  effective  oversight.  Governance  becomes  more  important  as \ngovernments shift from direct service provision to a role dominated by policy; population-based \nhealth interventions; financing; regulation of providers and insurers; and guiding the system and \nbehavior through research, provision of information, quality enhancement activities, and careful \nuse  of  financial  subsidies.  Four  areas  are  key:  regulation,  coordination,  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and information. \n \n6. \nFinancing Sustainability. The issue here is whether the level of resources available to \nthe sector is sufficient to ensure the provision of essential services to the poor. Have resources \nbeen made available to sustain the chosen package of interventions? If not, have priorities been \nimposed  to  shrink  the  package  to  fit  within  the  constraints?  Sustainability  does  not  mean \nunlimited access to funds, but rather that hard decisions are made so that a functioning system \ncan  deliver  the  highest  priority  services  over  time.  The  Philippines  will  need  to  address  this \nissue  in  the  context  of  its  policy  to  ensure  broad  insurance  coverage.  A  key  issue  is  whether \nprepayment and insurance methods, when combined with public subsidies, succeed in creating \nan insured pool of poor and non-poor individuals, thereby offsetting the higher health risks of the \npoor  by  the  lower  risks  of  the  better  off.  Typically,  incentives,  subsidies,  and  compulsion  are \nrequired to achieve this goal.  \n \n7.  \nProject  Experience.  The  principal  lesson  learned  from  recent  projects  in  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank's  (ADB)  health  portfolio  in  the  Philippines  is  that  that  implementation \ncapacity  is  crucial,  especially  for  the  performance  of  Local  Government  Units  (LGUs).  ADB \nexperience, in common with the World Bank,1 is that the following are necessary: \n \n\n(i) \n\nRecognize  that,  under  devolution,  the  LGU  plays  the  major  role  in  health  care \ndelivery  and  DOH  can  act  only  in  conjunction  with  the  LGUs;  as  a  corollary, \ninvolve  LGUs  as  active  partners  in  project  preparation,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring. \nEstablish a professional project management office in the Department of Health \nwhile involving technical services in all aspects of project implementation. \n(iii)  Resolve  fundamental  cross-cutting  management  problems  upfront  (e.g.,  weak \nfinancial management, procurement, and human resource management). \n(iv)  Have a detailed plan for monitoring and evaluation ready at appraisal and use it \n\n(ii) \n\nin management and supervision. \nIntroduce  the  complete  package  of  project  inputs  for  a  given  project  area  in  a \nsynchronized manner to ensure quality production of the project deliverables. In \nparticular,  ensure  that  soft  inputs  like  training  and  advocacy/communication  do \nnot take a back seat to civil works and equipment. \nPlan and implement financing arrangements at the outset. \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n                                                 \n1 World Bank. 2004.

The  following  initiatives  are  of  particular \nrelevance for the Health Sector Development Program. \n \n2. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  Integrated  Community  Health  Services  Project \naimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care delivery system through a \nhealth  system  development  approach.  The  project  was  implemented  in  six  provinces  from \n1997\u20132003.  The  Women\u2019s  Health  and  Safe  Motherhood  Project  cofinanced  by  several \ndevelopment  agencies  has  four  components:  service  delivery,  institutional  strengthening, \ncommunity partnership, and policy and operations research. The Early Childhood Development \nProject is providing comprehensive assistance through the adoption of an integrated approach \nto  child  development  up  to  6  years  of  age.  It  is  being  implemented  in  three  regions  with  co-\nfunding from the World Bank.  \n\n \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development.  The  Health  Sector  Reform \n3. \nTechnical  Assistance  Project  is  directed  at  introducing  health  sector  reforms  in  the  advanced \nconvergence  sites.  The  Decentralized  Drug  Management  System  Project  supported  the \nassessment  of  the  drug  supply  situation  in  the  country,  and  resulted  in  the  development  of  a \nprocess  whereby  centralized  bidding  takes  place  for  an  annual  national  supply.  Other  recent \nprojects have concerned assistance to local government units (LGUs) for hospital management, \nand social health insurance with emphasis on outpatient services.  \n\n \nGerman  Government  Assistance.  Both  technical  and  financial  support  are  being \n4. \nprovided. The four components are currently being implemented in several parts of the country, \nand concern pharmaceuticals, local health systems development, social health insurance, and \nfamily planning and reproductive health. \n\n \n5. \nThe World Bank. Assistance to the Department of Health (DOH) includes preparation of \nproject  proposals  for  two  large  projects.  The  Health  Sector  Reform  Project  is  intended  to \nstrengthen  HSRA  implementation  in  four  convergence  provinces.  The  Women\u2019s  Health  and \nSafe  Motherhood  Project-II  supports  the  objectives  of  Women\u2019s  Health  and  Safe  Motherhood \nProject and links them to the broader health sector reform process in selected sites.  \n\n \n6. \nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency. DOH is receiving assistance in support \nof  HSRA  implementation  through  four  projects  that  concern  upgrading  of  facilities  and \nequipment,  tuberculosis  control,  family  planning  and  maternal  and  child  health,  and  the \nprevention and control of sexually transmitted diseases. \n \nSupplementary  Appendix  B  sets  out  more  details  of  external  assistance  to  the  sector. \n7. \nDetailed discussions have been held on coordination with all funding agencies, resulting in an \nagreement  to  harmonize  individual  project  approaches  as  much  as  possible  while  maintaining \nthe medium-term objective to implement a sector approach under the leadership of DOH. The \nEuropean  Union  has  expressed  its  intention  to  work  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  on \nextending activities of the HSDP with grant funds after finalizing its project formulation mission \nat the end of 2004.

DOH  allocates  the \nbulk  of  its  expenditures  to  personal  care  services,  and  the  local  governments\u2019  collective \nresources  are  spent  on  public  care  services.  In  terms  of  level  of  care,  DOH  spending  goes \nprimarily to tertiary care (personal care), while that of the Local Government Units (LGUs) goes \nto primary and secondary care (public health). In terms of functions, DOH allocates roughly the \nsame  budget  shares  to  personal  services  and  maintenance,  operating,  and  other  expenses \n(MOOE).  In  contrast,  the  bulk  of  LGU  spending  goes  to  personal  services:  resources  are \ninsufficient for drugs, medicines, supplies, and facility improvements.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \n(Table A7.2). \n \n4. \nWith the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP), efficiency of health spending will \nbe  improved  through  three  main  mechanisms.  Fewer  staff  will  be  necessary  to  operate  the \nsystem as a result of revised norms (staff size; doctors and nurses to patient ratios, number of \ndays per stay). Per person expenditure on health operating costs is expected to decrease as a \nresult  of  increased  utilization  of  lower  level  facilities,  and  purchaser  systems  reform  in  social \ninsurance.  The  HSDP  will  encourage  a  pro-poor  restructuring  of  health  budgets.  Health \nspending  will  be  better  targeted  as  a  result  of  the  shift  from  personal  care  (tertiary  level)  to \npublic  health  support  (i.e.,  vertical  programs  for  tuberculosis,  malaria,  purchase  of  drugs, \nsurveillance, expansion of public health facilities).  \n\nThe adjustment costs for the reform program are estimated at $280 million over 3 years \n\nAdjustment Costs \n\n                                                 \n1 National Statistic Coordination Board. 2003. \n\n \n\n\f48\n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\n \nTable A7.2: Reform Cost Estimates, 3-Year Period \n($ million) \n\nSubtotal (1) \n\nItem \nPromotion Participation, Linkages, and Public Accountability \n \nPublic Expenditure Reform in the Sector \nA.

Subsidies  will \nbe provided increase social insurance coverage of the poor (assuming 25% of the population or \n21.5 million people). Further structural adjustments will be achieved with a view to encouraging \nthe mobilization of extrabudgetary resources, granting hospital autonomy in managing revenues \ngenerated, and supporting the establishment of local health boards. \n \n6. \nTaking  into  consideration  the  high  capital  and  recurrent  costs  of  health  facilities,  the \nGovernment will support the establishment of interlocal health zones (ILHZs) by improving and \nintegrating  health  referral  systems  (upgrading  core  referral  hospitals,  and  satellite  barangay \nhealth stations and rural health units). Under the proposed reforms, higher-level health facilities \nare  to  be  rationalized  in  favor  of  public  health  and  secondary  facilities.  HSDP  implementation \nwill involve a radical overhaul of management processes at hospital and public health facilities \nalong with considerable strengthening of capacities for designing, managing, and implementing \nhealth  sector  reforms.  Through  the  Health  Sector  Reform  Agenda,  the  Government  is \ncommitted to support moves toward self-management and autonomy of health institutions at all \ninstitutionalized.  Cost \nlinkages,  and  public  accountability  will  be \nlevels.  Participation, \ncontainment, output, performance-based funding mechanisms will become the basis of resource \nallocation.  Finally,  quality  improvement  and  drug  regulation  will  be  reformed  through  clinical \npractice  guidelines,  procurement  schemes,  competitive  pricing,  devolution  of  Bureau  of  Food \nand  Drugs,  and  establishment  of  national  drug  board.

In  keeping  with  the \nthrusts  and  objectives  of  HSRA,  the  Project  will  focus  on  the  implementation  of  reform  in  five \nareas, namely (i) hospital reforms, (ii) public health reforms, (iii) health care financing reforms, \n(iv) local health systems development, and (v) regulatory services reforms. \n\n \n2. \n The Project is targeting five preselected provinces: Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Nueva Vizcaya, \nOriental  Mindoro,  and  Romblon.  The  Project\u2019s  three  components\u2013health  sector  governance, \nhospital reform, and local health systems reform have environmental impacts. \n\n \n3. \nThe  procedure  adopted  to  identify  all  significant  environmental  impacts  from  different \nstages  of  subproject  development1  is  contained  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects  (Checklist  of  Environmental \nParameters  for  Urban  Development  Projects),  and  the  results  were  checked  for  consistency \nagainst  the  new  guidelines,  except  for  the  Sapalibutad  and  Pulongbulo  subprojects  where \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  were  used.  A  more  detailed  description  of \nenvironmental issues relating to the Project and a detailed initial environmental examination for \na typical interlocal health zone are set out in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\n \n2. \n\nDescription of the Project and Environment \n\nSubprojects will involve small-scale construction and civil works such as buildings, local \n4. \nroads  and  drains.  Most  are  likely  to  improve  the  environment.  All  subprojects  generate  small, \nbut  significant  environmental  impacts  during  construction.  The  proposed  works  by  their  very \nnature  mitigate  environmental  impacts  and  reduce  the  inherent  health  risks  attributable  to \nunplanned development of health facilities. The environment of the subproject sites is normally \nurban, albeit poorly serviced. No significant species of flora or fauna are expected to be found. \nTopography varies, but is generally flat. Soil conditions vary greatly. \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n3. \n \n5. \nImpacts  associated  with  small-scale  civil  works  and  small  medical  facilities  common  to \nthe  subprojects,  and  recommended  mitigation  measures,  are  set  out  in  Table  A9.1.  These \nrecommended  measures  are  simple  and  easy  to  integrate  in  the  feasibility  and  detailed \nengineering studies. \n\n4. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n\nBecause  subprojects  will  normally  not  have  significant  environmental \n\n6. \nimpacts, \nparticipating Local Government Units (LGUs) will be required to obtain either certificates of non \ncoverage or environmental compliance from the regional Environmental Management Bureaus \nof the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. This will require consultant support \n\n                                                 \n1  \n\nIncluding location, design, construction, and operation stages. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n  51\n\nto  the  unified  project  management  unit  (UPMU).  The  component  of  the  investment  loan \nsupporting DOH will provide this, while institutionalizing the capacity within DOH. \n \n7. \nThe UPMU will not approve subprojects without the appropriate environmental clearance \nand environmental management plan. The steering committee will monitor compliance. Both the \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plans  are  set  out  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E. \nThe  investment  process  is  consultative,  and  project  interventions  will  be  discussed  with  the \ncommunity concerned. \n \n\nTable A8:1 Environmental Impacts and Typical Recommended Mitigation  \nMeasures for the Health Sector Development Project \n\nDegree of Significance \n\nNo impact is projected as the Project involves only upgrading of existing facilities. No \nadditional facilities will be constructed; therefore, no additional land is required. \nSince  the  proposed  intervention  only  entails  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of \nexisting facilities, it is not projected to impact on the water quality in the area. \nLevels  of  Total  Suspended  Particulates  (TSP),  SOx  and  NOx  will  increase  as  a \nresult of the operation of equipment and machinery and the increase in volume of \nvehicular traffic. However, this impact is temporary and short-term in nature, and is \nconsidered insignificant considering the project type and scale.   \nThe  operation  of  equipment  and  machinery  and  the  increase  in  the  volume  of \nvehicular  traffic  in  the  area  will  inadvertently  result  in  increased  levels  of  noise.  \nHowever, this is temporary and short-term and is, therefore, an insignificant impact. \nSince  no  additional  land  is  required,  clearing  of  vegetative  cover  will  not  be \nnecessary. Habitat for faunal communities in the study area will not be affected. \n\nNo impact is projected on this parameter as the Project involves only upgrading of \nexisting facilities. No additional facilities will be constructed, therefore no additional \nland is required. \n Since the proposed intervention only entails rehabilitating and upgrading    existing \nfacilities, water quality in the area will not be affected.   \nLevels of TSP and other gaseous materials, such as SOx and NOx will increase as \na  result  of  the  operation  of  heavy  equipment  and  machinery  and  the  increase  in \nvolume of vehicular traffic. Likewise, this impact is temporary and short-term and is \nconsidered insignificant. \nThe  operation  of  equipment  and  machinery  and  the  increase  in  the  volume  of \nvehicular traffic in the area will inadvertently result in increased levels of noise, but \nthis is a temporary impact and short-term. It is a significant impact. \nSince no additional land is required, no vegetative cover will be cleared.  Habitat for \nfaunal communities in the study area will not be affected. \n\nC. Operation and Maintenance Phase \n1.  Land and \n\n No significant impact. \n\nThe  Project  will  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  water  resources  in  the  area \nduring its operation.   \nDuring  this  phase  of  the  Project,  the  volume  of  vehicular  traffic  is  projected  to \nincrease. Consequently, emissions from these sources will also increase, primarily \nSOx  and  NOx.  The  level  of  this  impact,  however,  is  projected  to  be  lower  than \nduring  the  previous  phases  (pre-construction  and  construction)  of  the  Project. \nOwing to the project type and scale, this impact is insignificant. \nThe  operation  of  the  rehabilitated  facilities  will  have  no  significant  impact  on  the \nnoise levels in the area. \nDuring  the  operation  phase  of  the  proposed  intervention,  an  increase  in  patients \nserviced  is  anticipated.  Consequently,  an  increase  in  hospital  waste  generation  is \nprojected. This impact is significant. \n\n6. \n\nFloral and Faunal  During  this  phase  of  the  Project,  impacts  on  the  terrestrial  ecology  of  the  Project \n\nIssue \n\nA. Preconstruction Phase \n1.

Pilot  site  investigations  included  opportunities  for  the  public  to \nparticipate in the design process of the subprojects.  \n \nParticipating  LGUs  will  incorporate  the  process  of  consultation  in  their  activities.  The \n9. \nLGUs concerned will ensure that all those affected, including owners of assets and occupants of \nprivate lands affected by right-of-way acquisition and other physical developments in relation to \nthe proposed subproject are properly consulted. Individual visits and consultation meetings were \nconducted.  Minutes  of  the  meetings  and  agreements  reached  will  be  properly  documented, \nincluding the master list of people to be affected.  \n\n6. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n \n\n10. \nThe assessment and evaluation of the interventions showed that none would require the \npreparation of an environment impact assessment. No interventions or activities proposed can \nbe  considered  to  be  environmentally  critical  or  are  projected  to  create  significant  adverse  or \nnegative  impacts  on  the  environment.  However,  potential  adverse  impacts  of  some  of  the \nproposed  activities/interventions,  specifically  the  upgrading  of  existing  health  facilities,  may  to \nsome extent be significant in degree, albeit temporary in nature, localized in scope, and would \nnot have long-term deleterious impacts on the receiving environment. Moreover, these impacts \nare  avoidable  and  can  be  mitigated  through  proper  planning  and  the  employment  of  efficient \nconstruction methodologies. Positive socio-economic impacts are predicted to occur as a result \nof the implementation of the activities/interventions. This will result in better living conditions for \nthe  poor  and  vulnerable.  Nevertheless,  it  is  recommended  that  an  initial  environment \nexamination  of  the  specific  subprojects  be  carried  out  during  project  implementation  once  the \nspecific  facilities  and  their  sites  are  identified,  for  a  more  detailed  assessment  of  probable \nimpacts of the subprojects.  \n \n\n7. \n\nConclusions \n\nthe  environment, \n\n \nThe  conclusion  of  the  assessment  is  that  the  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  positive \n13. \nto  neighborhood \nimpact  on \ninfrastructure  and  because  of  improved  awareness  of  the  correct  procedures  for  handling \nhospital  waste.  Impacts  during  construction  are  expected  to  be  minor,  temporary  and \nadequately addressed by DOH, UPMU staff, and consultant resources available for the Project. \n \nB. \n \n\nEnvironmental Assessment of the Policy Matrix \n\nin  particular  because  of \n\nimprovements \n\n1. \n\nDescription of Policy Interventions \n\n \n14. \nThe policy matrix set out in Appendix 5 sets out the reforms required in each of the five \nareas.

The exception is, within the \nHospital  Reforms  component,  the  bolstering  of  regulations  on  the  handling  of  hospital  waste. \nThe policy interventions and their impacts are set out in the matrix in Table A9.2. \n \n\nTable A9.2: Policy Interventions and Impacts \n\n \nPolicy Intervention \n\nHealth Care \nFinancing Reform \nHospital Reforms \n\nEconomic and Social \nOutcomes \n\nIncrease coverage and \nlevel of services to the poor \nMore efficient local \nhospitals offering higher \nquality services especially \nto the poor \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nNone \n\nMitigation \nMeasures \n\nNone \n\nHospital waste management will \nbe improved \nWhere new investment is \ncatalyzed some minor, \nparticularly construction, \nimpacts may occur \nNone \n\n \n \nProject loan will \ninstitutionalize \nappropriate \nprocedures \nNone \n\nRegulatory Reforms  Lower cost provision of \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nPublic health \nreforms \n\nMore funding for public \nhealth especially for the \npoor \n\nLocal Health \nSystem Reform \n\nHealth Sector \nGovernance \n\nservices \nMore efficient local health \nservices offering higher \nquality services especially \nto the poor \nSupports the previous and \nis focused on improving \nefficiency in the health care \nsystem \n\n \n2. \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan \n\nWhere new investment is \ncatalyzed, some minor, \nparticularly construction, \nimpacts may occur \nNone \n\nProject loan will \ninstitutionalize \nappropriate \nprocedures \nNone \n\n \n15. \nThe  only  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  associated  with  subcomponents \nof two components. These components are under the supervision of DOH and the participating \nLGUs. The environmental management plan will thus be focused on improving the capacity of \nDOH and participating LGUs to correctly identify and manage environmental issues. This plan \nwill be formulated in detail by consultants working under the project loan. \n \n\n3. \n\nConclusion \n\n \n16. \nThe  conclusion  of  the  assessment  is  that  the  HSDP  is  expected  to  have  no  impact  on \nthe environment. Where it catalyzes new development it will normally have a positive impact on \nthe  environment,  in  particular  because  of  improvements  to  neighborhood  infrastructure  and \nbecause of improved awareness of the correct procedures for handling hospital waste. Impacts \nduring  construction  are  expected  to  be  minor,  temporary,  and  adequately  addressed  by  the \nenvironmental management guidelines prepared by consultants funded under the Project. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n54\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nItem\nA.

Improved  health  leads  to  higher  productive  capabilities.  For  women  in  particular, \nimproved  health  status  and  reduced  fertility  through  enhanced  family  planning  services  will  enhance  their  individual \nproductivity. In addition, the Project will facilitate the empowerment of poor, marginalized, and vulnerable groups. Their \nskills and competencies will be developed by supporting community-based organizations to participate in local health \nplanning and to increase representation on local health boards. These capacities become lifelong skills that they can \nuse in negotiating, claim-making, and searching for alternatives to improve their socioeconomic status.  \n \nThe  Project  directly  targets  approximately  175,000  poor  households  or  close  to  a  million  people  in  the  five  project \nprovinces Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Nueva Vizcaya, Mindoro Oriental, and Romblon (in 2000, the five project provinces had \na total population of approximately 2.1 million people, or 400,000 households). These beneficiaries are composed of \npoor families whose incomes cannot meet the basic food and nonfood requirements, and subsistence poor families, \nwhose incomes cannot meet even basic food requirements. The beneficiaries also include vulnerable groups such as \nwomen  of  reproductive  age  (15\u201349  years  of  age),  households  headed  by  women,  children  under  5,  and  indigenous \npeople.  Of  the  total  number  of  project  beneficiaries,  more  than  half  of  the  female  beneficiaries  will  be  women  of \nchildbearing age and 13% will be children under 5.  \n \nThe Project will ensure that (i) at least 95% of children in the project areas are fully immunized; (ii) the contraceptive \nprevalence  is  increased  by  at  least  15%;  (iii)  at  least  90% of  the  poor  are  enrolled  in  the  National  Health  Insurance \nProgram  either as sponsored, or individually paying members; (iv) at least 80% of births are delivered in a certified or \naccredited  health  facility  and  attended  by  a  trained  health  care  professional;  (v)  at  least  70%  of  the  poor  and \nindigenous population are located within 5 kilometers or 1 hour from a primary health care service provider; and (vi) at \nleast  50%  of  the  poor  are  consulting  the  barangay  health  stations  (BHS),  rural  health  units  (RHUs),  or  hospital \noutpatient department for treatment or preventive services.   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nThe primary source of income in the five provinces is farming, followed by \nwage employment in both the formal and informal sectors. Other sources of \nincome  are  largely  rental  incomes  and  remittances  and  subsidies  from \nfamily members who are working either domestically or abroad. Household \nexpenditure  analysis  reveals  that  poor  households  spend  almost  50%  of \ntheir  income  on  food  items.  Second  to  food  comes  expenditure  on \nproduction/income-generating related activities. Education expenses come \nin third.  Because of their meager incomes, investing in health is simply not \na priority among poor households. Lack of access to quality health services \nis the common complaint among the provinces. Long distances, bad roads, \nand  inadequate  transportation  hamper  access  to  health  facilities,  services \nand providers.  \n \nPoverty incidence varies across the five project provinces. Compared with \nnational poverty incidence of 28.4% of families in 2000, three of the project \nprovinces  have  significantly  higher  poverty  incidences.  In  2000,  Nueva \nVizcaya had the lowest poverty incidence (15.9%), followed by Ilocos Norte \n(18.2%),  while  about  half  of  the  households  in  Mindoro  Oriental  (43.7%), \nRomblon  (55.2%),  and  Ifugao  (55.6%),  were  considered  poor.  The \npercentage  of  households  who  will  directly  benefit  from  the  Project  is \n\n \nPoverty intervention \nTargeted intervention (M 1\u20137) \n\n    Targeting Classification \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n 63\n\nsignificantly higher in the poorest provinces. The distribution of households \ndirectly benefiting from the Project is as follows: 67.8% in Ifugao, 27.5% in \nIlocos  Norte,  28.3%  in  Nueva  Vizcaya,  46.4%  in  Oriental  Mindoro,  and \n73.4% in Romblon.   \n  \nThe  following  specific  mechanisms  are  included  in  the  project  design  to \nmaximize the benefit of the Project for the poor: (i) construction of a total of \napproximately  160  BHSs,  and  upgrading  and  expansion  of  existing  RHUs \nand BHSs; (ii) establishment of an effective mechanism for identifying and \nprioritizing the poor and determining their unmet needs for essential health \nservices;  (iii)  strengthening  of  organizations/  associations  of  the  poor  so \nthat  they  can  be  appropriately  represented  in  at  least  70%  of  local  health \nboards  in  project  sites;  (iv)  training  and  organization  of  Barangay  Health \nWorkers    to  promote  healthy  lifestyles  and  to  disseminate  information  on \nessential  health  services  that  are  made  available  at  BHSs  and  RHUs  in \nbarangays with a majority of poor and/or indigenous people; (v) provision of \nhealth  insurance  coverage  for  at  least  90%  of  the  poor  and  indigenous \npeople  households  in  the  areas  covered  by  the  Project;  (vi)  provision  of \ntechnical  and  financial  support  for  community-based  health  programs  and \nprojects targeting poor and other marginalized groups in particular; and (vii) \nimprovement of the capacity of frontline health workers so that the poor can \nbe provided with quality health care. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA stakeholder analysis has been prepared.   \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA participation strategy has been prepared. Specific design measures have been included in the Project to enhance \nparticipation of the beneficiaries, these include (i) establishing a community-based information system to identify and \nprioritize unmet needs for essential health services, including social health insurance; (ii) strengthening and assisting \norganizations of the poor to become members of the local health boards.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: A gender strategy has been prepared. The gender strategy includes the \nfollowing  measures:  (i)  design  and  installation  of  gender-disaggregated  community-based  information  systems  in  all \nbarangays;  (ii)  upgrading  and  expansion  of  RHSs  and  BHSs  into  birthing  and  lying-in  clinics;  (iii)  conversion  of \nselected health facilities into centers for obstetrics and gynecology, maternal care, women\u2019s diseases, and victims of \nviolence; (iv) expansion of interventions in health care financing to include prenatal care, childbirth, postnatal care, and \nfamily planning as part of the insurance package; (v) targeting of poor women and households headed by women as \nenrollees  of  PhilHealth\u2019s  sponsored  program;  (vi)  capacity  building  for  barangay  health  workers  and  family  health \nvolunteers  in  improved  primary  health  care  techniques,  particularly  women's  health  and  reproductive  health;  (vii) \ncapacity  building  for  women  leaders  and  entrepreneurs  in  community  drug  programs  and  reproductive  health;  (viii) \nprovision of technical assistance and seed funds for women-initiated and women-managed community-based projects; \n(ix) equal opportunities for women and men health providers for training, capacity building, and fellowship; promotion \nof gender awareness and sensitivity among health providers as part of quality assurance; (x) gender awareness and \nsensitivity  among  community  members  in  the  project  sites  through  inclusion  of  gender  messages  in  information, \neducation,  and  communication  materials  and  training;  (xi)  and  enhancement  and  implementation  of  Department  of \nHealth  (DOH)  policy  on  gender,  and  promotion  of  gender  sensitivity  among  national,  regional,  and  provincial  DOH \nstaff. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n   No                  See Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n   Yes               \n\n    Yes \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan Required \n\nrequired  will \n\n \nUnknown,  but  unlikely;  most  civil  works  will  be \nrehabilitation.

The \nHSDP  includes  a  civil  work  component  (the  Project)  aiming  at  expanding  hospitals  and \nexpanding or constructing rural health units (RHU) and barangay health stations (BHS) in five \ncandidate  provinces:  Ifugao,  Ilocos  Norte,  Nueva  Vizcaya,  Oriental  Mindoro,  and  Romblon. \nLand acquisition and resettlement (LAR) for the Project is expected to be minimal and, at times, \nunnecessary.  RHUs  and  BHSs  are  small  facilities  requiring  no  more  than  160  m2  and  60  m2 \nrespectively.  Hospital  expansion  may  need  wider  plots,  but  also  in  this  case  is  expected  to \ncause  impacts  below  the  \u201csevere  impact\u201d  threshold1  defined  by  the  ADB  resettlement  policy. \nWhere  RHU,  BHS  and  hospitals  will  be  renovated  or  expanded  within  the  properties  of  these \nfacilities, LAR will not be needed.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nTo  plan  the  compensation  of  project  impacts  the  Department  of  Health  (DOH),  the \nimplementing  agency,  has  prepared  Compensation  Policy  Framework  and  Procedural \nGuidelines  (CPFPG)  fitting  relevant  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  as \ndetailed in the Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. The CPFPG establishes \na  compensation  policy  for  the  Project  inclusive  of  eligibility/entitlement  provisions  and \nassurances guaranteeing that eventual donations of land are fully voluntary. The CPFPG also \ndetails  LAR  preparation  and  implementation  procedures  and  activities.  Supplementary \nAppendix F provides detailed frameworks. \n \n\nCompensation Policy Framework and Procedural Guidelines  \n\n1.  \n\nCompensation Policy \n\n \n3. \nThe  CPFPG  establishes  the  following  policy  principles:  (i)  negative  impacts  will  be \nminimized  as  much  as  possible  and,  unless  absolutely  necessary  impacts  affecting  informal \nsettlers will be avoided; (ii) when impacts cannot be avoided compensation will be sufficient to \nimprove  or  at  least  restore  the  pre-project  income  and  living  standards  of  those  affected;  (iii) \nlack  of  formal  title  to  land  should  not  be  a  bar  to  compensation  or  rehabilitation;  (iv) \ncompensation  activities  will  be  carried  out  with  equal  consideration  of  women  and  men;  the \ncompensation beneficiaries will be the documented owners independent of their gender; (v) the \naffected persons will be fully informed and consulted on compensation options and resettlement \nplanning;  (vi)  asset  compensation  will  be  provided  at  market  rates  (for  land  and  crops)  and  at \nreplacement  rates  (for  houses  and  other  assets);  (vii)  compensation,  replacement  land  and \nrehabilitation  provisions/allowances  will  be  provided  in  full  prior  to  ground  leveling  and \ndemolition;  and  (viii)  resettlement  and  compensation  costs  will  be  included  in  subproject \nbudgets. \n \nThe CPFPG sets eligibility/entitlement provisions for various losses and subsidies. Land \n4. \nlosses  will  be  compensated  in  cash  at  market  rates  or  through  \u201cland  for  land\u201d  arrangements. \nFull/partial  buildings  losses  will  be  compensated  in  cash  at  replacement  rates  free  of \ndepreciation,  demolition  expenses,  and  salvaged  materials;  crop  losses  will  be  paid  at  market \n                                                 \n1  Severe  impacts  occur  when  more  than  200  national  majority  individuals  or  100  Indigenous  Peoples  individuals  are \n\naffected by losses exceeding 10% of their productive land or income and/or are relocated.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66\n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n \n\n \n2. \n\nrates, and tree losses will be compensated based on the productive value of each tree. Finally, \naffected  sharecroppers,  house  renters,  relocates,  and  businesses  owners  will  respectively \nreceive a production allowance covering the value of 1 year produce in affected plots, a rental \nallowance  covering  a  standard  3  months  rent  in  project  areas,  a  transfer  allowance  covering \ntransport costs, and a Business losses allowance based on tax declarations or local minimum \nsalaries for each month of interruption of business activities up to 1 year. \n \n5. \nAs it is common in local government unit (LGU) projects in the Philippines, land may be \nprocured through donations. This is acceptable under ADB policy, but only if the donations are \ndemonstrably  voluntary.  To  satisfy  this  requirement,  the  CPFPG  establishes  the  following \nconditions:  (i)  a  donation  is  to  be  a  donor\u2019s  informed  decision  based  on  knowledge  of  his/her \nentitlement to compensation at market rates and asset compensation amounts; (ii) the donation \ndoes not affect the donor\u2019s livelihood; (iii) the plots to be donated are titled, are not rented out, \noccupied by squatters, or encumbered; (iv) the voluntary nature of the donation is documented \nby: (a) a signed Deed of Donation; and (b) by a signed statement that the donor is aware of the \nabove  conditions.  The  inclusion  of  both  documents  in  the  LAR  plan  will  be  the  basis  for  ADB \napproval for the plan.   \n \n\nLAR Preparation and Implementation: Activities and Procedures \n\nimpact  assessment/AP \n\n  \nCPFPG approval by ADB and LGUs will respectively be a condition for project appraisal \n6. \nand  province  inclusion  in  the  Project.  ADB  approval  of  the  LAR  plans  will  be  a  condition  for \ncontract  awards;  LAR  plan  implementation  will  be  a  condition  for  civil  works  initiation.  LARP \npreparation will entail: (i) identification of the plots needed by each subproject;  (ii) preparation \ninventory;  (iii)  valuation  of  affected  assets  at  market \nof  an \nvalue/replacement  cost;  and  (iv)  public  consultation/information  activities.  These  activities  will \nbe  carried  out  by  the  Municipal  Planning  and  Development  Office  (MPDO)  with  Barangay \nCaptains\u2019  assistance.  Based  on  the  above  activities,  the  MPDO  will  prepare  a  budgeted  and \nscheduled LARP fitting ADB requirements. As it is expected that each subproject will affect less \nthan 200 individuals (and less than 100 in the case of BHS and BHU construction)2 the LARPs \nwill follow in principle a Short LARP format.  \n \nThe  overall  responsibility  for  LAR  rests  on  the  LGUs.  The  Municipal  Planning  and \n7. \nDevelopment  Officer,  in  coordination  with  barangay  leaders,  is  responsible  for  LARAP \npreparation with funds provided by the LGU. LARP preparation/implementation will be based on \nintense public consultation carried through surveys and meetings and involving EA, LGUs and \nAPs. A summary of the CPFPG will be distributed to all APs. CPFPG and LARPs in Tagalog will \nbe made available to the public in each LGU. The same documents in English will be disclosed \non the ADB website. Grievance will be first lodged at the barangay. If no settlement is reached, \nthe grievance may be lodged to the MPDO. If still unresolved, a case can then be lodged at the \nProvincial  Health  Office  and,  if  needed,  further  appealed  at  the  central  Project  PMO.  The  last \navailable  appeal  option  will  be  at  the  appropriate  court  of  law.  The  MPDO  will  monitor  LAR \nimplementation quarterly. External monitoring will be assigned to an external monitoring agency \n(EMA).  The  MPDOs  will  report  quarterly  to  central  PMO  and  ADB.  EMA  reports  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  semi-annually  and  will  be  supplemented  by  a  final  evaluation  report  at  the \nend of the Project. \n \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB policy requires a full LARP when project impacts are severe (see footnote 1).   \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n67\n\nINDIGENOUS PEOPLES FRAMEWORK1 \n\nBackground \n\nThe Indigenous Peoples Policy Framework \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  the  pre-selected  provinces  the  subprojects  may  affect  Indigenous  Peoples  (IP). \n1. \nConsidering  project  interventions,  negative  impacts  on  IPs  will  be  limited  to  LAR,  which,  as \nalready noted, will be minimal, if not unnecessary. In view of this fact, the provisions set out in \nthe CPFPG are deemed sufficient to safeguard not only mainstream Filipinos but also IPs. \n \n2. \n If  the  Project\u2019s  negative  impacts  on  IPs  are  extremely  small,  the  positive  impacts  on \nthem are substantial. On the one hand the construction of new BHUs and BHSs will be carried \nout  in  remote  areas  where  IPs  have  poor  access  to  basic  health  facilities.  On  the  other,  the \nhealth  services  reform  pursued  by  the  Project  stands  to  directly  benefit  IP  stakeholders  by \nincreasing  the  availability  of  doctors  in  isolated  barangays,  establishing  less  discriminatory \nmedical practices and attitudes, and providing health programs and delivery mechanisms better \npatterned  on  the  needs  of  specific  beneficiaries.  In  order  to  ensure  that  these  benefits  are \nsystematically  extended  to  IP  communities  the  DOH  has  prepared  an  Indigenous  Peoples \nPolicy Framework (IPPF) based on a social assessment (SA), relevant local laws, and the ADB \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  IPPF  provides  a  definition  of  IP,  identifies  the  groups  that  may  be  affected  by  the \nProject and summarizes SA results and IPPF legal background. The IPPF also details IP policy \nprinciples, IP strategy and relative task organization and preparation. \n \n4. \nIP  Policy  Principles.  The  IP  policy  principles  for  the  Project  are:  (i)  all  efforts  will  be \nmade to distribute project benefits to IP communities;(ii) project interventions will be carried out \nin  full  respect  of  the  needs  and  traditions  of  the  IPs  and  will  not  lead  to  their  further \nmarginalization;  (iii)  IPs  will  not  suffer  unmitigated  adverse  impacts  during  or  after  Project \nimplementation;  (iv)  when  medically  beneficial,  the  IPs  traditional  health  practices  will  be \nincluded  in  Project  programs;  (v)  health  information  materials  provided  by  the  Project  will  be \nhanded  to  IP  beneficiaries  in  a  language  they  can  understand  well  and  read.  (vi)  IP \nrepresentatives  will  be  included  in  the  Project  decision-making  process;  (vii)  IPs  will  be  given \nbroad  opportunities  to  participate  in  Project  outputs  design  and  in  Project  decisions;  (viii)  the \nProject  will  pave  the  way  for  the  formation/institutionalization  of  productive  partnerships \nbetween local governments and IP communities based on principles of equity.  \n  \n5. \nIP  strategy  for  the  Project.  The  Project  will  not  have  a  separate  component  for  IPs. \nKey to the inclusion of the IPS into the design/implementation of the reformed health services \nand  other  Project  deliverables  will  be  an  intensive  participatory  process  involving  both \nmainstream and ethnic minority people. This participatory program will be carried for the entire \nduration of the Project through focus groups, community meetings, and questionnaires and will \ninvolve  IPs  both  as  Project  planners  and  as  project  beneficiaries.  The  objective  of  public \nparticipation activities is the incorporation of the needs of each significant social group in project \nareas, \nthe \nplanning/construction of new health facilities.   \n \n\nthe  design/delivery  of  new  health  services  and \n\nincluding \n\nIPs, \n\ninto \n\ninto \n\n                                                 \n1 See Supplementary Appendix F for details. \n\n \n\n\f68\n\n \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n \n\nOrganization  and  Responsibilities.  Overall  responsibility  for  the  preparation  and  the \n6. \nimplementation  of  Project  programs  and  for  ensuring  that  Project  benefits  will  be  extended  to \neventual  IP  communities,  rests  on  the  Provincial  PMU.  Data  collection,  participatory  planning \nactivities,  and  the  preparation  of  annual  action  plans  will  be  carried  out  by  an  NGO,  which,  in \nthe relevant provinces, will include substantial IP staff. The annual action plans will have to be \napproved by the Provincial Health Board (PHB) and by ADB. \n  \n7. \nIPPF Preparation Activities. After the establishment of the PMU the first activities will \nbe  hiring  the  NGO  that  will  carry  out  participatory  planning  activities,  and  the  preparation  of  a \nwork plan. In provinces inhabited by IPs, the NGO will include staff from local IP groups and the \nwork  plan  will  have  to  reflect  the  assurances  established  by  the  IPPF.  Following  this  initial \nphase project preparation implementation will proceed by including the following tasks:  \n\nData-gathering  for  the  Community  Based  Information  System  (CBIS).  In  relevant \nprovinces,  this  task  will  involve,  through  workshops,  interviews  and  focus  groups,  IPs \nacross  gender  and  age  boundaries  and  traditional  leaders.  CBIS  information  will \ninclude: (a) IP demography and settlement patterns, (b) preferred location of new health \nfacilities, (c) agreed LAR compensation modalities; (d) IP perceptions on the way health \nservices  are  delivered;  and  (e)  all  data  needed  to  develop  tuberculosis  eradication, \nhealth insurance, and reproductive health programs. \n\nAnnual Action Plan preparation. Based on CBIS data, the NGO under the supervision of \nthe PMO will prepare a scheduled and budgeted Annual Action Plan (AAP) detailing all \nactivities  to  be  carried  out  in  the  year  to  follow,  including,  when  relevant,  specific \narrangements for IPs. \n\nIn  IP  provinces,  the  draft  AAP  will  be  disclosed  for  comments  to  the  IP  communities \nbefore submission to the Provincial Health Board for approval.          \n\nDisclosure.  The  IPPF  in  local  language  will  be  distributed  to  all  concerned  IP \n\n \n8. \ncommunities. The IPPF in English will be disclosed on the ADB website. \n \nMonitoring/Evaluation. The PMU will monitor Project implementation quarterly and will \n9. \ninclude  a  section  detailing  Project  activities  targeting  IPs  and  IP  degree  of  satisfaction.  The \nfindings  of  the  internal  monitoring  reports  will  be  reviewed  annually  by  an  external  monitoring \nagency (EMA). EMA reports will be compiled and submitted to the PMU and ADB annually. At \nthe end of the Project the EMA will prepare a final evaluation report on IP satisfaction. \n \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n  69\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nEconomic Rationale \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Philippine  health  sector  is  characterized  by  fragmentation;  underproduction,  and \n1. \nunderconsumption of public health and health promotion interventions; information asymmetries \nand  underproduction  of  information;  and  limited  effective  access  to  basic  care,  particularly  for \nthe poorest segments of the population. Inefficiency in the public delivery system is indicated by \nthe insufficient availability of affordable drugs and health personnel in the public sector provision \nsystem, and insufficient funding of public health as compared with personal care. The system's \noverall effectiveness\u2013in terms of health status achieved for the level of financial, physical, and \nhuman  resource  inputs  committed\u2013is  hampered  by  poor  quality,  limited  effective  access,  and \nmicro inefficiency. The impact of the financing system on distributional equity is regressive. The \nHealth Sector Development Program (HSDP) aims to improve health care delivery to the poor, \nvulnerable, and other marginalized population groups. This section sets out the economic and \nfinancial  analysis  of  the  HSDP.  Supplementary  Appendix  G  provides  a  more  detailed \ndiscussion. \n \n2. \n The HSDP is expected to yield an economic rate of return of about 28%. Although this \nassessment is based on a number of assumptions, sensitivity analysis indicates relatively robust \nresults.  Considerable  social  return  on  investment  is  anticipated  through  (i)  resource  cost \nsavings, and (ii) productivity benefits from a population in better health. Cost savings considered \nin  the  analysis  arise  from  three  sources:  (i)  efficiency  gains  in  the  hospital  sector  through \neconomies of scales achieved in the overall health service supply and optimum utilization rate, \n(ii)  reduced  transportation  costs  made  possible  by  the  availability  of  services  closer  to  the \nbeneficiary  population,  and  (iii)  reduction  of  the  drug  bill  through  improved  efficiency  in  the \nprocurement  and  distribution  system.  Productivity  gains,  on  the  other  hand,  result  from  fewer \nlives lost and less time lost due to illness. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  Municipal  Finance  Corporation  (MFC),  a  government  financing  institution,  was \nincorporated and registered in June 2004 as an affiliate of the Land Bank of the Philippines and \nis the successor to the Municipal Development Fund Office. Its role is to facilitate the access of \nlocal  government  units  (LGUs)  to  finance  for  development  investment.  MFC\u2019s  initial  paid-in-\ncapital is P2 billion. Using modest growth assumptions, MFC will continue to operate viably and \nprofitably in the next 6 years (2005, base year) by (i) generating income from low-cost sources \nof  funds  for  lending  and  investments;  (ii)  maintaining  sufficient  liquid  assets  to  meet  loan \ndrawdowns;  (iii)  preserving  the  balance  between  operating  expenses,  gross  income,  and  total \nassets; and (iv) ensuring that its capital adequacy indicator meets the central bank requirement. \nMFC estimates its total assets will grow from P3.3 billion in 2005 to P4.4 billion in 2010 (Table \nA17.1), an increase of more than 6% annually. Income after tax is expected to average about \nfrom P143 million annually during the 6-year period (Table A17.2). A summary of the financial \nperformance indicators of MFC for the next 5 years confirms its solid commitment to preserve a \ncapital  adequacy  ratio  that  is  higher  than  the  central  bank\u2019s  mandated  10%  (Table  A17.3). \nProfitability  is  projected  as  better  than  the  estimated  average  for  the  banking  sector,  as \nindicated by a projected return on assets of about 2.4% at the end of 2010. The proposed Asian \nDevelopment Bank loan will account for about 57% of MFC\u2019s projected total assets by the end \nof 2010 and will, thus, have a positive impact on its overall financial condition. \n \n\nAnalysis of the Municipal Finance Corporation \n\n \n\n\f70\n\n     Appendix 18 \n\n \nAccount \nAssets \nCash in Banks \nAccrued Interest Receivables \nInvestments in TB \nLoans Receivables \nOther Assets \n\nTable A17.1: Projected Balance Sheets of Municipal Finance Corporation, 2005\u20132010 \n(P' 000) \n\n2005 \n\n2005 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n \n\n61.6 \n126.1 \n1,990.9 \n1,085.7 \n9.1 \n3,273.3 \n\n \n106.1 \n124.8 \n1,990.9 \n1,528.7 \n9.1 \n3,759.6 \n \n43.4 \n13.6 \n61.1 \n12.2 \n1,528.7 \n2,100.5 \n3,759.6 \n\n \n149.8 \n151.4 \n1,990.9 \n1,755.3 \n9.1 \n4,056.4 \n \n61.1 \n13.9 \n62.8 \n12.5 \n1,755.3 \n2,150.7 \n4,056.4 \n\n \n200.5 \n165.0 \n1,990.9 \n1,949.2 \n9.1 \n4,314.6 \n \n70.2 \n14.4 \n65.0 \n13.0 \n1,949.2 \n2,202.7 \n4,314.6 \n\n \n251.8 \n176.6 \n1,990.9 \n2,043.3 \n9.1 \n4,471.7 \n \n78.0 \n14.8 \n66.5 \n13.3 \n2,043.3 \n2,255.9 \n4,471.7 \n\n \n301.9 \n182.2 \n1,990.9 \n1,953.8 \n9.1 \n4,438.0 \n \n81.7 \n14.6 \n65.9 \n13.2 \n1,953.8 \n2,308.7 \n4,438.0 \n\n \n\nTotal Assets \nLiabilities and Equity \nAccrued Interest Expense \nIncome Tax Payable \nPayable to National Government \nDividend Payable \nLoans Payable \nStockholders Equity and Retained Earnings \n\n44.3 \n14.3 \n64.5 \n12.9 \n1,085.7 \n2,051.6 \n3,273.3 \nMFC = Municipal Finance Corporation, TB = treasury bills. \nNote: Figures may not add up to total because of rounding. \nSource: Municipal Finance Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTotal Liabilities and Equity \n\nTable A17.2: Projected Income Statements of Municipal Finance Corporation, 2005\u20132010 \n(P '000) \n2005 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2010 \n\n \nAccount \nInterest Income -
