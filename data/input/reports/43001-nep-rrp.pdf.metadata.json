It  will  enable  people  to  resume  their  normal  lives  by \nrestoring  access  to  livelihoods  and  basic  infrastructure.  The \nproject  design  is  based  on  (i)  the  post-flood  joint  damage  and \nneeds assessment, led by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nOctober\u2013November 2008, with the participation of United Nations \n(UN)  agencies;  and  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s  preliminary  estimate  of \nflood  damage.  The  Government\u2014supported  by  UN  agencies, \nbilateral  partners,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)\u2014\nresponded effectively in the initial phase of the disaster. However, \n47,000  people  remain  displaced  in  temporary  accommodation, \nand  damage  to  infrastructure  and  livelihoods  has  been  severe. \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  in  coordination  with  central  and \nlocal  governments  in  recovery  activities  to  move  effectively  from \nthe humanitarian relief activities of the Government, UN agencies, \nand  NGOs  to  recovery  and  reconstruction.  The  Project  supports \nincreased  disaster  preparedness  and  mitigation  of  damage  from \nfuture  recurrent  floods  by  enhancing  the  Government\u2019s  disaster \nmanagement  capacity,  and  improving  the  disaster  recovery \nsystem in cooperation with the Government of India. \n \nThe devastating 2008 floods\u2014affecting 300,000 people mainly in \nthree \nlivelihood, \nsevere \ninfrastructure,  and  other  assets.  They  also  disrupted  economic \nactivities, inflicting heavy losses to crops and slowing expansion in \nindustries and services. The combined losses of the floods in both \nregions  are  estimated  at  $88  million.  Direct  losses  to  assets  and \noutput  because  of  flooding  amount  to  $30  million;  indirect  losses \nare  estimated  at  $58  million.  The  floods  slowed  progress  in \npoverty reduction, with the poor and the vulnerable suffering most \nin terms of losses to crops, livestock, property, and housing; and \nreduced income opportunities. \n \n\ndistricts\u2014caused \n\ndamage \n\nto \n\n \nRecipient \n \nClassification  \n \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n \n\nconstruction \n\ncost-effective \n\nspecifications \n\nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  restore  economic  activities \nquickly, mainly in the three districts; and to improve the livelihoods \nof about 300,000 people seriously affected by the 2008 floods. It \nwill  contribute  to  sustainable  economic  growth  by  minimizing  the \ndevastating  impact  of  the  floods  and  reduce  future  risk  from \nsimilar  disasters.  The  Project  will  focus  on  augmenting  incomes \nand  self-reliance  by  reviving  agriculture  in  the  affected  farmland \nand  restoring  the  livelihoods  of  affected  persons,  as  well  as \nrehabilitating  infrastructure.  The  interventions  were  identified  in \nconsultation  with  the  Government,  NGOs,  and  other  civil  society \norganizations;  and  involve  community  participation.  The  Project \nincludes  mitigation  of  damage  from  future  recurrent  floods  by \nof \nenhancing \nrehabilitated  infrastructure,  and  supporting  capacity  building  and \nthe Government\u2019s disaster preparedness. It has five parts. \n \nPart  A:  Agriculture.  Restore  the  livelihood  of  affected  people \nthrough revival of agriculture by distributing seeds and compost to \ngrow  crops  suitable  for  sandy  soil,  as  well  as  basic  farm \nequipment\u2014supported  by  extension  services,  skills  development \ntraining,  and  social  mobilization.  It  will  also  rehabilitate  fishponds \nand  minor \nfingerlings,  and  reconstruct \nirrigation,  distribute \nagriculture collection centers and marketplaces.   \n \nPart B: Irrigation. Rehabilitate damaged structures of 2 large and \n25  small  surface  irrigation  systems,  including  25  head  works; \n127 kilometers (km) of canals; 196 canal structures such as drain \nsyphons,  aqueducts,  gates,  outlets,  and  inlets;  36  km  of  canal \nservice  roads;  45  culverts  and  small  bridges;  1  medium-sized \nbridge; and 700 shallow tube wells.    \n \nPart  C:  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  Rehabilitate  28  gravity \nflow  water  supply  systems  in  Kailali  and  Kanchanur,  construct \n4 small overhead water supply systems, and install 3,500 shallow \ntube  wells  in  Sunsari  to  provide  access  to  drinking  water  and \nsanitation facilities. A health and hygiene awareness program will \nbe integral to part C.  \n \nPart  D:  Roads.  Rehabilitate  damaged  strategic  roads  in  the  far \nwestern region, including bridge and culvert protection works and \nlandslide stabilization works; and provide alternative access to the \nfar-eastern  region  by  constructing  the  Koshi  bridge  at  Chatara \nwith  the  objective  of  minimizing  the  damaging  impact  of  similar \npotential floods in the entire eastern region of the country.  \n \nPart E: Project Management. To ensure efficient implementation \nand  management  of  project  activities,  provide  adequate  staff  at \nthe  project  coordination  office \nto  support  project \nsupervision  and  monitoring,  and  capacity  building  for  preparing \nthe  strategies  and  actions  needed  to  prevent  and  mitigate  future \nfloods in the project districts.  \n\n(PCO) \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n \n\n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $32.00 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $3.19 million.   \n \n\nProject Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n     Amounta \n\n \n\nPart A: Agriculture Part \n\nItem \nBase Costb \n  \n   Part B: Irrigation Part \n   Part C: Water Supply and Sanitation Part \n   Part D: Roads Part \n   Part E: Project Management Part \n       Contingencies \n \na Includes taxes and duties of $3.19 million financed by the Government. \nb In January 2009 prices.   \nNote:  The bank charge will be financed from the grant resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n3.86 \n8.77 \n4.56 \n12.10 \n1.53 \n1.18 \n32.00 \n\nTotal  \n\n \n \nA grant of $25.60 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will \nbe  provided  to  help  finance  the  Project.

The  project  coordinator \nwill act as member secretary of the PSC. ADB may be invited by \nMPPW  to  attend  PSC  meetings  as  an  observer.  The  PSC  will \nmeet  at  least  six  times  in  the  first  year  and  as  and  when \nnecessary in subsequent years, but not less than once a quarter. \nTo coordinate the planning and execution of various components \nacross  the  sectors,  a  national  project  management  coordination \ncommittee  (NPMCC)  will  be  established  with  representation  from \neach  project  implementation  unit  (PIU).  The  PCO  will  coordinate \nNPMCC meetings, which will be held monthly. \n \nSince the value of individual civil works contracts will be relatively \nsmall and they will be widely scattered in disaster-affected areas, \nthey  are  not  likely  to  attract  international  contractors\u2014except  for \nbridge  construction,  which  requires \ninternational  competitive \nbidding.  National  procurement  of  civil  works  will  follow  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act,  2007,  and  Public \nProcurement  Regulations,  2007,  which  are  both  generally \nacceptable to ADB; and ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2007, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  flexibility  provided  in  ADB\u2019s \nDisaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004)  will  be  used \nwhere applicable. \n \nAt  the  outset  of  the  Project,  the  PCO  will  recruit  7  individual \nconsultants  to  advance  project  preparatory  activities.  This  will \ninclude 98 person-months of national consultants on an individual \nbasis for services in project management, benefit monitoring and \nevaluation, \nsocial \ndevelopment,  resettlement,  and  environment  management.  The \nPCO  will  also  recruit  5  individual  consultants  to  review  the \ninstitutional  aspect  of  flood  mitigation  work  and  draw  up  the \nstrategies  and  actions  needed  to  prevent  and  mitigate  future \ninternational \nfloods.  This  will \nconsulting  services  of  a  river  morphologist  for  6  months  and  an \ninstitutional  development  specialist  for  2  months;  and  32  person-\nmonths  of  national  consultants, \ninstitutional \ndevelopment specialist, a river engineer, and a river hydrologist.  \n \nGiven \nIAs\u2019  uneven \nimplementation  schedule, \ninstitutional  capacity,  and  the  need  for  accelerated  project \nimplementation,  the  Project  includes  four  design  and  supervision \nconsultant  packages,  one  firm  for  each  sector,  with  a  total  of \n464 person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The \nconsultants  will  assist  the  IAs  with  overall  implementation;  and \nensure  quality  of  civil  works,  governance,  risk  assessment  and \nmanagement,  and  other  related  areas.  Consulting  firms  and \nindividual  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n\ninclude  8  person-months  of \n\nfinancial  management, \n\nincluding  an \n\nprocurement, \n\ntight \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nto \n\nthe  Government \n\nthe  guidelines.  Subject \n\nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time)  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging  consultants.  At  the  request  of  the  Borrower,  ADB  has \nagreed  to  select  the  consultants  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower  for \ndesign  and  construction  supervision  of  the  project  activities  in \neach  sector.  Considering  the  urgency  and  need  to  expedite \nproject  implementation,  the  consultants  will  be  engaged  through \nthe  consultants'  qualifications  selection  method  as  provided  for \ntaking \nunder \nresponsibility  for  selection  and  engagement,  the  single  source \nselection method is an acceptable selection method in the context \nof emergency rehabilitation. \n \nThe project parts are expected to be technically feasible and cost-\neffective,  and  represent  a  least-cost  alternative  with  appropriate \nadjustment  for  flood  resistant  designs.  The  economic  analysis \nindicates that the economic internal rate of return for subprojects \nis  24.5%.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  restoration  activities  are \nthose  accrued  at  the  time  of  initial  construction,  but  mostly  lost \nbecause  of  flood  damage.  Project-financed  restoration  will  bring \ninfrastructure  back  to  original  productivity  and  efficiency.  While \nmost  restoration  works  will  aim  to  meet  immediate  emergency \nneeds,  the  restoration  of  permanent  structures  will  improve  their \nability to withstand future floods. \n \nThe project design includes features that will help reduce poverty \ndirectly or indirectly. It will provide short-term employment to poor \nwomen  and  men \nlabor-intensive \nconstruction works needed for rehabilitation of damaged road and \nirrigation  infrastructure.  All  sectoral  support  will  have  poverty \nimplications  by  recruiting  flood-affected  people  to  rehabilitate \ndamaged \nimproving  public \nservices  which  will  have  direct  impact  on  affected  people\u2019s  lives. \nThe support will help people directly or indirectly to mitigate risks \nof likely impoverishment. \n \nThe  project  parts  in  four  major  sectors\u2014agriculture,  irrigation, \nwater  and  sanitation,  and  roads\u2014will  contribute  to  reducing  the \nvulnerability and risks of affected people, who are displaced, poor, \nand  disadvantaged.  Social  mobilization  activities  and  group \norganization will improve the management capacity and influence \nof  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  in  the  reconstruction  of  damaged \nirrigation and water supply infrastructures, increasing their access \nto services.  \n \nConstruction  of  a  permanent  Koshi  bridge  at  Chatara  and \nrehabilitation of strategic roads will contribute to transportation of \ngoods  and  services \nthe  market\u2014creating  employment \nopportunities for the poor. Support for income generation activities \nwill be extended to the landless and poor farmers based on their \ndemand. \n \n\nin  skilled  and  unskilled \n\ninfrastructure  and \n\nland,  and  by \n\nto \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nfor \n\nAccording  to  the  Government\u2019s  return  strategy  for  Koshi  flood-\ndisplaced people, the Government assumes that 60% of currently \naffected  people  will  return  immediately  with  the  return  package, \nand  15%  of  people  with  high-level  damage  to  their  home  and \nfarmland  will  return  within  6  months.  These  people  will  be \nprovided  employment  opportunities  from  ongoing  ADB  projects \nand  rehabilitation  projects.  However,  about  25%  of  the  people \nhave  little  prospect  of  an  immediate  return  to  their  previous  area \nsince  deep  siltation  and  deep  water  have  prevented  their  land \nfrom  being  recovered,  and  some  are  landless  people.  ADB  is \nworking  with  the  Government  and  other  development  partners  to \nidentify  sustainable  resettlement  options \nthe  significant \npercentage of displaced people.   \n \nA  potential  risk  is  that  procedural  delays  in  obtaining  various \ngovernment approvals will slow implementation. The Government \nhas  shown  strong  commitment  to  the  Project  and  will  arrange \nsimplified  procedures.  Delays  at  the  executing  agency  (EA)  level \nwill be minimized through the selection of an EA with considerable \nexperience in implementing ADB-financed projects and familiarity \nwith  ADB  procedures,  implementation  by  an  established  PCO, \nand  consultant  selection  by  ADB.  In  the  past,  the  availability  of \ncounterpart funding has been a problem in ADB projects in Nepal. \nThe Ministry of Finance has assured that counterpart funds would \nbe provided to IAs on a timely basis.  \n \nGovernance-related \nincluding  corruption,  constitute \nanother  risk.  This  is  addressed  by  selecting  all  subprojects; \ntransparent  implementation  and  monitoring  mechanisms;  and \nspecific  financial  controls,  including  regular  as  well  as  random \naudits.  Measures  will  include  strict  construction  supervision  and \nstrong  consultant  support,  use  of \nthe  Public  Procurement \nRegulations, close monitoring by ADB staff, and random auditing \nof procurement and annual performance at the EA level. The PSC \nwill  be  supported  by  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialists  from \nMPPW and will be supported by two external consultants who will \n(i)  help  monitor  all  project  activities,  (ii)  conduct  random  spot \nchecks  during  project  implementation,  and  (iii)  provide  capacity \nbuilding in key areas of monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nA fourth risk is recurrence of major disasters and related extensive \ndamage.  This  is  addressed  by  adopting  cost-effective  flood-\nresistant  design  standards  for  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nstrengthening the capacity of DWIDP for flood preparedness and \nan  early  warning  system,  which  are  expected  to  reduce  damage \nfrom  future  floods.  The  risk  of  inadequate  maintenance  will  be \naddressed by the Government of Nepal in close coordination and \nongoing policy dialogue with the Government of India. \n\nissues, \n\n\f82  00'Eo\n\n88  00'Eo\n\n30  00'No\nFAR-WESTERN\nDEVELOPMENT\nREGION\n\nDARCHULA\nDarchula\nMAHAKALI\n\nBAITADI\n\nPatan\nDadeldhura\n\nBhatkanda\nDADELDHURA\n\nBAJHANG\n\nChainpur\n\nSETI\n\nBAJURA\n\nMartadi\n\nSilgarhi\n\nDipaya\n\nDOTI\n\nMangalsen\n\nACHHAM\n\nKALIKOT\n\nManma\n\nBanbasa\n\nMahendranagar\n\nKANCHANPUR\n\nGodawari\n\nHUMLA\n\nSimikot\n\nMID-WESTERN\nDEVELOPMENT\nREGION\n\nGamgadhi\n\nMUGU\n\nKARNALI\n\nJumla\n\nJUMLA\n\nDOLPA\n\nDunai\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\n\nWESTERN\nDEVELOPMENT\nREGION\n\nMUSTANG\n\nNEPAL\nEMERGENCY FLOOD DAMAGE\nREHABILITATION PROJECT\n\n30  00'No\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nMasuliya\n\nBabiyachour\n\nDhangadhi\n\nKAILALI\n\nRUKUM\n\nKol\n\nDAILEKH\n\nJAJARKOT\n\nDailekh\nBHERI\n\nJajarkot\n\nBirendranagar\n\nSURKHET\n\nBARDIYA\n\nSitdipati\n\nGulariya\n\nPatan\n\nBANKE\n\nTulsipur\n\nNepalganj\n\nMANANG\n\nChame\n\nJomson\n\nDHAWALAGIRI\nMYAGDI\n\nBeni\n\nPARBAT\n\nBaglung\n\nKushma\n\nSALYAN\n\nRAPTI\n\nSalyan\n\nROLPA\n\nBAGLUNG\n\nKASKI\nPokhara\n\nLAMJUNG\nGANDAKI\n\nGORKHA\n\nDhunche\n\nBesisahar\n\nRASUWA\nBAGMATI\n\nLiwang\n\nGorahi\n\nDANG\n\nPYUTHAN\n\nPyuthan\n\nGULMI\n\nSandikharka\n\nLamahi\n\nARGHAKHANCHI\n\nTamghas\n\nKAPILBASTU\nTaulihawa\n\nRUPANDEHI\n\nBhairahiwa\n\nKrishnanagar\n\nLumbini\n\nSunauli\n\nPALPA\nLUMBINI\n\nTansen\n\nButwal\n\nNAWALPARASI\n\nSYANJA\n\nSyanja\n\nTANAHU\n\nMugling\n\nGorkha\n\nBidur\n\nDHADING\n\nNarayangarh\n\nMeghauli\n\nNARAYANI\n\nBaruwa\n\nCHITWAN\n\nBhimpedi\n\nParasi\n\nSINDHUPALCHOK\n\nNaubise\n\nThankot\n\nNUWAKOT\nKakani\n\nKathmandu\n\nChautara\nBarhabise\n\nLALITPUR\n\nDakshinkali\n\nKATHMANDU\nBHAKTAPUR\nBhaktapur\nKABHRE\nPALANCHOK\n\nDOLAKHA\nCharikot\n\nJiri\n\nCENTRAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nREGION \n\nEASTERN\nDEVELOPMENT\nREGION\n\nHetauda\n\nLohathar\n\nPARSA\nPathlaiya\n\nBirganj\n\nRaxaul\n\nMAKWANPUR\nBARA\nKalaiya\n\nSOLUKHUMBU\nSalleri\n\nSANKHUWASABHA\n\nTAPLEJUNG\n\nPhungling\n\nMECHI\n\nRAMECHHAP\n\nRamecchap\n\nOKHALDHUNGA\nOkhaldhunga\n\nDiktel\n\nSINDHULI\n\nKHOTANG\n\nSAGARMATHA\n\nBhimeshwar\n\nSindhulimadi\n\nJANAKPUR\n\nKhandbari\n\nBhojpur\n\nBHOJPUR\n\nBasantpur\n\nDhankuta\n\nTERHATHUM\n\nPhidim\n\nTerhanthum\n\nPANCHTAR\n\nSARLAHI\n\nDhalkebar\n\nUDAYAPUR\n\nRAUTAHAT\n\nMalangawa\n\nGaur\n\nMAHOTTARI\n\nDHANUSHA\nJanakpur\n\nSIRAHA\n\nGaighat\n\nLahan\nSiraha\n\nSAPTARI\n\nRajbiraj\n\nJaleswar\n\nIlam\n\n27  00'No\n\nILAM\n\nKakarbhitta\n\nDHANKUTA\n\nKOSHI\n\nMaikhola\n\nDharan\nSUNSARI\nItahari\n\nMORANG\nRangeli\n\nJHAPA\nChandragadhi\n\nBiratnagar\n\nJogbani\n\nI   N   D   I   A\n\n27  00'No\n\n0\n9\n-\n1\n1\n0\n0\n \nH\nR\n\nProject District\n\nNational Capital\n\nDistrict Headquarters\n\nTown/Market Center\n\nNational Highway\n\nFeeder/District Road\n\nRiver\n\nDistrict Boundary\n\nZonal Boundary\n\nRegional Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\n82  00'Eo\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n88  00'Eo\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \n\n1. \nto Nepal for the Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\n1. \n\nFloods and Impact of Climate Change \n\n2. \nNepal,  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  is  highly  vulnerable  to \nrecurrent  floods  and  landslides.  Extreme  topographical  variations  and  unstable  steep  slopes \ncombined  with  torrential  rain  during  the  monsoon  season  result  in  frequent  floods  and \nlandslides.  These  disasters  cause  heavy  loss  of  life  and  property,  and  damage  infrastructure, \nthereby disrupting the social and economic development of the country.  \n \nIn addition to these natural processes, development activities and increasing population \n3. \nhave  caused  further  vulnerability  and  destabilization  of  land  resources.  Human-induced \nvulnerability stems from activities such as deforestation, cultivation of marginal lands and slope, \nroad  construction  in  hills  and  mountains,  and  encroachment  of  floodplains.  The  water-induced \ndisasters  have  been  occurring  more  frequently  in  recent  years.  Statistics  indicate  that \n7,300 people lost their lives in floods from 1983 to 2007.      \n \n4. \nWater-induced disasters in Nepal are usually triggered by extreme weather events and \nare  often  associated  with  heavy  rainfall  during  the  monsoon.  Rainfall  events  exceeding \n300 millimeters  (mm)  in  a  day,  which  disturb  both  slope  and  channel  equilibrium  on  a  region \nscale,  occur  frequently  in  the  country.  The  increasing  frequency  of  such  extreme  precipitation \nevents,  together  with  changes  in  snow  and  ice  cover  caused  by  global  warming  and  other \nfactors, have led to an increase in the number of water-induced disasters in the country.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDisaster Management \n\nThe  Department  of  Water  Induced  Disaster  Prevention  (DWIDP)  was  established  in \n5. \n2000 under the Ministry of Water Resources. DWIDP is responsible for managing and mitigating \nwater-induced  disasters.  The  Natural  Disaster  Relief  Act,  1982  (amended  in  1989  and  1992), \nprimarily  provides  the  legislative  framework  for  disaster  management.  However,  national \ndisaster  relief  regulations  need  to  be  formulated  as  the  act  does  not  describe  the  duties  and \nresponsibilities of all the disaster management agencies other than the Ministry of Home Affairs. \nDWIDP  plans  to  construct  infrastructure  for  mitigating  predictable  disasters  in  20  districts  and \nestablish  a  flood  warning  system  for  the  whole  country  by  2017. 1  The  floods  and  flood \nmanagement in Nepal are described in Appendix 2.  \n \n6. \nThe  hydro-meteorological  systems  of  mountain  areas  are  very  complex  and  are  poorly \nunderstood.  Nepal\u2019s  hydro-meteorological  network  is  still  poor;  the  existing  observational \nnetwork  is  not  capable  of  capturing  the  diversity  of  the  mountain  landscape,  and  there  are \ndifficulties in characterizing weather because there is little long-term data. Better data collection \nwith modeling and forecasting could eventually help reduce damage to life and property. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Water and Commission Secretariat. 2005. National Water Plan. Nepal. \n\n\fThere are more than 6,000 streams and rivers in Nepal. Most of the large rivers in Nepal \n7. \nhave  a  river  treaty  between  the  Government  of  Nepal  and  the  Government  of  India.  For  the \nKoshi  River,  the  Koshi  Project  Agreement,  which  was  signed  in  1954  by  the  Government  of \nNepal and the Government of India and amended in 1966, resulted in the Government of India \nconstructing  the  Koshi  barrage,  head  works,  other  appurtenant  works,  embankment  and \nprotective  works  for  the  purpose  of  flood  control,  irrigation,  generation  of  hydropower,  and \nprevention  of  erosion.  The  treaty  allows  the  Government  of  India  to  carry  out  surveys  and \nmaintenance  works.  However,  the  condition  of  the  embankment  has  deteriorated  because  of \nannual sedimentation from watershed with rugged and high-angle slope, and poor maintenance \nof the embankment and protective works. To prevent potential breach of the embankment in the \nfuture, its safety needs to be assessed regularly and monitored closely.   \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nImpact of the 2008 Floods \n\n8. \nOn  18  August  2008,  the  Koshi  River  breached  its  embankment  and  shifted  its  course. \nThis  caused  some  47,000  people  to  be  displaced  in  Nepal,  about  5,000  hectares  (ha)  of \nfarmland  to  be  damaged,  and  14  kilometers  (km)  of  road  in  different  places  along  the  East\u2013\nWest  Highway  to  be  badly  damaged.  Likewise,  incessant  heavy  rainfall  from  19  to \n21 September caused floods and landslides in the districts of the far western region (including \nKailali,  Kanchanpur,  Dadeldhura,  and  Doti)  and  in  the  mid-western  region  (including  Bardiya, \nBanke,  Dang,  and  Salyan  districts).  This  disaster  affected  43,500  families  and  physical \ninfrastructure  in  the  regions.  The  response  of  the  Government  and  development  partners  was \nquick and efficient in Sunsari and Saptari as well as in the far western region. The Government \ncontinues to lead response operations through the district disaster relief committees (DDRCs), \nwith the chief district officer (CDO) coordinating between local authorities and the line ministries. \nThe  work  of  the  international  humanitarian  community  in  both  regions  is  being  coordinated \nthrough a cluster system formalized by DDRC. \n \n9. \nOn 19 October 2008, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to lead a post-flood damage and needs assessment in the areas of roads, bridges, \nculverts, embankments, agriculture, irrigation, electricity, health clinics, educational institutions, \nwater supply, drainage and sewerage systems, and housing in order to assist the Government \nto  prepare  rehabilitation  works.  Following  the  Government\u2019s  official  request,  ADB  organized  a \nconsultation meeting with government agencies and development partners to discuss the flood \ndamage and needs assessment mission and fielded the assessment mission from 31 October \nto  9  November  2008.  The  assessment  mission  produced  a  final  report  (Supplementary \nAppendix A).   \n \n10. \nSocial  Impacts.  Some  31%  of  Nepal\u2019s  population  still  lives  below  the  poverty  line. \nPoverty  declined  from  42%  to  31%  from  FY1996  to  FY2004,  but  with  increasing  regional \ndisparity and unequal distribution among different population, caste, and ethnic groups. Poverty \nlevels are still high in the remote mid-western (45%) and far western regions (41%), compared \nwith  27%  in  western  and  central  regions  and  29%  in  the  eastern  region.  The  Koshi  flood-\naffected  district  Sunsari  covered  under  the  Project  is  in  the  eastern  region.  The  other  two \ndistricts  are  located  in  the  far  western  region.  In  a  national  human  poverty  index  ranking, \nSunsari is 8th out of 75 districts, Kanchanpur is 15th, and Kailali is in 24th place.2  \n\n                                                 \n2  The human poverty index seeks to measure the degree of deprivation in these areas by examining five attributes of \n\npoverty: illiteracy, malnutrition among children, early death, poor health care, and poor access to safe water. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n11. \nIn  Kailali  and  Kanchanpur,  7,000  families  of  the  displaced  were  living  near  rivers.  The \nmost affected people were Mukta Kamaiya (freed bonded labors) and marginalized indigenous \npeople.  Shreepur,  Haripur,  Laukahi,  and  Paschim  Kusaha  village  development  committees \nVDCs  (village  development  committees)  of  Sunsari  were  severely  hit.  Disadvantaged  group \nmapping\u2014based on food sufficiency, access to health and education, prevalence of vulnerable \nand  marginalized  groups\u2014shows  Shreepur  VDC  as  the  most  disadvantaged  followed  by \nHaripur, Pashim Kusaha, and Laukahi.  \n \n12. \nIt is estimated that 40% of people displaced by the Koshi flood will not be able to return \nhome  without  a  resettlement  plan.  More  than  35,000  farm  households  have  been  adversely \naffected  in  the  three  districts,  directly  increasing  risks  in  people\u2019s  long-term  livelihoods.  In \nSunsari, people who lost houses and could not return home have become unemployed because \nof  the  heavy  sand  siltation  in  their  farmland  and  loss  of  property.  This  situation  is  worst  in \nShreepur  VDC  as  80%  of  VDC  land  has  been  covered  by  sand.  The  flood  affected  both  poor \nand  nonpoor  households,  and  farmers  with  both  small  and  large  land  holdings.  However,  the \npoorest,  landless,  and  marginalized  were  hardest  hit  and  suffer  higher  threats  to  likely  food \ninsecurity,  diseases,  unemployment,  loss  of  income,  and  personal  security.  Women,  children, \nand the elderly have been negatively affected in terms of health, nutrition, and personal security.  \n \n13.  Macroeconomic  Impacts.  The  floods  have  had  a  devastating  impact  on  local  people, \nespecially in the Koshi area, disrupting livelihoods and household incomes\u2014especially of those \nwho suffered loss of their standing crops estimated at $18.7 million and livestock estimated at \n$2.1  million.  The  floods  have  also  had  a  negative  impact  on  manufacturing  and  transport \nactivities in eastern Nepal as the East\u2013West Highway was damaged, cutting off the region from \nthe  rest  of  the  country.  However,  although  these  impacts  are  quite  significant  from  the  local \nperspective,  they  are  assessed  moderate  in  the  national  context,  reducing  the  Government's \n7.0% gross domestic product growth target for FY2009 by 0.3 percentage points.   \n \nThe  floods  will  also  have  fiscal  implications.  Although  the  FY2009  budget  has \n14. \nprovisioned  NRs2.5  billion \nreconstruction \nexpenditures,  it  remains  unfunded.  Further,  additional  relief  expenditures  can  be  expected \nbecause  of  the  slower-than-expected  resettlement  of  the  flood-affected  people.  The  additional \nexpenditure will add 0.2 percentage points to the 3.3% of gross domestic product budget deficit \nestimated for FY2009 budget because of the unfunded budgetary provision and the additional \nfunds for an extended resettlement period.  \n \n15. \nThe floods caused temporary shortage and price hikes of food and other commodities in \nthe flood-affected areas, especially in the eastern region. However, the impact on the national \ninflation is expected to be minimal given the small production loss relative to national output and \ndemand, the reasonably good summer crop harvest across the country, and supply alternatives \nfrom  India. While  overall  inflation  has  been  rising  in  recent  months,  it  is  not  attributable  to  the \nfloods.  Inflation  was  already  on  the  rise  even  before  the  floods  (since  July  2008)  because  of \nrising  international  oil  and  food  prices.  However,  although  international  prices  and  India\u2019s \ninflation  (to  which  Nepal\u2019s  inflation  is  closely  linked)  have  declined  in  recent  months,  Nepal\u2019s \ninflation has risen on a year-on-year basis to mid-January 2009 compared to 5.8% in 2008. This \nis  mainly  due  to  high  transportation  costs  and  acute  power  shortages,  causing  some  supply \nconstraints, and the delayed impact of falling inflation in India. Inflation is, however, expected to \nsubside to reach an average of 10% for FY2009, higher than the Government\u2019s initial target of \n7.5%.  \n \n\nrehabilitation,  and \n\nflood-related \n\nrelief, \n\nfor \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nEnvironmental  Impacts.  When  the  Koshi  River  changed  its  course  toward  the  east, \n16. \nbreaching  1.7  km  of  its  left  embankment,  it  deposited  silt  on  the  flood-affected  area  and \nadjoining four VDCs (Lauki, Pashim Kushaha, Madhuban, and Shreepur), covering 5,282 ha of \nland. In the far western region, major rivers such as the Mahakali, Shihali Nala, Dhodhara, and \nBanara  carried  sediment  loads  from  catchments,  contributing  to  river  bank  erosion,  notably \ninside  Sukhaphat  Wildlife  Reserve  by  the  Mahakali  River  at  Simla  Phat  and  Barkaula  Post. \nWaterlogging  caused  loss  of  vegetation  on  farmlands  and  recharged  the  groundwater  table  in \nvarying depths. \n \n17. \nThe floods and landslides have drastically affected habitats of wildlife, aquatic, flora, and \nfauna  of  the  Koshi  Tappu  Wildlife  Reserve  in  Sunasari  and  Sukhaphat  wildlife  reserve  in \nKanchanpur. After the floods and landslides, displaced people (including migrants from the hilly \nregions)  have  begun  encroachment  in  the  forest  for  natural  resources  and  livelihood.  The \nestimated forest encroachment in Kailali district is about 1,000 ha.3 The poor living environment, \nincluding  health,  sanitation,  and  safety  issues  of  the  displaced  people  in  this  area,  were \nobserved.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImmediate Relief and Recovery \n\n18. \nThe  Government.  The  response  of  the  Government  and  development  partners  was \nquick  and  efficient  in  Sunsari  and  Saptari  as  well  as  the  far  western  region.  The  DDRC  in \nSunsari  district  was  already  holding  an  emergency  meeting  hours  before  the  river  broke  the \nembankment  and  many  people  living  beside  the  embankment  on  18  August  2008 had  started \nmoving out when the river entered the villages. The displaced people moved to nearby schools \nfor safety, and several camps were built in safer areas. A total of 328 shelters were built in the \nJhumka  camp,  followed  by  245  shelters  in  the  Lauki  camp.  Additional  shelters  were \nsubsequently  built  in  other  places.  The  DDRC  promptly  started  delivering  food  and  nonfood \nitems donated by the humanitarian agencies.  \n \n19. \nIn the far western region, several temporary camps were established following the floods \nof  20  September  2008.  Nepal  Army,  Nepal  Police,  Armed  Police  Force,  People\u2019s  Liberation \nArmy,  and  locals  were  widely  mobilized  in  the  rescue  operations.  DDRCs  in  Kailali  and \nKanchanpur districts took the lead in the relief effort. From the central level, the Central Natural \nDisaster Relief Committee (CNDRC) decided on 21 September 2008 to deploy two Nepal Army \nhelicopters  in  the  rescue  operation.  In  the  initial  phase,  food  items  were  distributed  by  Nepal \nRed Cross Society (NRCS) to the displaced people living in camps and local schools.   \n \n20. \nThe Government continues to lead response operations in Sunsari and Saptari districts \nthrough DDRCs and CDOs by coordinating between local authorities and the line ministries. On \n4 September 2008, the Government declared a State of Emergency in 10 VDCs in Sunsari and \n1 VDC in Saptari, making it easier for CDOs to take prompt actions as needed. At the regional \nlevel,  the  Saptakoshi  Disaster  Management  Coordination  Cell  was  established  to  monitor  and \ndirect  the  DDRCs.  At  the  central  level,  CNDRC,  chaired  by  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs, \noversaw the response effort and prepared the return strategy plan for the Koshi flood-displaced \npeople in December 2008 (Supplementary Appendix I).  \n \n21. \nDDRCs  are  also  the  lead  agencies  in  rescue  and  relief  operations  in  the  far  western \nregion,  supported  mainly  by  NRCS.  DDRCs  distributed  food  items  for  the  initial  15  days \nfollowing  the  floods.  The  United  Nations  (UN)  World  Food  Programme  (WFP)  has  been \n\n                                                 \n3   Livelihood DFO Report, 2008 \n\n \n\n\fthe  Children);  protection  (Office  of \n\nproviding  food  since  then.  Local  governments  constructed  roads  in  certain  affected  areas  for \nimmediate use, and connected damaged transmission lines and telecommunication facilities.  \n \n22. \nOn the budgetary front, the Government has earmarked NRs2 billion for rehabilitation of \nthe Koshi flood victims. It has also decided to allocate NRs5 million for Kailali; NRs1.5 million for \nAchham;  NRs1  million  for  Dadeldhura;  and  NRs0.5  million  for  Doti,  Bajhang,  and  Bardiya. \nDonations  from  individuals  and  private  organizations  were  collected  through  the  Prime \nMinister\u2019s Flood Relief Fund.   \n \n23. \nGovernment  of  India. The Government of India, which is responsible for maintenance \nof  the  Koshi  barrage  and  embankment  under  the  Koshi  Project  Agreement,  responded  by \nproviding  NRs320  million  as  immediate  relief  to  flood-affected  people  in  Saptari  and  Sunsari \ndistricts.  In  addition,  the  Government  of  India  agreed  to  rebuild  a  damaged  segment  of  the \nEast\u2013West  Highway  and  rehabilitate  the  damaged  embankment  by  March  2009.  The \nGovernment  of  India  mobilized  a  contractor  to  divert  water  flow  and  restore  the  embankment. \nThe breached embankment is expected to be rehabilitated by the end of March 2009.    \n \n24. \nDevelopment  Partners. The work of the international humanitarian community in  both \nregions  is  being  coordinated  through  a  cluster  system  formalized  on  9  September  2008. \nClusters have been established for health (World Health Organization [WHO]); nutrition (United \nNations Children's Fund [UNICEF]); water, sanitation, and hygiene (UNICEF); food assistance \n(WFP);  education  (UNICEF  and  Save \nthe  High \nCommissioner  for  Human  Rights)  with  a  subgroup  on  child  protection  (UNICEF);  camp \ncoordination  and  camp  management  (International  Organization  of  Migration);  and  emergency \nshelter (International Federation of Red Cross). The clusters coordinated by the United Nations \nOffice  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  responded  to  the  needs  of  flood-affected \npeople  as  shown  in  Appendix  3.  The  World  Bank  funded  two  barges  to  provide  temporary \ntransport to cross the Koshi River.  \n  \n25. \nIn Sunsari and Saptari, WFP has been providing food items and will continue to do so \nuntil  June  2009.  In  Kailali,  development  partners  distributed  1,877  nonfood  Item  sets  through \nNRCS, while 1,200 nonfood item sets were provided in Kanchanpur. WFP has been providing \nfood  items  (such  as  rice,  lentils,  cooking  oil,  and  salt)  after  the  initial  15  days  that  the \nGovernment provided those materials. \n  \n26. \nNational  and  local  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  NRCS  are  playing  a \ncritical role in the immediate response in Sunsari and Saptari districts, working closely with UN \nagencies.  The  role  of  NRCS  has  largely  been  to  facilitate  the  distribution  of  relief  materials \nobtained from government agencies and development partners. NRCS is also playing a critical \nrole  in  the  far  western  region,  collecting  and  providing  nonfood  items.  In  both  Kailali  and \nKanchanpur,  affected  persons  expressed  gratitude  to  NRCS  for  its  promptness  in  delivering \nservices.  \n \n27. \nADB.  The  response  of  ADB  to  the  2008  floods  was  prompt.  Upon  the  Government's \nrequest  to  lead  the  floods  damage  and  needs  assessment  mission  in  consultation  with  other \ndevelopment partners, an assessment mission was undertaken from 31 October to 9 November \n2008.  The  mission  held  an  inception  meeting  at  MOF,  chaired  by  the  secretary,  which  further \ndiscussed the scope of the mission, its field visit schedule, the methodology of the damage and \nneeds assessment, and the Government\u2019s support for the mission. The mission first visited the \nflood-affected  Sunsari  district  in  the  eastern  region  and  held  discussions  with  the  Sunari  and \nSaptari CDOs, district-based sector line agencies, local NGOs, development partners, and local \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ncommunities.  It  also  visited  Kailali  and  Kanchanpur  in  the  far  western  region  and  held \ndiscussions  with  CDOs,  district-based  sector  line  agencies,  NGOs,  and  local  communities. \nDuring the field visits, the mission members collected damage information and verified damages \nby  visiting  sample  sites.  Based  on  the  mission\u2019s  final  report,  on  22  December  2008,  the \nGovernment  requested  ADB  to  prepare  an  Emergency  Flood  Damage  Rehabilitation  Project. \nADB  fielded  a  fact-finding  mission  for  the  proposed  project  from  12  to  28  January  2009.  In \naddition, ADB approved the Government\u2019s requests for providing livestock inputs for the flood-\naffected  people  from  the  ongoing  Community  Livestock  Development  Project 4  and  for \nrehabilitation  of  damaged  local  roads  and  community  infrastructure,  including  school  buildings \nand  health  clinics,  under  the  ongoing  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Sector \nDevelopment Program and Project.5      \n \nCurrent Status. Although the Government, Government of India, development partners, \n28. \nUN  agencies,  and  national  and  international  NGOs  provided  an  immediate  response  for \nhumanitarian relief to the flood-affected people, they remain displaced. The Koshi river flow was \ndiverted to the original river course in late January 2009, 6 months after the flood. The repair of \nthe breached embankment is still ongoing and is expected to be completed in March 2009. The \nGovernment  expects  about  36,000  people  to  return  to  their  homes  by  March 2009  and  about \n9,000 people to return by June 2009. However, about 15,000 landless people are waiting for the \nGovernment\u2019s  plan  to  resettle  them.  To  facilitate  transportation,  the  Government  installed  two \nferries  with  limited  capacity  at  Chatara  ferry  site,  but  they  are  only  operational  during  the  dry \nseason.  The  affected  people  believe  that  the  whole  embankment  remains  vulnerable  to  be \nbreached by similar floods in the future. \n \n\n3.  \n\nFinancing Needs for Disaster Damage Rehabilitation \n\n29. \n Preliminary  estimates  indicate  that  direct  damage  to  assets  and  indirect  losses  in  the \nthree districts in the eastern and far western regions amount to $87.73 million. About one-third \nof this was direct damage and two-thirds indirect losses. \n \n30. \nDamage and losses were concentrated in the transport sector ($36.9 million or 42% of \nthe total), agriculture and livestock sector ($22.9 million or 26% of the total), and housing and \nsettlement  sector  ($9.7  million  or  11%).  The  high  damage  in  the  transport  sector  is  due  to \nextensive damage of about 14 km of road along the East\u2013West Highway from a breach in the \neastern embankment of the Koshi River, which contributed to high indirect losses, mainly from \ndisruption of transportation of goods and services. \n \n31. \nThe financial requirement for the recovery program has been identified at $71.20 million \nbased on the damage and needs assessment. A total of $24.01 million is required for short-term \nneeds,  and  the  remaining  $47.19  million  is  needed  for  the  medium  term.  The  Government  is \nalready  financing  the  short-term  need  of  about  $7.00  million  ($3.52  million  in  transport, \n$2.00 million  in  agriculture,  $0.84  million  in  communication,  and  $0.53  million  in  local \ninfrastructure  and  others).  The  Government  of  India  also  committed  $5.27  million  for \nrehabilitation  of  the  breached  embankment.  A  shortfall  of  $11.74  million  in  short-term  need \nrequires  financial  support.  In  the  medium  term,  the  shortfall  is  $43.67  million  and  requires \nfinancial assistance as the Government provided $3.52 million for the roads sector.  \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nKingdom of Nepal for the Community Livestock Development Project. Manila. \n\n5   ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nKingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Sector  Development  Program  and  Project. \nManila. \n\n\f4. \n\nRehabilitation Assistance Program \n\n32. \nAn  integrated,  multipronged  approach  for  economic  recovery  of  the  affected  area,  and \nfor reconstruction of destroyed physical assets, is required to ensure the protection of the most \nvulnerable  members  of  society  and  to  resume  socioeconomic  development  in  the  affected \nregions.  The  Government  requested  ADB  to  prepare  the  medium-term  recovery  program  for \nsustainable  production  in  agriculture,  and  reconstruction  of  infrastructure  with  improved  risk \nresistance capacity in roads, water supply and sanitation, and irrigation. \n  \n33. \nADB  Strategy. ADB has an integrated policy for managing its disaster and emergency \nassistance,  which  links  the  phases  of  the  disaster  management  cycle,  from  prevention  and \nmitigation through preparedness and recovery. The policy emphasizes not only responding after \nthe disaster strikes, but also supporting activities that anticipate and mitigate the likely impact of \ndisasters that might occur. However, ADB\u2019s mandate does not allow the institution to engage in \nhumanitarian  relief  as  other  international  aid  agencies,  NGOs,  and  the  UN  normally  assume \nthese functions. ADB\u2019s disaster and emergency assistance activities will be implemented within \nthe context of working more closely with the Government to help it adopt a new approach that \nemphasizes preventive measures. ADB\u2019s assistance instruments are portfolio restructuring and \nuse  of  loan  savings  and  emergency  assistance  projects.  Based  on  the  policy,  the  recovery \nproject will also emphasize preventive measures to minimize the impact of future floods.     \n \n34. \nPortfolio  Management  and  Restructuring.  In  formulating  ADB\u2019s  flood  recovery \nassistance  project,  government  capacity,  the  possibility  for  loan  portfolio  restructuring,  and \npotential use of loan savings under ongoing projects were carefully assessed in line with ADB\u2019s \nDisaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004).6 The portfolio assessment was made in light \nof  the  2008  country  portfolio  review,7 and  in  close  coordination  with  concerned  government \nagencies.  Since  2006,  ADB  has  placed  particular  emphasis  on  regularly  identifying  and \ncanceling  Asian  Development  Fund  loan  savings  by  examining  the  physical  and  financial \nprogress  of  ongoing  projects  and  adjusting  their  scope  and  design.  Thus,  the  scope  for \nidentifying  additional  loan  savings  by  restructuring  the  existing  Asian  Development  Fund  loan \nportfolio  is  limited.  Nonetheless,  savings  identified  under  four  projects,  amounting  to  $5.60 \nmillion, were canceled for utilization under the Nepal country program allocation. \n  \n35. \nCoordination in Recovery Program. While the Government has approved several acts \non  good  governance  in  recent  years\u2014including  the  Public  Procurement  Act  and  Regulations, \n2007;  Financial  Procedures  Rules,  2007;  and  Local  Body  Financial  Administration  Rules, \n2007\u2014lack of coordination, efficiency, and accountability in central and local governments was \nidentified as a major challenge in delivering humanitarian relief and an early recovery program. \nThe  UN  agencies  provide  all  technical  support  to  the  local  governments  and  supported  the \nCNDRC in coordinating cluster programs.  \n \n36. \nPromoting  local  service  delivery  and  active  participation  of  key  stakeholders  could \nimprove  coordination  in  disaster  recovery  activities  and  deliver  quick  and  tangible  benefits.  A \ncommunity-driven  development  approach  for  all  Koshi  flood-related  activities  has  been \nintroduced  in  Sunsari  district  through  the  relief  and  rehabilitation  program  implementation  unit \nestablished  under  the  district  office.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP) \nsupports district development committees and VDCs by providing adequate staff resources for \nstrengthening the RRU and better coordination among service providers so that early recovery \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2004.

Although  Nepal  has  a \nNational Disaster Relief Act, 1982, its regulations need to be developed to improve coordination \namong the agencies dealing with disaster management. UNDP plans to prepare the regulations, \nwhich  will  be  assisted  by  the  proposed  Project.  In  addition,  disaster  preparedness  and \nemergency  management  cannot  solely  depend  on  experts  in  these  fields  as  the  frequency  of \ndisasters is high and locations are scattered. Making the public aware of possible hazards and \nusing their participation in an early warning system becomes very important in fighting against \ndisasters. Public awareness programs and awareness sessions in the school curriculum need to \nbe introduced. In addition, ADB is planning to undertake a disaster vulnerability assessment as \npreparation  for  the  new  country  partnership  strategy,  which  will  provide  recommendations  for \nrisk mitigation measures in future ADB operations. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n38. \nThe objective of the Project is to restore quickly economic activities mainly in the three \ndistricts\u2014Kailali,  Kanchanpur,  and  Sunsari  districts\u2014and  improve  the  livelihood  of  about \n300,000 people seriously affected by the 2008 monsoon floods. It will contribute to sustainable \neconomic growth by minimizing the devastating impact of the floods and reduce future risk for \nsimilar disasters. The Project will focus on augmenting incomes and self-reliance through (i) the \nrevival  of  agriculture  in  the  affected  farmland  and  restoration  of  livelihoods  of  the  affected \npeople, and (ii) the rehabilitation of infrastructure. The Project supports capacity building and the \nGovernment\u2019s  disaster  preparedness  by  developing  a  flood  forecasting  system  and  early \nwarning system in the Koshi river area.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n39. \nThe  Project  comprises  five  parts:  agriculture  (A),  irrigation  (B),  water  supply  and \nsanitation (C), roads (D), and project management (E). The Project will strengthen partnerships \nand synergies with other development partners. \n  \n40.   Part A: Agriculture. This part will help restore the livelihoods of affected people through \nrevival of agriculture by distributing seeds and compost to grow crops suitable for sandy soil in \nthe affected area, as well as basic farm equipment. The distribution of the agriculture inputs will \nbe  provided  to  farm  families  whose  lands  have  limited  silt  deposit  or  have  cleared  high  silt \ndeposit by themselves. This will be supported by extension services, skills development training \nfor farming on sandy soil, and social mobilization. This part will also rehabilitate fishponds and \nminor irrigation, distribute fingerlings, and reconstruct agriculture collection centers and market \nplaces in the affected area. Training and material support will be provided to improve the quality \nof  soil,  crop,  and  water  management.  Combined  with  the  irrigation  component,  about  8,500 \nfamilies  comprising  42,500  people  are  estimated  to  benefit  directly.  Detailed  project  activities \nare in Appendix 4.    \n \n41. \nPart  B:  Irrigation.  This part will reconstruct and rehabilitate the damaged structures of \n2 large and 25 small surface irrigation systems. This will involve improvement of 25 head works; \n127  km  of  main,  branch,  and  tertiary  canals;  196  canal  structures  such  as  drains,  aqueducts,  \ngates,  outlets,  and  inlets;  36  km  of  canal  service  roads;  45  culverts  and  small  bridges; \n1 medium-sized  bridge  (on  canal  service  road);  and  necessary  protection  works  for  the  above \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fstructures.  This  part  will  also  include  rehabilitation  of  700  shallow  tube  wells  and  a \nsupplementary  surface  irrigation  system,  which  will  provide  irrigation  to  13,060  ha  of  land. \nDetailed project activities are in Appendix 5.   \n \nPart  C:  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  The expected benefits of this part are hygiene \n42. \nimprovements in the flood-affected areas, reduced pollution of groundwater and surface water, \nand access to drinking water. This part will rehabilitate 28 gravity flow water supply systems in \nKailali and Kanchanur, and construct 4 small overhead water supply systems and install 3,500 \nshallow  tube  wells  in  Sunsari  to  provide  access  to  drinking  water  and  sanitation  facilities.  For \nSunsari  district,  this  part  is  designed  to  complement  the  Government\u2019s  return  package  for \nreturnees  to  meet  needs  for  drinking  water  and  sanitation  facilities.8 Social  mobilization  for  a \nhealth and hygiene education and awareness program is integral to this part. The gravity flow \nwater  supply  system  and  small  overhead  water  supply  systems  will  be  designed  to  give  the \ndisadvantaged and poor adequate access to drinking water and sanitation, and will be operated \nand maintained by the respective communities. Detailed project activities are in Appendix 6.   \n \nPart D: Roads. This part comprises rehabilitation of damaged strategic roads in the far \n43. \nwest region, including protection works for bridge and culvert and landslide stabilization works. \nIn  the  Koshi  area,  all  damaged  local  roads  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment  will  be  rehabilitated  under  the  ongoing  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation \nSector Development Project financed by ADB at a cost of $4 million. Major works in the Koshi \narea  under  the  Project  will  focus  on  providing  an  alternative  access  road  for  strategic  road \nnetworks  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW)  for \nemergency  preparedness,  with  the  aim  of  minimizing  the  damaging  effect  of  similar  potential \nfloods  in  the  entire  eastern  region  of  the  country.  As  the  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  is \noperating two ferries to cross the Koshi River with limited capacity, the Government requested \nADB  to  substitute  them  with  a  permanent  bridge  over  the  Koshi  River  at  Chatara.  The \npermanent bridge would provide a reliable alternative transport route, linking the eastern part of \nthe  country  with  the  western  part,  and  preventing  possible negative  impacts  in  case  of  similar \nfloods  in  the  future.  This  conforms  with  the  damage  and  needs  assessment  report  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  recovery  strategy.  DOR  assured  MOF  that  construction  of  the  proposed  bridge \nwould be completed within 3 years. Detailed project activities are in Appendix 7.   \n \n44. \nPart  E:  Project  Management.  To ensure efficient implementation and management of \nproject activities, a new project coordination office (PCO) with adequate staff from the Executing \nAgency  (EA)  will  be  supported  by  consulting  services  and  required  logistics.  Individual \nconsultants will be engaged to support project supervision and monitoring, and capacity building \nfor  preparing  the  strategies  and  actions  needed  to  prevent  and  mitigate  future  floods  in  the \nproject  districts.  A  capacity-building  program  for  DWIDP  will  be  undertaken  (Supplementary \nAppendix B). A series of socioeconomic studies that focus on evaluation of the Project\u2019s impact \non poverty reduction will be carried out, including a benchmark study at the start of the Project, \na follow-up study in the third year, and a final study at the end of project implementation. \n \nC. \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\n45. \nImproved  Livelihoods  of  the  Affected  People. The Project will lead to restoration of \nincomes for 11,700 affected families: 7,700 families through agricultural input supports and an \nadditional 4,000 families through reconstructed irrigation schemes. Through the rehabilitation of \n                                                 \n8  Return  package  designed  to  support  initial  return  of  displaced  people  together  with  additional  inputs  from \nGovernment  and  other  humanitarian  agencies.  Each  household  is  to  be  provided  with  the  return  package  of \nNRs50,000 in installments basis. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fsurface irrigation, the provision of shallow tube wells for irrigating uneven farmlands, extension \nservices  for  crops  suitable  for  sandy  soils  and  input  supply  for  their  start-up,  and  the \nrehabilitation  of  fishponds,  the  incomes  of  families  are  expected  to  increase  by  NRs1,300  per \nfamily within 3 years. Much of the agricultural support will be geared to obtaining incomes from \nland that has been heavily silted and that now requires different technologies to provide farming \nincomes.  In  addition  to  project  activities,  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects\u2014the  Community \nLivestock  Development  Project  and  the  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Sector \nDevelopment Project\u2014will improve the livelihoods of affected people by providing livestock for \nthe  disadvantaged  group,  and  rehabilitating  rural  roads  and  community  infrastructure  in  the \naffected areas.   \n \n46. \nDisaster Preparedness. As it is the ADB's first disaster rehabilitation project for Nepal, \nthe Project will initiate activities related to disaster preparedness. The PCO under the direction \nof  the  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  analyze  lessons  learned  from  past  floods  and, \nthrough a consultative process, draw up strategies and actions needed to prevent and mitigate \nfuture floods. The strategies and actions will be incorporated in a disaster preparedness action \nplan.  ADB\u2019s  disaster  vulnerability  assessment  for  the  new  country  partnership  strategy  will \nstrengthen the capacity of the Government's disaster preparedness and early warning system. \nTraining will be provided to staff of the flood related agencies to improve flood awareness and \npreparedness. Civil works envisaged under the Project will provide greater flood protection for \nroads,  bridges,  and  irrigation  works;  and  the  construction  of  an  alternative  route  to  the  East\u2013\nWest  Highway  through  Chatara  will  provide  a  fail-safe  east\u2013west  transport  link  to  prepare  for \nfuture floods in the Koshi River.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n47. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $32.00 million, including taxes and duties of \n$3.19 million financed by the Government (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 8 \nand the details of the project investment plan are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\n \n  Base Costb \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na   Includes taxes and duties of $3.19 million financed by the Government. \nb  In January 2009 prices. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nPart A: Agriculture  \nPart B: Irrigation  \nPart C: Water Supply and Sanitation  \nPart D: Roads  \nPart E: Project Management  \n    Subtotal  \nContingencies \n        Total \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nAmounta \n\n  \n\n3.86 \n 8.77 \n 4.56 \n  12.10 \n1.53 \n30.82 \n1.18 \n32.00 \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $25.60  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \n48. \nresources to help finance the Project.

To support the EA, a PCO will be established at \nMPPW and will coordinate with the IAs and the line ministries, including the National Planning \nCommission.  It  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  project  coordinator.  The  PCO  will  (i)  prepare  the \noverall  project  implementation  plan  and  consolidated  annual  work  plan,  (ii)  assist  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  in  preparing  estimates  for  annual  budget  and  contract  packaging, \n(iii)  conduct  a  series  of  socioeconomic  studies,  (iv)  monitor  all  project  management  activities, \n(v) organize monitoring and evaluation of project activities, (vi) maintain proper accounting for all \nproject expenditures for auditing, (vii) manage and replenish the imprest account, (viii) prepare \nnecessary  progress  reports  and  submit  to  the  PSC  and  ADB,  and  (ix)  prepare  the  project \ncompletion report for submission to ADB. The project coordinator will be supported by a full-time \ndeputy  project  coordinator.  The  PCO  will  be  properly  staffed  and  assisted  by  consultants  with \nexpertise  in  engineering,  finance,  accounting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  project \nmanagement structure is in Appendix 9. \n \n50. \nThe  IAs  for  the  Project  will  be  as  follows:  Department  of  Agriculture  (DOA)  for  part  A \n(agriculture); Department of Irrigation (DOI) for part B (irrigation); Department of Water Supply \nand  Sewerage  (DWSS)  for  part  C  (water  supply  and  sanitation);  and  DOR  for  part  D  (roads). \nEach IA will be responsible in its respective sector for (i) preparation of the annual work plan, (ii) \ndesign  and  approval  of  civil  works,  (iii)  preparation  of  tender  documents  for  civil  works  and \ngoods and approval of respective contracts, (iv) appointment of consultants, and (v) submission \nof progress reports to the EA. A separate PIU will be established in each IA and provided with \nadequate staff, resources, and logistical support. Each PIU will be headed by a project director. \nThe  PIU  concerned  will  be  responsible  for  preparation,  submission,  approval,  implementation, \nand  benefits  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  all  subprojects.  In  each  project  district,  subproject \nimplementation units (SPIUs) for each sector will be established to implement project activities \nin the respective districts.  \n \nA PSC, chaired by the Secretary of MPPW, will be established within 1 month of grant \n51. \neffectiveness  to  provide  overall  project  coordination  and  facilitate  project  implementation.  The \nPSC  includes  representatives  from  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Cooperatives,  MOF,  Ministry  of \nHome  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  Ministry  of  Local  Development,  National  Planning \nCommission, DOA, DOI, DWSS, DWIDP, and DOR. The project coordinator will act as member \nsecretary  of  the  PSC.  ADB  may  be  invited  by  the  Government  to  attend  PSC  meetings  as  an \nobserver.  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least  six  times  in  the  first  year;  thereafter,  it  will  meet  as  and \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fwhen  needed,  but  not  less  than  three  times  a  year.  To  coordinate  planning  and  execution  of \nvarious components across the sectors, a national project management coordination committee \n(NPMCC)  will  be  established  with  representation  from  each  PIU.  The  PCO  will  coordinate \nNPMCC meetings, which will be held monthly.  \n \n52. \nIn each project district, a local project coordination committee will be established under \nthe chief district officer to coordinate project activities. Each SPIU will participate in the meetings \nof  the  existing  relief  and  rehabilitation  program  implementation  unit  to  coordinate  project \nactivities with other flood-related activities supported by the Government and other development \npartners.  The  relief  and  rehabilitation  program  implementation  unit  was  established  under  the \ncoordination of the district office in Sunsari to coordinate all Koshi flood-related activities.  \n  \nGood implementation arrangements for agricultural input distribution need to be in place \n53. \nto  implement  part  A  effectively.  Although  project  implementation  and  procurement  have  been \ndecentralized  to  district  agriculture  development  offices  (DADOs),  which  have  demonstrated \ntheir  capacity  in  procurement  and  implementation  of  field  programs.  Consultants  should  be \nmobilized in time to support DADOs in procurement of agricultural inputs and their distribution to \naffected  families  whose  lands  have  limited  silt  deposit  or  have  cleared  high  silt  deposit  by \nthemselves. Over-procurement should be avoided, but inputs should reach farm families on time \nusing  systematic  procedures.  DADOs  will  consult  closely  with  DDRCs  and  UNDP,  which  will \nprovide  adequate  staff  for  strengthening  local  government  agencies  at  districts,  villages,  and \nwards. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n54. \nAs the Project is for emergency assistance, project implementation will be substantially \ncompleted in 36 months, i.e., tentatively by 30 June 2012. Because of the inability to undertake \ncivil  works  during  the  wet  season,  and  taking  into  account  the  country\u2019s  weakened  absorptive \ncapacity  in  remote  areas,  the  project  period  is  extended  by  1  year  beyond  the  2-year  project \nperiod  generally  expected  under  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy.  A  3-year \nproject implementation period is also justified as Nepal is in a post-conflict situation. The agreed \nimplementation  schedule  recognizes  the  critical  importance  of  restoring  key  infrastructure  as \nmuch as possible before the onset of the next rainy season in July 2009. The implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n55. \nProcurement of works, goods, and services will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s procedures for providing \nrehabilitation assistance after disasters provide for flexible interpretation of these guidelines, so \nthat  project  activities  can  start  promptly.  Generally,  national  procurement  will  be  the  preferred \nmode  for  all  civil  works  because  of  the  relatively  short  implementation  period,  small  size  of \ncontract packages, wide geographic spread of the project sites, and need for local awareness \nand community participation. \n \n56. \nHowever,  procurement  of  civil  works  contracts  with  estimated  values  greater  than \n$1 million  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  international  competitive  bidding  procedures, \nand  contracts  with  estimated  values  of  $1  million  or  less  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nnational competitive bidding procedures and generally be in accordance with the Government\u2019s \nPublic Procurement Regulations; Public Procurement Act; and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nShopping will be used for works exceeding $30,000 but no more than $100,000. All small and \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fwidely  dispersed  civil  works  of  up  to  $30,000  will  be  undertaken  mainly  by  the  community, \nfollowing ADB's community participation guidelines.  \n \n57. \nADB\u2019s  portfolio  experience  in  Nepal  indicates  that  national  contractors  have  adequate \ncapacity to undertake such contracts. ADB will review and approve all contracts with estimated \nvalues exceeding $100,000 equivalent. National competitive bidding for civil works will follow the \nsingle-stage,  one-envelope  procedure  with  post-qualification  and  a  bidding  period  of  21  days. \nTo  encourage  the  participation  of  communities  and  local  residents,  especially  women,  and \nprovide  them  with  employment  opportunities,  small  earthworks  with  an  estimated  cost  of \n$30,000 or less may be awarded, in line with past practices for projects of a similar nature, to \nuser groups in accordance with community participation in procurement procedures acceptable \nto ADB. The procurement plan of the Project is in Appendix 11. \n \n58. \nAll the IAs will strictly adhere to the Public Procurement Regulations\u2019 specified time limits \nfor evaluating and awarding contracts. Contract variations will be discouraged and be subject to \nprior ADB approval, except in special circumstances for particular contracts for strong technical \nand economic reasons to maximize social and economic benefits. \n \n59. \nGiven the urgency of the Project, ADB approved advance action for the procurement of \ngoods,  services,  and  works  and  the  recruitment  of  consultants,  provided  the  advance  actions \ntake  place  on  or  after  12  January  2009,  the  starting  date  for  the  project  fact-finding.  ADB \nadvised the Government that approval of such advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nany part of the Project. \n \nThe  Project  provides  for  retroactive  financing  of  immediate  rehabilitation  of  key \n60. \ninfrastructure  and  facilities,  and  for  consulting  services.  ADB  Management  has  agreed  to \nprovide  retroactive  financing  for  a  maximum  30%  of  the  total  loan  amount  for  eligible \nexpenditures  incurred  not  earlier  than  18  August  2008  (date  of  disaster  in  Koshi  river  area). \nRetroactive  financing  will  be  approved  under  the  following  conditions:  (i)  procurement  is \nundertaken in accordance with the Government\u2019s procedures, (ii) contracts and recurrent costs \nare  certified  by  the  EA,  and  (iii)  the  certification  is  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB  advised  the \nGovernment that provision of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of \nthe Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\nGiven the tight implementation schedule, the IAs\u2019 uneven institutional capacity, and the \n61. \nneed  for  accelerated  project  implementation,  consulting  services  will  be  required  to  support \nproject  implementation.  At  the  outset  of  the  Project,  the  PCO  will  recruit  7  individual  national \nconsultants to advance project preparatory activities for a total of 98 person-months of national \nconsultants  on  an  individual  basis  for  services  in  project  management,  benefit  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  procurement, \nfinancial  management,  social  development,  resettlement,  and \nenvironment  management.  The  PCO  will  also  recruit  5  individual  consultants  to  review  the \ninstitutional  aspect  of  flood  mitigation  work  and  draw  up  the  strategies  and  actions  needed  to \nprevent  and  mitigate  future  floods,  including  8  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices of a river morphologist for 6 months and an institutional management and development \nspecialist for 2 months; and 32 person-months of national consultants, including an institutional \ndevelopment  specialist,  a  river  engineer,  and  a  river  hydrologist.  Four  design  and  supervision \nconsultant  packages,  one  firm  for  each  of  sectors,  are  included  with  a  total  of  464  person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services.  The  procurement  plan  is  in  Appendix  11and  the \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nfor \n\nindividual  subprojects; \n\nThe consultant packages for design and construction supervision of the project activities \n62. \nin  each  component  will  be  procured  using  the  consultants\u2019  qualifications  selection  method. \nSubject  to  the  Government  taking  responsibility  for  selection  and  engagement,  single  source \nselection  is  an  acceptable  selection  method  in  the  context  of  emergency  rehabilitation.  The \nconsultants  will  support  the  IAs  with  day-to-day  project  implementation,  including  (i) detailed \nassessment  and  verification  of  damage;  (ii)  preparation  of  assessment  reports  for  safeguard \nrequirements \n(iii)  preparation  of  plans,  detailed  designs, \nspecifications, and cost estimates; (iv) preparation of bid and contract documents; (v) evaluation \nof bids and contract awards; (vi) supervision of construction quality, cost and schedule control, \nmeasurement, and approval of contractors\u2019 work and progress claims; (vii) monitoring of works \nto  ensure  quality  control  and  transparency  among  contractors  and  communities  carrying  out \nsmaller works; (viii) issuance of completion certificates; and (ix) oversight of works.  \n \n63. \nThe  IA  concerned  will  sign  all  the  contracts  for  consultants,  who  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of national consultants. \nSince the Project must be completed within 36 months, expeditious selection and fielding of the \ndesign  and  construction  supervision  consultants  will  be  necessary.  Accordingly,  ADB  has \nagreed  with  the  Government  on  the  consultants\u2019  qualifications  selection  method  for  all  the \nconsulting  services  packages.  To  expedite  project  implementation,  the  Government  and  ADB \nagreed that ADB will select a consulting firm on behalf of the Government using the consultants\u2019 \nqualifications  selection  method.  Consultants\u2019  performance  will  be  closely  monitored,  with \nparticular attention to quality of work and vigilance in the field to accelerate contract execution \nfor  timely  completion,  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  contract  period.  Continuity  of  key \nconsultants  and  senior  field  engineers  should  be  strictly  adhered  to,  in  accordance  with  the \nagreed  personnel  schedule  and  work  program  in  respective  consultant  contracts.  To  expedite \nthe implementation of construction of Koshi Bridge at Chatara, ADB agreed to fund the design \nof the bridge from the ongoing Road Connectivity Sector I Project. 9 \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n64. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  grant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n65. \nThe  Project  incorporates  several  specific  anticorruption  measures,  including  (i)  strict \nfinancial  management  with  full  adherence  to  monitoring  and  reporting  systems;  (ii)  strict \ncompliance  with  Public  Procurement  Act  and  Regulations  of  2007,  and  Local  Body  Finance \nAdministration  Regulations  of  2007;  (iii)  allowing  third  party  monitoring  of  all  subprojects;  and \n(iv) random and independent spot checks of implementation by ADB and PCO.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Asian \n\nDevelopment Fund Grant to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Road Connectivity Sector I Project. Manila. \n\n\f6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n66. \nAll  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). An imprest account for the Project will be established in \nNepal Rastra Bank, the central bank. The ceiling for the imprest account is $2.5 million, which \nshould  not  exceed  estimated  eligible  expenditure  for  6  months  to  be  financed  through  the \nimprest account or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures \n(SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  advances  under  the \nimprest account. The ceiling for payment under the SOE procedure is $100,000. The EA will be \nresponsible  for  managing  and  administering  the  account  and  SOE  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n67. \nThe EA has implemented ADB projects for more than 20 years and is implementing nine \nprojects  at  present.  The  Project,  however,  includes  a  financial  management  specialist  and  a \nprocurement  specialist  in  the  PCO  to  strengthen  project  implementation  of  the  emergency \nassistance project and the capacity of the EA, and effectively oversee financial transactions. \n \n68. \nAccounts and Audit. The EA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify the goods and services financed by the loan proceeds, financing received, expenditures \nincurred,  and  use  of  local  funds.  The  account  will  be  maintained  in  accordance  with  sound \naccounting  principles.  Consolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be \naudited annually by the auditor general. The audited reports and related financial statements in \nEnglish should provide an audit opinion on the financial operations of the imprest accounts and \nSOEs and be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year because \nof project implementation in remote project areas by multiple IAs.  \n \nReports.  While  the  PCO  will  monitor  overall  implementation  progress,  the  EA  will \n69. \nprepare brief progress statements and submit these to the PSC with a copy to ADB at the end \nof each quarter. In addition, each IA will submit monthly reports to the PCO in order to enable \nthe PCO to prepare quarterly progress reports. The project performance monitoring system will \nbe established within 3 months of grant effectiveness. Within 3 months of physical completion of \nthe Project, the Government will provide ADB with a project completion report providing detailed \nevaluation of the project design, costs, performance of contractors and consultants, social and \neconomic impacts, and other details.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n70. \nThe  EA  will  establish  the  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  within \n3 months of grant effectiveness. Baseline indicators and targets for each sector and subproject \nwill be developed within 3 months of grant effectiveness prior to implementation for monitoring \npurposes.  The  data  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender,  caste,  and  ethnicity.  The  outputs  will \nprovide inputs to the Project\u2019s quarterly progress reporting for results monitoring of the design \nand monitoring framework of the Project in Appendix 1. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n71. \nADB will conduct regular reviews throughout project implementation. Given the relatively \nshort  implementation  period  and  emergency  nature  of  the  Project,  no  midterm  review  will  be \nconducted unless ADB and the Government deem it necessary. \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nBased  on  experience  from  similar  earlier  projects  providing  emergency  assistance,  the \n72. \nproject components are expected to be technically feasible and cost-effective, and represent a \nleast-cost alternative with appropriate adjustment for flood resistant designs. Analysis shows an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 16% for agriculture, 30% for irrigation, 26% for water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  24%  for  roads,  and  a  project  EIRR  of  25%.  These  calculations  include \nproject  implementation  expenses  for  each  component  and  expenses  to  ensure  proper \nmaintenance of rehabilitated infrastructure. Project-financed restoration will bring infrastructure \nback to original productivity and efficiency. Benefits calculated for agriculture for damaged land \nareas  are  based  on  a  changed  use  of  land.  While  most  restoration  works  will  aim  to  meet \nimmediate  emergency  needs,  restoration  of  permanent  structures  will  improve  their  ability  to \nwithstand future floods.  \n \nThrough the displacement of families and lowered production on farmland, it is estimated \n73. \nthat  4,870  persons  have  become  unemployed\u201432%  of  the  original  workforce  on  the  affected \nland. The civil works programs envisaged under the Project will provide work for up to 60% of \nthe  unemployed.  Within  1  year  of  project  completion,  it  is  expected  that  economic  production \nand  employment  will  have  returned  to  pre-flood  levels.  A  summary  of  economic  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 12 and detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty and Social Impacts \n\nPoverty  Impact.  The  project  design  includes  features  that  will  help  reduce  poverty \n74. \ndirectly  or  indirectly.  It  will  provide  short-term  employment  to  poor  women  and  men  in  skilled \nand unskilled labor-intensive construction works, in rehabilitation of damaged road and irrigation \ninfrastructures.  All  sectoral  support  will  have  poverty  implications  by  rehabilitating  damaged \ninfrastructure  and  farmland,  and  improving  services.  The  support  will  help  people  directly  or \nindirectly  to  mitigate  risks  of  likely  impoverishment.  A  summary  of  the  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy in Appendix 13. \n \nSocial  Impact.  The  project  components  in  four  major  sectors\u2014roads,  irrigation \n75. \ninfrastructure, agriculture, and water and sanitation\u2014will contribute to reducing the vulnerability \nand  risks  of  the  affected  people,  displaced,  poor,  and  disadvantaged.  Social  mobilization \nactivities will be integrated, which will improve the group organization and management capacity \nof  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  in  reconstruction  of  damaged  irrigation  and  water  supply \ninfrastructures,  empowering  them  to  access  services.  Gender  and  social  inclusion  guidelines \nand a detailed action plan will be developed based on the gender equality and social inclusion \naction plan (Supplementary Appendix J) to ensure benefits to women and marginalized groups. \n \n76. \nAgriculture support will be provided to the poor and affected farmers free of cost for up to \n2  years  so  that  they  will  be  able  to  restore  farm  work  and  income.  Irrigation  measures  will  be \ntaken  to  cope  with  the  immediate  need  for  restoring  the  land  and  to  support  livelihoods  by \nproviding shallow tube wells, which will benefit the poor and marginal farmers. Rehabilitation of \nfarmer-managed  irrigation  facilities  and  large  irrigation  schemes  will  help  regain  long-term \nsustainability of the agriculture production, providing benefits to all users. \n \n77.  Water  supply  and  sanitation  activities  will  rehabilitate  damaged  schemes  by  improving \nquality, and extend the services to the poor and marginalized groups. Access to drinking water \nand sanitation will help women and poor households save time for other economic activities and \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\freduce  their  work  burden.  In  all  four  affected  VDCs  in  Sunsari,  a  water  supply  service  will  be \nprovided through a phased approach, which will complement the Government\u2019s return package. \nSocial  mobilization  will  be  integrated  in  the  component  to  ensure  social  inclusion  in  user \ncommittees in terms of gender, caste, ethnicity, and other disadvantaged groups.  \n \n78. \nConstruction  of  a  permanent  bridge  on  the  Koshi  River  and  rehabilitation  of  strategic \nroads will contribute to transportation of goods and services to the market, creating employment \nopportunities for the poor.  \n \n79. \nEmployment  Generation. Rehabilitation of the highway and rural roads will contribute \nto smooth transportation of goods and services to the market and facilitate economic activities, \ncreating employment opportunities for the poor. Support for income-generation activities will be \nextended to the landless and poor farmers based on their demand. \n \nC. \n\nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n\nThe  Project  involves  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  infrastructure  such  as  roads, \n80. \nirrigation,  water  supply,  and  other  small  agricultural  infrastructure.  While  most  rehabilitation \nworks  are  expected  to  be  limited  within  their  existing  corridor  of  impacts,  some  may  require \nadditional  land  and/or  involve  resettlement  impacts.  The  improvement  of  roads,  additional \nstructures  for  protection  of  roads/bridges,  realignment  of  roads  and  irrigation  canals,  and \nconstruction  of  overhead  water  supply  reservoirs  may  need  additional  land  and  cause \nresettlement impacts.  \n \nA  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared,  providing  policy  and  procedures  to \n81. \nscreen, assess, and plan for land acquisition and resettlement aspects of project components in \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  An  involuntary  resettlement \nframework  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  resettlement  framework  includes  an \nentitlement matrix covering all potential losses, and provides compensation at replacement cost \nand rehabilitation support for affected people. If project components involve any land acquisition \nand resettlement impacts, a resettlement plan will be prepared based on the detailed design of \nthe  project  infrastructure  during  implementation.  The  resettlement  plans  will  be  developed  in \nconsultation  with  affected  people,  publicly  disclosed  to  affected  people,  submitted  for  ADB\u2019s \napproval,  and  posted  on  the  websites  of  ADB  and  the  EA.  The  resettlement  plans  will  outline \ndetailed arrangements for their implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and grievance redress. \nThe compensation for land acquisition and resettlement will be completed before award of the \ncivil  works  contracts,  while  other  rehabilitation  and  income-generation  activities  may  continue \nduring  project  construction.  The  EA  will  provide  semiannual  progress  reports  to  ADB  on  the \nimplementation of the resettlement framework/resettlement plan(s), which will also be posted on \nthe EA and ADB websites.  \n \nThe  IAs  will  assign  a  senior  government  official  as  a  resettlement  officer  and  recruit  a \n82. \nresettlement  consultant \nin  overall  coordination,  planning,  and  monitoring  of \nresettlement  aspects  under  their  respective  sectors.  The  design  consultants  will  include \nnecessary  social  and  land  survey  staff  for  social  assessment  and  preparation  of  resettlement \nplans, as appropriate. The IAs assisted by the consultant will screen, assess, plan, implement, \nand monitor any resettlement impacts of project activities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  and  the  resettlement  framework  for  the  Project.  The  IAs  will  review  and \nendorse  relevant  resettlement  plans  and  reports  before  their  submission  to  ADB  for  approval. \nThe EA and IAs will ensure timely availability of budget for land compensation and resettlement \nactivities.  \n\nto  assist \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n83. \nThe Project involves rehabilitation and reconstruction works, whose scope requires only \ninitial environmental examination (IEE). Although the Project will construct a bridge 330 meters \nlong at an estimated cost of $7.0 million, the Project is classified category B in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the  existing  laws  of  the  Government,  including  the \nEnvironmental  Protection  Act,  1997,  and  Environmental  Protection  Rules,  1997.  The  Project\u2019s \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure and a summary IEE will identify the degree of \nlikely impacts and describe possible mitigation measures. The field visits verify that the Project \nconforms with the above criteria. The Government endorsed the summary IEE and resettlement \nframework,  and  uploaded  them  to  their  website  for  public  disclosure.  Sample  IEE  for  new \nconstruction of a 330-meter long bridge at Chatara is under preparation. \n \nAll  subprojects  will  be  required  to  complete  and  satisfy  an  environmental  assessment \n84. \nscreening  checklist  during \nrequirements. \nRecommended  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  the  subproject  design  and  work \nassignment (such as the bill of quantities, specifications, and contract document).  \n \nApart  from  minor  impacts,  the  Project  is  expected  to  have  several  environmental \n85. \nbenefits, \nfailure  of  embankments  along  damaged \ninfrastructure,  reducing  health  risks  by  rehabilitating  damaged  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacilities,  cleaning  drainage  systems,  and  reconstruction  of  damaged  irrigation  facilities  to \nbolster  both  the  irrigation  and  agriculture  sectors.  The  EA  is  familiar  with  the  environmental \nguidelines  and  procedures  of  ADB  and  the  Government.  Summary  IEE  and  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedures  are  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  G  and  H  to  guide \nsubproject  implementation  and  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental requirements. \n \nE. \n\nformulation,  and  will  have \n\nland  erosion  and \n\nto  satisfy \n\nincluding \n\nlimiting \n\nRisks \n\nIEE \n\n86. \nAccording to the Government\u2019s return strategy plan for Koshi flood-displaced people, the \nGovernment  assumes  that  60%  of  currently  affected  people  will  return  immediately  with  the \nreturn package and 15% will return within 6 months because of high-level damage to their home \nand farmlands. These people will be provided with employment opportunities from ongoing ADB \nprojects and rehabilitation projects. However, about 25% of the people have little prospect of an \nimmediate return to their previous area since deep siltation and deep water have prevented their \nland from being recovered, and some are landless people. ADB is working with the Government \nand  other  development  partners  to  identify  sustainable  resettlement  options  for  the  significant \npercentage of displaced people.    \n \nA  potential  risk  is  that  procedural  delays  in  obtaining  government  approvals  will  slow \n87. \nimplementation. The Government has shown strong commitment to the Project and will arrange \nsimplified procedures. Delays at the EA level will be minimized through the selection of an EA \nwith  considerable  experience  in  implementing  ADB-financed  projects  and  familiarity  with  ADB \nprocedures,  implementation  by  an  established  PCO,  and  consultant  selection  by  ADB.  In  the \npast, the availability of counterpart funding has been a problem in ADB projects in Nepal. MOF \nassured that counterpart funds would be provided to IAs on a timely basis.  \n \nGovernance-related  issues,  including  corruption,  constitute  another  risk.  This  is \n88. \naddressed  through  selecting  all  subprojects,  transparent  implementation  and  monitoring \nmechanisms,  and  specific  financial  controls  including  regular  as  well  as  random  audits. \n\n \n\n\fMeasures  will  include  strict  construction  supervision  and  strong  consultant  support,  use  of  the \nproject performance report, close monitoring by ADB staff, and random procurement and annual \nperformance auditing at the EA level. The PSC will be supported by monitoring and evaluation \nspecialists from MPPW as well as four national  consultants (a project team leader, monitoring \nand evaluation specialist, a procurement specialist, and a financial management specialist), who \nwill  (i)  help  monitor  all  project  activities,  (ii)  conduct  random  spot  checks  during  project \nimplementation, and (iii) provide capacity building in key areas of monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nA  fourth  risk  is  recurrence  of  major  disasters  and  related  extensive  damage.  This  is \n89. \naddressed  by  adopting  cost-effective  flood-resistant  design  standards,  including  capacity \nbuilding, which are expected to reduce damage from future floods. In addition, DWIDP will build \nits capacity under the Project by establishing a flood forecasting system and an early warning \nsystem for the Koshi River, in close coordination with UNDP, which plans to support the early \nwarning system in the field to take necessary actions at the field to prevent any breach of the \nembankment.  The  risk  of  inadequate  maintenance  is  addressed  by  close  monitoring  and \nongoing policy dialogue with the Government.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MPPW  have  given  the \n\n90. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nfast \n\nProject  steering  committee.  Within  1  month  of  grant  effectiveness,  the \nGovernment will establish a PSC to monitor project implementation and oversee \nall  project  governance-related  matters.  Within  1  month  of  grant  effectiveness, \nMPPW will have established a PCO, headed by a full-time project coordinator. \nSimplified  procedures.  Cabinet  will  approve  simplified  and \ntrack \nprocedures  for  goods,  services,  and  civil  works,  in  line  with  the  provisions  on \nemergency projects in its Public Procurement Act and Regulations of 2007, and \nacceptable to ADB. \nDelegation  of  financial  powers.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  delegated \nfinancial powers, in particular those under the financial procedures rules of 2007, \nare followed under the Project.  \nTimely  completion  of  preparatory  activities \nfor  Koshi  bridge.  The \nGovernment will ensure that river survey works be completed by 15 April 2009, \nand  the  contract  be  awarded  by  31  October  2009  in  order  to  complete  the \nconstruction of Koshi bridge at Chatara within the project period. \nCounterpart funds. The Government will allocate and release, on a timely basis, \nadequate  counterpart  funds  from  its  budget  for  each  fiscal  year  during  project \nimplementation. \nOperation  and  maintenance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  facilities \nrehabilitated  or  constructed  under  the  Project  will  be  properly  operated  and \nmaintained by the relevant IAs in accordance with sound practices.  \n\n(vii)  Beneficiary  participation.  All  IAs  will  actively  seek  beneficiary  participation  in \nthe  design  and  implementation  of  all  rehabilitation  works  carried  out  under  the \nProject. \n\n(viii)  Within  1  year  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Cabinet  will  approve  a  flood  disaster \npreparedness  action  plan,  and  DWIDP  will  provide  training  on  flood  awareness \nand preparedness.  \nAnticorruption.  The  following  measures  will  be  taken:  (a)  strict  financial \nmanagement  with  full  adherence  to  monitoring  and  reporting  systems;  (b)  strict \n\n(ix) \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nlaws  and \n\ncompliance with the Government\u2019s Public Procurement Act and Regulations and \nLocal  Body  Financial  Administration  Regulations;  (c)  allowing  third  party \nmonitoring  of  all  subprojects;  and  (d)  random  independent  spot  checks  of \nimplementation by ADB and PCO.  \nEnvironment.  The  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  compliance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  protection \nregulations,  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy,  and  the  summary  IEE  for  the  Project.  In  the  event  of \ndiscrepancy  between  the  Government\u2019s  law  and  regulations  and  the  ADB\u2019s \npolicy,  ADB\u2019s  policy  will  prevail.  The  Government\u2019s  environmental  clearance,  if \nrequired, will be obtained prior to commencing any civil works.  \nResettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  to  the  extent  possible, \nsubprojects  will  not  require  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  In  the \nevent  that  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  is  required  for  any \nsubproject, the Government will prepare a resettlement plan in accordance with \nthe  Government\u2019s  applicable \nInvoluntary \nlaws  and \nResettlement  Policy,  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Resettlement,10 and  the  resettlement \nframework  agreed  for  the  Project.  In  case  of  discrepancy  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s law and regulations and ADB\u2019s policy, ADB\u2019s policy will prevail.  \n\nregulations,  ADB\u2019s \n\n(xii)  Gender  and  social  inclusion.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  IAs  will \nimplement  the  gender  action  plan  for  the  Project.  Within  3  months  of  grant \neffectiveness, gender and social inclusion guidelines will be approved to ensure \nbenefits  accrue  equitably  to  women  and  marginalized  groups.  All  surveys  and \nassessments to be prepared under the Project will employ data disaggregated by \ngender,  caste,  and  ethnicity.  Monitoring  and  reporting  will  address  the  services \nprovided to these groups and will provide data in disaggregated form. \n\n(xiii)  Core  labor  standard.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors \ncomply with all applicable labor laws, do not employ child labor for construction \nand  maintenance  activities,  and  provide  appropriate  facilities  in  construction \ncampsites.  The  Government  requires  contractors  not  to  differentiate  wages \nbetween  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  A  specific  clause  will  be \nincluded  in bidding  documents,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  during \nproject implementation. \nIndigenous  people. The Government will ensure that subprojects will not affect \nvulnerable  population  groups,  such  as  indigenous  people.  In  the  event  of  their \ninvolvement  in  any  of  the  subprojects,  the  Government  will  take  necessary \nactions  required  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and \nregulations, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n\n(xiv) \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n91. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not  \nexceeding $25,600,000 to Nepal from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the Emergency Flood \nDamage  Rehabilitation  Project,  on  such  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 1998.

Most of the large \nrivers are snow-fed, originating in the snow-covered Himalayan range. As the topography of the \ncountry  is  steep  and  high-angle  slope,  very  high  intensity  of  rainfall  during  monsoon  season \ncauses floods and landslides, which are the most destructive types of disasters in Nepal. Three-\nquarters of the total land area of Nepal is hilly and many villages are situated on or adjacent to \nthe  unstable  hill  slopes. Landslides in  the  hills  add  enormous  sediment  to  streams  and  rivers, \nand  cause  floods  downstream.  Each  year,  such  disasters  cause  the  loss  of  human  lives  and \nimmense damage to agricultural land, crops, human settlements, and other physical property. \n  \n2. \nFloods  are  usually  triggered  by  extreme  weather  events  associated  with  heavy  rainfall \nduring the monsoon. Rainfalls events exceeding 300 millimeters (mm) within a 24-hour period, \nwhich  disturb  both  slope  and  channel  equilibrium  on  a  regional  scale,  occur  frequently  in  the \ncountry. The increasing frequency of such extreme precipitation events, together with changes \nin snow and ice cover caused by global warming and other factors, have led to an increase in \nthe number of natural disasters in the country. \n \n3. \nIncreasing  settlements  along  riverbanks  (encroaching  the  rivers)  and  valleys  have \naggravated flood hazards in recent years. From 1983 to 2007, 7,300 people were reported killed \nand  630,500  families  were  affected  by  floods  and  landslides.  According  to  a  report  of  the \nDepartment  of  Water  Induced  Disaster  Prevention  (DWIDP),  floods  contribute  about  34%  of \ntotal  deaths  and  75%  of  total  affected  families  of  all  kinds  of  natural  disasters  in  the  country.1 \nTherefore, priority should be given to reducing the effect of floods.     \n \nPoor understanding of flood causes and a scarcity of relevant hydro-meteorological data \n4. \nhave perpetuated uncertainties in dealing with natural hazards. It is necessary to fill these gaps, \nand  develop  methods  and  techniques  for  flood  management.  These  methods  and  techniques \nshould be simple and affordable if they are to be effective.  \n \n5. \nFloods  can  be  accurately  predicted,  which  can  eventually  help  reduce  damage  to  life \nand  property.  The  hydro-meteorological  systems  of  mountain  areas  are  very  complex  and  are \npoorly  understood.  The  hydro-meteorological  network  is  still  poor;  the  existing  observational \nnetwork  is  not  capable  of  capturing  the  diversity  of  the  mountain  landscape,  and  there  are \ndifficulties in the generalization of weather and climate as there is little or no long-term data.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nBefore the Natural Disaster Relief Act, 1982, there was no well-structured disaster policy \nin  Nepal.  Prior  to  1982,  relief  and  rescue  work  was  carried  out  as  social  work.  The  act  was \nformulated in 1982, and amended in 1989 and 1992.  \n \n7. \nAs the act does not describe the functions and duties of all district disaster management \nrelated  agencies,  there  have  been  cooperation,  coordination,  and  mutual  understanding \nproblems among the flood related agencies. Disaster victims do not receive immediate, efficient, \nand  effective  rescue  and  relief  services.  Delayed  relief  works  often  bring  very  serious  and \n\nFlood Management in Nepal \n\n                                                 \n1 DWIDP. 2008. Disaster Review. Kathmandu. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nunpleasant  results,  and  duplication  of  efforts  has  been  experienced,  mainly  because  of  the \nabsence  of  dialogue  and  mutual  understanding  among  agencies.  In  addition,  some  disaster \nrelated agencies try to shift their responsibilities to others, as the act does not provide clear-cut \njob descriptions. Immediate formulation of natural disaster relief regulations is necessary to give \nclear-cut job descriptions of all disaster related agencies. \n \n8. \nAccording  to  the  Natural  Disaster  Relief  Act,  the  Central  Natural  Disaster  Relief \nCommittee  (CNDRC)  has  been  constituted  under  the  leadership  of  the  home  minister  to \nformulate  and  implement  policies  and  programs  relating  to  natural  disaster  relief  work,  and  to \nundertake other necessary measures. The CNDRC prepares specific norms of relief assistance \nto  be  given  to  disaster  victims  of  the  affected  area  in  cash  and/or  in  kind.  Although  there  is  a \nrelief  and  treatment  subcommittee,  supply  shelter  and  rehabilitation  subcommittee,  regional \ndisaster  relief  committees,  DDRCs,  and  local  disaster  relief  committee,  only  the  CNDRC  and \nDDRC are active. \n \nThe  CNDRC  may  establish  the  relief  and  treatment  subcommittee  and  supply  shelter \n9. \nand rehabilitation subcommittee, which provide advice and suggestions to the CNDRC; help to \nexecute  CNDRC  policies  and  directives;  and  operate  rescue,  relief,  and  rehabilitation  work \neffectively during very serious natural disasters.  \n\nThe  Ninth  Plan  (1998\u20132002)  underlines  the  need  to  strengthen  disaster  management \n10. \ncapacity.  It  envisages  attempting  to  prevent,  mitigate,  and  reduce  natural  disasters  through \nmore  advanced  geological,  hydrological,  and  meteorological  technology.  Hazard  mapping, \nvulnerability assessment, risk analysis, and an early warning system have to be developed; and \na well-trained and efficient labor should be made available. The plan suggests that the policies \nand plan emphasize the importance and need for national and/or international assistance.  \n\n11. \nResponding  to  the  request  of  the  United  Nations,  Nepal  has  constituted  a  high-level \nNational Committee for the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, chaired by the \nhome minister and represented by high-level dignitaries from government and nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). The National Action Plan prepared under the direction of the committee \nincludes  activities  on  disaster  preparedness,  response,  mitigation,  rehabilitation,  and \nreconstruction  programs;  and  specifies  the  responsibilities  of  various  disaster  actors  with  a \nspecified  time  frame.  The  plan  guides  disaster  reduction  tasks  by  formulating  special  actions \nand mobilizing the available resources in the given period.  \n\n12.  Media  involvement  is  helping  to  raise  public  awareness  in  cooperation  with  various \ngovernment agencies and NGOs. Each year, public awareness programs are launched on the  \nradio  and  television.  During  the  hazardous  season,  distribution  of  posters  and  pamphlets,  as \nwell as media alerts, raise public awareness significantly. \n \n13. \nDifferent government agencies and development partners\u2014including Japan International \nCooperation  Agency,  Water  Induced  Disaster  Prevention  Technical  Centre,  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  Asian \nDisaster  Preparedness  Center\u2014are  involved  in  conducting  workshops,  seminars,  and  training \nprograms on disaster management. Such activities have contributed significantly to raise public \nawareness and labor development. \n\nIn addition, the Department of Mines and Geology is preparing a landslide inventory. The \n14. \nWater  Induced  Disaster  Prevention  Technical  Centre  is  carrying  out  thematic  studies  on \nlandslides  and  monitoring  of  landslides.  The  Department  of  Soil  Conservation  is  doing \nprotection  works  in  different  districts.  The  Department  of  Roads  is  carrying  out  bioengineering \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nworks  in  cooperation  with  Tribhuvan  University  to  stabilize  the  slope  and  road  cut  sides.  The \nDepartment of Hydrology and Meteorology and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain \nDevelopment are preparing a map of flood-prone areas. The International Centre for Integrated \nMountain  Development  also  conducts  research  and  training  activities  on  natural  hazards.  The \nDepartment  of  Hydrology  and  Meteorology  is  involved  in  generating  data  on  earthquakes  and \nweather forecasts in Nepal. Tribhuvan University established a Mountain Risk Engineering Unit \nfor training purposes. \n\nFlood Management in the Project Areas \n\nC. \n \n15. \nDisaster  risks  in  the  flood-affected  areas  are  high,  as  they  are  vulnerable  to  annual \nfloods  during  the  wet  season.  The  damaged  left  embankment  of  the  Koshi  River  needs  to  be \nrehabilitated  as  soon  as  possible  so  that  the  Government\u2019s  recovery  program  can  be  more \neffective  in  the  immediate  humanitarian  relief  program,  and  the  Government\u2019s  short-term \nrecovery program in flood-affected areas can be initiated.  \n \nTo  reduce  disaster  risks  in  flood-affected  areas,  the  Government  proposed  additional \n16. \nriver training works in Kailali, Kanchanpur, and Sunsari districts. However, a feasibility study of \nproposed  river  training  works  needs  to  be  undertaken  to  improve  the  risk  management  of  the \nproposed works and to prioritize the proposed river training works.  \n \n17. \nAs the Government needs to study flood risk in the Koshi River, it is recommended that \na  study  team\u2014comprising  a  river  morphologist,  river  engineer,  and  international  river  legal \nadvisor\u2014be mobilized to prepare a disaster risk management plan in close coordination with the \ntechnical  team  of  the  Government  of  India  in  order  to  respond  to  any  future  floods  (a  similar \neffort is being made in Bihar State, India).   \n \n18. \nThe  far  western  region  is  also  vulnerable  to  annual  floods  as  heavy  rainfall  brings \nlandslides, which cause floods in the mountains. This is mainly a localized phenomenon, but the \nresulting  flash  floods  can  be  quite  devastating  when  they  descend  the  mountains.  Excessive \nrainfall  is  the  primary  cause  of  flooding,  but  even  concentrated  and  heavy  rainfall  in  the \nwatershed during the wet season would not cause such severe flooding if the resulting surface \nrunoff could flow away downstream without hindrance. In the far western region, a combination \nof  natural  factors,  including  the  silting  up  of  river  channels  and  river  wandering,  require  civil \nworks  to provide  quick drainage  of the  relatively  large  runoff.  Therefore,  it  is  recommended  to \nprepare a flood action plan for each district to prevent future flood damage and landslides.  \n \n19. \nTo overcome future floods efficiently and effectively, bilateral water treaties need to be \nreviewed by the governments of Nepal and India to improve the management and maintenance \nof  barrages  and  embankments  in  the  bilateral  rivers;  and  to  clarify  the  responsibilities  of  both \ngovernments  in  maintenance  of  river  works.  As  the  embankments  in  Nepal\u2019s  rivers  are \nvulnerable  to  floods,  it  is  necessary  to  establish  a  safety  monitoring  mechanism  in  each \nembankment in the bilateral rivers and to allocate suitable budgets to DWIDP and the Ministry of \nWater  Resources  in  order  to  improve  bilateral  coordination  in  disaster  management  with  the \nGovernment of India. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fDEVELOPMENT PARTNERS' CLUSTER ACTIVITIES \n \n\nAchievements in 2008 \n\nPriorities for 2009 \n\nProvide and pre-position essential \nemergency medicines, equipment, and \nhealth kits \n \nIntensify the disease surveillance and \nreporting system \n \nStrengthen the capacity of peripheral level \nhealth staff and vulnerable communities by \nproviding training and capacity building to \nupgrade emergency preparedness and \nresponse, and pre-position key medical \nand reproductive health kits \n \nEnsure health sector coordination between \nhumanitarian and development partners \nduring disaster response and recovery \noperations, including strengthening referral \nservices \nImplementation of preparedness activities \nfor emergencies, including lessons \nlearned from the floods \n \nImplementing the community-based \nmanagement of acute malnutrition pilot \nproject and resource mobilization for \nincreased outreach and national coverage \nMulti-micronutrient supplementation in \n  food-deficient areas \n\n26   Appendix 3 \n\n \n\nCluster \n\n1. \n\nHealth \n\n2. \n\nNutrition \n\n \n\n1,400 health personnel received training to \nprovide emergency health response \nMobilized pre-positioned medicine for emergency \nresponse \n\n \n\nExcellent coordination with UN agencies, \npartners, and Ministry of Health and Population \nUN agencies and NGOs, in support of the \nGovernment, increased the access of vulnerable \npopulations to reproductive health.

The \n\ntechnology,  and \n\nDamage and Impact \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nOn 18 August 2008, a massive flood on the Koshi River breached about 1.7 kilometers \n(km)  of  its  east  embankment,  which  resulted  in  inundation  of  many  village  development \ncommittees  (VDCs),  with  major  damage  to  agricultural  land  and  standing  crops.  On \n3 September  2008,  farming  land  and  standing  crops  were  damaged  by  floods\u2014mainly  by  the \nDodha River in Kanchanpur district and by the Mohana River in Kailali district. In Sunsari, major \ndamage and losses occurred in four VDCs were located along the east embankment.1 However, \nin Kailali and Kanchanpur, damages and losses were scattered throughout several VDCs, with \nhigh magnitude in 7 VDCs in Kanchanpur and 11 VDCs in Kailali.2    \n \nThe  damage  assessment  indicated  that  the  floods  damaged  25,870  hectares  (ha)  of \n2. \nagricultural  land  and  standing  crops  in  different  magnitudes  in  the  three  districts  (5,282  ha  in \nSunsari;  10,215  ha  in  Kailali;  and  10,375  ha  in  Kanchanpur)  owned  by  35,151  farm  families \n(5,320  in  Sunsari;  17,059  in  Kailali;  and  12,772  in  Kanchanpur).  Out  of  the  total  affected \nagricultural  land,  3,590  ha  is  heavily  damaged  (2,590  ha  in  Sunsari  alone),  and  can  only  be \nreclaimed  in  the  medium  term  by  cleaning  sand  or  recovering  land  productivity  through \ncultivation  of  suitable  crops, \nfloods  have  damaged \n123,706 metric tons (t) of standing crops (20,158 t in Sunsari; 41,159 t in Kailali; and 60,847 t in \nKanchanpur).  Major  crops  damaged  were  paddy  (80,783  t);  vegetable  (9,374  t);  sugarcane \n(23,985 t); fruits (5,215 t); pulses (999 t); others3 (3,350 t); and fish (100,000 kilograms)\u2014worth \nabout  $19.6  million  equivalent.  The  floods  have  seriously  affected  the  livelihoods  of  about \n32,500  farm  families,  requiring  medium-  and  long-term  measures  to  revive  agriculture  and \nrestore  their  livelihoods.  Agriculture  infrastructure  (such  as  agriculture  product  collection  and \nmarket centers, micro-irrigation systems, fishponds, and agriculture service centers) were also \ndamaged.  \n       \nB. \n \n3. \nThe agriculture component will restore the livelihoods of affected people from 22 VDCs \nin the project districts by supporting them to grow cash crops such as vegetables, watermelon, \npeanuts, parwar (pointed gourd), sunflower, jute, and arahar (pulse) in the highly affected areas; \nand cultivate cereals (paddy, wheat, and maize) and vegetables in partly affected areas. Seeds, \nsaplings, compost, and pesticides will be provided to affected farm families by organizing them \ninto groups; and training will be provided to reclaim soil fertility so that livelihoods are restored. \nThe  reestablishment  of  fruit  orchards  (such  as  banana,  mango,  and  pineapple)  and \nrehabilitation of fishponds, agriculture products collection and marketing centers, and agriculture \nservice centers will be carried out. Other activities such as fingerlings and beehives (with bee) \nwill be provided to interested farm families to support their livelihoods. Basic equipment will be \nprovided to undertake agricultural programs. Management services and consulting inputs will be \navailable to implement this component.  \n \n4. \nThis  component  will  support  rehabilitation  of  agriculture  in  7,940  ha  of  farmland \n(3,688 ha  in  Sunsari;  2,264  ha  in  Kailali;  and  1,988  ha  in  Kanchanpur),  covering  7,730  farm \nfamilies (3,280 families in Sunsari; 2,640 families in Kailali; and 1,810 families in Kanchanpur), \nand restoration of livelihoods of about 45,600 people (19,680 in Sunsari; 14,520 in Kailali; and \n\nProject Scope \n\n                                                 \n1 The four VDCs heavily damaged by the Koshi floods are Shreepur, Hariput, Paschim Kusaha, and Laukahi. \n2  In  Kailali,  the  most  affected  VDCs  are  Hasuliya,  Dansingpur,  Lalbojhi,  Ratanpur,  Pawera,  Khailad,  Basauti, \nGadariya, Narayanpur, and Fulbari. The most affected VDCs in Kanchanpur district include Shankarpur, Laxmipur, \nChadani, Krishnapur, Dekhatbhuli, Raikawar-Bichawa, and Shreepur.   \n\n \n\n3 Other crops include maize, oilseed, jute, and fish.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nProject and Community Selection  \n\n11,400 in Kanchanpur). The beneficiaries will comprise 45% women and 25% dalit4 and janajati5 \ncommunities. \n \nC. \n \nProject  beneficiaries  will  be  the  flood-affected  farm  families.  For  support  under  this \n5. \ncomponent,  the  farm  families  will  be  selected  based  on  their  demand  and  preparedness  to \nrestore  their  livelihood  through  revival  of  agriculture.  Specific  criteria  will  include  that  farm \nfamilies  (i)  are  formally  returned  to  their  original  areas  from  camps,  (ii)  have  land  where \ncultivation of suitable cereal or cash crops is possible, (iii) are willing to cultivate suitable crops \nthrough project support, (iv) are prepared to be members of farmer groups formed in respective \nsettlements,  and  (v)  are  committed  to  continue  agriculture  after  the  Project  is  completed.  The \nmost  affected  people  requiring  immediate  support  will  be  given  high  priority.  Cohesive  groups \nwill  be  formed  through  social  mobilization,  taking  into  account  their  preference  to  grow  crops \nsuitable for their lands. Out of the targeted 7,940 farm families, 25% is expected to be covered \nin 2009, 50% in 2010, and the remaining 25% in 2011. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe  total  cost  for  implementation  of  this  component  is  estimated  at  $3.87  million \nequivalent,  comprising  $1.71  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $2.16  million  in  local \ncurrency  costs  (Table  A4.1).

The  Department  of  Agriculture  (DOA)  under  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Cooperatives will be the implementing agency (IA) for this component. DOA will \nimplement  through  its  district  agriculture  development  offices  (DADOs).  DADO  chiefs  will  be \nresponsible  for  planning  and  implementation,  under  the  guidance  of  the  district  agriculture \ndevelopment  committee  and  coordinated  by  the  local  development  officer  of  the  respective \ndistrict  development  committees.  From  among  existing  DADO  staff,  DOA  will  assign  an \nagronomist,  a  horticulturist  and  fisheries  specialist,  an  account  officer,  and  three  junior \ntechnicians. At the center, DOA will establish a project implementation unit (PIU) headed by a \ndeputy director general and supported by a senior agriculture officer, an account officer, and an \nadministrative  staff.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  consolidation  of  physical  and  financial \ninformation  received  from  the  field,  circulation  of  physical  progress  reports  to  the  project \ncoordination  office  and  ADB,  and  submission  of  withdrawal  applications  to  PCO  for \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures.  \n \n9. \ndescribed in Appendix 11. \n \n10. \nImplementation  Schedule.

Two  teams  of  consultants\u2014comprising  an  agronomist,  an \nagriculture  engineer,  and  a  social  (community  facilitator)  will  assist  implementation  of  this \ncomponent  in  Sunsari,  Kailali,  and  Kanchanpur.  The  social  mobilizer  will  also  assist  in  the \nselection  of  communities  and  programs  to  ensure  that  the  most  affected  people  receive  high \npriority  for  support  and  restoration  of  their  livelihoods.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Supplementary Appendix D.    \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\nIRRIGATION \n\nProject Scope \n\nDamage and Impact \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nOn  18  August  2008,  the  Koshi  River  breached  its  left  embankment,  which  led  to \ninundation  and  severe  flooding  in  four  village  development  committees  (VDCs):  Haripur, \nLaukahi, , Paschim Kusaha, and Shreepur.1 About 90% of the river discharge flew through the \nbreached  embankment  and  damaged  standing  crops,  farmlands,  irrigation  facilities,  and  other \ninfrastructure.  It  was  estimated  that  5,280  hectares  (ha)  of  farmland  were  severely  damaged, \naffecting  the  livelihoods  of  3,280  farm  families.  The  national  highway  was  also  damaged  at \nseveral places, interrupting the daily life of people from the Eastern Development Region.    \n \n2. \nExcessive rainfall of 240\u2013300 millimeters (mm) per day during 19\u201320 September 2008, \nwith an occurrence frequency of 50-year, caused floods in Kailali and Kanchanpur districts that \ndamaged  irrigation  facilities  and  related  infrastructure  in  both  districts.  The  estimated  cost  to \ndamaged irrigation facilities in 11,542 ha of the three districts is $12.7 million, which has ceased \nirrigation facility on farmland, and affected 8,931 farm families and 57,788 people. The total loss \nof agricultural income caused by the absence of irrigation was estimated at about $16.6 million.  \n \nB. \n \nThis irrigation part will rehabilitate the damaged 27 surface irrigation systems, including \n3. \ntheir head works, main and branch canals and village channels, canal structures such as drain \nsiphons and outlets, canal service roads and small bridges, and protection works for key canal \nstructures. Rehabilitation of the irrigation systems will restore irrigation facilities to 11,542 ha of \nfarmland.  To  revive  agriculture  quickly  in  viable  areas  and  supplement  surface  irrigation  after \ntheir  rehabilitation,  700  shallow  tube  wells  (STWs)  will  be  installed  and  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  cost  will  be  provided  for  a  year.  The  total  cost  estimated  for  this  component  is \n$9.18 million ($7.66 million for rehabilitation of surface irrigation and $1.52 million for installation \nof STWs). Details on surface irrigation systems for rehabilitation and the area to be irrigated are \nin Table A5.1.  \n \n4.  \nThe Project will finance the rehabilitation of 25 head works; 127 kilometers (km) of main, \nbranch, and tertiary canals; 196 canal structures such as drain siphon, aqueduct, gates, outlets, \nand  inlets;  36  km  of  canal  service  roads;  45  culverts  and  small  bridges;  and  1  medium-sized \nbridge (on canal service road). It will also undertake necessary protection works for the above \nstructures. Consultant inputs will be provided to ensure quality of rehabilitation work, and social \nmobilization  services  will  be  available  to  secure  the  involvement  of  target  groups  during \nimplementation for their ownership to the rehabilitated infrastructure.    \n \n5. \nFor  immediate  revival  of  agriculture  in  feasible  areas,  and  to  supplement  surface \nirrigation  after  their  rehabilitation,  700  STWs  will  be  installed  in  Sunsari  district  under  this \ncomponent.

The  major  structures  of  the  gravity  flow  water  facilities\u2014including  intakes \n(both  streams  and  springs  near  the  river),  transmission  pipeline  of  various  sizes  and  lengths, \nand  river  crossings\u2014have  been  washed  away  by  the  floods.  Currently,  about  94,000  people \nfetch  water  from  the  nearest  available  river,  irrigation  system,  and  hand  pumps.  In  Sunsari \ndistrict, 3,900 shallow tube wells, serving about  22,000 people, were under water  and most of \nthem  were  covered  by  sand.  Flood-affected  people  are  displaced  in  the  following  four  areas: \n(i) formal  camps,  (ii)  spontaneous  settlements,  (iii)  host  families,  and  (iv)  earlier  residence. \nReturnees  to  their  previous  area  and  residents  of  spontaneous  settlements  are  the  most \nvulnerable in terms of access to drinking water and sanitation facilities.  \n \nB. \n \n\nProject Activities  \n\n1. \n\nWater Supply Scheme  \n\n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  28  gravity  flow  water  supply  systems  in  Kailali  and \nKanchanpur; construct 4 small overhead water supply systems; and install 3,500 shallow tube \nwells in Sunsari to provide access to drinking water and sanitation facilities for the flood-affected \npeople. The gravity flow water supply systems and small overhead water supply systems will be \ndesigned to give the disadvantaged and poor adequate access to drinking water and sanitation, \nand will be operated and maintained by the respective communities.   \n  \n\n2. \n\nSanitation \n\n \n\n3.  \nThis activity will cover a health and hygiene education awareness program and support \nthe construction of household latrines for returnees in Sunsari district. In Kailali and Kanchanpur \ndistricts, the Project will focus on promoting hygiene and sanitation behavioral change through \nan  integrated  community  and  school-based  program.  Revolving  funds  will  be  available  to \nencourage  rapid  and  significant  expansion  of  latrine  use  and  proper  hand  washing  in  project-\nassisted  communities.  The  health  and  hygiene  education  awareness  program,  with  a \ncommunity-led modality, will be implemented for 6 months for each district.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCommunity Mobilization  \n\n \n4.  \nThe  Project  envisages  the  active  participation  of  communities  to  ensure  equitable \naccess  to  benefits,  and  long-term  sustainability  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities.  In \naccordance with the Government\u2019s strategy, project beneficiaries (users) and water supply and \nsanitation communities are responsible for operation and maintenance of facilities. This activity \nwill  (i)  form  water  users  and  sanitation  communities  (WUSC)  or  strengthen  existing  WUSCs; \n(ii) organize  an  orientation  program;  (iii)  ensure  optimum  use  of  locally  available  resources, \nincluding labor and skills; and (iv) establish effective operation and maintenance mechanisms.

In  view  of  the  large  number  shallow  tube  wells  and  construction  of  the \nhousehold  latrines  for  returnees  in  Sunsari  district,  a  number  of  measures  will  be  taken  to \nensure that monitoring of project activities is adequate to verify that the quality and quantity of \nworks  are  satisfactory,  and  that  fiscal  management  of  allocated  funds  is  sound.  A  water  and \nsanitation committee will be established for each village development committee. The returnees \nwill have access to information about the design of the shallow tube wells and latrines. At least \none  social  mobilizer  (community  facilitator)  per  two  subprojects  under  activity  C  and  health \nmotivators  will  be  provided  to  inform  beneficiaries  about  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  part. \nAfter  installation  of  each  shallow  tube  well,  the  installer  has  to  sign  the  quality  assurance \ncertification and the recipient will certify receipt of the services. Water quality will be confirmed \nby the water quality laboratory of the Water Supply and Sanitation Division Office in Sunsari.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n40  \n \n\nROADS \n\nDamage and Impact \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe 2008 floods caused extensive damage to the road network, both in the Koshi area in \nthe east and in far western Nepal. In the east, the East\u2013West Highway and some feeder roads \n(including bridges and culverts) were severely damaged. Similarly, incessant rainfall and floods \ncaused  widespread  damage  to  the  Strategic  Road  Network  in  the  far  west,  including \nembankment  failures,  damage  to  approaches  and  bridge  protection  works,  landslides, \nrockslides  and  debris  flow  in  the  East\u2013West  Highway,  Mahakali  Highway,  Seti  Highway,  and \nSilgadi-Sanfe  Roads.  Although  the  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  has  managed  to  open  the \nroads  in  the  far  west,  major  landslides  are  yet  to  be  removed  and  rehabilitation  of  damaged \nroads and retaining structures needs to be carried out. Eastern Nepal remains cut off from the \nrest of the country; the only means of transport are by air or via a long detour through India at \nmore than double the normal transportation cost. There has been a significant negative impact \non  the  economy  of  the  entire  eastern  region  following  the  Koshi  floods.  Considering  the \nrelatively  low  discharge  in  the  river  on  the  day  the  Koshi  embankment  was  breached  causing \nwidespread damage, the embankment remains vulnerable to further breaches. \n  \n2. \nBased on the information available from DOR, the direct damage and indirect losses in \nthe  road  sector  due  to  the  2008  floods  in  the  Koshi  river  area  and  the  far  western  region  are \nestimated to be more than $36.00 million.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  road  part  of  the  Project  comprises  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  damaged \n3. \nstrategic roads in the far west, and replacement of existing ferries by a permanent bridge  over \nthe Koshi River at Chatara. Rehabilitation of flood-damaged feeder and local roads in the Koshi \narea, which are under the responsibility of the Ministry of Local Development, will be carried out \nunder  the  ongoing  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Sector  Development  Program 1 \nfunded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at an estimated cost of $4 million. The roads part \nof the Project will cover rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and, where technically feasible \nand justified, the design of rehabilitation works will focus on preventive and mitigating measures \nto  minimize  the  damaging  effect  of  similar  floods  in  the  future.  This  conforms  with  the  flood \ndamage  and  needs  assessment  report  prepared  by  ADB  and  the  Government\u2019s  recovery \nstrategy.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nReconstruction  and  rehabilitation  works  are  based  on  government  priority  and  the \nseverity of damages caused by the floods, both in the east and far western Nepal. The following \nselection criteria have been used to select the project components: \n \n\nProject Activities  \n\nProject Scope \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  project  will  reconstruct  and  rehabilitate  damaged  or  vulnerable  roads, \nbridges, culverts, and retaining structures that are under the responsibility of \nDOR. \nPriority  was  given  to  roads  and  structures  that  will  reduce  the  future \nvulnerability of the infrastructure and preparedness for possible flood damage \nin the future. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2007.

The  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency for the Project and DOR will be the Implementing Agency. The ADB project \ndirectorate,  established  in  1987,  and  fully  functional  under  previous  projects,  will  serve  as  the \nPIU for overall project coordination, monitoring, and implementation. The PIU will be supported \nby  sufficient  technical  and  administrative  staff.  On-site  project  office  will  be  established  in  the \nKoshi area, headed by a full-time project manager supported by adequate support staff. Division \nchiefs of respective division road offices will be designated project managers for the roadworks \nin  the  far  west.  Project  managers  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  and  will \nreport to the project director in the PIU. \n \n9. \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  to  provide  inputs  for  the  design  and  construction \nsupervision of the project components, and will assist the PIU and project managers to ensure \ntimely  implementation  of  the  construction  activities.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting \nservices are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n10. \nin Appendix 11. \n \n\nProcurement. Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the procurement plan \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n43 \n\nfielding  of  design  and  supervision  consultants,  and \n\nConsulting  Services.  Since  the  Project  must  be  completed  within  36  months, \n11. \ntimely \nexpeditious  selection  and \ncommencement of construction activities, are critical milestones for the roads component. The \nGovernment  believes  that  procurement  of  consultants  may  be  delayed  if  it  is  performed \nfollowing government rules and regulations. Therefore, ADB has agreed with the Government\u2019s \nrequest to start the design of the proposed bridge at Chatara immediately, using funds from the \nongoing  Road  Connectivity  Sector  I  Project;  and  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works \nassured ADB that the design consultants will be mobilized immediately.3 ADB has also agreed \nwith the Government to select two design and construction supervision consultants on behalf of \nthe  Government,  using  the  consultants\u2019  qualification  selection  method.  Some  individual \nconsultants will be recruited on a needs basis. \n \n12. \nImplementation  Schedule.  The  roads  part  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of \n36 months and will be completed by 30 June 2012. Most of the roadworks will be completed by \nDecember 2011. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2006.

analysis  was  carried  out  for  each  component  and  for  the  Project  as  a \nwhole. The costs of the project coordination office were allocated to each component based on \ntheir  total  expenditures.  The  conversion  of  financial  to  economic  pricing  took  into  account \ninternational  pricing  for  tradable  goods  and  taxes  and  duties  in  accordance  with  Nepalese \ntariffs.  Shadow  wage  rates  were  estimated  for  agricultural  and  skilled  workers.  Conversion \nfactors  used  for  previous  Asian  Development  bank  (ADB)  projects  involving  agriculture  and \nroads were applied to this Project.1 \n \n2. \nIn summary, the overall financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project, based on a \n20-year life, is estimated at 20.42% and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 24.56%. \nA 1-year delay in implementation, the major risk, reduces the FIRR to 19.2% and the EIRR to \n23.3%. The Table SAE.3 in Supplementary Appendix 3 provides more detail on the sensitivity of \ninvestments  to  risk  and  uncertainty.  Overall,  the  EIRR  is  robust  against  a  range  of  project-\nspecific variations. The EIRR of the Chatara bridge is a special case and its justification rests on \nstrategic issues as much as economic issues. The sections below discuss economic benefits for \neach of the components. \n \n \n \n3. \nThe Irrigation Department shows an irrigation command area of 27,471 hectares (ha) in \nthe  proposed  project  area.  Of  this  total,  the  irrigation  system  covering  10,283  ha  has  been \ndamaged.  In  the  financial  and  economic  analysis,  it  is  assumed  that  even  land  in  the \nundamaged  command  area  (17,188  ha)  has  a  loss  of  production  of  10%  because  the  whole \ncommand  area  is  affected.  Within  the  damaged  area,  it  is  assumed  that  20%  (2,057  ha)  has \naccess to alternative water supplies through the use of pumps, and is able to grow winter and \nwet season crops although at reduced production levels, while the remaining 8,226 ha has no \naccess to water and only grows a non-irrigated paddy crop in the wet season. \n \n4. \nThe analysis assumes a cropping intensity of 1.80 that is based on combined statistics \nfor the eastern and far western Terai districts.2 It assumes that the paddy area is equal to the \nirrigated area, cereals equal 55% of the irrigated area, and cash crops take up 25% of area. To \nsimplify calculations, wheat is the proxy for cereals (maize, millet, and barley) and oilseed and \npotatoes are the proxy for cash crops that also include sugarcane and jute. \n \n5. \nCrop incomes are based on production outputs ranging from 50% to 100% of production. \nThe  financial  income  is  NRs364.0  million  without  the  Project  and  NRs576.0 million  with  the \nProject by the third year\u2014an annual increase of NRs211.0 million. On an economic basis, the \nnet  annual  benefit  from  the  Project  is  NRs275.0  million.  This  higher  benefit  is  due  to  the \neconomic  farm  gate  price  for  paddy  being  NRs15.8  per  kilogram  compared  to  NRs12.0  per \nkilogram  market  price.  The  FIRR  for  the  Project  from  irrigation  rehabilitation  is  14.8%  and  the \nEIRR  is  30.0%.  A  delay  in  implementation  of  1 year  lowers  the  EIRR  to  23.0%.  This  delay  is \nconsidered unlikely. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB.  2003.

Kathmandu.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n59 \n\n2. \n\nAgriculture \n\n \n6. \nFull  information  concerning  a  complete  classification  of  land  according  to  potential  use \nand  the  number  of  farm  families  affected  and  willing  to  return  is  still  being  collected.  The \nanalysis  is  based  on  total  mapped  areas  less  the  area  of  490  ha  totally  damaged.  Indicative \nrevenues  and  expenditures  for  the  proposed  fishponds,  orchards,  and  cash  crops  for  affected \nland  areas  have  been  assessed.  To  avoid  an  overlap  in  benefits  from  irrigation,  the  benefits \nfrom  agriculture  in  this  analysis  focus  on  damaged  land  that  is  not  immediately  amenable  to \nsurface  irrigation  and,  in  many  cases,  requires  a  changed  use  of  land  supplemented  by  the \navailability of shallow tube wells (STWs).  \n \n7. \nThe projected benefits from the Project are estimated on a conservative basis. The STW \noperating costs are derived from the ADB Community Groundwater Irrigation Sector Project, as \nare  the  revenues  and  other  operating  costs  for  vegetables.  Family  labor  is  included  in  costs. \nTotal labor creation from the targeted area of 3,590 ha is estimated at 1,871 person-years per \nannum. It is assumed that only one crop is grown each year. Until more data are available, only \nvegetable crops have been included in the analysis. The FIRR for the component is 14.1% and \nthe EIRR is 16.16%. \n \n\n3. \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation \n\n \nWater supply and sanitation comprises overhead and gravity water supply systems in all \n8. \nthree  districts  plus  hand  pumps  and  reconstructed  toilets  in  Sunsari,  for  a  total  direct  cost  of \nNRs314.07 million. The number of households and population indicate a total savings of more \nthan 100,000 hours per day. This is converted to economically active workdays, assuming each \nhousehold  has  1.5  active  workers  and  70%  of  the  hand-carried  water  is  carried  by  an  adult \nbefore  the  Project.  The  value  of  workdays  gained  is  NRs290.7  million  per  annum  at  a  daily \nwage  rate  of  NRs185.  Operational  costs  for  the  new  investments  are  calculated  at \nNRs26.2 million per annum, leaving a net annual gain of NRs264.5 million. \n \n \n9. \nThe  FIRR  for  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  investment  is  27.77%  and  the  EIRR  is \n26.32%.  The  component  benefits  18,856  households  (103,700 persons).  Water  supply  and \nsanitation construction utilizes 294,925 person-days of work, equivalent to 1,134 person-years \nof work and wage incomes amounting to NRs54.56 million. \n \n\nRoads \n\n4. \n \nIn the far west, five road systems are proposed for rehabilitation; three require road and \n10. \nbridge repairs and two require reconstruction following the removal of landslides. The total cost \nis NRs315 million. Benefits from repairs are calculated as being (i) a saving in vehicle costs of \nNRs0.239 million per day (NRs2.462 million without the Project and NRs2,223 million with the \nProject); (ii) a saving of 13,940 passenger hours per day; and (iii) a saving of not requiring three \nearthmoving machines on standby at each of three mega-landslide locations. These savings are \ncalculated on a full-year basis. \n \nThe Project provides for the construction of a 350-meter bridge at Chatara crossing the \n11. \nKoshi  River  to  allow  east\u2013west  traffic  to  proceed  even  when  the  main  East\u2013West  Highway  is \nimpassable.  The  cost  of  this  is  estimated  at  $7.4  million.  There  are  four  types  of  savings  are \nmade when people use the bridge when the East\u2013West Highway is impassable: (i) the saving in \nferry costs at the Chatara crossing, (ii) the savings in foot traffic costs and time, (iii) the saving in \nvehicle  costs,  and  (iv)  the  saving  in  vehicle  passenger  hours.  The  savings  in  ferry  costs  are \nNRs12.29 million per 180 days or NRs0.07 million per day. The savings in foot traffic costs are \nNRs0.04 million per day. The savings in vehicle costs and time are based on distances shown \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\nIncome and Employment \n\n60  \n \nin  Table  SAE.2  in  the  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  The  saving  in  vehicle  costs  is  NRs2.773 \nmillion  per  day  when  the  East\u2013West  road  is  impassable.  The  saving  would  be  greater  if  the \nroads on both sides of the Chatara bridge were bitumen sealed\u2014a further NRs0.909 million per \nday (but this is not envisaged under the Project). Construction of the Chatara bridge would save \n34,894 passenger hours per day during future floods. This saving amounts to NRs0.538 million \nper day, assuming two-thirds of passengers are economically active. \n \n12. \nOperation  and  maintenance  costs  of  5%  of  cost  per  annum  are  included.  A  residual \nvalue of the bridge of 50% of cost after 20 years is included. Had the bridge been in place prior \nto the 2008 flood, the 180 days damage aversion would have saved $7.6 million in costs. Based \non 42 days of use each year, the FIRR of the bridge is 13.8% and the EIRR 12.9%. The rate of \nreturn from  the bridge investment is highly dependent on the frequency and duration of future \nflooding. \n \n13. \nIn  the  far  west,  the  annual  saving  in  vehicle  costs  amounts  to  NRs86.22  million.  The \nbenefit from saved passenger time, assuming two-thirds of passengers are economically active \nand  have  a  daily  wage  rate  of  NRs200,  amounts  to  NRs83.64  million.  The  saving  from  not \nneeding three earthmoving machines on standby is NRs3.6 million, assuming a capital cost of \nNRs6 million per machine and operating costs (including depreciation, repairs, and operations) \nof 20% per annum. The total benefit amounts to NRs173.46 million and the associated FIRR is \n41.5% including operation and maintenance of 5% per annum. The EIRR is 40.20%. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nIn  agriculture  and  irrigation,  a  total  of  35,150  farm  families  were  affected  by  flood \ndamage and 22,100 families require rehabilitation of their water supply and sanitation services. \nMany of the latter group have also incurred losses caused by irrigation and agricultural damage, \nand are included in the first total. Of the 35,150 families, 19,950 families have no land damage \nbut are affected by a reduced supply of irrigation water; 11,570 families require rehabilitation of \ntheir surface irrigation facilities; 2,840 families have had their land badly damaged and have no \nimmediate  source  of  revenue;  and  790  families  have  completely  lost  their  land.  Before  the \ndisaster, the income per family (including wages for farm labor) was an average of NRs47,759 \n(including  NRs22,854  in  wages  and  NRs25,905  net  farm  income).  Following  the  disaster,  the \nfamily income is estimated at an average NRs35,350 for the 19,950 families and NRs13,305 for \nthe 11,570 families. The two remaining family groups with a total 3,630 families have zero farm \nincome  because  their  land  is  severely  damaged  or  irreparably  lost.  In  aggregate,  the  annual \nlabor  surplus  (net  income  plus  wages)  will  drop  from  NRs1,261  million  before  the  disaster  to \nNRs693 million  after  the  disaster\u2014equal  to  a  loss  of  NRs568  million  ($7.2  million)  in  the  year \nfollowing the disaster. This is in addition to the loss of crops during the flood. \n \n15. \nBefore  the  disaster,  farm  labor  amounted  to  15,160  persons  in  full-time  employment. \nThis  declined  to  10,290  persons  with  the  disaster,  creating  unemployment  equal  to \n4,870 persons\u201432%  of  the  original  workforce.  It  is  estimated  that  project  works  could  create \n9,200 person-years of employment over two and a half years, and it is suggested that not less \nthan 60% of this should be allocated to flood-affected persons. On an annual basis, this would \nprovide  work  for  2,200  persons\u2014about  45%  of  the  unemployed.  This  would  amount  to \nNRs86 million per annum but leave an annual income deficit of NRs482 million in the first year. \n \n16. \nFamily incomes are expected to rise to NRs964 million in the second year. The addition \nof project works of NRs86 million would raise total income to NRs1,050 million\u2014still a deficit of \nNRs211  million  compared  to  before  the  disaster.  In  the  third  year,  total  family  income  is \nexpected \nto  reach \nNRs1,246 million.  At  this  point  all  families,  apart  from  those  that  lost  their  land,  would  be \nrestored to pre-disaster income levels.  \n\nto  be  NRs1,200  million,  and  by \n\nis  projected \n\nfourth  year \n\nthe \n\nit \n\n \n\n\fSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n \n\nCountry/Project Title: Nepal/Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project  \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n61 \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nProject grant \n\n \n\n \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\n \n\n \n\nSouth Asia Regional Department/ \nNepal Resident Mission \n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nA.   Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy. \n \n \nPoverty in Nepal is evident as 31% of its population lives below the poverty line. Poverty incidence declined from 42% to 31% \naccording  to  the  National  Living  Standard  Survey  from  FY1996  to  FY2004.a Disparity  in  income  poverty  has  actually  widen. \nThe  reduction  in  poverty  was  disproportionately  distributed  across  regions  and  in  different  caste,  ethnic,  and  marginalized \ngroups. The survey data showed a strong correlation between poverty incidence and people regionally and socially excluded. \nThe  poverty  incidence  varies  across  geographical  regions;  rural  and  urban  locations;  and  identity  (gender,  caste,  and \nethnicity).  Poverty  is  higher  in  rural  areas,  mid-western  (45%),  and  far  western  (41%)  regions;  and  among  socially  excluded \ngroups (Dalits, Janajatis, and Muslims). Poverty incidence is 46% in dalits, 44% in hill indigenous people, and 46% in religious \nminority Muslims.  \n \nThe Koshi river flood inundated 4 village development committees (VDCs) of Sunsari district, located in the eastern region of \nthe  country.  Shreepur,  Haripur,  Paschim  Kusaha,  and  Laukahi  VDCs  of  Sunsari  were  severely  hit\u2014causing  heavy  damage \nand displacing thousands. The flood damaged highways, farmlands, schools, irrigation schemes, water supply and sewerage, \nand  other  infrastructure;  and  displaced  47,000  people  with  huge  loss  of  houses,  standing  crops,  and  livestock.  The \nGovernment has assumed that the number of internally displaced people can reach up to 60,000 who will be in dire need of \nsupport. In addition, 40% of the displaced will not be able to return home without a long-term resettlement plan. Disadvantaged \ngroup  mapping\u2014based  on  food  sufficiency,  access  to  health  and  education,  and  prevalence  of  vulnerable  and  marginalized \ngroups\u2014shows  Shreepur  VDC  as  the  most  disadvantaged  followed  by  Haripur,  Pashim  Kusaha,  and  Laukahi.  Damages  in \nShreepur  and  Haripur  VDCs  are  more  extensive  than  in  the  other  two  VDCs.  The  flood  in  Kailali  and  Kanchanpur  districts \nlocated  in  the  far  western  region  also  affected  nearly  43,500  people  and  heavily  damaged  water  supply  systems,  irrigation \ncanals, school buildings, and part of the highway. The damage is scattered in many of the VDCs. In these two districts, some \n7,000 people living near the rivers were displaced\u2014mostly Mukta Kamaiya (freed bonded labors) and marginalized indigenous \npeople. In three districts, more than 35,000 farm households have been adversely affected, directly increasing risks in people\u2019s \nlong-term livelihoods. In the human poverty index, Sunsari is 8th out of 75 districts, Kanchanpur is 15th, and Kailali is in 24th \nplace.b However, there could be adverse flood impacts in the districts if timely rehabilitation measures are not taken.  \n \nSupport in the rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure  will be critical to restoring the normal life and activities of the affected \npeople.  This  emergency  project\u2014covering  road,  irrigation,  agriculture,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation\u2014will  contribute  in \nreducing the vulnerability and risks of the affected people, displaced, poor, and disadvantaged. All sectoral support will have \npoverty implications through rehabilitation of the damaged infrastructure and reclamation of farmland as a means of livelihood, \nand improvement of the services that will have direct impact on affected people\u2019s lives. The support will mitigate risks of likely \nimpoverishment The Project will assist and complement the Government\u2019s return strategy plan for Koshi-displaced people. \n \nThe project design includes features that will help reduce poverty directly or indirectly. It will provide short-term employment to \npoor  women  and  men  in  skilled  and  unskilled  labor-intensive  construction  works  in  the  rehabilitation  of  damaged  road  and \nirrigation  infrastructure.  Social  mobilization  activities  will  be  integrated,  which  will  improve  the  group  organization  and \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  in  the  reconstruction  of  damaged  irrigation  and  water  supply \ninfrastructure\u2014empowering  them  to  access  services.  Rehabilitation  of  highways  and  rural  roads  will  contribute  to  smooth \ntransportation of goods and services to market, and ease economic activities\u2014creating employment opportunities for the poor. \nAgriculture  support  will  be  provided  to  the  poor  and  affected  farmers,  integrated  with  irrigation  measures,  free  of  cost  for  a   \n1-year cropping cycle so that they will be able to restore farm work and generate an income.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n62  \n \nSupport for income-generation activities  will be extended to the landless and poor farmers based on their demand. Irrigation \nmeasures will be taken to cope with the immediate need for restoring the land, and to support livelihoods by providing shallow \ntube wells which will benefit the poor and marginal farmers. Rehabilitation of farmer-managed irrigation canals, including large \nschemes,  will  help  regain  the  long-term  sustainability  of  agriculture  production\u2014providing  benefits  to  all  users.  Water  sector \ninputs  will rehabilitate the  damaged schemes by improving the quality and services\u2014extending the services to the  poor  and \nmarginalized  groups,  with  sanitation  and  hygiene  integral  to  the  process.  Access  to  drinking  water  and  sanitation  will  help \nwomen and poor households save time for other economic activities and reduce their work burden. In all four affected VDCs in \nSunsari, service will be provided through a phased approach that will complement the Government\u2019s home return package. In \nSunsari VDCs, shallow tube wells will be installed to provide immediate access to drinking water. In Kailali and Kanchanpur, \ngravity-fed damaged schemes will be rehabilitated, supporting the construction of household latrines. Social mobilization will be \nintegrated to ensure social inclusion in user committees in terms of gender, caste, ethnicity, and other disadvantaged groups; \nand for effective and sustainable management of the rehabilitated schemes.   \n \nAll sectoral components will have poverty implications via support for the rehabilitation of major infrastructure directly related to \npeople\u2019s livelihoods and living conditions. The Project will assist the Government to implement its flood relief and rehabilitation \nprogram  to  respond  to  the  flood  impacts  through  medium-term  support.  It  will  be  in  line  with  National  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy in terms of overall long-term poverty impacts.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                 Targeting Classification: Geographic intervention  \n \n1.  Key Issues \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Koshi  flood  was  hardest  for  the  displaced  people  who  need  long-term  support.  The  people  who  want  to \nreturn home might face deprivation in the absence of immediate needs such as basic services, food,  water, and  livelihoods. \nHeavy damage to some farmland in Koshi-affected VDCs require a long-term restoration program to bring the land back to its \nnormal productivity. Until then, displaced people from those areas require a long-term livelihoods program for their living. In all \nthree districts, the poorest, women, children, and marginalized groups were badly affected. They suffered more after the flood \nin terms of food access, health services, and personal security; and their situation could worsen if rehabilitation support is not \nprovided on time. Among the affected, the landless, Mukta Kamaiya, and other indigenous and minority groups will suffer long-\nterm  impacts  in  terms  of  livelihood,  housing,  health,  and  food  security.  Hundreds  of  families  are  still  living  in  the  emergency \ncamps  in  Sunsari  and  are  not  able  to  return  without  a  proper  return  package.  The  Government  has  announced  a  return \npackage of NRs50,000 to each Koshi-displaced family but the returnees need other support to restore livelihoods. \n \n2.   Design Features \n \nThe project design includes features to help reduce poverty directly or indirectly. It will \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nprovide short-term employment to poor women and men in skilled and unskilled labor-intensive construction works; \ncontribute to smooth transportation of goods and services to market, improving the access of the poor to services;  \nimprove  the  participation  of  the  poor  and  marginalized  in  user  committees  of  rehabilitated  infrastructure  supported \nthrough social mobilization; and \n\n(iv)  provide  an  integrated  agriculture  and  irrigation  support  package  for  a  1-year  cropping  cycle,  free  for  all  affected \n\npeople for livelihood improvements. \n\nC.   Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n\n  Not applicable \n\n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe  Koshi  flood  impact  was  severe  for  the  affected  people,  especially  the  poor,  as  many  required  immediate  shelter,  food, \nwater,  and  health  services.  The  floods  in  the  far  western  districts  also  affected  the  poor,  landless,  and  marginalized  who \nrequire  short-  and  long-term  rehabilitation  support.  With  the  help  of  United  Nations  (UN)  agencies  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), the Government provided emergency relief support to the displaced with shelter, food, drinking water, \nand health clinics. In December 2008, the Government announced a return strategy plan for displaced people. It has assumed \nthat about 60% of Koshi displaced people can return home. The remaining 40% has a high level of damage to their houses \nand farmlands, so their return may be delayed. Some 25% of the displaced people do not have recoverable land, and some \nare  landless  and  require  a  long-term  resettlement  plan.  In  Kailali  and  Kanchanpur,  displaced  Mukta  Kamaiya  and  other \nmarginalized  communities  need  resettlement  support.  The  displaced  people  need  a  government  resettlement  support  and \nreturn package that will assist them to rehabilitate houses, farmlands, and basic infrastructure. Employment is a high priority for \nthe  poor  and  those  not  able  to  return  home  soon.  Health  impacts  of  the  flood  also  require  urgent  attention,  especially  for \npregnant and lactating women, children, the elderly, and the poorest. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n63 \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n \nThe  flood  damage  and  needs  assessment  and  the  design  of  the  Project  involved  consultations  at  different  levels  with  key \nstakeholders,  including  central  government  officials,  district  offices,  flood-affected  people,  and  local  political  and  community \nleaders.  The  consultations  were  conducted  jointly  with  the  Government  and  UN  agencies  providing  relief  support  to  the \naffected and displaced people. All the executing and implementing agencies were consulted. The findings of the assessment \nwere  shared  with  UN  partners  to  identify  the  areas  of  support.  Based  on  the  Government\u2019s  proposals  in  different  sectors,  a \nfield assessment was carried out and consultations were conducted with district stakeholders to verify the proposed activities \nwith requirements on the ground. After field verification, ADB and the Government agreed on the areas to be supported by the \nProject.  The  priorities  were  set  jointly  and  the  project  components  were  identified  and  discussed  with  all  major  stakeholders \nduring  the  assessment  and  fact-finding  mission.  The  Government  prioritized  infrastructure  rehabilitation,  mainly  roads  (rural \nand highways), bridges, culverts, water and sanitation, recovery of irrigation schemes, and damaged farmland. Implementation \narrangements  for  project  implementation  were  also  discussed  during  the  fact-finding  mission  to  ensure  effective  service \ndelivery  and  minimize  administrative  problems.  Mechanisms  to  ensure  the  participation  of  the  poor  and  women  were \nemphasized  to  integrate  their  needs  in  all  project  components.  Social  mobilization  has  been  recognized  as  an  essential \nelement in the water and agriculture components. \n \n \n\n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment  \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n\n \n \n \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, consultant \ninput, etc.). If no, explain why.  \n \nAs the Project is for emergency assistance, the project duration will be 36 months. Because of the inability to undertake civil \nworks during the wet season, the project period was extended 12 months beyond the 2-year project period generally expected \nunder the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004). The agreed implementation \nschedule  recognizes  the  critical  importance  of  restoring  key  infrastructure  as  much  as  possible  before  the  onset  of  the  next \nrainy  season  in  July  2010.  The  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  will  be  the  main  executing  agency,  supported  by  a \nproject coordination office. Project implementation units will be established in the key implementing agencies\u2014Department of \nAgriculture, Department of Irrigation, Department of Water Supply and Sewerage, and Department of Roads. Consultants with \nexpertise  in  project  management,  financial  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  environment,  resettlement,  and  social \ndevelopment  will  be  hired  to  support  the  project  coordination  office  and  project  implementation  units.  The  planning, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  processes  will  ensure  the  participation  of  all  stakeholders,  including  the  local  development \nagencies, NGOs, affected people, and relevant organizations. The concerns of women, the poorest, and disadvantaged caste \nand ethnic groups will be well integrated through participatory consultative approaches. A project steering committee\u2014chaired \nby  the  secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works,  and  including  the  line  ministries\u2014will  be  established  to \nprovide overall project coordination and facilitate project implementation. The total cost to be supported by ADB for the Project \nis $25.6 million.  \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues   \n\nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  The  Project  will  have  positive  impacts  on  women.  The  rehabilitation  of  damaged \nwater supply schemes will greatly support women by reducing their work burden. A hygiene and sanitation program, integrated \nwith a water component, will help raise women\u2019s awareness of cleanliness and use of latrines, which will have direct impact on \nfamily  health.  Short-term  employment  created  during  rehabilitation  of  damaged  infrastructure  will  provide  employment  to \nwomen  and  increase  their  access  to  income  sources.  Women  will  be  encouraged  to  play  an  active  role  in  decision  making \nthrough their participation in water user committees, farmer groups, and committees formed for operation and maintenance of \nthe  rehabilitated  infrastructure.  Women  will  receive  equal  wages  to  those  of  men  for  equal  work  performed  in  construction \nworks. Agriculture activities  will support women  with training and knowledge related to farm activities. Free agriculture inputs \nwill  help  women  to  access  productive  resources,  which  this  will  be  a  particularly  large  support  for  poor  female-headed \nhouseholds to restore their incomes. \n \n\n2.  Key  Actions.  Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and  women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to \n\nand use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan    \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nWomen\u2019s  participation  and  representation  in  decision  making  will  be  ensured  in  user  committees  of  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation, agriculture, and irrigation programs. Gender issues will be analyzed in each component while developing the plans \nand during implementation to ensure equal benefit to women from the project services and resources. Data disaggregated by \ngender,  caste,  and  ethnicity  will  be  collected  and  reported.  Through  community  mobilization  activities,  women  and \ndisadvantaged  groups  will  be  actively  involved  in  works  that  directly  benefit  them  in  terms  of  employment  and  income \ngeneration. They will participate actively in user groups and committees to obtain equal benefits from project resources. \n \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n64  \n \n\nIssue \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n \n\nSignificant/ \nLimited/ \nNo Impact \n\nLimited \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n \n \n\nLimited \npositive impact \n\nLimited \nPositive impact \n\nNo impact \n\nLimited \npositive imapct \n\nLabor \n\n Employment \n     opportunities \n\n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\n \nAffordability \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers (Natural \n    Calamities-flood)  \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \nMost of the rehabilitation works are expected to \nbe limited within their existing corridor of \nimpacts; some of them may require additional \nland and/or involve resettlement impacts. For \nany land acquisition and resettlement impacts, a \nresettlement plan will be prepared following the \nguidelines provided in the resettlement \nframework (Supplementary Appendix F).  \nIndigenous people living in the project areas will \nbenefit from the improved infrastructure and \nessential inputs. Any potential adverse effects on \nindigenous people, if identified, will be \naddressed during planning and implementation \nof the Project through the resettlement plan. The \nProject will ensure the participation of identified \nindigenous people in planning, implementation, \nand monitoring of the Project to ensure that they \nbenefit from the infrastructure rehabilitation. \nThe Project will create short-term employment \nopportunities in infrastructure construction and \nmaintenance for poor unskilled and skilled \nlaborers. It will benefit both women and men. It \nwill also help reduce unemployment caused by \nthe floods.  \nThe Project will help to improve connectivity and \nprovide better access to basic infrastructure, \nrestoring people\u2019s normal economic activities.  \nAs vulnerability and risks still exist, a flood \npreparedness plan will be prepared under the \nproject activities. \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement  \n\n       Framework \n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous \n\n       Peoples Framework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action  \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\n \nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?   x  Yes      No      \n\nIV.
