The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Selection \n\n2. \nThrough  discussions  with  Holcim  Limited  (the  parent  company  of  the  sponsor),  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identified  the  project.  In  2008,  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development (EBRD), a minority shareholder in Garadagh Cement, was \nmandated as senior debt arranger.  EBRD approached ADB for the remaining parallel senior \ntranche. \n  \n3. \nThere  are  limited  private  sector  investment  opportunities  in  Azerbaijan  outside  of  the \noil  and  gas  sector,  and  the  project  represents  the  first  opportunity  for  ADB  to  provide  direct \nassistance  to  Azerbaijan's  private  sector  economy  in  an  industry  that  directly  supports \ninfrastructure  development.  ADB's  participation  in  this  project  will  complement  the  EBRD's \nassistance  and  catalyze  more  private  sector  investment  in  Azerbaijan's  infrastructure  sector \nby  highlighting  attractive  investments  outside  of  the  oil  and  gas  sector.  A  private  sector \nsolution to cement supply is ideal since consumer prices are driven by production costs, and \nprivate  enterprises,  which  compete  for  market  share  by  reducing  costs,  can  expand  the \nmarket supply. \n \nB. \n\nSector Background \n\n4. \nBetween  2005  and  2008,  Azerbaijan's  economy  was  one  of  the  fastest  growing  in  the \nworld, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimated at 10.8%.1 Net exports, primarily oil \nand gas, are the major drivers of growth; however, inward investment contributed a significant \n19%  of  GDP  in  2008.  Signs  of  economic  recovery  have  emerged,  with  a  per  annum  GDP \ngrowth  rate  in  2009  of  an  impressive  9.3%,  a  much  stronger  result  than  Azerbaijan's  peers  in \nthe region. GDP growth of 7.4% is expected in 2010.2 This performance reflects a recovery in oil \nprices  and  improved  global  economic  output.  Despite  some  recent  cuts,  overall  budget \nexpenditures\u2014in particular for infrastructure and social spending\u2014have increased as a result of \nthe Government of Azerbaijan's crisis response, resulting in an estimated budget deficit of 2% in \nthe first half of 2009.3 \n \nThis investment growth was led by construction, which expanded by 36% during 2009, \n5. \nmostly through increases in secondary-town and rural infrastructure, residential and commercial \nbuilding  construction,  and  transportation  infrastructure.  Although  the  government  intends  to \nreduce investment spending in the medium term, the 2009 budget moderately increased capital \ninvestment  in  roads,  urban  infrastructure,  water  supply,  and  sanitation.  This  public  investment \nwill  become  the  single-largest  source  of  GDP  growth,  accounting  for  about  60%  of  total \ninvestments (footnote 2). Though the domestic economy is growing strongly, overall reliance on \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009. Asian Development Outlook 2009. Manila. \n2  Standard & Poor's. 2010. Azerbaijan (Republic of). London (March). \n3  EBRD. 2009. Transition Report, 2009. London. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\nimports grew at 19.4% in 2008, led by increased public spending for infrastructure refurbishment \nrequiring substantial imports of machinery, equipment, and construction materials.  \n \n6. \nEmphasis  on  infrastructure  refurbishment  and  general  construction  has  fuelled  strong \ngrowth in cement consumption, averaging a 15% compounded annual growth rate from 2004 to \n2008.4 Azerbaijan's  recent  boom  in  oil  and  gas  exports  has  driven  substantial  investment  in \npublic  and  private  sector  construction,  which  had  been  neglected  during  many  years  of \nunderinvestment.  The  main  drivers  for  cement  consumption  include  ongoing  demand  for \nresidential and commercial construction, which lags far behind eastern Europe and the Russian \nFederation  in  terms  of  interior  area  per  occupant,  and  increased  government  spending  for \ninfrastructure, which is expected to increase to 35% of total domestic construction spending by \n2011  (footnote  3).  However,  due  to  the  global  crisis,  there  was  a  reduction  in  demand  in  late \n2008 and 2009, which affected near-term growth assumptions and demand. Several public and \nprivate  projects  in  the  planning  and  development  phase  may  have  been  put  on  hold,  but \nconstruction on those projects already under way continued.  \n \nIn 2008, domestic cement consumption in Azerbaijan was 3.2 million tons, representing \n7. \n374 kilograms (kg) per capita. This compares similarly  with per capita consumption in Eastern \nEurope  but  is  considerably  less  than  in  other  countries  in  the  region  undergoing  significant \nconstruction and infrastructure rehabilitation, such as Kazakhstan (608 kg per capita), Iran (475 \nkg  per  capita),  and  the  Russian  Federation  (420  kg  per  capita).  The  total  installed  cement \ncapacity in Azerbaijan, consisting of a cement plant and grinding stations, left a supply deficit of \n1.27 million tons in 2008, increasing the country's dependence on imports. Based on GDP per \ncapita  growth  trends,  cement  consumption  is  expected  to  grow  by  5.8%  per  year  up  to  2012, \nleading  to  a  consumption  rate  of  505  kg  per  capita  (footnote  2),  a  rate  more  in  line  with \nbenchmarks  in  similar  countries.  Appendix  4  contains  a  more  thorough  description  of  the \ncement industry and the key drivers. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  private  sector  development  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s \n8. \nStrategy  2020. 5  This  financing  supports  the  expansion  and  energy  efficiency  upgrading  of \nAzerbaijan's  first  privatized  integrated  cement  manufacturer.  It  promotes  environmentally \nsustainable  growth  by  facilitating  the  transfer  of  modern  technology  to  a  developing  member \ncountry,  improving  production  capacity,  and  reducing  environmental  impacts  such  as  carbon \nemission  intensity,  particulate  matter  and  nitrous  oxides  (NOx)  emissions,  and  wastewater \ndischarge.  The  project's  energy  efficiency  improvements  also  contribute  to  environmentally \nsustainable growth to arrest climate change in the region. ADB is working with the EBRD on this \nprivate  sector  transaction,  broadening  its  partnerships  with  key  development  agencies  in \ndeveloping  member  countries  beyond  the  official  development  assistance  window.  This  is \nconsistent  with  two  of  the  drivers  of  change\u2014private  sector  operations  and  partnerships\u2014as \ndescribed in Strategy 2020 for ADB to be a better and more active development partner. \n  \n\n                                                \n4  Garadagh Cement. 2009. Information Memorandum New Dry Kiln 6 Project. Baku. \n5  ADB. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy \n\n9. \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Azerbaijan \n(last updated in 2006), which emphasizes promoting economic growth outside of the oil and gas \nsector.6 The  project,  through  its  supply  of  crucial  cement  products  to  large  local  contractors \n(mainly in transportation, commercial development, and urban development) also supports the \nCSP's emphasis on strengthening the transport and urban development sectors. The CSP also \naims  to  achieve  close  cooperation  with  the  EBRD  in  Azerbaijan.  Once  approved,  this  will  be \nADB's first nonsovereign infrastructure financing in Azerbaijan. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with the Energy Policy \n\nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy, 7  which  advocates  technology \n10. \ntransfer  in  energy  efficiency  projects,  thus  consistent  with  Holcim's  role  as  both  foreign  direct \ninvestor and technology enabler. Through this transfer of modern dry kiln technology, the project \nserves  as  a  demonstration  project  for  the  Caucasus  and  Central  Asia  and  contributes  to  a \nreduction  in  fuel  consumption  per  ton  of  cement  produced.  However,  because  of  the \ngovernment's new domestic natural gas pricing policy,8 Garadagh Cement is likely to eventually \nswitch  (or  dual  fire)  from  natural  gas  to  domestic  petroleum  coke  (petcoke)  or  imported  coal. \nThe coal ash is incorporated into the clinker, and therefore the clinker factor will remain nearly \nthe same. The coal has the effect that the ash substitutes part of the clay as raw material, and \nthe raw mix will be slightly adjusted to consider the coal ash. With petcoke, the ash content is \nvery low and these ash effects are even smaller. The differences in energy (megajoules per ton) \nbetween  natural  gas  and  coal  or  petcoke  are  small.  The  new  gas  pricing  regime  intends  to \nmatch the value of export demand with the country's abundant natural gas supply. The project \nalso employs state-of-the-art baghouse filtration and low NOx burners to substantially reduce air \nemissions  and  effluent  discharge  below  current  levels  and  achieve  compliance  with  the \nEuropean  Union,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation  industry \nbenchmarks. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsor \n\nThe  borrower,  Garadagh  Cement  is  majority  owned  by  Holcim  Limited,  the  world's \n11. \nlargest  suppliers  of  cement  and  aggregates,  based  in  Zurich,  Switzerland  (Appendix  3). 9 \nGaradagh Cement operates the only integrated clinker and grinding cement plant in Azerbaijan \nwith  cement  sales  of  1.15  million  tons  in  2009.  The  remainder  of  the  market  share  is  held  by \nlocal grinding stations (using imported clinker mainly from Georgia and Turkey) and by cement \nimports from Georgia, Iran, the Russian Federation, Turkey, and other Central Asian countries. \nThe project will increase clinker capacity from 2,616 tons per day (TPD) to 4,000 TPD, replace \n\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2006. Azerbaijan: Country Strategy and Program Update, 2005\u20132006. Manila. \n7   ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n8  The Government of Azerbaijan increased natural gas prices by 112% in 2007 to reflect international market prices. \nA  similarly  large  price  increase  is  expected  in  2009,  which  could  amount  to  as  much  as  267%  as  the  State  Oil \nCompany of Azerbaijan attempts to equalize Azeri natural gas prices to its primary export markets in Turkey and \nGeorgia (Source: United Press International. 11 August 2009). \n\n9  Shares of the company are owned by both Holcim Limited and Holcim Auslandbeteiligungs, one of its intermediary \n\nholding companies incorporated in Germany.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\nthe existing four wet-type kilns with one new modern dry-type kiln, and raise annual production \nof cement from 1.3 million tons per annum (TPA) to 1.7 million TPA. At the same time, the more \nenergy efficient dry kiln will reduce the specific fuel consumption. \n \nIn  addition  to  being  the  only  integrated  clinker-to-cement  producer,  Garadagh  Cement \n12. \nhas  unique  advantages  over  domestic  competitors  in  that  it  owns  substantial  reserves  of  raw \nmaterials. Garadagh Cement has secured access to three sources of limestone, one of the key \nraw materials for clinker production. The first source is limestone waste from an adjacent stone \ncutting  operation,  which  currently  supplies  the  majority  of  Garadagh  Cement's  limestoneThe \nsecond source is extracting limestone at the currently dormant Shakhgaya-West quarry, owned \nby  Garadagh  Cement.  The  scope  of  the  project  includes  recommissioning  this  quarry  and \ntransporting  limestone  to  the  cement  plant  by  rehabilitating  an  existing  15-kilometer  (km) \ndedicated rail line. The third source is to develop another quarry owned by Garadagh Cement at \nCaravan  Sarai  adjacent  to  the  Shakhgaya-West  quarry.  Clay,  the  other  key  raw  material  for \nclinker production, is sourced from a clay and shale and owned by Garadagh Cement.  \n  \nCompetitive  benchmarking  conducted  by  AC  Nielsen  in  2008  found  that  Garadagh \n13. \nCement  has  100%  brand  awareness \nits  geographical  markets  and  a  marketing \neffectiveness10 in the Baku region of 94%, compared with 20%\u201360% for its top four competitors. \nSales  staff  are  trained  through  four  modules  each  year  on  selling  the  right  cement  (and \nstrength)  for  the  right  application  to  customers  and  substantiating  Garadagh  Cement's  price \npremium.  The  company  holds  technical  seminars  for  contractors  on  the  benefit  of  its  sulfate-\nresistant cement, which is ideal to combat the aggressive climatic conditions that result from the \nhigh salinity of the Caspian Sea. More details on the sponsor can be found in Appendix 3, and \non Garadagh Cement in Appendix 4. \n \n\nin \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe  project  scope  consists  of  a  new  five-stage  precalciner  preheater,  a  rotary  dry  kiln \n14. \nwith  modern grate  cooler,  a  vertical  roller  mill,  upgrades  to  three  cement  mills,  reopening  of  a \nnearby limestone quarry, and new cement storage facilities and associated plant infrastructure \n(Table  1).  The  cement  mills  are  relatively  simple  ball  mill  devices  consisting  of  a  steel  vessel, \nsteel  mill  balls,  and  electric  motor  drives;  with  regular  maintenance  and  periodic  efficiency \nimprovements  they  can  be  operated  over  the  long-term.  The  kiln  system  of  the  project  will  be \nconstructed  by  CBMI  Construction  Company  (CBMI)  under  a  fixed-price  turnkey  engineering, \nprocurement, and construction (EPC) contract which was awarded through competitive bidding. \nA number of key components will be supplied by European suppliers with interfacing facilitated \nby the Holcim Group Services (HGRS) team based in Switzerland. Project scope outside of the \nkiln system, including the dedicated rail line rehabilitation, quarry crusher facilities, cement mill \nupgrades,  and  office  building  upgrades,  are  contracted  directly  by  Garadagh  Cement  to  local \ncontractors. \n\nTable 1: Project Scope \n\nProcess Step \n\nRaw material extraction \n\nLocation \n\nShakhgaya West \nQuarry \n\nDescription \n\nMobile equipment, limestone crushing plant, and \nrail loading station; rail and road refurbishment \nfrom the quarry to main plant \n\n                                                \n10  Marketing  effectiveness  is  a  composite  score  indicating  the  company's  performance  in  a  range  of  categories \nincluding  the  number  of  customers  who  are  recommenders,  price  premium,  social  responsibility,  advertising \neffectiveness, perceived competence, safety, product quality, and delivery. \n\n\fRaw material preparation  Plant site production \n\nRaw meal preparation \n\nClinker production \n\nCement production \n\narea \n\nPlant site production \narea \nPlant site production \narea \n\nProduct dispatch \narea \n\n \n\n5 \n\nRail unloading station; preblending and storage \nhalls for 24,000 tons of limestone, 2x3,600 tons of \nclay, and 2x600 tons of iron correctives \nVertical roller mill with 8,000 ton homogenizing \nsilo \n4,000 ton/day coal-fired dry kiln with a single \nstring five-stage precalciner preheater, emissions \ncontrol equipment, and 75,000 ton clinker storage \nUpgrade of three cement mills to closed circuit \nand replacement of nine cement mill drives; \n16,000 ton multicell cement silo and two bulk truck \nloaders \nSolid fuel storage hall for 5,000 tons of coal and/or \n5,000 tons of petcoke; vertical roller mill for \ngrinding 26 tons/hour of coal or 21 tons/hour of \npetcoke \n\nPlant storage area \n \n\nFuels handling \n \n \n \nSource: Garadagh Cement. \n \n15. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  project  including  contingencies  is  \u20ac325  million  ($442  million \nequivalent), of which the sponsor is contributing 57%, or \u20ac185 million ($251 million equivalent), \nas equity, sourced mostly by cash flow from operations and subordinated debt from Holcim.  \n \n16. \nThe project provides substantial energy efficiency gains by switching clinker production \nfrom  wet  to  dry  process  and  reducing  fuel  consumption.  However,  electricity  consumption  will \nslightly  increase  by  replacing  the  wet  process  slurry  preparation  with  raw  materials  grinding, \nwhich requires more electrical energy. Overall average electricity consumption will increase by \n19%  from  61.2  kWh  per  ton  of  clinker  to  72.8  kWh,  and  will  be  supplied  by  a  new  80,000 \nkilovolt-ampere  (kVA)  substation  installed  and  commissioned  by Garadagh  Cement  in  2009  to \nstep down power from the 11 kilovolt (kV) utility distribution line to the dry kiln and existing 4,160 \nkV cement plant circuit.  \n \n17. \ndesigned to also be able to use alternative fuel resources to fire the kiln.  \n \n\nIn  accordance  with  Holcim  corporate  environmental  objectives,  the  project  has  been \n\n3. \n\nProject Outputs and Outcome \n\n18. \nThe project outputs will be 4,000 tons per day (1.24 million TPA) of clinker production by \nthe end of the second quarter of 2011, yielding 1.7 millions TPA of cement, and a decrease in \nspecific fuel consumption per unit of clinker produced. The expansion, upgrade, and operation \nof the project will be in compliance with ADB and EBRD environmental and social safeguards. \n \nThe  project  outcome  will  be  an  expanded  and  more  efficient  domestic  cement  supply \n19. \nindicated  by  reduced  per-unit  fuel  consumption,  increased  domestic  cement  supply  from  1.3 \nmillion TPA to 1.7 million TPA, the creation of jobs during construction, and upgrading of skills \nfor operating staff. Beyond the stated outcome, the project will also demonstrate that Azerbaijan \nis  conducive  to  foreign  direct  investment  and  privatization  of  major  state-owned  enterprises \noutside of the oil and gas sector. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n6 \n \n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nContribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\nThe  project  will  achieve  significant  energy  savings  through  the  use  of  sustainable  and \n20. \nenvironmentally  friendly  dry  kiln  technology,  resulting  in  a  reduction  in  energy  use  per  unit  of \nclinker  produced.  Dry  kiln  technology  will  be  transferred  from  a  developed  economy  and  the \nskills of local operations staff will be upgraded so they are trained to operate a state-of-the-art \nproduction  facility.  Supply  of  high-quality  indigenous  cement  will  support  the  government's \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  (specifically  roads,  bridges,  ports,  and  water  supply).  The \ngovernment  has  indicated  capital  expenditure  plans  of  $3.7  billion  for  infrastructure  projects  in \n2010. Many of these projects are intended to support agribusiness, trade, tourism, and regional \nintegration  so  that  the  economy  diversifies  its  sources  of  growth  outside  of  the  oil  and  gas \nsector. \n \n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n21. \nThe  assistance  of  ADB  and  the  EBRD  facilitates  foreign  direct  investment  by  an \ninternational  sponsor  with  the  highest  corporate  governance  standards,  and  the  project \npromotes private sector participation outside of the country's dominant oil and gas sector. The \nproject  ensures  a  sustainable  local  supply  of  high-quality  cement,  which  will  support  the \ngovernment's  investments  in  the  transport,  water,  and  urban  infrastructure  sectors  and  other \ncommercial development, including tourism.  \n \nThe  assistance  is  aligned  with  the  private  sector  development  goals  of  one  of  the \n22. \ncompany's  shareholders,  Azerbaijan  Investment  Company,  which  is  mandated  by  the \nAzerbaijan  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  to  develop  the  private  sector  outside  of  the  oil \nand gas sector in order to enhance the country's long-term sustainability. This diversification is \ncritical to promoting inclusive growth and reducing poverty in Azerbaijan. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n23. \nADB  has  classified  the  project  as  environmental  category  A,  and  the  borrower  has \nconducted a full environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA). The ESIA was posted on \nthe company's website11 on 19 November 2008 and the full document was reposted on ADB's \nwebsite on 19 December 2009 as per the requirements of ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement.12 \nHard copies in Azeri were supplied to the settlements of Sahil and Umid and the EBRD resident \noffice  in  Baku.  A  local  consulting  company  prepared  an  environmental  impact  assessment  for \napplication  to  the  Azerbaijan  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Natural  Resources  for  environmental \napproval.  \n \n24. \nThe  ESIA  report  contains  detailed  findings  of  likely  environmental  and  social  impacts \nassociated  with  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project.  The  ESIA  has  established  an \nenvironmental  and  social  management  plan  (ESMP),  setting  forth  avoidance  and  mitigation \nmeasures  and  monitoring  for  identified  impacts.  Despite  a  substantial  increase  in  production \ncapacity,  and the  likely switch  from gas to  coal,  the  project  will  have  a  reduced  net  air  impact \n\n                                                \n11    http://www.garadagh.com \n12    ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\ncompared to the existing plant in terms of NOx and particular matter. Results from the dispersion \nmodel show no further mitigation measures are required to reduce stack emissions beyond the \nuse  of  low  NOx  burners  and  high-efficiency  bag  filters  for  particular  matter,  as  designed.  The \nmodeling predicts that the emissions will meet the applicable emission and ambient air quality \nlevels laid out in the national standards and in the World Bank's Environment, Health and Safety \nguidelines. \n \nTotal  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  from  production  will  increase  from  0.74  million \n25. \nTPA to  1.04 million  TPA.  However,  emissions  intensity  (CO2 emissions  per  ton  of  cement)  will \ndecrease by 4% on a gross emissions basis and 1% on a net emissions basis, from 594 kg per \nton of cement for the gas-fired wet kiln process to 587 kg per ton of cement for the coal-fired dry \nkiln  process.  Though  the  project  is  switching  to  a  more  carbon-intensive  fuel  for  economic \nreasons,  carbon  emissions  are  being  reduced  through  energy  efficiency  and  reduced  clinker \nfactor (using fly ash from coal combustion in cement, which reduces the proportion of clinker in \nthe final cement product) as compared to operation of the four wet kilns for the same production \ncapacity.  NOx  emissions  are  less  than  500  milligrams  (mg)  per  ton.  The  wet  kilns  will  be \ndecommissioned no later than 2 years from commercial operation of the dry kiln.13  \n \n26. \nThe existing wet kiln process uses a substantial amount of water (600,000 cubic meters \n[m3] per year) for production. The dry kiln will consume 65% less water compared to the existing \noperation. While the present operation uses treated wastewater, the use of fresh water from the \nmain  pipeline  will  be  necessary.  However,  a  water-saving,  closed  water  cycle  is  planned  for \nproduction. The wastewater discharge will be reduced by about 56% compared to the present \noperation.  Effluent  from  the  project  will  be  treated  at  a  new  on-site  treatment  plant  to \ninternational  effluent  standards.  Further  details  on  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation \nmeasures are described in the ESIA in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n27. \nIn 2003, the company implemented an environmental management system according to \nISO 14001 in parallel with the ISO 9001 quality management system. The company has a unit \nfor  operational  health  and  safety  and  environmental  and  security  issues.  The  plant  runs  an \nestablished occupational health and safety management system in line with Holcim's corporate \npolicy.  Clear  organizational  accountabilities  are  supporting  by  a  program  of \ntraining, \ncommunication, strict procedural discipline, and locally developed policies and action plans. \n \n28. \nThe existing occupational health and safety system will be transferred to the operation of \nkiln  6,  including  the  quarry  activities.  In  addition,  the  project  will  implement  an  ESMP  which \nincludes management and monitoring activities to address issues and mitigate impacts. Overall \nresponsibility  for  the  implementation  of  the  ESMP  lies  with  Garadagh  Cement  for  all  project \nphases, including compliance by all contractors. Special awareness training will be provided for \nemployees  working  with  new  or  modified  equipment  relating  to  the  dry  kiln.  Semiannual \nmonitoring reports will be submitted to the senior lenders during construction in line with ADB's \nrequirements, and annual reports will be submitted thereafter (including details on greenhouse \ngas emissions). The reports shall cover all aspects of environmental, health, and safety-related \naspects  such  as  permits,  status  of  compliance  with  obligations,  and  any  corrective  measures \nrequired. \n \n\n                                                \n13  Failure to comply with this covenant will result in an event of default in the EBRD loan agreement. This shall be \n\nreplicated in ADB's loan covenants. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n8 \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n29. \nAs described in the ESIA, no land acquisition is required for the project, other than a few \ndiscontinuous  parcels  of  government  land  adjacent  to  the  plant  boundary  wall.14 The  new  dry \nkiln will be built within the Garadagh Cement plant premises (approximately 52 hectares) and all \nland is owned by Garadagh Cement. Due to the arid conditions, there is no notable agricultural \nuse,  except  small-scale  herding  of  goats  and  sheep.  The  reopening  of  the  Shakhgaya-West \nlimestone  quarry  results  in  no  land  use  impacts  since  the  area  comprises  arid  land,  which  is \nneither under permanent nor temporary use. The rail and road infrastructure to be rehabilitated \nremain  in  the  same  alignment  and  also  require  no  additional  land.  There  are  two  settlements \nwithin the vicinity of the cement plant: Sahil and Umid. Sahil settlement (population 22,700) was \nestablished originally as a workers\u2019 settlement for the cement plant during the Soviet period. It \nhas grown into a highly industrial and commercial town, and the proportion of Garadagh Cement \nemployees in the total population of Sahil is relatively low. Umid settlement (population 2,000) is \ncomprised  mainly  (75%)  of  internally  displaced  persons  from  the  Nagorno\u2013Karabagh  conflict. \nThe Umid population has expressed its expectation for project-related employment opportunities \n(more  than  60%  of  the  peak  construction  workforce  of  700\u2013900  persons  will  be  locally  hired). \nGaradagh  Cement  has  indicated  it  will  facilitate  this  by  promptly  communicating  employment \nopportunities to Sahil, Umid, and the region.  \n \nBased  on  the  findings  of  the  ESIA,  and  verified  by  ADB  during  transaction  review,  the \n30. \nproject  is  classified  C  in  respect  of  ADB's  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples \npolicies.  In  June  2008,  public  meetings  were  held  in  the  villages  of  Sahil  and  Umid  where \nattendees expressed  enthusiasm for  energy  efficiency  upgrades  but  expressed  concern  about \nfuture  airborne  pollution  due  to  the  increase  in  production  capacity  and  the  fuel  switch  from \nnatural gas  to  coal.15 Garadagh  Cement  has  an  established  public consultation  and  disclosure \nplan  and  has  made  project  documents  and  grievance  forms  available  to  stakeholders  and  the \npublic (footnote 12). On 17\u201318 December 2008, further consultation was carried out on the draft \nfinal ESIA, with project staff available to directly answer questions and provide additional project \nliterature (ESIA, project pamphlet, posters with simulated pictures of the expansion, and results \nof  dispersion  calculations)  and  no  additional  major  issues  were  raised  by  the  public  and \nstakeholders.  Garadagh  Cement  will  nominate  a  community  liaison  officer  responsible  for \ncontinuing  communications  with  the  public  during  construction  and  operation.  Garadagh \nCement will also implement a grievance mechanism where the community liaison officer will be \nresponsible for recording and responding to grievances. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n31. \nThe  company  has  signed  an  EPC  contract  with  CBMI  for  turnkey  delivery  of  the \nexpanded  and  upgraded  clinker  and  cement  plant.  Project  scope  components  outside  of  the \nclinker and cement plant will be contracted and managed directly by the company and Holcim \nwith  local  contractors.  The  project  is  currently  under  way  and  approximately  \u20ac53  million  has \nalready  been  spent  on  EPC  mobilization  and  other  upfront  equipment  costs.  Total  cost  of  the \nproject is \u20ac325 million. \n\n                                                \n14  Due diligence has confirmed there are no affected persons permanently or temporarily settled on this land, and \n\nthe land has no productive uses. \n\n15  Garadagh Cement. 2008. Environmental and Social Impact Assessment: Garadagh Cement Project New Dry Kiln \n6.  Baku.    The project's environmental impact  assessment  report indicates that  the project  will  achieve  airborne \nemissions concentrations of less than 30 mg per normal cubic meter (Nm3) of particulates, less than 500 mg/Nm3 \nNOx, and 200 mg/Nm3 of sulfur dioxide, which are all substantially less than the existing wet kiln emissions and \nwithin the European Union and International Finance Corporation benchmarks. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n \n32. \nThe  sponsor  proposes  to  finance  the  project  at  a  debt\u2013equity  ratio  of  approximately \n40:60. The sponsor's contribution of \u20ac185 million is to be funded by cash flow from operations of \nthe existing Garadagh Cement business and subordinated debt from Holcim Limited (Table 2). \nPre-project  capital  costs  and  costs  incurred  before  financial  close  in  excess  of  the  \u20ac50  million \nsubordinated  debt  estimate  will  be  covered  by  additional  short-term  shareholder  loans  from \nHolcim and repaid when the senior debt instruments are disbursed.  \n\n \nThe debt will consist of three unsecured tranches of senior euro loans, all by multilateral \n33. \ndevelopment banks (Table 2). The EBRD tranche 1 and the ADB tranche are fully amortizing 6-\nyear door-to-door tenor loans.16 EBRD tranche 2 was originally structured as a B-loan but was \nconverted to a second direct loan tranche when the commercial lenders exited the transaction \ndue to the global financial crisis. The tranche, which the sponsor had already structured within \nits capital plan, has a slightly shorter (5 years) door-to-door tenor. In addition to funds generated \nby existing operations, the sponsor will provide \u20ac50 million of subordinated debt, \u20ac30 million of \nwhich will be injected prior to the drawdown of any senior loans. In addition, Holcim has agreed \nto provide a \u20ac30 million contingent subordinated loan in the event of construction cost overrun \nor funding shortfall. In total, the sponsors are committing \u20ac80 million of subordinated financing to \nensure the project is completed. \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\n\u20ac Million \n\n$ Million \nEquivalent \n\nShare  \n(%) \n\n140 \n50 \n\n70 \n\n20 \n185 \n135 \n50 \n\n325 \n\n190 \n68 \n\n95 \n\n27 \n252 \n184 \n68 \n\n442 \n\n43.1 \n15.4 \n\n21.5 \n\n6.2 \n56.9 \n41.5 \n15.4 \n\n100.00 \n\nItem \n\nA.

The Garadagh Cement project manager, who has represented Holcim in the \nproject  since  2003,  reports  directly  to  the  steering  committee  and  has  overall  responsibility for \nmanaging the EPC contract and local contracts, which cover the entire project scope. Reporting \nto  the  project  manager  are  a  construction  manager;  administrative  manager;  engineering \nmanager;  environmental,  safety,  and  health  manager;  and  HGRS  manager.  The  construction \nmanager  leads  the  construction  engineering  team,  trade  supervisors,  and  quality  assurance \nwhile  the  administrative  manager  leads  the  procurement,  contracts,  account,  and  human \nresources teams. The HGRS manager is accountable both to the project manager and to HGRS \nmanagement in Switzerland. \n\n                                                \n16 While repayment schedules will be the same, the ADB loan will have a slightly shorter availability period, reducing \n\nthe total tenor of the loan to 5.25\u20135.50 years. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nConstruction Arrangements \n\n35. \nThe company will oversee construction of the project through a fixed-price, date-certain, \nEPC  contract  with  CBMI,  a  subsidiary  of  Sinoma  International  Engineering,  and  various \ncompetitively  bid  subcontracts  for  specialized  equipment  from  European  suppliers.  The \nanticipated  commissioning  of  the  project  is  30  June  2011.  Holcim's  HGRS  team  is  providing \noverall  inspection  and  coordination  services,  including  on-site  inspection  staff  in  the  People's \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  for  equipment  fabricated  at  Sinoma's  facilities  in  the  PRC.  The  total \nduration  of  construction  is  33  months,  which  commenced  in  March  2009.  Key  equipment  has \nbeen  directly  selected  by  Holcim  with  established  European  suppliers  for  better  performance \nguarantees that can be serviced without intermediation by CBMI.  \n \n36. \nSinoma  was founded  in December  2001  out  of the  integration  of four  design  institutes, \nfour engineering construction companies, and more than 10 cement equipment manufacturers. \nIt is a public company listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and is engaged in domestic and \noverseas  large-scale  cement  project  general  services  including  engineering  consultancy, \nengineering design, construction and erection, equipment manufacture, supply, commissioning, \noperation,  and  maintenance.  Sinoma  has  implemented  hundreds  of  large-scale  cement \nproduction lines in more than 30 countries in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. CBMI was the \nEPC  contractor  for  Holcim's  4,000  TPD  dry  kiln  project  in  Morocco,  which  was  successfully \ncompleted  on  time  and  within  budget.  Other  Sinoma  experience  includes  (i)  a  10,000  TPD \nproject for United Cement Company, United Arab Emirates in 2006; (ii) a 5,000 TPD project for \nFushon Xingfu, Viet Nam in 2005; (iii) a 5,000 TPD project for Cement Production Line General \nCompany,  Saudi  Arabia;  (iv)  a  3,300  TPD  project  in  Albania;  (v)  a  3,300  TPD  project  for \nItalcement  Financiera  y  Minera  in  Malaga,  Spain  in  2007;  and  (vi)  a  6,000  TPD  project  for \nHeidelberg Cement Group, PRC in 2005. \n \n\n3. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n37. \nThe  borrower  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nand  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism \n(2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to good governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  will  require  the  borrower  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and the borrower \nwill further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n\n38. \nThe  EPC  contract  with  CBMI  is  Holcim's  standard  contract  structure  which  allocates \nmost  project  implementation  risks  to  the  EPC  contractor,  covered  by  liquidated  damages \nclauses.  Contract  payments  are  not  tied  to  completion  milestones,  but  based  on  progress \n(percent  complete),  invoiced  and  paid  monthly.  At  the  end  of  each  month,  CBMI  submits  a \nprogress assessment to the Garadagh Cement team. Holcim's project control specialists survey \nthe  progress  of  construction  and,  once  CBMI  and  Holcim  agree,  CBMI  submits  an  invoice  to \nHolcim.  The  lenders'  independent  engineer  conducts  a  quarterly  review  of  the  design  and \nconstruction  work,  program  status,  subcontracting,  expenditures,  and  forecast  cost  to \ncompletion. \n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nreview  also  encompasses  compliance  with  corporate  social \n\nThe EBRD requires Garadagh Cement to conduct an independent review of the ESMP, \n39. \noccupational  health  and  safety  plan,  corporate  social  responsibility  commitments,  and  human \nresources  management.

The borrower has agreed to increase the \nfrequency  of  the  ESMP  review  to  every  6  months  during  construction,  pursuant  to  ADB \nrequirements under ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (footnote 15). \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1. \n\nInstrument and Amount \n\n40. \n The  assistance  consists  of  a  direct,  unsecured  term  loan  of  up  to  \u20ac20  million  ($27 \nmillion equivalent) to the company, denominated in euros with a fully amortizing 5.5-year door-\nto-door  tenor,  including  a  grace  period  of  no  more  than  18  months  and  with  an  estimated  3.0 \nyear\u20133.5 year average loan life. In lieu of direct security, the sponsor is providing an additional \n\u20ac30 million in contingent financing to ensure completion of the project.  \n  \n\n2. \n\nTerms and Conditions \n\n41. \nThe  terms  and  conditions  of  the  proposed  ADB  financing  are  relatively  consistent  with \ntranche  1  of  EBRD's  senior  loan  to  the  company,  which  was  signed  in  November  2009,  and \ndisbursements and repayments will be on a pari passu basis. \n  \n\n3. \n\nCompliance with Investment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  within  the  country,  industry,  group,  and  single  project \n\n42. \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\nOnce  approved,  this  will  be  ADB's  first  nonsovereign  infrastructure  financing  in \n\n43. \nAzerbaijan. The project merits ADB's support for the following reasons: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe project promotes the adoption of modern, fuel-efficient, and environmentally \nsustainable technology by the company in implementing its expansion plans and \nensures compliance with international and European standards as nonnegotiable \nperformance indicators. The project will use less energy resources for expanded \nproduction, substantially improve air emissions (particulates, NOx, and CO2), and \nreduce water consumption and effluent discharge. \n\nADB's  participation  also  supports  and  endorses  Azerbaijan's  privatization \nobjectives  by  investing  in  a  private  sector  company  that  entered  the  market \nthrough a transparent and competitive privatization tender. Garadagh Cement is \nthe  country's  largest  privatized  company  outside  the  oil  and  gas  sector  and  the \nADB  investment  further  strengthens  private  investor  sentiment  to  diversify \nbeyond the oil and gas sector. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n12 \n \n\n \nC. \n\nAssurances \n\n(iii) \n\nPartnering  with  the  EBRD  on  nonsovereign  and  private  sector  transactions  in \nCentral Asia and the Caucasus increases the effectiveness of development aid, \nand such successful partnerships will lead to other joint multilateral transactions \nin the region. \n\n44. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),17 the government will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance  to  Garadagh  Cement.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form \nand  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  assistance  by  ADB \nBoard of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n45. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the loan  of up to \u20ac20,000,000 to Garadagh Cement Open Joint Stock Company for the \nGaradagh  Cement  Expansion  and  Energy  Efficiency  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending facility;  a term  of  5.5  years,  including  a grace  period  of  1.5  years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthis report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n\n \nC.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \n1.  Based  on  the  country  poverty  assessment,  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  the  sector  analysis,  describe  how  the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nThe project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Azerbaijan (last updated \nin 2006), which emphasizes promoting economic growth in industries and sectors outside of the oil and gas sector.a Cement \nis  a  critical  product  needed  by  large  local  contractors  working  on  various  transport  and  urban  development  infrastructure \nprojects  being  prioritized  by  the  Government  of  Azerbaijan.  These  infrastructure  projects  are  key  to  the  diversification  of \neconomic  growth  of  the  country;  hence,  by  supporting  a  project  in  the  building  materials  sector,  the  project  can  indirectly \ncontribute to poverty reduction. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n \n1.  Key  issues.  By  locally  producing  cement  which  is  cost-effective  for  local  industries,  the  project  is  expected  to  sustain \ninfrastructure development for roads, urban transport, and tourism and help strengthen private sector activities in associated \nindustries  in  the  country  through  employment  generation  and  the  promotion  of  related  businesses.  Garadagh  Cement  has \nmore than 580 employees, of whom around 470 are directly involved in cement production. A large percentage of Garadagh \nCement's  employees  are  from  two  settlements  within  the  vicinity  of  the  cement  plant  and  the  quarries.  Expansion  of  the \ncement plant will sustain jobs and opportunities for the local people in these two settlements. In addition to direct employment, \nthe construction phase of the project will contribute to poverty reduction by boosting the local economy and Azeri enterprises. \nDuring construction, the project will offer a wide range of opportunities with regard to the delivery of services, such as catering \nand accommodation for  the construction  workforce  or  the  delivery  of  subcontractor  services and  goods  for  the  construction \nworks.  The  potential  for  local  procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services,  either  directly  via  Garadagh  Cement  or  the \nengineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor, is presently estimated to be in the range of \u20ac50 million to \u20ac80 \nmillion. Garadagh Cement plans to hold an information event for interested local companies about business opportunities in \nrelation  to  the  project.  This  will  be  undertaken  in  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  the  Baku \nChamber of Commerce and local entrepreneur organizations. \n \n2.  Design  features. The project will assist Garadagh Cement to modernize its Garadagh cement production plant which is \nlocated  near  Sahil  Settlement  about  34  kilometers  (km)  southwest  of  Baku  and  about  1  km  inland  from  the  Caspian  Sea. \nWithin  the  frame  of  plant  modernization,  a  state-of-the-art  dry-process  rotary  kiln  including  raw  material  handling  and  raw \nmaterial preparation will be constructed at the Garadagh Cement plant site. This new dry kiln 6 will replace the present four \nwet-process kilns which will be decommissioned no later than 2 years after commercial operation of kiln 6. The project scope \nalso consists of a new five-stage precalcsiner preheater, a vertical roller mill, upgrades to three cement mills, the reopening of \na nearby limestone quarry, and new storage facilities and plant infrastructure.  \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country and major \n\ngroups affected. N/A \n\n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social analysis). N/A \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. N/A \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey  issues. The environmental and social impact assessment undertaken for the project has identified the following social \nand socioeconomic impacts. \n \nLand acquisition and involuntary resettlement. All land necessary for the project is owned by Garadagh Cement. The new \nkiln and associated facilities will be built within the existing premises. The reopening of the Shakhgaya-West limestone quarry \n\n \n\n\f16     Appendix 2 \n\nresults in no land use impacts. There is very little agricultural production in the region due to the arid climate and poor soils. \nThere is no notable agricultural use, except small-scale herding of predominantly goats and sheep. The project will not restrict \nthese activities as the area is vast and uninhabited. The rehabilitation work on the railway between the plant and the quarry \nwill take place along the same alignment and no additional land will be acquired. \n \nIndigenous  people.  There  are  two  settlements  in  the  vicinity  of  the  cement  plant  and  the  quarries:  Sahil  and  Umid.  Sahil \nsettlement  (population  22,700)  was  originally  established  as  a  workers\u2019  settlement  for  the  cement  plant  during  the  Soviet \nperiod.  It  has  grown  into  a  highly  industrial  and  commercial  town.  Umid  settlement  (population  2,000)  comprises  mainly \ninternally  displaced  persons  (75%)  from  the  Nagorno\u2013Karabagh  conflict.  There  are  no  indigenous  people  in  these \nsettlements. \n \nLabor. The construction period of the project will have a temporary (about 3 years) overall positive impact on the local labor \nmarket as a high proportion (more than 60%) of the estimated peak construction workforce will be locally employed. The great \nmajority  of  construction  staff  will  be  male.  Information  with  regard  to  construction  recruitment  will  be  comprehensively  and \npromptly communicated to the local population by Garadagh Cement and the EPC contractor. Employment opportunities will \nbe announced on notice boards in the communities. The appointment of a Garadagh Cement community liaison officer will \nfacilitate  continuous  contact  with  the  local  population  and  will  at  the  same  time  allow  Garadagh  Cement  and  the  EPC \ncontractor to explore local potential workforce options effectively.  \n \nAbout  60%\u201380%  of  the  laborers  for  civil  and  structural  works  will  be  unskilled  or  semiskilled.  It  is  estimated  that  during \nmechanical  and  electrical  erection  qualified  third-country  nationals  will  be  employed  on  site..  The  large  total  number  of \nworkers  and  the  presence of foreign  workers  could  potentially  lead  to  friction,  related  to  misconduct  or  cultural  differences, \namong the workforce or between workers and the local population. To minimize the potential for this to happen, a work site \nregulation  and  a  workers\u2019  code  of  conduct  will  be  set  up  and  workers\u2019  compliance  with  rules  will  be  supervised.  If  on-site \nissues arise, conflicts will be managed by the official representatives of the Garadagh Cement plant who will receive training \nin advance. Garadagh Cement will appoint a community liaison officer, and establish a complaints and grievance procedure in \norder to identify conflict issues early and to facilitate their resolution together with local residents. \n \nDuring  operations,  the  Garadagh  Cement  workforce  will  be  working  with  advanced  production  technology.  Significant \ninvestment will be made to increase skills of the company personnel (technical staff in particular), to ensure that they have the \nrequired level of proficiency. Introduction of state-of-the art technology will lead to increased productivity and, as a result, will \nlead  to  obsolete  staff  positions  and  eventually  to  staff  reduction.  It  is  mainly  workers  with  low  skill  levels  who  will  become \nredundant.  A  comprehensive  retrenchment  plan  will  be  developed  by  Garadagh  Cement\u2019s  human  resources  department  to \nminimize  potential  negative  impacts  of  loss  of  employment.  Garadagh  Cement  will  provide  comprehensive  assistance \nprograms guided by international best practice to the employees subject to redundancy on top of what is prescribed by Azeri \nlabor legislation. As the company intends to expand business further into other construction material sectors, internal transfer \noptions will be considered. Outside of Garadagh Cement\u2019s own staff, no significant employment effect will occur.  \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation.  \n \nAn extensive public consultation and disclosure process has been carried out under the European Bank for Construction and \nDevelopment  (EBRD)  as  the  lead  lender.  Public  meetings  were  held  in  Sahil  and  Umid  in  June  2008  and  the  project  was \ninitially  presented  to  stakeholders,  including  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  and  nongovernment \norganizations.  A  number  of  comments  were  received  from  these  consultations.  In  general,  the  introduction  of  modern \nproduction technology with increases in efficiency and environmental performance was positively received. However, doubts \nwere expressed regarding future air pollution due to the increased production capacity and the fuel switch from natural gas to \ncoal.  During community  consultations  in  Sahil, opinions  were  voiced  regarding  the past and  present  influence  of  Garadagh \nCement  plant  on  air  quality  (dust  and  smell  nuisance  was  attributed  to  the  plant)  but  overall  improvements  with  plant \nmodernization  were  generally  anticipated.  In  Umid,  where  jobs  were  lost  with  the  completion  of  the  Sangachal  terminal \nconstruction works, the expectation of project-related employment opportunities, in particular during construction of kiln 6, was \nvoiced, and experience and qualifications gained from the terminal construction by local workforce was highlighted. General \ncommunity comments requested continuation of the Garadagh Cement social community investment programs.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing    \n\n Consultation   \n\n Collaborative decision making   \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nGaradagh  Cement  has  a  public  consultation  and  disclosure  planb  and  has  made  project  documents  and  grievance  forms \navailable  to  stakeholders  and  the  public.  The  public  consultation  and  disclosure  plan  describes  how  stakeholders  were \n\n Yes  \n\n No   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2      17 \n\nidentified  along  with  the  program  for  disclosure  of  project  information  and  consultation  with  stakeholders  during  project \npreparation,  construction,  and  operation.  Garadagh  Cement  will  nominate  a  community  liaison  officer  responsible  for \ncontinuing  communication  with  the  public  during  construction  and  operation.  Further,  Garadagh  Cement  will  implement  a \ngrievance mechanism  whereby  the community  liaison  officer  will  be  responsible  for  recording  and  responding to comments \nand grievances.  \n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key issues. No particular gender-related issue was identified by the social impact assessment for the project. \n \n2.  Key  actions.

Holcim  holds  majority  and  minority  stakes  in  operations  in  around  70 \ncountries  and  employs  around  80,000  people.  This  broad-based  presence  helps  stabilize \nearnings  by  evening  out  cyclical  fluctuations  in  individual  markets  more  effectively.  Revenue \nstreams  in  2009  from  Asia  and  Latin  America  confirm  that  this  compensatory  effect  operates \nwell  even  during  recessionary  phases.  With  the  acquisition  of  Cemex  operations  in  Australia, \nHolcim has further expanded its geographical presence. \n \n2. \nThe Holcim group of companies has the lowest carbon dioxide unit emissions worldwide \nof any cement manufacturer. Holcim is one of the leading companies in sustainability worldwide \nthrough  its  environmental  stewardship,  human  capital  development,  and  corporate  citizenship \nprograms. The group has been confirmed as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in \n2009\u25002010  in  the  building  materials  industry  and  has  been  included  in  both  the  Dow  Jones \nSustainability Index and the Dow Jones STOXX Sustainability Index for the past 7 years. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nDespite  the  sharp  decline  in  demand,  especially  in  mature  markets,  Holcim's  2009 \nfinancial  performance  remained  relatively  stable.  The group  had  an  operating  profit  of  SwF2.8 \nbillion  ($2.6  billion  equivalent)  on  net  sales  of  SwF21.1  billion  ($19.9  billion  equivalent),  down \n16%  from  the  previous  year.  Operating  earnings  before  interest,  tax,  depreciation,  and \namortization shrank by 13% to SwF4.6 billion. Financial performance was also affected by the \ncontinued appreciation of the Swiss franc relative to the currencies of major group companies in \nEurope,  Mexico,  and  India.  However,  the  group  has  an  above-peer-average  profitability  and \ncash flow generation capability. In 2009, cement sales decreased by 8% to 131.9 million tons, \nand  aggregate  sales  decreased  by  14%  to  143.4  million  tons.  Additionally,  3.5  million  tons  of \nother mineral components were sold in 2009. \n  \n4. \nHolcim  is  a  publicly  traded  company  listed  on  the  SIX  Swiss  Exchange  with  shares \ntraded  on  SWX  Europe,  and  as  of  31  December  2008  had  a  total  market  capitalization  of \nSwF26.3  billion  ($24.8  billion  equivalent).2 The  company  is  rated  \u201cinvestment  grade\u201d  by  the \ninternational  rating  agencies  as  follows:  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s,  BBB,  outlook  stable;  Moody's, \nBaa2, outlook stable; and Fitch Ratings, BBB, outlook stable.3 These ratings compare favorably \nwith Holcim\u2019s principal global competition in cement and aggregates: LaFarge (BBB\u2013, negative), \nHeidelbergCement (BB\u2013, negative), and Cemex (B, stable).4  \n \n \n\n                                                \n1  Based on volumes shipped in 2008 of 143.4 million tons.

It  was  established  in \n1. \n1949 under the former Soviet Union to support government construction projects in the former \nSoviet Union. Two wet kiln lines were initially installed, and between 1957 and 1964 three more \nwet kilns were installed; four are in operation today (kilns 1\u20134).  \n \n2. \nHolcim  acquired  90%  ownership  of  Garadagh  Cement  in  the  course  of  a  competitive \ntender for privatization in 1999. Between that time and 2004, Holcim invested $23 million as per \nthe  terms  of  the  privatization  tender,  and  received  the  final  privatization  certificate  from  the \nGovernment  of  Azerbaijan  in  February  2007.  Holcim  presently  holds  69.6%  of  Garadagh \nCement, having sold a 10% stake to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n(EBRD)  in  2007,  and  10%  to  the  Azerbaijan  Investment  Company  (AIC),  a  government-\nsponsored equity investment fund, in 2008. The AIC is the private sector investment agency of \nthe  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  tasked  with  the  objective  of  investing  and  facilitating \ngrowth  outside  the  oil  and  gas  sector  while  still  focusing  on  employment  and  value-chain \ncreation. The remaining 10.4% of shares are owned by the company's employees.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nAs  required  under  the  civil  code  in  Azerbaijan,  the  company  has  a  supervisory  council \nwhich  directs  day-to-day  operations  through  the  general  director.  The  supervisory  council \ncomprises three representatives from Holcim, one from the EBRD, and one from the AIC. The \nchair  of  the  supervisory  council  is  nominated  by  Holcim.  The  general  director  of  Garadagh \nCement attends all supervisory council meetings but is not a voting member. \n \nWhile  there  is  an  on-site  project  manager  for  Garadagh  Cement,  Holcim  Limited  has \n4. \nestablished  a  steering  committee  which  meets  on  a  regular  basis  to  review  implementation \nprogress and provide guidance on technical issues.  \n \n \n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 10 March 2010) \n", "Currency Units \n", "\u2013 \n", "euro (\u20ac) \nAzerbaijan manat/s (AZN) \n", "\u20ac1.00 \n$1.00 \nAZN1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "= \n= \n= \n= \n", "$1.36 \n\u20ac0.73 \n$1.24 \nAZN0.81 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAIC \nCBMI \nCFO \nCO2 \nCOGS \nCSP \nDSCR \nEBITDA \nEBRD \nEIRR \nEPC \nESIA \nESMP \nGDP \nHGRS \nIRR \nNOx \nPRC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAzerbaijan Investment Company \nCBMI Construction Company  \nchief financial officer \ncarbon dioxide \ncost of goods sold \ncountry strategy and program \ndebt service coverage ratio \nearnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development \neconomic internal rate of return \nengineering, procurement, and construction \nenvironmental and social impact assessment \nenvironmental and social monitoring plan \ngross domestic product \nHolcim Group Services  \ninternal rate of return \nnitrous oxides \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "kcal (kilocalorie) \nkg (kilogram) \nkJ (kilojoule) \nkm (kilometer) \nkT (kiloton) \nkVA (kilovolt-ampere) \nkWh (kilowatt-hour) \nm3 \nMW (megawatt) \nNm3 (normal cubic meter) \nmg (milligram) \nppm  \nton  \nTPA  \nTPD  \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "1,000 calories \n1,000 grams \n1,000 joules  \n1,000 meters \n1,000 tons \n1,000 volts times amperes \n1,000 watts times hours \ncubic meter \n1 million watts (joules per second) \n1 cubic meter at standard temperature and pressure \n0.001 grams \nparts per million \n1,000 kilograms \ntons per annum \ntons per day \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", "GLOSSARY \n \n", "Clinker \n", "\u2013 \n", " \nPortland \ncement \n", " \nready mix \n", " \n", " \n\u2013 \n", " \n\u2013 \n", " \n", "The  base  component  of  cement,  consisting  of  a  mixture  of \nlimestone  and  clay  combined  by  chemical  reaction  in  the \ncement kiln stage.
