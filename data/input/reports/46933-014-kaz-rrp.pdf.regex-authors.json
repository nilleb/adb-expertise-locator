I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nof up to $40,000,000 to the Akmola Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) and the Central-\nAsian Electric Power Corporation (CAEPCO) for the Akmola Electricity Distribution Network \nModernization and Expansion Project in Kazakhstan.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Most of the energy sector network assets in Kazakhstan, including those of AEDC, were \nbuilt in the 1960s and 1970s, and significant investments are needed to maintain and upgrade \nthe outdated and dilapidated distribution network. Although the electrification rate in Kazakhstan \nis very high (97%), the system losses are high (estimated to be 16% nationally) and inventory \nmanagement of spare parts is becoming an increasing problem as the assets become more \noutdated. Investments in the system are falling short in the face of increasing demand, which \nhas  been  growing  by  approximately  6%  annually  since  2000.  Given  the  harsh  climate, \nparticularly  during  winter,  it  is  of  critical  and  immediate  importance  to  upgrade  the  old \ntransmission and distribution networks to avoid system breakdowns which could be harmful to \nthe economy and even fatal to end users.  \n \n3.  In late 2011, the Private Sector Operations Department of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) explored investment opportunities in potential high development impact areas, mainly \nelectricity transmission and distribution. Among several private sector power groups, CAEPCO \nwas identified as the largest privately owned, vertically integrated power utility in Kazakhstan \nwith a good financial and technical track record. In early 2012, CAEPCO applied for ADB\u2019s \nassistance to fund its expansion plans in relation to AEDC. From those initial discussions, \nADB\u2019s  project  team  came  to  believe  that  ADB  participation  would  bring  significant \ndevelopmental benefits. The loan would also be ADB\u2019s first in the energy sector in Kazakhstan. \n \n2.  Project Design \n4.  AEDC\u2019s  capital  investment  program  for  2013\u20132015  will  expand,  augment,  and \nmodernize the company\u2019s distribution network under the new ownership of CAEPCO. \n \n5.  AEDC aims to expand its network capacity to improve reliability of electricity supply, and \nto maintain low electricity losses by investing in new and reconstructed distribution lines and \nmodernized substations. The aim of the project is to increase reliable power supply to existing \nresidential and commercial clients (indirectly through sales companies) and particularly increase \nconnection to 35,000 additional households by 2020 in rural areas of Akmola province and \nAstana. This will be achieved by (i) reconstructing, repairing, and adding new capacity to the \nfixed assets, such as substations and distribution lines; (ii) upgrading software systems for \npower  accounting;  and  (iii) acquiring  modern  measuring  devices.  The  project  also  aims  to \n(i) enable increased equipment load to reduce energy losses in networks of different voltage, \n(ii) reduce direct expenses related to maintenance of equipment, (iii) add capacity in areas with \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "2  \nintensive  infrastructure  development,  and  (iv) create  modern  automated  measurement  and \ntechnological monitoring systems to improve operational and administrative efficiency. \n \n3.  The Borrowers and Sponsor \n6.  AEDC became a joint stock company on 8 March 2004 but has been in operation in \ndifferent  legal  forms  since  1961.  It  is  the  local  electricity  distribution  company  principally \noperating within the boundaries of Akmola province and in a small area of Astana, which \nborders Akmola province to the south. The company, through its electricity sales subsidiary, \nserves  116,000  end  users  in  14  districts  of  Akmola  province  and  181,000  in  Astana  and \nStepnogorsk. These end users are serviced through 25 direct power purchasers in the electricity \ndistribution, agriculture, industry, and residential sectors. The total length of AEDC\u2019s electricity \ndistribution network is 21,500 kilometers (km) with voltages from 0.4 kilovolts (kV) to 110 kV, \napproximately 2,700 transformers, and 3,500 substations. Since 2003, the company has never \nrecorded an operating loss, and its current technical loss is approximately 4%,2 which is one of \nthe lowest in Kazakhstan.  \n \n7.  Most of AEDC\u2019s assets are old and have been largely depreciated. No major investment \nplan has been approved, and the tariff has been kept low for wider social reasons. However, the \ngovernment acknowledged that tariffs need to increase to allow power companies to invest \nmore to improve reliability and efficiency. Against this background, AEDC\u2019s tariff was increased \nby 82.5% in 2011 and 14.7% in 2013. \n \n8.  CAEPCO covers generation, transmission, and distribution of heat and electricity in \nPavlodar, North Kazakhstan province, and in Astana. CAEPCO, through its subsidiaries, owns \nfour thermal power plants with a total installed generating capacity of 974 megawatts and \nheating generation capacity of 2.871 gigacalories per hour. It also owns 51,349 km of electricity \ndistribution  networks  and  986  km  of  district  heating  networks.  The  company  generates \napproximately 7% of the total electricity in Kazakhstan and serves around 692,000 electricity \nend users and 401,000 heat consumers. \n \n9.  CAEPCO\u2019s controlling shareholder (62.12%) is Central-Asian Power Energy Company \n(CAPEC), a private holding company incorporated and registered in Kazakhstan with an A \nrating from Expert RA Kazakhstan.3 The other shareholders of CAEPCO are the European Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) (24.99%) and the Islamic Infrastructure Fund \n(12.89%), which was cofounded by ADB and the Islamic Development Bank. CAPEC is owned \nby several well-known local businesspeople. Most of its revenues are derived from the energy \nsector,  i.e.,  CAEPCO  and  AEDC,  while  it  holds  minority  stakes  in  a  few  finance  sector \ncompanies. In FY2012, CAPEC\u2019s total assets were approximately $1.2 billion, total revenue was \n$562.0 million, and net profit from operations was $43.5 million, an increase from the $30.3 \nmillion in FY2011 because of higher revenues from electricity transmission and sales. \n \n10.  While CAEPCO is a vertically integrated power utility company with several distribution \nsubsidiaries, approximately 83% of its revenues come from generation of electricity (60%) and \nheat (23%), and the remainder comes from transmission and distribution services. In June \n2013, Fitch assigned a rating of BB\u2013 to CAEPCO, reflecting strengths based on its vertical \nintegration, relatively benign regulatory regime, access to cheap coal, and good regional market \n                                                 \n2  This corresponds to the loss of approximately 118 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2012. \n3  Expert RA is the largest rating agency in Russia and operates in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent \nStates. The rating scale ranks from A++ (Absolute highest creditworthiness) to D (Default or Bankruptcy), where A \nrepresents high creditworthiness. ", "  3\nposition,  as  well  as  a  concern  over  potential  pressure  on  its  cash  flow  from  the  planned \ninvestment program to modernize its aging assets. CAEPCO\u2019s recent financial performance is \npresented in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Central-Asian Electric Power Corporation Key Financials \n($ million) \nItem  2010  2011  2012 \nProfit and Loss          \n  Revenue  373.6  439.1  494.2 \n  EBITDA   68.3  80.6  91.6 \nBalance Sheet          \n  Total assets  638.1  849.7  920.5 \n  Total liabilities  276.2  339.1  384.9 \n    Current liabilities  105.2  110.2  122.6 \n    Long-term liabilities  110.3  138.7  163.2 \n  Equity  361.9  510.5  535.6 \nEBITDA = earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization. \nSource: Central-Asian Electric Power Corporation. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n11.  The project\u2019s anticipated impact includes (i) accelerated upgrading of the transmission \nand distribution network in order to supply sufficient electricity to promote sustainable economic \ngrowth, and (ii) promotion of private sector investment in the electricity distribution sector by \ndemonstrating improved performance of a provincial power utility under professional private \nsector ownership. The project is expected to be complemented by more capital investment in \nthe country\u2019s transmission and distribution network to expand capacity and improve efficiency \nand reliability. \n \n2.  Outcome \n12.  An expanded and more efficient power supply is expected by AEDC in Akmola province \nand Astana through improved distribution infrastructure. Additional power will be supplied and \nnetwork failure and technical loss caused by obsolete infrastructure will be prevented through \nadequate upgrading and replacement as well as repair and maintenance of the facilities. \n \n3.  Outputs \n13.   Successful implementation of the project will rehabilitate and augment 19 substations, \n60.0 km of 110 kV lines, 142.8 km of 10 kV lines, and 52.0 km of 0.4 kV lines. Further, it will add \none new substation, 141 km of 35 kV lines, 102 km of 110 kV lines, and two transformers to \nAEDC\u2019s distribution network, as well as additional metering devices to improve the automated \nsystem for commercial power balancing and settlements. \n \n \n ", "4  \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n14.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  which  promotes  private  sector \ninvestment in the infrastructure sector.4 Strategy 2020 also outlines the need for ADB to help \naddress growing energy demand and assist in expanding infrastructure for energy supply. \n \n15.  The country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for Kazakhstan seeks to increase ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement in the energy sector, with the aim of modernizing the country\u2019s aging energy \ninfrastructure.5 It  notes  specifically  that  ADB  will  support  replacement  of  obsolete  energy \ninfrastructure and technologies, and upgrade the transmission network, mainly through private \nsector  or  subsovereign  modalities.  The  project  is  therefore  fully  aligned  with  the  country \npartnership strategy. \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n16.  The project is also in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy which highlights energy efficiency \nimprovements in transmission and distribution systems.6 Under the policy, it is proposed that \nADB will continue to support installation of modern transmissions systems to transmit electricity \nefficiently  from  generation  facilities  to  consumers,  including  upgrading  existing  systems  to \nreduce technical losses and enabling competition when open access is permitted by law. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  AEDC  and  CAEPCO  operate  under  the  general  regulatory  framework \napplicable to power utility companies in Kazakhstan. The tariffs are set by the \nAgency for Regulation of Natural Monopoly. \nManagement  AEDC\u2019s board of directors consists of three members. CAPEC nominates two \nmembers (including the chair) and one member is an independent director. \nAEDC\u2019s management board consists of five members. They are experienced \nand technically competent professionals. \n \nCAEPCO\u2019s board of directors consists of eight members. CAPEC nominates \nthree members (including the chair), the EBRD and IIF nominate one each, \nand three are independent directors. CAEPCO\u2019s management is led by Yerkyn \nAmirkhanov, president of CAEPCO. \nImplementation period  2013\u20132015 \nAEDC\u2019s investment  AEDC  will  follow  a  national  procurement  rule  for  natural  monopoly  in \nplan  Kazakhstan. Competitive tendering procedure is required for purchases of T3 \nmillion or more. CAEPCO will provide support to the tendering process. \nRevenue structure  AEDC\u2019s  supply  contracts  are  effective  for  1  year  and  renewed  annually. \nAEDC\u2019s revenue is based on the approved tariff with actual supply volume. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n18.  The proposed loans of up to $40 million will be provided to AEDC and CAEPCO from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n19.  The proposed transaction merits ADB's assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  It will support modernization and expansion of the aging energy infrastructure \nwhich is critically important in Kazakhstan, reduce the risk of network failure, and \nimprove the reliability of electricity supply to people in Akmola province including \nrural households and the strategically important capital region. \n(ii)  It will enhance the financial and operational stability of AEDC and support private \nsector development by demonstrating an example of efficiency improvement and \ncapacity expansion under professional private sector ownership. \n(iii)  It will provide long-term financing which is required for successful development of \ninfrastructure but which is not easily available from the local financial market nor \nthe international financial market in the present market environment. \n(iv)  It  will  complement  and  increase  the  likelihood  of  the  success  of  the  equity \ninvestment by the Islamic Infrastructure Fund in CAEPCO. \n(v)  ADB will contribute to strengthening the policies of CAEPCO and AEDC on \nenvironment, social, health, and safety through establishment and monitoring \nimplementation of an environmental and social management system (ESMS). \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n20.  The project is classified category B for environment, which is likely to have low to \nmedium environmental impacts and risks during construction and operations. This transaction is \nconsidered as general corporate finance in terms of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \ntherefore a corporate audit of current operations of CAEPCO and AEDC and implementation of \nAEDC\u2019s proposed investment has been conducted. The audit finds no outstanding compliance \nissues related to existing operations. The current environmental assessment practice including \nmanagement of environmental, health, and safety activities is based on national requirements \nand the environmental and social action plan was established with support of the EBRD. The \nenvironmental and social action plan covers measures to implement, manage, and monitor \n \n ", "6  \nproject impacts and risks to ensure compliance with local regulation and appropriate budget \nallocation for monitoring activities. Information disclosure, consultations with stakeholders, and \nsubmission of monitoring reports are conducted as required by Kazakhstan\u2019s legislation. The \ncurrent institutional capacity and commitment of CAEPCO and AEDC to manage environmental, \nhealth  and  safety  impacts  are  deemed  adequate.  However,  procedures  for  screening  and \ncategorizing environmental impacts and risks need to be integrated into the new ESMS to \ncomply with ADB policy requirements. \n \n21.  The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  audit  finds  that  the  land  used  by  AEDC  is  either  owned  by  the \ncompany or leased from the state for 49 years in accordance with Kazakhstan\u2019s legislation. The \ninvestment program activities are envisaged to be carried out on land already owned and leased \nby AEDC. The requirement for new land acquisition or lease for the replacement of the aerial \ndistribution  lines  with  underground  cable  in  Astana  city  can  be  ascertained  only  after  the \ntechnical design is finalized. If land acquisition and involuntary resettlement will occur, the \nrequired procedures for screening and preparing a resettlement plan should be developed in \naccordance with Safeguard Requirements 2: Involuntary Resettlement of the Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The audit also noted that there are 88 ethnic groups residing in Akmola province, \nwhere Kazakhs are the largest permanent population followed by Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, \nand Belorussians, among others. All nationalities are fully integrated into Kazakh society, and \ntherefore they are not considered indigenous peoples as per the Safeguard Policy Statement. \nMoreover, procedures and policy for screening and categorization of social risks and impacts, \nland acquisition, resettlement, and indigenous peoples need to be integrated into the new \nESMS to comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n22.  CAEPCO\u2019s commitment to establish a new ESMS and apply it to AEDC as a condition of \nADB\u2019s  investment  was  noted.  CAEPCO  and  AEDC  also  committed  to  engage  adequate \nenvironmental and social staff and arrange periodic corporate and site training for them. The \ncompanies  will  strengthen  their  procedures  for  meaningful  consultation  and  information \ndisclosure, grievance redress, monitoring, and reporting. The companies will also prepare audit \nreports and corrective action plans or environmental and social plans for existing facilities. \nCAEPCO and AEDC will submit semi-annual reports to ADB on the implementation status of the \nESMS, including implementation of corrective actions indicated in the audit report. \n \n23.  Other social dimensions. The project is classified as having no gender elements. It will \nbenefit the population of Akmola through a more reliable supply of electricity. Moreover, the \nnature of employment during construction activities does not lead to many opportunities for \nwomen. Employment opportunities at the operations phase will be open to interested and \nqualified men and women. ADB will ensure that the ESMS includes appropriate arrangements \nrequiring CAEPCO and AEDC (including contractors) to comply with national labor laws and \ntake measures to conform to internationally recognized core labor standards for the ADB-\nfinanced portion of the project, in compliance with ADB's Social Protection Strategy.7 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy and Anti-Money-Laundering Policies \n24.  CAEPCO and AEDC were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will \nrequire AEDC and CAEPCO to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2001.

Investment Limitations  \n25.  The proposed loans are within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n26.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, ADB will \nconfirm with the Government of Kazakhstan if it has an objection to the proposed assistance to \nAEDC and CAEPCO.
