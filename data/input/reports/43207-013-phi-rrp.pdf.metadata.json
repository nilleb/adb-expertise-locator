The project will initiate a transformation of the tricycle subsector \nby  (i)  improving  the  livelihoods  of  tricycle  drivers  through  higher  incomes  and  a  better  work \nenvironment; (ii) generating global  environmental  benefits  and reducing the  carbon footprint of \nthe  tricycle  industry  through  the  introduction  of  low-carbon,  e-trike  technology;  and  (iii) \nleveraging private sector participation in the e-trike market. The Government of the Philippines \nplans  to  introduce  clean  and  efficient  energy  technology,  provide  affordable  financing \nmodalities,  generate  demand,  develop  technical  capacity,  create  support  infrastructure,  and \nallocate new technology risk to the suppliers. The government will target selected cities in Metro \nManila and other urban centers where tricycles are widely used. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nIn 2011, the Philippines spent about $12.8 billion (29% more than in 2010) on imported \n3. \npetroleum  products;  70%  of the  imports  went to the  transport  sector.2 This  heavy  dependence \non imported fuels renders the country vulnerable to energy supply disruptions and global price \nfluctuations. The  cost  of fuel  imports  is  expected to  rise further  as  the  population continues  to \ngrow  rapidly  and  urbanization  increases.  With  motorization  growing  at  about  6%  per  year, \nemissions  from  road  transport  are  estimated  to  rise  from  24  million  tons  of  carbon  dioxide \nequivalent (tCO2e) in 2007 to 37 million tCO2e by 2015 and 87 million tCO2e by 2030. This will \nfurther  deteriorate  the  country\u2019s  air-quality  and  energy  security,  and  increase  the  Philippines\u2019 \ncarbon footprint. The National Framework Strategy on Climate  Change, 2010\u201320223 considers \na low-carbon path  in the  transport  sector  a  strategic  priority.  It  argues for  cleaner,  indigenous, \nand  optimized  energy  and  transport  sectors  to  enable  the  Philippines  to  address  its  energy \nsecurity while reducing pollution. \n \n4. \nTransport  is  central  to  connecting  people  and  economic  centers  both  nationally  and \nlocally.  In  2010,  according  to  the  Philippines\u2019  Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  using  Land \nTransport  Office\u2019s  vehicles  statistics,  92%  of  the  transport  sector\u2019s  fuel  consumption  was  by \nroad  transport.  Although  public  vehicles  represent  only  about  15%  of  road  transport,  they  are \nmajor fuel users and cause most of the transport pollution\u2014tricycles account for 67%, followed \nby jeepneys4 (23%), cars (4%) and buses (6%). The 3.5 million tricycles currently operating are \nmajor contributors of greenhouse gas emissions and inefficient users of imported fuel. Although \nlocal government units (LGUs) regulate the number of tricycles, this will rise as motorcycle sales \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of the Philippines, Department of Energy. http://www.doe.gov.ph/DO/Report2011.htm \n3  Government of the Philippines. 2010. The National Framework Strategy on Climate Change, 2010\u20132022, Manila. \n\nhttp://climate.gov.ph \n\n4   Jeepneys were initially made from left behind World War II military Jeeps as means of public transport. This has \n\nnow evolved into a locally fabricated vehicle for public transport.    \n\n\fincrease.  About  1  million  motorcycles  are  expected  to  be  sold  domestically  in  2012,  nearly  a \nthird more than the 760,000 units sold in 2010. \n \n5. \nThe International Energy Agency considers electric vehicles as one of the best options \nfor the transport sector, especially in urban areas.5 Recent studies by the Clean Air Initiatives for \nAsian  Cities  estimate  that  switching  to  e-trikes  will  reduce  the  greenhouse  gas  impact  of \ntricycles  by  54%.6 International  studies  also  point  to  similar  savings.7 Tricycles  are  a  popular \nmode  of  local  transport  in  the  Philippines  and  are  run  entirely  by  the  private  sector.  In  many \ncases, they provide a vital link as a local feeder service to the larger-public transport network. \nAlthough  the  government  has  banned  the  importation  of  two-stroke  motorcycles8 the  existing \ntwo-stroke engines are easy to fix and continue to be used in tricycles. Isolated initiatives since \n2009  to  develop  an  e-vehicle  industry\u2014e-trikes,  e-jeepneys,  and  e-buses\u2014mostly  used  lead-\nacid  or  substandard  lithium-ion  batteries  because  of  cost  considerations  and  limited  brand \navailability.  \n \n6. \nIn  April  2011,  ADB  and  DOE  piloted,  20  locally  made  e-trikes  powered  by  imported \nlithium-ion  batteries  in  Mandaluyong, 9 a  city  in  Metro  Manila.  Collectively,  the  e-trikes  have \ntraveled more than 600,000 kilometers (km) in 20 months, and the pilot project have collected a \nnet  total  of  $16,000  as  drivers\u2019  daily  \u2015lease\u2016  payments.  Surveys  from  the  pilot-testing  showed \nthat  e-trike  operators  carried  more  passengers,  implying  higher  turnover  and  daily  income.  By \nswitching  fuels,  the  e-trike  operators  doubled  their  average  daily  net  income  to  $17.  This \nadditional income will help with loan repayments for a new e-trike in the future. Driver feedback \non the handling and operating of an e-trike has been used in designing an improved model for \nthe proposed scale up. \n \n7. \nAlthough the drivers and passengers are satisfied with the performance of the pilot units, \nkeeping  all  20  operating  has  been  a  challenge.10 Problems  include  (i)  a  lack  of  reliable  spare \nparts,  (ii)  inadequate  technical  skills  to  repair  and  maintain  the  motors  and  batteries,  and  (iii) \nconcerns over the battery life beyond the second year as the pilot project was unable to secure \nbatteries  from  reputable  brands.  The  lessons  from  the  pilot  project  confirmed  the  need  for \nsignificant  scaling  up  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  e-vehicle  initiative  and  to  attract \nreputable e-vehicle and battery technology holders to the Philippines. To scale-up the program, \ne-trike manufacturing and maintenance will have to be localized to ensure that the need for after \nsales services, repairs, spare parts, and battery warranties are met. Development of a local e-\ntrike industry will help minimize technology risk, broaden the adoption of e-vehicles, and create \njobs.  The  government  has  started  scaling  up  of  the  pilot  project 11  to  establish  a  viable, \nsustainable,  local  e-vehicle  industry  with  the  participation  of  several  local  and  international  e-\ntrike  manufacturers.  In  response  to  this  initiative,  several  reputable  global  battery  and  car \nmanufacturers have expressed interest in investing in the country.  \n \n                                                \n5   International Energy Agency.

Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Mitigation of Climate Change \n\nthrough Increased Energy Efficiency and the Use of Clean Energy. Manila (TA 7754-PHI). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fWith  about  3.5  million  tricycles  currently  operating  and  a  growing  number  of  new \n8. \ntricycles being registered, a transformation of the industry to clean technology e-trikes will take \ntime.  The  e-trikes  are  expected  to  be  introduced  largely  through  substitution  for  gasoline- \npowered units (i.e. non-incremental). This is expected to be followed by generated demand from \nnew  entrants  to  the  e-trike  market  as  the  affordable  clean  technology  becomes  more  widely \navailable. A survey of local governments found an immediate demand for more than 130,000 e-\ntrikes.  Based  on this  interest, the government  plans  to  initially  scale-up  the  project to  100,000 \nunits  in  a  phased  manner,  in  order  to  create  an  environment  conducive  to  the  manufacture, \ndistribution  and  after-sale  support  of  the  e-trikes.  As  the  private  sector  gains  a foothold  in  the \nsupply and maintenance market for e-trikes, the government\u2019s involvement will shrink.   \n \n9. \nThe introduction of e-trikes with lithium-ion battery technology is also expected to pave \nthe way for higher safety standards and improved environmental compliance. The proposed e-\nvehicle  project  complements  the  government\u2019s  plans  to  support  e-vehicle  businesses. 12 To \npursue  this  transformation,  the  government  has  secured  a  $5  million  grant  and  $100  million \nconcessional  loan  from  the  CTF.  The  project  is  consistent  with  DOE\u2019s  Fueling  Sustainable \nTransport Program,13 and with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy 2009 (promotes projects to support energy \nsecurity  needs  and  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy)  and  sustainable  transport  initiative14 \n(focuses  on  transport  systems that  are  accessible,  safe,  affordable,  and environment-friendly). \nThe promotion of energy-efficient transportation is part of the ADB\u2019s current country partnership \nstrategy15 for  Philippines,  and  the  program  is  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2012\u2013\n2014.16  \n \n10. \nThe market for new e-trike technology to replace existing tricycles and meet generated \ndemand is potentially large given the rapid growth of the industry. To initiate the government\u2019s \nplan to transform the industry through e-trike technology, the project must capture economies of \nscale by ensuring that the supply of e-trike technology and services is cost effective and meets \naggregate  as  well  as  diverse  local  demand  and  conditions.  The  design  of  the  e-trike  has \nevolved through the pilot phase to cater to a range of conditions in the Philippines. The selected \ne-trike design uses a standard, high-quality lithium-ion battery and higher safety standard, which \nis  expected  to  result  in  cost-effective  market  entry  for  national  and  international  investors, \nincluding  reputable  e-vehicle  producers  and  components  manufacturers.  It  will  also  facilitate \ncost-effective  after  sales  service.  Successfully  establishing  the  industry  in  the  Philippines  will \nalso create jobs beyond the e-trike operators and has the potential for growth into other South \nand Southeast Asian markets. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  sustainable  energy  use  by  the  transport  sector.  The \noutcome  will  be  the  transformation  of  public  transportation  through  large-scale  adoption  of \nlocally made energy-efficient electric vehicles, in particular e-trikes.  \n\n                                                \n12 Senate  Committee  Report  No.  44  on  Senate  Bill  No.  285\u2013Electric.

The  project  will  deliver  100,000  complete  e-trike  units  to \n13. \nselected cities or municipalities to replace gasoline tricycles, with a comprehensive warranty on \nbatteries and mechanical parts to ensure technical reliability and after-sales service.  \n \n14. \nsupply chain by procuring at least 300 MWh of lithium ion batteries for the 100,000 e-trikes.  \n  \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Solar  and  grid-connected  charging  stations.  The  project  will  (i)  pilot  five \noff-grid solar charging stations, 200 kilo Watts each, sufficient to meet the demand of 1,000 e-\ntrikes; and (ii) establish grid-connected charging stations. Some pilot solar charging stations will \nbe  in  island  locations  outside  the  main  grid  that  are  easily  accessible  and  plan  to  adopt  large \nnumber of e-trikes.  \n \n16. \ndisposing existing passenger sidecars of tricycles and spent lithium-ion batteries.   \n \nOutput  5:  Communication,  social  mobilization,  and  technology  transfer.  All \n17. \nstakeholders  will  be  educated  about  the  project\u2019s  benefits,  technical  parameters,  costs,  and \nmarket potential of e-trikes. This will include training the drivers on the use and maintenance of \ne-trikes and technical training for other stakeholders to develop human resources to support the \ndevelopment of the local industry.   \n \nD. \n \nThe project is estimated to cost $504 million (Table 1). The government has requested a \n18. \nloan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan \nwill  have  a  20-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  a \ncommitment  charge of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and conditions  as set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and \nconditions and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade  based  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  Based  on  such  loan  terms  and \nrepayment method, the average loan maturity is 12.75 years and there is no maturity premium \npayable to ADB. \n \nThe CTF will cofinance the project with a grant of $5 million and a loan of $100 million, \n19. \nwith  a  40-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  a  management  fee  of  0.18%  per \nannum  on  the  undisbursed  balance  of  the  loan,  and  an  interest  charge  of  0.25%.  ADB  will \nadminister  the  CTF  funds.  ADB  and  CTF  loans  will  finance  the  financial  charges  during \nconstruction.  The  government  will  finance  the  remaining  $99  million,  including  taxes  and \ncontingency amounts for the e-trikes. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Project Investment Plana \n($ million)  \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \n\na.

This covers \ninterest accrued from both the ADB and the Clean Technology Fund loans. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n118.80 \n211.20 \n37.84 \n \n0.48 \n2.30 \n2.64 \n0.87 \n4.00 \n \n0.87 \n0.87 \n379.86 \n \n44.38 \n14.07 \n58.45 \n51.25 \n14.44 \n504.00 \n\nSubtotal (B) \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nADB Clean Technology Fund (loan)a \nADB Clean Technology Fund (grant) a \nGovernment \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n300.00 \n100.00 \n5.00 \n99.00 \n504.00 \n\nShare of Total \n (%) \n\n59.53 \n19.84 \n0.99 \n19.64 \n100.00 \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na Financed  by  the  Clean  Technology  Fund  (CTF),  administered  by  ADB. \nThe  $5  million  grant  amount  also \nincludes  $240,000  as  project \nadministration fees. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n20. \nThe project will be implemented over 60 months from January 2013 to December 2017. \nIt will have two phases: an industry development phase (24\u201330 months) when the initial 20,000 \ne-trikes  will  be  procured  and  distributed,  and  (ii)  a  scale-up  phase  (30\u221236  months)  when  the \nremaining  80,000  units  will  be  procured  and  distributed.  ADB  and  DOE  will  conduct  a \ncomprehensive midterm assessment of the project, which will include options for expanding into \nother public e-vehicles, before implementing phase 2.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDOE will be the executing agency responsible for procurement, overall implementation,  \n21. \nand technical  supervision  of the  project.  DOE  will  manage the  supply  and service contracts  of \nthe  suppliers.  DOE  has  established  E-Trike  Group,  which  will  become  the  e-trike  project \nmanagement  unit,  and  will  include  DOE  staff,  supported  by  implementation  consultants  with \ntechnical expertise. It will directly manage and supervise implementation of the project.  \n \n22. \nPrior to  the  distribution of  e-trikes,  a government financial  institution (GFI)  with  existing \nlending  operations  in  the  municipalities,  such  as  the  Land  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (LBP),  will \nestablish a loan facility with the LGU to cover the cost of the e-trikes. The government will enter \ninto  a  separate  agreement  with  the  GFI  on  the  financial  terms  of  the  loans  from  GFI  to  each \nselected  LGU.  The  LGU  will  take  the  driver\u2019s  credit  risk  as  they  are  in  a  better  position  to \nassume  such  risk.  The  choice  of  the  GFI  may  vary  depending  on  the  municipality  and  GFI\u2019s \ninterest,  availability  of  retail  branch  in  local  area,  etc.  The  e-trikes  will  be  distributed  in  three \nsteps:  (i)  ADB  will  pay  the  competitively  selected  suppliers  directly  upon  DOE\u2019s  request \n(withdrawal  application),  (ii)  the  supplier  will  deliver  the  e-trike  to  the  LGU  concerned  in \naccordance with an agreed upon schedule, and (iii) the LGU\u2019s e-trike office will distribute the e-\ntrikes to drivers pre-selected based on a transparent lottery with priority to two stroke tricycles.  \n  \n23. \nThe collected funds from the drivers and payment back to government will also involve \nthree steps: (i) the drivers will pay a daily amount as part of the \u2015lease to own\u2016 scheme either to \nthe e-trike office, or to a bank account or to a third party responsible for collection (this activity \nwill  be  \u2015ring-fenced\u2016  from  the  LGU);  (ii)  the  collection  from  the  drivers  will  be  used  to  pay  the \nGFI; and (iii) the GFI will pay DOF\u2019s Bureau of Treasury.

The lithium-ion battery was subsequently \npiloted  in  20  e-trikes  with  different  battery  sizes  and  charging  options.  Despite  problems  with \nservice and technical support, the pilot units have performed well overall. Collectively they have \ndriven more than 600,000 km on both city and hilly terrain.18 The pilot concluded that (i) lithium-\nion  batteries  are  an  environmentally  sustainable  battery  choice;  (ii)  technically  appropriate  e-\ntrike designs are capable of meeting the variable range, speed, and terrain considerations in the \nPhilippines;  and (iii) the fuel  savings  are  significant  and  sufficient  to support  a  lease-to-own  e-\ntrike  scheme  for  the  drivers.  However,  because  of  the  sophisticated  battery  and  charging \ntechnologies,  the  drivers  and  LGUs  will  be  unable  to  manage  the  risk  of  a  faulty  battery.  To \naddress this technical risk, the project will ensure that the batteries have a 3-year warranty and \npayments to the supplier are staggered to match the warranty period.  \n \nB. \n\nSustainability \n\n25. \nThe lack of local technical support and spare parts has been a recurring reason for failed \ne-vehicle  initiatives.  Recognizing  that  drivers  do  not  earn  any  income  when  their  tricycles  are \nnot  operational,  the  project  will  ensure  that  they  have  access  to  a  standby  e-trike  or  are \ncompensated  by  the  supplier  for  any  losses  within  the  warranty  period.  To  address  the  pilot \nproject\u2019s  lessons  regarding  the  need  for  after-sales  services,  arrangements  will  be  made  for \neasy access to repair services, and technical components will be covered by a comprehensive \nwarranty.  Suppliers  will  be  required  to  establish  local  support  centers  to  honor  warranty \nobligations  efficiently.  Private  sector  suppliers  are  expected  to  provide  the  after-sales  service, \nspare parts, and technical skills for maintenance after the warranty period as sufficient market \ndemand will have been created. To promote sustainability, $1 million from the CTF grant will be \nused for fine-tuning technology options, technology transfer, local industry support, and capacity \nbuilding.  Each  driver  will  also  be  required  to  undergo  a  comprehensive  training  program \ncovering  (i)  general  introduction  to  e-vehicles  and  their  components,  (ii)  troubleshooting,  (iii) \nmaintenance,  (iv)  charging  options,  (v)  safety,  (vi)  energy-efficient  driving  instructions,  (vii)  the \nwarranty,  and  (viii)  a  driver\u2019s  responsibility.  Manuals  with  clear  illustrations  in  the  local  dialect \nwill also be distributed.  \n \nC. \n \n26. \nA detailed financial analysis was carried out in real terms using 2012 prices to examine \nthe  aggregate  costs  and  incremental  benefits measured by the  revenue from  drivers  or  users. \nBased  on  field  data  from  the  pilot,  a  typical  tricycle  driver  who  uses  about  $6.50  worth  of \ngasoline (5.5 liters) to drive 80 km per day can save about $5 per day by switching to an e-trike, \nwhich  consumes  6  kilowatt-hour  of  power  costing  $1.50  per  day. The  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (FIRR)  exceeds  47%  from  the  driver\u2019s  perspective. The  FIRR  remained  robust  under \nsensitivity  testing  and  in  the most  severe  case  of  a  daily  lease payment increase by  10%, the \nFIRR declined to 16.5%. The government expects the cost of the e-trike office in an LGU will be \nequivalent  of  2%-3%  of  the  drivers\u2019  rental  payment  each  month;  there  will  be  no  cost \nimplications  for  the  LGU\u2019s  current  budget.  As  suppliers  become  established  and  operator \ndemand grows, the initial support role and supervision costs to the government will decline. \n\nFinancial  \n\n                                                \n18 Antipolo, Laguna, Mandaluyong City, Marikina and Quezon City.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nD. \n\nEconomic  \n\n27. \nA  policy  objective  of  the  project  is  to  generate  demand  for  clean  and  efficient  e-trike \ntechnology,  although,  the  new  units  will  initially  substitute  for  old  gasoline-powered  tricycles. \nThe  project\u2019s  economic  analysis  is  based  on  the  non-incremental  cost  and  benefit  streams,  \ncomparing  the  \u2015with  project\u2016  and  \u2015without  project\u2016  scenarios.  Benefits  are  derived  mainly  from \nthe  fuel  savings  or  avoided  costs  from  the  importation  of  fuel.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (EIRR)  is  23.7%, which  exceeds  the  economic  hurdle  of  12%.19 This  indicates  that  the \nproject is economically viable. Sensitivity analysis shows the EIRR drops to 17.5% if the price of \nimported oil falls by 20%. The main project beneficiaries will be e-trike drivers. Assuming about \nfive people depend on each driver\u2019s income, about 500,000 people will directly benefit from the \nproject\u2019s  output.  The  fabrication  of  e-trikes  and  assembly  will  be  domestic.  The  project  could \ncreate about 10,000 jobs by 2015 with employment increasing as the e-trike industry grows. E-\ntrike drivers, passengers and the population at large will benefit from reduced emissions from e-\ntrikes.    \n \nE. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and DOE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare  described  in  the  PAM.  To  ensure  transparency  and  good  governance,  DOE  will  publicly \ndisclose  on  its  website  information  on  how  loan  proceeds  are  being  used.  ADB  will  organize \nspecial  training  for  GFIs,  DOE,  and  project  management  unit  staff,  and  participating  LGUs \ncovering  all  aspects  of  project  implementation  and  ADB  procedures,  including  procedures  for \nimplementation,  procurement,  use  of  consultants,  disbursement,  reporting,  monitoring,  and \nprevention of fraud and corruption. \n \nF. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n29. \nAn  e-trike  will  increase  the  daily  take-home  pay  of  its  driver,  with  fuel  savings  alone \n(para  26)  generating  about  of  $1,800  per  year  for  drivers  and  their  families.  This  is  also \nexpected  to  facilitate  higher  trike  ownership  (only  8%  of  drivers  in  Davao  were  owners \ncompared  with  40%  in  Boracay).  The  fuel  cost  savings  of  $5  per  day  will  greatly  benefit  the \ndriver community and are the basis for the lease-to-own scheme. The project will not displace, \nor negatively affect the livelihoods of, tricycle drivers or families. Other developmental benefits \nwill  include  better  health  for  drivers,  passengers  and  urban  residents  through  lower  trike \nemissions; new skills development; job creation; and the establishment of a vehicle and spare \nparts supply industry. The additional net income of e-vehicle drivers and owners are expected to \nbe largely used in the participating communities. \n \nThe  pilot  e-trike  design  has  accounted  for  women\u2019s  needs.  Female  passengers  were \n30. \nconsulted  on  the  design  and  safety  aspects  of  proposed  e-trike  models,  especially  for  Metro \nManila.  As  this  is  a  replacement  program,  the  scope  for  female  drivers  will  be  limited.  ADB's \ntarget is for at least 30% of charging station jobs to be filled by women (only for daytime shifts) \nand  necessary  training  will  be  included.  Female  workers  will  also  be  trained  to  inspect  the  e-\ntrikes  for  basic  safety  issues  (roadworthiness,  for  example)  and  collect  e-trike  operation  data. \nThe health and safety benefits of the new design will be significant for the population, especially \nchildren.  \n \n\n                                                \n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fG. \n\nSafeguards \n\nSpecial Features \n\n31. \n The  project  is  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeople. It will bring positive environmental and socioeconomic benefits because the e-trikes will \nnot generate any air or noise pollution, and will replace gasoline powered tricycles that use lead-\nacid batteries. A framework on material recovery and proper handling of old tricycles and used \nbatteries  has  been  developed.20 In  compliance  with  government\u2019s  environmental  regulations \nand ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), this framework describes the disposal options, \nwhich  will  be  evaluated  further  during  implementation,  for  old  tricycles  and  their  lead-acid \nbatteries as well as used lithium-ion batteries from the e-trikes. It also identifies the stakeholders \nand  institutions  involved  and  their  responsibilities.  This  framework  will  be  improved  following \nfurther consultations.21  \n \nH. \n \n32. \nThe project aims to create a competitive local e-vehicle industry using the latest battery \nand charging options, including solar charging. The project uses financing from the CTF22 as an \nintegral  part  of  the  project  design  for  market  transformation.  The  envisaged  market  shift  from \ngasoline-power tricycles to  e-trikes  powered by cleaner,  more  efficient  lithium-ion  batteries  will \n(i)  increase  access  to  and  the  commercialization  of  technology,  (ii)  establish  local  service \ndelivery and after sales support arrangements, (iii) introduce publicly available charging stations \nfor e-vehicles, and (iv) develop the local manufacturing of e-trikes. The development impacts of \nthe project are the initiation of a public sector-driven transformation of the tricycle industry into a \nlow-carbon industry that improves the welfare of e-trike operators.    \n \n33. \nClean  Development  Mechanism. The potential for emissions reduction per distributed \nand  operational  e-trike  is  likely  to  be  about  3.8  ton  per  year  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent \n(tCO2e).23 The  project  is  already  published  on  the  website24 of  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention  on  Climate Change for  public  consultation  and  validation  activities  are  under  way. \nOnce registered, the project will generate certified emission reductions (footnote 20).  \n \nI. \n \n34.
