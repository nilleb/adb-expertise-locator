The plans identify $12 billion of investments for 2011\u20132015 and a further \n$58  billion  of  investments  for  2016\u20132030.  In  2012,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved  a multitranche financing facility  (MFF)  amounting to  $700 million for  the  Bangladesh \nPower  System  Expansion  and  Efficiency  Improvement Investment  Program; this  was  to  assist \nthe  government  in  implementing  the  plans  to  provide  sustainable,  affordable,  and  reliable \nenergy  for  all  in  Bangladesh.  The  MFF  supports  power  sector  investments  in  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  systems  in  Bangladesh  for  capacity  expansion  and  efficiency \nimprovement.  Management  approved  the  first  tranche  of  the  MFF  on  12  December  2012  and \nthe second tranche on 9 December 2013.  \n\n3. \nThrough a periodic financing request dated 5 August 2015, the government asked for a \nloan of $205 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance three outputs under \nTranche 3:  \n\n(i)  Output  1:  replacement  of  an  aging  steam  and  gas  turbine  power  plant  of  220  MW \ncapacity with a more efficient 400 MW gas-fired combined-cycle power plant (CCPP) at \nAshuganj Power Station complex.  \n\n(ii)  Output  2: upgrade and construction of approximately 72 kilometers (km) of 132 kilovolt \n\n(kV) transmission line and associated substations in Chittagong Division.  \n\n(iii) Output  3:  replacement  of  meters  with  approximately  700,000  prepayment  meters  in \n\nDhaka Division.  \n\nThe impact of Tranche 3 will be better access to reliable electricity supply in Bangladesh. \n\n4. \nThe outcome will be increased efficiency and capacity of the power system in Bangladesh.  \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS \n\nThe proposed tranche project is classified as category A for environmental impact under \n5. \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Tranche  3  has  undergone  the  applicable  business \nprocesses  for  subsequent  tranches  of  MFFs.  The  project  team  has  requested  Management \napproval of the conversion of a portion of the MFF into financing for Tranche 3. This conversion \nis  proposed  for  Board  consideration  because  of  the  project\u2019s  category  A  classification  for  the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Multitranche Financing Facility \n\nto Bangladesh for the Power System Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Program. Manila.   \n\n2  This tranche report is being presented for Board consideration as required under the revised Operations Manual on \nMFF,  which  states  that  projects  with  an  environmental  impact  category  A  classification  in  a  subsequent  tranche \nshould be submitted to the Board for its decision as to whether to authorize the President to convert the tranche. \nThis tranche report also includes a recommendation to allow procurement outside of ADB member economies. \n\n\f2 \n\nenvironment. \n\n \n\nframework,  and  Bangladesh  environmental \n\n6. \nTranche 3 is classified as category A for output 1, category B for output 2, and category \nC for output 3. The overall classification is A. The project\u2019s environmental safeguard documents \nwere  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  MFF\u2019s  environmental \nassessment  and  review \nregulations.  The \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  for \noutput 1 were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 3 June 2015. A revised EIA incorporating ADB\u2019s \ncomments  was  submitted  to  ADB  and  the  Department  of  Environment  of  Bangladesh  on \n5 August  2015.  The  updated  EIA  was  disclosed  on  ADB  website  on  28  October  2015.  The \nupdated  EIA  is  available  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  the  Appendix.  A  draft  IEE  for \noutput 2  was  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  14  September  2015,  and  an  updated  IEE  on  5 \nOctober 2015. \n\n7. \nPublic  consultations  were  held  with  local  communities,  including  fisherfolk.  They \nwelcomed  the  project  since  it  would  improve  the  reliability  of  power  supply.  Community \nconcerns  were  noted  in the  EIA  and  IEE,  and  mitigation  measures  were  incorporated  into  the \nEMP. A climate change risk assessment was conducted and led to a medium climate risk rating. \nThe main risks to the project are potentially higher flood levels, temperature rises, and tropical \ncyclones of greater wind speeds. The risks will be factored into the project design. \n\n8. \nGiven the potential environmental impacts\u2014e.g., discharge of cooling water into Meghna \nRiver  and  emissions  of  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx)  during  operation\u2014output  1  is  classified  as \nenvironmental  category  A.  However,  it  is  not  expected  to  cause  significant  harm  as  Output  1 \nfocuses on replacing an old gas-fired power plant with a more energy-efficient combined-cycle \ngas power plant in an existing power complex. This new plant will reduce pollutant intensity and \noffset  pollution  emissions  growth  without  consuming  more  natural  gas.  The  environmental \nimpacts identified in the EIA are mostly predictable and reversible. Sensitive ecosystems will not \nbe affected. Impacts such as NOx emissions during operation will be mitigated by incorporating \nthe  best  available  technology  into  the  power  plant  design,  which  includes  the  use  of  low-NOx \nburners  and  a  NOx-reduction  system.    Furthermore,  the  electricity  generated  through  the \nincremental 180 MW combined cycle gas fired generation capacity will offset CO2  emissions of \naround 800,000 ton per year equivalent of a new coal-fired generation capacity.   \n\n9. \nPotential  environmental  impacts  of  output  2  are  mostly  temporary,  predictable,  and \nreversible. No impacts will arise on forests, sanctuaries, or protected areas, and historical and \ncultural  monuments.  Environmental  impacts  mainly  occur  during  construction  stage,  including \nincreased  local  air  pollution  due  to  dust  and  vehicular  emissions,  construction  waste  at \nsubstation sites, increase in noise level at the construction sites, deterioration of surface water \nquality due to sanitary wastes from worker-based camps, etc. These temporary impacts can be \nminimized  or  mitigated  by  best-practice  control  measures  as  set  forth  in  the  Environmental \nManagement Plan. Output 3 will have minimal environmental impacts. The replaced meters that \nare functional will be reused in other locations. Any final disposal of used meters would occur at \napproved waste management facilities. \n\n10. \nThe  EMP  includes  measures  to  minimize  anticipated  impacts  during  construction  and \noperation. The EIA includes a robust monitoring plan that will support smooth implementation of \nthe  EMP.  The  executing  agency  has  experience  in  implementing  ADB-financed  projects  and \nhas  established  a  project  management  unit  that  includes  dedicated  staff  responsible  for \nmonitoring  environmental  issues  and  implementing  the  EMP.  The  engineering,  procurement, \nand  construction  contractor  will  comply  with the EMP  during  pre-construction  and construction \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nunder  close  monitoring  by  the  project  supervision  consultant  and  the  executing  agency.  All \ncontractors  will  submit  monthly  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  the  project  supervision \nconsultant,  who  will  prepare  and  submit  quarterly  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  the \nexecuting  agency.  Based  on  the  contractors\u2019  reports  and  its  own  due  diligence,  the  executing \nagency will then submit semiannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB.  \n\n11. \nA  grievance redress  committee  will  be  set  up  by  the  executing  agency  as  soon  as  the \nproject  starts.  The  committee  will  convene  twice  a  month  and  keep  record  of  the  grievances, \nand provide the solution(s) within 30 days from the date of the complaint. All complaint-related \ndocumentation, such as minutes of the meeting and decisions, will be summarized and become \npart of the semiannual monitoring report submitted to ADB. If the grievance is not dealt with, the \ncomplainant can seek legal redress in the appropriate courts. \n\nIV. \n\nJOINT COFINANCING WITH ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK \n\n \n12. \nThe Islamic Development Bank (IDB) will provide $220 million to cofinance  the turnkey \npackage for the Ashuganj 400 MW combined-cycle power plant (East). ADB will finance the gas \nturbine  and  generator,  and  IDB  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  plant,  design  services,  and \ninstallation  works.  Since  it  is  not  possible  to  separately  procure  individual  components  of  this \npackage, procurement will be conducted as one package to be financed jointly by ADB and IDB. \nTo  enable  such  joint  procurement,  it  is  proposed  to  expand  country  eligibility  in  this  particular \ncase  by  allowing  firms,  subcontractors,  and  sourcing  of  materials  from  any  country  eligible \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  IDB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  of  Goods  and \nWorks  under  IDB  Financing  (2009).  Such  an  expansion  of  country  and  source  eligibility  is \nrequired  to  implement  the jointly  financed  package  and  would  require  a  procurement  eligibility \nwaiver from the Board. In the absence of such a waiver, a jointly financed procurement package \nwill not be possible.  \n\nTranche  3  has  undergone  the  applicable  business  process  procedures  for  subsequent \n13. \ntranches of MFFs. Upon Board approval, the project team will request Management approval of \nthe conversion of a portion of the MFF into financing for tranche 3. \n\n \n14. \n\nThe President recommends that the Board  \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nauthorize the conversion of $205,000,000 into a tranche to finance Tranche 3 of \nthe Power System Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Investment Program \nin Bangladesh; and \n\napprove the proposal set out in para. 12 of this report to permit procurement in \nnonmember  countries  of  ADB  of  goods,  works,  and  services  produced  in \nnonmember countries of ADB.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/LinkedDocs/?id=42378-017-MFF Tranche Report \n \n\nTranche at a Glance  \n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 27 October 2015) \n \n", "Currency unit \n", "\u2013 \n", "taka (Tk) \n", "Tk1.00  = \n", "$0.01285 \n", "$1.00  =  Tk77.82 \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "ADB \nEIA \nEMP \nIDB \nIEE \nMFF \nMW \nNOx \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nenvironmental impact assessment \nenvironmental management plan \nIslamic Development Bank \ninitial environmental examination \nmultitranche financing facility \nmegawatt \nnitrogen oxides \n", "NOTE \n \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  and  its  agencies  begins \non 1 July and ends on 30 June.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \nVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \n \nTeam members \n \n", "W.
