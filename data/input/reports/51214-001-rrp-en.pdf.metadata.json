The  country  relies heavily  on  intermodal  transport  to  connect  its \npopulation with essential goods and services. About 85% of the population is dispersed across \nrural  and  often  remote  villages.  Given  its  dispersed  geography,  the  development  and \nmanagement of a reliable, appropriate, sustainable, and affordable transport system is critical for \nsustaining economic growth. An effective transport sector provides access to essential goods and \nservices and helps create livelihood opportunities. However, Solomon Islands still lacks transport \nservices  and  facilities.  This  restricts  economic  activity  and  negatively  affects  livelihoods  and \nincome-generating opportunities. The country\u2019s economic potential\u2014particularly from agriculture \nand tourism\u2014remains unrealized.  In  addition,  Solomon Islands is  ranked  sixth in the  world for \nbeing at risk from disasters caused by extreme natural events such as cyclones, floods, storm \nsurges, earthquakes, tsunamis, and droughts.1 These factors emphasize the need for integrated \nand climate-resilient marine, land, and air transport connectivity to drive sustainable and inclusive \neconomic development. \n \n 4. \nSolomon  Islands\u2019  National  Development  Strategy  (NDS)  provides  a  framework  for \nsustained and inclusive growth.2 It highlights the need to expand and upgrade weather-resilient \ninfrastructure  and  utilities  focused  on  access  to  productive  resources,  markets,  and  essential \nservices.  As  a  key  measure  for  achieving  equitable  socio-economic  growth  by  2020,  the  NDS \ntargets  to  provide  at  least  30%  of  Solomon  Islands\u2019  rural  population  with  access  to  essential \nservices through improved transport.  \n \n5.  \nThe National Transport Plan (NTP) outlines Solomon Islands\u2019 policies, priorities, and plans \nfor  improving  transport  infrastructure  and  services  in  line  with  the  NDS. 3  The  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure Development (MID) updated the 2010 NTP in 2016 to cover 2017\u20132036, and the \nupdated plan highlights 260 priority construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance projects. The \nMedium-Term Transport  Action  Plan  (MTTAP)  of the  NTP  sets  out  priority  investments for  the \nprojects identified in the NTP, covering 2017\u20132021. The total investment needs for construction \nand  rehabilitation  works  under  the  MTTAP  are  about  $280  million,  and  corresponding \nmaintenance works are estimated to be $90 million. \n \n\n                                                \n1  B\u00fcndnis Entwicklung Hilft, 2017.

Solomon Islands National Transport Plan, 2017\u20132036. Honiara. \n\n \n\n\fIn  2009,  the  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  established  the  National  Transport  Fund \n6. \n(NTF) under the MID to help finance the rehabilitation and maintenance of transport assets. The \nestablishment of the NTF has led to increased government and development partner contributions \nto the transport sector. About 87% of its funds (SI$313 million) during 2011\u20132016 were allocated \nto maintenance works. As a result, the length of all roads under regular maintenance increased \nfrom 20% in 2011 to 42% in 2016. The MID\u2019s capacity for planning and maintenance of transport \ninfrastructure  has  also  improved  over  the  years  with  TA  support  from  various  development \npartners. \n \n7. \nTo  help  achieve  NTP  targets,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the \nSustainable Transport Infrastructure  Improvement  Program  (STIIP)  in 2016.4 It  is  a $78 million \nprogram,  jointly  financed  by  ADB  and  the  Governments  of  Australia  and  Solomon  Islands  to \nsupport  the  implementation  of  the  road  and  maritime  projects  prioritized  by  the  MTTAP  and \nfinanced through the NTF. The country\u2019s procurement and public financial management systems \nwere  adopted  for  the  program.  About  46%  ($36  million)  of  the  project\u2019s budget  is  allocated  to \ninvestments  to  construct  and  rehabilitate  assets,  while  the  balance  of  54%  ($42  million)  is \nallocated to maintenance for 2017\u20132021. \n \n8. \nKey lessons from completed and ongoing ADB-funded projects show that significant delays \noccur at the project start-up stage after ADB\u2019s loan or grant approval. This particularly applies to \npreparing  detailed  designs,  updating  and  implementing  social  and  environmental  safeguards \nassessments prepared at feasibility stage, and procurement activities (preconstruction activities). \nOf all the ADB funded transport sector projects that financially closed in Solomon Islands during \n2010\u20132013, an average of only 30% disbursement had been achieved after 65% of the project\u2019s \nelapsed time while transport sector projects that financially closed during 2013\u20132015 received an \naverage  time  extension  of  100%,  equivalent  to  about  3  years. 5 This  is  attributable  to  weak \ntechnical capacity to comply with ADB\u2019s safeguard and procurement requirements and insufficient \nfunding  within  the  transport  agencies  including  the  MID,  the  Ministry  of  Communication  and \nAviation (MCA), and the Solomon Islands Ports Authority (SIPA) to finance detailed designs and \nundertake these activities prior to loan or grant effectiveness.  \n \n9. \nMost of the projects faced issues in securing land after ADB Board approval because of \ninadequate time and resources allocated prior to project approval for community consultation and \nconsent. This resulted in significant implementation delays because of land disputes. Completing \ndetailed designs and preparing bidding documents takes more than 1 year after project approval, \ndelaying  mobilization  of contractors  at  the site. Cost  and time  overruns were  common  as  cost \nestimates at project approval were not based on detailed designs.  \n  \n10.  The lack of project readiness has resulted in underinvestment in the transport sector, which \nhas  led  to  the  degradation  of  key  assets.  Out  of  Solomon  Islands\u2019  total  road  network  (1,545 \nkilometers [km]), only 67% (1,035 km) is in maintainable condition while the rest needs substantial \nrehabilitation to become maintainable.6 Similarly, out of the 91 domestic wharves, only 46 are in \nmaintainable  condition,  and  two  international  and  associated  domestic  wharves  require  major \nrehabilitation.  In  the  aviation  segment,  only  six  out  of  22  airfields  have  regular  flights,  and  the \ninfrastructure of domestic airports is in poor condition. Projects under the MTTAP will improve the \ncondition of assets across the transport sector; however, there is no single mechanism to examine \n                                                \n4  ADB.  2016.

These  activities  are  crucial  to \nensure proper investment planning, and to prepare the subprojects for financing. \n \n11.  The facility and ensuing projects will complement the STIIP. About 54% of the funds in the \nprogram are allocated through the NTF to maintain roads and wharves as the prime focus of the \nNTF. The rest of the funds are allocated to small-scale investments. Consistent with ADB\u2019s policy \non results-based lending and the policies of the Government of Solomon Islands, the STIIP does \nnot cover projects with large-value contracts and those with significant environmental and social \nimpacts. In addition, the program does not cover the aviation segment or international wharves \nand associated domestic wharves under the SIPA. As a result, a significant portion of the projects \nslated for implementation under the MTTAP still requires complementary arrangements for design \nand implementation. The facility and associated projects will fill this gap.   \n \n12. \nIn summary, low project readiness has caused long delays in project implementation, cost \nand  time  overruns,  and  suboptimal  quality  of  project  designs  which  fall  short  of  achieving \ndevelopment  outcomes.  Continuing  to  follow  the  same  approach  could  prevent  successful \nimplementation of the MTTAP as there are very few projects developed for project funding. There \nis a risk of not achieving the sustainable and inclusive growth targets of the NTP and NDS. \n \n13.   Value  added  by  ADB  assistance.  Given  the  government\u2019s  sector-wide  approach \nestablished through the NTP, transport sector institutions need to be equipped with the capacity \nto  carry  out  preconstruction  activities  efficiently.  Successful  project  implementation  requires \ntimely, high-quality preparation works to comply with the development partners\u2019 requirements for \nproject processing and to avoid any delays. A readily accessible project development facility will \nallow easy access by transport sector institutions including the MID, SIPA, and MCA to conduct \npreconstruction activities efficiently and on time. \n \n14.  \nThe facility aims to ensure (i) design readiness by supporting the government in preparing \nfeasibility  studies  (including  environmental  and  social  assessments,  resettlement  plans,  and \neconomic analysis) and detailed designs; and (ii) project implementation readiness by supporting \nproject start-up during the inception stage with selection of supervision consultants; compliance \nwith social and environmental safeguards requirements; and procurement activities including bid \npreparation,  evaluation,  and  contract  negotiations.  The  facility  will  also  support  the  technical \ncapacity building for the key implementing agency: the MID and its central project implementation \nunit (CPIU). \n \n15.  The proposed facility will help prepare a high-priority project pipeline not covered under the \nSTIIP  and  will  thereby  complement  that  program.  The  NTF  can  also  fund  projects  developed \nunder  the  facility  depending  on  the  social  and  environmental  impacts,  size,  and  nature  of  the \nprocurement.  Improving  project  start-up  is  important  for  complying  with  the  requirements  of \ndevelopment partners (to avoid delays in project financing) and ensuring continued efficiency over \nthe project\u2019s life cycle. Furthermore, demonstrating implementation effectiveness is essential for \nbuilding  the  confidence  of  development  partners  and  increasing  investments  in  the  transport \nsector. A summary of transport sector assessment and development coordination in the sector is \nin the linked documents.7 \n \n\n                                                \n7 Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Transport  and  Development  Coordination  are  accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n16.  The facility is aligned with the government\u2019s NTP and NDS. It is also consistent with the \ncurrent ADB country partnership strategy.8 \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe  facility  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  All  Solomon  Islanders  have  access  to \nessential services and productive resources and markets. It will have the following outcome: The \nreadiness of the priority transport projects in the MTTAP for funding is improved.9 \n \nC. \n \n18. \nOutput 1: Feasibility studies and detailed designs completed for selected priority \nprojects.  The  facility  will  support  the  preparation  of  roads,  selected  domestic  wharves,  and \ninternational  ports  projects.  Feasibility  studies  are  already  ongoing  under  ADB's  regional  TA \nprograms for Guadalcanal roads and ports.10 These will be prioritized as the first batch of projects \nfor developing detailed designs and preparing safeguards and procurement documents. \n \n19.  Output 2: Initial implementation for new transport projects is supported. The facility \nwill  provide  implementation  support  at  the  project  start-up  stage  for  (i)  safeguard  compliance \nactivities including signing of memoranda of understanding with landowners, land acquisitions, or \nresettlement  activities  if  required;  and  (ii)  procurement  activities,  including  preparation  of  bid \ndocuments, bid evaluation, and contract negotiations. \n \n20.   Output  3.  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development\u2019s  capacity  in  design  review, \ncontract supervision, and quality assurance strengthened. The facility will support the MID \nto strengthen its technical design unit within the CPIU. In addition, MID\u2019s technical skills in road \nconstruction supervision and quality assurance and control will be increased. \n \nD. \n \n21. \nThe estimated project cost is $6.96 million. The facility will finance consulting services for \nproject  preparatory  activities  and  capacity  development,  taxes  and  duties,  contingencies,  and \nproject  management  costs  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by \nfinancier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).11  \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2016.

MID will also recruit \nindividual  consultants  or  a  consulting  firm  to  support  the  government  to  review  the  feasibility \nstudies and detailed designs prepared by the firm, and to supplement the contract management \n\n \n\n\fand quality assurance and control. The government has requested ADB to carry out consultant \nselection on its behalf to avoid start-up delays. ADB has agreed to jointly select consultants based \non  an  agreed  responsibility  matrix.  The  government  will  retain  its  responsibility  for  contract \nnegotiation and contract signing through the MID (footnote 11). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \nAll transport sector investments to be prepared under the facility should be in line with (i) \nthe government\u2019s  NDS, NTP,  or  any  subsector master  plan;  and (ii)  ADB\u2019s  country  operations \nbusiness plan.12 Investment projects in the preliminary list are the government\u2019s priority projects \nin  the  road  and  maritime  subsectors.  The  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  firms  that  will  be \nengaged under the facility will cover technical aspects such as engineering design, safety, climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation, and gender-responsive design features. In addition to standard \ntechnical  solutions,  the  consultants  will  provide  innovative  approaches  in  infrastructure  design \nand specifications that will consider the availability of local knowledge and materials and adapt \nthe tested expertise to local conditions for better climate resilience and sustainability.13  \n \nB. \n \n29.  \nThrough the facility, the project facility will support the government in preparing feasibility \nstudies  and  detailed  designs  and  will  assist  the  implementing  agencies  in  procurement  and \nsafeguard implementation. The facility will enhance the project readiness of pipeline projects, and \nin turn will minimize existing delays between preconstruction activities and civil works. Increased \nproject readiness will reduce the opportunity cost of funds that may otherwise remain unutilized \nafter project approval, by allowing them to be used for other investment projects. The terms of \nreference  for  consulting  services  include  carrying  out  economic  and  financial  assessments  in \naccordance with the related policies and guidelines of the government and ADB\u2019s 2017 Guidelines \non  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects,  and  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Financial  Management  and \nAnalysis  of  Projects  (2005). 14  These  assessments  will  help  the  government  formulate \neconomically and financially viable investment projects. \n \n30.  \nThe  investment  projects  prepared  under  the  facility  will  support  the  overall  economic \ngrowth of Solomon Islands by (i) reducing the transport costs to regional and domestic markets, \n(ii) connecting communities with broad economic and social activities, and (iii) promoting tourism. \nThe selected projects ranked highly on the NTP, which follows the scoring criteria used for the \n2013  National  Infrastructure  Investment  Plan.15 These  scoring  criteria  include  sustainable  and \ninclusive economic growth and poverty alleviation indicators. In addition, the facility will support \nHoniara and Noro ports if the economic and financial viability is established from the feasibility \nstudies undertaken by the ongoing ADB regional TA.16  \n \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2017. 11 Small Pacific Island Countries, 2018\u20132020.

The  financial  management  risk  is  rated  moderate  as  the  MID \nhas  experience  implementing  projects  funded  by  ADB  and  has  satisfactory  capacity  in  project \nfinancial accounting and ADB disbursement procedures. One accountant will be included in the \nCPIU  for  the  proposed  facility.  The  CPIU  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  records  and \naccounts to track the financing resources received, and expenditures made, for the facility. These \nrecords  will  ensure  an  adequate  audit  trail.  The  government  will  engage  a  qualified  external \nauditor to conduct annual audits of facility accounts and related financial statements, following \ninternational auditing standards. \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MID. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \n33.   Procurement and anticorruption measures. Only consulting services (firm or firms, and \nindividual  consultants)  will  be  recruited  under  the  facility.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended \ntime) \nand Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). ADB will \nselect the consultants, and the implementing agency will negotiate with and contract the selected \nconsultants (para. 27). Consultants will submit reports to the implementing agency and ADB, in \nline  with  the  agreed  submission  milestones  during  implementation,  to  ensure  the  quality  and \ntimeliness of the consultants' work. \n \nD. \n \n34. \nThe facility is not expected to have any adverse social impacts and will prepare follow-on \nprojects in compliance with ADB's Handbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects \nand Handbook on Social Analysis: A Working Document.17 The facility will assess gender, labor, \nHIV/AIDS, and other social risks related to follow-on projects, and prepare a mitigation plan under \nthe facility to address these risks. \n \nThe project  is  proposed  as  having  some  gender  elements.  The  facility will  ensure  that \n35. \nthere  will  be  at  least  40%  women  and  vulnerable  groups  participating  in  consultations  and \nmeetings during due diligence.18 The facility will ensure that (i) separate meetings will be held with \nwomen to ensure their open and meaningful participation, particularly in assessing their different \ndemands and need for transport (ii) poverty, social, and gender assessments will be undertaken \nin each of the projects to identify (a) the constraints and challenges facing women in accessing \ntransportation and the economic and social impacts; and (b) gender differences in travel, transport \nmode, poverty, mobility and safety, among others. The government will incorporate the outcomes \nof  the  poverty,  social,  and  gender  assessments  in  the  design  of  all  ensuing  investments.  The \nfacility will prepare the Gender Action Plan for at least two of these projects.  \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nfrom \n\ntime \n\nto \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 1994.

During the feasibility studies, the consultants \nwill  prepare  environmental  impact  assessments  or  initial  environmental  examinations  as \napplicable,  including  environmental  management  plans  and  climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessments  for  the  selected  transport  projects.  At  this  stage,  consultants  will  develop  the \nresettlement  framework,  indigenous  peoples  plan  framework  and/or  resettlement  plans,  and \nindigenous people\u2019s plans. Safeguards preparatory activities will also include consultations and \nsigning of memoranda of understanding with the landowners that will confirm their support for the \nproject and willingness to comply with ADB safeguards and pertinent government policies. The \nfacility will also support IAs\u2019 to build safeguards capacity.  \n \nF. \n \n37. \ndetail in the risk assessment and management plan.20 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \n1.
