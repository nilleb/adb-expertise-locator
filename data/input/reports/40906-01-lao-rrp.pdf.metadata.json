However,  this  potential  is  unevenly  distributed \namong  the  GMS  countries. 1\n For  example,  Thailand,  which  has  a  large  and  growing  domestic \npower  requirement,  has  limited  hydropower  potential  and  is  highly  dependent  on  natural  gas  for \nfuel which is projected to deplete over time. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), on \nthe other hand, has the largest hydropower potential in the region at 18,000 MW, but the smallest \ndomestic  power  requirements.  The  GMS  member  countries  have  agreed  to  promote  the \ndevelopment  and  trading  of  energy  to  enable  member  countries  to  access  cost-efficient  energy \nresources. \n  \nThe  Lao  PDR  is  considered  a  least  developed  country  (LDC),  with  a  gross  domestic \n3. \nproduct per capita of $890 in 2009.2\n The Government of the Lao PDR aims to take the country out \nof the LDC category by 2020. The power sector is critical to achieving this goal, because it is a vital \nsource of export earnings that generated close to 30% of total export receipts in 2008. Today only \n2,530  MW  (14%  of  the  estimated  hydropower  capacity)  has  been  harnessed.  The  government\u2019s \ntarget is to have some 16,000 MW of installed hydropower capacity by 2020, of which up to 7,000 \nMW will be exported to Thailand, and 5,000 MW to Viet Nam. However, the government does not \nhave  the  resources  to  raise  the  substantial  financing  required  to  build  these  projects  and  would \nneed  to  mobilize  financing  from  the  private  sector  through  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP) \narrangements, with the government holding minority stakes in these projects. \n \nADB  support for  infrastructure  development  PPPs  has  included  the  construction  of Theun \n4. \nHinboun in 19943 and Nam Theun 2 (NT2) in 2005.4\n The government has determined that the Nam \nNgum 3 Hydropower Project should be financed through PPP arrangements using the build-own-\noperate-transfer  mechanism.  When  completed,  the  project  would  be  among  the  largest \nhydropower  plants  in  the  Lao  PDR.  Given  the  amount  of  financing  required,  the  sponsors  of \nNN3PC have requested ADB to provide financial assistance and take a prominent role in arranging \nlong-term financing. As an equity shareholder, the Government of the Lao PDR has also requested \nADB  to  consider  supporting  the  financing  required  for  their  investment  into  the  project.

Manila. \n\n\f    \n\n2         \n       \n \nsovereign  and  nonsovereign  operations  have  collaborated  on  this  project  since  2006.  ADB  has \nalso been asked to lead the environment and social due diligence to ensure that the project will be \ndeveloped  and  operated  in  a  sustainable  manner  and  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). As part of its leadership role, ADB provided a technical assistance package in \n2007  to  conduct  a  cumulative  impact  assessment  of  the  Nam  Ngum  River  Basin  (NNRB),  which \nwas completed in 2010.5\n  \n  \n5. \nNN3PC  has  been  in  lengthy  negotiations  with  the  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of \nThailand  (EGAT)  for  the  sale  of  power  to  Thailand.  The  negotiations  were  completed  in  March \n2010 with the signing of a memorandum of understanding. The project was subsequently included \nin Thailand\u2019s 2010 power development plan as an important source of additional electricity to meet \nThailand\u2019s power requirements by 2017.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \nThe project is located along the Nam Ngum River (NNR) in Vientiane and Xieng Khouang \n6. \nprovinces and forms a cascade with other hydropower projects in the NNRB.6\n It will operate as a \nstorage  system  with  a  maximum  storage  capacity  of  1,407  million  cubic  meters.  Water  will  pass \nthrough  a  10.6 kilometer  (km)-long  headrace tunnel  to  an  underground  power  station.  A  nearly  1 \nkm-long  tailrace  tunnel  would  carry  the  water  back  to  the  river.  The  main  features  of  the  project \ninclude  (i)  2  x  220  MW  installed  capacity;  (ii)  a  concrete-faced  rockfill  dam,  220  meters  (m)  in \nheight; and (iii) a 100 km long, 500 kV transmission line.  \n \nThe project will connect to an existing substation in Nabong where transmission lines from \n7. \nother power export projects7\n will also be linked. Currently, only a 230 kilovolt (kV) switchyard exists \nat  the  Nabong  substation,  which  is  used  solely  by  Nam  Ngum  2  Power  Company  (NN2).  This \nswitchyard will need to be upgraded to a 230/500 kV collector substation to be able to serve both \nthe project and NN2. Power from the Nabong substation will then pass through a 27 km-long 500 \nkV double circuit transmission line that will connect to the delivery point in Thailand. The line was \nfinanced and constructed by NN2 and is fully operational, but is currently only energized at 230 kV. \nNN2 currently owns the line. \n \nThe  government  is  required  under  their  concession  agreement  with  NN3PC  to  (i)  expand \n8. \nthe existing Nabong substation to enable the project to connect to it, and (ii) own and operate both \nthe  Nabong  substation  and  the  common  transmission  line.  At  the  government\u2019s  request,  ADB\u2019s \nsovereign  operations  is  considering  supporting  the  financing  required  by  the  Government  of  the \nLao PDR to meet its obligations to NN3PC under the concession agreement.

With  the  exception  of \nLHSE, the shareholders have extensive power generation experience. \n \n10. \nAxia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Marubeni Corporation (Marubeni). Established in 2003, \nAxia  currently  owns  16  power  generating  assets  globally  with  a  combined  generating  capacity  of \n2,493  MW.  Marubeni  is  one  of  the  largest  Japanese  companies,  with  a  diversified  business \nportfolio. Marubeni has a strong presence in the global power market, having been involved in the \ndevelopment  of  33  power  projects  in  22  countries,  with  a  combined  gross  generating  capacity  of \n23,604 MW.  \n \n11. \nlargest \nindependent  power  producer  with  a  market  share  of  about  14.2%  of  Thailand\u2019s  total  generating \ncapacity  (as  of  March  2011).  The  company  was  founded  in  March  2000,  and  currently  has \ninvestments in several commercial operating power plants with a stand-alone production capacity \nof  3,645  MW.  Ratch  is  listed  in  the  Stock  Exchange  of  Thailand.  However,  EGAT  owns  and \ncontrols about 45% of the equity.  \n \nGMS  Lao  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  GMS  Power  Public  Company  Limited  (GMS \n12. \nPower).  GMS  Power  is  one  of  Thailand\u2019s  leading  private  power  developers.  It  is  part  of  the \nconsortium that developed, owns and operates the 210 MW Theun-Hinboun Hydropower Plant in \nthe  Lao  PDR  and  the  lead  sponsor  for  the  Bang  Bo  350  MW  combined  cycle  power  plant  in \nThailand.9\n GMS Power is currently spearheading the construction of the 280 MW Theun-Hinboun \nexpansion.  \n \n13. \nLHSE is the holding company specifically established by the Government of the Lao PDR to \nown  and  manage  its  equity  investments  in  various  power  projects.

The project, which has been developed under a PPP \narrangement,  will  largely  be  financed  through  private  sector  equity  and  commercial  debt.  The \nsuccess  of  this  project  will  further  increase  the  flow  of  private  sector  funds  into  infrastructure \ndevelopment  in  the  Lao  PDR.  Roughly  10  PPP  projects,  including  this  one,  are  expected  to  be \nimplemented over a 10-year period beginning in 2011. \n \n15. \nImprove energy security in Thailand. Thailand is one of the largest electricity consumers \nin  Southeast  Asia.    As  of  December  2009,  installed  power  generation  capacity  was  29,212  MW, \n71%  of  which  is  natural  gas.  The  Government  of  Thailand  has  stressed  the  importance  of \ndiversifying  its  energy  sources  and  securing  alternative  sources  of  fuel  for  power  generation  to \nensure  energy  security  that  would  sustain  their  economic  growth.    The  goal  is  to  reduce  power \ngeneration from  natural gas to  about  50%  by  2030,  and  increase  power imports to  about 25%  of \nthe  system\u2019s  power  supply  requirements.  The  project  will  achieve  this  objective  by  providing  an \nalternative, low cost and renewable energy source. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \n16. \nThe  project's  outcome  is  increased  regional  cooperation  between  the  Lao  PDR  and \nThailand through the trade of clean energy. The Lao PDR has limited opportunities for trade and \n                                                \n9 The Bang Bo power plant has been recently recognized for setting a world record of continuous operating performance. \n\nThe facility also has an outstanding health, safety and environmental record. \n\n \n\n\f    \n\n4         \n       \n \neconomic  growth.  However,  it  has  a  very  large  hydropower  potential  that  can  be  harnessed  to \ngenerate  foreign  currency  receipts.  Thailand,  on  the  other  hand,  has  a  strong  and  growing \neconomy,  but  this  growth  may  be  at  risk  due  to  its  heavy  reliance  on  its  dwindling  sources  of \nnatural gas. This project is an example of an economic partnership in the region that addresses the \ndevelopment constraints of both countries through the trade of electricity.  \n \nThe Government of Thailand has developed a plan to cut down greenhouse gas emissions \n17. \nbecause  of  increasing  concerns  regarding  the  environmental  impact  of  power  generation.10\n The \nplan calls for the increase in the portion of renewable energy in power generation to 2.4% by year \n2020.  Through  the  project,  up  to  2,072  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of  clean  energy  will  be  sold  to \nThailand  which  will  help  Thailand  avoid  about  1.0  million  tons  per  year  of  carbon  dioxide \nemissions. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n \n18. \nThe output will be the construction of a 440 MW hydropower plant in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguards Policy Statement. The project will demonstrate that large infrastructure projects can be \ndeveloped in a sustainable manner while providing economic benefits to the country.  \n \n19. \nThe project will spur economic growth in the Lao PDR by increasing government revenues, \nemployment generation and the provision of community infrastructure. It will generate about $771 \nmillion  in  revenues for  socioeconomic  development  and  provide  employment  opportunities  during \nthe  construction  and  operation  phase  for  the  Lao  PDR  nationals.  Moreover,  the  project  will \nconstruct  community  infrastructure  (i.e.,  schools,  health  centers  and  improved  roads)  that  will \nfacilitate economic and social activities. \n \nC. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020  \n\nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020, 11\n\n \n which  identifies  infrastructure \n20. \ndevelopment and regional cooperation as two of the five core areas of operation. Under Strategy \n2020,  ADB\u2019s  infrastructure  operations  will  promote  a  larger  role  for  the  private  sector  in \ninfrastructure financing. ADB will also scale up its support for regional cooperation by increasingly \ninvesting in projects that accelerate growth and economic partnerships in the region.  \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Regional Strategy \n \n\nThe regional cooperation operations business plan (2010\u20132012) for GMS12\n\n aims to achieve \n21. \nan  integrated  and  prosperous  region  through  the  promotion  of  economic  growth,  environmental \nsustainability and private sector development. This project will demonstrate the economic benefits \nthat  will  accrue  to  both  countries  as  a  result  of  the  trading  of  power.  It  also  promotes  the \ndevelopment of large-scale infrastructure in the region with significant debt and equity coming from \nprivate  sector  institutions  based  in  other  regions.  Project  implementation  will  meet  high \nenvironmental and social standards. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n10 Roughly 50% of Thailand\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to power generation. \n11 ADB. 2008.

The project will continue to generate income for the country for at least \nanother 25 years after the turnover. \n\n4. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy  \n\n \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy14 requires energy operations to be aligned with ADB's overall strategy, \n23. \nwith  one  emphasis being  on  energy  security. The  project  is consistent  with the  policy  as  it  would \ndiversify  Thailand\u2019s  power  supply. 15\n Having  a  diversified  energy  source  will  help  ensure  that \nThailand\u2019s economic growth will not be derailed by energy supply shortages or price volatility. \n\n5. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations \n\n \nA  key  finding  from  ADB\u2019s  independent  review  of  the  Lao  PDR  power  sector  program  in \n24. \n2010 16\n indicates  the  government  lacks  the  capacity  to  identify  and  manage  environmental  and \nsocial  impacts.  Further  interventions  to  increase  the  government\u2019s  capacity  are  recommended, \nincluding  through  continued  financial  assistance  by  ADB  for  the  development  of  hydropower \nprojects to ensure proper environmental and social safeguards are adopted.  These would include \nincorporating  lessons  learned  from  the  NT2  experience  such  as  (i)  an  improved  stakeholder \nconsultation  and  grievance  mechanism;  (ii)  the  early  implementation  of  the  livelihood  restoration \nprograms; and (iii) the establishment of realistic targets that take into account the affected peoples\u2019 \ncapacity to assimilate new practices. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\nD. \n \n25. \n \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\n \nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nConstruction Arrangements \nType of arrangement  \n\nArrangements \nNN3PC was awarded, on a negotiated basis, a concession covering \na period of up to 27 years after commercial operations date. \n \nSupervised by the private shareholders, all of whom have extensive \nexperience in the development and operation of large power plants.  \n \nOctober 2011\u2013December 2018 \n \nThere  will  be  no  single  turnkey  construction  contract.

ADB  will  enter  into  an  unfunded  risk  participation \nagreement for the full amount of the second tranche with eligible commercial banks. Both tranches \nwill  carry  an  interest  rate  as  well  as  commitment  and  front-end  fees  to  be  determined  by  ADB\u2019s \nInvestment  Committee.  Both  tranches  will  finance  only  eligible  project  costs  under  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n27. \nIn  addition  to  assistance  from  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations,  ADB  is  also  considering  a \nloan to the Government of the Lao PDR in the amount of up to $115.1 million to finance LHSE\u2019s \nequity investment in the project. The sovereign loan will be considered separately by management \nand will follow the approval process for ADB\u2019s sovereign loan proposals.  \n\nB. \n\nValue-Added by ADB Assistance \n\n28. \nThe  nature  of  the  project  (i.e.,  long  construction  period,  high  upfront  capital  expenditure, \ncompetitive  tariffs,  long  asset  life  and  revenue  contracts)  is  appropriately  financed  by  long-tenor \ndebt to match its cash flow profile. The proposed long-tenor debt from ADB plays a crucial role in \nensuring the economic and financial viability of the project.  \n \n29. \nThe development of hydropower resources as an export commodity is a critical component \nof the Government of the Lao PDR\u2019s strategy to achieve its poverty reduction goal. A substantial \namount of financing from the private sector is required to build these projects. However, the private \nsector  continues  to  perceive  inherent  risks  in  supporting  these  types  of  projects  without  the \ninvolvement of development financial institutions, such as ADB. They find confidence to co-invest \nalongside ADB because the project will be financed in a structurally sound manner and will comply \nwith high environmental and social standards.  \n \n \n\n\f7 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n30. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  A  for  environment,  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  for \nindigenous people under the Safeguard Policy Statement. The potential environmental and social \nimpacts  and  risks  of  the  project  and  its  associated  facilities  were  identified  and  assessed  in  the \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  prepared  by  NN3PC  and  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  14 \nJanuary  2011.17 NN3PC  will  undertake  an  updated  comprehensive  biodiversity  study  on  project \nareas  commencing  in  the  last  quarter  of  2011  to  reconfirm  the  extent  of  conservation  and  offset \nprograms. An independent advisory panel, to be financed by ADB, will be constituted to assist the \ngovernment evaluate the impacts on biodiversity, assess the adequacy of recommended measures \nand  implement  an  effective  biodiversity  offset  programs  to  achieve  a  no  net  loss  of  biodiversity. \nMeasures to address the social impacts of the project are described in the draft resettlement and \nethnic minority development plan (REMDP) which has been initially posted on ADB\u2019s website on 6 \nJune  2011. 18  Broad  community  support  for  the  project  has  been  provided  by  Khmu  ethnic \ncommunity  living  in  Ban  Xiengdet  that  will  be  directly  affected  by  the  Project.  Such  support  is \ndocumented in meeting agreements and household level consent to relocate forms authenticated \nby village leaders. Effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts, and to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social protection requirements, are incorporated in \nthe  various  social  plans  in  the  REMDP.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  NN3PC  to \nmanage  the  project\u2019s  environmental  and  social  risks  are  deemed  adequate,19\n while  collaboration \nwith the NNRB Committee is considered crucial in managing cumulative impacts at the river basin \nlevel.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  have  been  and  will  be  conducted  in  accordance \nwith ADB requirements.  \n\nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n31. \nNN3PC has been advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date), and \nits  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practices  relating  to  the  combating  of  money \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the project documentation includes \nappropriate anti-corruption provisions and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance.  \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed direct loan is within ADB\u2019s approved medium-term, country, industry, single \n\n32. \nobligor, and group exposure limits for nonsovereign operations.  \n\nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the  Charter),20\n33. \n \nthe  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the \nproposed  assistance  to  Nam  Ngum  3  Power  Company.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance \ndocumentation,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the  proposed \nassistance by the Board of Directors. \n\n \n                                                \n17  GMS Lao Company Limited. 2011.
