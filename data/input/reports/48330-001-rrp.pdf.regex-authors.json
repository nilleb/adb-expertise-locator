I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nfacility of up to $475 million, comprising (i) an A-loan of up to $250 million; and (ii) a B-loan of up \nto $225 million, to Lukoil Overseas Shah Deniz (LOSD) for the Shah Deniz Stage II Gas Field \nExpansion Project in Azerbaijan.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  The Shah Deniz gas field is one of the world\u2019s largest gas fields, with 938 billion cubic \nmeters (bcm) of gas reserves. In 1996, the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic \n(SOCAR) signed the Shah Deniz Production Sharing Agreement (SDPSA) with six foreign oil \nand gas companies led by BP (the operator) for the exploration, development, and production of \nnatural resources from the Shah Deniz gas field. Construction and development of stage I of the \ngas field started in 2003 and gas production commenced in December 2006. In September \n2013, subsequent to the discovery of a new high-pressure reservoir within the Shah Deniz gas \nfield, gas supply agreements (GSAs) for the stage II expansion of the gas field were signed with \nnine European energy companies. In December 2013, the SDPSA partners announced their \ninvestment decision for development of stage II of the Shah Deniz gas field. \n \n3.  PJSC  Lukoil  (Lukoil  or  the  sponsor)  has  a  10%  interest  in  the  SDPSA.  Lukoil \napproached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in June 2014 to partly finance its share of the \ncapital expenditure for the project.2 From initial discussions between ADB and Lukoil, ADB \nviewed that the project possessed sound fundamentals, including the financial strength of the \nsponsor,  high-quality  project  preparatory  work,  an  experienced  operator,  and  strong  local \nemployment-generation potential. The project is the largest gas field development project to \ndate in Azerbaijan, and will help increase the total gas production in Azerbaijan from 20 bcm per \nannum in 2014 to 36 bcm per annum by 2022. ADB\u2019s experience in structuring emerging and \nfrontier market transactions will be crucial for the successful execution of the project and to \ndemonstrate  the  bankability  of  large-scale  financings  for  future  upstream  and  downstream \nprocessing projects in Azerbaijan. \n \n2.  Project Design \n4.  The  Shah  Deniz  gas  field  is  a  high-temperature,  high-pressure  gas  field  located \n70 kilometers  (km)  offshore  to  the  southeast  of  Baku,  lying  beneath  water  depths  of                 \n50\u2013500 meters. It has a reservoir thickness of more than 1,000 meters and is 22 km long. The \ngas field contains nine vertically stacked reservoir units, which are targeted for depletion in two \nstages. The gas-initially-in-place estimate for the gas field is 938 bcm.3 Stage I of the gas field \nhas been operational since December 2006.  \n   \n5.  Stage II development of the Shah Deniz gas field includes the construction of two new \nbridge-linked offshore production platforms, 26 subsea wells drilled with two semi-submersible \nrigs, 500 km of subsea pipelines, and expansion of the onshore gas processing terminal at \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Capital expenditures for the project are funded by SDPSA partners in proportion to their percent interest in the \nSDPSA. \n3  Gas initially in place refers to the total amount of gas that is potentially in a reserve. ", "2 \n \nSangachal. Gas extracted from the stage II development of the gas field will be delivered from \nAzerbaijan to Europe via the separate Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). The SGC consists of three \nsections: (i) the South Caucasus Pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Georgia\u2013Turkey border, \n(ii) the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline from the Georgia\u2013Turkey border to the Turkey\u2013\nGreece border, and (iii) the Trans Adriatic Pipeline from the Turkey\u2013Greece border to Italy.  \n \n6.  The SDPSA sets the basic principles, rights and obligations, production sharing, cost \nreimbursement, and other terms and conditions of the Shah Deniz project. A steering committee \nconsisting  of  an  equal  number  of  members  from  each  SDPSA  partner  is  responsible  for \nmanaging  the  consortium.  BP,  designated  as  the  operator  for  the  project  by  the  SDPSA \npartners, is responsible for construction and operation of the Shah Deniz gas field. SOCAR is \nresponsible for entering into GSAs on behalf of the SDPSA partners. The remaining SDPSA \npartners, including Lukoil, are purely financial investors and are not involved in day-to-day \noperations of the project. Table 1 lists the composition of the SDPSA. \n \nTable 1: Composition of the Shah Deniz Production Sharing Agreement \nCompany  Share of Total (%) \nBP  28.8 \nState Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic  16.7 \nTurkish Petroleum Overseas Corporation  19.0 \nPetronas  15.5 \nLukoil  10.0 \nNaftiran Intertrade Company  10.0 \n    Total   100.0 \nSource: BP. \n \n7.  After accounting for operating costs and capital expenditure, revenues from the project \nare shared between the SDPSA partners and the Government of Azerbaijan according to the \nterms and conditions specified in the SDPSA.  \n \n3.  The Borrower and the Sponsor \n8.  The borrower is LOSD, a company established with the sole purpose of developing \nLukoil\u2019s interest in the Shah Deniz project.  \n \nConfidential information deleted.  \n \n9.  The  sponsor,  Lukoil,  is  one  of  the  world\u2019s  leading  vertically  integrated  oil  and  gas \ncompanies active in exploration and production of oil and gas, production of petroleum products \nand petrochemicals, and marketing and distribution of these products. Lukoil does not have any \ngovernment  ownership,  and  its  equity  and  depository  receipts  are  traded  publicly  on  the \nFrankfurt, London, and Moscow stock exchanges. As of 6 July 2015, Lukoil had a market \ncapitalization of $36.6 billion and a long-term credit rating of BBB\u2013 from Standard & Poor\u2019s. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n10.  Impacts. The successful development of the stage II expansion of the Shah Deniz gas \nfield,  the  largest  natural  gas  field  in  Azerbaijan,  will  lead  to  the  following  beyond-project \ndevelopment  impacts.  First,  the  overall  Azerbaijan  natural  gas  sector  will  expand  by \nencouraging foreign operators to develop similar gas reserves and will bring in much-needed \ntechnical knowledge, development experience, and foreign capital. Second, the increase in gas \nproduction and opening of the European market to Azerbaijan gas exports will support regional \nintegration and diversify Azerbaijani exports of natural gas. Third, a successful experience of ", "  3\nforeign commercial banks financing a large project in Azerbaijan will help increase foreign direct \ninvestment for the development of other upstream gas field development projects as well as \nmidstream and downstream petrochemical projects, which use natural gas as feedstock. \n \n11.  Outcome. The project will result in successful production of natural gas from stage II of \nthe Shah Deniz gas field, with first production estimated in 2018 and peak production of 16 bcm \nper annum achieved by 2022.  \n \n12.  Outputs. Successful implementation of the project will result in the environmentally safe \nand technically sound development of the largest proven gas reserve in Azerbaijan. The project \nis also expected to generate employment for over 16,000 people during 2014\u20132022. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n13.  Consistency with ADB Strategy and country strategy. The project supports two of \nthe  five  core  areas  of  operations  under  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020:  infrastructure,  and  regional \ncooperation and integration.4 Catalyzing investments by increasing private sector participation is \none of the five strategic drivers of change under Strategy 2020. Following its Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020, ADB is committed to be a provider of catalytic solutions to upper middle-income \ncountries such as Azerbaijan, which include increasing leveraging opportunities with private \ncapital.5 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for \nAzerbaijan,  which  supports  ADB\u2019s  participation  in the  development  of  natural resources  in \ninstances where it would be instrumental in attracting third-party commercial sources of credit.6 \nADB\u2019s presence in such transactions will help these projects adopt international due diligence, \ngovernance, and transparency standards. \n \n14.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations. The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which provides for assistance to gas field development, \nand  transportation  and  distribution  of  gas.7 The  policy  also  promotes  effective  regional \ncooperation in the energy sector to strengthen energy security. ADB endorsed the Extractive \nIndustries  Transparency  Initiative  (EITI)  in  2008  and  became  a  supporting  organization  to \nenhance revenue transparency in ADB-assisted energy extractive projects. Azerbaijan has been \nan EITI member country since February 2009, and regularly publishes publicly available reports \nwhich disclose revenues earned from the extraction of its natural resources as well as the taxes \nand other payments received from foreign oil and gas companies operating in the country. The \nSDPSA has also been publicly disclosed. \n \n15.  The project strongly complements ADB\u2019s ongoing initiatives in the energy sector in the \nregion. ADB\u2019s continued intervention in oil and gas in the region will help improve standards of \ncorporate governance and transparency in the sector. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n16.  In addition to the initial capital expenditure, development of the stage II expansion of the \nShah Deniz gas field will require ongoing capital expenditure as new wells must be drilled to \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2008.

The above capital expenditure will be separately funded by each of the SDPSA partners \nin proportion to their percent interest in the SDPSA. Lukoil, with its 10% interest in the SDPSA, \nis required to fund $2,859 million of the total project cost.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  Table 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.8 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  SOCAR has the authority to carry out exploration and development of all crude oil and \nnatural gas resources in Azerbaijan, including the portion of the Caspian Sea within the \njurisdiction of Azerbaijan. Exploration, development, and production from the Shah Deniz \ngas field is being carried out under the SDPSA. The SDPSA sets the basic principles, rights \nand obligation, production sharing, cost reimbursement, and other terms and conditions for \nthe Shah Deniz project. The current composition of the SDPSA is as follows: BP (28.8%), \nSOCAR (16.7%), Petronas (15.5%), Turkish Petroleum Corporation (19%), PJSC Lukoil \n(10%), and Naftiran Intertrade Company (10%). The SDPSA governs the main \ncompensation and cost recovery mechanism, which compensates the SDPSA operator (BP) \nfor all operating costs. The balance of the production is shared between the Government of \nAzerbaijan and SDPSA partners according to an industry typical R-factor model, which \ncompensates the SDPSA partners at higher levels when capital expenditure is higher. \nOperations  The CUPA governs the sale of gas from the Shah Deniz gas field to the eventual end-use \narrangements  off-takers. BP is appointed as the sellers\u2019 representative and agent for the sale of gas to \nRevenue structure  AGSC. The shareholder composition of AGSC is similar to that of the SDPSA. For the sale \nof gas from the stage II development of the Shah Deniz gas field, AGSC has entered into \n25-year GSAs for with European buyers and Turkish buyers. AGSC has also entered into \nGSA options with buyers in Azerbaijan and Georgia. In addition, each party to the SDPSA \nhas the right to sell the by-product condensate from the Shah Deniz gas field in proportion to \ntheir shareholding.  \nTransportation  Gas extracted under the project will be delivered to end-use off-takers via the SGC. The \narrangements  SGC consists of three sections: the South Caucasus Pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the \nGeorgia\u2013Turkey border, the TANAP from the Georgia\u2013Turkey border to the Turkey\u2013Greece \nborder, and the TAP from the Turkey\u2013Greece border to Italy. AGSC has entered into gas \ntransportation agreements with the South Caucasus Pipeline, the TANAP, and the TAP. The \ngas transportation agreements are coterminous with the GSAs. \nImplementation period  Gas production from stage II is expected to commence in 2018, gradually ramping up during \n2018\u20132021 and stabilizing at 16 bcm per annum from 2022 onward. \nConstruction   \narrangements \nEngineering,  BP, as SDPSA operator, will construct the main offshore works and will subcontract \nprocurement, and  specialized subsea construction works and onshore construction works to a number of \nconstruction  contractors.  \nOperation and  BP has been designated as the operator of the project by the SDPSA partners, and will be \nmaintenance  responsible for operation and maintenance activities. \nPerformance  Key performance indicators will be reported by LOSD and monitored by the Asian \nmonitoring  Development Bank and other senior lenders. In addition, during the construction phase, the \nsenior lenders will appoint an independent lenders\u2019 technical advisor to monitor progress \nand verify project completion on behalf of the lenders. \n                                                \n8  Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n19.  Confidential information deleted. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n20.  The proposed ADB assistance to LOSD to finance its share of the Shah Deniz stage II \ngas field expansion project comprises (i) an A-loan of up to $250 million, and (ii) a B-loan of up \nto $225 million. ADB will fund the A-loan from its ordinary capital resources, while the B-loan will \nbe funded by participating international commercial banks. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n21.  The proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  The ADB loan will play a leading catalytic role as it facilitates the raising of large-\nscale, long-term, commercial project financing from international banks, which \nwill set a precedent for international banks to participate in upcoming projects in \nthe oil and gas sector in the country.  \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  transaction  will  further  consolidate  Azerbaijan\u2019s \ncommitment under the EITI to improve corporate governance and transparency \nin the oil and gas sector in the country.  \n \nC.  Risks \n22.  Timely completion of the Southern Gas Corridor. If all three components of the SGC \nare not constructed and commissioned before project completion, the SDPSA partners will face \nloss in revenue and/or liquidated damages under the GSAs to European and Turkish off-takers.  \n \n23.  Demand risk. Overall gas demand in Europe is expected to grow at an average 0.5% \nper annum from 2015 to 2027. While demand from the residential sector is likely to remain \nstable because of the increasing focus on energy efficiency measures, demand from the power \ngeneration sector is expected to grow at 1.4% per annum during 2015\u20132027 as Europe seeks to \nreduce its reliance on coal-fired and nuclear power plants.  \n \n24.  Gas and condensate pricing risk. The US dollar gas sale price in the various GSAs is \nbased on a formula linked to European gas prices at the Italian Punto di Scambio Virtuale (PSV) \nhub and/or Dated Brent crude oil prices. The condensate sale price is linked to the Dated Brent \ncrude oil prices. The outlook for gas prices in 2015 remains negative. Continued low gas and \ncrude oil prices beyond project completion in 2019 will reduce cash flows from the project.  \n \n25.  Sponsor risk. Although the recent drop in global oil prices has affected the financial \nperformance of the sponsor, Lukoil\u2019s long-term credit rating remains at investment grade (BBB\u2013) \nand is underpinned by Lukoil\u2019s relatively low leverage, strong liquidity, large resource base, and \nstable profitability.  \n ", "6 \n \n26.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory  A  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements for financing of existing facilities, an environmental and social \ncompliance  audit  for  the  existing  facilities  of  stage  I  of  the  project  (SD  I)  and  ongoing \nconstruction activities as part of stage II expansion of the gas field (SD II) was carried out. The \naudit did not find any non-compliance of ADB policies associated with the ongoing construction \nactivities. The institutional capacity and commitment of the borrower to cause the operator to \nmanage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n31.  The borrower will be required to ensure that the operator will comply with national labor \nlaws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy, will take measures to comply with the \ninternationally recognized core labor standards.9 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on \nthe compliance of the operator (and its contractors) with such laws.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n32.  LOSD was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n33.  The proposed loans are within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n34.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 10  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of Azerbaijan has no objection to the proposed assistance to LOSD.
