THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Tamil Nadu Industrial Connectivity Project. \n \n2.  The project will upgrade and maintain about 590 kilometers (km) of 16 state highways to \n(i) enhance transport connectivity and facilitate industrial development in line with the regional \neconomic corridor development plan for the Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor (CKIC), \nand  (ii)  improve  the  road  network's  sustainability  through  performance-based  maintenance \n(PBM).1 The project will also include initiatives to build institutional capacity in the Tamil Nadu \nHighways and Minor Ports Department (TNHD), focusing on its knowledge and research function, \nroad safety improvement, and sector planning capacity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  State context. Tamil Nadu is the southernmost state of India, stretched along the Bay of \nBengal, and borders the states of, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. With an area of \n130,000 square km, it is India\u2019s 10th largest state. The western and northwestern parts of Tamil \nNadu are hilly, featuring the Western and Eastern Ghats, and are rich in vegetation. The central \nand eastern parts are generally fertile plains, but arid in some central and southern districts. The \ntotal population in 2016 was estimated at about 78 million.2 Major cities such as Chennai, \nCoimbatore, Erode, Madurai, Salem, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, and Tiruppur are in the center of \nthe plains or near the Eastern Ghats in the northwest. \n \n4.  Tamil Nadu has the second-largest state economy in India after Maharashtra.3 With robust \neconomic growth averaging about 8.5% since fiscal year (FY) 2006, it recorded a steady decline \nin poverty from 28.9% in 2004\u20132005 to 11.2% in 2011\u20132012, translating into an average annual \npoverty reduction rate of 12.7%, well above the national average of 7.3% for the same period. Its \npoverty levels are lower than those of most other states in India.4 While Tamil Nadu has \ntraditionally been agrarian, agriculture now contributes less than 10% of the gross state domestic \nproduct. Instead, manufacturing and some service industries such as finance and real estate are \nmajor drivers of growth. Tamil Nadu ranks first among Indian states in the number of factories \nand industrial workers, and has one of India\u2019s most diversified and modern industrial bases, \nsupplemented by strong foreign direct investment. It leads in several manufacturing industries, \nincluding automobiles, engineering, pharmaceuticals, garments, textile products, and aerospace. \n \n5.   Despite  the  growth  and  progress  in  poverty  reduction,  Tamil  Nadu  faces  several \neconomic and social challenges. From FY2013 to FY2020, its economy posted average annual \ngrowth of 7.0%, markedly lower than the 10.3% average of the preceding 6 years. Tamil Nadu\u2019s \nper capita net domestic product was the third highest among the major Indian states in FY2012, \nafter Maharashtra and Haryana, but plunged to sixth place in FY2019, overtaken by Gujarat, \n \n1  Details of the upgrades are in para. 27 and Technical Features of the Proposed Project (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n2  Government of Tamil Nadu, Department of Economics and Statistics. 2018. Statistical Handbook 2018. Chennai. \n3  Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. 2020. Gross State Domestic Product. \nNew Delhi. \n4  Tamil Nadu has one of the highest numbers of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in India, which could have \na substantial negative impact on the state economy in FY2021. \n ", "2 \nKarnataka, and Kerala.5 Both the poverty ratio and human development index vary among \ndistricts; rural areas, away from industrial hubs such as Chennai and Coimbatore, are still \nexperiencing low incomes, and their poverty levels remain high, exceeding 30% of the population \nin some districts.6 Consumption inequality in the state is higher than the national average. Tamil \nNadu needs to transform its economy to become more value-added, further develop its industrial \nbases with efficient value chains, and expand these economic activities throughout the state for \ninclusive growth. \n \n6.  Strategic plan for the state's development. In 2012, the Government of Tamil Nadu \nunveiled Vision Tamil Nadu 2023, a strategic plan for infrastructure development synchronized \nwith economic transformation.7 To achieve upper middle-income per capita status for the state, \nVision Tamil Nadu 2023 identifies the key areas for economic acceleration, such as increasing \nthe share of manufacturing, energizing small and medium-sized enterprises, focusing on skills \ndevelopment,  and  providing  the  best  infrastructure  services,  including  the  development  of \nindustrial corridors. \n \n7.  East Coast Economic Corridor. The Government of India has initiated an \u201cindustrial \ncorridor approach\u201d to stimulate manufacturing and an \u201cAct East\u201d policy to integrate the Indian \neconomy with Asia\u2019s dynamic global production  networks. The industrial corridor approach \ninvolves  the  creation  of  an  efficient  multimodal  transport  network  supported  by  quality \ninfrastructure and logistics within a defined geography, and a policy framework that facilitates \nbusiness operations for integration with global production networks. Industrial corridors are also \ncentral to India\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative, which encourages investments in manufacturing to \nstimulate growth and create high-quality jobs. In line with these policies, the government and the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) identified the East Coast Economic Corridor (ECEC)\u2014India\u2019s \nfirst coastal corridor\u2014stretching more than 2,500 km from West Bengal to Tamil Nadu. The ECEC \naims to stimulate growth through network externalities, links with urban and industrial clusters, \nand integration in regional value chains in Southeast and East Asia through the ports along the \ncoastline, including Chennai and Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu serving as major ports.  \n \n8.  The CKIC (para. 2) is proposed as the second phase of the ECEC, covering 23 of the \n32 districts between Chennai and Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu as its influence areas.8 The \nobjectives of the CKIC are to promote manufacturing competitiveness and job creation in the \ncorridor, increase the manufacturing industry\u2019s participation in global value chains and production \nnetworks, and serve as a key driver to achieving Vision Tamil Nadu 2023. The ADB-supported \ncomprehensive development plan (CDP) for the CKIC9 established a strategy for the industrial \ntransformation by introducing industrial nodes to promote manufacturing bases with comparative \nadvantages.10 The CDP also identified nearly 200 projects in the transport, energy, and urban \nsectors to underpin the industrial growth strategy. ADB\u2019s overarching approach for the CKIC has \n \n5  Tamil Nadu\u2019s per capita net domestic product in FY2019 was about $2,600. \n6  Government of Tamil Nadu. 2017. Tamil Nadu Human Development Report 2017. Chennai. \n7  Government of Tamil Nadu. 2012. Vision Tamil Nadu 2023: Strategic Plan for Infrastructure Development in Tamil \nNadu. Chennai. In the road subsector of the strategic plan, the following investment requirements were identified to \nsupport the strategy: (i) enhancement of 2,000 km of trunk roads between Chennai and major towns into 6- or 8-lane \ncorridors; (ii) modernization of state highways covering 5,000 km of four-lane highways; (iii) improvements of other \nstate highways and major roads for a total length of 2,700 km, including improvements to pavements, cross-sections \nsuch as paved shoulders, and bypasses; and (iv) an upgrade of 8,080 km of major district roads. \n8  The Visakhapatnam\u2013Chennai Industrial Corridor, also supported by ADB, represents the first phase of the ECEC. \n9  ADB. 2017. Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor: Comprehensive Development Plan. Manila. \n10 Six industrial nodes were identified: (i) Cuddalore and Nagapattinam, (ii) Ariyalur and Perambalur, (iii) Tiruchirappalli\u2013\nPudukottai\u2013Sivaganga, (iv) Madurai\u2013Dindigul\u2013Virudhunagar\u2013Theni, (v) Ramanathapuram, and (vi) Thoothukudi and \nTirunelveli. \n ", "3 \nplayed a significant role in guiding priority infrastructure for economic corridor development, and \nalso served as a catalyst for attracting targeted investments by the private sector. Responding to \nthe identified development needs, ADB supported the government\u2019s effort to create a physical \nand institutional enabling environment for economic transformation through investment loans in \nenergy and urban infrastructure and through technical assistance projects (para. 18). \n \n9.  Road transport for industrial development. Tamil Nadu\u2019s road network is dense and \nwell laid out, providing basic access to the state\u2019s population and economic activity centers.11 \nHowever, many state highways still need to be improved for smoother transport.12 The CDP \nprojected that nearly 90% of major roads would not fully provide stable traffic flow services in 2025 \nbecause of increasing traffic demand in the area. Since the logistics costs of the CKIC\u2019s targeted \nindustries are estimated at 3%\u201310% of the total production costs, seamless road connectivity \nbetween industrial clusters, transport gateways, and consumption centers would be critical for \ngreater competitiveness. The CDP\u2019s road capacity and service level assessments identified a \npriority road network of 7,653 km, including four trunk routes and 76 lateral grid connections, to \nbe upgraded for well-connected regional transport networks that will link the potential industrial \ngrowth centers and the rural hinterland with the trunk routes, international ports, and high-density \nurban areas.13 The transport sector, aligned with the industrial development strategy, will promote \nconnectivity to global value chains and markets, including in Asian countries, and cater to the \nvalue-adding manufacturing industry. \n \n10.  The project is part of the identified priority road network and selected for ADB financing in \nthe CDP to improve lateral road connectivity for industrial development, as conceptualized under \nthe CKIC.14 It also aligns with Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 and the basic policies for Tamil Nadu\u2019s \nroad transport development.15 \n \n11.  Emerging challenges in road sector. In addition to the road transport needs, the road \nauthorities must meet several other challenges. Road safety, in particular, is a growing concern \nin Tamil Nadu. In 2018, the total number of road crashes in India was reported at 467,044, causing \ninjuries to 469,418 individuals and claiming 151,417 lives. Tamil Nadu topped the number of road \ncrashes nationwide with a share of 13.7%, followed by Madhya Pradesh with 11.0%.16 It is \nimperative to involve all stakeholders in road safety improvements, and any such measures must \nbe implemented on a pilot basis and then standardized as good practice. Also, road authorities \nneed to strengthen their institutional capacity to apply newly developed material, equipment, and \nconstruction and maintenance methods to road projects and thus obtain better value for money, \nincluding greater road safety, climate change resilience, and private sector involvement. \n \n \n11 Tamil Nadu has 66,039 km of major roads, of which national highways account for 10%, state highways for 17%, \nand major district roads for 18%. \n12 While 47% of the national highways are multi-lane (four lanes or more), nearly 80% of state highways still have only \ntwo lanes or even just one. \n13 The four trunk routes are: (i) East Coast Road; (ii) NH32, NH 132, SH 83, NH 38; (iii) NH 44 NS; and (iv) NH36 and \nSH42. All except the northern part of NH44 NS fall into the CKIC influence areas. East Coast Road and NH32, 132, \n83, 38/southern part of NH44 NS are considered spines of the CKIC. NH36 and SH42 are running between the \nspines in parallel. \n14 Two project roads (SH79 and SH86) are not part of the priority road network defined in the CDP but are included in \nthe scope of the project. They are considered extensions of the priority road network to link a trunk road and core \ncities in the neighboring districts of CKIC influence areas. The two roads are still part of the core road network of \nTamil Nadu and included in the improvement of state highways under Vision Tamil Nadu 2023. \n15 Government of Tamil Nadu, Highways Department. 2019.

The project aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, which emphasizes boosting economic competitiveness to create \nmore and better jobs by expanding the infrastructure network for transport and energy along \neconomic corridors, including the ECEC; and addressing climate change and increasing climate \nresilience.17 The project is listed in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023 for \nIndia.18 It contributes to the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 through (i) reducing \nremaining poverty and inequalities and (ii) promoting rural development and food security by \ncascading economic and social benefits from growth centers to nearby areas; (iii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality in employment opportunities, capacity strengthening and safety \nconcerns; (iv) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability of roads; (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity in \nroad safety, research, and planning; and (vi) fostering regional cooperation and integration by \nimproving the lateral connectivity to major ports for global production networks.19 \n \n13.  Lessons  from  previous  assistance  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners. \nPrevious road transport projects\u2014e.g., Uttarakhand State-Road Investment Program, Madhya \nPradesh State Roads Project III, and National Highway Sector II Project\u2014have shown the need \nfor (i) stronger post-construction maintenance, including contractual arrangements; (ii) measures \nto  improve  contractors\u2019  performance;  and  (iii)  greater  focus  on  the  selection  of  qualified \ncontractors in multiple contract procurement.20 The TNHD implemented two similar state highway \nprojects funded by the World Bank. A review of the first project stressed the need to pay adequate \nattention to the empowerment of dedicated implementation units, and also highlighted the merits \nof successful land acquisition through private negotiations.21 An implementation report on the \nsecond project rated the overall implementation progress satisfactory.22 Although the public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  (PPP)  modality  caused  substantial  delays,  9  out  of  10  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  (EPC)  contracts  were  completed. 23  These  lessons  and \nexperiences  were  fed  into  the  design  of  the  proposed  project  and  its  implementation \narrangements, resulting in longer PBM contracts, incentives for early completion, a strengthened \nproject implementation unit (PIU), the introduction of multiple contract award criteria in the bid \ndocuments, and land acquisition through the approved private negotiation procedures. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: economic prosperity and employment \ngeneration with inclusive growth achieved (footnote 7). It will have the following outcome: capacity, \nconnectivity, efficiency, and safety of the highway system increased (footnote 15).24 \n \n \n17 ADB. 2017.

Output 1: State highways upgraded and maintained. The project will upgrade about \n590 km of 16 state highways in the CKIC influence and its neighboring areas with (i) engineering \ndesign features of climate change adaptation and road safety, and (ii) 7-year PBM.25 \n \n16.  Output 2: Capacity in road safety, sector planning, and research enhanced. The loan \nwill support (i) strengthening of the knowledge and research function of the Highway Research \nStation  (HRS)  by  developing  its  institutional  strategy  and  by  modernizing  its  organization, \nbusiness process, facilities, and equipment to pursue better value for money in the sector; \n(ii) development  and  piloting  of  road  safety  improvement  program  in  accident-increasing \nurbanizing areas by introducing (a) standard operating procedures among stakeholders; and \n(b) advanced technologies for material, road facilities, monitoring methods, reporting system, and \nenforcement; and (iii) enhancement of sector planning capacity, including (a) examination of \ninnovative contract modalities involving more private sector participation in road service provision, \n(b) development of sector strategic direction to address evolving technology, and (c) preparation \nfor implementation plan to eliminate traffic bottlenecks such as railway level crossings.26 \n \n17.  Contract modality. The Government of Tamil Nadu has introduced several innovative \ncontract modalities to better involve the private sector in the development of major state roads. \nThese include EPC, PPP (annuity), PBM, design\u2013build\u2013operate and transfer, and output- and \nperformance-based contracts. The EPC modality with 7-year PBM was selected because of the \n(i) non-revenue-generating project features, (ii) lack of interest by market forces in PPP contracts, \nand (iii) financial difficulties in the private sector caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic. The EPC\u2013PBM modality will ensure the maximum use of private players' engineering, \nconstruction, and maintenance capacity, and achieve efficiency and quality gains by combining \nthe three phases of design, construction, and maintenance into one contract. This will also \nimprove asset quality and service levels. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n18.  With strategic planning support from ADB, the CDP for the CKIC was prepared, which \nincludes an infrastructure strategy to drive economic growth, high-potential industrial sectors, and \na set of priority projects. The CKIC, with its long coastline and strategically located ports, provides \nmultiple international gateways to connect India with vibrant global production networks and to \nfacilitate  regional  integration.  The  CDP  identifies  the  CKIC\u2019s  high  potential  for  generating \nadditional employment and industrial output. ADB\u2019s strong ties with the implementing agencies \nfor urban, energy, transport, and regional cooperation enable an integrated, multidisciplinary, and \ncross-sector approach to developing the infrastructure required for an economic corridor.27 The \ninfrastructure investments are further complemented by ADB\u2019s support for soft components, such \nas a detailed master plan study of industrial nodes, greater ease of doing business, single-window \nplatform for investment facilitation, and stronger dialogue with investors.28 This road project is the \n \n25 The PBM includes overlay works in the sixth year of the maintenance period. \n26 Highway Research Station is an institution in the TNHD established in 1954 to provide technical guidance on road \nconstruction and maintenance, including road safety. \n27 ADB. 2018.

Replication strategy. ADB\u2019s value addition is also to facilitate the government in creating \npositive external effects that can spill over to or be replicated in other states or projects. To \nachieve this, project activities were chosen based on their potential for wider replication, level of \nmaturity,  and  the  participating  agencies\u2019  capacity.  The  road  safety  improvement  program, \ntargeted at urbanizing areas with a rapidly changing safety environment, will be prepared as a \ncomprehensive road safety approach that (i) involves roadside residents, including women, as \nwell as all government agencies concerned; and (ii) introduces advanced safety technologies.29 \nThe government agencies may later refine and use these approaches for further replication in \nother states or projects. The strengthening of the HRS as a knowledge and research hub will underpin \nthe effective application of newly developed road safety technologies and help the government \nimprove the performance of the whole road sector. From a road management perspective, the \nintroduction of several innovative contract modalities that involve private players in road service \nprovision (para.17) yielded varying implementation results, so the project will support the TNHD\u2019s \neffort to review and refine the modalities for possible replication. These capacity development \ncomponents will add value to the project by creating spillover impacts beyond the project scope, and \ncan be used by the government as a tool for replication initiatives.30 The economic corridor strategic \nplanning is another key initiative in the project for effective regional development. ADB is assisting in \nadopting the similar strategic approach in other states of India to promote investments in critical \ninfrastructure and reforms to attract private investments. Good practices and models obtained from \nthe project and the strategic planning approach will be further channeled and disseminated through \nthe Capacity Development Resource  Center in  ADB\u2019s India  Resident Mission to facilitate the \ngovernment in replicating these good practices and learnings in other states. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $904.60 million (Table 1).  \n \n21.  Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM).31 Civil  works  and  consulting  services  are  the  major \nexpenditure items under the project. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The climate change impact on the project is rated high. A climate change assessment \nindicated high risk of flooding caused by increased rainfall because of climate change.32 The \nfrequency of extreme rainfall events is projected to increase, particularly in western hilly and \neastern coastal areas. Drainage will be improved to cope with higher flooding frequency and to \nprovide higher discharge capacities. Bridges and culverts will be resized and redesigned to secure \nsmoother water flow. Road embankments will be raised in critical sections to prevent water \nstagnation  and  flooding  impacts,  and  slopes  will  be  protected  through  bioengineering  and \nstructural measures. Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $53.13 million. ADB will finance 80% \nof the adaptation costs. \n \n \n32 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 31). Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2021\u2013December 2026 \nEstimated completion  31 December 2026 \ndate \nEstimated loan closing  30 June 2027 \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  State of Tamil Nadu acting through its Highways and Minor Ports \nDepartment (PIU, Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor Project) \n(ii)  Implementation  One PIU and six field implementation units with one project director, 74 \nunit  engineers, 224 supporting staff, environmental wing, and institutional \ncapacity enhancement and road safety cell.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on \nthe project has been reviewed by ADB and the TNHD. Because most materials and resources \nrequired for the implementation can be secured locally or domestically, COVID-19 is not expected \nto cause any significant delays or cost increases; however, the project may attract fewer bidders \n ", "9 \nbecause of potential financial difficulties caused by the pandemic. While no changes to the \nimplementation arrangements are considered necessary at this stage, the TNHD continues to \nmonitor the procurement performance closely, and work effectively within the constraints and \nsafety requirements imposed by the government\u2019s response to the pandemic. The project's \nimplementation, on the other hand, will have a positive impact on the local economy through the \nconstruction value chain and the generation of local employment. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  The project was assessed as technically viable. The TNHD prepared the engineering \ndesign of the project roads during project preparation. The engineering design follows applicable \ncriteria in line with Indian Roads Congress regulations. The upgrades will involve the expansion \nof lanes and shoulders, overlay of pavement, construction of bypasses in congested areas, \nreplacement of aging bridges and culverts, realignment of sharp curves, railway overpasses \n(instead of level crossings), road redesigns for climate resilience, installation of road safety \nfacilities, and construction of bus bays and shelters. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n28.  The project is economically viable. The economic evaluation of the project was undertaken \nin accordance with ADB guidelines by comparing life-cycle economic costs and benefits in with-\nproject and without-project scenarios, against an assumed hurdle rate of 9% as decision criteria.33 \nThe quantified benefits include savings in vehicle operation costs and travel time, as well as a \nreduction in carbon dioxide emissions. The overall economic internal rate of return is estimated \nto be 18.4%. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the project.34 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n29.  The project will not generate revenue. Once the 7-year PBM period is over, the TNHD will \nassume responsibility for maintenance through regular budget allocations in each financial year. \nThe budgetary requirements for maintaining the project road assets will decrease in the first \n20 years after construction because of (i) lower routine maintenance costs thanks to improved \nroad conditions, (ii) the inclusion of PBM contracts, and (iii) sixth-year overlay works as part of \nthe PBM. The state's annual budget allocation to routine maintenance was about \u20b910 billion on \naverage during FY2016\u2013FY2020, which is about 10%\u201312% of the total annual road budget.35 At \npresent, TNHD is capable of maintaining most state highways and major district roads in fairly \ngood condition with the current level of maintenance budget, established road asset management \nsystem for efficient maintenance planning and resource allocation, as well as the involvement of \nthe private sector in road maintenance. In fact, less than 10% of the roads are now in poor \ncondition. The required recurrent costs of the project roads are estimated to be about 0.7% of the \nTNHD maintenance budget. The TNHD has committed to prioritize the allocation of maintenance \nfunding for the project roads. \n \n33 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n34 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The possible impact \nof COVID-19 on traffic demand was also assessed in the traffic demand forecast and the sensitivity analysis. The \neconomic internal rate of return varies among project roads from 10.2% to 25.2%. \n35 In addition, about \u20b910 billion is allocated annually to periodic maintenance under the Improvement to Riding Quality \nProgramme. Some road improvement works are also carried out as part of the Comprehensive Road Infrastructure \nDevelopment Programme, with an annual budget of about \u20b927 billion on average during FY2016\u2013FY2020. \n ", "10 \nD.  Governance \n \n30.  Institutional. The TNHD will implement the project through a PIU based in Chennai. \nBecause the project covers a large geographic area, six field implementation units (FIUs) and four \nfield-level land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation (LARR) units were set up to support \nthe PIU. Many of the staff members in the PIU and FIUs have experience in implementing World \nBank-funded projects, and have sufficient capacity to prepare and implement the ADB project. \nConsultants  to  be  engaged  under the  project  will  support  the  PIU  in  the  areas  of  project \nmanagement, supervision, reporting, financial management, and safeguard monitoring. \n \n31.  Financial  management.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is \nmoderate, mainly because the TNHD has not previously implemented ADB-supported projects \nand because the large geographical spread of the project carries inherent risk. The TNHD is \nfamiliar with the requirements for maintaining separate project records and accounts from working \nwith the World Bank. The identified risks will be mitigated through the provision of training on ADB \npolicies and procedures, the appointment of a qualified financial expert to the PIU, and the \nimplementation of a comprehensive project financial management manual. The PIU has already \ndrafted such a manual with detailed policies and procedures governing internal controls, financial \nmanagement, and financial reporting. \n \n32.  Procurement and value for money. The project procurement risk is rated medium. The \nrisk assessment concluded that the executing agency, although new to ADB's procurement \npolicies and regulations, has significant experience in procuring and managing civil works and \nconsulting contracts under both national and World Bank regulations. All major procurement \npackages will be subject to prior review to avoid any risks of noncompliance in the procurement \nprocess. The procurement of 16 civil works packages and the recruitment of consulting services \nis progressing well under advance action.36 The project's value for money is being optimized \nthrough  strategic  procurement  planning  and  a  risk-managed  approach  as  follows:  open \ncompetitive bidding; use of eProcurement; application of the EPC contract modality with 7-year \nPBM; works contracts packaged based on project readiness, market capacity, and geographical \nproximity; and application of multiple contract evaluation criteria and early completion bonus. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  TNHD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 31). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  Poverty. The average poverty level in Tamil Nadu is lower than the national rate as a \nresult of relatively higher average incomes, but income disparity within the state is significant \n(para. 5). The project will improve state highways to link potential industrial growth areas and their \nhinterland; beneficiaries, including the poor, will benefit from better access to basic services and \njobs. The project will also enable economic growth through industrial development along the \nproject roads. Its preparation involved consultations with local community members, both women \nand men, who were generally supportive of the project, saying that the road improvements would \nenhance mobility between commercial centers and thus increase economic and employment \nopportunities. \n \n \n36 Bids for all 16 civil works contracts have been invited, and requests for proposals for all five supervision consulting \ncontracts were issued.  \n ", "11 \n35.  Gender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  road \ninfrastructure improvements will yield several gender-related advantages, such as better access \nto health and education services, more income opportunities, affordable and reliable transport \nfacilities for safe mobility, better implementation of government outreach programs, and reduced \ntime poverty. Tamil Nadu generally fares better than other states of India on several important \ngender  parameters.37 The  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  (GESI)  action  plan  defines \nindicators and targets, responsible agencies, and time frames to ensure effective implementation, \nmonitoring, and reporting of GESI activities. This includes (i) considering the specific needs and \nsafety concerns of different users\u2014the elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities\u2014in \nthe  design,  upgrade,  and  maintenance  of  roads  and  facilities;  (ii)  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment to attract women to construction work and participation in the PIU and FIUs; \n(iii) involving  women's  self-help  groups  in  road  maintenance;  (iv)  involving  women  in  the \nimplementation of afforestation programs; (v) ensuring community participation in road safety \nimprovements; (vi) rolling out various awareness-raising programs; and (vii) collecting sex-\ndisaggregated  data  during  the  baseline  survey,  subproject  monitoring,  and  project  impact \nassessment.38 \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.39 \n \n37.  Environment (category B). Since the project will upgrade existing state highways, most \nof the road works will follow existing alignments, except for the partial realignment of curves and \nbypass construction. The TNHD prepared initial environmental examination (IEE) reports for the \n16 project roads in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. Potential adverse impacts \nidentified are mostly construction-related dust, noise, vibration, pollution, soil erosion, waste, and \noccupational health and safety concerns; and some induced noise and air quality impacts during \noperation. The COVID-19 situation necessitates special attention to occupational and community \nhealth and safety measures under the project, closely monitored by the PIU and construction \nsupervision consultants. No significant, irreversible environmental impacts are anticipated, and \nnone of the roads is located inside any critical habitat. Mitigation measures to manage all identified \nimpacts and risks were captured and budgeted in the road-specific environmental management \nand monitoring plans. However, two project roads, SH63 and SH191, border with bird sanctuaries, \nand another road, SH40-2, runs near the boundary of a reserved forest that forms part of a tiger \nreserve.40 The biodiversity and critical habitat assessments established that the sanctuaries are \ncritical habitats for migratory birds, and potential impacts on biodiversity were assessed to be of \nmedium risk, whereas physical barriers separate SH40-2 from the reserved forest, which makes \nimpacts on wildlife and other species unlikely. With implementation of the mitigation measures \nand habitat improvement activities, the project will not result in significant residual environmental \nimpacts. Biodiversity action plans were prepared for SH63 and SH191 to mitigate biodiversity-\nrelated risks, including habitat improvement activities to ensure no net loss or achieve net gain of \n \n37 Details are in Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n38 The road design includes well-marked crossings, safety signage, 1.5 meters pedestrian walkways in urban locations, \nrailings along roads, covered drains, paved shoulder, speed bumps, rumble strips, guard stones, and solar blinkers. \n39 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n40 Vanduvoor Bird Sanctuary (SH63) and Vettangudi Bird Sanctuary (SH191). The roads fall into eco-sensitive zones \nof the sanctuaries for short sections of 1.85 km and 3.7 km, respectively. SH40-2 road is located 750 meters from \nthe edge of the Kolundumamalai Reserved Forest, which is largely separated from the core zone of the Kalakkad \nMundanthurai Tiger Reserve. \n ", "12 \nbiodiversity under the project. The implementation of the biodiversity action plan, environmental \nmanagement plan, construction activities, and road operation of up to 1 year will be independently \nmonitored by a third party for SH63, SH191, and SH40-2. Public consultations were held for all \nproject roads during the detailed project report and IEE preparation. IEE reports are available \nfrom  the  TNHD  and  disclosed  on  ADB  and  project  websites  in  compliance  with  ADB's \nrequirements on information disclosure and meaningful consultation. \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project minimizes involuntary resettlement \nimpacts by constructing bypasses in congested areas and revisiting the lane configurations of \nsome project roads. Still, about 448 hectares of private land will be required for the 16 project \nroads, and about 14,100 households (or 59,500 individuals) will be affected by land acquisition \nand resettlement.41 Of the 2,340 significantly affected households (totaling 10,165 individuals), \n1,166 (4,759 individuals) are affected by physical displacement; 945 (4,463 individuals) by \neconomic displacement; and 229 (943 individuals) by both physical and economic displacement. \nThe TNHD has drafted 16 resettlement plans following the Right to Fair Compensation and \nTransparency  in  Land  Acquisition,  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Act  (2013)  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The plans outline the entitlements, summary of public consultations \nand information disclosure, grievance redress mechanism, and institutional arrangements to \nensure orderly implementation. They were prepared based on preliminary resettlement surveys, \nsocial assessments, and consultations, and will be updated based on the information gathered \nduring the award enquiry phase.42 All involuntary resettlement impacts were adequately assessed, \nand all stakeholders, including affected individuals, were meaningfully consulted. The TNHD is \nfound to have the capacity and the commitment to ensure that land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities are carried out adequately and in accordance with all applicable requirements. It will \nengage  an  external monitor to  validate the  implementation  of the resettlement  plans.  The \nGovernment of Tamil Nadu also approved the approach to acquire private land and assets \nthrough  direct  purchase.  Any  land  acquisition  under  this  approach  shall  be  independently \nmonitored by a third party in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples (category B). The social impact assessment conducted by the \nTNHD indicates that project road SH58-2 will involve the relocation of 41 tribal households (or \n159 individuals) because of the proposed Arakkonam bypass. An indigenous peoples plan (IPP) \nwas prepared in accordance with the Constitution of India; India\u2019s Right to Fair Compensation \nand Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act (2013); and ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The IPP covers the following: (i) development of a residential colony \nadjacent  to  the  current  location  (non-traditional  land)  of  the  tribal  households  with  basic \ninfrastructure such as streetlights, 24-hour water supply, community hall, Anganavadi (mother \nand child care center) building, and temple; (ii) provision of income-generating schemes to men \nand women in the community; and (iii) capacity building through training to uplift the welfare of \nthe tribal households. The IPP outlines the entitlements, summary of public consultations and \ninformation disclosure, grievance redress mechanism, and institutional arrangements. The TNHD \nhas the capacity and the commitment to ensure the adequate implementation of the IPP. \n \n40.  The PIU includes an environmental wing and a LARR unit. The wing and LARR unit will \nbe responsible for the overall management of safeguards under the project, supported by FIU \nand field-level LARR officers who will serve as the safeguard focal points at the sites. The \nconstruction supervision consultants will support the PIU in the implementation of the project and \n \n41 The numbers of households and individuals are tentative, and dynamic by nature; the final numbers will be \ndetermined during the award inquiry. The data includes households of indigenous peoples. \n42 The information gathered will be finalized in line with the national procedure for land acquisition. \n ", "13 \nthe safeguards. The TNHD will recruit external consultants to ensure third-party monitoring and \nverification of all safeguard implementation activities and reports. Semiannual environmental and \nsocial monitoring reports will be submitted by the TNHD and disclosed on the ADB website until \nthe issuance of the project completion report. \n \nG.
