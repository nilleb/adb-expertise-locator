THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Jilin Yanji Low-Carbon Climate-Resilient Healthy\nCity Project.\n2. The project is located in Yanji city, which faces challenges of poor urban livability and\ntraffic management, exposure to climate-related flood risk, and risks to water security and safety.\nThe project will provide multiple cross-benefits from an integrated solution provided to improve\nthe urban livability of a medium-sized city, which is timely and essential to lessen the migration to\nthe coastal mega-urban regions and to provide a demonstration project for replication in the PRC.\nIt will contribute to (i) regional public goods of health and improved air and water quality, and\n(ii) revitalizing the economically challenged northeast area of the PRC.\n3.  The project will support the first bus rapid transit (BRT) corridor in the northeast of the \nPRC  and  transform  Yanji\u2019s  urban  geography.  This  will  reinforce  the  east\u2013west  linear  city \narrangement through connecting key areas following principles of transit-oriented development \n(TOD) with higher density mixed-use and pedestrian-friendly center areas around the BRT \nstations. It will integrate nonmotorized transport (NMT) lanes and facilities along the corridor, and \na series of small roads and river greenways will be provided to ensure safe and pleasant \npedestrian and bicycle access to the BRT stations while promoting low-carbon urban mobility and \nphysical activities that enhance public health. The project-supported greenways are designed as \n\u201csponge city\u201d green infrastructure, enhancing climate resilience and urban livability.1 The project \nwill improve the water supply and wastewater management systems to ensure safe and climate-\nresilient access to water supply and improved water quality. Capacity development will contribute \nto the preparation of action plans to demonstrate Yanji as a low-carbon, climate-resilient, and \nhealthy city, contributing to the implementation of the Healthy China 2030 program,2 and lessons \nand knowledge will be shared with other developing member countries.\nII.  THE PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n4.  Yanji city is part of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in the east of Jilin \nprovince, bordering the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the southeast and the Russian \nFederation to the northeast. Yanji is an ancient city on the Buer Hatong River surrounded by \nhills, and  its  easternmost  border  is  about  15  kilometers  (km)  from  the  sea.  Yanji\u2019s  total \npopulation was about 0.60 million in 2018 (about 0.48 million of whom are urban) with about \n50.2% being ethnic Koreans, who are well-integrated and live in harmony with the Han Chinese.3 \nThe total land area is 1,748 square kilometers.4 In 2017, the city\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) \nwas CNY33.6 billion and GDP per capita was CNY61,431. The contributions to the GDP by main \nsectors in 2017 were agriculture (1.4% of GDP in 2017), manufacturing (36.8%), and services \nindustry (61.8%). Yanji is affected by the regional economic decline of the northeastern PRC, \nand  the  city  relies  mainly  on  tourism  and  associated  services,  processing  of  agricultural \nproducts, and logistics services.\n1  Sponge city is a concept of comprehensive urban water resources management, in which greenways, parks, and \nwetlands maximize ecosystem services, including storm water management, using ecosystem-based adaptation. \n2  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2016. The Healthy China 2030. Beijing. \n3  Population information of 2018 was collected directly from all the districts, townships, and local communities. \n4  Chaoyangchuan township, previously administered by Longjing city, was included under the administration of Yanji \nin 2008, thus contributing to the rural population increase. ", "2 \n5.  Key development challenges. The city suffers from inadequate urban infrastructure and \nprovision of basic services that cause inconvenience and disruptions to daily life, especially for \nwomen.  This  includes  inefficient  public  transport,  traffic  congestion  and  poor  parking \nmanagement, urban and river flooding, and inefficient water supply and wastewater management. \n \n6.  Urban roads suffer from traffic congestion, especially during rush hours, and missing \nnetwork links. Many elements of the road network and intersections pose safety problems for \nvehicles and people. There is a lack of safe bicycle lanes, sidewalks, and pedestrian crossings in \nmany areas. Many cars are parked on sidewalks, creating obstacles for and safety risks to \npedestrians. The increase of private cars leads to worsening traffic, increased air pollution and \nless healthy lifestyles with people walking less. In 2017 there were a total of 152,000 cars in Yanji, \nwhich is about 300 vehicles per 1,000 urban residents, and an increase from 96,000 units in 2012. \nTraffic management and signal control is outdated with suboptimal and unsafe intersections, \nespecially in the congested urban core. The public transport system is inefficient, inconvenient, \nand unsafe; buses jam in bus stop areas and people get on and off on the streets. Further, there \nis an urgent need to upgrade and extend public transport into the periphery. Currently, 43 bus \nroutes traverse six roads with a total route length of 490 km and a daily ridership of about 243,000 \npassengers. The public transport system does not match the needs of a growing population and \nmay cause reduced ridership due to an increase in private vehicle use as people switch modes \nbecause of unreliable public transport service and bus shelters that lack weather protection. \n \n7.  Flooding is a significant problem during the rainy season in June\u2013July, with flooding for \nabout 5 days per year on average in recent years. River flooding, flash floods, and urban flooding \nendanger lives, property, and livelihoods, and pose disturbances to traffic and public life. The \ncombined sewer and drainage pipe system is outdated, with a total network length of 326 km, \ncomprising 110 km of sewers, 40 km of drainage pipes, and 176 km of combined sewer and \ndrainage pipes. Only 11.6% of the pipe network meets the domestically required 1-in-3 year flood \ndesign standard, causing pluvial flooding during heavy summer rains. The Chaoyang River urban \ncatchment area is currently exposed to flood risks of 1-in-20 year flood events. \n \n8.  Yanji city\u2019s water supply system is inefficient. It has two water reservoirs and two water \ntreatment plants with a total combined treatment capacity of 210,000 cubic meters (m3) per day; \n150,000 m3/day of treated water meets national water quality standards and is provided as \ncontinuous round-the-clock service to end users. The system covers about 98% of the urban area \nand population with 348 km of water distribution pipes, 91 booster pumps, and around 215,000 \nwater meters. The key challenge is the high level of nonrevenue water (NRW) which was 46% in \n2017, comprising 9% in commercial losses and 37% in physical water losses mainly because of \naging pipes that were laid in the 1930s and 1970s. It is difficult to detect leaks in deeply buried \npipes because of cold climate conditions and incomplete information on pipe locations because \nof missing and unreliable maps of the old pipe system and poor geographic information system \n(GIS) management. While the city benefitted from a previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nloan, the above challenges remain.5 Wastewater is collected and treated at two wastewater \ntreatment plants with a combined capacity of 150,000 m3/day. Tariffs for domestic water users \nare CNY3.20/m3 for water supply and an additional CNY0.95/m3 for wastewater. \n \n9.  Strategic fit. The project will support urban livability of a medium-sized city, contributing \nto ADB\u2019s strategic support to the PRC\u2019s revitalization and strengthening of the northeast including \n \n5  ADB.

The project supported water \ntreatment plants, transmission pipes, wastewater treatment plant, and central heating system improvement. \n \n ", "  3 \nfour cities in East Heilongjiang, north of Yanji.6 Through its strategic and integrated approach, the \nproject will support (i) the thirteenth five-year plans of Jilin province and Yanji city, 2016\u20132020;    \n(ii) the PRC\u2019s National New-Type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020, aligning with Yanji\u2019s investment \nprogram as one of the PRC\u2019s pilot cities;7 and (iii) Yanji\u2019s urban and economic development \nmaster plan (2009\u20132030) and transport master plan.8 The proposed project is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for the PRC, 2018\u20132020 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s (i) country \npartnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, supporting socially inclusive, environmentally \nsustainable, and economically competitive development; and (ii) ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational \npriority on livable cities, and support to upper middle-income countries by (a) providing integrated \nsolutions for a livable city demonstrating low-carbon climate-resilient healthy city development \ngenerating  synergies  and  cobenefits,  contributing  to  regional  public  goods,  (b)  enhancing \nresilience to climate change shocks and stresses including reducing flood risk and increasing \nwater safety and security, (c) strengthening institutional knowledge and capacity building, and (d) \nsharing best practices and innovation experiences for south\u2013south cooperation.9 \n \n10.  Lessons learned. The project continues the more than 23 years of strategic partnership \nbetween Jilin province and ADB in areas of masterplanning, environmental improvement and \nurban  infrastructure,  among  others.  The  project  incorporates  lessons  from  independent \nevaluation reports and similar ADB projects in Jilin province.10 It will support the sustainability of \na previous ADB-financed project in Yanji (footnote 5) which supported (i) water supply system \nconstruction including a water treatment plant, raw water transmission pipes, water mains, and \ndistribution pipes; and (ii) central heating improvements, which led to significant improvement in \nair quality and public health because of the closure of about 330 inefficient coal-fired boilers, which \nresulted in an increase in class II air quality standards from 285 days in 2006 to 334 days in 2012. \nThe BRT component is expected to further improve air quality. Lessons were incorporated from \nsustainable urban transport projects, i.e., in Gansu Lanzhou, Hubei Yichang, and Shandong \nJinan, including the benefits of (i) integration of BRT with NMT improvements on enhanced BRT \nuse, and (ii) overall improved urban transport sustainability and livability from reduced air and \nnoise pollution and enhanced traffic flow and safety.11 Lessons from flood risk management \nprojects, like in Jiangxi Pingxiang, include that green sponge city infrastructure yields multiple \nbenefits such as effective flood defense and water infiltration and cleansing, increased biodiversity \nand enhanced recreation functions, and promotion of more walking and cycling.12 Lessons are \napplied from technical assistance projects such as adequate water and wastewater tariffs for \nfinancial sustainability, effective urban storm water management, and urban climate change \nadaptation.13 \n \n6  ADB.

The project is aligned with the following impact: inclusive, environmentally sustainable, \nand competitive development of Yanji city achieved (footnote 8). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: livability, low-carbon development, climate resilience, and health in Yanji city \nimproved.14 \n \n12.  The project will have four outputs that are integrated and expected to generate cobenefits \nand higher efficiencies. The project focus is on the first BRT line in the northeast and the city; \nNMT improvements and its integration with sponge city infrastructure and drainage; and water \nsupply system safety and efficiency improvements. The project will support comprehensive, low-\ncarbon, climate-resilient development parallel to and north of the Buer Hatong River, organized \nalong a BRT corridor connecting the industrial park developments and job centers in the east and \nwest of the urban area, and linking many residential districts with the city center, business and \nretail  center,  station  for  high-speed  rail,  government  center,  Yanbian  University,  schools, \nhospitals, and parks. The overall concept will follow the principles of TOD, focusing on higher \ndensity mixed-use and pedestrian-friendly center areas around the BRT stations promoting low-\ncarbon urban mobility. New green spaces will (i) link station areas with project-supported riverfront \ngreenways, creating a network of sponge city infrastructure enhancing climate resilience and \nurban  livability;  and  (ii)  enable  more  healthier  lifestyles  for  residents  and  tourists,  hence \ncontributing to healthy and age-friendly city development, applying universal design principles. \nKnowledge from the demonstration features of integrating public transport, green infrastructure \nfor flood risk management and healthy and age-friendly design will be shared across the region. \n \n13.  Output 1: Low-carbon bus rapid transit line integrated with nonmotorized transport \ninfrastructure constructed. This output includes (i) planning and constructing a 20-km BRT \ncorridor on Gongyuan Road and Renmin Road in an east\u2013west direction, with about 25 stations, \nintegrated with improved small road links with safe pedestrian and bicycle links to stations and \nincluding associated utility pipes, trees, and greening; (ii) procuring a fleet of 100 clean-energy \nbuses and constructing a bus terminal and maintenance center; (iii) installing equipment for smart \nticketing and a BRT control center with smart information and communication technology (ICT) \nmonitoring and system-wide, real-time data of bus locations and operation; (iv) removing sidewalk \nparking, and adding landscaping of public spaces in five locations near BRT stations with \ninstallation of exercise equipment; and (v) installing mechanical parking structures for park-and-\nride near selected BRT stations and implementing the parking management plan developed under \noutput 4.  \n \n14.  Output  2:  Climate-resilient  flood  risk  management  and  sponge  city  green \ninfrastructure constructed. This output includes (i) constructing sponge city green infrastructure \nin residential areas within the catchment of creeks, integrated with improved and separated \ndrainage pipes (at least 43 km) and wastewater pipes (at least 40 km),15 using results from \ndetailed hydraulic modeling and thereby significantly reducing climate-related pluvial and fluvial \nflood risks (according to the project\u2019s hydraulic model up to 1-in-50 year flood events), and \nimproving the water quality through construction of sedimentation tanks and reed-bed sand filters \nat the end of drainage pipes; and (ii) ecological river rehabilitation of the Chaoyang River, \nimproving the flood protection standard from 1-in-20 year floods to 1-in-50 year flood events. \nIncluded is bio-engineering as in-stream solutions in the river bed and green embankments, and \nbuilding pedestrian and bicycle paths with tree planting along this greenway. \n \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 Civil works contracts under output 1 will integrate construction and installation of drainage and wastewater pipes. \n ", "  5 \n15.  Output 3: Water supply system improved. This output will improve the water supply \nsystem, including (i) installing about 330 flow meters for hydraulic zones and district metering \narea management, and installing about 4,000 smart water meters in older residential areas; and \n(ii) upgrading and replacing about 32 km of water supply pipes, including building up hydraulic \nzones. This follows two already completed phases of an improvement program of the water supply \nsystem wholly carried out by the city-owned water group company. This is expected to reduce \nNRW from the current 46% to 37% during project implementation, conserving about 4.8 million \nm3 of water resources each year as a result of the project, as part of the water group company\u2019s \noverall plan to reduce NRW to 20% by 2030. Further NRW reductions will be enabled through a \ncapacity  development  and  utility  twinning  program  under  output  4,  and  proposed  further \ninvestments may be included in the contract packages of this output as appropriate.  \n \n16.  Output  4:  Capacity  in  low-carbon,  climate-resilient,  healthy  city  planning,  and \ninfrastructure management developed. This output will support project management and \nquality assurance; external safeguards monitoring; and capacity development for inclusive and \ngender-sensitive low-carbon, climate-resilient, and healthy city planning and implementation \nincluding smart-city ICT application to enhance the sustainability of the project. Activities will \ninclude support to and capacity development in (i) project implementation, management, and \nmonitoring; (ii) low-carbon city and TOD planning; traffic impact assessment and evaluation; \nparking management planning; BRT operation capacity development and network planning; and \npedestrian, bicycle system, and universal design masterplan preparation; (iii) urban climate \nchange adaptation and sponge city action planning, open space planning, and hydraulic modeling \nand  simulation;  (iv)  healthy  and  age-friendly  city  master  planning  and  health  monitoring, \ncontributing to Healthy China 2030 (footnote 2); (v) water safety planning; NRW reduction and \nleakage identification and management; and development of an integrated water management \nsystem including smart systems using cloud data, supervisory control and data acquisition \n(SCADA), GIS, and asset management systems as part of smart-city applications; and (vi) GIS \nplatform development and smart-city implementation action planning. Lessons and knowledge \nwill be shared with other developing member countries in the form of guidelines for replication \n \nand knowledge-sharing events in Yanji and reports to international and domestic conferences.\n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n17.  ADB provides an innovative, spatially integrated solution to low-carbon, climate-resilient, \nhealthy  city  planning,  and  infrastructure  investment  prioritization  and  finance  to  optimize \ncobenefits across sectors aiming at urban livability. Specifically, ADB value addition includes          \n(i) TOD-based integrated urban planning was introduced to enable higher density mixed-use, \npedestrian-friendly areas, which reduces traffic demand and promotes the use of public transport \nthrough proximity and links of housing with commercial businesses, job centers, and public \nservices, including health facilities and schools, which reduces air pollution and greenhouse gas \nemissions; (ii) best practices in BRT corridor and station planning and design were provided \nbased on detailed surveys, which will be further enhanced by traffic impact assessment, traffic \nand  parking management  plans,  and  investment  in  intelligent  transport  system  equipment;            \n(iii) a detailed digital hydraulic model was developed for the project and piloted as an expert tool \nthat simulates future storm scenarios and adaptation options integrating underground drainage \npipe network improvements with at-grade sponge city green infrastructure. Improvements to \ndrainage  and  flow  capacity,  combined  with  increased  stormwater  retention  and  infiltration \ncapacity,  were  quantified,  visualized,  and  evaluated  to  optimize  flood  risk  reduction  and \ninvestments and green space benefits; and (iv) water utility corporate governance and NRW \nreduction assessment and technology was introduced, and effective NRW will be implemented. \n \n ", "6 \n18.  A health impact assessment (HIA) following the ADB Health Sector Group\u2019s guidance was \nprepared to assess and enhance expected health benefits of the project, e.g., water and air quality \nimprovements; noise reductions; and healthier lifestyles enabled through more use of public \ntransport, walking, cycling, and generally more physical activity from sponge city open spaces \nand  river  greenways.  Health  benefits  were  further  facilitated  by  applying  universal  design \nprinciples to public spaces and facilities, benefitting especially elderly and physically impaired \npeople, women, and children.16 A pilot healthy and age-friendly city action and monitoring plan \nwill be prepared during project implementation to support the Healthy China 2030 program \n(footnote 2). Further, smart-city infrastructure using high-level ICT and a big data platform using \nthe Internet of Things and artificial intelligence to integrate and manage data for the investment \ncomponents and aiming at higher levels of cross-sector integration in Yanji was introduced, \nincluding intelligent transport system equipment, smart water metering, and using data to alert of \nunusual consumption patterns that may be related to changing health, especially of the elderly. \n \nD.

ADB will finance 46.08% of mitigation costs ($37.89 \nmillion equivalent) and 46.06% of adaptation costs ($67.75 million equivalent). The total annual \ncarbon dioxide emission reduction is about 60,707.82 tons, mainly from modal shift from private \nvehicles to public transport, replacing diesel buses with clean-energy buses, and tree planting.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The  Yanji  city  government  (YCG)  is  the  executing  agency  for  the  project.  The \nimplementing agencies will be the administrative bureaus in charge of the respective components, \nincluding  Yanji  city\u2019s  transport  bureau,  housing  and  construction  bureau,  traffic  police, \nChaoyangchuan township government, and Yanji Water Group Company Limited. A project \nleading group has been formally established under the leadership of the Yanji city mayor involving \nother concerned administrative bureaus and agencies such as the health bureau, water affairs \nbureau, natural resources bureau, and environmental protection bureau, facilitating coordination \nand cooperation to ensure that synergies and cobenefits for all components will be achieved. A \nproject management office has been formally established under the Yanji City Development and \nReform  Commission.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM including audit, reporting, and monitoring and evaluation. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2020\u2013March 2027 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2026 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 March 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Yanji City Project Leading Group \nMayor (chair), executive vice-mayor (deputy chair) \nDirector of Yanji City Development and Reform Commission; directors of \nimplementing agencies and other administrative bureaus of Yanji city government \n(ii)  Executing agency  Yanji city government \n(iii)  Key implementing  Yanji city transport bureau, Yanji city housing and construction bureau, Yanji city \nagencies  traffic police, Chaoyangchuan township government, and Yanji Water Group \nCompany Limited \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Yanji City Development and Reform Commission, 8 staff \nProcurement  OCB (internationally advertised)  2 contracts  $26.58 million \n ", "8 \nAspects  Arrangements \nopen competitive bidding (nationally  13 contracts  $139.51 million \nadvertised) \nConsulting services  quality- and cost-based selection  362 person-months  $3.35 million \nconsultants qualifications selection  42 person-months  $0.30 million \nindividual consultant selection  82 person-months  $0.95 million \nRetroactive financing and  Advance contracting includes one goods package to procure smart meters for the \nadvance contracting  water supply system and 10 consulting services packages.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The project is technically feasible and complies with PRC and international engineering \nstandards, local regulations and conditions, and strategic and sector priorities. Design options \nwere compared and the best possible technologies with the lowest cost, environmental, and social \nimpacts were selected. Baseline data was collected and proposed climate change adaptation \nmeasures specialists were incorporated, including (i) structural measures like drainage pipe \nsystem layout improvements, sponge city green infrastructure, and increasing the flow capacity \nof project rivers and creeks; and (ii) nonstructural measures. The proposed capacity development \nis based on a needs assessment for the successful implementation and sustainable operation of \nthe project and to support Yanji to become a model low-carbon, climate-resilient, healthy city. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  An economic analysis for the project was prepared following ADB guidelines.18 Economic \nviability of the project was confirmed under various sensitivity scenarios. Benefits considered \ninclude (i) improved public transport, reduced carbon emissions from modal switch from cars to \npublic transport and from clean-energy bus use, increased savings in vehicle operating costs and \ntravel time, reduced road traffic accidents, and health benefits; (ii) improved flood protection and \navoided damage; improved surface water quality; increased carbon sequestration; improved and \nexpanded  urban  green  spaces,  tree  planting,  and  landscaping;  and  reduced  wastewater \ntreatment costs; and (iii) improved water supply and water use efficiency, and reduced water \nleakage. The economic internal rate of return for the overall project was calculated at 27.1%, \nwhich is well above the 9.0% economic opportunity cost of capital. It drops to 25.4% if capital and \noperating costs increase by 10.0%, to 25.2% if benefits decrease by 10.0%, to 23.6% if the two \nassumptions are combined, to 24.4% with a 1-year delay in the benefits, and to 21.4% if the 1-\nyear delay in benefits is combined with a 10% cost increase and 10% benefit decrease. \n \n26.  The financial analysis is conducted to assess the financial viability and sustainability of the \nproposed project in accordance with ADB guidelines.19 The financial evaluation of the BRT as the \nrevenue-generating component results in a financial internal rate of return of 7.31%, exceeding \n \n18 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila; and ADB. 1999. Handbook for the Economic \nAnalysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila. \n19 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence: A \nMethodology Note. Manila. \n ", "  9 \nthe average weighted cost of capital of 5.25%, and the sensitivity analysis indicated that it remains \nfinancially viable under all considered scenarios. The financial statements analyses demonstrate \nthat the project implementation unit of the BRT has adequate financial capacity to cover the \nincremental recurrent costs for operation and maintenance. The financial sustainability analysis \nindicated that the YCG (the end borrower) has sufficient financial resources to cover the recurrent \ncost and debt repayment. Therefore, the project is considered financially sustainable. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n27.  Project outcomes and outputs will be maintained over the project\u2019s economic life, and \nmitigation of potential risks, i.e., suboptimal BRT operation and financial management, will be \nthrough comprehensive capacity building and institutional strengthening provided by output 4. \nThe YCG\u2019s suitable local government arrangement, with the development and reform commission \nleading the project management office, and its strength coordinating projects across departments \nwill be further strengthened. The healthy and green infrastructure will likely contribute to medium- \nand long-term sustainability of natural resources, reduced pollution, and enhanced biodiversity. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n28.  Financial management. The financial management premitigation risk is rated moderate \nbased on the assessed internal control environment, experience in implementing development \nprojects,  supervisory  procedures,  and  technical  capability.  The  financial  management \nassessment conducted for the YCG, transport bureau, housing and construction bureau, traffic \npolice department, Chaoyangchuan township government, and Yanji Water Group Company was \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management Technical Guidance Note,20 and covered funds \nflow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, internal and external \nauditing arrangements, and financial information systems. Risk mitigation measures include \ntraining on financial management and disbursement for executing and implementing agency staff. \n \n29.  Procurement. The overall assessment of the project procurement risk is moderate. The \nexecuting and implementing agencies bring significant experience of national procurement. \nHowever, none of the agencies have previously been involved in procurement of projects funded \nby foreign entities such as by ADB. Proposed mitigation measures include training of staff of the \nimplementing agencies and other stakeholders during project implementation. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the YCG, and the implementing agencies. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  In 2018, the project population in the six subdistricts and three towns of Yanji, where \ninvestments are located, was about 0.59 million, of which 0.48 million or 81.4% were urban \ninhabitants, 0.11 million or 18.6% were rural inhabitants, 0.30 million or 50.9% were women, and \n0.31 million or 52.5% were ethnic minorities. According to the poverty and social analysis, the \nmain cause of poverty is unemployment and underemployment because of insufficient new job \nopportunities created by unbalanced and inadequate industrial and agricultural development in \nYanji. A total of 13,137 poor and low-income people living in the project areas will benefit from \nthe project. \n \n20 ADB. 2015. Financial Management Technical Guidance Note: Financial Management Assessment. Manila. \n ", "10 \n32.  The project will benefit about 0.59 million people through improved (i) urban mobility with \nBRT  and  NMT  systems;  (ii)  road  safety  through  traffic  management;  (iii)  public  health, \nenvironment, pollution (water, air, and noise), flood risk, sponge city greening, and water supply \nand wastewater management; and (iv) employment, with about 1,683 new jobs during project \nimplementation, comprising about 508 management and technically skilled positions and about \n1,175 unskilled positions. The project directly responds to issues raised by the poverty and social \nassessment  through  designs  that  are  sensitive  to  issues  of  gender  and  disabled  people, \nespecially in the BRT and NMT systems. The project will further enhance social inclusiveness, \nwith improved public facilities and environment benefitting all Yanji residents and tourists. A public \nawareness and education program is included in the social and gender action plan (SGAP),21 \nparticularly to address risks and needs of vulnerable groups such as poor people and women. \n \n33.  Gender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming and will \nhave significant benefits for women, who are primarily burdened with household and family \nresponsibilities. Women are more concerned with water supply and sanitation quality, and also \nuse public transport more often than men as a result of their responsibilities, combining household \nwork with travel to a workplace. Women consider improvements in traffic safety, better public \ntransport, and NMT as important benefits to enhance accessibility, safety, and comfort of public \ntransport. The majority of female respondents support the project as it will enhance their quality \nof life through improved urban environment and generation of job opportunities for themselves \nand family members. The SGAP will help ensure women\u2019s participation in public hearings; \nawareness raising; and economic, social, and decision-making activities related to the project, \nincluding (i) job opportunities during construction of 20% (of which 25% are skilled and managerial \npositions) and operation of 30% (of which 30% are skilled and managerial positions); (ii) gender-\nresponsive physical design; (iii) awareness raising and project-related public consultations on \nenvironmental protection, road safety, and flood risk management (50%); (iv) capacity building of \ngovernment staff (40%); and (v) inclusive and gender-sensitive action plans on a low-carbon, \nclimate-resilient healthy city. SGAP implementation will be ensured by an assurance in the project \nagreement, through a social and gender development specialist to be engaged under output 4, \nand SGAP monitoring will be carried out twice a year by an external agency. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n34.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009),  the  project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are as follows.22 \n \n35.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  including \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) was prepared in accordance with the SPS on the basis \nof three domestic environmental impact assessment reports, a feasibility study report, site survey \nfindings, and technical due diligence and studies by ADB. The project is expected to have positive \nimpacts on the environment and reduce emissions and flood risk, while creating a more livable \ncity. Anticipated impacts during construction include short episodes of increased noise and dust \npollution during earthworks, site preparation, access road upgrade, and concrete mixing. Traffic \nmanagement during construction may lead to short-term disturbance and increased noise and air \npollution.  Other  potential  impacts  during  construction  include  soil  erosion,  surface  water \ncontamination, and potential occupational health and safety risks to workers. Construction-related \nimpacts are expected to be temporary and will be minimized by stringent site management and \nprocedural provisions in the EMP. Environmental protection clauses will be included in works \n \n21 Social and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "  11 \ncontracts  to  ensure  that  works  contractors  are  aware  of  and  committed  to  implementing \nrequirements as specified in the EMP. Potential impacts from operation are mainly air pollution, \nnoise, wastewater, and waste which are considered in the IEE, and mitigation measures and \nmonitoring  are  included  in  the  EMP.  The  government  will  recruit  consultants  to  assist \nimplementation and compliance and conduct external monitoring. Meaningful consultations were \nconducted  during  project  preparation  with  all  relevant  stakeholders  and  the  findings  were \nincorporated in the project. Consultation will continue throughout implementation. Environmental \ncomplaints or disputes will be handled through a grievance redress mechanism established for \nthe project. The IEE and EMP were disclosed on the ADB website in May 2019. \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will permanently acquire 50.68 mu \nof land, comprising 28.64 mu of village collective cultivated land, 3.23 mu of an unused village-\nowned fish pond, and 18.81 mu of unused village collective land.23 Structure demolition impacts \nwill be limited to 200 square meters of an abandoned nonresidential structure owned by the village \ncollective of Yilan town. The project will affect 80 households with 268 people and not involve \ndemolition of houses, shops, enterprises, or institutions. Agriculture is not the source of livelihood \nof affected people losing collective cultivated lands, and the impacts on household incomes is \nless than 5% for all 80 affected households. A draft resettlement plan was prepared following the \nlaws and regulations of the PRC, Jilin province, Yanji city, and the SPS. The local government \nwill be responsible for compensation and provision of support and assistance prior to land \nacquisition activities. Due diligence of land acquisition and compensation confirmed that there are \nno past or present concerns related to impacts on involuntary resettlement for an area of the BRT \ncorridor where land acquisition was completed by the YCG in 2018. During implementation, \ntraining on ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy and procedures will be provided to the project \nmanagement office and resettlement management staff. An external agency will be engaged for \nsemiannual external monitoring and evaluation. \n \n37.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  In  the  six  subdistricts  and  three  towns  where \ninvestments are located, there are 308,902 ethnic minority people, accounting for 52.4% of total \nproject area population, among which 50.9% are Korean minorities. The poverty and social \nanalysis identified that ethnic Koreans are socially and economically not vulnerable. The project \nwill be implemented mostly in urban areas, where all minority groups are well integrated with the \nHan population. All ethnic minorities and groups will benefit equally from the project and no \nadverse impacts are envisaged. \n \n38.  Health impact assessment. A rapid HIA of the project was carried out according to ADB\u2019s \nframework (footnote 16). Cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and diabetes are currently \nprevalent health burdens in Yanji, as well as injuries and casualties from traffic accidents. During \nconsultations, residents\u2019 concerns were lack of open and green spaces, poor pavements, and \nsidewalks with parked cars causing lack of opportunities for physical activity. The HIA confirmed \nthat the project addresses key health concerns of residents and its contribution to improved public \nhealth. The BRT, NMT, and sponge city facilities will enable more physical exercise and walking, \nincluding for vulnerable groups, as they will provide a safer and more attractive environment for \npedestrians and cyclists. The project will reduce traffic accidents and exposure to air and water \npollution. Sponge city green infrastructure will provide attractive open space for exercise and \nimproved livability, improved microclimate, and reduced risk of flooding. Capacity building to \nprepare a healthy city masterplan under output 4 will contribute to making Yanji a pilot healthy \nand age-friendly city with broad positive impacts. \n \n23 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n ", "12 \nG.
