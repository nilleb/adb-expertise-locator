Efficient use of waterways in a country to \ntransport  cargo  can  reduce  congestion  on  roads  and  railways,  lower  the  average  amount  of \nenergy needed for freight transport overall, and cut back emissions of greenhouse gases. IWT \ncan also be developed in ways that bring other benefits, such as the generation of hydroelectric \npower. \n \n3. \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has the world\u2019s largest IWT network, both in terms \nof length and freight volume.2 About 24,000 kilometers (km) of the country\u2019s waterways, or roughly \n20%  of  the  overall  IWT  network,  are  in  the  commercially  significant  class  I\u2013V  category,  which \nmeans they can accommodate sizeable vessels for navigation. Another 50% of the waterways \nare unclassified and 30% are in classes VI\u2013VII. However until 2000, the government put more \nemphasis on improving highways and railways than on developing IWT. Public investment fell \nbelow  what  was  needed  to  maintain  and  renew  IWT  infrastructure.  Many  inland  ports  on  the \nnetwork are old and lack specialized berths and modern handling equipment. The contribution of \nIWT to the overall transport system has also been constrained by weak institutional coordination \nbetween the local, regional, and national agencies involved.3 \n \nThe government is now paying more attention to IWT. In 2007, it issued the National Plan \n4. \nfor Inland Waterways and Ports (NPIWP), which was based on an assessment of IWT conditions \nand  performance  and  outlined  a  program  of  investments  to  establish  a  network  of  upgraded, \ninterlinked IWT routes. The NPIWP aims to increase the class I\u2013III waterway network\u2014navigable \nby vessels of 500 deadweight tons (dwt)4 and above\u2014to 19,000 km by 2020 from less than 9,000 \nkm in 2006. Priority projects will aim to upgrade main national waterways to each of the main IWT \nsystems in the PRC from low classifications and make complementary improvements in their ports. \nThis will create a core waterway network that can handle larger vessels and help realize the full \neconomic potential of the country\u2019s extensive IWT network.  \n \n5. \nPotential in Hunan province. Hunan is a landlocked province with a population of 68.4 \nmillion.  One  of  six  provinces  supported  by  the  government\u2019s  Central  Region  Development \nStrategy,  it  is  rich  in  navigable  waterway  resources  and  has  the  third  longest  provincial  IWT \nnetwork in the PRC, with over 11,495 km of waterways, 107 ports, and 1,880 berths. However, \nonly  6%  of  its  waterways  and  berths  can  accommodate  vessels  of  up  to  1,000  tons  carrying \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The total length of navigable waterways stood at 123,683 kilometers (km) in 2009, of which 61,546 km were rated \nclasses  I\u2013VII  and  62,137  km  were  navigable  but  unclassified.  Waterways  are  divided  into  classes  based  on  the \nmaximum size of the vessels they can accommodate, measured by a vessel\u2019s carrying capacity in deadweight tons \n(dwt): class I (3,000 dwt), class II (2,000 dwt), class III (1,000 dwt), class IV (500 dwt), class V (300 dwt), class VI \n(100 dwt), and class VII (50 dwt). \n\n3  Sector Assessment: Transport, and Information and Communication Technology (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n4  Deadweight tonnage (or dwt) is a measure of how much weight a vessel is carrying or can safely carry. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\ncapacity. In 2009, the network carried only 10% of the overall freight transported in the province \nin terms of ton-kilometers (ton-km). This reflected the longstanding low level of investment in IWT, \nwhen compared with investment in other modes. For example, investment in Hunan IWT in 2009 \nwas CNY551 million, less than 1% of total road investment in the same year. \n \nThe Xiang River5 is one of the largest tributaries of the Yangtze River6 and the largest river \n6. \nin Hunan. It originates in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and its 969 km length includes \n773  km  in  Hunan  (see  map).  The  river  flows  from  south  to  north,  joins  with  Yangtze  River,7 \nconnecting  six  of  Hunan\u2019s  cities8 and  major  concentrations  of  population  with  the  PRC\u2019s  east \ncoast seaports. Hunan\u2019s population and industry are concentrated along the Xiang River, which \noffers great opportunities for transporting minerals and agricultural products from the PRC\u2019s inland \nto its major eastern seaboard markets through the use of IWT shipping services. \n \n7. \nUnder vessel standardization programs of the Ministry of Transport (MOT), the average \nvessel capacity in Hunan has increased from 213 dwt in 2005 to 318 dwt in 2010. The largest \nvessel now in operation is 5,600 dwt. Traffic on the Xiang River has grown 21% per annum since \n2000  but  most  of  the  increase  in  vessel  size  and  traffic  has  occurred  downstream  near  the \nYangtze  River.9 The  limited  depth  of  the  water  and  long  rocky  shoals  along  the  Xiang  River\u2019s \nmiddle  and  upper  reaches  have  prevented  safe  year-round  access  by  large  vessels.10 Further \ntraffic growth is also constrained by obsolete and insufficient infrastructure and loading facilities \nin the river\u2019s ports. The government is prioritizing the removal of these bottlenecks, which increase \nthe freight costs and voyage times on these parts of the river.  \n \n8. \nNeed for inland waterway infrastructure. The Hunan provincial government (HPG) has \nrecognized the potential role of IWT and is pursuing a more balanced transport strategy. In 2007, \nit formulated the Xiang River Network Master Plan, 2008\u20132020, which lays out a comprehensive \nnavigation,  water  resources,  and  hydroelectric  power  development  approach  to  2020  and \nemphasizes IWT infrastructure development more than previous schemes did.11 The plan aims \nto gradually make the Xiang River navigable year-round for barges of up to 1,000 dwt in its middle \nand upper reaches and for barges of up to 2,000 dwt on its lower reaches so as to lower average \ntransport costs by one-third to one-half. Once the plan is carried out, the Xiang River will become \none of the most important freight corridors in Hunan. \n \n9. \nTo increase traffic on the waterway and reduce the transport costs, port capacity will also \nneed to be expanded, particularly in the river\u2019s middle and upper reaches. The existing inland \nports are aging and poorly equipped. Larger and more specialized barges will also be needed to \nimprove the economics of the industry and reduce IWT costs. The average size of vessels using \nthe  Zhuzhou  complex  (see  map),  which  was  expanded  under  a  World  Bank  IWT  project,  was \n\n                                                 \n5  The Xiang River is also called Xiangjiang in Chinese. \n6  Yangtze River is also called Changjiang in Chinese. \n7  The Yangtze River (6,300 km), the largest waterway in the PRC, flows from Qinghai in the west to Shanghai in the \n\n8  Together with its tributaries (the Xiaoshui, Leishui, and Lushui), the Xiang River  waterway is navigable for a total \nlength  of  2,826  km.  The  six  cities  along  the  river  (Changsha,  Hengyang,  Yueyang,  Xiangtan,  Yongzhou,  and \nZhuzhou) are the source of 65% of the province\u2019s gross domestic product. \n\n9  Freight on the Xiang River waterway increased from 20 million tons in 2002 to 118 million tons in 2009.  \n10The river can be navigated by vessels of up to 1,000 dwt on the lower reaches, 300\u2013500 dwt on the middle reaches, \n\nand 50\u2013100 dwt on the upper reaches.  \n\n11 The  plan  included  nine  ship  locks  and  powerhouse  complexes,  of  which  five  are  already  in  operation.  The  other \ncomplexes are either under construction (Changsha and Xiangqi) or at the planning stage, including Tugutang (output \n1 of the proposed project) and Taizhou (in Guangxi). \n\neast.  \n\n \n\n\fincreased steadily from 175 dwt in 1998 to 230 dwt in 2006.12 With further support and incentive \nschemes  under  the  project,  the  upgrading  of  the  fleet  size  and  modernization  process  can  be \naccelerated. \n \nNeed  for  hinterland  waterway  connections.  Raw  materials  and  agricultural  products \n10. \nproduced in the hinterlands of Hunan are transported to urban areas for processing. This provides \nan important source of income and employment in poor rural areas13 and contributes to poverty \nreduction. Better transport and lower transport costs are needed to expand these activities. This \nincludes the need to improve the IWT connections and related IWT services in the hinterland. The \nupstream stretches of the Xiang River are fed by an IWT network of navigable minor rivers and \nstreams that services rural communities. New loading facilities are needed to give these remote \nareas better access to IWT. \n \n11. \nNeed for an integrated and sustained development policy. Stakeholders have many \ncompeting demands for the use and development of rivers in the PRC for irrigation, flood control, \npower  generation,  water  supply,  and  transport.  Lack  of  coordination  between  competing \ngovernment agencies has impeded the growth of IWT. An integrated, sustained IWT development \npolicy is needed, along with closer cooperation among government agencies. \n \n12. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) helped HPG design an IWT development road map \nin  2009.14 In  line  with  this  road  map,  the  HPG  established  a  permanent,  high-level  waterway \ntransport  development  committee  (WTDC)  in  September  2011.  It  is  chaired  by  the  provincial \ngovernor  and  its  members  represent  19  related  provincial  agencies.15 The  WTDC  will  develop \nand implement a medium-term development and reform agenda that will include creation of an \nIWT  development  fund  in  Hunan,  the  mobilization  of  increased  public  funding,  enhanced \ncooperation with relevant agencies, endorsement of incentive policies to promote inland shipping, \nand  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  multimodal  transport  system.  The  Hunan  Xiangjiang \nInland Waterway Transport Project will finance a team to provide advice to the WTDC. This team \nwill comprise representatives from the Hunan provincial department of transport (HPDOT), the \nHunan  Maritime  Affairs  Bureau,  and  the  Hunan  Xiangjiang  Navigation  Construction  and \nDevelopment Company (XNCD). It will be assisted by project implementation consultants. The \nsupport and advisory team will prepare a policy working paper on IWT development, including a \nreform  agenda  and  action  plans  to  accelerate  IWT  development  in  Hunan.  The  plan  will  be \ndiscussed and endorsed by the WTDC. \n \n13. \nTo realize the NPIWP, arrangements for financing and managing waterways in Hunan will \nneed to be consolidated and enhanced. The project will support the establishment of a new IWT \nenterprise,  the  Hunan  Waterway  Transportation  Construction  and  Investment  Company.  The \ncompany will be established by 31 December 2013 to construct, develop, operate, and maintain \ninland waterway channels and associated assets in Hunan. \n \n14. \nThe development of the inland waterway sector in Hunan has been hampered by a lack \nof awareness among decision makers and shippers of IWT\u2019s potential and their continued use of \noutmoded vessels, methods, and skills. Through policy dialogue during project preparation, ADB \nand HPG agreed that the project would support steps to address several constraints: \n                                                 \n12 The World Bank. 2008.

Manila. \n\n15 The  composition  of  the  WTDC  is  detailed  in  the  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Transport,  and  Information  and \n\nCommunication Technology (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAdvocacy and promotion. The project will pilot IWT promotion schemes to raise \nawareness  and  influence  land  development  policy  and  shippers\u2019  modal  choice \ndecisions. \nInnovation  and  modernization  program.  The  project  will  promote  fleet \nmodernization programs to encourage safer, cleaner, better quality inland shipping. \nThis will be done by replacing older vessels with better ones, equipping inspection \nand patrol vessels, and introducing a green reward incentive system for vessel-\nrelated waste collection. \nSkills  improvement.  The  project  will  initiate  modern  IWT  management  and \nsupport systems, improve capacity building of HPDOT and XNCD, and increase \nthe  level  of  professionalism  in  the  IWT  sector  by  enhancing  monitoring  and \ninspection skills and initiating vocational and other training programs. \n\n \n15. \nRationale  for  ADB  involvement.  The  project  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  past  involvement  in \ninfrastructure  development  in  Hunan.  One  road  project  is  ongoing  and  the  completed  Hunan \nExpressway,  Hunan  Lingjintan  Hydropower,  and  Hunan  Roads  Development  II  projects  were \nrated  satisfactory. 16  The  project  will  make  a  significant  contribution  toward  realizing  the \nconsiderable potential for using IWT in the PRC and thereby to making the country\u2019s transport \nsystem  more  sustainable.  Since  this  is  ADB\u2019s  first  IWT  project  in  the  country,  it  will  also \ndemonstrate  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  focusing  future  transport  sector  support  on  the  more \nsustainable forms of transport, in line with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative.17 The project \nwill  serve  as  a  demonstration  of  the  potential  of  IWT  for  wider  use  in  the  PRC  and  in  other \ndeveloping member countries with IWT potential. \n \nThe project has been given high priority under  the NPIWP. It is fully in line with ADB\u2019s \n16. \ncountry partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 and country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for \nthe PRC since it will (i) contribute to the greening of ADB\u2019s transport portfolio, (ii) address the \nmanagement of resource scarcity and environmental conservation by reducing air pollution and \nconserving water resources, and (iii) increase accessibility of rural poor to IWT infrastructure.18 \nADB\u2019s involvement will strengthen IWT policy, institutions, capacity, and efficiency in Hunan. The \nproject will provide further momentum to IWT policy reform in Hunan. \n \nLessons. The project design benefits from several lessons from seven inland waterway \n17. \nprojects in the PRC financed by the World Bank,19 including two projects involving the XNCD.20 \nFirst, a barrage can improve navigation by raising the water level but also provides opportunities \nfor  hydroelectric  power  generation.  This  dual  benefit  feature  can  enhance  the  economic  and \nfinancial  return  of  barrage  construction.  Second,  achieving  an  integrated  inland  water  policy \nrequires sustained efforts at the senior level across several jurisdictions. This will be facilitated \nunder  the  project  through  the  WTDC,  which  will  bring  together  the  main  agencies  involved  in \ninland shipping to maximize the benefits of water resources utilization and conservation. Third, \nfull cost recovery from IWT alone is difficult to achieve because revenues rarely cover all costs. \nHowever, these costs are small compared with those of other modes, both in absolute terms and \n\n                                                 \n16 Details of these projects are in Table 2 of Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n17 ADB. 2010.

XNCD has implemented the Hunan components of two waterway projects financed \nby the World Bank in a satisfactory manner. \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nin proportion to traffic handled. Given IWT\u2019s greater energy efficiency and smaller environmental \nfootprint, the project will promote the adoption of increased public funding for IWT as a WTDC \npriority. Fourth, a realistic procurement and civil works construction plan is essential for navigation \nimprovements.  To  ensure  readiness,  project  preparation  gave  special  attention  to  technical \ndesign  and  implementation  planning.  Preliminary  engineering  design  for  the  project  has  been \nsubstantially  completed.  Fifth,  creating  a  technical  advisory  panel  can  help  to  ensure  high \ntechnical, operational, and safety standards. Such a panel, to be financed by the ADB loan, will \nbe established under the project to assist in ensuring that the navigation complex will be built in \naccordance with high technical, operational, and safety standards. \n \nB. \n \nThe impact will be an efficient, safe, affordable, and sustainable inland waterway transport \n18. \nsystem  developed  in  Hunan  province.  The  outcome  will  be  a  low  carbon  waterway  transport \nsystem improved on the Xiang River in Hunan province.  \n \nC. \n \n19. \nThe project aims to achieve integrated development of water resources in a poor area of \nHunan province through three outputs. Details of the project description are in Appendix 1 of the \nproject administration manual.21 \n \n20. \nOutput 1: Tugutang navigation-cum-hydropower generation complex constructed. \nThe  complex  will  be  located  about  39  km  upstream  of  Hengyang  City.  It  includes  a  ship  lock \ncapable of accommodating class III vessels. It will also have a run-of-the-river barrage with a low \nhead (10 m) to regulate river levels and flows and a power plant with a capacity of 90 megawatts \nthat will capture the river\u2019s hydropower to generate 363 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of hydroelectric \npower per year. Other works will include 3.1 km of 110-kilovolt transmission lines connecting the \npower plant to Yunji substation; 4.4 km of access roads to the complex on both banks; operational \naccess over the river at the crest of the barrage; reservoir bank protection; dredging and channel \nimprovements; and installation of navigational aids and other auxiliary facilities, including a fish \npass 774 meters (m) long. Upon completion, the complex will expand the waterway\u2019s navigable \ncapacity  by  deepening  an  89  km  stretch  of  the  river  between  Jinweizhou  and  Hengyang  to  a \nminimum water depth of 2.4 m. This will allow 1,000 dwt capacity vessels and towed barges to \nnavigate to and/or from all cities along the Xiang (773 km) and Yangtze Rivers. \n \nOutput  2:  Cargo  terminal  berths  at  Songbai  and  Yunji  and  public  landing  stages \n21. \nimproved.  Two  80  m  long,  1,000  dwt  berths  will  be  constructed  at  Songbai  and  Yunji.  The \neconomy of Songbai, which is rich in mineral resources, is now constrained by the small size of \nits 300 dwt berth. The proposed 1,000 dwt berth and associated dredging at Yunji will serve the \nnew  town  of  Hengnan  county  and  the  factories  manufacturing  garments,  shoes,  and  other \nconsumer products in its industrial park. The project will also provide 71 landing stages to give \nrural  communities  better  access  to  IWT.  This  output  will  be  financed  by  the  government\u2019s \ncounterpart funding. \n \n22. \nOutput 3: Capacity and performance of waterway management agencies enhanced. \nThe  project  will  strengthen  Hunan\u2019s  institutional  capacity  for  developing  and  administering  its \ninland waterway system by providing consulting services, training, equipment, and studies. It will \nhelp  the  HPG  formulate  policies  and  measures  to  promote  IWT  development.  An  IWT \ndevelopment road map is in Appendix 2 of the project administration manual (footnote 21).  \n                                                 \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $393.32  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$21.17 million  (Table  1).  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 27-year term, including \na grace period of 7 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,22 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The loan \nwill  also  finance  transport,  insurance,  local  bank  charges,  and  taxes  and  duties 23  on  the \nexpenditures financed by ADB. \n \nThe ADB loan proceeds will be made available to the HPDOT through the HPG on the \n24. \nsame  terms  and  conditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  HPG  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the \nimplementing agency (XNCD or its successor) on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB loan. The HPDOT and XNCD will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation \nrisks for the ADB loan. The government will finance contingencies and financing charges during \nimplementation.  \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n\nAmounta\n\nTugutang navigation-cum-hydropower complex \na.

During the feasibility study and preliminary \ndesign phases, alternatives were analyzed and the design was optimized, with a focus on the key \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\ftechnical  elements.  Aspects  addressed  included  the  navigation-cum-hydropower  complex  site \nand layout, river water level, flood control, the layout of the complex, ship lock capacity, and the \ntype of hydropower plant. These efforts will limit the need for any further design changes. They \nwill also help ensure that a realistic construction schedule, based on up-to-date information, is \nadopted  in  the  tendering  documents.  The  technical  specifications  are  provided  in  the  project \nadministration  manual  (footnote  21).  The  project  will  finance  a  five-member  technical  advisory \npanel to review all technical, operational, and safety aspects of the detailed design, procurement, \nand construction, among other aspects. The panel will conduct periodic reviews in the fields of \ngeology,  seismology,  sedimentation,  concrete  placement,  environmental  protection,  land \nacquisition, and resettlement. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n28. \nCargo traffic is increasing steadily on the Xiang River, which shows that IWT is a cost-\neffective  method  for  transporting  bulk  freight.  IWT  carried 12%  of  the total  ton-km  of  freight  in \nHunan in 2010. Once the project is complete and the intended water level reached, the average \nsize of vessels using the Tugutang section is projected to increase from 225 dwt in 2010 to 516 \ndwt  in  2020  and  649  dwt  in  2030.  IWT  on  the  Xiang  River  will  become  more  cost-effective, \nbecause larger vessels will be able to navigate upstream to Jinweizhou (see map) from Shanghai \nor Chongqing on the Yangtze River during the dry season. The traffic forecast is in Appendix 3 of \nproject administration manual (footnote 21).   \n \n29. \nThis is a multipurpose project. Its quantified economic benefits comprise (i) savings in the \ncost of inland waterway transport, (ii) benefits from hydropower generation, and (iii) reduction in \ngreenhouse gases and air pollution through clean energy production. On average, the project will \navoid the emission of approximately 290,000 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each \nyear by generating electricity through hydropower rather than fossil fuels. It will further reduce \nsuch  emissions  by  reducing  highway  traffic  congestion  as  the  transport  of  bulk  cargo  shifts  to \nwaterways from roads. The project will also contribute to more reliable irrigation. The project is \neconomically  viable,  with  an  estimated  economic  rate  of  return  of  14%.  Sensitivity  analysis \nconfirms the robustness of its economic viability.  \n \nThe  financial  analysis  confirmed  that  the  project  is  financially  viable.  The  estimated \n30. \nfinancial internal rate of return of 3.32% exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 2.25%. \nElectricity revenues will allow the project to meet debt service obligations as well as provide for \noperation  and  maintenance.  The  HPG  has  agreed  to  provide  budgetary  support  to  cover  any \nshortfall of funds if needed. \n \nC. \n \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \n31. \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nthe ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement \ndocuments and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  the  HPG,  the  HPDOT,  and  XNCD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 21). \n \nD. \n \n32.  Waterway users will benefit from the expanded, more affordable, and more reliable IWT \nservices  the  project  will  provide.  The  complex\u2019s  hydropower  facility  will  generate  health  and \n\nPoverty, Gender and Social \n\nGovernance \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fenvironmental  benefits  through  better  air  quality  by  replacing  a  new  thermal  power  plant  that \nwould have been needed in a without-project scenario to meet demand for electricity.  \n \n33. \nThe project will extend IWT cargo services to remote areas. It will reduce transport costs \nbetween the comparatively less developed inland province of Hunan and the PRC\u2019s economically \ndynamic coastal region. This will benefit 14 million people in cities of Hengyang and Yongzhou, \nand Guiyang county. The beneficiaries will include 637,000 rural residents and 273,000 urban \ndwellers  who  are  poor,  based  on  the  government\u2019s  average  annual  per  capita  net  income  of \nCNY1,196 for rural areas and its minimum living standard scheme for urban areas. The poor will \nbenefit  in  particular  through  the  improved  access  to  markets  they  will  gain  for  their  products. \nStarting in 2017, the project\u2019s annual power output of 363 GWh of clean and renewable energy \nwill  meet  the  electricity  needs  of  about  300,000  households.  Local  officials  in  the  project  area \nestimate that at least 50,000 additional jobs will be created during implementation.  \n \n34. \nGender benefits (effective gender mainstreaming). The project design includes several \ngender-sensitive  measures,  with  a  focus  on  consultation  with  women  and  their  involvement  in \nnon-farm  training.  XNCD  will  work  with  women\u2019s  federations,  contractors,  and  communities  to \nfacilitate paid work for women in the project\u2019s physical works, and to ensure that all PRC labor \nlaws and core labor standards are respected. Livelihood restoration and gender mainstreaming \nmeasures  associated  with  resettlement  are  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  project \ndesign. The project will allocate $50,000 to provide non-farming skills training to women that will \nopen up new job opportunities for them in the project\u2019s two port improvement areas. The project \nwill ensure active participation by women by appointing a qualified staff member in XNCD to be \nresponsible for the dissemination of information, implementation, and monitoring of the gender \naction plan. \n \nE. \n \nEnvironment (category A). There are no nature reserves or protected areas around the \n35. \nproject complex. The complex will have a run-of-the-river barrage structure with a low head of 10 \nmeters.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  PRC \nregulatory  framework  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). 24 Two  rounds  of  public \nconsultations  were  undertaken,  including  a  community  survey.  The  environmental  impact \nassessment was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and made public through the ADB website \non  4  August  2011.  The  potential  effects  include  adverse  impacts  on  water  quality  through  re-\nsuspension of heavy metals in sediments and subsequent impacts on downstream water quality. \nThe project environmental management plan provides $16.5 million for mitigation measures to \nprevent  or  reduce  project\u2019s  potential  environmental  impacts.  The  HPDOT  and  XNCD  will \nimplement  the  environmental  management  plan,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the  bidding \ndocuments  and  contracts  for  civil  works.  Impacts  will  be  monitored  and  semiannual  reports \nsubmitted to ADB. In addition to the project\u2019s mitigation measures, the HPG will invest $9.2 billion \nto support a variety of environmental mitigation measures to prevent water pollution in Xiang River \nfrom 2011\u20132015. \n \nResettlement (category A). A resettlement plan was developed in accordance with the \n36. \nPRC\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, with participation from local \ngovernments and the affected people.25 Resettlement information booklets have been distributed \nto  affected  villages.  The  project  will  affect  53  villages  in  14  townships  and/or  towns  in  three \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                 \n24  Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\ncounties. The project will permanently acquire 386.1 ha of land and will temporarily occupy 13.1 \nha  of  land.  Most  of  the  affected  households  will  lose  only  part  of  their  total  landholding.  Land \nacquisition and house demolition is expected to affect 5,286 persons. A total of 30 households \n(127 persons) will need to be relocated. The resettlement budget is estimated at CNY467 million, \nor about 19% of the project cost. The project is classified as category C for impact on indigenous \npeoples, with none expected and no action required.  \n \nF. \n \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWeak  coordination  between  agencies \nlimits the development potential of IWT. \n\nThe  upgrading  of  IWT  vessels  is  slow \nand  shippers  remain  reluctant  to  shift \nfreight through IWT. \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IWT = inland waterway transport. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  Hunan  provincial  government  has  set  up  a  waterway  transport \ndevelopment committee. This high-level committee for IWT development \nwill coordinate all relevant agencies and resolve potential conflicts.  \nRisks will be mitigated by implementing the agreed incentive measures \nfor modal shift as well as publicity campaign to make shippers aware of \nbenefits  and  lower  costs  of  using  the  improved  all-year  navigation \nchannel.  \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe Government of the PRC and the HPG have assured ADB that implementation of the \n38. \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. The government has \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$150,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Hunan  Xiangjiang  Inland  Waterway \nTransport  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  27  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  7  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented \nto the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n15 November 2012 \n\n                                                 \n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nAn efficient, safe, \naffordable, and \nsustainable inland \nwaterway transport \nsystem developed in \nHunan province \nOutcome \nA low carbon \nwaterway transport \nsystem improved on \nthe Xiang River in \nHunan province \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\nAssumption \nGovernment \ninvestments in waterway \ntransport projects are \nimplemented as \nplanned. \n \nAssumptions \nConstruction of other \nnavigation complexes on \nXiang River proceed as \nplanned. \n \n\nThe MOT and the \nHPDOT maintain \npolicies to modernize \nthe IWT vessel fleet. \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nHunan Navigation \nStatistical Yearbook \n \n \n\n \nHunan Navigation \nStatistical Yearbook  \n\nHPDOT \n\nPCR \n\nOutputs  \n1.
