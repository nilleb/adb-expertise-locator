It will also recognize and \nsupport the government\u2019s sharpened focus on the financial sector arising out of the global financial \ncrisis. Reform priorities include measures to enhance financial sector stability and liquidity, and to \nsupport  the  development  of  more  effective  regulatory  architecture.  Finally,  the  reformulated \nsubprogram  seeks  to  reduce  the  potential  of  regulatory  arbitrage  and  capture  by  directly \naddressing governance and operational weaknesses in the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) and Insurance Commission that had led to slippage under the original subprogram 2.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe Philippine capital markets do not produce a level of intermediation sufficient to support \ngrowth  and  alleviate  poverty.  Capital  market  development  has  been  constrained  by  the \npredominance  of  family-owned  mixed  use  conglomerates,  connected  lending,  a  perception  of \nheightened  market  instability,  low  investor  confidence,  and  the  lack  of  an  enabling  environment.  \nInadequate  intermediation  between  savers  and  investors  has  slowed  Philippine  economic  growth \nand development.   \n \n4. \nThe  government  recognizes  these  issues,  including  the  linkage  between  financial  sector \ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction,2 and  has  prioritized  financial  sector  development  within  its \ndevelopment plan. The program cluster is anchored in the Medium-Term Philippines Development \nPlan,  2004\u20132010.  To  increase  the  contribution  of  the  financial  sector  to  growth  and  poverty \nreduction, this plan seeks to mobilize savings to achieve a savings to GDP rate of 25%\u201330% and \nan  investment  to  GDP  rate  of  28%.  The  program  will  contribute  to  economic  growth  and \ndevelopment by providing an enabling environment, increasing investment alternatives, enhancing \ndisclosures, and improving market efficiency. In turn, financial sector development will help reduce \npoverty  through  higher  economic  growth,  financial  sector  inclusiveness,  and  financial  sector \nstability.  \n \n5. \nThe  impact  and  lessons  of  the  global  financial  crisis  have  highlighted  weaknesses  in  the \nPhilippine  financial  sector  that  were  not  addressed  by  the  original  subprogram  2.  The  crisis \ndemonstrated  the  importance  of  maintaining  financial  stability,  including  the  capacity  to  provide \nliquidity in sufficient quantity and at reasonable price to ensure smooth functioning of the financial \nand payment systems. The crisis also increased  recognition of the need to strengthen regulatory \noversight  to  reduce  financial  sector  vulnerabilities,  and  in  particular  the  need  to  enhance \n\n                                                 \n1 Slippage  under  the  original  subprogram  2  occurred  when  the  SEC  and  Insurance  Commission  failed  to  implement \npolicy  actions  agreed  to  under  the  original  program.  The  SEC  failed  to  strengthen  market  surveillance,  monitoring  of \nbroker/dealers and PSE self-regulatory functions and failed to lodge the necessary amendments to law with Congress. \nThe  Insurance  Commission  deferred  a  planned  re-organization,  and  eventually  completed  the  reorganization  in  a \nmanner  inconsistent  with  the  agreed  policy  action.  The  Insurance  Commission  also  indefinitely  deferred  the \nimplementation of higher capital standards.     \n2 There  is  a  strong  positive  relationship  between  the  level  of  financial  sector  assets  and  per  capita  incomes  and  the \nincidence  of  poverty.  See  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Finance  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncoordination  and  cooperation  between  micro  and  macro-prudential  supervision.  Enhanced \ncoordination  is  necessary  to  achieve  better  supervision  of  complex  conglomerates  that  operate \nacross commercial, banking, securities, and insurance markets. Should the efforts of the regulator \nfail, the financial system must be  backstopped by an effective resolution methodology. The crisis \nunderscored the need to maintain an adequately funded deposit insurance mechanism to minimize \nthe  risk  of  depositor  flight  and  contagion.  It  also  highlighted  the  need  to  establish  and  maintain \nefficient and liquid markets, as countries with well-functioning and liquid local bond markets were \nbetter able to cope with shocks to the global credit markets.     \n \nSubprogram 2 has been reformulated to address three key considerations. First, there has \n6. \nbeen a sharpened and renewed focus with regard to government policy priorities for the financial \nsector.  Subprogram  2  now  includes  a  number  of  measures  designed  to  enhance  financial  sector \nstability in direct response to heightened instability arising out of the global financial crisis. Second, \nsubprogram  2  recognizes  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  coordinate  micro  and  macro  prudential \nsupervision;  and  to  close  the  gaps  in  supervision  caused  by  the  use  of  separate  functional \nregulators to supervise complex, mixed use conglomerates. Third, the reformulated subprogram 2 \nsupports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  address  significant  weaknesses  in  the  governance  and \noperational effectiveness of both the SEC and the Insurance Commission that had led to slippage \nunder the original subprogram 2. The SEC and the Insurance Commission operated with a lack of \nfiscal autonomy and inadequate budgets. In turn, suppressed salaries and high employee turnover \nlimited the ability of the SEC to perform effective market surveillance and on-site examinations of \nthe financial entities under its mandate.  \n \n7. \nBy strengthening the coordination between regulators, as well as the operational and fiscal \nautonomy  of  the  SEC  and  the  Insurance  Commission,  sequenced  capacity  development  can  be \ninitiated,  which  will  allow  the  government  to  focus  more  effectively  on  the  issues  that  have \nconstrained development of the capital markets.  \n \nFinally,  subprogram  2  will  assist  the  government  in  alleviating  poverty  by  developing  a \n8. \nfinancial  sector  that  is  deeper,  more  diversified,  and  more  responsive  to  the  immediate  funding \nneeds  of  the  economy.  Financial  intermediaries  will  be  enabled  to  develop  a  wider  range  of \nattractive  financial  products  for  consumers,  which  will  improve  individual  incomes  as  well  as  the \nefficiency of intermediation by channeling greater savings into the financial system. Development \nof the capital market will also reduce transactions costs and contribute to macroeconomic stability, \nproviding  an  environment  that  fosters  the  creation  of  income-  and  employment-generating \nactivities.   \n \n9. \nThe original subprogram 2 specified 39 indicative actions, of which 10 were policy triggers \nfor  subprogram  2.  The  reformulated  subprogram  2  merged  several  of  the  indicative  actions  to \nreflect  accomplishments,  several  measures  were  refined,  and  some  were  shifted  to  the  post-\nprogram partnership framework (P3F) 3 to reflect the sequencing of reforms.4 Others were dropped \non the basis that they are no longer relevant, improperly sequenced or overly prescriptive. Of the \n10  original  policy  triggers  for  subprogram  2,  five  have  been  fully  accomplished,  three  have  been \npartially  accomplished  and  retained  as  policy  triggers  under  subprogram  2,  and  two  have  been \nmoved to the P3F to reflect a proper sequencing of reforms and the difficulty involved in enacting \nlaws.  Given  the  linkage  between  the  original  and  reformulated  subprogram  2,  no  significant \nchanges were made to the impact, outcome, or outputs of the program. The size of subprogram 2 \n                                                 \n3 The P3F is a medium-term action plan that has been agreed to by the government and ADB. This action plan contains \na  series  of  indicative  actions  designed  to  continue  the  momentum  of  reform  beyond  subprogram  2.  However,  these \nactions, which can be found in the attached policy matrix, do not represent conditionalities or formal commitments.    \n4 Status  of  Original  Indicative  Actions  from  Financial  Market  Regulation  and  Intermediation  Program,  Subprogram  2 \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nhas been maintained at $200 million in accordance with the original recommendation provided in \nsubprogram 1.5,6  \n \n \n10. \nTo  maintain  the  momentum  and  sustainability  of  reforms,  the  government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  have  agreed  to  a  revised  P3F  covering  the  next  24  months,  which \ncreates a basis for continuous policy dialogue. The P3F includes 16 indicative measures designed \nto  (i)  enhance  regulatory  coordination  and  cooperation,  including  micro  and  macro  prudential \nsupervision; (ii) strengthen banking resolution and asset disposition processes; (iii) restructure the \nSEC  and  boost  surveillance  and  examination  capabilities;  (iv)  strengthen  the  Insurance \nCommission; and (v) implement an active debt management strategy. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of FMRIP-02 will be improved access to finance and increased contribution of \n11. \nthe  financial  sector  to  economic  growth.  The  outcome  will  be  a  deeper,  more  diversified,  and \nresilient financial sector.   \n \nThe  reformulated  subprogram  2  and  the  P3F  include  a  set  of  accomplishments  and \n12. \nproposed measures to mitigate increased risks to the financial sector in the short term arising from \nthe  global  financial  crisis.  The  subprogram  also  contains  longer-term  measures  to  strengthen \npublic debt management as well as the policy and regulatory framework of the financial sector to \nmitigate future system shocks. To meet these objectives, the reformulated subprogram comprises \nthree primary outputs: enhanced financial sector stability, strengthened financial sector regulatory \noversight, and improved financial sector efficiency and liquidity. \n \n13.  While  the  impact,  outcome,  and  outputs  of  subprogram  2  mirror  those  of  subprogram  1, \nchanges  have  been  incorporated  to  sharpen  the  focus  of  the  program.  In  particular,  the  outputs \nhave  been  shifted  to  outcomes  to  reflect  the  requirements  of  the  current  design  and  monitoring \nframework. In addition, a number of performance indicators have been omitted to reflect progress \nmade  under  subprogram  1.  Other  qualitative  performance  measures  have  been  replaced  with \nmore relevant and focused quantitative indicators. Assumptions and risks have been compacted to \neliminate duplication. \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Enhanced Financial Sector Stability \n\n14. \nTo  mitigate  the  immediate  effects  of  the  crisis,  the  government  has  enacted  a  number  of \nmeasures  to  strengthen  its  ability  to  assure  the  stability  of  the  financial  sector  and  to  reduce \nsystemic risk. The central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), adopted measures to provide \nadditional liquidity to the banking sector and enhanced its ability to serve as a lender of last resort \nby  doubling  the  peso  rediscounting  facility  to  P60  million,  as  well  as  opening  a  US dollar \nrepurchase  facility.  BSP  also  submitted  proposed  amendments  to  Congress  to  strengthen  its \nmonetary policy framework, including a mandate to carry out open market operations of BSP bills. \nIn addition, Congress doubled the deposit insurance ceiling to P500,000 and granted the Philippine \nDeposit  Insurance  Corporation  (PDIC)  additional  powers,  including  the  flexibility  to  adjust  the \nmaximum  deposit  insurance  ceiling  in  times  of  systemic  stress  and  to  exclude  deposits  from  the \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster, Loan, \nand  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Financial  Market  Regulation  and \nIntermediation Program. Manila (Loan 2278-PHI, approved on 6 December). \n\n6  A  total  loan  of  US$400  million  from  the  ADB's  Ordinary  Capital  Resources  was  approved  for  Financial  Market \nRegulation and Intermediation Program under the two subprograms - US$200 million for Subprogram 1 and US$200 \nmillion for Subprogram 2. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ndeposit  insurance  coverage  scheme  in  cases  of  fraud  or  abuse.  PDIC  also  established  a \nmechanism to build up and maintain an adequate deposit insurance fund (DIF) and has approved \na  resolution  for  submission  to  Congress  in  support  of  legislation  to  establish  bridge  banking  and \nother resolution methodologies.   \n \nThe  Philippines  has  completed  a  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program 7  and,  under \n15. \nsubprogram 2, the BSP, PDIC, and SEC have begun implementing corrective actions to address \nfinancial sector risks as well as regulatory and structural bottlenecks identified in the assessment. \nThe  BSP  and  PDIC  have  combined  their  efforts  to  encourage  industry  consolidation.  The \nStrengthening  Program  for  Rural  Banks  was  launched  with  P5  billion  in  funding  to  provide \nincentives  for  weaker  rural  banks  to  merge  with  stronger  rural  banks.  The  PDIC  board  also \napproved  the  investor-investee  framework,  which  is  an  electronic  matching  system  intended  to \nfacilitate mergers, acquisitions, and consolidation among banks. \n    \n16. \nTo enhance financial sector stability and reduce systemic risk, the Department of Finance \n(DOF)  has  strengthened  its  capacity  for  public  debt  management  and  has  prepared  a  needs \nassessment  for  its  newly  established  Debt  and  Risk  Management  Division.  The  division \nsubsequently  prepared  a  draft  public  debt  management  strategy  for  FY2011  as  well  as  a  debt \nsustainability assessment for FY\u2019s 2010 and 2011. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Strengthened Financial Sector Regulatory Oversight \n\n17. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  measures  were  implemented  to  improve  interagency  coordination \nand sharing of information, and to strengthen regulatory oversight functions in the financial sector. \nThe  enforcement  powers  of  the  PDIC  were  strengthened  and  the  SEC  enhanced  its  capacity  for \nmarket  surveillance.  Subprogram  2  addresses  the  long-standing  governance  weaknesses  of  the \nSEC and the Insurance Commission by sequencing reforms over the medium to long term, with the \nprimary  objective  of  lifting  the  capacity  of  the  two  agencies  toward  a  par  with  the  other  financial \nsector regulators (i.e., BSP and PDIC).  \n \n18. \nSubprogram  2  also  promotes  greater  integration  and  coordination  between  the  different \nregulators,  with  the  goal  of  establishing  a  highly  coordinated  financial  sector  regulatory  and \nsurveillance  framework  to  enhance  the  conduct  of  micro  and  macro  prudential  supervision. \nMemorandums  of  understanding  setting  out  the  working  relationship  of  the  regulators  in  the \nFinancial Stability Forum (FSF)8 have been signed. Standing committees have been established to \naddress  standardization  of  supervision  and  risk  measurement  across  regulators,  as  well  as  for \noptimizing  the  regulatory  architecture.  BSP  has  just  issued  its  third  Financial  Sector  Stability \nReport.9 Subprogram 2 initially anticipates supporting the internal efforts of the FSF to strengthen \nearly warning systems, and promoting better coordination and communication. Subprogram 2 will \nstrengthen coordination between BSP and the PDIC with regard to the examination of problematic \nbanks to lessen the risk to the DIF.  \n \n19. \nCongress amended the PDIC charter to grant the agency the authority to adopt a  new or \nrevised  organizational  structure  and  to  provide  enhanced  legal  protection  for  its  staff.  The  PDIC \nmay  now  conduct  special  examinations  in  coordination  with  BSP  when  there  are  threats  of  bank \n\n                                                 \n7   International  Monetary  Fund.  2010.  Financial  System  Stability  Assessment  Update.  IMF  Country  Report  No.  10/90. \n\nWashington, DC (April). \n\n8  The  FSF,  which  is  chaired  by  the  BSP  and  governed  by  a  memorandum  of  understanding,  is  a  semiformal \ncoordinating  body  of  the  financial  sector  regulatory  agencies  in  the  Philippines  including  the  BSP,  the  Insurance \nCommission, the SEC, and the PDIC. \n\n9  This Financial Sector Stability Report is currently circulated as an internal document with external publication planned \n\nafter the document has been thoroughly vetted by stakeholders.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nclosures, and may examine deposit accounts in cases of unsafe and unsound practices. Congress \nfurther granted the PDIC the authority to rescind splitting of deposits within 120 days before bank \nclosure. This authority is expected to enhance stability and to contain losses to the DIF arising out \nof  high  rate  deposit  promotions  that  have  been  used  to  forestall  the  timely  resolution  of  problem \nbanks.  The  extension  of  examination  authority  to  deposit  accounts  in  specified  situations  is  also \nexpected  to  curtail  the  use  of  high  rate  deposit  promotions  to  fund  fraudulent  or  other  improper \nactivities. \n   \n20. \nSubprogram  2  places  the  SEC  under  the  DOF\u2019s  administrative  authority,  which  should \nstrengthen the SEC\u2019s ability to pursue reforms.10 The DOF, in consultation with the SEC, produced \nand endorsed an action plan for restructuring the SEC. This plan identified the core responsibilities \nof the SEC and recommended arrangements to deal with non-core responsibilities. It also identified \norganizational structures, staffing complements and skill sets, and pay scales. Finally, the plan will \nidentify  a  funding  mechanism  to  ensure  the  eventual  administrative  and  fiscal  autonomy  of  the \nagency. In the interim, the government (Department of Budget and Management [DBM]) raised the \nSEC\u2019s proposed 2011 general budget appropriation to accommodate the priority recommendations \nof  the  action  plan,  as  committed  to  higher  resources  in  the  DBM\u2019s  forward  estimates,  until  an \nindependent, self-funding mechanism can be established.   \n \n21. \nThe  DOF,  in  consultation  with  the  Insurance  Commission,  will  produce  an  action  plan  for \nrestructuring  the  Insurance  Commission.  This  plan  will  contain  recommendations  regarding \nrestructuring  the  agency  to  address  the  organizational  structure  as  well  as  staff  size,  skills,  and \nremuneration.  As  with  the  SEC,  recommendations  will  be  provided  to  establish  a  funding \nmechanism to ensure ongoing administrative and fiscal autonomy. Completion and implementation \nof the action plan will be monitored under the P3F.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Improved Efficiency and Liquidity in Securities Markets \n\nTo develop an efficient and liquid secondary market, the SEC defined the guidelines for the \n22. \nover-the-counter market, which included the requirement for a central trade reporting system. This \neffectively provides for price discovery of the bilateral transactions that define the over-the-counter \nmarket, aligning it with the data capture and reporting standards used in exchange-based markets. \nSubsequently,  the  SEC  approved  listing  requirements  and  trading  rules  of  the  designated  self-\nregulatory  organization,  effectively  providing  an  enabling  environment  for  trading  in  corporate \nbonds on the fixed-income exchange. To stimulate secondary trading and accelerate the pace of \ncapital market development, Congress enacted a permanent stamp duty exemption for secondary \ntrading of listed companies.  \n \n23. \nSeveral enabling laws were passed, including the Personal Equity Retirement Account Act, \n2008,  which  creates  a  tax-free  personal  retirement  account,  and  the  Law  on  Real  Estate \nInvestment Trusts, 2009, which is expected to act as a stimulus to capital market development by \nproviding a method to increase investor participation in the real estate market. Together, these acts \nshould stimulate demand for both investment products and professional investment management. \nImplementing  regulations  for  the  Personal  Equity  Retirement  Act  are  expected  to  include  a \nrequirement  for  formal  training  and  licensing  of  investment  professionals  similar  to  the  Series  7 \nlicense in the United States. Finally, the Credit Information System Act, 2008, should improve the \nflow of credit by providing banks and other credit granting institutions better access to information \non which to base underwriting and pricing decisions.  \n \n\n                                                 \n10 Since early 2009, the SEC has been under the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Industry. \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nPost-Program Partnership Framework \n\n24. \nTo  maintain  the  momentum  and  sustainability  of  the  reforms,  the  government  and  ADB \nhave  agreed  to  a  post-program  monitoring  framework  covering  the  next  24  months.  Actions \nplanned  within  the  framework  focus  on  three  primary  objectives:  (i)  strengthening  regulatory \ncooperation  and  coordination  to  enhance  the  linkages  between  micro  and  macro  prudential \nregulation, (ii) regulatory capacity development, and (iii) enhancing public debt management. \n \n25. \nTo  continue  strengthening  collective  oversight  of  the  financial  markets,  BSP  along  with \nother  members  of  the  FSF  will  explore  alternative  arrangements  with  respect  to  the  joint \nsupervision  of  the  financial  submarkets,  and  will  improve  disclosures,  streamline  reporting  by \nregulated financial entities, and initiate a more effective framework for sharing information among \nthe FSF. In line with the Financial Sector Assessment Program priority recommendations, the FSF \nwill, where and when warranted, invite the DOF to participate in FSF meetings, and BSP and the \nPDIC will enhance coordination with regard to early intervention in problem banks.  \n \n26. \nCapacity development during the P3F covers a wide array of activities, and begins with the \nimplementation of an action plan to restructure the SEC and to implement a capacity development \nprogram for on-site examinations of regulated entities in line with international standards. Further, \nthe  SEC  will  enhance  its  market  surveillance  system  to  provide  regulatory  parity  in  terms  of \nsupervision,  reporting,  and  compliance  with  risk-based  capital  adequacy  requirements  between \nbroker  members  of  the  Philippine  Stock  Exchange  (PSE)  and  nonmembers  who  currently  report \ndirectly to the SEC. The Insurance Commission will reorganize in a manner similar to the SEC and \nwill strengthen its risk-based capital adequacy formula in line with international standards.   \n \n27. \nTo  strengthen  public  debt  management,  the  DOF  will  implement  its  public  debt \nmanagement  strategy,  and  will  continue  to  update  the  strategy  and  the  debt  sustainability \nassessment on an annual basis. Additional, but less predictable, actions under the P3F include the \npassage of amendments to the BSP\u2019s charter, and the Securities Regulation Code.   \n \nD. \n\nProgram Costs and Financing \n\nThe  size  of  the  proposed  loan  is  based  primarily  on  (i)  the  importance  of  the  sector  in \n28. \nsupporting the economic growth of the Philippines, and (ii) the considerable real costs involved in \nimplementing the reforms as well as the political resistance to strengthening the regulators. In the \nabsence  of  timely  reforms,  the  financial  sector  will  remain  vulnerable  to  systemic  risks,  and \ninvestors will be vulnerable to fraud and misconduct. \n \n29. \nDirect  adjustment  costs  are  considered  significant  at  an  estimated  $263  million,  net  of \nshort-term  gains.11 Administrative  costs  will  increase  under  subprogram  2,  including  the  recently \nlaunched  Strengthening  Program  for  Rural  Banks,  which  provides  financial  incentives  for  weaker \nrural  banks  to  merge  with  stronger  rural  banks.  This  fund  has  been  supported  by  initial \ncapitalization of P5 billion obtained in equal parts from BSP and the PDIC. Reorganizing the SEC \nand increasing its budget commensurate with its mandate will require a diversion of funds from the \nnational budget back to the SEC. In addition, capital expenditures will be required to upgrade the \nagencies  Information  Technology  infrastructure  and  surveillance  capabilities.  Moreover,  other \nagencies,  including  the  PDIC  will  be  required  to  boost  operating  budgets  due  to  the  increase  in \nduties and functions arising out of the revised laws, and the government will be required to fund the \nnewly created Debt Management Office. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n30. \nFiscal  costs  are  also  considered  significant.  When  the  legacy  banking  system  finally \ncollapsed in late 2008, due to unsafe and unsound lending practices, the attendant losses to the \nPDIC  alone  were  estimated  at  $326  million.  At  the  same  time,  the  national  government  has \nprovided a direct backstop in the form of a guarantee of the additional deposit insurance coverage \nin  excess  of  previous  P250,000  maximum  for  a  period  of  3  years.  Estimates  indicate  that,  at  the \ndate  of  the  increase  in deposit  insurance  coverage,  insured  deposits increased  by  35%  or  by  $8 \nbillion. Thus, a contingent liability has been created for an as-yet-undetermined amount over this 3-\nyear period. Further, the permanent exemption of the documentary stamp tax on secondary sales \nof listed securities is estimated to reduce revenue to the government by between $5 million to $10 \nmillion  per  year.  While  the  Personal  Equity  Retirement  Account  (PERA)  and  the  Real  Estate \nInvestment Trust (REIT) acts are expected to be tax neutral, revenue losses in the near term are \nmore likely than not. \n \nTo support these reforms, the government has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s \n31. \nordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  government  has \nprovided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe program cluster implementation period is from 1 January 2005 to 15 October 2011 and \n32. \nthe  subprogram  2  implementation  period  is  from  1  January  2008  to  15  October  2011.  Loan \nproceeds will be available to the Philippines as the borrower for subprogram 2 with withdrawal in a \nsingle  tranche,  subject  to  conditions  specified  in  the  loan  agreement.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be \nused to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans12,  the  proceeds  of  the \nprogram loan will be disbursed to the Philippines as the borrower. \n \n33. \nUnder the original subprogram 1, approved by ADB Board of Directors in December 2006, \nthe  DOF  was  designated  the  executing  agency  and  the  SEC  was  designated  the  implementing \nagency as well as the chair of the coordinating committee established under the program cluster. \nThe  reformulated  subprogram  2  retains  the  DOF  as  the  executing  agency.    However,  FMRIP-02 \nexpands  responsibility  for  implementation  by  naming  all  affected  agencies  as  implementing \nagencies, including; DOF, SEC, BSP, PDIC and Insurance Commission. The DOF will replace the \nSEC  as  chair  of  the  coordinating  committee,  which  will  comprise  the  DOF  as  chair,  and \nrepresentatives  from  BSP,  the  PDIC,  the  Insurance  Commission,  the  Philippine  Dealing  and \nExchange  Corporation,  and  the  PSE.  The  committee  will  meet  semi-annually  to  coordinate  and \nensure effective implementation of the proposed reforms. Under the P3F, the DOF would become \nthe coordinating agency but would rely on the FSF to coordinate policy matters related to that body \nof regulators.   \n \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nGovernance \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n34. \nSerious concerns have been raised with regard to inadequate standards of governance and \nthe  incidence  of  corruption  in  the  Philippines.  The  government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Philippine \nDevelopment Plan views graft and corruption as threats to the sustained growth and development \nof the country. The consensus is strong that good governance and a curtailment of corruption are \nneeded for a successful partnership to reduce poverty in the Philippines. \n \nIn  view  of  these  issues,  subprogram  2  has  been  designed  to  enhance  governance  and \n35. \nreduce opportunities for corruption. The thrust will be to restart and implement regulatory reforms \nby promoting the independence of the regulators, and to separate operator and regulator functions. \nMoreover, institutional reforms will aim to ensure transparency and accountability to mitigate, if not \neradicate,  administrative  impropriety  of  government  agencies.  This  will  be  reinforced  by \nencouraging closer cooperation and coordination among the financial services regulatory agencies. \nCollectively,  all  three  regulatory  agencies  are  increasing  the  level  of  their  coordination  and \ncooperation within the FSF. Such coordination and transparency is expected to boost the capacity \nof  all  three  regulators  and  to  reduce  the  possibility  of  capture  of  any  one  of  the  agencies. \nIndividually, the regulatory bodies have moved to strengthen governance over the program cluster \nimplementation  period.  The  addition  of  BSP  as  a  stakeholder  introduces  a  strong  voice  and \nchampion of reform. \n \n36. \nSignificant progress is noted in strengthening public expenditure management and reducing \ncorruption in the revenue-collecting agencies. ADB, in conjunction with the World Bank and Japan \nthe \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  has  been  engaged  with \nDevelopment  Policy  and  Support  Program. 13 Overall,  the  program  supported  enhancements  to \npublic  financial  management  governance  by  (i)  improving  budget  preparation,  budget  execution, \naccounting,  recording,  and  reporting;  (ii)  strengthening  performance  management  and  improving \npublic  service  delivery;  (iii)  reforming  procurement;  and  (iv)  implementing  anticorruption  and \nenforcement strategies for revenue-collecting agencies, and key procurement agencies.  \n \n37. \nThe  government  has  also  initiated  measures  in  the  revenue  agencies  and  selected  line \nministries  to  reduce  corruption.  These  actions  included  the  completion  of  integrity  development \nreviews  in  key  agencies,  publication  of  audit  reports  for  all  government  departments,  and  the \ninitiation of anticorruption revenue programs which have led to an increase in the number of cases \nfiled  to  Department  of  Justice.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the DOF.  \n \n38. \nFollowing the program period, the DOF will report to ADB on a semi-annual basis to assess \nthe  impact  of  the  program,  and  will  hold  consultative  meetings  as  needed  with  stakeholders  and \ndevelopment  partners  to  solicit  their  feedback  on  emerging  regulations  involving  the  financial \nsector  and  the  impact  of  the  program  cluster  and  the  P3F  implementation.  The  government  and \nADB will jointly carry out periodic progress reviews regarding the impact and evaluate the benefits \nof the program, comprising performance indicators agreed by the government and ADB. The DOF \nwill  be  responsible  for  maintaining  all  monitoring  data  and  evaluating  program  benefits.  It  will \nsubmit a program completion report to ADB within 12 months after the program period, assessing \ncompliance with, and the impact of, the agreed actions under  subprogram 2 and program cluster. \nThe  government  will  encourage  development  partners,  business  groups,  and  other  sector \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Report and Recommendation of \nthe President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster, Loan, and Technical Assistance to the Republic of \nthe Philippines for the Development Policy Support Program (Subprogram 1). Manila (Loan 2315-PHI, $250,000,000, \napproved on 8 February). \n\nthe  government \n\nthrough \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nstakeholders  to  support  monitoring  of  the  reforms  and  agreed  actions  under  the  program  cluster \nand the P3F. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nTo achieve its poverty reduction goals, the government will need to generate higher levels \n39. \nof financial intermediation and economic growth. To support higher levels of economic growth and \ninvestment,  the  capital  market  investor  base,  comprising  both  institutional  and  retail  investors, \nneeds  to  be  broadened  and  access  to  the  debt  and  equity  markets  needs  to  be  improved. \nSubprogram  2  will  support  poverty  reduction  first  by  stimulating  higher  economic  growth  and \nimproving  access  to  finance.  Measures  have  been  included  to  strengthen  regulatory  oversight  of \nthe  financial  sector  and  to  enhance  the  liquidity  and  the  depth  of  the  capital  markets.  In  turn, \nincreased  investor  confidence  and  a  reduction  of  institutional  bottlenecks  will  allow  institutions  to \nmobilize  savings  and  redirect  these  funds  to  a  wider  variety  of  profitable  investments.  As  a \nconsequence,  rates  of  savings  and  private  investment  will  increase  over  time  leading  to  higher \neconomic growth and poverty reduction.14 Subprogram 2 includes measures to improve the flow of \ncredit,  particularly  for  small  businesses,  as  well  as  measures  to  strengthen  the  rural  banking \nsector, which provides a primary source of credit to the poor in the Philippines. Subprogram 2 will \nalso alleviate poverty indirectly through measures to enhance financial sector stability.  \n \nSubprogram 2 will provide some gender benefits (Category 3), as it is likely to provide direct \n40. \nand  substantial  benefits  to  women  in  improving  access  to  financial  resources  and  opportunities. \nWhile no specific measures have been included to direct credit or credit-related services to women, \nit  is  anticipated  that  women  will  benefit  both  directly  and  indirectly  from  an  enabling  environment \nprovided by the reforms supported by subprogram 2. For example, the program has the capability \nto benefit women directly through their high levels of business ownership in the informal and micro \nsectors. Indirect benefits are also expected to accrue to women by enhancing credit availability to \nbusinesses in the professional and technical sectors, in which women participate to a larger degree \nthan men, and to the clients of such firms, which should raise incomes overall. \n \nC. \n\nSafeguards \n\nSubprogram  2  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for  the \n41. \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. The following are agreed upon, and \nwill  be  incorporated  in  the  legal  agreement.  Consistent  with  its commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  subprogram  2. \nThe  government  agreed  to  cooperate,  and  shall  cause  any  and  all  government  offices, \norganizations, and entities involving in implementing subprogram 2 to cooperate fully with any such \ninvestigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  providing  access  to  all  relevant \nbooks and records, as may be necessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n \nD. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSubprogram  2  remains  fully  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development \n42. \nPlan, 2004\u20132010. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in the table and described \nin detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15  \n \n \n                                                 \n14 S.

The global economic crisis and \nfollow-on shocks may bring significant levels of \nfinancial instability and subdued economic growth \nto Southeast Asia and the Philippines. \nPolitical. The government reform priorities may \ndissipate or change, and political instability could \nincrease. \n\nCapacity. The absorptive capacity of regulators \nproves to be inadequate and is not harmonized \nwith proper sequencing. \n\nMitigating Measures \nSubprogram 2 contributes to sustaining the economy by strengthening \nregulatory oversight. It also helps to cushion the economy from \nadverse shocks through its provision of significant financial resources \non favorable terms. \nDespite significant political disturbances during 2005 and 2008/09, \nreforms moved ahead albeit with a delay. The government has \nadvanced a reform agenda that subprogram 2 directly supports, and \nenjoys a wide mandate from the electorate. \nSubprogram 2 addresses this risk by providing TA to support the \ndevelopment of action plans for restructuring the SEC and the \nInsurance Commission. In addition, capacity development TA has \nbeen proposed for 2011 to support implementation of subprogram 2. \n\nSEC = Securities and Exchange Commission, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n43. \nThe  government  and  the  DOF  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  subprogram  2 \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in \nthe loan documents. \n \n44. \n \n\nNo disbursements will be made until \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe government transfers administrative responsibility for the SEC back to the DOF \nfrom its current location under the Department of Trade and Industry; \nthe government and the DOF, jointly with the SEC, have  developed and endorsed \nan  action  plan  to  support  an  organizational  restructure  of  the  SEC  to  meet  the \nobjectives described in the policy matrix; and \nthe government through DBM provides SEC with a budget increase in 2011 needed \nto support implementation of the action plan for SEC restructuring. \n\n \nThe loan will not be declared effective until the government, through the DOF, has fulfilled \n45. \nall conditions as set out in the Policy Reform Matrix in Appendix 4, with the exception of the three \n(3) conditions for loan disbursement listed above. Conditions for disbursement have been adopted \nto reflect the interrelated nature of the policy actions by the DOF, SEC and DBM and to facilitate an \nefficient application of increased budget allocations for the SEC.   \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  the \n46. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $200,000,000 \nto  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Financial  Market  Regulation  and \nIntermediation  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n16 November 2010 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1      11\n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n \nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\n \n \n \nCurrent \n\n \nData Sources \nand Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\n \nBusiness Constraint Index \n\u201caccess to credit\u201d declines \nto below 15.0 from 31.8 \n(2005) by 2011 \n \n \n \nOverall Financial Access \nscore improves from 3.6 \n(43rd place in 2008) by \n2011 \n \nIncrease in investment ratio \nto 20% of GDP by 2011 \nfrom 14.6% (2005) \n \nM2/GDP ratio increases to \n50%\u201355% from 43% (2005) \nby end of 2011 \n \n \nFinancial stability index \nimproves from 3.3 \n(48th place in 2008) \n \n \nQuarterly bond turnover \nratio maintained above 0.40 \n(0.56 average in 2005) \n \nRank of financial markets \nimproves from 42nd (2008) \nand score improves from \n2.0 (2008) by 2011 \n \nShare of nonbank financial \nsubsector to exceed 23% of \nfinancial assets from 20% \nby end of 2011 \n \nRatio of total LCY corporate \nbond market increased to \n10% from 1% (2005)% by \nend of 2011 \n \nRatio of stock market to \nGDP increased to 50%\u2013\n55% from 41% (2005) by \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n17.7 \n\n2.5 \n51st place \n \n \n \n\n14.6 \n \n \n\n48.2% \n\n4.1 \n47th place\n \n \n \n\n0.38 \n\n40th \nPlace \n1.8 \n \n\n20% \n \n \n \n \n8.1% \n \n \n \n\n31.2% \n\n \nBSP quarterly \nbusiness \nexpectations \nsurvey \n \n \n \nWorld Economic \nForum Financial \nDevelopment \nReport \n \nADB Country \nOffice \n \n \nADB Key \nIndicators for \nAsia and the \nPacific \n \nWorld Economic \nForum Financial \nDevelopment \nReport \n \nAsia \nBondsOnline \nwebsite \n\nWorld Economic \nForum Financial \nDevelopment \nReport \n \nBSP Website \n \n \n \n \nAsia \nBondsOnline \nWebsite \n \n \nADB Key \nIndicators for \nAsia and the \n\nAssumptions \nGlobal \nmacroeconomic \nconditions remain \nbroadly favorable for \nbusiness and credit \nexpansion \n \nPolitical situation \nremains stable \n \n \nRisk \nGovernment reform \npriorities dissipate or \nchange \n\nAssumption \nCredible \nimplementation of \nreforms under the \nprogram translates to \nan increase in \ninvestor confidence \n \nRisk \nLegislative and \nregulatory framework \nbecomes more rather \nthan less restrictive \n\n \n\n    \n \n \nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \nImproved \naccess to \nfinance and \nincreased \ncontribution of \nthe financial \nsector to \neconomic \ngrowth \n\nOutcome \nA deeper, \nmore \ndiversified and \nresilient \nfinancial sector \n\n \n\n\f12       Appendix 1 \n\n \n\n \n \nDesign \nSummary \n\n \n \nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\n \n \n \nCurrent \n\n \nData Sources \nand Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\nOutputs \n1.
