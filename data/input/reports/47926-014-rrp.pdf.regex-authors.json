I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to the Indian rupee equivalent of $50 million to ReNew Power Ventures \nPrivate Limited for the ReNew Power Investment Project in India. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  India is in chronic need of additional power generation capacity. The Government of \nIndia\u2019s Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u20132012 targeted the creation of 79 gigawatts (GW) of \nadditional conventional power capacity. However, actual realization was no more than 55 GW. \nThe government in its Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2012\u20132017, has set a larger target of 100 GW \nincluding 24 GW of capacity which should have been completed in the previous plan. India also \nneeds to diversify its energy mix, not only to combat climate change but also to ensure the \ncountry\u2019s energy security. The availability of indigenous conventional fuels is diminishing and \nIndia has to import increasing quantities of expensive coal and liquefied natural gas. The share \nof renewable power\u2014including hydropower\u2014in total installed capacity has declined from 44% in \n1970 to 31% in 2011. The government intends to stop this decline and has set a goal of \nmaintaining the proportion of renewable power at its current level (31%) until 2023.1 \n \n3.  The  project  team  has  sought  to  identify  renewable  energy  developers  suitable  for  \nfinancing support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which can make a material impact \nin alleviation of the power shortage in the country. ReNew Power Ventures Private Limited \n(ReNew) was identified as one such developer. The company and ADB initiated a dialogue in \nApril 2013 and ReNew proposed an ADB equity investment of the Indian rupee equivalent of \n$50 million to help finance the company\u2019s growing pipeline of wind projects. \n \n4.  ReNew combines the presence of a credible sponsor, a proven track record, a strong \nproject pipeline, and a high-quality management team, which position the company to become \none of the leading renewable energy players in India. The project is consistent with PSOD's \nstrategy  of  supporting  high-potential  private  renewable  energy  developers  in  India  through \ngrowth capital. ADB's assistance will improve ReNew's ability to attract other investors and \nenable  the  company to  achieve  its target  of at  least  1,000  megawatts  (MW)  of operating \nrenewable power projects in India by 2015. Supporting a developer at the holding level instead \nof at a single project level will leverage ADB\u2019s funds and create greater development impact in \nterms of renewable energy capacity addition (more megawatts per ADB dollar invested) \n \n2.  Project Design \n5.  ADB\u2019s investment enables ReNew\u2019s equity injection in a portfolio of renewable energy \nprojects at various stages of development with a total capacity in excess of 1,000 MW across \nIndia.  \n \n                                                \n1 Government of India. Central Electricity Authority. 2012. National Electricity Plan. Delhi. \n ", "2 \n3.  The Sponsor \n6.  ReNew is an independent power producer and a leading renewable power developer in \nIndia. It was established in 2011 with a vision of developing a best-in-class company which will \nhave a material impact in helping India meet its renewable energy target. Goldman Sachs is one \nof the key investors of ReNew. Since its foundation, ReNew has built a portfolio of over 300 MW \nof  wind  capacity  with  almost  twice  as  much  under  early  stage  development.  ReNew\u2019s \nmanagement  team  consists  of  experts  in  wind  power  development,  engineering,  corporate \nfinance, investment banking and accounting, with each individual having a minimum of 10 years \nof experience in their respective fields. \n \n7.  Goldman Sachs is a strong investor, but it is keen to partner with ADB because of the \nsignificant value which it believes ADB can add to ReNew in the long term. ReNew\u2019s ultimate \ngoal is to become India\u2019s largest renewable energy player and, to this end, the company needs \nto diversify its capital base and partner with an entity which shares the same commitment to, \nand  high  profile  in,  renewable  energy.  ADB,  as  an  additional  shareholder,  will  strengthen \nReNew by bringing in international best practices in areas such as safeguards and corporate \ngovernance, and share some of the knowledge which ADB as a bank has in the  area of \nrenewable energy.  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n8.  The project is expected to accelerate India\u2019s economic growth by providing additional \nlarge-scale power generation capacity to a country where chronic power shortage is a matter of \nwidespread public concern and a constraint on economic growth. In particular, the project will \ncontribute to the development of renewable energy generation for which the government has set \nan ambitious target, and help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in line with the United \nNations\u2019 Millennium Development Goals.2 The project will help in preserving India's energy mix \nby increasing the level of reliance on indigenous renewable resources as opposed to imported \nfossil fuels. \n \n9.  ADB's assistance will also support private sector development by catalyzing private \ninvestment  in  India\u2019s  energy  sector.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  also  support  private  sector \ndevelopment.  It  will  help  demonstrate  that  profitable  investments  are  achievable  in  the \nrenewable power subsector and, as such, will catalyze more private investments in renewable \nenergy.  \n \n2.  Outcome \n10.  The project outcome is addition of renewable energy capacity efficiently operated by the \nprivate sector. The project is expected to generate and sell at least 1,226 gigawatt-hours of \nelectricity annually and avoid approximately 956,280 tons of carbon dioxide annually from 2015 \nonwards.3 The project will also add local employment and tax revenues. \n \n                                                \n2 United Nations Development Programme. 2000.

The average plant load factor is assumed to be \n25% and India\u2019s electricity emission factor to be 0.78. \n ", "  3 \n3.  Outputs \n11.  The  project  output  is  the  development  and  commissioning  of  at  least  560  MW  of \nadditional wind power capacity by 2015. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n12.  The project is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2020.4 It relates to two of the five core \nspecializations of ADB: infrastructure and environment. In particular, the strategy calls for ADB's \nsupport  for  clean  energy  development  to  meet  growing  energy  demands  in  a  sustainable \nmanner. The project will also contribute to ADB\u2019s operational goal of scaling up private sector \ndevelopment  and  private  sector  operations.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  India  country \npartnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017,  which  calls  for  \u201cinvestments  in  renewable  energy \ndevelopment.\u201d5 \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n13.  The project is fully aligned with ADB's Energy Policy.6 The policy states that support for \nrenewable energy projects will be prioritized and broadened. To this end, ADB has set the target \nof promoting clean energy investments of more than $2 billion annually and that support to the \nprojects will contribute to this target. The policy emphasizes private sector participation as a tool \nto  enhance  energy  sector  efficiency  by  introducing  increased  competition  and  increased \ninvestable resources.  \n  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  The energy sector in India is regulated and administered through a multiministerial structure. \nframework  The CERC is the central regulator. Individual states have a state ministry of power as well as \nSERCs. Renewable energy policies are embedded in the framework of the Electricity Act, 2003; \nthe National Electricity Policy, 2005; and the National Tariff Policy, 2006 (and as amended in \nDecember 2010). The regulatory environment in India for the renewable energy subsector is \nunder  continuous  development  and  aims  to  encourage  further  significant  private  sector \ninvestments. \nManagement  The management team comprises experts in wind power development, engineering, corporate \nfinance, investment banking, and accounting, each individual having a minimum of 10 years of \nexperience in their respective fields. \nImplementation  June 2014\u2013December 2015 \nperiod \nConstruction arrangements \nType of  Majority of the capacity has been developed under competitively bid, date-certain, fixed-price \narrangement  turnkey arrangements. As ReNew\u2019s team has gained more experience, the company has also \ngone into self-development to reduce costs.  \nPower generation  Power generation equipment deployed for existing and under-development projects has been \nequipment  procured on a competitive basis and is world class, suitable to the local wind and weather \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2008.

The equipment suppliers include various international and national wind turbine \nsuppliers all with successful operational track records in India. \nCivil works  Civil works for the balance of the plant (including construction of common facilities, control \nrooms,  and  access  roads)  are  normally  subcontracted  to  local  contractors  who  are \ncompetitively selected and have sufficient wind-farm-related civil works experience. \nTransmission  Power evacuation facilities are made available by the respective state transmission companies \nlines  once capacity has been booked and allocated, while short connection lines are either part of the \nEPC contract or subcontracted out in case of self-development. \nOperation arrangements \nRevenue structure  The majority of ReNew\u2019s operational and under-construction wind power projects have entered \ninto  long-term  PPAs  with  state  utilities  ranging  from  10  to  25  years  with  varying  tariffs \ndepending on the respective state offtakers.  \nOperation and  In line with the prevailing industry practice in India and elsewhere, operation and maintenance \nmaintenance  of the wind power projects is outsourced to external contractors under a term contract (normally \n10 years).  \nPerformance  Key performance indicators will be reported on by ReNew and monitored by ADB. \nmonitoring   \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  CERC  =  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission;  EPC  =  engineering, \nprocurement, and construction; MW = megawatt; PPA = power purchase agreement; SERC = state electricity \nregulatory commission.  \nSource: ReNew Power Ventures Private Limited. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n15.  ADB will invest up to the Indian rupee equivalent of $50 million in ReNew in the form of \ncommon equity shares to partially fund the company\u2019s equity injection in the pipeline projects. \nADB will sign a shareholder agreement with the company and other shareholders. ADB will \nhave the right to appoint a director on the company\u2019s board. The equity investment has been \nstructured to provide further growth capital to ReNew to expand its asset base.  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n16.  ADB\u2019s participation provides the growth capital for ReNew which it requires to develop \nthe necessary scale to make a material difference in meeting India\u2019s renewable energy needs. \nWhile GSW is a strong investor, ReNew is looking to have additional investors as the company \nexpands  its  asset  base  and  requires  more  capital.  ADB\u2019s  investment  suits  this  objective. \nFurther, supporting a renewable energy developer with growth capital, as opposed to single \nproject financing, is a way to achieve greater leverage of ADB\u2019s funds and greater development \nimpact in terms of capacity addition. ADB\u2019s presence is also catalytic as it allows ReNew to \nsuccessfully raise capital from other sources and eventually through an IPO where ADB\u2019s \npresence sends a very strong positive signal. \n \n17.  ADB not only provides the growth capital but also allows ReNew to achieve its growth in \nan environmentally and socially responsible manner by adopting ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. \nHaving ADB as a shareholder enables ReNew to tap into ADB\u2019s extensive network, knowledge, \nand experience in the field of renewable energy, especially in India where ADB has keen \nunderstanding of the country\u2019s renewable energy needs and has played an important role from \nboth  the  policy  and  project  perspective.  The  project  will  be  an  example  of  ADB  offering \n ", "  5 \n\u201cfinance++\u201d, where ADB provides equity (\u201cown finance\u201d) with co-investors (\u201cleveraging resource \nthrough partnership\u201d), and also provides knowledge to its partners.7 \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n18.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory  B  for  environment.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  subprojects  are \ngenerally  site-specific, reversible,  and  mostly  associated  with  construction  activities. These \ntypically  include  land  clearing  for  site  preparation  and  access  roads,  transportation  of \ncomponents  and  materials,  excavation  and  construction  of  foundations,  and  installation  of \nequipment. Issues may potentially include occupational and community health and safety, visual \nintrusion, noise and vibration, soil erosion, and threats to bird and bat populations. Effective \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  will  be \nincorporated in the initial environmental examination reports and environmental management \nplans.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB  requirements.  Since the  equity  investment  is  considered  as general \ncorporate finance, a corporate audit was conducted on ReNew\u2019s current environmental and \nsocial  management  system  (ESMS)  and  its  past  and  current  performance  against  the \nobjectives,  principles,  and  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  audit \nincluded an assessment of ReNew\u2019s environmental and social safeguard management capacity \nto address the risks and impacts of its business operations, and its compliance record with the \napplicable laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \n19.  While ReNew has existing environmental and social policies and procedures, these are \nmainly  established  to  address  national  requirements  and  are  not  fully  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguards and social requirements. Hence, ReNew will develop a new ESMS that will (i) \nintegrate existing ReNew\u2019s environmental and social policies with new ESMS; (ii) establish a \nscreening,  categorization,  safeguard  planning,  and  review  procedure;  (iii)  enhance  the \norganizational structure and staffing to manage environmental and social safeguards concerns; \n(iv) conduct continual training and capacity-building activities; and (v) expand monitoring and \nreporting regimes. ReNew will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, ensure that \ninvestments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, comply with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  establish  and  maintain  an  appropriate  ESMS \nsatisfactory to ADB before subscription of the equity. \n \n20.  The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for \nindigenous peoples. Land acquisition for wind farms in India commonly includes the three land \ntypes of (i) forest land under the management of the central government, (ii) revenue land under \nthe management of state governments, and (iii) private land. ReNew or its contractors will lease \nland for the first two land types directly from the respective central or state governments; private \nland use is based on negotiated land acquisition. Land acquisition requirements are anticipated \nto be modest. In the unlikely event of land acquisition and involuntary resettlement, the required \nprocedures for screening and preparation of resettlement plans (in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement) will apply. The audit also noted that there are no scheduled tribes \nresiding  in  the  subproject  locations.  Effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and \ncompensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  as  well  as  procedures  and  policy  for  screening  and \n                                                \n7   ADB. 2013.

The institutional capacity and commitment of ReNew to manage the project\u2019s social \nand environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n21.  The project is classified as having no gender elements. Opportunities for creating jobs \nfor women may be limited as the work will be conducted in remote locations. Additionally, \ncertain jobs may require skills that women may not currently have because of the traditional \ngender segregation of the labor market in India. ReNew has implemented corporate social \nresponsibility  activities  for  the  schools  and  local  communities  and  will  ensure  that  these \nactivities include services and support that meet the needs of local women. ReNew will comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and report regularly to ADB on compliance (including that \nof contractors) with national labor laws and adherence to internationally recognized core labor \nstandards. 8 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n22.  ReNew was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Assurances \n23.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance  to  ReNew.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of \nDirectors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n24.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity  investment  of  up  to  the  Indian  rupee  equivalent  of  $50,000,000  to  ReNew  Power \nVentures Private Limited for the ReNew Power Investment Project in India from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n24 April 2014\n                                                \n8 ADB. 2003.
