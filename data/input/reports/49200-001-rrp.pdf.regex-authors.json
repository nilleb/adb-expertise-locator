I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof  up  to  $75,000,000  (or  its  yuan  equivalent)  to  Yingda  International  Leasing  (YIL)  for \nHealthcare Finance in Underdeveloped Regions of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1  \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  The rapid economic development in the PRC over the past few decades has been \naccompanied by a significant rise in healthcare expenditure. However, healthcare expenditures \nlag behind global averages. When the Reform and Opening policy started in 1978, healthcare \nspending was equivalent to 3.0% of gross domestic product. This share has since increased, to \n5.6% in 2013, but it is still well below the global average of 8.7%.2 Over the same period, basic \nhealth insurance in the PRC has been greatly expanded. In urban areas, the Urban Employee \nBasic  Medical  Insurance  System,  funded  via  a  payroll  tax,  was  established  in  1998  with \nmunicipality-level risk pooling. Urban residents not covered by this insurance system have \naccess to the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance program, which was piloted in 2007 and \nlaunched in all municipalities nationwide in 2009. This insurance system provides voluntary \ncoverage for students, children, the elderly, and other groups requiring social aid (e.g., the poor \nand disabled). The Rural Cooperative Medical System, which is government-subsidized health \ninsurance for rural people, was launched in 2002 and covers most of the rural population. By \n2011, more than 1.3 billion people, or 95% of the population, participated in one of these three \nbasic national health insurance programs.3   \n \n3.  The PRC has a decentralized system of healthcare finance, which has led to wide \nregional  and  urban\u2013rural  disparities  in  quality  and  access  to  healthcare.  Poorer  provinces \nreceive  some  financial  support  from  the  central  government.  Such  support  is  nonetheless \ninadequate and there are still large differences in healthcare spending. As a result, healthcare \nfacilities are poorer in the less-developed central and western regions. According to the latest \nstatistics  published  by  the  Ministry  of  Health,  in  2012  there  were  2.96  hospital  beds  per \nthousand people in the central region 3.10 beds per thousand people in the western region, and \n3.17 beds per thousand people in the eastern region.4 In the central region, the average assets \nper hospital were CNY79.9 million, and in the western region CNY68.9 million, both significantly \nlower than the average of CNY122.6 million in the eastern region. In the eastern region, there \nwere 1.36 advanced class III hospitals per million people, compared with 1.10 in both the central \nand western regions.5 The urban\u2013rural disparity is even more striking. In 2012, the per capita \n                                                \n1   The proceeds of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan will be used to finance hospital facilities in the \nunderdeveloped central and western regions of the PRC, as defined in the Central and Western Regions Priority \nIndustries  for  Foreign  Investors  (2013  Revision),  promulgated  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission and Ministry of Commerce. The proposed loan will predominantly finance public hospitals located in \ncounties where rural residents account for the majority of the population, while the rest will finance public \nhospitals located in low-tier cities in the target region. \n2    World Health Organization. 2015.

Beijing.  \n5   Hospitals are categorized into three classes based on their size, facilities, and performance. Class III hospitals are \nlarge hospitals with more than 500 beds and they usually provide high-level, specialized medical services and \nmay also carry out medical education and scientific research. \n ", "2 \nhealth expenditure in urban areas was CNY2,969 per annum, which was almost three times the \nrural per capita health expenditure of CNY1,056 per annum. \n \n4.  As an incentive for developing rural and urban grassroots healthcare institutions, the \ngovernment has prioritized the development of county hospitals, which can provide treatment for \n90% of common diseases and some severe diseases with complications, rehabilitation needs, \nand emergency care. The government is also implementing a public hospital reform program, \nwhich seeks to move away from the practice of cross-subsidizing medical treatments from the \nprofits generated from the markup of medicine sales, which could be up to 15% of the costs of \nmedicines. The government will continue to increase health expenditure at a higher rate than \nthe general government current expenditure. Much of the budget increase is being used for the \nexpansion  of  two  government-subsidized  medical  insurance  schemes  (the  Urban  Resident \nBasic Medical Insurance program and the Rural Cooperative Medical System), which account \nfor a growing share of hospital revenues. According to an early study by McKinsey, payout from \nthe  three  public  health  insurance  schemes  (including  the  Urban  Employee  Basic  Medical \nInsurance program funded by a payroll tax) made up around 60% of hospitals\u2019 total revenues, \nand the share is expected to increase further.6 Ultimately, the current and capital expenditures \nof public hospitals will be fully covered by direct fee payments, payouts from medical insurance, \nand government subsidies without contribution from medicine sales. \n    \n5.  To improve the facilities and standards of the public hospitals in the underdeveloped \nregions, it is critical that these hospitals also have access to competitive longer-term finance. To \nmeet the needs of procuring high-value medical equipment and making fixed-asset investments, \nhospitals  have  found  leasing  effective.  However,  the  financial  leasing  industry  also  faces \nsignificant capacity constraints. The industry is still in the early stages of development, despite \nrapid growth in recent years. According to the latest Global Leasing Report, market penetration \nin the PRC was only 3.1% in 2013, compared with an average rate of 20.8% in the world\u2019s 10 \nother largest financial leasing markets.7 While the legal and regulatory constraints are gradually \nbeing addressed, funding remains a challenge for most leasing companies because of the lack \nof deposit bases and the scarcity of longer-tenor loans.  \n \n6.  YIL  was  identified  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  as  a  strong  partner  for \nsupporting healthcare finance in the central and western regions of the PRC. The company has \na long track record and a large portfolio in healthcare leasing, which primarily focuses on the \nunderdeveloped regions. The majority of the company\u2019s clients in the health sector are key \npublic hospitals at county level. YIL has strong shareholders, good corporate governance, an \nexperienced  management  team,  advanced  risk  management  systems,  and  good  financial \nperformance. Similar to many leasing companies, the bulk of YIL\u2019s funding is short term (1 \nyear). The company is therefore seeking to access longer-tenor finance to expand its healthcare \nleasing business, where the typical lease term is 5 years, thus improving its asset\u2013liability \nprofile. ADB\u2019s proposed loan will help to address this aim. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \n8.

Market penetration is defined as the ratio of lease \nfinance over all fixed investment in plant and equipment. For a sector overview, refer to Sector Overview \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  ", "  3 \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n9.  Ownership. As noted, YIL is jointly owned by State Grid and General Electric. State \nGrid is fully owned by the Government of the PRC. As the sole operator of the bulk of the PRC\u2019s \npower transmission and distribution networks, its operations cover 88% of the national territory \nand serve more than 1.1 billion people. It is rated Aa3 by Moody\u2019s and AA\u2013 by Standard & \nPoor\u2019s. State Grid invested in YIL through its fully owned financial arm, State Grid Yingda \nInternational  Holdings  Group,  whose  business  covers  insurance,  securities,  and  asset \nmanagement. YIL is expected to remain the sole leasing platform for the State Grid group. \nGeneral Electric is a globally diversified technology and financial company with A1 rating from \nMoody\u2019s and AA+ rating from Standard & Poor\u2019s. General Electric invested in YIL through a \nsubsidiary of GE Capital, an experienced specialty lender in the mid-market segment. After \nrecently deciding to downsize GE Capital, General Electric has confirmed its commitment to \nYIL, which is closely aligned with General Electric\u2019s industrial business line and will remain the \ncompany\u2019s sole leasing platform in the PRC.8 \n \n10.

The Assistance \n \n16.  ADB will provide a senior unsecured term loan to YIL of up to $75 million (or its yuan \nequivalent). The tenor of the loan will be up to 5 years from the date of the first disbursement of \nthe loan. A portion of the risk on ADB\u2019s loan may be transferred to counterparties that are \neligible under ADB\u2019s policies.9  \n \n17.  The proceeds of the ADB loan will be used to finance hospital facilities in the central and \nwestern regions of the PRC, where economic development and healthcare standards lag behind \nthe coastal regions. At least 60% of the hospitals financed under the proposed loan will be \ncounty hospitals, which primarily serve the local rural population, while the rest will be located in \n                                                \n8   Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9   The terms of the risk transfer arrangements, if any, will be endorsed by ADB\u2019s investment committee.  \n ", "4 \nlower-tier cities in the target region.10 The project will finance the lease or purchase of modern \nmedical equipment, as well as hospital fixed-asset investments (e.g., late-stage construction, \nexpansion or refurbishment of hospital buildings or associated medical facilities) through sale \nand leaseback transactions.11 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Legal  Documentation. The proposed loan will be governed by a credit agreement \nwhich will contain terms customary for a loan of this nature and amount.  \n \n19.  Monitoring. Monitoring of the project will be carried out by ADB. YIL will provide ADB \nwith financial and other reports at predetermined regular intervals and as requested. These \nreports will include (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis, (ii) audited financial \nstatements on an annual basis, (iii) compliance certificates for financial covenants on an annual \nbasis, (iv) semiannual reports on the underlying leases financed through the proposed loan, (v) \nannual reports on the implementation status of the  environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS), and (vi) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed on by \nADB and the borrower. \n \n20.  Evaluation. Pursuant to ADB\u2019s operations manual, Monitoring reports will be prepared \nand submitted to ADB regularly and at least annually.12 The first such report will be submitted no \nlater than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s loan to YIL will add value by helping to achieve the following: \n(i)  Promote  public\u2013private  cofinancing  for  healthcare  finance  and  improve \nhealthcare  services  in  underserved  regions.  With  payments  from  state-\nsponsored  medical  insurance  schemes  now  accounting for the  vast majority  of \nfinancial support from governments, public hospitals in the PRC have to rely more \non  commercial finance for  their  capital  expenditure  programs.  Financial  leasing \nprovides an effective financing solution to help public hospitals acquire high-value \nmedical  equipment  and  improve  their  medical  facilities.  Through  the  proposed \nproject,  ADB  will  promote  a  catalytic  public\u2013private  cofinancing  model  that  will \nsupport the PRC to improve its healthcare standard in underdeveloped regions and \nachieve its objective of providing universal access to basic health services to the \nentire population. \n(ii)  Provide critical long-term finance. YIL predominantly funds its operations through \nshort-term bank borrowings. Therefore, the long-term funding from ADB will help \nsupport the company\u2019s longer-tenor products in the healthcare industry and improve \nits asset\u2013liability profile. This will in turn increase the company\u2019s capacity to expand \nits operations, especially in the high impact and lower return areas. ADB\u2019s provision \nof critical long-term funding, which is not readily available to leasing companies, will \nhelp reduce YIL\u2019s dependence on short-term funding and reduce its refinancing risk.  \n                                                \n10  The proposed loan will not finance any hospital located in the provincial capital city itself; however, it may finance \nthose located in counties or county-level cities governed by the provincial capital.  \n11  Under a sale and leaseback transaction, the hospital sells its existing medical equipment to YIL and obtains the \nfinance in the form of sale proceeds. At the same time, it signs a financial lease contract with YIL to leaseback the \nequipment. The hospital may use the new finance from YIL for late-stage construction and completion work of \nnew hospital buildings. To minimize risks, YIL does not finance the construction of a new hospital or entire \nhospital building projects.  \n12  ADB. 2013. Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10. Manila. ", "  5 \n(iii)  Support finance sector development. The project will support the growth of a \nyounger  financial  leasing  company  and  alleviate  its  funding  constraint,  thus \nsupporting finance sector development and diversification. The proposed loan is \nalso  expected  to  boost  investor  confidence  in  YIL  and  support  its  future  bond \nissuance. By gradually diversifying funding sources from banks to securities markets, \nlarger leasing companies can start to tap capital markets, leading to wider impacts \nof finance sector development. \n \nD.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n24.  Impacts.  The  proposed  project  is  expected  to  have  strong  development  impacts, \nincluding the following:  \n(i)  Medical and health service system in the less-developed regions improved. \nThe project will improve the facilities of public hospitals in the underdeveloped \nregions,  thus  reducing  the  regional  disparity  in  healthcare  standards,  widening \naccess to quality healthcare, and allowing benefits from economic development to \nbe more equally shared among the population. With the Rural Cooperative Medical \nSystem now covering more than 95% of the rural population and reimbursing about \n80% of medical expenditures, improvement of local county hospitals becomes the \nkey for improving rural healthcare standards. By reducing the need for long-distance \ntravel to city hospitals, the improvement of county hospital facilities will directly \nbenefit the majority of the rural population in the local area, who are significantly \nunderserved by the healthcare system and whose average healthcare expenditure \nis only one-third that of their urban counterparts.   \n(ii)  Financial leasing industry development. By supporting the growth of a young \nfinancial leasing company, the project will also have the impact of financial leasing \nindustry development. Despite rapid growth in recent years, the PRC\u2019s financial \nleasing  industry  is  still  in  the  early  stages  of  development.  Access  to  finance \nremains a challenge for most leasing companies, particularly for longer-tenor loans, \nand the proposed project will contribute to the alleviation of this funding bottleneck.  \n \n25.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be the sustainable growth of YIL\u2019s healthcare \nleasing operations in underdeveloped regions of the PRC. The nonperforming assets for YIL\u2019s \nhealthcare and entire portfolio are expected to remain low.  \n \n26.  Outputs.  The outputs will be the following:  \n(i)  Expanded healthcare leasing operations of YIL in underdeveloped regions. \nThe share of YIL\u2019s hospital clients located in underdeveloped regions is expected to \nincrease from 70% in 2014 to 75% by 2016, and the share of its county hospital \nclients is expected to increase from 52% to 58% over the same period.  \n(ii)  Improvement of facilities and diagnostic and treatment capacity of hospitals \nin counties and low-tier cities in the less-developed regions. The project is \nexpected to finance the lease or purchase of modern medical equipment in 12 \n ", "6 \npublic hospitals and fixed-asset investments in six public hospitals in the target \nregions. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n27.  Consistency with ADB Strategy and Country Strategy. The project supports three \nstrategic priorities identified by the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: (i) poverty reduction and \ninclusive economic growth, (ii) middle-income countries, and (iii) private sector development and \noperations.13 The  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  highlights  ADB\u2019s  focus  on  reducing \nvulnerability and inequality, and sets the target of increasing health operations to 3%\u20135% of its \nannual approvals of financial assistance from 2% during 2008\u20132012. By financing hospitals in \ncounties and low-tier cities in underdeveloped regions, the proposed project will help address \ninequality in healthcare access and quality in the PRC. By promoting public\u2013private cofinancing, \nADB will provide a catalytic solution for healthcare finance in an upper-middle-income country. \nThe proposed project is also consistent with the PRC country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015, \nwhich emphasizes inclusive and sustainable growth and targeted interventions in the finance \nsector.14 It is aligned with the current PRC country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017, which \nprioritizes  promoting  balanced  development  of  rural  and  urban  areas,  supporting  catalytic \nnonsovereign projects, and private sector development.15  \n \n28.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations. The proposed \nproject is in line with ADB\u2019s latest operation plan for the health sector, which identifies health \nservice delivery as a focus and calls for more investment in strengthening the quality and \ncoverage of healthcare services.16 Furthermore, supporting finance sector development is a key \nfocus of development assistance for ADB. The proposed project builds upon previous support \nthat ADB has provided to the leasing industry in the PRC.17 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n29.  The project is classified category FI for impacts on the environment, and FI (treated as \nC) for impacts on both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The investment's \npotential environmental and social impacts, and its risks associated with YIL\u2019s existing and/or \nlikely future portfolio and commitment and capacity for environmental and social management, \nhave been assessed. Most of YIL\u2019s transactions under the loan will have minimal or no adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  and  are  unlikely  to  entail  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples since the project will only finance the lease or purchase of modern medical \nequipment as well as hospital fixed-asset investments (e.g., late-stage construction, expansion \nor  refurbishment  of  hospital  buildings  or  associated  medical  facilities)  through  sale  and \nleaseback transactions. The proposed project will not finance any subprojects that are category \nA for environment or category A or B for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. YIL \nwill (i) apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments using ADB \nfunds comply with applicable national laws and regulations, (iii) comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \n                                                \n13  ADB. 2014.

YIL  will  also  submit  an  annual \nenvironmental and social performance report on the status of its ESMS implementation.  \n \n30.  YIL\u2019s ESMS will include arrangements to comply with national labor laws and ADB\u2019s \nSocial  Protection  Strategy  to  ensure  adherence  to  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards  including  provisions  prohibiting  any  discrimination  against  women  in  hiring  and \nproviding equal pay for equal work for men and women.19 The project is expected to benefit all \npatients, including women, and therefore is classified as having no gender elements.20  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n31.  YIL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \nThe PRC is a jurisdiction in which no strategic deficiencies have been identified by the Financial \nAction Task Force, and no integrity red flag has been identified. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n32.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n33.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 21  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of the PRC has no objection to the proposed assistance to YIL. ADB will enter into \nsuitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval \nof the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$75,000,000 (or its yuan equivalent) to Yingda International Leasing for Healthcare Finance in \nUnderdeveloped  Regions  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n                                                \n18  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary; Financial \nIntermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n \n19  ADB. 2003.
