The solar park will site over 500 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaic \nand concentrated solar power plants.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIndia is bestowed with solar irradiation ranging from 4 to 7 kilowatt-hours (kWh)/square \nmeter/day across the country, with western and southern regions having higher solar incidence.2 \nWith rapid growing electricity demand, decreasing availability of land, and increasing reliance on \nimported sources of fossil fuel, India has initiated steps to develop the large potential for solar \nenergy-based  power  generation.  In  2010,  the  government  launched  the  Jawaharlal  Nehru \nNational Solar Mission (JNNSM) to facilitate extensive solar power development.3 Achieving the \nambitious  target  for  2022  of  20,000  MW  will  be  dependent  on  lessons  identified  during \nimplementation  of  the  first  two  phases,  which  if  successful  could  lead  to  conditions  of  grid-\ncompetitive  solar  power.  The  transition  to  mainstreaming  solar  energy  could  be  appropriately \nscaled  up  through  capacity  development  of  all  stakeholders  related  to  issues  of  technology, \nfinance,  project  management,  and  policy  development.  JNNSM  envisages  setting  up  utility-\nscale solar power generation plants through the promotion and establishment of solar parks with \ndedicated  infrastructure  by  state  governments,  including  the  governments  of  Gujarat  and \nRajasthan.  \n \n4. \nThe Government of Gujarat (GOG), taking advantage of the favorable policy regime and \nhigh  solar  irradiation  in  the  state,  launched  the  Solar  Power  Policy  in  2009  and  proposed  to \nestablish  a  number  of  large-scale  solar  parks  starting  with  the  Charanka  solar  park  in  Patan \ndistrict in the sparsely populated northern part of the state. The development of solar parks will \nstreamline  the  development  timeline  for  solar  power  generation  projects  with  government \nagencies  undertaking  land  acquisition  and  obtaining  necessary  permits,  as  well  as  providing \ncommon  infrastructure  necessary  to  set  up  such  power  generation  projects  plants.  Common \ninfrastructure  for  the  solar  park  includes  site  preparation  and  leveling,  construction  power, \npower  evacuation  and water  infrastructure,  access  roads, security,  and  related  services.    This \napproach  will  facilitate  the  accelerated  installation  of  solar  power  generation  capacity, \nparticularly  in  the  private  sector  and  reduce  costs  by  addressing  the  issues  faced  by  stand-\nalone projects. The Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) has announced a feed-\n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is for the project is in Appendix 1. \n2   In comparison, most of Europe receives 0.5 \u2013 4.0 kilowatt-hours/square meter/day  of solar energy. \n3   The  major  focus  of  JNNSM  is  to  (i)  create  an  enabling  policy  framework  for  deployment  of  20,000  MW  of  solar \npower by 2022; (ii) increase capacity of grid-connected solar power generation to 1,000 MW within 3 years in the \nfirst phase, i.e., by 2013, and an additional 3,000 MW by 2017 in the second phase through the mandatory use of \nthe  renewable  purchase  obligation  by  utilities  backed  with  a  preferential  tariff;  (iii)  deploy  20  million  solar  lighting \nsystems  for  rural  areas  by  2022;  and  (iv)  create  favorable  conditions  to  enhance  solar  manufacturing  capability, \nparticularly solar thermal for indigenous production and market leadership. \n\n\fin-tariff4 to mainstream solar power generation. Gujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL), the \nagency  responsible  for  developing  the  500  MW  solar  park,  will  lease  the  land  to  the  project \ndevelopers  to  generate solar  power.  Gujarat  Energy  Transmission  Corporation  (GETCO),  with \nthe mandate to develop transmission infrastructure in Gujarat, is one of the executing agencies \nfor the project and will develop the transmission evacuation from the identified interconnection \npoints  with  the  solar  developer.  The  developer  will  fund  the  connection  from  the  solar  power \nplant to the interconnection point.  \n \nIn  May  2010,  ADB  announced  the  Asia  Solar  Energy  Initiative  (ASEI)  to  catalyze  the \n5. \ndevelopment  of  3,000  MW  of  solar  power  generation  projects  from  2010  to  2013  in  ADB \ndeveloping  member  countries.  Under  the  ASEI,  ADB  is  taking  a  holistic  approach  under  the \nproject  to  catalyze  development  of  an  innovative  public\u2013private  partnership  model  of  a  \n500  MW  solar  park  (17%  of  the  ASEI  target)  through  its  public  and  private  sector  windows. \nADB,  through  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Integrated  Renewable  Energy  Development \nProject, 5  supported  the  development  of  commercial  agreements  between  solar  power \ndevelopers and power purchasers under JNNSM. ADB also processed a guarantee facility6 for \ncommercial banks to lend to private sector solar developers. In India, transmission expansion, \nand optimization has been an area of focus for ADB operations7 and through the development \nof this power evacuation line from the Charanka solar park, ADB will be able to facilitate private \nsector  participation  and  develop  a  model  that  can  be  replicated  to  scale  up  solar  power  in  a \nsignificant manner in India. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\nThe project's impact will be large-scale development of reliable solar power projects in a \n6. \ncost-effective  manner  in  India.  The  project  outcome  will  be  the  development  of  reliable  solar \npower transmission infrastructure for the successful operation of the solar park. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe physical outputs will be the procurement, installation, and commissioning of (i) one \n7. \n400/220/66  kilovolt  (kV)  substation  comprising  of \ntwo  315  megavolt  amperes  (MVA) \ntransformers  and  one  125  MVAR  bus  reactor,  (ii)  eight  100  MVA  transformers  at  220/66  kV \nvoltage level, (iii) a 66 kV underground cable grid of about 137 kilometers (km) within the solar \npark,  (iv)  about  110  km  of  400  kV  double  circuit  transmission  line  from  the  solar  park  to \nSankhari,  Patan  District,  Gujarat,  (v)  about  109  km  of  220  kV  double  circuit  transmission  line \nfrom the solar park to Jangral, Patan District, Gujarat and (vi) two feeder bays at the substations \nlocated at Sankhari and Jangral, Patan District, Gujarat. Nonphysical investment outputs include \nvocational  training  for  skilled  employment  for  up  to  300  people  with  at  least  30% women,  and \nenergy-based livelihood enhancement training to 100 women.8  \n\n                                                 \n4   Rs15.00/kWh  for  the  first  12  years  and  Rs5.00/kWh  from  year  13  to  25,  to  be  applied  for  solar  photovoltaic \noperation.

GETCO will also act as the implementing agency for the project. \nGOG will constitute a steering committee, chaired by the principal secretary of Gujarat\u2019s Energy \nand  Petrochemicals  Department.  The  committee  will  meet  every  quarter  to  (i)  promote  and \nfacilitate overall coordination between GETCO and other agencies and stakeholders to ensure \nsmooth  implementation  of  the  project;  and  (ii)  review  the  progress  and  achievements  of  the \nproject. GETCO will arrange monthly coordination meetings among developers in the solar park \nand other stakeholders. GETCO will be responsible for supervising project implementation and \nmonitoring  the  project\u2019s  operating  performance.  It  will  establish  a  project  management  unit \nheaded by a project director and supported by a project manager and specialists in substation \nimplementation;  engineering;  procurement  and  contract \nimplementation; \nmanagement;  finance  and  accounts;  and  environment,  social  safeguards,  right-of-way,  and \nsafety. \n \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \n12. \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

The  solar  park  has  been \nproposed with a mix of photovoltaic (with a range of 5\u201325 MW) and concentrated solar power \n(with  a  range  of  25\u201350  MW)  totaling  500  MW.  Technical  studies  undertaken  by  GPCL \nconcluded the best option to evacuate power from the interconnection points of the generation \nprojects to the substation in the solar park would be through 66 kV underground cables. As the \ntotal output from the solar park will ultimately be 500 MW, GETCO proposes to construct a 220 \nkV transmission line from the substation in the solar park to the existing Jangral substation and \na  400  kV  transmission  line  to  the  new  Sankhari  substation.  Both  transmission  lines  will  be \ndouble circuit and the routing is been designed to maintain adequate system reliability. However, \nthe  interconnection  aspects  between  the  solar  power  plants  and  the  main  electrical  grid  will \nneed  to  be  carefully  assessed.  The  ADB  TA\u2014Integrated  Renewable  Energy  Development \nProject\u2014is  undertaking  this  needs  assessment  (footnote  5).  In  addition,  a  TA 11  has  been \napproved  for  a  detailed  system  study  and  a  joint  pilot  study  is  being  explored  with  the \nInternational Smart Grid Action Network. GETCO is to install special modular equipment in the \nADB-financed substation. In addition, ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Program would carry out studies to \nreview potential to secure carbon credits from clean power generation in the solar park.12 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nFinancial  analysis  of  the  project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial \n14. \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (footnote  8).  All  financial  costs  and  benefits  are \nexpressed at constant 2010 prices. Financial viability was assessed by comparing the project\u2019s \nincremental  costs  and  benefits.  The  calculation  of  incremental  benefits  is  based  on  GETCO\u2019s \nrevenue  stream  and  currently  applicable  GERC  regulations.  Costs  used  to  determine  the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  include  capital  investments,  operation  and  maintenance  costs, \nand taxes incurred to install and operate the project.  \n \nThe financial internal rate of return is 8.8%, which compares favorably with the estimated \n15. \ncost of capital at 1.4%, indicating that the project will be financially viable. Sensitivity analyses \nshows  that  the  results  are  robust  to  a  range  of  project-related  sensitivities  covering  a  10% \nincrease in capital cost, 10% increase in operation and maintenance costs, and a 1-year delay \nin project execution.13  \n \n16. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  using  the  systems  approach,  taking  the  solar \npark and transmission line together. Benefits considered include consumer benefits, prevented \nclimate change benefits, and prevented local air pollution benefits. The local air pollution costs \nwere incorporated using the benefit transfer method. The renewable energy certificate price for \nsolar was used as a proxy for the climate change benefits. Incremental costs and benefits were \nconsidered  in  estimating  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  13.4%  in  the  base  case.  The \nsensitivity analysis shows that the project\u2019s rate of return is stable against changes in relevant \nparameters, i.e., 10% increase of costs, reduction in renewable energy certificate price and 1-\nyear delay of project implementation.   \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2011.

In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  project  will  be  subject  to  prior  ADB  approval  and  will \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe executing agencies and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the project. GOG will ensure that GETCO and other associated power entities \nhave operating autonomy and no organizational changes are carried out that would affect their \nability  to  perform  their  obligations  under  the  project.  In  addition,  financial  management  and \nprocurement  capacity  assessments  were  completed.  GETCO  will  maintain  separate  accounts \nfor the project and its operations.

The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n\n \nPoverty, Social, and Gender  \n\nD. \n\n19. \nIn Gujarat, industry and services sectors constitute over 80% of the state\u2019s net domestic \nproduct  and  have  maintained  high  growth  rates  of  over  10%  in  recent  years  resulting  in  a \nsignificant  growth  in  electricity  demand.  The  power  subsector  plays  a  key  role  to  economic \ndevelopment and social well-being. The project is consistent with the poverty reduction strategy \nunder  India\u2019s  11th  Five  Year  Plan  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India.  While \nGujarat enjoys high household electrification (more than 95%) and diversified industrial activity \nmaking it one of the richest states in India, areas adjacent to the project are prone to poor basic \ninfrastructure, primarily sanitation and water supply systems; and economic activity and growth \ndue to a lack of income-generating opportunities and wider access to markets. A socioeconomic \nand poverty assessment was carried out in communities along the transmission lines and in the \nvicinity  of  the  proposed  solar  park.  Overall,  villages  are  characterized  by  their  remoteness, \nsubsistence-based  economies,  and  often  by  inhospitable  living  conditions  due  to  extreme \nweather  conditions  and  generalized  scarcity  of  water.  Host  communities  are  primarily  rural, \nagriculture-based (irrigated and non-irrigated) with relatively high incidence of poverty (less than \n$1  per  day),  illiteracy,  and  poor  standards  of  living  and  well-being  (as  noted  in  the \nsocioeconomic  analysis 14 ).  A  gender  action  plan  was  prepared  for  the  project. 15  The  loan \nagreement  includes  a confirmation  from  the  executing  agency  to  implement  the  gender  action \nplan as designed.   \n \n20. \nTo  alleviate  some  of  the  challenges  and  constraints  that  perpetrate  poverty  and  social \nexclusion in the area, the project incorporates a selected number of value added interventions \ndesigned  to  enhance  and  meet  a  range  of  varied  basic  but  specific  needs  across  targeted \npopulations  in  the  project  area.  Interventions  combine  project-specific  outcomes  (e.g.,  local \njobs)  with  associated  outputs  conceived  specifically  to  complement  and  support  the  loan.  All \ninterventions  are  gender \nthe \nempowerment of women in decision-making roles and by enabling them to actively participate in \nemployment, skills training (education), and energy-based alternative livelihoods.  \n\nto  promote  gender  equality \n\ninclusive  and  aim \n\nthrough \n\n \n21. \nPro-poor,  socially  inclusive,  and  gender  equitable  and  enhancing  activities  associated \nwith the project include (i) the generation of a significant number of local jobs requiring different \nskill sets;16 they will have a direct socioeconomic impact on host communities and contribute to \nimproved livelihoods; (ii) provision of skilled vocational training to local people (30% women) to \nfill the labor demands created from the development of the solar park and transmission project; \n(iii) provision of livelihood energy-based skills training for up to 100 poor women in target areas \nin  the  project  area  of  influence;  (iv)  as  part  of  GETCO\u2019s  corporate  social  responsibility,  the \nexecuting agency will invest for the provision of basic infrastructure improvements in Charanka \nvillage, where sanitation, water supply systems, and street lighting have been identified to be of \nparticular  need.  The  partnership  will  support  and  enhance  the  outputs  of  the  ADB  loan, \nparticularly by improving the quality of life of villagers who will also benefit from local jobs, and \nvocational  and  livelihood  skills  training.  Though  not  financed  by  the  loan,  the  results  will  be \nmonitored and reported in the project performance monitoring system. Activities listed under (ii) \n                                                 \n14  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 According to feasibility estimates prepared by GPCL for the solar park project, over 1,000 jobs will be created as a \n\nresult of the solar park project alone.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nand  (iii)  fall  under  an  approved  TA  (footnote  7).    The  TA  will  offer  vocational  training  and \nlivelihood  enhancement  opportunities  in  Patan  district  with  the  objective  of  generating  (i)  a \nqualified labor force to meet the employment demands of the proposed solar park development \nprojects, and (ii) empower the roles and increase the incomes of poor local women. The TA will \nhave a gender focus and enhance the project by qualifying it for effective gender mainstreaming \nstatus. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy prepared for the project notes that the \nproject  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  locally  and  in  the  region  through  (i)  the  creation  of \ntemporary and permanent jobs; (ii) public and private sector economic investment and growth; \n(iii)  improvements  to  local  basic  infrastructure,  including  roads,  sanitation,  and  water  supplies; \n(iv)  provision  of  skilled  and  unskilled  employment;  (v)  capacity  development  training;  and  (vi) \ngender mainstreaming interventions.17  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n22. \nThe  assessment  of  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  transmission  indicates  the \nproject is to be classified as category B for environment, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  A  draft  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  transmission \nsubprojects was prepared.18 Draft environmental management plans (EMPs) were prepared and \ninformal  public  consultations  carried  out  along  the  transmission  corridor.  The  results  indicate \nbroad  support  for  the  project  based  on  perceived  economic  and  social  benefits.  Most  impacts \nare  expected  to  occur  during  construction  and  are  deemed  as  temporary  and  reversible  in \nnature.  The  transmission  corridor  was  carefully  selected  after  undergoing  an  options \nassessment.  This  enabled  the  right-of-way  alignment  to  bypass  nearby  sensitive  ecological \nareas, villages, and important water supplies and resources. The main environmental impacts of \nthe  project  will  be  the  clearing  of  shrub  vegetation,  waste  management,  and  excavation  and \nmovement of soil. From this perspective, the project is expected to have a small environmental \nfootprint.  No  endangered  or  protected  species  of  flora  or  fauna  are  reported  at  any  of  the \nsubproject  sites.  The  substation  sites  are  located  on  land  owned  by  GOG,  characterized  as \nmostly  barren,  uninhabited,  and  unused  lands,  removed  from  populated  areas.  An  EMP  with \nspecific management, mitigation, and monitoring activities and measures was prepared for the \nproject. Adverse impacts will be mitigated using appropriate design and management measures \nand through the provision of fair compensation for the loss of physical and/or productive assets. \nMitigation  measures  related  to  construction,  as  specified  in  the  EMP,  will  be  incorporated  into \ncivil  works  contracts,  the  implementation  of  which  will  be  the  primary  responsibility  of  the \ncontractors.  GETCO  will,  however,  be  responsible  for  overseeing  overall  implementation  and \nauditing  of  the  site-specific  EMP.  The  National  Environment  Engineering  Research  Institute \nprepared a rapid environmental impact assessment, as per GOG norms.19  \n \n23. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  a  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  per  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The transmission component will not require land acquisition. The \nland  identified  for  the  three  substations  (Charanka,  Jangral,  and  Sankhari)  is  government-\nowned  wasteland,  hence  no  permanent  land  acquisition  or  displacement  will  be  required  for \nthese  facilities.  A  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  the  project  with  specific  provisions  and \nentitlements for compensating affected people, although presently only minimal and temporary \n\n                                                 \n17 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Development of the solar park will follow the EMP requirements of the environmental impact assessment, per local \ngovernment environmental laws and regulations acceptable to ADB. ADB assessed the documents and recognized \nthat  the  proposed  action  is  relevant  for  additional  provisions  for  development  of  buffer  zones  to  eliminate  any \nimpact  on  the  wild  ass  in  the  wildlife  sanctuary  located  in  the  northern  end  of  the  park  (10  km  from  the  project \nboundary). \n\n\fimpacts, such as temporary loss of crops and/or trees, are expected. According to site surveys, \nno households headed by women or vulnerable groups such as scheduled tribes will be directly \naffected by the project. GETCO will review and update the RP based on the finalized detailed \ndesign  of  the  transmission  lines  and  in  case  of  any  impact  on  land  and  structures,  the  same \nwould  be  included  in  the  updated  RP.  In  the  event  of  unforeseen  adverse  impacts  on  these, \nassistance will be taken up on a case-by-case basis per the entitlements, eligibility criteria, and \ncompensation  identified  in  the  project  resettlement  plan.  Gender  considerations,  specifically \ngender equitable consultation, compensation, and the impact on households headed by women, \nare also considered in the resettlement plan. The plan complies with national laws and ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. GPCL is preparing a separate resettlement plan for the solar park \ncomponent; it is consistent with ADB requirements. No indigenous peoples are expected to be \naffected. This is reflected in the category C classification for indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n24. \nThe  two  major  risks  are  (i)  possible  uncoordinated  development  of  the  solar  power \ngeneration plants and the associated transmission system; and (ii) possible instability of the grid \nin terms of frequency, current, and voltage due to large-scale solar generation at a single point. \nThe  government  will  establish  a  steering  committee  with  senior  representatives  from  GOG, \nGPCL,  and  GETCO;  and  representatives  of  the  project  developers 20  to  review  project \nimplementation and ensure coordinated development of the park, the power plants, and power \nevacuation system. A coordination committee mechanism will also be set up. Under the ASEI, \nADB  has  been  actively  facilitating  private  sector  participation  in  the  solar  park  taking  a \nsystematic  approach.21 Recognizing  comparative  advantages  to  locate  solar  power  generation \nplants  in  the  solar  park  rather  than  outside,  project  developers  have  entered  into  leasing \nagreements  and  power  purchase  agreements  for  over  200  MW,  40%  of  the  total  expected \ninstalled capacity of the solar park while several developers are in final stages of entering into \nsuch contracts. The first unit may be commissioned before completion of the transmission line. \nIn such a case, GETCO will be prepared to provide an evacuation solution using the temporary \nline  for  construction  power  to  the  solar  park.  Further,  possible  instability  of  the  grid  due  to \ninconsistent voltage and frequency needs to be examined in detail and ways identified to ensure \nuninterrupted  grid  management.  GETCO  recognizes  the  need  to  install  specialized  equipment \nbetween the solar power plants and the main electrical grid. A TA has been approved is being \nprepared for detailed system study and a joint pilot study is being explored with the International \nSmart Grid Action Network (para. 13). \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n \n\nRisks \nPossible uncoordinated development of the solar \npower generation plants and the transmission \nsystem \n\nMitigating Measures \nA steering committee to be established comprising \nrepresentatives of GOG, GPCL, GETCO, and other \nstakeholders to ensure that the transmission facility \nis developed. \n \nA coordination committee comprising \nrepresentatives from GETCO and solar plant \n\n                                                 \n20 In view of the substantial investments made, GOG is committed to solar power development in the state. Penalty \n\nclauses in the power purchase agreements will require developers to adhere to the agreed schedule. \n\n21 Workshops  were jointly held by ADB and GOG in December 2010 in Tokyo, Japan at the second meeting of the \nAsia  Solar  Energy  Forum  and  in  January  2011  in  Gujarat,  India  inviting  financiers  and,  technology  providers  to \ndiscuss financial, technology, and capacity development aspects. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nPossible instability of the grid in terms of frequency, \ncurrent, and voltage due to large-scale solar \ngeneration at a single point  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\ndevelopers to meet regularly to manage \nimplementation coordination. \n \nPPA and land lease agreements already signed for \nover 200 MW and other applications being \nprocessed.  \n \nThe Asia Solar Energy Forum facilitates \ncommunication between government agencies and \nsolar power park developers. \nGETCO is to conduct technical studies with ADB \nsupport. \n \nInternational best practices through the \nInternational Smart Grid Action Network.  \n \nGETCO (with ADB TA) is to undertake suitable \ncountermeasures and/or technical solutions as \nidentified under the ADB-funded TA.
