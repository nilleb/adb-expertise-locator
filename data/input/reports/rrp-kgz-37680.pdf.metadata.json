An initial environmental examination for \nall subprojects will be undertaken during project implementation. \n \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  public  infrastructure  damaged  by \nsevere  landslides  and  floods  during  the  spring  and  summer  of \n2003.  The  affected  infrastructure  includes  (i)  roads  and  bridges, \n(ii) power distribution lines, and (iii) schools. The Project will also \nprovide  municipal  infrastructure  in  two  resettlement  centers  that \nthe Government is establishing for disaster-affected people. \n \nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Rehabilitation \nAssistance  After  Disasters.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  help  the \nGovernment  cope  with \nthe \ncountry\u2019s  constrained  fiscal  situation.  The  Project  will  assist  in \nrehabilitating  damaged  public  infrastructure,  and  ensure  that \nnatural disasters do not disrupt social and economic development \nin project areas. \n \nThe immediate purpose of the Project is to assist the Government \nto restore economic and social activity quickly in the communities \nof  four  oblasts  (provinces)  struck  by  landslides  and  floods  by \nrehabilitating damaged public infrastructure. The long-term goal of \nthe  Project  is  to  help  sustain  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction in the country. The Project comprises four components: \n \nRoads  and  bridges.  Rehabilitating  five  damaged  roads  and \nrebuilding ten damaged bridges in the oblasts of Chui, Issyk-Kul, \nJalal-Abad, and Osh.  \n \nElectricity.  Rehabilitating  and  rebuilding  about  21  kilometers  on \nfour  damaged  power  distribution  lines,  as  well  as  replacing  three \nelectrical transformer stations in the oblasts of Chui and Osh. \n \nSchools.  Building  four  schools  and  providing  furniture  and \nfacilities  in  areas  less  prone  to  natural  disasters  in  the  oblasts  of \nChui and Osh. \n \nMunicipal  Infrastructure.  Building  municipal  infrastructure  (on-\nsite  roads,  power  lines,  water  supply,  and  drainage  systems)  in \ntwo  permanent  resettlement  centers  that  the  Government  is \nestablishing for disaster-affected people in Osh. \n\n \n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n \n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjectives and Scope  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A \n\n \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\nis  estimated \n\n \nThe  Project \nto  cost  $6.3  million  equivalent, \ncomprising  $3.8  million  (59.8%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$2.5 million equivalent (40.2%) in local currency cost.  \n \n \n\nSource \n\n \nAsian Development \nBank  \nGovernment \n        Total \n\nForeign \nExchange  \n\n3,754 \n\n0 \n3,754 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nLocal \nCurrency  \n($\u2019000) \n1,246 \n\n \n\n1,275 \n2,521 \n\n \n \n\nTotal  \n\nPercent \n\n5,000 \n\n1,275 \n6,275 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n80 \n\n20 \n100 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nloan \n\nin  various  currencies  equivalent \n\nto  SDR3,492,000  \n($5  million  equivalent)  will  be  provided  from  the  Special  Funds \nresources  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  loan  will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with \nan interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 30 September 2007 \n \n31 March 2007 \n\n \nMinistry of Ecology and Emergency Situations (MEES) \n \nThere  will  be  two  implementing  agencies  for  the  Project:  MEES \nand  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC). \nMEES will be responsible for implementing school and municipal \ninfrastructure subprojects, while MOTC will handle implementation \nof  roads,  bridges,  and  electricity  subprojects.  There  will  be  two \nproject \nimplementation  units  (PIUs).  The  Government  will \nestablish  a  new  PIU  in  MEES  and  will  use  the  existing  PIU  in \nMOTC  under \nthe  ADB-funded  Road  Rehabilitation  Project.  \nPIUs  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project  coordination  and \nimplementation.  A  project  steering  committee,  comprising \nrepresentatives  of  concerned  government  ministries  and \nagencies,  will  be  established \nto  supervise  overall  project \nimplementation. \n \nAdvance  action  on  procurement  for  civil  works  has  been \napproved.  Retroactive  financing  has  also  been  approved  for \neligible  expenses  incurred  and  paid  from  8  September  2003  (the \nfirst  day  of  ADB\u2019s  fact-finding  mission)  until  loan  effectiveness, \nsubject  to  a  maximum  amount  of  $1.0  million  equivalent  and  the \nBoard approval of the proposed loan. All ADB-financed goods and \n\n\f \n\niii \n\nservices  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement through local competitive bidding for civil works and \ndirect purchase for equipment. \n \nA  total  of  136  person-months of consulting services, comprising \n12  person-months  of  international  and  124  person-months  of \ndomestic  consultants,  will  be  provided  to  help  implement  the \nProject.  Consultants  will  help  project  management,  detailed \ndesign reviews, quality control, preparation of bidding documents, \nbid  evaluation,  construction  supervision,  and  environmental  and \nsocial  impact  monitoring.  Consultants  will  be  engaged according \nto  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  disaster-affected  communities  in \nfour  oblasts  by  rehabilitating  and  rebuilding  roads  and  bridges, \nrestoring  power  supply,  renewing  access  to  education,  and \nbuilding  municipal  infrastructure  for  the  Kurshab-1  and  Dubitel \npermanent resettlement centers that the Government is setting up \nfor  affected  people.  More  than  128,000  people  in  78  villages  are \nexpected  to  benefit  from  the  Project.  The  Project  will  benefit  the \npoor  because  the  majority  of  the  population  living  in  disaster-\naffected areas is poor.  \n \nThe  Project \nthere  might  be \nimplementation delays because of MEES\u2019 limited capacity. Project \nconsultants  will  assist  MEES \nimplementation. \nAdvance  action  on  procurement,  retroactive  financing,  and  the \nadoption of local competitive bidding and direct purchase will help \nreduce  the  risk  of  delayed  procurement.  Second,  construction \nsupervision  may  be  inadequate  because  the  Project  covers \nseveral sectors and relatively small subprojects over a widespread \narea.  This  risk  would  be  mitigated  through  adequate  consulting \nservices. Third, counterpart funds may not be provided in a timely \nmanner. ADB will work closely with the Government to ensure that \nsufficient  counterpart  resources  are  allocated  on  a  timely  basis. \nADB  financing  for  part  of  the  local  currency  cost  would  alleviate \nthis  risk.  Fourth,  fresh  landslides  and  floods  may  damage \ncompleted  project  works.  This  risk  would  be  mitigated  through \ncareful  design  and  new  alignments  to  avoid  areas  at  high  risk  of \nfuture  landslides  and  floods.  During  implementation,  ADB  will \ncoordinate  closely  with  the  World  Bank,  which  will  help  the \nGovernment develop disaster prevention measures.  \n \n\nin  managing \n\nrisks.

Floods and landslides are major concerns \nbecause  of  monsoon  rains,  seismic  activity,  steep  slopes,  fragile  soils,  and  human  action.  \nSuch  natural  disasters  would  cause  damage  to  inhabitants  and  physical  infrastructure,  thus \nposing a threat to the country\u2019s economic and social development. Effective response to natural \ndisasters to minimize the damage is one of the major challenges faced by the country. \n \nRoads. The country is landlocked, and road transport accounts for about 94% of freight \n3. \nmovement and almost all passenger traffic. The country\u2019s road network covers all seven oblasts \n(provinces),  and  provides  connections  to  far-flung  communities  and  neighboring  countries.   \nThe  road  network  comprises  about  18,900  kilometers  (km)  of  roads:  9,900  km  of  state  roads \nand 9,000 km of local roads, about 40% of which are sealed, 50% gravel, and 10% earth. Traffic \nhas  fallen  substantially  since  1991  because  of  economic  contraction  following  the  breakup  of \nthe  former  Soviet  Union,  although  the  transport  recovered  somewhat  after  1995.  In  2001 \npassenger  and  freight  turnovers  accounted  for  57%  and  20%  of  their  respective  1990  levels.2 \nThe  Government  has  made  substantial  efforts  in  road  sector  reform.  All  29  road construction \nenterprises and 74 of 86 road transport service providers were privatized. Most national holding \ncompanies that had exercised control over transport operations were abolished. The market for \nfreight  transport  services  is  becoming  increasingly  competitive.  However,  the  Government \ncontinues  to  exert  strong  influence  over  intercity  passenger  transport  and  play  a  large  role  in \nfreight  transport  through  its  holdings  in  joint-stock  companies  and  its  regulation  capacity.  \nThe existing  road  network  is  adequate  for  the  country\u2019s  development  needs;  the major sector \nissue  is  proper  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  to  preserve  the  existing  network.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  actively  providing  assistance  to  improve  road  sector \nperformance.3 \n \n4. \nElectricity.  The  country  has  a  large  hydroelectric  potential  with  more  than  163,000 \ngigawatt-hours  (GWh)  per  year,  of  which  less  than  10%  is  presently  exploited.  Primary \nelectricity production from hydropower accounts for more than 80% of the total energy output. \nThe  country  is  a  net  exporter  of  electricity.  In  2002,  it  generated  14,750  GWh  compared  with \ndomestic  consumption  of  11,500  GWh,  with  about  10%  of  annual  production  exported  to \nneighboring countries. Following the split of the power monopoly, Kyrgyzenergo in 2001, there \nare  six  power  sector  comprises:  one  generation  company  (JSC  Generation  Stations),  one \ntransmission  company  (JSC  National  Grid),  and  four  distribution  companies  operating  in  the \noblasts of Chui and Talas, Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Naryn and Issy-Kul, respectively. About 98% of \nthe  population  is  connected  to  the  power  grid.  The  Government  has  initiated  power  sector \nreform.  The  Energy  Law  was  enacted  to  provide  a  framework  for  sector  regulation  and \n                                                 \n1  The appendix on sector analysis is excluded due to the urgency of processing this Project. \n2  World  Bank.  2003.  Public  Expenditure  Review:  Fiscal  Policies  for  Growth  and  Poverty  Reduction.  Vol.  2. \n\n3  ADB has provided four loans totaling $145 million and seven TA grants with a total amount of $4.2 million to the \n\nWashington D.C. \n\nroad sector. \n\n \n\n\frestructuring,  and  power  tariffs  were  raised  from  0.6  cents/kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  in  1999  to  1.3 \ncents/kWh in 2002, with a view to bring the average tariff on par with the estimated long-term \naverage cost of 2.3 cent/kWh by 2005. However, the sector faces some major problems: (i) a \nhigh  quasi-fiscal  deficit  because  of  technical  and  commercial  losses,  as  well  as  low  revenue \ncollection; and (ii) a rapid deterioration of facilities because of a lack of funds for operation and \nmaintenance. There is also a need to adopt an effective social protection scheme to mitigate the \nimpact of tariff increases on the poor. ADB has worked closely with the World Bank, which has \nplayed  a  coordinating  role  among  the  donors  in  supporting  energy  sector  reform  and \nrehabilitating the power system.4  \n \n5. \nEducation.  The  Kyrgyz  education  system  comprises  five  principal  levels  of  education \nand  is  based  on  the  former  Soviet  system.  Government  statistics  indicate  that  the  gross \nenrollment ratio for primary education is 97.5% in 1998, with virtually identical rates for boys and \ngirls. School enrollment and educational quality have deteriorated over the past decade due to \nthe decline in income, depleted stocks of textbooks and other learning materials, an underpaid \nteaching  force,  and  physical  deterioration  of  schools.  Although  the  Ministry  of  Education  and \nCulture  (MOEC)  only  reports  2,500  children  out  of  school  in  2001,  independent  estimates \nsuggest far higher figures.5 About 40% of respondent school children failed a literacy test in a \nrecent  survey  conducted  by  the  United  Nations.  Education  sector  reform  has  been  pursued \nsince  1992  with  the  promulgation  of  the  Education  Law.  Major  measures  adopted  include   \n(i) new curriculum, textbooks, and learning materials; (ii) stronger pupil assessment and teacher \ntraining;  (iii)  delegated  responsibility  for  management  and  financing  of  primary  and  secondary \nschools  to  local  bodies;  and  (iv)  upgraded  and  rehabilitated  facilities  and  equipment.  \nThe Government has recently developed a concept paper for education development to 2010, \nproviding  the  key  policy  and  strategic  framework  for  education.  Nevertheless,  the  sector \nexperiences  several  main  problems:  rising  inequalities  in  access  to,  and  declining  quality  of, \neducation  services;  low  teacher  motivation  due  to  low  salaries;  and  shortcomings  in  the \ndelegation of responsibilities for primary and secondary schools to local bodies.  ADB has been \nthe  main  source  of  external  assistance  to  the  education  sector  since  the  country\u2019s \nindependence in 1991.6 \n \n6. \nThe country is experiencing severe fiscal and debt constraints, due to the accumulation \nof  the  public  sector  budget  deficits  during  1993- 1996  and  the  large  devaluation  of  the  som \nfollowing  the  Russian  financial  crisis  during  1997- 1998.  At  the  end  of  2002,  the  country\u2019s \nexternal  debt  stock  was  equivalent  to  about  $1.8  billion  (111%  of  gross  domestic  product \n[GDP]),  of  which  about  $1.6  billion  were  public  or  government-guaranteed  loans.7  The  large \nexternal  debt  has  become  an  excessive  burden  on  the  fiscal  system,  severely  restricted the \nGovernment\u2019s  capacity  to  borrow  abroad,  and  limited  its  ability  to  effectively  respond  to \nemergency needs with its own resources.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1996.

The  Government\u2019s  meteorological  records  show  that \nrainfall in the oblasts of Jalal-Abad and Osh from March- June 2003 was on average about 50% \nhigher than in normal years (Table 1), and over 30 millimeters (mm) of precipitation fell in a one-\nhour  period  in  Chui  oblast  on  21  June  2003,  a  record  high.  Rivers  and  streams  broke  their \nbanks under the increased water volume and silt load. Torrential rains also triggered landslides \nbecause soils were saturated by the rains and slid down steep slopes. About 1,000 landslides \noccurred during the first eight months of 2003, compared with an average of 15- 20 landslides \nduring the similar period in a normal year. \n \n\nTable 1: Rainfalls in Osh and Jalad-Abad Oblasts (March-June 2003)  \nCompared with Normal Years  \n(%)  \n\n \nArea \n\nMarch \n\nApril \n\n2003 \nMay \n\nJune \n\nAverage \n(March-June) \n \n\n147.9 \n223.0 \n218.9 \n198.2 \n157.5 \n134.7 \n\n \n164.4 \n106.1 \n168.0 \n121.1 \n111.3 \n107.5 \n\n \n171.3 \n277.0 \n273.6 \n183.6 \n237.2 \n234.7 \n\n \n110.7 \n198.8 \n170.0 \n152.4 \n127.3 \n120.5 \n\n \n145.2 \n310.8 \n263.8 \n335.5 \n154.1 \n  76.1 \n\nOsh Oblast \n   Ak-Terek  \n   Batken \n   Kara-Suu \n   Nookat \n   Uzgen  \nJalal-Abad Oblast \nSource: Ministry of Ecology and Emergency Situations.  \n \nThe landslides and floods of 2003 have caused the country\u2019s worst damage since 1994. \n8. \nAccording  to  the  Government,  43  people  were  killed,  1,088  families  lost  their  houses,  around \n6,000  hectares  of  agricultural  land  were  damaged,  and  more  than  300,000  people  were \naffected.  Total  damage  cost  more  than  Som566  million  ($13.5  million),  almost  1%  of  GDP. \nNatural  disasters  also  destroyed  or  severely  damaged  roads,  bridges,  power  lines,  irrigation \nfacilities,  schools,  and  hospitals.  An  assessment  of  the  damage  to  roads,  bridges,  power \ndistribution facilities, and schools is provided below. \n \nRoads and bridges. About 55.5 km of roads and 21 bridges were destroyed or severely \n9. \ndamaged. The damage was particularly serious in the oblasts of Chui, Jalal-Abad, and Osh. In \nOsh, huge landslides buried parts of the Kurshab-Jalpaktash asphalt road and the PAD-Budalyk \ngravel  road,  and  significantly  damaged  the  Chalma-Buyga road. In Chui, mudslides destroyed \nthree  bridges  and  about  2  km  of  the  Natural  Park  Ala-Archa road. Floods also washed away \nnumerous sections of the Barpy-Yrisuu-Changent road in Jalal-Abad, and destroyed the bridges \non the Ilichevka-Erkintoo road in Osh and the Sovetskaya-Syrzavod road in Issyk-Kul. \n \nElectricity. About 57 km of 35-, 10-, and 0.4-kilovolt (kV) power lines and nine electrical \n10. \ntransformer  stations  were  damaged  in  Chui  and  Osh  oblasts.  In  the  Uzgen  district  of  Osh, \nlandslides  and  mudslides  buried  the  35-kV  Uzgen-Zerger  and  Mirza-Aki-Salamalik  overhead \nlines and several 10-kV overhead lines. Floods and mudslides also partly destroyed the 10-kV \nGulcha-Sopu-Korgon  overhead  line  in  Alay  district,  and  damaged  several  10-  and  0.4-kV \noverhead lines and transformer stations in the districts of Karasuu, Chon-Alay, and Ksara-Kulja. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIn Chui, eight 35- and 10-kV lines and three transformer stations were seriously damaged by the \nmudslides. Many communities lacked electricity.  \n \n11. \nSchools.  Thirty-two  schools  were  destroyed  or  damaged,  particularly  in  the  oblasts  of \nChui,  Jalal-Abad,  and  Osh.  A  number  of  school  buildings  collapsed,  while  others  severely \ndeteriorated as a result of heavy rains: the foundations of the buildings subsided and the walls \nare  saturated  with  serious  cracks.  The  Ministry  of  Ecology  and  Emergency  Situations  (MEES) \nhas  declared  these  school  buildings  \u201cunsafe\u201d,  and  ordered  them  to  be  vacated.  Currently, \nchildren  are  studying  in  tents  or  other  temporary  locations  such  as  kindergartens,  with \novercrowded and unheated classrooms. Because some  damaged schools are located in areas \nat high risk of future landslides and floods, new schools need to be built in safer areas. \n \nDamage  to  public  infrastructure  severely  disrupted  economic  activity  and  social  life  in \n12. \naffected  communities.  The  destruction  of  roads  and  bridges  isolated  thousands  of  people  and \nhampered  their  access  to  food,  drinking  water,  electricity,  medical  supplies,  education,  and \nhealth care. Some temporary roads have been formed and electricity restored using makeshift \npower  lines,  but  these  are  vulnerable  and  even  rainfall  can  destroy  them.  As  the  new  school \nyear  began  in  September  and  winter  has  set  in,  damage  to  schools  has  disrupted  normal \nlearning and caused significant stress to children, teachers, and parents. There is an immediate \nneed  to  rehabilitate  and  rebuild  damaged  infrastructure  so  as  to  restore economic and social \nactivity in disaster-affected communities.  \n \n13. \nThe Government responded actively in the aftermath of the natural disasters. On 13 May \n2003 the Government issued a resolution (No. 277) for urgent relief operations, and it has since \nmobilized its forces or contractors to restore essential services in affected areas. As of the end \nof August 2003, a total amount of Som174.1 million (about $4 million) had been allocated from \nthe  state  budget  to  government  ministries  and  agencies  to  support  relief  and  rehabilitation. \nThe Government also provided grants of Som379,000 (about $9,000) per household for victims \nof  the  most  disastrous  landslide  in  the  Kara-Taryk  village  of  Osh.8  The  Government  also \nextended long-term, interest-free credit9 of up to Som200,000 ($4,700) to each of other affected \nfamilies  to  help  relocate  them  to  safer  areas  and  allocated  land  for  permanent  resettlement \ncenters. MEES is building two new resettlement centers (Kurshab-1 Resettlement Center10 and \nDubitel  Resettlement  Center11)  in  Osh  with  government  funding  and  it  plans  to  build  a  third \n(Kurshab-2  Resettlement  Center12).  Because  of  the  country\u2019s  severe  fiscal  constraints,  the \nGovernment  has  the  limited  capacity  to  respond  to  the  natural  disasters  and  has  therefore \nrequested emergency assistance from the international community. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  The largest landslide occurred in the village of Kara-Taryk, Uzgen district of Osh on 20 April 2003. The landslide \n\ndevastated the village and killed 38 people.  \n\n9  The loans have a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 2 to 3 years.   \n10 The Kurshab-1 Resettlement Center has a total area of 5 hectares and is being built for 51 families affected by the \nmost disastrous landslide in the Kara-Taryk village. The center is located 25 km from Kara-Taryk village.12 families \nthat  lost  parents  or  most  of  their  property  were  provided  houses  free  of  charge,  while  the  remaining  39  families \nreceived  interest-free  loans  to  build  houses.  17  houses  have  been  completed  and  16  houses  are  under \nconstruction. \n\n11 The Dubitel Resettlement Center has a total area of 18 hectares and is being established for 55 affected families \nfrom Dubitel and Changet villages, 5- 10 km away. Four houses have been completed and 26 houses are under \nconstruction. \n\n12 The Kurshab-2 Permanent Resettlement Center is planned for 178 affected families to be relocated from the Aral \nand Ak-Terek areas, 55 km away. The Center has a total area of about 15 hectares and will be developed in two \nphases. \n\n4\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nThere is an urgent need for ADB to help the Government cope with the natural disasters, \n14. \nespecially given its constrained fiscal situation. Such assistance is consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy \non Rehabilitation Assistance After Disasters and would enable the Kyrgyz Republic to continue \nits  development  expenditures  that  otherwise  would  have  been  reallocated  for  disaster \nrehabilitation.  In recognition of this, ADB fielded a fact-finding mission from 8 to 19 September \n2003 following receipt of the Government\u2019s request for emergency assistance. The mission held \ndiscussions  with  the  central  and  concerned  local  governments,  affected  communities, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other donor agencies. It also assessed the damage \nto public infrastructure. Based on the findings and understanding reached with the Government, \nthe  mission  prepared  an  emergency  rehabilitation  project  for  possible  ADB  support.  The \nproposed loan is within the limits on the country\u2019s public investment program required under the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s poverty reduction and growth facility.  \n \n15. \nExternal Assistance and Aid Coordination. Other international aid agencies have also \nresponded to the country\u2019s natural disasters. The United Nations and the United States Agency \nfor International Development extended grants of $30,000 and $50,000, respectively, mainly in \nthe  form  of  food,  medicine,  tents,  and  blankets.  Japan,  the  European  Commission,  and  the \nSwitzerland are providing grant assistance to strengthen the capacity of the central and selected \nlocal  governments  as  well  as  local  communities  to  monitor,  predict,  and  handle  disasters. \nThe  World  Bank  plans  to  reallocate  $3  million  from  an  ongoing  irrigation  loan  project  to \nrehabilitate  damaged  irrigation  facilities,  and  has  programmed  a  $5  million  natural  disaster \nmitigation  project  for  2004  to  help  develop  a  program  to  address  key  natural  resource  and \nenvironmental risks, including the impact of rock slides on uranium tailings stored in the Mailuu \nSuu area. There has been close coordination between ADB and the World Bank in response to \nthe  Government\u2019s  request  for  emergency  assistance.  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  experience  in \ninfrastructure and the World Bank\u2019s involvement in the irrigation sector, it was agreed that ADB \nassistance would cover roads, bridges, power lines, schools, and municipal infrastructure while \nthe  World  Bank  would  rehabilitate  damaged  irrigation  facilities  and  help  address  disaster \nprevention issues.  \n \n16. \nLessons Learned. There are several important lessons learned from ADB operations in \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  First,  the  Government\u2019s  institutional  capacity  is  generally  limited  by  the \nfrequent  changes  in  staff,  shortages  of  managerial  and  technical  skills  in  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies,  as  well  as  their  limited  familiarity  with  ADB\u2019s  operational  policies  and \nprocedures. This has often led to delays in procurement, slow disbursements, and poor quality \nof  work.  Capacity  building  should  be  an  integral  part  of  ADB\u2019s  lending  assistance.  Second, \ninadequate  counterpart  funding  has  recently  affected  ADB\u2019s  portfolio.  The  Government\u2019s \nbudgetary constraints and deficiency in its fiscal management system are the major factors, and \nthese factors have resulted in implementation delays. Counterpart funding for individual projects \nneeds close, regular monitoring.  \n \n17. \nADB\u2019s  previous  emergency  assistance  loans,  particularly  the  Flood  Emergency \nRehabilitation  Project  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,13  the  Emergency  Flood  Rehabilitation  Project14 \nand  the  Emergency  Baipaza  Landslide  Stabilization  Project  for  Tajikistan,15  have  provided  a \nnumber of useful lessons. First, a strong government commitment to rehabilitation is essential to \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fthe  success  of  emergency  assistance  projects.  Second,  capacity  building  at  executing  and \nimplementing agencies is badly needed because their limited institutional capacity has been the \nmajor  factor  in  implementation  delays.  Third,  consulting  services  are  needed  to  ensure \nadequate  construction  supervision  and  project  quality,  given  limited  government  capacity. \nFourth, special attention should be paid to counterpart funding, as inadequate counterpart funds \nhave  affected  the  smooth  project  implementation.  These  lessons  have  been  incorporated into \nthe project design. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe immediate purpose of the Project is to assist the Government to restore economic \n18. \nand social activity quickly in the communities of four oblasts struck by landslides and floods by \nrehabilitating damaged public infrastructure. The long-term goal of the Project is to help sustain \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  country.  The  project  areas  cover  the  oblasts  of \nChui, Issyk-Kul, Jalal-Abad, and Osh. A project framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe Project comprises the following four components, the details of which are given in \n\n19. \nAppendix 2: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nRoads  and  bridges.  Rehabilitating  five  damaged  roads  and  rebuilding  ten \ndamaged  bridges.  The  roads  to  be  rehabilitated  are  the  Natural  Park  Ala-Archa \nroad in Chui; the Kurshab-Jalpaktash, PAD-Budalyk, and Chalma-Buyga roads in \nOsh;  and  the  Barpy-Yrissu-Changent  road  in  Jalal-Abad.  Four  bridges  on  the \nBarpy-Yrissu-Changent road, three on the Natural  Park  Ala-Archa road, and one \nIllichevka-Erkintoo,  Chalma-Buyga,  and  Sovetskaya-\nbridge  each  on \nSyrzavod roads will be rebuilt.  \n\nthe \n\nElectricity.  Rehabilitating  and  rebuilding  about  21  km  on  four  damaged  power \ndistribution lines in Chui and Osh. Four damaged lines are (a) the 35-kV  Uzgen-\nZerger  line,  (b)  the  35-kV  Mirza-Aki-Salamalik  line,  (c)  the  10-kV  Gulcha-Sopu-\nKorgon line, and (d) the 10-kV Ala Archa-25 Years of Kyrgyzstan Substation line. \nThree  damaged  transformer  stations  located  along  the  Ala  Archa-25  Years  of \nKyrgyzstan Substation line will be replaced. \n\n(iii) \n\nSchools.  Building  four  schools  in  areas  less  prone  to  natural  disasters  in  the \noblasts of Chui and Osh, including furniture and facilities. \n\n(iv)  Municipal Infrastructure.  Building municipal infrastructure in the Kurshab-1 and \nDubitel  permanent  resettlement  centers  in  Osh,  which  the  Government  is \nestablishing  for  disaster-affected people. Municipal infrastructure includes about \n4.3 km of on-site roads, 8.6 km of power lines, two electric substations, 4.3 km of \nwater supply network, and about 1 km of drains. \n\n \n20. \nThe  Project  comprises  19  infrastructure  subprojects,  which  have  been  selected  from  a \nlong list of 52 subprojects provided by the Government, based on priorities established by the \nGovernment and agreed upon by ADB. The major selection criteria are the severity of damage \nand the impact of damaged infrastructure on the affected communities.  \n\n6\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7\n\nThe project components and output will be achieved through civil works, procurement of \nfor  project  management,  detailed  design  review, \n\n21. \nequipment,  and  consulting  services \nconstruction supervision, quality control, and social and environmental impact monitoring. \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n22. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $6.3  million  equivalent,  comprising  $3.8  million \n(59.8%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $2.5  million  equivalent  (40.2%)  in  local  currency  cost.   \nThe  cost  estimates  include  physical  and  price  contingencies,  as  well  as  taxes  and  duties.  \nA summary of cost estimates is in Table 2 and detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 3. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Project Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nForeign \nExchange Cost \n\nTotal  \nProject Cost \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n1,578 \n206 \n802 \n\nA.

The  provision  of  local  cost \nfinancing is justified due to the Government\u2019s severe budgetary constraints and the urgency of \nthe  Project.  The  Government  will  meet  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $1.3  million \nequivalent,  or  20%  of  the  total  project  cost.  Government  financing  will  cover  other  local \nexpenditures including taxes and duties. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Borrower will be the Kyrgyz Republic.

MEES will be the executing agency for the Project and will be responsible for oversight \nand coordination of implementation. A vice minister of MEES will be appointed project director \nresponsible  for  implementation.  To  ensure  close  interagency  coordination  and  effective \nimplementation,  the  executing  agency  will  be  assisted  by  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC), \ntwo implementing agencies, and two project implementation units (PIUs). \n \n25. \nPSC  will  be  established  at  the  central  government  level  to  supervise  overall  project \nimplementation. PSC will be chaired by the finance minister and will comprise representatives of \nconcerned  government  agencies,  including the prime minister\u2019s office, MEES, MOEC, Ministry \nthe  State  Committee  on  State  Property \nof  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC), \nManagement  and  Attraction  of  Direct  Investment,  and  project  oblast  governments.  PSC  will \nmeet  on  a  quarterly  basis  to  review  progress  and  provide  guidance,  as  necessary,  on \nimplementation. An organization chart of project implementation is provided in Appendix 4. \n \n26. \nThere will be two implementing agencies for the Project: MEES and MOTC. MEES will \nbe  responsible  for implementing municipal infrastructure and school subprojects, while MOTC \nwill handle roads, bridges, and electricity subprojects.  \n \n27. \nThere will be two PIUs, one each at MEES and MOTC. The Government will establish a \nnew  PIU  in  MEES,  and  will  use  the  existing  PIU  in  MOTC  under  the  ADB-funded  Road \nRehabilitation  Project.  PIUs  are  responsible \nfor  day-to-day  project  coordination  and \nimplementation.  In  consultation  with  project  oblast  governments,  NGOs,  and  affected \ncommunities,  PIUs  will  coordinate  key  project  implementation  activities  such  as  detailed \nengineering design reviews, preparation of bidding documents, evaluation of bids, awarding of \ncontracts, construction supervision, clearance of environmental examinations, and monitoring of \nimplementation.  A  fulltime  project  manager  will  head  each  PIU,  and  will  assist  the  project \ndirector for implementation.  \n \n28. \nDue  to  the  urgency  of  the  Project,  the  Government  has  undertaken  design  works  for \nmost of the subprojects. In addition to the technical viability of the Project, two major issues will \nneed to be taken into account during detailed design. First, emphasis will be placed on disaster \nprevention  because  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters.  Since  the World \nBank and other donors will help the Government develop  natural disaster prevention measures, \nADB  will  incorporate  their  disaster  prevention  proposals  into  project  design  as  much  as \npossible.  Second,  special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  analysis  of  alternatives  and  least-cost \nsolutions. Project consultants will review detailed designs and provide guidance, if necessary, to \n\n8\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nthe  executing  agency,  implementing  agencies,  and  PIUs  to  ensure  that  the  design  of  all \nsubprojects is based on least-cost options, addresses rehabilitation needs, and meets medium-\nterm requirements of disaster prevention.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n29. \nThe Project will be implemented over 3 years, with the Project expected to commence in \nMarch 2004 and end by March 2007. A project implementation schedule is given in Appendix 5. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n30. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  out  of  the  proposed  loan  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Because civil works contracts \nwill  be  small  and  scattered, and domestic contractors are capable of undertaking such works, \nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB will be followed. Equipment for schools, \nvalued  at  about  $185,000  equivalent,  will  be  procured  by  direct  purchase.  Contract  packages \nare provided in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n\nADB has approved the Government\u2019s request for (i) advance action on procurement for \n31. \ncivil  works,  and  (ii)  retroactive  financing  for  eligible  expenses  incurred  and  paid  from  \n8  September  2003  (the  first  day  of  ADB\u2019s  fact-finding  mission)  until  loan  effectiveness,  and \nsubject  to  a  maximum  amount  of  $1.0  million  equivalent  (20%  of  the  proposed  loan)  and  the \nBoard  approval  of  the  proposed  loan.  These  actions  are  required  to  expedite  implementation. \nThe  Government  will  carefully  check  related  documents  for  retroactive  financing  before  these \ndocuments  are  submitted  to  ADB.  The  Government  was  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of \nadvance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n32. \nThe  Project  will  require  136  person-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  \n12  person-months  of  international  and  124  person-months  of  domestic  consultants,  to  assist \nimplementation,  including  detailed  design  reviews,  quality  control,  preparation  of  bidding \ndocuments,  bid  evaluation,  construction  supervision,  and  environmental  and  social  impact \nmonitoring.  One  international  consultant  as  project  advisor/civil  engineer  will  be  engaged  for  \n12  person-months  to  (i)  ensure  the  smooth  and  speedy  start-up  of  project  implementation,   \n(ii) oversee quality of project documentation, and (iii) provide guidance and training to PIU staff \non  implementation  matters.  The  service  of  the  international  consultant  will  be  provided \nintermittently  over  a  3-year  period.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  assess  the  need  for \nadditional  consulting  services  during  project  reviews.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  of  domestic  consultants.  In  consultation  with  ADB,  the \nimplementing agencies will recruit the international consultant, while the international consultant \nwill  assist  the  implementing  agencies  in  recruiting  domestic  consultants.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for consultants are provided in Appendix 7. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n33. \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook. To expedite loan disbursement, the Government will open an imprest account in a \n\n \n\n\fcommercial  bank  agreed  by  ADB  after  loan  effectiveness  with  an  initial  deposit  of  $500,000 \nequivalent.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. ADB\u2019s \nstatement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures \nand  liquidating  advances  provided  into  the  imprest  account.  Any  individual  payments  to  be \nreimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n34. \nPIUs will maintain separate accounts for the Project. However, these will be coordinated \nand  consolidated  by  MEES,  which  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  financial  statements \naccording to international accounting standards for review by independent auditors acceptable \nto  ADB.  MEES  will  submit  certified  copies  of  the  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements to ADB within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. The auditing services may be \nfinanced out of the proceeds of the proposed loan. \n \n35.  MEES  will  provide  quarterly  reports  to  ADB  on  progress  made  and  problems \nencountered  during  the  period  under  review,  the  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the \nproblems, and the proposed activities and expected progress during the following period. MEES \nwill submit environmental status reports to ADB twice a year during implementation. Before the \nconstruction of the ADB-financed subprojects in the two resettlements sites, MEES will prepare \nand  submit  to  ADB  a  resettlement  framework  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement and  Handbook  on  Resettlement.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion of the \nProject,  MEES  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  that  provides  details  about \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nEach implementing agency will undertake performance monitoring for each subproject to \n36. \nevaluate the delivery and quality of the planned outputs, inputs, activities, and project benefits \nindicated  in  the  project  framework.  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  each  implementing \nagency,  with  assistance  of  project  consultants,  will  develop  a  comprehensive  project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS) according to ADB\u2019s standards and submit it to ADB for \nreview. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n37. \nADB  will  field  a  project  inception  mission  shortly  after  loan  approval  to  initiate  the \nimplementation process, and will conduct project reviews of the overall progress of the Project \nat  least  twice  per  year.  If  the  results  of  project  reviews  indicate  serious  implementation \nproblems,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  agree  on  appropriate  mitigation  measures,  including \nchanges in the scope of implementation arrangements, to ensure the realization of the project \nobjectives. The Government and ADB will jointly carry out a comprehensive midterm review in \n2005. The  midterm  review  will  assess  (i)  implementation  status,  (ii)  design  and  construction \nstandards,  (iii)  physical  progress  and  disbursements  made  against  the  implementation \nschedule, (iv) performance of consultants and contractors, (v) social and environmental  impact \nmonitoring  results,  (vi)  status  of  compliance  with  the  covenants  stipulated  in  the  loan \nagreement, and (vii) the need for any additional works or changes in the project scope. \n \n\n10\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  disaster-affected  communities  in  four  oblasts  of  the \n38. \nKyrgyz  Republic.  The  project\u2019s  social  and  economic  benefits  include  rehabilitating  and \nrebuilding  damaged  roads  and  bridges,  restoring  disrupted  power  supply,  building  schools  in \nless  disaster-prone  areas,  and  providing  municipal  infrastructure  in  permanent  resettlement \ncenters  that  the  Government  is  setting  up  for  disaster-affected  people.  More  than  128,000 \npeople living in 78 villages will benefit. The Project will particularly benefit the poor because the \nmajority of the population in disaster-affected areas is poor: the average poverty incidence for \nthe four project oblasts is 44%. A proposal for grant assistance from the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction  is  being  processed  separately  to  help  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  the  poor \ncommunities in disaster-affected areas. From a long-term perspective, the Project will contribute \nto achieving sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction in the country. \n \nThe Project is designed to rehabilitate damaged public infrastructure in affected areas in \n39. \nthe  shortest  possible  time.  Given  the  relatively  small  size  of  individual  subprojects,  project \nbenefits  are  not  quantified.  Nevertheless,  the  Project  is  strongly  justified  because  it  will help \nrestore social and economic activity in disaster-affected communities. \n \nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n40. \nThe  Project  will  help  bring  social  and  economic  life  back  to  normal  in  disaster-affected \ncommunities. The rehabilitation of the damaged roads, bridges, and power lines will contribute \nto restoring the supply and distribution networks for basic goods and services. The construction \nof  four  schools  will  help  the  affected  children  regain  access  to  education.  Municipal \ninfrastructure  (e.g.,  on-site  roads,  power  and  water  supply,  and  the  drainage  system)  in  the \nKurshab-1  and  Dubitel  permanent  resettlement  centers  will  provide  a  sustainable  living \nenvironment  for  the  affected  families.  The  poor  living  in  the  remote  areas  will  benefit  directly \nfrom the Project because they are most affected by damaged infrastructure and disrupted social \nservices.  \n \n41.  While in principle ADB's safeguard policies apply to emergency projects, the urgency of \nthis  Project  requires  fast-track  processing,  and  therefore  justifies  procedural  and  timing \nflexibility.  An  initial  social  assessment  was  conducted  for  all  project  components.  A  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is provided in Appendix 8. \n \nThe  Project  does  not  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  because  components \n42. \ninvolve  rehabilitating \ninfrastructure  within  existing  rights-of-way  or  building  municipal \ninfrastructure  within  the  new  resettlement  sites  that  are  the  State  property.  Some  106 \nhouseholds  in  the  villages  of  Kara-Taryk,  Dubitel,  and  Changet  in  Osh,  whose  houses  were \ndestroyed, are living in locations that the Government considers at high risk of future floods and \nlandslides.  The  Government  has  allocated  23  hectares  of  land  for  the  Kurshab-1 and Dubitel \npermanent resettlement centers in the same Uzgen district for voluntary resettlement of these \naffected families (see footnotes 10 and 11). The Government has also provided grants or long-\nterm, interest-free loans to help them rebuild houses at the resettlement sites. The Project will \nprovide  municipal  infrastructure  in  these  two  sites.  The  fact-finding  mission\u2019s  preliminary \nassessment  shows  that  relocation  to  these  two  centers  is  voluntary,  and  that  both  project \nbeneficiaries and host communities at the two sites are Kyrgyz. While there were no agricultural \nactivities previously undertaken at the site of the Dubitel Permanent Resettlement Center, about \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n1.85  hectares  at  the  Kurshab-1  Permanent  Resettlement  Center  had  once  been  agricultural \nland.  The  Government  has  paid  a  total  of  Som18,492  (about  $440)  to  the  affected  host \ncommunity ($235 per hectare), based on average annual output value. The affected host people \nare  generally  satisfied  with  the  compensation.  Prior  to  the  construction  of  the  ADB-financed \nsubprojects in these two resettlements sites, a domestic consultant will conduct due diligence to \nassess  whether  the  affected  host  people  were  adequately  compensated  and  the  families \nalready relocated did so on a voluntary basis. The consultant will also assist MEES to prepare a \nresettlement  framework  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  social  safeguard  policies,  and  implement \nmitigation  measures  as  required.  ADB  will  monitor  resettlement  and  implementation  of \nmitigation measures during review missions.  ADB\u2019s involvement in the permanent resettlement \ncenters will improve the Government\u2019s resettlement process.  \n \nA summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) was undertaken and is provided in \n43. \nAppendix  9.  The  Government  agreed  to  give  due  attention  to  environment  aspects  of  the \nProject,  and  will  request  MEES,  MOTC,  and  other  agencies  concerned  to  undertake  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEE)  for  all  subprojects  according  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines and the Government\u2019s environmental standards and regulations. These agencies will \nalso  be  required  to  follow  mitigation  measures  outlined  in  the  IEEs  and  SIEE  during  project \nimplementation.  ADB  will  monitor  the  implementation  status  of  mitigation  measures  and \nenvironmental impacts of the Project through regular review missions as well as environmental \nstatus reports the Government will submit twice a year. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nlimited  capacity.  Project  consultants  will  assist  MEES \n\nThe Project involves four risks. First, there might be implementation delays because of \n44. \nMEES\u2019 \nin  managing  project \nimplementation. The proposed use of an existing PIU in MOTC will reduce the burden of MEES \nand  mitigate  this  risk.  Advance  action  on  procurement,  retroactive  financing,  and  adoption  of \nlocal competitive bidding and direct purchase will help reduce the risk of delayed procurement. \nSecond,  construction  supervision  may  be  inadequate  because  the  Project  covers  several \nsectors  and  relatively  small  subprojects  over  a  widespread  area.  This  risk  would  be  mitigated \nthrough adequate consulting services. Third, counterpart  funds may not be provided in a timely \nmanner.  ADB  will  work  closely  with  the  Government  to  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart \nresources required for the Project are provided on a timely basis. ADB financing for part of the \nlocal  currency  cost  would  alleviate  this  risk.  Fourth,  fresh  landslides  and  floods  may  damage \ncompleted  project  works.  This  risk  would  be  mitigated  through  careful  project  design  or  new \nalignments  to  avoid  areas  at  high  risk  of  future  landslides  and  floods.  During  implementation, \nADB  will  coordinate  with  the  World  Bank  and  other  donors,  which  will  help  the  Government \ndevelop disaster prevention measures. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  include  the \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n45. \nfollowing assurances in the loan agreement: \n \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Matters \n\n \n46. \nprovided on a timely basis. \n\n \n\nThe Government will ensure that all funds and resources necessary for the Project are \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n2. \n\nEnvironment and Resettlement \n\n \n47. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that MEES prepares IEEs for project components relating \nto schools and municipal infrastructure; and that MOTC prepares IEEs for project components \nrelating to roads, bridges, and electricity, according to ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines, existing \nlaws, and government regulations and standards concerning environmental protection. \n \n48. \nThe Government will ensure that (i) the Project is carried out, and all project facilities are \noperated  and  maintained,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines,  the  IEEs,  the  SIEE, \nexisting laws, and government regulations and standards concerning environmental protection; \n(ii) all environmental mitigation measures identified in the IEEs and SIEE are undertaken during \nimplementation; (iii) the guidelines developed under the IEEs and SIEE are incorporated into the \ndesign, rehabilitation, and operation of project facilities; and (iv) MEES prepares and submits to \nADB,  on  a  semi-annual  basis,  an  environmental  status  report  acceptable \nto  ADB.  \nThe Government will also ensure that all necessary environmental approvals and clearances, as \nrequired under the relevant laws and government regulations, are obtained in a timely manner. \n \n49. \nFor  the  persons  who  have  been  relocated  to  the  Kurshab-1  and  Dubitel  permanent \nresettlement  centers  and  those  who  lost  agricultural  land  because  these  centers  were \nestablished  (affected  persons),  the  Government  will  prepare,  through  an  independent  third-\nparty, a due diligence report assessing (i) the adequacy of the compensation and rehabilitation \nmeasures provided to such affected persons, (ii) whether affected persons are at least as well \noff as they would have been in the absence of the relocation, and (iii) whether they have been \nrelocated  on  a  voluntary  basis.  If  necessary,  the  Government  will  also  (i)  prepare  a  set  of \nmitigation measures to address inadequacies found during the due diligence assessment, and \n(ii)  implement  the  mitigation  measures  according  to  their  terms.  The  due  diligence  report  and \nmitigation measures, if applicable, will be conducted and determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement and Handbook on Resettlement.16 The due diligence report \nshould be submitted to ADB for review. \n \n50. \nFor  the  persons  who  will  be  relocated  to  the  Kurshab-1  and  Dubitel  permanent \nresettlement centers during the Project, the Government will prepare a resettlement framework \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  Handbook  on  Resettlement.  \nThe resettlement framework will contain guidelines and measures for assessing whether (i) the \nProject will cause impacts from land acquisition and/or resettlement, and (ii) the relocation to the \npermanent resettlement centers will be done on a voluntary basis. It will also include procedures \nfor independent third-party verification. If information obtained under the resettlement framework \nshows  impacts  from  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  the  Government  must  inform  ADB  and \nexplain the reasons. After concurrence from ADB, the Government will prepare a resettlement \nplan  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement and  Handbook  on  Resettlement. \nThe resettlement plan must be approved by ADB prior to the implementation of any resettlement \nactivities under the Project. \n \n\n3. \n\nOperation and Maintenance of Project Facilities \n\n \n51. \nThe Government will ensure that (i) project facilities other than water supply facilities are \nmaintained  according  to  sound  administrative  policies  and  practices  by  project  oblasts,  or  the \nimplementing  agencies  through  the  concerned  departments  and  utility  companies  in  charge; \nand (ii) the water supply facilities constructed in  the Dubitel permanent resettlement center are \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 1995.

The  Project  will  do  so  by \nrehabilitating damaged infrastructure and improving social facilities in areas no longer at high risk. \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  oblasts  have  high  incidence  (44%)  of  poverty  as  they  are  generally  quite  remote.  The  rehabilitation of \ndamaged public infrastructure will enable the people affected by floods and landslides to restore economic and social \nactivity and living conditions. Schools have been destroyed and children are attending at temporary facilities until new \nschools can be built. \n \nC. \n \nStakeholder analysis? The fact-finding mission visited most affected communities and found people working with local \ngovernment  officials  to  rebuild  houses  and  livelihoods.  The  affected  people  appreciate  government  support  for \nemergency response. \n \nParticipation  strategy?  A  domestic  consultant  will  assist  MEES  to  work  with  affected  communities  to  increase  their \nparticipation in project implementation and decision-making.  \n \nD. \n  \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  The  flooding  and  landslides  have  affected  entire  families  and  everyone  is \ninvolved  in  rehabilitation.  Prompt  rehabilitation  of  public  infrastructure  will  reduce  their  suffering,  particularly  women \nresponsible  for  household  activities.  Municipal  infrastructure  in  the  Kurshab-1  and  Dubitel  resettlement  centers  will \nimprove  living  conditions  and  encourage  more  affected  families  to  move  away  from  high-risk  zones.  Households \nshould be provided new grazing areas that enable them  to tend livestock. \n \nGender plan prepared?

The mission visited proposed project sites and \nheld discussions with the central and local governments, as well as representatives of affected \ncommunities.  ADB  has  classified  the  Project  under  environmental  category  B.  The  mission \nprepared  this  SIEE  for  the  Project  with  inputs  from  MEES,  the  ADB  resident  mission  in  the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  and  domestic  consultants.  MEES  will  conduct  further  environmental \nassessment  according  to  government  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  during  processing \nand implementation. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  public  infrastructure  damaged  by  severe \nlandslides  and  floods  during  the  spring  and  summer  of  2003.  The  project  comprises  four \ncomponents covering four oblasts (provinces):  \n \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nRoads  and  Bridges.  Rehabilitating  five  damaged  roads  and  rebuilding  ten \ndamaged bridges in Chui, Issyk-kul, Jalal-Abad, and Osh; \nPower  Lines.  Rehabilitating \n21 kilometers, and replacing three transformer stations in Chui and Osh;  \nSchools. Building four schools in Chui and Osh; and   \n\n(iii) \n(iv)  Municipal  Infrastructure.  Constructing  on-site  roads,  power  supply,  water \n\nfour  damaged  distribution \n\nlines \n\ntotaling  \n\nsupply, and drainage systems in two resettlement centers in Osh. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n \n3. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $6.3  million  equivalent,  $5  million  equivalent  of \nwhich  will  be  financed  by  an  ADB  loan.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  with \ncompletion scheduled for March 2007. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic is extremely mountainous and contains some of the highest parts \nof the Tien Shan and Pamir Alay ranges. Its average elevation is approximately 2,750 meters, \nranging from 500 meters in the Fergana Valley to 7,439 meters at Pobeda Peak. The mountains \ncover  some  90%  of  the  territory,  with  the  forest  cover  representing  only  4.25%  of  land  area.  \nThe climate is classified as continental, varying with elevation, and can be subdivided into dry \nsteppe, temperate steppe, and tundra. Temperature varies with elevation, with summer highs of \n40oC  and  winter  lows  below  \u201320oC.  Precipitation  also  varies  with  elevation,  with  more  than \n1,000  millimeters  (mm)  per  year  in  the  mountains  and  less  than  230  mm  per  year  in  some \nvalleys.  Floods  and  landslides  are  major  concerns  because  of  seismic  activity,  steep  slopes, \nfragile  soils,  and  human  activity.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  unique  in  Central  Asia  for  its \nconcentration of wild plant and animal species. There are more than 500 species of vertebrates, \nincluding  83  species  of  mammals,  368  species  of  birds,  28  species  of  reptiles,  3  spices  of \namphibians,  75  species  of  fish,  3,000  species  of  insects,  and  more  than  4,500  species  of \nsupreme  plants.  The  population  is  5  million  people,  65%  of  whom  reside  in  rural  areas. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nForecasted Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nAgriculture  accounts  for  more  than  50%  of  gross  domestic  product  and  rural  inhabitants  form \nthe majority of the poor. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nProject activities will generally occur in sites where infrastructure has been present for at \nleast several years. Potentially sensitive activities include (i) noise and dust from construction at \nthe Kurshab-1 site in Uzgen district of Osh oblast, (ii) lowering of groundwater levels because of \nnew drains constructed at the Kurshab-1 site, and (iii) clearing and re-grading of about 1.5 km of \nthe Nature Park Ala-Archa road in Alamudin district of Chui oblast. There are no known objects \nof historical or cultural heritage that will be impacted by the Project. \n \nImpacts will arise from construction; primarily noise, dust, and waste. Earth-moving may \n6. \nalso  induce  erosion  and  landslides.  Some  reconstruction  waste  is  suitable  for  recycling \n(aluminum,  copper,  and  steel).  Other  wastes  (electric  insulators  and  oils)  will  require  careful \nhandling,  engineered  treatment,  and  disposal.  Other  debris  (e.g.  from  clearing  demolished \nbuildings) will be disposed as engineered fill or municipal solid waste in designated areas.  \n \n7. \nPotential impacts can be mitigated with good design and best engineering practices for \nnoise  abatement  as  well  as  dust  and  erosion  control.  Mitigation  measures  include  (i)  rock \ngabions, riprap, and stabilizing vegetation to minimize erosion; (ii) storm water retention basins \nto control contaminated run-off, if necessary; (iii) restriction of working hours to minimize noise \ndisturbance;  (iv)  water  spray  to  suppress  dust  at  construction  sites;  (v)  re-grading  to  return \nconstruction sites to natural contours, or engineered contours to minimize erosion and landslide \npotential;  (vi)  re-grading  and  revegetation  of  borrow  pits;  and  (vii)  designation  of  engineered \ndisposal sites for waste that cannot be reused or recycled.   \n \n8. \nThe  Uzgen-Zerger  power  lines  will  be  reconstructed  along  the  existing  right-of-way to \nminimize  disturbance  to  nearby  residents.  A  small  patch  of  water-logged  ground  at  Uzgen-\nZerger does not carry any ecological value or require protection. \n \n9. \nLowering  of  groundwater  at  the  Kurshab-1  Permanent  Resettlement  Center  will  be \nnecessary  for  foundation  stabilization,  and  will  not  have  any  long-term  negative  impacts  on \nwater  quality  or  supply.  Water  supplies  for  schools  and  settlements  will  meet  Kyrgyz  water \nquality  standards  (or  World  Health  Organization  standards);  MEES  will  determine  if  treatment \nsystems are necessary.  \n \n10. \nThe alignment of the Nature Park Ala-Archa road will be maintained after rehabilitation, \nas  this  is  the  only  main  access  route  for  visitors.  A  new  alignment  bypassing  the  park  is \nimpractical considering the need to provide continued access to the park. The current alignment \nalong the riverbed represents the most effective solution.  \n \n11. \nThe Project does not require resettlement. 106 households in the villages of Kara-Taryk, \nDubitel,  and  Changet  of  Osh  oblast,  whose  houses  were  destroyed,  are  living  in  areas  the \nGovernment considers at high risk of future floods and landslides. Accordingly, the Government \nhas allocated 23 hectares of land for the Kurshab-1 and the Dubitel resettlement centers in the \nsame  district.  The  fact-finding  mission\u2019s  preliminary  assessment  shows  that  resettlement  is \nvoluntary,  and  that  project  beneficiaries  and  host  communities  in  the  resettlement  sites  are \nKyrgyz.  About  1.85  hectares  of  land  in  the  Kurshab- 1  Permanent  Resettlement  Center  had \nonce been agricultural land, and the Government has paid a total of Som18,492 (about $440) to \nthe  affected  host  community  ($235  per  hectare),  based  on  average  annual  output  value.The \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n31 \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\naffected host people are generally satisfied with the compensation. Prior to the construction of \nthe ADB-financed subprojects at those resettlement sites, due diligence will be conducted and a \nresettlement  framework  developed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  social  safeguard  policies.  A  domestic \nconsultant will assist MEES with community consultation, participation, social impact and benefit \nmonitoring,  preparation  of  the  resettlement  framework,  and  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures  as  required.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  permanent  resettlement  centers will improve \nthe Government\u2019s resettlement process. \n \nE. \n \n12.  MEES  will  be  the  executing  agency.  MEES  and  MOTC  will  be  implementing  agencies. \nAs  the  executing  agency,  MEES  will  ensure  that  an  environmental  assessment  and  relevant \nprocedures  are  incorporated  at  each  stage  of  the  work,  specifically  (i)  preparation  of  tender \ndocuments  and  contracts,  (ii)  bid  reviews  and  awards,  (iii)  supervision  of  pre-construction \nbaseline monitoring, and (iv) construction supervision. \n \n13.  MEES  will  also  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  following  laws  of  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic are complied with: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nLaw on Environmental Protection, \nLaw on Environmental Expertise (Environmental Assessment), \nLaw on Specially Protected Nature Territories, \nLaw on Animal World, \nLaw on Atmosphere Protection, \nForest Code, \nLaw on Highways, and \nLaw on Protection and Usage of Historical and Cultural Heritage. \n\n \nStaff  from  MEES,  MOTC,  and  other  relevant  government  agencies  should  regularly \n14. \nundertake joint environmental inspection of project activities, especially dust, erosion, and noise \ncontrol.  The  results  of  the  inspections  should  be  included  in  bi-annual  reports  submitted  by \nMEES to ADB. An environment/social officer should be assigned to each rehabilitation package \nto ensure that environmental contract provisions are enforced. \n \n15. \nRecommended  environmental  monitoring  includes  routine  site  inspection  and  reporting \non  soil  and  erosion  control,  embankment  and  erosion  protection,  borrow  pit restoration, water \nquality monitoring (including baseline and routine periodic water quality monitoring), routine dust \nand  noise  monitoring,  and  direct  supervision  and  documentation  of  waste  disposal. \nEnvironmental conditions will be monitored at least twice per year and results reported to ADB. \n \n16. \nthe project contract documents as necessary: \n \n\nSpecific  environmental  provisions  related  to  the  following  topics  should  be  included  in \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nembankments and erosion prevention measures; \nborrow pit restoration; \nquarry activities; \nsiting of construction camps and related facilities; \nsiting of asphalt plants; \nbaseline and routine periodic air quality monitoring; \nopen burning is prohibited; use of solvents and volatile materials will be approved \nby the project\u2019s construction supervision consultants; \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n(xi) \n(xii) \n\n(xiii) \n\n(xiv)  \n\ndust-generating  items  will  be  conveyed  under  cover;  road  surfaces  and \nexcavation and construction sites will be sprayed with water to control dust; \ntrucks carrying earth, sand, or stone will be covered with tarps to avoid spilling; \nbaseline and routine periodic water quality monitoring; \nbaseline and routine periodic noise monitoring; \nother  noise-related  provisions,  such  as  source  controls,  time-of-day restrictions, \ntime and activity constraints, and community awareness activities; \nsafety  provisions  such  as  detours  and  traffic  interruptions,  and  emergency \nresponse procedures in the event of accidents or natural disasters; and \ncommunity relations. \n\nAdditional recommendations for oversight and monitoring include: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nDesign of all rehabilitation works will be followed, and any deviations that occur \nshould consider the associated potential environmental impacts. \nThe  designs  will  make  full  provision  for  incorporating  the  various  mitigation \nmeasures noted above. \nContract  documents  will  include,  but  will  not  be  limited  to,  all  the  appropriate \nclauses to cover the environmental protection requirements. \nLoan  covenants  should  include  provision  for  adequate  maintenance  of  the \nrehabilitated facilities. \nCritical activities with anticipated environmental impacts during construction and \noperation should be closely monitored. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n \nF. \n \n18.  MEES, MOTC, and consultants will document public consultation and disclosure before \nand  during  implementation.  Because  this  is  an  emergency  project,  consultation  with  local \nauthorities and residents was conducted on an ad-hoc basis during the fact-finding mission. \n \nG. \n \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  roads,  bridges,  power  lines,  and  schools.  Adverse  impacts \n19. \non  the  environment  will  be  small  and  limited  to  the  construction  period.  The  most  important \nmeasures are proper disposal of construction debris and waste. Adverse impacts can be easily \nmitigated through good engineering and construction practices. No  negative impact will persist \nidentified  adverse \nduring  operation.  The  Project  requires  no  resettlement.  Since  all \nenvironmental impacts are minor and can be mitigated, an environmental impact assessment is \nnot required. \n \nH. \n \n20. \nThe  Project  will  have  no  direct  negative  impacts  on  water  supply,  sewerage,  energy \nsystems,  or  waste  disposal.  No  impacts  on  archaeological  or  historic  resources  are  expected; \nno  significant  adverse  impacts  on  settlement  patterns,  provinces,  or  communities;  and  no \nsignificant  adverse  impacts  to  aquatic  or  terrestrial  ecosystems  are  anticipated.  Little  or  no \nagricultural displacement will occur. Construction materials\u2014except special ones such as cable \nstrands  and  admixtures\u2014will  be  obtained  in  and  near  project  areas.  Embankment  soil, \naggregates, and cement sources are available in or near project sites. No adverse impacts are \nseen on employment and income trends, nor on ethnic minorities. \n\nConclusions \n\n \n17. \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 November 2003) \n \n", "Currency Unit \nSom1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "som (Som) \n$0.0239 \nSom41.8672 \n", "ADB \nGDP \nIEE \nMEES \nMOEC \nMOTC \nNGO \nPIU \nPPMS \nPSC \nSIEE \nSOE \n", "GWh \nkm \nkV \nkWh \nmm \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \ngross domestic product \ninitial environmental examination \nMinistry of Ecology and Emergency Situations  \nMinistry of Education and Culture \nMinistry of Transport and Communications \nnongovernment organization \nproject implementation unit \nproject performance monitoring system \nproject steering committee \nsummary initial environmental examination \nstatement of expenditures  \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "gigawatt-hour \nkilometer \nkilovolt \nkilowatt-hour \nmillimeter \n", "oblast \n", "\u2013 \n", "province \n", "GLOSSARY \n \n", "NOTE \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n \n", " \n \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team comprising H.
