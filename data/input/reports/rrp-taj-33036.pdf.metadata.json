The cessation of economic \ntransfers to Tajikistan from the former Soviet Union, the transition \nprocess,  a  civil  war,  and  the  subsequent  political  instability  that \nstarted  in  1992  and  continued  until  1997  have  resulted  in  a \nprolonged  economic  depression.  The  aftermath  of  the  civil  war \nand  economic  depression  have  put  more  than  83%  of  the  Tajik \npopulation below the poverty line.  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) responded to the postconflict \nsituation  in 1999  through the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project \n(SSRP)  that  provided  basic  rehabilitation  assistance  to  the \neducation, health, and social protection sectors. The major focus \nin  the  health  sector  was  to  rehabilitate  health  facilities,  provide \nsupplies  such  as  drugs  and  equipment,  and  train  doctors  and \nnurses to address immediate needs.      \n \nWith  security  and  political  stability  restored,  humanitarian \nagencies  that  have  supported  health  service  delivery  and  drug \nsupply in the postconflict period are about to exit.  Currently more \nthan  30%  of  health  expenditure  is  financed  by  humanitarian \nagencies. A comprehensive social sector study by ADB  identified \nthe  following  as  major  concerns  in  the  health  sector:  (i)  high \nburden of diseases and precarious health status of the population; \n(ii)  shrunken  public  health  expenditures  and  inefficient  use  of \nresources ; (iii) collapsed public health care system; (iv) increased \nout-of\u2013pocket  payment  by  beneficiaries;  (v)  reduced  access  to \nand use of health services, particularly by the poor; (vi) weakened \nand  unreliable  health \nlimited \nmanagerial, technical, administrative, and financial  capacity at all \nlevels of the health sector. The study highlighted  the urgent need \nto  replace  the  drug  supply  system  introduced  and  managed  by \nhumanitarian  agencies  with  a  well-managed,  sustainable \nprocurement and distribution system before their exit. The health \nsector  reform  project  (HSRP)  is  designed  to  respond  to  the \nfindings of this study.  \n\ninformation  system;  and  (vii) \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nAt the recent consultative group meeting in May 2003,  substantial \ngrant assistance  was  pledged,  but  is  not  yet  visible.  Even  when \ngrant  funds  are  forthcoming,  it  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  that \nthey  are  used  efficiently  to  address  key  system  deficiencies. \nHSRP  provides  an  investment  framework  and  a  vehicle  for \ndialogue  on  policy  and  priorities  and  hence  provides  a  useful \nbasis for actions by Government and by aid agencies. \n \nThe goal of the  HSRP is to improve  people\u2019s health, in particular \nthe poor, women, and  children in Tajikistan. The  HSRP has three \nobjectives:  (i)  improve  the  management  capacity  of  the  health \nsector  and  system  efficiency  through  institutional  strengthening \nand  reforms;  (ii)  increase  equitable  access to  and  use of quality \nbasic  health  services by  the poor,  women,  and  children;  and  (iii) \nsupport informed policy dialogue to pursue reform.   \n \nThe HSRP has three components: (i) institutional development for \nthe  health  sector,  (ii)  drug  supply  and  quality  control,  and  (iii) \nefficient  and  sustainable  delivery  of  a  pro-poor  health  service \npackage.  The  HSRP  will  have  national  and  pilot  district \ncomponents. Health service improvement will be  implemented in \nfive  rural  districts  selected  for  severity  of  poverty  and  level  of \ninfant and maternal mortality. The  HSRP will focus investment in \nareas  that  will  have  the  greatest  impact  on  the  poor  and \nvulnerable.    \n \nThe total project cost is $9.375 million equivalent, of which $5.340 \nmillion is  foreign exchange  and  $4.035  million  equivalent  is  local \ncurrency.   \n \n\n \nSource \n   Asian Development \n\nForeign \nExchange \n5.340 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n2.160 \n\nTotal \nCost \n7.500 \n\nBank \n   Government \n \n \n\nTotal \n\n \u2013 \n \n\n1.875 \n\n1.875 \n\n \n\n \n\n5.340 \n\n4.035 \n\n9.375 \n\n($ million) \n \n% \n\n80 \n\n20 \n \n100 \n\nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIn  view  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  debt  position  and  as  requested  by  the \nGovernment, ADB is  trying  to  mobilize cofinancing  in the form of \ngrants from other sources  to substitute for the loan particularly for \nthe \u201csoft\u201d components like training and consulting services. Once \ngrants are firmly committed, corresponding savings under the loan \nmay be reallocated or cancelled as appropriate.     \n \n\n\fv \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  The  proposed  ADB  loan  is  for  SDR5.238  million  ($7.5  million \nequivalent)  from  its  Asian  Development  Fund.  The  balance  of \n$1.875 million equivalent will be provided by the Government. The \nADB  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  32  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 8 years. Interest will be charged at 1% per annum during \nthe  grace  period  and  1.5% thereafter.  The  ADB  loan  will  include \nfinancing of the interest charge. The Borrower will be the Republic \nof Tajikistan. \n \nUntil 30 June 2009 \n \n31 December 2008 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nThe President\u2019s Office will be the Executing Agency with a deputy \nprime  minister  as  project  coordinator. A  project  implementation \nunit (PIU) will be established within the Ministry of Health (MOH). \nA Project Administration Unit (PAU) will be established under the \nPIU.  The  PAU  will  be  shared  with  the  parallel  Education Sector \nReform  Project  and  will  function  as  a  secretariat  providing \nadministrative support to  both  projects.  In  each  HSRP  district, a \ndistrict  PIU  will  be  established.  The  PIU  will  make  technical \ndecisions  on  the  projects.  A  national  steering  committee  and \ndistrict  supervisory  groups  will  be  established  to  provide  policy \nguidance and coordination. \n \nThe President\u2019s Office \n \nADB-financed  goods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nEquipment  and  supplies  will  be  procured  by \ninternational \ncompetitive  bidding \nin  excess  of  $500,000, \ninternational  shopping  for  contracts  in  excess  of  $100,000,  and \ndirect  purchase  for  contracts  less  than  $100,000.  Civil  works \nvalued  at  $1  million  or  less  will  be  carried  out  under  local \ncompetitive bidding.  \n \nConsultants \nto  supply  164  person-months  of  services  (48  \ninternational and  106  domestic)  will be recruited following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  engaging  international  and  domestic \nconsultants.  International  consulting  firms  or  individuals  will  be \nengaged to provide these consulting services. \n \nThe  HSRP  will  benefit  the  whole  population  indirectly  through \nnationwide  components.  Across  MOH,  capacity  will  be  built  to \neffectively plan, finance, and manage the health sector.  Reforms \nin  health  services  delivery  and  financing  aim  to  create  a  more \nresponsive, sustainable, and equitable system. \n \n\nfor  contracts \n\nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Safeguards \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n \n\nin \n\nfive  of \n\nthe  poor, \n\nThe  HSRP  will  improve  people\u2019s  health,  especially  women, \nchildren,  and \nthe  poorest  districts. \nApproximately  5.5%  of  the  population  of  6.3  million  will  be \ncovered.  The  targeted  districts  have  high  infant  and  maternal \nmortality  rates.  The  HSRP  will  focus  on  the  health  care  levels \nmost  used  by  the  poor  and  will  pilot-test  the  primary  health care \n(PHC) system based on family group practices (FGPs). PHC is an \ninternationally  proven  cost-effective  method  to  respond  to  the \nneeds  of  the  poor,  women,  and  children.  The  FGP  system  can \nserve  the  poor  and  vulnerable  better  than  will  other  types  of \nservices, including hospitals. Based on lessons learned from pilot \ntesting,  the  PHC  system  will  be  expanded  nationwide,  thus \ndisseminating  the  benefits  gained  through  the  HSRP.  To  induce \nsynergy effects, the HSRP will work in the same districts with the \nEducation  Sector  Reform  Project.  The  HSRP  is  classified  as  a \ncore  poverty  intervention  with  a  human  development  focus  and \ngender and development.      \n \nSuccessful  implementation  of  the  reform-oriented  project  will \ndepend largely on the capacity of MOH. The HSRP will strengthen \nto  analyze  situations,  and  elaborate  and \nMOH\u2019s  capacity \nimplement    reform  strategies  and  action  plans.  The  HMIS will be \nset up to plan, monitor, and evaluate reforms. \n \nA significant risk is the limited capacity of MOH staff to implement \nthe work promptly and efficiently. Close monitoring and oversight \nby  experienced staff and  committed government officials  are key \nto  smooth  project  implementation.  This  risk  will  be  managed \nthrough  the continued  involvement of  a  deputy prime  minister in \nthe  President\u2019s  Office, an effective implementation structure built \non the successful framework developed by the SSRP, provision of \ncapacity-building  support,  and  engagement  of  experienced \ndomestic and international consultants. \n \nThe changes being introduced in health services delivery require \na  change  in  the  attitude  of  staff  and  clients  and  a  change  in \nmanaging  resources  for optimal use.  The  HSRP  will  invest  in  a \npublic  information  campaign  to  elicit  public  perceptions  on  a \nresponsive health system, and will strengthen management.  \n \nThe  TA  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund  in \nthe  amount  of  $300,000  will  be  provided  initially  to  support \nbuilding  management  information  systems  for  informed  policy \ndialogue,  decision  making,  and  monitoring.  The \ntechnical \nassistance  (TA)  will  serve  as  a  central  policy  tool  to  improve \nMOH\u2019s planning and  budgeting and  support  reform  in the health \nsector.  The  objectives  are  to  (i)  develop  the  health  management \ninformation  system  (HMIS)  framework  and  action  plans  at  the \nMOH, region,  and  district levels;  (ii) provide a basis for planning, \n\n\fvii \n\nmonitoring, and measuring system performance and  progress of \nreforms; and (iii) provide a mechanism to support monitoring and \npolicy dialogue between the Government and aid agencies. \n \nA  second  grant  of  $150,000  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the \nJapan  Special  Fund  will  develop  a  long-term  national  drug \nprocurement and distribution strategy. The TA objectives are to (i) \nsupport  policy  dialogue  and  develop  a  clear  strategy  and \nframework  for  establishing  a  drug  procurement  and  distribution \nsystem;  (ii)  prepare  a  rational  plan  for  warehousing,  equipment \ndistribution, and staffing; and (iii) provide operational guidelines on \nthe whole procurement and distribution process. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Health Sector Reform Project. The report also describes two \nproposed technical assistance (TA) grants: (i) Planning and Policy Dialogue for Health Reform, \nand (ii) Developing the Drug  Procurement and Distribution Strategy, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by  the Board, will approve  the \nTAs.   \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nCessation  of  economic  transfers  to  Tajikistan  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  following \nindependence  in  1991  and  the  release  of  ethnic  pressures  contributed  to  the  outbreak  of  civil \nwar  in  mid-1992.  Macroeconomic  conditions  worsened  until  the  1997  cease-fire agreement. \nSince then the economy has  shown signs of recovery, but the gross domestic product (GDP) in \n2001  was  only  43%  of  that  of  1991.  Benefits  from  improvement  in  GDP  growth  have  not \nreached the household level. GDP per capita in 2001 was $162. Annual inflation rate, although \nmuch  reduced  compared  with  the  level  in  the  early  1990s,  is  still  high,  while  real  wages \ndecreased to 25% of 1991 levels in 1999.1 The aftermath of the civil war together with economic \ndepression has put more than 83% of the Tajik population below the poverty line. \n \n3. \nThe  Government  places  a  high  priority  on  poverty  reduction.  External  agencies \nsupported the development of  the national poverty reduction strategy adopted in 2002  that sets \nout  efficient  and  fair  provision  of  basic  social  services  as  one of  the  key  approaches.  The \npoverty  partnership  agreement  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the \nGovernment stipulates that ADB and the Government will  promote efficient and effective social \nservices  delivery  to  the  poor  and  rationalize  social  sector  expenditures  to  ensure  equitable \naccess. The Government has adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for 2015 as \nthe key targets in poverty reduction (Table 1).       \n \n\nTable 1:  Tajikistan Millennium Developme nt Goals (MDGs) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nArea  \nPoverty \nChild Health \n\nMaternal \nHealth \n \nReproductive \nHealth \n \nAdult Health \n \n\nGoal \n\n \nReduce poverty by 50% by 2015 \nReduce infant mortality rate by two thirds \nfrom 1990 to 2015 \n \nReduce  maternal  mortality  ratio  by  three \nquarters from 1990 to 2015 \n\nIncrease access to contraceptives  \n\n \nIndicator \n% of population  \nDeaths per \n\n1,000 live \nbirths  \nDeaths per \n\n100,000 live \nbirths  \n% of  female  \npopulation \naged 15-45 \n\n \n1990 \n\u2013 \n40.4 \n\nLatest \nyear a \n\n  82.6 \n  36.7 \n\n2015 \n(target) \n58 \n25 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n  43.1 \n\n  21.8 \n \n\n33.5   \n\n35 \n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n    22 \n\nHalt and reverse incidence of  tuberculosis \nand  other  major  infectious  diseases  by \n2015 \n\nIncidence per \n100,000 \npopulation \n\n(\u2014 = no data available.) \na  Official figures.

Dushanbe.  \n\n\f 2\n\n \n4. \nTajikistan  has  a  rapidly  growing  population  with  a  young  population  structure.  The \npopulation in 2000 was about 6.3 million with 49.5% under 17 years old. This implies that health \nservices must be planned to  accommodate the needs of this young population. The fertility rate \ndeclined  from  5.0  in  1990  to  3.7  in  2000.  But  it  is  still  the highest  among  the Central Asian \nrepublics (CARs) and risks doubling the population every 20 years. \n \n5. \nThe reduction in the GDP and the parallel reduction of the proportion of GDP spent on \nhealth  have  resulted  in  a  very  large  decline  in  per  capita  spending  on  health.  Public  health \nexpenditure  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  was  only  0.9% in 2002  from  4.8%  in  1990.  This  is  the \nlowest  among  CARs  and  much  lower  than  the  5%  target  figure  for  developing  countries \nadvocated  by  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO).  In  2001  per  capita  public  health \nexpenditure was only $1.60 equivalent, about 1.5% of that in 1990.  \n \n6. \nDuring the Soviet era, the health system in Tajikistan was characterized by widespread \naccess to  health  services, but  the  services  were  costly  and  very  inefficient  (overstaffing  and \nexcess accommodation, hospital-based services biased toward curative rather than preventive \ncare).  It  provided  low-quality  care  and  was  based  on  outdated  treatment  protocols.  The \nconsiderable  reduction  in  financial  resources  and  enormous  demographic  pressure  have \nresulted in: (i) lower quality of health services, (ii) collapse of the already inefficient public health \nsystem,  and  (iii)  increased  prevalence  of  informal  out-of-pocket  payments  for  officially  free \nservices.  Together  with  prevailing  poverty  at  household  level,  the  reduction  resulted  in \ndecreased service use and deteriorating health status of the population.  The sector analysis is \nin Appendix 1.  \n \n7. \nSince 1991, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has adopted major changes in national health \npolicy  directions.  Particularly  in  1998-2000,  MOH  developed  a  health  sector  reform  plan \nsupported by WHO and the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO). In adjusting to \nthe socioeconomic, demographic, and epidemiological situation, the reform emphasizes primary \nhealth  care  (PHC)  system  based  on  a  family  group  practice  (FGP) 2    as  the  strategy  for \ndelivering  health  services.  The  strategy  responds  to  client  needs  (particularly  to  the  poor, \nwomen,  and  children),  and  provides  cost-effective,  good-quality  care  that  is  equitable  with \nsustainable access.  \n \n8. \nInternational  assistance  to  Tajikistan  in  the  postconflict  period  has  concentrated  on \nhumanitarian assistance. Humanitarian nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have been active \nin  providing  health  services  to  the  population  affected  by  conflict  and  poverty.  A  shift  in \ninternational assistance is now occurring from emergency relief and short-term rehabilitation to \ndevelopment.  As  long-term  stability  has  been  secured,  the  nature  of  the  required  work  has \nbegun to  shift. Development  agencies  started  to  work  in  the  health  sector  in  the  late 1990s, \nwhen NGOs and emergency-oriented agencies were beginning to withdraw. In 1998  the World \nBank  approved  the  Primary  Health  Care  Project  that  focused on  strengthening  PHC  in  two \ndistricts.  The  ADB-funded  Social  Sector  Rehabilitation  Project  (SSRP)  approved  in  1999 \nfocused  on  rehabilitating  and  re-equipping  schools  and  health  facilities.  ADB  and  the  World \nBank  collaborate  closely  through  information  exchange  to  avoid  duplication  and  consolidate \nefforts on the health sector.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  A FGP is a team of doctors and nurses who work as a private entity under contract with the local government and \n\nprovide holistic family health services.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nInternational assistance in the health sector  has accounted for at least one third of the \n9. \ntotal  health  expenditures  for  1992\u20131997.  In  2001  total  health  expenditures  amounted  to  $39 \nmillion  equivalent  or  $6.30  equivalent  per  capita  financed  by  users  (31%),  the  Government \n(26%),  development  banks  (7%),  and  humanitarian  and  United  Nations  agencies  (36%). \nAppendix  2  summarizes  external  assistance  to  the  health  sector.  Timely  support  from \ndevelopment  agencies  is  important  to  ensure  that  the  exit  of  humanitarian  agencies  will  not \ncreate a vacuum and that health sector development and reforms stay on track.   \n \nB. \n \n10. \nUnreliable  Health  Data  and  a  Double  Burden  of  Diseases.  Life  expectancy  and \nmortality trends in Tajikistan have improved steadily according to official figures. However, other \ninformation  suggests  a  more  precarious  health  situation.  Using  other  information  sources, \nmortality rates,  particularly the  infant mortality rate  (IMR),  appear to  have  stagnated  over  the \ndecade. The officially reported IMR, a key MDG, was 36.7 per 1,000 live births for 2000, but the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) estimated it as 82.4. Health data is unreliable due to \nsubstantial underreporting attributable to the breakdown of the data collection system during the \nwar and the introduction of registration fees that discourage poor families from recording births \nand deaths. A 1998 United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) survey revealed that over 80% of \nbirths and infant deaths were not registered. Continued use of the Soviet definition of live births3 \nis  another  reason  for  underreporting,  despite  the  official  adoption  of  the  WHO  definition.  In \naddition,  a  death  is  recorded  where  it  occurs,  for  example,  in  urban  hospitals,  instead  of  the \nplace of residence. This practice distorts data and results in incomplete statistical data  for rural \nareas.    \n \n11. \nCardiovascular diseases (33%) are the biggest cause of death in Tajikistan, followed by \nrespiratory diseases (17%), accidents (10%), and infectious and parasitic diseases (9%). Over \nthe  decade,  infectious  and  respiratory  diseases and  those  related  to  poverty  are  reemerging \nand  increasing.  They  include  malnutrition,  tuberculosis, typhoid,  and  diarrhea.  Malnutrition  is \nprevalent  in  many  parts  of  the  country.  For  example,  as  many  as  39%  of children in  Khatlon, \none of the regions affected by the civil war, suffer from chronic malnutrition. Another 7% suffer \nfrom acute malnutrition. Major causes of infant mortality are respiratory, diarrheal diseases, and \nperinatal  conditions.  Causes  of  maternal  mortality  are  hemorrhages,  eclampsia, and infection, \nmost of which are preventable. Anemia, from which 60% of women of reproductive age suffer, is \na  strong  factor  contributing to  maternal complications.  Tajikistan  thus  suffers  from  a  double \nburden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases .  \n \n12. \nLimited and  Reduced  Access to,  Quality of, and  Use  of  PHC. PHC in Tajikistan is \nprovided by feldshers (community nurses), midwives, and doctors at medical houses, polyclinics, \nrural health centers, and rural hospitals.  Patients  are  referred  to  central district  hospitals. The \nPHC  network  is  extensive,  but  is  not  functioning  effectively. Despite  the  high  percentage  of \nanemia  among  reproductive  women,  officially  recorded  maternal  complications  are  less  than \n10% of the total recorded pregnancies. This is substantially less than in other CARs, suggesting \nthat  the  antenatal  care  system  in  Tajikistan  fails  to  identify  and  respond  to  needy  people. \nAnother  issue  requiring  attention  is  the  increasing  proportion  of  home  deliveries  and  births \nwithout  skilled  health  personnel  in  attendance.  According  to  UNICEF, these  births were less \nthan  10%  in  1990,  but  increased  to  45%  in  2000.  The  rising  proportion  of  home  deliveries \n\n                                                 \n3   The  Soviet  definition  of  live  births  does  not  include  premature  and  low-birth  weight  babies  who  do  not  survive \n\nduring the first week. This lowers the infant mortality rate estimate.   \n\n \n\n\f 4\n\nsuggests the breakdown of  the local health care system and the financial inability of families to \npay for medical care.       \n \n13. \nPHC  facilities  are  in  poor  condition,  with  equipment, pharmaceuticals,  and reference \nmaterial  largely  absent  if  not  supplied  through  humanitarian  aid.  Although  most  of  the  PHC \nbudget  is  allocated  to  salaries,  salaries  are  well  below  the  level  necessary  for  survival  and \ndemoralize  health  staff.  Unofficial  fees  are  now  widely  charged.  Fixed  salaries  provide  no \nfinancial  incentive  for  health  staff  to  serve  those  unable  to  pay.  The  knowledge  and  skills  of \nhealth staff at all levels of the heath system are often outdated and limited. Many remote health \ncenters are seriously understaffed. These factors limit access to PHC. A lack of awareness of \nPHC  among  the  population  also  reduces  the  demand for  it.  Many  people  still  believe  that  the \nhospital-based health care system  developed  before independence remains the best and that \nthe former health system must be rebuilt.   \n \n14. \nThe cost of health services, including  pharmaceuticals and out-of-pocket costs, is a key \naccess issue, particularly for the poor even at the PHC level.  Even where user fees have been \nestablished,  the  official  cost  of  health  services  can  be  unaffordable.  Fear  of  unpredictable \ndemands  for  additional  unofficial  fees  also  deter  the  poor  from  using  government  health \nservices.  ADB\u2019s  poverty  assessment  indicates  that the poor seek health care less than richer \ngroups do because of the difficulty of paying for it and resort to self-medication. To set up a fully \nfunctional  and  pro-poor  PHC  system,  a  comprehensive  approach  covering  the  following  is \nrequired:  material  and  facility  support,  staff  training,  removal  of  barriers  to  access  to  health \nservices  among  the  poor,  and  changing  perceptions  of  health  services  among  the  population. \nEffective  community  participation  will  ensure  that  the  community  is  aware  of  services, \nunderstands the problems of delivery, and thereby contributes to strengthening the quality and \nresponsiveness  of  the  services.  Better  services will  in  turn  increase  use,  permit  regularizing \ninformal out-of-pocket payments, and contribute to  the full integration of the health sector in the \ncommunity.  \n \n15. \nThe health reform concept adopted in 2000 proposes to base PHC on the FGP system. \nDevelopment agencies, including ADB, the World Bank, and ZdravPlus program supported by \nthe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  have  been  retraining \nspecialists.  So  far  240  family  doctors  and  188  family  nurses  have  been  trained.  However,  no \nlegal framework has been set up for the FGP system, and hence trained staff continue to see \npatients  who  fall  within  their  original  clinical  specialty  in  unchanged  working  conditions.  For \nfamily doctors and nurses to effectively serve the population, particularly the poor, they need a \nnew  working  environment  that  involves  a  change  in  provider  payment,  introduction  of \nperformance-based contracts, and registration of the population with FGPs.     \n \n16. \nLimited  Institutional  Capacity  of  the  Health  Sector.  MOH  has  limited  institutional \ncapacity to effectively plan, manage, finance, and monitor the public health sector. The health \nmanagement  information  system  (HMIS)  should  provide  a  basis  for  planning  and  monitoring. \nBut the current HMIS is inadequate. Health care is inadequately funded and resources are not \nwell managed, resulting in  failure  to  base  resource  allocation  on  needs  and  evidence.  Health \nbudget allocations do not  reflect MOH\u2019s policy on PHC, but continue to be based on traditional \nnorms,  such  as  hospital  beds  and  staff  numbers,  so  that  the  majority  of  the  budget  goes to \nhospitals. PHC\u2019s share of the total health budget is extremely small, and even decreased from \n7.3% in 2000 to 6.0% in 2002.4   \n \n\n                                                 \n4 The Health expenditure review is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nThe  human  resource  policy  and  planning  capacity  of  the  health  sector  are  not  well \n17. \ndeveloped.  Analysis  suggests  lack  of  consistency  in  available  staffing  data;  overstaffing  at \nnational and provincial levels and understaffing at district and health centers; significant gaps in \nkey  staff  categories;  inappropriate  deployment  of  specialty  staff;  poorly  defined  roles  and \nfunctions  of  staff;  and  weak  human  resource  management.  The  cost-effective  use of human \nresources  and efficient use of  the budget are key in a resource-constrained context such as in \nTajikistan. Capacity building is required at all levels of the health sector.   \n  \nLessons Learned.  The Government and its development partners have learned many \n18.  \nlessons in recent years. ADB fully considered the experience of World Bank pilot activities and \nthe  ADB  SSRP  in  project  design. 5 The  most  important  lesson  is  that  capacity  building  and \nimplementation of expanded capacity is a long-term process that involves training and on-the-\njob support.  Staff  will  perform  to  a  high  standard  when  appropriate  salary  and  performance-\nrelated  incentives  are  provided  and  when  effective  management  and  operating  resources  are \npresent.  Effective  human  resource  management  at  the  district  and  facility  levels  requires \nsufficient  delegation  of  authority  and  responsibility.  Appropriate training  is  also required  with \nongoing  supervision.  Functional  analysis  is  needed  to  identify  staffing  needs  and  support \nplanning and management for an  effective workforce. \n \n19. \nThe SSRP demonstrates that experienced project staff familiar with ADB guidelines and \ncommitted government officials are key  to smooth project  implementation.  To compensate for \nthe  lack  of  experience  of  line  ministries  in  administering  ADB  projects  and  to  ensure  cost-\neffectiveness,  the  Health  Sector  Reform  Project  (HSRP)  and  the  parallel  Education  Sector \nReform Project (ESRP) will share the same project administration structure based on the SSRP \nimplementation framework that has proved successful. The  deputy prime minister will continue \nas  project  director,  capacity  building  will  be  supported,  and  experienced  domestic  and \ninternational consultants will be recruited. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives  \n\n \nA. \n \nThe HSRP will improve people\u2019s health, especially of women, children, and the poor in \n20. \nTajikistan,  and  lay  a  foundation  for  longer-term  development.  The  HSRP  will  help  Tajikistan \nachieve the  MDG by reducing  by 30%  IMR, under-5 mortality rate, and maternal mortality rate \n(MMR) in pilot districts. Specifically, the HSRP aims to   \n \n\nimprove the management capacity of the health sector and system efficiency through \ninstitutional strengthening and reforms; \n\nincrease equitable access to and use of  basic health services by the poor, women, \nand children; and \n\nsupport informed policy dialogue to pursue health sector reform.   \n\n                                                 \n5   Experience in the ADB-funded Mongolia Health Sector Development Program, that achieved considerable success \n\nin introducing FGPs has also been considered. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f 6\n\n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nB. \n \n21. \nThe HSRP has three components: (i)  institutional development for the health sector, (ii) \ndrug supply and quality control, and (iii) efficient and sustainable delivery of a pro-poor health \nservice  package.  The  project  framework  is  in  Appendix  3.  The  project conceptual framework \n(Appendix 4), illustrates that all subcomponents are interlinked to support the efficient delivery of \nthe pro-poor health service package.   \n \nThe HSRP will have national and pilot district components. Health service improvement \n22. \nwill be implemented in five rural districts (Roshkala in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region \n[GBAR],  Ayni  and  Gornaya  Matcha  in  Sughd  region,  Garm  in  Region  of  Republican \nSubordination  [RRS],  and  Kulyab  in  Khatlon  region)  selected  for  their  level  and severity  of \npoverty  and  the  level  of  infant  and  maternal  mortality  (Map,  page  viii).  Synergistic effects of \nparallel  implementation of  the  HSRP and  the  ESRP  in  the  same  districts   will  be  particularly \nbeneficial to community  mobilization  and  child  health  and  early  education.  The  profile  of  the \nproject  districts  is  in  Appendix  5.  The  HSRP  will  invest  in  areas  that  will  have  the  greatest \nimpact on the poor, women, and children.    \n\n \n1. \n\nInstitutional Development \n\n \nIn  the  emergency  and  postconflict  situations,  health  sector  staff  have  so  far  received \n23. \nlimited capacity-building support. The HSRP will build the capacity to plan, manage, and monitor \nat the national, region, and district levels. The HSRP will strengthen MOH and training institutes, \nsuch  as  the  medical  university,  to  enable  them  to  train  staff  so  that  the  health  sector  can \neffectively plan, manage, and monitor services delivery, financing, and staffing. Gender balance \nwill be ensured in training. Enhanced efficiency  is one of the benefits of capacity building.  The \nHSRP  will  reform  the  health  services  delivery  system  to  improve  system  efficiency.  The  initial \nfocus  in  reform  is  to  develop  the  FGP-based  PHC  system.  Appendix  6  describes  a  plan  for \nintroducing FGPs in Tajikistan.  The HSRP will help MOH and the  medical university to analyze \nworkforce  situations  and  prepare  a  workforce  development  plan.  An  effective  HMIS  will  be \ndeveloped to support planning and monitoring.  \n\n \na. \n\nCapacity Building for Planning and Management \n\n \n24. \nThe HSRP will finance overseas training of key staff of MOH and  the medical university. \nStaff of MOH, regions, and pilot districts will receive in-country training in health sector planning \nand management.  The  HSRP will  enhance  the  ability  of  MOH,  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social \nProtection, and the medical university to analyze workforce situations and to develop a human \nresource policy and a workforce plan. The medical university must better understand health staff \nneeds  and  required  qualifications  under  the  reformed  health system.  MOH  and  the  medical \nuniversity will need to better coordinate student intake, distribution of graduates, staff numbers, \nprofiles and distribution, job descriptions, and training needs.  The plan will provide a basis for \nrationalizing  staff  for  pilot  districts.  However,  lack  of  reliable  data  on  the  existing workforce \nseriously impairs effective human resource planning. Therefore,  HMIS development and district \nsurveys on staffing will proceed. The licensing system for medical staff will be improved and the \naccreditation system will be developed and implemented.  The  HSRP will strengthen continuing \neducation  programs  that  have  been  provided  by  humanitarian  agencies  but  are  not \nstandardized and coordinated. The HSRP will develop a facility rationalization plan based on the \nhealth reform concept. The HSRP will strengthen the capacity of MOH and pilot districts to plan \nand  supervise  a  public  information  campaign  in  close  cooperation  with  UNICEF.  Public \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ncampaigns will be a strong tool in changing people\u2019s perception and behavior toward health and \nhealth services.  \n \n25. \nUsing the framework developed under the associated TA (paras. 55-56),  the  HSRP will \nimplement  HMIS  and  train  staff  nationwide  to  collect,  analyze,  and  use  data.  The  HSRP will \ncomputerize HMIS at  MOH and  at  strategic  planning levels. An intersectoral and  aid  agency \nforum will be set up to supervise HMIS and help plan, implement, and monitor the reform. HMIS \nreports will be published annually  in Russian and  in  English.  Surveys  in  the  five  HSRP  pilot \ndistricts will supplement and strengthen the reliability of HMIS data at the national level.  \n \n\nb. \n\nDeveloping a Family Group Practice Framework  \n\n \nThe HSRP will help MOH establish legislative, financial, and  operational frameworks for \n26. \nthe  FGP  system.  This  includes  setting  up  the  accreditation  scheme  of  FGPs,  developing  a \nframework  and  guidelines  for  FGP  mapping  and  population  registration,  and  designing \nperformance-based  contracts  and  capitation  payment  mechanisms  for  proper  incentives.  A \nmonitoring  system  will  be  prepared  to  measure  the  impacts.  The  HSRP,  together  with  other \nsources , will train the staff of MOH, Ministry of Finance (MOF), regions, and pilot districts in the \nFGP system and  help  them  finalize  its  framework.  The  FGP  framework  will  be  tested  in  pilot \ndistricts.  \n   \n\n2. \n\nDrug Supply and Quality Control  \n\n \n27. \nEleven NGOs have been providing emergency drugs effectively through a supply system \nset up,  coordinated,  and  maintained  by  the  Pharmaciens  Sans  Fronti\u00e8res  (PSF).6 The public \nsupply system collapsed after independence and  has not been able to distribute any drugs for \nthe last 6 years. The Government intends to incorporate the humanitarian system in the national \nsystem ,  but  lacks  capacity  for  it.  Another  issue  is  uncontrolled  poor-quality  drugs.  The \nGovernment is unable to control  the  quality  of  drugs  that  come  into  the  country  from  a  wide \nrange of sources. Fake, counterfeit, and low-quality drugs have contributed to the prescription of \nmultiple drugs. The result is increased drug expense, developing drug resistance, and distrust of \nthe health sector among the population.       \n \n\na. \n\nEstablishing of an Efficient Drug Procurement Center \n\n \n28. \nThe  subcomponent  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  national  procurement  and \ndistribution system. A new drug  procurement center will be established with  the assistance of \nPSF. The HSRP will directly contract PSF to exploit its expertise in  building public capacity and \ntransferring responsibility for running the humanitarian supply system. Public capacity regarding \ndrug  supply  management will be strengthened  in (i)  the  procurement process: drug selection, \ntender management; (ii) distribution  and  management: need assessment, stock management, \ndistribution;  (iii)  storage:  warehouse  management,  working  protocols;  (iv)  software  for \nimplementing stock management; (v) training and retraining of health workers in pilot districts in \nstock  management;  and  (vii)  rational  planning  for  warehousing,  equipment  distribution,  and \nstaffing.   \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6  A summary of the pharmaceutical sector review is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n\n\f 8\n\nb. \n\nDeveloping a Drug Quality Control Mechanism  \n\n \n29.  Medicines must  meet  international quality requirements.  The  HSRP will strengthen the \ndrug  quality  control  center,  which  is  part  of  MOH,  by  (i)  assessing the current capacity  of the \ncenter  and  establishing  a  time-bound improvement plan; (ii)  providing  a regulatory framework \nand guidelines for drug quality control; (iii) providing a laboratory for drug quality monitoring with \nequipment,  reagents,  and  reference  literature; and  (iv)  guaranteeing  sustainability  through  a \ncost recovery mechanism for quality control services and capacity building for human resources. \nThe  drug  quality  control  center  will  receive  resources  to  improve  the  existing  equipment  and \nreagents  for  drug  analysis.  An  international  consultant  will  conduct  training  on  up-to-date \nmethods of drug quality analysis. Waste and reagent management will be addressed.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEfficient and Sustainable Delivery of a Pro-Poor Health Service Package  \n\n \n30. \nThis component will focus on enhancing the quality and increasing access to, and use of \nbasic health services especially among the poor, women, and children in the five HSRP districts. \nThe HSRP will finance and deliver the pro-poor service package reflecting MOH\u2019s reform plan. \nThe HSRP will train staff, provide equipment, and rehabilitate health facilities for the package to \nbe effectively used. Simultaneously,  the  HSRP  will  reform  the  service  delivery  and  financing \nmechanisms.  Although family  doctors  and  nurses  have  been  trained,  the  FGP  system  where \nthey  can  work has not  yet  been  set  up.  The  HSRP  will  introduce,  finance,  and  test  the  FGP- \nbased  PHC  system  as  developed  at  the  national  level.  FGP\u2019s  contractual  arrangements  and \ncapitation  rates  will  entail  incentives  for  pro-poor  and  efficient  service  delivery.  The  quality \ncontrol  of  FGP  services  and  ongoing  performance  and  impact  assessment  of  the  reformed \nsystem will be ensured. The  plan to  rationalize  excess  hospital  beds  will  be  implemented  in \nHSRP districts. Rationalization will bring savings that will be reallocated to the FGP system and \nPHC to increase the financial sustainability of the reformed system.  The pro-poor package and \nthe reformed system nationwide will be extended once the pilot activities prove successful. \n \n31. \nFor the first 2 years,  the  HSRP  will focus on capacity building and development of the \nsystem  framework  at  the  national,  regional,  and  pilot  district  levels.  Capacity  building  before \nimplementing reforms is important. Health departments will be created in HSRP districts to take \nfull-time responsibility for health sector planning, management, and reforms. Currently the chief \ndoctor  of  the  district  hospital  manages  district  health  programs  under  the  supervision  of  the \nregional  health  department.  District  health  departments  will  have  the  following  functions  in \naddition  to  implementing  and  administering  regular  district  health  programs:  (i)  monitor \nworkforce distribution,  FGP  system  implementation,  capitation  payments,  performance-based \ncontracts,  facility  functions,  caseloads  in  individual  facilities,  and  use  of  pharmaceuticals;  (ii) \noversee  of  rehabilitation  and  distribution  of  equipment;  (iii)  coordinate  and  manage  public \ninformation campaigns; and (iv) act as a conduit for community input into PHC management. \n \n32. \nFeasibility  studies  of  the  FGP  system  and  pro-poor  package  delivery  will  ensure \neffectiveness  and  sustainability.  A  critical  mass  of  FGPs  must  be  created  in  the  HSRP pilot \ndistricts.7 Actual delivery of the pro-poor health package though the FGP system will start in the \nthird year. The information campaigns will coincide with FGP system introduction. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n7   Currently only seven family doctors are working in the five pilot districts.  \n\n\f \n\n9\n\na. \n\nProviding of a Pro-Poor Health Service  Package  \n\ninterventions  and  delivery  strategies.  Roles  of  community  nurses \n\n \n33. \nThe  HSRP  will  provide  a standard  pro-poor health package, including basic drugs and \ncontraceptives, to FGPs and rural health centers in the pilot districts. The package will be free \nfor  patients.  The  package  is  part  of  the  guaranteed  health  package  proposed  by  MOH,  but  is \nmore focused  for service cost-effectiveness.  The  package  covers  basic  neonatal  care,  breast-\nfeeding,  growth  monitoring,  nutrition,  integrated  management  of  child  illness,  acute  respiratory \ndiseases, diarrhea, typhoid, school health, worms, contraceptives, safe motherhood (antenatal, \ndelivery,  and  postnatal  care),  sexually  transmitted  infections,  brucellosis,  and  hypertension.8 A \nlife-cycle  approach  will  be  considered  in  targeting  services.  Immunization  and  tuberculosis \ncontrol  are  important  contents  of  the  package,  and  are  financed  in parallel  by  UNICEF and \nUSAID. The HSRP will complement immunization and tuberculosis control by providing relevant \nequipment and training and raising awareness through public information campaigns.   \n \n34. \nStaff  of  FGPs,  rural  health  centers,  and  district  hospitals  will  be  trained  to  deliver  the \nservices in the standard pro-poor package. Roles of health staff will be defined in line with pro-\nin  providing \npoor \ncommunication and information services for  the population will be emphasized to increase  the \ndemand for health services and improve family health practices. An international consultant will \nset  up  quality  control  measures  for  FGP  services  covering  classroom  training,  on-the-job \ntraining,  and  impact  monitoring.  The  district  health  department  will  monitor  training  impacts.   \nThe  HSRP  will also  train  pharmacists  in  five  HSRP  districts on  Tajikistan\u2019s essential drug list, \ntreatment guidelines, clinical pharmacy and evidence-based medicine, stock management, and \nprocurement. The HSRP will create a critical mass of FGPs in HSRP pilot districts by retraining \nspecialists and mid-level personnel in family medicine through 6-month courses.  \n \n35. \nThe  HSRP  will  procure  basic  equipment  for  FGPs,  rural  health  centers,  and  central \ndistrict hospitals to provide quality services related to the pro-poor package. As the equipment \nwill be basic, recurrent costs will be manageable. The  HSRP will rehabilitate and rebuild PHC \nfacilities  according  to  district  rationalization  plans.  The  health  facility  and  FGP  mapping  to be \nconducted in the first year  will  be  a  basis  for  the  rationalization  plan  in  each  HSRP  district.  In \ntotal,  about  40  PHC  facilities  will  be  rehabilitated  or  rebuilt.  If  it  is  necessary  to  build  new \nfacilities, district administrations will screen  proposals  for any involuntary resettlement  effects \nand prepare  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement.  An  international  consultant  will  assist.  Civil  works  will  be  designed  according  to \nservices  provided  at  facilities,  actual  caseloads,  energy  efficiency,  provision  of  appropriate \ntechnical  services  such  as  telephones,  heating,  water,  and  sanitation  and  environmental \nrequirements. A medical waste  management plan and wastewater management measures will \nbe developed and implemented at the rehabilitated and rebuilt facilities.   \n\n \nb. \n\nReforming Service Delivery and Financing  \n\n \n36. \nThe HSRP will finance and test the capitation payment mechanism for paying the FGPs. \nMOH has proposed  capitation payment  in  the broader health  care  financing  reforms  and will \nformulate  the  capitation  method  and  the  contractual  arrangements  for  FGPs,  assisted  by \ninternational  consultants.  Performance-based  contracts  will  be  made  between  FGPs  and  the \ndistrict health departments established under the HSRP. The arrangements will be adjusted and \nintroduced at the district level after intensive meetings among international consultants, district \n\n                                                 \n8   The content of the package with delivery strategies is explained in Supplementary Appendix C. The list of drugs \n\nand equipment to implement the package are explained in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n \n\n\f 10\n\nand  region  administrations,  and  MOH.  Capitation  rates  will  be  higher  for  infants,  women  of \nreproductive age, and the aged, while the contract will stipulate in detail  services for the poor, \nwomen,  and  children.  The  monitoring  system  will  assess  FGP\u2019s  performance  and  impacts, \nincluding access to basic health services by the poor, women, and children.     \n \n37. \nThe  HSRP will rationalize the health  system  and  staffing  distribution  in  pilot  districts  to \nreflect the national plans and reallocate savings to finance the FGP  system, PHC, and the pro-\npoor health package. Under the current input-based budget allocation scheme, reduced hospital \nbeds and staff imply lower budget allocations and act as a disincentive to  rationalization. MOF \nclaims  the  savings  from  rationalization.  An  agreement  will  be  made  with  MOF  so  that district \nhealth  departments  will  be  entitled  to  keep  those  savings  and  not  suffer  any  corresponding \nreduction in their budgets from rationalization. District health departments will produce proposals \ndemonstrating the savings  to  be  achieved and presenting a  business  plan  for  using the saved \nresources. The HSRP will help district health departments design the business plan.   \n \n38. \nThe  HSRP  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  region  and  district  administrations  to \nmanage  the  reformed  system,  rationalize  hospitals,  plan the  budget,  and  monitor  all.  District \nhealth  department staff in each pilot  district will  be  trained  intensively  in  management,  health \ncare financing, health sector reform, and HMIS. The  HMIS based on the framework developed \nunder the associated TA  will be set up and  implemented in the pilot  districts. HMIS data will be \ncollected  routinely  and  surveys  will  be  conducted  for  monitoring  reforms.  The  survey  data  will \ncomplement and verify the quality of HMIS  data at the national level. The initial in-depth survey \nwill be designed and conducted under the associated TA. Staff at all levels of the health system \nin the pilot districts will be trained to collect, analyze, and use data. \n \n39. \nThe  HSRP  will  help  district  administrations  conduct  public information campaigns and \nmobilize  community  participation  to raise awareness and understanding  of  health  reforms, the \nFGP-based PHC system, and major health problems. Campaigns will be conducted with the full \nparticipation  of  local  governments,  communities,  and  local  NGOs.  MOH  will  supervise  and \ncoordinate campaigns on major health problems (diarrhea, tuberculosis, typhoid), reproductive \nhealth, sexually  transmitted  infections  and  HIV/AIDS9 control,  health  promotion  based  on  the \nlife-cycle approach, health care reform, and the introduction of the free pro-poor health package.  \nInformation on the purposes, content, and benefits of the reformed system are critical messages \nof the campaigns. The campaigns will be designed to reach the poor and women as their lack of \ninformation  on  health  services  is  one  of  the  barriers  that  keep  them  from  accessing services. \nLocal government staff will be trained to organize campaigns and mobilize communities.   \n \nC. \n \n40. \nTajikistan in  the postconflict period faces complex development challenges: volatile and \nunstable security, fluid coalition Government, uncertain political commitment, limited institutional \ncapacity,  governance  concerns,  and  years  in  a  development  vacuum.  Involvement  of \nhumanitarian  and  grant-based agencies has contributed to  creating  dependency  expectations \nand have established duplicate systems that parallel national and local structures. Development \nagencies  have  not  been  active  for  security  and  governance  reasons.  Changes  in  services \ndelivery, management, and financing of the health sector are required, but difficult in a context \nwhere changes take place slowly. The  HSRP will focus on capacity building across the health \nsector and reforms at the PHC level.  The HSRP will support the national drug supply  system in \n\nSpecial Features \n\n                                                 \n9   HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ncollaboration  with  humanitarian  NGOs  that  have  been  implementing  the  efficient  drug  supply \nsystem to prevent its collapse after their withdrawal.     \n \n41. \nTajikistan  is also a transition economy where  the move from rigid central planning  to a \nmore  open  market  environment  has  created  many  new  challenges  to  the  health system. To \ncope  with  these  challenges,  the  HSRP  supports  policy  and  institutional  reforms  including  (i) \nreorienting  health  service  delivery  from  hospital-based  and  cure-biased  to  PHC,  (ii)  shifting \nprovider  payment  mechanisms  from  fixed  salary  to  capitation  payment  with  pro-poor  and \nefficiency incentives, (iii) refocusing budget preparation from norm-based to per capita allocation, \nand (iv) accelerating system rationalization. \n        \nD. \n \n42. \nThe total cost of  the  HSRP  is  estimated  at  $9.375  million  equivalent,  of  which  $5.340 \nmillion,  or  57%,  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost.  The  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at  $4.035 \nmillion equivalent or 43% of the total cost.  The costs are summarized in Table 2, with details in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n\nCost Estimates  \n\nTable 2: Cost Estimates, by Component  \n($ million) \n\n \nCost by Component \n \nA. Base Cost \n\n1.

Interest Charge  \n  \nTotal Cost \n Source:  Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nE. \n \n43. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $7.5 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources to finance 80% of the total project cost. The ADB loan will be repayable over 32 years \nwith a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  The Borrower will be Tajikistan. ADB will fund 100% of \nthe  foreign  exchange  cost,  totaling  57%  of  the  estimated  project  cost,  and  54%  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $1.875  million  equivalent  as \ncounterpart financing,  which  accounts  for  20%  of  the  total  cost.  This  includes  financing  civil \nworks;  taxes  and  duties;  training,  workshops,  surveys,  studies;  and  other  recurrent  costs.  The \nfinancial plan is in Table 3. \n \nIn  view  of  the  difficult  debt  situation,  the  Government  has  requested  that  costs  for \n44. \nconsultants,  project  management,  and  training  be  reduced  or  grants  attracted  for  these \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 12\n\n \n\nactivities, noting pledges made at the recent  consultative group meeting (CG). 10 ADB has been \nactively seeking grants to substitute for some of the loan proceeds. The HSRP has been broken \ndown  into  self-contained  packages  based  on  the  conceptual  framework  and  proposed  to \nsources for cofinancing (Appendix 8). If grant funds are firmly committed, corresponding savings \nunder the loan may be reallocated or cancelled. \n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n($ million) \n5.340 \n0.000 \n5.340 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n($ million) \n2.160 \n1.875 \n4.035 \n\nTotal \nCost \n($ million) \n7.500 \n1.875 \n9.375 \n\nShare (%) \n\n \n\n80  \n  20 \n100 \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n\nTotal \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n \n1. \n\nProject Management and Implementation Period \n\n \nThe  HSRP  will  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  proposed  ESRP.  The  President\u2019s \n45. \nOffice will be the  Executing  Agency, with the  deputy  prime  minister  as  project coordinator for \nboth  HSRP  and  ESRP.  A  national  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  give  overall \nguidance and coordinate both projects. The committee will be chaired by the project coordinator \nand composed of senior officials from MOH,  Ministry of Education,  MOF, and regions, and pilot \ndistricts. Both projects will work in the same pilot districts. The national steering committee will \nmeet quarterly. It will approve the annual HSRP budget and activity plan and review and advise \non implementation progress. Task teams will be established at MOH  for key areas, e.g.,  health \ncare financing (use of the existing one), human resource development, FGP system, and HMIS. \n \n46. \nA project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  set  up  in  MOH  with  a  project manager and \ntwo other full-time staff. In full consultation with MOH, the PIU will make a detailed annual plan, \ndevelop the time frame, decide on procurement of consultants, select fellowships, and monitor \npilot district activities. A  project administration unit (PAU) will be set up  in Dushanbe, based on \nthe  existing  SSRP  structure,  under  PIU.  The  PAU  will  serve  as  a  secretariat  to  provide \nadministrative support for procurement, consultant recruitment, and disbursement; and monitor \nand  report  on  progress  against  indicators.  The  PAU  head  will  be  assisted  by  staff  for \nadministration, accounting, monitoring, procurement/civil works, and interpretation.  \n \n47. \nEach pilot district will have a district supervisory group, shared by the ESRP, comprising \nrepresentatives  of  the  district  governor\u2019s  office,  district  departments  of  health  and  education, \nvillage  leaders,  schools,  feldshers,  FGPs,  health  centers, and hospitals.  The  group  will  guide \nand  coordinate  district  activities.  Each  pilot  district  will  have  a  district  PIU  for  the  HSRP, \ncomprising  a  district  project  coordinator,  a  reform  officer,  and  an  administrator.  Project \nmanagement  and  monitoring  capacities  at  PAU,  PIU,  and  district  PIU  will  be  strengthened \nthrough  staff  training.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  described  in  Appendix  9.  The \n\n                                                 \n10 At the CG meeting in May 2003, aid agencies  pledged $900 million, including $700 million grants  for over a 3-year \nperiod. Aid agencies  and the Government noted that it would be preferable to finance social sectors by grants to \nthe extent possible. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nHSRP  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  2004  to  2008.  Appendix  10  gives  the \nimplementation schedule. \n \n48.  Mobilizing  parallel  grant  funds  in  response  to  the  Government's  request  will  result  in  a \nvariety  of  financing  sources  and  will  impose  an  additional  degree  of  difficulty  in  implementing \nand coordinating the HSRP. To complement the roles of the PAU and  the PIU, an effective aid \ncoordination mechanism will be set up. \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n49. \nGoods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2018s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Equipment  will  be  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding \n(ICB)  for  contracts  in  excess  of  $500,000,  international  shopping  for  contracts  in  excess  of \n$100,000, and direct purchase for contracts valued at less than $100,000. Civil works valued in \nexcess of $1 million will be awarded through ICB and civil works contracts valued at or less than \n$1 million will be awarded under local competitive bidding (LCB), in accordance with procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The indicative contract  packages are in Appendix 11.  In accordance with \nADB  procedures,  eligible  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  the  bid  for  contracts  through \nLCB. ADB\u2019s domestic preference scheme may be applied when evaluating bids under ICB. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n50. \nA total of 164 person-months of consulting services (48 person-months international and \n106  domestic)  will  be  required  for  the  HSRP  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic consultants. The \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  individually  (for  project  management  and  for  specific  technical \nexpertise) or through a firm. Quality and cost-based selection will be applied to  a firm. Detailed \ncosting  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  The  outline  of  terms  of  reference  for  consulting \nservices are in Appendix 12. The indicative training program is in Supplementary Appendix F.   \n \n\n4. \n\nDirect Contracting of Pharmaciens sans Fronti\u00e8res (PSF) \n\n \nPSF  will  be  directly  selected 11  to  support  the  establishment  of  an  efficient  drug \n51. \nprocurement center by transferring its experience and knowledge to  the Government. PSF has \nbeen  operating  the  humanitarian  drug  supply  system  in  Tajikistan  since  1994  and  has \ncoordinated  all  major  NGOs\u2019  drug  distribution.  A  lump  sum  contract  will  be  implemented  with \nquarterly  progress  payments  made  contingent  on  satisfactory  contractor  performance.  The \ncontract will specify objectively measurable service delivery goals, a minimal acceptable level of \nimprovement, and penalties that will be incurred if these levels are not met.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n52. \nThe PAU will establish an imprest account in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB to \nexpedite  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement \nHandbook dated January 2001 and detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. \nThe  Government  may  make  withdrawals  from  the  imprest  account  for  PAU/PIU staff costs; \ntraining,  seminars,  and  studies;  locally  available  material;  domestic  consultants;  rationalization \nincentives;  and  civil  works  contracts  under  LCB.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the \nimprest  account  will  not  exceed  $250,000.  Procedures  from  ADB\u2019s  statement of  expenditure \n\n                                                 \n11  Terms of reference for the PSF are included in Appendix 12 and a draft contract is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n \n\n\f 14\n\n(SOE) will be followed  to liquidate the imprest account and reimburse individual SOE payments \nthat do not exceed $50,000 \n \n\n6. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit \n\n \n53. \nThe PIU together with the PAU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation \nin line with ADB\u2019s project performance report and submit them to ADB within 30 days after the \nend of the applicable period. Within 3 months after physical completion, PIU will submit a project \ncompletion  report  to  the  ADB.  The  PAU  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  all \nexpenditures  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nprinciples.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the  project  accounts,  including  financial \nstatements. SOEs, and imprest account records annually. The audit report will be submitted to \nADB in English not later than 6 months after the fiscal year to which it relates. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System \n\n \nThe  President\u2019s  Office,  MOH,  PIU,  and  PAU  will  establish  a  project  performance \n54. \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  (PPMES),  acceptable  to  ADB.  PPMES  aims  to  (i) review \nHSRP technical performance; (ii) evaluate the delivery of planned activities; (iii) measure HSRP \nimpacts;  (iv)  measure  social  and  economic  benefits  with  a  focus  on  the  poor,  women,  and \nchildren;  and  (v)  monitor  achievement  of  MDGs.  PPMES  indicators  will  be  used  in  preparing \nreports on project implementation and the reform process covering fiscal impacts, improved use \nof  resources,  change  in  access  to  services,  improved  services  quality,  cost  savings  from \nrationalization, and client satisfaction. Routine HMIS and special surveys financed by the HSRP \nwill  supply  PPMES  with  information.  Where  feasible,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by \nsocioeconomic levels and sex.  The  HSRP  will  assist  the  President\u2019s  Office,  PIU,  and  PAU  to \nfinalize indicators and the monitoring  system during HSRP inception. A close link among MDG, \nPPMES, and HMIS will be ensured. Appendix 13 shows an indicative list of PPMES indicators. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n55. \nThe technical assistance (TA) will support developing management information systems \nfor  informed  policy  dialogue,  decision making, and monitoring.  The  TA  will  serve  as  a  central \npolicy  tool  to  improve  MOH\u2019s  planning,  budgeting,  and  reform  for  the  health  sector.  The \nobjectives are to (i) develop the HMIS  framework and action plans at MOH, region, and district \nlevels;  (ii)  lay  the  basis  for  planning,  monitoring,  and  measuring  system  performance  and \nreforms;  and  (iii)  create  a  mechanism  for  monitoring  and  policy  dialogue  between  the \nGovernment and aid agencies. The TA will conduct an in-depth survey in pilot districts to obtain \nan  accurate  and  disaggregated  baseline  database  for  the  health  sector.  The  TA  will  finance \nconsultants  (7  person-months  international,  14  person-months  domestic)  with  expertise  in \nsurveys,  poverty,  and  HMIS.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  12  months.  More  detailed \ninformation on the TA is in Appendix 14. Consultants will be engaged  individually or through a \nfirm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n56. \nThe  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA is estimated to cost $355,000 equivalent, comprising $169,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $186,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $300,000  to \nfinance  the  entire  foreign  currency  expenditures  and  $131,000  equivalent  of  local  currency \nexpenditures. The Government will provide the remaining $55,000 equivalent in kind. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nA second TA will develop a drug procurement and distribution strategy. The strategy will \n57. \ncover all aspects of the procurement and distribution process, namely: selecting drugs, ensuring \nquality, managing the tender process, distributing drugs, managing stocks, and monitoring drug \nuse and  prices.  The  objectives are to (i)  support policy dialogue and develop  a clear strategy \nand framework for establishing a drug procurement and distribution system, supported by action \nplans at MOH,  region, and district levels; (ii) prepare a rational plan for warehousing, equipment \ndistribution,  and  staffing;  and  (iii)  supply  operational  guidelines  on  the  above  procurement \nprocess.  Support  for  developing  strategies  to  strengthen  public  drug  procurement  and \ndistribution capacity is urgently needed to ensure the continuation of an adequate and reliable \nsupply  of  quality  drugs  when  assistance  from  humanitarian  agencies  ends.  The  private  sector \ncurrently does not have the capacity and lacks an appropriate legal framework to assume these \nresponsibilities immediately. The TA will fill the vacuum created by private sector absence and a \nlack  of  public  sector  capacity,  while  proposing  long-term  development  strategies  to  increase \nprivate  sector  involvement,  including  public-private  partnerships,  in  drug  procurement  and \ndistribution. The TA will finance consultants (4 person-months international, 18  person-months \ndomestic) with expertise in drug procurement. The TA will be implemented over 6 months. More \ndetailed information is in Appendix 15. PSF will be directly engaged (para. 50).  \n \n58. \n The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA is estimated to cost $180,000 equivalent, comprising $114,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $66,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $150,000  to \nfinance  the  entire  foreign  currency  expenditures  and  $36,000  equivalent  of  local  currency \nexpenditures. The Government will provide the remaining $30,000 equivalent in kind.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \nThe HSRP addresses both immediate needs and long-term sustainability. It responds to \n59. \nthe most urgent health needs of  the poor and vulnerable, while making a positive impact on  the \ncurrent weak health care system and increasing access to and use of basic health services. The \nHSRP will improve people\u2019s health\u2014especially that of the poor, women, and children\u2014in five of \nthe poorest districts, covering approximately 5.5% of Tajikistan\u2019s population of 6.3 million. The \ntargeted districts have high infant and maternal mortality rates. The HSRP will focus on the most \naccessible  health  care  levels  and  will  pilot-test  the  FGP-based  PHC  system.  The  PHC  is  an \ninternationally  proven  cost-effective  method  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  the  poor,  women, and \nchildren.  The  FGP  system  benefits  the  poor  and  vulnerable  better  than  any  other  service \ndelivery modalities.  Considering  the  results  of  the  pilot  testing,  the  system  will  be  expanded \nnationwide, disseminating the benefits gained through the HSRP. \n \nTo  strengthen  equity,  efficiency,  and  sustainability  of  the  health  sector,  the  HSRP will \n60. \nbuild MOH\u2019s capacity to effectively plan and manage the health sector and to pursue reforms. In \nparticular, the HSRP will support reforms in health service delivery and financing. In  reforming \nthe systems,  the  HSRP will especially challenge the situation  where  patients currently finance \nabout 80%  of  the  total  health  expenditure,  while  the  Government  contributes  about  5%,  thus \nputting the financial burden on the poor. \n \nB. \n \n61. \nThe successful    implementation  of  the  reform-oriented  HSRP  depends  largely  on  the \ncapacity of  the  local  governments  and  MOH.  The  HSRP  will  strengthen  MOH\u2019s capacity  to \n\nProject Risks \n\n \n\n\f 16\n\nanalyze situations and develop reform strategies and action plans. HMIS will be set up to plan, \nmonitor, and evaluate the reform. \n \n62. \nRisks  in  project  management  relate  to  the  limited  capacity  of  line ministries  and their \nstaff. The presence of  experienced staff and committed government officials is key  to smooth \nproject  implementation.  This  risk  will  be  managed  by  continuously  involving  a   deputy  prime \nminister in the President\u2019s Office, using an implementation structure based on the ADB SSRP \nframework,  providing  capacity-building  support,  and  engaging  experienced  domestic  and \ninternational  consultants.  Involvement  of  the  President's  Office  and  shared  implementation \narrangements  with  the  ESRP,  based  on  an  experienced  PAU,  offset  to  some  degree  the \ncomplicated  implementation  arrangements  and  risks,  aggravated  by  the  Government's \nreluctance to borrow for training, consulting services, and project management. These activities \nare at the minimum level feasible and any further attempt to prune them may pose a serious risk \nto project implementability.  \n \n63. \nThe changes being introduced in health services delivery require changes in attitudes of \nstaff and clients and a change in management style. The HSRP will invest in public information \ncampaigns  to  elicit  public  perceptions  on  responsive  health  systems  and  will  strengthen \nmanagement. \n \nFinancial sustainability of the HSRP depends on the financial sustainability of the health \n64. \nsector in Tajikistan  itself.  Efficient  and  sustainable  delivery  of  a  pro-poor  service  package, a \nmajor HSRP component, will involve a  profound change in the current health  budget allocation \nmechanism  in  Tajikistan  and  require  an  increase  in  the  allocation  to  PHC.  Financial \nsustainability  means  that  the  reforms  introduced  by  the  HSRP  should  continue  beyond  the  5 \nyears  life  span  of  the  HSRP, and  this  continuity  must  rely  on  Government  resources.  In  this \nsense, the HSRP aims to improve the government\u2019s capacity to develop and maintain reforms in \nits health financing system and to reform health service delivery. \n \n65. \nThe low level of public expenditure on health is explained by the  low level of economic \ndevelopment,  low  relative  priority  given  to  the  health  sector,  and  the  poor  capacity  of  the \nGovernment to raise revenues.  In Tajikistan the total revenue from taxes has remained around \n11% of the GDP, a very low level of tax collection (revenue collected as a percentage of GDP in \nlow-income countries is 14% on average). It is hard to expect a significant raise in the economy, \nhealth  sector  priority,  and  tax  revenue  in  the  short  term.  The  baseline  scenario  for  planning \nhealth financing is that the health share of the public budget will not increase significantly. While \nit  is  necessary  to  increase  resource  allocations  for  health,  it  is  also  vital  to  assure  that  the \nmoney spent achieves the best possible results and health gains. That efficiency concerns have \nto  penetrate  the  system  is  one  of  the  major  targets  of  the  HSRP  in  capacity  building, \nrationalization, and reforms. If the required changes do not materialize under the HSRP or are \nnot sustained, there will be failure of  not only the financial sustainability of  the  HSRP but  also \nthat of the entire health system as well. The Government must sustain its commitment to PHC. \nThe  HSRP  will  intensify  policy  dialogue  in  pursuing  capacity  building,  rationalization,  and \nreforms as well as in giving priority to the health sector. \n \nC. \n \n66. \nThe HSRP has been classified in  category B for environmental impact. The summary of \nthe initial environmental examination is in Appendix 16.12 The HSRP will rehabilitate and rebuild \n                                                 \n12  The full Summary of the Initial Environmental Examination is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n\nEnvironment \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nSocial Analysis \n\nhospitals and  health  centers  in  five  districts.  Environmental  benefits  will  be  realized  through \nimproved medical waste management and wastewater disposal.  The HSRP will (i) ensure that \nappropriate  environmental measures are put  in  place,  (ii)  organize training  for  health workers \nand  local  governments  on  medical  waste  management, (iii)  set  up  an  environment monitoring \nmechanism, and (iv)  improve wastewater and  reagent  management  at  the  drug  quality  center \nwhen reagents are provided for drug quality analysis. Guidelines for reagent management will \nbe prepared, training organized, and environmental monitoring done.  \n \nD. \n \n67. \nThe  HSRP aims to increase equity  and  effectiveness  in  distributing  health  benefits  in \nTajikistan by focusing on  five districts disadvantaged by recent natural disasters,  the civil war, \npoverty, and health status. For the poor, women, and children who are also specific foci,  HSRP \nwill use health  measures  that are internationally proven.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy form is in Appendix 17.  \n \nPoverty  remains  the  central  development  issue  in  Tajikistan.  The  Tajikistan  Living \n68. \nStandards Survey reported that 83% of the  population lined below the poverty line in 1999.  The \nsurvey also revealed that poverty rates were high for households with many children and those \nheaded  by  women,  the  unemployed,  persons  without  access  to  any  social  safety  net  (the \ndisabled, school dropouts, street children, and  the  elderly),  single  pensioners, and returnees \nand  internally  displaced  population.  Geographically,  rural  areas  particularly  in  remote \nmountainous  areas,  have  more  and  deeper  poverty.  The  HSRP  will  target  poor  areas, \nparticularly, mountainous districts, to ensure access to health services.  \n \n69. \nThe  HSRP is also designed to respond effectively to the poor\u2019s health-seeking behavior \nand health conditions. Thus, the HSRP will address the most important health problems of the \npopulation,  particularly  the  poor,  and  make  it  easier  for  them  to  use  the  necessary  health \nservices.  Despite  the generally  worse health outcomes,  the  poor  do  not  recognize  their  poor \nhealth as reflected in the low percentage of people who report illness in surveys. Many do not \nseek health services until conditions become very serious and rely on self-medication. Surveys \nindicate that  use of health services by the poor is about half of that  by the  non-poor. The poor \nare  more  likely  to  suffer  from  infectious  diseases,  maternal  and  child  health  problems,  and \nmalnutrition. Financial burden is the major factor preventing the poor from using health services. \nLack of information or ignorance is also a concern. Information that the public sector provides to \nthe poor is limited.  The  HSRP will supply the pro-poor health package free by  considering the \npoor\u2019s  priority  health  problems  and  the  cost-effectiveness of  health  services.  To  deliver  the \npackage, the  HSRP will develop the FGP system that is considered the most pro-poor delivery \nmethod.  Information  will  be  disseminated  to  reach  the  poor.  The  HSRP  expects  to  bring the \npoor\u2019s use of health services to the same level as that of the non-poor and reduce the burden of \npoverty-related diseases.  \n \n70. \nReproductive  health  is  a  major  concern  in  Tajikistan.  High  birth  rates,  high  rates  of \nmaternal  and  infant  mortality,  large  numbers  of  abortions,  and  rising  prevalence  of  sexually \ntransmitted infections all contribute to low women\u2019s health status. The situation is compounded \nby the growing incidence of informal charges for health care services.  The perceived  financial \nburden is particularly high among women seeking reproductive  health services: 80% of women \nof  reproductive  age  who  were  not  pregnant  cited  cost  as  the  main  reason  for  not  using \ncontraceptives; 60% of pregnant women who do not obtain antenatal care think that they cannot \nafford it. Poor women increasingly give birth at home without medical assistance to reduce the \ncosts  associated  with  childbirth.  About  half  of  all  births  in  1998  were  delivered  at  home.  If  the \n\n \n\n\f 18\n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis \n\npro-poor  package  including  antenatal  and  delivery  care,  family  planning,  and  treatment  of \nsexually transmitted infections is used effectively,  the HSRP will reduce the number of women \nwithout access to reproductive health by more than half. \n \nThe  Republic  of  Tajikistan  is  composed  of  a  number  of  cultural  groups.  Tajiks  have \n71. \nincreased  from  56.2%  of  the  population  in  1970  to  62.3%  in  1989.  Ethnic  groups  are  widely \ndistributed throughout the country, although locally some clustering tends to occur.  No specific \ndata is available on the health  and education  status  of  ethnic  minority  groups.  All  understand \nand speak the Tajik language and there are health workers and teachers from minority groups. \nThe constitution of Tajikistan states that no person  will be discriminated against on the basis of \nethnic origin, and minorities are guaranteed equal access to education and health. According to \nNGOs  working  in  the  HSRP  pilot  districts,  ethnic  minorities  are  well  integrated  in  society and \nhave the same level of health and education status, with the exception of elderly Russians. The \nHSRP is classified in Category C in terms of indigenous people.  \n \nE. \n \n72. \nImproved  people\u2019s health status  with  the  HSRP  can  be  quantified  in  economic terms. \nThe economic benefits will result from resource cost savings, representing a reduction in out-of-\npocket  expenses,  and  productivity  gains.  The  HSRP  will  reform  health  service  delivery  and \nfinancing  mechanisms  to  promote  system  efficiency  and  service  quality.  The  proposed  FGP \nsystem has operational advantages and would be more cost-effective, compared with the NGO-\nrun  health  system  (Appendix  6). It will also  provide  incentives  for  providers  to  serve  the  poor, \nwomen, and children. Service users will receive effective services with reduced risk of informal \npayments. Community mobilization and  strengthened monitoring will reinforce the supervisory \nfunctions  over  service  quality  and  payment.  In  addition,  HSRP\u2019s  free  pro-poor health service \npackage, including drugs, will constitute a substantial economic benefit itself, given the level of \nprivate  expenditure  on  drugs.  More  effective  services,  reduced  informal  payment,  and  free \ndrugs will substantially contribute to resource cost savings. \n \n73. \nProductivity  gains  will  result  from  fewer  days  lost  because  of  illness  and  a  consequent \nincrease  in  productivity.  HSRP  will  provide  cost-effective measures  to  reduce  IMR,  MRM, and \nunder-5 mortality corresponding to MDG by  30% in HSRP districts. The economic internal rate \nof  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  to  be  around  24.1%.  HSRP  has  a  potential  to  directly  benefit \napproximately  350,000 people in pilot  districts  and  will  generate  further  benefits  for  the  whole \ncountry. Sensitivity analysis shows that the strongest factor influencing economic returns is the \nextension  of  the  benefits  by  expanding  reformed  system s  nationwide.  The  results  of  the \nsensitivity  analysis  call  attention  to  the  need  for  keeping  a  nationwide  perspective  and  for \nextracting valuable lessons from the pilot regions to be applied to the whole country. Analysis of \nthe financial sustainability of nationwide establishment of the FGP system indicates that the total \npublic  health  budget  must  be  increased  to  1.5%  of  GDP.  This  percentage  represents  a \nsubstantive  increase from  the  current  level  of  0.9%,  but  is  still  well  below  the  3%  observed  in \nother Central Asian republics (Appendix 6).  MOF plans to increase the public health allocations \nto  1.8%  of  GDP  (as  indicated  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A)  to  increase  the chances of FGP \nsystem  sustainability.  The  HSRP  will  undertake  policy  dialogue  to  ensure  that  the  increase  is \nrealized. \n \n74. \nThe  analysis  also  evaluated  the  HSRP  impact  on  the  Government  budget.  The \nGovernment\u2019s annual share in project costs will average around $0.38 million, about 2.8% of the \nhealth  sector  annual  budget  of  about  $13.5  million.  The  recurrent  costs  borne  by  the \nGovernment during the  HSRP  are  about  $0.18  million  per  year.  The  budgetary  impact  of  the \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nestimated  annual  recurrent  costs  during  and  after  HSRP  implementation  is  considered \nmanageable. The detailed economic and financial analyses are in Appendix 18. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n75. \nassurances , which are incorporated in the legal document. \n  \n\n1. \n\nProject Implementation and Monitoring \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nA  distinct  supervisory  group  will  have  been  established  in  each  HSRP  district, \n\n \n76. \nacceptable to ADB, within 3 months of loan effectiveness  \n \n77.  MOH and MOF will agree to establish in each pilot district a district PIU  that will cover \nthe roles of the district health department, within 3 months of loan effectiveness  \n \nThe  President\u2019s Office, MOH,  and  HSRP  district  governments  will  finalize  the  PPMES \n78. \nindicators,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  integrate  these  into  HMIS  within  6  months  of  loan \neffectiveness date. Indicators of the poor\u2019s access to and use of essential health services will be \nincluded. Impact indicators will contribute to monitoring the achievement of MDGs. \n \n\n2. \n\nReform  Planning,  Monitoring,  and  Policy  Dialogue  Based  on  Health \nManagement Information System \n\n \n79. \nAn  intersectoral  committee  (MOH,  MOF,  medical  university,  and  aid  agencies)  will be \ncreated  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness  to  review  and  use  the  HMIS  data  to  plan  and \nmonitor the reform process and to maintain policy dialogue with aid agencies on reform.  \n \n\n3. \n\nHuman Resource Development \n\n \n80.  MOH  and  the  medical  university  will  develop  a  workforce  plan  and  targets  within  15 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness.  MOH  will  develop  a  time-bound action plan to meet workforce \ntargets on staff reduction and equitable distribution of staff; the medical university will develop a \ntime-bound action plan on student intake and outputs consistent with the workforce plan, within \n21 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n\n4. \n\nIntroducing the FGP System in the HSRP Districts \n\n \n81.  MOH will develop the legal and financial framework of the FGP system to be pilot-tested \nin the HSRP districts within 18 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n The Government should legalize, as a pilot test, the introduction of the FGP system with \n82. \na financial and monitoring package in the HSRP districts within 21 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe package  covers  FGP  geographical  mapping;  population  registration;  capitation  payment; \nperformance-based contracts; monitoring of access to and use of FGP services by the general \npopulation,  particularly  the  poor,  women  of  reproductive  age,  infants,  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups; user satisfac tion; and FGP\u2019s performance. \n \n\n5. \n\nRationalizing System and Staffing in HSRP Districts \n\n \n83. \nThe local government of the HSRP districts, together with MOH, will develop and adopt \nplans, acceptable to ADB, for  rationalizing  excess  health  facilities  and  hospital beds and  poor \n\n \n\n\f 20\n\nstaff distribution in the HSRP districts within 21 months of loan effectiveness. The plans will be \nimplemented from year 3 of the HSRP. \n \n\n6. \n\nFinancial Matters \n\n \n84.  MOF will issue decrees to allow local governments to keep and reuse the district health \nbudget  savings  from  system  rationalization  and  to  allow  local  governments  to  reallocate  the \nhealth workforce at their discretion and as appropriate to the health system in the HSRP districts, \nwithin 1 month of loan effectiveness. \n \n85.  MOH and MOF  will  agree  to  provide\u2014after  the  HSRP\u2019s  completion\u2014through its public \nhealth budget the capitation payment budget and the pro-poor health package cost introduced \nby the HSRP to ensure their sustainability. The  Government will submit a budget plan covering \ncapitation payment and the pro-poor package by the midterm review of the HSRP. \n \n86. \nThroughout project implementation, ADB will continue the policy dialogue with MOH and \nMOF  to  increase  the  share  of  public  health  expenditure  devoted  to  PHC  from  6%  in  2003  to \n20%  by  the  end  of  2008.  MOH  and  MOF  will  provide  baseline  data  of  the  budget  allocation \namong the levels of the health system within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n\n7. \n\nEnvironmental Measures and Other Safeguards \n\n \n87. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  environmental  classification  will  be  conducted  for \neach  subproject  and  IEE  will  be  prepared,  if  necessary,  during  civil  works  surveys,  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines;  (ii)  an  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP)  covering  medical  waste  will  be  developed  and  implemented  corresponding  to the laws \nand  procedures  of  the  Government  and  the  environmental  requirements  presented  in  the \nsummary  IEE  in  Appendix  16;  and  (iii)  a  report  on  the  progress  of  EMP  will  be  submitted \nsemiannually. \n \n88. \nIf it becomes necessary to build new facilities under the HSRP, the district administration \nwill  screen  for  any  involuntary  resettlement  effects  and  prepare  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plans, in line with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n89. \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial Drawing Rights  5,238,000  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan for the Health Sector  Reform \nProject  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident\n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n \n20 November 2003 \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\nHEALTH SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n\nManagement Structure and Function \n\n1. \nLarge-scale changes in  the  political  and  economic  environment  over  the  decade  have \ncreated  many  new  challenges  to  the  health  care  system  in  Tajikistan.  But  little  has  changed \nsince Soviet times and the health system is unable to protect the health of the population.   \n \nA. \n \nThe Government remains the main public financier and provider of health care services. \n2. \nThere are five main levels of management: the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Health \n(MOH), region and Dushanbe health departments, chief doctors of central district hospitals who \nare  responsible  for  district  health  services,  and  facility  managers.  MOF  budgets and transfers \nthe  funds  to  regional  administrations.  The  budget  allocation  is  based  on  norms,  such  as \nnumbers  of  beds  and  staff,  rather  than  on  outputs.  Norms  have  not  been  revised  since \nindependence. MOH sets up health policies but has no control over the health budget, nor over \npolicy execution.  A considerable degree of autonomy in the use of approved resources is given \nto local administrations at the district level. Local governments may use the resources according \nto  the  approved  plan,  but  could  use  them  differently.  MOH  can\u2019t  ensure  whether  the  health \nbudget has been executed properly or not.  \n \nDespite overall responsibility for health care delivery at the district level, a district health \n3. \ndepartment  does  not  exist,  but  a  chief  doctor  of  the  central  district  hospital  manages  it. \nManagement of primary health care (PHC) by hospital staff creates a conflict of interest, such as \nthe  priority  given  to  hospital  budget  allocations  rather  than  to  PHC.  Budgets  throughout  the \nsystem  are  based  on  11  line  items  and  facility  managers  cannot  transfer  funds,  giving  no \nflexibility to lower-level managers. The current system lacks incentives for quality or efficiency. \nDue to the collapsed information system,  managers at the national level have no accurate data \non which to base their decisions, while those at the field level who face real situations have no \nauthority to introduce changes.  \n \n4. \nInstitutional capacity to effectively plan, budget, manage, and  monitor the health sector \nis  weak  at  all  levels.  This  capacity  was  not  required  before  independence, as decisions were \nmade  in  Moscow.  Capacity  building  efforts  and  opportunities  for  exposure  to  efficient \nmanagement  have  been  limited  for  several  reasons:  limited developmental work and capacity \nbuilding  by  external  agencies  under  emergency  situations,  and  the  Government\u2019s  limited \nrecognition  of  the  need  for  increased  capacity  and  learning  alternative  health  system \nmanagement.  \n \nB. \n \nPHC  is  provided  by  community  nurses,  midwives,  nurses,  and  doctors  in  a  range  of \n5. \nfacilities.  The  health  care  delivery  system  inherited  from  the  former Soviet Union is extensive, \ncomplex,  and  fragmented  at  all  levels. It is also costly. PHC is provided in cities at  polyclinics \nthat are fragmented, with separate clinics for adults, children, and women\u2019s reproductive health; \nin specialized dispensaries, and in health posts of universities. In rural areas, PHC facilities are \nmore complicated and consist of  medical houses, the rural health centers, and rural hospitals. \nAbout  2,670  PHC  facilities  exist  in  the  country.  The  high  degree  of  specializations  of  doctors \nand  nurses  adds  complications  and  makes  actual  services  to  patients  inefficient.  There  are \nabout  125  specialties.  To  provide  care  to  the  broad  community,  a  number  of  specialists  of \ndifferent disciplines are present even at the PHC level. Health  resources are used in providing \npotential access to medical care rather than in actual services to patients.  \n\nHealth Care Delivery \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n22\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n6. \nThe PHC network has deteriorated substantially due to the economic depression and the \ncivil war.  Facilities are in poor  condition.  If not  supplied  through  humanitarian  aid,  equipment, \npharmaceuticals,  and  reference  material  are  largely  absent.  Although  the  bulk  of  the  PHC \nbudget is for salaries, salary levels are below the level necessary for survival, demoralizing the \nhealth staff. Unofficial fees are  widely charged. Many staff  members are forced to work outside \nof  the  health  system.  Overstaffing  has  been  amended  without  any  regulations, as many  have \nofficially left the system to seek better pay. Some remain officially within the system but do not \nwork where they are  supposed to. Facilities are often seen not  staffed or not used. One facility \nsurvey  of  the  ADB  Social  Sector  Rehabilitation  Project  revealed  that  a  staff  of  only  70  are \nworking in a district where more than 230 are supposed to work.  \n \nThe  hospital  sector  is  overly  specialized,  extensive,  and  fragmented.  About  428 \n7. \nhospitals with 41,925 beds (1 bed per 150 persons) exist. Physical infrastructure is often in poor \ncondition, particularly in rural and  central  district  hospitals.  Equipment has not been upgraded \nsince  independence  and  much  is  nonfunctional.  Consumables  are  in  short  supply,  patients \nusually  have  to  purchase  pharmaceuticals,  and  pay  for  their  food  although  these  items  are \nofficially  free.  Patients usually make payments to  nurses  and  doctors.  The  number  of  hospital \nbeds  decreased  from  1,096  per  100,000  population  in  1991  to  680  per  100,000  in  1999, \ngenerating reported savings of $5 million. However, the savings from rationalization were taken \nfrom  the  health  sector  by  MOF  which  bases  budget  allocation  on  the  number  of  beds.  The \naverage  length  of  stay  has  changed  little  at  14.0  days  in  1999,  well  above  the  European \naverage of 9.6 days. Hospital rationalization is Government policy, but the current plan includes \nonly closure of rural hospitals or their conversion to rural health centers. Conversion of so many \nhighly  specialized  hospitals  into  general  hospitals  or  inefficient  hospital management, such as \nlow intensity of care and long  period of stay, has not  yet  been addressed  in the Government \npolicy paper.     \n \nReflecting  the  deteriorated  health  care  system,  the  use  of  health  services  is  low, \n8. \nparticularly among the poor. The poor's use of health services is about half that of the non-poor. \nThis is due to several factors: cost of consultation, official and unofficial; distrust of health staff; \nand cost of drugs. Regional difference in health service use also exists. In Sughd region, people \nuse health services four times a year, while in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAR) \nand Kahtlon, the  poorest  regions,  people  use  services  only  at  1.5  and  1.6 times a year.  The \npopulation, but excluding the poor, use hospitals more. A fixed salary provides no incentives for \nhealth  staff  to  serve  those  unable  to  pay.  Another  issue  requiring  attention  is  the  increasing \nproportion  of  home  deliveries  and  births  without  skilled  health  personnel.  According  to  the \nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF), these  births  were  less  than  10%  in  1990,  but  had \nincreased to 45% in 2000. The rising proportion of home delivery suggests the breakdown of the \nlocal health care system and the financial inability of families to pay for medical care.   \n \n9. \nAgainst this background, the Government has adopted a policy to move to a generalist-\nbased system (family group practice [FGP]), so as to alter the balance toward expenditure on \ndirect  patient  care,  rationalize  PHC  facilities,  and  promote  access  to  basic  health  care  by  the \npoor.  Aid  agencies have  been  actively  retraining  specialists  and  transforming  them  into  family \ndoctors and nurses. So far around 400 staff members have been trained. Medical students who \ntake family medicine have started to graduate. However, the FGP system itself has not been set \nup  and  trained  staff  continue to cover  the  same narrow field that  were  their original specialty.  \nWithout a system in place, training benefits will quickly be lost. \n \n \n\n  \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n23\n\nHealth Care Financing and Budget Allocation \n\nC. \n \n10. \nA large out-of-pocket payment is the main feature of health care financing in Tajikistan. \nThe total health expenditures in  2001, which amounted to TJS95 million ($39 million) or TJS15 \nper capita ($6.3), were financed by (i) users, at least 31% of total expenditures; (ii) Government, \n26%; (iii) development banks, 7%; and (iv) humanitarian agencies, 36%. Salaries of personnel \nare  the  government  focus,  with  users  matching  these  resources.  Drugs  are  the  users\u2019 main \nspending item funded by external agencies that are leading the investment efforts. \n  \n11. \nOut-of-pocket expenses, in order of importance are for (i) drugs and ancillary items,  (ii) \nin-patient  and  outpatient  consultation  fees  (official  and  unofficial),  and  (iii)  hospitalization fees.  \nConsultation  fees  are  collected  according  to  the  price  schedule  of  each  hospital  or  health \ncenter.  Most  other  services  are  left  to  discretionary  price  setting.  Fees  collected  at  the  health \ncenter  are  kept  in  the  facility.  MOH  does  not  standardize  and  regulate  user  charges.  Users \ncharges at the time of use of health care  are likely to impede access of the poor to the needed \nservices. On the other hand,  although  the  population  pays  a  significant  share  of  the  medical \ncare,  these  resources  don\u2019t  address  the  priority  problems.  Out-of-pocket payment is  the  most \nregressive  way  to  pay  for  health  care.  This  fact  highlights  the  need  to  \u201crationalize\u201d  the  user \npayments or the need to pool resources in a more efficient and equitable way.  \n \nCurrently,  MOH is elaborating a proposal to introduce co-payments at the hospital and \n12. \nPHC  level.  The  proposal  recommends  Identifying  various  mechanisms to bring into the health \nsystem out-of-pocket payments. The mechanisms are (i) introducing standardized user charges; \nand  (ii)  pooling  resources  through  different  community  financing  schemes, including  a  drug \nrevolving  fund,  prepayment at  PHC  level, and  community  insurance  at  the  hospital  level.  It  is \nplanned that the users charges should combine with free provision of a health package within \nthe current budgetary resources available.  \n \nDuring  the  decade  of  political  crisis,  the  health  sector  lost  priority,  and  public  health \n13. \nexpenditures  fell from  4.8%  of  GDP  in  1990,  3.1%  in  1995,  0.96%  in  2001, and  to  0.86% in \n2002. As the GDP itself has shrunk to 40% of its 1991  level in 1999, the actual public spending \non  health  per  capita  has  decreased  to  1.5%  of  that  in  1991.  The  public  health  expenditure  is \nlimited not only  in its budget size, but also  in its efficient use. About 50% of the budget goes to \nsalaries  and  staff\u2019s  social  security,  20%  to  maintenance  and  operation,  and  14%  to  food. \nMedicine accounts for 10% and others such as training receive only 1.5%. Capital expenses for \nequipment and civil works account for about 5%. At the PHC level, about 95%  goes to salaries \nand  social  security.  The  distribution  of  expenditures  by  line  item  shows  a  distorted  picture, \nespecially  at  the  PHC  level,  leaving  actual  services  unmet.  Despite the Government policy on \nstrengthening  PHC,  the  share  of  public  health  expenditure  at  the  PHC  level  is  low  and \ndecreasing: 7.3% in 2000 and 6% in 2002. The hospital sector receives majority of the budget.   \n \nD. \n \n14. \nA number of human resource issues have been constraining the delivery of affordable, \neffective, quality health services in Tajikistan. They include issues related to efficiency and cost \nof the use of human resources, staff distribution and equity of services, staff performance, and \ncapacity for human resource policy and planning. The cost-effective use of human resources is \nkey to the delivery of health services in a resource-constrained context as in Tajikistan. Analysis \nof the current situation suggests a lack of consistency in available staffing data, overstaffing at \nnational and provincial levels and understaffing at district and health centers levels, significant \ngaps  in  key  staff  categories,  inappropriate  deployment  of  specialty  staff,  poorly  defined  roles \n\nHuman Resource Development \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n24\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nThe Government Policy and Strategies \n\nand functions of staff,  and weak human resource management. It is difficult to allocate staff to \nremote facilities because of low salaries and incentives and weak workforce management. \n \n15. \nHuman resource policy and planning capacity is not well developed. The implementation \nof  human  resource  policy  and  plans  is  incomplete.  The  capacity  within  MOH  is  insufficient. \nExisting standards for service delivery and staffing are outdated. The human resource database \nis not yet ready for use in comprehensive workforce planning. \n \nB. \n \n16. \nSince  1991,  MOH  has  adopted  major  changes  in  national  health  policy  direction. \nParticularly  in  1998\u20132000,  MOH  developed  the  comprehensive  health  sector  reform  plan \nsupported by international agencies, such as World Health Organization (WHO) and European \nCommittee Humanitarian Office (ECHO). In adjusting to  the socioeconomic, demographic, and \nepidemiological situation, the master plan emphasizes PHC as the strategy for delivering health \nservices  to  the  population that  is responsive to  needs of client,    particularly  the  poor,  women, \nand children; cost-effective; and of good quality with equitable and sustainable access.  \n \n17. \nTo  implement  the  reform plan,  further  health  strategies  such  as the    \u201cConception  on \nHealth  Care  Reform  in  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan\u201d  were  developed.  The  developmental \nstrategies for health care reform defined in this document have the following objectives: \n \n\nSetting Priorities. State resources are inadequate to solve all existing problems; \ntherefore, there is a need to prioritize. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n \n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nStrengthening the primary health care.  As the majority of health problems can \nbe solved at the  PHC level in a more cost-effective way, all strategic measures \nare directed to improving PHC.  \n\nDistributing  resources  according  to  need.  Health  care  resources  will  be \nallocated in accordance with the system requirements, considering geographical \npeculiarities, demographic and health indicators, and level of health service. \n\nDeveloping human resources. Human resources are key to the health status of \nthe  population  and  solving  priority  health  problems.  Health  policy  should  be \ndirected to supplying health care facilities with quality human resources. \n\nRationalization of services. Scarce resources should be used wisely. \n\nImproving  the  quality  of  care.  The  quality  of  the  provided  health  care  will \ncontinuously be improved and will be oriented to the final result. \n\n \n(vii)  Strengthening  management  capacity.  Developing  management  capacity  is \n\nindispensable for successful realization of health care reforms. \n\n(viii)  Ensuring  necessary  information  for  management.    Information systems  are \nimportant in providing feedback for decisions and monitoring reform impact.  \n\n(ix) \n\nCreating among the population personal responsibility for their own health.  \nHealth care reforms should address the needs of the population. It is important to \nconsider public opinion in developing the health care structure and sector activity.  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE HEALTH SECTOR IN TAJIKISTAN

 and  Kulyab  in  Khatlon  region.  They  are  rural  and \nmountainous  districts  that  have  more  profound  poverty  in  Tajikistan  where  83%  of  the \npopulation  on average are below  the  poverty  line.  They  suffer  also  from  poor health status of \nmothers  and  children.  These  districts  face  multiple  deviations.

Tajikistan has no tradition of  general practice. \nThe health care delivery system inherited from the  former Soviet Union and continuing without \nsignificant changes is extensive, complex, and fragmented at all levels of the  system.  PHC is \nprovided in cities at polyclinics that are fragmented with separate clinics for adults, children, and \nwomen\u2019s reproductive health; at specialized dispensaries; and at health posts of universities. In \nrural areas it is more complicated. PHC facilities in rural areas are medical houses (previously \ncalled FAP), rural clinics, and rural hospitals.    \n \n2. \nThe specialist system of around 125 different specialties further adds complications and \ninefficiency to actual services to patients. For example, a doctor could be a specialist \u201ccardiac \nreanimator\u201d whose sole responsibility  is resuscitating patients suffering  from cardiac arrest and \ncardiogenic shock. To provide care to the broad community, a number of specialists of different \ndisciplines  are  found  even  at  the  PHC  level.  A  consequence  of  this  high  degree  of \nspecialization,  the  number  of  patients  seen  by  many  individual  doctors  is  extremely  low;  thus, \nmost resources  are  used  in  providing  potential  access  to  medical  care  rather  than  on  actual \nservices  to  patients.  The  move  to  a  generalist-based system aims to  allocate funds for  direct \npatient care through the provision of doctors who are able to treat, at least in the first instance, \npatients of both genders and all ages exhibiting the most problems. \n  \n3. \nAs part of overall health sector reforms, a general practice model has been proposed. In \n2000, the Ministry of Health (MOH) prepared the draft document on Health Reform Master Plan \n2000\u20132010  that  sets out  a  plan  for  retraining  and  training  family  doctors  and  nurses.  On 4 \nMarch 2002, the Government approved the concept of health reforms including the retraining of \nfamily doctors and nurses. Students choosing to specialize in family medicine undertake training \nin years 6 and 7 at the Tajik medical  university, which is the only institution providing medical \nundergraduate training.  At first, 11 students took the family doctor training program in 2001 and \ngraduated in June 2003.  In  2002, only 25 out of 500 students chose to go to family medicine, \nindicating the low popularity of the program.  \n \n4. \nThe postgraduate medical institute conducts retraining of family doctors and nurses. So \nfar,  over  240  specialists  have  been  retrained  since  1998.  In  2001,   13,400  medical  doctors \nregistered  in  Tajikistan.  Only  1.8%  majored  in  family  medicine.  In  2001  MOH  and  the World \nHealth  Organization  (WHO)  shortened  the  course  from  8  months  to  6  months.  Several \ninternational  agencies,  such  as  Asian  Development  Bank/Social  Sector  Rehabilitation  Project, \nthe  World  Bank,  WHO,  Agha  Khan  Foundation,  and  Zdravplus,  support  retraining  programs. \nCurrently 20-26 family doctors are trained annually. The same agencies support the retraining of \nfamily nurses.     \n \nEvaluation of the family medicine retraining program has shown that doctors completing \n5. \nthe  program  continue  to  work  in  medical  houses  or  polyclinics  under  the  same  working \nconditions  as  before  and  tend  to  continue  to  see  patients  who  fall  within  their  original  clinical \nspecialty.  Ap parently  family  doctors  and  nurses  are  not  only  limited  in  numbers,  but  also \nineffective in providing services for which they have been trained.       \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 6  \n\n33 \n\nProposed Assistance Under the Health Sector Reform Project  \n\nIntroducing the FGP process involves, not only  adoption of general and group practice, \n6. \nbut also  (i)  a  change  in  provider  payment  (from  the  norm-based  budget  allocation  for  state \nemployees to risk-adjusted capitation payment to private providers of service); (ii) introduction of \nperformance based contracts; (iii) the purchaser-provider split where the public health authority \nplays the role of purchaser while  a FGP takes the role of an independently contracted provider, \nand registration of the population with FGPs; (iv) retraining programs; (v)  accreditation systems \nto assure the quality of FGP services; and (vi) public information campaigns on the FGP system. \nA monitoring system is another important pillar for population registration, and performance and \nimpact  monitoring.  The  pro-poor  nature  of  the  FGP  system  is  strengthened  by  capitation \npayment and contractual arrangements, and ensured by the  monitoring system. The plan is to \nset up a FGP unit with a staff of two family doctors and two family nurses for multiple functions \nincluding management of the facility. The unit will cover 3,000 persons on average. (The reform \nplan proposal is for one family doctor to cover 1,500 persons.)    \n \nB. \n \nThe capacity of the Government  for policy development and administration  is limited.  It \n7. \nlacks  experience  in  planning  and  implementing  reforms.  The  Health  Sector  Reform  Project \n(HSRP) will strengthen MOH  capacity  and  assist  MOH  to  develop  the  operational,  legal,  and \nfinancial framework  for  the FGP  system.  The  capitation  rates  and  contracts\u2019  contents will be \ncarefully designed to have pro-poor incentives. District health departments will be created and \ntheir capacities built. Regional supervisory functions will be strengthened.  \n \n8. \nThe  HSRP  will  finance  capitation  payment  in  pilot  districts  and  will  pilot-test the FGP \nsystem.  The  pilot  activity  will  start  from  year  3  of  project  implementation.  By  that  time,  the \ndesign of the FGP system will  have been completed and enough trained staff  available to start \nworking  in  the  pilot  districts.  The  necessary  legal  framework  and  regulations  will  have  been \nenacted  and  the  management  requisites  will  be  in  place.  Simultaneously,  facilities  will  have \nbeen rehabilitated, equipped, and supplied with medicines.  Before the purchaser-provider split \nand  contractual  status  of  FGPs   are  introduced,  extensive  public campaigns, consultation, and \ndiscussion must take place to raise awareness and understanding.  \n \nCapitation Payment \nC. \n \n \n9. \nCapitation is the payment scheme by which  FGPs are paid according to the number of \npeople registered with them. Capitation should  be introduced only when all requirements are in \nplace. Basic characteristics of the proposed capitation payment scheme follow: \n \n(i) \n\nContracts will be established between the FGP units and the district health departments. \nThe contract will set a series of targets, procedures, and monitoring measures. The pro-\npoor objective must be clearly stated in the contract. Specific monitoring instruments will \nsystematically evaluate the accomplishment of objectives.    \n  \nThe  package  will  include  consultation  to  start  the  scheme.  The  package  will  be \nexpanded to include drug costs after experience on FGP management has accumulated \nand health workers follow rational drug use.  \n  \nThe  capitation  rating  will  consider  age,  sex,  and  the  poverty  level  of  the  registered \npopulation.  This  is  to  increase  incentives  for  the  provider  to  see  needy  people  (for \ninstance, infants and pregnant women) and the poor. \n  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe FGP unit will be accountable to the district health authority, and must comply with \nthe health policy being implemented. The staff might still keep their employee status and \ntheir salaries guaranteed until the purchaser-provider split is fully introduced.     \n\nAt the  end of    year  2  of  the  HSRP  there  will  be  around  100  trained  family  doctors. \nConsidering that each FGP unit  (two doctors and two nurses)  will cover a population of \n3,000  people,  around  114  FGPs  will  be  necessary  to  cover  the  whole  population \n(350,000)  of  the  five  pilot  districts.  The  full  coverage  in  the  pilot  areas  should  be \nachieved by year 5 of the HSRP. For the 3 years of the HSRP,  there should thus be 57 \nFGPs on average.  \n  \nThe HSRP will allocate  seed money to support the scheme for  3 years until the end of \nthe Project.  \n\nFinancial Feasibility of Nationwide Capitation Payment \n\nAfter being evaluated in five HSRP districts, the FGP system will expand nationwide.  \n\n \nD. \n \n10. \n \n11. \nThe actual composition of the FGP unit and the capitation rate for the pilot districts will \nbe determined during the first  2  years of  the  HSRP.  Due  to  the  absence  of suitable data  for \ndetailed planning,  the  following  indicative  planning  is  made  for  estimating  budget  requirement \nfor the FGP system under the HSRP and nationwide. This indicative planning is based on the \nexperience  in Mongolia  that  has  successfully introduced  FGP  nationwide,  but  adjusted by  the \neconomic  difference  between  Mongolia  ($400  of  GDP  per  capita)  and  Tajikistan  ($162).  In \nMongolia, the introduction of  FGP nationwide has increased by 7% in the allocation to PHC in \nthe public health budget, and transferring the hospital allocation to PHC offset this increase. The \nGovernment  continues  to  pay  the  salary  of  family  doctors  and  family  nurses.  Other  costs 1 \n(capitation,  performance  and  development)  will  be  met  by  the  HSRP.  Under  the  contractual \narrangement, the FGP unit will receive $1,800 (TJS5,500)  annually for  3,000 enrollees, based \non $0.6 per enrollee per year.   \n\n \n12. \nFor  a  nationwide  FGP  system,  around  2,066  FGP  units  will  be  set  up  and  around \nTJS11,363,000  per  year  will  be  required  to  finance  the  system.  (Considering that the  annual \ncost  of  one  FGP  unit  is  TJS5,500,  TJS11,363,000  per  year  will  be  necessary).  Two possible \nfunding strategies are proposed to extend the scheme nationwide: one is based on increases in \nthe  health  budget,  as  in  the  Mongolian  case,  and  the  other  on  pooling  private  contributions \ncollected locally. The HSRP will support a detailed feasibility analysis when the  HSRP and the \nGovernment evaluate the pilot FGP system.  The two strategies are briefly  examined in paras. \n13-16.   \n  \n\n1. \n\nIncreasing Allocation to PHC or Increasing Public Expenditure  \n\n \n13. \nIf  the  additional  requirement  is  to  be  covered  by  reallocation  from  the  public  health \nbudget, the allocation to PHC must increase from 6% to 34%. For a proposed forecasted public \nhealth budget of TJS36 million by the end of  year 5  of the  HSRP (2008), the estimated total of \nTJS11.4 million for funding the scheme will represent 32% of the total budget.  Considering that \nthe total spent on PHC currently represents only 6% of the public health budget, an increase by \n\n                                                 \n1  In  the  context  of  this  paper,  capitation  refers  to  funding  for  the  delivery  of  health  care  to  enrolled populations. \nPerformance relates to  payments made to FGPs who meet predefined performance standards for priority services \nand  appropriate  referral  practices,  and  so  on.  Development  refers  to  competitive  grants  for  innovation in case \npractices. With other costs, the FGP will manage its services, excluding drug prescription.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 6  \n\n35 \n\n34% would bring the system to a more adequate and efficient distribution of resources between \nprimary and hospital  levels. The new distribution will correct a serious distortion of the current \nallocation.  The  HSRP  will  promote  system  rationalization,  including  reduction  of  beds, \nappropriate  staff  distribution,  and  increased  efficient  hospital  management,  and  will  help  the \nGovernment reallocate funds from the hospital sector to the PHC level. \n \n14. \nIf the requirement is to be covered by increasing  the total public health budget, the total \nbudget  will  have  to  account  for  1.5%  of  GDP.  This  percentage,  despite  representing  a \nsubstantive increase from the current level of 0.9%, is still well below  the 3% observed in other \ncentral  Asian  republics.  This  plan  will  make  the  FGP  system  sustainable.  The  Ministry  of \nFinance plans to increase  the public health budget to 1.8% by 2008. The HSRP will undertake \npolicy dialogue to see this plan happening and  furthermore to raise public health expenditure to \nthe level in the other central Asian republics.    \n \n\n2. \n\nPooling Private Contributions           \n\n \nHealth  care  users  have  been  making  substantive  formal  and  informal  payments  to \n15. \nhealthcare  providers.  The  payments  are  estimated  to  be  larger  than  the  Government \nexpenditure in health; therefore, it is important to design alternatives to bring these resources to \nthe system in a transparent and nondiscretionary way. The proposal discussed here envisages  \ncollecting  a  yearly  contribution  from  the  beneficiaries.  The  contributions  should  entitle  the \nbeneficiaries to free health care throughout the year, and should be pooled at the district level.  \n \n16. \nFor estimation purposes, an indicative contribution of  TJS2 should be collected annually \nfor  each  of  the  3,000  inhabitants  of  the  area  covered  by  a  FGP  unit.  Assuming  100% \ncompliance,  a  total  of  TJS6,000  will  be  collected  in  the  catchment  area  of  the  FGP  unit. \nAccording to  estimates,  this  fund  will  be  enough  for  paying  TJS500  a  month  to  the  FGP  unit. \nSuch a scheme would release pressure on the Government budget. Considering that the annual \nout-of-pocket  private  expenditure  in  Tajikistan  is  estimated  as  S$2  (TJS6.2)  per  capita, and \nassuming that 50% (TJS3.1) of that is spent on drugs and the other 50% is payment to health \ncare providers, the suggested contribution of TJS2 per capita should easily be affordable to the \nmajority of the population.  \n \nE. \n \n17. \nInvolvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  running  health  services \nimproves access to and  the quality of the services. It is necessary to examine  the possibility of \nsetting  up  a  NGO-run health system  in  Tajikistan  before  deciding  to  set  up  the  FGP  system. \nTajikistan  was  an emergency country, and  its public health system has collapsed.  Only  NGO-\nsupported health facilities function well. Continuing to use NGOs is an option. However, such an \napproach is not financially  or operationally  sustainable in Tajikistan for  the  following  reasons. \nThe NGOs are international or affiliated with international support and too costly to be financed \nby the Government budget. NGOs\u2019 overhead cost is high and their health workers receive much \nhigher salaries than  public  health  workers  do.  At  present,  emergency  NGOs  are  withdrawing, \nwhile development NGOs or local NGOs are too few.  In conclusion, the  NGO health system is \nnot sustainable in Tajikistan. The proposed FGP system, as understood here, involves, not only \nadoption  of  general  practice,  but  also (i) a change in provider payment  and  (ii) introduction of \nperformance-based contracts  with  rigid  monitoring.  These  aspects  will  enhance  the  pro-poor \nnature  of  the  FGP  system  and service efficiency.  Hence,  the  proposed  FGP  system  has  the \nadvantages of the NGO system, but at the same  time has the least cost based on appropriate \ncapitation rates. \n\nComparative Analysis of the FGP System and a NGO Service System \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN   \n\n($ million) \n\n      \n\n \n\n  \n\nTotal Project \nCost \nLocal \n\n  \n \nExchange    Currency \n\nForeign \n\nADB \n\n     \n  Total \n  Cost \n\n    \n  Foreign \n  Exchange \n\nFinancing       \n\n  \nLocal \n \n  Currency \n\n  Total \n  Cost \n\n    \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \n\n  \n\nGovernment \nFinancing \nLocal \n\n \n  Foreign   \n  Exchange   Currency \n   \n\n   \n  Total \n  Cost \n   \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n6\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n7\n \n\ni\n\n  \n\nItem \n  \n  \nA.

Background and Rationale \n \n1. \n An  effective  health  management  information  system  (HMIS)  is essential  for  planning, \nreforming,  managing,  and  monitoring  the  health  sector  of  Tajikistan.  However,  reliable  and \ndisaggregated  information  is  currently  lacking.  The  lack  of  reliable  data  on  the  existing \nworkforce seriously hampers effective human resource development planning. Financing data is \nrequired to design financing strategies and develop mechanisms for performance-based budget \nallocations. HMIS needs streamlining. The Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP) aims to reform \nthe  health  care  delivery  system  by  introducing  the  family  group  practice  (FGP)  and  the \ncapitation  payment  scheme.  It  is  important  to  ensure  that  HMIS  functions  effectively  in \nmonitoring the new systems\u2019 performance and evaluating the impacts of changes.  \n \nIn addition to lack of accurate information, the use of data for planning and monitoring is \n2. \nlow  at  all  levels of the health system.  Neither  does  a forum  exist  where the  Government and \nexternal agencies could monitor and discuss the reform process and sector development. The \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  will  set  a  foundation  for  improving  decision  making  and  policy and \nplanning capacity, supporting monitoring, and  facilitating policy dialogue on sector  reform and \ndevelopment between the government and external agencies. \n \n3. \nCritical  for  measuring  impacts  is  the  availability  of  a  baseline  data  that  indicates  the \nactual situation  in the health sector.  It is important to survey HSRP pilot districts to determine \nthe level of health care delivery, including service use, and health status.   \n \nB. \n \n4. \nTA will (i) develop the HMIS framework and action plans at the Ministry of Health (MOH), \nregion,  and  district  levels;  (ii)  provide  a  basis  for  planning, monitoring, and measuring system \nperformance  and  reforms;  and  (iii)  provide  a  monitoring  and  policy  dialogue  mechanism \nbetween the Government and external agencies. The TA will conduct an in-depth survey in pilot \ndistricts to obtain accurate and disaggregated baseline database for the health sector. The TA \nwill  technically  orient  HSRP\u2019s  HMIS  component.  Based  on  the  TA\u2019s outputs,  the  HSRP will \nestablish HMIS, conduct training nationwide, and facilitate policy dialogue on reforms \n \nC. \n \n5. \nFirst, the TA will review the situation and assess current capacity in handling HMIS data. \nIt  will  examine  a  list  of  data  currently  collected,  the  process  of  data  collection,  gaps  and \nusefulness of data collected, actual use of information at all levels, capacity of staff to effectively \nanalyze  data,  and  accuracy  of  data.  Consequently,  the  TA  will  develop  the  HMIS  framework \nwith a minimum required data set, cost-effective methods, and a scheme to improve data quality. \nThe TA will train key MOH officials on HMIS while developing the HMIS framework. \n \n6. \nSecond,  the  TA  will  design  and  implement  an  in-depth  survey  on  health  care  delivery \nand  health  status  for  the  pilot  district  level.  The  baseline  data  produced  by  the  survey  will  be \nused for  planning,  monitoring,  and  measuring  HSRP  activities.  It  will be fed  into  HMIS  at  the \nnational level to complement the system as well.  Finally, the TA will create a forum where the \nGovernment and external agencies can review HMIS data and discuss the reform process. \n\nScope and Methodology \n\nObjectives \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nCost and Financing \n\nD. \n \n7. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $355,000,  of  which  $169,000  is  in  foreign \nexchange  and  $186,000  equivalent  is  in  local  currency.  The  Government  has  requested  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to finance $300,000, covering the entire foreign exchange cost \nof  $169,000  and  $131,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.

All drugs except those donated by humanitarian agencies must be purchased through \nprivate  suppliers based in  the  country,  either  through  out-of-pocket payment by individuals or \nthrough use of the state budget by public hospitals.  Small-scale drug procurement by individual \nhealth facilities or individuals cannot benefit from economies of scale. Drug quality is uncertain. \nFacilities  buy  whichever  drugs  are  readily  available,  without  following  the  essential  drugs list. \nThis  situation  contributes  to  further  impoverishing  the  population  and  to  wasting  the  already \ninadequate  state  budget  allocated  for  medicines.  Rebuilding public procurement,  establishing \nquality  control, and  improving  distribution capacity  will lead to  the  availability  and  ensure  the \nquality of cost-effective drugs needed by the poorest among the population. \n \nThe Government plans to establish a new drug procurement and nationwide distribution \n2.   \nsystem under  the  MOH.  Some  elements  of  the  system  are  in  place,  including  a  nationwide \nnetwork of MOH warehouses, but the Government will require support in developing a long-term \nstrategy and in strengthening key aspects of the new system. A drug procurement center run by \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  financed  by  the  European  Commission  Humanitarian \nOffice  (ECHO),  and  established  and  maintained  by  Pharmaciens  Sans  Fronti\u00e8res  (PSF) has \nbeen delivering essential drugs to health facilities supported by NGOs nationwide, but continued \nsupport  is  in  doubt  as  emergency-oriented,  humanitarian  agencies  plan  to  exit  the  country. \nECHO  had  planned  to  cease  financial  support  by  May  2003,  but  support  has  since  been \nextended  by  1  year.  The  Government  hopes  to  incorporate  essential  elements  of  the  PSF \nsystem into the national system before ECHO and PSF exit, but it currently lacks the capacity to \nplan or manage this process.       \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe technical assistance (TA) will develop a drug procurement and distribution strategy \nthrough  a  participatory  process  involving  discussions,  exposing  MOH  staff  to  several \ndevelopment  options,  and  reaching  consensus.  The  strategy  will  cover  all  aspects  of  the \nprocurement and distribution process, namely: selecting drugs, ensuring quality, managing the \ntender process, distributing drugs, managing stocks, and monitoring drug use and prices. The \nTA will (i) support policy dialogue and develop a clear strategy and framework for establishing a \ndrug  procurement  and  distribution  system ,  supported  by  action  plans  at  MOH,  region,  and \ndistrict levels; (ii) prepare a rational plan for warehousing,  equipment  distribution, and staffing; \nand  (iii)  provide  operational  guidelines  for  the  procurement  process.  Support  for  developing \nstrategies to strengthen public drug procurement and distribution capacity is urgently required to \nensure continuation of an adequate and reliable supply of quality drugs when assistance from \nhumanitarian agencies ends. The private sector currently does not have the capacity and lacks \nan appropriate policy/legal framework to assume these responsibilities immediately. The TA will \nfill  the  vacuum  created  by  private  sector  absence  and  a  lack  of  public  sector  capacity,  while \nproposing  long-term  development  strategies  to  increase  private  sector  involvement,  including \npublic-private partnerships, in drug procurement and distribution. \n \nThe  TA  will  complement  and  technically  support  the  Health  Sector  Reform  Project \n4. \n(HSRP) subcomponent for establishing a drug procurement center. Using the TA\u2019s outputs, the \n\nObjectives \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n49 \n\nScope and Methodology \n\nHSRP  will  establish  the  drug  procurement  and  distribution  system  and  conduct  necessary \ntraining at the national, regional, and pilot district levels.  \n   \nC. \n \n5. \nThrough study tours, training, and workshops, the TA will build  the capacity of MOH  for \ndrug  procurement.  The  TA  will  help  MOH  assess  capacity,  performance,  problems,  and \nopportunities of the current public drug procurement system and the NGO system. Based on the \nassessment,  the  TA  will  support  a  consultative  process  to  help  MOH  develop  the  drug \nprocurement strategy (1 month) to achieve  the core principles of public drug procurement, such \nas  (i)  procuring  the  most  cost-effective  drugs  in  the  right  quantities  to  treat  prevailing  health \nproblems in the majority of patients served; (ii) achieving the lowest possible total cost, taking \ninto  account  purchase  price,  hidden  costs,  holding  costs,  and  operating  costs;  (iii)  ensuring \ntimely  delivery  of  products  to  health  facilities  and  to  patients;  and  (iv)  assuring  drug  quality \nthrough suppliers selection, monitoring of supplies, and quality control programs (quality control \nprograms will be covered under the quality control subcomponent of the HSRP). \n \n6. \nBased on the new drug procurement strategy, the TA will propose a  drug procurement \nsystem  framework  and  an  implementation  plan  with  minimum  required  interventions,  cost-\neffective methods, and a scheme to establish a drug procurement system incorporating the PSF \nsystem .  The  TA  will  also  prepare  a  detailed  rationalized  plan  for  warehousing,  equipment \ndistribution  and  staffing  of  the  center;  formulate  guidelines  for  the  procurement  process;  and \nestablish contents and schedule for training. As proposed by the TA, the HSRP will establish the \ndrug procurement system  and train MOH.    \n \nD. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n7. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $180,000,  of  which  $114,000  is  in  foreign \nexchange and $66,000  equivalent is in local currency. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance  $150,000,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $114,000  and  $36,000 \nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space  with  utilities  for  TA \nadministration, and workshop facilities. The TA will be financed  on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Table A15.  \n \nE. \n \n8. \nThe TA will start in  January  2004 and last  for  6 months. The President\u2019s Office  will be \nthe  Executing  Agency.  MOH  and  PSF  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The  steering \ncommittee  for  the  HSRP  will  guide  the  TA  and  oversee  Government  coordination,  ensuring \nclose links with the HSRP. It will meet on a quarterly basis.  \n \nThe TA will directly contract with PSF.1 A team of international and domestic consultants \n9. \nwill implement the TA. The TA will provide  4 person-months of international consulting services \nin the areas of  drug procurement and management of the drug supply.

This  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE) \nanalyzes the scope of the potential environmental, health, safety, and social impacts.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nSIEE  fieldwork  and  interviews  did  not  reveal  concern  about  the  vegetation  at  the \nsubproject sites. Endangered species and other wildlife are not affected since their living areas \nare far from the subproject sites. There are no cultural heritage sites in the project areas. Public \nhealth conditions are very poor. Generally, the health facilities are in very poor condition. Even \nbuildings erected after 1990 show substantial damage to structures and equipment due to lack \nof maintenance.  Because of  their  potential  environmental  impact,  water  supply,  wastewater, \nwaste disposal, and drug handling are identified as issues of concern for the Project. \n \n3. \nWater  Supply. The availability of safe drinking water is a high priority need.  The water \nsupply infrastructure of most hospitals is old. It  is not maintained and, as a result, is either not \nworking properly or completely out of order. While central district hospitals are connected to the \nwater  supply  networks,  others  depend  on  on-site  artesian  wells  (over  60  meters  deep). The \nquality of  the  local  pipe  system  usually  does  not  meet  Government standards and  is unsafe \nusing any other possible benchmarks. The poor technical condition of wells is a major problem, \nas they are filled with sediment and the well equipment is in bad condition or inoperative. Due to \nlack of a continuous supply of electricity, drinking water from both networks and on-site wells is \nusually supplied only 2-4 hours a day. Smaller medical structures like medical houses or rural \nhealth  centers  are  as  a  rule  not  connected  to  piped  water.  Their  demand  for  drinking  water  is \nsignificantly smaller than that of hospitals, as no beds are occupied. \n \n4. \nWastewater.  The current situation  wastewater management in  with hospitals/clinics  is \nunsustainable, causing pollution of drinking water sources and waterborne epidemics. Hospitals \nhave toilets, but there are no provisions for safe wastewater treatment/discharge. Only hospital \nbuildings located in central towns of rural areas are connected to sewer systems, which are in a \nvery bad condition. Sewer systems and treatment of municipal wastewater are the responsibility \nof local authorities. On-site wastewater treatment facilities, if in place, lack maintenance and are \nfunctioning  badly.  Clinics  in  most  cases  have  pit  latrines  that  are  not  protected  from  the \nelements,  have  no  provision  for  their  maintenance,  and  lack  basic  hygiene  education \nrequirements.  \n \n \n \nWaste  Management.  There  is  concern  about  the  potential  transmission  of  infectious \n5. \ndiseases  through  inadequate  management  of  waste  from  medical  facilities.  A  number  of  laws \nand guidelines for handling hazardous waste are in place, but it is not clear whether waste from \nmedical  facilities  is  considered  hazardous.  Hospitals  operate  solid,  medical  (syringes,  blood \nbags),  and  human  waste  (placenta,  fetuses,  body  parts).  Medical  houses  and  rural  health \ncenters produce solid and medical waste.  \n \n6. \nIn  the  medical  houses  the  total  amount  of  waste  is  small  because  medical  services \noffered are limited. However, safe waste storage is needed. Hospitals have a significant amount \nof  waste  due  to  their  larger  size,  the  number  of  beds  and  the  more  comprehensive  health \ntreatment  offered.  For  a  central  district  hospital,  about  2-3  cubic  meters  of  waste  excluding \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n\nmunicipal  solid  waste  is  typically  generated  weekly.  Waste  generation  is  slightly  higher  in \nsummer  than  in  winter,  as  people  tend  to  postpone  nonemergency  medical  treatment  until \nsummer  due  to  lack  of  heating  or  acceptable  sanitation.  Currently,  at  best,  medical  waste  is \nstored in containers together with other kinds of waste and disposed of, where other municipal \nsolid  waste  is  also  dumped.  Human  waste  is  mostly  generated  in  maternity  houses  (placenta, \nfetus) and surgery departments (body parts) and is often mixed with medical waste. Solid waste \nis disposed  of  at  local  dump  sites.  Technical  methods  of  disposal  are  poor  and  inappropriate \nbecause  there  are  no  regular  and  safe  disposal  facilities.  With  road  connections  between  the \nproject  areas  and  district  centers  bad  or  absent,  particularly  in  mountainous  areas  in  winter \ntimes, waste is often stored conducted on-site.  \n \n7. \nDrug  Handling.  The  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  has  issued  regulations  for  the  safe \nstorage of medical drugs and equipment, including syringes, plastics, etc., to guide all ministries \nand agencies.  In rural areas,  however,  institutions  are  generally  not  able  to  comply  with  the \nregulations.  \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  (MEP)  is  the  state  body  responsible  for \nenvironmental protection and management.  The  Government  agency  responsible  for  testing \nand approving all drinking water supplies is the Sanitary Epidemiological Services (SES) under \nMOH. The SES offices at  district level  take  water  samples,  conduct  tests  and  issues permits. \nThe regulation on environmental impact assessment issued by MEP in August 2000 details the \ncontents  of  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (EIS),  specifies  its  documentation,  and \nestablishes a process of review and approval, including public review. \n \n9. \nWater  Supply.  Comprehensive  improvement of  the  water supply  pipe  networks  from \ncommunities is beyond the scope of HSRP. HSRP will repair the pipe in hospital premises or dig \nwells  or  provide  disinfectants, but  will  not  repair  the  whole  pipe  network.  If  there  is  no  pipe \nnetwork and/or the decision is made to provide  an individual water source, the HSRP will study \nhow acceptable quality of drinking water can be provided in cost-effective and sustainable ways \nby (i) monitoring the quality of the new/former water source; (ii) improving the existing source of \nwater or using an alternative water source if improvement of sources is not possible (tube wells \nover  60  meter  deep  are  recommended  as  surface  water  and  ground  water  sources  are \nconsidered  unsafe);  and  (iii)  establishing  adequate  operation  and  maintenance  and  water \nquality  monitoring  procedures.  The  relatively  small  demand  for  drinking  water  for  medical \nhouses  and  heath  centers  will  be  satisfied  through  bottled  water  or  other  appropriate  and \naffordable options.  There  are  no  existing  groundwater-related subsidence problems in  HSRP \ndistricts and limited amount of water intake for rebuilt or renovated facilities is not likely to cause \nshortages or cause conflicts with other water users. No special monitoring will be required. \n \n10.  Wastewater  Disposal.   The HSRP will not cover rehabilitation of sewer systems in the \ntowns. If local authorities cannot ensure the reliability of sewage systems, the HSRP will provide \non-site  septic  tanks to health facilities.  Chemicals  for septic tanks treatment processes  will  be \nprovided (e.g., lime chloride).  \n \n11.  Waste  Management.   For  medical  houses  and  health  centers,  the  HSRP will  provide \nsafe, temporary on-site storage equipped with transport containers. The HSRP will arrange  for \ntemporary  stored  waste  to  be  transported  for  final  disposal  to  the  center  district  hospitals. \nLeachate will be collected and treated on site or disposed of in sewer systems. For hospitals, \ntwo disposal routes will be established under the  HSRP: (i) human waste will be burned in on-\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n53 \n\nsite  incinerators;  if  no  combustion  capability  is  available,  other  appropriate  equipment will be \ninstalled at  hospitals;  and  (ii)  solid  and  medical  waste  will  be  disposed  of  either  on-site or  in \nupgraded designated areas of existing landfills. The technical staff of the hospital will supervise \nall major activities regarding on-site waste management.  \n \n12. \nHandling of Expired Drugs and Wasted Reagents. The HSRP will provide necessary \nfurniture to ensure that  expired drugs are stored safely in designated metal lockable containers, \nplaced  in  an  administration  room  until  collection  takes  place.  The  HSRP  will  provide  on-site \ntanks  for  wasted  reagents  with  chemicals,  as  necessary,  to  avoid  environmental  damage  by \nreagents.    \n \n13. \nProject Location and Design. The HSRP will attempt to rehabilitate/build structures at \nexisting  locations  as  much  as  possible  and therefore  is not  likely to  cause  any  incremental \nenvironmental impacts due to conflicting land use or impediments to movement of people and \nlivestock. Designated sites for  disposing of hospital waste disposal will not require expansion of \ncurrently  functioning  landfills  run  by  local  authorities.  No  resettlement  is  anticipated.  However, \nwhen necessary, resettlement will be pursued according to guidelines of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). The HSRP will ensure that rehabilitated/rebuilt infrastructure facilities meet safety, \nseismic and fire compliance norms (including building materials, electrical systems,  operations \nand maintenance of boilers and remaining stoves).  \n \n14. \nConstruction Stage. Adverse environmental impacts associated with civil works will be \nminimal,  of  short  duration,  and  mitigated  by  appropriate  design  and  management of facilities \nconstruction and operation.   \n \n15. \nProject  Operation.  The  HSRP  will  establish  a  monitoring  system,  which  will  include \nchecks on drinking water quality, maintenance and operations of water supply, waste collection, \nsanitation, waste disposal, and drug and reagent handling.  \n \nD. \n \n16. \nCivil works will be subject to environmental classification conducted jointly by the project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  assisted  by  environment  consultants.  IEEs  for  facilities  will  be \nconducted where they are required. IEEs will be (i) based on the results of the civil work surveys \nand social analysis; (ii) designed in accordance with the Government and ADB requirements by \nlocal  design  institutes  in  charge  of  designing  of  subproject  civil  works;  and  (iii)  approved  by \nMOH. 1 Environmental monitoring procedures during design, construction and operation will be \nspecified and monitored by implementing an environmental management plan (EMP) designed \nfor  each  health  facility.  The  EMP  will  cover  the  design  and  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures,  and  specify  monitoring  activities  to  ensure  compliance.  EMPs  will  be  designed  by \nlocal  design  institutes  and  approved  by  MOH. 2 They  will  include  (i)  an  action  plan  on  staff \nhygiene education; (ii) a handbook on operations and maintenance procedures; (iii) internal and \nexternal monitoring procedures; (iv)  a financial sustainability plan for operating facilities, and  a \nfollow-up  monitoring  plan;  (v)  contracts  with  qualified  technical  permanent/contractual  staff  to \noperate  facilities;  (vi)  contracts  with  local  authorities  for  emptying  septic  tanks  regularly; (vii) \ncontract  agreements  for  dispos ing  of  medical  waste  to  the  landfills/rural  hospitals,  and  for \ndisposing  of  human  waste  in  furnaces;  and  (viii)  training  courses  in  operating  environmental \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Program  \n\n                                                 \n1 I EEs for subprojects exceeding $100,000 for civil works will be approved by ADB. \n2 EMPs for subprojects exceeding $100,000 for civil works will be approved by ADB. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nequipment,  safe  management/disposal  of  medical  waste,  water  conservation  practice,  and  \nemployee health and safety training. \n \n17. \nCivil work surveys, IEEs, and EMPs will be designed in a participatory manner through \ninput of local information, and intensive public discussions with health and education providers, \nhospital  management  and  personnel,  district  administrators,  and  village  development \ncommittees.  Environmental  public  information  campaign  and  training  will  be  a  part  of  project-\nwide health management information system and public information campaigns.  \n \n18. \nThe national steering committee, consisting of MOH, MEP, and Ministry of Construction, \nwill direct and supervise the implementation of project environmental mitigation measures. The \nPIU  will  be  responsible  for  administering  the  project\u2019s  environmental  monitoring  system.  It  will \nensure  the  incorporation  of  environmental  due  diligence  into  the  subproject  cycle; incorporate \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  into  subproject  design,  construction,  and  operations; and \nprovide  the  Government  and  ADB  with  timely  information  on  progress  toward  the  expected \noutputs.  A  civil  engineer/environmental  specialist  will  serve  as  a  full-time  PIU  staff,  with \nresponsibility for (i) overseeing the development of environmental items in the selection criteria \nfor subprojects; (ii) assisting  in  civil  works  survey  concerning  environmental  issues,  including \ninitial  quality  testing  of  drinking water  source before  involvement  of  SES;  (iii)  participating  in \nselecting  subprojects;  (iv)  liaising  with  MOH  on  subproject  environmental  classification;  (v) \nestablishing  contact  with  local  key  stakeholders;  (vi)  overseeing  the  development  of  IEEs  by \nselected design institutes according to  Government  and  ADB  guidelines;  (vii)  submitting  IEEs \nfor  approval  to  MOH  and  ADB  as  necessary;  (viii)  overseeing  the  preparation  of  EMPs  by \ndesign institutes at the subproject design stage; (ix) submitting for approval to MOH and MOE \nand ADB, as necessary; (x) administering monitoring surveys during the construction phase and \naudits after the completion of construction; and (xi) developing reports on the implementation of \nthe  project-specific  EMPs  on  a  semiannual  basis,  reporting  to  ADB,  and  informing  the  project \nsteering committee.  \n \n19. \nOn the Government side,  MEP (through local environmental protection committees), will \nbe  responsible  for  (i)  environmental  clearance  of  physical  investments;  (ii)  environmental \ncompliance monitoring during construction;  and  (iii) routine environmental monitoring. SES (at \nprovince and district levels) will be responsible for (i) testing and approving water supplies; (ii) \nroutine water quality monitoring; (iii) aspects of public health education and awareness;  and (iv) \npublic  health  monitoring.  The  Government  will  ensure that SES  carries out  tests  for  drinking \nwater  quality,  bacteriological  analysis, and conventional pollutants according to their mandate, \nand as part of project counterpart contribution.  \n \nE. \n \nThe screening process carried out in this SIEE has not identified any significant negative \n20. \nenvironmental  impacts  likely  to  be  caused  by  the  Project.  The  HSRP will promote  enhanced \nquality of living in rural communities and reduce poverty through access to improved health and \neducation  and  improved  environmental  management  of  clinics  and  hospitals.  Therefore  it  will \nhave major positive environmental impacts. The HSRP will improve drinking water supplies; and \nintroduce  appropriate  medical  waste  management,  adequate  wastewater  treatment,  and  safe \ndrug and reagent management. These measures will have a significant positive effect on public \nhealth.  \n\nConclusions \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 17 \n\n55 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY FORM  \n\n \nA. \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty \nanalysis?  Yes \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?  Yes \n \n\nContribution of the health sector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan: \n\n \n1.            Investment in the health sector, in particular in primary health care (PHC) will help reduce the burden of \ndiseases among the poor. The poor will benefit from productivity gains from improved health status and resource cost \nsavings.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProposed Classification: Core Poverty Intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis   \nB. \n2.     \nThe Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP) has national level components and a pilot  district component. At \nthe national level,  the HSRP will help the Ministry of Health develop the heath service system that responds to the \nneeds of  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable.  The  system  will  also  reduce  barriers  to  access to services.  The  HSRP will \ndesign the health management information system framework that will monitor use of  services  among the poor and \nthe vulnerable.  \n \n3.          The district component will improve the health status of the poor, women, and children in five districts that are \npoor  and  with  high  maternal  and  infant  mortality  rates.  The  pilot  districts  represent  5.5%  of  the  population  of  6.3 \nmillion.  The  HSRP  will  strengthen  PHC,  deliver  a  pro-poor  health  service  package,  and  establish  the  family  group \npractice (FGP).   \n \n4.         PHC is an internationally proven best practice to meet the needs of the poor and vulnerable groups, especially \nwomen  and  children.  The  pro-poor service  package  is  designed  to  cover  ill  conditions  that  are  closely  related  to \npoverty. The FGP system serves the poor,  women and children better than other types of services such as hospitals. \nThe  FGP  system  has  incentives  for  family  doctors  and  nurses  to  see  the  poor  and  vulnerable  through  capitation \npayment weighted with the poverty rate and performance-based contracts.       \n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis?  Yes \n \nThe project preparatory technical assistance (TA) team carried out a multilevel consultation process with a \n5. \nwide  range  of  stakeholders.  Information  on  health-seeking  behavior  among  service  users  was  obtained  through \ninterviews,  focus  group  discussions  and  literatures.  Health  service  providers  often  expressed  dissatisfaction  with \nhuman resource issues and working environment. They include poor salary level, lack of training opportunities, lack of \nreference  material,  lack  of  drugs  and  equipment, and poor  conditions   of  facilities .  The  TA  team  closely  consulted \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  aid agencies,  and  national  and  local  policymakers   and  decision  makers in \ndesigning the project activities.  \n \nParticipation strategy? Yes \n \n6.       Stakeholders \u2019 perception of access to and quality of health services was considered in designing the HSRP \nscope and detailed activities. Community  participation  will  be  supported  as  part of  a  public information campaign \nunder the HSRP. Community participation will be used as well in monitoring access to health care services.   \n\nParticipation Process \n\nD.         Gender and Development \n \n7. \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: HSRP\u2019s strategies to maximize the impacts on women follow. (i) \nThe pro-poor health service package offer services in family  planning, antenatal care and safe motherhood, (ii) the \ncapitation  payment  rate  will  be  set  higher  for  women of  reproductive  age,  (iii)  the  performance based contract will \nspecify the need for facility based and outreach services for  women of reproductive age, and (iv) data of the project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system be gender disaggregated.    \n \nSpecial attention will be given to (i)  ensuring  no  gender  bias  in  the  health  staff  training  opportunities; \n8. \n(ii)  the  use  of  the  local  women's  network  in  the  community  awareness  and  public  campaign  on  health \nservices. \n \nGender plan prepared?  No. The above strategies are well reflected in the HSRP, no special gender plan is required. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nE.  \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\n \n\nResettlement \n \n\nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nNone \nUncertain \n\nIndigenous Peoples  \n \n\nNot significant  Under \n\nLabor \n \nAffordability \n \n\nNone \n\nSignificant \npositive impacts  \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities  \n \n\nNot significant \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \nResettlement is unlikely as rehabilitation and rebuilding will \ntake place in existing facilities . If it becomes necessary  to \nbuild new health centers,  the HSRP will recruit consultants \nto assist local governments to prepare land acquisition and \nsettlement plans.  \n\nthe  public \n\ninformation  campaign,  NGOs  and \ncommunities  will  be  mobilized  to  assess  access  to  heath \nservices among vulnerable groups. Indigenous people will \nbecome  a  part  of  the  vulnerable  groups  and  will  receive \ndue attention.       \n\n \n\nThe HSRP will reduce financial burdens to access to health \nservices  among  the  poor,  women  and  children.  These \nmechanisms include introduction of the FGP system, which \nis  a  service  type  serving  the  poor  better,  and  a  pro-poor \nhealth service package. The poor\u2019s access to basic health \nservices will also be monitored.  \nThe HSRP is environment category B, as there is a need to \nimprove  medical  waste  management  when \nthe  HSRP \nrehabilitates/rebuilds  health  facilities.  In  designing  civil \nworks,  an  environmental  management  plan  will  be \ndeveloped.  Environmental  measures  will  be  also \naddressed in the drug quality control component.    \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n\nShort \nresettlement \nplan as \nneeded  \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nSummary of \nInitial \nEnvironment \nExamination \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 18 \n\n57 \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nEconomic Benefits  \n\n \nA. \n \nEconomic  benefits  potentially  include  social  returns  from  the  investment  through  (i) \n1. \nproductivity gains from  the  improved  health  status  of  intended  beneficiaries, and (ii) resource \ncost  savings.  The  Health  Sector  Reform  Project  (HSRP)  will  improve the internal efficiency of \nthe  health  system  and  increase  the  use  of  quality  primary  health  care  (PHC).  PHC  is  cost-\neffective for decreasing maternal mortality ratio (MMR), infant mortality rate (IMR), and general \nmorbidity. The HSRP will increase the number of persons receiving quality health care and will \ncontribute to  raising the productivity of  the  target  beneficiaries. Where possible, the expected \neffects have been summarized in monetary terms as either resource cost savings or increased \nproductivity. These benefits exclude externalities that accrue to the Project.   \n \n2. \nProductivity gains due to reduction in days lost because of illness are expected to accrue \nfrom HSRP interventions. Increased access to quality care will lead to improved in health status \nthat  will  lead  to  longer  healthy  life  years,  that,  in  turn,  will  lead  to  increases  in  productivity. \nReduction  in  morbidity  and  mortality  will  translate  into  productivity  gains.  Through  system \nreforms,  the  entire  country  is  envisioned  to  benefit  from  the  HSRP,  particularly  as  institutional \ncapacity at the central level permeates the health system.   \n \n3. \nResource  cost  savings include  reduction  in  out-of-pocket  health  expenditures  and  in \nexpenditures on drugs in the pilot areas. By introducing a free pro-poor health package at HSRP \ndistricts, the basic health needs of the target population will be addressed.  The package will be \ndelivered  efficiently.  The  services  will  be  provided  through  the  family  group  practice  (FGP) \nsystem ,  which  serves  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable  better  than  other  types  of  service.  The \nbeneficiaries  will  receive  better  quality  health  care  at  reduced  costs.  The  pharmaceutical \nsupport  under  the  HSRP will constitute a  substantial  economic  benefit  itself,  given the current \nlevel of out-of-pocket expenditure on drugs. Patients are currently purchasing drugs of unknown \nquality\u2014which are often counterfeit, or low quality\u2014in an unregulated environment. By receiving \nquality drugs dispensed free in the HSRP, cost savings will accrue to intended beneficiaries. \n \nThese  measurable  economic  benefits  are  linked  to  the  final  health  outcomes  of  the \n4. \nHSRP.  Intermediate  benefits  likewise  result  from  developing  capacity  and  rationalizing  the \nsystem .  An  effective  health  system  delivering  equitable  and  quality  health  care will  improve \nhealth outcomes. Human capital development is an economic benefit  creating the potential for \nyielding sustainable synergies through the proposed system reforms. For estimation purposes, \nthe economic analysis assumes that human capital in the health sector will generate increasing \nreturns as economic gains that will accrue to the pilot areas and to the entire country. \n \n\n1. \n\nKey Assumptions \n\n \n5. \nBy 2008, the HSRP targets are (i) reducing  IMR,  MMR , and under-5 mortality by 30%; \n(ii)  reducing  the  number  of  deliveries  without  assistance;  (iii)  reducing  children\u2019s  respiratory \ninfection  and  diarrhea;  (iv)  improving  maternal  and  child  health  by  at  preventing  at  least  200 \ndeaths;  and  (v)  increasing  allocation  for  PHC.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  HSRP  were \nquantified  based  on  varying  assumptions.  Table  A18.1  presents  the  key  benefit  assumptions \nand corresponding economic rate of return and net present value (NPV) of the HSRP. \n                                                 \n \n    \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f                Base Data \n \n6,200,000 \n350,000 \n1 \n9 \n90,000,000 \n5,080,645 \n10 \n508,065 \n0.5 \n450,000 \n958,065 \n \n\n \n \n2 \n700,000 \n15 \n105,000 \n11,700,000 \n8 \n936,000 \n \n\n \n \n50 \n1 \n350,000 \n65 \n227,500 \n\n2,226,565 \n24.1 \n3,828,079 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n58 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nTable A18.1: Economic Benefits, EIRR, and NPV \n\n \nReduction in Productivity Losses \n\n \n\nPopulation of Tajikistan \nPopulation in the Pilot Areas \nGDP ($ billion)  \nProductivity Loss (% GDP) \nProductivity Loss Whole Country ($) \nProductivity Loss in Pilot Areas (n $) \nReduction in Productivity Loss in Pilot Areas \nTotal Annual Reduction of Loss in Pilot Areas ($) (A) \nReduction in Productivity Loss for the Rest of the Country (%) \nTotal Annual Reduction of Loss for the Rest of the Country ($) (B) \nTotal Annual Reduction in Productivity Loss (Pilot + rest of the country) (A + B)  \n\nReduction in Out-of-Pocket Health Expenditure (formal and informal payments) \n\nOut-of-Pocket Health Expenditure ($ per capita per year) \nTotal Out-of-Pocket Annual Expenditure in Pilot Areas ($) \nReduction in Annual Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (%) \nTotal Annual Reduction in Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (pilot areas) \nTotal Out-of-Pocket Annual Expenditure in the Whole Country Minus Pilot Areas ($) \nReduction in Annual Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (%) \nTotal Annual Reduction in Out-of-Pocket Expenditure for Whole Country ($) \n\nReduction in expenditure with drugs in pilot areas  \n\nPercentage of Out-of-Pocket Expenditure Spent on Drugs (%) \nOut-of-Pocket Expenditure with Drugs ($ per capita per year) \nTotal Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (Drugs) in Pilot Areas ($) \nPercentage of Yearly Savings Due to the Distribution of Drugs Free of Charge in Pilot Areas (%) \nTotal Drugs Benefit  in the Pilot Areas ($) \n\nTotal Economic Benefits ($) \n\n \nEIRR (%) \nNPV ($) \n\nEIRR = economic rate of return; GDP = gross domestic product; NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6. \nThe 1998 Viet Nam Living Standards Survey shows that the economic cost of working \ndays  lost  due  to  sickness  is  about  8.7%  of  gross  domestic product (GDP).  The  International \nLabour Organization (ILO) report1 published in April 2003 gives the figure for Latin America  as \n10%,  assuming  that  this  is  the  general  condition  in  developing  countries.  Based  on  these \nreports, the total reduction in productivity loss under the HSRP is estimated at 9% of GDP (10% \nin pilot areas and 0.5% in the whole country). HSRP\u2019s pro-poor health package component aims \nto have a 15% reduction in the out-of-pocket health expenditures of target beneficiaries in the \npilot  districts. It is estimated that the out-of-pocket expenditure averages about $2 per capita.2 \nAlthough  the  component  targets  25%  reduction  in  out-of-pocket  expenditure,  this  analysis \n\n                                                 \n1 International Labour Organization, 2003. Safety in Numbers \n2 Tajikistan Living Standards Survey, 1998. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 18 \n\n59 \n\nconsiders  the  reduction  to  be  15%.  These  conservative  estimates  are  justified since informal \nfees and formal copayment  are  existent  in Tajikistan.  It  is  estimated  that  decreases  in  out-of-\npocket  expenditure  in  the  whole  country  would  be  8%.  Under  the  HSRP,  a  reduction  in \nexpenditure on drugs is assumed to be 65% of out-of-pocket expenditures. This is based on the \nassumption that about 50% out-of-pocket health expenditure is spent on pharmaceuticals.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Rates of Return and Net Present Value \n\nFinancial Sustainability and Fiscal Impact \n\n \nEven with these relatively conservative assumptions, the HSRP yields a return of 24.1%. \n7. \nThese benefits exclude externalities that accrue to the HSRP. Table A18.2 shows the estimated \neconomic internal rate of return for the  HSRP.  The analysis covers 20 years (2003-2023) and \nwas  carried  out  in  constant  2002  prices,  with  domestic  prices used as numeraire.  Economic \ncosts were calculated based on the annual project cost disbursements.  Incremental recurrent \ncosts were estimated at about 5% of capital costs. Tradable goods of capital and operation and \nmaintenance costs were adjusted by a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.20.3 Tradable \ngoods  are  about  50%  of  project  costs.  At  a  discount  rate  of  12%,  NPV  is  $3,828,079.  The \nanalysis indicates that the main factors influencing the economic returns include the reduction in \nproductivity  loss  and  the  reduction  in  out-of-pocket  expenditures  estimated  for  the  whole \ncountry. This means that the extension of the benefits nationwide will be crucial in guaranteeing \nthat  the  investments  will  yield  acceptable  returns.  While  focusing  on  the  pilot  areas,  it  is \nnecessary to consider the systemic gains from the pharmaceutical reforms and capacity building \nat the central level. \n \nB.  \n \n8. \nThe  total  financial  cost  of  the  HSRP  is  $9.375  million  for  5  years.  About  80%  of  the \nHSRP will be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the rest by the Government. \nA  financial  sustainability  analysis  was  done  to  evaluate  HSRP\u2019s  impact  on  the  Government \nbudget under the following assumptions: (i) health expenditure will be  maintained at over 1% of \nGDP and 5% of state expenditure throughout the project period; and (ii) incremental recurrent \ncosts  after  the  Project  will  be  maintained  at  minimal  levels  and  increases  will  be  contained \nthrough  allocation  of  existing  resources.  The Government\u2019s annual share in  project costs will \naverage around $0.38 million,  or about 0.36% of the average annual  health budget (projected) \nof  about  $13.5  million.  The  recurrent  costs  borne  by  the  Government  during  the  HSRP are \nestimated  to  be  about  $0.18  million  per  year  and  include (i)  operating  expenses  for  project \nmanagement, and (ii) operation and maintenance of renovated health facilities and equipment. \nAssuming  the  health  spending  is  maintained,  the  budgetary  impact  of  the  estimated  annual \nrecurrent costs during and after project implementation is considered minimal.  \n \n9. \nIn  the  health  sector,  humanitarian  agencies  finance more than 30% of the  total health \nexpenditures. Users finance about 30%, while the Government covers about 26%. Development \nbanks average 7%.  Humanitarian agencies are withdrawing, but the probability of development \nagencies' support is mixed. ADB has dropped loans for social sectors from the country program \nof 2004-2006. The World Bank's health project is planned for 2006. Bilateral  sources have not \nfirmly committed yet, although $900 million, including a $700 million grant, was pledged at the \nConsultative  Group  meeting  in  May  2003.  Significant  deterioration  may  happen  to  health \nexpenditure over the  years. It is critical to keep updating  the full picture of  all financing sources \nto capture overall budgetary implications.  \n\n                                                 \n3 Based on Asian
