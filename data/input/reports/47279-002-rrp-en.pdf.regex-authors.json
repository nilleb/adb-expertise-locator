THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Karachi Bus Rapid Transit Red Line Project. The report \nalso describes the proposed administration of (i) a loan to be provided by each of the Asian \nInfrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), and Green \nClimate Fund (GCF), and (ii) a grant to be provided by GCF, all for the Karachi Bus Rapid Transit \nRed Line Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the loans and the grant. \n \n2.  The proposed project will help increase the use of quality public transport in Karachi by \ndelivering the 26.6-kilometer (km) Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line corridor and associated \nfacilities, directly benefiting 1.5 million people.1 The project is economically justified by major time \nsavings for BRT passengers; vehicle operating cost savings; and better air quality and reduced \ncarbon emissions through an innovative waste-to-fuel scheme, which will improve the public \nhealth and mitigate climate change. It will also make Karachi safer, greener, and more inclusive \nand competitive. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Background and issues. Karachi is Pakistan\u2019s largest city and its main seaport and \neconomic and financial center. The population of this fast-expanding megacity was estimated at \n15 million in the 2017 census, and 23 million for the metropolitan area. Karachi is one of the most \ndensely populated cities in the world and is consistently ranked as one of the world\u2019s most \nunlivable cities, largely because of traffic congestion and induced air and noise pollution.2 Car and \nmotorcycle ownership is still low but fast-increasing because of a growing middle class. With other \nfactors such as weak traffic management and inefficient public transport, rapid motorization \nworsens congestion and pollution.3 Karachi is one of the largest cities in the world without a formal \npublic transport and mass transit system, and until 2015, large investments in flyovers reflected \nthe prioritization of private road transport over public transport.4 \n \n4.  Karachi\u2019s transport system does not deliver mobility for all and is marked by long commute \ntimes, the rise of private and paratransit modes, and the decline of public transport (Table 1). \nServices are provided by paratransit vehicles and about 4,000 privately owned buses, which \ntogether serve 2.8 million passengers daily. These weakly regulated services are irregular and \nlack  designated  stops and  customer standards.  Drivers  compete  and  pull  over to  pick  up \npassengers at will, or wait idling on the side of the road until their vehicles are full, worsening \ncongestion and impairing safety. During peak commute times, it is common for passengers to sit \non the roof or hang from the side of moving vehicles. Vehicles in this informal network tend to be \nold and poorly maintained, leading to increased emissions and higher operating costs. Services \ntend to be costly for the urban poor, as customers must pay for each transfer between modes. \n                                                \n1  About 1.5 million people (10% of Karachi\u2019s population) live within 1 km of a bus rapid transit (BRT) station, including \noff-corridor services, and would potentially benefit from the proposed system. \n2  The Economist Intelligence Unit. 2018. Global Liveability Report 2018. London. Karachi ranks 137th out of 140 cities. \n3  The project environmental impact assessment measured a 24-hour average concentration of particulate matter of \nfewer than 10 micrometers at 109\u2013141 micrograms per cubic meter in six locations along the BRT corridor. The level \nrecommended by the World Health Organization is 50 micrograms per cubic meter for a 24-hour measuring sample. \n4  In 2015, the Government of Sindh province, supported by the federal government, started reinvesting in public \ntransport with the BRT Green Line and Orange Line Projects, which are currently still under implementation. \n ", "2 \nTherefore, 40% of all city trips are still being made on foot. Karachi\u2019s poorest, women, children, \nelderly, and people with disabilities would benefit from a safe, efficient and accessible public \ntransport system. \n \nTable 1: Karachi\u2019s Modal Share for Motorized Trips \n  Private Modes  Paratransit (Taxis  Public Transport \n  Cars  Motorcycles  and Rickshaws)  (Buses and Minibuses) \nItem  2008  2018  2008  2018  2008  2018  2008  2018 \nTotal vehicles in Karachi  36.5%  31%  47.3%  53%  9.9%  13%  6.3%  3% \nTotal passengers transported  24.5%  21%  16.0%  33%  6.0%  12%  53.5%  34% \nSources: Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2012.

During 2008\u20132012, the Government of Sindh province, with support \nfrom the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), developed and approved the Karachi \nTransportation Improvement Project, which comprises a transport master plan that proposed a \nmass transit network composed of the revival of the Karachi Circular Railway, two metro rail lines, \nand six BRT lines; the Red, Green, and Yellow lines were prioritized for implementation.5 Building \non this initiative, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance (TA) to \nprepare this project.6 ADB also approved a $9.7 million project design advance (PDA) loan from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources in September 2016.7 \n \n6.  Alignment with country strategy. The project is consistent with the Government of \nPakistan\u2019s Vision 2030, Framework for Economic Growth, and National Climate Change Policy. \nIt supports priorities set out in the Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020 and in the manifesto \nof the newly elected federal government, which pledges to transform Karachi into a vibrant \ncompetitive megacity, including the provision of mass transit.8 It aligns with ADB\u2019s Sustainable \nTransport Initiative; country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2015\u20132019; and Strategy 2030 as \nit contributes to the strategy\u2019s principles and operational priorities such as promoting \u201clivable \ncities\u201d,9 \u201caccelerating progress in gender equality\u201d, \u201ctackling climate change and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability\u201d, and supporting the \u201cuse of innovative technologies\u201d.10 Coordination \nwith development partners such as AFD, AIIB, GCF, JICA, the World Bank and the Aga Khan \nTrust for Culture has been ensured. \n                                                \n5  JICA. 2012.

The project design incorporates lessons learned from past assistance, notably the need \nfor (i) strong political support and consensus; (ii) a robust governance structure; (iii) thorough \nproject preparation and readiness prior to proceeding with project approval; (iv) realistic project \nimplementation timeline; and (v) sound construction supervision and contract management.11 \nPrivate  sector  participation  is  being  supported  for  BRT  operations  (para.  23)  but  not  for \nconstruction under a public\u2013private partnership arrangement; globally, few mass transit systems \nrecover capital costs through revenue alone, as fares must be affordable.12 \n \n8.  Value added by ADB assistance (para. 5): \n(i)  Institutional development. ADB supported the establishment and assists in \nbuilding  the  capacity  of  a  special  purpose  vehicle  called  TransKarachi, \nincorporated in October 2018.13 The Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA) is \nresponsible for regulating, planning, and funding urban mobility for all cities in \nSindh province. TransKarachi will implement the project and manage service \ncontracts for BRT operations in Karachi. \n(ii)  Waste-to-fuel innovation. ADB promotes environmental sustainability through \nthe production and use of biomethane from cattle waste to fuel the BRT fleet of \ncompressed natural gas (CNG) hybrid buses. \n(iii)  Universal accessibility and nonmotorized transport. ADB ensures that the \nproject design includes (a) a bicycle-sharing system, bicycle lanes, and other non-\nmotorized transport vehicles for first and last mile connectivity; and (b) universal \naccessibility and other gender-friendly features in BRT stations and buses. \n(iv)  Operations plan and financial sustainability. ADB promotes a third-generation \nBRT system using a direct service operational model, which allows BRT vehicles \nto travel along the BRT corridor in the busiest parts of the city and off-corridor in \nless congested areas. A modern fare system using smart cards to enable distance-\nbased  fares  will  facilitate  this  approach,  expanding  the  system\u2019s  reach  and \ncapacity, reducing passenger transfers, and increasing ridership and financial \nsustainability. The project is designed primarily to limit operational subsidies. \n(v)  Bus industry transition. ADB emphasizes engagement with the existing bus \nindustry and establishes a negotiation process that enables existing operators to \nparticipate in the new BRT system. The project design includes a fleet scrapping \nprogram and compensation mechanism for nonparticipating operators. \n(vi)  Climate change. ADB assessed the project\u2019s vulnerability to climate change \nimpacts and addresses climate risks in the project\u2019s design. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The project is aligned with the following impact: quality of life in Karachi improved. The \nproject will have the following outcome: use of quality public transport in Karachi increased.14 \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2005.

From 2004 to 2008, ADB prepared this investment program for Karachi, which included \nBRT corridors. The Program was finally dropped in 2009 because of disagreement between the provincial \ngovernment and the municipality.

Outputs \n \n10.  Output 1: Red Line bus rapid transit corridor and associated facilities constructed. \nThe Red Line BRT system encompasses (i) the 24.2-km Red Line main corridor; (ii) a 2.4-km \nsection of the common corridor along which all BRT lines merge in the city-center;15 and (iii) off-\ncorridor direct and feeder service routes connecting the corridor to nearby communities. The Red \nLine corridor will be restructured over its entire width (facade-to-facade), including (i) the BRT \ninfrastructure comprising 29 stations and dedicated lanes built mainly at grade in the median; (ii) \nthe mixed-traffic roadway with up to six lanes in each direction; (iii) the nonmotorized transport \ninfrastructure along the corridor comprising bicycle lanes, improved sidewalks, and energy-\nefficient  street  lights;  (iv)  on-street  parking  and  landscaped  green  areas  added  in  various \nlocations; and (v) improved drainage to climate-proof the corridor. The BRT infrastructure will be \ncompleted with two depots, one underground staging facility, an extension of the BRT control \ncenter, and off-corridor bus stops. The common corridor section will be remodeled to create \nnotably a 1-km mall reserved only for pedestrians and BRT buses. Facades of selected historical \nbuildings along the common corridor will be restored, and utilities buried, providing a new \nlandmark and quality public space for the city. \n \n11.  Output 2: BRT operations established. This will be done through (i) capacity building of \nthe SMTA and TransKarachi; (ii) the design of the BRT business model and subsidy-free \noperations; (iii) a bus industry transition program, comprising a fleet scrapping program and \ncompensation mechanism; (iv) effective project communication; and (v) the delivery of the BRT \nfleet, feeder e-vehicles, intelligent transport systems (including a distance-based fare system, a \nbicycle sharing system and others), and a biogas plant.16 \n \nD.

Technical \n \n22.  The project\u2019s technical viability has been confirmed under ADB\u2019s PDA.26 The 26.6 km BRT \ncorridor alignment was carefully selected to capture major demand hubs while verifying the \npossibility of retrofitting the BRT infrastructure (stations and dedicated lanes) in congested and \nnarrower sections. The BRT is at grade for 88% of its length, allowing 80 km of off-corridor service \nroutes to enter the dedicated infrastructure. Only six underpasses with a total length of 2.43 km, \nand one elevated rotary of 0.85 km in length are planned for BRT to allow full segregation and \nmaximum commercial speed at critical junctions. The mixed-traffic roadway has (i) up to 6 lanes, \nincluding service roads, in each direction in wider sections, and (ii) 16 grade-separated structures, \nincluding 3 underpasses of a total length of 1 km, 8 elevated U-turns of a total length of 3.89 km, \nand 5 flyovers of a total length of 2.09 km, to allow for all traffic movement while accommodating \nBRT at grade. Overall, the project comprises road works of a total length of 31.8 km, including 23 \ngrade-separated structures of a total length of 10.3 km. A climate risk vulnerability assessment \nhas also led to innovative drainage measures to climate-proof the BRT corridor from floods.27 \n \n23.  The BRT system was planned using a detailed methodology, including the inventory and \nanalysis of existing services to determine current service capacity and existing demand, and a \npurpose-built demand model. Based on the results of this analysis, an optimized routing and \nnetwork plan was developed to ensure maximum ridership and financial sustainability of the \nsystem without the need for operational subsidies. The institutional structure has been improved \nby the establishment of the SMTA and TransKarachi, which will manage and control the overall \nquality of the BRT system\u2019s operations. System quality will be enhanced by maximizing the use \nof  private  sector  contracts for system  operations. TransKarachi  will  oversee  private  sector \n                                                \n26 The engineering, procurement, and construction management consultant team has conducted various surveys on \nthe corridor\u2019s topography, hydrology, geology, and utilities. Based on the results of these surveys, the operational \ndesign and business model consultant team revisited the preliminary engineering design. ADB and the Sindh Mass \nTransit Authority have confirmed the feasibility of such design and instructed the engineering, procurement, and \nconstruction management consultant team to proceeded with the detailed engineering design, which has been \ncompleted in May 2019. \n27 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \ncontracts of companies for (i) bus operations; (ii) system control, encompassing the fare system, \nstation services, and bicycle-sharing system; (iii) the financial clearinghouse; and (iv) commercial \nservices such as property management and advertising. \n \n24.  A cost\u2013benefit analysis of different vehicle and fuel technologies led to the choice of CNG \nhybrid buses for the BRT fleet, with an estimated reduction of 77,979 metric tons of carbon dioxide \nemissions per year.28 This result will be further improved by the introduction of a waste-to-fuel \nscheme, which will also significantly improve the system\u2019s operational and financial results by \nlowering the cost at entry for CNG fuel. Locally produced biomethane from cattle waste is indeed \nexpected to be five to eight times cheaper than market-price imported CNG, which led to the \ninclusion of the biogas plant as a capital subsidy under the GCF loan. \n \n25.  The waste-to-fuel scheme will also have a significant environmental benefit, as more than \n7,000 tons of cattle waste is currently produced daily at farms in Karachi\u2019s Cattle Colony, and this \nwaste is then discarded into Karachi Bay, with highly negative impact both to the local ecology \nand the global environment. The project will eliminate current methane emissions, as the waste \nwill be converted into biomethane, which will be the fuel source for the BRT vehicles.   \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  The project aims to provide a high-frequency transit service, replacing informal modes of \ntransport traveling in mixed traffic, with fuel-efficient BRT vehicles traveling in segregated lanes \nat high speeds. In the first year of BRT operations, demand is expected to reach 320,000 \npassengers per day. By 2021, vehicle operating cost savings are expected to reach $23 million \nper year, while time savings for BRT passengers and the remaining mixed traffic will reach $54 \nmillion per year. Additional benefits from reduced fatalities and greenhouse gas emissions will \nreach $16.4 million per year. The economic analysis yielded an economic internal rate of return \nof  20%,  demonstrating  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability.29  To  ensure  a  robust  result,  three \nsensitivity tests were conducted for the following scenarios: (i) 20% capital cost overrun, (ii) 20% \nreduction in passenger ridership, and (iii) 2-year delay in system opening. All scenarios meet the \n9% minimum economic internal rate of return required for an ADB-financed project. \n \n27.  The BRT operational plan was designed to make sure that revenue generated from the \nsystem will cover operation and maintenance costs. The BRT system generates revenue from (i) \ndistance-based fares ranging from PRs15 to PRs55, and averaging PRs35; (ii) advertising; and \n(iii) rent on concession shops in stations and depots. In the absence of a cost recovery tariff, a \nconventional financial evaluation based on cash flow analysis leading to the computation of a \nfinancial internal rate of return was not considered appropriate.30 Instead, a financial model was \ndeveloped, and an analysis of the net operating cash flow was conducted to confirm that revenues \nwill cover operating costs in various scenarios. The results showed that using locally produced \nbiofuel significantly improves the system\u2019s financial performance. In most scenarios, the future \nfinancial position of TransKarachi confirms solid net cash flows and its financial capacity to cover \nrecurrent costs to sustain the facilities developed under the project. \n \n                                                \n28 ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n29 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 The Government of Sindh will repay the loan from its own resources and will consider the capital investment \n(including the BRT infrastructure and initial fleet) as an up-front subsidy. Accordingly, TransKarachi will not need to \nrepay the loan from the BRT system\u2019s operational revenue. Therefore, the terms and conditions of the ADB, AFD, \nAIIB, and GCF loans will not impact this financial analysis. \n \n ", "9 \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  The project financial management and procurement risk assessments found substantial \npre-mitigation risks from the newly established implementing agency.31 The SMTA and the \nGovernment of Sindh\u2019s Transport and Mass Transit Department agreed on an action plan to build \na  robust  financial  management  system  and  procurement  capacity  within  TransKarachi  by \nengaging consultants to provide support during project implementation. The assessed risk is \nbased  on  TransKarachi\u2019s  (i)  internal  control  environment,  (ii)  experience  in  implementing \ndevelopment projects, (iii) supervisory procedures, and (iv) financial capability. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government of Sindh, the SMTA, and TransKarachi. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 17).  \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  The project will benefit Karachi\u2019s estimated population of 15 million (75% of whom are \npoor or low income) through increased access to safe, reliable, and affordable public transport. \nAbout 320,000 passengers are expected to use BRT daily, with the share of female passengers \nreaching 15% in 2022 (first year of operation) and increasing to 20% by the end of 2023 (last year \nof project implementation). The low share of female passengers in public transport is mainly \nbecause of the risk of harassment that women face in overcrowded public buses. Consequently, \nmost women prefer to walk 2 km per day on average or are forced to use more expensive private \ntransportation, affecting their disposable income. The project will establish universal access and \nsafety features for women, children, and people with disabilities in (i) all 29 BRT stations, including \nproper lighting and monitoring through closed-circuit television cameras; and (ii) buses, including \nsegregated areas for women and staff trained to deal with harassment incidents. The project is \nclassified effective gender mainstreaming and will encourage women\u2019s participation by ensuring \nthat 15% of BRT operations employees and TransKarachi staff are women. Overall, the project \nis expected to generate 2,130 jobs directly through BRT operations, including 1,424 jobs for \nstation services such as ticketing, security, and cleaning; 615 jobs in bus operations such as \ndriving, conducting, and mechanics; and 81 staff jobs in TransKarachi.32 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.33 \n \n32.  Environment (category A). The SMTA prepared (i) an environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) for the 24.2-km main corridor; (ii) a supplementary environmental impact assessment for \nthe 2.4 km common corridor section; and (iii) environmental management plans; all in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). An initial environmental examination will be \ncompleted  at  a  later  stage,  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  assessment  and review \nframework, for the biogas plant whose site has yet to be finalized. During the construction phase, \nanticipated negative environmental impacts of the project are related to traffic disruptions and \naccess to properties, relocation of utilities, tree cutting, air quality, community health and safety, \n                                                \n31 Financial Management Assessment Report; and Procurement Risk Assessment Report (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB.

Adequate mitigation measures have been \nincorporated  into  the  project  design  and  will  be  implemented  through  the  environmental \nmanagement  plans,  which  include  a  capacity  building  program  for  TransKarachi  staff  and \ncontractors during the procurement and construction stages. During the operation phase, the \nproject is expected to have mostly positive impacts, specifically on the acoustic environment, \nbecause of the modal shift. A computer noise model notably shows that traffic noise levels would \nbe substantially reduced (by almost 20 A-weighted decibels) along the 1-km mall reserved for \npedestrians and BRT buses, and would remain the same along other sections of the corridor \nwhere BRT buses will run in parallel with mixed vehicular traffic.34 In addition, and beside its \noverall positive carbon footprint (para. 24 and 25), the project is expected to have a positive impact \non the air quality along the corridor since BRT buses will be operating primarily on biomethane. \nThe project complies with public disclosure and consultation requirements. Consultations with \nstakeholders were conducted for the main and common corridors from December 2017 to March \n2019. Public hearings, attended by more than 100 stakeholders, were conducted in mid-October \n2018 for the main corridor. A draft consolidated EIA report was disclosed on the ADB website on \n28 February 2019. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category  A). Civil works for the project\u2019s 24.2 km main \ncorridor and 2.4 km common corridor section will not involve acquisition of any private land. \nHowever, it will displace 774 persons and entities from the main corridor, including (i) 223 owners \nof small shops that will lose structure extensions; (ii) 77 public and private organizations that need \nto shift their minor structures and equipment within their premises; and (iii) 275 owners and 199 \nworkers from micro businesses occupying the existing right-of-way. Temporary and permanent \nalternative locations for vending near the BRT corridor are being explored by the project to assist \nthe affected micro businesses. Permanent formal vending spaces included in the project design \nwill also be open to interested business owners including those affected by the project. The \napproved draft resettlement plan for the main corridor has been updated following the detailed \ndesign. An additional 139 vendors will be displaced from the common corridor section for which \na draft resettlement plan has been prepared in consultation with the affected persons and relevant \nagencies. The proposed underground staging facility will affect the sports ground near Numaish \nthat is leased by Karachi Metropolitan Corporation to Karachi Goan Association. Impact from the \nbiogas plant is still to be confirmed once the site has been finalized. TransKarachi will update and \nimplement the resettlement plans on behalf of the SMTA. \n \n34.  Indigenous  peoples (category  C). The  project  is  in  Karachi  where no  indigenous \npeoples, as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, reside. The project will not affect \nany indigenous communities, and no indigenous peoples planning documents are required. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n35.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n \n                                                \n34  A-weighted decibels, abbreviated dBA, are an expression of the relative loudness of sounds in the air as perceived \nby the human ear. In the A-weighted system, the decibel values of sounds at low frequencies are reduced, compared \nwith unweighted decibels, in which no correction is made for audio frequency. This correction is made because the \nhuman ear is less sensitive at low audio frequencies, especially below 1000 Hertz, than at high audio frequencies. \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nPublic transport users do not  Project design advance consultants estimated demand using detailed surveys and \nuse BRT at projected levels.  a sophisticated model, factoring in the use of an innovative operations plan and \ncommunication strategy that will likely boost ridership. \nVested interests of existing  Existing operators.

Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020. Karachi. \nb  Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. 2016. The BRT Standard. New York. The BRT Standard is an \nevaluation tool for BRT corridors based on international best practices. It is also the centerpiece of a global effort by \nleaders in BRT design to establish a common definition of BRT and to ensure that BRT corridors more uniformly \ndeliver world-class passenger experiences, significant economic benefits, and positive environmental impacts. The \nstandard functions as a planning tool, scoring system, and means of achieving a common definition of BRT. \nc  Examples of gender-inclusive design features include (i) separate queuing spaces for men and women; (ii) marked \npriority seating in waiting areas for the elderly, pregnant women, and PWDs; (iii) separate restrooms for men and \nwomen; and (iv) well-lit and unobstructed floor design with visible and operational CCTVs to discourage any form of \nharassment. Specific gender-inclusive design features and operational safety features in stations and buses are \nprovided in the Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the report and \nrecommendation of the President). \nd  The 2018 baseline for the main corridor: (i) deteriorated and encroached sidewalks; (ii) various number of mixed-\ntraffic lanes, from three to six lanes per direction, encroached by illegally parked vehicles that limit capacity to two or \nthree effective lanes per direction; and (iii) wide unused roadway median. Because of the retrofitting of the BRT \ninfrastructure in the median and full remodeling of the corridor over its entire width, mixed-traffic lanes will be shifted \nto the sides and their number reduced, while keeping the same effective capacity by removing illegally parked \nvehicles and encroachments. Bicycle lanes will be added on both sides, sidewalks will be rebuilt and improved, green \nareas, on-street parking and small markets for displaced informal vendors will be added in various locations wherever \nspace permits, and streetlights will be improved through the introduction of energy-efficient LED lighting. \ne  Any CNG quantity required to fuel the BRT fleet that could not be provided through the proposed biogas plant will be \npurchased by TransKarachi on the market, where it is in widespread use. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "16  Appendix 2 \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=47279-002-3 \n \n 1.
