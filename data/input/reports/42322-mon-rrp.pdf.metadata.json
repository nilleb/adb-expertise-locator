The environmental implications were reviewed and no \nAssessment  adverse impact was identified. \n   \nSocial   Involuntary resettlement: Category C \nSafeguard  Impact on indigenous peoples: Category C \nAssessment  No involuntary resettlement or adverse impact on indigenous peoples \nis expected from program and project implementation. \n   \nRationale  Soaring food prices in Mongolia pose a serious threat to nutritional \nwelfare  and  could  reverse  recent  gains  in  poverty  reduction  and \nhuman development in the country. Inflation reduces real incomes \nand expenditure and has strong social and poverty impacts. Higher \nfood prices are not merely short-term phenomena that the market will \nautomatically  correct.  Rising  inflation  has  strong  implications  for \nmacroeconomic stability, poverty incidence, and inequality. There is \nample reason for the Government to intervene in the short-term by \nestablishing  targeted  subsidy  programs  to  alleviate  the  impact  of \ninflation on the poor. While the needed response is urgent, it also \npresents an opportunity to introduce innovative safety nets that are \nwell  targeted  towards  the  poor.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  an \nopportunity to improve targeting mechanisms; strengthen systems, \ncapacities, and strategies for effective social welfare service delivery; \nand  establish  early  detection,  mitigation,  and  rapid  response \nmechanisms for food crises and similar emergencies. The grant is in \ndirect support of government plans to provide targeted assistance to \nthe  poor,  and  supports  the  country  partnership  strategy  pillar  of \ninclusive social development (in preparation). The design is in line \nwith the development agenda of inclusive economic growth in ADB\u2019s \nlong-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)  and \nresponds  directly  to  the  President\u2019s  pledge  at  the  ADB  Annual \nMeeting in Madrid to assist developing member countries to address \nthe problem of soaring food prices. \n \n   ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the grants is reduced vulnerability to food insecurity \nthrough  increased  food  supply  and  improved  access  to  food  for \nvulnerable and poor households. The outcome is improved access to \nfood  by  vulnerable  and  poor  households  through  a  targeted  food \nstamp program and strengthened social welfare systems. \n   \nProgram Grant  It is proposed that ADB supports the Government\u2019s policy reforms by \nAmount  providing a grant of $9 million to Mongolia to fund the design and \nimplementation of a food stamp program (component 1). \n   \nProgram Period and  The implementation period of the Program will be 36 months. It will be \nTranching  completed by 31 December 2011. Funding of the Program will be \nreleased to the Government in a single payment of $9 million upon \nprogram effectiveness, including the Government\u2019s fulfillment of the \npolicy  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  as  confirmed  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy letter. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the Program. \nand Implementation  The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor will be the Implementing \nArrangements  Agency. A program steering committee composed of the Ministry of \nFinance and other ministries dealing with the food crisis, selected \nlocal government representatives, nongovernment organizations, civil \nsociety, and the private sector will meet quarterly to provide policy \nand strategic guidance to the Program. ADB will participate as an \nobserver on the committee. \n   \nProcurement  In  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  and  procurement \nprocedure for program loans, the grant proceeds may be utilized to \nprocure  goods  and  services  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes) \nproduced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than \nthose specified in the list of ineligible items, those financed by other \nmultilateral and bilateral official sources, and imports from non-ADB \nmember countries. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the \ngrant  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government \ncertification. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the short-term adjustment \ncost generated through the design and implementation of the food \nstamp program (component 1). \n   \nProject Grant  The objective of the Project grant is to assist the Government in \nimplementing the food stamp program; provide capacity development; \nstrengthen  social  welfare  systems;  and  establish  early  detection, \nmitigation,  and  rapid  response  mechanisms  for  food  crises  and \nsimilar emergencies. \n   \nProject Investment  The total project cost is estimated at $3.33 million equivalent. \nPlan   \n \n \n \n   ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  A project grant of $3 million, representing 90% of the Project\u2019s total \ncost,  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The \nGovernment  will  contribute  the  equivalent  of  $0.33  million  as \ncounterpart funds. The grant will be subject to conditions set forth in \nthe Grant Agreement. \n \nSource  Total  % \n($ \u2018000) \nAsian Development Bank   3,000   90 \nGovernment   330   10 \n  Total  3,330  100 \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The  Project  duration  is  36  months.  It  will  be  completed  by  31 \nand Estimated  December 2011 and closed on 30 June 2012.  \nProject Completion \nDate \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Finance is the Executing Agency. The Project will \nand Implementation  have  the  same  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  steering \nArrangements  committee, and implementing unit as that of the Program. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the Project grant will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require a total of 43 person-months of international \n  and  76  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). \n   \nBenefits and  Key benefits and beneficiaries are as follows: \nBeneficiaries   \n  Targeted  Safety  Net.  The  grants  will  provide  assistance  to  the \nGovernment  for  delivering  targeted  safety  nets  to  the  poor  and \nvulnerable at the time when the need is most urgent. The grants will \nprotect at least 100,000 poor and vulnerable households from the risk \nof malnutrition, and prevent them from sliding deeper into poverty.  \n \nFiscal Sustainability. By strengthening and reforming social welfare \nsystems, especially improving targeting, the grants will contribute to \nimproved performance and fiscal sustainability of the social welfare \nsector. \n \nGender Benefits. Women are the most likely users of the stamps, \nand  will  increase  their  ability  to  balance  the  household  budget, \nincrease their involvement in community concerns, and benefit from \nincreased awareness on their benefits and rights through the grants\u2019 \ninformation and education activities.  \n \n \n ", "iv   \nImproved Local Capacity. The grants place emphasis on improving \nthe capacities of local governments and livelihood councils to deliver \ntargeted safety nets and social welfare assistance. This emphasis \ndirectly benefits poor and vulnerable people in terms of effective and \ntimely assistance. \n \nCivil  Society  Participation.  The  grants  recognize  civil  society\u2019s \npotential contributions in improving targeting of social welfare and in \nmobilizing its participation in implementing the FNSWPP. \n \nInstitutional Impact. Government institutions\u2014particularly Ministry of \nSocial Welfare and Labor, the provincial and district level soum and \nkhoroo governors, local social workers, and livelihood councils\u2014will \ngain increased capacities for reforming and delivering social welfare \nservices, and integrating civil society organizations and the private \nsector in the implementation of the grants. \n   \nRisks and Mitigation  Major risks and mitigation measures considered in the design of the \nFNSWPP are as follows: \n \nPolitical Risks. Government ministries are concerned that the plans \nand programs developed to respond to increasing food prices will \nhave to go through another process of review and scrutiny by the new \nGovernment, thus causing delays to the implementation of the grants. \nThe new minister of finance and minister of social welfare and labor \nhave  been  informed  about  the  preparation  of  the  assistance. \nGovernment officials directly involved in the preparation of the grants \nare still in place and are expected to remain. \n \nPilot-Testing Risks. The risks here are twofold: (i) beneficiaries will \nexpect a pilot to immediately become an entitlement, thus making \nlater program adjustments difficult; and (ii) the pilot will remain just a \npilot  even  if  the  results  are  good  and  the  recommendations  are \nappropriate. These risks will be addressed through consultation and \nclose involvement of beneficiaries in implementation of the pilots and \ncontinuous policy dialogue with the highest levels of government on \nsocial welfare institutional reforms in order to facilitate the adoption of \npilot-testing results, especially on targeting. \n \nGovernance and Bureaucratic Risks. Implementation of food safety \nnets is prone to corruption and requires proper governance, a high \ndegree of accuracy, and synchronization of efforts and activities. To \nmanage this risk, the food stamp operating unit will be immediately \nestablished to ensure that technical requirements of the program are \ngiven  full  attention  by  the  Government.  Governance  risk  will  be \naddressed through the provision of clear operational guidelines, a \ncommunication strategy to make the food stamp program transparent, \nand external monitoring. \n ", "96o  00'E 111o  00'E\nMONGOLIA\nFOOD AND NUTRITION SOCIAL WELFARE \nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\nPROGRAM AND PROJECT\nHanh\n50 o 00'N 50 o 00'N\nUlaanbayshint Ulaangom Hatgal\nUVS Altanbulag\nHOVSGOL\nDayaTnsengel Tsagaannuur Naranbulag Tes Tsagaan-Uul Moron BULGANSuhbaatar SELENGE Ereentsav\nBAYAN- Olgiy Olgiy Selenge Darhan\nOLGIY Tudevtey Hutag-Ondor Erdenet DARHAN-UUL Bayan-Uul\nDORNOD Havirga\nHovd ZAVHAN Bulgan ORHONSumber\nARHANGAY ULAANBAATAR HENTIY Choybalsan\nManhan Uliastay Tsahir BattsHeisnhgiegl Ondor ULAANBAABTaAgRanuur Batnorov\nDariv Lun Nalayh\nHOVD Tayshir Tsetserleg ZuuTnOmVod Maanit Ondorhaan Monhhaan Matad Tamsagbulag\nYarantay Harhorin GOVISUMBER\nUyench Altay Bayanhongor Choyr Baruun-Urt\nTogrog Buutsagaan Arvayheer Erdenetsagaan\nBichigt\nMandalgovi\nNariynteel SUHBAATAR\nGOVI-ALTAY\nOVORHANGAY\nDUNDGOVI Saynshand\nBurgastay BAYANHONGOR\nTsogt-Ovoo DORNOGOVI\nZamyn-Uud\nDalanzadgad\n42 o 00'N OMNOGOVI Bayan-Ovoo 42 o 00'N\nNational Capital\nGashuun Suhayt\nProvincial Capital\nCity/Town\nN\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC Main Road\nOF  CHINA  Provincial Road\nRailway\n0 50 100150200250\nRiver\nKilometers Provincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\n0 Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n8\n-4\n0\n5\n7 H 96o  00'E 111o  00'E\nR", " \nI.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a policy \nprogram grant, and (ii) a capacity development project grant to Mongolia for the proposed Food \nand  Nutrition  Social  Welfare  Program  and  Project  (FNSWPP).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework of the FNSWPP is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n2.  Global  Food  Prices.  Over the past year (2007-2008), food prices have soared to \nunprecedented levels all over the world1 with essential grains such as rice and wheat escalating \non international markets (rice by 196% and wheat by 72%).2 The supply and demand factors \nunderlying the price increases include rising oil prices, which are driving up prices of fertilizers \nand fuels for agricultural production, increasing diversion of food crop acreage to biofuels, and \ngrowing  demands  for  grains  as  a  result  of  population  and  income  growth  in  emerging \neconomies and associated dietary changes. Other factors\u2014such as random adverse weather \nconditions,3 depreciation of the US dollar,4 and precautionary demand for food stocks in many \ncountries5\u2014have also contributed to the spike in food grain prices. Policy responses, such as \nexport bans by rice-exporting countries (India, Pakistan, People\u2019s Republic of China, and Viet \nNam), have also resulted in increased price volatility. While the unpredictable and short-term \nfactors of weather conditions, depreciation of the US dollar and precautionary demand for food \nstocks are significant, they are expected to ease over the coming years. However, the supply \nand  demand  factors  fueling  the  price  increases,  when combined  with  climate change  and \nnatural resource degradation, result in medium- to long-term impacts and indicate that the \nproblem of high food prices will continue into the foreseeable future. In July 2008, the United \nNations High Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis reported that, while food commodity \nprices appear to be stabilizing, prices are expected to remain high over the medium- to long-\nterm (footnote 1).  \n \n3.  The most immediate consequence of rising food prices is the risk that an additional 100 \nmillion people (added to the already 845 million who are estimated to be undernourished) are \nbeing driven into poverty and hunger (footnote 1), thus jeopardizing recent achievements in \npoverty  reduction,  attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),6 and  social \nstability. The challenge for governments around the world is to mitigate the immediate impacts \nof rising food prices, especially for the poor, and to develop medium- and long-term strategies \nfor addressing the root causes. \n \n                                                 \n1  United Nations (UN) High Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis. 2008. Comprehensive Framework for \nAction. New York. \n2   Food and Agriculture Organization database. 2008. \n3   Food and Agriculture Organization. 2008. World wheat production declined in 2006 because of a 60% reduction of \noutput in drought-hit Australia, flooding in South Asia, and pest infestation and cold weather in Viet Nam.  \n4  Depreciation of the US dollar contributed to increases in the prices of \u201csoft\u201d commodities (including wheat), the \nprices of which are denominated in US dollars. \n5  Precautionary demand is defined as replenishing depleted stocks, reports of hoarding by private traders, and \nsustained procurement by some countries (such as Bangladesh and the Philippines) in international markets. \n6   Particularly those related to poverty, child mortality, maternal health, and education. ", "2   \n4.  Soaring Food Prices in Mongolia. The spike in food and oil prices threatens to push \nlarge numbers of people back below the poverty line in Mongolia.7 The inflation rate reached \n33% in May 2008 and by the end of September 2008 fell just slightly to 32.2% year-on-year, \nwhich  is  much  higher  than  in  most  other  Asian  countries.8 The  prices  of  wheat  (primarily \nimported) and meat (domestically produced) contributed to nearly half of the overall inflation,9 \nwith oil prices accounting for a small but growing proportion. \n \n5.  The underlying dynamics of the steep rise in inflation in Mongolia are multidimensional \n(footnote 7) and are influenced by (i) increasing domestic demand induced by rapid increase of \nwages, social transfers, and remittances; (ii) the impact of imported inflation; (iii) policies that \nhave been built up over the years, such as sustained increases in monetary expansion; (iv) \nincreases  in  the  prices  of  government  services  (i.e.,  hospital  charges,  school  fees,  and \nelectricity tariffs); (v) opportunistic behavior in the domestic market; and (vi) seasonal and \ncyclical factors that aggravate the current situation.  \n \n6.  Both external and domestic factors drive food price inflation in Mongolia. The country \nhas very limited capacity for agricultural food production and imports almost 80% of its food \nfrom the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian Federation, where food prices have also \nsignificantly increased. High international prices transmit directly to local markets, which has \nresulted in staple foods such as rice and flour doubling in price since the beginning of 2008. \nMeat is domestically produced and accounts for 36% of food consumption. Meat prices are \ndependent on domestic rather than external factors, including the number of livestock, weather \nconditions,  consumer  demands,  domestic  meat  procurement  practices,  and  supply  chain \nbottlenecks.10 Mongolia\u2019s macroeconomic context is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n7.  Social Impacts of Rising Food Prices in Mongolia. Evidence on the impact of the \nrising food prices is scant, but the available poverty and household income and expenditure \ndata does reveal that poor households, especially those in urban areas, are particularly at risk \nas  nonfood  expenditures  continue  to  rise.  In  2006,  a  joint  mission  of  the  Government  of \nMongolia (the Government) and a United Nations Food Security Assessment team11 concluded \nthat food insecurity affected around 800,000 people (about 30% of the population) and was on \nthe increase in the largest cities (Darkhan, Erdenet and Ulaanbaatar). Despite rising living \nstandards overall, Mongolia is still considered one of the poorest countries in Asia, with an \noverall poverty rate of 32.6% of the population in 2006, of whom 4.5% are categorized as \nextreme poor. Data from the household income and expenditure survey (2006\u20132007) (footnote \n11) demonstrates that the poorest of the poor now spend about 71% of their consumption \nbudget on food. In March 2008, fear of inflation rapidly escalated to become the number one \nproblem identified by respondents in a survey implemented by the Asia Foundation.12 Over \n20,000 people took to the streets in April 2008 to protest against price increases and the issue \nreceived great attention in the June 2008 general election.  \n                                                 \n7  Palanivel, T. 2008. Policy Note on the Soaring of Food and Oil Prices in Mongolia: Causes, Consequences and \nResponses at the Macro Level. Colombo: United Nations Development Program/Regional Center in Colombo \n(UNDP/RCC).  \n8  Inflation has reached an 11-year high in the People\u2019s Republic of China (at 8.7% in February 2008), a 9-year high \nin the Republic of Korea (at 5.5% in June 2008), a 26-year high in Singapore (at 7.6% in April 2008), and a 12-year \nhigh in Viet Nam (at 25.2% in May 2008). \n9  This is because food prices have increased (on a year-on-year basis) the most over the last year: 59% in May 2008 \nand 57% in June 2008, compared with about 7% during the corresponding months in 2007. Wheat prices have \nincreased by 47% and meat products by 49% since the beginning of 2008. \n10 World Bank. 2008. Mongolia Quarterly. Ulaanbaatar: World Bank (June). \n11 FAO/UNICEF/UNDP. April 2007. Joint Food Security Mission to Mongolia. Ulaanbaatar.  \n12 Asia Foundation. 2008. Mongolia Corruption Benchmarking Survey 2006\u20132008. Ulaanbaatar. ", "  3\n \n8.  Rapid qualitative community consultations carried out in preparation for this grant found \nthat, as a result of the soaring food prices, poor households in rural and urban areas are (i) \nconsuming less food and food of lower quality; (ii) postponing or skipping expenditures for \nschooling and medicines; (iii) limiting travel; (iv) substituting energy sources;13 and (v) moving in \nwith relatives to reduce costs, particularly of food and heating. Many people said they would \nrather be warm than full in the winter months, when rapid escalations in heating costs force \nthem to shift priorities in household budgets. The main impacts of rising prices have been felt \nover the summer months beginning in May\u2013June 2008. As the winter approaches, new stresses \nwill undoubtedly be felt. The 2006 participatory poverty assessment in Mongolia found that the \npoor are much less likely to be able to cope with, and/or recover from, adverse circumstances \nbecause they have decreasing physical and social assets.14 If left unaddressed, in the medium- \nto  long-term,  the  soaring  food  prices  will  have  adverse  impacts  on  health  and  education \n(particularly for women and children) and will result in increased poverty.  \n \n9.  The Government has shown a firm commitment to immediately deliver an emergency \nresponse directed to the poor. The emergency of the food crisis highlights several challenges \nand opportunities for the social welfare sector, such as (i) addressing inadequate systems for \ndelivering assistance targeted to the poor, (ii) defining social welfare strategies and enhancing \ncapacities, and (iii) addressing the absence of emergency response mechanisms. \n \n10.  The  Social  Welfare  Sector. In Mongolia, the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor \n(MSWL) is responsible for the social welfare, social insurance, and employment issues at the \ncentral level.15 There are two implementing agencies under MSWL: the State Social Insurance \nGeneral Office (SSIGO) and the Labor and Social Welfare Office (LSWO). These agencies have \nrepresentatives responsible for delivering services at the local level. Governors of all local \ngovernments16 are obliged by law to undertake area-specific social protection activities.17 MSWL \nis also responsible for developing national policies on women, children, youth, the disabled, and \nthe elderly.    \n \n11.  The  types  of  social  welfare  assistance  provided  through  LSWO  include  (i)  in-kind \nservices (e.g., residential care) for elderly and disabled people, the poor, homeless persons, \nand children; (ii) subsidies to the elderly and disabled related to housing, health care, and \ndevices (e.g., wheelchairs and hearing aids); and (iii) short-term cash benefits for pregnancy \nand delivery, child care, multi-children families, support for adopting orphans and infant care, \nand pensions for those not eligible for assistance from the SSIGO.18  \n \n                                                 \n13 Rural households noted using dung instead of firewood, and urban ger (traditional tent) residents using candles \ninstead of electricity to cut back on energy costs. \n14 National Statistics Office (NSO), ADB, and World Bank. 2006.

In 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a loan to support the Social \nSecurity Sector Development Project (SSSDP)19 to initiate reforms in social welfare, insurance, \nand employment services in relation to the emerging needs in Mongolia\u2019s transition to a free \nmarket economy. The SSSDP has been implemented since February 2002 and, as of its partial \ncompletion in 2007,20 has, among other things, (i) facilitated improvements in social welfare \nfacilities (residential care centers, social security centers, the National Centre for Vocational \nTraining and Rehabilitation for the Disabled);21 (ii) developed and facilitated the adoption of new \nprograms (e.g., the Center-Based Program for Extremely Vulnerable People and Integrated \nCommunity-Based Social Welfare Services); and (iii) provided capacity development to MSWL \nand LSWO in the social welfare sector. \n \n13.  The Government adopted the social security sector strategy paper22 in 2003 as the \nframework for long-term development of the sector.23 The strategy paper defined three long-\nterm policy reforms for social welfare: (i) adjust the centralized public social welfare services \ntowards a comprehensive social welfare system that is community-based and supportive of \nhouseholds\u2019 development, (ii) rationalize the scope for social welfare services and improve cost \nefficiency, and (iii) introduce services that provide care in a family environment. Among the \nstrategies identified are (i) transforming cash-based benefits into multifunctional services based \non the initiative and choice of households and/or individuals; (ii) improving the quality and \naccessibility of social welfare services; (iii) improving the management of, and methodologies in, \nsocial  welfare  services;  and  (iv)  reforming  residential  care  institutions  in  accordance  with \ncommunity-based approaches. The succeeding actions by the Government appear to be highly \ninconsistent with the strategy paper. \n \n14.  In 2005, the Government introduced the child money program,24 which was the first \nsocial welfare assistance that used a proxy means test25 to target poor households. However, in \nMay 2006, the Parliament enacted a new law which made \"child money\" a universal entitlement, \nwith all children below 18 years of age being eligible. Immediately, the number of social welfare \nbeneficiaries  soared  from  less  than  160,000  in  2004  to  more  than  1  million  (40%  of  the \npopulation) in 2006, and ADB expressed two concerns: (i) that making the benefits universal \nwas not consistent with the Government's commitment to implement targeted support for the \npoor, and (ii) that the fiscal sustainability of such welfare measures was unclear.26 Recently, \nnewly  instituted  social  welfare  programs\u2014such  as  the  honored  mothers\u2019  allowance  and \nnewborn and newlywed programs\u2014are more pro-natalist policies rather than being specifically \ngeared towards reducing poverty. \n \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2001.

Government Resolution No. 239. Ulaanbaatar. \n24 The child money program is a targeted conditional cash transfer program launched in January 2005 that provides \ncash allowances for children under the age of 18 to all families with three or more children living under the \nminimum subsistence level. Currently, the child money program provides cash transfers of MNT3,000 ($3) per child \nper month and MNT100,000 ($100) as a lump sum per child per year.   \n25 The proxy means test was developed through collaboration between SSSDP, MSWL, UNDP, and the Poverty \nResearch Group of the Ministry of Finance.  \n26 This resulted in the cancellation of the third tranche of the SSSDP loan. ", "  5\n15.  The concerns raised by ADB capture the prevailing issues in the whole social welfare \nsector to date. All 23 types of current social welfare assistance use population categories27 \nrather than poverty as a basis for eligibility. More than 80% of social welfare beneficiaries since \n2005  are  those  receiving  \u201cchild  money\u201d. 28  Among  the  four  social  protection  indicators \n(expenditure, coverage, poverty targeting, and social protection impact),29 targeting received the \nlowest rating in the social protection index.30 The index gives Mongolia a \u201cbest estimate\u201d overall \npoverty targeting rate of only 60%.  \n \n16.  Social transfers31 have risen sharply from 2006 to 2008. The increases were not related \nto price hikes or poverty incidence, but were due to the interplay of political pressures and the \nuniversal coverage of social cash transfers. The child money program comprised 28% of the \nMSWL budget in 2007, other cash transfers such as the honored mothers\u2019 allowance are being \nconsidered  for  very  large  increases  in  2009,32 and  one  of  the  Government\u2019s  immediate \nresponses to the food crisis was again to increase welfare benefits by 20% in January 2008. \nDespite the increase in mining revenues, which has helped trigger the increases in public \nspending in recent years, the major risk for the sector is the escalation in expenditures and the \nunfavorable creation of an entitlement system that may not be sustainable but will be very \ndifficult to cut in the future. A detailed description of the social welfare sector is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n1.  Issues \n \n17.  Rapid and persistent food price increases raise both immediate and long-term issues. \n \n18.  Increasing  Malnutrition. The increase in food prices creates an immediate risk of \nincreasing malnutrition and worsening food and nutrition indicators in Mongolia. The incidence \nof underweight children, under-5 mortality rates, stunting, wasting, anemia, and rickets are high \nin Mongolia compared with other Asian countries. The recommended daily calorie intake for \nadult Mongolians is 2,604.3 calories but, according to survey data gathered before the spike in \nfood prices, the average calorie intake among poor households is 1,728.3 calories, or only \n63.3%  of  the  recommended  intake.33 Limiting  food  consumption,  the  number  one  coping \nmechanism  cited  by  focus  groups  in  the  poverty  and  social  assessment  (Supplementary \nAppendix G), will directly affect these intake levels. \n \n19.  Increasing  Poverty.  Sustained  high  food  prices  will  have  a  direct  effect  on  poor \nhouseholds  and  will  stress  households  living  just  above  the  poverty  line.  The  urban  poor \nallocate  46%  of  their  expenditure  to  food,  8%  to  heating,  and  3%  to  transport  and \ncommunication, while for the rural poor 58% is spent on food, 3% on heating, and 3% on \n                                                 \n27 Examples of current targets of social assistance are the disabled, the elderly, pregnant women, and lactating \nmothers. \n28 National Statistics Office. 2007. Mongolian Statistical Yearbook. Ulaanbaatar. \n29 Social protection impact is defined in the social protection index as the percentage of expenditure reaching poor \nbeneficiaries. \n30 ADB. 2008. Social Protection Index for Committed Poverty Reduction. Manila (volume 2). \n31 Subsidies for food and oil in response to price hikes also increased; it was almost MNT16 billion in 2007 and is \nlikely to go up further in 2008.  \n32 The allowances for honored mothers provide annual allowances of MNT50,000 for mothers with five or six children \nand MNT100,000 for mothers with more than six children. The Government plans to further increase the honored \nmothers\u2019 allowance to MNT500,000 for mothers with five or six children and MNT1 million for mothers with more \nthan six children, covering 155,000 mothers in 2009. \n33 Nutrition Research Center and UNICEF. 2006. 3rd National Nutrition Survey Report. Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "6   \ntransport and communication (footnote 7). Without direct assistance or access to increased \nincome, poverty levels will rise as households are increasingly unable to meet their basic needs. \n \n20.  Undermining the Millennium Development Goals. In the long term, the impact of \nincreased food prices will undermine poverty reduction gains and make the MDGs relating to \npoverty, child and maternal health, and education more difficult to achieve. Poor households are \nforced  to  increase  their  food  expenditure  at  the  expense  of  nonfood  expenditure  such  as \nmedical care and education. These reductions will ultimately adversely affect the achievement \nof the MDGs and will have a particular impact on women and children.  \n \n21.  Straining Informal Support Networks. A vital network of informal safety nets sustains \nmany Mongolian households. Around 70% receive family remittances, which constitute around \n22% of their consumption,34 making remittances a very important factor in reducing poverty.35 \nThe adverse effects of the devastating dzud in 2000 were somewhat cushioned by this informal \nsafety net. Food price increases are affecting the budgets of both the remitting and the receiving \nhouseholds, which may ultimately weaken this informal support network, consequently reducing \nits impact on poverty.   \n \n22.  Increasing Social Instability. If food prices and the costs of other basic needs such as \nenergy and transport continue to rise, other more drastic coping mechanisms, such as asset \nshedding of livestock in rural areas or spending to cover food and fuel costs in urban areas \ninstead of other basic needs such as education and medicine, may prevail. These responses \nmay result in increased movement of people and/or increased social instability in both rural and \nurban areas.  \n \n23.  Soaring food prices will put additional demand on the social welfare system, which is \nalready facing considerable issues. These include the following: \n \n24.  Lack of Targeting in Current Programs. The lack of proper targeting results in large \ninclusion and exclusion errors in the sector. A significant portion of social assistance goes to the \nnonpoor  (70%  of  all  nonpoor  households  receive  some  form  of  social  assistance),  but  a \nsubstantial portion of the poor are excluded from these programs (40% of the country\u2019s poor do \nnot receive any form of social assistance).36 As a consequence of poor targeting, in the absence \nof social assistance, the incidence of poverty could increase by 10%.37 These errors result in \nhuge expenditures for the Government and exclude a significant portion of poor households \nfrom the needed government assistance.   \n \n25.  Rapid  Increases  in  Public  Expenditure  for  Social  Assistance.  The  current \nuntargeted cash transfers result in high public expenditures, which are still rising. MSWL\u2019s \nbudget has risen from 7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2006, to 10% in 2007, and to \n16% in 2008. The proposed MSWL budget for 2009 will further raise this to 23% of GDP in \n2009.  Two  issues  are  paramount:  (i)  the  fiscal  sustainability  of  current  social  welfare \nexpenditures; and (ii) the resulting entitlements for large numbers of people, which are difficult \nto cut if found to be unsustainable. \n                                                 \n34 National Statistics Office (NSO) of Mongolia. 2004. 2002\u20132003 Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS). \nUlaanbaatar. \n35 Family remittances work both ways; rural households usually send meat to family members in the urban areas, and \nurban households usually send cash and goods to their relatives in rural areas. \n36 The poor might be registered, but due to factors such as deficient targeting, lack of information, lack of skills, or \nlack of money for transportation, they might not be receiving social assistance which in theory they are entitled to. \n37 World Bank. 2006. Mongolia Poverty Assessment. Ulaanbaatar. ", "  7\n \n26.  Creating Additional Benefits. The proposed 2009 budget of MSWL is a 51% increase \nover the 2008 budget due to a huge increase (900%) in the benefit amount for the honored \nmothers\u2019 allowance. In recent elections the Government promised that MNT1.5 million from the \nrevenues of the mining sector would be given out to all Mongolians as a \u201cmotherland benefit\u201d. In \nlight of the current economic and financial situation, the Government might have to consider the \nfeasibility of this benefit. \n \n27.  Absence of Mechanisms for Emergency Response. There is a need for Mongolia to \n(i) constantly strive to ensure food security among its population; and (ii) have early detection, \nmitigation, and response systems in place for food-related emergencies. While promoting food \nsecurity  should  be  a  medium-  to  long-term  priority,  the  need  to  establish  early  warning, \nmitigation, and response mechanisms for food-related emergencies should be an immediate \npriority.   \n \n28.  Lack of Impact Measurement and Inadequate Monitoring and Evaluation. Despite \nthe rapid increase in expenditure and creation of new cash transfers and benefits, due to the \nlack of adequate monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems and efforts at impact measurement, \nthe  Government  has  limited  understanding  of  the  impact  of  the  welfare  programs.  As  a \nconsequence,  there  are  few  mechanisms  (other  than  calculations  on  expenditures  and \ncoverage) to determine if the Government is getting value for money and/or if the assistance is \nmaking a significant impact.  \n \n29.  Limited Access to Social Assistance. The complexities of the civil registration system \nlimit access of poor households to social assistance. Civil registration is free but many migrants \ndo not register because of bureaucratic red tape and limited understanding of the registration \nprocesses involved.38 Lack of money and no permission (to de-register) are among the main \nreasons for not registering. Many migrants do not de-register from their places of origin, thus \ncreating  problems  in  MSWL  records.  Local  administrative  bodies  are  hesitant  to  pursue \nunregistered persons because of the resulting implications on their fiscal budgets and capacity \nto deliver services. As a result, a portion of the population, especially in urban areas, either lose \nthe opportunity to receive Government assistance or are allocated assistance somewhere else. \n \n30.  Decentralized Welfare System with Limited Capacity. Local social welfare delivery \nstructures still need capacity enhancements. Social welfare officers have heavy workloads and \nlimited knowledge of proper social-work practices.39 The soum and khoroo livelihood support \ncouncils (LSCs) were established by law in 2007 to support service delivery and promote \nfairness in beneficiary identification and targeting,40 but little has been done to clarify and \nstrengthen the LSC\u2019s role in the social welfare system.41 Community-based delivery of social \nservices is still an underdeveloped concept in Mongolia, despite SSSDP assistance in this \nspecific area. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n38 NSO, ADB, World Bank. 2006. Participatory Poverty Assessment in Mongolia. Ulaanbaatar. \n39 Less than 20% of local social welfare officers have degrees in social work. \n40 This was previously the responsibility of the office of the soum/khoroo governor. \n41 Issues were raised in the qualitative consultations regarding the selection and objectivity of the council members. \nOn the other hand, many LSCs complain that their recommendations are not being recognized  by higher \nauthorities at the aimag and district level.   \n ", "8   \n2.  Opportunities \n \na.  Government Response  \n \n31.  Establishment of National Council, Price Stabilization Committee, and Program. \nThe Government has organized a price stabilization committee which has undertaken short-\nterm measures including (i) subsidizing reserves for meat and supply of petrol products from the \nRussian Federation, (ii) nullifying import duties of flour and negotiating discounted prices from \nthe Russian Federation for imports of flour, and (iii) conducting regular monitoring of retail prices \nfor certain basic consumer products. Changes in fiscal and trade policies were also introduced \nby the Government\u2019s action plan approved in May 2008.42 Although prices remain high, the \nretail prices for meat, petrol, and flour appear to have stabilized in the third quarter of 2008 as a \nresult of these interventions. \n \n32.  Subprogram  Directed  at  Vulnerable  Populations.  In  May  2008,  the  Government \nstarted to develop a subprogram to directly support vulnerable groups who are most affected by \nthe food price increase.43 ADB has worked closely with the Government to ensure the FNSWPP \nis  in  line  with  this  subprogram.  The  subprogram  has  several  components:  a  food  stamp \nprogram; temporary shelter and hot meals; and systems improvement in social welfare policies, \nstrategies, and evaluation. The Government has proposed a budget amendment to allocate \nMNT1.23 billion to subprogram activities for the remainder of 2008. The Government has also \nestimated that Parliament will need to consider a budget allocation of at least MNT10 billion for \nthe subprogram for 2009.  \n \n33.  National Food Security, Food Safety and Nutrition Program. The Food Security, \nFood  Safety  and  Nutrition  Program  (Food  II  Program44),  under  the  Ministry  of  Food  and \nAgriculture (MOFA), is primarily designed to increase domestic food production. A draft law to \nsupport implementation of this plan has been submitted to the Parliament of Mongolia for \napproval. \n \n34.  Proposed Food Subsidy Law. A draft law proposing food and nutrition subsidies was \nforwarded to Parliament in May 2008. The draft law specifies the use of food stamps and \nproposes to target the poor to deliver food subsidies to the poorest households. The draft law, \nonce  passed,  will  represent  the  legal  umbrella  for  the  subprogram  developed  by  the \nGovernment and the food stamp program developed under the FNSWPP.  \n \nb.  Mongolia\u2019s Increasing Revenues \n \n35.  Special Development Fund. A special development fund has been established in line \nwith the increase in revenue from the mining sector. The long-term prospect of revenue from the \nmining sector and the creation of the special development fund provides potential sources of \nfunding to sustain targeted social welfare programs. \n \n                                                 \n42 This includes tax exemption for oil and food products, subsidizing domestic wheat-producing farms by providing \nfarmers with seeds at discounted price, and subsidizing public transportation.   \n43 The subprogram was developed by a multisector working group led by the director general of the Department of \nEconomic Policy at the Ministry of Finance, with members coming from a wide range of line ministries, civil society, \nand donors. It is a subprogram under the Food Security, Food Safety and Nutrition Program developed under the \nleadership of the Ministry of Agriculture. \n44 This program is also commonly translated as the Second Program on Food Supply, Quality and Safety. \n ", "  9\nc.  Public Response \n \n36.  Public  Opinion  on  Inflation.  In  March  2008,  fear  of  inflation  rapidly  escalated  to \nbecome  the  number  one  problem  identified  by  respondents  in  a  semiannual  randomized \nlongitudinal survey implemented by the Asia Foundation since early 2006. Until March 2008, \nunemployment and corruption had consistently turned out first and second in the list of problems \n(footnote 12). Over 20,000 people took to the streets in April 2008 to protest against price \nincreases and the issue received great attention in the June 2008 general election. No further \nprotests have been reported since the election. The strong public opinion indicates public \nsupport and demand for an immediate and appropriate response from the Government. \n \nd.  Development Agencies Response \n \n37.  A  number  of  development  agencies  are  expressing  interest  in  supporting  the \nGovernment in addressing the food crisis. The World Bank has prepared a policy note on rapid \ninflation and is proposing a program to help improve food security in rural areas, and address \nthe  underlying  causes  of  Mongolia\u2019s  extremely  high  inflation  by  strengthening  macro-\nmanagement and targeting of social assistance. The World Bank proposal presents several \nopportunities for collaboration which are being discussed. The United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP), Food and Agriculture Organization, and other United Nations and bilateral \nagencies are also considering some form of assistance. Several humanitarian nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) are continuing to provide daily feeding programs targeting the homeless \nand the poorest of the poor. The development coordination matrix (Appendix 3) details existing \nand planned support programs.  \n \nC.  Lessons \n \n38.  Key lessons learned have been identified from previous assistance to, and analysis of, \nthe social welfare sector. \n \n39.  Reluctance to Implement Targeted Social Welfare Programs. The combination of \npoor  benefits  targeting  and  exclusion  of  unregistered  residents  from  many  social  welfare \nprograms means that poverty reduction from social protection support has been limited. Recent \namendments  to  the  Social  Welfare  Law  (January  2008)  revised  the  eligibility  criteria  for \nrecipients of benefits but still did not distinguish between beneficiaries with income above and \nbelow the poverty line. Reforms to improve targeting of social welfare programs will be limited \nby public sensitivities, popular expectations, and political demands. Reluctance to undertake \ntargeting  can  also  partly  be  attributed  to  the  lack  of  capacity,  knowledge  on  targeting \nmechanisms, and identification of workable models. The current inflationary environment that \nhas highlighted the clear need to assist the most vulnerable has led stakeholders to take the \nopportunity to create a targeted welfare benefit to address the situation. \n \n40.  Weak Institutional Capacity to Undertake Policy Reforms. The implementation of the \ninvestment loan of the ongoing SSSDP has made satisfactory progress, with achievements in \nthe areas of employment promotion and social insurance, but the policy loan has not. The \nGovernment\u2019s decision to make the child money program universal led to the cancellation of the \nthird tranche of the policy loan. Technical assistance (TA) completion reports45 find that poor \ninterministerial  coordination,  weak  project  management  capacity,  staff  turnover,  and  policy \nvacillation affected project implementation. \n                                                 \n45 ADB. 2008. Mongolia Country Assistance Program Evaluation: From Transition to Takeoff. Manila. \n ", "10   \n \n41.  Mismatch Between Social Welfare and Population Policies. Newly instituted social \nwelfare programs\u2014such as the honored mothers\u2019 allowance, child money, and newborn and \nnewlywed programs\u2014are not primarily geared towards reducing poverty but are in fact tools to \npromote population growth. This might be a legitimate policy objective but it blurs the principle of \ndirecting social welfare assistance to the poor. Focusing social welfare on poverty issues would \nincrease the performance and the impact of the social protection sector.  \n \n42.  Tendency  to  Increase  Social  Welfare  Spending  as  Government  Revenues \nIncrease. There is a tendency in the Government to further expand the social welfare system \nbecause  of  expected  revenue  growth  from  the  mining  sector.  The  high  level  of  social \nexpenditures might be difficult to sustain if revenues from the mining sector drop in the future, or \nif the Government changes its development priorities. At the same time, experience shows that \nit will be difficult to cut social welfare spending once programs are considered by the public as \nentitlements.  One  related  lesson  is  that  there  is  a  lack  of  capacity,  and  to  some  extent \nreluctance, in the Government to measure the impact of social welfare spending. Result-based \nmanagement of social welfare programs should increasingly become the basis for funding these \nprograms. \n \n43.  Direct Food Aid is Costly and Poorly Targeted. Lessons learned from direct food aid \ndistribution  in  Mongolia,  essentially  from  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment and the Government of Japan, point to problems of targeting and prohibitive \ndistribution costs. The city government of Ulaanbaatar included over 60% of the population of \nthe capital in the list of beneficiaries for the recent Indian rice and sugar donation\u2014a good \nexample of poor targeting. Some governments authorize the selling of food donations on the \nmarket and then use the proceeds of the sales to fund social programs. These strategies do not \nalways ensure that the benefits directly reach those most in need. There is a need for innovation \nin food assistance across the country. \n \n44.  Food  Stamps  as  the  Appropriate  Safety  Net. There are safety nets that can be \nconsidered aside from food stamps. Food for work can be applied as a local initiative to \ncomplement a national initiative such as food stamps. Direct or in-kind food distribution has \nproven to be costly and generally suffers from a lack of targeting. Targeted cash transfers can \nbe easier and less costly to implement but there is evidence that the use of food stamps is more \neffective  than  cash  transfers  in  increasing  food  consumption  and  improving  nutrient \navailability.46 It is expected that the use of food stamps could help in modifying the behavior of \nthe general population towards cash-based assistance.47 Hesitation to use cash was repeatedly \nbrought  up  in  stakeholder  consultations  because  of  the  fear  that  cash  could  be  used  to \npurchase alcohol. Alcoholism is a major public health issue in the country and both government \nand community members felt that it was important to target this assistance in such a way that it \nwould not exacerbate any problems. The Government, which tends to resort to unconditional \ncash transfers, favors the use of food stamps as a safety net response to the increasing food \n                                                 \n46 Poor people tend to have higher marginal propensity to consume food as a result of food transfers than equivalent \ncash transfers. US experiences in food stamps indicate that (i) an additional dollar of food stamps increased food \nconsumption by 17%\u201347%, as opposed to 5%\u201313% induced by cash; (ii) the effect on nutrient availability was \nroughly 2\u20137 times larger for food stamps than cash; and (iii) the switch from food stamps to cash transfers triggered \na reduction in food expenditures of between 18% and 28%. Studies done outside the US also indicate the same \ntrend (Gentilini, Ugo. 2007. Cash and Food Transfers: A Primer. Rome: WFP). \n47 Cash-based assistance manifests the following tendencies: (i) it provides an incentive for people to push for the \nbenefit regardless of their poverty situation, (ii) it limits opportunities for implementing systems which use self \nselection, (iii) it could be misused to purchase nonfood items, and (iv) it increases opportunities for misuse of \nfunds. ", "  11\nprices and will be in a position to gain significant lessons for policy formulation and program \ndevelopment related to safety nets and other social welfare benefits. Furthermore, a food stamp \nprogram is flexible and can be shut down and/or reinitiated depending on the need.  \n \n45.  International  Lessons  from  Food  Stamp  Programs.  Many  countries  have \nimplemented food stamps, and the US has the longest-running coupon-based food subsidy \nsystem, which was established in 1964. Food stamps have consistently been found to increase \nfood consumption (more than with cash transfer) but have weak effect in reducing malnutrition. \nMany food stamp programs that have started as a temporary measure to sustain consumption \nof certain vulnerable groups have continued even after the worst effects have passed. Food \nstamps are complex to implement and critical design decisions include (i) determining clear \nprogram objectives and target population, (ii) implementing well-defined beneficiary selection \nprocesses and entrance and exit strategies, and (iii) building the institutional capacity to carry \nout the program. Important implementation considerations are (i) establishing the legal and \nregulatory framework, (ii) preparing a detailed operations guidelines, (iii) preparing a central \nregistry of beneficiaries, (iv) printing stamps on secure paper, (v) ensuring prompt delivery of \nfood stamps and stamp redemption, and (vi) carrying out effective M&E. Electronic transfer \ncards reduce fraud and permit tracking of foods purchased but have higher administrative costs. \nTaking  precautions  to  avoid  adverse  incentives  (black  markets,  fraud,  impact  on  leisure \ndecisions, and migration) are important elements to consider.48 \n \n46.  Rationale for the FNSWPP. Soaring food prices in Mongolia pose a serious threat to \nnutritional welfare and could reverse recent gains in poverty reduction and human development \nin the country. Inflation reduces real incomes and expenditures and has strong social and \npoverty impacts. Higher food prices are not merely short-term phenomena that the market will \nautomatically  correct.  Rising  inflation  has  strong  implications  for  macroeconomic  stability, \npoverty incidence, and inequality. There is ample reason for the Government to intervene in the \nshort-term by establishing targeted subsidy programs to alleviate the impact of inflation on the \npoor. While the needed response is urgent, it presents an opportunity for introducing innovative \nsafety nets that are well-targeted towards the poor. At the same time, there is an opportunity to \nimprove targeting mechanisms; strengthen systems, capacities, and strategies for effective \nsocial welfare service delivery; and establish early detection, mitigation, and rapid response \nmechanisms  for  food  crises  and  similar  emergencies.  The  grant  is  in  direct  support  of \nGovernment  plans  to  provide  targeted  assistance  to  the  poor  and  supports  the  country \npartnership strategy pillar of inclusive social development (in preparation). The design is in line \nwith  the  development  agenda  of  inclusive  economic  growth  in  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic \nframework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)49 and responds directly to the President\u2019s pledge at the \nADB  Annual  Meeting  in  Madrid  to  assist  developing  member  countries  in  addressing  the \nproblem of soaring food prices.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n47.  The impact of the Program is reduced vulnerability to food insecurity through increased \nfood supply and improved access to food by vulnerable and poor households.

Scope \n \n48.  To achieve the outcome, the FNSWPP will comprise a program grant (component 1) and \na capacity development project grant (components 2 and 3).  \n \n49.  In response to the food crisis, the Program will deliver a short-term food safety net in the \nform of food stamps focused on poor households by pilot-testing methodologies for targeting the \npoor, improving existing systems, and building on existing structures. The food stamp program \ncould be shut down or expanded depending on the severity of the food crisis. The project \ncomponents will maximize learning opportunities from pilot testing and program implementation \nto develop and embed within the Government, system capacities and instruments for (i) proper \ntargeting, (ii) measuring and analyzing impacts of the food crisis, (iii) external M&E, and (iv) \ncommunity-based approaches to ensuring household food security.  \n \n50.  Actual implementation of the food stamp program will be used as a reference point for \nproviding inputs to improve social welfare analysis tools and strategies. Technical inputs will be \nprovided  for  applying  lessons  from  food  stamps  implementation  to  other  social  welfare \nprograms. Technical inputs will form the basis for active policy dialogue at the highest level of \nGovernment to promote institutional reforms of the social welfare sector. \n \nC.  The Program Grant \n \n1.  Component  1:  Design  and  Implementation  of  a  Targeted  Food  Stamp \nProgram \n \n51.  Component 1 will pilot the targeting and delivery mechanisms for delivering food stamps \nand test the overall design. The results of the pilot testing will be used to finalize the overall \ndesign (including the targeting and delivery mechanisms) to be used for expanding coverage \nuntil  2011  (or  earlier  if  the  assistance  is  no  longer  needed).  A  total  of  at  least  100,000 \nbeneficiaries (equal to about 4.5% of the population designated as the most poor) will receive a \nmonthly  cash  equivalent  of  $14  as  food  stamps.  This  amount  is  equivalent  to  monthly \nexpenditures on food of the poorest quintile,50 hence doubling their purchasing power on food. \nThe food stamp program will be built on best international practices and lessons learned from \nimplementation of pilot approaches. The outputs of component 1 are:  \n \na.  Output 1: Innovative Targeting Approaches for Food Stamps Pilot-\nTested \n \n52.  Approach 1. From January 2009, the Government will start distributing food stamps as \nan emergency measure to approximately 30,000 disabled and elderly beneficiaries. Approach 1 \nwill identify beneficiaries according to the definition of vulnerable groups as included in the \nsocial welfare laws. \n \n53.  Approach 2. Approach 2 will make use of and update existing MSWL lists of disabled \nand  elderly  beneficiaries  in  selected  pilot  areas.  The  updating  process  will  involve  adding \nbeneficiaries and deleting recipients previously excluded from receiving benefits based on the \n                                                 \n50 National Statistics Office. 2007. Household Expenditures July 2006\u2013July 2007. Ulaanbaatar. ", "  13\nresults of an assessment of their socioeconomic status established through home visits. The \npilot-testing process will be as follows: (i) the social worker updates the list, (ii) university \nstudents  or  NGO  partners  validate  the  list  through  home  visitation  and  assessment  of \nsocioeconomic conditions,51 (iii) the LSC further validates the list, and (iv) food stamps are \nprovided to the persons on the validated list. Approach 2 will be administered in selected \nsample areas in and around Ulaanbaatar to initially reach 20,000 beneficiaries. It is envisaged \nthat approach 2 will be started immediately. The recipients of approach 2 will be different to the \nbeneficiaries selected for the emergency measure of the Government (Approach 1). \n \n54.  Approach 3. Approach 3 will employ innovative52 targeting approaches for identifying \nbeneficiaries. This approach will explicitly conduct outreach and target households in the poor \nareas or outskirts of the cities, identified through a household assessment as among the poorest \nand  eligible  for  the  assistance.53 The  pilot-testing  process  will  be  as  follows:  (i)  sample \ngeographic areas in or around Ulaanbaatar not covered by approach 2 and considered as \n\u201cpockets of poverty\u201d are identified for piloting, (ii) a survey using the household assessment \nform54 is administered in all the households in the target area by contracted university students \nor NGO partners, (iii) the results of the survey are evaluated to determine eligibility, (iv) a list of \neligible households is provided to the local LSC for validation, and (v) those found eligible will be \nprovided with food stamps. Approach 3 will be administered in selected geographic areas with a \nsample size of 10,000 beneficiaries and will expand nationwide incrementally. It is envisaged \nthat approach 3 will start during the first semester of 2009 to give time for the development of \nthe household assessment survey instruments.  \n \n55.  The pilot testing of both approach 2 and approach 3 will be concurrently evaluated by 30 \nJune 2010, after which the household assessment survey instruments will be refined based on \nthe results of the pilot testing. The refined survey instruments and best practices from the \napproaches will be incorporated into the final design to be used for scaling up to 50,000 \nbeneficiaries in 2010 and a further 20,000 beneficiaries in 2011.  \n \nb.  Output 2: A Mechanism for Delivering Food Stamps in Mongolia is \nEstablished \n \n56.  The  mechanism  for  delivering  food  stamps  involves  five  interconnected  stages:  (i) \nbeneficiaries are identified, (ii) food stamps are distributed, (iii) beneficiaries receive the stamps, \n(iv)  shopkeepers55 get  paid  with  stamps,  and  (v)  banks  receive  the  stamps.  In  stage  (i), \nbeneficiaries are identified using the targeting methodologies outlined above (approach 2 or 3 \nduring pilot testing and the refined outreach approach after pilot testing). Targeted beneficiaries \n                                                 \n51 The criteria for the selection of NGOs (and other civil society groups) and identification of appropriate checks and \nbalances will be outlined in the operational guidelines. \n52 The use of the term \u201cinnovative\u201d is justified because the food stamp program represents the first attempt to select \nbeneficiaries of social assistance through the use of a targeting mechanism which seeks to identify the poor and \nincludes independent household assessment (use of civil society groups). \n53 The main basis for eligibility will be the result of the household assessment which will identify poverty and not a \ncategory of vulnerability. Some households already receiving social welfare assistance will still be eligible for the \nfood stamps. This methodology will assist in identifying particularly at-risk households such as households in the \nperi-urban areas headed by women.   \n54 The household assessment form  will be developed using  previous experiences  in Mongolia  with technical \nassistance from an international targeting expert. \n55 The poverty and social assessment identified that wholesale market sellers are an important source of cheap \nfoodstuffs for poor families. Efforts will be made by the Program to include these sellers in the food stamp program. \n ", "14   \nwill sign the terms and conditions for receiving the food stamps.56 The list and information about \nthe beneficiaries will be kept in a central database. A printing company capable of printing on \nsecure paper will be contracted to print the stamps. A contracted institution (bank or post office \npreferably) will be responsible for delivering the stamps to the beneficiaries in stage (ii). When \nbeneficiaries receive the food stamps in stage (iii), they can then buy food from the contracted \nshopkeepers (food sellers) using the stamps. The shopkeepers who receive the stamps in stage \n(iv) will then submit the stamps to the contracted bank. In stage (v), the contracted bank will \nreplace the shopkeeper\u2019s collected food stamps with cash and submit all of the collected stamps \nto the central bank for liquidation.   \n \n57.  The  five  stages  will  be  closely  monitored  during  the  pilot  testing  to  identify  and \nimmediately resolve bottlenecks, issues, and problems in the system. The pilot testing will be \nevaluated together with the targeting approaches, and adjustments will be made in the final \nmechanism to be used for food stamp program expansion. The activities of component 1 are \ndescribed in further detail in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n2.  Important Features \n \n58.  Modeling a Targeting Strategy. The Program will make use of an innovative targeting \nstrategy which will (i) first utilize the existing MSWL lists of beneficiaries that focus on categories \nin the population (e.g., elderly persons and persons with a disability), (ii) update these lists \nthrough validation and verification by a contracted third party (e.g., an NGO), (iii) administer an \nimproved proxy means test to the beneficiaries in the updated list, (iv) validate the LSC, and (v) \ndeliver the food stamps to those identified as poor households based on the results of the proxy \nmeans test. Targeting poor households for the food stamp program is the most important \nfeature of the Program because (i) it provides a major step towards solving the prevailing issues \nin the social welfare sector, and (ii) it will demonstrate to the Government the impact and \neffectiveness of targeting in making significant improvements in the social welfare sector. As \nregistration of nomadic persons is effective in rural Mongolia (soums are the administrative \nanchors for rural households), the systematic household assessment will capture rural herders, \nalbeit  at  a  higher  administrative  cost.  Through  systematic  household  assessments  within \n\u201cpockets of poverty\", the unregistered urban poor will also be captured by the food stamp \nprogram. The operational guidelines for the food stamp program will outline the procedures for \noutreach in greater detail. This strategy will be strongly reinforced through expert inputs to be \nprovided through the Project grant. \n \n59.  Increasing  the  Capacity  of  the  Livelihood  Support  Councils.  The  program, \nespecially during its final stages, will make use of the LSCs in validating beneficiary selection \nand identification, as well as in serving as a venue for raising appeals and grievances related to \nbeneficiary selection. Training and other capacity-development activities will be provided to the \nLSCs. Expert inputs will be provided through the Project as necessary. \n \n60.  Partnering with Civil Society Organizations and the Private Sector. The Program \nrecognizes the potential contributions that civil society organizations and the private sector can \nprovide. It will outsource different functions within the safety net to universities, NGOs, and the \nprivate sector to gain efficiency and augment the capacity of local social workers in areas where \ncivil  society  organizations  have  particular  expertise  and  resources  (e.g.,  targeting  and \n                                                 \n56 The terms and conditions include a provision that the food stamps will be used for food, excluding food items on a \nnegative list (e.g., alcohol and cigarettes). ", "  15\nverification of beneficiary eligibility, actual delivery, monitoring, community mobilization, and \nadvocacy).   \n \n3.  Financing Plan  \n \n61.  The  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $9.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources. The counterpart funds generated from the grant proceeds will be allocated to MSWL \nfor the implementation of the Program. The terms and conditions for the grant will be as set forth \nin  the  draft  Grant  Agreement.  The  Government  has  allocated  MNT80  million  in  its  2008 \namended budget and plans to allocate at least MNT10 billion in the 2009 budget to fund food \nsafety net program-related activities. Indicative program budget requirements for 2010 and 2011 \nhave been discussed with the Government for inclusion in the Government budget for these \nyears. \n \n4.  Program Cost \n \n62.  Program implementation will involve short-term adjustment costs to fund the food stamp \nprogram and this will be financed by counterpart funds. The support needed for the social \nprotection system reform will require incremental costs estimated at $5.0 million equivalent \nrelated to sustained staff development, improved targeting mechanisms, salaries of additional \nsocial work staff at soum and khoroo level, TA for social protection system improvement, \nmanagement information system development, M&E, supervision, and advocacy.  \n \n5.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n63.  Program Management. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency \n(EA) with overall responsibility for the implementation and coordination of activities with other \npartners. A multisectoral Steering Committee composed of senior level officials of (i) MOF; (ii) \nMSWL, with such official serving as the vice chair; (iii) Ministry of Health; (iv) MOFA; (v) National \nStatistics  Office  (NSO);  (vi)  Mongolian  Employers  Federation;  (vii)  Association  of  Elderly \nPersons; (viii) the agencies responsible for the distribution of food stamps; (ix) UNICEF; (x) an \nNGO engaged in food security programs; and (xi) ADB as observer, shall be established and \nshall meet quarterly to provide policy and strategic guidance to the Program. The Steering \nCommittee shall be chaired by the head of the subprogram to the Food II Plan of the Recipient. \nAn English language version of the minutes of Steering Committee meetings shall be forwarded \nto ADB on a quarterly basis.  \n \n64.  MSWL will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for the Program and will be the primary \nresponsible unit for delivering the expected results of the Program. A program implementation \nunit (PIU) with contracted staff will be established within MSWL to facilitate administrative, \nfinancial, and procurement matters, and serve as the secretariat to the Steering Committee. The \nPIU will closely consult with relevant ministries, agencies, and international partners. It will be \nheaded by a qualified program manager selected on a competitive basis. The PIU will comprise \nfour staff, including an administration and finance officer, secretary, and driver for the entire \nimplementation period of the FNSWPP. MSWL will organize a local structure to ensure effective \nfood stamp implementation locally. \n \n65.  The PIU will submit consolidated quarterly progress reports to ADB (in English) and to \nthe Steering Committee and MSWL on all aspects of program implementation. The reports will \ninclude details on overall implementation progress, including summary financial information \n(receipts and disbursements), problems encountered during the reporting period, measures \n ", "16   \ntaken  or  proposed  to  be  taken  to  remedy  these  problems,  and  the  proposed  program  of \nactivities  for  the  following  quarter.  The  reports  will  also  include  an  assessment  of  the \nimplementation  of  the  food  stamp  program,  following  monitoring  indicators  included  in  the \noperations guidelines of the program. A pilot testing completion report will be submitted to ADB \nwithin 1 month of completion of approach 2 and approach 3. Within 3 months of completion of \nthe FNSWPP, the PIU will prepare and submit to ADB, in a format acceptable to ADB, an \nFNSWPP completion report on (i) the utilization and impact of the grants, including a statement \nof expenditures; (ii) performance of the FNSWPP; (iii) economic and social benefits generated; \nand (iv) details about implementation, costs, and other information requested by ADB.  \n \n66.  A food stamp operating unit (FSOU) will be immediately established within the PIU to (i) \ncarefully but rapidly provide the technical requirements of operating a food stamp program; (ii) \naugment  the  capacity  of  the  Government  to  immediately  undertake  setting-up  activities \nnecessary for delivering food stamps, such as ensuring proper targeting of the poor, quality \nprinting  and  reproduction  of  the  stamps,  timely  and  orderly  delivery  of  the  stamps  to  the \nbeneficiaries, and proper contracting with the major operators in the system (post office, banks, \nprinters, and shopkeepers); (iii) provide TA to the MSWL office and LSWO personnel at the \ndistricts and aimags as well as soums and khoroos; (iv) provide troubleshooting assistance in \ncase problems arise in the system; and (v) provide technical support to consultants to be \ndeployed through the Project. The Government has agreed to immediately start the selection \nand hiring process for the national experts who will become part of the FSOU. It is envisaged \nthat the FSOU will be in place before the end of November 2008. \n \n67.  Safeguards to prevent leakage and corrupt behavior surrounding the implementation of \nthe food stamp program will be implemented. The grants will address these issues through \nvarious means: (i) providing detailed implementation guidelines (i.e., food stamp operational \nguidelines); (ii) carrying out capacity-development measures at various levels; (iii) implementing \na communication campaign to inform the public and ensure transparent implementation; (iv) \nsigning  contracts  with  printers,  food  stamp  distributors,  and  shopkeepers,  which  include \nsanctions for misbehavior; (v) strengthening targeting strategies to minimize food stamps being \ndistributed to ineligible beneficiaries; (vi) implementing independent M&E; and (vii) broadening \nthe scope of the audit to include auditing of food stamp program operations. The grants will \nutilize existing effective delivery mechanisms and institutions and will enhance their capacity as \nappropriate. Local governments, particularly at the aimag and soum or khoroo levels, and the \nsoum or khoroo LSCs, will be involved in the preparation and implementation of the food stamp \nprogram. Intersector coordination will be assured by the Steering Committee at the central level. \nImplementation arrangements are discussed in further detail in Appendix 4. \n \n68.  Period  of  Implementation.  The  duration  of  component  1  is  36  months.  It  will  be \ncompleted by 31 December 2011. The grants implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. A \ndetailed implementation schedule is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n69.  Procurement. All procurement to be financed under the Program grant will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). In \naccordance with the simplified disbursement and procurement procedure for program loans, the \ngrant proceeds may be utilized to procure goods and services (excluding local duties and taxes) \nother than (i) those specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 6) produced in and procured \nfrom  ADB  member  countries,  (ii)  those  financed  by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  official \nsources, and (iii) imports from non-ADB member countries. All procurements under the Program \n(component 1) will be made through normal commercial practices for the private sector or the \nGovernment\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures acceptable to ADB, with due consideration ", "  17\ngiven to economy and efficiency. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds \nand verify the accuracy of the Government certification. The procurement plan is attached in \nAppendix 7. \n \n70.  Consulting  Services.  The  FSOU  will  consist  of  seven  national  consultants,  to  be \nheaded  by  a  team  leader  and  to  be  complemented  by  intermittent  assistance  from  an \ninternational targeting specialist (2 person-months). The FSOU will be lodged within the PIU and \nwill establish and coordinate the implementation of the food stamp program. A total of 254 \nperson-months of consulting inputs will be provided by these consultants over 3 years. The \nGovernment will hire the seven national consultants and the international targeting specialist \nbefore starting the Program indicatively from October 2008 to prepare for the implementation of \ncomponent 1 (21 person-months of national and 2 person-months of international consulting \nservices). All of the consultants mentioned will be hired and financed by the Government under \nthe Program. \n \n71.  Counterpart  Funds.  Counterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  short-term \nadjustment costs under component 1. \n \n72.  Monitoring  and  Tranching.  Funding  of  component  1  will  be  released  to  the \nGovernment  in  a  single  payment  of  $9  million  following  grant  effectiveness,  including \nsatisfaction of all policy actions in the policy matrix as confirmed in the development policy letter \n(Appendix 8). \n \n73.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System. The implementation of \nthe food assistance safety nets will be monitored and evaluated by MSWL, with the participation \nof  MOF,  supported  by  independent  external  monitoring  to  be  funded  under  the  Project. \nMonitoring will include operational performance and outcome indicators of the food safety net \nprogram  as  per  the  operational  guidelines,  and  indicators  of  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework. Impact evaluation is conditional on the feasibility of collecting data on the food \nstamp program through the national socioeconomic household survey, the likely sample size, \nand cost considerations. The monitoring of households57 affected by soaring food prices will be \nassessed on a regular basis by government mechanisms and supported by consultants hired \nunder  the  Project.  The  Government  monitoring  capacity  and  systems  (especially  those  of \nMSWL)  will  be  supported  during  implementation  of  the  Program  to  ensure  full  monitoring \ncapacity of the Government after the Program. \n \n74.  Program Review. ADB will conduct review missions jointly with the Government at least \ntwice a year to identify issues and constraints, determine necessary remedial actions and \nadjustments, and advise on actions required to keep the Program on course. The joint review \nmissions will review coordination and collaboration with other ongoing programs related to food \nsecurity and nutrition. To encourage a policy dialogue approach to the review process, the \ncentral government, local governments, and ADB will also conduct a joint midterm review of the \nProgram within 18 months of commencement of Program implementation.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n57 Where relevant, data will be disaggregated by sex, thereby facilitating gender analysis of impacts and supporting \nchanges in program design and implementation. The Gender Action Plan in Appendix 11 outlines indicators to be \ntracked. \n ", "18   \nIV.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT \n \nA.  Component 2: Capacity Development and Communication Strategy \n \n75.  Component 2 will provide the capacity development inputs and communication strategy \nfor  both  the  pilot-testing  and  the  regular  implementation  of  the  food  stamp  program.  The \nfollowing are the outputs of component 2:  \n \n1.  Output 1: Capacity Development Activities Implemented   \n \n76.  The Project will undertake capacity development in two stages: (i) capacity development \nfor the pilot-testing of the food stamp program, and (ii) capacity development for delivering the \nexpanded food stamp program and other social welfare services. The first stage will provide \ntraining to all groups involved in identifying beneficiaries and delivering the food stamps. This \nwill include the validators for the data generated by approach 2, surveyors for approach 3, \nLSCs, shopkeepers, social welfare officers (SWOs) in pilot areas as well as in the aimags and \ndistricts, and key officers in MSWL, LSWO and MOF. The second stage will provide training and \ncapacity development for the LSCs, SWOs, and key officers of MSWL, LSWO and MOF on the \nfinal design and mechanisms of the food stamp program to be used for expansion of coverage. \nOther capacity development topics will include (i) impact studies, baseline data and impact \nmethodologies; (ii) targeting; (iii) M&E; (iv) costing of social welfare reforms and programs; (v) \ncivil registration; and (vi) early warning, mitigation, and response mechanisms. \n \n2.  Output 2: Communication Strategy Developed and Implemented \n \n77.  The  Project  will  identify  and  contract  a  Mongolian  consulting  firm  to  (i)  design  the \ncommunication plan for the Program centered on poor households and vulnerable populations, \nsocial workers, local government,  and national stakeholders; (ii) develop and pilot-test the \ninformation, education, and communication (IEC) materials and media for the communication \nplan; (iii) implement the communication plan in collaboration with the PIU, MSWL, the Steering \nCommittee and MOF; (iv) provide TA to MSWL in the conduct of awareness-raising activities on \nsocial benefits; and (v) make recommendations and undertake measures for institutionalizing \nthe  communication  strategy.  The  communication  strategy  will  target  all  stakeholders  and \npromote public awareness58 about the rationale for the Program, targeting criteria, and agreed \ndelivery mechanisms. Details of this component are described in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nB.  Component 3: Strengthening Social Welfare Strategies and Systems \n \n78.  The following are the outputs of component 3:  \n \n1.  Output 1: Effective Food Crisis Response \n \n79.  Subcomponent 3.1 will provide expert technical analysis of capacity development needs \nto  promote  an  effective  food  crisis  response.  The  areas  for  technical  analyses  are  (i) \nstrengthening  the  decentralized  social  welfare  institutional  structure  under  the  food  stamp \nprogram; (ii) measuring and analyzing impacts of the soaring food prices on the poor; (iii) \n                                                 \n58 The communication strategy will also particularly target women at the community level. The poverty and social \nassessment found that women are primarily responsible for household food budgets and shopping. As the primary \nusers of food stamps, they will be an important audience for education and outreach in the communication \nstrategy. ", "  19\ntargeting  mechanisms  for  food  assistance  benefits  and  other  social  welfare  programs;  (iv) \nexternal M&E of the implementation of the food assistance safety nets; and (v) community-\nbased approaches to ensuring household food security, particularly in the urban sector. For \npoint (v), the Project will make available at least 40 small community grants (of up to $3,000) to \nbe administered by an experienced NGO (reporting to the PIU) to support and develop best \npractices in community-based approaches to ensuring household food security. These grants \nwill target poor households, and particularly women, by supporting the establishment of kitchen \ngardens,  community  greenhouses,  nutritional  education  programs,  and  other  innovative \nhousehold food security measures. Grant eligibility criteria will include community involvement, \ndesign of a sustainability plan, and identification of at least 10% of in-kind contribution. Further \ndetails on the implementation arrangements are in Appendix 4. \n \n2.  Output 2: A Package of Reform of Social Welfare Strategies \n \n80.  Subcomponent 3.2 will provide technical analysis of social welfare strategies and deliver \na set of proposals for (i) policy discussion, (ii) a legislative agenda, and (iii) medium- to long-\nterm  policy  reform.  The  technical  analyses  will  focus  on  (i)  social  welfare  benefits  impact \nanalysis, (ii) effective M&E of social welfare programs, (iii) social welfare expenditure and \nfiduciary and fiscal sustainability analysis of social welfare programs, (iv) facilitating the civil \nregistration  system  through  incentives,  and  (v)  developing  a  knowledge  product  on  social \nwelfare institutional reforms and capacity development. \n \n3.  Output 3: An Early Warning and Response System to Social Shocks  \n \n81.  Subcomponent  3.3  will  provide  technical  analysis  and  support  for  establishing  and \nimproving systems and mechanisms for early detection and mitigation of food and nutrition-\nrelated emergencies and for undertaking rapid responses to the effects and social shocks of \nfood  crises  and  similar  emergencies.  The  subcomponent  will  carry  out  an  inventory  of \nMongolian initiatives on early warning systems, improve existing food and nutrition monitoring \nand surveillance systems, and establish packages and mechanisms (including funding) for \nimmediate responses to similar emergencies (such as dzuds, drought, and national disaster). \nThe activities in this component are described in further detail in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nC.  Important Features \n \n82.  Social Expenditure and Fiscal Sustainability Analysis of Social Welfare Programs. \nThe study and resulting capacity within MSWL and MOF to undertake social expenditure and \nfiscal sustainability analysis is expected to have longer-term policy implications in Mongolia. \nHaving a study and the capacity within the Government to undertake social expenditure and \nfiscal sustainability analysis is expected to inform policy makers on the risks and implications of \nuniversal assistance in relation to Mongolia\u2019s fiscal balance and sustainability. It will also further \nemphasize the need for focusing and targeting any further social welfare assistance. \n \n83.  Early Warning, Mitigation, and Response System for Social Shocks. The need for \nthis  system  is  recognized  by  the  Government  as  a  priority  and  is  acknowledgement  of \nMongolia\u2019s susceptibility to food price shocks. The establishment of an early warning, mitigation, \nand response system is consistent with, and supportive of, the objectives and activities of the \nproposed Food II Program. Close coordination and collaboration will be undertaken with the \nMOFA and all relevant agencies in establishing these systems in order to consolidate and avoid \nduplication of efforts. \n \n ", "20   \n84.  Medium-  to  Long-Term  Institutional  Reform  and  Capacity  Development.  The \nProject  builds  on  the  gains  of  the  ADB-supported  SSSDP  and  takes  advantage  of  the \nexperiences and lessons gained from the targeted food safety program in component 1. It also \nmaximizes the results of the broad range of expert technical inputs from components 2 and 3 by \nconsolidating them into specific proposals for medium- to long-term social welfare institutional \nreforms and capacity development in the social welfare sector for policy discussion with the \nhighest levels of Government. This important feature strongly binds all the FNSWPP inputs, fills \npotential gaps in implementation, and promotes sustainability of FNSWPP impacts. \n \nD.  Project Costs \n \n85.  The total project cost is estimated at $3.33 million equivalent, including physical and \nprice contingencies, taxes, and duties.

Financing Plan \n \n86.  The  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $3.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  representing  90%  of  the  total  Project  cost.  The  Government  will  contribute  the \nequivalent  of  $0.33  million  as  counterpart  funds  for  components  2  and  3.

Project Management. The Project will have the same EA, IA, steering committee, and \nPIU as that of the Program (paras. 63\u201367). The PIU will facilitate all administrative, financial, \nand procurement matters related to the Project. Further details on implementation arrangements \nare described in Appendix 4.  \n \n88.  Period of Implementation. The project duration is 36 months. It will be completed by 31 \nDecember 2011 and closed on 30 June 2012. More details on the time frame are provided in \nthe implementation schedule (Appendix 5) and Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n89.  Procurement. All procurement to be financed under the project grant will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Procurement under the Project will include \none vehicle for the PIU and FSOU. MSWL, in charge of procurement activities of goods and \nconsultant  services,  is  currently  implementing  two  ADB  loans 59  and  has  had  previous \nexperience with several TA and grant projects. Key PIU staff will undergo procurement training \nas needed. \n \n90.  Consulting  Services.  The  Project  will  require  a  total  of  43  person-months  of \ninternational and 76 person-months of national consulting services financed under the project \ngrant, divided into six consultant packages as follows:  \n \n(i)  Package  1:  Communication  strategy;  national  IEC  development  specialist  (4 \nperson-months).  \n(ii)  Package 2: External monitoring; national poverty specialist (3 person-months) \nand national food and nutrition specialist (3 person-months).  \n(iii)  Package 3: Household food security; national community development specialist \n(6 person-months).  \n(iv)  Package 4: Monitoring and evaluation; national economist (5 person-months), \ninternational  poverty  impact  analyst  (3  person-months),  national  food  and \nnutrition  specialist  (2  person-months),  international  qualitative  assessment \nspecialist (2 person-months), international social welfare specialist (3 person-\nmonths), international poverty monitoring and evaluation specialist (3 person-\nmonths),  national  social  welfare  specialist  (6  person-months),  national  social \nresearcher-analyst  (30  person-months),  international  social  sector  monitoring \nand evaluation specialist (2 person-months), national monitoring and evaluation \nspecialist (3 person-months), international food and nutrition specialist (2 person-\nmonths),  international  preparedness  specialist  (1  person-month),  international \ninstitutional capacity building specialist (2 person-months), international safety \nnet specialist (1 person-month), national safety net specialist (2 person-months), \nand international monitoring and evaluation specialist (2 person-months).  \n(v)  Package  5:  Institutional  development;  international  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment specialist (2 person-months), international social welfare and safety \nnets specialist (1 person-months), national social welfare specialist (4 person-\nmonths), international social safety net targeting specialist (12 person-months), \ninternational macro-fiscal policy and public financial management specialist (2 \nperson-months),  national  macro-fiscal  policy  and  public  finance  management \nspecialist  (2  person-months),  international  civil  registration  expert  (1  person-\n                                                 \n59 Loan  1836-MON:  Social  Security  Development  Project  and  Loan  1837-MON:  Social  Security  Development \nProgram. \n ", "22   \nmonths), national civil registration expert (2 person-months), international social \nwelfare specialist (2 person-months), national social welfare specialist (4 person-\nmonths), and  international development communication specialist (2 person-\nmonths).  \n(vi)  Package 6: National household survey data collection and management. \n \n91.  The Government requested advance contracting for the recruitment of consultants. The \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The entities for packages 1, 2, and 3 will be \nhired through consultant qualification selection using biodata proposal. Quality- and cost-based \nselection procedure using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 will be applied for the recruitment of the \nentities for packages 4 and 5. The NSO is the only national organization in Mongolia with the \nnecessary competence to meet the requirements under package 6, and it will be hired through \nsingle source selection. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n \n92.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the Government and MOF. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to the FNSWPP. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of the Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  grant  regulations  and  bidding  documents  for  the  FNSWPP.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MSWL and MOF \nand all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the \nFNSWPP. \n \n93.  In Transparency International\u2019s 2007 corruption perception index, Mongolia ranks 100th \n(93rd in 2006), which is typical of countries with high levels of corruption. However, efforts to \npromote governance and accountability and to combat corruption are accelerating in Mongolia. \nThe Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) was set up in 2006, and commenced \ninvestigations upon ratification of the Criminal Procedures Code Amendments in August 2007. \nThe  Anti-Corruption  Law  guarantees  the  independence  and  authority  of  the  IAAC  and \ninvestigations of senior, mid-ranking and junior officials have led to convictions. A sector risk \nassessment under the Governance and Anti-Corruption Program II guidelines was recently \ncarried out for Mongolia by the Asia Foundation for national systems as well as the education \nand urban transport sectors in the areas of public finance management, procurement, and \nanticorruption. Regarding public finance management and procurement systems, the report \nidentifies weaknesses, particularly in internal control and all stages of the procurement process, \nfor both the national systems and in the two sectors and relevant line ministries. ADB will assist \nin putting mitigation measures in place to improve internal control and the procurement process. \nThe World Bank is introducing program-based medium-term budgeting, and the International \nMonetary Fund is considering assistance for legal and budgetary reforms. \n \n94.  Disbursement Arrangements. The project grant will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite \nproject implementation through timely release of grant proceeds, the Government will establish \nan imprest account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, which will be administered by \nMSWL. Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal \napplication and related documentation. Such documentation will demonstrate, among other \nthings, that the goods and/or services are (i) procured from ADB member countries, and (ii) ", "  23\neligible for ADB financing. The initial and maximum amount to be deposited in the imprest \naccount will not exceed 10% of the Project grant amount or equivalent of 6 months\u2019 estimated \nexpenditure, whichever is lower. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure may be used to \nreimburse, liquidate, or replenish eligible expenditures that do not exceed $50,000 per individual \npayment. \n \n95.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  Government,  through  the  PIU,  will  (i) \nmaintain separate financial accounts for the Project, and (ii) have such accounts and related \nfinancial statements audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB in accordance \nwith the provisions of the Grant Agreement and as specified in ADB\u2019s financial reporting and \nauditing  standards.60 The  auditors  should  have  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of \nreference acceptable to ADB. The use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures \nwill also be part of the annual audit and a separate audit opinion will be submitted. The \nGovernment will submit to ADB certified copies (in English) of such audited accounts and \nfinancial statements, as well as the related reports of the auditors, within 6 months after the \nclose of each fiscal year. The Government was advised that ADB requires timely submission of \naudited projects accounts and financial statements and that it will suspend disbursements of the \nproposed ADB grant in case of noncompliance with the requirement. \n \n96.  For the purpose of complying with the requirements for the annual audited financial \nstatements, the proceeds of this grant may be used to finance expenditures for preparation of \nfinancial statements, sector auditors, and translations of auditor\u2019s reports into English.  \n \n97.  Project Performance Monitoring System. The PIU will monitor the Project along the \nprogram performance monitoring and evaluation system described in para. 73. Performance \nindicators are set out in the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n98.  Project Review. Reviews as described in para. 74 will also cover Project activities. \n \nV.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n99.  Targeted  Safety  Net. The FNSWPP will provide assistance to the Government for \ndelivering targeted safety nets to the poor and vulnerable when the need is most urgent and the \nGovernment is still struggling to determine who and where these most needy populations are. \nThe short-term, well-coordinated, and targeted safety net program (i.e., focused on mitigating \nthe impacts of food prices and identifying vulnerable households) will provide direct support to \nthe most needy at a substantially lower cost than the usual broad-based actions undertaken by \nthe Government. The quick disbursing nature of the Program will ensure that the assistance will \nbe provided in a timely manner to the targeted beneficiaries. \n \n100.  Greater Social Impact and Fiscal Sustainability of Social Safety Nets and Welfare \nAssistance. The FNSWPP responds to soaring food prices by delivering a safety net program \nthat builds on existing structures, resources, and capacity, then uses the FNSWPP to learn and \nultimately integrate good practices into the existing social welfare system. In doing so, the \ngrants will have short-term direct impacts on poor and vulnerable populations, a long-term \nindirect impact on social policy and the social welfare system, and direct impacts on the overall \npopulation. \n                                                 \n60 ADB. 1989. Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank. Manila. \n ", "24   \n \n101.  Harmonization of Development Efforts. The FNSWPP\u2019s deliberate effort to harmonize \nits interventions with other international efforts (e.g., those of UNDP and the World Bank), the \nGovernment\u2019s broader plans and programs (e.g., the Food II Program), and other international \norganizations\u2019  projects  and  activities  (e.g.,  UNICEF\u2019s  Nutrition  Monitoring  System),  directly \nbenefit the Government in terms of savings from preventing duplication of efforts and ensuring \nefficiency of programs related to food security. \n \n102.  Improved Local Capacity. The FNSWPP\u2019s emphasis on improving capacities of local \ngovernments  and  LSCs  to  deliver  targeted  safety  nets  and  social  welfare  assistance \ndistinguishes it from most national programs that have laudable objectives but fail to consider \nlimitations and/or absorptive and carrying capacities of the local bodies. This emphasis directly \nbenefits local social workers, LSCs, governors, and local leaders with better skills and improved \nresources, which will immediately benefit poor and vulnerable populations in terms of effective \nand timely assistance. \n \n103.  Civil  Society  Participation.  The  FNSWPP  recognizes  civil  society\u2019s  potential \ncontributions  to  it.  Deliberate  efforts  to  mobilize  civil  society  participation  in  appropriate \ncomponents (i) promotes increased program efficiency, (ii) directly benefits local government \nbodies in terms of additional resources, and (iii) benefits the vulnerable populations in terms of \nstronger voice and advocacy for more equitable assistance from the Government. \n \nB.  Impacts \n \n104.  Poverty Reduction and Social Impact. The Program will protect at least 100,000 poor \nand vulnerable households from the risk of malnutrition and from sliding deeper into poverty by \nproviding a targeted safety net using food stamps. In the longer term the Program will contribute \nto  mitigating  the  impact  of  the  food  price  increases  and  reaching  nonincome  MDGs. \nTransparent and more effective systems and capacities will reduce opportunities for corruption. \nIncreased knowledge on rights and benefits among poor and unregistered people and improved \ncivil registration will promote the rights of migrants and unregistered populations, and contribute \nto poverty reduction and reducing social problems in urban areas. The training and awareness-\nraising activities of the community grants program that accompanies the safety nets will improve \nknowledge and practices in proper nutrition and promote household food security and self-\nsufficiency among poor and vulnerable populations. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy  is  in  Appendix  10,  and  the  poverty  and  social  assessment  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n \n105.  Gender Impact. Because women are the most likely users of the food stamps,61 they \nwill (i) increase their ability to balance the household budget and provide adequate nutritional \nintake for their families, (ii) gain increased awareness on benefits and rights through appropriate \nIEC  materials  and  strategies,  (iii) participate  in  household  economic  activities,  and  (iv)  be \ninvolved in community concerns and activities. Community-based activities that promote food \nsecurity (e.g., kitchen gardens, small vegetable farming, and nutritional meals training) will \ninvolve parents, especially mothers, in (i) identifying and prioritizing their needs, (ii) planning \ncommunity projects that respond to their needs, (iii) participating in training activities related to \nthese projects, and (iv) implementing these activities together with their peers. A gender action \nplan has been prepared for the Project with the intention of maximizing opportunities for gender \n                                                 \n61 This was confirmed by the rapid qualitative assessments during consultation. Women are generally the ones \nclaiming and budgeting benefits received from the Government. ", "  25\nimpact in design and implementation and providing adequate data for M&E of the FNSWPP. \nThe gender action plan is in Appendix 11. \n \n106.  Institutional  Impact.  Government institutions, particularly MSWL, the provincial and \ndistrict  soum  and  khoroo  governors,  local  social  workers,  and  LSCs  will  gain  increased \ncapacities for (i) delivering services; (ii) generating and analyzing data in aid of policy and \nprogram  development;  and  (iii)  establishing  packages  and  mechanisms  for  anticipating, \nmitigating, and responding to food crises and similar situations. The FNSWPP will also promote \n(i) better ways of identifying and targeting beneficiaries, which is a crucial factor in ensuring \nprogram effectiveness and efficiency; (ii) more accurate and reliable data through improved data \nmanagement, analysis, and evaluation; (iii) improved M&E, which feeds back into more effective \nprogram planning; (iv) stronger participation of the community, local government, and LSCs; \nand  (v)  more  effective  coordination  and  communication  strategies  among  stakeholders. \nGovernment  ministries  will  be  better  equipped  with  analytical  tools  and  methodologies  to \ndevelop and implement more focused and responsive policies and programs. Civil society \norganizations will play a more active role in delivering social welfare services. Established early \ndetection, mitigation, and response mechanisms and packages improve the preparedness of \ngovernment  agencies  for  rapid  deployment  in  the  event  of  another  food  crisis  or  similar \nemergency. \n \n107.  Economic and Financial Impacts. The FNSWPP will improve food security for at least \n100,000 households, preventing them from sliding deeper into poverty. In order to assess the \neconomic viability and efficiency of the investment under the Project, economic benefits and \ncosts  were  identified  and  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  over  20  years  was \nestimated.  \n \n108.  The quantified economic benefits are cost savings consisting of reduction in out-of-\npocket household expenses resulting from avoided health costs. These may occur, based on \nthe assumption that poor households are more vulnerable to illness than nonpoor because of \ntheir poor living conditions. The analysis does not attempt to quantify all economic gains and \nonly provides conservative estimates based on benefit streams that can be quantified.  \n \n109.  Economic costs were calculated based on the annual program cost disbursements and \nincremental recurrent costs. It is assumed that for each MNT1.0 spent on investment, an \nadditional MNT0.10 per year is spent on maintenance and operation of the new health facilities. \nThe cost of administration of the FNSWPP\u2014including MSWL's cost of administering the grant, \nthe cost of consultants, and M&E of the grants\u2014are also included as components of the \nrecurrent cost. The estimated total economic cost of the FNSWPP at constant 2008 prices is \n$18.4 million for 20 years, including both capital and incremental recurrent costs. Financial costs \nare converted into economic values based on a standard conversion factor, using domestic \nprice numeraire in all program economic cost conversions. \n \n110.  The FNSWPP yields an EIRR of 16.9% and a net present value of MNT11.7 billion. The \nnet present value calculation discounts the cost and benefit streams at 12% in real terms. The \nactual EIRR is likely to be somewhat higher, reflecting positive externalities and longer-term \nintergenerational social benefits that come with improved targeting of social protection services. \nThese benefits may be reflected in education outcomes and quality of life, to which it is difficult \nto assign monetary values. \n \n111.  The main investment of the FNSWPP, the food stamp program, is expected to have a \ncost of $9.0 million from ADB resources in 2009, which is equivalent to 0.17% of Government \n ", "26   \nexpenditure in 2009. The cost of the program will be financed by ADB, with the Government \nproviding matching expenditure of about $10 million in 2009 to cover the 100,000 beneficiaries \nduring the Program period. The fiscal burden generated by the new FNSWPP is around 0.32% \nof Government expenditure. The investment plan for the Project is about 0.06% of the annual \nbudget of the social protection sector, while FNSWPP recurrent costs are about 0.06% of the \n2009  budget  of  MSWL,  decreasing  to  0.01%  in  2011.  The  Government  is  committed  to \nassuming all recurrent costs generated by the FNSWPP. The economic and financial analysis is \nin Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n112.  Sustainability  Impact.  The  FNSWPP  has  built-in  features  to  ensure  sustainability, \nnamely (i) its support to the Government\u2019s subprogram that is a major component of the second \nNational Plan for Food II Program helps promote longer-term food security and nutrition among \nthe poor and vulnerable populations; (ii) improved MSWL capacity in targeting and delivering \nsafety nets helps guarantee sustained social protection for poor households; (iii) strengthened \ncommunity-based  approaches  for  promoting  household  food  security  (e.g.,  community \nvegetable gardens) provides better access of poor households to food in the medium term; (iv) \nincreased awareness among the public on their rights and the benefits offered by MSWL; and \n(v)  continuous  policy  discussion  with  the  highest  levels  of  government  on  social  welfare \ninstitutional  reforms  and  capacity  development  ensures  that  all  institutional  reforms  are \nsustained  and  that  capacities  gained  are  embedded  within  the  government  system,  thus \nensuring sustainability of impact.   \n \nC.  Social Safeguards \n \n113.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The FNSWPP is designed to initiate a response \nto the soaring food prices through the food stamp program. Therefore, it will not trigger any \nresettlement issues. \n \n114.  Ethnic Minority Issues. The FNSWPP will implement a national food stamp program \ntargeting the poorest and most vulnerable. The poverty and social assessment has confirmed \nthat no negative impacts on indigenous peoples will occur.  \n \nD.  Environmental Aspect \n  \n115.  The FNSWPP is classified as category C, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002). The short-term food subsidy offered to the vulnerable segment of the population will \nincrease demand for the subsidized items that will be met by increased domestic production, \ngreater imports, higher prices faced by the nonsubsidized population in case of inelastic supply \nresponse, or some combination of these effects. The environmental impact of the adjustment \nwill then be that of an estimated increase in domestic production, food imports, and price \nincreases  faced  by  the  nonsubsidized  segment  of  the  Mongolian  population.  The  (most \nrelevant) first category (environmental impacts of greater domestic production attributable to the \ngrant) will be small and the dominant indirect impacts of the grant will be the positive impacts on \nthe vulnerable group\u2019s physical and mental health. These positive impacts will comfortably \noutweigh any possible negative indirect environmental impacts, such as those briefly analyzed \nabove. There is no need to conduct either an initial environmental examination or a strategic \nenvironmental  assessment  for  the  proposed  FNSWPP.  The  environmental  assessment  is \nattached in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n ", "  27\nE.  Risks \n \n116.  Political  Risks.  Government ministries are concerned that the plans and programs \ndeveloped to respond to increasing food prices will have to go through another process of \nreview and scrutiny by the new Government, thus causing delays to program implementation. \nPotential restructuring and changes in leadership of some ministries are also causing concern \namong  those  government  officials  involved  in  developing  this  Program.  The  risks  of  new \ngovernment officials not fully understanding the Program will be mitigated through constant \ndialogue and consultations between ADB and its partners in the Government. The Minister of \nFinance and Minister of Social Welfare and Labor have been informed about the preparation of \nthe assistance. Government officials directly involved in the preparation of the FNSWPP are still \nin place and are expected to remain. The draft law supporting the Program has been submitted \nto the Parliament during the last session of 2008. \n \n117.  Governance and Bureaucratic Risks. Implementation of food safety nets requires a \nhigh degree of accuracy and synchronization of efforts and activities and is prone to corruption. \nThere is a risk that weak horizontal and vertical coordination will affect program efficiency. This \nwill be especially true if changes occur in senior leadership among implementing ministries. To \nmanage  this  risk,  the  FSOU  will  be  immediately  established  to  ensure  that  technical \nrequirements of the Program are given full attention by the Government. Furthermore, senior \nofficials of all implementing ministries will be invited to an organizational meeting of the Steering \nCommittee once the restructuring and changes within the ministries are finalized. Frequent \nSteering Committee meetings and consultations (at least twice a month) will be undertaken by \nthe  EA,  especially  at  Program  start-up,  to  continuously  monitor  progress  and  immediately \nresolve issues related to the Program. The PIU and FSOU will ensure continuous coordination \nwith MOF, MSWL, and other stakeholders. Governance risks will be addressed through the \nprovision of clear operational guidelines, a communication strategy to make the food stamp \nprogram transparent, and external monitoring and other activities described in para. 67. \n \n118.  Resistance to Change. There is also a risk of national and local stakeholders resisting \nchanges to be introduced by the FNSWPP to (i) improve systems of targeting and service \ndelivery,  (ii)  shift  to  better  instruments  and  strategies  for  policy  analysis  and  program \ndevelopment  and  management,  and  (iii)  introduce  or  harmonize  mitigation  and  response \nmechanisms to food crises and similar emergencies. To help manage this risk, the Project \nincludes  a  subcomponent  that  will  develop  and  implement  a  communication  strategy  to \ndisseminate complete and accurate information about the Program, its specific components, \nand its intended outcomes. Participation of all stakeholders (national and local) in all program \nprocesses  will  also  help  to  develop  a  sense  of  ownership  of,  and  collaboration  with,  the \nFNSWPP, in addition to developing intense policy dialogue at the central level.   \n \n119.  Capacity Constraints. The FNSWPP was designed with consideration given to the \nlimitations  and  constraints  in  capacities  of  local  and  national  partners.  Thus,  capacity \ndevelopment and augmentation inputs are built into the design. A major concern is the limited \nstaffing capacity at the soum and khoroo levels, where actual delivery of safety net assistance \nwill happen. This limited capacity will be augmented by (i) providing in-depth training to the \nsoum and khoroo SWO on the Program, (ii) training and mobilizing NGO implementing partners \nto implement the Program in collaboration with the soum and khoroo SWO, and (iii) training and \nactivating the soum and khoroo LSCs to support Program implementation and take the lead in \nverifying and validating eligibility of target beneficiaries. Components 2 and 3 of the Project were \ndesigned to provide expert assistance during implementation, while at the same time delivering \n ", "28   \ncapacity development inputs such as systems of social welfare service delivery and policy and \nprogram development. \n \n120.  Pilot-Testing Risks. Experience with government ministries in Mongolia has highlighted \na risk in pilot-testing. This is because beneficiary groups tend to expect a pilot program element \nto immediately become a regular practice or entitlement from the Government, thus making later \nprogram  adjustments  difficult.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  partnering  with  civil  society \norganizations to (i) allow adjustments in program design as a result of pilot-testing, (ii) augment \nthe limited implementation capacity of the soum and khoroo SWOs, and (iii) enable the program \nto be rapidly scaled up. The other aspect of this risk is that the pilot will remain just a pilot, even \nif the results are good and recommendations appropriate. To lower this risk, specific proposals \nand  continuous  policy  dialogue  with  the  highest  levels  of  Government  on  social  welfare \ninstitutional reforms and capacity development will facilitate the adoption of pilot-testing results \ninto regular social safety net planning and implementation by the Government. \n \n121.  Risks from Rapid Design. The FNSWPP was designed in an accelerated way\u2014trying \nto make a response to an emergency in a rapidly changing economic and political environment. \nDespite the quick design, the FNSWPP has (i) undertaken and proposed continuous policy \ndialogue with the highest levels of Government to ensure common understanding and actions \non needed policy reforms, (ii) included pilot-testing to ensure effectiveness of the design, (iii) \nbuilt on existing institutions and systems, (iv) integrated Government ideas, and (v) designed for \nstrong technical and administrative leadership and strong technical assistance with components \nthat build on each other to support short- and long-term initiatives. \n \nF.  Assumptions \n \n122.  Reaching impact targets assumes that international food prices will stabilize in the near \nfuture and that food imports to Mongolia are not hindered. The attainment of outcome targets \nalso assumes that international food prices will stabilize and that there is sufficient political and \nadministrative  stability  to  properly  implement  the  FNSWPP  and  the  ensuing  social  welfare \nreforms. \n \nVI.

General Background \n \n1.  In Mongolia, the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor (MSWL) is responsible for social \nwelfare,  social  insurance,  and  employment  issues  at  the  central  level.  There  are  two \nimplementing agencies under MSWL, the State Social Insurance General Office (SSIGO), and \nthe Labor and Social Welfare Office (LSWO). These agencies have representatives responsible \nfor delivering services at the local level. Governors of all local governments1 are obliged by law \nto  undertake  area-specific  social  protection  activities.  MSWL  is  responsible  for  developing \nnational policies on women, children, youth, the disabled, and the elderly. The percentage of the \npopulation receiving social welfare benefits (excluding those receiving social insurance and \nemployment services) was about 6% of the total population in 2004.2 \n \n2.  The LSWO is responsible for delivering social welfare assistance and services and \nemployment promotion. The types of social welfare assistance being provided through the \nLSWO include: (i) in-kind services, including residential facilities for the elderly and the disabled \nand services for the poor, homeless persons and children; (ii) discounts and subsidies for the \nelderly, the disabled, and other groups to reduce the costs of housing and health care; and  \n(iii) short-term cash benefits for pregnancy and delivery, child care, families with many children, \nadoption of orphans, infant care, and long-term pensions for those not eligible for SSIGO \nassistance.   \n \n3.  Mongolia  has  an  above  average  social  protection  index  (SPI)3 which  reflects  the \nexistence  of  a  comprehensive  social  insurance  and  assistance  system.  However,  poverty \ntargeting received the lowest rating among the four social protection indicators (expenditure, \ncoverage, poverty targeting, and social protection impact4) and the SPI gives Mongolia a \u201cbest \nestimate\u201d overall poverty targeting rate of only 60%.   \n \n4.  The lack of proper targeting methodologies results in large inclusion and exclusion errors \nand increasing expenditures. About 70% of all nonpoor households receive some form of social \nassistance, but 40% of the country\u2019s poor do not receive any form of social assistance. This is \npartly  due  to  the  broad  official  definitions  of  vulnerability;  there  are  23  defined  groups  of \nbeneficiaries, including all children under 16, elderly people, mothers with newborns, single \nparents, and unemployed people, irrespective of their socioeconomic status.5  \n \nB.  Legal Framework \n \n5.  The Government Law in 1993 established the MSWL and the 1995 Social Welfare Law \nestablished the legal basis for the current social welfare system. Amendments to the Social \nWelfare Law in 1997 and 1998 created the management and organization of an independent \nsocial welfare system. Further amendments and revisions to the Social Welfare Law provided \nthe legal basis for the current package of social assistance including: the Law on the Social \nWelfare for Elderly Persons; the Law on the Social Security for Persons with Disabilities; and \nthe Law on the Allowances to Mothers and Children and Monetary Assistance to Mothers, \nChildren and New Families and Couples. These laws define the current types and coverage of \n                                                 \n1 Governors sign annual performance contracts with the minister of MSWL. \n2 National Statistics Office. 2007.

An important aspect of the Social Welfare Law is that the eligibility requirements do not \ndistinguish between the poor and those with incomes above the poverty line. The amendments \nenacted in January 2008 revised the eligibility requirements for beneficiaries of welfare benefits, \nbut these did not include poverty criteria and thus did not address the need to target the poor \n(footnote 5). \n \nC.  Sector Strategy  \n \n7.  The  Government  adopted  a  social  security  sector  strategy  paper6 in  2003  as  the \nframework for the long-term development of the sector.7 The strategy paper spelled out three \nlong-term policy reforms for social welfare: (i) adjust centralized public social welfare services to \nmove toward a comprehensive social welfare system that is community-based and supports \nhouseholds\u2019 development, (ii) rationalize the scope for social welfare services and improve their \ncost-efficiency, and (iii) introduce services that provide care in a family environment. Among the \nstrategies identified are: transform cash-based benefits into multifunctional services based on a \nhousehold\u2019s or an individual\u2019s initiative and choice, improve the quality and accessibility of social \nwelfare services, improve the management of and methodologies in social welfare services, and \nreform residential care institutions in accordance with community-based approaches.    \n \nD.  Coverage of Beneficiaries and Expenditures \n \n8.  Beneficiary coverage and expenditure on social welfare benefits have expanded rapidly \nover the past few years and they are expected to increase even more in the near future. \nCoverage of social welfare benefits increased by 7.6 times from 2004 to 2007. The number of \nbeneficiaries receiving conditional cash benefits increased by 3.6 times from 2006 to 2007. \nPregnant or lactating mothers received more than 80% of the cash benefits in both years. Large \nincreases are being considered for other cash transfers in the coming year, such as the honored \nmothers\u2019 allowance.8 However, these benefits are not necessarily pro-poor in their objectives. \n \n9.  The total budget of MSWL has been 7% to 16% of gross domestic product (GDP) during \nthe last 3 years, and is estimated at MNT1.397 billion in 2009. A 51% budget increase is \nplanned  for  2009,  mainly  arising  from  the  substantial  increase  in  the  honored  mothers\u2019 \nallowance. The social protection budget consists of five major programs, with social welfare \ncomprising 32% of the budget. Higher anticipated revenues from the mining sector may lead to \na further expansion in social welfare.  \n \n                                                 \n6   The social security sector strategy paper was developed in 2001 with technical and financial assistance from ADB. \n7   Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor. 2003.

September 2008. \n \n10.  Taken together, the child money program and the honored mothers\u2019 allowance comprise \n68% of the proposed 2009 budget for social welfare. As a percentage of GDP, the overall \nMSWL budget will also significantly increase from 7% in 2006 to 23% in 2009. \n \n11.  One of the Government\u2019s immediate responses to the food crisis was to increase welfare \nbenefits by 20% in January 2008. Despite the increase in mining revenues, the major risk for the \nsector is that this escalation in expenditures and a universal entitlement system may not be \nsustainable but will be very difficult to cut in the future.  \n \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \nE.  Recent ADB Assistance \n \n12.  In 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a loan to support the Social \nSecurity Sector Development Project (SSSDP)9 to initiate reforms in social welfare, insurance, \nand  employment  services.  The  SSSDP  was  a  response  to  emerging  needs  in  Mongolia\u2019s \ntransition to a free market economy. It was envisaged that its social welfare component would: \n(i)  develop  and  upgrade  social  welfare  service  facilities  for  the  elderly  and  the  disabled,  \n(ii) develop community-based social welfare services, and (iii) strengthen the social welfare \nmanagement  capacity.  The  SSSDP  has  been  implemented  since  February  2002  and  was \npartially completed in 2008. One of the main goals of ADB\u2019s program of support\u2014to refocus \neligibility criteria for social welfare benefits on the poorest groups\u2014was not met for the child \nmoney  program,  despite  agreement  between  ADB  and  the  Government  on  the  program \npolicies,  advisory  technical  assistance,  and  special  study  support.  After  the  Government \ndecided to broaden social welfare eligibility in 2006 and universalized the child money program, \nthe third SSSDP tranche was cancelled. \n \nF.  Experience with Targeting \n \n13.  In 2005, the Government introduced the child money program,10 which was the first \nsocial welfare allowance to use a proxy means test11 to target poor households. However, in \nMay 2006, in response to political pressure and access to new revenue, Parliament enacted a \nlaw which made \u201cchild money\u201d a universal entitlement to which all children below 18 would be \neligible. Immediately, the number of social welfare beneficiaries soared from less than 160,000 \nin 2004 to more than 1 million (40% of the population) in 2006. ADB has expressed concern that \nall 23 types of current social welfare assistance use population categories rather than poverty \nas the basis for eligibility. More than 80% of social welfare beneficiaries since 2005 are those \nreceiving \u201cchild money\u201d (footnote 3).  \n \nG.  Human Resources and Capacity \n \n14.  Public service agencies employ 1,200 social workers, 798 of whom work for social \nwelfare agencies, with 510 of these employed at the lowest administrative level of the soum or \nkhoroo. Soums and khoroos with large populations recruit social worker assistants to help with \nthe workload. The rest are employed by schools (624), law enforcement agencies, or hospitals. \nAbout 20% have a social work degree. Recently, social welfare officers12 have been recruited to \nsupport social workers in areas with large populations. Since 1997, a system of training and \naccreditation for BA and MA degrees has been developed. Livelihood support councils (LSCs) \nhave been created to facilitate social welfare outreach and assist in ensuring identification and \nvalidation of needy recipients. Each LSC has seven part-time and unpaid staff (one social \nworker, two representatives of nongovernment organizations, two representatives of citizens, \nand two representatives of government organizations).  Although the councils are in place, there \nare few guidelines or resources for staff and little training. Analyzing and strengthening this \ndecentralized social welfare system is therefore one of the most important contributions that the \n                                                 \n9    ADB. 2001.

Challenges and Opportunities for the Social Welfare Sector to Address the Food \nCrisis  \n \n15.  Over the past year, food grain prices have soared to unprecedented heights all over the \nworld. International rice prices increased by 196% and wheat prices rose by 72% between May \n2007 and May 2008.13 The inflation rate in Mongolia reached 33% in May 2008, much higher \nthan in most other Asian countries.14 Food prices accounted for more than two-thirds of inflation, \nwith the prices of wheat and meat products contributing nearly half of the inflation15 and oil \nprices contributing a small but growing proportion.  \n \n16.  The spike in food prices threatens to push large numbers of people below the poverty \nline16 and to increase the incidence of malnutrition in Mongolia. Poor households are forced to \nincrease their food expenditure at the expense of nonfood expenditure, such as on medical care \nand education. Informal safety nets among Mongolians, through remittances between family \nmembers, which constitute around 22% of household consumption,17 are being stressed as a \nresult. The poverty and social assessment (Supplementary Appendix G) found that coping \nmechanisms such as reducing the quantity and quality of food, and postponing or eliminating \nexpenditures for energy, transport, health and education are already being used. The poor are \nhardest hit by overall inflation and especially by the food price increases.  \n \n17.  The emergence of the food crisis highlights several challenges and opportunities for the \nsocial welfare sector. These include: addressing inadequate systems for delivering assistance \ntargeted  at  the  poor,  defining  social  welfare  strategies  and  enhancing  capacities,  and \naddressing the absence of emergency response mechanisms.   \n \n(i)  A failure to initiate targeting systems to identify the poor within the social welfare \nsystem leaves MSWL with few tools to address the situation quickly and to direct \nassistance to those most in need. However, the emergence of this crisis has also \ncreated a consensus among government stakeholders that any effort to mitigate \nthe immediate impacts of the food price increases on the poor will need clear \ntargeting mechanisms if it is to make a difference for beneficiaries and to be \nfiscally sustainable. The food stamp program provides a clear opportunity for \ntargeting a needed benefit directly at the poor and for making a significant impact \non their capacity to maintain household nutritional status. \n \n(ii)  Social assistance programs are poorly aligned with fiscal sustainability goals. \nThe  current  system  of  untargeted  cash  transfers  results  in  very  high  public \n                                                 \n13 The price of rice in the international market rose by 196% (from $325/ton in May 2007 to $963/ton in May 2008). \nWheat prices in the international market rose by 72% (from $203/ton in May 2007 to $349/ton in May 2008). Food \nand Agriculture Organization (FAO) database, 2008. \n14 Inflation has reached an 11-year high in the People\u2019s Republic of China (at 8.7% in February 2008); a 9-year high \nin the Republic of Korea (at 5.5% in June 2008), a 26-year high in Singapore (at 7.6% in April 2008); and a 12-year \nhigh in Viet Nam (at 25.2% in May 2008). \n15 This is because food prices have increased (year-on-year basis) the most over the last year: 59% in May 2008 and \n57% in June 2008 compared to about 7% during the corresponding months in 2007. Prices for wheat and meat \nproducts have increased by 47% and 49% respectively since the beginning of the 2008. \n16 Palanivel, T. 2008.

Mongolia's extensive system of social \nsafety nets cost about 7% of GDP a year in 2006, already large by international \nstandards. The effectiveness and fiscal sustainability of the current programs are \nbeing questioned, although limited data and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) \nsystems make it difficult to make definite judgments at this time. The FNSWPP \nwill demonstrate targeting methodologies and their direct impact on the poor. It \nwill  build  capacity  within  MSWL  and  provide  a  basis  for  rethinking  poverty-\nfocused strategies within the sector and for building adequate M&E systems. \n \n(iii)  Weak capacity at the local level among social workers and LSCs limits the \nbenefits  of  a  decentralized  system  and  compromises  the  ability  to  deliver \neffective community-based social services. Building capacity and creating clear \nguidelines on roles and responsibilities will facilitate the creation of efficient and \nadequate systems. \n \n(iv)  MSWL has no emergency response systems in place and is therefore unable to \naddress the needs of the poor immediately during this crisis. Designing an early \nwarning  system,  mitigation  and  response  mechanisms  for  food-related \nemergencies will provide a basis for action in the future to address other possible \ncrises. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  41 \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \nTable A3: Food Security \u2013 Proposed Assistance to the Government \n \n  Value of   \n  Assistance  Period of \nOrganization  ($)  Implementation\nA.

Bidding documents shall be sold to \nanyone who is willing to pay the required fee for the bidding documents, and no other \nconditions  shall  be  imposed  on  the  sale  of  the  bidding  documents.  The  bidding \ndocuments shall be delivered, at the prospective bidders' preference, either by hand or \nby mail or courier, provided that the bidder is willing to pay the mail or courier delivery \ncharges, which should be specified in the bid invitation. Each bidder shall be allowed to \npurchase only one set of the bidding documents for a given tender. No limitations shall be \nimposed on any bidder as to the number of tenders in which it may participate during a \ngiven period of time, but the bidder\u2019s qualification (financial and technical capabilities) for \naward  of  contract(s)  shall  be  assessed  on  the  basis  of  its  capacity  to  meet  the \naggregated qualifying requirements for the award of contracts for which it has submitted \nthe lowest evaluated substantially responsive bids.  \n \n(c)  Interested  foreign  bidders  from  eligible  countries  shall  be  allowed  to  participate \nwithout being required to associate or form joint ventures with local bidders.

The  evaluation  of  a  bidder\u2019s \nqualifications shall only take into account the bidder\u2019s capacity and resources to perform \nthe contract, in particular its experience and past performance on similar contracts, \ncapabilities with respect to personnel, equipment and construction or manufacturing \nfacilities and financial position. In carrying out the post-qualification assessment, the \nexecuting  agency/implementing  agency  shall  exercise  reasonable  judgment  in \nrequesting,  in  writing,  from  a  bidder  only  missing  factual  or  historical  supporting \ninformation related to the bidder's qualifications and shall provide a reasonable time \nperiod (that is, a minimum of 7 days) to the bidder to provide his response.  \n \n(b) Evaluation criteria to be used in the evaluation of bids shall be clearly specified in the \nbidding  documents,  and  evaluation  criteria  other  than  price  shall  be  quantified  in \nmonetary terms.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nMongolia is currently experiencing a very high inflation rate: 18.5% since the beginning of 2008 and 32.2% year-on-year in \nSeptember 2008. More than two-thirds of June inflation was due to increased food prices, with oil prices contributing a small \nbut growing proportion. Price hikes for food staples such as flour and meat are contributing the most, despite Government \nefforts over the past 9 months to regulate price increases. The poor are hardest hit by overall inflation and especially by the \nfood price increases.  \n \nMongolia has an extensive system of social welfare benefits and recently initiated a decentralized system for beneficiary \nidentification and delivery of services supported, in part, by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Social Security Sector \nDevelopment Project (SSSDP) loan. Assessments of the impacts of welfare benefits on the poorest have found that they are \noften limited because of: (i) lack of targeting, (ii) problems with coverage due to difficulties in attaining the necessary civil \nregistration, and (iii) limited capacity among service providers. There is consensus among stakeholders that any effort to \nmitigate the immediate impacts of the food price increases on the poor will need clear targeting mechanisms so it both makes \na difference for beneficiaries and is fiscally sustainable.  \n \nThe FNSWPP provides a targeted emergency response to an increase in food prices. It is directly aimed at providing \nassistance for the poor. The components build on the existing social welfare system and help the Government to design and \nimplement a food stamp program that specifically mitigates the impact of escalating food prices on the poor and strengthens \nthe social welfare system. The FNSWPP will do the following:  \n \n(i)  Target food stamp assistance directly to the poor. 100,000 urban and rural poor households will be covered, \nwith at least 70% of beneficiaries from the lowest quintiles. A proxy means test will be designed, used, and \neventually considered for other welfare programs.  \n(ii)  Create awareness on benefits and rights. The Project will create awareness of the food stamp program and \nprovide information about rights and registration procedures for receiving social welfare benefits. \n(iii)  Pilot community-based food security small grants. Small grants will be used to promote household and \ncommunity food security over the long term. The grants will build community greenhouses and kitchen gardens, \ninitiate small producer groups, and provide nutrition education. \n(iv)  Build  capacity  and  awareness  among  stakeholders.  Capacity  development  for  targeting,  food  stamp \nimplementation, civil registration procedures, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of welfare programs will be \ncarried out. \n(v)  Provide  technical  assistance  to  ensure  poverty-focused  social  welfare  systems.  Extensive  technical \nassistance will be provided by the Project to facilitate: (a) the design and implementation of the food stamp \nemergency response; and (b) analysis of key issues and design of M&E systems in support of the midterm social \nwelfare sector strengthening goals.  \n(vi)  Ensure gender inclusion. Gender dimensions of poverty will be covered in the proxy means test, in gender- \nsensitive communication and awareness programs, including women\u2019s non-government organizations (NGOs) in \nthe communication and community grants programs, promoting sex-disaggregated data in the monitoring and \nevaluation systems, and ensuring the gender dimensions are mainstreamed into the FNSWPP through the gender \nand development plan. \n \nThe grant directly supports Government plans to provide targeted assistance to the poor as part of emergency efforts to \naddress the food crisis. It supports the focus on inclusive social development the country partnership strategy. The design is \nin line with the emphasis on inclusive economic growth in ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020) \nand responds directly to the President\u2019s pledge at the ADB Annual Meeting in Madrid to assist developing member countries \nin tackling soaring food prices. ADB has a long history of involvement in the social protection sector in Mongolia. These grants \nbuild on the institutional structures and service delivery mechanisms that were designed and initiated under the SSSDP loan. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "66  Appendix 10 \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention-MDG (TI-M) \n \n1. Key Issues  \nFood stamp assistance will be targeted at poor households and will have a direct impact on: Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) 1 (ending poverty and hunger), MDG 4 (child health) and MDG 5 (maternal health), and an indirect impact on MDG 2 \n(primary education). In response to rising inflation and food prices, the Government set up a National Council in late 2007 to \noversee the implementation of a Price Stabilization Program. In May 2008, a working group headed by the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) was established under the National Council to develop a program to support vulnerable groups who are most affected \nby the increase in food prices. This work is complemented by a draft law proposing food and nutrition subsidies (approved by \nthe cabinet) which also calls for a food stamp program targeting the most vulnerable. In March 2008, fear of inflation was the \nnumber one problem identified by respondents in a survey by the Asia Foundation. The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor \n(MSWL) does not have a specific mechanism to: (i) address emergency needs arising from the food crisis, or (ii) identify the \npoorest in the community.  \n \nData on the impact of the rising food prices are scarce, but what is available reveals that poor households, and especially \nthose in urban areas, are particularly affected. In 2006, a joint Government of Mongolia\u2013UN Food Security Assessment \nMission concluded that food insecurity affected around 800,000 people (about 30% of the population) and was on the \nincrease in the largest cities (Darkhan, Erdenet, and Ulaanbaatar). Despite rising living standards overall, Mongolia is still \nconsidered one of poorest countries in Asia with an overall poverty rate of 32.6% in 2006. Of these, 4.5% were categorized as \nextremely poor. A household income and expenditure survey from 2006 to 2007 revealed enormous and rising inequality with \nregard to consumption. The poorest quintile of the population now spends about 71% of its consumption budget on food \ncompared with 23.6% for the wealthiest. The average for all income groups is 38.6%.a The food stamp program will directly \naddress this disparity by providing assistance to the poorest and helping them to cope with the rising cost of food. \n \nThe FNSWPP will contribute to poverty reduction and the priorities of MSWL and the Government by: (i) introducing targeting \nmethodologies that identify the poor and limit inclusion and exclusion errors; (ii) building capacity among stakeholders for \nimplementation,  and  awareness  among  the  public  on  the  rights  and  procedures  for  receiving  benefits; \n(iii) introducing M&E systems for the sector capable of identifying and analyzing impact; and (iv) providing small grants to \nfacilitate household food security and nutrition education for the mid- and long-term. Direct assistance for poor households to \nreduce the burden of food expenditure will help to reduce the use of coping mechanisms, such as reduced consumption \n(leading to malnutrition) and substitution from other expenditures on health, education, transport, and energy.  \n \nThe distribution of food stamps to poor households will directly address the MDGs. International experience has found the use \nof food stamps is more effective than cash transfers in increasing food consumption and improving nutrient availability. MDG \n1 (target 2) on hunger will be directly addressed by facilitating access to food for the poorest. As a consequence, FNSWPP \nwill also affect the attainment of MDG 4 (child health) and 5 (maternal health). Households headed by women and lactating \nmothers have both been identified in recent poverty assessments as being particularly vulnerable and these will be identified \nby the proxy means test. The incidence of underweight children, under-5 mortality, stunting, wasting, anemia and rickets are \nhigh in Mongolia compared with other Asian countries and daily calorific intake for poor households in only 63.3% of the \nrecommended amounts. The poverty and social assessment found that already poor households are cutting back on \nexpenditures including education expenses for children. Therefore MDG 2 (primary education) will also be addressed.  \n \n2. Design Features \nDirect poverty reduction mechanisms included in the project design include: (i) establishment of a targeting methodology to \nidentify poor households and beneficiaries; (ii) food stamps to increase income and food intake; (iii) extensive communication \noutreach directed at beneficiaries, communities, and other local stakeholders; (iv) piloting of community-based food security \nsmall grants; (v) establishment of monitoring and evaluation systems capable of analyzing the impact of the food stamp \nprogram specifically and social welfare programs overall; and (vi) capacity development of social workers and livelihood \nsupport councils. \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nThe direct and short-term impact of the food stamp policy reform will be improved access to food and social welfare services \nfor the poorest. Indirect short- and medium-term impacts include extending awareness of the food stamp program, civil \nregistration, and social welfare benefits among the poor and the general population.  \n \nThe reform will have a direct impact on household food budgets of the poorest and on their capacity to mitigate the impacts \nof food inflation. It will improve household nutrition, health, and the capacity of households to pay for other essentials such as \neducation, energy, and transport. The proxy means test will ensure proper identification. The policy reform will ensure that \nGovernment has a welfare mechanism designed to address emergency needs. \n \nThe policy reform addresses poverty reduction and the MDGs by: (i) establishing food stamp emergency assistance for the \npoorest; (ii) ensuring the poor are able to maintain nutritional levels and do not have to reduce access to healthcare, \neducation, transport and energy; (iii) initiating targeting methodologies to reduce errors of inclusion, exclusion; and (iv) \nestablishing an M&E system capable of monitoring impacts and informing program design and implementation. \n ", "    Appendix 10      67 \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis. Findings from the social analysis were generated from: (i) a review of available reports and \nstatistical data, (ii) stakeholder interviews, and (iii) a series of rapid community consultations carried out in urban (five in \nUlaanbaatar) and rural (six in Dundgobi aimag) communities. In each district and soum, one ordinary and one poor khoroob \n(Ulaanbaatar) or bagh (Dundgobi) was selected. Focus group discussions included the poor, elderly and disabled. Key \nfindings include:  \n \n(i) Rising food prices are directly affecting the poor and have a particular impact on the urban poor who lack alternative \naccess to food sources and have limited informal safety nets. National data for tracking the impacts of food price inflation are \nnot yet available. Urban and rural areas are both feeling the effects but there are important regional differences in price \nescalation that need to be analyzed. \n(ii) Coping mechanisms being used include: (a) limiting the quantity and quality of food consumed; (b) postponing or skipping \nexpenditures for schooling and medicines; (c) limiting travel; (d) substituting energy sources;c and (e) moving in with relatives \nto reduce costs, particularly of food and heating. The impacts have been primarily felt since May\u2013June 2008 and are expected \nto intensify over the winter when food expenditures must compete with energy needs in household budgets. \n(iii) Some poor families (e.g., migrants) are not properly registered and are therefore not receiving any social benefits. Many of \nthe poorest rely almost exclusively on child money and other benefits for basic subsistence. Lack of registration adds to the \nvulnerability of poor households who are forced to absorb the full impact of inflation with no assistance.  \n(iv)  Decentralized  services  need  to  be  strengthened.  Limited  capacity  and  inadequate  methodologies  constrain  the \neffectiveness of social worker outreach to poor populations and the effectiveness of livelihood support councils. \n(v) The food stamp program and community food security grants fill important gaps and are welcomed by the poor. \nConsultations confirmed support for a special food stamp program and verified that several kinds of informal systems \nproviding credit for welfare recipients are already in use with shops in rural areas. Community food security projects have not \nfocused exclusively on the urban poor. Stakeholders feel this is an important gap to be filled by this Project. \n(vi) The food stamp program should include informal markets (e.g., urban and rural wholesale markets) as partners. The pilot \ntests will investigate the viability of including these as they are important sources of cheaper and lower quality foods for the \npoor.  \n(vii) The choice of a food stamp program over cash transfers is motivated, in part, by stakeholders not wanting funds to go to \nalcohol purchases. Alcoholism is an important public health and social problem in Mongolia. \nB.    Consultation and Participation \n1. Extensive consultation was carried out with key national, local and community stakeholders during project preparation. \nSeveral Government and donor coordination meetings were coordinated by the ADB team. A series of rapid qualitative \nconsultations with urban and rural communities and local government stakeholders were out carried for the poverty and social \nassessment. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nThe FNSWPP will have no impact on involuntary resettlement and no adverse impacts on indigenous peoples. Therefore no \nC&P plan has been prepared. The FNSWPP will conduct an extensive community awareness communication program. \nC .   Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key Issues. Key gender issues relevant to the Project identified during preparation are covered in the poverty and social \nassessment (Supplementary Appendix G) and addressed in the gender and development plan and the FNSWPP design and \nimplementation. These include: (i) households headed by women and breastfeeding mothers are particularly impacted by \nrising food prices, therefore the gender dimensions of poverty should be addressed in the proxy means test to ensure that \nthey are properly identified; (ii) wholesale markets and informal rural markets are important shopping places for urban and \nrural poor and should, where possible, be included in the food stamp system; (iii) women are primarily in control of money and \ndecisions regarding food purchases and should be key stakeholders in the communication and awareness programs, and \nimplementation of community grants; (iv) communication strategies and information, education, and communication (IEC) \nmaterials must incorporate principles of social equity and inclusiveness; and (v) data disaggregated by sex are rarely \navailable in the social welfare monitoring systems and should be included in the FNSWPP to measure impacts and assist in \nrefining design and implementation.    \n2.  Key Actions \n    Gender plan         Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nKey features of the gender plan include: (i) attention to the gendered dimensions of poverty in the proxy means, (ii) piloting of \nurban wholesale markets in urban areas, (iii) gender-sensitive public information campaign, (iv) partnerships with women\u2019s \nNGOs for community-based pilots, (v) women\u2019s NGOs to serve as advocates for beneficiaries in grievances, (vi) data from \nstudies to be disaggregated by sex and gendered dimensions of poverty to be analyzed, and (vii) M&E to be carried out for \nthe food stamp program tracking its gender impact. The action plan does not require a separate budget, since it is integrated \ninto the overall FNSWPP cost and key indicators are included in the design and monitoring framework.
