The  environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no \nadverse impact was identified. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C \nImpact on indigenous peoples: Category C \nNo involuntary resettlement or adverse impact on indigenous peoples \nis expected from program and project implementation. \n \nSoaring  food  prices  in  Mongolia  pose  a  serious  threat  to  nutritional \nwelfare  and  could  reverse  recent  gains  in  poverty  reduction  and \nhuman  development  in  the  country.  Inflation  reduces  real  incomes \nand  expenditure  and  has  strong  social  and  poverty  impacts.  Higher \nfood prices are not merely short-term phenomena that the market will \nautomatically  correct.  Rising  inflation  has  strong  implications  for \nmacroeconomic  stability,  poverty  incidence,  and  inequality.  There  is \nample  reason  for  the  Government  to  intervene  in  the  short-term  by \nestablishing  targeted  subsidy  programs  to  alleviate  the  impact  of \ninflation  on  the  poor.  While  the  needed  response  is  urgent,  it  also \npresents  an  opportunity  to  introduce  innovative  safety  nets  that  are \nwell  targeted  towards  the  poor.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  an \nopportunity  to  improve  targeting  mechanisms;  strengthen  systems, \ncapacities, and strategies for effective social welfare service delivery; \nand  establish  early  detection,  mitigation,  and  rapid  response \nmechanisms for food crises and similar emergencies. The grant is in \ndirect support of government plans to provide targeted assistance to \nthe  poor,  and  supports  the  country  partnership  strategy  pillar  of \ninclusive  social  development  (in  preparation).  The  design  is  in  line \nwith the development agenda of inclusive economic growth in ADB\u2019s \nlong-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)  and \nresponds  directly  to  the  President\u2019s  pledge  at  the  ADB  Annual \nMeeting in Madrid to assist developing member countries to address \nthe problem of soaring food prices. \n \n \n\n \n\nGrant Recipient \n \nProposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nSocial  \nSafeguard \nAssessment \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nProgram Grant \nAmount \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \nand Implementation \nArrangements \n\nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  grants  is  reduced  vulnerability  to  food  insecurity \nthrough  increased  food  supply  and  improved  access  to  food  for \nvulnerable and poor households. The outcome is improved access to \nfood  by  vulnerable  and  poor  households  through  a  targeted  food \nstamp program and strengthened social welfare systems. \n \nIt is proposed that ADB supports the Government\u2019s policy reforms by \nproviding  a  grant  of  $9  million  to  Mongolia  to  fund  the  design  and \nimplementation of a food stamp program (component 1). \n \nThe implementation period of the Program will be 36 months. It will be \ncompleted  by  31  December  2011.  Funding  of  the  Program  will  be \nreleased  to  the  Government  in  a  single  payment  of  $9  million  upon \nprogram  effectiveness,  including  the  Government\u2019s  fulfillment  of  the \npolicy  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  as  confirmed  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy letter. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the Program. \nThe  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency.  A  program  steering  committee  composed  of  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  and  other  ministries  dealing  with  the  food  crisis,  selected \nlocal government representatives, nongovernment organizations, civil \nsociety,  and  the  private  sector  will  meet  quarterly  to  provide  policy \nand  strategic  guidance  to  the  Program.  ADB  will  participate  as  an \nobserver on the committee. \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  and  procurement \nprocedure  for  program  loans,  the  grant  proceeds  may  be  utilized  to \nprocure  goods  and  services  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes) \nproduced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than \nthose  specified  in  the list  of  ineligible  items,  those  financed  by  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  official  sources,  and  imports  from  non-ADB \nmember  countries.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the \ngrant  proceeds  and  verify \nthe  Government \ncertification. \n \nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  short-term  adjustment \ncost  generated  through  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  food \nstamp program (component 1). \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  grant  is  to  assist  the  Government  in \nimplementing the food stamp program; provide capacity development; \nstrengthen  social  welfare  systems;  and  establish  early  detection, \nmitigation,  and  rapid  response  mechanisms  for  food  crises  and \nsimilar emergencies. \n \nThe total project cost is estimated at $3.33 million equivalent. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nProject Grant \n\n \nProcurement \n\nthe  accuracy  of \n\n \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \nand Estimated \nProject Completion \nDate \n \nExecuting Agency \nand Implementation \nArrangements \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n\n \n\niii\n\nA  project  grant  of  $3  million,  representing  90%  of  the  Project\u2019s  total \ncost,  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.

It  will  be  completed  by  31 \nDecember 2011 and closed on 30 June 2012.  \n\n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  is  the  Executing  Agency.  The  Project  will \nhave  the  same  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  steering \ncommittee, and implementing unit as that of the Program. \n \nAll procurement to be financed under the Project grant will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  require  a  total  of  43  person-months  of  international \nand  76  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time \nto time). \n \nKey benefits and beneficiaries are as follows: \n \nTargeted  Safety  Net.  The  grants  will  provide  assistance  to  the \nGovernment  for  delivering  targeted  safety  nets  to  the  poor  and \nvulnerable at the time when the need is most urgent. The grants will \nprotect at least 100,000 poor and vulnerable households from the risk \nof malnutrition, and prevent them from sliding deeper into poverty.  \n \nFiscal Sustainability. By strengthening and reforming social welfare \nsystems,  especially  improving  targeting,  the  grants  will  contribute  to \nimproved  performance  and  fiscal  sustainability  of  the  social  welfare \nsector. \n \nGender  Benefits.  Women  are  the  most  likely  users  of  the  stamps, \nand  will  increase  their  ability  to  balance  the  household  budget, \nincrease  their  involvement  in  community  concerns,  and  benefit  from \nincreased awareness on their benefits and rights through the grants\u2019 \ninformation and education activities.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Mitigation  Major  risks and  mitigation  measures  considered  in  the  design  of  the \n\nImproved Local Capacity. The grants place emphasis on improving \nthe capacities of local governments and livelihood councils to deliver \ntargeted  safety  nets  and  social  welfare  assistance.  This  emphasis \ndirectly benefits poor and vulnerable people in terms of effective and \ntimely assistance. \n \nCivil  Society  Participation.  The  grants  recognize  civil  society\u2019s \npotential contributions  in  improving  targeting  of  social  welfare  and  in \nmobilizing its participation in implementing the FNSWPP. \n \nInstitutional Impact. Government institutions\u2014particularly Ministry of \nSocial  Welfare  and  Labor,  the  provincial  and  district  level  soum  and \nkhoroo  governors,  local  social  workers,  and  livelihood  councils\u2014will \ngain  increased  capacities  for  reforming  and  delivering  social  welfare \nservices,  and  integrating  civil  society  organizations  and  the  private \nsector in the implementation of the grants. \n \n\nFNSWPP are as follows: \n \nPolitical  Risks. Government ministries are concerned that the plans \nand  programs  developed  to  respond  to  increasing  food  prices  will \nhave to go through another process of review and scrutiny by the new \nGovernment, thus causing delays to the implementation of the grants. \nThe new minister of finance and minister of social welfare and labor \nhave  been  informed  about  the  preparation  of  the  assistance. \nGovernment officials directly involved in the preparation of the grants \nare still in place and are expected to remain. \n \nPilot-Testing  Risks. The risks here are twofold: (i) beneficiaries will \nexpect  a  pilot  to  immediately  become  an  entitlement,  thus  making \nlater program adjustments difficult; and (ii) the pilot will remain just a \npilot  even  if  the  results  are  good  and  the  recommendations  are \nappropriate.  These  risks  will  be  addressed  through  consultation  and \nclose involvement of beneficiaries in implementation of the pilots and \ncontinuous  policy  dialogue  with  the  highest  levels  of  government  on \nsocial welfare institutional reforms in order to facilitate the adoption of \npilot-testing results, especially on targeting. \n \nGovernance and Bureaucratic Risks. Implementation of food safety \nnets  is  prone  to  corruption  and  requires  proper  governance,  a  high \ndegree  of  accuracy,  and  synchronization  of  efforts  and  activities.  To \nmanage  this  risk,  the  food  stamp  operating  unit  will  be  immediately \nestablished to ensure that technical requirements of the program are \ngiven  full  attention  by  the  Government.  Governance  risk  will  be \naddressed  through  the  provision  of  clear  operational  guidelines,  a \ncommunication strategy to make the food stamp program transparent, \nand external monitoring. \n \n\n\f96  00'Eo\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\n\nMONGOLIA\nFOOD AND NUTRITION SOCIAL WELFARE \nPROGRAM AND PROJECT\n\n50  00'No\n\nUlaanbayshint\n\nUlaangom\n\nUVS\n\nTsengel\n\nTsagaannuur\n\nNaranbulag\n\nTes\n\nDayan\n\nBAYAN-\nOLGIY\n\nOlgiy\n\nOlgiy\n\nTudevtey\n\nHovd\n\nZAVHAN\n\nTsagaan-Uul\n\nMoron\n\nBULGAN\n\nSuhbaatar\n\nHutag-Ondor\n\nErdenet\n\nSelenge\n\nBulgan\n\nORHON\n\nSumber\n\nAltanbulag\n\nSELENGE\nDarhan\n\nDARHAN-UUL\n\nHanh\n\nHatgal\n\nHOVSGOL\n\nEreentsav\n\nBayan-Uul\n\nDORNOD\n\nHavirga\n\nManhan\n\nDariv\n\nHOVD\n\nUyench\n\nYarantay\n\nTayshir\n\nTsahir\n\nUliastay\n\nARHANGAY\n\nHishig Ondor\n\nBattsengel\n\nTsetserleg\n\nHarhorin\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nBaganuur\n\nBatnorov\n\nHENTIY\n\nChoybalsan\n\nLun\nZuunmod\nTOV\n\nNalayh\n\nMaanit\n\nOndorhaan\n\nMonhhaan\n\nMatad\n\nTamsagbulag\n\nAltay\n\nBayanhongor\n\nTogrog\n\nBuutsagaan\n\nArvayheer\n\nGOVI-ALTAY\n\nNariynteel\nOVORHANGAY\n\nBurgastay\n\nBAYANHONGOR\n\nGOVISUMBER\n\nChoyr\n\nBaruun-Urt\n\nErdenetsagaan\n\nBichigt\n\nSUHBAATAR\n\nMandalgovi\n\nDUNDGOVI\n\nTsogt-Ovoo\n\nDORNOGOVI\n\nSaynshand\n\nZamyn-Uud\n\nDalanzadgad\n\nOMNOGOVI\n\nBayan-Ovoo\n\nGashuun Suhayt\n\n50  00'No\n\n42  00'No\n\n42  00'No\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50 100\n\n150\n\n200 250\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n8\n-\n4\n0\n5\n7\n \nH\nR\n\n96  00'Eo\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA \n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMain Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n111  00'E\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  policy \nprogram grant, and (ii) a capacity development project grant to Mongolia for the proposed Food \nand  Nutrition  Social  Welfare  Program  and  Project  (FNSWPP).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework of the FNSWPP is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n2. \nGlobal  Food  Prices.  Over  the  past  year  (2007-2008),  food  prices  have  soared  to \nunprecedented levels all over the world1 with essential grains such as rice and wheat escalating \non  international  markets  (rice  by  196%  and  wheat  by  72%).2 The  supply  and  demand  factors \nunderlying the price increases include rising oil prices, which are driving up prices of fertilizers \nand fuels for agricultural production, increasing diversion of food crop acreage to biofuels, and \ngrowing  demands  for  grains  as  a  result  of  population  and  income  growth  in  emerging \neconomies  and  associated  dietary  changes.  Other  factors\u2014such  as  random  adverse  weather \nconditions,3 depreciation  of  the  US  dollar,4 and  precautionary  demand  for  food  stocks  in  many \ncountries5\u2014have  also  contributed  to  the  spike  in  food  grain  prices.  Policy  responses,  such  as \nexport  bans  by  rice-exporting  countries  (India,  Pakistan,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and  Viet \nNam),  have  also  resulted  in  increased  price  volatility.  While  the  unpredictable  and  short-term \nfactors of weather conditions, depreciation of the US dollar and precautionary demand for food \nstocks  are  significant,  they  are  expected  to  ease  over  the  coming  years.  However,  the  supply \nand  demand  factors  fueling  the  price  increases,  when  combined  with  climate  change  and \nnatural  resource  degradation,  result  in  medium-  to  long-term  impacts  and  indicate  that  the \nproblem  of  high  food  prices  will  continue  into  the  foreseeable  future.  In  July  2008,  the  United \nNations High Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis reported that, while food commodity \nprices  appear  to  be  stabilizing,  prices  are  expected  to  remain  high  over  the  medium-  to  long-\nterm (footnote 1).  \n \n3. \nThe most immediate consequence of rising food prices is the risk that an additional 100 \nmillion people (added to the already 845 million who are estimated to be undernourished) are \nbeing  driven  into  poverty  and  hunger  (footnote  1),  thus  jeopardizing  recent  achievements  in \npoverty  reduction,  attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs), 6  and  social \nstability. The challenge for governments around the world is to mitigate the immediate impacts \nof rising food prices, especially for the poor, and to develop medium- and long-term strategies \nfor addressing the root causes. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   United  Nations  (UN)  High  Level  Task  Force  on  the  Global  Food  Crisis.  2008.  Comprehensive  Framework  for \n\nAction. New York. \n\n2   Food and Agriculture Organization database. 2008. \n3   Food and Agriculture Organization. 2008. World wheat production declined in 2006 because of a 60% reduction of \n\noutput in drought-hit Australia, flooding in South Asia, and pest infestation and cold weather in Viet Nam.  \n\n4   Depreciation  of  the  US  dollar  contributed  to  increases  in  the  prices  of  \u201csoft\u201d  commodities  (including  wheat),  the \n\nprices of which are denominated in US dollars. \n\n5   Precautionary  demand  is  defined  as  replenishing  depleted  stocks,  reports  of  hoarding  by  private  traders,  and \n\nsustained procurement by some countries (such as Bangladesh and the Philippines) in international markets. \n\n6   Particularly those related to poverty, child mortality, maternal health, and education. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nSoaring  Food  Prices  in  Mongolia.  The spike in food and oil prices threatens to push \n4. \nlarge  numbers  of  people  back  below  the  poverty  line  in  Mongolia.7 The  inflation  rate  reached \n33%  in  May  2008  and  by  the  end  of  September  2008  fell  just  slightly  to  32.2%  year-on-year, \nwhich  is  much  higher  than  in  most  other  Asian  countries. 8  The  prices  of  wheat  (primarily \nimported)  and  meat  (domestically  produced)  contributed  to  nearly  half  of  the  overall  inflation,9 \nwith oil prices accounting for a small but growing proportion. \n \n5. \nThe underlying dynamics of the steep rise in inflation in Mongolia are multidimensional \n(footnote 7) and are influenced by (i) increasing domestic demand induced by rapid increase of \nwages,  social  transfers,  and  remittances;  (ii)  the  impact  of  imported  inflation;  (iii)  policies  that \nhave  been  built  up  over  the  years,  such  as  sustained  increases  in  monetary  expansion;  (iv) \nincreases  in  the  prices  of  government  services  (i.e.,  hospital  charges,  school  fees,  and \nelectricity  tariffs);  (v)  opportunistic  behavior  in  the  domestic  market;  and  (vi)  seasonal  and \ncyclical factors that aggravate the current situation.  \n \n6. \nBoth  external  and  domestic  factors  drive  food  price  inflation  in  Mongolia.  The  country \nhas  very  limited  capacity  for  agricultural  food  production  and  imports  almost  80%  of  its  food \nfrom the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian Federation, where food prices have also \nsignificantly  increased.  High  international  prices  transmit  directly  to  local  markets,  which  has \nresulted  in  staple  foods  such  as  rice  and  flour  doubling  in  price  since  the  beginning  of  2008. \nMeat  is  domestically  produced  and  accounts  for  36%  of  food  consumption.  Meat  prices  are \ndependent on domestic rather than external factors, including the number of livestock, weather \nconditions,  consumer  demands,  domestic  meat  procurement  practices,  and  supply  chain \nbottlenecks.10 Mongolia\u2019s macroeconomic context is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n7. \nSocial  Impacts  of  Rising  Food  Prices  in  Mongolia.  Evidence  on  the  impact  of  the \nrising  food  prices  is  scant,  but  the  available  poverty  and  household  income  and  expenditure \ndata does reveal that poor households, especially those in urban areas, are particularly at risk \nas  nonfood  expenditures  continue  to  rise.  In  2006,  a  joint  mission  of  the  Government  of \nMongolia (the Government) and a United Nations Food Security Assessment team11 concluded \nthat food insecurity affected around 800,000 people (about 30% of the population) and was on \nthe  increase  in  the  largest  cities  (Darkhan,  Erdenet  and  Ulaanbaatar).  Despite  rising  living \nstandards  overall,  Mongolia  is  still  considered  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  Asia,  with  an \noverall  poverty  rate  of  32.6%  of  the  population  in  2006,  of  whom  4.5%  are  categorized  as \nextreme poor. Data from the household income and expenditure survey (2006\u20132007) (footnote \n11)  demonstrates  that  the  poorest  of  the  poor  now  spend  about  71%  of  their  consumption \nbudget  on  food.  In  March  2008,  fear  of  inflation  rapidly  escalated  to  become  the  number  one \nproblem  identified  by  respondents  in  a  survey  implemented  by  the  Asia  Foundation.12 Over \n20,000 people took to the streets in April 2008 to protest against price increases and the issue \nreceived great attention in the June 2008 general election.  \n\n                                                 \n7   Palanivel,  T.  2008.

Ulaanbaatar. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n8. \nRapid qualitative community consultations carried out in preparation for this grant found \nthat,  as  a  result  of  the  soaring  food  prices,  poor  households  in  rural  and  urban  areas  are  (i) \nconsuming  less  food  and  food  of  lower  quality;  (ii)  postponing  or  skipping  expenditures  for \nschooling and medicines; (iii) limiting travel; (iv) substituting energy sources;13 and (v) moving in \nwith  relatives  to  reduce  costs,  particularly  of  food  and  heating.  Many  people  said  they  would \nrather  be  warm  than  full  in  the  winter  months,  when  rapid  escalations  in  heating  costs  force \nthem  to  shift  priorities  in  household  budgets.  The  main  impacts  of  rising  prices  have  been  felt \nover the summer months beginning in May\u2013June 2008. As the winter approaches, new stresses \nwill undoubtedly be felt.  The 2006 participatory poverty assessment in Mongolia found that the \npoor are much less likely to be able to cope with, and/or recover from, adverse circumstances \nbecause they have decreasing physical and social assets.14 If left unaddressed, in the medium- \nto  long-term,  the  soaring  food  prices  will  have  adverse  impacts  on  health  and  education \n(particularly for women and children) and will result in increased poverty.  \n \n9. \nThe  Government  has  shown  a  firm  commitment  to  immediately  deliver  an  emergency \nresponse  directed  to  the  poor.  The  emergency  of  the  food  crisis  highlights  several  challenges \nand  opportunities  for  the  social  welfare  sector,  such  as  (i)  addressing  inadequate  systems  for \ndelivering assistance targeted to the poor, (ii) defining social welfare strategies and enhancing \ncapacities, and (iii) addressing the absence of emergency response mechanisms. \n \n10. \nThe  Social  Welfare  Sector.  In  Mongolia,  the  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor \n(MSWL)  is  responsible  for  the  social  welfare,  social  insurance,  and  employment  issues  at  the \ncentral level.15 There are two implementing agencies under MSWL: the State Social Insurance \nGeneral Office (SSIGO) and the Labor and Social Welfare Office (LSWO). These agencies have \nrepresentatives  responsible  for  delivering  services  at  the  local  level.  Governors  of  all  local \ngovernments16 are obliged by law to undertake area-specific social protection activities.17 MSWL \nis also responsible for developing national policies on women, children, youth, the disabled, and \nthe elderly.    \n \n11. \nThe  types  of  social  welfare  assistance  provided  through  LSWO  include  (i)  in-kind \nservices  (e.g.,  residential  care)  for  elderly  and  disabled  people,  the  poor,  homeless  persons, \nand  children;  (ii)  subsidies  to  the  elderly  and  disabled  related  to  housing,  health  care,  and \ndevices  (e.g.,  wheelchairs  and  hearing  aids);  and  (iii)  short-term  cash  benefits  for  pregnancy \nand  delivery,  child  care,  multi-children  families,  support  for  adopting  orphans  and  infant  care, \nand pensions for those not eligible for assistance from the SSIGO.18  \n \n\n                                                 \n13 Rural  households  noted  using  dung  instead  of  firewood,  and  urban  ger  (traditional  tent)  residents  using  candles \n\ninstead of electricity to cut back on energy costs. \n\n14 National  Statistics  Office  (NSO),  ADB,  and  World  Bank.  2006.

Social Protection Index for Committed Poverty Reduction. Manila (volume 2). Mongolia has an above \naverage  social  protection  index,  ranking  fourth  among  31  Asian  countries,  almost  comparable  to  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic and next only to Japan and the Republic of Korea. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nIn  2001,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  loan  to  support  the  Social \n12. \nSecurity Sector Development Project (SSSDP)19 to initiate reforms in social welfare, insurance, \nand  employment  services  in  relation  to  the  emerging  needs  in  Mongolia\u2019s  transition  to  a  free \nmarket economy. The SSSDP has been implemented since February 2002 and, as of its partial \ncompletion  in  2007,20 has,  among  other  things,  (i)  facilitated  improvements  in  social  welfare \nfacilities  (residential  care  centers,  social  security  centers,  the  National  Centre  for  Vocational \nTraining and Rehabilitation for the Disabled);21 (ii) developed and facilitated the adoption of new \nprograms  (e.g.,  the  Center-Based  Program  for  Extremely  Vulnerable  People  and  Integrated \nCommunity-Based Social Welfare Services); and (iii) provided capacity development to MSWL \nand LSWO in the social welfare sector. \n \nThe  Government  adopted  the  social  security  sector  strategy  paper 22 in  2003  as  the \n13. \nframework  for  long-term  development  of  the  sector.23 The  strategy  paper  defined  three  long-\nterm  policy  reforms  for  social  welfare:  (i)  adjust  the  centralized  public  social  welfare  services \ntowards  a  comprehensive  social  welfare  system  that  is  community-based  and  supportive  of \nhouseholds\u2019 development, (ii) rationalize the scope for social welfare services and improve cost \nefficiency,  and  (iii)  introduce  services  that  provide  care  in  a  family  environment.  Among  the \nstrategies identified are (i) transforming cash-based benefits into multifunctional services based \non  the  initiative  and  choice  of  households  and/or  individuals;  (ii)  improving  the  quality  and \naccessibility of social welfare services; (iii) improving the management of, and methodologies in, \nsocial  welfare  services;  and  (iv)  reforming  residential  care  institutions  in  accordance  with \ncommunity-based approaches. The succeeding actions by the Government appear to be highly \ninconsistent with the strategy paper. \n \nIn  2005,  the  Government  introduced  the  child  money  program,24 which  was  the  first \n14. \nsocial welfare assistance that used a proxy means test25 to target poor households. However, in \nMay 2006, the Parliament enacted a new law which made \"child money\" a universal entitlement, \nwith all children below 18 years of age being eligible. Immediately, the number of social welfare \nbeneficiaries  soared  from  less  than  160,000  in  2004  to  more  than  1  million  (40%  of  the \npopulation)  in  2006,  and  ADB  expressed  two  concerns:  (i)  that  making  the  benefits  universal \nwas  not  consistent  with  the  Government's  commitment  to  implement  targeted  support  for  the \npoor,  and  (ii)  that  the  fiscal  sustainability  of  such  welfare  measures  was  unclear.26 Recently, \nnewly  instituted  social  welfare  programs\u2014such  as  the  honored  mothers\u2019  allowance  and \nnewborn and newlywed programs\u2014are more pro-natalist policies rather than being specifically \ngeared towards reducing poverty. \n \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB.  2001.

Currently, the child money program provides cash transfers of MNT3,000 ($3) per child \nper month and MNT100,000 ($100) as a lump sum per child per year.   \n\n25 The  proxy  means  test  was  developed  through  collaboration  between  SSSDP,  MSWL,  UNDP,  and  the  Poverty \n\nResearch Group of the Ministry of Finance.  \n\n26 This resulted in the cancellation of the third tranche of the SSSDP loan. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nThe  concerns  raised  by  ADB  capture  the  prevailing  issues  in  the  whole  social  welfare \n15. \nsector  to  date.  All  23  types  of  current  social  welfare  assistance  use  population  categories27 \nrather than poverty as a basis for eligibility. More than 80% of social welfare beneficiaries since \n2005  are  those  receiving  \u201cchild  money\u201d. 28  Among  the  four  social  protection  indicators \n(expenditure, coverage, poverty targeting, and social protection impact),29 targeting received the \nlowest rating in the social protection index.30 The index gives Mongolia a \u201cbest estimate\u201d overall \npoverty targeting rate of only 60%.  \n \nSocial transfers31 have risen sharply from 2006 to 2008. The increases were not related \n16. \nto price hikes or poverty incidence, but were due to the interplay of political pressures and the \nuniversal  coverage  of  social  cash  transfers.  The  child  money  program  comprised  28%  of  the \nMSWL budget in 2007, other cash transfers such as the honored mothers\u2019 allowance are being \nconsidered  for  very  large  increases  in  2009, 32  and  one  of  the  Government\u2019s  immediate \nresponses  to  the  food  crisis  was  again  to  increase  welfare  benefits  by  20%  in  January  2008. \nDespite  the  increase  in  mining  revenues,  which  has  helped  trigger  the  increases  in  public \nspending in recent years, the major risk for the sector is the escalation in expenditures and the \nunfavorable  creation  of  an  entitlement  system  that  may  not  be  sustainable  but  will  be  very \ndifficult to cut in the future. A detailed description of the social welfare sector is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nIssues \n\nRapid and persistent food price increases raise both immediate and long-term issues. \n\n \n17. \n \n18. \nIncreasing  Malnutrition.  The  increase  in  food  prices  creates  an  immediate  risk  of \nincreasing malnutrition and worsening food and nutrition indicators in Mongolia. The incidence \nof underweight children, under-5 mortality rates, stunting, wasting, anemia, and rickets are high \nin  Mongolia  compared  with  other  Asian  countries.  The  recommended  daily  calorie  intake  for \nadult Mongolians is 2,604.3 calories but, according to survey data gathered before the spike in \nfood  prices,  the  average  calorie  intake  among  poor  households  is  1,728.3  calories,  or  only \n63.3%  of  the  recommended  intake. 33  Limiting  food  consumption,  the  number  one  coping \nmechanism  cited  by  focus  groups  in  the  poverty  and  social  assessment  (Supplementary \nAppendix G), will directly affect these intake levels. \n \n19. \nIncreasing  Poverty.  Sustained  high  food  prices  will  have  a  direct  effect  on  poor \nhouseholds  and  will  stress  households  living  just  above  the  poverty  line.  The  urban  poor \nallocate  46%  of  their  expenditure  to  food,  8%  to  heating,  and  3%  to  transport  and \ncommunication,  while  for  the  rural  poor  58%  is  spent  on  food,  3%  on  heating,  and  3%  on \n\n                                                 \n27 Examples  of  current  targets  of  social  assistance  are  the  disabled,  the  elderly,  pregnant  women,  and  lactating \n\n28 National Statistics Office. 2007.

The Government plans to further increase the honored \nmothers\u2019 allowance to MNT500,000 for mothers  with five  or six children and MNT1 million for mothers  with more \nthan six children, covering 155,000 mothers in 2009. \n\n33 Nutrition Research Center and UNICEF. 2006. 3rd National Nutrition Survey Report. Ulaanbaatar. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ntransport  and  communication  (footnote  7).  Without  direct  assistance  or  access  to  increased \nincome, poverty levels will rise as households are increasingly unable to meet their basic needs. \n \n20. \nUndermining  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  In  the  long  term,  the  impact  of \nincreased  food  prices  will  undermine  poverty  reduction  gains  and  make  the  MDGs  relating  to \npoverty, child and maternal health, and education more difficult to achieve. Poor households are \nforced  to  increase  their  food  expenditure  at  the  expense  of  nonfood  expenditure  such  as \nmedical care and education. These reductions will ultimately adversely affect the achievement \nof the MDGs and will have a particular impact on women and children.  \n \n21. \nStraining Informal Support Networks. A vital network of informal safety nets sustains \nmany Mongolian households. Around 70% receive family remittances, which constitute around \n22%  of  their  consumption,34 making  remittances  a  very  important  factor  in  reducing  poverty.35 \nThe adverse effects of the devastating dzud in 2000 were somewhat cushioned by this informal \nsafety net. Food price increases are affecting the budgets of both the remitting and the receiving \nhouseholds, which may ultimately weaken this informal support network, consequently reducing \nits impact on poverty.   \n \n22. \nIncreasing Social Instability. If food prices and the costs of other basic needs such as \nenergy  and  transport  continue  to  rise,  other  more  drastic  coping  mechanisms,  such  as  asset \nshedding  of  livestock  in  rural  areas  or  spending  to  cover  food  and  fuel  costs  in  urban  areas \ninstead  of  other  basic  needs  such  as  education  and  medicine,  may  prevail.  These  responses \nmay result in increased movement of people and/or increased social instability in both rural and \nurban areas.  \n \n23. \nalready facing considerable issues. These include the following: \n \nLack  of  Targeting  in  Current  Programs. The lack of proper targeting results in large \n24. \ninclusion and exclusion errors in the sector. A significant portion of social assistance goes to the \nnonpoor  (70%  of  all  nonpoor  households  receive  some  form  of  social  assistance),  but  a \nsubstantial portion of the poor are excluded from these programs (40% of the country\u2019s poor do \nnot receive any form of social assistance).36 As a consequence of poor targeting, in the absence \nof  social  assistance,  the  incidence  of  poverty  could  increase  by  10%.37 These  errors  result  in \nhuge  expenditures  for  the  Government  and  exclude  a  significant  portion  of  poor  households \nfrom the needed government assistance.   \n \n25. \nin  Public  Expenditure  for  Social  Assistance.  The  current \nuntargeted  cash  transfers  result  in  high  public  expenditures,  which  are  still  rising.  MSWL\u2019s \nbudget  has  risen  from  7%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2006,  to  10%  in  2007,  and  to \n16%  in  2008.  The  proposed  MSWL  budget  for  2009  will  further  raise  this  to  23%  of  GDP  in \n2009.  Two  issues  are  paramount:  (i)  the  fiscal  sustainability  of  current  social  welfare \nexpenditures; and (ii) the resulting entitlements for large numbers of people, which are difficult \nto cut if found to be unsustainable. \n\nSoaring  food  prices  will  put  additional  demand  on  the  social  welfare  system,  which  is \n\nIncreases \n\nRapid \n\n                                                 \n34 National  Statistics  Office  (NSO)  of  Mongolia.  2004.  2002\u20132003  Living  Standard  Measurement  Survey  (LSMS). \n\nUlaanbaatar. \n\n35 Family remittances work both ways; rural households usually send meat to family members in the urban areas, and \n\nurban households usually send cash and goods to their relatives in rural areas. \n\n36 The  poor  might  be  registered,  but  due  to  factors  such  as  deficient  targeting,  lack  of  information,  lack  of  skills,  or \nlack of money for transportation, they might not be receiving social assistance which in theory they are entitled to. \n\n37 World Bank. 2006. Mongolia Poverty Assessment. Ulaanbaatar. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n26. \nCreating Additional Benefits. The proposed 2009 budget of MSWL is a 51% increase \nover  the  2008  budget  due  to  a  huge  increase  (900%)  in  the  benefit  amount  for  the  honored \nmothers\u2019 allowance. In recent elections the Government promised that MNT1.5 million from the \nrevenues of the mining sector would be given out to all Mongolians as a \u201cmotherland benefit\u201d. In \nlight of the current economic and financial situation, the Government might have to consider the \nfeasibility of this benefit. \n \nAbsence of Mechanisms for Emergency Response. There is a need for Mongolia to \n27. \n(i) constantly strive to ensure food security among its population; and (ii) have early detection, \nmitigation, and response systems in place for food-related emergencies. While promoting food \nsecurity  should  be  a  medium-  to  long-term  priority,  the  need  to  establish  early  warning, \nmitigation,  and  response  mechanisms  for  food-related  emergencies  should  be  an  immediate \npriority.   \n \n28. \nLack  of  Impact  Measurement  and  Inadequate  Monitoring  and  Evaluation. Despite \nthe  rapid  increase  in  expenditure  and  creation  of  new  cash  transfers  and  benefits,  due  to  the \nlack of adequate monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems and efforts at impact measurement, \nthe  Government  has  limited  understanding  of  the  impact  of  the  welfare  programs.  As  a \nconsequence,  there  are  few  mechanisms  (other  than  calculations  on  expenditures  and \ncoverage) to determine if the Government is getting value for money and/or if the assistance is \nmaking a significant impact.  \n \n29. \nLimited Access to Social Assistance. The complexities of the civil registration system \nlimit access of poor households to social assistance. Civil registration is free but many migrants \ndo  not  register  because  of  bureaucratic  red  tape  and  limited  understanding  of  the  registration \nprocesses  involved.38 Lack  of  money  and  no  permission  (to  de-register)  are  among  the  main \nreasons  for  not  registering.  Many  migrants  do  not  de-register  from  their  places  of  origin,  thus \ncreating  problems  in  MSWL  records.  Local  administrative  bodies  are  hesitant  to  pursue \nunregistered persons because of the resulting implications on their fiscal budgets and capacity \nto deliver services. As a result, a portion of the population, especially in urban areas, either lose \nthe opportunity to receive Government assistance or are allocated assistance somewhere else. \n \n30. \nDecentralized  Welfare  System  with  Limited  Capacity.  Local  social  welfare  delivery \nstructures still need capacity enhancements. Social welfare officers have heavy workloads and \nlimited  knowledge  of  proper  social-work  practices.39 The  soum  and  khoroo  livelihood  support \ncouncils  (LSCs)  were  established  by  law  in  2007  to  support  service  delivery  and  promote \nfairness  in  beneficiary  identification  and  targeting, 40 but  little  has  been  done  to  clarify  and \nstrengthen  the  LSC\u2019s  role  in  the  social  welfare  system.41 Community-based  delivery  of  social \nservices  is  still  an  underdeveloped  concept  in  Mongolia,  despite  SSSDP  assistance  in  this \nspecific area. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n38 NSO, ADB, World Bank. 2006. Participatory Poverty Assessment in Mongolia. Ulaanbaatar. \n39 Less than 20% of local social welfare officers have degrees in social work. \n40 This was previously the responsibility of the office of the soum/khoroo governor. \n41 Issues were raised in the qualitative consultations regarding the selection and objectivity of the council members. \nOn  the  other  hand,  many  LSCs  complain  that  their  recommendations  are  not  being  recognized  by  higher \nauthorities at the aimag and district level.   \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \n\na. \n\nGovernment Response  \n\n \nEstablishment  of  National  Council,  Price  Stabilization  Committee,  and  Program. \n31. \nThe  Government  has  organized  a  price  stabilization  committee  which  has  undertaken  short-\nterm measures including (i) subsidizing reserves for meat and supply of petrol products from the \nRussian  Federation,  (ii)  nullifying  import  duties  of  flour  and  negotiating  discounted  prices  from \nthe Russian Federation for imports of flour, and (iii) conducting regular monitoring of retail prices \nfor certain basic consumer products. Changes in fiscal and trade policies were also introduced \nby  the  Government\u2019s  action  plan  approved  in  May  2008.42 Although  prices  remain  high,  the \nretail prices for meat, petrol, and flour appear to have stabilized in the third quarter of 2008 as a \nresult of these interventions. \n \n32. \nSubprogram  Directed  at  Vulnerable  Populations.  In  May  2008,  the  Government \nstarted to develop a subprogram to directly support vulnerable groups who are most affected by \nthe food price increase.43 ADB has worked closely with the Government to ensure the FNSWPP \nis  in  line  with  this  subprogram.  The  subprogram  has  several  components:  a  food  stamp \nprogram; temporary shelter and hot meals; and systems improvement in social welfare policies, \nstrategies,  and  evaluation.  The  Government  has  proposed  a  budget  amendment  to  allocate \nMNT1.23 billion to subprogram activities for the remainder of 2008. The Government has also \nestimated that Parliament will need to consider a budget allocation of at least MNT10 billion for \nthe subprogram for 2009.  \n \nNational  Food  Security,  Food  Safety  and  Nutrition  Program.  The  Food  Security, \n33. \nFood  Safety  and  Nutrition  Program  (Food  II  Program 44 ),  under  the  Ministry  of  Food  and \nAgriculture (MOFA), is primarily designed to increase domestic food production. A draft law to \nsupport  implementation  of  this  plan  has  been  submitted  to  the  Parliament  of  Mongolia  for \napproval. \n \n34. \nProposed  Food  Subsidy  Law. A draft law proposing food and nutrition subsidies was \nforwarded  to  Parliament  in  May  2008.  The  draft  law  specifies  the  use  of  food  stamps  and \nproposes to target the poor to deliver food subsidies to the poorest households. The draft law, \nonce  passed,  will  represent  the  legal  umbrella  for  the  subprogram  developed  by  the \nGovernment and the food stamp program developed under the FNSWPP.  \n \n\nb. \n\nMongolia\u2019s Increasing Revenues \n\n \n35. \nSpecial  Development  Fund. A special development fund has been established in line \nwith the increase in revenue from the mining sector. The long-term prospect of revenue from the \nmining  sector  and  the  creation  of  the  special  development  fund  provides  potential  sources  of \nfunding to sustain targeted social welfare programs. \n \n\n                                                 \n42 This  includes  tax  exemption  for  oil  and  food  products,  subsidizing  domestic  wheat-producing  farms  by  providing \n\nfarmers with seeds at discounted price, and subsidizing public transportation.   \n\n43 The subprogram  was developed by a multisector  working group led  by the director general of the Department of \nEconomic Policy at the Ministry of Finance, with members coming from a wide range of line ministries, civil society, \nand donors. It is a subprogram under the Food Security, Food Safety and Nutrition Program developed under the \nleadership of the Ministry of Agriculture. \n\n44 This program is also commonly translated as the Second Program on Food Supply, Quality and Safety. \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nc. \n\nPublic Response \n\n \n36. \nPublic  Opinion  on  Inflation.  In  March  2008,  fear  of  inflation  rapidly  escalated  to \nbecome  the  number  one  problem  identified  by  respondents  in  a  semiannual  randomized \nlongitudinal  survey  implemented  by  the  Asia  Foundation  since  early  2006.  Until  March  2008, \nunemployment and corruption had consistently turned out first and second in the list of problems \n(footnote  12).  Over  20,000  people  took  to  the  streets  in  April  2008  to  protest  against  price \nincreases and the issue received great attention in the June 2008 general election. No further \nprotests  have  been  reported  since  the  election.  The  strong  public  opinion  indicates  public \nsupport and demand for an immediate and appropriate response from the Government. \n \n\nd. \n\nDevelopment Agencies Response \n\nLessons \n\nKey lessons learned have been identified from previous assistance to, and analysis of, \n\n \n37. \nA  number  of  development  agencies  are  expressing  interest  in  supporting  the \nGovernment in addressing the food crisis. The World Bank has prepared a policy note on rapid \ninflation and is proposing a program to help improve food security in rural areas, and address \nthe  underlying  causes  of  Mongolia\u2019s  extremely  high  inflation  by  strengthening  macro-\nmanagement  and  targeting  of  social  assistance.  The  World  Bank  proposal  presents  several \nopportunities  for  collaboration  which  are  being  discussed.  The  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP), Food and Agriculture Organization, and other United Nations and bilateral \nagencies are also considering some form of  assistance. Several humanitarian nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) are continuing to provide daily feeding programs targeting the homeless \nand the poorest of the poor. The development coordination matrix (Appendix 3) details existing \nand planned support programs.  \n \nC. \n \n38. \nthe social welfare sector. \n \n39. \nReluctance  to  Implement  Targeted  Social  Welfare  Programs.  The  combination  of \npoor  benefits  targeting  and  exclusion  of  unregistered  residents  from  many  social  welfare \nprograms means that poverty reduction from social protection support has been limited. Recent \namendments  to  the  Social  Welfare  Law  (January  2008)  revised  the  eligibility  criteria  for \nrecipients of benefits but still did not distinguish between beneficiaries with income above and \nbelow the poverty line. Reforms to improve targeting of social welfare programs will be limited \nby  public  sensitivities,  popular  expectations,  and  political  demands.  Reluctance  to  undertake \ntargeting  can  also  partly  be  attributed  to  the  lack  of  capacity,  knowledge  on  targeting \nmechanisms,  and  identification  of  workable  models.  The  current  inflationary  environment  that \nhas  highlighted  the  clear  need  to  assist  the  most  vulnerable  has  led  stakeholders  to  take  the \nopportunity to create a targeted welfare benefit to address the situation. \n \n40.  Weak Institutional Capacity to Undertake Policy Reforms. The implementation of the \ninvestment  loan  of  the  ongoing  SSSDP  has  made  satisfactory  progress,  with  achievements  in \nthe  areas  of  employment  promotion  and  social  insurance,  but  the  policy  loan  has  not.  The \nGovernment\u2019s decision to make the child money program universal led to the cancellation of the \nthird  tranche  of  the  policy  loan.  Technical  assistance  (TA)  completion  reports45 find  that  poor \ninterministerial  coordination,  weak  project  management  capacity,  staff  turnover,  and  policy \nvacillation affected project implementation. \n\n                                                 \n45 ADB. 2008.

Newly  instituted  social \nwelfare  programs\u2014such  as  the  honored  mothers\u2019  allowance,  child  money,  and  newborn  and \nnewlywed programs\u2014are not primarily geared towards reducing poverty but are in fact tools to \npromote population growth. This might be a legitimate policy objective but it blurs the principle of \ndirecting social welfare assistance to the poor. Focusing social welfare on poverty issues would \nincrease the performance and the impact of the social protection sector.  \n \nIncrease  Social  Welfare  Spending  as  Government  Revenues \n42. \nIncrease.  There is a tendency in the Government to further expand the social welfare system \nbecause  of  expected  revenue  growth  from  the  mining  sector.  The  high  level  of  social \nexpenditures might be difficult to sustain if revenues from the mining sector drop in the future, or \nif the Government changes its development priorities. At the same time, experience shows that \nit will be difficult to cut social welfare spending once programs are considered by the public as \nentitlements.  One  related  lesson  is  that  there  is  a  lack  of  capacity,  and  to  some  extent \nreluctance, in the Government to measure the impact of social welfare spending. Result-based \nmanagement of social welfare programs should increasingly become the basis for funding these \nprograms. \n \n43. \nDirect Food Aid is Costly and Poorly Targeted. Lessons learned from direct food aid \nInternational \ndistribution \nDevelopment  and  the  Government  of  Japan,  point  to  problems  of  targeting  and  prohibitive \ndistribution costs.  The city  government  of  Ulaanbaatar  included  over  60%  of  the  population of \nthe  capital  in  the  list  of  beneficiaries  for  the  recent  Indian  rice  and  sugar  donation\u2014a  good \nexample  of  poor  targeting.  Some  governments  authorize  the  selling  of  food  donations  on  the \nmarket and then use the proceeds of the sales to fund social programs. These strategies do not \nalways ensure that the benefits directly reach those most in need. There is a need for innovation \nin food assistance across the country. \n \n44. \nFood  Stamps  as  the  Appropriate  Safety  Net.  There  are  safety  nets  that  can  be \nconsidered  aside  from  food  stamps.  Food  for  work  can  be  applied  as  a  local  initiative  to \ncomplement  a  national  initiative  such  as  food  stamps.  Direct  or  in-kind  food  distribution  has \nproven to be costly and generally suffers from a lack of targeting. Targeted cash transfers can \nbe easier and less costly to implement but there is evidence that the use of food stamps is more \neffective \nimproving  nutrient \navailability.46 It is expected that the use of food stamps could help in modifying the behavior of \nthe general population towards cash-based assistance.47 Hesitation to use cash was repeatedly \nbrought  up  in  stakeholder  consultations  because  of  the  fear  that  cash  could  be  used  to \npurchase alcohol. Alcoholism is a major public health issue in the country and both government \nand community members felt that it was important to target this assistance in such a way that it \nwould  not  exacerbate  any  problems.  The  Government,  which  tends  to  resort  to  unconditional \ncash transfers, favors the use of food stamps as a safety net response to the increasing food \n                                                 \n46 Poor people tend to have higher marginal propensity to consume food as a result of food transfers than equivalent \ncash transfers. US experiences in food stamps indicate that (i) an additional dollar of food stamps increased food \nconsumption  by  17%\u201347%,  as  opposed  to  5%\u201313%  induced  by  cash;  (ii)  the  effect  on  nutrient  availability  was \nroughly 2\u20137 times larger for food stamps than cash; and (iii) the switch from food stamps to cash transfers triggered \na reduction in food expenditures of between 18% and 28%. Studies done outside the US also indicate the same \ntrend (Gentilini, Ugo. 2007. Cash and Food Transfers: A Primer. Rome: WFP). \n\nfood  consumption  and \n\nthan  cash \n\nincreasing \n\ntransfers \n\n47 Cash-based  assistance  manifests  the  following  tendencies:  (i)  it  provides  an  incentive  for  people  to  push  for  the \nbenefit  regardless  of  their  poverty  situation,  (ii)  it  limits  opportunities  for  implementing  systems  which  use  self \nselection,  (iii)  it  could  be  misused  to  purchase  nonfood  items,  and  (iv)  it  increases  opportunities  for  misuse  of \nfunds. \n\nin \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nInternational  Lessons \n\nprices  and  will  be  in  a  position  to  gain  significant  lessons  for  policy  formulation  and  program \ndevelopment related to safety nets and other social welfare benefits. Furthermore, a food stamp \nprogram is flexible and can be shut down and/or reinitiated depending on the need.  \n \nfrom  Food  Stamp  Programs.  Many  countries  have \n45. \nimplemented  food  stamps,  and  the  US  has  the  longest-running  coupon-based  food  subsidy \nsystem, which was established in 1964. Food stamps have consistently been found to increase \nfood consumption (more than with cash transfer) but have weak effect in reducing malnutrition. \nMany food stamp programs that have started as a temporary measure to sustain consumption \nof  certain  vulnerable  groups  have  continued  even  after  the  worst  effects  have  passed.  Food \nstamps  are  complex  to  implement  and  critical  design  decisions  include  (i)  determining  clear \nprogram  objectives  and  target  population,  (ii)  implementing  well-defined  beneficiary  selection \nprocesses  and  entrance  and  exit  strategies,  and  (iii)  building  the  institutional  capacity  to  carry \nout  the  program.  Important  implementation  considerations  are  (i)  establishing  the  legal  and \nregulatory  framework,  (ii)  preparing  a  detailed  operations  guidelines,  (iii)  preparing  a  central \nregistry  of  beneficiaries,  (iv)  printing  stamps  on  secure  paper,  (v)  ensuring  prompt  delivery  of \nfood  stamps  and  stamp  redemption,  and  (vi)  carrying  out  effective  M&E.  Electronic  transfer \ncards reduce fraud and permit tracking of foods purchased but have higher administrative costs. \nTaking  precautions  to  avoid  adverse  incentives  (black  markets,  fraud,  impact  on  leisure \ndecisions, and migration) are important elements to consider.48 \n \n46. \nRationale  for  the  FNSWPP.  Soaring  food  prices  in  Mongolia  pose  a  serious  threat  to \nnutritional welfare and could reverse recent gains in poverty reduction and human development \nin  the  country.  Inflation  reduces  real  incomes  and  expenditures  and  has  strong  social  and \npoverty impacts. Higher food prices are not merely short-term phenomena that the market will \nautomatically  correct.  Rising  inflation  has  strong  implications  for  macroeconomic  stability, \npoverty incidence, and inequality. There is ample reason for the Government to intervene in the \nshort-term by establishing targeted subsidy programs to alleviate the impact of inflation on the \npoor. While the needed response is urgent, it presents an opportunity for introducing innovative \nsafety nets that are well-targeted towards the poor. At the same time, there is an opportunity to \nimprove  targeting  mechanisms;  strengthen  systems,  capacities,  and  strategies  for  effective \nsocial  welfare  service  delivery;  and  establish  early  detection,  mitigation,  and  rapid  response \nmechanisms  for  food  crises  and  similar  emergencies.  The  grant  is  in  direct  support  of \nGovernment  plans  to  provide  targeted  assistance  to  the  poor  and  supports  the  country \npartnership strategy pillar of inclusive social development (in preparation). The design is in line \nwith  the  development  agenda  of  inclusive  economic  growth  in  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic \nframework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)49 and responds directly to the President\u2019s pledge at the \nADB  Annual  Meeting  in  Madrid  to  assist  developing  member  countries  in  addressing  the \nproblem of soaring food prices.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe impact of the Program is reduced vulnerability to food insecurity through increased \n47. \nfood supply and improved access to food by vulnerable and poor households.

The food stamp program \ncould  be  shut  down  or  expanded  depending  on  the  severity  of  the  food  crisis.  The  project \ncomponents will maximize learning opportunities from pilot testing and program implementation \nto develop and embed within the Government, system capacities and instruments for (i) proper \ntargeting,  (ii)  measuring  and  analyzing  impacts  of  the  food  crisis,  (iii)  external  M&E,  and  (iv) \ncommunity-based approaches to ensuring household food security.  \n \n50. \nActual implementation of the food stamp program will be used as a reference point for \nproviding inputs to improve social welfare analysis tools and strategies. Technical inputs will be \nprovided  for  applying  lessons  from  food  stamps  implementation  to  other  social  welfare \nprograms. Technical inputs will form the basis for active policy dialogue at the highest level of \nGovernment to promote institutional reforms of the social welfare sector. \n \nC. \n \n\nThe Program Grant \n\n1. \n\nComponent  1:  Design  and  Implementation  of  a  Targeted  Food  Stamp \nProgram \n\n \nComponent 1 will pilot the targeting and delivery mechanisms for delivering food stamps \n51. \nand  test  the  overall  design.  The  results  of  the  pilot  testing  will  be  used  to  finalize  the  overall \ndesign  (including  the  targeting  and  delivery  mechanisms)  to  be  used  for  expanding  coverage \nuntil  2011  (or  earlier  if  the  assistance  is  no  longer  needed).  A  total  of  at  least  100,000 \nbeneficiaries (equal to about 4.5% of the population designated as the most poor) will receive a \nmonthly  cash  equivalent  of  $14  as  food  stamps.  This  amount  is  equivalent  to  monthly \nexpenditures on food of the poorest quintile,50 hence doubling their purchasing power on food. \nThe food stamp program will be built on best international practices and lessons learned from \nimplementation of pilot approaches. The outputs of component 1 are:  \n \n\na. \n\nOutput 1: Innovative Targeting Approaches for Food Stamps Pilot-\nTested \n\n \n52. \nApproach 1. From January 2009, the Government will start distributing food stamps as \nan emergency measure to approximately 30,000 disabled and elderly beneficiaries. Approach 1 \nwill  identify  beneficiaries  according  to  the  definition  of  vulnerable  groups  as  included  in  the \nsocial welfare laws. \n \n53. \nApproach  2. Approach 2 will make use of and update existing MSWL lists of disabled \nand  elderly  beneficiaries  in  selected  pilot  areas.  The  updating  process  will  involve  adding \nbeneficiaries  and  deleting  recipients  previously  excluded  from  receiving  benefits  based  on  the \n\n                                                 \n50 National Statistics Office. 2007.

The \npilot-testing  process  will  be  as  follows:  (i)  the  social  worker  updates  the  list,  (ii)  university \nstudents  or  NGO  partners  validate  the  list  through  home  visitation  and  assessment  of \nsocioeconomic  conditions,51 (iii)  the  LSC  further  validates  the  list,  and  (iv)  food  stamps  are \nprovided  to  the  persons  on  the  validated  list.  Approach  2  will  be  administered  in  selected \nsample areas in and around Ulaanbaatar to initially reach 20,000 beneficiaries. It is envisaged \nthat approach 2 will be started immediately. The recipients of approach 2 will be different to the \nbeneficiaries selected for the emergency measure of the Government (Approach 1). \n \nApproach  3.  Approach  3  will  employ  innovative52 targeting  approaches  for  identifying \n54. \nbeneficiaries. This approach will explicitly conduct outreach and target households in the poor \nareas or outskirts of the cities, identified through a household assessment as among the poorest \nand  eligible  for  the  assistance. 53  The  pilot-testing  process  will  be  as  follows:  (i)  sample \ngeographic  areas  in  or  around  Ulaanbaatar  not  covered  by  approach  2  and  considered  as \n\u201cpockets  of  poverty\u201d  are  identified  for  piloting,  (ii)  a  survey  using  the  household  assessment \nform54 is administered in all the households in the target area by contracted university students \nor NGO partners, (iii) the results of the survey are evaluated to determine eligibility, (iv) a list of \neligible households is provided to the local LSC for validation, and (v) those found eligible will be \nprovided with food stamps. Approach 3 will be administered in selected geographic areas with a \nsample  size  of  10,000  beneficiaries  and  will  expand  nationwide  incrementally.  It  is  envisaged \nthat approach 3 will start during the first semester of 2009 to give time for the development of \nthe household assessment survey instruments.  \n \n55. \nThe pilot testing of both approach 2 and approach 3 will be concurrently evaluated by 30 \nJune 2010, after which the household assessment survey instruments will be refined based on \nthe  results  of  the  pilot  testing.  The  refined  survey  instruments  and  best  practices  from  the \napproaches  will  be  incorporated  into  the  final  design  to  be  used  for  scaling  up  to  50,000 \nbeneficiaries in 2010 and a further 20,000 beneficiaries in 2011.  \n \n\nb. \n\nOutput 2: A Mechanism for Delivering Food Stamps in Mongolia is \nEstablished \n\n \nThe  mechanism  for  delivering  food  stamps  involves  five  interconnected  stages:  (i) \n56. \nbeneficiaries are identified, (ii) food stamps are distributed, (iii) beneficiaries receive the stamps, \n(iv)  shopkeepers 55  get  paid  with  stamps,  and  (v)  banks  receive  the  stamps.  In  stage  (i), \nbeneficiaries  are  identified  using  the  targeting methodologies  outlined above  (approach  2  or  3 \nduring pilot testing and the refined outreach approach after pilot testing). Targeted beneficiaries \n\n                                                 \n51 The criteria for the selection of NGOs (and other civil society groups) and identification of appropriate checks and \n\nbalances will be outlined in the operational guidelines. \n\n52 The use of the term \u201cinnovative\u201d is justified because the food stamp program represents the first attempt to select \nbeneficiaries of social assistance through the use of a targeting mechanism which seeks to identify the poor and \nincludes independent household assessment (use of civil society groups). \n\n53 The  main  basis  for  eligibility  will  be  the  result  of  the  household  assessment  which  will  identify  poverty  and  not  a \ncategory  of vulnerability. Some households  already receiving social  welfare assistance  will still be eligible for the \nfood stamps. This methodology  will assist in identifying  particularly  at-risk households such as households in the \nperi-urban areas headed by women.   \n\n54  The  household  assessment  form  will  be  developed  using  previous  experiences  in  Mongolia  with  technical \n\nassistance from an international targeting expert. \n\n55 The  poverty  and  social  assessment  identified  that  wholesale  market  sellers  are  an  important  source  of  cheap \nfoodstuffs for poor families. Efforts will be made by the Program to include these sellers in the food stamp program. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nwill sign the terms and conditions for receiving the food stamps.56 The list and information about \nthe  beneficiaries  will  be  kept in  a  central  database.  A  printing  company  capable  of printing  on \nsecure paper will be contracted to print the stamps. A contracted institution (bank or post office \npreferably) will be responsible for delivering the stamps to the beneficiaries in stage (ii). When \nbeneficiaries receive the food stamps in stage (iii), they can then buy food from the contracted \nshopkeepers (food sellers) using the stamps. The shopkeepers who receive the stamps in stage \n(iv)  will  then  submit  the  stamps  to  the  contracted  bank.  In  stage  (v),  the  contracted  bank  will \nreplace the shopkeeper\u2019s collected food stamps with cash and submit all of the collected stamps \nto the central bank for liquidation.   \n \n57. \nThe  five  stages  will  be  closely  monitored  during  the  pilot  testing  to  identify  and \nimmediately  resolve  bottlenecks,  issues,  and  problems  in  the  system.  The  pilot  testing  will  be \nevaluated  together  with  the  targeting  approaches,  and  adjustments  will  be  made  in  the  final \nmechanism  to  be  used  for  food  stamp  program  expansion.  The  activities  of  component  1  are \ndescribed in further detail in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n2. \n\nImportant Features \n\n \n58.  Modeling a Targeting Strategy. The Program will make use of an innovative targeting \nstrategy which will (i) first utilize the existing MSWL lists of beneficiaries that focus on categories \nin  the  population  (e.g.,  elderly  persons  and  persons  with  a  disability),  (ii)  update  these  lists \nthrough validation and verification by a contracted third party (e.g., an NGO), (iii) administer an \nimproved proxy means test to the beneficiaries in the updated list, (iv) validate the LSC, and (v) \ndeliver the food stamps to those identified as poor households based on the results of the proxy \nmeans  test.  Targeting  poor  households  for  the  food  stamp  program  is  the  most  important \nfeature of the Program because (i) it provides a major step towards solving the prevailing issues \nin  the  social  welfare  sector,  and  (ii)  it  will  demonstrate  to  the  Government  the  impact  and \neffectiveness  of  targeting  in  making  significant  improvements  in  the  social  welfare  sector.  As \nregistration  of  nomadic  persons  is  effective  in  rural  Mongolia  (soums  are  the  administrative \nanchors for rural households), the systematic household assessment will capture rural herders, \nalbeit  at  a  higher  administrative  cost.  Through  systematic  household  assessments  within \n\u201cpockets  of  poverty\",  the  unregistered  urban  poor  will  also  be  captured  by  the  food  stamp \nprogram. The operational guidelines for the food stamp program will outline the procedures for \noutreach  in greater  detail.  This  strategy  will  be  strongly  reinforced  through  expert  inputs  to  be \nprovided through the Project grant. \n \nIncreasing  the  Capacity  of  the  Livelihood  Support  Councils.  The  program, \n59. \nespecially  during  its  final  stages,  will  make  use  of  the  LSCs  in  validating  beneficiary  selection \nand identification, as well as in serving as a venue for raising appeals and grievances related to \nbeneficiary selection. Training and other capacity-development activities will be provided to the \nLSCs. Expert inputs will be provided through the Project as necessary. \n \n60. \nPartnering  with  Civil  Society  Organizations  and  the  Private  Sector.  The  Program \nrecognizes the potential contributions that civil society organizations and the private sector can \nprovide. It will outsource different functions within the safety net to universities, NGOs, and the \nprivate sector to gain efficiency and augment the capacity of local social workers in areas where \ncivil  society  organizations  have  particular  expertise  and  resources  (e.g.,  targeting  and \n\n                                                 \n56 The terms and conditions include a provision that the food stamps will be used for food, excluding food items on a \n\nnegative list (e.g., alcohol and cigarettes). \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nverification  of  beneficiary  eligibility,  actual  delivery,  monitoring,  community  mobilization,  and \nadvocacy).   \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n61. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $9.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources. The counterpart funds generated from the grant proceeds will be allocated to MSWL \nfor the implementation of the Program. The terms and conditions for the grant will be as set forth \nin  the  draft  Grant  Agreement.  The  Government  has  allocated  MNT80  million  in  its  2008 \namended budget and plans to allocate at least MNT10 billion in the 2009 budget to fund food \nsafety net program-related activities. Indicative program budget requirements for 2010 and 2011 \nhave  been  discussed  with  the  Government  for  inclusion  in  the  Government  budget  for  these \nyears. \n \n\n4. \n\nProgram Cost \n\n \nProgram implementation will involve short-term adjustment costs to fund the food stamp \n62. \nprogram  and  this  will  be  financed  by  counterpart  funds.  The  support  needed  for  the  social \nprotection  system  reform  will  require  incremental  costs  estimated  at  $5.0  million  equivalent \nrelated  to  sustained  staff  development,  improved  targeting  mechanisms,  salaries  of  additional \nsocial  work  staff  at  soum  and  khoroo  level,  TA  for  social  protection  system  improvement, \nmanagement information system development, M&E, supervision, and advocacy.  \n \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n63. \nProgram  Management.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency \n(EA)  with  overall  responsibility  for  the  implementation  and  coordination  of  activities  with  other \npartners. A multisectoral Steering Committee composed of senior level officials of (i) MOF; (ii) \nMSWL, with such official serving as the vice chair; (iii) Ministry of Health; (iv) MOFA; (v) National \nStatistics  Office  (NSO);  (vi)  Mongolian  Employers  Federation;  (vii)  Association  of  Elderly \nPersons; (viii) the agencies responsible for the distribution of food stamps; (ix) UNICEF; (x) an \nNGO  engaged  in  food  security  programs;  and  (xi)  ADB  as  observer,  shall  be  established  and \nshall  meet  quarterly  to  provide  policy  and  strategic  guidance  to  the  Program.  The  Steering \nCommittee shall be chaired by the head of the subprogram to the Food II Plan of the Recipient. \nAn English language version of the minutes of Steering Committee meetings shall be forwarded \nto ADB on a quarterly basis.  \n \n64.  MSWL  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  for  the  Program  and  will  be  the  primary \nresponsible unit for delivering the expected results of the Program. A program implementation \nunit  (PIU)  with  contracted  staff  will  be  established  within  MSWL  to  facilitate  administrative, \nfinancial, and procurement matters, and serve as the secretariat to the Steering Committee. The \nPIU  will  closely  consult  with  relevant  ministries,  agencies,  and  international  partners.  It  will  be \nheaded by a qualified program manager selected on a competitive basis. The PIU will comprise \nfour  staff,  including  an  administration  and  finance  officer,  secretary,  and  driver  for  the  entire \nimplementation period of the FNSWPP. MSWL will organize a local structure to ensure effective \nfood stamp implementation locally. \n \n65. \nThe PIU  will submit consolidated quarterly progress reports to ADB (in  English) and to \nthe Steering Committee and MSWL on all aspects of program implementation. The reports will \ninclude  details  on  overall  implementation  progress,  including  summary  financial  information \n(receipts  and  disbursements),  problems  encountered  during  the  reporting  period,  measures \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ntaken  or  proposed  to  be  taken  to  remedy  these  problems,  and  the  proposed  program  of \nactivities  for  the  following  quarter.  The  reports  will  also  include  an  assessment  of  the \nimplementation  of  the  food  stamp  program,  following  monitoring  indicators  included  in  the \noperations guidelines of the program. A pilot testing completion report will be submitted to ADB \nwithin 1 month of completion of approach 2 and approach 3. Within 3 months of completion of \nthe  FNSWPP,  the  PIU  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB,  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB,  an \nFNSWPP completion report on (i) the utilization and impact of the grants, including a statement \nof expenditures; (ii) performance of the FNSWPP; (iii) economic and social benefits generated; \nand (iv) details about implementation, costs, and other information requested by ADB.  \n \n66. \nA food stamp operating unit (FSOU) will be immediately established within the PIU to (i) \ncarefully but rapidly provide the technical requirements of operating a food stamp program; (ii) \naugment  the  capacity  of  the  Government  to  immediately  undertake  setting-up  activities \nnecessary  for  delivering  food  stamps,  such  as  ensuring  proper  targeting  of  the  poor,  quality \nprinting  and  reproduction  of  the  stamps,  timely  and  orderly  delivery  of  the  stamps  to  the \nbeneficiaries, and proper contracting with the major operators in the system (post office, banks, \nprinters,  and  shopkeepers);  (iii)  provide  TA  to  the  MSWL  office  and  LSWO  personnel  at  the \ndistricts  and  aimags  as  well  as  soums  and  khoroos;  (iv)  provide  troubleshooting  assistance  in \ncase  problems  arise  in  the  system;  and  (v)  provide  technical  support  to  consultants  to  be \ndeployed  through  the  Project.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  immediately  start  the  selection \nand hiring process for the national experts who will become part of the FSOU. It is envisaged \nthat the FSOU will be in place before the end of November 2008. \n \n67. \nSafeguards to prevent leakage and corrupt behavior surrounding the implementation of \nthe  food  stamp  program  will  be  implemented.  The  grants  will  address  these  issues  through \nvarious  means:  (i)  providing  detailed  implementation  guidelines  (i.e.,  food  stamp  operational \nguidelines); (ii) carrying out capacity-development measures at various levels; (iii) implementing \na  communication  campaign  to  inform  the  public  and  ensure  transparent  implementation;  (iv) \nsigning  contracts  with  printers,  food  stamp  distributors,  and  shopkeepers,  which  include \nsanctions for misbehavior; (v) strengthening targeting strategies to minimize food stamps being \ndistributed to ineligible beneficiaries; (vi) implementing independent M&E; and (vii) broadening \nthe  scope  of  the  audit  to  include  auditing  of  food  stamp  program  operations.  The  grants  will \nutilize existing effective delivery mechanisms and institutions and will enhance their capacity as \nappropriate.  Local  governments,  particularly  at  the  aimag  and  soum  or  khoroo  levels,  and  the \nsoum or khoroo LSCs, will be involved in the preparation and implementation of the food stamp \nprogram. Intersector coordination will be assured by the Steering Committee at the central level. \nImplementation arrangements are discussed in further detail in Appendix 4. \n \n68. \nPeriod  of  Implementation.  The  duration  of  component  1  is  36  months.  It  will  be \ncompleted  by  31  December  2011.  The  grants  implementation  schedule  is  in  Appendix  5.  A \ndetailed implementation schedule is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n69. \nProcurement.  All  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  Program  grant  will  be  carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). In \naccordance with the simplified disbursement and procurement procedure for program loans, the \ngrant proceeds may be utilized to procure goods and services (excluding local duties and taxes) \nother than (i) those specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 6) produced in and procured \nfrom  ADB  member  countries,  (ii)  those  financed  by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  official \nsources, and (iii) imports from non-ADB member countries. All procurements under the Program \n(component 1) will be made through normal commercial practices for the private sector or the \nGovernment\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  due  consideration \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nCounterpart  Funds.  Counterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  short-term \n\ngiven to economy and efficiency. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds \nand  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government  certification.  The  procurement  plan  is  attached  in \nAppendix 7. \n \nConsulting  Services.  The  FSOU  will  consist  of  seven  national  consultants,  to  be \n70. \nheaded  by  a  team  leader  and  to  be  complemented  by  intermittent  assistance  from  an \ninternational targeting specialist (2 person-months). The FSOU will be lodged within the PIU and \nwill  establish  and  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the  food  stamp  program.  A  total  of  254 \nperson-months  of  consulting  inputs  will  be  provided  by  these  consultants  over  3  years.  The \nGovernment  will  hire  the  seven  national  consultants  and  the  international  targeting  specialist \nbefore starting the Program indicatively from October 2008 to prepare for the implementation of \ncomponent  1  (21  person-months  of  national  and  2  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices). All of the consultants mentioned will be hired and financed by the Government under \nthe Program. \n \n71. \nadjustment costs under component 1. \n \n72.  Monitoring  and  Tranching.  Funding  of  component  1  will  be  released  to  the \nGovernment  in  a  single  payment  of  $9  million  following  grant  effectiveness,  including \nsatisfaction of all policy actions in the policy matrix as confirmed in the development policy letter \n(Appendix 8). \n \n73. \nProgram  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  System.  The  implementation  of \nthe food assistance safety nets will be monitored and evaluated by MSWL, with the participation \nof  MOF,  supported  by  independent  external  monitoring  to  be  funded  under  the  Project. \nMonitoring  will  include  operational  performance  and  outcome  indicators  of  the  food  safety  net \nprogram  as  per  the  operational  guidelines,  and  indicators  of  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework.  Impact  evaluation  is  conditional  on  the  feasibility  of  collecting  data  on  the  food \nstamp  program  through  the  national  socioeconomic  household  survey,  the  likely  sample  size, \nand cost considerations. The monitoring of households57 affected by soaring food prices will be \nassessed  on  a  regular  basis  by  government  mechanisms  and  supported  by  consultants  hired \nunder  the  Project.  The  Government  monitoring  capacity  and  systems  (especially  those  of \nMSWL)  will  be  supported  during  implementation  of  the  Program  to  ensure  full  monitoring \ncapacity of the Government after the Program. \n\n \n\nProgram Review. ADB will conduct review missions jointly with the Government at least \n74. \ntwice  a  year  to  identify  issues  and  constraints,  determine  necessary  remedial  actions  and \nadjustments, and advise on actions required to keep the  Program on course. The joint review \nmissions will review coordination and collaboration with other ongoing programs related to food \nsecurity  and  nutrition.  To  encourage  a  policy  dialogue  approach  to  the  review  process,  the \ncentral government, local governments, and ADB will also conduct a joint midterm review of the \nProgram within 18 months of commencement of Program implementation.  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n57 Where relevant, data will be disaggregated by sex, thereby facilitating gender analysis of impacts and supporting \nchanges in program design and implementation. The Gender Action Plan in Appendix 11 outlines indicators to be \ntracked. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT \n\nComponent 2: Capacity Development and Communication Strategy \n\n \nA. \n \nComponent 2 will provide the capacity development inputs and communication strategy \n75. \nfor  both  the  pilot-testing  and  the  regular  implementation  of  the  food  stamp  program.  The \nfollowing are the outputs of component 2:  \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Capacity Development Activities Implemented   \n\n \n76. \nThe Project will undertake capacity development in two stages: (i) capacity development \nfor the pilot-testing of the food stamp program, and (ii) capacity development for delivering the \nexpanded  food  stamp  program  and  other  social  welfare  services.  The  first  stage  will  provide \ntraining  to  all  groups  involved  in  identifying  beneficiaries  and  delivering  the  food  stamps.  This \nwill  include  the  validators  for  the  data  generated  by  approach  2,  surveyors  for  approach  3, \nLSCs, shopkeepers, social welfare officers (SWOs) in pilot areas as well as in the aimags and \ndistricts, and key officers in MSWL, LSWO and MOF. The second stage will provide training and \ncapacity development for the LSCs, SWOs, and key officers of MSWL, LSWO and MOF on the \nfinal design and mechanisms of the food stamp program to be used for expansion of coverage. \nOther  capacity  development  topics  will  include  (i)  impact  studies,  baseline  data  and  impact \nmethodologies; (ii) targeting; (iii) M&E; (iv) costing of social welfare reforms and programs; (v) \ncivil registration; and (vi) early warning, mitigation, and response mechanisms. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Communication Strategy Developed and Implemented \n\n \n77. \nThe  Project  will  identify  and  contract  a  Mongolian  consulting  firm  to  (i)  design  the \ncommunication plan for the Program centered on poor households and vulnerable populations, \nsocial  workers,  local  government,  and  national  stakeholders;  (ii)  develop  and  pilot-test  the \ninformation,  education,  and  communication  (IEC)  materials  and  media  for  the  communication \nplan; (iii) implement the communication plan in collaboration with the PIU, MSWL, the Steering \nCommittee and MOF; (iv) provide TA to MSWL in the conduct of awareness-raising activities on \nsocial  benefits;  and  (v)  make  recommendations  and  undertake  measures  for  institutionalizing \nthe  communication  strategy.  The  communication  strategy  will  target  all  stakeholders  and \npromote public awareness58 about the rationale for the Program, targeting criteria, and agreed \ndelivery mechanisms. Details of this component are described in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nB. \n \n78. \n \n\nComponent 3: Strengthening Social Welfare Strategies and Systems \n\nThe following are the outputs of component 3:  \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Effective Food Crisis Response \n\n \n79. \nSubcomponent 3.1 will provide expert technical analysis of capacity development needs \nto  promote  an  effective  food  crisis  response.  The  areas  for  technical  analyses  are  (i) \nstrengthening  the  decentralized  social  welfare  institutional  structure  under  the  food  stamp \nprogram;  (ii)  measuring  and  analyzing  impacts  of  the  soaring  food  prices  on  the  poor;  (iii) \n\n                                                 \n58 The  communication  strategy  will  also  particularly  target  women  at  the  community  level.  The  poverty  and  social \nassessment found that women are primarily responsible for household food budgets and shopping. As the primary \nusers  of  food  stamps,  they  will  be  an  important  audience  for  education  and  outreach  in  the  communication \nstrategy. \n\n\f \n\n19\n\ntargeting  mechanisms  for  food  assistance  benefits  and  other  social  welfare  programs;  (iv) \nexternal  M&E  of  the  implementation  of  the  food  assistance  safety  nets;  and  (v)  community-\nbased  approaches  to  ensuring  household  food  security,  particularly  in  the  urban  sector.  For \npoint (v), the Project will make available at least 40 small community grants (of up to $3,000) to \nbe  administered  by  an  experienced  NGO  (reporting  to  the  PIU)  to  support  and  develop  best \npractices  in  community-based  approaches  to  ensuring  household  food  security.  These  grants \nwill target poor households, and particularly women, by supporting the establishment of kitchen \ngardens,  community  greenhouses,  nutritional  education  programs,  and  other  innovative \nhousehold food security measures. Grant eligibility criteria will include community involvement, \ndesign of a sustainability plan, and identification of at least 10% of in-kind contribution. Further \ndetails on the implementation arrangements are in Appendix 4. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: A Package of Reform of Social Welfare Strategies \n\n \n80. \nSubcomponent 3.2 will provide technical analysis of social welfare strategies and deliver \na  set  of  proposals  for  (i)  policy  discussion,  (ii)  a  legislative  agenda,  and  (iii)  medium-  to  long-\nterm  policy  reform.  The  technical  analyses  will  focus  on  (i)  social  welfare  benefits  impact \nanalysis,  (ii)  effective  M&E  of  social  welfare  programs,  (iii)  social  welfare  expenditure  and \nfiduciary  and  fiscal  sustainability  analysis  of  social  welfare  programs,  (iv)  facilitating  the  civil \nregistration  system  through  incentives,  and  (v)  developing  a  knowledge  product  on  social \nwelfare institutional reforms and capacity development. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: An Early Warning and Response System to Social Shocks  \n\nImportant Features \n\n \nSubcomponent  3.3  will  provide  technical  analysis  and  support  for  establishing  and \n81. \nimproving  systems  and  mechanisms  for  early  detection  and  mitigation  of  food  and  nutrition-\nrelated  emergencies  and  for  undertaking  rapid  responses  to  the  effects  and  social  shocks  of \nfood  crises  and  similar  emergencies.  The  subcomponent  will  carry  out  an  inventory  of \nMongolian  initiatives  on  early  warning  systems,  improve  existing  food  and  nutrition  monitoring \nand  surveillance  systems,  and  establish  packages  and  mechanisms  (including  funding)  for \nimmediate  responses  to  similar  emergencies  (such  as  dzuds,  drought,  and  national  disaster). \nThe activities in this component are described in further detail in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nC. \n \n82. \nSocial Expenditure and Fiscal Sustainability Analysis of Social Welfare Programs. \nThe  study  and  resulting  capacity  within  MSWL  and  MOF  to  undertake  social  expenditure  and \nfiscal  sustainability  analysis  is  expected  to  have  longer-term  policy  implications  in  Mongolia. \nHaving  a  study  and  the  capacity  within  the  Government  to  undertake  social  expenditure  and \nfiscal sustainability analysis is expected to inform policy makers on the risks and implications of \nuniversal assistance in relation to Mongolia\u2019s fiscal balance and sustainability. It will also further \nemphasize the need for focusing and targeting any further social welfare assistance. \n \n83. \nEarly  Warning,  Mitigation,  and  Response  System  for  Social  Shocks. The need for \nthis  system  is  recognized  by  the  Government  as  a  priority  and  is  acknowledgement  of \nMongolia\u2019s susceptibility to food price shocks. The establishment of an early warning, mitigation, \nand  response  system  is  consistent  with,  and  supportive  of,  the  objectives  and  activities  of  the \nproposed  Food  II  Program.  Close  coordination  and  collaboration  will  be  undertaken  with  the \nMOFA and all relevant agencies in establishing these systems in order to consolidate and avoid \nduplication of efforts. \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n84.  Medium-  to  Long-Term  Institutional  Reform  and  Capacity  Development.  The \nProject  builds  on  the  gains  of  the  ADB-supported  SSSDP  and  takes  advantage  of  the \nexperiences and lessons gained from the targeted food safety program in component 1. It also \nmaximizes the results of the broad range of expert technical inputs from components 2 and 3 by \nconsolidating  them  into  specific  proposals  for  medium-  to  long-term  social  welfare  institutional \nreforms  and  capacity  development  in  the  social  welfare  sector  for  policy  discussion  with  the \nhighest levels of Government. This important feature strongly binds all the FNSWPP inputs, fills \npotential gaps in implementation, and promotes sustainability of FNSWPP impacts. \n \nD. \n \n85. \nprice contingencies, taxes, and duties. A summary of cost estimates is in Table 1.  \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $3.33  million  equivalent,  including  physical  and \n\nProject Costs \n\n \nTable 1: Project Costs \n($ \u2018000) \n\nAmountsa, b \n\n \n\nItem \nA.

The Project will have the same EA, IA, steering committee, and \nPIU  as  that  of  the  Program  (paras.  63\u201367).  The  PIU  will  facilitate  all  administrative,  financial, \nand procurement matters related to the Project. Further details on implementation arrangements \nare described in Appendix 4.  \n \n\n88. \nPeriod of Implementation. The project duration is 36 months. It will be completed by 31 \nDecember  2011  and  closed  on  30  June  2012. More  details  on  the  time  frame  are provided  in \nthe implementation schedule (Appendix 5) and Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n89. \nProcurement. All procurement to be financed under the project grant will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Procurement under the Project will include \none  vehicle  for  the  PIU  and  FSOU.  MSWL,  in  charge  of  procurement  activities  of  goods  and \nconsultant  services,  is  currently  implementing  two  ADB  loans 59  and  has  had  previous \nexperience with several TA and grant projects. Key PIU staff will undergo procurement training \nas needed. \n \n90. \nConsulting  Services.  The  Project  will  require  a  total  of  43  person-months  of \ninternational  and  76  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  financed  under  the  project \ngrant, divided into six consultant packages as follows:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nPackage  1:  Communication  strategy;  national  IEC  development  specialist  (4 \nperson-months).  \nPackage  2:  External  monitoring;  national  poverty  specialist  (3  person-months) \nand national food and nutrition specialist (3 person-months).  \nPackage 3: Household food security; national community development specialist \n(6 person-months).  \nPackage  4:  Monitoring  and  evaluation;  national  economist  (5  person-months), \ninternational  poverty  impact  analyst  (3  person-months),  national  food  and \nnutrition  specialist  (2  person-months),  international  qualitative  assessment \nspecialist  (2  person-months),  international  social  welfare  specialist  (3  person-\nmonths),  international  poverty  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist  (3  person-\nmonths),  national  social  welfare  specialist  (6  person-months),  national  social \nresearcher-analyst  (30  person-months),  international  social  sector  monitoring \nand  evaluation  specialist  (2  person-months),  national  monitoring  and  evaluation \nspecialist (3 person-months), international food and nutrition specialist (2 person-\nmonths),  international  preparedness  specialist  (1  person-month),  international \ninstitutional  capacity  building  specialist  (2  person-months),  international  safety \nnet specialist (1 person-month), national safety net specialist (2 person-months), \nand international monitoring and evaluation specialist (2 person-months).  \nPackage  5: \ninstitutional  capacity \ndevelopment specialist (2 person-months), international social welfare and safety \nnets  specialist  (1  person-months),  national  social  welfare  specialist  (4  person-\nmonths),  international  social  safety  net  targeting  specialist  (12  person-months), \ninternational  macro-fiscal  policy  and  public  financial  management  specialist  (2 \nperson-months),  national  macro-fiscal  policy  and  public  finance  management \nspecialist  (2  person-months),  international  civil  registration  expert  (1  person-\n\nInstitutional  development; \n\ninternational \n\n                                                 \n59  Loan  1836-MON:  Social  Security  Development  Project  and  Loan  1837-MON:  Social  Security  Development \n\nProgram. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nmonths),  national  civil  registration  expert  (2  person-months),  international  social \nwelfare specialist (2 person-months), national social welfare specialist (4 person-\nmonths),  and    international  development  communication  specialist  (2  person-\nmonths).  \nPackage 6: National household survey data collection and management. \n\n(vi) \n\n \n91. \nThe Government requested advance contracting for the recruitment of consultants. The \nconsultants will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The entities for packages 1, 2, and 3 will be \nhired through consultant qualification selection using biodata proposal. Quality- and cost-based \nselection procedure using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 will be applied for the recruitment of the \nentities  for packages  4  and  5.  The  NSO  is  the  only  national  organization  in  Mongolia  with  the \nnecessary competence to meet the requirements under package 6, and it will be hired through \nsingle  source  selection.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n \nAnticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \n92. \nexplained to and discussed with the Government and MOF. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices \nrelating  to  the  FNSWPP.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  the  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  grant  regulations  and  bidding  documents  for  the  FNSWPP.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MSWL and MOF \nand  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the \nFNSWPP. \n \n93. \nIn Transparency International\u2019s 2007 corruption perception index, Mongolia ranks 100th \n(93rd  in  2006),  which  is  typical  of  countries  with  high  levels  of  corruption.  However,  efforts  to \npromote governance and accountability and to combat corruption are accelerating in Mongolia. \nThe  Independent  Authority  Against  Corruption  (IAAC)  was  set  up  in  2006,  and  commenced \ninvestigations upon ratification of the Criminal Procedures Code Amendments in August 2007. \nThe  Anti-Corruption  Law  guarantees  the  independence  and  authority  of  the  IAAC  and \ninvestigations  of  senior,  mid-ranking  and  junior  officials  have  led  to  convictions.  A  sector  risk \nassessment  under  the  Governance  and  Anti-Corruption  Program  II  guidelines  was  recently \ncarried out for Mongolia by the Asia Foundation for national systems as well as the education \nand  urban  transport  sectors  in  the  areas  of  public  finance  management,  procurement,  and \nanticorruption.  Regarding  public  finance  management  and  procurement  systems,  the  report \nidentifies weaknesses, particularly in internal control and all stages of the procurement process, \nfor both the national systems and in the two sectors and relevant line ministries. ADB will assist \nin putting mitigation measures in place to improve internal control and the procurement process. \nThe  World  Bank  is  introducing  program-based  medium-term  budgeting,  and  the  International \nMonetary Fund is considering assistance for legal and budgetary reforms. \n \nDisbursement  Arrangements.  The  project  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with \n94. \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite \nproject implementation through timely release of grant proceeds, the Government will establish \nan  imprest  account  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB,  which  will  be  administered  by \nMSWL. Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal \napplication  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will  demonstrate,  among  other \nthings,  that  the  goods  and/or  services  are  (i)  procured  from  ADB  member  countries,  and  (ii) \n\n\f \n\n23\n\neligible  for  ADB  financing.  The  initial  and  maximum  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest \naccount will not exceed 10% of the Project grant amount or equivalent of 6 months\u2019 estimated \nexpenditure,  whichever  is  lower.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  to \nreimburse, liquidate, or replenish eligible expenditures that do not exceed $50,000 per individual \npayment. \n \n95. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  Government,  through  the  PIU,  will  (i) \nmaintain  separate  financial  accounts  for  the  Project,  and  (ii)  have  such  accounts  and  related \nfinancial statements audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB in accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  the  Grant  Agreement  and  as  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  financial  reporting  and \nauditing  standards. 60  The  auditors  should  have  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of \nreference acceptable to ADB. The use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures \nwill  also  be  part  of  the  annual  audit  and  a  separate  audit  opinion  will  be  submitted.  The \nGovernment  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  (in  English)  of  such  audited  accounts  and \nfinancial  statements,  as  well  as  the  related  reports  of  the  auditors,  within  6  months  after  the \nclose of each fiscal year. The Government was advised that ADB requires timely submission of \naudited projects accounts and financial statements and that it will suspend disbursements of the \nproposed ADB grant in case of noncompliance with the requirement. \n \n96. \nFor  the  purpose  of  complying  with  the  requirements  for  the  annual  audited  financial \nstatements, the proceeds of this grant may be used to finance expenditures for preparation of \nfinancial statements, sector auditors, and translations of auditor\u2019s reports into English.  \n \n97. \nProject  Performance  Monitoring  System.  The  PIU  will  monitor  the  Project  along  the \nprogram  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  described  in  para.  73.  Performance \nindicators are set out in the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n98. \n \n\nProject Review. Reviews as described in para. 74 will also cover Project activities. \n\nV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\n \nA. \n \n99. \nTargeted  Safety  Net.  The  FNSWPP  will  provide  assistance  to  the  Government  for \ndelivering targeted safety nets to the poor and vulnerable when the need is most urgent and the \nGovernment is still struggling to determine who and where these most needy populations are. \nThe  short-term,  well-coordinated,  and  targeted  safety  net  program  (i.e.,  focused  on  mitigating \nthe impacts of food prices and identifying vulnerable households) will provide direct support to \nthe most needy at a substantially lower cost than the usual broad-based actions undertaken by \nthe Government. The quick disbursing nature of the Program will ensure that the assistance will \nbe provided in a timely manner to the targeted beneficiaries. \n \n100.  Greater Social Impact and Fiscal Sustainability of Social Safety Nets and Welfare \nAssistance. The FNSWPP responds to soaring food prices by delivering a safety net program \nthat builds on existing structures, resources, and capacity, then uses the FNSWPP to learn and \nultimately  integrate  good  practices  into  the  existing  social  welfare  system.  In  doing  so,  the \ngrants  will  have  short-term  direct  impacts  on  poor  and  vulnerable  populations,  a  long-term \nindirect impact on social policy and the social welfare system, and direct impacts on the overall \npopulation. \n\n                                                 \n60 ADB. 1989. Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nImpacts \n\n \n101.  Harmonization of Development Efforts. The FNSWPP\u2019s deliberate effort to harmonize \nits interventions with other international efforts (e.g., those of UNDP and the World Bank), the \nGovernment\u2019s broader plans and programs (e.g., the Food II Program), and other international \norganizations\u2019  projects  and  activities  (e.g.,  UNICEF\u2019s  Nutrition  Monitoring  System),  directly \nbenefit the Government in terms of savings from preventing duplication of efforts and ensuring \nefficiency of programs related to food security. \n \nImproved  Local  Capacity.  The  FNSWPP\u2019s  emphasis  on improving  capacities of  local \n102. \ngovernments  and  LSCs  to  deliver  targeted  safety  nets  and  social  welfare  assistance \ndistinguishes  it  from  most  national  programs  that  have  laudable  objectives  but  fail  to  consider \nlimitations and/or absorptive and carrying capacities of the local bodies. This emphasis directly \nbenefits local social workers, LSCs, governors, and local leaders with better skills and improved \nresources, which will immediately benefit poor and vulnerable populations in terms of effective \nand timely assistance. \n \n103.  Civil  Society  Participation.  The  FNSWPP  recognizes  civil  society\u2019s  potential \ncontributions  to  it.  Deliberate  efforts  to  mobilize  civil  society  participation  in  appropriate \ncomponents  (i)  promotes  increased  program  efficiency,  (ii)  directly  benefits  local  government \nbodies in terms of additional resources, and (iii) benefits the vulnerable populations in terms of \nstronger voice and advocacy for more equitable assistance from the Government. \n \nB. \n \n104.  Poverty Reduction and Social Impact. The Program will protect at least 100,000 poor \nand vulnerable households from the risk of malnutrition and from sliding deeper into poverty by \nproviding a targeted safety net using food stamps. In the longer term the Program will contribute \nto  mitigating  the  impact  of  the  food  price  increases  and  reaching  nonincome  MDGs. \nTransparent and more effective systems and capacities will reduce opportunities for corruption. \nIncreased knowledge on rights and benefits among poor and unregistered people and improved \ncivil registration will promote the rights of migrants and unregistered populations, and contribute \nto poverty reduction and reducing social problems in urban areas. The training and awareness-\nraising activities of the community grants program that accompanies the safety nets will improve \nknowledge  and  practices  in  proper  nutrition  and  promote  household  food  security  and  self-\nsufficiency among poor and vulnerable populations. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy  is  in  Appendix  10,  and  the  poverty  and  social  assessment  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n \n105.  Gender  Impact.  Because  women  are  the  most  likely  users  of  the  food  stamps,61 they \nwill  (i)  increase  their  ability  to  balance  the  household  budget  and  provide  adequate  nutritional \nintake for their families, (ii) gain increased awareness on benefits and rights through appropriate \nIEC  materials  and  strategies,  (iii)  participate  in  household  economic  activities,  and  (iv)  be \ninvolved  in  community  concerns  and  activities.  Community-based  activities  that  promote  food \nsecurity  (e.g.,  kitchen  gardens,  small  vegetable  farming,  and  nutritional  meals  training)  will \ninvolve  parents,  especially  mothers,  in  (i)  identifying  and  prioritizing  their  needs,  (ii)  planning \ncommunity projects that respond to their needs, (iii) participating in training activities related to \nthese projects, and (iv) implementing these activities together with their peers. A gender action \nplan has been prepared for the Project with the intention of maximizing opportunities for gender \n\n                                                 \n61 This  was  confirmed  by  the  rapid  qualitative  assessments  during  consultation.  Women  are  generally  the  ones \n\nclaiming and budgeting benefits received from the Government. \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nimpact  in  design  and  implementation  and  providing  adequate  data  for  M&E  of  the  FNSWPP. \nThe gender action plan is in Appendix 11. \n \n106. \nInstitutional  Impact.  Government  institutions,  particularly  MSWL,  the  provincial  and \ndistrict  soum  and  khoroo  governors,  local  social  workers,  and  LSCs  will  gain  increased \ncapacities  for  (i)  delivering  services;  (ii)  generating  and  analyzing  data  in  aid  of  policy  and \nprogram  development;  and  (iii)  establishing  packages  and  mechanisms  for  anticipating, \nmitigating, and responding to food crises and similar situations. The FNSWPP will also promote \n(i)  better  ways  of  identifying  and  targeting  beneficiaries,  which  is  a  crucial  factor  in  ensuring \nprogram effectiveness and efficiency; (ii) more accurate and reliable data through improved data \nmanagement, analysis, and evaluation; (iii) improved M&E, which feeds back into more effective \nprogram  planning;  (iv)  stronger  participation  of  the  community,  local  government,  and  LSCs; \nand  (v)  more  effective  coordination  and  communication  strategies  among  stakeholders. \nGovernment  ministries  will  be  better  equipped  with  analytical  tools  and  methodologies  to \ndevelop  and  implement  more  focused  and  responsive  policies  and  programs.  Civil  society \norganizations will play a more active role in delivering social welfare services. Established early \ndetection,  mitigation,  and  response  mechanisms  and  packages  improve  the  preparedness  of \ngovernment  agencies  for  rapid  deployment  in  the  event  of  another  food  crisis  or  similar \nemergency. \n \n107.  Economic and Financial Impacts. The FNSWPP will improve food security for at least \n100,000  households,  preventing  them  from  sliding  deeper  into  poverty.  In  order  to  assess  the \neconomic  viability  and  efficiency  of  the  investment  under  the  Project,  economic  benefits  and \ncosts  were  identified  and  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  over  20  years  was \nestimated.  \n \n108.  The  quantified  economic  benefits  are  cost  savings  consisting  of  reduction  in  out-of-\npocket  household  expenses  resulting  from  avoided  health  costs.  These  may  occur,  based  on \nthe  assumption  that  poor  households  are  more  vulnerable  to  illness  than  nonpoor  because  of \ntheir  poor  living  conditions.  The  analysis  does  not  attempt  to  quantify  all  economic  gains  and \nonly provides conservative estimates based on benefit streams that can be quantified.  \n \n109.  Economic costs were calculated based on the annual program cost disbursements and \nincremental  recurrent  costs.  It  is  assumed  that  for  each  MNT1.0  spent  on  investment,  an \nadditional MNT0.10 per year is spent on maintenance and operation of the new health facilities. \nThe cost of administration of the FNSWPP\u2014including MSWL's cost of administering the grant, \nthe  cost  of  consultants,  and  M&E  of  the  grants\u2014are  also  included  as  components  of  the \nrecurrent  cost.  The  estimated  total  economic  cost  of  the  FNSWPP  at  constant  2008  prices  is \n$18.4 million for 20 years, including both capital and incremental recurrent costs. Financial costs \nare  converted  into  economic  values  based  on  a  standard  conversion  factor,  using  domestic \nprice numeraire in all program economic cost conversions. \n \n110.  The FNSWPP yields an EIRR of 16.9% and a net present value of MNT11.7 billion. The \nnet present value calculation discounts the cost and benefit streams at 12% in real terms. The \nactual  EIRR  is  likely  to  be  somewhat  higher,  reflecting  positive  externalities  and  longer-term \nintergenerational social benefits that come with improved targeting of social protection services. \nThese benefits may be reflected in education outcomes and quality of life, to which it is difficult \nto assign monetary values. \n \n111.  The  main  investment  of  the  FNSWPP,  the  food  stamp  program,  is  expected  to  have  a \ncost of $9.0 million from ADB resources in 2009, which is equivalent to 0.17% of Government \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\nfor  promoting  household \n\nexpenditure  in  2009.  The  cost  of  the  program  will  be  financed  by  ADB,  with  the  Government \nproviding matching expenditure of about $10 million in 2009 to cover the 100,000 beneficiaries \nduring the Program period. The fiscal burden generated by the new FNSWPP is around 0.32% \nof Government expenditure. The investment plan for the Project is about 0.06% of the annual \nbudget  of  the  social  protection  sector,  while  FNSWPP  recurrent  costs  are  about  0.06%  of  the \n2009  budget  of  MSWL,  decreasing  to  0.01%  in  2011.  The  Government  is  committed  to \nassuming all recurrent costs generated by the FNSWPP. The economic and financial analysis is \nin Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n112.  Sustainability  Impact.  The  FNSWPP  has  built-in  features  to  ensure  sustainability, \nnamely (i) its support to the Government\u2019s subprogram that is a major component of the second \nNational Plan for Food II Program helps promote longer-term food security and nutrition among \nthe  poor  and  vulnerable  populations;  (ii)  improved  MSWL  capacity  in  targeting  and  delivering \nsafety nets helps guarantee sustained social protection for poor households; (iii) strengthened \ncommunity-based  approaches \nfood  security  (e.g.,  community \nvegetable gardens) provides better access of poor households to food in the medium term; (iv) \nincreased awareness among the public on their rights and the benefits offered by MSWL; and \n(v)  continuous  policy  discussion  with  the  highest  levels  of  government  on  social  welfare \ninstitutional  reforms  and  capacity  development  ensures  that  all  institutional  reforms  are \nsustained  and  that  capacities  gained  are  embedded  within  the  government  system,  thus \nensuring sustainability of impact.   \n \nC. \n \n113.  Land  Acquisition  and Resettlement.  The FNSWPP is designed to initiate a response \nto  the  soaring  food  prices  through  the  food  stamp  program.  Therefore,  it  will  not  trigger  any \nresettlement issues. \n \n114.  Ethnic  Minority  Issues.  The  FNSWPP  will  implement  a  national  food  stamp  program \ntargeting  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  has  confirmed \nthat no negative impacts on indigenous peoples will occur.  \n \nD. \n  \n115.  The FNSWPP is classified as category C, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002).  The  short-term  food  subsidy  offered  to  the  vulnerable  segment  of  the  population  will \nincrease  demand  for  the  subsidized  items  that  will  be  met  by  increased  domestic  production, \ngreater imports, higher prices faced by the nonsubsidized population in case of inelastic supply \nresponse,  or  some  combination  of  these  effects.  The  environmental  impact  of  the  adjustment \nwill  then  be  that  of  an  estimated  increase  in  domestic  production,  food  imports,  and  price \nincreases  faced  by  the  nonsubsidized  segment  of  the  Mongolian  population.  The  (most \nrelevant) first category (environmental impacts of greater domestic production attributable to the \ngrant) will be small and the dominant indirect impacts of the grant will be the positive impacts on \nthe  vulnerable  group\u2019s  physical  and  mental  health.  These  positive  impacts  will  comfortably \noutweigh any possible negative indirect environmental impacts, such as those briefly analyzed \nabove.  There  is  no  need  to  conduct  either  an  initial  environmental  examination  or  a  strategic \nenvironmental  assessment  for  the  proposed  FNSWPP.  The  environmental  assessment  is \nattached in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n \n\nEnvironmental Aspect \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nRisks \n\nE. \n \n116.  Political  Risks.  Government  ministries  are  concerned  that  the  plans  and  programs \ndeveloped  to  respond  to  increasing  food  prices  will  have  to  go  through  another  process  of \nreview  and  scrutiny  by  the  new  Government,  thus  causing  delays  to  program  implementation. \nPotential restructuring and changes in leadership of some ministries are also causing concern \namong  those  government  officials  involved  in  developing  this  Program.  The  risks  of  new \ngovernment  officials  not  fully  understanding  the  Program  will  be  mitigated  through  constant \ndialogue  and  consultations  between  ADB  and  its  partners  in  the  Government.  The  Minister  of \nFinance and Minister of Social Welfare and Labor have been informed about the preparation of \nthe assistance. Government officials directly involved in the preparation of the FNSWPP are still \nin place and are expected to remain. The draft law supporting the Program has been submitted \nto the Parliament during the last session of 2008. \n \n117.  Governance  and  Bureaucratic  Risks.  Implementation  of  food  safety  nets  requires  a \nhigh degree of accuracy and synchronization of efforts and activities and is prone to corruption. \nThere is a risk that weak horizontal and vertical coordination will affect program efficiency. This \nwill be especially true if changes occur in senior leadership among implementing ministries. To \nmanage  this  risk,  the  FSOU  will  be  immediately  established  to  ensure  that  technical \nrequirements  of  the  Program  are  given  full  attention  by  the  Government.  Furthermore,  senior \nofficials of all implementing ministries will be invited to an organizational meeting of the Steering \nCommittee  once  the  restructuring  and  changes  within  the  ministries  are  finalized.  Frequent \nSteering Committee meetings and consultations (at least twice a month) will be undertaken by \nthe  EA,  especially  at  Program  start-up,  to  continuously  monitor  progress  and  immediately \nresolve issues related to the Program. The PIU and FSOU will ensure continuous coordination \nwith  MOF,  MSWL,  and  other  stakeholders.  Governance  risks  will  be  addressed  through  the \nprovision  of  clear  operational  guidelines,  a  communication  strategy  to  make  the  food  stamp \nprogram transparent, and external monitoring and other activities described in para. 67. \n \n118.  Resistance to Change. There is also a risk of national and local stakeholders resisting \nchanges  to  be  introduced  by  the  FNSWPP  to  (i)  improve  systems  of  targeting  and  service \ndelivery,  (ii)  shift  to  better  instruments  and  strategies  for  policy  analysis  and  program \ndevelopment  and  management,  and  (iii)  introduce  or  harmonize  mitigation  and  response \nmechanisms  to  food  crises  and  similar  emergencies.  To  help  manage  this  risk,  the  Project \nincludes  a  subcomponent  that  will  develop  and  implement  a  communication  strategy  to \ndisseminate  complete  and  accurate  information  about  the  Program,  its  specific  components, \nand  its  intended  outcomes.  Participation  of  all  stakeholders  (national  and  local)  in  all  program \nprocesses  will  also  help  to  develop  a  sense  of  ownership  of,  and  collaboration  with,  the \nFNSWPP, in addition to developing intense policy dialogue at the central level.   \n \n119.  Capacity  Constraints.  The  FNSWPP  was  designed  with  consideration  given  to  the \nlimitations  and  constraints  in  capacities  of  local  and  national  partners.  Thus,  capacity \ndevelopment and augmentation inputs are built into the design. A major concern is the limited \nstaffing capacity at the soum and khoroo levels, where actual delivery of safety net assistance \nwill  happen.  This  limited  capacity  will  be  augmented  by  (i)  providing  in-depth  training  to  the \nsoum and khoroo SWO on the Program, (ii) training and mobilizing NGO implementing partners \nto implement the Program in collaboration with the soum and khoroo SWO, and (iii) training and \nactivating the soum and khoroo LSCs to support Program implementation and take the lead in \nverifying and validating eligibility of target beneficiaries. Components 2 and 3 of the Project were \ndesigned to provide expert assistance during implementation, while at the same time delivering \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\ncapacity development inputs such as systems of social welfare service delivery and policy and \nprogram development. \n \n120.  Pilot-Testing Risks. Experience with government ministries in Mongolia has highlighted \na risk in pilot-testing. This is because beneficiary groups tend to expect a pilot program element \nto immediately become a regular practice or entitlement from the Government, thus making later \nprogram  adjustments  difficult.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  partnering  with  civil  society \norganizations to (i) allow adjustments in program design as a result of pilot-testing, (ii) augment \nthe limited implementation capacity of the soum and khoroo SWOs, and (iii) enable the program \nto be rapidly scaled up. The other aspect of this risk is that the pilot will remain just a pilot, even \nif the results are good and recommendations appropriate. To lower this risk, specific proposals \nand  continuous  policy  dialogue  with  the  highest  levels  of  Government  on  social  welfare \ninstitutional reforms and capacity development will facilitate the adoption of pilot-testing results \ninto regular social safety net planning and implementation by the Government. \n \n121.  Risks from Rapid Design. The FNSWPP was designed in an accelerated way\u2014trying \nto make a response to an emergency in a rapidly changing economic and political environment. \nDespite  the  quick  design,  the  FNSWPP  has  (i)  undertaken  and  proposed  continuous  policy \ndialogue  with  the  highest  levels  of Government  to  ensure  common  understanding and  actions \non  needed  policy  reforms,  (ii)  included  pilot-testing  to  ensure  effectiveness  of  the  design,  (iii) \nbuilt on existing institutions and systems, (iv) integrated Government ideas, and (v) designed for \nstrong technical and administrative leadership and strong technical assistance with components \nthat build on each other to support short- and long-term initiatives. \n \nF. \n \n122.  Reaching impact targets assumes that international food prices will stabilize in the near \nfuture  and  that  food  imports  to  Mongolia  are  not  hindered.  The  attainment  of  outcome  targets \nalso assumes that international food prices will stabilize and that there is sufficient political and \nadministrative  stability  to  properly  implement  the  FNSWPP  and  the  ensuing  social  welfare \nreforms. \n \n\nAssumptions \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS  \n\nSpecific Assurances  \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  of  Mongolia  has  given  the \n123. \nfollowing  specific  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the  legal  documents.

There  are  two \nimplementing agencies under MSWL, the State Social Insurance General Office (SSIGO), and \nthe Labor and Social Welfare Office (LSWO). These agencies have representatives responsible \nfor delivering services at the local level. Governors of all local governments1 are obliged by law \nto  undertake  area-specific  social  protection  activities.  MSWL  is  responsible  for  developing \nnational policies on women, children, youth, the disabled, and the elderly. The percentage of the \npopulation  receiving  social  welfare  benefits  (excluding  those  receiving  social  insurance  and \nemployment services) was about 6% of the total population in 2004.2 \n \n2. \nThe  LSWO  is  responsible  for  delivering  social  welfare  assistance  and  services  and \nemployment  promotion.  The  types  of  social  welfare  assistance  being  provided  through  the \nLSWO include: (i) in-kind services, including residential facilities for the elderly and the disabled \nand  services  for  the  poor,  homeless  persons  and  children;  (ii)  discounts  and subsidies  for  the \nelderly,  the  disabled,  and  other  groups  to  reduce  the  costs  of  housing  and  health  care;  and  \n(iii) short-term cash benefits for pregnancy and delivery, child care, families with many children, \nadoption  of  orphans,  infant  care,  and  long-term  pensions  for  those  not  eligible  for  SSIGO \nassistance.   \n \nMongolia  has  an  above  average  social  protection  index  (SPI) 3  which  reflects  the \n3. \nexistence  of  a  comprehensive  social  insurance  and  assistance  system.  However,  poverty \ntargeting  received  the  lowest  rating  among  the  four  social  protection  indicators  (expenditure, \ncoverage, poverty targeting, and social protection impact4) and the SPI gives Mongolia a \u201cbest \nestimate\u201d overall poverty targeting rate of only 60%.   \n \n4. \nThe lack of proper targeting methodologies results in large inclusion and exclusion errors \nand increasing expenditures. About 70% of all nonpoor households receive some form of social \nassistance, but 40% of the country\u2019s poor do not receive any form of social assistance. This is \npartly  due  to  the  broad  official  definitions  of  vulnerability;  there  are  23  defined  groups  of \nbeneficiaries,  including  all  children  under  16,  elderly  people,  mothers  with  newborns,  single \nparents, and unemployed people, irrespective of their socioeconomic status.5  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe Government Law in 1993 established the MSWL and the 1995 Social Welfare Law \nestablished  the  legal  basis  for  the  current  social  welfare  system.  Amendments  to  the  Social \nWelfare  Law  in  1997  and  1998  created  the  management  and  organization  of  an  independent \nsocial  welfare  system.  Further  amendments  and  revisions  to  the  Social  Welfare  Law  provided \nthe  legal  basis  for  the  current  package  of  social  assistance  including:  the  Law  on  the  Social \nWelfare  for  Elderly  Persons;  the  Law  on  the  Social  Security  for  Persons  with  Disabilities;  and \nthe  Law  on  the  Allowances  to  Mothers  and  Children  and  Monetary  Assistance  to  Mothers, \nChildren and New Families and Couples. These laws define the current types and coverage of \n                                                 \n1 Governors sign annual performance contracts with the minister of MSWL. \n2 National Statistics Office. 2007.

The amendments \nenacted in January 2008 revised the eligibility requirements for beneficiaries of welfare benefits, \nbut these did not include poverty criteria and thus did not address the need to target the poor \n(footnote 5). \n \nC. \n \nThe  Government  adopted  a  social  security  sector  strategy  paper 6  in  2003  as  the \n7. \nframework  for  the  long-term  development  of  the  sector.7 The  strategy  paper  spelled  out  three \nlong-term policy reforms for social welfare: (i) adjust centralized public social welfare services to \nmove  toward  a  comprehensive  social  welfare  system  that  is  community-based  and  supports \nhouseholds\u2019 development, (ii) rationalize the scope for social welfare services and improve their \ncost-efficiency, and (iii) introduce services that provide care in a family environment. Among the \nstrategies identified are: transform cash-based benefits into multifunctional services based on a \nhousehold\u2019s or an individual\u2019s initiative and choice, improve the quality and accessibility of social \nwelfare services, improve the management of and methodologies in social welfare services, and \nreform residential care institutions in accordance with community-based approaches.    \n \nD. \n \n8. \nBeneficiary coverage and expenditure on social welfare benefits have expanded rapidly \nover  the  past  few  years  and  they  are  expected  to  increase  even  more  in  the  near  future. \nCoverage of social welfare benefits increased by 7.6 times from 2004 to 2007. The number of \nbeneficiaries  receiving  conditional  cash  benefits  increased  by  3.6  times  from  2006  to  2007. \nPregnant or lactating mothers received more than 80% of the cash benefits in both years. Large \nincreases are being considered for other cash transfers in the coming year, such as the honored \nmothers\u2019 allowance.8 However, these benefits are not necessarily pro-poor in their objectives. \n \n9. \nThe total budget of MSWL has been 7% to 16% of gross domestic product (GDP) during \nthe  last  3  years,  and  is  estimated  at  MNT1.397  billion  in  2009.  A  51%  budget  increase  is \nplanned  for  2009,  mainly  arising  from  the  substantial  increase  in  the  honored  mothers\u2019 \nallowance.  The  social  protection  budget  consists  of  five  major  programs,  with  social  welfare \ncomprising 32% of the budget. Higher anticipated revenues from the mining sector may lead to \na further expansion in social welfare.  \n \n\nCoverage of Beneficiaries and Expenditures \n\n                                                 \n6   The social security sector strategy paper was developed in 2001 with technical and financial assistance from ADB. \n7     Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor.  2003.

The Government plans to further increase the honored \nmothers\u2019 allowance to MNT500,000 for mothers  with five  or six children and MNT1 million for mothers  with more \nthan six children, covering 155,000 mothers, in 2009. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\nTable A2.1: Number of Persons who Received Social Welfare Benefits and Assistance \n(by type, \u2018000 persons) \n \n\nDescription \nPregnancy and delivery \nCaring children \nTwin children \nAdopted orphan children \nInfant \nSingle person\u2019s funeral \nHonored mothers\u2019 allowance \nChild money \nConditioned cash benefits \nAllowances for new families/couples\nAllowances for newborn babies \n       Total \n\n2004 \n54.5 \n59.1 \n0.3 \n0.6 \n7.5 \n0.0 \n33.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n155.5 \n\n2005 \n45.6 \n53.9 \n0.4 \n0.7 \n6.7 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n647.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n754.8 \n\n2006 \n37.9 \n44.3 \n0.2 \n0.4 \n3.3 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n872.4 \n24.3 \n23.6 \n41.1 \n1,047.6 \n\n2007 \n0.0 \n22.3 \n0.0 \n0.4 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n948.7 \n88.1 \n59.4 \n57.7 \n1,176.6 \n\nSource: National Statistics Office. 2007.

Despite the increase in mining revenues, the major risk for the \nsector  is  that  this  escalation  in  expenditures  and  a  universal  entitlement  system  may  not  be \nsustainable but will be very difficult to cut in the future.  \n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRecent ADB Assistance \n\nExperience with Targeting \n\nE. \n \n12. \nIn  2001,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  loan  to  support  the  Social \nSecurity Sector Development Project (SSSDP)9 to initiate reforms in social welfare, insurance, \nand  employment  services.  The  SSSDP  was  a  response  to  emerging  needs  in  Mongolia\u2019s \ntransition to a free market economy. It was envisaged that its social welfare component would: \n(i)  develop  and  upgrade  social  welfare  service  facilities  for  the  elderly  and  the  disabled,  \n(ii)  develop  community-based  social  welfare  services,  and  (iii)  strengthen  the  social  welfare \nmanagement  capacity.  The  SSSDP  has  been  implemented  since  February  2002  and  was \npartially  completed  in  2008.  One  of  the  main  goals  of  ADB\u2019s  program  of  support\u2014to  refocus \neligibility  criteria  for  social  welfare  benefits  on  the  poorest  groups\u2014was  not  met  for  the  child \nmoney  program,  despite  agreement  between  ADB  and  the  Government  on  the  program \npolicies,  advisory  technical  assistance,  and  special  study  support.  After  the  Government \ndecided to broaden social welfare eligibility in 2006 and universalized the child money program, \nthe third SSSDP tranche was cancelled. \n \nF. \n \nIn  2005,  the  Government  introduced  the  child  money  program,10 which  was  the  first \n13. \nsocial  welfare  allowance  to  use  a  proxy  means  test11 to  target  poor  households.  However,  in \nMay 2006, in response to political pressure and access to new revenue, Parliament enacted a \nlaw which made \u201cchild money\u201d a universal entitlement to which all children below 18 would be \neligible. Immediately, the number of social welfare beneficiaries soared from less than 160,000 \nin 2004 to more than 1 million (40% of the population) in 2006. ADB has expressed concern that \nall 23 types of current social welfare assistance use population categories rather than poverty \nas the basis for eligibility. More than 80% of social welfare beneficiaries since 2005 are those \nreceiving \u201cchild money\u201d (footnote 3).  \n \nG. \n \n14. \nPublic  service  agencies  employ  1,200  social  workers,  798  of  whom  work  for  social \nwelfare agencies, with 510 of these employed at the lowest administrative level of the soum or \nkhoroo. Soums and khoroos with large populations recruit social worker assistants to help with \nthe workload. The rest are employed by schools (624), law enforcement agencies, or hospitals. \nAbout 20% have a social work degree. Recently, social welfare officers12 have been recruited to \nsupport  social  workers  in  areas  with  large  populations.  Since  1997,  a  system  of  training  and \naccreditation for BA and MA degrees has been developed. Livelihood support councils (LSCs) \nhave been created to facilitate social welfare outreach and assist in ensuring identification and \nvalidation  of  needy  recipients.  Each  LSC  has  seven  part-time  and  unpaid  staff  (one  social \nworker,  two  representatives  of  nongovernment  organizations,  two  representatives  of  citizens, \nand two representatives of government organizations).  Although the councils are in place, there \nare  few  guidelines  or  resources  for  staff  and  little  training.  Analyzing  and  strengthening  this \ndecentralized social welfare system is therefore one of the most important contributions that the \n\nHuman Resources and Capacity \n\n                                                 \n9       ADB.  2001.

International rice prices increased by 196% and wheat prices rose by 72% between May \n2007  and  May  2008.13 The  inflation  rate  in  Mongolia  reached  33%  in  May  2008,  much  higher \nthan in most other Asian countries.14 Food prices accounted for more than two-thirds of inflation, \nwith  the  prices  of  wheat  and  meat  products  contributing  nearly  half  of  the  inflation15 and  oil \nprices contributing a small but growing proportion.  \n \n16. \nThe  spike  in  food  prices  threatens  to  push  large  numbers  of  people  below  the  poverty \nline16 and to increase the incidence of malnutrition in Mongolia. Poor households are forced to \nincrease their food expenditure at the expense of nonfood expenditure, such as on medical care \nand  education.  Informal  safety  nets  among  Mongolians,  through  remittances  between  family \nmembers,  which  constitute  around  22%  of  household  consumption,17 are  being  stressed  as  a \nresult.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  (Supplementary  Appendix  G)  found  that  coping \nmechanisms  such  as  reducing  the  quantity  and  quality  of  food,  and  postponing  or  eliminating \nexpenditures for energy, transport, health and education are already being used. The poor are \nhardest hit by overall inflation and especially by the food price increases.  \n \n17. \nThe emergence of the food crisis highlights several challenges and opportunities for the \nsocial  welfare  sector.  These  include:  addressing  inadequate  systems  for  delivering  assistance \ntargeted  at  the  poor,  defining  social  welfare  strategies  and  enhancing  capacities,  and \naddressing the absence of emergency response mechanisms.   \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nA failure to initiate targeting systems to identify the poor within the social welfare \nsystem leaves MSWL with few tools to address the situation quickly and to direct \nassistance to those most in need. However, the emergence of this crisis has also \ncreated a consensus among government stakeholders that any effort to mitigate \nthe  immediate  impacts  of  the  food  price  increases  on  the  poor  will  need  clear \ntargeting  mechanisms  if  it  is  to  make  a  difference  for  beneficiaries  and  to  be \nfiscally  sustainable.  The  food  stamp  program  provides  a  clear  opportunity  for \ntargeting a needed benefit directly at the poor and for making a significant impact \non their capacity to maintain household nutritional status. \n \nSocial  assistance  programs  are  poorly  aligned  with  fiscal  sustainability  goals. \nThe  current  system  of  untargeted  cash  transfers  results  in  very  high  public \n\n                                                 \n13 The price of rice in the international market rose by 196% (from $325/ton in May 2007 to $963/ton in May 2008). \nWheat prices in the international market rose by 72% (from $203/ton in May 2007 to $349/ton in May 2008). Food \nand Agriculture Organization (FAO) database, 2008. \n\n14 Inflation has reached an 11-year high in the People\u2019s Republic of China (at 8.7% in February 2008); a 9-year high \nin the Republic of Korea (at 5.5% in June 2008), a 26-year high in Singapore (at 7.6% in April 2008); and a 12-year \nhigh in Viet Nam (at 25.2% in May 2008). \n\n15 This is because food prices have increased (year-on-year basis) the most over the last year: 59% in May 2008 and \n57%  in  June  2008  compared  to  about  7%  during  the  corresponding  months  in  2007.  Prices  for  wheat  and  meat \nproducts have increased by 47% and 49% respectively since the beginning of the 2008. \n\n16 Palanivel,  T.  2008.

Mongolia's extensive system of social \nsafety nets cost about 7% of GDP a year in 2006, already large by international \nstandards. The effectiveness and fiscal sustainability of the current programs are \nbeing  questioned,  although  limited  data  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E) \nsystems  make  it  difficult  to  make  definite  judgments  at  this time.  The  FNSWPP \nwill  demonstrate  targeting  methodologies  and  their  direct  impact  on  the  poor.  It \nwill  build  capacity  within  MSWL  and  provide  a  basis  for  rethinking  poverty-\nfocused strategies within the sector and for building adequate M&E systems. \n \n\n(iii)  Weak  capacity  at  the  local  level  among  social  workers  and  LSCs  limits  the \nbenefits  of  a  decentralized  system  and  compromises  the  ability  to  deliver \neffective  community-based  social  services.  Building  capacity  and  creating  clear \nguidelines on roles and responsibilities will facilitate the creation of efficient and \nadequate systems. \n \n\n(iv)  MSWL has no emergency response systems in place and is therefore unable to \naddress the needs of the poor immediately during this crisis. Designing an early \nwarning  system,  mitigation  and \nfood-related \nemergencies will provide a basis for action in the future to address other possible \ncrises. \n\nresponse  mechanisms \n\nfor \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n41 \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \nTable A3: Food Security \u2013 Proposed Assistance to the Government \n \n\n \n \nOrganization \nA.

The  evaluation  of  a  bidder\u2019s \nqualifications shall only take into account the bidder\u2019s capacity and resources to perform \nthe  contract,  in  particular  its  experience  and  past  performance  on  similar  contracts, \ncapabilities  with  respect  to  personnel,  equipment  and  construction  or  manufacturing \nfacilities  and  financial  position.  In  carrying  out  the  post-qualification  assessment,  the \nexecuting  agency/implementing  agency  shall  exercise \nin \nrequesting,  in  writing,  from  a  bidder  only  missing  factual  or  historical  supporting \ninformation  related  to  the  bidder's  qualifications  and  shall  provide  a  reasonable  time \nperiod (that is, a minimum of 7 days) to the bidder to provide his response.  \n \n(b) Evaluation criteria to be used in the evaluation of bids shall be clearly specified in the \nbidding  documents,  and  evaluation  criteria  other  than  price  shall  be  quantified  in \nmonetary  terms.  All  evaluation  criteria  so  specified,  shall  be  taken  into  account  in  bid \nevaluation. Merit points shall not be used in bid evaluation.  \n \nBid Opening, Evaluation and Award of Contract \n\nreasonable \n\njudgment \n\n(a)  Bids  shall  be  opened  in  public,  immediately  upon  the  stipulated  deadline  for \nsubmission  of  bids.  Bidders'  representatives  and  the  project's  beneficiaries  from  the \nconcerned local community who choose to attend shall be allowed to attend. The name \nof the bidder and total amount of each bid, including discounts, shall be read aloud and \nrecorded in the Bid Opening Record. Bids received after the deadline for bid submission \nshall be rejected and returned to the bidders unopened. Immediately after completion of \nthe  bid  opening  proceedings,  a  copy  of  the  Bid  Opening  Record  shall  be  posted  at  a \nprominent location, accessible to the public, outside the office of the concerned procuring \nentity  and  shall  be  retained  at  the  same  location  until  the  award  of  contract  has  been \nnotified. A copy of the Bid Opening Record shall be promptly provided to all bidders who \nsubmitted bids.      \n \n(b)  All  bids  shall  not  be  rejected  or  new  bids  invited  without  ADB's  prior  written \nconcurrence. \n \n(c)  No  bid  shall  be  rejected  merely  on  the  basis  of  a  comparison  with  the  owner\u2019s \nestimated cost or budget ceiling without the ADB's prior written concurrence. \n \n(d)  A  bid  containing  material  deviations from  or  reservations  to  the  terms,  conditions  or \nspecifications of the bidding documents shall be rejected as not substantially responsive. \nA bidder shall not be permitted to withdraw material deviations or reservations once bids \n\n(vi) \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7       57   \n\n \n\nhave been opened.  Bidders shall not be eliminated from detailed evaluation on the basis \nof non-material, minor deviations or reservations. \n \n(e) The evaluation of bids shall be done in strict adherence to the criteria specified in the \nbidding  documents,  and  contracts  shall  be  awarded  to  the  qualified  bidder  offering  the \nlowest evaluated and substantially responsive bid. \n \n(f) Bidders shall be requested to extend the validity of their bids only under exceptional \ncircumstances  and,  in  all  such  cases,  the  executing  agency/implementing  agency  shall \nobtain ADB\u2019s approval for the extension of the bid validity period in a timely manner, and \nsubsequently, communicate such request for extension of the validity period of the bids in \nwriting to all bidders before the date of expiry of their bids. Bidders shall have the right to \nrefuse  to  grant  such  an  extension  of  the  validity  of  their  bids  without  forfeiting  their  bid \nsecurities. Bidders agreeing to extend the validity date of their bids shall also extend the \nvalidity period of their bid securities. \n \n(g) In the case of contracts of more than 18 months\u2019 duration, the bidding documents and \nthe resultant contract shall provide for price adjustment, based on a formula acceptable \nto ADB, which shall be disclosed to the bidders in the bidding documents. \n \n(h) If a bidder that submitted the lowest evaluated bid refuses to accept the arithmetical \ncorrections made by the executing agency/implementing agency during the evaluation of \nits bid, its bid shall be disqualified and its bid security shall be forfeited. \n \n(i) A bidder shall not be required, as a condition for award, to undertake obligations not \nspecified in the bidding documents or otherwise to modify its bid as originally submitted. \n \n(j)  There  shall  be  no  post-bidding  negotiations  with  the  lowest  evaluated  bidder  or  any \nother  bidder.  No  bidder  shall  be  required,  as  a  condition  for  the  award  of  contract,  to \nchange his bid price or otherwise materially alter its bid after it has been submitted. \n \n(k) A bidder declared ineligible by ADB, based on a determination by ADB that the bidder \nhas engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices in competing for or in \nexecuting an ADB-financed contract, shall be ineligible to be awarded an ADB-financed \ncontract during the period of time determined by ADB. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(vii) \n\nInspections of Accounts and Records \n\nBidding documents and contracts under national competitive bidding procedures financed \nby  ADB  shall  include  a  provision  requiring  suppliers  and  contractors  to  permit  ADB  to \ninspect their accounts and records relating to the bid submission and the performance of \nthe  contract  by  the  supplier  and/or  contractor,  as  the  case  may  be,  and  to  have  them \naudited by auditors appointed by ADB, if so required by ADB. \n\n(viii) \n\nComplaints by Bidders and Handling of Complaints  \n\nBidders\u2019  complaints  shall  be  handled  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  set  out  in \nChapter Seven of the Public Procurement Law of Mongolia. \n\n(ix) \n\nDisclosure of Decisions on Contract Awards \n\nAt the same time that notification on award of contract is given to the successful bidder, \nthe  results  of  the  bid  evaluation  shall  be  published  in  a  local  newspaper  or  well-known \nfreely accessible website identifying the bid and lot numbers and providing information on \n(i) name of each bidder who submitted a bid, (ii) bid prices as read out at bid opening, (iii) \nname of bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for their rejection, (iv) name \nof the winning bidder, and the price it offered, as well as the duration and summary scope \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nof  the  contract  awarded.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nMongolia  is  currently  experiencing  a  very  high  inflation  rate:  18.5%  since  the  beginning  of  2008  and  32.2%  year-on-year  in \nSeptember 2008. More than two-thirds of June inflation was due to increased food prices, with oil prices contributing a small \nbut  growing  proportion.  Price  hikes  for  food  staples  such  as  flour  and  meat  are  contributing  the  most,  despite  Government \nefforts over the past 9 months to regulate price increases. The poor are hardest hit by overall inflation and especially by the \nfood price increases.  \n \nMongolia  has  an  extensive  system  of  social  welfare  benefits  and  recently  initiated  a  decentralized  system  for  beneficiary \nidentification  and  delivery  of  services  supported,  in  part,  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Social  Security  Sector \nDevelopment Project (SSSDP) loan. Assessments of the impacts of welfare benefits on the poorest have found that they are \noften  limited  because  of:  (i)  lack  of  targeting,  (ii)  problems  with  coverage  due  to  difficulties  in  attaining  the  necessary  civil \nregistration,  and  (iii)  limited  capacity  among  service  providers.  There  is  consensus  among  stakeholders  that  any  effort  to \nmitigate the immediate impacts of the food price increases on the poor will need clear targeting mechanisms so it both makes \na difference for beneficiaries and is fiscally sustainable.  \n \nThe  FNSWPP  provides  a  targeted  emergency  response  to  an  increase  in  food  prices.  It  is  directly  aimed  at  providing \nassistance for the poor. The components build on the existing social welfare system and help the Government to design and \nimplement a food stamp program that specifically mitigates the impact of escalating food prices on the poor and strengthens \nthe social welfare system. The FNSWPP will do the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nTarget  food  stamp  assistance  directly  to  the  poor. 100,000  urban  and rural  poor  households  will  be covered, \nwith  at  least  70%  of  beneficiaries  from  the  lowest  quintiles.  A  proxy  means  test  will  be  designed,  used,  and \neventually considered for other welfare programs.  \n\n(ii)  Create  awareness  on  benefits  and  rights.  The  Project  will  create  awareness  of  the  food  stamp  program  and \n\nprovide information about rights and registration procedures for receiving social welfare benefits. \n\n(iii)  Pilot  community-based  food  security  small  grants.  Small  grants  will  be  used  to  promote  household  and \ncommunity  food  security  over  the  long  term.  The  grants  will  build  community  greenhouses  and  kitchen  gardens, \ninitiate small producer groups, and provide nutrition education. \n\n(iv)  Build  capacity  and  awareness  among  stakeholders.  Capacity  development  for  targeting,  food  stamp \nimplementation,  civil  registration  procedures,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  of  welfare  programs  will  be \ncarried out. \n\n(v)  Provide  technical  assistance  to  ensure  poverty-focused  social  welfare  systems.  Extensive  technical \nassistance  will  be  provided  by  the  Project  to  facilitate:  (a)  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  food  stamp \nemergency response; and (b) analysis of key issues and design of M&E systems in support of the midterm social \nwelfare sector strengthening goals.  \n\n(vi)  Ensure  gender  inclusion.  Gender  dimensions  of  poverty  will  be  covered  in  the  proxy  means  test,  in  gender- \nsensitive  communication  and  awareness  programs,  including  women\u2019s  non-government  organizations  (NGOs)  in \nthe  communication  and  community  grants  programs,  promoting  sex-disaggregated  data  in  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation systems, and ensuring the gender dimensions are mainstreamed into the FNSWPP through the gender \nand development plan. \n\nThe  grant  directly  supports  Government  plans  to  provide  targeted  assistance  to  the  poor  as  part  of  emergency  efforts  to \naddress the food crisis. It supports the focus on inclusive social development the country partnership strategy. The design is \nin line  with the emphasis on inclusive economic growth in  ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020) \nand responds directly to the President\u2019s pledge at the ADB Annual Meeting in Madrid to assist developing member countries \nin tackling soaring food prices. ADB has a long history of involvement in the social protection sector in Mongolia. These grants \nbuild on the institutional structures and service delivery mechanisms that were designed and initiated under the SSSDP loan. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nthe \n\nthe  public  on \n\nrights  and  procedures \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention-MDG (TI-M) \n \n1. Key Issues  \nFood stamp assistance  will be targeted at poor households and will have a direct impact on: Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) 1 (ending poverty and hunger), MDG 4 (child health) and MDG 5 (maternal health), and an indirect impact on MDG 2 \n(primary education). In response to rising inflation and food prices, the Government set up a National Council in late 2007 to \noversee the implementation of a Price Stabilization Program. In May 2008, a working group headed by the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) was established under the National Council to develop a program to support vulnerable groups who are most affected \nby the increase in food prices. This work is complemented by a draft law proposing food and nutrition subsidies (approved by \nthe cabinet) which also calls for a food stamp program targeting the most vulnerable. In March 2008, fear of inflation was the \nnumber one problem identified by respondents in a survey by the Asia Foundation. The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor \n(MSWL) does not have a specific mechanism to: (i) address emergency needs arising from the food crisis, or (ii) identify the \npoorest in the community.  \n \nData  on  the  impact  of  the  rising  food  prices  are  scarce,  but  what  is  available  reveals  that  poor  households,  and  especially \nthose  in  urban  areas,  are  particularly  affected.  In  2006,  a  joint  Government  of  Mongolia\u2013UN  Food  Security  Assessment \nMission  concluded  that  food  insecurity  affected  around  800,000  people  (about  30%  of  the  population)  and  was  on  the \nincrease  in  the  largest  cities  (Darkhan,  Erdenet,  and  Ulaanbaatar).  Despite  rising  living  standards  overall,  Mongolia  is  still \nconsidered one of poorest countries in Asia with an overall poverty rate of 32.6% in 2006. Of these, 4.5% were categorized as \nextremely poor. A household income and expenditure survey from 2006 to 2007 revealed enormous and rising inequality with \nregard  to  consumption.  The  poorest  quintile  of  the  population  now  spends  about  71%  of  its  consumption  budget  on  food \ncompared with 23.6% for the wealthiest. The average for all income groups is 38.6%.a The food stamp program will directly \naddress this disparity by providing assistance to the poorest and helping them to cope with the rising cost of food. \n \nThe FNSWPP will contribute to poverty reduction and the priorities of MSWL and the Government by: (i) introducing targeting \nmethodologies  that  identify  the  poor  and  limit  inclusion  and  exclusion  errors;  (ii)  building  capacity  among  stakeholders  for \nimplementation,  and  awareness  among \nreceiving  benefits; \n(iii)  introducing  M&E  systems  for  the  sector  capable  of  identifying  and  analyzing  impact;  and  (iv)  providing  small  grants  to \nfacilitate household food security and nutrition education for the mid- and long-term. Direct assistance for poor households to \nreduce  the  burden  of  food  expenditure  will  help  to  reduce  the  use  of  coping  mechanisms,  such  as  reduced  consumption \n(leading to malnutrition) and substitution from other expenditures on health, education, transport, and energy.  \n \nThe distribution of food stamps to poor households will directly address the MDGs. International experience has found the use \nof food stamps is more effective than cash transfers in increasing food consumption and improving nutrient availability. MDG \n1 (target 2) on hunger will be directly addressed by facilitating access to food for the poorest. As a consequence, FNSWPP \nwill also affect the attainment of MDG 4 (child health) and 5 (maternal health). Households headed by women and lactating \nmothers have both been identified in recent poverty assessments as being particularly vulnerable and these will be identified \nby the proxy means test. The incidence of underweight children, under-5 mortality, stunting, wasting, anemia and rickets are \nhigh  in  Mongolia  compared  with  other  Asian  countries  and  daily  calorific  intake  for  poor  households  in  only  63.3%  of  the \nrecommended  amounts.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  found  that  already  poor  households  are  cutting  back  on \nexpenditures including education expenses for children. Therefore MDG 2 (primary education) will also be addressed.  \n \n2. Design Features \nDirect poverty  reduction mechanisms included in the project design include: (i) establishment of a targeting methodology to \nidentify poor households and beneficiaries; (ii) food stamps to increase income and food intake; (iii) extensive communication \noutreach directed at beneficiaries, communities, and other local stakeholders; (iv) piloting of community-based food security \nsmall  grants;  (v)  establishment  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  capable  of  analyzing  the  impact  of  the  food  stamp \nprogram  specifically  and  social  welfare  programs  overall;  and  (vi)  capacity  development  of  social  workers  and  livelihood \nsupport councils. \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nThe direct and short-term impact of the food stamp policy reform will be improved access to food and social welfare services \nfor  the  poorest.  Indirect  short-  and  medium-term  impacts  include  extending  awareness  of  the  food  stamp  program,  civil \nregistration, and social welfare benefits among the poor and the general population.  \n \nThe reform will have a direct impact on household food budgets of the poorest and on their capacity to mitigate the impacts \nof food inflation. It will improve household nutrition, health, and the capacity of households to pay for other essentials such as \neducation, energy, and transport. The proxy means test will ensure proper identification. The policy reform  will  ensure that \nGovernment has a welfare mechanism designed to address emergency needs. \n \nThe policy reform addresses poverty reduction and the MDGs by: (i) establishing food stamp emergency assistance for the \npoorest;  (ii)  ensuring  the  poor  are  able  to  maintain  nutritional  levels  and  do  not  have  to  reduce  access  to  healthcare, \neducation,  transport  and  energy;  (iii)  initiating  targeting  methodologies  to  reduce  errors  of  inclusion,  exclusion;  and  (iv) \nestablishing an M&E system capable of monitoring impacts and informing program design and implementation. \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10      67 \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis. Findings from the social analysis were generated from: (i) a review of available reports and \nstatistical  data,  (ii)  stakeholder  interviews,  and  (iii)  a  series  of  rapid  community  consultations  carried  out  in  urban  (five  in \nUlaanbaatar) and rural (six in Dundgobi aimag) communities. In each district and soum, one ordinary and one poor khoroob \n(Ulaanbaatar)  or  bagh  (Dundgobi)  was  selected.  Focus  group  discussions  included  the  poor,  elderly  and  disabled.  Key \nfindings include:  \n \n(i)  Rising  food  prices  are  directly  affecting  the  poor  and  have  a  particular  impact  on  the  urban  poor  who  lack  alternative \naccess to food sources and have limited informal safety nets. National data for tracking the impacts of food price inflation are \nnot  yet  available.  Urban  and  rural  areas  are  both  feeling  the  effects  but  there  are  important  regional  differences  in  price \nescalation that need to be analyzed. \n(ii) Coping mechanisms being used include: (a) limiting the quantity and quality of food consumed; (b) postponing or skipping \nexpenditures for schooling and medicines; (c) limiting travel; (d) substituting energy sources;c and (e) moving in with relatives \nto reduce costs, particularly of food and heating. The impacts have been primarily felt since May\u2013June 2008 and are expected \nto intensify over the winter when food expenditures must compete with energy needs in household budgets. \n(iii) Some poor families (e.g., migrants) are not properly registered and are therefore not receiving any social benefits. Many of \nthe poorest rely almost exclusively on child money and other benefits for basic subsistence. Lack of registration adds to the \nvulnerability of poor households who are forced to absorb the full impact of inflation with no assistance.  \n(iv)  Decentralized  services  need  to  be  strengthened.  Limited  capacity  and  inadequate  methodologies  constrain  the \neffectiveness of social worker outreach to poor populations and the effectiveness of livelihood support councils. \n(v)  The  food  stamp  program  and  community  food  security  grants  fill  important  gaps  and  are  welcomed  by  the  poor. \nConsultations  confirmed  support  for  a  special  food  stamp  program  and  verified  that  several  kinds  of  informal  systems \nproviding credit for welfare recipients are already in use with shops in rural areas. Community food security projects have not \nfocused exclusively on the urban poor. Stakeholders feel this is an important gap to be filled by this Project. \n(vi) The food stamp program should include informal markets (e.g., urban and rural wholesale markets) as partners. The pilot \ntests will investigate the viability of including these as they are important sources of cheaper and lower quality foods for the \npoor.  \n(vii) The choice of a food stamp program over cash transfers is motivated, in part, by stakeholders not wanting funds to go to \nalcohol purchases. Alcoholism is an important public health and social problem in Mongolia. \nB.    Consultation and Participation \n1.  Extensive  consultation  was  carried  out  with  key  national,  local  and  community  stakeholders  during  project  preparation. \nSeveral  Government  and  donor  coordination  meetings  were  coordinated  by  the  ADB  team.  A  series  of  rapid  qualitative \nconsultations with urban and rural communities and local government stakeholders were out carried for the poverty and social \nassessment. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nThe FNSWPP will have no impact on involuntary resettlement and no adverse impacts on indigenous peoples. Therefore no \nC&P plan has been prepared. The FNSWPP will conduct an extensive community awareness communication program. \nC.   Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key Issues. Key gender issues relevant to the Project identified during preparation are covered in the poverty and social \nassessment (Supplementary Appendix G) and addressed in the gender and development plan and the FNSWPP design and \nimplementation.  These  include:  (i)  households  headed  by  women  and  breastfeeding  mothers  are  particularly  impacted  by \nrising  food  prices,  therefore  the  gender  dimensions  of  poverty  should  be  addressed  in  the  proxy  means  test  to  ensure  that \nthey  are  properly  identified;  (ii)  wholesale  markets  and  informal  rural  markets  are  important  shopping  places  for  urban  and \nrural poor and should, where possible, be included in the food stamp system; (iii) women are primarily in control of money and \ndecisions  regarding  food  purchases  and  should  be  key  stakeholders  in  the  communication  and  awareness  programs,  and \nimplementation  of  community  grants;  (iv)  communication  strategies  and  information,  education,  and  communication  (IEC) \nmaterials  must  incorporate  principles  of  social  equity  and  inclusiveness;  and  (v)  data  disaggregated  by  sex  are  rarely \navailable in the social welfare monitoring systems and should be included in the FNSWPP to measure impacts and assist in \nrefining design and implementation.    \n2.  Key Actions \n\n \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nKey features of the gender plan include: (i) attention to the gendered dimensions of poverty in the proxy means, (ii) piloting of \nurban  wholesale  markets  in  urban  areas,  (iii)  gender-sensitive  public  information  campaign,  (iv)  partnerships  with  women\u2019s \nNGOs  for  community-based  pilots,  (v)  women\u2019s  NGOs  to  serve  as  advocates  for  beneficiaries  in  grievances,  (vi)  data  from \nstudies to be disaggregated by sex and gendered dimensions of poverty to be analyzed, and (vii) M&E to be carried out for \nthe food stamp program tracking its gender impact. The action plan does not require a separate budget, since it is integrated \ninto  the  overall  FNSWPP  cost  and  key  indicators  are  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  The  food  stamp \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\noperating unit and consultants under the program implementation unit will implement the action plan.
