I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia, \nto the Republic of Kiribati for the South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector Project. \n \n2.  South Tarawa comprises a series of islets located along the southern rim of Tarawa Atoll \nwith a total land area of under 15 square kilometers (km2). High population density, poor \nhygiene  practices,  and  inadequate  sanitation  infrastructure  have  contributed  to  a  high \nprevalence of waterborne disease among the local population and degradation of the natural \nenvironment. The proposed project will support improvements to the health of communities in \nSouth Tarawa. This will be achieved through: (i) enhanced community engagement in, and \npublic  awareness  of,  hygiene  and  sanitation;  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  sanitation \ninfrastructure; (iii) capacity development  in sector planning, and operations and maintenance \n(O&M) of urban water supply and sanitation services; and (iv) the creation of a sanitation \nmaintenance fund to ensure adequate financing for sanitation infrastructure maintenance.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Almost 50% of Kiribati\u2019s population of 103,466 lives in South Tarawa, the country\u2019s \npolitical and economic center. South Tarawa\u2019s main urban areas of Bairiki, Betio, and Bikenibeu \nhave a combined population of 24,171. Rapid urbanization has resulted in an annual average \npopulation growth rate of 4.4% since 2005. The average population density in South Tarawa is \n4,150 per km2, and it is as high as 10,610 per km2 in the most densely settled areas.2 In \ncomparison,  in  2010,  Singapore  had  a  population  density  of  7,126  per  km2.3  Population \npressures, combined with uncontrolled urban settlement, have resulted in overcrowding that has \nput stress on critical public infrastructure and the natural environment. \n \n4.  The infant mortality rate in Kiribati at 46 per 1,000 live births is among the highest in the \nworld and can be attributed, in part, to infantile diarrhea.4 Health officials report an average of \ntwo to three outbreaks of acute diarrheal disease in South Tarawa every year which is directly \nlinked to inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.5 A number of studies have shown that \nhousehold groundwater wells, lagoon water close to the shoreline, and edible shellfish contain \nhigh faecal coliform levels.6 The dominant source of contamination is the lack of adequate \nresidential sanitation infrastructure. According to 2005 census data, 33% of South Tarawa\u2019s \nhouseholds used toilets connected to the sewerage system, 27.3% used flush toilets connected \nto septic tanks, 3.7% used compost toilets, 20% used the sea, 29.1% used the beach, 34% \nused pit latrines, and 6.8% used the bush.7  \n \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n2 Government of Kiribati, National Statistics Office. 2010.

Census, Household and Population Count. Bairiki. The total \nis greater than 100% since households use multiple forms of sanitation. ", "2 \n5.  Due to a shortage of management and technical skills and financial resources, the \nsewerage system, operated by the Public Utilities Board (PUB), is in a severely dilapidated \ncondition. Weak capacity to manage existing sanitation assets and operations among PUB and \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  and  Utilities  (MPWU)  staff  has  contributed  to  chronic \nunderperformance of the sewerage system. Sewerage services are provided free of charge to \ncustomers. O&M  activities  are funded through government transfers, while  periodic  capital \ninvestments  in  system  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  have  been  externally  financed  by \ndevelopment partners. The current situation has resulted in low sustainability. In the absence of \nadequate resources, no preventive or routine maintenance is carried out; instead, maintenance \nis deferred until the system fails. This situation imposes high costs on both the government and \nthe  local  population  in  terms  of  lost  productivity,  health  expenditures,  and  degradation  of \nfreshwater resources and coastal areas. \n \n6.  The problem of inadequate sanitation infrastructure is compounded by limited public \nawareness of the links between sanitation, hygiene, and health. Accordingly, demand and \nwillingness to pay for improved sanitation facilities are low. Households do not perceive the full \nbenefits associated with improved sewerage services, nor the large negative externalities linked \nto common behavior such as open defecation and not washing one\u2019s hands. A widespread and \nsustained  public  awareness  and  education  campaign  specifically  targeting groups  such  as \nwomen  and  children  is  required  to  bring  about  improved  hygiene  behavior  and  to  create \ndemand for improved sanitation. \n \n7.  The project is consistent with the Kiribati Development Plan, 2008\u20132011, which commits \nto improving health outcomes, strengthening governance in the provision of public services, and \ninvesting in social and economic infrastructure. The project is included in the Kiribati country \npartnership  strategy,  2010\u20132014,  which  aims  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  economic \nopportunity  by  improving  the  delivery  of  sustainable  infrastructure  services.8  The  project \nsupports the country\u2019s National Sanitation Policy; National Water Resources Policy; and the \nGovernment of Kiribati\u2019s Water Supply, Sanitation, and Solid Waste Management Program for \nSouth  Tarawa  that  was  developed  in  2010  with  assistance  from  the  Pacific  Infrastructure \nAdvisory Center. This program is intended to support a whole-of-sector approach and promote \neffective coordination of development partner-supported activities in the sector.  \n \n8.  The project meets the criteria for sector financing as (i) the government has prepared a \nwater and sanitation program for South Tarawa, and a 20-year water supply and sanitation \ninvestment roadmap, which provides a comprehensive framework for planning and coordinating \nsector  investments;  (ii)  additional  capacity  development  support  to  the  MPWU  and  PUB \nprovided under the project will ensure that the government has the institutional capacity to  \nimplement its sector development plans; and (iii) the country\u2019s sector policies are appropriate, \nand assistance provided under the project will support their implementation, including increasing \naccess to sanitation and ensuring cost recovery in the delivery of water and sanitation services \nthrough tariff reform.  \n \n9.  A number of lessons have been learned from ADB\u2019s previous sector experience in \nKiribati under the Sanitation, Public Health and Environment Improvement Project.9 These \ninclude (i) community sanitation and hygiene practices are slow to change and critically affect \n                                                \n8 ADB. 2009.

Manila (Loan 1648-KIR(SF) approved on 8 December 1998). \n ", "3 \nproject outcomes, (ii) lasting service improvements require sustained capacity development and \ncommitment  to  reform,  (iii)  multi-dimensional  projects  require  coordination  among  all \nstakeholders to be effective. 10 These lessons are reflected in the project design as discussed in \nAppendix 1 of the Project Administration Manual (PAM).11 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the project is the improved health of South Tarawa\u2019s population. The \noutcome of the project will be that South Tarawa\u2019s urban population has enhanced access to \nimproved sanitation infrastructure and services. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The project will deliver the following outputs: (i) sanitation and hygiene practices among \nSouth Tarawa\u2019s population will be improved, (ii) wastewater in South Tarawa will be effectively \nmanaged by PUB, (iii) the MPWU and PUB will have the capacity to plan and manage water \nand sanitation services, (iv) adequate funds will be available to the PUB to finance sanitation \nO&M, and (v) project management and implementation services by the Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic  Development  (MFED)  and  MPWU  will  ensure  efficient  and  effective  project \nimplementation. The majority of project outputs will include specific gender design features to \nensure women\u2019s participation in and access to project benefits. \n \n12.  Output 1: Community engagement. Sanitation and hygiene practices among South \nTarawa\u2019s population will be improved. A comprehensive and sustained community awareness, \neducation,  and  participation  program  will  be  designed  and  implemented  to  improve \nunderstanding of the close links among health, hygiene, water use, and sanitation practices at \nthe urban and village household levels throughout South Tarawa. Awareness activities at the \ncommunity level will be delivered through community mobilizers, engaged under the project, \nwho  will  be  trained  in  sanitation  and  hygiene  promotion.  A  culturally  appropriate  media \ncampaign will also be launched. The community engagement and public awareness programs \nwill be implemented in coordination with development partners including the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and the New Zealand Aid Programme. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Improved  sanitation  infrastructure.  Priority  water  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure will be upgraded. High priority investments identified in the water supply and \nsanitation  road  map,  2011\u20132030  were  selected  as  core  subprojects.  These  include  (i) \nrehabilitation of the existing Bairiki, Betio, and Bikenibeu sewerage systems; (ii) upgrading \nworks on three sewerage outfalls; and (iii) procurement of a sludge digester for septic tank \neffluent,  and  sewerage  and  septic tank  cleaning  equipment.  Additional  subprojects  will  be \nguided by the country\u2019s sector road map and investment plan, and will be selected during \nproject implementation. Subprojects will be screened using eligibility criteria defined under the \nproject. 12  Investments  in  on-site  sanitation  are  likely  to  be  included  among  additional \nsubprojects. To ensure the sustainability of investments, maintenance contracts to provide O&M \nsupport for up to 5 years following completion of civil works project are included under the \nproject. \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2008.

Output 3: Capacity building. The MPWU and PUB will have the capacity to plan and \nmanage water and sanitation services. The project will strengthen the MPWU\u2019s capacity to plan \nand develop the sanitation and water supply sectors. The project will deliver training to PUB \nstaff  in  financial  management  and  O&M  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of  asset \nmanagement plans. The project will also assist with the development and phased introduction of \nan appropriate tariff structure. To address critical skills gaps within the MPWU and PUB, at least \ntwo staff will be provided with the opportunity to obtain diplomas in engineering. \n \n15.  Output 4: Sanitation maintenance fund. Adequate funds will be available to the PUB \nto finance sanitation O&M. A dedicated sanitation maintenance fund (SMF) will be created \nunder the MPWU to ensure that adequate resources are available to finance O&M activities that \nare critical for the sustainability of infrastructure investments. The SMF will initially be set up \nwith $1.4 million in grant funds. A tariff structure will be developed in consultation with the \ngovernment  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  at  the  beginning  of  the  project \nimplementation period, and tariffs will be phased in over the life of the project. By the end of \n2018, the PUB will be expected to recover at least 85% of O&M costs through user charges. \n \n16.  Output 5: Project management. Project management and implementation services by \nthe MFED and MPWU will ensure effective and efficient project implementation. The existing \nproject management unit (PMU) established within the MFED to oversee the ADB-supported \nKiribati Road Rehabilitation Project13 will also be responsible for overall project coordination, \nfinancial management, procurement, and project monitoring and reporting. The coordination, \nfinancial  management,  and  procurement  capacity  of  the  PMU  will  be  strengthened  with \nadditional consultant support provided under the project. Consultants will assist in day-to-day \nadministration, coordination, financial management, and project performance monitoring and \nreporting. \n \n17.  A project implementation unit (PIU) will be established within the MPWU to oversee \nproject implementation. The PIU will be responsible for (i) civil works construction supervision; \n(ii) feasibility  assessments  for  appraisal  of  additional  subprojects;  (iii)  detailed  design  of \nadditional  subprojects;  (iv)  design,  establishment,  and  management  support  for  the  SMF; \n(v) MPWU  and  PUB  capacity  building  activities;  (vi)  community  engagement  and  public \nawareness  activities;  (vii)  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  (GAP);  (viii)  ensuring \nsafeguards  compliance;  (ix)  contract  administration,  including  certifying  payments  to \ncontractors; and (x) carrying out and evaluating the results of periodic baseline and monitoring \nsurveys. The PIU will also assist the PMU in preparing work plans and tender documents, and \nsupport the tender process, reporting, and other relevant tasks. Consultant support will be \nprovided to the PIU to ensure effective project implementation. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $22,480,000 including taxes and duties, physical and \nprice contingencies, and financing charges during project implementation. The investment plan \nis summarized in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are included in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \n \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2010.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR4,700,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod, and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft  loan  agreement.  The  interest  and  other  charges  during  implementation  are  to  be \ncapitalized in the loan. The Government of Australia will provide grant cofinancing of about \n$13.95 million equivalent, to be administered by ADB. A portion of the grant will also be used to \nfinance land acquisition and resettlement costs. Loan and grant proceeds may be used to \nfinance transportation and insurance charges. The government will provide $970,000 equivalent \nto cover taxes and duties, land acquisition, consultant support for land acquisition, resettlement \ncosts, and a contribution to the sanitation maintenance fund.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n21.  The design of the project provides for plant, equipment, and mechanical items to be of a \nstandard suitable for operation in a saltwater environment and Kiribati\u2019s harsh ocean climate. \nSubproject  engineering designs  will  take  into  account the  possible risks  posed  by  climate \nchange impacts. The project will utilize a seawater reticulation system to conserve scarce \nfreshwater resources. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic analysis. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 16.1%, which \nis considered to be acceptable as it exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12% \nadopted for the analysis. The high economic internal rate of return can be attributed to expected \nimprovements  in  productivity  resulting  from  reduced  incidences  of  mortality,  particularly  of \ninfants and children under 5 years of age, and from the avoided near-term risk of a serious \noutbreak of a potentially fatal disease such as cholera. \n \n23.  Financial sustainability. The financial analysis concluded that the project is both viable \nand sustainable based on the government\u2019s commitment to introduce tariffs to cover sewerage \nO&M costs along with service delivery improvements. The establishment of the SMF will ensure \n ", "7 \nthat adequate funds are available to cover O&M costs of the sanitation system in the short to \nmedium term. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Financial management. The use of expenditure commitment controls varies between \nministries  but  is  generally  insufficient.  Although  financial  laws  and  regulations  have  been \nupdated periodically since their original enactment in the mid-1970s, they do not reflect current \nbusiness practices or modern public financial management. Understanding of, and compliance \nwith, existing regulations is also weak. Internal audit is weak, does not have its own mandate, \nand  is  not  actively  involved  in  systems  monitoring.  A  public  expenditure  and  financial \naccountability  assessment  conducted  in  Kiribati  in  2010  identified  weaknesses  in  budget \naccuracy, significant delays and quality issues in recording and reporting financial information, \nand deficiencies in internal controls and audit. To mitigate financial management risks, the \nPMU, supported by a finance officer engaged under the project, will ensure the accuracy of \nproject accounts. Direct payment and reimbursement procedures shall be used for all works, \ngoods, and services except for sanitation maintenance contracts which will be funded through \nthe SMF. \n \n25.  Procurement capacity. A procurement capacity assessment of MFED and MPWU was \nundertaken, which is included in the PAM. Given identified procurement capacity gaps, ADB will \nadminister selection of project management and implementation consultants. Procurement of \ngoods and works will be managed by the project support consultant located in the PMU within \nthe MFED, with close oversight by ADB. A procurement review for effective implementation will \nbe carried out during the midterm review. \n \n26.  Weakly performing country. Kiribati is recognized as a fragile state, as described in \nADB\u2019s  Achieving  Development  Effectiveness  in  Weakly  Performing  Countries.14 Factors \ncontributing to the country\u2019s fragile situation were assessed and taken into consideration in the \ndesign of the project. \n \n27.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto,  and  discussed  with,  the  government  and  MFED.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  The  project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  provide  social  benefits  through \nimproved sanitation and hygiene practices and enhancing access to improved sanitation among \nSouth Tarawa\u2019s population. This is expected to result in significant health improvements among \nthe local population. Improved productivity through a reduction in lost days of work as a result of \nillness or caring for sick family members, and reduced expenditure on medical treatment, are \nalso expected to reduce poverty. \n \n29.  Gender. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The majority of \nproject  outputs  have  specific  gender  design  features  to  facilitate  and  ensure  women\u2019s \nparticipation in, and access to, project benefits. The GAP will ensure that any potentially harmful \neffects on women are avoided, with specific actions that will allow women to benefit from the \nproject. The GAP includes awareness and behavior change campaigns, the recruitment of \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2007.

Safeguards \n \n30.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) because it will not result in any significant environmental \nimpacts,  and  all  potential  impacts  can  be  adequately  mitigated  and  monitored.  Initial \nenvironmental examinations have been prepared for core subproject civil works in accordance \nwith the environmental assessment and review framework that has been prepared to guide the \nassessment of subsequent subprojects.15 The environmental assessment found that the project \nwill improve the overall environmental quality of freshwater and nearshore marine areas through \nimproved sewage and sanitation facilities. Some impacts are expected near the sewerage \noutfalls but these are expected to be minimal because the outfalls are located more than 100 \nmeters  (m)  offshore  and  25  m  deep  to  enable  high  levels  of  dilution.  A  climate  change \nadaptation risk evaluation was conducted and considered in infrastructure design. \n \n31.  Involuntary  resettlement. The project is classified  as category B according to the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. It is expected to have minimal involuntary resettlement impacts, as \nthe  project facilities  will  be rehabilitated  on existing footprints  mostly on government  land. \nGovernment lands that will be used are uninhabited and devoid of crops and other assets. \nHowever, acquisition of a few parcels of private land and provisions for temporary access and \nuse during construction will result in minor resettlement impacts. A resettlement plan has been \nprepared for the sample subproject based on assessment of impacts and consultations with \naffected  persons.16  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  providing  guidelines  on \nscreening,  assessment,  and  preparation  of  resettlement  plans,  if  needed,  for  additional \nsubprojects  that  will  be  selected  during  implementation. 17   Affected  people  and  local \nstakeholders have been consulted and provided with relevant information. \n \n32.  Indigenous  peoples. The project is classified as category C. The people of South \nTarawa are from a single ethnic group. There are no customary, cultural, economic, social, or \npolitical institutions that set South Tarawa apart from the rest of Kiribati society. \n \n33.  All safeguard documents have been endorsed by the MFED, the executing agency, and \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The project will support the capacity of MFED and MPWU, the \nimplementing agency, to manage safeguards. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The expected benefits of the project \noutweigh the associated risks. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n15 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures\n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInsufficient procurement  An  international  procurement  specialist  will  be  recruited  to \ncapacity causes delays in  support  the  PMU.
