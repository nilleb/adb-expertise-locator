The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Institutional \nStrengthening of Road Safety and Gender Equality, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \nThe  project  will  support  capacity,  quality,  and  safety  improvements  of  the  East\u2013West \n2. \nHighway (EWH), which is the main domestic and international trade corridor of Nepal, and which \nforms part of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) corridor 4 linking \nKathmandu to Dhaka  and  Chittagong through India.1 The  project  will  (i)  rehabilitate  and  widen \nabout 87 kilometers (km) of the EWH between Kanchanpur and Kamala in southeastern Nepal; \n(ii) improve road safety and gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) on the 1,027 km EWH; \nand (iii) strengthen the road safety and GESI capacity of road sector agencies. The project will \npromote economic growth and contribute to improving the competitiveness of Nepal\u2019s exporting \nindustries by enhancing the efficiency of the transport system, strengthening national and regional \nconnectivity, and improving the safety of the road network. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nContext. Nepal is landlocked and bordered to the north by the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), and to the south, east, and west by India. Consequently, Nepal relies heavily on its direct \nneighbors for international trade\u2014particularly India, with which it shares 19 official trading posts. \nIn fiscal year (FY) 2017, 65% of Nepal\u2019s imports were from India, and 13% from the PRC; India \nreceived  57%  of  Nepal\u2019s  exports,  and  the  PRC  2.3%.  Biratnagar,  located  68  km  east  of \nKanchanpur, is Nepal\u2019s largest export gateway, handling 29.5% of its exports, while the port of \nKolkata is the primary transit point for seaborne freight. \n \n4. \nEconomic rationale. The gross domestic product of Nepal grew at an average annual \nrate  of  4.5%  during  FY2007\u2013FY2017  and  is  forecast  to  grow  at  5.9%  in  FY2018  and  5.5%  in \nFY2019.2 The economy of Nepal suffers from a structural lack of competitiveness\u2014exports have \nalarmingly decreased at an average annual rate of 6.1% in real terms during FY2007\u2013FY2017, \nwhile the agriculture sector still employs 69.4% of the labor force. The trade deficit is widening, \nas foreign remittances have sustained import growth, which increased by 21.3% annually during \nFY2007\u2013FY2017.3  The  economy  is  hampered  by  deficient  domestic  and  cross-border \ninfrastructure networks, which increase transport costs and impede regional integration and trade \nwith indirect neighbors: excluding India, trade with other SASEC and SAARC member countries \naccounts for just 0.8% of Nepal\u2019s total trade.4 \n \n5. \nTransport sector. Road transport carries over 90% of passengers and goods in Nepal. \nThe strategic road network (SRN) totals 12,494 km, 51% of which is paved, and is developed and \n\n                                                \n1  SAARC Secretariat. 2006.

Nepal  Foreign  Trade  Statistics,  Fiscal  Year  2016/17. \nKathmandu. SASEC members are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka; SAARC \ncomprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. \n\n\fmaintained  by  the  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  of  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Infrastructure  and \nTransport (MOPIT). The SRN provides vital linkages to major economic centers and neighboring \ncountries, and features eight north\u2013south and three east\u2013west corridors, including the 1,027 km-\nlong  EWH  which  carries  the  highest  traffic  volumes.  The  local  road  network  totals  57,600  km, \n3.5% of which is paved. The road density of Nepal, at 2.5 km of road per 1,000 people, is low, \nand there are few alternatives to road transport.5 Although projects supported by development \npartners are expected to increase the capacity and density of airport, railway, and inland waterway \nnetworks, road transport will continue to have a major role in the economic development of Nepal.6 \n \nRoad  safety.  Vehicle  ownership  remains  low,  with  only  0.08  vehicles  per  capita,  but \n6. \nvehicle sales increased by 17.5% annually during FY2007\u2013FY2017, and the number of registered \nvehicles is expected to quadruple in the next decade.7 Motorcycles account for 79.7% of sales, \nwhich further increases road safety risks, particularly on deteriorated or wet pavements. The traffic \nfatality rate is estimated at 302 fatalities per 100,000 vehicles, one of the highest rates in Asia, \nand  reported  traffic  accidents  increased  from  3,800  in  FY2002  to  13,580  in  FY2013.8  The \ngovernment  responded  by  preparing  a  Road  Safety  Action  Plan  (2013\u20132020),  but  its  effective \nimplementation requires broader institutional support and capacity strengthening, notably through \nthe operationalization of the road safety council. \n \n7. \nSector road map and regional cooperation. The development of the SRN is guided by \nNepal\u2019s National Transport Policy (2002), Priority Investment Plan (2007\u20132016), and MOPIT\u2019s 5-\nyear strategic plan.9 The road sector strategy of the  Fourteenth Plan (FY2017\u2013FY2019) of the \ngovernment aims to (i) expand the SRN and improve interprovincial and national connectivity; (ii) \nstrengthen regional integration; (iii) reconstruct roads damaged by the April 2015 earthquake; (iv) \nprovide greater access to social services and markets; (v) improve road safety and maintenance; \nand (vi) support the development of the agriculture, industry, energy, and tourism sectors.10 The \nallocation for capital expenditures increased from 22.7% of the government\u2019s budget in FY2015 \nto 27.1% in FY2019 to support these objectives. The road sector strategy is aligned with regional \npolicies,  including  SASEC  objectives  of facilitating  trade  and  improving  access  to  national  and \ntransnational markets via development of multimodal transport systems.11 \n \n8. \nProject design. The project road carries an average annual daily traffic of 8,590 vehicles, \nincluding about 28% of heavy vehicles, and this total is forecasted to increase to 25,400 vehicles \nby 2033. The pavement is in fair to poor condition, and the road does not segregate slow-moving \nvehicles  and  pedestrians.  Through  the  project,  the  road  will  be  upgraded  to  a  four-lane  dual \ncarriageway to cater to the projected increase in traffic demand, and rehabilitated with improved \npavement,  drainage,  structures,  and  safety  features.  Service  lanes  in  populated  areas  will \nimprove  safety,  particularly  for  pedestrians,  and  bicycle  and  motorcycle  users.  Civil  works \ncontracts  will  include  a  performance-based  maintenance  period  of  5  years  after  completion  of \nconstruction.  The  project  will  support  economic  growth  by  (i)  rehabilitating  deteriorated  road \n\n                                                \n5  This compares with 12.2 km of road per 1,000 people in Bhutan, 4.1 km in India, and 5.5 km in Sri Lanka. \n6  The railway network is small (59 km). During 2011\u20132016, (i) international air travel increased by 5.4% annually, from \n2.70 million to 3.51 million passengers, but capacity constraints at the only international airport in Kathmandu impede \ngrowth; and (ii) domestic air travel increased by 2.0% annually, from 1.59 million to 1.76 million passengers. \n7  Vehicle ownership in India is about 0.42 vehicles per capita, and 0.80 vehicles per capita in the United States. \n8  World Health Organization. 2015.

The project is consistent with the objectives set out in the country \n9. \npartnership strategy, and is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations \nbusiness  plan  for  Nepal,  2018\u20132020  and  SASEC\u2019s  operational  plan  2016\u20132025.12  ADB  has \nprovided ongoing assistance for the development of the strategic road sector through (i) a project \napproved in 2016 for $186.8 million for the rehabilitation and upgrading of 114 km of the EWH to \nthe west of Narayanghat,13 (ii) three projects approved during 2010\u20132015 for a total of $324 million \nfor  the  reconstruction  of  other  major  roads  of  the  SRN,  and  (iii)  a  project  preparatory  facility \napproved  in  2010  for  $12  million.14  The  project  incorporates  lessons  from  previous  projects, \nnotably  related  to  procurement,  project  readiness,  land  acquisition,  and  sustainability.15  ADB\u2019s \nassistance is expected to continue beyond the project, and a consulting services package will be \nprovided under the loan to prepare the detailed design for the remaining sections of the EWH to \nthe east of Narayanghat, proposed for subsequent projects. \n \n10. \nValue added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s value addition includes improved road design \nfor climate change adaptation, and improved road safety and maintenance planning capacity. The \nattached  TA  will  strengthen  the  road  safety  and  GESI  capacity  of  MOPIT  and  DOR  at  policy, \nmanagement,  and  operational  levels,  and  improve  the  facilities  and  project  readiness  of  the \nProject Directorate (ADB) of DOR. The national road safety policy will be reviewed, and a road \nsafety  assessment  conducted for the  1,027 km-long  EWH corridor.  Civil  works  and  equipment \npackages provided under the loan will help mitigate road accident blackspots. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with the  following  impacts:  (i)  transport  connectivity  within  Nepal \nand  with  neighboring  countries  improved  (footnote  10),  and  (ii)  physical  connectivity  and \nmultimodal linkages for land-based transport along major trade routes enhanced (footnote 11). \nThe project outcome will be: efficiency and safety of the road transport system improved.16 \n \nC. \n \n12. \nOutput  1:  Road  network  upgraded  and  maintained.  The  loan  will  rehabilitate  and \nupgrade  about  87  km  of  road  between  Kanchanpur  and  Kamala  on  the  EWH  to  a  four-lane \nstandard, and include a 5-year performance-based maintenance period following construction. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2017.

The  project  road  will  be  widened \nfrom two to four lanes, and the completed road will have a design speed of 100 km per hour, dual \ncarriageways separated by a 3.0 meters median, 3.0 meters shoulders on both sides, and new \npavements. The project will integrate safe and socially inclusive design features, such as 42 km \nof  footpaths,  69  km  of  service  lanes  segregating  slow-moving  vehicles,  46  disabled-friendly \npedestrian crossings, 92 sheltered bus stops, and reflective lane markers. \n \n22. \nThe project road is in a tropical climate zone with moderate to high rainfall, and in a seismic \narea  with  comparatively  lower  risk  than  other  areas  of  Nepal.  Increased  temperatures  are  the \nmain climate risk in southeastern Nepal, with temperatures forecast to increase by an average of \n1.2\u00b0C\u20131.7\u00b0C during 2019\u20132050. Engineering designs also integrate climate adaptation measures \nto  minimize  climate  change  risks,  including  bioengineering  techniques,  and  increased \nembankment and bridge heights, and increased cross-drainage specifications. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic viability. The economic evaluation of the project was conducted in accordance \n23. \nwith ADB guidelines by comparing life cycle economic costs and benefits in with- and without- \nproject scenarios, using a 9.0% discount rate and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as \ndecision criteria.23 The highway development model 4 (HDM-4) was used to estimate road agency \nand  road  user  costs  based  on  input  data  on  traffic;  road  geometry;  pavement  condition;  and \nmaintenance, improvement, and operating costs. Project benefits include savings associated with \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n20 Such as international road assessment program (iRAP) or other data- or evidence-based framework. \n21 Government of Nepal, MOPIT. 2017.

Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\n(i)  vehicle  operating  costs,  (ii)  travel  time,  and  (iii)  road  accidents  (unquantified).  Project \ndisbenefits  include  a  net  increase  in  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  The  EIRR  of  the  project  is \nestimated at 13.4%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the economic viability of \nthe project under adverse changes in costs and benefits, with an EIRR of 11.3% under the most \nsensitive scenario involving a 10% increase in capital costs and 10% decrease in benefits.  \n \n24. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  project  is  not  revenue-generating.  The  Roads  Board  of \nNepal funds maintenance from allocations of the Ministry of Finance and from toll revenues. The \nannual  budget  for  the  maintenance  of  the  SRN  increased  from  NRs2.61  billion  in  FY2012  to \nNRs5.50 billion in FY2019 in nominal terms, equal to an annual growth of 4.7% in real terms. The \naverage  annual  incremental  recurrent  costs  of  the  project  are  estimated  at  1.1%  of  the \nmaintenance  budget  of  DOR,  and  it  is  thus  reasonable  to  expect  that  the  budget  allocation  of \nDOR will be able to meet the incremental maintenance costs of the project, particularly as the \nEWH is the main trade corridor of Nepal. Civil works contracts include 5 years of performance-\nbased  maintenance  after  construction;  this  will  promote  maintenance  in  the  initial  operating \nphase.  The  project  management  unit  will  also  engage  a  consultant  to  strengthen  road  asset \nmanagement.  The  project  will  thus  improve  DOR\u2019s  asset  management  capacity,  and  promote \nprivate sector participation in the maintenance of the project road with the supervision of DOR. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nInstitutional  capacity.  The  2015  Constitution  introduced  three  tiers  of  government. \nAssociated legal, institutional, financial, and administrative procedures are still being finalized, but \nhighways  will  remain  a  federal  responsibility,  under  MOPIT  and  DOR.  The  Project  Directorate \n(ADB) of DOR, which handles project management for ADB strategic road sector projects, has \ngood technical capacity and significant experience implementing ADB projects. Its project director \nreports to the director general of DOR, who in turn reports to the Secretary of MOPIT. The capacity \nof DOR will be strengthened by consulting service contracts for detailed design and construction \nsupervision, which include training in design, contract management, and quality assurance. \n \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  risk  is  moderate,  as  DOR  has \n26. \nadequate  capacity  in  accounting  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures.  All  transactions  are \nrecorded by government accounting systems, reflected in the government accounts, and subject \nto  statutory  audit  by  the  comptroller.  The  project  management  unit  prepares  annual  project \nfinancial  statements for development  partner  projects,  which are  subject to audit  by the  Nepal \nOffice of the Auditor General. Improvements are required in internal audit, accounting systems, \nand  staff  understanding  of  ADB  policies  and  procedures.  The  project  will  engage  a  full-time \nfinancial expert to conduct internal checks and controls, and improve the integration of project \naccounting with DOR\u2019s financial management information systems. \n \nProcurement. Procurement and consultant recruitment will be conducted in accordance \n27. \nwith  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement \nRegulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  amended  Public \nProcurement  Act  (2017)  and  Public  Procurement  Regulations  (2017)  of  Nepal  are  generally \nacceptable  to  ADB  and  encompass  best  international  procurement  practices.  Department  of \nRoads  has  significant  experience  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  requirements,  and  the  project \nprocurement  risk  is  moderate.  All  consulting  firms  will  be  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  method  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10.  Advance  actions  for  the  recruitment  of \nconstruction  supervision  consultants  started  in  May  2018,  and  for  the  recruitment  of  detailed \ndesign consultants in July 2018. Invitation for bids for the civil works packages of the project road \nwas published in September 2018. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n28. \nwith the government and MOPIT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nPoverty. The direct area of influence of the project includes 522,206 residents living in 12 \nmunicipalities crossed by the project road in two districts. About 36.5% of residents live below the \nnational poverty standard line, above the national average of 25.2%. The major income sources \nare  remittances  (47%),  trade  (20%),  agriculture  (13%),  and  services  (9%).  Access  to  modern \nsanitation  (48%)  and  piped  water  (10%)  remains  limited.  The  project  is  expected  to  improve \naccess to economic opportunities and social services, reduce intraregional disparities, and create \nan estimated 4.43 million person-days of skilled and unskilled employment during construction. \n \nGender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A poverty and social \n30. \nanalysis assessed the socioeconomic characteristics of 2,479 women. The mobility of women in \nthe project area is primarily limited to visiting nearby markets, district health and administrative \nservices, and relatives. Walking is the predominant mode of transport, while buses are also used \nby about 70% of women and biking is popular among schoolgirls. Gender benefits of the project \ninclude  improved  public  transport  accessibility,  improved  access  to  services  and  markets, \nimproved safety of the urban environment, and specific activities included in a gender action plan: \n(i)  pedestrian-friendly  design  features  for  the  project  road,  (ii)  gender-friendly  features  for  the \ndesign of service areas along the EWH, (iii) a pilot capacity-building program for women\u2019s groups \nin the project  area,  (iv) gender targets  in construction  activities and  tree  plantation, (v) gender \ntargets in the awareness campaigns conducted under the project, and (vi) implementation of the \nGESI  operational  guidelines.24  Gender,  social  development,  livelihood  restoration,  and  road \nsafety awareness experts will be hired to implement the gender action plan. \n \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS  in Nepal  is low,  with a \n31. \nrate of 0.2% in the population aged 15\u201349.25 About 28 cases of HIV/AIDS were recorded in the \ndistricts  affected  by  the  project.  Human  trafficking  is  an  important  problem  in  Nepal,  with  an \nestimated  5,957  cases  of  abducted  persons  in  FY2016  (80%  involving  women  and  children). \nWhile the project will facilitate cross-border movements of people and require an important labor \nforce,  it  will  widen  an  existing  corridor  and  is  thus  not  expected  to  contribute  to  a  significant \nincrease in HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The GESI action plan includes the recruitment of a \nspecialized  nongovernment  organization  to  conduct  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking \nprevention  awareness  campaign  along  the  road  corridor.  The  contractors  will  further  conduct \nHIV/AIDS awareness sessions and provide voluntary testing and guidance to their workforce. \n \nE. \n \n32. \ncategories are as follows.26 \n \nEnvironment (category B). The project road will be constructed in the existing right-of-\n33. \nway and does not pass through or near protected areas. The environmental impacts of the project \nroad and the Project Directorate (ADB) building are not expected to be significant and irreversible, \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n24 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Government of Nepal, Ministry of Health and Education. 2014. Country Progress Report on HIV/AIDS. Kathmandu. \n26 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fand  will  be  mainly  restricted  to  the  construction  stage.  Other  anticipated  impacts  involve  dust, \nnoise, exhaust, construction and domestic waste, water contamination, occupational health and \nsafety, erosion, siltation, traffic congestion during construction, and air pollution during operation. \nInitial environmental examinations for the two subprojects were disclosed on the ADB website in \nJuly  2018,  and  include  environmental  management  plans  providing  mandatory  mitigation \nmeasures  to  be  implemented  by  contractors.  Concerns  voiced  by  affected  persons  and \nstakeholders during project preparation were incorporated in the design, and a grievance redress \nmechanism  will  alleviate  concerns  during  implementation.  About  5,600  trees  will  need  to  be \nremoved  and  a  compensatory  afforestation  program  will  be  implemented,  with  a  ratio  of  25 \nsaplings planted for each felled tree. \n \n34. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The project requires no land acquisition and has \nmoderate resettlement impacts. Of 479 affected households (2,492 persons), 25 households (130 \npersons)  will  be  significantly  affected,  and  will  have  to  rebuild  their  residence  or  commercial \nstructure outside the corridor of impact. Project impacts will otherwise be mostly minor on 454 \nnon-titled  households  (2,362  persons),  including  205  households  (43%)  that  need  to  relocate \nmoveable commercial kiosks. Only 25% of surveyed affected households are vulnerable. Other \nimpacts include partial impacts to commercial structures (43%) and impacts on fruit trees (15%); \n125  community  structures  will  have  to  be  rebuilt,  including  tube  wells  and  other  government \nstructures (52%), resting places (30%), and temples (18%). \n \n35. \nA resettlement plan was prepared for the project road and disclosed on the ADB website \nin June 2018.27 The entitlement matrix provided under the resettlement plan includes mitigation \nmeasures  and  resettlement  assistance  commensurate  with  the  project  impacts;  incorporates \nlessons from  previous  projects;  and  provides  compensation  at  replacement  cost for  structures \nand trees, shifting and reconstruction assistance, and shifting and loss of income allowance for \nmoveable kiosks. It also includes special measures for significantly affected households that must \nrebuild their  commercial  structure  or  residence,  including  (i) financial  assistance for  temporary \nloss  of  income  and  subsistence  allowance,  and  (ii)  additional  financial  assistance  and  skill \nenhancement training for vulnerable households. Due diligence for the resettlement impacts of \nthe Project Directorate (ADB) office was carried out and disclosed on the ADB website. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project road does not cross traditional customary \n36. \nor tribal lands. The social impact assessment established that only 45 indigenous households are \ndirectly  affected  by  the project, representing  10%  of  affected  households;  their  socioeconomic \ncharacteristics are similar to those of the wider society, and they are well integrated, will not be \nimpacted differently, and will benefit equally from the project. \n \n37. \nImplementation. Implementation of the environmental safeguards and resettlement plan \nwill be overseen by DOR. The Project Directorate (ADB) will be supported by resettlement and \nenvironment  specialists  in  guiding  and  reviewing  the  implementation  of  safeguard  plans  and \ndocumentation.  The  construction  supervision  consultant  will  include  a  team  of  environmental, \ngender,  resettlement,  social  experts,  and  field  mobilizers  to  assist  DOR  in  implementing  and \nmonitoring  safeguard  and  GESI  activities.  Contractors  will  be  required  to  have  environmental, \nhealth,  and  safety  officers  to  ensure  the  environmental  management  plan  is  properly \nimplemented.  The  government  will  finance  and  implement  environmental  and  resettlement \nactivities. Detailed implementation arrangements are in the PAM. \n \n\n                                                \n27 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nF. \n \n38. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nBehavioral change \ntowards road safety \nmay extend beyond the \nproject timeline \n\nHigh turnover of project \nmanagement staff may \nlower the priority given \nto road safety \nInadequate \nmaintenance may \naffect road utilization in \nthe long term  \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe project will carry out a broad range of activities to address institutional and \nmanagement gaps, including the preparation of a national road safety policy, \nstrategy and action plan, and the strengthening of the road safety council. The \nproject will also conduct a survey to assess the behavior of road users towards \nroad safety, prepare road safety awareness campaign materials, and carry out \nawareness campaigns to contribute to behavioral change. \nThe government and the Asian Development Bank have agreed on a specific \nloan category allocation to ensure that the recommendations identified during \nroad safety audits of the East\u2013West Highway are effectively implemented by \nthe Department of Roads. \nThe pavement of the project road has been designed for 20-year durability. \nCivil works contracts include 1-year of defect liability and 5-year of \nperformance-based maintenance under the responsibility of the contractors. \nThe project will also monitor the periodic maintenance backlog to mitigate \nfinancial sustainability risks. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n39. \nThe government and MOPIT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n40. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n\nThe government and MOPIT have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n41. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$180,000,000  to  Nepal  for  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Highway \nImprovement  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  concessional  terms,  with  an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; \nfor a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to \nthe Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n 11 September 2018 \n\n                                                \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n(i) \n\ntransport connectivity within Nepal and with neighboring countries improved (Fourteenth Plan \nFY2017\u20132019);a and \n\n(ii)  physical connectivity and multimodal linkages for land-based transport along major trade routes \n\nenhanced (SASEC Operational Plan 2016\u20132025)b \n\nResults Chain \n\nOutcome \nEfficiency and \nsafety of the \nroad transport \nsystem \nimproved \n\nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and Baselines \n\nBy 2024: \na.
