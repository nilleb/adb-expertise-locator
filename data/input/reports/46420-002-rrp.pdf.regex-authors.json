I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nemergency assistance loan (EAL) to the Republic of the Philippines for the KALAHI\u2013CIDSS \nNational  Community-Driven  Development  Project  (the  project).1 The  EAL  will  support  the \nimplementation of the government\u2019s KALAHI\u2013CIDSS National Community-Driven Development \nProject  (KC-NCDDP)  to  restore  basic social  services  and  rebuild  communities  affected  by \nTyphoon Yolanda (international name: Haiyan).2  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Overall development context. The Philippines is a lower middle-income country with a \nhuman development index of 0.654, placing it 114th out of 187 countries.3 From 2003 to 2012, \nthe country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 5.2%, but \npoverty  incidence  increased  from  24.9%  to  27.9%.4 Incomes  and  poverty  incidence  differ \nsignificantly across provinces. Many geographically isolated, hazard-prone, or conflict-affected \nareas and indigenous peoples\u2019 ancestral domains have very limited health services, low female \nparticipation in the workforce and local politics, and wide gender wage gaps. Progress lags in \nmeeting Millennium Development Goals on poverty, universal primary education, and maternal \nhealth. Limited access to basic services is a key cause of poverty and inequality in the country.5 \nGovernment estimates indicate that about 45% of the population is vulnerable to falling into \npoverty  if  confronted  by  external  shocks  such  as  health  problems,  family  deaths,  loss  of \nemployment, and disasters.6 \n3.  Vulnerability to natural hazards. The Philippines is one of the world\u2019s most natural-\nhazard-prone countries. It ranks third on the global disaster risk index, behind Vanuatu and \nTonga.7 Nearly 60% of the total land area is exposed to multiple hazards such as floods, \nearthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions; about 74% of the population is vulnerable to \ndisasters. About 1,000 lives, on average, are lost annually because of disasters. The country \nexperiences about 20 typhoons every year. Tropical cyclones and associated flooding account \nfor about 75% of recorded deaths and 63% of damage. The annual cost of disasters to the \neconomy  is  estimated  at  0.7%\u20131%  of  GDP.8 The  frequency  and  ferocity  of  the  disasters \noverstretch the capacity and resources of national and local governments to respond effectively.  \n4.  Typhoon Yolanda. On 8 November 2013, Typhoon Yolanda hit the central Philippines, \nleaving behind an unprecedented path of destruction. An initial disaster needs assessment has \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The National Economic and Development Authority Board approved the KC-NCDDP on 18 January 2013. The design \nof KC-NCDDP has been adjusted to support the post-disaster efforts of the government. More broadly, the KC-\nNCDDP aims to bring about more equitable access to basic services and reduce poverty. \n3  United Nations Development Programme. 2013. Human Development Report.

National Assessment on the State of Disaster \nRisk Management in the Philippines. Final Report. Manila.  ", "2 \nbeen carried out.9 As of 1 December 2013, the death toll stood at 5,632, with another 1,759 still \nmissing, 26,136 injured, and about 890,000 families or 4.11 million people displaced.10 The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) estimated that an additional 1.5 million persons may have \nfallen into poverty immediately after Typhoon Yolanda\u2014a 24% increase in the number of poor \nin central Philippines and 7.1% nationwide. Preliminary government estimates indicate that \nTyphoon Yolanda and other recent disasters may have cut the national economic growth rate by \n0.3\u20130.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2013 alone, which is equivalent to $900 \nmillion\u2013$2.5 billion of lost GDP in 2013. ADB\u2019s preliminary forecast for 2014 is that the drop in \nthe GDP growth rate could be as high as 1 percentage point. The combined regional economies \nof Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, and Western Visayas\u2014which account for 12.5% of the \ncountry\u2019s GDP\u2014could shrink by 4.0%\u20138.0% in 2014. The Eastern Visayas\u2019 economy could \ncontract by 30.0% or more in 2014. \n5.  Improving service delivery and responding to post-disaster needs. Community-\ndriven development (CDD) approaches have been used to address bottlenecks in the local \ndelivery of basic services.11 The CDD principles of participatory planning and community control \nof investment resources are being applied in the Philippines by the government\u2019s Kapit-Bisig \nLaban sa Kahirapan (Linking Arms Against Poverty)\u2013Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of \nSocial Services (KALAHI\u2013CIDSS) project, managed by the Department of Social Welfare and \nDevelopment  (DSWD).12 KALAHI\u2013CIDSS13 has  improved  basic  service  delivery,  effectively \ntargeted poor communities, and responded to the needs of poor households, lessening the \ninfluence of patronage in resource allocation and job creation.14 The government identifies CDD \nas a pillar of the country\u2019s development and poverty reduction strategy, and is expanding \nKALAHI\u2013CIDSS operations into the KC-NCDDP.  \n6.  In the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda, the KC-NCDDP will use CDD to support recovery \nand rehabilitation efforts in affected communities. International experience demonstrates the \neffectiveness of CDD in responding to disaster situations and reducing disaster risks. CDD is \nuseful in emergency and post-calamity situations for the following reasons: (i) a community is \nthe first to experience a disaster and the first to respond, (ii) communities have indigenous \nknowledge of hazards and mitigation, (iii) involving affected communities in determining needs \nand priorities helps ensure the appropriateness and sustainability of disaster responses, and   \n(iv) organized communities are better able to demand downward accountability.15  \n7.  The presence of CDD projects, especially in poor, remote, and disaster-prone areas, \nalso makes them well positioned to urgently respond to post-disaster needs and facilitate the \ncoordination  and  cohesiveness  of  assistance. CDD  projects that  have  established  efficient \n                                                \n9   Summary Initial Disaster Needs Assessment (supplementary appendix accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n10  National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, Situation Report No. 49. 1 December 2013.  \n11  Sector Assessment (Summary): Community-Driven Development (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n12  KALAHI\u2013CIDSS was launched in 2002, with cofinancing from the World Bank. In 2004, the Spanish Agency for \nInternational Development Cooperation provided financing to it under the Empowerment and Development of \nCommunities Project. In 2010, the World Bank provided additional financing to KALAHI\u2013CIDSS until May 2014; the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation provided parallel financing. By December 2012, KALAHI\u2013CIDSS had covered \n8,435 barangays in 364 poor municipalities and supported 8,776 subprojects, reaching 1.95 million households. \nSome subprojects have helped address community needs in response to disasters. \n13 Overview  of  Community-Driven  Development  and  the  Kapit-Bisig  Laban  sa  Kahirapan\u2013Comprehensive  and \nIntegrated Delivery of Social Services Project (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  The benefits derived from KALAHI\u2013CIDSS are summarized in Overview of Community-Driven Development and the \nKALAHI\u2013CIDSS Project (supplementary appendix accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15  World Bank. 2009. Building Resilient Communities: Risk Management and Response to Natural Disasters through \nSocial Funds and Community-Driven Development Operations. Washington DC.  \n ", "3 \nmanagement systems, including flexible procurement and disbursement procedures, can be \ntapped to quickly mobilize resources after a disaster. Indonesia expanded CDD programs to \nrespond to urgent recovery needs after five major disasters from 2004 to 2010.16 The post-\ndisaster experience of Aceh and Nias highlighted the following outcomes of CDD programs:       \n(i) fully disbursed funds ahead of schedule, (ii) more outputs delivered than other programs, and \n(iii) greater transparency and accountability than most other government projects.17    \n8.  With the presence of KALAHI\u2013CIDSS in about 90% of the Yolanda-affected areas, and \nbuilding on the long-running KALAHI\u2013CIDSS management systems, the KC-NCDDP will be well \npositioned to address the post-disaster needs of communities. The KC-NCDDP will provide \nsupport for recovery and rehabilitation activities in more than 14,000 barangays (villages) in \nmore than 500 municipalities across 39 provinces affected by the typhoon, covering about 3.3 \nmillion households. It will provide (i) grants for planning and implementing CDD subprojects,      \n(ii) capacity building and implementation support, and (iii) program management monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E).  \n \n9.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  by \nassisting  the  government  with  restoring  and  rebuilding  economic,  social,  and  governance \nactivities in typhoon-affected communities.18 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s sector and thematic \nassessments, which stress strengthening capacity for disaster risk management, and promoting \ngender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. ADB has closely coordinated with the government \nand other development partners in the design of the KC-NCDDP, as well as in rehabilitation and \nrecovery  efforts.19 The  project  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  Yolanda  Recovery  and \nRehabilitation Plan. \n10.  ADB\u2019s response includes the immediate deployment of the Typhoon Yolanda Response \nTeam and the following development assistance: (i) a $3 million grant from the Asia Pacific \nDisaster Response Fund to help meet immediate expenses to restore life-saving services, (ii) a \n$500 million EAL to support the post-disaster efforts of the government, and (iii) a $20 million \ngrant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to provide affected people in Eastern Visayas \nwith  access  to  emergency  support  and  early  recovery  systems.  ADB\u2019s  support  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s conditional cash transfer program partially funds 200,000 families in the affected \nareas, with at least 69,000 households in the severely affected areas.20 In collaboration with \nother development partners, ADB assisted the government in the preparation of the Yolanda \nRecovery Rehabilitation Plan. ADB has ongoing and planned operations in the affected areas. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be improved resiliency of poor communities to natural hazards. The \noutcome will be improved access to services and infrastructure for communities in affected \n                                                \n16  These are (i) Aceh tsunami in December 2004, (ii) North Sumatra and Aceh earthquake in March 2005, (iii) Java \nearthquake in May 2006, (iv) West Java tsunami in July 2006, and (v) Mt.

Output  1:  Community-driven  development  subprojects  selected,  implemented, \nand  completed.  Planning  and  investment  grants  will  be  provided  to  more  than  6,000 \nbarangays, benefiting about 900,000 households. Planning grants will support participatory and \ngender-inclusive planning by barangay residents as well as technical assistance to ensure \neffective subproject selection and implementation. Investment grants will support subprojects \nand activities that respond to community priorities.21 Rehabilitation and recovery efforts will \nemphasize  building  back  better  and  disaster-resilient  community  infrastructure.  Subproject \neligibility will be based on an open menu and subject to an exclusion list.22 The open menu will \ninclude community proposals on disaster response and risk reduction.  \n13.  Community planning will be facilitated in barangays. The KC-NCDDP staff will undertake \ncommunity organization and facilitation in cooperation with community volunteers trained in \nparticipatory planning and subproject preparation and implementation. Community subprojects \nwill be identified and selected for submission to a municipal forum. Community leaders and \nvolunteers selected by barangay residents will represent their barangay in the forum where \nsubprojects will be prioritized based on size of the investment grant allocated to the municipality \nand locally agreed selection criteria.23 Program staff will undertake due diligence on subprojects \nbefore  funding  is  committed. 24 Barangays  with  prioritized  subprojects  will  organize \nimplementation teams to supervise and administer the subprojects. \n14.  Output 2: Institutional and organizational capacity strengthened. The project will \nsupport capacity development of municipal DSWD program staff who will provide facilitation \nsupport,  technical  assistance,  subproject  oversight,  and  local  coordination.25 About  4,000 \nprogram staff and their local government counterparts will be trained in CDD, development \nplanning and management, conflict resolution, mediation within and between barangays, quality \nreview, local poverty assessment, and M&E. Program staff and stakeholders will be trained to (i) \ndevelop competencies in disaster-risk management; (ii) apply environmental and social safeguard \npolicies; (iii) respond to special circumstances such as vulnerability to natural hazards and climate \nchange,  presence  of  indigenous  communities,  and  areas  affected  by  conflict;  (iv)  facilitate \ncommunity  organization  to  ensure  the  inclusion  and  participation  of  marginalized  groups  in \nsubprojects; and (v) embed participatory approaches in government systems and processes. \n                                                \n21 Investment grant amounts are based on a formula using population size and poverty incidence.  \n \n22The open menu of subprojects includes community water systems, schools, daycare centers, health stations, \n \nelectrification, tribal housing, access roads, small bridges or footbridges, pre- and post-harvest facilities, equipment \nand materials support, irrigation, drainage, sanitation, flood control, seawalls, soil protection, and artificial coral reef \nsanctuaries. In the aftermath of disasters, the menu may be adjusted to allow investments needed or justified in a \npost-disaster or emergency context (e.g., repair of public buildings, debris removal, shelter construction and repairs, \nuse of chainsaws for cutting fallen trees), including investments for cash for work or food for work, as mutually agreed \nby DSWD and ADB. The exclusion list includes activities that may be harmful to the environment or indigenous \npeoples such as weapons, chainsaws, explosives, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, asbestos, and other potentially \ndangerous materials and equipment; fishing boats and nets exceeding the government-prescribed size and weight; \nroad construction into protected areas; political and religious activities, rallies, and materials; and activities employing \nchildren under 16 or unfairly exploiting women or men of any age.  \n23 Paras. 29 to 30 of the project administration manual discuss subproject selection criteria and process. \n24 This will comprise technical, economic, social, and financial viability assessments, including safeguard compliance. \n25 In response to a government request, a capacity development technical assistance project for $1.5 million will be \nprepared and financed separately. It will complement capacity development under the KC-NCDDP with the (i) \nformulation of a learning and development framework, (ii) completion of curriculum design and learning modules, and \n(iii) establishment of institutional support systems.  \n ", "5 \nThe project will strengthen the KC-NCDDP\u2019s financial management system, grievance redress \nand social accountability mechanisms, and knowledge development and exchange. \n15.  Output 3: Program management and monitoring and evaluation systems enhanced. \nThe  project  will  strengthen  program  management  and  M&E  systems  by  supporting  the \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  of  a  management  information  system  in  DSWD  for  tracking, \nmeasuring, and reporting progress using key performance indicators. The system will include \nnational and regional electronic file management of community requests for fund release and \nsupporting documents. The project will also support third party M&E, at least one special study, \nand capital expenditure requirements for program management. The KC-NCDDP operations \nmanuals have been updated and harmonized with ADB policies and procedures. \nD.   Investment and Financing Plans \n16.  The  government  requested  an  EAL26of  $372,103,895  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources with a 4-year implementation period, to respond to post-disaster needs of affected \ncommunities through the KC-NCDDP, including taxes and duties.27 The loan will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, custom tailored repayment method, an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending facility, \na commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \nloan agreement. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 18.97 years and the maturity \npremium payable to ADB is 0.20% per annum. The project is estimated to cost $663.838 million, \nwith the government providing $291.7 million in counterpart financing (including taxes duties \nand financing charges.28 The project investment plan is in Table 1. The financing plan is in \nTable 2. The KC-NCDDP has an estimated cost of $1,132.0 million, of which the government \nwill finance 24% and the proposed EAL 33%. The government has requested the World Bank to \nfinance 42%, and the Government of Australia will provide a grant equal to 1%. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n18.  The  10-year  experience  of  KALAHI\u2013CIDSS  demonstrates  its  viability  and  cost-\neffectiveness for funding priority community investments. An external evaluation of KALAHI\u2013\nCIDSS concludes that (i) CDD subprojects yield economic internal rates of return of 16%\u201365% \nand  averaging  21%,  all  above  the  hurdle rate  of  15%  set  by the  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment Authority; (ii) the unit costs of CDD subprojects are lower than for traditionally \nprocured infrastructure projects, with cost savings ranging from 8% for school buildings to 76% \nfor water supply; (iii) investments in capacity development are associated with collective action, \nimproved  access  to  public  goods,  good  subproject  maintenance,  and  more  trust  among \ncommunity members; and (iv) social mobilization strengthens the match between demand for \npublic goods and their supply making resource allocation more efficient.32 \n19.  A  recent  impact  evaluation  of  KALAHI\u2013CIDSS  identifies  the  following  benefits:  (i) \nhousehold consumption increased by 12%; (ii) year-round road access improved by 9 percentage \npoints; (iii) higher employment rates, particularly among women; and (iv) increased marketing of \nlivestock and farm produce.33 The analysis of the project and its benefits (footnote 32) assesses it \nto be financially sustainable in view of (i) the demonstrated and expected benefits of CDD, (ii) \nincreased public spending on the social sector, (iii) the KC-NCDDP\u2019s relatively modest share of \ngovernment expenditures,34 and (iv) strong government commitment to use the KC-NCDDP as a \nplatform for addressing social development and broader poverty reduction needs. The use of the \nCDD approach in post-disaster rehabilitation is expected to generate similar (and possibly \nhigher) level of benefits from what has been experienced in regular situations. \nB.  Governance \n20.  Renewed national commitment to governance reform has helped improve the Philippine \ninvestment climate and achieve strong growth. However, significant challenges remain for public \naccountability  mechanisms,  government  agency  capacity  and  integrity,  public  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and local governance. DSWD is considered highly competent and \nwell governed, with many years of experience in effectively managing nationwide CDD and \nconditional cash transfer programs. DSWD also had many years of experience in post-disaster \nresponse. It has sound public financial management and procurement systems. Corruption has \n                                                \n \n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n33 J. Labonne. 2013.

The Integrity Development \nReview of DSWD and independent corruption surveys rated DSWD as among the cleanest \ngovernment agencies.35 DSWD engages robustly with civil society organizations.   \n21.  The simultaneous operations in several areas, coupled with the expansion of other \nsocial development programs, overstretch DSWD management and oversight capacity. Other \nimplementation challenges include (i) coordination of rehabilitation and recovery needs of such \nan enormous scale and the many stakeholders that are likely to be involved in these efforts;      \n(ii) interface with government planning and budgeting reforms; (iii) remote and inaccessible \nsubproject  locations;  (iv)  fiduciary  risks  with  higher  volume  of  transactions,  especially  for \nsubproject  investments;  and  (v)  local  political  interference.  These  will  be  mitigated  by                  \n(i) interagency governance structures operating nationally and locally; (ii) enhanced program \nmanagement support systems, including the provision of adequate personnel and functional \ndecentralization to regional offices; (iii) capacity development; (iv) a strengthened grievance \nredress system; (v) simplified procedures and reporting requirements; and (vi) robust monitoring \nand audit systems, including third party M&E and oversight by civil society organizations. \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith DSWD. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nproject administration manual (footnote 31). \nC.  Poverty and Social \n23.  Poverty and social impacts. The project focuses on poor and typhoon-affected areas \nwhere the impacts of CDD will be greatest.36 The project is expected to help reduce poverty by \nimproving  the  access  of  the  poor  to  basic  services,  supporting  disaster  recovery  and \nreconstruction  and  strengthening  resilience  to  future  disasters.  It  will  help  expand  poor \nhouseholds\u2019 livelihood opportunities and improve their incomes. Better access to health facilities \nand services will particularly benefit women, children, and the elderly. The project will help lower \nthe incidence of waterborne disease, improve access to schools, and better connect remote \ncommunities to town centers and markets. Healthier and better-educated residents will be able \nto improve their productivity and economic conditions. The project will strengthen institutions by \nenhancing community participation in local governance, increasing resilience to disasters, and \nbuilding social capital that reinforces the sustainability of development efforts. \n24.  Gender  and  development.  The  project  identifies  and  addresses  the  needs  and \npriorities of women by ensuring mechanisms to support women\u2019s participation and voice in local \ndecision-making  processes  to  select  and  design  priority  infrastructure  investments.37 The \nproject\u2019s gender action plan ensures that (i) participatory selection of subprojects includes an \nanalysis of the needs and benefits of men and women in the criteria for prioritizing community \ninfrastructure to be rehabilitated or developed; (ii) separate meetings are held with marginalized \nhouseholds\u2014including  those  headed  by  women,  where  needed\u2014to  discuss  subproject \nproposals before barangay assemblies, in locations and at times convenient for women; (iii) \n20%\u201330% of the paid jobs created by the project go to women by 2017; (iv) the operation and \nmaintenance plan provides 20%\u201330% of paid jobs to women; (v) links are made with support \nservices  or  community  cr\u00e8ches  are  established  for  child  care,  so  that  women  can  take \nadvantage of employment and training opportunities; (vi) 50% of participants in all capacity \ndevelopment programs are women; (vii) women\u2019s leadership of volunteer committees increases \n                                                \n35  Pulse Asia. 2011 Nationwide Survey on Corruption. http://www.pulseasia.ph/files/Download/3-28-2011%20MR3%20-\n%20UB2011-1%20MR%20on%20Corruption.pdf \n36  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n37  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nto 50% by 2017; (viii) gender mainstreaming responsibilities are included in the performance \ntargets of project management officers; and (ix) all program staff undergo gender training and \ngender indicators are integrated in the KC-NCDDP M&E framework. \nD.  Safeguards \n27.  Environment. The project is rated category B, as subprojects are not expected to have \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  Any  environmental  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  implementing \nsubproject environmental management plans, with DSWD monitoring compliance. The KC-\nNCDDP has a list of subprojects that cannot be funded, which, together with ADB\u2019s list of \nprohibited investments, provides a built-in environmental screening mechanism.38 The CDD \napproach likewise ensures that environmental concerns are addressed and mitigation measures \nare adhered to during implementation. An environmental assessment and review framework has \nbeen prepared.39 An initial environmental examination document will be required for category B \nsubprojects and a project description for category C subprojects.  \n28.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is rated category B. Subprojects are expected to \nrequire little or no land acquisition, as they are small infrastructure works to be prioritized and \nimplemented by communities. A resettlement framework has been prepared, and resettlement \nplans will be prepared and approved before accessing block grants for small-scale infrastructure \nsubprojects that have involuntary resettlement impacts.40 \n29.  Indigenous peoples. The project is rated category A as it will have direct and indirect \nimpact on indigenous peoples\u2019 communities in eight of the nine regions to be covered by the \nproject.  Project  design  will  ensure  active  participation  of  indigenous  peoples  in  small \ninfrastructure rehabilitation and local development, and improved access to basic services. An \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  indigenous  peoples  plan  for  subprojects  with  impacts  on  indigenous \npeoples.41  \n30.  The environmental assessment and review framework, resettlement framework, and \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  are  consistent  with  national  laws 42  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Project implementation risks and measures to mitigate them are described in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.43 Risks stem from the scaling up of CDD operations \nwithin a post-disaster context, inclusion of several stakeholders in program implementation, and \nduplication of recovery and reconstruction efforts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n38  The ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) details prohibited investments. \n39  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40  Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41  Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 DSWD\u2019s environmental and social management framework incorporates the safeguard requirements of the \ngovernment and the World Bank, as well as the principles and content of the ADB safeguard documents. \n43 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate institutional and  Strengthen program management systems and due diligence, decentralize \npersonnel capacity to implement  functions to DSWD regional offices, provide adequate numbers of technical \nand monitor the program in a post- staff that could be quickly mobilized, accompanied by well-designed capacity \ndisaster context   building.  \nDuplication of recovery and  Work closely with stakeholders and provide regular updates to the central \nreconstruction efforts  committee coordinating line agencies in the formulation, implementation, \nand monitoring of the Yolanda recovery and reconstruction plan. \nLocal political interference  Use the underlying principles of community participation and transparency \nin resource allocation and decision making during the subproject planning \ncycles.
