I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \n(SASEC)  Railway  Connectivity:  Akhaura\u2013Laksam  Double  Track  Project.1 The  report  also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Development  for  Bangladesh \nRailway for Project Implementation, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Bangladesh in upgrading the 72-kilometer \n(km)  Akhaura\u2013Laksam section  of the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong railway  corridor to  a  double  track \nrailway line with modern signaling equipment. The section is part of a major subregional corridor \nand the Trans-Asia Railway network. The project will also (i) improve 11 railway stations and (ii) \nstrengthen the capacity of the railway sector in project management and implementation as well \nas in accessing climate mitigation funds. By increasing the capacity of a major international \ntrade corridor, the project will boost the national economy and facilitate subregional cooperation \nand trade. The project was endorsed by the SASEC Trade Facilitation and Transport Working \nGroup in a meeting held in Singapore on 30 October 2013. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bangladesh has the potential to become a transport and transshipment center for the \nsubregion. It borders India and Myanmar and is close to the landlocked countries of Bhutan and \nNepal. Together with the Bhangabandhu Bridge over River Jamuna (the Jamuna Multipurpose \nBridge) and the provision of access to Chittagong Port, the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor can \nfacilitate trade between Bangladesh and with the northeastern states of India, the Indian state of \nWest Bengal, Bhutan, and Nepal, creating the potential to attract more foreign and domestic \ninvestments to the country. Bangladesh is located on major international trade corridors, as \nidentified in the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Regional Multimodal \nTransport Study2 and the Trans-Asian Railway network. However, the market share of the \nrailway in the subregional transport is low; only 11.9% or 876,855 tons of Bangladesh\u2019s imports \nfrom India and only 1.1% or 17,832 tons of exports from Bangladesh to India were transported \nby rail in 2011. Only one passenger train operating two times a week links Dhaka\u2014the capital of \nBangladesh\u2014with Kolkata in India, and on average only one freight train per day crosses the \nborder. In comparison, Bangladesh Railway was operating 289 passenger and 48 freight trains \nper day in FY2011/12 for the domestic market. The main reasons for the limited cross-border \nrail traffic are missing links and congestion in main domestic railway corridors, which do not \nallow operating additional trains for domestic and international traffic. \n \n4.  Dhaka and Chittagong are the two major metropolitan areas of Bangladesh. Dhaka is \nthe main commercial and administrative center of the country, while Chittagong is the primary \nseaport, accounting for about 90% of imports and exports. More than a quarter of Bangladesh\u2019s \npopulation  of  142  million  lives  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor.  Travelling  by  railway  in \nBangladesh is more safe, energy efficient, environmentally friendly, and reliable than other \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  SAARC  Secretariat.  2007.  Regional  Multimodal  Transport  Study.  Kathmandu.  Prepared  under  ADB.  2004. \nTechnical Assistance for Promoting South Asian Regional Economic Cooperation. Manila (TA 6187-REG). Among \nSAARC priority corridors, Bangladesh has 6 out of 10 road corridors, 2 out of 5 rail corridors, and 2 principal ports \n(Chittagong and Mongla) for SAARC trade. ", "2  \nmodes of transport; railway transport is also considered more comfortable than long-distance \nbuses. Intercity trains operated by Bangladesh Railway are very popular. Thus, the occupancy \nof intercity trains is very high, especially in the east zone (98%); intercity trains in the Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong corridor are usually sold out. About 40% of Bangladesh Railway\u2019s passengers travel \nby intercity trains, which accounts for more than 75% of passenger revenue. The high demand \nfor intercity service in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor cannot be met fully because of insufficient \nline capacity, thus, no additional trains can be scheduled to tap into these lucrative markets for \nBangladesh Railway with high revenue potential. Because Bangladesh\u2019s economy is growing by \nmore than 6%, a rising demand for domestic and regional railway transport is expected, but it \ncannot be satisfied with the existing limited infrastructure. \n \n5.  The Chittagong Port handled 1.44 million twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) containers in \n2012. 3 According to the traffic forecast in the base case scenario of the Strategic Master Plan \nfor Chittagong Port, the number of containers handled is expected to increase to 2.94 million \nTEU by 2020, to 6.09 million TEU by 2030, and to 10.20 million TEU by 2043, which means an \naverage growth of 6.5% per year compared with an annual growth of 10.1% from 2002 to 2012. \nThe number of containers transported by Bangladesh Railway between Chittagong Port and the \nDhaka  Inland  Container  Depot  has  however  been  stagnant,  and  Bangladesh  Railway \ntransported about 67,000 TEU in 2012. Bangladesh Railway\u2019s market share was declining to \nless than 10%; it cannot maintain its market share mainly because of the capacity constraints in \nthe Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor, which limits the number of container trains between Chittagong \nPort and the Dhaka Inland Container Depot to two daily trains. \n \n6.  About 203 km out of the 321 km Dhaka\u2013Chittagong railway line is still only single track, \nconstraining the demand to increase the number of trains in the corridor. There are two projects \nunder construction for laying double tracks on the railway line: (i) the 64 km Tongi\u2013Bhairab \nBazar section4 is financed by ADB\u2019s Railway Sector Investment Program5, and (ii) the 61 km \nChinki Astana\u2013Laksam section is financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency.6 \nBoth projects are scheduled to be completed in 2015. The Government of India finances the \nconstruction of the second Bhairab and the second Titas river bridges with about 7 km of \napproach  railway  lines.7 India  is  also  supporting  the  construction  of  the  Akhaura\u2013Agartala \nrailway line on a grant basis, which will link the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong railway corridor to the Indian \nstate of Tripura. Thus, the only remaining 72 km single track section between Akhaura and \nLaksam will become the critical bottleneck for domestic and subregional traffic in this corridor. \n \n7.  The  government\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  therefore,  assigns  the  highest \npriority  to  increasing  the  capacity  of  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  by  completing  double \ntracking on the entire corridor, which accounts for more than 40% of all passenger journeys by \nrailway in Bangladesh. The project is, therefore, in line with the government\u2019s transport sector \n                                                \n3  ADB provided support for the development of Chittagong Port under ADB. 2004.

Manila \n(MFF-0004-BAN). \n6  Japan International Cooperation Agency financing in the Bangladesh Railway sector includes the double tracking \nof the 61 km Chinki Astana\u2013Laksam section of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor, remodeling of the station yard in \nChittagong, and procurement of seven diesel-electric locomotives. \n7  The total length of track to be financed by the Government of India is approximately 7 km including track on the two \nbridges and the respective approach routes. In addition to infrastructure investment, the Government of India is \nalso financing procurement of rolling stock, i.e., diesel locomotives, passenger coaches, and freight wagons. \n ", "3 \ndevelopment strategy and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015.8 The strategy aims \nto reduce high transport and logistical costs to overcome the economic isolation of large parts of \nthe country from national and regional markets through improvements of strategic links on the \nmain corridors facilitating subregional trade, such as the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong.9 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  impact  will  be  improved  domestic  and  subregional  trade-flow  and  passenger \nmovement  in  Bangladesh.  The  outcome  will  be  an  improved  railway  transport  system  in \nBangladesh. The project will enable efficient and safe transport within the country in the Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong railway corridor and with India and, through India, with Bhutan and Nepal. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  Output 1 will upgrade railway infrastructure by (i) double-tracking 72 km of railway lines \nincluding the construction of the new second track and upgrading and reconstruction of the \nexisting track in accordance with the requirements of the Trans Asia Railways network for future \nconversion  to  broad  gauge;  (ii)  installing  modern  signaling  and  interlocking  equipment  to \nenhance the safety of railway operation; and (iii) reconstructing 11 stations with integrated \ndesign features for the elderly, women, children and disabled. Output 2 will support Bangladesh \nRailway in project management and project implementation. Output 3 will support capacity \ndevelopment for the permanent project management unit to be established in Bangladesh \nRailway and for accessing climate mitigation funding. \n \nD.

Goods  and  works financed  by  ADB  and  EIB will  be  procured through  international \ncompetitive bidding in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  Bangladesh  Railway  has  sound  experience  in  procurement  and  contract \nmanagement under ADB-financing. The evaluation of bids will be carried out by the government \nwith support from independent consultants recruited under the Subregional Transport Project \nPreparatory Facility.17 The same will apply with contract negotiations. ADB will play an active \nfacilitation role in the bidding process to ensure timeliness and quality in the process, and will \nengage its own consultants to help with this work. Because of joint cofinancing by EIB, it is \nproposed to permit the procurement of goods, works, and consultant services from nonmember \ncountries of ADB.18 The waiver of ADB\u2019s member country procurement eligibility for the OCR \nloan is sought to allow for procurement from EIB member states that are not ADB member \nstates.19 Project implementation and management support will require consultants, which will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  All  consulting  services  will  be  recruited  using  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10  taking  into  account  the  complexity  of  a \nmultidisciplinary railway project. To avoid start-up delays, the government has requested that \nADB selects consultants on its behalf.

The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V); and  $400,000  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Nordic Development Fund and administered by ADB. The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation,  support \nfacilities,  counterpart  staff,  logistical  support,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  International \nconsulting firms and individual consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consulting firm will be asked to submit simplified \ntechnical proposals, and the selection will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nselection method using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 due to the highly specialized knowledge in \ncarbon financing for railways. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n17.  The design for the project was prepared by consultants recruited under the Subregional \nTransport Project Preparatory Facility (footnote 17). The design is based on the existing design \nstandards of Bangladesh Railway and the requirements of the Trans Asia Railway network. \nAlthough the line will initially be commissioned for meter gauge, it will be converted into broad \ngauge in the future. The project includes the construction of the second track and the upgrading \nand  reconstruction  of  the  existing  track  to  broad  gauge  standards.  Engineering  design \nmeasures to minimize the need for land acquisition and resettlement are considered in the \ndesign. Given that Bangladesh is a low-lying country and the project area experiences high \nrainfall, the main climate change-related impact on the project is increased flooding and river \nflow  volumes  due  to  increased  rainfall.  The  embankment  height,  the  design  of  drainage \nstructures, and the height of bridges have been adjusted to address these impacts. Bangladesh \nRailway is implementing sector reforms to improve the efficiency and performance of the railway \nsector under the ADB-financed Railway Sector Investment Program (footnote 5); details of the \nprogress are described in the railway reform progress report.21 The capacity of Bangladesh \nRailway to maintain assets was strengthened by updating several of its operations manuals as \npart of the reform project. Bangladesh Railway will maintain all assets financed under this loan \nin such a way that they are available for safe railway operation. Maintenance will be carried out \nbased  on  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s  operations  manual  and  the  recommendations  from  the \nmanufacturer and supplier. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n18.  Economic and financial analyses have been undertaken and concluded that the project \nis economically and financially viable.22 The project economic internal rate of return is 15.5%, \nand the economic net present value discounted at 12% is Tk12,228 million. The economic \nanalysis compared the benefits and costs of with-project and without-project situations. The \nmain benefits are savings in road vehicle operating costs and time savings for road passengers. \nA sensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible negative changes in the key parameters that \ndetermine the project\u2019s costs and benefits. The analysis indicates that the project\u2019s economic \nviability would remain satisfactory even under adverse scenarios. The financial evaluation of the \nproject was undertaken in real terms using constant 2013 prices. The financial internal rate of \nreturn for the project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 3.9%. This compares favorably with the \nweighted average cost of capital, also computed on an after-tax basis of 2.4%. The sensitivity \n                                                \n21 Railway Reform Progress Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nanalysis indicates that the financial internal rate of return is robust under adverse conditions. \nThe project is considered financially viable. However, sustainability will depend upon ongoing \nreforms  in  the  sector  and  the  sufficiency  of  Bangladesh  Railway's  cash  flows,  both  from \nrevenues and government subsidies. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n19.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that \nBangladesh Railway has adequate capacity in financial management for ADB-financed projects. \nBangladesh Railway has prior and ongoing experience in implementing ADB projects funded \nunder the Railway Sector Investment Program. Bangladesh Railway has knowledge of project \nfinancial accounting methods and ADB disbursement procedures. Bangladesh Railway officials \nhave participated in workshops on the good practice of financial management conducted by \nADB. Bangladesh Railway\u2019s capacity is being further strengthened through the rollout of the \nnew accounting and financial management system by the Bangladesh Railway Reform Project. \nThe project implementation unit under Bangladesh Railway will establish and maintain separate \nproject records and accounts to identify the finances received and the expenditures made under \nthe project, ensuring an adequate audit trail. The accounts will be set up in accordance with \nsound accounting principles. Independent auditors, acceptable to ADB, will audit the accounts \nand related financial statements annually. \n \n20.  Procurement and anticorruption. Procurement will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  ADB  will  review  documents  and  submissions  related  to \nprocurement at all major milestones prior to proceeding with the procurement process. The \nprocurement rules for the selection of contractors required by international financial institutions \nsuch  as  ADB  are  considered  sufficiently  robust  to  deter  corruption.  National  procurement \nregulation has also improved through the Public Procurement Act, 2006, and through related \nPublic Procurement Rules (2008) with subsequent amendments and the establishment of a \nCentral  Procurement  Technical  Unit  under  the  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nDivision of the Ministry of Planning. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government and Bangladesh Railway. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). In \nOctober 2012, a National Integrity Strategy (NIS) was approved and  the National Integrity \nAdvisory Committee was formed with the Prime Minister as the chair to steer anticorruption \nmovement and implement the strategy. The NIS includes a road map for strengthening both the \nstate and non-state accountability institutions to fight corruption and improve governance. Under \nthe NIS, all line ministries and key watchdog institutions have formed an ethics committee and \nappointed a focal point to implement corruption prevention programs and actions.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n21.  Poverty and social. In spite of considerable progress in poverty reduction,23 the poverty \nlevel in Bangladesh remains high, with 31.5% of the population living below the poverty line and \n17.6%  considered  as  extremely  poor.24 In  the  project  area  of  influence,  which  covers  six \nsubdivisions in the two districts of Brahmanbaria and Comilla, the project socioeconomic survey \nidentified that about 25% of households fall under  the poverty line. The principal income-\ngenerating activities are businesses (34%), farming (20%), and services (9%). Railway is one of \nthe  principal  modes  of  transportation  because  of  its  cheap  fares,  safety,  and  punctuality \n                                                \n23 A 1.7% reduction per annum from 2005 to 2010. \n24 Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2011. 2010 Household Survey. Dhaka. \n ", "8  \ncompared with other modes of transport. The upgraded corridor will allow for shorter travel time \nand more reliable transport conditions for passengers in all ticketed classes. This will contribute \nto socioeconomic development and poverty reduction by improving basic access to national and \nregional  markets,  employment  opportunities,  goods  at  competitive  prices,  as  well  as \nadministrative, health, and educational services. Additional immediate project benefits include \nincome-generation opportunities for wage laborers, businesspeople, contractors, and suppliers \nof raw materials, as well as an increased demand for daily necessities. \n \n22.  Gender, HIV/AIDS, and trafficking. In spite of improvements in gender parity levels \n(i.e.,  primary  and  secondary  school  enrollment),  the  role  of  women  in  the  project  area  is \nprimarily bound to home activities (e.g., caring for children and the elderly, cooking, cleaning) \nwith few income-generation and higher-education opportunities. Therefore, women tend to stay \nclose to their homes, and their mobility is limited to seeking medical care, visiting relatives, and \nshopping. Consultations, which included five focus-groups specifically targeting women and \nwomen\u2019s inputs in the design of the train stations, showed that they welcomed a facilitated \naccess to services and economic opportunities. A gender action plan was developed to include \nproactive gender-mainstreaming activities into the project design. It includes the (i) integration of \nfriendly design features for the elderly, women, children, and disabled into the rehabilitated \nrailway stations and staff housing units (i.e., separate toilets and ablution facilities, station \nentrances and foot-over-bridges equipped with ramps, dedicated pick-up points, and parking \nslots for wheelchair users); (ii) display of materials in railway stations on human-trafficking, the \nprevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and basic hygiene; (iii) STD-awareness \nsessions to civil works laborers; (iv) STD, human-trafficking, and women personal security and \nsafe mobility awareness sessions for local communities; (v) capacity building in mainstreaming \nfriendly  design  features  for  the  elderly,  women,  children,  and  disabled  into  Bangladesh \nRailway\u2019s operations; (vi) provisions to comply with core labor standards;  and (vii) special \nassistance measures to support women in the implementation of the resettlement plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n23.  Environmental impact. There are no environmentally sensitive features in the project. \nHence, it has been categorized as B in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). Accordingly, an initial environmental examination following the requirements of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement has been prepared for the project and disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite.  Key  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  of  tracks  alongside \nalready existing tracks, stations, and access roads are minor and mainly restricted to the \nconstruction stage. The anticipated environmental impacts during construction are related to \ndust, noise, public health, the temporary restriction of access\u2014particularly near community \nareas\u2014and related safety issues, sourcing and transport of construction materials, embankment \nconstruction, the removal of trees within the right-of-way, the generation of waste from the \nreconstruction of existing stations and construction camps, and the siltation and contamination \nof rivers and streams from the bridge construction works. During operation, the main impacts \nwill be related to increased noise due to the doubling of daily train traffic. Mitigation measures to \navoid,  minimize,  and  mitigate  these  impacts  have  been  included  in  the  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP). The bidding documents have clauses on environment safeguard \nrequirements and include the EMP. Meaningful  consultations have been conducted throughout \nthe project preparation stage and all concerns of the affected persons and stakeholders have \nbeen incorporated in the initial environmental examination and the EMP. A grievance redress \nmechanism is proposed to continue receiving feedback and complaints from affected parties \nand addressing them during the construction stage. An environment safeguards unit will be \nestablished within Bangladesh Railway to oversee the implementation of all safeguard activities \n ", "9 \nunder Bangladesh Railway. An environmental focal person will be appointed from the unit for \nthe project. This person will be supported by an environment specialist under the construction \nsupervision consultant\u2019s (CSC) team. The environment specialist in turn will be supported by on \nsite staff for each contract package for day-to-day monitoring of the EMP implementation. An \ninitial training-cum-coordination workshop on implementing environment safeguards under the \nproject will be organized by Bangladesh Railway with technical support from the CSC and ADB, \nas  necessary.  Continued  on-the-job  training  will  be  conducted  by  the  CSC  or  ADB,  as \nnecessary, during project implementation. \n \n24.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as A for \nresettlement and C for indigenous peoples; 58.43 hectares of private land will be acquired. \n2,180 households (10,408 persons) will be affected, out of which 830 will lose their homesteads \nand 317 will lose more than 10% of their assets. A Resettlement Plan was prepared based on \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the 1982 Bangladesh Acquisition and Requisition of \nImmovable  Property  Ordinance  II.  The  Resettlement  Plan  outlines  the  provisions  for \ncompensations at replacement cost, as well as other assistance measures including livelihood \nand  income  restoration.  The  Resettlement  Plan  budget  is  $87.50  million  equivalent.  The \nResettlement  Plan  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  information  disclosure requirements  and  will  be \ndisclosed at the local level and on Bangladesh Railway\u2019s website. Screening for impacts on \nindigenous  people  was  conducted  during  project  preparation,  which  confirmed  that  no \nindigenous peoples are present in the project area. Affected persons were fully consulted on the \nproject alignment and station design. Bangladesh Railway is experienced in implementing a \nResettlement Plan, as demonstrated recently by the implementation of the Resettlement Plan \nfor the Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar double track project. The project implementation unit will have a \nresettlement unit, headed by a chief engineer and supported by  at least two resettlement \nofficers based in each district (Brahmanbaria and Comilla). Moreover, the implementation of the \nresettlement  plan  will  be  conducted  by  an  experienced  nongovernment  organization.  The \nimplementation  will  be  supervised  and  internally  monitored  by  the  resettlement  unit  and \nexternally monitored by the CSC, which will have national and international resettlement experts \nin its team. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n25.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.25 The integrated benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProject  The start-up delay has been substantially reduced by 3 years compared with previous railway \nimplementation  projects in Bangladesh, as the design is complete and bid documents are being finalized. Bidding \ndelay  will start soon and contracts are targeted to be awarded within 6 months after loan approval. \nWeak  Land acquisition, social, and environmental impacts have been minimized through engineering and \nsafeguard  institutional measures. The works contract will be awarded only after completing safeguard \ncompliance  requirements. Before construction, a due diligence mission will be fielded to create awareness \namong the project authorities about Asian Development Bank (ADB) safeguard requirements. \nDelay in  Cofinancing will substantially reduce the share of government financing. A sufficient fund for land \nreleasing  acquisition and resettlement activities is budgeted. The financing of taxes and duties for \ncounterpart  components of the works and the consulting contract financed by ADB further reduces the share of \nfunds  government financing. The construction supervision consultant will help to flag the fund \nrequirement well in advance. \n                                                \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of  Ongoing sector reforms are designed to improve Bangladesh Railway\u2019s operational efficiency and \nfinancial  financial performance, including a rationalized tariff policy, strengthened asset management, \nsustainability  improved financial reporting and accounting, and human resource management. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n26.  The government and Bangladesh Railway have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursements  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n27.  The government and Bangladesh Railway have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan agreements. Before the loans can be declared \neffective, the government will have to award the consulting services contract for the construction \nsupervision. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n28.
