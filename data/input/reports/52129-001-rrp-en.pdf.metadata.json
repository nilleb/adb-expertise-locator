The  total \npopulation  is  about  107,000  people,  of  which  almost  two-thirds  live  on  the  main  island  of \nTongatapu, home to the country\u2019s capital of Nuku\u2019alofa. Based on its exposure, susceptibility, and \ncoping  and  adaptive  capacities,  Tonga  has  been  ranked  second  only  to  Vanuatu  among  the \ncountries in the world most at risk of disasters caused by natural hazards.1 In any given year, it is \nlikely that Tonga is either hit by a major natural disaster or is recovering from a previous one.  \n \nThe country is already experiencing the effects of climate change. Increasing variability in \n4. \nrainfall patterns is causing flooding and droughts in some locations. Increasing ocean temperature \nhas  led  to  coral  bleaching  and  destruction  of  natural  coastal  barriers,  and  sea  level  rise  is \ncontributing to coastal erosion.2 These changes have heightened Tonga\u2019s exposure to disasters \nbrought about by tropical cyclones and storm surges, which have inflicted significant losses on \nthe economy. For example, a cyclone in 2002 resulted in losses of $60 million,3 and losses from \nanother one in 2010 reached $22 million.4 Tropical Cyclone Ian in 2014 resulted in total damage \nand losses of about $50 million.5 Tonga is also located within the Pacific \u201cring of fire,\u201d which is \nassociated with extreme seismic activity.  \n \n5. \nTonga is expected to incur, on average, $15.5 million per year in losses from earthquakes \nand  tropical  cyclones.  In  the  next  50  years,  Tonga  has  a  50%  chance  of  experiencing  a  loss \nexceeding $175 million and casualties higher than 440 people, and a 10% chance of experiencing \na  loss  exceeding  $430  million  and  casualties  higher  than  1,700  people.6   These  figures  could \nincrease if the impacts of climate change are considered.  \n \nThe emergency. Tropical Cyclone Gita hit Tonga on 12 and 13 February 2018. It caused \n6. \nwidespread destruction on Tongatapu, including Nuku\u2019alofa, and the neighboring island of \u2018Eua. \nWith average wind speeds of 130 kilometers per hour, and gusts of up to 195 kilometers per hour, \nit  was  the  strongest  cyclone  to  directly  hit  Tongatapu  and  \u2018Eua  since  severe  Cyclone  Isaac  in \nMarch 1982. An accompanying storm surge reached 1 meter above normal high-tide levels, and \n200 millimeters of rain fell within 24 hours, resulting in localized flooding. It is estimated that more \nthan  80,000  people  (or  about  80%  of  the  population  of  Tonga)  were  directly  affected.  The \ndestructive winds, storm surges, and flooding brought down power lines; damaged and destroyed \n\n                                                 \n1   Alliance Development Works. 2017.

Nearly \n5,000 houses were either destroyed or damaged. The government declared a state of emergency \nfor the whole of Tonga on 12 February 2018. \n \nEnergy  sector  damage  and  needs.  The  government  led  a  post-disaster  rapid \n7. \nassessment  (PDRA)  with  assistance \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).7 The PDRA estimated the total value of effects caused by the cyclone \nto be about $164.3 million, equivalent to nearly 38% of the nominal 2017 gross domestic product \nin Tonga. The estimation of recovery needs incorporated the principle of \u201cbuilding back better.\u201d \nThe total recovery and reconstruction cost is estimated at $148.7 million, of which $45.9 million \nis for the energy sector, including the cost of reconstruction of the power grid infrastructure assets \non Tongatapu to a higher standard of disaster resilience.  \n \n8. \nGrid  upgrades  improve  disaster  resilience  of  electricity  network.  The  cyclone \ndisrupted the power supply on the islands of \u2018Eua and Tongatapu, disconnecting all Tonga Power \nLimited (TPL) customers. However, the service lines that had already been upgraded under the \nongoing Outer Islands Renewable Energy Project (OIREP)8 in \u2018Eua, and under the Tonga Village \nNetwork Upgrade Project (TVNUP) in Tongatapu funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade (MFAT), experienced significantly less damage than the grids that had not yet \nbeen  upgraded.  On  Tongatapu,  TVNUP  had  already  upgraded  54%  of  TPL\u2019s  grid  prior  to  the \nlandfall  of  the  cyclone.  Of  the  grids  that  had  not  yet  been  upgraded,  45.9%  were  damaged, \ncompared with a damage of only 4.7% to the upgraded grids. The experience from OIREP and \nthe TVNUP clearly demonstrates the resilience benefits of updating inefficient and aging power \nnetwork infrastructure and building back better. \n \n9. \nOver  the  first  6  weeks,  during  which  businesses  and  schools  were  closed,  TPL \nreconnected the 17,782 customers in Tongatapu through temporary emergency repairs, awaiting \nthe  final  reconstruction  and  disaster-proofing.  However,  in  the  current  condition,  the  network \nwould  not  be  able  to  withstand  another  storm.  The  old  service  lines  are  now  connected  with \nseveral  joints,  making  them  more  susceptible  to  faults.9 The  final  reconstruction  and  upgrade \nshould  be  done  as  soon  as  possible,  to  minimize  secondary  impacts  on  the  economy  and  to \nrestore reliable power supply in priority areas and for essential services.10 \n \n10. \nStatus of donor coordination. The Government of Tonga is leading the response efforts \nwith  the  assistance  of  nine  humanitarian  clusters  and  support  from  bilateral  partners, \nnongovernment organizations, and other development partners. The government implemented a \nrange of social protection programs to support households, including provision of additional funds \nto  the  elderly  and  people  with  disabilities.  In  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  cyclone,  donor \ncontributions and insurance payouts to the government\u2019s emergency fund were used to finance \nmany  of  the  most  urgent  recovery  needs,  and  several  government  ministries  reallocated \nresources to cyclone recovery activities.11 \n                                                 \n7  Government of Tonga. Forthcoming. Post Disaster Rapid Assessment, Tropical Cyclone Gita. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n8  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the Kingdom \n\nof Tonga for the Outer Island Renewable Energy Project. Manila.  \n\n9  During the first full month of operations with temporary connections (April 2018), the network was experiencing more \nthan double the average number of faults in 2017. TPL predicts that power outages will increase as the temporary \nconnections deteriorate and fail. \n\n10 The project area also includes essential services such as the main hospital and the main water supply bore field. \n11 The government\u2019s emergency fund receives annual appropriations for natural hazards and other emergencies. The \nfund  played  an  important  role  in  the  government\u2019s  immediate  response  and  early  recovery  efforts,  and  disaster \ncontingent financing and catastrophe risk insurance payments were channeled through its structures. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fThe  energy  sector  reconstruction  costs  are  estimated  at  $45.9  million,  and  after \n11. \ncontributions from the government\u2019s emergency fund (about $3.3 million) and New Zealand MFAT \n($2.1  million  for  immediate  repairs,  and  $7.7  million  for  reconstruction),  $34.5  million  remains \nunmet.  The  World  Bank  and  other  development  partners  will  focus  on  other  sectors,  such  as \nhousing and education. \n \n12. \nADB response to Cyclone Gita. On 15 February 2018, the government requested to \nwithdraw $6.0 million in disaster contingent financing (a $3.1 million loan and $2.9 million grant) \nunder ADB\u2019s Pacific Disaster Resilience Program, which was established in December 2017 to \nhelp  strengthen  the  disaster  resilience  of  Samoa,  Tonga,  and  Tuvalu. 12  ADB  released  the \n$6 million budget support within 24 hours from the request. On 22 February, ADB provided an \nadditional $1 million under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund for humanitarian relief efforts. \nThese funds were deposited in the government\u2019s emergency fund and were an essential part of \nits immediate response and early recovery efforts.  \n \n13. \nOn 12 April 2018, the government requested further ADB support to access $8.8 million \nunder the Asian Development Fund 12 Disaster Response Facility for the (i) reconstruction and \nupgrade of electricity network infrastructure damaged by the cyclone ($6.8 million), noting ADB\u2019s \ncomparative advantage and ongoing projects in the sector that would allow rapid implementation \nof the project; and (ii) setup of a new disaster contingent financing facility ($2.0 million) to replace \nprevious disaster contingent financing under ADB\u2019s Pacific Disaster Resilience Program, which \nwas drawn down in full in response to Cyclone Gita.13 \n \n14. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  In  response  to  the  government\u2019s  request,  ADB\u2019s \nemergency assistance will finance the reconstruction and \u201cbuilding back better\u201d of priority areas \nof the Nuku\u2019alofa electricity network, identified as the most affected by the cyclone. The project \nwill  restore  access  to  reliable  electricity  supply,  reduce  losses,  and  upgrade  the  network  to  a \nhigher standard of disaster resilience.  \n \n15. \nADB  has  sufficient  presence  and  expertise  in  the  country  and  offers  comparative \nadvantage for energy sector infrastructure reconstruction. TPL is an implementing agency for two \nongoing  ADB  projects  in  Tonga:  (i)  OIREP,  to  install  solar  power  generation  and  expand  the \nelectricity network in Ha\u2019apai, \u2018Eua, and Va\u2019vau Islands (footnote 8); and (ii) Cyclone Ian Recovery \nProject, to rehabilitate and climate- and disaster-proof the electricity network on Ha\u2019apai Islands.14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loans, \n\nPolicy-Based Grants, and Technical Assistance Grant Pacific Disaster Resilience Program. Manila. \n\n13 As  provided  in  the  Concessional  Assistance  Policy,  in  the  event  of  a  disaster,  an  Asian  Development  Fund-only \ncountry  can  access  up  to 100%  of  its  annual performance-based  allocation  from  the  Disaster  Response Facility. \nTonga\u2019s request of $8.8 million corresponds to 100% of the 2018 performance-based allocation for Tonga. A new \ndisaster  contingent  financing  facility  ($2  million)  will  be  processed  through  regular  procedures  for  policy-based \nlending, targeting approval in early 2019. \n\n14  ADB.  2014.

The \nproject will restore reliable access to the electricity supply network and make it more resilient to \nextreme weather and disasters by repairing the utilities and upgrading them to a higher standard \nof  disaster  resilience.  The  \u201cbuilding  back  better\u201d  activities  will  follow  the  overall  plans  for  the \nupgrade  of  the  Nuku\u2019alofa  network,  as  described  in  the  Nuku\u2019alofa  Network  Upgrade  Project \n(NNUP) due diligence report.17 The proposed NNUP includes five contiguous subproject areas \nand 56 villages in Nuku'alofa. MFAT has committed NZ$11 million (about $7.74 million) for the \nNNUP under a separate project. MFAT and ADB funds will address the immediate priority areas \nunder  the  NNUP  that  were  identified  during  the  PDRA  preparation  as  those  most  affected  by \nCyclone Gita.18 \n \nThe project will rehabilitate the existing high-voltage and low-voltage overhead network \n18. \nusing disaster-resilience measures such as modern aerial-bundled conductors, and install new \n11/0.4-kilovolt  distribution  transformers  and  new  underground  service  cables  to  customer \npremises  with  new  smart  meters.19 The  project  will  be  viewed  as  part  of  a  rolling  program  to \neventually  reconstruct  all  of  Nuku\u2019alofa,  resulting  in  better  access  to  reliable  power  supply, \nreduction in losses, and less damage during cyclones. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $9.42  million  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).20 The major \nexpenditure items include works and equipment.  \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nBase cost:b rehabilitation and upgrade of electricity network \nContingenciesc \n \n \n\nItem \nA.  \nB.  \n \na   Includes taxes, duties, and environment levy of $1.14 million, financed by the government through exemption. \nb  In April 2018 prices. \nc   Physical contingencies computed at 7% for civil works.

The investment activities \nhave  been  screened  and  found  appropriate.  Implementing  the  project  activities  will  allow  for \nlearning through monitoring and evaluation and for replication elsewhere in Tonga. The project is \ncoordinated  with  and  supported  by  other  development  partners,  and  the  approach  will  further \nimprove development coordination. The government\u2019s PDRA is the basis for selection of project \noutputs  (footnote  7).  Alternative  technical  configurations  were  considered.  The  proposed \nconfiguration is considered technically optimal under the local conditions to climate- and disaster \nproof the electricity network. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), economic \nand  financial  analysis  may  be  finalized  before  project  implementation. 22  The  economic  and \nfinancial analysis carried out for the NNUP will be used as the basis to finalize the analysis for the \nproject.  ADB  will  allocate  sufficient  resources  to  undertake  the  economic  and  financial  due \ndiligence. \n \n29. \nAn  economic  analysis  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.23 It will cover the macroeconomic and sector context and include \na  discussion  of  rationale  for  public  investment,  demand  analysis,  alternatives  and  least-cost \nanalysis,  cost\u2013benefit  analysis,  sustainability  analysis,  distribution  analysis, and  sensitivity  and \nrisk analyses, and it will include a clear discussion of the without- and with-project scenarios.  \n \n30. \nA financial analysis will be prepared in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects.24 Financial  viability  will  be  assessed  by  comparing  the \nincremental  costs  and  revenues  over  the  life  of  the  project.  In  the  event  of  insufficient  cost \nrecovery,  an  assessment  of  the  financial  sustainability  will  be  conducted,  to  assess  (i)  the \ncoverage of incremental recurrent costs required to ensure sustainability of the project benefits, \nand (ii) the capacity of the executing and implementing agency to fund these costs. \n \nC. \n \n31. \nA financial management  assessment  was  conducted for  the  project  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  Guidelines  and  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note.25  \nThe assessment considered the MFNP as the executing agency and TPL as the implementing \nagency.  The  MFNP  and  TPL  have  satisfactory  experience  with  implementing  ADB-funded \nprojects. \n \n \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2004.

A key risk mitigating measure will be to ensure that \na dedicated full-time qualified project accountant forms part of the PMU in TPL.  \n \n33. \nTPL has a functioning procurement unit and has successfully undertaken procurement of \nsimilar goods for other ADB-funded projects. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government, MFNP, and TPL. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \nD. \n \nThe reconstruction and \u201cbuilding back better\u201d of the immediate priority areas of Nuku\u2019alofa \n34. \nelectricity  network  will  help  provide  a  more  reliable  and  disaster-resilient  power  supply  in  the \ncommunity. This greatly benefits the households that are dependent on reliable energy supply for \nthe continuation of their income-generating and productive activities. Women especially will be \nable to continue performing their multiple roles, including household care, more efficiently.  \n \n35. \nThe project is proposed as some gender elements. Gender activities and targets during \nproject  implementation  include  (i)  at  least  30%  women\u2019s  participation  and  involvement  in  all \nproject consultations during implementation, to determine specific issues affecting women and to \npropose effective mitigating measures; (ii) the implementation of HIV/AIDS and gender-sensitivity \nawareness sessions to prevent sexual harassment and gender-based violence at work among all \nTPL ground staff and contractors; and (iii) at least 30% women\u2019s participation in training programs \nrelated to maintenance and operation. The women will be prioritized for work opportunities and \nkey positions. Particularly, the model of employing women as line workers will be replicated in the \nproject for  additional TPL  workers.26 The  proposed  PMU  within  TPL  will  be responsible for the \nproject\u2019s gender and social activities, with capacity-building support provided by the project.  \n \nE. \n \n36. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories are as follows.27 TPL PMU will be responsible for safeguard compliance of the project \nduring implementation. \n \n37. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  has \nbeen  prepared  with  the  environmental  safeguard  requirements  applicable  to  the  proposed \nproject. 28  The  disaster-response  nature  of  this  project  entails  that  the  site-specific  initial \nenvironmental  examination  will  be  conducted  at  the  early  stage  of  project  implementation  and \nbefore the physical execution of the subprojects. Most of the project activities will be limited to \nupgrades  of  existing  facilities,  and  the  project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  significant  and \nirreversible  impacts.  The  adverse  impacts  are  likely  temporary  and  localized,  and  can  be \nmanaged with the proposed mitigation measures and the Code of Environmental Practice, which \nare included in the environmental assessment and review framework and the initial environment \nexaminations. \n \n                                                 \n26 The Outer Island Renewable Energy Project (footnote 8) engaged a total of 12-line workers, of whom 10 are women, \nto  expand  the  electricity  network  in  Ha\u2019apai,  Eua, and  Va\u2019vau  Islands.  TPL  worked  with  technical  and  vocational \ncolleges in targeting women applicants. This is a successful engagement model adopted by TPL. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27  ADB.

The  project  will  not  involve  involuntary \n38. \nresettlement or land acquisition. All reconstruction work will take place entirely within state-owned \nland. The power poles and lines are situated along dedicated road reserves. The underground \nservice  cables  will  be  confined  to  the  customers\u2019  premises.  The  installation  of  distribution \ntransformers will take place on existing, TPL-owned land.  \n \n39. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  will  not  impact  distinct  and  vulnerable \ngroups of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).
