THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Greater Thal Canal Irrigation Project.  \n \n2.  The project will contribute to enhancing food security and rural economic growth in Punjab \nprovince. It will increase the agricultural production and productivity of the project area by \ndeveloping a new irrigation system. The Greater Thal Canal (GTC) irrigation scheme will convert \n704,000 hectares (ha) of low productive barani (rain-fed) lands in Bhakkar, Jhang, Muzaffargarh, \nKhushab, and Layyah districts of Punjab to irrigated and productive lands. It will provide reliable \nirrigation water supplies during the monsoon kharif (monsoon) season from April to September. \nThe government has constructed the Main Canal and first branch (Mankera) system.1 The project \nwill support (i) construction of the irrigation canal network in the second branch (Choubara) \nsystem; and (ii) on-farm command area development (CAD) in the Main Canal, Mankera branch \nand Choubara branch areas covering about 263,000 ha of irrigable command areas. The project \nwill also enhance the capacity of relevant government entities and water users for (i) efficient \nwater management, (ii) introduction of advanced technologies, (iii) improved and climate-resilient \nagricultural practices, and (iv) sustainable infrastructure.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The economy and food security. The agriculture sector generates jobs and earns \nsignificant export revenues for Pakistan. Agriculture\u2019s share in the country\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct declined from 29.0% in 1985 to 18.7% in the fiscal year (FY) 2019.2 Despite this trend, \nthe sector absorbs 39% of the country\u2019s total labor force3 and 45% in Punjab province.4 About \n80% of national exports originate from the agriculture sector and Punjab province contributes a \n60% share in national exports.5 In FY2017, the province produced 76.7% of the nation\u2019s total \nproduction of wheat, 50.7% of rice, 65.7% of sugarcane, 85.4% of maize, and 65.4% of cotton.6 \nPunjab\u2019s agriculture sector is also the main source of food production for the country\u2019s increasing \npopulation which has an annual growth rate of about 2%.7 In Pakistan, 60% of the population \nexperience food insecurity, and about 22% of the population is undernourished. Food supply in \nthe country is still lower than the demand. About 44% of overall household incomes, and 48% of \nthe rural population\u2019s incomes are spent on food. Addressing malnutrition requires increased \naffordable food supply.8 Developing new agricultural lands and increasing agriculture productivity \nare critical for the food security of the increasing population, and also for the province\u2019s economic \ngrowth and livelihood, particularly in rural areas. This has particularly become important under \n \n1  The overall GTC irrigation system comprises one Main Canal, and four branch canal systems. The Main Canal and \nMankera branch canal were completed in 2009 under federal government financing. \n2  Government of Pakistan, Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.

About 26% of Punjab province\u2019s population lives below the poverty line.9 \nPoverty incidence in the project area is significantly higher than the provincial average and ranges \nfrom 64.8% in Muzaffargarh district, 51.7% in Bhakkar district, and 40.4% in Khushab district in \nFY2015.10 Farm-based economic activities contribute 40% of rural households\u2019 income. Poverty \nin Pakistan is estimated to have increased from 24.3% to 44.2% because of the COVID-19 \npandemic.11 \n \n5.  Sector challenges.  Because of Pakistan\u2019s semi-arid climate, it is highly dependent on \nirrigation for agricultural production. The Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) services 14.9 million \nha out of a total 22.04 million ha of cultivated land in Pakistan.12 Farming in areas outside of the \nIBIS relies on rainfall or groundwater. Groundwater tables tend to be low in non-irrigated areas, \nand pumping requires high costs. Therefore, groundwater irrigation is not prominent in such \nareas. Although Punjab province accounts for more than 70% of the cropped area of the IBIS, \n13.3% of cultivable land in Punjab remains rain-fed.13 Some of the country\u2019s poorest populations \nalso reside in these barani (rain-fed) areas and are dependent on agriculture as a major source \nof income. Without a secure and reliable irrigation water supply, agricultural production in the \nbarani areas is both a low-productivity and a high-risk venture. It contributes to low farm incomes \nand slow agricultural growth. \n \n6.  Although Pakistan is water scarce, the crop water requirements in irrigation systems have \nincreased because of rising cropping intensities and application of high water-consuming crops. \nIrrigation efficiency is low at about 40%.14 Agriculture productivity per unit of water is below global \nand regional averages because of water shortages, land degradation, and mismanagement of \nwater resources.15 The IBIS is also encountering financial challenges, recovering only 24% of \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs.16 To address this challenge, the Government of Punjab \nin 2019 increased the abiana (irrigation service fee) from $0.76 per ha (PRs50 per acre) to $1.71 \nper ha (PRs110 per acre) for rabi (winter) crops and $1.32 per ha (PRs85 per acre) to $2.63 per \nha (PRs170 per acre) for kharif (summer) crops. The government has been exploring further \nincrease of abiana.  \n \n7.  Climate change impacts. Pakistan was ranked fifth among the 181 countries most \naffected by adverse impacts of climate change during 1999\u20132018.17 Likely impacts include \ngreater unpredictability in monsoons and rainfall, leading to more frequent and intense floods or \n \n9  Government of Punjab.

Already stressed water resources will be further strained by fluctuations in flows in the \nIndus River system because of glacial melt.18 These climate impacts can result in yield declines \nin many key crops, including cotton, wheat, sugarcane, maize, and rice. Pakistan\u2019s high exposure \nto multiple natural hazards coupled with climate change exacerbate its vulnerability to impacts \n(footnote 18). The project will enhance climate resilience through the supply of reliable irrigation \nwater and increased soil moisture. The project will also support mainstreaming water use efficient \nirrigation technologies and climate-resilient agricultural practices.  \n \n8.  Women\u2019s role in agriculture. About three-quarters of women and girls in the labor force \nin Pakistan work in the agriculture sector.19 This is mainly in dairy and livestock, with only \u201c19% \nof them in paid employment and 60% as unpaid workers in family farms and enterprises.\u201d20 In \nPunjab in 2018, 66% of women in the labor force were in the agriculture sector compared to 29% \nof men.21 Although women in Pakistan have statutory rights to own land, customary practices limit \ntheir access to land. Only 1%\u20132% of women individually own land and about 10% have joint \nownership with their spouses (but with little effective control over land).22 Poor access to land and \nlimited  engagement  in  economic  activities  are  detrimental  to  rural  women\u2019s  agricultural \nproductivity.  They  restrict  their  access  to  agricultural  services  like  processing  and  storage \nfacilities,  capacity  development  and  skills  training,  agricultural  inputs,  and  benefits  from \nparticipation in water users associations (WUAs) (footnote 20).     \n \n9.  COVID-19 impacts. The outbreak of COVID-19 had significant negative impacts on the \ncountry\u2019s economy. Inflation surged from 6.8% in FY2019 to 11.5% in FY2020, led by food price \ninflation, which averaged 13.6% in urban areas and 15.9% in rural areas.23  Principally wheat and \nwheat flour prices were forced up by international and inter-provincial supply chain disruptions. \nFood insecurity increased, especially for the poor. This highlights the importance of locally \nsourced food to which the project will contribute. It will also support post-COVID-19 pandemic \neconomic recovery in domestic agricultural production. The project will provide employment \nopportunities to the rural population, including returning international and domestic migrants, and \npositively contribute to upstream and downstream industries. Rural income increases could offset \nthe impact on families that have depended on overseas remittances.  \n \n10.  Development coordination. The federal and provincial governments maintain high-level \ndialogue,  and  oversight  and  monitoring  of  policies  and  development  programs. 24  Major \ndevelopment partners in the agriculture and water resources sector are the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank. The recently \ncompleted and ongoing interventions by the major development partners provide support for \nupgrading, modernizing or constructing irrigation systems and barrages, and CAD.

Prior development partner interventions \nwere largely focused on rehabilitation and/or modernization of existing barrages and irrigation \nsystems. For further increase of agricultural production to support food security, development of \nnew irrigation systems, such as the GTC scheme is increasingly important. \n \n11.  Strategic context. The project is aligned with the following operational priorities of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating \nprogress in gender equality, (iii) building climate-resilience, (iv) promoting rural development and \nfood security, and (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.25 The project will \ncontribute to addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities by enhancing the incomes \nof the rural poor, and building climate and disaster resilience. It will enhance environmental \nsustainability by providing reliable irrigation water to a previously rain-fed area, and by introducing \nhigh efficiency irrigation to minimize water losses. The project directly supports pillar 2 (building \nresilience by strengthening human capital and social protection) of ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy  for  Pakistan,  2021\u20132025  for  strengthening  resilience  of  the  rural  economy  in  the \naftermath  of the  COVID-19  pandemic,  promoting  climate  change  adaptation,  and reducing \neconomic and social vulnerabilities.26 The Government of Punjab\u2019s Medium-Term Development \nFramework,  2020\u20132023  prioritizes  expanded  and  reliable  irrigation  supplies  and  enhanced \nagricultural productivity (footnote 9). The National Water Policy 2018 indicates the importance of \nO&M, adequate water pricing, the adoption of improved technologies, and extension to new \ncommand areas.27  \n \n12.  The project. The GTC irrigation scheme was partially constructed in 2009. The water \nallocation for the entire GTC was approved by the Indus River System Authority (para. 28).28 The \nscheme\u2019s agricultural potential has not been fully realized because the remaining three branch \ncanal systems and their command areas have not been developed. The areas to be covered by \nthese branch systems have low productivity and continue to rely on rain-fed or limited ground \nwater irrigation. The proposed project will convert the low productive lands in the Main Canal, and \nMankera and Choubara branch areas into climate-resilient and productive irrigated lands. It is \ndesigned as the first ADB-financed project of a potentially phased support for sequentially \ncompleting the development of the entire GTC scheme. Project preparation was supported by \ntransaction technical assistance (TA).29  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: food security enhanced30 and rural \npoverty in Punjab reduced.31 The project will have the following outcome: agricultural production \nand productivity in the project area increased.32  \n \n \n25 ADB. 2018.

Output 1: Irrigation system infrastructure for Choubara branch system constructed. \nThis output will construct irrigation canals and associated structures in the Choubara branch \nsystem. The major activities will include (i) construction of the Choubara branch system, (ii) tree \nplanting along irrigation canals for the Main Canal and Mankera and Choubara branch systems \nas wind breakers to prevent sediment deposits entering the irrigation canals, (iii) desilting of the \nMain Canal and Mankera branch systems, (iv) construction and renovation of operational and \nadministration  site  buildings  for  the  Punjab  Irrigation  Department  (PID),  and  (v)  the \nimplementation  of  a  social  development  action  plan  to receive  an  increased  population  in \nagricultural labor. The social development action plan includes equipment procurement for a basic \nhealth unit, upgrading of a girls\u2019 school, and vocational training (para. 37). The Choubara branch \nsystem includes the construction of 72 kilometers (km) total length of the branch canal, 251 km \ntotal length of 11 secondary canals, and 127 km total length of 11 tertiary canals. \n \n15.  Output 2: On-farm command area developed with enhanced beneficiaries\u2019 capacity. \nCAD  activities  in  the  Main  Canal,  and  Mankera  and  Choubara  branch  areas  will  include \n(i) development and construction of on-farm watercourses using farmer construction contracts, \nsocial  mobilization  and  WUA  formation;  (ii)  implementation  of  piloting  for  improved  water \nproductivity, such as increased lining of watercourses, land leveling, high efficiency irrigation \nsystems (HEISs) including drip irrigation systems, water retention ponds, and piped watercourses; \n(iii) awareness campaign and capacity development of farmers on improved on-farm water \nmanagement and climate-resilient agricultural practices, including extension services like farmer \nfield schools and provision of high-yielding seeds; (iv) construction of site buildings for the Punjab \nAgriculture Department (PAD); and (v) capacity development of the PAD including CAD planning \nusing a geographic information system (GIS) and satellite data.  \n \n16.

This  output  will  enhance  the  PID\u2019s  institutional  capacity  for \nimproved water resources management and O&M of irrigation systems for sustainability. The \nactivities will include support for (i) GIS-based asset management system development, (ii) \ninstallation of groundwater monitoring equipment and development of groundwater modelling for \nthe entire GTC area, (iii) implementation of groundwater recharge piloting, (iv) canal flow water \nmeasurement system installation for monitoring efficient water use, (v) capacity development \nactivities for PID staff including long- and short-term training, (vi) GIS-based monitoring and \nevaluation  system  development,  and  (vii)  implementation  of  other  institutional  capacity \nstrengthening that will be programmed under ADB\u2019s ongoing capacity development TA for the \nPID.33 These activities may include asset management decision-making system development and \nactions for the implementation of the Punjab Water Act 2019. \n \n17.  Lessons. The project will build on lessons from interventions in the Main Canal and \nMankera branch areas, and other similar irrigation projects financed by the federal and provincial \ngovernments, ADB, and other development partners. Since the construction of the Main Canal \nand Mankera branch was completed in 2009, only 25%\u201330% of its total command area has been \ndeveloped.  A  CAD  component  was  not  included  in  the  Main  Canal  and  Mankera  branch \nconstruction interventions and investment benefits have yet to be realized. The key technical \nchallenges identified for the CAD in the GTC area are as follows: (i) water conveyance and \napplication to farms is difficult because of the undulating terrain, and (ii) a 6-month period during \nwhich there is no water flowing in the irrigation canals could result in channels being buried by \nwind-blown sands. \n \n33  ADB. 2016.

The major lessons included in the project are: (i) support for on-farm CAD should be \nintegrated into infrastructure development; (ii) close coordination between the PID and PAD will \ncreate an enabling environment; (iii) CAD to be coupled with capacity development of farmers for \nimproved and climate-resilient agricultural practices and efficient water use; (iv) awareness \ncampaigns, demonstrations and subsidies for high efficiency irrigation and other technologies  to \nbe included; (v) water use efficiency and conjunctive use of surface and groundwater to be \nconsidered  in  CAD  planning;  and  (vi)  on-farm  CAD  to  adopt  a  participatory  and  inclusive \napproach. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n19.  The project will integrate infrastructure and agriculture interventions to maximize the \nbenefits from irrigated agriculture. From the lessons learnt, the project was designed to allocate \nample time for CAD activities with beneficiary involvement and capacity strengthening of farmers, \nPAD, and PID even after the completion of major infrastructure works. It will include water users\u2019 \ncapacity building in improved and climate-resilient agriculture practices, HEISs (including drip \nirrigation systems), and the application of advance technologies like satellite and GIS-based \nsystems. The capacity development of the PAD and the PID will also include the latest best \npractices in irrigated agriculture, digitized water and agricultural data acquisition, efficient water \nuse, water management, and infrastructure sustainability. The project will include tree planting \nalong the canals to serve as windbreakers and the piloting of the piped watercourses. The \nproject\u2019s innovative features, including a focus on high water productivity in dryland areas offers \nan opportunity to showcase value added practices to other barani areas in Pakistan.  \n \n20.  The project will introduce advanced technologies including (i) application of satellite data \nfor optimizing and planning CAD activities; (ii) utilization of remote sensing technology for efficient \nmonitoring and evaluation of project impacts, e.g., cropped area expansion; (iii) piloting of \ngroundwater recharge; and (iv) development of a GIS-based asset management, CAD planning, \nand project monitoring and evaluation systems. With support from the project, the PID and the \nPAD will collect reliable data of the project area, such as topography, irrigation water flow \ndischarges, and groundwater. Such data will provide background information for future decision-\nmaking  regarding  design  and  investment  scheduling  for  the  remaining  branch  system \ndevelopment.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n21.  The project is estimated to cost \u00a527,979.6 million ($249.3 million equivalent) (Table 1). \nDetailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).34 The major expenditure items include civil works, on-farm CAD \nactivity  support,  consulting  services,  institutional  capacity  strengthening,  and  project \nmanagement.  \n \n \n34 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n(\u00a5 million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  \u00a522,448  million  ($200  million \nequivalent)35 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have \na 30-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; the interest and other charges during construction to be \ncapitalized in the loan; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nBased on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 17.75 years, and the maturity premium \npayable to ADB is 0.20% per year. \n \n23.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \nworks, equipment, on-farm CAD activities, institutional capacity development, consulting services, \nresettlement compensation, and project management. ADB loan financing will cover non-land \ncompensations, while land costs will be financed by the government. The government will also \nfinance taxes and duties. Farmers, i.e., beneficiaries, will contribute fixed percentages to selected \nCAD activities, such as field watercourse construction, and installation of HEISs.  \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  (\u00a5 million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  22,448.0  80.2 \nGovernmenta  5,531.6  19.8 \nTotal  27,979.6  100.0 \na  Includes farmers\u2019 contribution estimated at \u00a51,628.6 million.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  The technical viability and economic feasibility for the entire GTC scheme were confirmed \nby the federal government in 2005. These were reconfirmed for the proposed project in 2019\u2013\n2021 through the updated detailed design undertaken by a government-financed consultants\u2019 \nteam and the ADB-financed transaction TA (footnote 29). Water allocation for the entire GTC \nscheme  was  determined  and  approved  by  the  Indus  River  System  Authority  in  2002  and \nreconfirmed by the authority in 2021. It is within the provincial allocation for the Punjab province, \nas defined under the Water Apportionment Accord.36 The actual water use in Punjab, water \navailability, climate change impacts and downstream flows were assessed under the transaction \nTA. The project will not alter or exceed the approved provincial water allocation and will not impact \nwater allocation for downstream areas. The GTC irrigation scheme is non-perennial and will use \nwater only during the kharif season from about April to September. The major physical works \nproposed under the project are the construction of irrigation canals and their associated structures, \nsuch as gated regulators. These are comparatively simple engineering works and the PID has \nsubstantial prior experience in constructing and operating similar structures. Other technical \nviabilities, including engineering design, drainage needs, soil characteristics, estimated cropping \npatterns and groundwater conditions, were also confirmed through assessments under the \ntransaction TA. The findings were included in the project design.37  \n \n29.  The project will provide reliable irrigation water supply. It will also improve farmers\u2019 \ncapacity for climate-resilient agricultural activities through the on-farm CAD activities. These \ninclude introduction of water conservation irrigation technologies like HEISs and small water \nretention  ponds,  knowledge  on  efficient  water  uses  under  the  water  scarcity  status,  and \nappropriate crop selection and agricultural practices for climate resilience. Tree planting along the \nirrigation canals will contribute to climate change mitigation (footnote 18). The project will also \nenhance sustainability through (i) beneficiary participation in the construction of on-farm minor \ncanals and structures; and (ii) provision of support for the PID\u2019s capacity strengthening for \nimproved sustainability of irrigation schemes, including asset database development.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n30.  Economic and financial analyses indicate that the project is economically viable and \nfinancially sustainable. The economic internal rate of return for the project is 13%. Benefits of the \nproject will be derived from improved agricultural productivity over an area of 263,000 ha, with the \nmain factor being the increase in the kharif crop intensities in the Choubara branch area. With the \nprovision of reliable irrigation water supply to the existing unirrigated command area, and CAD \ninterventions, it is anticipated that there will be (i) a significant improvement in the cropping \npattern, cropping intensity, and crop yields; and (ii) a shift towards high value crops, with \nsignificant incremental economic value from melons, dates, sesame seeds, citrus, mung beans \n \n36 Government of Pakistan. 1991.

Water  retention  ponds  (to  increase  soil  moisture),  and  gradual  increase  of \ngroundwater table will also enable increased and diversified rabi cropping. The sensitivity tests \nand risk analysis confirm that the project is consistently robust. The project remains economically \nviable under all sensitivity test scenarios.  \n \n31.  The project will also bring indirect and intangible benefits, such as increased employment \nto landless and seasonal laborers, increased local food production that will provide food security \nto the farming community, increased farmers\u2019 knowledge on improved agricultural practices and \nmore efficient water use. Indirect benefits also include increased revenues and employment for \nupstream  (input  supply  companies)  and  downstream  (processing  companies  and  traders) \nindustries.  The project will also substantially benefit the rural poor through increased incomes. \n \n32.  The financial sustainability analysis of this nonrevenue-generating project focused on \nassessing the Government of Punjab\u2019s capacity to adequately fund the incremental O&M costs. \nThe management and O&M of Punjab\u2019s irrigation systems are estimated at $51.30 per ha per \nyear. During 2013\u20132016, the Government of Punjab allocated $158 million equivalent or $18.60 \nper ha annually on average for this purpose. Despite the financial gap, Punjab\u2019s irrigation systems \nare in reasonably good condition and deliver an acceptable level of service to end users. The \nGovernment of Punjab will allocate adequate resources to fully implement the O&M plan to be \ndeveloped under the project. Ensuring the financial sustainability of irrigation systems is a core \nfocus of the PID. ADB, through its capacity development TA, is supporting the sector reforms and \nthe implementation of action plans will be supported by the project (footnote 33). \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n33.  Sustainability measures have been built into the project design. The project will support \nthe PID\u2019s implementation of O&M efficiency and sustainability enhancement. These will include \nstructural efforts like tree planting to reduce sediment deposition in canals and non-structural \nsupport for developing an asset management decision-making system. Siltation is one of the \nmajor challenges for ensuring the sustainability of the structural functions of the GTC irrigation \ninfrastructure. The tree planting along the irrigation canals will reduce the PID\u2019s regular O&M \ncosts for sediment removal. The project will finance asset inventory and condition assessment. It \nwill form the basis for a future asset management decision-making system to systematically \nprioritize and strategically plan O&M activities.38 The PID has also initiated improvement of \nirrigation services cost recovery. This includes updating the abiana (irrigation service fee) rate \nand digitizing abiana collection. The asset management decision-making system and improved \nirrigation services cost recovery will complement each other for ensuing sustainability of the \nirrigation structures and irrigation water supply.   \n \nD.  Governance \n \n34.  The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk for the PID and the PAD is \nsubstantial, mainly because of (i) the absence of an independent internal audit system and (ii) the \nuse of a manual accounting system. The financial management systems of the PID and the PAD \nhave improved through the implementation of recent and ongoing projects financed by ADB and \nthe World Bank. While the existing financial management staff and systems are appropriate to \nimplement the project, residual financial management risks remain. The project procurement risk \nis rated medium. The PID and the PAD have demonstrated satisfactory procurement performance \n \n38  In addition to the support under the project, a proposed cluster TA for Mainstreaming Water Resilience in Asia and \nthe Pacific is expected to support the assessed management system enhancement and expansion.  \n ", "11 \non  previous  and  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects.  The  project  implementation  management \nconsultants\u2019  support,  ADB\u2019s  financial  support  for  incremental  staff,  and  ADB\u2019s  capacity \nenhancement support will further decrease the procurement risks.  Value for money of the \nprocurement shall be achieved by (i) proposing the sizable single works package, instead of \nmultiple smaller-size packages, to attract both international and national bidders based on market \nassessment; and (ii) using open competitive bidding for all packages, excluding the community \nparticipation packages that will be directly contracted with relevant communities. \n \n35.  The project completion report of ADB\u2019s Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program \nrated the PID\u2019s performance as the executing agency satisfactory. 39 The report also confirmed \nthat the PID demonstrated competence in procurement, financial management, safeguards and \nother project management matters to meet ADB\u2019s requirements. The project sets clear input and \noutput targets to promote good governance. Risk mitigation measures have been identified and \nincorporated in the project design and risk management plan (para. 45). \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the PID, and the PAD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 34).  \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n37.  The project will have direct positive impacts on poverty reduction and food security among \nthe rural poor. The direct beneficiaries of the project will be smallholder farmers. The Main Canal \nand Mankera branch areas are estimated to have 49,000 farmer households with an average \nfarm size of 3.1 ha. In the Choubara branch areas, there are about 38,000 farmers with an \naverage  farm  size  of  3.1  ha.  About  81%  of  these  farms  (representing  71,000  farms)  are \nsmallholder farmers owning less than 5 ha. Households headed by women make up about 1% of \nthe households.40 Women perform multiple tasks in the household and in agriculture- and \nlivestock-related activities. They are responsible for all domestic work, with limited engagement \nin activities outside of the home. Women are responsible for water collection from hand pumps in \nopen communal areas or from irrigation canals. Their main economic activities are livestock \nfarming and marketing of dairy products at the village level. Women also contribute to seasonal \nfarm activities like transplanting, weeding, and harvesting. The literacy rate among adult women \nis only 22% compared to 58% for men.  About 85% of literate adults are not able to attain a middle \nor high school education because such schools do not exist in villages. Access to social services, \nlike hospitals or maternity clinics is difficult for women as the facilities are located in towns. Rural \nareas are served by basic health units.  \n \n38.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project activities will \ndirectly support the improvement of agricultural productivity and income of farmers including the \npoor and women working in the agriculture sector. The project will address these gender issues \nby (i) installing cattle baths, and passage bridges in strategic locations of the irrigation system; \n(ii) improving  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  WUAs;  (iii)  training  women  in  on-farm  water \nmanagement, improved agricultural practices and crop production; and (iv) implementing the \nsocial development program (para. 14) that will contribute to human development in the project \narea. The project will support upgrading of a girl\u2019s primary school to a middle school, improvement \nof facilities in a basic health unit, and vocational training for 1,000 men and women. It will also \n \n39  ADB. 2018. Completion Report: Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program in Pakistan.

The vocational training under the social \ndevelopment program was designed to encourage women to diversify their economic activities.   \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n39.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.41 \n \n40.  Environment (category A). The draft environmental impact assessment (EIA) which \ncontains an environmental management plan was prepared by the PID in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The first draft of the EIA was disclosed on the ADB website in \nFebruary 2020. The second draft of the EIA, which incorporates the second round of an ecological \nsurvey, the biodiversity action plan (BAP), and the stakeholders engagement plan, was disclosed \nin September 2021. The project interventions will result in positive impacts including increased \nagricultural production and improved livelihoods of rural poor communities. The project will cause \nlarge-scale, permanent landscape alteration because of the transformation of the semi-arid area \nto irrigated agricultural lands. The key potential adverse impacts are on rakhs (protected range \nlands).42 The BAP was prepared for conservation management activities to offset impacts and \nlosses of biodiversity values in the rakhs because of the construction of irrigation canals. The BAP \nalso proposed other details, including institutional strengthening measures of the Forest, Irrigation \nand  Agriculture  departments,  sustainable  agriculture,  and  eco-tourism  potential.  A  tree \nmanagement plan has been prepared for effective implementation of tree plantation along the \nirrigation  canals  which  will  provide  a  wind  barrier.  The  plan  will  also  delineate  roles  and \nresponsibilities between various stakeholders for tree planting and maintenance. \n \n41.  The project may induce habitat modification, community fragmentation and increased \npesticide use. Adequate mitigation measures have been incorporated into the project design and \naddressed in the EIA. These include canal crossings, and farmers\u2019 capacity enhancement in \nappropriate agricultural practices including pesticide management. Other potential environmental \nimpacts  will  occur  during  construction,  such  as  noise  and  dust,  which  are  temporary  and \nreversible. Adequate inputs for environmental management plan implementation monitoring have \nbeen provided for the project management office, and the project management and construction \nsupervision consultant. A third-party environmental monitor will also be engaged. Stakeholder \nconsultation was undertaken during project preparation. The project stakeholder engagement \nplan was prepared for further enhancement of the stakeholder consultation. The additional \nconsultation is being conducted, and will be continued during the project implementation also. A \ngrievance redress mechanism will be established. \n \n42.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). About 2,279 ha (5,632 acre) of land (1,488 ha of \nprivate land and 791 ha of government land) will be required for the right of way of irrigation canals \nof the Choubara branch system under output 1. About 4,686 households (29,628 persons) will be \naffected, of which 35 households will require relocation. In total, 123,186 trees and 1,779 ha \n(4,395 acres) of crops are estimated to be affected. There are estimated 226 affected structures. \nOf the 1,488 ha of privately owned land, about 1,481 ha (99.5%) were acquired during 2008\u2013\n2011. This was well in advance of ADB\u2019s discussion on project financing (in 2019). During project \npreparation  (in  2020)  it  was  identified  that  nearly  half  of  the  landowners  had  not  been \ncompensated. To address this legacy issue, the PID agreed to the following measures: (i) to \n \n41 ADB. Safeguard Categories.  \n42 Government of Pakistan. 1927. The Forest Act. Islamabad.

A corrective action plan has been prepared for 2,272 ha of the already acquired land. This \nis based on the due diligence conducted during project preparation, the agreement between the \nGovernment of Punjab and ADB, and other Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. About 7 \nha (out of 1,488 ha) of private land will need to be newly acquired for the right of way. A land \nacquisition and resettlement plan has been prepared. Any other impacts above the land, including \ncrops, trees, and structures, will also be compensated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements. Intensive public consultations and information dissemination campaigns \nfor all affected villages and settlements in the project area have been conducted throughout the \nproject preparation. The corrective action plan, and the land acquisition and resettlement plan \nwere disclosed on the ADB website in August 2021. Under output 2, the required land for the \nwatercourse  construction  will  be  provided  by  farmers  and  local  communities.  Involuntary \nresettlement is not involved. Safeguard measures to ensure that contributions are voluntary and \ndocumented are provided in the PAM (footnote 34). \n \n44.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no communities or groups that may be \nconsidered as indigenous peoples as defined under the Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \nG.

The construction of passage bridges will allow women to draw and carry water safely, for household \ncleaning, and for their kitchen gardens. The construction of cattle baths will enable women to provide their cattle with \naccess to water, and to ensure safety of their cattle. This facilitates women\u2019s work in the household as well as in their \nroles in livestock production.  \nd  The baseline study for the project shows that households headed by women comprise about 1% of all households \nand that 93% of households are farming households engaged in crop production and livestock raising. The Punjab \nKhal Panchayat Act 2019 does not prohibit women farmers from becoming members of the khal panchayat (field \nchannel user group) for water users associations. The Punjab Khal Panchayat Authority is mandated to have at least \ntwo female members. \nContribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities \nExpected values and methodological details for all OP indicators to which this operation will contribute results are \ndetailed in Contribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).
