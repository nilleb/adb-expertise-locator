An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  was \nundertaken,  a  summary  of  which  was  circulated  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Board of Directors and uploaded to \nthe ADB website on 16 May 2006. \n \nThe  Project  is  in  Sichuan  province  in  the  poor  southwestern \nregion of the PRC. In 2005, the per capita gross domestic product \nof Sichuan was only 61% of the national average. The Project will \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  by  building  an  important \nsection  of  the  western  region  corridor  connecting  two  growth \ncenters\u2014Chongqing \nan \nexpressway  across  mountainous  terrain;  (ii) improving  the  local \nroads that service poor counties and townships; and (iii) providing \nconsulting  services  and  training  to  build  capacity  at  the  local \ncommunications  bureau  and  improve  construction  quality,  road \nsafety, and project monitoring and evaluation. \n \nDespite  considerable  investments  in  the  road  sector,  the  PRC \nroad network still does not provide efficient transport to large parts \nof the country\u2014particularly to poorer inland regions like Sichuan. \nBetter  transport  links  are  necessary  to  (i)  improve  economic \nefficiency, (ii) foster domestic and international trade, (iii) facilitate \ninterregional integration, and (iv) reduce poverty. The provinces of \nwestern  PRC  lack  high-class  road  infrastructure.  The  road \nnetwork  must  be  improved  to  facilitate  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment and ensure that the social and economic benefits of \ninvestments  in  the  region  reach  poor  rural  areas.  To  enhance \neconomic  development  and  reduce  poverty  in  western  PRC,  the \nGovernment  is  implementing  the  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy,  which  aims  to  reduce  development  disparities  between \nthe  western  and  coastal  regions.  The  Project  will  support  this \nstrategy. It will be the fourth road project in Sichuan to be financed \nby  ADB.  It  will  complement  three  completed  or  ongoing  ADB-\nlikewise  concentrate  on \nfinanced  projects \ndeveloping the Xi\u2019an-Kunming road corridor. \n \n\nin  Sichuan \n\nthat \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  develop  an  integrated  road \ntransport  system  that  supports  sustainable  economic  growth  in \nSichuan  province.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  road \ntransport efficiency and safety in the project area. The Project will \n(i) reduce traffic accidents and vehicle operating costs; (ii) improve \naccess  between  Chongqing  and  Xi\u2019an,  two  major  growth  centers \nin  western  PRC;  (iii)  provide  additional  transport  capacity  to \naccommodate  growing  traffic  volume;  and  (iv)  provide  improved \naccess to markets and social services in a poor area. The Project \nhas the following outputs: (i) construction of a 143-kilometer (km), \nfour-lane,  access-controlled  toll  expressway  from  Dazhou  to \nWanyuan, including access roads, interchanges with toll stations, \ntunnels,  bridges,  administrative  stations,  and  service  areas;  (ii) \nupgrading  of  430  km  of  local  roads  to  improve  access  to  poor \nremote areas; (iii) promoting corporate governance by separating \nexpressway  construction  and  operations  from  the  provincial \ngovernment;  and  (iv)  building  capacity  in  project  management, \nquality  control,  road  safety,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  To \nrealize these outputs, the following key activities are needed: civil \nworks \nroads,  equipment, \nresettlement, consulting services, and training. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  to  be  $1.425 \nbillion, including taxes. \n \n\nthe  expressway  and \n\nlocal \n\nfor \n\nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nChina Development Bank  \nMinistry of Communications  \nSichuan Provincial Government  \n\nTotal \n200.0 \n556.0 \n229.0 \n440.0 \n1,425.0 \n\n% \n14 \n39 \n16 \n31 \n100 \n\nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n \nA loan of $200 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility.

On  24  May  2006,  ADB  approved  advance \ncontracting for procurement of civil works. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  51  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services to (i) help with project management during the \nconstruction  period,  (ii) provide  expertise  in  tunnel  construction, \n(iii) conduct  a  safety  audit  of  the  project  design  and  make  safety \nrecommendations  on  the  completed  construction  works,  (iv) help \nset  up  and  implement  quality  control  procedures,  (v) monitor  the \nenvironmental  impact  of  the  Project  and  provide  guidance  on \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures,  (vi) assist  with  formulating  a \nhuman resource development and training program, and (vii) help \nestablish  and  implement  a  project  performance  management \nsystem. The team leader will be in the field during the construction \nperiod and will act as assistant chief supervision engineer. In that \ncapacity  he  or  she  will  (i) help  the  chief  supervision  engineer \ncertify  variation  orders,  contractors'  monthly  payments,  and \nsubcontracting  documents;  and  (ii) help  establish  a  contracts \nmanagement  system.  All  consultants  to  be  financed  under  the \nADB loan will be selected and engaged based on the quality- and \ncost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor \nthe  Use  of  Consultants.  The  national  consultants \non \nconstruction  supervision  will  be  financed  by  SPCD  and  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with government procedures. \n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\ntransport \n\ntransport  and \n\ntime  and  costs,  and \n\nBy developing an integrated expressway and complementary local \nroad network, the Project will help improve access to markets and \nsocial services for the rural poor residents in the project area. The \nProject  will  reduce \nthereby \nencourage  investment,  create  jobs,  and  increase  incomes.  The \neconomic internal rate of return for the Project is estimated to be \n14.1%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  expressway \ncomponent  is  4.1%,  which  is  higher  than  the  real  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital.  About  137,800  people,  or  6.5%  of  the \nrural population in the project area, are considered rural poor (i.e., \nthey  have  annual  per  capita  incomes  of  less  than  CNY900).  The \nmain  project  beneficiaries  of  the  local  road  component  will  be  (i) \nhouseholds in poor counties and townships in the project area; (ii) \nproviders  of  rural \nindustrial  and  agricultural \nbusinesses;  (iii) agriculture-based  households  producing  grains \nand  vegetables  for  local  markets;  (iv)  people  living  in  the  project \narea, who will have easier access to long-distance transport; and \n(v) transport  operators  and  their  customers  for  transit  traffic.  The \nProject  will  also  help  reduce  traffic  accidents,  vehicle  emissions, \nand traffic noise on the existing roads. \n \nThe  Project  was \ntechnical, \neconomic, financial, and social risks. The main technical risks are \nassociated  with  extensive  tunnels  and  bridges.  To  mitigate  the \nrisks,  selection  of  contractors  focuses  on  their  financial  and \nto  handle  complex  works.  SPCD  has \ntechnical  capability \nexperience,  and  has  shown  satisfactory  performance, \nin \nimplementing \nfinanced  projects.  Economic \nto \nperformance \ndeteriorate  substantially  for  the  Project  to  lose  its  economic \nviability.  The  financial  risks  associated  with  construction  and \noperation  of  the  expressway  will  depend  on  the  level  and \nthe \ntraffic,  construction  costs, \ncomposition  of \nexpressway's  commercial  managers,  and  tolls.  To  mitigate  the \nfinancial  risks,  (i)  SDEC  will  build  up  a  commercial  business \nenvironment \nthe  project \nexpressway  will  receive  substantial  equity  from  the  government, \nand (iii) an effective toll structure will be adopted. For projects that \ngenerate revenue in domestic currency, there are risks associated \nwith  exchange-rate  fluctuations;  these  risks  are  partly  accounted \nfor  in  the  base-case  calculations  for  the  Project.  The  social  risks \ninclude  resettlement  and  HIV/AIDS 1  infection  risks.  Mitigation \nmeasures  are  in  place  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  in  the  social \naction development plan. \n\nthe  project-influenced  area  would  have \n\nfor  expressway  operations, \n\nto  reduce  potential \n\ninternationally \n\nthe  skill  of \n\nformulated \n\n(ii) \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f100  00'Eo\n\nQ I N G H A I\n\n106  00'Eo\n\nEASTERN SICHUAN ROADS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nG A N S U\n\nZoige\n\nAba\n\n32  00'No\n\nDege\n\nX I Z A N G\n\nYalongjia\n\nn\n\ng\n \n\nR\n\ni\nv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nS I C H U A N\n\nCHENGDU\n\nBatang\n\nYa'an\n\nM\n\ni\n\nn\n\nj\n\ni\n\na\n\nn\n\ng\n\n \n\nR\n\ni\n\nv\ne\nr\n\nMianyang\n\nWenchuan\n\nDeyang\n\nS H A A N X I\n\nt\n\no\n\n \n\nX\n\ni\n\n'\n\na\nn\n\nWanyuan\n\nBazhong\n\nGuangyuan\n\nto Beijing\n\nJ\n\ni\n\na\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\n\ng\n\nj\ni\n\na\n\nn\n\ng\n\n \n\nR\n\ni\n\nv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nSee Map 2\n\n32  00'No\n\nDazhou\n\nWushun\n\nFengjie\n\nNanchong\n\nLiangping\n\nWanzhou\n\nJianyang\n\nSuining\n\nT\n\nu\n\no\n\nj\n\ni\n\na\n\nn\n\ng\n\n \n\nR\n\n.\n\nChangshou\n\nChongqing\n\nDazhu\n\nto \n\nW\n\nu\n\nh\n\na\n\nn\n\nChangjiang River\n\nH U B E I\n\nn\n\na\n\nh\n\nt o   W u\n\nCHONGQING\n\nQianjiang\n\nSigonli\n\nYongchuan\n\nQijiang\nLeishendian\n\nLuzhou\n\nYibin\n\nXuyong\n\nt\n\no\n\n \n\nG\n\nu\n\ni\n\ny\n\na\n\nn\n\ng\n\nG U I Z H O U\n\nH U N A N\n\nto Chengde\n\n28  00'No\n\nHanyuan\n\nZigong\n\nLeshan\n\nNeijiang\n\nRongchang\n\nLuding\n\nShimian\n\nLugu\n\nXichang\n\nDechang\n\nMiyi\n\nYanbian\n\nJinshajiang River\n\nY U N N A N\n\n28  00'No\n\nN\n\nY U N N A N\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n0\n6\n-\n1\n5\n6\n1\n \nR\nM\n\nKilometers\n\nPanzhihua\n\n100  00'Eo\n\nt\n\no\n\n \n\nK\nu\nn\nm\nn\ng\n\ni\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nRiver\n\nCity/Town\n\nAirport\n\nPort\n\nMajor Road\n\nRailway\n\n106  00'Eo\n\nProposed Project Road (Expressway)\n\nOngoing or Completed ADB-Financed Road Projects\n\nExpressway\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nM\na\np\n \n1\n\n\fo\n107  30'E\n\no\n108  00'E\n\nMap 2\n\nEASTERN SICHUAN ROADS\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nKangle\n\nSHAANXI\n\nn\na\n'\ni\nX\n \no\nt\n\nDaba Mountain Tunnel\n\nLinhe\n\nCounty Seat\n\nCity/Town\n\nInterchange\n\nProject Expressway\n\nExisting Expressway\n\nExpressway Planned \n\nExisting Class II Highway\n\nOther Local Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nPrefecture Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nProject Local Road (Government-financed)\n\nProject Local Road (ADB-financed)\n\nZhuyu\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n32  00'No\n\nN\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nKilometers\n\nGuandu\n\nWanyuan\n\nDazhu\n\nQija Tunnel\n\nHua\n\nCaojia\n\n32  00'No\n\nGuanba\n\nW A N Y U A N\n\nShiren\n\nZhongping\n\nWulangxi\n\nBaishahe\n\nDinghua\n\nBaisha\n\nShatan\n\nShizizhai Tunnel\n\nBatai\n\nDasha\n\nChangba\n\nLiaojiagou Tunnel\n\nWeijia\n\nCaoba\n\nShiwo\n\nHekou\n\nTiekuang\n\nLaofangzi Tunnel\n\nZhonghe\n\nXinhua\n\nHuangjin\n\nBaima\n\nFankuai\n\nPingxikou\n\nZhengjia\n\nShiankou\n\nZhonghe\n\nBa People\nCultural Relic\n\nPuguang\n\nH\n\no\n\nu\n\nh\n\ne\n\nTuzhu\n\nLiuchi\n\nXuanhan\n\nJuntang\n\nDonglin\n\nQishi\n\n31  30'No\n\nCHONGQING\n\n31  30'No\n\nBeimiao\n\nDacheng\n\nJinshi\n\nHongling\n\nMingyue\n\nSunjiagou Tunnel\n\nZ\n\nh\n\no\n\nu\nhe\n\nQingxi\n\nX U A N H A N\n\nHuangshi\n\nNanba\n\nChahe\n\nTahe\n\nTONGCHUAN\n\nMiap'an\n\nDazhou\n\nt o   C h e n g d u\n\nD A X I A N\n\nDaxian\n\ng\nqin\ng\nn\no\nh\n\nto C\no\n107  30'E\n\nTianbao\n\nQili\n\nBaishu\n\nKAIJIANG\n\no\n108  00'E\n\n06-1561b RM\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Eastern Sichuan Roads Development Project. The \nmain features of the proposed Project are summarized in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe PRC\u2019s economic growth since the 1980s has substantially increased the demand for \ntransport  services.  The  changing  and  increasingly  diverse  economy  has  altered  the  pattern  of \ntransport  demand.  The  demand  for  road  transport  has  outpaced  demand  for  other  transport \nmodes.  Movement  of  goods  and  passengers  by  road\u2014which  is  more  flexible  and  responsive \nthan other transport modes to the needs of a market economy\u2014is rapidly increasing. The shift in \ntransport demand also reflects the loosening of anticompetitive restrictions in the road transport \nindustry. From 1990 to 2005, passenger road traffic grew 8.8% per annum, reaching 929.9 billion \npassenger-kilometers (km), while freight road traffic grew 6.4% per annum, reaching 857.4 billion \nton-km.  In  Sichuan  over  the  same  period,  road  passenger  traffic  grew  6.5%  per  annum,  to \n55.2 billion passenger-km, and road freight traffic grew 4.3% per annum, to 28.6 billion ton-km. In \n2005,  road  traffic  accounted  for  53%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  passenger  traffic,  and  11.0%  of  the \ntotal freight traffic; the corresponding figures for Sichuan province were 65.3% and 33.6%. The \nvehicle fleet will continue to expand in light of the country\u2019s rapid economic growth, low current \nvehicle ownership rates, increasing access to loans to finance automobile purchases, and large \ninvestment in automotive manufacturing. Total vehicle ownership in Sichuan went from 765,000 \nin 2000 to 1,268,000 in 2004\u2014a 65.8% increase.  \n \nTo  meet  the  growing  demand  for  improved  transport  infrastructure  and  services,  the \n3. \nGovernment  spent  about  CNY1.9  trillion  on  building  new  roads  during  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan \nperiod  (2001\u20132005).  By  the  end  of  2005,  the  total  length  of  roads  in  the  PRC  amounted  to \n1.92 million  km,  of  which  about  17%  were  class  II  or  higher  standard.  The  density  of  the  road \nnetwork  was  still  low\u201420.0  km  per  100  km2.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  for  the  road  sector,  as \nreflected in its 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), calls for (i) construction of 380,000 km of new \nroads to expand the total road network to 2.3 million km; (ii) 25,000 km of that 380,000 km to be \nexpressways,1 increasing the total length of expressways to 65,000 km by 2010; (iii) completion \nof  the  national  trunk  highway  system  by  2007;  (iv) completion  of  interprovincial  western \ndevelopment  corridors  by  2010;  and  (v)  completion  of  65\u201370%  of  the  proposed  national \nexpressway  network,  with  the  total  length  reaching  55,000\u201360,000  km  by  2010.  In  Sichuan, \n29,000 km of new highways were completed in the 10th Five-Year Plan, of which 759 km were \nexpressways. The provincial government plans to build 19,000 km of highways during the 11th \nFive-Year Plan, with 1,401 km of expressways. \n \n4. \nWhile the national trunk highway system is being developed, accessibility in most of rural \nPRC is still low: 75 townships and 38,426 villages, mostly in the western regions, had no access \nto all-weather roads in 2005. Many townships and villages still depend on earth tracks that are \nnot  suitable  for  motorized  traffic  and  become  impassable  during  the  rainy  season.  Even  where \nall-weather  rural  roads  have  been  built,  the  standard  is  low,  maintenance  is  poor,  and  many \nroads need rehabilitation. Since 2003, the Government has been investing about CNY20 billion \nin rural road development annually. About 50,000 km of rural roads have been built and 150,000 \n                                                 \n1  The PRC had 41,005 km of expressways in 2005, second only to the United States. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nkm of rural roads have been upgraded annually. By the end of 2005, the Government had built \n494,276  km  of  county  roads  and  981,430  km  of  township  roads.  As  a  result,  about  99.8% \ntownships  and  94.3%  villages  were  connected  by  all-weather  roads  and  81.1%  townships  and \n55.5% villages were connected by paved roads. In February 2005 the PRC Government's State \nCouncil  approved  the  Rural  Road  Development  Plan,  which  aims  to  invest  CNY800  billion  in \ndeveloping  rural  roads  under  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010).  By  2010,  plans  call  for \nconnecting all townships and villages in the PRC with all-weather roads, and connecting 90% of \ntownships  and  80%  of  villages  with  paved  roads.  In  the  eastern  region,  100%  townships  and \nvillages would be linked with paved roads; the same target will be applied to all townships and \n88% villages in the central region, and to 90% of the townships and 50% of the villages in the \nwestern region.    \n \nBy  the  end  of  2005,  the  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (SPCD)  had \n5. \nbuilt  240,167  km  of  rural  roads,  of  which  36,047  km  were  county  roads,  49,735  km  were \ntownship roads, and 154,385 km were village roads. Based on the Sichuan Province Rural Road \nDevelopment  Plan,  the  SPCD  plans  to  build  30,000  km  of  township  roads  and  20,000  km  of \nvillage roads during the 11th Five-Year Plan, which targets completion of 11,250 km of county-to-\ntownship roads, ensuring that 80% of the province\u2019s townships are connected by  paved roads. \nThe Dazhou city government invested CNY50 million in 2004 and CNY20 million in 2005 in rural \nroad development. The city government\u2019s development plan calls every township and village in \nDazhou prefecture to be connected by paved roads to either a county center or a nearby trunk \nhighway. \n \n6. \nThe significant road sector development in the PRC during the 9th Five-Year Plan (1996\u2013\n2000)  resulted  in  road  investments  totaling  CNY924  billion,  or  CNY185  billion  per  year.  Road \nsector investment grew at an average annual rate of 16% during that time. During the 10th Five-\nYear Plan, total road investment was about CNY1.9 trillion\u2014more than double the figure of the \n9th  Five-Year  Plan.  The  vehicle  fleet  totaled  43.3 million  motor  vehicles.  Details  of  the  road \nsector analysis are in Appendix 2. The SPCD invested about CNY16.2 billion in the road sector \nin  2004,  of  which  CNY12.9  billion  was  allocated  to  construction  and  CNY1.4  billion  to \nmaintenance. During the 10th Five-Year Plan, road investment was about CNY71 billion. SPCD \nplans to increase road investment to CNY78 billion during the 11th Five-Year Plan (Appendix 3). \n \nB. \n \n7. \nSichuan  is  in  southwestern  PRC,  surrounded  by  mountains.  Its  isolation  has  been \nreduced by improved navigation on the Yangtze River, railway construction, and the construction \nof several major highways. The bulk of the population is concentrated on the flat, fertile plain in \nthe  east  and  central  east,  but  the  province  contains  several  poverty-stricken  areas  in  its \nmountainous  periphery,  where  the  Project  is  located.  Despite  rapid  economic  development  in \nrecent years, Sichuan ranks seventh lowest of all provinces in terms of gross domestic product \nper capita\u2014CNY8,440 in 2005, or 61% of the national average. The per capita rural income was \nCNY2,803,  or  86%  of  the  national  average.  About  one-third  of  Sichuan's  counties  are  officially \ndesignated as poor. There are 137,800 people considered rural poor (i.e., have annual per capita \nincomes  of  less  than  CNY900)  in  the  project  area,  equivalent  to  6.5%  of  the  total  provincial \npopulation. \n \n8. \nBased on the findings of a feasibility study undertaken under an ADB-financed technical \nassistance (TA),2 one reason for high poverty in the project area is slow economic growth, which \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Western Roads Development \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nProject. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nin  turn  is  partially  a  result  of  inadequate  infrastructure.  Despite  having  received  considerable \ninvestments, the road network in the project area is still inadequate and does not provide efficient \ntransport access to markets and social services such as education and health. While 61% of the \ntownships  in  the  project  area  are  accessible  via  unpaved  roads,  only  39%  are  connected  with \npaved  roads.  Not  all  the  villages  in  the  project  area  are  served  by  public  bus.  The  local \ngovernments  have  upgraded  some  rural  roads  to  improve  access  to  several  townships  and \nvillages, which are now served by bus as a result of these road improvements. Because vehicle \nownership  in  the  project  area  is  low,  bus  services  are  a  vital  element  of  the  transport  system. \nDespite these improvements, the quality of access to many villages remains unsatisfactory, with \nlow-standard and poorly maintained roads often closed by landslides, flooding, and snowfall. \n \n9. \nThe  impact  of  road  investments  on  poverty  reduction  is  supported  by  the  results  of \nstudies  and  evaluations  of  several  completed  road  projects  financed  by  ADB3 and  the  World \nBank. 4  Well-integrated  road  development  helps  ensure  that  the  benefits  derived  from  the \nexpressway filter down to the poor. Benefits\u2014which include transport cost savings, time savings, \nand  an  increase  in  incomes\u2014will  be  passed  on  through  the  transport  chain  to  townships  and \nvillages.  These  results  affirm  the  relevance  of  ADB\u2019s  strategy  in  the  PRC  road  sector.  A  case \nstudy  in  Shaanxi  Province  found  a  correlation  between  improved  roads  and  poverty  reduction; \nspecifically  (i)  3.2  poor people  are lifted  out of poverty  for  every  CNY10,000  invested  in  roads; \nand (ii) for every 1% increase in road-kilometers per capita, household consumption increases by \n0.08%.5 Benefits for rural poor areas include lower transport costs; lower input costs; expanded \nagricultural  support  services;  improved  farming  practices;  greater  access  to  urban  jobs;  and \nbetter access to health, education, and social services.6  \n \nTo  help  the  Government  develop  its  road  sector  strategy  and  investment  projects, \n10. \nexternal  assistance  has  been  provided  mainly  by  ADB,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC), and the World Bank (Appendix 4). Since 1991, ADB has provided 33 loans, \ntotaling  nearly  $6.6  billion,  to  finance  4,455  km  of  expressways,  together  with  8,964  km  of \nassociated local road networks. Since 1995, local roads have been included in the scope of road \nprojects  to  make  ADB\u2019s  interventions  in  the  road  sector  more  pro-poor.  Of  the  ADB-financed \nprojects,  18  have  been  completed  and  are  open  to  traffic.  ADB  has  also  provided  60  TAs, \ntotaling $32 million, to the road sector. The advisory TAs have addressed policy and institutional \nreforms,  poverty  impact  of  road  projects,  rural  road  development  strategy,  rural  transport \nservices,  road  safety,7 human  resource  development,  transport  pricing,  commercialization  and \ncorporatization, and the mobilization of private financial resources. The World Bank has provided \nabout  $6.8  billion  and  JBIC  has  provided  about  \u00a5219  billion  to  finance  road  investments.  ADB \ncoordinates with the World Bank and JBIC. Each major development partner focuses on different \ncorridors, while information related to policy advice is shared across the development community. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3  In  Sichuan  and  Yunnan  provinces,  construction  of  expressways  complemented  by  upgrading  local  roads  was \nassociated  with a significant increase in rural incomes in the project area.

The rural poor \nhave limited mobility beyond their immediate communities because of their geographical isolation \nand  the  high  cost  of  motorized  transport.  As  a  result,  they  generally  view  local  roads  as  a  key \ninfrastructure investment priority. Better roads promote the transition from a subsistence-farming \nrural  economy  to  a  cash-crop  and  more  diversified  economy  with  a  higher  and  more  stable \nincome  flow  to  rural  households.  Better  integration  of  the  local  roads  into  the  trunk  highway \nsystem will help bring benefits to the poor more effectively. \n \n12. \nThe  dialogue  with  the  Government  focused  on  the  need  to  integrate  a  local  road \ncomponent into the Project, with ADB financing, to establish a credible linkage between poverty \nreduction  and  ADB\u2019s  assistance  based  on  the  experience  of  the  ongoing  and  completed  ADB-\nfinanced  road  projects  since  1995. 8 The  SPCD  agreed  to  integrate  a  local  road  component \ncomprising  430  km  of  local  roads  (Appendix  5).  The  target  areas  for  this  component  were \nselected from the Sichuan Provincial Rural Road Development Plan based on population density, \npoverty incidence, and road network efficiency. These roads are often in poor condition and are \nnot passable during the rainy season. Upon completion, they will connect the poor townships and \nvillages  in  the  Project\u2019s  hinterland  with  the  main  trunk  highway.  The  SPCD  further  agreed  to \nallocate $8.0 million from the ADB loan to the 10 local roads (28 km) that are directly linked to \nthe  project  expressway,  thereby  establishing  a  direct  linkage  between  ADB\u2019s  assistance  and \npoverty reduction. The local road component, together with the expressway, will serve 2.1 million \npeople in the project area, of whom about 137,800, or 6.5%, are considered rural poor (i.e., have \nannual  per  capita  incomes  of  less  than  CNY900).  A  TA 9  is  being  provided  to  help  the \nGovernment strengthen a road network planning capacity that better integrates expressways and \nlocal  roads  to  meet  communities\u2019  needs,  and  that  improves  road-agency  personnel's  cross-\ndisciplinary skills and tools. \n \nRural  Road  Development.  Rural  roads  (1.48  million  km  of  county  and  township  roads \n13. \nare classified as rural roads in the PRC10) play an important role in socioeconomic development \nand  poverty  reduction  in  the  countryside  by  providing  basic  accessibility  to  jobs,  markets,  and \nsocial services for 745 million rural residents. However, the PRC's rural road network is largely \nunderdeveloped in terms of both quality and coverage, and does not provide adequate access to \nlarge  parts  of  the  hinterland.  Furthermore,  most  rural  roads  are  in  poor  condition  because  of \nproblems  in  planning,  design  and  construction,  maintenance,  and  financing.  The  Ministry  of \nCommunications  (MOC)  is  aware  of  the  issues  and  is  responding  to  rural  areas'  need  for \nimproved  accessibility  (see  para.  4).  While  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  development  of  the  trunk \nhighway has so far been significant, its impact on secondary- and tertiary-road development has \nbeen  limited.  During  a  high-level  dialogue  meeting  with  the  Government  in  March  2006,  the \nGovernment agreed to explore ways to extend ADB assistance to rural roads. An ongoing ADB-\nfinanced  TA  for  Rural  Road  Development  Strategy,  which  is  formulating  a  rural  road \ndevelopment  strategy  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  rural  road  investments,  will  provide  a \nuseful guide on this initiative. \n \n                                                 \n8  Since  1995,  the  scope  of  ADB-financed  road  projects  has  been  expanded  to  enhance  their  impacts  on  poverty \nreduction by integrating local road improvements to benefit poor communities. The local road components of these \nprojects are being implemented or have been completed successfully, helping improve living standards of the poor \nin the project area. \n\n9  ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n10 In addition, there are some 1.54 million km of village roads that are not included in the Ministry of Communications' \n\nofficial statistics because they do not meet its technical standards. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nPolicy Reform in Road Transport. The operating efficiency of the road transport industry \n14. \nis low partly because the policy and regulatory framework is not yet suitable for a market economy. \nAlso, operations, management, and maintenance practices of road transport operators need to be \nimproved. To improve the situation, assistance was provided under a recently completed TA11 for \nPolicy Reform in Road Transport, which reviewed the current issues in road freight and passenger \ntransport  and  prepared  a  road  transport  action  plan,  recommending  policy  and  regulatory \nmeasures to improve its efficiency, such as deregulation in passenger fare control and bus-route \nselection. The road transport action plan is being considered by the Government for pilot testing in \nselected  provinces,  including  Gansu  and  Yunnan.  This  would  help  enhance  the  impact  of  road \ninfrastructure development efforts conducted under ADB-financed road projects. \n \n15. \nCorporate  Governance.  In  Sichuan,  expressway  construction  and  operation  were \nseparated  from  the  provincial  government  under  previous  ADB-financed  road  projects.  This \ncorporatization  has  promoted  corporate  governance  and  improved  the  operational  efficiency  of \nexpressways.  The  SPCD  established  on  3  August  2006  the  Sichuan  Dashaan  Expressway \nCompany  Limited  (SDEC),  which  will  be  responsible  for  construction  and  operations  of  the \nproject  expressway.  It  will  be  entitled  to  collect  tolls  and  retain  toll  revenue  and  will  repay  the \nproposed  loan.  SPCD  and  SDEC  will  enter  into  a  concession  framework  agreement \n(Supplementary  Appendix  A)  by  31  December  2008  to  ensure  autonomy  of  operations, \nencourage  the  establishment  of  road  performance  indicators,  and  facilitate  contracting  out  of \noperations  and  maintenance.  The  SDEC  will  prepare  a  corporate  development  plan  by  31 \nDecember 2009 to assure high standards of corporate governance, management practices, and \nfinancial  reporting.  The  corporatization  process  will  be  guided  by  the  model  documents 12 \ndeveloped  under  an  earlier  ADB-financed  TA. 13 To  help  with  the  process  of  corporatization, \ntraining will be provided under the loan to the staff of SDEC. \n \n16. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  In  the  PRC,  the  private  sector  has  been  involved  in  the \nroad  sector  through  cooperative  joint  ventures,  securitization  through  initial  public  offerings, \nrevenue bond financing involving the sale of rated notes backed by a pledge of an entity\u2019s cash-\nflow sources, and the build-operate-transfer method (Supplementary Appendix B). For this Project, \nin  line  with  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  development  strategy,14 consideration  was  given  to  various \napproaches  to  highway  financing  recommended  under  an  ADB-financed  TA  (footnote  13). 15 \nCapacity  to  attract  private  financing,  particularly  equity  capital,  for  road  projects  such  as  the \nproject  expressway\u2014with  low  initial  demand  and  low  financial  returns  but  high  long-term \neconomic returns\u2014is limited. Therefore, project construction will be financed from public sources. \nPrivate sector financing options, including contracting out operation and maintenance (O&M) to \nthe  private  sector,  will  be  examined  before  operations  start.  SPCD  has  involved  the  private \nsector in four expressways,16 raising about CNY4 billion, including securitization of the Chengdu\u2013\nChongqing expressway on the Hong Kong stock exchange. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2004.

Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC, and Sichuan is no exception. In \n17. \n2005, there were 567,753 road accidents, causing 451,810 injuries and 99,217 fatalities, in the \nPRC; in Sichuan province the figures were 29,528 reported accidents, 30,906 injuries, and 4,415 \nfatalities. The Ministry of Public Security, which is responsible for enforcement of traffic laws and \nregulations,  is  committed  to  reducing  accidents  through  improved  safety  of  vehicles,  driver \ntraining,  and  improved  traffic  management.  ADB  is  assisting  the  Ministry  of  Public  Security  in \nimproving  road  safety  through  an  ongoing  TA.17 The  Sichuan  road  traffic  safety  ordinance  was \nmade  effective  on  1  March  2006,  providing  detailed  provincial  implementing  regulations  for  the \n2004 Road Transport Safety Law. Under the Project, the Sichuan expressway traffic police will \nestablish a team to patrol the new expressway, enforce traffic regulations, and maintain smooth \ntraffic  flow.  To  address  road  safety  issues,  the  Project  will  include  the  following:  (i)  vehicle-\nweighing  stations,  (ii)  road  safety  training  for  staff  of  SPCD,  (iii) safety  audit  during  design  and \nconstruction, (iv) public awareness and education campaigns geared toward accident prevention, \nand (v) a traffic enforcement program. Road safety for the local roads will be the responsibility of \nthe local traffic police. An integrated action plan has been drawn up to help agencies concerned \nimprove road safety in the project area. These will be carried out with the assistance of a road-\nsafety specialist financed under the loan (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n18. \nVehicle  Emissions. With the rapid increase in vehicle ownership, vehicle emissions will \ndamage the environment if mitigation measures are not taken. Fragmented responsibility, lack of \ninterdepartmental coordination, and an inadequate database and monitoring system prevent the \nformulation  of  specific  targets  for  a  reduction  in  vehicle  emissions.  SPCD,  in  coordination  with \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau and with assistance from an international consultant, will take \nthe  following  measures  to  control  the  vehicle  emissions  in  the  project  area:  (i)  motor  vehicle \nemissions control provisions will be included in the tendering documents for gas stations along \nthe  expressway;  (ii)  similar  provisions  will  be  included  in  the  tendering  documents  for  bus \ncompanies and transport service providers using the expressway services; (iii) implementation of \nan  air-quality  monitoring  system  along  the  expressway;  and  (iv)  conducting  a  capacity-building \nand  training  program  to  strengthen  staff  skills  in  relevant  aspects  of  motor  vehicle  emissions \ncontrol.  Help  will  be  provided  under \ninternational  consulting  services  program \n(Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nD. \n \nThe  SPCD  has  carried  out  four  internationally  financed  road  projects 18 without  major \n19. \nproblems.  The  safeguard  policies  on  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeople  have  been  met.  Lessons  learned  from  the  Chengdu\u2013Nanchong  expressway  project19 \ninclude  the  following:  (i)  more  detailed  geological  investigations  should  be  conducted  before \nfinalizing  bidding  documents;  (ii)  the  local  road  component  should  be  integrated  into  the \nexpressway development component to enhance poverty impact; (iii) a detailed resettlement plan \nshould be drawn up, implemented, and then assessed through a detailed measurement survey; \n(iv) expressway construction and operations should be separated from the provincial government \nfunction  to  improve  corporate  governance;  and  (v)  local  communications  bureaus  should  be \n\nLessons \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2005.

These  lessons  were  brought  to  the  attention  of  the \nGovernment and SPCD and reflected in the project design. \n \nPerformance  reviews20 of  completed  ADB-financed  road  projects  elsewhere  in  the  PRC \n20. \nindicate  that,  in  general,  the  projects  facilitated  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  as \nenvisaged during project preparation. Completed projects show that (i) ADB\u2019s safeguard policies \nwere  met;  (ii) loan  covenants  were  generally  complied  with;  (iii) people\u2019s  living  standards  have \nbeen  improved  through  better  access  to  markets,  jobs,  and  social  services;  (iv)   O&M  of  ADB-\nreport; 21 \nfinanced \n(v) corporatization strengthened corporate governance and raised funds for road development in \nHunan and Jilin provinces; and (vi) recent projects helped raise awareness among policy makers \nof  the  importance  of  addressing  key  issues  concerning  road  safety  and  vehicle  emissions. \nProject  completion  reports  prepared  for  17  road  projects  concluded  that  16  were  highly  or \ngenerally  successful  and  1  partly  successful.22 The  project  performance  audit  reports  for  eight \nroad projects rated the projects as either highly successful or successful. A development impact \nstudy 23 of  the  1,867 km  Beijing\u2013Tongjiang  expressway  route,  for  which  ADB  provided  loans \ntotaling  $1.2  billion,  showed  that  the  improved  road  network  significantly  helped  develop \nnortheastern PRC.  \n \nE. \n \nADB's  operational  strategy24 in  the  road  sector  supports  (i) construction  of  roads  that \n21. \nconnect major growth centers and link the hinterland economies; (ii) integration of the network so \nthat the national trunk highway system is supported by a system of local roads, particularly roads \nthat  provide  access  to  poor  areas;  (iii) promotion  of  road  safety  and  reduction  of  vehicle \nemissions; (iv) institutional strengthening to increase the commercial orientation and efficiency of \nexpressway  organizations;  (v) improvement  of  highway  planning  and  evaluation  techniques; \n(vi) adoption of pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport capacity; and (vii) use of \nalternative  methods  of  investment  financing,  including  private  sector  participation.  ADB  road \nsector assistance targets the less developed central and western provinces, where most of the \npoor  live.  The  proposed  Project  is consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  development  priorities  and  ADB\u2019s \nstrategy. \n \n22. \nDespite considerable investments in the road sector, the PRC road network still does not \nprovide  efficient  transport  to  large  parts  of  the  country\u2014particularly  to  poorer  inland  regions  like \nSichuan. Better transport links are necessary to improve economic efficiency, foster national and \ninternational trade, facilitate interregional integration, and reduce poverty. The provinces of western \nPRC  lack  high-class  road  infrastructure.  The  road  network  must  be  improved  to  facilitate \nsustainable  economic  development  and  ensure  that  the  social  and  economic  benefits  of \ninvestments in the region reach poor, rural areas. To enhance economic development and reduce \npoverty  in  western  PRC,  the  Government  is  implementing  the  Western  Region  Development \n                                                 \n20 ADB.  2001.

It will complement three completed or ongoing ADB-financed \nprojects in Sichuan that likewise concentrate on developing the Xi\u2019an-Kunming road corridor. \n \nDuring  the  2007  Country  Programming  Midterm  Review  Mission,  the  Government \n23. \nreconfirmed its request for ADB assistance for the Project. A feasibility study was completed by \nSPCD in November 2004. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was prepared in October \n2005, and a resettlement plan in March 2006. ADB provided TA (footnote 2) to supplement the \ngovernment  studies.  Fact-finding  was  undertaken  from  28  February  to  16  March  2006,  and \nappraisal from 30 May to 14 June 2006. The Project was formulated on the basis of the findings \nof  ADB  missions, \nthe  Government,  stakeholder  consultations, \ndiscussions  with  other  funding  agencies,  and  recommendations  of  the  feasibility  study  and  TA \nconsultants. \n \n\ninformation  provided  by \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n24. \nThe impact of the Project is to develop an integrated road transport system that supports \nsustainable economic growth in Sichuan province. The outcome of the Project is improved road \ntransport efficiency and safety in the project area. The Project will (i) reduce traffic accidents and \nvehicle  operating  costs;  (ii)  improve  access  between  Chongqing  and  Xi\u2019an,  two  major  growth \ncenters in western PRC; (iii) provide additional transport capacity to accommodate growing traffic \nvolume; and (iv) provide improved access to markets and social services in a poor area. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n25. \nThe  Project  has  the  following  outputs:  (i)  construction  of  a  143  km,  four-lane  access-\ncontrolled toll expressway from Dazhou to Wanyuan, including access roads, interchanges with \ntoll stations, tunnels, bridges, administrative stations, and service areas; (ii) upgrading of 430 km \nof local roads to improve access to poor remote areas; (iii) promoting corporate governance by \nseparating  expressway  construction  and  operations  from  the  provincial  government;  and  (iv) \ncapacity  building  in  project  management,  quality  control,  road  safety,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation. The key activities needed to realize these outputs are civil works for the expressway \nand local roads, equipment, resettlement, consulting services, and training. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n26. \nPublic  Transport  Services.  Efficient  transport  services,  including  passenger  transport \nstations  and  logistic  centers,  are  important  components  of  a  well  functioning  transportation \nsystem.  Dazhou  is  one  of  the  eight  provincial  transport  hubs  in  Sichuan.  Since  2002,  five \npassenger  stations  and  five  freight  stations  have  been  established  in  the  project  area.  These \nstations,  together  with  the  existing  and  proposed  local  roads,  will  form  an  integrated \ntransportation  network.  Rural  passenger  stations  are  crucial  to  improving  the  mobility  of  rural \nresidents  and  the  accessibility  of  rural  areas.  In  the  city\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan,  50  new  rural \npassenger  stations  are  to  be  built  or  renovated;  this  will  complement  the  proposed  Project.  An \nassessment of transport services is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nRural  Road  Maintenance.  Rural  roads  in  Sichuan  province  are  not  always  well \n27. \nmaintained,  mainly  because  both  funds  and  skills  are  lacking.  To  improve  rural  road \nmaintenance,  the  State  Council  issued  a  new  policy  for  financing  and  managing  village  road \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nmaintenance  in  October  2005.  In  line  with  this  policy,  the  Dazhou  prefecture  government  has \nallocated  special  budget  that  will  increase  the  annual  maintenance  budget  from  over  CNY70 \nmillion in 2005 to about CNY120 million in 2006. As part of the Project, a plan to strengthen rural \nroad  maintenance  (Appendix  6)  was  prepared.  The  plan  includes  (i)  engineering  measures  to \nhelp  Dazhou  Municipal  Communications  Bureau  in  designing  sustainable  rural  roads,  with \nfunctional  classification  and  standards,  to  optimize  the  use  of  resources,  and  prioritize \nmaintenance  programs;  (ii)  maintenance  measures  to  facilitate  implementation;  (iii)  operation \nmeasures  to  establish  a  monitoring  system  and  promote  a  preventive  maintenance  approach; \n(iv) capacity building to enhance local skills; and (v) adoption of efficient rules for access to and \nuse of the scarce maintenance funds, and identification of innovative ways of mobilizing further \nfunds.  The  international  consultants  will  help  in  the  implementation  of  this  plan  during  project \nimplementation. \n \nIntelligent  Transport  System. An intelligent transport system (ITS)25 on expressways is \n28. \nbeing introduced in accordance with the national ITS architecture prepared by the National ITS \nCenter.  For  the  proposed  Project,  an  ITS  action  plan  has  been  developed  to  (i)  reduce  toll \npayment  delay;  (ii)  facilitate  integration  of  an  advanced  toll  payment  system  with  the  province-\nwide  expressway  toll  system;  (iii)  introduce  variable  message  displays  to  improve  road-user \ninformation;  (iv)  assist  with  emergencies  and  promote  information  sharing  with  health, \nambulance, and  relevant  agencies; (v)  improve  traffic  enforcement,  infrastructure maintenance, \nand  computerized  management  of  urgent  incidents;  (vi)  improve  safety  through  enhanced \nmonitoring and detection of black-spot and property damage locations and overloaded vehicles; \nand  (vii)  coordinate  the  activities  of  emergency  service  agencies.  The  ITS  will  be  designed  to \nproduce  monitoring  reports  on  traffic  composition,  road-accident  frequency,  and  other  key \nindicators. The use of an ITS will be built into the Project through procurement of equipment and \ntraining (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \n29. \nAsset  Management. Expressway companies in Sichuan do not make significant use of \nmodern techniques in their asset management and road maintenance programs. The SDEC will \nuse  a  computerized  database  which  will:  (i)  enable  more  robust  decision  making  based  on  a \ngreater  pool  of  data,  (ii)  enable  the  sharing  of  information  and  experiences  with  external \nagencies, (iii) enhance professional skills, and (iv) produce more accurate data that encourages \npolicy  makers  to  prioritize  asset  management  and  maintenance.  Various  measures  will  be \nintroduced  with  the  help  of  the  international  consultants  to  facilitate  implementation  in  three \nphases: (i) immediate: measures for implementation when SDEC\u2019s organizational structure is put \nin  place,  (ii)  short-term:  measures  for  implementation  before  expressway  completion,  and  (iii) \nmedium-term: measures for implementation within the first 2\u20133 years of expressway operations \n(Supplementary Appendix E). \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  to  be  $1.425  billion,  including  taxes  (Table  1). \n\n30. \nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n25 The  application  of  the  information  technology  to  transport  is  referred  to  as  ITS.  It  provides  the  ability  to  gather, \norganize,  analyze,  use,  and  share  information  about  transport  systems  and  their  efficient  use.  ITS  for  developing \ncountries was prepared by the World Bank (World Bank. 2004. ITS for Developing Countries.

The  PRC  will  be  the  Borrower  of  the  loan.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.35%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the \ndraft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  loan  will  finance  14%  of  the \ntotal  project  cost.  The  remaining  cost  will  be  financed  by  the  MOC,  the  Sichuan  provincial \ngovernment  (SPG),  and  cofinancing  through  a  loan  from  the  China  Development  Bank,  which \nhas appraised the Project (Table 2). The MOC and SPG have made budgetary provisions for the \ncounterpart funds. The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to SPG and through SPG, to \nSDEC on the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan, with SDEC bearing \nthe exchange rate and interest rate variation risk and undertaking the obligations in the Project \nAgreement to the extent applicable to it. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nChina Development Bank \nMinistry of Communications \nSichuan Provincial Government \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n200 \n556 \n229 \n440 \n1,425 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n% \n14 \n39 \n16 \n31 \n100 \n\n \n\n     Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n \nF. \n \n32. \nProject  Management.  The  SPCD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation of the Project and direct implementation of the project expressway, and provide \nguidance to the local communications bureaus for carrying out the local roads component of the \nProject.  The  SPCD  has  sufficient  experience,  having  already  implemented  three  ADB-financed \nroad  projects  in  Sichuan.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  SPCD  has  shown  that  the \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nImplementation  Period.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  about  5  years,  from \n\nProject will have an adequate financial management system in place. The financial management \nassessment  has  been  completed  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  SDEC  will  be  responsible  for \ncarrying  out  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  project  expressway  and  the  local  roads \nfinanced  by  the  ADB  loan.  It  will  be  responsible  for  the  physical  implementation  activities  on  a \ndaily basis and the preparation of the progress reports of the Project as well as for the O&M of \nthe project expressway and the above mentioned local roads. The general manager of SDEC will \nact  as  the  Project  Director  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  above  mentioned  project \ncomponents,  including  approval  of  contracts  and  payments.  Organization  charts  for  SPCD  and \nSDEC are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n33. \nJanuary 2008 to June 2012 (Appendix 8). \n \n34. \nProcurement.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  earthworks  contracts  will  be  divided  into  16 \npackages,  which  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding.  International \ncompetitive bidding will be handled by a tendering company that is well qualified to perform these \ntasks.  All  other  packages\u2014two  expressway  pavement,  one  maintenance  equipment,  one \nexpressway  earth  work,  two  traffic  management  facilities,  two  planting  and  landscaping \ncontracts, two ancillary facilities, and one tunnel facility\u2014will be financed by the government and \nprocured  under  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption policy will be included in all documents and contracts related to the bidding for and \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  To  help  facilitate  procurement  process,  a  procurement  plan, \nshowing  details  of  each  contract,  method  of  procurement,  schedule,  and  ADB  procedures,  has \nbeen prepared (Appendix 9 and Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n35. \nthe \nGovernment,  will  be  overseen  by  a  chief  supervision  engineer  and  will  involve  2,752  person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services.  National  consultants  will  also  be  engaged  to  prepare \nbidding  and  bid-evaluation  documents,  a  project  performance  management  system,  and \nenvironmental monitoring systems. \n \nThe Project will provide 51 person-months of international consulting services under the \n36. \nloan  financing  to  (i) help  with  project  management  during  the  construction  period;  (ii) provide \nexpertise in tunnel construction; (iii) conduct a safety audit of the project design, and make safety \nrecommendations on the completed construction works; (iv) help set up and implement quality-\ncontrol procedures; (v) monitor the environmental impact of the Project and provide guidance on \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures;  (vi) assist  with  formulating  a  human  resource  development \nand  training  program;  and  (vii) help  establish  a  project  performance  management  system.  The \nteam  leader  will  be  in  the  field  during  the  construction  period  and  will  act  as  assistant  chief \nsupervision  engineer,  (i) helping  the  chief  supervision  engineer  certify  variation  orders, \ncontractors'  monthly  payments,  and  subcontracting  documents;  and  (ii) helping  establish  a \ncontracts  management  system.  All  consultants  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  based  on  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  using  a  quality-\ncost  ratio  of  80:20  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix I. \n \n\nConsulting  Services.  Construction  supervision,  which  will  be \n\nfinanced  by \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nfor  civil  works. 26  The  advance  contracting  covers \n\nAdvance  Contracting. Given the high priority of the Project, ADB approved on 24 May \n37. \n2006  an  advance  contracting \nthe \nprequalification of contractors, bidding, and bid evaluation, but will not include contract awards. \nThe advance contracting will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nThe  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the  advance  contracting  does  not  commit \nADB to financing the Project. \n \n38. \nAnticorruption Policy. During project preparation, ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended from time to time) was explained to and discussed with central and local government \nofficials. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  documents  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProject. In particular, all contracts financed by  ADB in connection with the Project shall include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the \nExecuting Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the Project. \n \n39. \nSpecifically,  the  following  actions  will  be  taken  to  prevent  corruption  in  the  Project: \n(i) officials from the Discipline and Inspection Bureau will be resident in project offices to oversee \nbidding, construction, and operations; (ii) an internal audit unit will be established in SDEC; (iii) a \ntwo-contract system will be adopted, where the winner of a civil works contract must also sign an \nanticorruption  contract  with  the  employer;  (iv) liaison  meetings  between  SPCD,  SDEC,  and  the \nProsecutor's Office will be initiated to discuss warnings or information on corrupt practices; and \n(v) records and accounts of the contractors related to the Project will be periodically reviewed to \nensure that fund withdrawal and settlement procedures are being followed. \n\n \n\n40. \nDisbursement Arrangements. All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007). Since most payments will be made \nfor large contracts well above $100,000, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used \nto withdraw the loan funds. If the government funds are used first for eligible expenditures, ADB's \nreimbursement  procedure  will  be  used.  Statement  of  expenditures  will  be  applied  to  reimburse \neligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment  not  exceeding  $100,000  to  expedite  fund  flows. \nBefore  disbursement,  the  PRC  Government  will  certify  to  ADB  that  the  on-lending  agreement, \nwhich  will  include  the  terms  and  conditions  required  under  the  loan  agreement,  will  have  been \nexecuted on behalf of SPG and SDEC and will have become effective and binding in accordance \nwith its terms. \n \n41. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  SPCD  and  SDEC  will  maintain  separate \naccounts  for  the  Project  and  related  financial  statements.  Independent  auditors  whose \nqualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB will audit their accounts \nannually in accordance with appropriate and consistently applied auditing standards. SPCD and \nSDEC will submit to ADB, within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal year, certified copies \nof audited project accounts and financial statements and an auditor\u2019s report on the Project, all in \nthe  English  language.  A  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  statement  of  expenditures,  if \nany,  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  auditor\u2019s  report.  During  project  implementation,  SPCD  and \nSDEC  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports.  To  facilitate  project  post-evaluation,  SPCD  and \nSDEC will furnish ADB with a completion report within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n\n                                                 \n26 Advance contracting was reported in the May 2006 internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nProject  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  To  demonstrate  the  impact  of  its \n42. \noperations  on  development  and  to  be  accountable  to  stakeholders,  ADB  uses  the  project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS). SPCD agreed to use the proposed set of indicators for \nmonitoring  and  evaluating  to  what  extent  the  Project  met  its  goals  and  objectives.  The  key \nindicators  and  assumptions  outlined  under  the  impact,  outcome,  and  outputs  in  Appendix  1 \n(design and monitoring framework) and Appendix 10 (monitoring of socioeconomic and poverty \nimpacts) will form the core data required for assessment. SPCD will refine the baseline values for \nimpact  indicators  prior  to  project  implementation  and  will  update  them  during  project \nimplementation. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by gender. SPCD will measure \nthe  indicators  for  project  evaluation  and  report  the  findings  to  ADB  on  project  inception, \ncompletion, and annually for 3 years after completion. The level of effort for the PPMS tasks will \ninclude:  1  person-month  of  international  expertise  to  design  and  set  up  the  PPMS  and  train \nnational  consultants  on  monitoring  methodology;  and  8  person-months  of  national  expertise  to \nmanage  the  database  and  carry  out  village-level  surveys,  analysis,  and  reporting,  for  which \nSPCD  will  recruit  an  independent  local  institute.  To  facilitate  the  assessment  of  the  Project\u2019s \nsocioeconomic  impact,  the  terms  of  reference  to  monitor  and  evaluate  project  impacts  are \nincluded among the consulting services to be provided under the Project. \n \n43. \nProject Review. In 2009, SPCD, SDEC, and ADB will carry out a midterm review of the \nProject, covering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, \npoverty  reduction,  resettlement,  economic,  financial,  and  other  relevant  aspects  that  may  have \nan impact on the Project\u2019s performance and continuing viability. \n \n44. \nCapacity  Building.  Based  on  the  PPTA  findings,  SPCD  and  SDEC  need  to  build  their \ncapacity  to  manage  road  sector  development  and  expressway  operations  more  effectively  in \norder  to  cope  with  increased  road  construction  activities.  A  human  resource  development  plan \nwill  be  drawn  up  with  the  help  of  the  international  consultants.  The  plan  will  identify  training \nrequirements  and  determine  staff  needs  based  on  a  survey  of  skill  levels  in  key  areas.  It  will \ninvolve  35  person-months  of  international  training,  covering  expressway  commercialization, \nhighway  operations  and  management,  tunnel  operation  and  management,  intelligent  transport \nsystem, \ntunnel \nfinancial  management,  highway  maintenance  and  asset  management, \nconstruction  and  technology,  traffic  engineering  and  road  safety,  and  construction  risk \nmanagement. Findings from the training will be disseminated in Sichuan through a local institute. \nThe SDEC will, with the help of the international consultants, launch a 50 person-month training \nprogram  through  the  Sichuan  Communications  and  Technology  Management  College  to \nenhance  the  local  communications  bureau  staff\u2019s  skills  in  road  maintenance  and  traffic \nmanagement, and thus ensure sustainable operation of the local road component. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\nA. \n \n45. \nThe project expressway is an important section of the Chongqing\u2013Xi\u2019an line, one of the \neight Western Development Corridors. Other sections of this corridor are either completed or are \nbeing targeted for completion by 2011. Traffic volume on the project expressway is expected to \ngrow  from  7,800  passenger  car  units  per  day  in  2012,  to  19,000  units  per  day  in  2022,  and  to \n42,400 units per day in 2032 (Appendix 11). \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n46. \nTo meet growing transport demand in the project area, an analysis was undertaken of the \nvarious  options  for  transport  modes,  alignments,  technical  designs,  timing  of  investments,  and \nfinancing  modalities  as  part  of  the  national  and  provincial  transport  network  plan.  It  was \nconcluded  that  road  transport  should  be  improved  through  construction  of  an  expressway \nsupported  by  complementary  local  road  improvements.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) was calculated by comparing situations with and without the Project. Without the Project, \nthe  traffic  volume  would  exceed  the  optimum  capacity  of  the  existing  National  Highway  210, \nwhich would become congested, thereby increasing travel time, vehicle operating costs (VOC), \nand  the  number  of  accidents.  With  the  Project,  (i)  travel  time  would  decline  because  travel \ndistances would be shorter and travel speeds would increase; (ii) VOC would decline because of \nfaster and smoother travel on the expressway; and (iii) the accident rate would decline because \ncongestion  would  decrease,  road  safety  features  would  increase,  and  fast-  and  slow-moving \ntraffic  would  be  separated.  If  local  roads  are  not  upgraded,  the  mainly  poor  inhabitants  of  the \nProject's remote areas will be less mobile and less able to participate in mainstream economic \nactivities. The economic costs of the expressway reflect the resource costs for construction and \nO&M, as well as the loss of agricultural production from land lost permanently to the Project. The \neconomic  benefits  generated  by  the  expressway  include  (i) savings  in  VOC  as  a  result  of \nreduced road length and improved traffic conditions, (ii) time savings for road users, (iii) savings \nfrom avoided accidents, and (iv) benefits from generated traffic. The benefits from the local roads \nwere projected by taking into account VOC savings and producer surplus. \n \n47. \nThe  project  EIRR  is  projected  to  be  14.1%,  indicating  that  the  Project  is  economically \nviable  (Appendix 12).  Results  of  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  Project's \neconomic viability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 10% reduction in traffic volume, do \nnot  significantly  impact  economic  viability.  The  capital  cost  would  have  to  increase  by  23.9% \nfrom  the  projected  EIRR  to  fall  below  the  cutoff  rate  of  12%.  The  traffic  level  would  have  to \ndecrease  by  20.5%  to  cause  the  same  result.  In  light  of  experience  in  the  PRC  road  sector, \nvariations  of  such  magnitude  are  unlikely.  The  EIRR  was  calculated  separately  for  the \nexpressway  (13.5%)  and  for  local  roads  (32.6%).  The  economic  analysis  was  extended  to \nexamine  the  distribution  of  project  net  benefits  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  various \nbeneficiaries,  including  road  users  (passengers  and  freight),  labor,  and  the  Government.  Road \nusers will receive 86% of the total net benefits (Appendix 12). \n \nC. \n \nThe  proposed  toll  rates 27  for  the  expressway  are  considered  reasonable  to  attract \n48. \nsufficient  traffic  to  meet  the  criteria  for  economic  and  financial  rate  of  return.  The  SDEC  will \nundertake a toll analysis before opening the expressway, and each year for 5 years thereafter, to \nconfirm  that  the  toll  rate  is  optimal,  and  it  will  submit  the  results  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence.  If  an \nadjustment  of  the  toll  rate  is  required,  SDEC  will  submit  its  toll  adjustment  plans  for  ADB \napproval before getting approval from SPG. \n \nFinancial projections have been prepared for SDEC in accordance with ADB's Financial \n49. \nManagement and Analysis of Projects28 to assess the financial viability and sustainability of the \n\nFinancial Analysis and Projections \n\n                                                 \n27 The  proposed  toll  rates  are  CNY0.35\u2013CNY1.75  per  vehicle-km.  To  reduce  the  burden  of  the  toll  charges  on  low-\nincome local residents, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are exempt from tolls. The poor \nlocal  residents,  who  may  not  directly  use  the  project  expressway,  will  indirectly  benefit  from  reductions  in  freight \nrates. \n\n28 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nProject (Appendix 13). The projected financial statements indicate that financial revenues will be \nsufficient to cover O&M costs, income taxes, and debt service. Incremental costs and revenues \nwere derived by evaluating the financial position of SDEC. The financial internal rate of return for \nthe  expressway,  computed  after  taxes,  is  4.1%.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  3.1%.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  is  robust  under  adverse  conditions.  Based  on  the  financial  projections  and  financial \nevaluation  of  the  expressway  component,  the  Project  is  considered  financially  viable  and \nsustainable (Appendix 13).  \n \nD. \n \n50. \nThe project area includes Tongchuan district, Xuanhan county, and Wanyuan county\u2014all \nwithin Dazhou city in the mostly mountainous northeastern part of Sichuan. Tongchuan district is \nthe urban center of Dazhou city while the other two counties are mostly rural. The population of \nthe project area is 2.12 million, of whom 137,800 million, or 6.5%, are considered rural poor (i.e., \nhave  annual  per  capita  incomes  of  less  than  CNY900).  Gross  domestic  product  per  capita  is \nCNY10,991 in Tongchuan, CNY4,134 in Xuanhan, and CNY4,556 in Wanyuan. The rural poverty \nincidence  is  7.7%  for  Wanyuan,  6.8%  for  Xuanhan,  and  1.5%  for  Tongchuan.  There  are  no \nethnic minority villages in the project area. The Project will bring benefit to the project area by (i) \nimproving road conditions at the township level through the local road component, (ii) facilitating \neconomic growth in the project area through the expressway component, (iii) improving vehicle \ntransportation services to the major cities, and (iv) creating opportunities for employment under \nthe  Project.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  14,  and  a  full \npoverty reduction and social analysis is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n51. \nSmall  Business  Development.  There  is  potential  for  small  business  to  grow  rapidly  in \nthe  project  area.  However,  given  the  region's  major  growth  centers'  lack  of  connectivity  with \nefficient  transport  systems,  small  business  development  in  the  project  area  has  been \nconstrained. A strategy was prepared under the TA to help spur the growth of small businesses. \nThe strategy focuses on: (i) agricultural trading and industry in agricultural products such as fruit, \nprocessed fruit products, mushrooms, liquor, beer, and herbs; (ii) community-based tourism and \necotourism; (iii) distribution facilities (for the local market) and transport; and (iv) service-oriented \nbusinesses, such as restaurants, catering, gift shops, car repair, and carwashes (Appendix 15). \n \n52. \nRoadside  Stations.  Road  projects  have  traditionally  focused  on  expanding  transport \ncapacity  to  maximize  economic  impact.  Achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  requires \ninnovative approaches that diversify the benefits of transport infrastructure investment. With that \nin  mind,  roadside  stations 29  will  be  developed  to  link  roads  with  community  activities  and \nencourage safe driving. Roadside stations normally provide parking areas and ancillary facilities \nsuch  as  bus  terminals;  gasoline  stations;  information  centers  about  roads,  road  safety,  and \ntourism; local specialty markets; restaurants; and agro-processing facilities. \n \n53. \nImpact  on  HIV/AIDS.  There  is  a  risk  of  possible  increases  of  HIV/AIDS  cases  during \nproject  construction  through  sexual  transmission  and  drug  abuse  by  construction  workers.  To \nprevent the risk of HIV/AIDS associated with the Project, the local Centers for Disease Control \nwill  extend  their  preventive  measures  to  communities  in  the  project  area,  particularly  to  areas \n\n                                                 \n29 The  concept  of  roadside  stations  was  developed  in  Japan  to  link  road  users  and  communities,  thereby  facilitating \nlocal economic development. They are different from ordinary service areas because they (i) are designed with the \ninvolvement of local communities; (ii) link road users and local communities; (iii) provide business opportunities for \nlocal people; and (iv) can provide public services, including health care, education, and cultural activities, in addition \nto the normal restaurant and commercial services.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\naround construction sites. Measures will focus on construction workers and will include provision \nof  HIV  test  kits,  contraceptives,  education,  posters,  leaflets,  and  regular  services  such  as \nmonitoring  and  surveillance.  In  carrying  out  the  civil  works  contracts,  the  implementation \nmethods of epidemic prevention law will be followed. These mitigation measures will be carried \nout  in  collaboration  with  local  health  agencies  and  an  anti-AIDS  program  funded  by  the  United \nKingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International  Development  in  the  project  area.  The  SPCD  agreed  to \nimplement  a  social  development  action  plan  (SDAP)  to  extend  the  project  benefits  to  the  poor \nalong  the  project  roads  and  the  broader  project  area  (Appendix  16).    Regarding  women  and \nHIV/AIDS,  the  social  survey  shows  that  most  of  the  participants  are  aware  of  the  risks  of  the \nHIV/AIDS  and  its  preventative  measures.  Women  have  been  encouraged  to  participate  as \nconstruction  laborers.  It is  targeted  that  woman  should  perform  at  least  half  of  the  landscaping \nwork. \n \n54. \nStakeholder Consultations. Throughout the feasibility study, EIA, resettlement planning, \nand TA implementation stages, consultations were conducted with 3,627 representatives of local \ngovernment  agencies,  civil  society,  and  project-affected  people  to  discuss  the  various  project \noptions,  environmental  concerns,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues,  and  economic \ndevelopment  potential.  The  consultations  indicated  that  local  residents  supported  the  Project \nbecause  it  would  improve  their  access  to  jobs,  markets,  and  social  services.  Consultations \nenabled  local  stakeholders  to  express  their  opinions,  including  on  alignment  selection, \nresettlement,  and  compensation,  and  to  make  suggestions  to  improve  project  design  and \nimplementation (Appendix 17). \n \nE. \n \n55. \nADB has classified the Project as environmental category A. The EIA has been prepared \nby  the  National  Environmental  Science  Research  Institute  and  the  Sichuan  Communications \nDesign  and  Research  Institute,  and  it  was  approved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration on 1 August 2006. A summary EIA for the Project was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board \nof Directors and posted on its website on 16 May 2006. The EIA has assessed the environmental \nimpacts  of  the  project  expressway  and  prescribed  environmental  protection  and  mitigation \nmeasures. The proposed expressway passes about 100 m from protection area of Huae Nature \nReserve, and therefore special measures will be taken to minimize the potential adverse impacts \nto  the  reserve.  Another  environmental  issue  is  erosion  control.  For  this  purpose,  a  soil  erosion \nprevention plan was prepared. For the local road component, an environmental assessment and \nreview  procedure  was  prepared  to  ensure  mitigation  of  possible  environmental  impacts \n(Supplementary Appendix K). To ensure that all potential adverse environmental impacts of the \nProject  are  mitigated,  SPCD  will  implement  an  environmental  management  plan.  The \nenvironmental management plan will be incorporated in the bidding documents and contracts for \ncivil works. \n \nF. \n \n56. \nThis  is  an  involuntary  resettlement  category  A  project.  The  SPCD  has  prepared  a  draft \nresettlement  plan  (Appendix  18  and  Supplementary  Appendix  L)  based  on  its  feasibility  study, \ninvestigations  of  49  villages,  household  surveys,  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village \nleaders,  and  affected  households.  The  full  resettlement  plan  addresses  impacts  caused  by  the \nproposed construction of the 143 km expressway and 28 km of link roads. SPCD also plans to \nupgrade 402 km of existing local roads (township to village roads) using domestic funds. These \nroads  will  involve  little  or  no  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  SPCD  has  prepared  a  short \nresettlement  plan  for  these  roads  and  assured  ADB  that  any  affected  persons  will  receive  the \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nsame compensation standards. Since the resettlement plans are based on the SPCD feasibility \nstudy, it will be necessary for SPCD, prior to commencement of land acquisition, to prepare and \nsubmit  to  ADB  for  approval  updated  resettlement  plans  based  on  detailed  design  and \nmeasurement surveys. \n \n57. \nThe  project  expressway  will  cross  49  villages  in  2  counties  and  1  urban  district  from \nDazhou  city  to  the  border  with  Shaanxi  province.  An  estimated  779  ha  of  land  will  be \npermanently acquired, of which 40% is non-irrigated farmland, 10% is irrigated farmland, 1% is \norchard, 2% is housing plots, and 47% is woodland or wasteland. Based on the PRC\u2019s standard \nfor impact assessment, land acquisition is equivalent to the complete loss of farmland for 9,141 \npersons.  Since  the  expressway  will  actually  cross  many  parcels  of  scattered  farmland,  it  is \nprojected that the average loss of land per household will be 13%, which means the number of \npartially affected people will be about 55,000 persons. The Project will also temporarily occupy \n240  ha  during  construction  activities.  An  estimated  137,700  m2  of  houses  will  be  demolished, \nwhich will require the relocation of 1,148 households with 5,279 persons. \n \nThe SPCD and SDEC, in conjunction with the local land administration bureaus, will be \n58. \nresponsible for resettlement. Affected people were consulted about the likely impacts during the \nfeasibility  study,  and  resettlement  information  booklets  were  distributed  to  affected  villages. \nSPCD  and  SDEC  will  be  responsible  for  internal  supervision  and  monitoring.  Progress  reports \nwill  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis  until  resettlement  is  completed. \nSPCD will then prepare a resettlement completion report for submission to ADB. In addition, an \nindependent monitor will be contracted by SPCD to carry out external monitoring and evaluation \nand  prepare  monitoring  reports  for  submission  to  SPCD  and  ADB  every  6  months  until  the \ncompletion  of  resettlement  activities;  thereafter,  annual  evaluation  investigations  will  be \nconducted for at least 2 years and reported to SPCD and ADB. \n \nG. \n \n59. \nThe Project was formulated to reduce potential technical, economic, financial, and social \nrisks. The main technical risks are associated with extensive tunnels and bridges. To mitigate the \nrisks,  international  consultants  reviewed  the  proposed  design  and  construction  methods. \nSelection  of  contractors  will  focus  on  their  financial  and  technical  capability  to  handle  complex \nworks. During construction, monitoring and contract management information systems will be set \nup and implemented, with the assistance of the international consultants, for timely identification \nof  technical  problems  and  implementation  of  corrective  measures.  SPCD  has  experience,  and \nhas shown satisfactory performance, in implementing internationally financed projects. Economic \nperformance in the project-influenced area would have to deteriorate substantially for the Project \nto lose its economic viability. Regarding construction and operation of the expressway, there will \nbe financial risks associated with the level and composition of traffic, construction costs, skill of \nthe  commercial  managers,  and  tolls.  To  mitigate  the  financial  risks,  SDEC  will  build  up  a \ncommercial  business  environment  for  expressway  operations;  the  project  expressway  will \nreceive substantial equity from the government, and an optimal toll structure will be adopted. For \nprojects that generate revenue in domestic currency, there are risks associated with fluctuating \nexchange rates; these fluctuations are partially accounted for in the base-case calculations. An \nadverse  exchange  rate  change  of  30%  would  have  only  a  small  effect  on  the  financial  return. \nPotential social risks are associated with resettlement and HIV/AIDS infection; the resettlement \nplan and social action development plan include measures to mitigate those risks. \n \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, SPG, and SPCD have given the \n\n60. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n61. \nConstruction  Quality.  SPCD  and  SDEC  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  constructed  in \naccordance with the relevant Government standards. The international consultant designated as \nthe  team  leader  and  assistant  chief  supervision  engineer  will  review  and  help  the  chief \nsupervision  engineer  certify  variation  orders  and  contractors\u2019  monthly  payments  before \nsubmission to the chief supervision engineer. \n \n62. \nRoad Safety. Before project construction and operations, SDEC will carry out road safety \naudits,  the  recommendations  of  which  will  be  implemented  before  project  construction  and \noperations.  For  the  project  expressway,  SPCD  and  SDEC  will  implement  the  road  safety \nsignage, communications, hazard barriers, traffic monitoring, and vehicle weighing in accordance \nwith MOC regulations and standards of other concerned government authorities. The SDEC will \ncooperate closely with the Sichuan Public Security Bureau to implement road safety measures. \nBefore  the  project  expressway  opens,  SPCD  will  submit  a  report  on  the  emergency  response \nplan to ADB for review. \n \nCorporate  Governance.  SPCD  and  SDEC  will  enter  into  a  concession  framework \n63. \nagreement  by  31  December  2008  to  ensure  autonomy  of  operations,  encourage  the \nestablishment  of  road  performance  indicators,  and  facilitate  refinancing  of  road  sector  assets. \nThe  SDEC  will  prepare  a  corporate  development  plan  by  31  December  2009  to  assure  high \nstandards of corporate governance, management practices, and financial reporting. \n \n64. \nPrivate Sector Development. Six months before the project facilities open, SPG through \nSDEC  will  analyze  the  feasibility  of  attracting  private  sector  investment  funds  for  future  road \nsector  investment,  including  possible  private  sector  participation  in  O&M  of  the  project \nexpressway, and report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n65. \nTolls.  The  tolls  for  the  project  expressway  will  be  set  by  SPG.  In  determining  the  toll \nlevel,  SPG  will  take  into  consideration  the  levels  sufficient  to  satisfy  SDEC\u2019s  minimum  debt \nservice  coverage  ratio  of  1.2.  Six  months  before  the  expressway  opens,  SPCD  through  SDEC \nwill  seek  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  on  the  proposed  toll  structure  and  levels  before  seeking  SPG \napproval.  For  the  first  5  years  of  operation,  SPCD  through  SDEC  will  annually  review  the  toll \nstructure  and  levels,  and  submit  a  report  to  ADB.  SPCD  through  SDEC  will  seek  ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence on toll level adjustment before seeking SPG approval. \n \n66. \nFinancial Ratios. To ensure financial sustainability, SDEC will maintain (i) a debt\u2013equity \nratio  of  not  more  than  65:35;  (ii) a  working  ratio  (annual  O&M  cost,  but  excluding  periodic \nmaintenance cost, to revenue) of not more than 15% from the first year of operation; and (iii) a \ndebt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.2 from the fifth year of full operation. \n \nCapacity  Building.  The  SDEC,  in  consultation  with  SPCD,  will  prepare  a  human \n67. \nresource  development  plan.  Before  undertaking  international  training,  SDEC  will  prepare  for \nADB\u2019s  concurrence  a  training  plan,  a  program  of  workshops  to  be  delivered  at  SDEC  by  the \npeople  trained  internationally,  and  a  list  of  training  equipment  and  aids  to  strengthen  SDEC\u2019s \ndomestic training programs. \n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nEnvironment.  SPCD  and  SDEC  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  designed,  constructed, \n68. \nand  operated  in  accordance  with  government  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  environment \n(2002). SPCD and SDEC will implement the EMP to mitigate any adverse environmental impacts \narising from the Project, and submit a semiannual report to ADB; mitigation measures specified \nin  the  EMP  will  be  incorporated  into  the  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts.  SPCD \nthrough  the  local  government  will  assess  the  environmental  impact  on  the  local  roads  in \naccordance  with  the  Government  regulations  and  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures. \n \n69. \nVehicle Emissions. SPG will (i) at least 6 months before the opening of the expressway, \nprovide  to  ADB  the  national  emission  standards  and  the  penalties  for  infringement  of  such \nstandards,  and  (ii) ensure  that  Sichuan  Environmental  Protection  Bureau,  Sichuan  Public \nSecurity Bureau, and other agencies enforce the national vehicle emission standards, and fulfill \nthe requirements of the government strategies. \n \n70. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  SPG  and  SPCD  will  ensure  through  SDEC  that \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  are  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently  following  the \nresettlement  plans  agreed  on  with  ADB,  in  line  with  relevant  laws  and  regulations  of  PRC  and \nADB's  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement.  SPG  and  SPCD  will  ensure  through  SDEC  that \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  is  monitored  and  evaluated  and  reported  to  ADB  as \nrequired in the plan. \n \n71. \nPoverty  Reduction.  SPG  will  implement  the  SDAP  in  a  timely  manner.  The  SDEC  will \ncause  the  contractors  to  maximize  the  employment  of  local  poor  people  who  meet  the  job  and \nefficiency requirements for construction of the project roads. Such workers will be trained on the \njob. SPG will extend the coverage and quality of public utilities, basic health, and basic education \nin  the  project  area  to  enhance  the  Project\u2019s  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  Poverty  Alleviation \nOffice,  in  consultation  with  SDEC,  will  monitor  the  impacts  on  poverty  with  the  assistance  of  a \ndesignated local institute acceptable to ADB based on a set of indicators as outlined in the SDAP, \nand will submit annual monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n72. \nLabor  Standards.  SPCD  and  SDEC  will  ensure  that  all  the  employment  and  labor \nstandards as provided in the applicable laws and regulations of the PRC be complied with, and in \nparticular, that all civil works contractors engaged under the Project (i) provide timely payment of \nwages on, at least, monthly basis and safe working conditions to all workers, including male and \nfemale  workers  (with  such  requirements  being  included  in  the  civil  works  contracts  and \nmonitored  by  construction  supervision  consultants);  (ii)  provide  employment  opportunities  to \nwomen,  where  appropriate,  and  pay  equal  wages  to  the  male  and  female  employees  for \nequivalent work; and (iii) not employ child labor in the project works. \n \nGender and Development. SPG, through SPCD, and SDEC will ensure implementation \n73. \nof the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998). SPCD will \nensure  the  effective  implementation  of  measures  aimed  at  increasing  project  benefits  and \nimpacts on women in the project areas, which are included in the SDAP. \n \n74. \nHealth  Risks.  SPG,  through  the  Department  of  Health  and  SDEC,  together  with  the \nappropriate  authorities,  will  ensure  that  contractors  disseminate  information  on  the  risks  of \nHIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections to those employed during project implementation. \nSPG,  through  the  Department  of  Health  and  SPCD,  will  also  ensure  that  similar  information  is \ndisseminated  to  transport  operators  and  local  communities,  and  other  high-risk  groups  living  in \nthe project area during project operation, at roadside stations, and other suitable facilities. SPG, \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nthrough  SPCD,  will  cause  contractors  to  monitor  health  risk  control  according  to  the \nImplementation Methods of Epidemic Prevention Law of the PRC (1991). \n \n75. \nAxle  Loads.  SPCD,  through  SDEC,  will  install  vehicle  axle-weighing  equipment  at \nselected  entry  points  and  make  suitable  arrangements  for  the  operation  of  such  equipment. \nBefore opening the project expressway, SDEC will submit to ADB the plan for operation of the \nvehicle weigh stations, including the prescribed axle-load limits and penalties for infringement. \n \nChange  in Ownership.

Of  this,  1.59 million km  were  classified. \nRoads  of  class  II  and  above  accounted  for  325,800 km,  or  16.9%,  of  the  total  length.  Road \ndensity  increased  from  12.1 km  per  100  square km  (km2)  in  1995  to  20.0 km  per  100 km2  in \n2005.  With  a  total  length  of  117,000  km,  Sichuan\u2019s  road  network  accounted  for  6.1%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s total roads. Of this, 1,759 km was expressways (1.5%); 14,000 km was of class II or \nhigher classes (12.0%). Road density was 23.9 km per 100 km2 in Sichuan, slightly higher than \nthe national average, but the proportion of roads above class II was significantly lower. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nIn  2005,  the  PRC  vehicle  fleet  consisted  of  43.3 million  trucks,  cars,  buses,  and  other \nmotorized  vehicles  (motorcycles  and  agricultural  vehicles).  The  amount  of  privately  owned \nmotor vehicles increased more than 79 times during 1985\u20132005, from 0.3 million to 23.7 million. \nDespite  the  rapid  increase  in  total  vehicles,  vehicle  ownership  was  only  3.3  vehicles  per  100 \npeople in 2005, which was lower than in many other Asian countries. The PRC\u2019s accession to \nthe World Trade Organization has increased investment in the automobile industry, reduced the \ntariffs on imported vehicles, and contributed to making motor vehicle financing more accessible. \nThese  factors,  along  with  rapidly  growing  urban  incomes,  underpin  the  growth  in  road  traffic. \nThe  modernization  of  the  vehicle  fleet  will  improve  vehicle  safety  and  reduce  vehicles\u2019  fuel \nconsumption and emissions. In 2004, 833,000 passenger vehicles and 407,000 freight vehicles \nwere  registered  in  Sichuan.  Road  passenger  traffic  in  the  province  grew  by  more  than  37.4% \nbetween 2000 and 2005, reaching 55.2 billion passenger-km; road freight traffic grew by 24.0% \nduring the same period, reaching 28.6 billion ton-km in 2005. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (SPCD)  is  responsible  for \nregulating  the  road  transport  industry  by  licensing  intercity  bus  services.  Freight  transport  is \nessentially deregulated; however, interprovincial bus routes require Ministry of Communications\u2019 \napproval.  Because  of  trucking  reforms,  private  operations have  increased,  improving  transport \nefficiency  and  quality  of  services  and  increasing  competition.  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  is  supporting  this  process  through  a  technical  assistance,1 which  aims  to  help  improve \nthe performance of the road transport industry by formulating policy reforms in road freight and \npassenger  services.  Road  administration  is  decentralized.  Road  transport  tariffs  are  allowed \nwithin  a  range  of  plus  or  minus  20%  of  advisory  tariffs  set  by  the  local  government.  This \nflexibility, coupled with ease of market entry, will facilitate the passing on to transport users of \ncost reductions resulting from improved road conditions. \n \nD. \n\nRoad Sector Revenue and Expenditures \n\nRoad Administration \n\n4. \nExpenditures in highway infrastructure are financed from (i) dedicated user charges and \ngovernment grants, (ii) domestic bank loans and bonds, and (iii) foreign loans and investments. \nTwo  dedicated  user  charges,  the  road  maintenance  fee  and  the  vehicle  purchase  fee,  have \nprovided a majority of the financing for the road sector. During the 9th Five-Year Plan of 1996\u2013\n2000,  the  road  maintenance  fee  provided  53%  of  total  road  investments,  while  the  vehicle \npurchase  fee  provided  13%.  Government  grants  provided  2%,  mainly  to  construct  or  improve \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Policy Reform in Road Transport. Manila. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nRoad Engineering, Construction, and Maintenance \n\nrural  roads  in  poor  areas.  The  rest  was  financed  from  domestic  loans  and  bonds  (9%);  other \ndomestic investments, including financing from local governments and state-owned enterprises \n(12%); foreign loans (8%); and foreign direct investment (3%). During the 10th Five-Year Plan of \n2001\u20132005,  central  government  investment  accounted  for  14%,  investment  other  than  central \ngovernment input (e.g., provincial and local governments\u2019 grants and private sector investment) \naccounted for 42%, and domestic loans and foreign funds accounted for the remaining 44%. \n \n5. \nAs part of a tax reform to bring off-budget revenue and expenditures within the national \nbudget, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the Highway Law on 31 October 1999, laying \nthe foundation for legislation replacing provincial and local fees with national taxes. The vehicle \npurchase fee was replaced by the vehicle purchase tax effective January 2001, and a fuel tax is \nbeing considered to replace the road maintenance fee. Based on findings of an ADB-financed \ntechnical assistance,2 the fuel tax is likely to improve financing of the road sector.  \n \n6. \nSPCD  invested  about  CNY16.2  billion  in  the  road  sector  in  2004:  CNY12.9  billion  for \nconstruction and CNY1.4 billion for maintenance. During the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005), \ntotal investment is expected to be about CNY71 billion, with an annual average growth rate of \n5.0%  during  this  period.  SPCD  plans  to  increase  road  investment  to  CNY78  billion  during  the \n11th Five-Year Plan. \n \nE. \n \n7. \nRoad  projects  are  designed  by  planning  and  design  institutes  at  the  provincial, \nprefecture,  and  county  levels.  The  design  institutes  are  staffed  with  experienced,  qualified \npersonnel. The Ministry of Communications reviews the designs of expressways, high-standard \nroads,  and  associated  structures.  The  city  and  county  highway  bureaus  have  their  own \nconstruction units to carry out minor projects within their administrative districts. Drawing on the \nexperience gained under ADB- and World Bank-financed projects, competitive bidding practices \nwere  mandated  by  the  1999  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law.3 Many  of  the  largest  provincial  and \nurban construction units are being reorganized into financially independent companies and have \nbeen awarded contracts individually or as partners in joint ventures on several ADB- and World \nBank-financed  in-country  or  overseas  projects.  Road  maintenance  is  well  organized  by  the \nexpressway companies and the highway administration bureaus. Maintenance mainly involves \nlabor-intensive  techniques  but  is  becoming  increasingly  mechanized.  Although  maintenance \nexpenditures  have  increased  significantly  in  absolute  terms  in  the  past  decade,  maintenance \nexpenditures have not increased as a percentage of total road expenditures.  \n \nF. \n \n8. \nADB  has  been  undertaking  policy  dialogue  on  the  PRC  road  sector  since  1991.  The \nprincipal  issues  include  (i)  the  poverty  impact  of  road  projects,  (ii)  highway  design  standards, \n(iii) construction  quality,  (iv)  road  safety,  (v)  vehicle  emissions,  (vi)  pricing  policies, \n(vii) commercialization  and  corporatization,  and  (viii)  nongovernment  financial  resources.

\n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n31\n\nRURAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT AND LOCAL ROAD COMPONENT \n\n \n1. \nSince 2003, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China has been investing about \nCNY20 billion in rural road development annually. About 50,000 kilometers (km) of rural roads \nhave  been  built  each  year  and  about  150,000  km  of  rural  roads  upgraded.  The  State  Council \napproved the Rural Road Development Plan in February 2005. The objective of the plan is that, \nby 2010, all the townships in the country and all the villages in eastern and central regions will \nbe  connected  by  paved  roads.  With  the  tight  budget,  however,  the  central  Government  and \nmany  provincial  and  local  governments  are  short  of  funds  to  implement  the  plan;  thus  the \ncentral Government supports Asian Development Bank (ADB) initiatives to integrate local roads \nin  expressway  construction  projects.  The  newly  enacted  Rural  Road  Construction  and \nManagement  Regulations  were  made  effective  on  1  March  2006.  These  regulations  highlight \nthe Government\u2019s commitment to building rural roads. \n \n2.  \nIn January 2003, the Sichuan Provincial Rural Road Development Plan 2001\u20132020 was \napproved as a guideline for rural road development in the province. By the end of 2005, Sichuan \nProvincial Communications Department (SPCD) had built 2,059 km of local roads connecting 50 \ntownships  that  had  no  road  access  before,  and  25,908  km  of  rural  roads  connecting  5,261 \nvillages in the province\u2019s rural areas. SPCD plans to expand township road networks to 8,500 \nkm  and  expand  village  road  networks  to  32,000  km  by  2010.  In  the  project  area,  the  city \ngovernment of Dazhou invested CNY50 million in local and rural road development in 2004 and \nCNY20 million in 2005. Following the Ministry of Communication\u2019s new rural road development \nplan, the city government\u2019s plan is to ensure that paved roads connect each township or village \nin Dazhou prefecture with either a county or district center or a nearby trunk highway. \n \n3 \nThe project area is among the poorest in Sichuan, with more than 6.5% of the population \nliving under the poverty line of an annual per capita income less than CNY900. The social and \npoverty analysis conducted under the project preparatory technical assistance showed that the \nrural  poor  are  concentrated  in  remote,  mountainous  areas  with  relatively  high  transportation \ncosts.  Better  road  access  is  necessary  to  reduce  transportation  costs  and  improve  market \naccess for agricultural produce, thereby stimulating trade and investment. In selecting proposed \nlocal  roads,  priority  has  been  given  to  improving  access  to  poor  townships  and  villages  by \nproviding  them  with  all-weather  roads  linked  to  major  economic  centers  and/or  national  and \nprovincial highway networks. \n \n4.  \nThe Project will upgrade 40 local roads with a total length of 430 km. Of those, 30 roads \n(Table A5.1) with a total length of 402 km were identified by SPCD from the local government\u2019s \nrural road development plan, which aims to build or upgrade 1,940 km of local roads in Dazhou \nprefecture.  Of  the  30  selected  roads,  18  roads  will  be  upgraded  to  class  III  and  12  will  be \nupgraded  to  class  IV.  All  of  the  roads  will  be  paved.  The  total  cost  is  projected  to  be \nCNY210.5 million.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  include  10  link  roads  connecting  the  proposed \nexpressway with the cities of Xuanhan and Wanyuan. The total length of these 10 roads will be \n27.6 km, with an estimated total cost of CNY98.2 million (Table A5.2), to be partially financed by \nthe  ADB  loan.  The  selection  of  these  local  roads  was  based  on  population  density,  poverty \nincidence, and road network efficiency. During the selection process, township and village roads \nwere  ranked  separately,  with  the  top  two-thirds  in  each  category  proposed  for  the  Project.  A \nroad  survey  following  the  initial selection  confirmed  that  targeting  the  local  roads proposed  by \nSPCD  will  directly  reduce  poverty  in  the  project  area.  All  the  local  roads  will  be  implemented \nconcurrently with the project expressway. \n \n\n \n\n\fTable A5.1.

There \nare  also  5,544  km  of  village  roads  in  addition  to  the  formal  road  network.  There  are  72 \ntownships that are accessible only by unpaved roads and 29 villages that are not accessible by \nroad  at  all.  Much  of  the  network  is  underdeveloped,  structurally  weak,  poorly  maintained,  and \nlargely  deteriorated.  Most  villages  rely  on  rough  earth  tracks  that  are  unsuitable  for  motorized \ntraffic  and  practically  impassable  during  the  rainy  season.  Vehicle  operating  costs  tend  to  be \nhigh  for  vehicles  that  use  these  roads.  The  lack  of  roads  has  led  to  a  situation  where  an \nestimated  10\u201320%  of  agricultural  produce  goes  to  waste  because  it  can't  be  transported \nexpediently to markets and/or processing centers. Current road-maintenance obstacles include \n(i)  weak  rural  road  maintenance  planning;  (ii)  insufficient  funds;  (iii)  insufficient  equipment;  (iv) \nlack of skilled staff; and (v) lack of access to suitable software and database technology. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  Dazhou  Municipal  Communications  Bureau  is  in  charge  of  maintenance  and \nmanagement  of  all  roads  in  the  prefecture.  The  Project\u2019s  rural  road  component\u2014targeting \naround  402  km  of  class  III\u2013IV  roads  in  30  townships  and  villages\u2014will  improve  this  situation. \nThe Project also includes 28 km of connecting roads linking the expressway interchanges with \nthe surrounding network. Selection criteria were based on population density, poverty incidence, \nand  road  network  efficiency.  A  road  maintenance  framework  for  Dazhou  prefecture  was \nprepared;  the  local  roads  targeted  by  the  Project  will  be  maintained  as  part  of  this  framework \n(Figure A6). \n\nStrengthening Rural Roads Maintenance of the Project Area   \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nFigure A6: Road Maintenance Framework in the Project Area \n\nDazhou Municipal Communications Bureau \n\nDazhou Municipal Highway Administration Bureau \n\n      - 4,100 employees \n      - CNY70 million maintenance expenditures per annum  \n        (excluding central Government subsidy) \n\n-  8,013 km roads (class I-IV and unclassified roads) \n-  5,544 km village roads  \n\nOther Departments \n\nLocal Communication Bureaus - County, City, and District\n\n- 260 km national highway (annual maintenance costs = CNY28,000 per km) \n- 570 km provincial roads (annual maintenance costs = CNY28,000 per km) \n- 2,657 km county roads (annual maintenance costs = CNY7,000 per km + CNY7,000 per km new \n  Government subsidy as of 2006) \n- 4,276 km township roads (annual maintenance costs = CNY6,000 per km+ CNY4,000 per km new  \n  Government subsidy as of 2006) \n- 5,544 km village roads (annual maintenance costs = CNY4,500 per km+ CNY1,000 per km new \n  Government subsidy as of 2006) \n- 250 km special roads  \n\nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Sichuan Provincial Communications Department and Asian Development Bank. \n\nRural Roads Maintenance Plan \n\n \nD. \n \n79. \nDazhou Municipal Communications Bureau strengthen the sustainability of rural roads. \n\nDuring project preparation, an action plan (Table A6.2) was prepared to help SPCD and  \n\n \nTable A6.2: Rural Roads Maintenance and Operation Action Plan of the Project Area \n \n\nActivities \nEngineering \nMeasures \n\nRequirements \n\u2022  Vertical profile of the road designed so that the required minimum \n\nstopping sight distance is available \n\n\u2022  Scientifically  designed  horizontal  curves;  paved  roads  should  be \n\n \n\nwidened at curves \n\n\u2022  Passing places  at convenient locations, particularly on hill roads \n\u2022  Strictly  enforced  low  speed  limits  where  the  roads  pass  through \n\ninhabited areas and schools \n\n\u2022  Scientifically  designed  rural  road\u2013main  road  junctions;  these  are \n\nalways potential points of conflict \n\n\u2022  Ramps in place where field paths and animal crossings intersect \n\nthe road \n\n\fActivities \n \n\nRequirements \n\u2022  Warning  and  regulatory  signage  erected  to  enhance  road  safety \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n35\n\nMaintenance \nMeasures \n\nprovide clear guidance \n\n\u2022  Hazard  markers  such  as  reflectorized  delineators  erected  at \n\nand efficiency \n\ndangerous locations \n\n\u2022  Rural roads built according to high safety design standards \n\u2022  A functional classification of rural roads must be developed as a \n\nbasis for establishing a road condition system and costs. \n\n \n\u2022  Advance  warning  of  road  users  clearly  and  sufficiently,  and \n\n\u2022  Safe and clearly marked buffer zones and work zones \n\u2022  Careful, safe use of construction machinery \n\u2022  Minimal obstruction to road users \n\u2022  Provision of temporary detours as necessary \n\u2022  Avoid conflict of parking machine and traffic \n \n\u2022  An  effective  maintenance  management  system,  periodic  road \n\ncondition surveys and accurate traffic counts \n\n\u2022  Determine bill of qualities and prepare cost estimates. \n\u2022  A maintenance strategy with defined priorities \n\u2022  Routine  maintenance  of  rural  roads  carried  out  regularly  and \n\nproperly addressing all road-safety issues  \n\u2022  Preventive maintenance and safety measures \n\u2022  Strong  contract administration and quality assurance \n\u2022  An effective monitoring and evaluation system \n\u2022  Road  safety  and  maintenance  awareness  campaigns,  relevant \n\nagencies, and community groups \n\n\u2022  An equipment maintenance and utilization scheme \n \n\u2022  An ongoing training program to enhance staff skills \n\u2022  Overseas training (a component of the Project) to strengthen staff \n\ncapacity and encourage adoption of best practices \n\n\u2022  Provision of short-term international consultants to enhance local \nleader  should  develop  a  sustainable \n\ncapacity; \nmaintenance system, including a budget plan \n\nteam \n\nthe \n\n \n\u2022  An  ongoing  maintenance  budget  to  ensure  steady  operation  of \n\nroad networks after project launch \n\nOperation \nMeasures \n\nCapacity Building \n\nFunding \n\n\u2022  Sufficient and continuous funds for road maintenance \n\u2022  Proper use of the Government\u2019s subsidy program \n\u2022  Effective monitoring and auditing \nSources: Sichuan Provincial Communications Department and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nItem   \n\nA.\n\nBase Cost c\n1.

Lower transport costs reduce the costs of traded farm inputs, thereby raising agricultural \nproductivity  and  profitability.  Better  roads  improve  farmers'  access  to  markets  and  technology \ninputs, leading them to shift to higher-value crops. Road improvements tend to increase off-farm \njob  opportunities,  drive  up  average  wages,  and  stimulate  commercial  activities  by  reducing \ntransaction  times  and  costs.  In  turn,  higher  incomes  boost  local  people\u2019s  demand  for  transport \nand increase the movement of local goods and services. Even rural poor people who rarely use \nroads  will  benefit  from  improved  roads,  as  goods  and  services  will  become  cheaper  and \neconomic opportunities will increase. \n \nThe  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (SPCD)  concurred  with  the \n2. \nproposed set of monitoring indicators for the project performance monitoring system (PPMS) of \nthe  Project  (Table  A10.1).  Table  A10.2  contains  a  list  of  key  indicators  that  will  comprise  the \ncore  data  required  for  impact  assessment.  SPCD  will  refine  the  baseline  values  for  indicators \nprior to project implementation and update them during project implementation. Where relevant, \nindicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  SPCD  will  measure  the  indicators  and  report  the \nfindings  to  ADB  on  project  inception,  completion,  and  annually  for  3  years  after  completion. \nSPCD,  together  with  the  external  monitoring  agency,  will  also  select  the  monitoring  villages \naccording  to  actual  needs.  The  resource  requirements  for  the  PPMS  tasks  will  include:  1 \nperson-month  of  international  expertise  to  design  and  set  up  the  PPMS  and  train  national \nconsultants  on  monitoring  methodology;  and  8  person-months  of  national  expertise  to  mange \nthe  database  and  carry  out  village-level  surveys,  analysis,  and  reporting  (for  which  SPCD  will \nrecruit  an \nthe  Project\u2019s \nsocioeconomic  impact,  the  terms  of  reference  to  monitor  and  evaluate  project  impacts  are \nincluded among the consulting services to be provided under the Project.

The  total  length  is  143  kilometers  (km).  It  is  an \nimportant section of the Xi\u2019an\u2013Chongqing expressway, which is part of the Arongqi\u2013Beihai line, \none  of  the  eight  Western  Development  Corridors  approved  by  the  People's  Republic  of  China \nGovernment  in  2001.  For  the  construction  schedule  of  the  Xi\u2019an\u2013Chongqing  corridor,  the \nDazhou\u2013Chongqing expressway has been already completed and opened to traffic; the Xi\u2019an\u2013\nAnkang  expressway  is  under  construction  and  will  be  open  to  traffic  before  this  Project;  the \nsection from Ankang to the Shaanxi\u2013Sichuan border is expected to be completed about the time \nthis Project is completed, which means the entire corridor will be open to traffic when the project \nexpressway is completed. \n \n2.  \nCurrently National Highway 210 connects Dazhou and the Sichuan\u2013Shaanxi border; its \ntotal length is 142 km, of which 121 km, or about 85%, is a class 4 road. The subgrade width \nranges  from  6.5  meters  (m)  to  7  m  and  the  radius  of  horizontal  curve  is  generally  15\u201320  m. \nBecause of the difficult geographic characteristics and poor road conditions, the average annual \ndaily  traffic  on  National  Highway  210  was  1,467  vehicles  per  day  in  2004.  However,  after  the \nproject expressway is completed, it is expected that traffic will increase rapidly on this route. As \na reference, traffic at the Dazhou toll collection station on the Dazhou\u2013Chongqing expressway \ngrew  by  17.7%  per  year  from  2001  to  2004.  Traffic  on  the  Wuhan\u2013Yichang  expressway  in \nneighboring  Hubei  Province  grew  at  15%  after  the  transport  corridor  was  completed.  These \ncases  point  to  potentially  rapid  traffic  growth  on  the  proposed  expressway.  That  growth  could \naccelerate  as  a  result  of  Dazhou  city\u2019s  road  development  plan:  from  2006  to  2015,  the  city  is \nplanning  to  build  230  km  of  expressways,  440  km  of  class  2  highways,  480  km  of  class  3 \nhighways, and 600 km of class 4 highways in the project area and neighboring counties.  \n \n3.  \nOrigin-to-destination  data  was  derived  from  a  24-hour  survey  conducted  at  seven \nlocations along National Highway 210 in September 2001. Forty-two origin-to-destination zones \ncover most areas of northeastern Sichuan, southern Shaanxi, and northeastern Chongqing. The \nsurvey  showed  that  traffic  on  National  Highway  210  consisted  of  25%  small  trucks,  25% \nmedium  trucks,  15%  large  trucks,  26%  small  cars,  7%  large  cars,  and  3%  trailers.  Coal \naccounted for 31% of the total freight volume, followed by construction materials (12%), cement \n(7%)  and  other  products  (31%).  Based  on  the  origin-to-destination  matrix  derived  in  the \nfeasibility  study,  the  forecast  model  was  refined  and  a  traffic  forecast  was  developed  for  both \npassenger  and  freight  vehicles  in  2012,  2022,  and  2031.  This  forecast  was  based  on  the \nprojected  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  estimated  elasticities  of  traffic  demand  with \nrespect to GDP growth. GDP growth rates were projected to be 12.3% for 2004\u20132012, 10.3% \nfor  2012\u20132021,  and  7.8%  for  2021\u20132031.  Relevant  socioeconomic  data,  such  as  projected \nindustrial restructuring and travel behavior changes resulting from increased incomes, were also \nincorporated into the forecasts. \n \n4.  \nTraffic on the proposed project expressway comprises diverted traffic from existing roads \nand generated traffic because the willingness to pay is greater than the travel cost. Passengers \nand  freight  moving  from  one  zone  to  another  choose  their  route  based  on  the  route\u2019s \ngeneralized travel cost, which was defined as a function of travel distance, travel time, vehicle \noperating  costs,  toll  costs,  and  other  perceived  costs.  Through  the  traffic  forecast  period,  the \nvehicle fleet composition is also expected to change, with the share of private cars increasing \nsteadily. The results of the traffic forecast are shown in Table A11. The forecast traffic volume \non the expressway is expected to grow from an average of 7,800 passenger car units per day in \n2012, to 19,000 passenger car units per day in 2022, and to 42,400 units per day in 2032. The \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n43\n\ntraffic  on  the  proposed  local  roads  will  grow  more  slowly  because  of  projected  slow  growth  in \nthe project area.  \n \n\nTable A11: Average Annual Daily Traffic on Project Expressway \n(passenger car units) \n \n\nRoad Sections \n\n2012 \n\n2022 \n\n2032 \n\nXujiaba\u2013Xuanhan \nXuanhan\u2013Puguang \nPuguang\u2013Huangjin \nHuangjin\u2013Xinghua \nXinghua\u2013Tiekuang \nTiekuang\u2013Baisha \nBaisha\u2013Wanyuan \nWanyuan\u2013Guandu \nGuandu\u2013Border \nWeighted Average \nSources: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n\n26,472  \n23,279  \n20,038  \n17,340  \n16,998  \n16,636  \n16,613  \n17,769  \n8,624  \n18,993  \n\n56,101  \n53,121  \n46,575  \n37,437  \n36,023  \n35,916  \n38,970  \n44,440  \n19,680  \n42,364  \n\n9,323  \n9,140  \n8,701  \n7,677  \n7,449  \n7,426  \n7,447  \n7,105  \n3,480  \n7,769  \n\nAnnual \nGrowth Rate \n(%) \n11.0 \n9.8 \n8.7 \n8.5 \n8.6 \n8.4 \n8.4 \n9.6 \n9.5 \n9.4 \n\nAnnual \nGrowth Rate \n(%) \n7.8 \n8.6 \n8.8 \n8.0 \n7.8 \n8.0 \n8.9 \n9.6 \n8.6 \n8.4 \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n \n1.  \nThe  proposed  Project  comprises  a  143-kilometer  (km)  access-controlled  expressway \nbetween  Dazhou  and  the  Sichuan\u2013Shaanxi  border,  and  430  km  of  local  roads.  The  economic \nanalysis covers 5 years of the project implementation from 2008 to 2012 and the subsequent 20 \nyears  of  full  operation  from  2013  to  2032.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the \nproject  expressway  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  situation  with  and  without  the  Project. \nWithout the Project, traffic will use the existing road network, principally National Highway 210, \nwhich  will  be  congested  and  expensive  to  maintain  because  of  the  rapidly  increased  traffic \nvolume. Some travel may not take place because of the congestion and the resulting increased \ntravel  times  and  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOC).  With  the  Project,  congestion  on  the  existing \nroads will be reduced, and traffic on the proposed expressway and the existing roads will benefit \nfrom  faster,  cheaper,  and  safer  travel.  Additional  trips  will  be  generated  as  the  economy \nresponds to lower transport costs and better services.  \n \n2.  \nAnalysis  of  Alternatives. Eight alternative alignments of the project expressway were \nreviewed  based  on  geologic  and  topographic  conditions,  construction  and  maintenance  costs, \nand  the  potential  for  integration  with  national  and  local  transport  networks.  The  expressway \ntechnical design was proposed after consideration of consistency in the standards of contiguous \nsections at each end of the project expressway with the national highway network and forecast \ntraffic.  The  final  plan  was  selected  by  systematically  considering  all  the  relevant  technical, \nfinancial,  environmental,  and  socioeconomic  factors.  Various  financing  modality  alternatives \nwere  also  considered,  including  private  sector  investment.  Because  of  risks  associated  with \nconstruction, uncertainties in the long-term forecast horizon, and an expected low financial rate \nof return, public financing was considered the best option for the Project. \n \n3.  \nGeneral Parameters. Economic evaluation was undertaken using constant 2007 prices. \nThe  project  costs  and  benefits  were  converted  to  the  economic  price  by  separating  the  cost \nitems  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment  and  non-tradable  materials,  labor,  and  land.  The \nprices  were  expressed  in  local  currency  (CNY)  using  the  domestic  numeraire  with  a  shadow \nexchange rate factor of 1.013 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow price factor of 0.67 was \nused to estimate the opportunity cost of unskilled labor. \n \n4.  \nCosts. Economic costs of the expressway include (i) the capital cost, including physical \ncontingencies, land acquisition and resettlement costs, and environmental mitigation costs; and \n(ii) costs of operating and maintaining the expressway, including costs of replacing depreciated \nequipment, routine maintenance costs, and the cost of a major maintenance operation expected \nto be needed 10 years after the expressway becomes fully operational. The land acquisition and \nresettlement  costs  were  based  on  their  opportunity  costs\u2014i.e.,  the  value  of  agricultural  output \nforgone and the costs of resiting displaced activities.  \n \n5.  \nBenefits.  The  economic  benefits  include  (i)  savings  in  VOC  resulting  from  reduced \ntravel distances and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the value of passenger and freight \ntravel time, (iii) savings resulting from lower accident and fatality rates, (iv) benefits to generated \ntraffic,  and  (v)  savings  in  capital  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  for  the  existing \nNational  Highway  210  and  other  alternative  routes.  A  reduction  in  VOC  is  the  main  source  of \neconomic  benefits  for  the  project  expressway.  Traffic  diverted  to  the  expressway  would  travel \nshorter  distances  at  higher,  more  economical  speeds  on  a  smoother  road,  with  better  vertical \nand  horizontal  alignment  and  less  congestion.  Traffic  remaining  on  the  National  Highway  210 \nroute  would  also  benefit  from  a  reduction  in  traffic  volume  and  congestion.  All  these  changes \naffect vehicles speeds and VOC\u2014both of which were projected for all vehicle types likely to use \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n45\n\nthe  corridor.  Savings  in  travel  time  will  be  observed  both  on  the  project  expressway  and  on \nexisting roads. Work-related travel time was evaluated for private vehicles and buses; inventory \ncost savings were projected for freight traffic. The economic cost of accidents was projected in \nterms of direct property damage and forgone income. \n \n6.  \nLocal  Roads.  About  430  km  of  local  roads  will  be  improved  concurrently  with  the \nexpressway component. The costs of this component include capital costs and O&M costs. The \nprinciple benefits of the local road improvements were identified as (i) VOC savings for existing \ntraffic and normal growth of future traffic on the improved roads, (ii) benefits to generate traffic, \nand (iii) savings in O&M costs. Currently farm\u2013gate prices for agricultural produce are low since \nonly traders with tractors or small trucks can visit villages to purchase produce. Improved local \nroads will allow farmers to go directly to markets to sell their produce at higher prices, and thus \nthe benefits to generated traffic will account for a large proportion of the total benefits.  \n \n7.  \nResult  and  Conclusion. The EIRR for the Project, including the expressway and local \nroad  components,  is  14.1%  (Table  A12.1).  VOC  savings  from  the  expressway  are  the  major \neconomic  benefit,  accounting  for  56.9%  of  the  total  benefits,  followed  by  generated  traffic \n(18.7%) and time savings (9.4%). Accident cost savings (accounting for 5.5% of benefits) and \nO&M savings (2.2%) are relatively small. The benefits of the local roads also account for a small \nproportion (7.4%); without local roads, the expected EIRR for the expressway project is 13.5%. \nThe EIRR for the local road component alone is 40.8%.  \n \n8.  \nA sensitivity analysis (Table A12.2) was conducted to test the robustness of the EIRR by \nchanging  the  values  of  the  key  variables\u2014capital  cost,  traffic  volume,  and  implementation \nschedule.  The  capital  cost  would  have  to  be  23.9%  higher  than  projected,  or  traffic  volume \n20.5% lower than projected, for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the \nexperience of the Asian Development Bank in the People\u2019s Republic of China, neither scenario \nis  likely.  A  project  implementation  delay  would  also  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  expected \nEIRR,  which  would  decline  to  12.6%  if  implementation  was  delayed  by  1  year.  In  order  to \ndetermine  the  degree  of  uncertainty  of  the  Project,  a  risk  analysis  was  carried  out.  Each  key \nvariable\u2014i.e.,  capital  cost,  toll  rate,  and  traffic  growth\u2014was  assigned  a  random  value  within \ndefined  limits  based  on  assumed  probability  distribution  functions.  The  Monte  Carlo  analysis \nbased  on  the  statistical  method  was  carried  out  to  generate  the  probability  distribution  of  the \nEIRR. The results show that the probability that the EIRR will fall below 12% is less than 4%; \nthe  EIRR  is  thus  robust  and  the  Project  is  economically  viable.  A  distribution  analysis  was \nconducted  to  gauge  the  project-related  effects  on  various  beneficiaries,  including  road  users, \nlabor, and government.  The results (Table A12.3) show that road users, including passengers \nand freight users, will receive the largest share (85.8%) of the Project's net benefits. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n862.1 \n\n1,465.7 \n2,155.4 \n2,845.1  \n1,293.2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n301.8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nYear \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n2032 \n \n \n\n \n \n \n19.3 \n40.8 \n41.9 \n43.0 \n44.2 \n45.4 \n46.7 \n48.0 \n49.3 \n50.7 \n52.2 \n53.6 \n55.1 \n56.6 \n58.1 \n59.7 \n61.4 \n63.1 \n64.9 \n66.7 \n68.6 \n\nTable A12.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2007 prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million) \n\nBenefits \n\nCapital \nInvestment \n\nLocal \nRoads \n\nTotal \n\nVOC \nSavings\n\nTime \nSavings \n\nAccident \nSavings \n\nGenerated \nTraffic \n\nO&M \nSavings\n\nLocal \nRoads\n\nTotal  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(901.7) \n\nCosts \n\nOperation \nand \nMaintenance  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n901.7 \n\n1,492.5 \n2,187.8 \n2,917.8 \n1,314.0 \n42.3 \n43.4 \n44.5 \n45.7 \n46.9 \n48.2 \n49.5 \n50.9 \n52.2 \n53.7 \n356.9 \n56.6 \n58.1 \n59.6 \n61.3 \n62.9 \n64.6 \n66.4 \n68.3 \n(4,326.9) \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n265.5 \n531.0 \n574.9 \n622.5 \n674.1 \n729.9 \n790.3 \n855.7 \n926.5 \n1,003.2 \n1,086.3 \n1,194.9 \n1,307.9 \n1,431.6 \n1,566.9 \n1,715.1 \n1,916.1 \n2,140.6 \n2,391.4 \n2,671.5 \n2,984.5 \n\n39.5 \n\n26.8 \n32.4 \n72.7 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n(84.2) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n43.0 \n86.0 \n93.3 \n101.3 \n109.9 \n119.3 \n129.4 \n140.5 \n152.4 \n165.4 \n179.5 \n197.9 \n217.1 \n238.2 \n261.3 \n286.7 \n321.0 \n359.5 \n402.5 \n450.8 \n504.8 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n15.8 \n31.6 \n37.1 \n43.6 \n51.1 \n60.0 \n70.4 \n82.6 \n96.9 \n113.8 \n133.5 \n159.1 \n167.3 \n175.8 \n184.8 \n194.3 \n208.4 \n223.6 \n239.9 \n257.3 \n276.1 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n16.0 \n31.9 \n32.4 \n33.2 \n33.9 \n34.8 \n35.8 \n36.7 \n37.8 \n39.0 \n40.2 \n41.5 \n42.8 \n44.1 \n45.3 \n46.5 \n47.8 \n49.0 \n50.2 \n51.5 \n52.7 \n\n \n \n \n107.7 \n215.3 \n230.7 \n245.3 \n259.1 \n272.2 \n284.6 \n296.3 \n307.3 \n330.1 \n357.4 \n384.2 \n406.9 \n428.9 \n450.0 \n480.1 \n510.4 \n541.0 \n571.9 \n603.0 \n634.5 \n\n \n \n \n \n82.5  \n82.5 \n531.1 \n83.1 \n81.9 \n977.9 \n80.8  1,049.3 \n79.6  1,125.4 \n78.4  1,206.5 \n77.2  1,293.3 \n76.0  1,386.5 \n74.8  1,486.6 \n73.6  1,594.7 \n91.2  1,742.7 \n108.8  1,905.7 \n126.5  2,104.1 \n144.1  2,286.1 \n161.7  2,480.2 \n179.3  2,687.7 \n196.9  2,919.7 \n214.6  3,218.3 \n232.2  3,545.9 \n249.8  3,905.7 \n267.4  4,301.6 \n285.1  4,737.6 \nEconomic Net Present Vale =\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return =\n\nNet \nBenefits \n\n(1,492.5) \n(2,187.8) \n(2,835.3) \n(782.9) \n935.6 \n1,005.9 \n1,080.8 \n1,160.7 \n1,246.4 \n1,338.2 \n1,437.1 \n1,543.8 \n1,690.5 \n1,852.1 \n1,747.2 \n2,229.5 \n2,422.1 \n2,628.1 \n2,858.4 \n3,155.4 \n\n3,481.2 \n3,839.3 \n4,233.4 \n9,064.6 \n1,391\n14.1%\n\n4\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n(4,311.3) \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n( ) = negative, O&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and TA consultants estimates. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n47\n\nTable A12.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n \n\nScenarios \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n14.1 \n13.1 \n13.1 \n12.6 \n12.1 \n\nNPV \n(CNY million) \n1,391 \n810 \n714 \n406 \n43 \n\nBase Case \n1. 10% increase in construction cost \n2. 10% decrease in traffic volume \n3. 1-year implementation delay \n4.

Construction  will  be \ncompleted  by  June  2012,  and  the  operation  will  start  after  that.  The  assumed  foreign  inflation \nrate is 1.2% during 2009-2012 and the assumed local inflation rate is 2.8% for 2008, and 3% for \n2009\u20132012 The cost projections are presented in current terms, taking into account the potential \nimpacts of domestic and international inflation. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nOperating  revenues  from  tolls  are  projected  based  on  forecasts  of  future  traffic  and  a \nbase toll rate of CNY0.35 per passenger car per kilometer. Corresponding tolls for other vehicle \ntypes are (i) CNY0.70 for a small bus or light truck, (ii) CNY1.05 for a medium bus or medium \ntruck, (iii) CNY1.4 for a large bus or large truck, (iv) CNY1.75 for a light articulated truck and a \ntrailer.1 It is assumed that the toll charges will increase in current terms to keep up with inflation, \nso there will be no real increase in project toll rates over the project lifespan. Other income (from \nfuel  sales,  rental  income,  etc.)  amounts  to  2.5%  of  toll  revenue.  It  is  assumed  that  10%  of \nvehicles are exempted from tolls.2 \n \n3. \nOperating  costs  have  been  projected  based  on  an  assessment  of  labor  requirements \n(270 permanent employees) and present labor costs in Sichuan. The cost of utilities and office \nspace  is  projected  to  be  about  40%  of  labor  costs.  Annual  routine  maintenance  costs  are \nprojected  to  be  CNY50,000  per  km.  The  environmental  monitoring  cost  is  projected  to  be \nCNY800,000 per annum. Periodic maintenance costs are projected to be CNY1.25 million per \nkilometer, and equipment replacement costs are projected to be 35% of equipment costs. \n \n4. \nOperating  and  maintenance  costs  for  the  tunnels  are  based  on  (i)  installed  kilovolt \namperes  in  the  longer  tunnels,  and  (ii)  operating  hours  per  day  and  staffing  requirements. \nAssumptions  include:  (i)  electricity  costs  of  CNY0.50  per  kilowatt  per  hour;  (ii)  labor  costs  of \nCNY15,000 per annum; and (iii) regular maintenance costs of CNY250,000 per km. \n \n5. \nDepreciation is calculated using a straight-line depreciation method, with the average life \nabout 50 years for the main expressway structure, 20 years for the pavement component, and \n15 years for equipment. Applicable business taxes at a rate of 5.5% are charged on revenue. \nCorporate  income  taxes  of  33%  are  paid  on  income  after  deducting  business  taxes, \ndepreciation  and  interest  charges,  operating  expenses,  and  any  prior-year  losses  carried \nforward.  \n \n6. \nThe  Project  will  be  funded  47%  by  equity  or  grants  and  53%  by  long-term  loans.  The \nChina Development Bank loan will be repayable over 25 years, including a 5-year grace period. \nThe ADB loan is assumed to have a 25-year term, including a 5-year grace period and a 0.35% \n\n                                                 \n1  The toll rates proposed and their structures are consistent both with trends in Sichuan and with tolls on the existing, \nadjacent  stretch  of  expressway.  In  addition  to  expressway  tolls,  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department \nproposes  to  impose  tunnel  tolls.  The  proposed  rate  for  a  car  is  CNY2.5  per  kilometer  of  tunnel  for  every  tunnel \nlonger than 1 kilometer. \n\n2   Under  the  Sichuan  provincial  \u201cgreen  passage\u201d  regulations,  local  vehicles  carrying  fresh  agricultural  produce  or \n\nlivestock are exempt from tolls. \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n49\n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\ncommitment  charge.  It  will  be  denominated  in  US  dollars,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility. \n \n7. \nThe  summary  financial  statement  is  presented  in  Table  A13.1.  The  projected  financial \nstatement  indicates  that  the  forecast  revenue  under  the  base  assumptions  are  sufficient  to \ncover  annual  recurrent  costs,  depreciation,  and  debt  repayments  on  the  ADB  and  China \nDevelopment  Bank  loans.  It  is  projected  that  the  Project  will  generate  reasonable  profits  from \nexpressway operation after the fifth year of full operation. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe major assumptions used for calculation of financial internal rate of return (FIRR) are: \n(i)  all  calculations  are  made  in  2007  prices,  covering  a  period  from  2008  to  2032;  (ii)  capital \ncosts include all incremental capital expenditures related to the construction and equipment for \nthe expressway, but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) operation \nand  maintenance  includes  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the \nexpressway, but excludes depreciation and debt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues \nfrom  tolls  used  in  financial  projections  are  also  adjusted  to  2007  prices;  (v)  the  residual  value \nequal  to  undepreciated  value  of  capital  investment  is  included  as  a  benefit  of  the  FIRR \ncalculation.  \n \n9. \nThe  projected  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  after  taxes  and  in  real  terms, \nwas calculated using estimated capital mix and expected capital cost of funds. Costs have been \nconsidered  as  follows:  (i)  the  applicable  10-year  fixed  swap  rate  plus  a  provision  for  ADB\u2019s \nspread of 0.6% is used for ADB debt; (ii) the estimated interest costs of 6.16% per annum are \nused for the domestic loan funds; and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8%. The cost of \ndebt  is  also  adjusted  to  reflect  the  impact  of  a  33%  income  tax.  The  nominal  cost  of  debt  is \nconverted to the real cost of debt by applying domestic and international average inflation rates \nfor domestic and foreign currency-denominated debt. \n \n10. \nThe  FIRR  for  the  Project,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  4.1%.  This  compares \nfavorably  with  the  WACC,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  3.1%  (Table  A13.2).  The \nProject is considered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity tests indicate conditions \ncausing  the  project's  viability  to  fall  below  WACC  are  unlikely  to  occur.  The  sensitivity  of  the \nProject's financial indicators to cost and revenue variations is shown in Table A13.3. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: \nThe  proposed  Project  involves  constructing  an  expressway  of  143  kilometers  (km)  from  Dazhou  to  the \nSichuan\u2013Shaanxi border at Wanyuan county, and upgrading (from unpaved class III\u2013IV to paved class III\u2013\nIV) 430 km of local roads. The Project will (i) facilitate economic growth by increasing interprovincial trade \namong Sichuan, Shanxi province, and Chongqing; (ii) reduce travel times to the major regional cities from \nrural towns; and (iii) reduce poverty by increasing agricultural commercialization and nonfarm employment.\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nImprove  Road  Conditions  at  Township  Level.  Wanyuan  county  has  the  poorest  roads  in  the  project \narea.  As  of  2004,  29  villages  in  Wanyuan  county  were  accessible  by  unpaved  road  only,  while  38 \ntownships  were  completely  inaccessible  by  road.  In  Xuanhan  county,  33  townships  lacked  paved  road \naccess, as did 1 township in Tongchuan county. The Project will enable 21 townships in Xuanhan county \nand 19 townships in Wanyuan county to have paved road access. The Project will improve the township \nroads from unclassified standard to Class 3 or 4 standard. \n \nFacilitate  Economic  Growth  in  the  Project  Area.  The  project  area's  main  industries  are  coal  mining, \nnatural  gas  extraction,  hydropower,  tourism,  steel,  and  cement.  The  above-mentioned  industries \naccounted  for  44.4%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  Tongchuan,  32.3%  in  Xuanhan,  and  33.9%  in \nWanyuan in 2004. The project area has 21 tourist spots, which attracted 1.35 million people in 2005. It is \nprojected that the Project will contribute an additional 1-2% to the GDP of Xuanhan and Wanyuan counties \nduring  construction;  GDP  in  each  country  is  projected  to  maintain  an  annual  growth  rate  of  13\u201315%  for \nmore than 5 years after the project completion. \n \nImprove Vehicle Transportation Services to the Major Cities. Eighteen interprovincial bus routes (14 to \nChongqing and four to Shanxi) existed in the project area as of 2005, with 70 daily buses servicing these \nroutes. There were also 87 intercounty routes (3 to Chengdu) supporting 509 daily bus services. Most rural \npeople  travel  to  township  centers  for  marketing,  shopping,  and  medical  care.  It  is  expected  that  these \nroutes will provide 20% more trips for passengers after project completion.  \n \nCreate  Employment  Opportunity  under  the  Project.  It  is  projected  that  56,421  person-months  of \nunskilled  work  will  be  required  under  the  Project  (54,411  for  the  expressway  component,  2,010  for  the \nlocal road component); each worker is projected to earn CNY500 per month. Assuming each household in \nthe project area works 4 months per year over a 4-year period, the Project will directly benefit about 6,250 \nhouseholds.  The  annual  income  from  this  employment  will  be  about  CNY2,000  per  household,  which  is \ntwice the average annual income per capita for poor households. The Project aims to provide locals with \n60% of this work. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nRural and urban population, bus passengers, transport operators, local enterprises, and local governments \nare identified as project stakeholders. Positive and negative effects to these groups caused by the Project \nwere analyzed in the social survey.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n3,627 people representing various stakeholders were consulted during the project preparation stage. Local \npeople will have an opportunity to participate in project construction. \n \n \n\n  Yes  \n\n  Yes  \n\n  No  \n\n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n53\n\n \nD.  Gender Development  \nStrategy to enhance impacts on women: \n \nSix  villages  in  Xuanhan  and  Wanyuan  counties  were  selected  and  45  women  participated  in  the  focus-\ngroup  discussions.  In  terms  of  mobility,  women  make  5  to  10  trips  per  month  to  a  township  center  for \nbusiness, shopping, or visiting the hospital. The proportion of female migrant workers in sample population \nis  32%;  many  of  them  work  in  garment  factories  in  coastal  provinces.  In  terms  of  women  and  human \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS),  most  participants  were  aware \nof HIV/AIDS and understood the preventative measures. During the discussion, many women expressed \ntheir needs on health issues such as family planning, health check-ups, and medical insurance. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

The  plans  have  been \ndisclosed to the public and affected people. Internal \nand external monitoring arrangements will be put in \nplace. \n\nin \n\nPoor  people  spend  about  CNY32  per  capita  per \nyear  on  travel,  according  to  the  social  survey. \nCurrent bus fares range from CNY0.25 to CNY0.35 \nper  passenger  per  kilometer.  These  fares  are \nconsidered affordable.  \n\nThe  Executing  Agency  will  ensure  that  all  the \nemployment  and  labor  standards,  as  defined  in  the \napplicable laws and regulations, be complied with. \n\nThere are no ethnic minorities in the project area.  \n\n15  HIV/AIDS  cases  have  been  reported  in  the \nproject  area.  The  cause  of  infection  was  from  drug \nabuse  (11  cases)  and  sexual \ntransmission  (4 \ncases). To prevent the risk of HIV/AIDS associated \nwith the Project, the local centers for disease control \n(CDCs) will extend their preventive measures to the \ncommunities  in  the  project  area.  These  mitigation \nmeasures  will  be  carried  out  in  collaboration  with \nlocal  health  agencies  and  an  anti-AIDS  program \nfunded  by  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for \nInternational Development in the project area. \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n  Full \n\n  Short \n\n  None  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n  No \n\n  Yes \n\n  No  \n\n  Yes \n\n  No  \n\n  Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nSMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE PROJECT AREA \n\n \n1. \nBackground.  The  project  area  is  economically  active  because  of  its  large  population, \ncontinuous development activities, and proximity to Chongqing. Consequently, small businesses \nare  quite  active  in  the  project  area. A  wide  assortment  of  businesses  has  been  established  to \nprovide basic necessities to local communities and travelers. The project preparatory technical \nassistance field survey found that there are about 0.37 establishments with 1.43 employees per \nkilometer  of  the  road,  excluding  the  numerous  establishments  in  township  centers.  These \nestablishments, concentrated in settlement areas, include hostels, car repair shops, carwashes, \ngrocery shops, and restaurants.  \n \n2. \nSmall Business Opportunities in the Project Area. The project area is near the center \nof the third largest gas field in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Xuanhan and Wanyuan are major \ncoal mining counties in Sichuan, while Dazhou city is the second largest steel production base \nin  Sichuan.  The  project  area  also  has  large  thermal-  and  hydropower-generation  and  cement \nindustries.  In  addition,  there  are  about  21  tourist  spots  in  the  project  area.  Unfortunately,  as  a \nresult of the transport bottleneck, these industries, especially the natural gas development and \nnatural  gas-based  chemical  industries,  are  operating  far  below  their  potential.  The  project \nexpressway  and  local  roads  will  support  Dazhou  city\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan,  which  includes  a \ncomponent  to  expand  these  industries  significantly.  As  a  result  of  this  expansion,  nonfarm \nemployment, urban population, passenger traffic volumes, and freight transport volumes will all \nincrease,  creating  further  opportunities  for  small  business  development  along  the  expressway \nand local roads. \n \nSmall businesses could focus on the following areas: (i) agricultural trading and industry \n3. \nin  agricultural  products  such  as  fruits,  processed  fruit  products  (e.g.,  dried  fruit,  jam), \nmushrooms,  local  liquor,  beer,  and  herbs;  (ii)  community-based  tourism  and  ecotourism;  (iii) \ndistribution  (for  the  local  market)  and  transport;  and  (iv)  service-oriented  businesses,  such  as \nrestaurants, catering, gift shops, car repair, and carwashes.  \n \n4. \nPrerequisites  for  Establishing  Businesses.  There  are  various  factors  that  influence \nthe viability of small businesses in the project area, including: (i) entrepreneurship, (ii) access to \ninformation  and  networking,  (iii)  access  to  the  market  and  bargaining  power  against  existing \nbusinesses,  (iv)  access  to  formal  credit  services,  (v)  access  to  basic  business  training \nservices\u2500accounting,  (vi)  support  from  government\u2500tax,  business  licensing,  and  (vii)  local \ninfrastructure\u2500water, road, and electricity.  \n \n5. \nConstraints.  As  for  entrepreneurship,  the  field  survey  found  that  15  out  of  the  98 \nhouseholds  surveyed  expressed  desire  to  establish  small  businesses\u2014including  transport \nbusinesses. This indicates that many people are willing to assume the risks involved in starting \na business. \n \n6. \nMany  people  in  the  project  area  have  a  good  grasp  of  market  prices  from  both  buying \nand selling goods at their local market. However, they know little about larger markets because \nof their limited mobility, which is partly caused by poor current road conditions.  \n \n7. \nPeople  are  allowed  to  sell  their  produce  in  their  nearest  market  during  the  market  day \nonly for their petty trading (selling agricultural produce) with minimum tenant fee. The physical \ncondition of markets at the township level is often poor without any permanent facilities. Under \nthese  conditions,  bad  weather  often  disrupts  market  activities,  especially  during  the  raining \nseason. Bad weather also exacerbates the already poor road conditions leading to the markets. \nSince  most  individual  traders  don't  have  a  great  variety  of  products,  they  do  not  have  much \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n55\n\nbargaining  power  with  customers.  So  it  is  difficult  for  them  to  compete  with  established \nbusinesses. There are also no business-based collective groups, such as farmers' cooperatives, \nto improve their position in the market.  \n \n8. \nPeople  have  several  ways  of  accessing  credit  services  in  the  project  area.  The  China \nBank  of  Agriculture  has  offices  located  in  each  of  the  townships,  as  do  Rural  Credit \nCooperatives. People can borrow money to buy agricultural inputs (such as fertilizer, seeds, etc.) \nor  to  start  up  animal  husbandry  or  cottage  businesses.  They  can  borrow  the  money  for  short-\nterm loans without collateral.  \n \n9. \nGovernment  organizations  such  as  the  agricultural  bureau,  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprise  bureau,  poverty  reduction  office,  women\u2019s  association,  and  labor  bureau  provide \ndifferent  kinds  of  training  to  people  in  the  project  area.  However,  it  is  often  mass  training \ndesigned to appeal to a broad audience, rather than more targeted training tailored for individual \nbusinesses.  Also,  most  training  lacks  the  involvement  of  educational  institutions  such  as \nuniversities.  Such  institutions  have  a  wealth  of  accumulated  knowledge  on  business \nadministration to share. \n \n10. \nTo open a formal business, currently one must obtain business licenses and pay taxes. \nObtaining licenses, dealing with the large amount of paper work, and paying the associated fees \nmake  it  extremely  difficult  to  start  a  business.  The  paperwork  requirement  is  particularly \ncumbersome and not widely understood by many people.  \n \n11. \nPeople  in  the  project  area  have  good  access  to  water  and  electricity,  but  the  road \ninfrastructure linking villages with townships is still poor, especially during the rainy season. This \npoor road infrastructure has been one of major  barriers to developing small businesses in the \narea. \n \n12.  Proposed Actions in the Project Counties. Based on the above-mentioned constraints, \nthe following measures will be taken to develop small businesses and commercial activities in \nthe project area:  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nImprove the condition of roads linking village and townships  \nFacilitate  provisions  (regulations,  trainings,  and  working  capital)  by  the  local \ngovernment to form the farmers' cooperatives \nEstablish permanent market at the township level; if local government lack funds \nto  construct  markets,  additional  funding  sources  will  be  sought  from  external \nsources.  \nEnhance credit services with technical trainings. \nInvolve \nin  community  economic \ndevelopment.  The  Government  may  create  a  partnership  program  to  enhance \ncooperation between educational institutions and local communities. \nIn  cooperation  with  local  government  agencies,  educational  institutions,  and \nnongovernment  organizations,  disseminate \nrequired \nprocedures for opening a formal business. \nEstablish  small  business  incubators  specifically  targeting  small  businesses \nnearby some interchanges. \n\nlocal  universities  and  business  schools \n\ninformation  on \n\nthe \n\n(viii)  Promote  local  tourist  spots  and  restaurants  along  the  highways  through \n\nadvertisements on highway maps, billboards, and signs.  \n\n \n\n\fProposed Actions  \n\nTarget Group(s) \n\nAgencies Involved \n\nTiming \n\nMonitoring Indicators \n\nSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN: 2006\u20132010 \n\n1.

Since the local road program involves \nupgrading existing roads, this will involve little or no land acquisition and resettlement; a short \nresettlement plan has been prepared for this component. Affected persons will receive the same \ncompensation  standards  for  both  components.  Prior  to  commencement  of  land  acquisition, \nSichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (SPCD)  will  update  the  resettlement  plans \nbased on detailed design and detailed measurement survey, and submit the resettlement plans \nto  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  approval.  During  project  construction,  if  there  are \nsignificant material changes in project scope or other causes, an updated resettlement plan will \nprepared,  disclosed  to  affected  persons,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  prior  to \ncommencement of such changes. \n \n2. \nThe  proposed  expressway  will  permanently  require  779  hectares  (ha)  of  land.  It  is \nprojected  that  another  240  ha  of  land  will  be  occupied  temporarily  during  the  construction \nphase.  Based  on  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  standards  for  impact  assessment,  the \nequivalent  of  9,141  persons  would  lose  all  their  land  and  agricultural  livelihoods.  Since  the \nexpressway  will  actually  cross  many  parcels  of  scattered  farmland,  it  is  projected  that  the \naverage loss of land per household will be 13%, which means the number of partially affected \npeople will be on the order of 55,000 persons (or 13,000 households). \n \nAlong with land acquisition, 137,700 square meters (m2) of houses will be demolished, \n3. \nnecessitating relocation of 1,148 households (5,279 persons), which is an average of 23 houses \nper village. The relocation will provide an opportunity to improve current housing conditions for \nrelocated households. Most of these households will be moved a short distance to another site \nwithin  their  original  village.  Rural  housing  will  either  be  built  (i)  in  a  scattered  manner  beside \nroadways,  or  (ii)  in  a  clustered  manner  close  to  existing  settlements;  all  sites  will  be  provided \nwith water supply, electricity, telephone, and television cable.  \n \n4. \nFor the local road component, 30 sections of existing low-class roads (totaling 402 km) \nwill receive road-bed and surface upgrades within the existing alignment. The width of affected \nlocal  roads  will  remain  the  same  and  no  new  bridges  or  significant  realignments  are  planned. \nTherefore,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  can  be  avoided  or  at  least  minimized.  The  local \nroads will be upgraded over 5 years, with a few sections upgraded each year. Three roads will \nbe constructed in 2007; the design work for these has been completed and has confirmed that \nthere will be no land acquisition or resettlement required. Since the design work is done each \nyear,  there  are  no  such  projections  yet  for  the  other  27  sections.  However,  in  order  to  make \nbudgetary  provisions  for  minor  impacts,  it  is  projected  that  permanent  land  acquisition  could \namount to 2 ha, but will not cause any significant (i.e., equivalent to full land loss for 40 persons) \nimpacts  on  households.  Cash  compensation  will  be  provided  to  affected  persons.  Similarly, \nsome  provisions  have  been  made  for  temporary  land  occupation,  affected  trees,  and  some \nstructures.  \n \nFor people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \n5. \nincome  and  living  standards,  in  line  with  the  PRC  Land  Administration  Law  (1998)  and  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). The SPCD will ensure that any people losing land, \nhousing, or other assets or income sources will be supported to fully restore their income and \nliving  standards.  The  Sichuan  provincial  government  in  2004  issued  a  special  decree \nconcerning  land  compensation.  For  the  draft  resettlement  plan,  the  estimated  compensation \nrates (inclusive of land compensation, resettlement subsidies, and young crops) in Tongchuan \ndistrict  and  Xuanhan  county  are  CNY33,600  per  mu  (0.067  ha)  for  irrigated  farmland; \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nfor  coordinating \n\nCNY21,000  per  mu  for  dryland  and  house  plots,  and  CNY12,000  per  mu  for  woodland.  In \nWanyuan County the rates are CNY31,500 per mu for irrigated farmland; CNY19,900 per mu for \ndryland and house plots, and CNY12,000 per mu for woodland. People losing land temporarily \nduring construction will receive a payment equivalent to production value foregone for the period \nof loss, which is expected to be 2 years. Their land will also be restored to its original condition \nby the contractor. \n \n6. \nFor structures to be demolished, replacement value will be provided to the affected rural \nhouseholds based on compensation rates adopted in Dazhou city, which range from CNY350 to \nCNY450/m2  for  brick-and-concrete  structures,  CNY280  to  CNY320/m2  for  brick-and-wood \nstructures, and CNY260/m2 for earth-and-wood structures. Those losing housing will be able to \nacquire new housing sites within their current village group or administrative village; these sites \nwill  have  access  to  electricity  and  water  services  and  will  be  near  a  road.  There  will  be  no \nreduction for depreciation factored into house compensation rates, and people will be allowed to \nsalvage materials from their old houses. \n \nSPCD will assume overall responsibility for implementing resettlement according to the \n7. \napproved  resettlement  plan.  A  resettlement  office  within  Sichuan  Dashaan  Expressway \nCompany  Limited  (SDEC)  will  be  directly  responsible \nthe  planning, \nimplementation, financing, and reporting of land acquisition and resettlement for the expressway \nand connector roads. Within local governments, leading groups and resettlement offices, each \ncomprising six to eight staff members, will be established in Dazhou city and the three affected \ncounties  (districts).  The  county  land  and  resources  offices  will  take  primary  responsibility  for \nresettlement  consultation,  implementation,  and  timely  delivery  of  entitlements,  with  assistance \nfrom  townships  and  villages  concerned.  The  same  arrangements  will  apply  to  the  local  roads, \nexcept that SDEC will not have a role.  \n \n8. \nThe  1998  Land  Law  requires  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  persons. \nMeetings  and  interviews  have  been  held  to  notify  them  about  the  key  elements  of  the \nresettlement  plan.  A  resettlement  information  booklet  was  distributed  to  all  affected  villages  in \nApril and May 2006. During detailed resettlement planning, there will be further consultations to \ndiscuss specific impacts on each village and how these impacts will be addressed. The county, \ntownship,  and  village  officials  will  ensure  that  any  concerns  raised  by  the  people  affected  are \nquickly  addressed.  In  case  of  grievances,  all  complaints  will  be  processed  based  on  the \nGovernment  Regulation  Number  431  on  Grievance  and  Redress.  People  affected  will  submit \ntheir  oral  or  written  complaint  first  to  the  village  committee  or  township  resettlement  office.  If \ntheir complaint is not settled in 2 weeks, they can seek redress at the county resettlement office \nwithin 1 month. If still unresolved within additional 2 weeks, SDEC will try to achieve a solution. \nThe final redress would be sought, if necessary, in the civil courts, in accordance with the Civil \nProcedures Act. \n \n9. \nThe  plan  for  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  included  in  the \nresettlement  plans.  SPCD  will  engage  a  qualified  domestic  monitor  to  carry  out  independent \nresettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  monitor  will  conduct  a  baseline  survey  prior  to \nresettlement,  semiannual  investigations  during  resettlement,  and  annual  survey  updates  for  2 \nyears after the completion of resettlement. The monitor will provide ADB and SPCD with copies \nof  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  twice  a  year  during  resettlement  implementation  and \nonce a year after resettlement completion. An internal monitoring and reporting system will be \nestablished in the resettlement division of SDEC and will report to ADB on the progress of land \nacquisition and  resettlement  through  quarterly  progress  reports  and  a  resettlement  completion \nreport. \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 May 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.1308 \nCNY7.6458 \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \nThe  exchange  rate  of  the  yuan  is  determined  under  a  floating  exchange  rate  system.
