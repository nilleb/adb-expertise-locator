This is one of three associated loans and grants; the \nothers are for Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).1 \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  help  transform  secondary  towns  in  the  GMS  eastern  corridor  into \neconomically  inclusive,  competitive  tourism  destinations  by  improving  transport  infrastructure, \nurban  services,  and  capacity  to  sustainably  manage  tourism  growth.  It  will  expand  trade  in \nservices by promoting cross-border tourism and deepen GMS and Association of Southeast Asian \nNations  (ASEAN)  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  About  168,000  residents  of  Hoa  Binh, \nNghe An, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien Hue provinces are expected to directly benefit \nfrom  climate-resilient  infrastructure  development,  improved  urban  green  space,  cleaner  public \nbeaches,  and  better  access  to  economic  opportunities.  Project  areas  and  investments  are \nprioritized in the ASEAN Tourism Strategic Plan and GMS Tourism Sector Strategy.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSector overview and performance. About 80% of global travel is intraregional. Forecasts \nsuggest that Asia and the Pacific will be the world\u2019s fastest-growing region through 2030, when it \nwill receive 535 million tourists, or 30% of the global market share. In 2016, ASEAN countries \nreceived  116  million  international  tourists,  up  42%  compared  with  2011.  ASEAN  arrivals  are \nexpected to grow 5.1% per year and reach 187 million in 2030.3  \n \n4. \nWithin  ASEAN,  Viet  Nam,  Cambodia,  and  the  Lao  PDR  closely  cooperate  to  promote \nregional  tourism  standards,  tourism  investment,  and  multicountry  tours  that  connect  their \neconomies with larger, more affluent regional markets. Collaboration with neighboring countries \nhelped boost Viet Nam\u2019s international tourist arrivals to 10.0 million in 2016, after increasing by \njust over 10% annually since 2009. Top source markets include the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(27%),  the  Republic  of  Korea  (15%),  and  Japan  (7%).  Tourism  contributes  nearly  5%  to  Viet \nNam\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  and  generates  72%  of  service  exports,  directly  supporting  1.9 \nmillion  jobs\u2014the majority held  by  women  in  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs).  The \ngovernment  targets  a  10%  gross  domestic  product  contribution  by  2020,  when  tourism  is \nexpected to generate $32.5 billion and sustain 1.05 million new jobs. \n \n5. \nGovernment  efforts  to  upgrade  gateway  airports,  transnational  railways  and  highways, \nand secondary roads to boost travel and trade are supported by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and other development partners. Regional policies to liberalize transport services and ease \ncross-border  tourism  complement  physical  infrastructure  investments.4 For  example,  Viet  Nam \npermits  prearranged  tourist  visas  on  arrival  for  182  countries  and  grants  15-day  tourist  visa \n\n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided transaction technical assistance to help design the project and prepare \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion Tourism Sector Strategy 2016\u20132025.

Jakarta. \n\n\f \n\nlack  quality \n\nIndex,  mainly  because  secondary  destinations \n\nexemptions to citizens of all ASEAN countries. As a result, 83% of visitors arrive by air, 15% enter \nthrough overland borders in the GMS economic corridors, and 2% arrive by sea. \n \n6. \nKey challenges. Even with these strengths and opportunities, in 2016 Viet Nam ranked \n6th  in  ASEAN  and  67th  among  136  economies  evaluated  in  the  World  Travel  and  Tourism \nCompetitiveness \ntransport \ninfrastructure,  urban  services,  and  tourist  service  infrastructure.  Other  underlying  problems \ninclude inadequate infrastructure maintenance, weak tourism planning, and ineffective destination \nmarketing,  which  collectively  undermine  the  business-enabling  environment  for  tourism. \nConsequently,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  share  of  ASEAN  international  tourist  arrivals  is  only  8.6%.  Another \nconsequence of underinvestment in secondary destinations is imbalanced tourism growth within \nthe country, with Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, and Quang Ninh province\u2019s Ha Long Bay \narea receiving more than half of international tourist arrivals and corresponding benefits.5 \n \n7. \nClimate  vulnerability.  Secondary  towns  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  segment  of  the  GMS  eastern \ncorridor are vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. Risks include stronger and more \nfrequent typhoons, coastal storm surges, and intensifying rainfall and flooding. These risks are \nexacerbated  by  limited  capacity  to  integrate  adaptation  and  mitigation  solutions.  Countering \nclimate  change  and  natural  disasters  requires  finance  and  knowledge  to  retrofit  and  construct \nclimate-resilient  infrastructure  and  promote  resource  efficiency  programs.  Public  awareness  to \npromote environmentally friendly tourism services and emissions offsets are also needed. \n \n8. \nProject response. To help remove these constraints, the project builds on ADB\u2019s ongoing \nGMS Tourism Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth Project in Viet Nam (2014\u2013) and the successful \nGMS  Sustainable  Tourism  Development  Project  (2008\u20132014)  by  selectively  financing  climate-\nresilient  transport  infrastructure,  urban  infrastructure  and  service  improvements,  and  capacity \nbuilding for better destination management, all of which is needed to boost tourist arrivals and \nspending  in  secondary  destinations.6 Prioritized  investments  are  (i)  road  improvements  to  link \nsmall  towns  with  rural  community-managed  tourist  attractions;  (ii)  ferry  ports  to  increase \npassenger handling capacities and give private operators the facilities needed to expand water \ntransport  and  recreation  services;  (iii)  sanitation  and  drainage  improvements,  seawalls,  and \ncoastal revetments in flood-prone areas; and (iv) capacity building to support the implementation \nof ASEAN tourism standards and strengthen infrastructure operation and maintenance (O&M). \nThe integrated design will assist project provinces attract more and higher-spending visitors, thus \ncontributing to more balanced tourism growth and employment-intensive SME development.   \n \nStrategic  Fit.  The  project  is  consistent  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socioeconomic  Development \n9. \nStrategy  2011\u20132020  objectives  to  foster  climate-resilient  urban  infrastructure  development, \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth,  gender  equity,  regional  cooperation  and  integration,  and \nprivate sector development. It aligns with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table \n1),  ADB  country  partnership  strategy  for  Viet  Nam  2016\u20132020,  and  the  Strategy  for  Tourism \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Tourism  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  and  Viet  Nam \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6  ADB. 2014.

Project activities harmonize with tourism vocational training \nand tourism-related SME promotion support from the Government of Luxembourg and the Swiss \nState  Secretariat  for  Economic  Affairs.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  and  the \nWorld Bank Group also support transport and urban development in the GMS corridors. Regional \nassistance  is  coordinated  by  GMS  tourism,  transport,  and  urban  development  working  groups \ncomprising senior officials, ADB and other development partners, civil society organizations, and \nprivate advisors. Working groups meet at least once a year to direct strategic programming, share \nknowledge and good practices, and coordinate joint activities. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and \nTourism and Viet Nam National Administration of Tourism coordinate national planning and policy \ndialogue with development partners and industry associations. \n \nValue added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s value addition includes support to prepare the \n11. \ncomprehensive  government-endorsed  GMS  Tourism  Sector  Strategy  2016\u20132025.  The  $58.7 \nbillion strategy provides GMS governments and the private sector with a blueprint for competitive, \nbalanced, and sustainable destination development that aligns with ASEAN regional integration \nobjectives.  ADB  facilitated  public\u2013private  dialogue  and  consensus  building  to  select  project \ninvestments that foster synergies with agriculture, transport, and urban development initiatives. \nClimate risk assessments were prepared for all infrastructure subprojects with support from ADB\u2019s \nProject  Readiness  Improvement  Trust  Fund. 8 Capacity  building  for  destination  management \nintegrates the Mekong Innovative Startup in Tourism accelerator to identify and scale innovative \ntechnologies that drive tourism growth in secondary destinations. The Mekong Business Initiative, \nsupported by ADB and the Government of Australia, created the platform. \n \nLessons. To reinforce sustainability and inclusiveness, the project design assimilates key \n12. \nlessons from  ADB\u2019s  past GMS  tourism  projects. First,  infrastructure  subprojects  were  selected \n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2018.

Third,  ASEAN  tourism  standards  target  small \nenterprises that are predominately led by and employ women. Fourth, institutional strengthening \npromotes women\u2019s attainment of managerial and leadership roles. Finally, early capacity building \nfor infrastructure O&M will ensure that suitable asset management systems are in place before \nworks are commissioned.9 \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: sustainable, inclusive, and more balanced \ntourism  development  achieved. 10  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  tourism \ncompetitiveness of secondary towns in Viet Nam increased.11 \n \nC. \n \n14. \nOutput  1:  Urban\u2013rural  access  infrastructure  and  urban  environmental  services \nimproved.  This  output  focuses  on  improving  roads,  water  transport  infrastructure,  and  flood \nprotection in tourist sites. It will (i) upgrade 31 kilometers of district and rural roads, including rest \nareas and scenic points; (ii) construct or improve 13 passenger piers; (iii) rehabilitate and extend \nthe  5.5-kilometer  seawall,  revetments,  and  beachfront  promenade  in  Cua  Lo  town  with  public \ngreen  space,  walkways,  crossroads,  drainage,  and  public  toilets;  and  (iv)  improve  the  existing \nCua Viet\u2013Cua Tung beachfront promenade in Quang Tri by rehabilitating public green space and \nwalkways, drainage, parking areas, public toilets, and small shops that are leased to local vendors. \nAbout  83,500  residents  in  districts  with  road  improvements  will  benefit  from  better  access  to \neconomic  opportunities  and  social  services.  Passenger  piers  will  improve  water  transport  and \nrecreation  services  in  Dong  Hoi,  Dong  Ha,  and  Hue  city.  The  piers  will  benefit  about  24,500 \nresidents, including 130 small ferry and tour boat operators. The improved seawall and drainage \nin Cua Lo town will protect a 228-hectare urban area, directly benefiting about 60,000 residents, \n400 restaurants, and 300 hotels and guesthouses. \n \nOutput  2:  Capacity  to  implement  ASEAN  tourism  standards  strengthened.  This \n15. \noutput will (i) strengthen assessment frameworks, certification bodies, and compliance monitoring \nfor the ASEAN green hotel, homestay, clean tourist city, and clean public toilet standards; and (ii) \ndevelop  incentives  and  conduct  training  to  enable  standards  adoption  by  tourism  and  urban \nservice providers. Counterpart resources will support capacity building to help Cua Lo, Dong Ha, \nDong Hoi, and Hue city attain the ASEAN Clean Tourist City Standard. All public toilets financed \nby the project will be constructed to the ASEAN Clean Public Toilet Standard. The project will pilot \nASEAN  green  hotel  and  homestay  standards  to  demonstrate  how  accommodation  SMEs  can \nboost their competitiveness by improving service quality and consumer confidence. Attaining the \nASEAN Clean Tourist City Standard in the four targeted towns will improve the environment for \nabout 1.1 million residents and more than 8.0 million annual visitors.   \n \nOutput  3:  Institutional  arrangements  for  tourism  destination  management  and \n16. \ninfrastructure O&M strengthened.

MCST will monitor output 2 and 3 progress and coordinate reporting \nto the government and ADB. PMUs will enhance project readiness by preparing basic designs for \nall infrastructure subprojects with counterpart resources and advertising detailed engineering and \nsafeguards  consulting  services  before  loan  signing.  The  5-year  implementation  period  is \nconsidered sufficient because the provinces will carry out decentralized infrastructure design and \nprocurement simultaneously for the project\u2019s eight small works packages. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nTechnical \n\nA. \n \n23. \nThe project is technically feasible. Engineering solutions were selected considering cost, \ndurability, climate, environmental and social impacts, and O&M capacities. Preliminary designs \ncomply  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  construction  standards  and  local  contracting  industry  capabilities. \nClimate-resilience measures include stronger road base and pavement structures, correctly sited \nrobust seawalls and revetments with suitable foundation levels and crest heights, higher capacity \ndrainage, energy efficient lighting, and bio-engineered river embankment and slope protection. \nPassenger  piers  incorporate  sturdy  elevated  concrete  and  steel  structures  able  to  withstand \nprojected  storm  surges  and  river  flow  velocities.  Programs  to  build  destination  management \ncapacity were designed based on stakeholder consultations and institutional analyses of tourism, \ntransport,  and  urban  management  entities.  ASEAN  tourism  standards  will  be  implemented \nfollowing approved manuals and criteria. Special design features to uphold long-term sustainable \nmaintenance of project investments include maximum use of robustly engineered, steel reinforced \nconcrete  roads  and  structures  with  lower  life  cycle  O&M  costs,  and  resources  to  strengthen \nprovincial  and  district  infrastructure  O&M  planning  and  budgeting.  The  project  will  procure \nappropriate equipment and assist management entities to incorporate maintenance requirements \ninto ferry pier and tourism services management contracts. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nEconomic analyses were prepared for the integrated project components following ADB \nguidelines.14 Costs  comprise  infrastructure  and  capacity-building  investments  and  the  market \nvalue  of  land  to  be  acquired.  Benefits  quantified  conservatively  include  (i)  increased  tourism \nreceipts from incremental annual visitor arrivals (0.3%\u20135.8%) and additional length of stay (0.1\u2013\n0.5  days)  in  project  areas,  and  (ii)  vehicle  operating  cost  savings  from  reductions  in  road \nroughness.15 Base-case economic internal rates of return range from 11.9% to 14.8% for road \nimprovement  subprojects,  from  11.5%  to  25.5%  for  the  ferry  piers,  and  29.8%  for  coastal \nprotection and public space improvements. All subprojects remain viable under adverse scenarios \nwhereby  costs  are  10%  higher,  benefits  10%  lower,  there  are  10%  fewer  tourist  arrivals,  or \nimplementation is delayed by 1 year. The expected economic benefits are consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncompleted GMS tourism projects in Viet Nam, which generated economic internal rates of return \nof 22.8%\u201382.2% for similar road and pier improvements in secondary tourist destinations.16 \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\n                                                 \n14 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 International visitor arrival increases range from 2% in Quang Binh province to 32% in Thua Thien Hue province. \n16 ADB. 2017. Completion Report: Greater Mekong Subregion Sustainable Tourism Development Project. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nFinancial analyses prepared in line with ADB guidelines confirm the financial viability of \n25. \nthe  following  revenue-generating  subprojects:  (i)  Nhat  Le\u2013Long  Dai  river  and  road  access \nimprovements, (ii) Con Co island access improvements, and (iii) Hue tourist piers improvements. \nQuantified revenue streams comprising passenger fees, berthing and parking fees, and rent were \nassessed in nominal terms. Base-case financial internal rates of return range from 7.4% to 23.0%, \nhigher than the 3.0% weighted average cost of capital. Non-revenue-generating roads, coastal \nprotection,  and  urban  space  improvements  will  require  minor  additional  annual  provincial \nbudgetary  allocations  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance.  Loan  assurances  require  each \nprovince to ensure that their annual budget includes sufficient O&M funding for project facilities, \nunderscoring the Government\u2019s commitment to fund sustainable asset maintenance.17 \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe  financial  management  and  procurement  risks  for  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies are  assessed substantial. The main  constraints  are  the  lack  of qualified  accountants \nand procurement specialists in provinces. Risk mitigation measures in the financial management \naction plans emphasize hands-on disbursement and procurement training for PMUs by ADB staff \nand consultants, and requirements to use standard ADB-approved procurement documents for \nADB-financed transactions. All executing agencies except Hoa Binh have significant experience \nin managing advance accounts and statement-of-expenditure procedures. The terms of reference \nfor external auditors were agreed with the executing agencies during project preparation and form \npart of the PAM. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  agencies  involved  in  the  project.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  about  168,000  people.  Project  support  to  implement \nASEAN Clean Tourism City Standard will improve the livability of Cua Lo, Dong Ha, Dong Hoi, \nand Hue cities, benefitting an additional 1.1 million residents, of which 50% are women and girls. \nPoverty rates in project areas range from 7.3% to 17.8%, all higher than the 7.0% national average \nbecause  of  low  incomes,  insufficient  productive  assets,  undereducation,  and  limited  skills  and \ntraining  opportunities.  The  project\u2019s  integrated  investments  are  designed  to  minimize  these \nconstraints  and  diversify  employment  and  income  sources  for  rural  and  urban  lower-income \nhouseholds. Stakeholder communication and participation plans include activities to help women \nand vulnerable groups recognize and avoid social risks associated with tourism. \n \n28. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  participating \nprovinces  prepared  the  gender  action  plan  in  consultation  with  female  and  male  project \nbeneficiaries and government officials. Each PMU will implement and monitor the gender action \nplan. Specific actions to promote gender equality include (i) separate consultations with women \nand  men  to  ensure  gender-sensitive  detailed  engineering  designs;  (ii)  requirements  to  involve \nwomen  in  infrastructure  construction  and  management;  (iii)  equal  participation  in  sanitation \nawareness  and  information  and  education  campaigns  to  prevent  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking, \nand  child  exploitation;  and  (iv)  appointment  of  women  as  managers  and  leaders  of  tourism \nstandards  assessment  boards  and  project  management  entities.  The  project  performance \nmanagement  system  will  compile  sex-  and  ethnic-disaggregated  data  to  monitor  and  evaluate \nresults. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                 \n17 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nEnvironment \n\n(category  B).  The  participating  provinces  prepared  one \n\nE. \n \n29. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguards \ncategorization  is  B  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. 18  All \nsafeguards documents were prepared based on meaningful consultations with affected people \nand  communities,  endorsed  by  government  authorities,  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  2011.  Grievance  redress,  monitoring,  and \nreporting  procedures  are  properly  established  in  all  safeguards  documents.  During  project \nimplementation, all safeguards documents will be updated based on detailed engineering designs, \nreviewed by ADB, and publicly disclosed. The project includes adequate resources to update all \nsafeguards  documents  and  implement  environmental  and  social  monitoring.  PPCs  have \nadequate capacity to ensure compliance with the project\u2019s safeguards requirements. \n \n30. \ninitial \nenvironmental examination and five environmental management plans (EMPs), each covering the \nproject\u2019s  area  of  influence  and  all  road,  ferry  pier,  coastal  protection,  and  public  space \nimprovement subprojects. The EMPs provide adequate measures to mitigate the expected minor \nand  temporary  construction  impacts  and  the  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  of \nincreased tourism activity, particularly in coastal environments and near protected areas.19 Better \nroads,  drainage  and  flood  protection,  safe  ferry  piers,  improved  public  green  space,  and  the \nadoption  of  ASEAN  tourism  standards  are  expected  to  generate  overall  net  environmental \nbenefits. Loan covenants require contractors and destination management agencies to comply \nwith initial environmental examination and EMP mitigation measures. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Land  acquisition  and  business  disruption  will \n31. \naffect 176 households (759 affected people) in four provinces (Hoa Binh, Nghe An, Quang Tri, \nand Thua Thien Hue). There are 20 severely affected households (86 severely affected people). \nOne house-cum-shop will be physically displaced, and 72 households are classified vulnerable \nincluding  56  Muong  ethnic  minority  households.  Due  diligence  confirms  at  preliminary  design \nthere are no involuntary resettlement impacts expected in Quang Binh. Three resettlement plans \nand  one  combined  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  plan  were  prepared  by  the \nprovincial  executing  agencies  with  the  assistance  of  social  development  specialists.  All  plans \nreflect  meaningful  consultations  with  affected  households  and  include  suitable  livelihood \nimprovement  programs  and  grievance  redress  mechanisms.  The  initial  resettlement  and \ncompensation costs are estimated at $813,256. This amount is considered adequate based on \nthe inventories of losses prepared in consultation with the affected households. PPCs will appoint \nqualified PMU staff to properly implement the plans using project resources. \n \n32. \nIndigenous peoples (category B). The project will positively affect Muong ethnic people \nby creating culturally appropriate jobs, diversifying income, and strengthening their involvement \nin tourism management and decision making. Ethnic groups will equally benefit from improved \naccess  to  economic  opportunities  and  social  services,  better  destination  management,  and \ncapacity building. The project will not displace ethnic households from traditional or customary \nlands or negatively impact ethnic minority identity, culture, or customary livelihood systems. The \nresettlement and ethnic minority development plan identifies the potential negative impacts, and \ncontains adequate measures to mitigate them. \n \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB.
