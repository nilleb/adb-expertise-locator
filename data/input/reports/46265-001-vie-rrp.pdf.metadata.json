The project will lead to greenhouse gas abatement by reducing the \namount  of  energy  and  water  required  to  deliver  a  unit  of  water  to  end  users.  The  project  will \nfinance consulting services and investment components for energy efficiency.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nSince the year 2000, Viet Nam has experienced economic growth averaging nearly 8%, \nwhich is evident in the rapid growth of its urban areas such as HCMC, which had a population of \n7.1  million  in  2010.  This  growth  has  led  to  inadequate  capacity  to  manage  and  finance  the \nexpansion of infrastructure facilities and has put pressure on the environment. The Government \nof Viet Nam has set comprehensive and ambitious policies, which, among other things, aim to \npromote  efficiency  and  conservation  while  expanding  access  to  reliable  water  supply.  The \nsector  program  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  the  Viet  Nam  country  strategy  and \nprogram, 2007\u20132010 and the Viet Nam country partnership strategy, 2012\u201320152 are consistent \nwith  government  policies  for  energy  efficiency  and  infrastructure  provision,  especially  in  water \nand sanitation. The Viet Nam Water and Sanitation Sector Assessment Strategy and Roadmap \nrecognizes  the  need  for  better  protection  and  efficient  use  of  water.3 In  2007,  the  government \nenacted (and supplemented in 2011) a strong legal framework for the supply of water, shifting \nwater from a social good to a business commodity.4 The water subsector is expected to operate \non full  cost-recovery. The introduction  of a  service contract (i.e.,  a  business plan),  as required \nunder  the  current  legislation  (footnote  4),  but  mostly  not  enforced,  would  improve  efficiency  in \nthe  water  subsector.  ADB\u2019s  capacity  development  technical  assistance 5  is  assisting  water \ncompanies  to  develop  business  plans  and  service  contracts  to  justify  water  tariff  increase \nmatching the documented improvement in the level of service. \n \nHCMC is Viet Nam\u2019s largest city and its most important commercial and industrial center. \n4. \nWith current population growth of about 1.1% per year, HCMC will have about 10 million people \nby 2020. While Viet Nam\u2019s gross domestic product is growing at more than 8% annually, that of \nHCMC  is  growing  substantially  faster,  at  around  11%  annually.  This  growth  rate  is  seriously \nstraining the city\u2019s infrastructure, including the water supply system. In addition, HCMC is one of \nthe 10 cities in the world likely to experience the early impacts of climate change, in particular a \nprojected sea-level rise of 33 centimeters by 2050. \n\n                                                \n1  Established by the Government of Japan and administered by the Asian Development Bank.  \n2  ADB. 2012.

Manila (TA 8357-VIE). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n5. \nSet  up  in  1874,  SAWACO  is  Viet  Nam\u2019s  oldest  water  company  and  is  responsible  for \nwater  supply  in  HCMC.  It  has  operated  since  2004  as  a  state-owned  one-member  limited \ncompany  under  the  Commercial  Law,  2005.  Six  distribution  companies,  incorporated  as  joint-\nstock  companies  and  51%  owned  by  SAWACO,  and  two  other  companies,  fully  owned  by \nSAWACO, are in charge of water distribution in HCMC.  \n \n6. \nThe water supply system in HCMC has five major production plants with a total capacity \nof  1.34 million  cubic meters  per  day,  and 3,800 kilometers  of  distribution  network,  divided into \nsix zones with 734,000 connections. The fundamental constraint on the water supply system is \na  shortfall  in  transmission  capacity.  Actual  coverage  is  estimated  at  82%  but  large  areas  of \nHCMC, especially in the south, still suffer from intermittent water supply because of low service \npressure.  SAWACO  has  a  $2.8  billion  investment  plan,  the  objectives  of which  are  to  achieve \nuniversal coverage, continuous water supply, and drinking water quality by 2025. \n \nHCMC\u2019s  nonrevenue  water  (NRW)  is  estimated  at  40%.  The  World  Bank  supports  a \n7. \nnumber  of  ongoing  initiatives  to  reduce  NRW  in  the  city  center  zones  1  and  2,  and  the \nGovernment  of  the  Netherlands  supported  an  utility  support  program.  ADB  is  also  assisting \nSAWACO  for  NRW  reduction  in  the  two  southern  zones  5  and  6  through  the  Water  Sector \nInvestment  Program  Tranche  1. 6  Private  sector  participation  is  being  explored  for  capital \ninvestment in NRW and the operation and maintenance of the network in the northern zones 3 \nand 4 with ADB assistance.  \n \n8. \nADB  financed  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  of  $1.5  million  in  2008,  with \nsupplementary financing of $0.3 million in 2010, for HCMC water supply.7 A loan of $138 million \nfor  HCMC  water  supply  was  approved  Tranche  1  (footnote  6)  of  a  $1  billion  multitranche \nfinancing  facility  for  the  Water  Sector  Investment  Program  (MFF).8 The  framework  financing \nagreement of the MFF (footnote 8) was signed on 5 May 2011, the loan and project agreements \nwere signed on 8 June 2011, and the Tranche 1 (footnote 6) became effective on 24 May 2012. \n \n9. \nTranche 1 (footnote 6)  will benefit 2.5 million persons with improved service and 20,000 \npoor households with their own piped water connection for the first time. The loan closing was \nextended by two years to 30 June 2018, because of long project from start-up delays in signing \nthe  subsidiary  loan  agreement.  In  June  2013,  four  contracts  were  awarded  to  individual \nconsultants:  Two  for  climate  change  thematic  studies  on  water  conservancy  and  disaster \nmanagement and two to prepare bidding documents for (i) information technology ($28 million); \nand,  (ii)  10  km  transmission  pipe  ($78  million)  under  engineering  procurement  construction \n(EPC) using ADB\u2019s pilot bidding document for EPC contract. \n \n10. \nTranche  1  (footnote  6)  complies  with  the  Framework  Financing  Agreement,  including \nsafeguards,  undertakings  and  financial  ratios.  In  addition,  SAWACO  has  established  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) with a full time PMU director and deputy director.  Fifty percent of the \nPMU  staff  are  women,  well  above  the  required  30%  in  the  Gender  Action  Plan.  Since  2011, \nselected  PMU  staff  participated  in  ADB  training  workshops  in  Viet  Nam  on  safeguards, \ndisbursement and procurement.  \n\n                                                \n6   ADB. 2011.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing  Facility  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Water  Sector  Investment  Program.  Manila \n(MFF0054-VIE). \n\n\f \n11. \nDuring  the  project  preparation  technical  assistance  of  HCMC  Water  Supply  Project, \nSAWACO conducted an energy audit of its operations. The audit report showed that investment \nof  about  $5  million  would  result  in  energy  savings  of  25,000  megawatt-hours  per  year, \ntranslating  to  about  $1.3  million  per  year,  and  an  annual  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  reduction  of \nabout 18,889 tons. The grant financing of $2 million towards energy savings investment would \ndirectly  result  in  about  10,000  megawatt-hours,  or  $500,000  per  year,  of  energy  savings  and \nabout  7,500  tons  of  annual  CO2  reduction.  The  grant  project  directly  contributes  to  the \nachievement of outcome of Tranche 1 (footnote 6) by improving efficiency of SAWACO through \nenergy savings. \n \n12. \nFollowing  the  results  of  the  audit,  SAWACO  invested  in  some  energy  efficient \ncomponents, identified in the energy audit as having a short payback period, especially to equip \nthe  treated  water  pumps  with  variable  frequency  drives.  SAWACO  requested  ADB  assistance \nfor  additional  investments  for  overall  improvement  of  the  water  pumping  scheme,  including \nreduction of technical water losses and grid electricity consumption, through a $2 million grant \nfrom the  ACEF under  the Clean Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility.9 Under  the  project  and \nfollowing  the  baseline  methodology for  water  pumping  efficiency  improvements,  SAWACO  will \nalso apply for additional funding to the Clean Development Mechanism.10  \n \nADB\u2019s  sector  program  in  the  Viet  Nam  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132015  is \n13. \nconsistent with government policies for energy efficiency and infrastructure provision. There is a \nneed  for  better  protection  and  efficient  use  of  water,  as  recognized  in  the  ADB  Water \nOperational Plan.11 The grant, used as seed money to leverage additional capital expenditure in \nenergy  efficiency,  will  be  recovered  through  savings  in  operating  expenses.  This  type  of \ninvestment  will  be  streamlined  and  up-scaled  with  other  water  companies  that  seek  financing \nunder subsequent tranches of the MFF (footnote 8).  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  project  is  improved  operational  performance  of  SAWACO.  The \n\n14. \noutcome is improved energy efficiency in SAWACO operations.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \n\nThe following are the outputs under the ACEF grant: \n(i) \n\nOutput  1:  Capacity  building  of  SAWACO.  Capacity  development  through \nconsulting services will include monitoring and evaluation of the investment. It will \nalso support information, communication, and education for capacity building and \nan  awareness  campaign  in  energy  savings  for  SAWACO\u2019s  3,000  staff  and  its \nmanagement. \nOutput  2:  Investment  in  energy  saving.  Physical  investment  for  energy \nefficiency that includes (a) frequency converters for the three raw water pumps at \nTan  Hiep  treatment  plant,  including  control  for  the  pumps  to  maintain  a  target \nlaboratory;  and  (c)  quality  calibration \npressure;  (b)  a  mobile  monitoring \ntechnology  and  central  air-conditioning  systems  that  use  new  technology  to \n\n(ii)  \n\n                                                \n9    The grant was approved on 17 June 2011 by the Government of Japan with validity until 15 November  2013. \n10   Defined in article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n11   ADB. 2011.

One goods contract for frequency converters \nfor the raw water pumps will be procured through international competitive bidding procedures \nand  two  goods  contracts  (for  the  mobile  laboratory  and  the  air-conditioner)  will  be  procured \nunder  national  competitive  bidding  procedures.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nInformation  Communication  Education  consultant  will  be  recruited  as  a  firm,  using  consultant \nqualification selection, since the contract is small (less than $200,000) and implemented within a \nshort  period  (12  months).  Few  firms  have  the  dedicated  expertise  to  assist  SAWACO  in \npromoting  its  energy  efficiency  policy  and  building  awareness  and  capacity  of  SAWACO  staff \nand management.  \n \n21. \nThe PMU will prioritize disbursement to suppliers and consultants using direct payment \nprocedures. A project imprest account will be set up upon grant effectiveness to facilitate project \nimplementation  and  the  flow  of  funds.

The \nPMU will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and services \nfinanced from the proceeds of the grant, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for \nthe grant, and use of local funds. Within 6 months of the close of each year, the PMU will submit \naudited annual grant accounts, which provide a detailed description of the source of funds and \nexpenditures made, and submit SAWACO's audited annual consolidated financial statements to \nADB.  An  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the  annual  project  accounts  and  SAWACO's \nconsolidated  financial  statements.

The annual audit, financed under the tranche 1 (footnote 6) of \nthe investment program (footnote 8), will include an audit opinion on the project imprest account \nand statement of expenditures of the project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n23. \nProject  preparation  was  completed  in  September  2010,  including  an  energy  audit  of \nSAWACO, that led to the request for grant funding. The request for the ACEF to fund the energy \nefficiency grant was thoroughly reviewed both by ADB and the donor, the Government of Japan. \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n24. \nThe  proposed  investment  will  be  for  energy  saving  equipment  that  will  reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions and the carbon and water footprints of SAWACO. This will result in \n(i) direct savings of $500,000 per year on electricity cost and 7,500 tons CO2 reduction, and (ii) \nindirect savings of $1.3 million per year and 18,889 tons CO2 reduction. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe investment has a payback period of less than 5 years. Incremental cost calculations \n25. \nare included in supplementary appendix. Economic and financial analysis were also completed \nunder the tranche 1 (footnote 6) and disclosed on the ADB website. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nThe  grant  will  be  implemented  parallel  to  the  tranche  1  (footnote  6)  by  the  same  PMU \nimplementing  Tranche  1  (footnote  6).  All  the  fiduciary  requirements  from  this  project  will  also \napply to the grant.  \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  SAWACO.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  energy  savings  will  reduce  pressure \n\nInformation \n28. \nCommunication Education component aims for 50% of the trainees to be women. The project is \nclassified as having some gender benefits. \n \nHCMC\u2019s overall poverty rate of 12% disguises poverty rates of more than 50% in some \n29. \nwards  and  districts.  The  urban  poor  are  both  long-term  residents  and  migrant  households. \nSurveys  show  a  low  incidence  of  waterborne  disease.  Satisfaction  with  SAWACO\u2019s  service  is \n\ntariffs.  The \n\nincrease \n\nto \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fgood  overall,  despite  some  dissatisfaction  because  of  poor  water  quality.  Among  households \nconnected to piped water, 84% have individual connections, 12% shared connections with their \nown meter, and 4% shared connections with a shared meter. Many households buy water from \ntankers  and  pay  almost  twice  the  official  water  tariff  of  D4,000\u2013D10,000  per  cubic  meter. \nAlthough  policy  dictates  free  connections,  the  tertiary  distribution  network  is  obviously  lacking \nand will be extended under the program by the component that rehabilitates and replaces pipes. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\nThe  project  is  classified  C  for  environment  (positive  impact),  involuntary  resettlement, \n\n30. \nand indigenous peoples. \n \nDue  diligence  confirmed  that  the  project  will  not  entail  any  land  acquisition  and \n31. \nresettlement  impacts,  since  the  equipment  will  be  installed  within  the  boundary  of  the  water \nproduction plant and that there are no indigenous peoples living in the project area in HCMC. \n \nThe  project  has  a  positive  impact  on  the  environment.  Viet  Nam  is  a  signatory  to  the \n32. \nMontreal  Protocol,  therefore  not  only  will  the  executing  agency  make  sure  it  follows  the \ngovernment\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  on  environmental  impact  assessments  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  but  it  will  also  abide  by  laws  that  implement  the \ngovernment\u2019s  obligations  under  international  law.  Specifically,  on  the  project's  proposed \ninvestment  for  air-conditioning  systems,  and  as  provided  for  in  para.  33  of  Safeguard \nRequirements 1 of the Safeguard Policy Statement, such systems to be installed should not use \nchemicals  classified  as  ozone-depleting  substances  and  which  are  scheduled  for  phase-out \nunder  the  Montreal  Protocol 13  on  Substances  that  Deplete  the  Ozone  Layer,  such  as \nchlorofluorocarbons;  halons;  1,1,1-trichloroethane  (methyl  chloroform);  carbon  tetrachloride; \nhydro  chlorofluorocarbons;  hydro  bromofluorocarbons;  and  methyl  bromide.  This  includes  the \nProhibited Investment Activity List, as item (ii) of the list highlights the ban on the use of ozone-\ndepleting substances being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. If there is any discrepancy \nbetween  the  government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  and  those  of  ADB,  the  ADB  policy  will  apply. \nThe  procurement  of  the  chemical  for  installation  of  the  air-conditioning  unit  will  be  reported  in \nthe project progress report and in the project completion report. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33. \nThe  major  risk  is  delay  in  project  implementation.  SAWACO  is  already  implementing \nWorld Bank  and  ADB-financed  projects. The  PMU  staff has  been  trained  in  ADB  procurement \nand  disbursement  guidelines.  SAWACO  has  already  initiated  some  investments  in  energy \nefficiency with its own funds. Other risks include (i) lack of enforcement of Government policies, \nresulting  in  unsustainable  operations  for  SAWACO,  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of \ncapacity development technical assistance (footnote 5); and (ii) political interference preventing \nsuccessful  implementation  and  financial  sustainability,  especially  on  provision  of  counterpart \nfunding  and  water  tariff  increase.  HCMC  Peoples\u2019  Committee  has  provided  strong  support  for \nSAWACO under Tranche 1 (footnote 6), including water tariff increases over 70% between 2009 \nand  2013.  Ministry  of  Finance  issued  a  joint-circular  on  calculating  water  tariff.  There  are  no \nmajor risk and mitigation measures to be implemented as part of this project. A risk assessment \nand risk management plan is included.14 \n \n\n                                                \n13 http://ozone.unep.org/Publications/MP_Handbook/MP-Handbook-2012.pdf \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n34. \nThe  government  and  SAWACO  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards  (including  government\u2019s  undertaking  under  the  Montreal  Protocol  on \nSubstances  that  Deplete  the  Ozone  Layer),  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement, as described in detail in the project administration manual and grant documents. \n \n35. \nwhich are set forth in the grant agreement and project agreement.  \n \n\nThe  government  and  SAWACO  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n36. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the administration by \nADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $2,000,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet \nNam for the Energy Efficiency for Ho Chi Minh City Water Supply Project, to be provided by the \nAsian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \n  President \n\n \n25 September 2013 \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n9 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks \n\n \n \nDesign Summary \nImpact \nImproved operational \nperformance of \nSAWACO \n\nOutcome \nEnergy efficiency in \nSAWACO operations \nimproved \n\nOutputs  \n1.
