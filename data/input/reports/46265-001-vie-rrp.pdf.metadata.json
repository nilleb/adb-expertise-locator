I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  proposed \nadministration of a grant to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, to be provided by the Asian \nClean Energy Fund (ACEF)1 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for the \nEnergy Efficiency for Ho Chi Minh City Water Supply Project.  \n \n2.  The project will help to improve energy efficiency and reduce the water and carbon \nfootprint of the Saigon Water Corporation (SAWACO), which is in charge of the water supply in \nHo Chi Minh City (HCMC). The project will lead to greenhouse gas abatement by reducing the \namount of energy and water required to deliver a unit of water to end users. The project will \nfinance consulting services and investment components for energy efficiency.   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Since the year 2000, Viet Nam has experienced economic growth averaging nearly 8%, \nwhich is evident in the rapid growth of its urban areas such as HCMC, which had a population of \n7.1 million in 2010. This growth has led to inadequate capacity to manage and finance the \nexpansion of infrastructure facilities and has put pressure on the environment. The Government \nof Viet Nam has set comprehensive and ambitious policies, which, among other things, aim to \npromote efficiency and conservation while expanding access to reliable water supply.  The \nsector program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the Viet Nam country strategy and \nprogram, 2007\u20132010 and the Viet Nam country partnership strategy, 2012\u201320152 are consistent \nwith government policies for energy efficiency and infrastructure provision, especially in water \nand sanitation. The Viet Nam Water and Sanitation Sector Assessment Strategy and Roadmap \nrecognizes the need for better protection and efficient use of water.3 In 2007, the government \nenacted (and supplemented in 2011) a strong legal framework for the supply of water, shifting \nwater from a social good to a business commodity.4 The water subsector is expected to operate \non full cost-recovery. The introduction of a service contract (i.e., a business plan), as required \nunder the current legislation (footnote 4), but mostly not enforced, would improve efficiency in \nthe  water  subsector.  ADB\u2019s  capacity  development  technical  assistance5 is  assisting  water \ncompanies to  develop  business  plans  and  service  contracts to  justify  water tariff  increase \nmatching the documented improvement in the level of service. \n \n4.  HCMC is Viet Nam\u2019s largest city and its most important commercial and industrial center. \nWith current population growth of about 1.1% per year, HCMC will have about 10 million people \nby 2020. While Viet Nam\u2019s gross domestic product is growing at more than 8% annually, that of \nHCMC is growing substantially faster, at around 11% annually. This growth rate is seriously \nstraining the city\u2019s infrastructure, including the water supply system. In addition, HCMC is one of \nthe 10 cities in the world likely to experience the early impacts of climate change, in particular a \nprojected sea-level rise of 33 centimeters by 2050. \n                                                \n1  Established by the Government of Japan and administered by the Asian Development Bank.  \n2  ADB. 2012.

Capacity Development Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Improving the \nPerformance of the Water Supply Project Sector. Manila (TA 8357-VIE). \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Set up in 1874, SAWACO is Viet Nam\u2019s oldest water company and is responsible for \nwater supply in HCMC. It has operated since 2004 as a state-owned one-member limited \ncompany under the Commercial Law, 2005. Six distribution companies, incorporated as joint-\nstock companies and 51% owned by SAWACO, and two other companies, fully owned by \nSAWACO, are in charge of water distribution in HCMC.  \n \n6.  The water supply system in HCMC has five major production plants with a total capacity \nof 1.34 million cubic meters per day, and 3,800 kilometers of distribution network, divided into \nsix zones with 734,000 connections. The fundamental constraint on the water supply system is \na shortfall in transmission capacity. Actual coverage is estimated at 82% but large areas of \nHCMC, especially in the south, still suffer from intermittent water supply because of low service \npressure. SAWACO has a $2.8 billion investment plan, the objectives of which are to achieve \nuniversal coverage, continuous water supply, and drinking water quality by 2025. \n \n7.  HCMC\u2019s nonrevenue water (NRW) is estimated at 40%. The World Bank supports a \nnumber  of  ongoing  initiatives  to  reduce  NRW  in  the  city  center  zones  1  and  2,  and  the \nGovernment of the Netherlands supported an utility support program. ADB is also assisting \nSAWACO for NRW reduction in the two southern zones 5 and 6 through the Water Sector \nInvestment  Program  Tranche  1.6 Private  sector  participation  is  being  explored  for  capital \ninvestment in NRW and the operation and maintenance of the network in the northern zones 3 \nand 4 with ADB assistance.  \n \n8.  ADB financed project preparatory technical assistance of $1.5 million in 2008,  with \nsupplementary financing of $0.3 million in 2010, for HCMC water supply.7 A loan of $138 million \nfor HCMC  water supply was approved Tranche 1 (footnote 6) of a $1 billion multitranche \nfinancing facility for the Water Sector Investment Program (MFF).8 The framework financing \nagreement of the MFF (footnote 8) was signed on 5 May 2011, the loan and project agreements \nwere signed on 8 June 2011, and the Tranche 1 (footnote 6) became effective on 24 May 2012. \n \n9.  Tranche 1 (footnote 6)  will benefit 2.5 million persons with improved service and 20,000 \npoor households with their own piped water connection for the first time. The loan closing was \nextended by two years to 30 June 2018, because of long project from start-up delays in signing \nthe  subsidiary  loan  agreement.  In  June  2013,  four  contracts  were  awarded  to  individual \nconsultants:  Two  for  climate  change  thematic  studies  on  water  conservancy  and  disaster \nmanagement and two to prepare bidding documents for (i) information technology ($28 million); \nand, (ii) 10 km transmission pipe ($78 million) under engineering procurement construction \n(EPC) using ADB\u2019s pilot bidding document for EPC contract. \n \n10.  Tranche 1 (footnote 6) complies with the Framework Financing Agreement, including \nsafeguards, undertakings and financial ratios. In addition, SAWACO has established a project \nmanagement unit (PMU) with a full time PMU director and deputy director. Fifty percent of the \nPMU staff are women, well above the required 30% in the Gender Action Plan. Since 2011, \nselected  PMU  staff  participated  in  ADB  training  workshops  in  Viet  Nam  on  safeguards, \ndisbursement and procurement.  \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2011.

Manila \n(MFF0054-VIE). \n ", "3 \n \n11.  During the project preparation technical assistance of HCMC Water Supply Project, \nSAWACO conducted an energy audit of its operations. The audit report showed that investment \nof  about  $5  million  would  result  in  energy  savings  of  25,000  megawatt-hours  per  year, \ntranslating to about $1.3 million per year, and an annual carbon dioxide (CO ) reduction of \n2\nabout 18,889 tons. The grant financing of $2 million towards energy savings investment would \ndirectly result in about 10,000 megawatt-hours, or $500,000 per year, of energy savings and \nabout  7,500  tons  of  annual  CO   reduction.  The  grant  project  directly  contributes  to  the \n2\nachievement of outcome of Tranche 1 (footnote 6) by improving efficiency of SAWACO through \nenergy savings. \n \n12.  Following  the  results  of  the  audit,  SAWACO  invested  in  some  energy  efficient \ncomponents, identified in the energy audit as having a short payback period, especially to equip \nthe treated water pumps with variable frequency drives. SAWACO requested ADB assistance \nfor additional investments for overall improvement of the water pumping scheme, including \nreduction of technical water losses and grid electricity consumption, through a $2 million grant \nfrom the ACEF under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility.9 Under the project and \nfollowing the baseline methodology for water pumping efficiency improvements, SAWACO will \nalso apply for additional funding to the Clean Development Mechanism.10  \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s  sector  program  in  the  Viet  Nam  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132015  is \nconsistent with government policies for energy efficiency and infrastructure provision. There is a \nneed  for  better  protection  and  efficient  use  of  water,  as  recognized  in  the  ADB  Water \nOperational Plan.11 The grant, used as seed money to leverage additional capital expenditure in \nenergy  efficiency,  will  be  recovered  through  savings  in  operating  expenses.  This  type  of \ninvestment will be streamlined and up-scaled with other water companies that seek financing \nunder subsequent tranches of the MFF (footnote 8).  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The  impact  of  the  project  is  improved  operational  performance  of  SAWACO.  The \noutcome is improved energy efficiency in SAWACO operations.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The following are the outputs under the ACEF grant: \n(i)  Output  1:  Capacity  building  of  SAWACO.  Capacity  development  through \nconsulting services will include monitoring and evaluation of the investment. It will \nalso support information, communication, and education for capacity building and \nan awareness campaign in energy savings for SAWACO\u2019s 3,000 staff and its \nmanagement. \n(ii)   Output  2:  Investment  in  energy  saving.  Physical  investment  for  energy \nefficiency that includes (a) frequency converters for the three raw water pumps at \nTan Hiep treatment plant, including control for the pumps to maintain a target \npressure;  (b)  a  mobile  monitoring  laboratory;  and  (c)  quality  calibration \ntechnology  and  central  air-conditioning  systems  that  use  new  technology  to \n                                                \n9   The grant was approved on 17 June 2011 by the Government of Japan with validity until 15 November  2013. \n10  Defined in article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n11   ADB. 2011.

Investment and Financing Plans  \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $3.8 million (Table 1). On behalf of SAWACO, ADB has \nrequested a $2 million grant from the ACEF under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility. The grant will finance all the consulting services and part of the equipment for energy \nefficiency. The government will finance some equipment for energy efficiency, especially for the \ntreated water pumps, and office space for the consultants, incremental cost of the project \nmanagement unit, and taxes and duties.

Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The executing agency, the HCMC People\u2019s Committee, has already received delegation \nof the project management by the Prime Minister under Decree 131/2006/NND-CP. The project \nowner, SAWACO under the HCMC People\u2019s Committee, will implement the grant investment \nproject through the project management unit (PMU) set up under Tranche 1 (footnote 6). \n \n ", "5 \n19.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.12 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2014\u2013December 2015 \nEstimated completion date  30 December 2015 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Not Applicable \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ho Chi Minh City People\u2019s Committee \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Saigon Water Corporation, Ho Chi Minh City \n(iv)  Implementation unit  PMU in SAWACO, 20 staff (under Ho Chi Minh City Water Supply \nProject) \nProcurement  International  1 contract   $700,000 \ncompetitive bidding \nNational competitive  2 contracts  $800,000 \nbidding \nConsulting services  CQS  27 person-months (5  $190,000 \ninternational and 22 national) \nIndividual  5 contracts for a total of 36  $260,000 \nperson-months (8 \ninternational and 28 national) \nRetroactive financing and/or  Not applicable \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement   The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultant qualification selection, PMU = project management unit, SAWACO \n= Saigon Water Corporation. \nSource: ADB project team. \n \n20.  All procurement of goods will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). One goods contract for frequency converters \nfor the raw water pumps will be procured through international competitive bidding procedures \nand two goods contracts (for the mobile laboratory and the air-conditioner) will be procured \nunder national competitive bidding procedures. All consultants will be recruited according to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on the  Use  of  Consultants (2013,  as  amended from  time to  time). The \nInformation Communication Education consultant will be recruited as a firm, using consultant \nqualification selection, since the contract is small (less than $200,000) and implemented within a \nshort  period  (12  months).  Few  firms  have  the  dedicated  expertise  to  assist  SAWACO  in \npromoting its energy efficiency policy and building awareness and capacity of SAWACO staff \nand management.  \n \n21.  The PMU will prioritize disbursement to suppliers and consultants using direct payment \nprocedures. A project imprest account will be set up upon grant effectiveness to facilitate project \nimplementation and the flow of funds. The account will be exclusively used to finance ADB's \nshare  of  eligible  expenditures.  It  will  be  established  and  administered  by  the  PMU  under \nSAWACO.  \n \n                                                \n12  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \n22.  The grant investment project will be implemented parallel to tranche 1 (footnote 6). All \nthe fiduciary requirements from the tranche 1 will also apply to the grant investment project. The \nPMU will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and services \nfinanced from the proceeds of the grant, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for \nthe grant, and use of local funds. Within 6 months of the close of each year, the PMU will submit \naudited annual grant accounts, which provide a detailed description of the source of funds and \nexpenditures made, and submit SAWACO's audited annual consolidated financial statements to \nADB. An auditor acceptable to ADB will audit the annual project accounts and SAWACO's \nconsolidated financial statements. The auditor\u2019s terms of reference will be approved by ADB \nbefore commencement of work. The annual audit, financed under the tranche 1 (footnote 6) of \nthe investment program (footnote 8), will include an audit opinion on the project imprest account \nand statement of expenditures of the project. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n23.  Project preparation was completed in September 2010, including an energy audit of \nSAWACO, that led to the request for grant funding. The request for the ACEF to fund the energy \nefficiency grant was thoroughly reviewed both by ADB and the donor, the Government of Japan. \n \nA.  Technical \n24.  The  proposed  investment  will  be  for  energy  saving  equipment  that  will  reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions and the carbon and water footprints of SAWACO. This will result in \n(i) direct savings of $500,000 per year on electricity cost and 7,500 tons CO  reduction, and (ii) \n2\nindirect savings of $1.3 million per year and 18,889 tons CO  reduction. \n2\n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The investment has a payback period of less than 5 years. Incremental cost calculations \nare included in supplementary appendix. Economic and financial analysis were also completed \nunder the tranche 1 (footnote 6) and disclosed on the ADB website. \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  The grant will be implemented parallel to the tranche 1 (footnote 6) by the same PMU \nimplementing Tranche 1 (footnote 6). All the fiduciary requirements from this project will also \napply to the grant.  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  SAWACO.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The  energy  savings  will  reduce  pressure  to  increase  tariffs.  The  Information \nCommunication Education component aims for 50% of the trainees to be women. The project is \nclassified as having some gender benefits. \n \n29.  HCMC\u2019s overall poverty rate of 12% disguises poverty rates of more than 50% in some \nwards and districts. The urban poor are both long-term residents and migrant households. \nSurveys show a low incidence of waterborne disease. Satisfaction with SAWACO\u2019s service is \n ", "7 \ngood overall, despite some dissatisfaction because of poor water quality. Among households \nconnected to piped water, 84% have individual connections, 12% shared connections with their \nown meter, and 4% shared connections with a shared meter. Many households buy water from \ntankers  and  pay  almost  twice  the  official  water  tariff  of  D4,000\u2013D10,000  per  cubic  meter. \nAlthough policy dictates free connections, the tertiary distribution network is obviously lacking \nand will be extended under the program by the component that rehabilitates and replaces pipes. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  The project is classified C for environment (positive impact), involuntary resettlement, \nand indigenous peoples. \n \n31.  Due  diligence  confirmed  that  the  project  will  not  entail  any  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts, since the equipment will be installed within the boundary of the water \nproduction plant and that there are no indigenous peoples living in the project area in HCMC. \n \n32.  The project has a positive impact on the environment. Viet Nam is a signatory to the \nMontreal  Protocol,  therefore  not  only  will  the  executing  agency  make  sure  it  follows  the \ngovernment\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  on  environmental  impact  assessments  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  but  it  will  also  abide  by  laws  that  implement  the \ngovernment\u2019s  obligations  under  international  law.  Specifically,  on  the  project's  proposed \ninvestment  for  air-conditioning  systems,  and  as  provided  for  in  para.  33  of  Safeguard \nRequirements 1 of the Safeguard Policy Statement, such systems to be installed should not use \nchemicals classified as ozone-depleting substances and which are scheduled for phase-out \nunder  the  Montreal  Protocol13 on  Substances  that  Deplete  the  Ozone  Layer,  such  as \nchlorofluorocarbons;  halons;  1,1,1-trichloroethane  (methyl  chloroform);  carbon  tetrachloride; \nhydro chlorofluorocarbons; hydro bromofluorocarbons; and methyl bromide. This includes the \nProhibited Investment Activity List, as item (ii) of the list highlights the ban on the use of ozone-\ndepleting substances being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. If there is any discrepancy \nbetween the government\u2019s laws and regulations and those of ADB, the ADB policy will apply. \nThe procurement of the chemical for installation of the air-conditioning unit will be reported in \nthe project progress report and in the project completion report. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  The major risk is delay in project implementation. SAWACO is already implementing \nWorld Bank and ADB-financed projects. The PMU staff has been trained in ADB procurement \nand  disbursement  guidelines.  SAWACO  has  already  initiated  some  investments  in  energy \nefficiency with its own funds. Other risks include (i) lack of enforcement of Government policies, \nresulting in unsustainable operations for SAWACO, mitigated through the implementation of \ncapacity development technical assistance (footnote 5); and (ii) political interference preventing \nsuccessful implementation and financial sustainability, especially on provision of counterpart \nfunding and water tariff increase. HCMC Peoples\u2019 Committee has provided strong support for \nSAWACO under Tranche 1 (footnote 6), including water tariff increases over 70% between 2009 \nand 2013. Ministry of Finance issued a joint-circular on calculating water tariff. There are no \nmajor risk and mitigation measures to be implemented as part of this project. A risk assessment \nand risk management plan is included.14 \n \n                                                \n13 http://ozone.unep.org/Publications/MP_Handbook/MP-Handbook-2012.pdf \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n34.  The government and SAWACO have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards (including government\u2019s undertaking under the Montreal Protocol on \nSubstances that Deplete the Ozone Layer), gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement, as described in detail in the project administration manual and grant documents. \n \n35.  The government and SAWACO agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the grant agreement and project agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.
