Prudent macroeconomic management enabled Indonesia to \nweather the global financial crisis in 2008 as well as the sharp global commodities downturn in \n2015,  while  achieving  an  annual  average  economic  growth  rate  of  5%  over  the  last  decade. \nIndonesia  has  achieved  measurable  improvements  in  reducing  poverty.  National  poverty \nincidence fell from 11% of the total population in 2014 to 9.4% in 2019. However, about 20.8% of \nthe total population (56 million people) are clustered marginally above the national poverty line. \nWith the country\u2019s output already close to its potential, any further increase in economic growth \nwill require structural economic transformation.  \n \ninclusive  growth. \n4. \nIndonesia\u2019s  infrastructure  and  infrastructure  services  are  inadequate  to  support  a  modern, \ncompetitive middle-income economy and provide basic services to its people.1 Poor infrastructure \nconstrains  connectivity  in  Indonesia\u2019s  archipelagic  geography.  Indonesia\u2019s  roads,  ports,  and \nairports  are  heavily  congested.  Logistics  costs  are  high  by  middle-income  country  standards, \naffecting \nIndonesia\u2019s \ncompetitiveness. In the 2018 Global Competitiveness Index, Indonesia ranked 45th out of 140 \ncountries,  but  ranked  75th  on the  quality  of  roads  and  87th  on  utility  infrastructure.2  Estimates \nindicate  that  a  1%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  equivalent  of  permanent  increase  in \ninfrastructure investment in Indonesia would lead to a 2% increase in GDP in the medium and \nlonger term.3 \n \nInfrastructure  development  a  key  government  priority.  The  government  has \n5. \nundertaken important institutional and regulatory reforms to facilitate infrastructure development. \nIn 2010, with the support of ADB and the World Bank, the government established IIF, SMI, and \nPT  Penjaminan  Infrastruktur  Indonesia  (Persero),  who  have  emerged  as  major  players  in  the \ninfrastructure landscape of Indonesia by providing debt financing, equity, guarantee as well as \nadvisory services.4 In 2014, the government established the Committee for Acceleration of Priority \nInfrastructure  Delivery  to  address  coordination  problems  leading  to  delays  in  rolling  out \n\nis  a  drag  on \n\ninfrastructure \n\ninvestment. \n\nInadequate \n\ntrade  and \n\n \n\n1   H.

The  Global  Competitiveness  Report  2018.  http://reports.weforum.org/global-\n\ncompetitiveness-report-2018/. \n\n3   International Monetary Fund. 2018. Article IV Staff Report. Washington, DC. \n4  PT  Sarana  Multi  Infrastruktur  (Persero)  is  a  state-owned  enterprise  that  provides  infrastructure  project  finance, \nadvisory  services  and  project  development  support.  PT  Penjaminan  Infrastruktur  Indonesia  (Persero)  is  a  state-\nowned enterprise that provides government guarantees for infrastructure projects. \n\n \n\n \n\n\finfrastructure  projects.  In  2017,  the  government  established  the  Non-Government  Budget \nInvestment Financing Initiative at the Ministry of National Development Planning (BAPPENAS) to \npromote private and other non-budget investment in selected projects.5 The government plans to \nspend $450 billion in infrastructure development under the medium-term development plan, 2020-\n2024.6  \n \nLeveraging  private  investment  essential  for  closing  the  financing  gap.  While \n6. \ncontinued improvements in public revenue and expenditure management will help create fiscal \nspace  for  infrastructure  and  other  priority  development  spending,  increasing  private  sector \nparticipation will be essential for delivering the infrastructure development plan while reducing the \nfiscal burden. In 2017, the annual infrastructure expenditure of about $30 billion was dwarfed by \nannual investment needs of more than $70 billion before adjusting for climate change.7 Moreover, \nprivate  sector  investments  have  the  potential  to  enhance  the  quality  of  infrastructure  through \nimproved efficiency as well as knowledge and technology transfer.  \n \nLimited sources of long-term finance and project facilitation services. 8 With assets \n7. \nof about 117% of GDP, of which 74% are concentrated in the banking sector, Indonesia\u2019s financial \nsector is small compared to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations comparators such as the \nPhilippines (193%), Viet Nam (215%), Thailand (359%) and Malaysia (385%). Project financing \nand more innovative structured products remain nascent. Legal lending limits applicable to single \nborrowers and borrower groups, and Basel III norms and asset-liability mismatch issues limit the \nscope  of  commercial  banks\u2019  financing  of  infrastructure.  With  equity  and  local  currency  bond \nmarkets valued at approximately 51% and 19% respectively of GDP, Indonesia\u2019s capital market \nstruggles  to  provide  the  long-term  debt  and  equity  financing  needed  to  support  government\u2019s \nambitious  infrastructure  agenda.  Unlike  banks,  institutional  investors  such  as  life  insurance \ncompanies  and  pension  funds  are  well  suited  to  channel  capital  into  infrastructure  projects, \nbecause of the match between the long-term liabilities of such investors and the long-term nature \nof  infrastructure  investments.  However,  the  institutional  investor  base  is  still  relatively  small  in \nIndonesia, accounting for around 13% of GDP, and such investors tend to take a conservative \nand short-term approach to investments. Moreover, outside of liquid asset classes such as public \nequity and government bonds, participation of international institutional investors is limited due to \nthe lack of a market for currency and interest rate hedging instruments. \n \n8. \nIIF can catalyze private sector participation. IIF was established by the Government of \nIndonesia  and  development  partners  including  ADB  to  provide  financing  solutions  and \ninstruments that  are  otherwise  unavailable  in  the market.9 In  April  2019, PT  Pemeringkat  Efek \nIndonesia (PEFINDO), a national credit rating agency, maintained its national long-term rating of \nIIF\u2019s bonds at AAA with a stable outlook based on IIF's strategic importance, public sector and \nsupranational ownership structure, and tight monitoring by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).10 IIF \nbonds  are  mostly  held  by  institutional  investors  (e.g.,  pension  funds,  mutual  funds,  and \ninsurance), which help channel long-term funds to infrastructure projects. IIF has an expanding \n\n \n\n5   These include 19 toll roads, 4 airports, 10 power projects, and one tourism project with a total value of $25.8 million. \n\nPINA (Center for Private Investment). http://pina.bappenas.go.id/. \n\n6   Government of Indonesia. 2019.

IIF partners with other banks and financial institutions through a syndication approach as \nprescribed  by  its  investment  limits.  As  of  2018,  IIF  leveraged  Rp137  trillion  of  infrastructure \ninvestment  from  the  domestic  market  through  loan  syndication  and  bonds  issuance.  When  IIF \nplays  the  role  of  lead  bank  in  the  lending  syndicate  given  its  project  structuring  expertise,  its \nparticipation adds an element of comfort to cofinanciers. In cases where IIF is not the lead bank, \nit undertakes an independent due diligence of the underlying risk and lenders agree on a common \nterm sheet. Where IIF provides mezzanine or equity investments, it takes the riskier leg of the \nfinancing equation, thereby catalyzing senior bank debt. The MOF has expanded IIF\u2019s investment \nmandate to include social infrastructure such as health and education. To support IIF's expansion \nin response to the growing infrastructure finance market, the government obtained $200 million \nin  additional  financing  from  the  World  Bank  and  requested  a  new  $100  million  financial \nintermediation loan from ADB. \n \n9. \nPrevious  ADB  assistance.  Since  2006,  ADB  has  continuously  supported  the \ndevelopment of the infrastructure finance market in Indonesia through policy-based loans, grants, \nand technical assistance. To help set up IIF, in 2009 ADB approved (i) a financial intermediation \nloan  of  $100  million  to  Indonesia,  and  (ii)  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  $40  million  (rupiah \nequivalent) in IIF\u2019s capital.11 ADB holds 19.99% of equity and has a representation in IIF\u2019s board \nof commissioners.12 The loan partially financed eight subprojects with an aggregate investment \ncost of $1.3 billion, implying a loan multiplier effect of 12.7 times. The ADB loan was rated highly \nrelevant  and  effective  in  achieving  outcomes,  efficient  both  in  terms  of  utilizing  the  inputs  to \nachieve the desired outcome and in terms of supporting the establishment of efficient processes \nand  arrangements  in  IIF,  and  likely  sustainable.13  The  project  was  assessed  as  being  overall \nsuccessful.14 \n \n10. \nLessons.  The  proposed  project  incorporates  lessons  from  previous  engagements  with \nIIF,  which  include:  (i)  subproject  eligibility  criteria,  focusing  on  long-term  debt  and  excluding \nsubprojects  with  adverse  environmental  or  social  impacts;  (ii)  complementary  technical \nassistance  to  strengthen  IIF  and  SMI  capacity  in  areas  such  as  safeguards  and  credit \nenhancement products; (iii) submission of financial statements following ADB requirements; and, \n(iv)  adequate  coordination  mechanisms  between  MOF,  BAPPENAS,  IIF,  SMI,  and  ADB  to \nproactively  discuss  project  issues.  The  project  also  draws  on  lessons  from  similar  financial \nintermediary loans, e.g., the ADB loan to the India Infrastructure Finance Company.15 The lessons \nhave  been  included  in  the  project  design,  which  include  quarterly  progress  monitoring, \n\n \n\n11 ADB.  2009.

Manila.  \n12 The conflict of interest that ADB\u2019s status as a shareholder and lender could give rise to is deemed manageable. ADB \ndoes not lend directly to IIF, although ADB and IIF will be parties to the same project agreement. ADB or its nominee \non the IIF\u2019s board of commissioners will comply with all applicable Indonesian law requirements in relation to conflict \nof interest. The current practice of ADB and its nominee in IIF is to abstain from decisions that include transactions \ninvolving ADB.  \n\n13 ADB. 2017.

Lessons include strong partnership with stakeholders and providing capacity building \nsupport.    \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\festablishment of subproject eligibility criteria, submission of audited project financial statements \nin a timely and acceptable manner, and coordination with development partners.  \n \n11.  Modality. Building on the experience of the previous ADB assistance (footnote 11), the \nfinancial intermediation loan modality is best suited for the project as it will ensure financing of \ninfrastructure projects through market-based allocation mechanisms as well as help strengthen \nthe capacity of participating financial intermediaries. IIF is a financially sound institution and meets \nADB\u2019s policy requirements for financial intermediation loans.16 As reported by the national credit \nrating agencies, IIF has a superior capacity to meet its long-term financial commitments relative \nto that of other Indonesian obligors.17  \n \n12. \nCoordination  with  development  partners.  ADB,  jointly  with  bilateral  and  other \nmultilateral  development  financing  institutions,  played  a  critical  role  in  the  establishment  and \noperation of IIF as an innovative financing mechanism to support infrastructure development in \nIndonesia.  ADB  coordinates  with  IIF\u2019s  other  shareholders  (SMI,  International  Finance \nCorporation,  Deutsche  Investitions-  und  Entwicklungsgesellschaft  mbH,  and  Sumitomo  Mitsui \nBanking  Corporation)  and  the  World  Bank (as  lender to  IIF)  to maximize  complementarity  and \nsynergy in the respective support provided to IIF. \n \n13. \nAlignment with ADB Strategy 2030 and country strategy. ADB\u2019s sovereign financing \nwill help address a key constraint posed by the lack of long-term funding sources and enable IIF \nto  crowd-in  private  investments  in  infrastructure,  while  easing  the  fiscal  burden.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  ADB  Strategy  2030  priorities  on  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \ninequality through the creation of quality infrastructure.18 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy  for  Indonesia,  2016\u22122019  as  well  as  the  forthcoming  country  partnership \nstrategy  (2020\u22122024),  which  will  focus  on  the  acceleration  of  Indonesia\u2019s  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  promotion  of  private  sector  participation.19  It  complements  ongoing  ADB \nactivities  in  support  of  Indonesia\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  preparation  and  implementation  of \ninfrastructure  projects,  and  will  link  with  both  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  infrastructure \ndevelopment operations in Indonesia.20 \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  availability  of  quality  infrastructure \nincreased.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  private  investment  in  infrastructure \ncatalyzed.21 \n \n15. \nfor \ninfrastructure projects increased.

The ADB loan will be \nrelent by the MOF to SMI and then onlent to IIF to finance infrastructure projects. IIF will lend to \nsubprojects  at  commercial  terms  following  IIF\u2019s  operations  manual  and  ADB\u2019s  subproject  and \nsubborrower  selection  criteria.  Lending  to  additional  infrastructure  projects  would  offer  IIF  a \nplatform to expand its project facilitation services and products such as transaction advisory and \ncredit enhancement.   \n \nC. \n \n16. \nBuilding on the experience of the first ADB loan for IIF, the project will seek to add value \nby strengthening Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure finance market and boosting the capacity of two key \ninstitutional actors in the infrastructure financing landscape (SMI and IIF). ADB loan will help IIF \nexpand its lending operations and its ability to offer longer tenors on its loans, which in turn will fill \na  critical  market  gap  for  infrastructure  financing.  An  improvement  from  the  previous  ADB  loan \nincludes the establishment of clearer subproject selection criteria to enable expansion of quality \ninfrastructure projects.22 ADB technical assistance will support IIF with the planned expansion of \ncredit enhancement products, undertaking financial and economic assessments of subprojects, \nand social and environment safeguards.23 ADB\u2019s financial support for the proposed project and \napplication  of  IIF\u2019s  overall  product  lines  and  exposure  limits  are  anticipated  to  generate  the \nfinancial close of $1,536 million in terms of project costs. This means that every dollar of the ADB \nloan would leverage about $14.36 from the market. \n \nD. \n \nThe  IIF  has  identified  12  potential  infrastructure  subprojects  in  the  following  sectors: \n17. \ntransportation, water, energy, telecommunication,  and health.24 The indicative list of subprojects \nwill  be  evaluated  and  screened  based  on IIF\u2019s  operations  manual  and  the  project\u2019s  subproject \nand subborrower selection criteria. The total investment for the subprojects is estimated at $1,536 \nmillion. ADB will finance $100 million of the estimated total investment. IIF is expected to mobilize \n$1,436 million from the domestic market through loan syndication and bond issuance.25 Table 1 \nsummarizes ADB\u2019s financing plan during the investment period. \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan) \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank. \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n \n100.0 \n100.0 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n \n100.0 \n100.0 \n\n \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \n18. \nresources to help finance the project.

The eligibility requirement for subprojects are as follows:27 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\neach qualified subproject is financially viable (i.e., financial rate of return is higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital);  \neach qualified subproject has environmental and social safeguard category B or \ncategory C under the environmental and social management system (ESMS); any \nqualified subproject with category A based on IIF\u2019s screening procedures for any \nof the safeguards will be excluded from financing;  \nfor qualified subprojects with likely category B impact, (a) ESMS is used to screen \nand categorize the potential impact; (b) relevant safeguard plans are prepared and \ndisclosed;  and  (c)  the  qualified  enterprise  commits  to  periodic  monitoring  and \nreview of such qualified subprojects and takes corrective actions as necessary;28 \nand,  \n\n \n\n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Qualified subproject refers to a subproject that satisfies the subproject eligibility criteria. IIF will ensure that subproject \n\napproval procedure detailed in the project administration manual (footnote 25) will be followed.   \n\n28 Qualified enterprise refers to an enterprise that satisfies the subborrower eligibility criteria.   \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\neach  qualified  subproject  is  screened  in  accordance  with  IIF\u2019s  operational \nguidelines and screening procedures for legal, financial, and integrity risks, among \nothers. \n\n \nSubproject  screening.  IIF  has  a  robust  and  well-established  subproject  screening \n22. \nmechanism. Due diligence covers legal, financial (e.g., sponsor financial performance and debt \nservice capacity), environmental, and social aspects, with special attention on risk assessment \nfocusing on commercial, reputational, regulatory and legal, compliance, macroeconomic, political, \ninsurance,  and  severity  of  audit-finding  risks.  Based  on  the  feasibility  and  risk  analyses,  an \nassessment is conducted on whether any form of guarantee or collateral is needed to raise the \nsubproject\u2019s bankability. Site visits are conducted to verify the preliminary data and information \nreceived  from  the  potential  borrower.  IIF  will  ensure  that  subprojects  follow  the  approval \nprocedure detailed in the project administration manual (footnote 26). \n\n \n\n23. \nfollows:  \n\nSubborrower  eligibility  criteria.  The  eligibility  requirement  for  subborrowers  are  as \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nan incorporated entity engaged in infrastructure development with demonstrated \ncompetence to undertake the qualified subproject;  \na  financially  viable  institution  as  demonstrated by,  among  others,  its  capacity to \nrepay the subloan and, where applicable, an average debt coverage ratio higher \nthan 1.1 times as determined in accordance with IIF\u2019s operations manual;  \nnot a related party of IIF or its senior management unless it is in accordance with \nIIF\u2019s related party transaction policy; and  \neligible  under  IIF\u2019s  operational  guidelines  and  screening  procedures,  including \nknow your customer requirements.  \n\n \n24.  Maximum subloan size. IIF can finance up to 40% of total project cost for direct lending \nfor subprojects above Rp3 trillion, 50% for subprojects above Rp500 billion to Rp3 trillion, or 80% \nfor subprojects below or equal to Rp500 billion. ADB will not stipulate any additional limitations on \nsubloan size. \n \n25. \nProcurement. All goods and works to be financed under the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance  with the  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended from time to time)29  as \napplicable  to  a  financial  intermediary  loan,  and  detailed  arrangement  agreed  between  the \ngovernment and ADB. The ADB Procurement Guidelines relating to financial intermediary states \nthat where the financing provides funds to an intermediary institution, such as this project, to be \nonlent to beneficiaries such as private sector enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises, \nor autonomous commercial enterprises in the public sector for the partial financing of subprojects, \nthe  procurement  is  usually  undertaken  by  the  respective  beneficiaries  in  accordance  with \nestablished private sector or commercial practices that are acceptable to ADB. IIF will follow its \noperations  manual  and  procurement  manual  (2011)  on  the  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and \nservices, which ADB assessed in September 2018 to be acceptable private sector practice. IIF \nwill also cause the subborrower to ensure that goods, works, and services to be financed under \nthe  project  be  produced  in  and  supplied  from  ADB  member  countries  with  due  attention  to \neligibility  requirements  for  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders. \n \n\n29 ADB. 2015.

IIF will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections, collecting \n26. \nsupporting  documents,  preparing  withdrawal  applications,  and  submitting  the  withdrawal \napplications  to  ADB  (through  SMI)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Financial  due  diligence  undertaken  during  project \npreparation determined that both SMI and IIF have significant financial management experience \nand capacity and will be able to ensure effective and appropriate project financial management, \nincluding to administer advance account and statement of expenditure procedures.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nSustainability \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \nA. \n \nThe ADB loan is expected to catalyze investment of $1,436 million to finance about 14 \n27. \nsubprojects  in  sectors  such  as  transportation,  water,  energy,  telecommunication,  health,  and \neducation. The 2009 ADB loan (footnote 11) financed eight subprojects with positive economic \nimpact.30 The subprojects contributed to the much-needed expansion of the telecommunication \ntower network throughout the archipelago. For example, one subproject enabled the borrower to \nacquire  3,500  operating  telecommunication  towers,  making  it  Indonesia\u2019s  third-biggest  tower \ncompany. The power generation subprojects have contributed to raising the population\u2019s access \nto electricity through the construction of new gas pipelines and provision of additional gas-based \nelectricity capacity.  \n \nB. \n \nThe 2009 ADB financial intermediation loan of $100 million to Indonesia, which was relent \n28. \nto  SMI  and  then  onlent  to  IIF,  was  rated  likely  sustainable  (footnotes 13  and  14).  The  project \ncompletion report highlighted that since its establishment, IIF has become a credible\u2014though still \nsmall\u2014player  in  the  domestic  infrastructure  finance  market  because  of  its  focus  on  project \nfinance,  robust  risk  management  framework,  expertise  in  social  and  environment  safeguards \nmanagement, and ability to provide long-term debt to infrastructure projects. More importantly, IIF \nhas  proven  its  ability  to  raise  (i)  medium-  and  long-term  rupiah  funding  domestically,  and  (ii) \nmedium-term funding from international lenders. IIF has also benefited from the capacity building \nsupport provided by its shareholders. For instance, the World Bank has been supporting IIF on \nsafeguards. Furthermore, IIF has benefited from its shareholder structure in terms of organization \nstructure, processes, and arrangements, as well as the quality of its operational policies.  \n \nIIF and SMI are regulated by the Ministry of Finance Regulation no.100/PMK.010/2009 on \n29. \nInfrastructure Financial Institutions, which also requires IIF to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio not \nexceeding 10 to 1. Indonesia\u2019s Financial Services Authority (OJK) supervision team monitors IIF\u2019s \ncompliance  with  the MOF regulation.  Under the project, IIF  will  maintain the following  financial \nratios during its financial year and for each financial quarter following the borrower\u2019s applicable \nlaws and regulations and IIF\u2019s accounting practices: (i) capital adequacy ratio of 12%, which is \ncalculated as a percentage of IIF\u2019s total capital to its total risk-weighted assets, each as defined \nin IIF\u2019s operations manual; (ii) total long-term debt to total equity ratio of 10:1; and (iii) current ratio \nof 1.0 where the current ratio is calculated as current assets of IIF divided by its current liabilities. \nShould IIF fail to maintain any of the financial ratios, IIF and ADB will agree on an action plan \nwithin 90 days from the date of submission to ADB of the earlier of (i) the annual audited financial \n\n30 Economic  internal  rates  of  return  on  private  sector  infrastructure  investments  are  difficult  to  quantify  because \nprevailing  private  sector  practices  on  due diligence  do  not include  estimates  of  economic  returns of  subprojects. \nProject pre-feasibility studies often include a cost\u2212benefit analysis.  \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nreport, or (ii) the quarterly risk management report, which evidences the noncompliance, for IIF \nto implement measures to address its financial performance and maintain such ratios. Upon the \ndate of agreement, IIF will start implementing the action plan and complete implementation within \nthe timeline set out in the action plan. \n \n30. \n In 2018, IIF\u2019s risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio was 35.1%, which is projected to be \ngradually reduced to 25.6% by 2023. The capital adequacy ratio of Indonesia\u2019s banking industry \naveraged 20% in the last five years. IIF\u2019s current ratio in 2018 was 1.27 times, which is projected \nto  be  1.1  times  by  2023.  In  2018,  long-term  debt  to  total  equity  ratio  stood  at  3.15,  which  is \nexpected  to  be  4.0  in  2023.  In  2017  and  2018,  IIF  recorded  a  net  loss  of  Rp81.62  billion  and \nRp42.95 billion, respectively, breaking with profitability trend of prior years. The loss in 2018 is \ndue  to  early  repayment  fee  for  two  loans  and  loss  on  interest  rate  hedge.  The  2017  loss  was \npartially attributable to unrealized loss stemming from change in fair value of equity investment. \nIIF projects to gain profit in 2019 on the back of growth in loan commitments and disbursements \nin 2018. The projection of return to profit is supported by the 2019 first quarter data in which IIF \nrecorded profit.  \n \nC. \n \n31. \nFinancial management. IIF complies with all prudential regulations and lender\u2019s financial \ncovenants as disclosed in its annual audited financial statements, and has adequate credit and \nrisk  management  policies,  operating  systems,  and  procedures  to  administer  the  proposed \nproject.31 IIF has adopted a two-tier decision-making oversight system with its board of directors \nand  board  of  commissioners.  IIF  conducts  operations  in  accordance  with  a  comprehensive \noperations manual that was initially designed with support of the World Bank and ADB and then \napproved by IIF shareholders.32  IIF is relatively conservative in its investment decisions and has \na  tight  and  strict  lending  policy  that  has  been  implemented  since  its  inception,  adopting \ninternational  best  practices  from  its  shareholders\u2019  policies.  IIF  established  a  special  asset \nmanagement unit in 2016 to monitor and manage loans defined as problematic, including those \nnot  yet  in  default  but  have  shown  deteriorating  quality.  IIF  manages  liquidity  risk  mainly  by \nmonitoring position against limits, maintaining adequate reserve funds, and matching the maturity \nbetween financial assets and liabilities as far as practicable.  \n \n32. \nThe  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  low  mainly  because  (i)  financial \nstatements are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards and \nfollow  the  OJK  mandatory  requirements  as  a  public  listed  company  in  the  Indonesia  Stock \nExchange; (ii) the internal audit functions are guided by an operating manual, which has adequate \narrangements for a functional internal control; (iii) financial statements are audited regularly by an \nindependent  auditor  registered  with  OJK;  and  (iv)  structure,  qualifications,  and  capacity  are \nadequate. No significant integrity risks were identified in the integrity due diligence carried out on \nIIF.  \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, SMI, and IIF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 26). \n \n\n31 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Like all Indonesian limited liability companies, IIF\u2019s board of commissioners represents the shareholders, and the \n\nboard of directors is responsible for day-to-day operations. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nD. \n \n34. \nInfrastructure provides significant benefits for the poor, with a robust negative correlation \nbetween infrastructure availability and poverty in Indonesia. For example, when road quality in \nrural areas improves, household income is also seen to improve, and vice versa. Ensuring quality \nroads and public transport systems is important for women\u2019s access to jobs, markets, and other \nservices.  To  meet  global  commitments  in  line  with  the  Sustainable  Development  Goal  (SDG) \nframework on universal access to affordable, reliable, and cleaner energy services (SDG 7) and \nquality  infrastructure  to  support  economic  development  and  equitable  access  for  all  (SDG  9), \ninvestments need to be scaled up. The channels through which poor and vulnerable people will \nbenefit from the project include improved access to social and economic services associated with \ninfrastructure investment.  \n \n35. \nIIF will adopt the following gender-related design features: (i) assess internal mechanisms \nand capacities to promote greater visibility of gender and social inclusion considerations in the \ndesign  of  its  subprojects;  (ii)  ensure  that  recipient  subprojects  will  identify  and  maximize \nopportunities  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  employment  opportunities  during  construction, \noperation and maintenance of infrastructure, with potential adoption of evidence-based gender-\nrelated  targets;  (iii)  promote  adherence  to  national  core  labor  standards  and  commitments  to \ngender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment  stated  in  the  government\u2019s  legislation  and \nregulations; and (iv) assess the social and gender impact of the project and the potential use of \nidentified women-friendly technologies for greater social and gender-related elements. Potential \nsubprojects  to  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  would  promote  women\u2019s  empowerment  through \nimproved access to health services, telecommunication, electricity and transport networks. This \nwould optimize the time women are able to spend engaging in productive activities.     \n \nE. \n \nThe ADB loan will only finance category B and category C subprojects. IIF\u2019s operations \n36. \nmanual, environmental and social safeguard framework (ESSF), and social and environmental \nmanagement systems (SEMS), prepared with ADB, International Finance Corporation, and World \nBank assistance, align with the policies and guidelines of these institutions. IIF\u2019s ESSF is guided \nby eight principles: (i) social and environmental assessment and management system; (ii) labor \nand  working  conditions;  (iii) pollution  prevention  and  abatement  and  climate  change; \n(iv) community  health,  safety,  and  security;  (v)  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement; \n(vi) biodiversity  conservation  and  natural  resources  management;  (vii)  indigenous  people;  and \n(viii)  cultural  property  and  heritage.  Under  the  third  principle,  subprojects  financed  by  IIF  are \nrequired  to  address  pollution  prevention  and  management  of  impacts  arising  from  subproject \nactivities, ensure conformity with global good practices and standards, promote more sustainable \nuse of resources, and ensure that climate change issues associated with subproject activities are \nassessed, mitigated, and monitored over the life of IIF\u2019s investment.     \n \n37. \nADB\u2019s  assessment  of  the  IIF\u2019s  ESSF,  SEMS,  and  operations  manual  pointed  to \nequivalence  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  while  noting  minor  differences  in \nprocedural and administration processes.33 An ESMS for the proposed project has been prepared \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and IIF\u2019s SEMS and operations manual. The ESMS \ndescribes  the  safeguard  principles,  assessment  on  IIF\u2019s  SEMS,  operations  manual  and \nimplementation practices, identification on the gaps, and mitigation measures to be implemented \n\nSafeguards \n\n33 Financial Intermediary: Environment and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\ffor  the  subprojects.  The  ESMS  also  includes  procedures  for  screening  and  categorizing \nsubprojects  and  building  capacity  of  IIF  and  its  clients  to  manage  safeguard  monitoring  and \nreporting. \n\n \n\n \n\nIIF will screen and categorize subprojects for social and environmental safeguards using \n38. \nthe  ESMS.  IIF  will  provide  categorization  of  impacts  and  risk  to  allow  ADB  to  assess  each \nsafeguard  adequately.  Subprojects \ninvoluntary \nresettlement,  or  indigenous  people  safeguards  will  not  be  selected.  Subprojects  involving \nbusiness activities included in the prohibited investment activities list in the ESMS will not qualify \nfor ADB financing and applications involving such activities will be rejected. IIF will advise and \nprovide guidance to their clients on the types of social and environmental management plans that \nneed to be prepared, and consultation and disclosure requirements. \n\ntriggering  category  A \n\nfor  environment, \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n39. \nIIF  can  add  value  to  the  infrastructure  financing  market  by  raising  standards  based  on \ninternational good practices. However, bridging the gap between international good practice on \nsafeguards (as reflected in IIF policies) and the prevailing national practices will require continued \nefforts  on  dialogue  with  stakeholders  and  strengthening  of  capacity  through  the  project \nimplementation chain. To address these gaps and through support from its shareholders, IIF has \ntaken measures including (i) substantially boosting the capacity of the social and environmental \nsafeguard unit at IIF, (ii) training on social and environment safeguards to IIF staff and clients, \nand (iii) public disclosure of project summary and documents.34 ADB will continue to coordinate \nwith IIF\u2019s shareholders and lenders who are supporting IIF on strengthening safeguard capacity, \nincluding on environment and climate-related issues.  \n \nF. \n \n40. \nThere are no substantial risks. Moderate risks and mitigating measures are described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35  IIF will employ its risk management \nplan to address project specific risks (para. 41). Furthermore, quarterly project progress review \nmeetings,  chaired  by  BAPPENAS  (para.  20),  will  provide  oversight  and  address  risks  to \nsubproject implementation. \n \nIIF  continuously  monitors  risks  arising  from  its  operations  through  its  risk  management \n41. \ndepartment.  Quarterly  risk  management  reports  cover  the  analysis  of  (i)  the  investment  and \ntreasury portfolios\u2019 development; (ii) credit risk (including social and environment risk); (iii) market \nrisk;  (iv)  liquidity  risk;  (v)  operational  risk;  (vi)  business,  reputation,  and  legal  risks; \n(vii) macroeconomic, political, regulatory, and strategic risks; (viii) information technology risks; \nand  (ix)  the  severity  of  audit  findings,  and  insurance  and  compliance  risks.  These  reports  are \nsubmitted to the board of director\u2019s risk management committee and board of commissioner\u2019s risk \noversight committee for consideration and guidance. If developments such as rating downgrade \nof  sponsors  or  delay  in  implementation  of  safeguards  action  plan  require  proactive  mitigation \nmeasures, IIF transfers them to the special asset management unit to administer such subprojects \nuntil they return to normal status. \n \n\n \n42. \nThe government, SMI, and IIF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n34 IIF. 2019.
