Small irrigation systems are defined as systems with less than 25 hectares of irrigation \narea in the hills and mountains and less than 200 hectares in the Terai plains. The participating \ndistricts  were  selected  because  of  their  high  poverty,  food  insecurity  and  irrigation  potential. \nThey are Kanchanpur, Kailali, Dang, Kapilvastu in the Terai plains; Doti, Salyan, Rukum, Rolpa, \nPyuthan  in  the  hills;  and  Bajhang,  Jumla,  Mugu  in  the  mountains.  As  the  first  large-scale \nintervention  in  small  irrigation  development  in  Nepal,  the  project  will  demonstrate  participatory \nirrigation  planning  and  management  and  build  the  capacity  of  all  levels  of  the  government  for \nsmall-scale  irrigation  development.  Farmers  will  form  or  strengthen  existing  water  users \nassociations (WUAs) to apply for project support. The project will provide support to rehabilitate \nand  build new  surface water  irrigation  schemes  and  to  develop  groundwater  irrigation  through \nshallow  tube  wells.  It  will  also  facilitate  access  to  microfinance  support  and  provide  extension \nservices.  For  farmers  without  access  to  electricity  who  are  installing  shallow  tube  wells,  the \nproject  will  connect  them  to  the  electricity  network.  WUAs  will  in  turn  learn  to  manage  water \nmore efficiently and equitably, maintain their systems, and apply improved agricultural practices.  \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nFood security in Nepal is alarmingly low, with 49% of children under 5 years old stunted, \n25%  severely  stunted,  13%  wasted,  and  3%  severely  wasted.  The  majority  of  small  and \nmarginal  farmers  cannot  achieve  their  productivity  potential  since  they  have  unreliable  or  no \naccess to irrigation water and improved agricultural technology. Small farmers without irrigation \ninclude the disadvantaged Dalit, Janajati and Muslim populations who live and cultivate rain-fed \nland in peripheral water-scarce areas on steep slopes away from fertile and water-rich valleys in \nthe hills and on the fringes of irrigation systems in the plains. Irrigation is key to increasing the \nproduction  of  staple  crops  to  meet  the  growing  gap  between  agricultural  production  and  the \nneeds  of  the  expanding  population  and  to  diversifying  and  intensifying  agriculture  to  increase \non-farm  incomes,  reduce  rural  poverty,  and  increase  food  security.  Irrigation  therefore  has  a \ncritical role to play in Nepal\u201es poverty reduction and food security strategies. For individuals and \nhouseholds,  access  to  irrigation  reduces  the  severity  of  rural  poverty  by  increasing  (i)  food \nproduction, (ii) on-farm employment, and (iii) incomes.   \n \n4. \nThe project is in Nepal's confirmed project pipeline for  Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nassistance  and  addresses  the  three  pillars  of  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy,  2010\u20132012:  \n(i)  broad-based  and  inclusive  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social  development,  and  \n(iii) governance and capacity building. It builds on lessons learned from past assistance in the \nagriculture  and  natural  resources  sector 2  and  complements  the  interventions  of  other \ndevelopment  partners. 3  The  project  supports  the  multisector  approach  advocated  in  ADB's \n\n                                                \n1  A project preparatory technical assistance grant of $700,000 was provided.  \n2  See Summary Sector Assessment (Appendix 2). \n3  See Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n\n\f2 \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOperational Plan for Sustainable Food Security, as it aims to improve water productivity, access \nto  microfinance,  and  the  application  of  improved  agricultural  practices. 4  The  project's \ninterventions  will  be  underpinned  by  associated  capacity  building  at  district  and  community \nlevels.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  The  expected  impact  of  the \nproject  will  be  to  increase  the  agricultural  income of  the rural  poor  and socially  disadvantaged \ngroups  in  Nepal.5 The  project  will  contribute  to  Nepal's  goal  of  increasing  agriculture  GDP  per \ncapita and the area under irrigation.  \n \nThe  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  that  the  poor,  women,  and  other  disadvantaged \n6. \nfarmers  in  target  communities  will  intensify  and  diversify  agricultural  practices  toward  higher-\nvalue  crops.  With  efficient  utilization,  more  reliable  and  available  irrigation  water,  acquired \nirrigated  agricultural  skills,  and  better  access  to  production  inputs,  crop  yields  are  expected  to \nincrease by at least 15% in the subprojects within 5 years of construction. The project will add \n17,000  ha  (4,000  ha  in  hills  and  mountains,  and  13,000  ha  in  the  Terai)  of  improved  or  new \nirrigated area. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nTo  achieve  its  expected  outcome,  the  project  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  WUAs  will \nefficiently manage improved irrigation infrastructure; (ii) participating farmers will apply improved \nagriculture practices and have access to microfinance; and (iii) government capacity to plan and \ncoordinate small-scale irrigation projects will be enhanced. \n \n8. \nImproved irrigation infrastructure. The project will respond to requests from WUAs to \nimprove  or  provide  new  small-scale  irrigation  infrastructure.  This  may  include  (i)  the \nrehabilitation and extension of existing farmer-managed or new surface water irrigation systems,  \n(ii) pond or tank systems with reticulated pipe conveyance and distribution systems, (iii) pumped \n(or \u201clift\u201d) irrigation systems, and (iv) shallow tube wells.  The project aims to improve water use \nefficiency  and  productivity  within  customary  water  withdrawal  practices  through  improved \nconveyance  and  use  of  micro-irrigation  and  water  conservation  technologies.  The  project  will \nstrengthen WUAs  so  they  represent  all  stakeholders  within  the  command  area.  It  will  improve \ntheir ability to manage their irrigation systems and cope with socioeconomic changes. WUAs will \nbe  helped  to  prepare  water  management  plans  to  ensure  equitable,  adequate,  and  efficient \ndistribution of irrigation water.  \n \n9. \nImproved agriculture practices and access to microfinance. Support will be provided \nto improve farmers' access to inputs and markets, and to enhance their production skills so they \ncan increase their cropping intensity and yields. The project will facilitate access to microcredit \nfor  agricultural \ninfrastructure  operation  and \nmaintenance by enabling local microfinance organizations to offer savings and credit services in \nsubproject  areas.  Supplementary  capacity  development  will  be  targeted  at  disadvantaged \ngroups  to  enable  their  effective  participation.  The  project  will  also  strengthen  links  with  other \nprograms relevant for their needs. \n\nirrigation  equipment,  and \n\nirrigation \n\ninputs, \n\n                                                \n4 ADB. 2009.

Manila.  \n5 This  is  one  of  the  outcomes  in  the  Nepal  country  partnership  strategy,  2010\u20132012  for  the  agriculture  and  natural \n\nresources sector.  \n\n \n\n\f \n10. \nGovernment  capacity  building.  Although  the  executing  agency  is  experienced  in \nmanaging  rural  roads  and  other  local  infrastructure  projects,  and  has  strong  oversight  and \nworking  relationships  with  district  development  committees  (DDCs)  and  their  district  technical \noffices  (DTOs),  both  the  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural \nRoads  (DOLIDAR)  and  the  DDCs  will  be  managing  small  irrigation  services  on  a  large-scale \nbasis for the first time. Capacity development will therefore be a major thrust of the project.6 The \nDTOs  will  acquire  new  and  upgraded  skills  in  small-scale  irrigation  design  and  project \nimplementation,  and  DDCs  and  community  leaders  will  learn  how  to  plan  and  manage \nsubproject selection and implementation effectively and transparently and to target activities at \nthe poor, women, and the disadvantaged. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nTable 1. \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $36.8  million.

Project staff will then work with the leaders of the selected ilaka \nto  identify  potential  subprojects  based  on  agreed  selection  criteria.7 The  subproject  selection \nand implementation process is described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).8 \n \n14. \nThe  Ministry  of  Local  Development  (MLD)  through  DOLIDAR  will  be  the  executing \nagency for the project. The DDCs and the Rural Microfinance Development Center (RMDC) will \nbe  the  implementing  agencies.  DOLIDAR  will  establish  a  project  coordination  unit  (PCU). \nIrrigation  engineers  will  be  engaged  to  enable  the  DTOs  to  serve  as  public  engineers  and  to \nhead the DTO units for Irrigation and Other Infrastructure. For consulting services, one package \nwill be required of a joint venture between a nongovernment organization(s) and an engineering \nfirm(s).  The  consulting  joint  venture  will  assist  the  PCU  at  the  central  level  in  monitoring \nprogress and providing and overseeing preparatory and implementation technical assistance. It \nwill  also  provide  implementation  technical  assistance  at  the  district  and  community  levels.  In \naddition, two consultants will be engaged as individuals. DDCs and their DTOs and the district \nagriculture  development  offices  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  implementation  in  their \nrespective  districts.  Civil  works  will  be  procured  through  a  combination  of  community \nprocurement (through WUAs), shopping, and national competitive bidding. All procurement will \nbe carried out in accordance with ADB\u201fs Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB\u201fs  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n15. \nthe PAM.9 \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n16.  Many  farmer-managed  surface  irrigation  systems  suffer  from  low  yields  because  of \nfragile diversion structures made of earth, logs, or brushwood and frequently washed away by \nfloods  and  rudimentary  distribution  systems  leading  to  an  unreliable  water  supply,  and  high \ndistribution loss and operation and maintenance costs. The project will support the participatory \ndetailed design and construction of infrastructure, including diversion structures, cross-drainage \nworks, improved and extended canal systems, and flood protection facilities to be operated by \nthe  WUA.  It  will  not  use  complex  structures  requiring  expensive  materials  as  repairs  may  be \nbeyond  the  means  of  the  community,  making  such  structures  unsustainable.  Even  if  they  are \nwell  designed,  complex  structures  may  fail  because  of  poor  construction  quality,  landslides, \nearth tremors, or unusual floods. In contrast, structures built from local materials, although they \nmay regularly suffer damage and require significant labor inputs for maintenance, can generally \nbe  repaired  by  communities  themselves.  The  relative  merits  and  ease  of  maintenance  of \nstructures will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For groundwater irrigation, technology that \nhas proven to be successful in the Terai will be used. The project will ensure that the WUAs are \ninformed  about  the  appropriate  technology  for  installing  shallow  tube  wells  and  that  they  are \n\n                                                \n7  The subproject selection criteria may be found in Annex 2 of the PAM (Appendix 2). \n8  See Annex 1 of the PAM. \n9  PAM (Appendix 2).  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fable to operate and maintain the pumps.

Quantified  benefits  were  assessed  by  comparing  future  \u201cwithout  project\u201d \nproduction  with  the  production  expected  after  the  introduction  of  a  new or  improved  and more \nreliable  irrigation  water  supply,  the  \u201cwith  project\u201d  case.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) for the three sample surface water subprojects were estimated to be 20.4%, 17.7%, and \n19.1%.  In  general,  the  sensitivity  results  showed  that  the  EIRRs  remain  acceptable  with \nchanges  in the main cost  and  benefit  variables.  As  most  of  the  shallow  tube wells  will  involve \nthe conversion of 100% of the command area from rainfed to irrigated cultivation, the economic \n\n                                                \n10  See Financial and Economic Analyses (Appendix 2).  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nanalysis  indicates  that  all  shallow  tube  well  schemes  would  be  economically  viable,  even  with \nnew electricity grid connections.  \n \n18. \nThe project is expected to benefit up to 22,400 farm households, at least 60% of which \nwill  have  landholdings  of  less  than  1  ha  in  the  Terai  or  0.5  ha  in  the  hills  and  mountains. \nIncremental  agricultural  production  is  expected  to  total  23,200  tons  of  stable  cereal  crops  and \n29,000 tons of vegetable cash crops. Profits from the improved irrigated crop production can be \nused to finance the long-term operation, maintenance and sustainability of the systems. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\nto \n\nfor \n\ninfrastructure \n\nthe  participating  districts;  (ii)  enhancing \n\n19. \nThe project supports local governance, financial and administrative decentralization, and \noversight  of  public  development  expenditure  by  (i)  transferring  the  project's  capital  investment \nfunds \ntransparency  and \naccountability of public service delivery of small irrigation development  by DDCs by identifying \nand  managing  subprojects  by  local  government  units  and  irrigation  communities;  and  \n(iii) building the capacity of WUAs and district governments in financial discipline, responsibility, \ntransparency and accountability. A risk assessment and risk management plan is included in the \nlinked documents.11 The project aims to support the post-conflict approach outlined in the CPS \nby identifying and managing potential conflict risks and opportunities.12 \n \n20. \nADB\u201fs Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  DOLIDAR,  and  key  measures  to  prevent  corruption  have  been  included  in  the  project \ndesign.  These  include  procedures  for  social  audit,  enhanced  oversight  of  civil  works \nprocurement  processes,  training  in  anticorruption  activities  at  central,  district,  and  local  levels, \nand disclosure of procurement-related information, including contract awards.13 \n \nD. \n\nPoverty, Social and Gender \n\n21. \nFarmers  with marginal  land  holdings  of  less  than 0.5  ha  or  with less than 1  ha  in poor \nareas  are  targeted  as  beneficiaries  under  the  project.  The  targeting  criteria  of  land  size  and \npoverty incidence correspond to areas with greater numbers of marginalized and poor farmers \nfrom  disadvantaged  castes  and  ethnic  groups  and  women  farmers.  The  project  will  provide \nsupplementary  assistance  to  the  poorest  and  most  socially  marginalized  irrigation  users  to \nincrease  participation  and  the  benefits  they  receive.  Through  irrigation  improvements,  social \nmobilization,  the  provision  of  agricultural  services,  and  facilitation  to  access  microfinance \nservices,  the  project  will  improve  rural  livelihoods  and  boost  agricultural  production.  The \nintensification  of  irrigated  agriculture,  a  shift  from  rain-fed  to  irrigated  agriculture  and  the \nintroduction  of  or  increase  in  vegetable  farming  will  lift  most  marginal  farmers  within  the \nsubproject  command  areas  above  the  poverty  line.  The  economic  analysis  conducted  for  the \nproject pilot subprojects estimated that the project will increase incomes by $100\u2013$300 a year \nfor small and marginal farmers, i.e. those 85-95% of households which have less than 2.5 ha. \nThe project will also contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \ndirectly    by  improving  food  security  (MDG1)  and  indirectly  through  higher  incomes  and  food \nproduction  (MDGs  2\u20137).  The  landless  poor  will  benefit  only  indirectly  from  irrigation \nimprovements;  however  these  households  will  benefit  from  access  to  microfinance.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2.  \n                                                \n11  See Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2).  \n12 See  Nepal  Post-Conflict  Sensitive  Approach:  A  Peace  Building  Tool  (Peace  Filter)  for  Project  Design  and \n\nImplementation (Appendix 2). \n\n13  See also Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2).  \n\n\f \nThe  project  is  classified  as  having  a  gender  equity  theme.  A  gender  action  plan14 has \n22. \nbeen  made  an  integral  part  of  the  project  design  and  is  covered  by  one  of  the  covenants.    It \nincludes  (i)  gender-sensitive  and \ninclusive  procedures  and  provisions  within  WUAs;  \n(ii)  meaningful  consultation  and  participation  of  women  and  consequent  incorporation  of \nwomen\u201fs needs in the system design and other project activities through implementation of the \nconsultation  and  participation  plan; 15 (iii)  proportionate  representation  of  women  in  decision \nmaking bodies and processes, training, and project activities; (iv) extra capacity building prior to \nparticipation in training, WUAs, and decision making; (v) equal payment to women for labor (and \nequal treatment for voluntary labor); (vi) a sex-, caste-, and ethnicity-disaggregated monitoring \nand  management  information  system;  (vii)  subproject-specific  application  of  the  gender  action \nplan;  (viii)  microfinance  schemes  for  women  that  will  provide  them  with  access  to  loans  and \nsavings to improve their agricultural livelihoods. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment:  Category  B.  The  environmental  assessment16 indicates  that  minimal  or \n23. \nno  significant  environmental  impacts  are  expected  in  most  subprojects.  Each  subproject  is \nsubject to environmental and social screening at the pre-feasibility stage to avoid such adverse \nimpacts  as  encroaching  on  the  habitats  of  endangered  indigenous  peoples,  historical  and \ncultural  sites,  or  protected  and  ecologically  sensitive  areas,  or  locating  the  system  in  an  area \nwith vulnerable slopes. An environmental assessment and review framework has been prepared. \nIt calls for environmental due diligence to be conducted on all subprojects at the pre-feasibility \nstage, and for an initial environmental examination with an environmental management plan to \nbe  prepared  for  any  surface  water  schemes  with  a  command  area  of  more  than  150  ha.  For \nsurface water rehabilitation schemes and groundwater cluster schemes, a due diligence report \nwill  be  prepared.  The  list  of  potential  environmental  impacts,  their  mitigation  measures, \ninstitutional arrangements for implementation and monitoring of any environmental management \nplans,  and  the  outlines  for  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental  due \ndiligence report have been described in the environmental assessment and review framework. \nShould  an  environmental  impact  assessment  be  triggered  for  a  particular  subproject,  it  will  be \ndropped.  \n \n24. \nADB  has  assessed  the  sustainability  of  water  resources  and  determined  that  the  draw \non  both  surface  water  and  groundwater  under  the  project  is  minimal  and  is  not  expected  to \nsignificantly  impact  the  water  balance.  A  disaster  and  climate  change  risks  screening17 was \nconducted  to  assess  project  exposure  to  climate-induced  risk  and  natural  disasters.  Climate \nchange projections indicate that Nepal is more likely to suffer  increased drought in future. The \nproject will help farmers adapt to long periods of drought through improved irrigation and water \nuse  efficiency  in  subproject  areas.  In  addition,  the  project's  social  mobilization  and  capacity \ndevelopment  program  will  help  both  farmer  beneficiaries  and  the  project  engineers  better \nunderstand  the  impacts  of  the  environment  on  the  project  and  to  identify  risk  reduction \nmeasures  such  as  on-farm  water  conservation  and  management  and  landslide  control \ntechniques. A greater incidence of flash floods is also expected during the monsoon period. The \nproject  will  promote  flexible  irrigation  diversion  structures  and  build  the  technical  and financial \ncapacity of the WUAs to maintain the improved irrigation structures. \n \n                                                \n14 Gender Action Plan (Appendix 2). \n15 Consultation and Participation Plan (Appendix 2). \n16  See Environmental Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n17  See Disaster and Climate Change Risks Screen Results (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\ffor  subproject \n\nfunctioning  WUA \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement:  Category  C.  A  resettlement \n\nframework  has  been \n25. \nprepared. 18  The  resettlement  framework  covers  small,  community-led  subprojects  with  no \nresettlement and where all land acquisition is voluntary. The selection criteria for a subproject is \nthat irrigation improvement is desired by a community whose members would voluntarily donate \nsmall  parcels  of  their  land  for  the  irrigation  enhancement.  By  contributing  land  for  the  project \nthey  become  primary  beneficiaries  of  enhanced  irrigation  facility.  For  each  subproject  with \nrequirements  for  new  land,  procedures  have  been  established  to  verify  that  the  land  is  being \nprovided  voluntarily  by  those  who  stand  to  gain  directly,  and  to  verify  that  the  subproject  will \ncause  no  impoverishment  or  displacement  of  tenants  or  bonded  labor.  Resettlement  due \ndiligence  will  also  ensure  that  meaningful  consultation  has  taken  place  in  good  faith  with  all \naffected  persons,  a \nimplementation  exists,  and  sex-\ndisaggregated  socioeconomic  baseline  data  have  been  collected.  This  resettlement  due \ndiligence will be documented in the subproject feasibility study report. Any subproject requiring \nnonvoluntary land acquisition will be dropped.  \n \n26. \nIndigenous  Peoples:  Category  B.  An  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has \nbeen  prepared  based  on  an  analysis  of  indigenous  peoples'  impacts  and  vulnerabilities.19 The \nanalysis  considered  different  categories  of \n(endangered,  highly \nmarginalized, marginalized, disadvantaged and advantaged), as well as their traditional rights to \nwater  sources,  land  and  forest  resources,  and  caste  groups  that  do  not  receive  sufficient \nbenefits  under  existing  arrangements.  The  inclusion  of  indigenous  peoples  in  subprojects  is \nexpected  to  be  high,  as  the  project  targets  geographically  marginal  rural  areas  where \nindigenous peoples are a majority. The analysis indicated that indigenous peoples in the sample \nsubproject  areas  are  not  vulnerable  according  the  definition  in  ADB\u201fs  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  Therefore  it  is  expected  that  the  project  will  impact  indigenous  peoples  only  in  a \npositive way. The project design incorporates many features that will ensure indigenous peoples \nare able to benefit and participate meaningfully. Subprojects are community-driven and will not \nbe  prepared  unless requested by  the  community,  and  unless they  meet  screening  criteria  that \ninclude a requirement that the community is able to form an inclusive community mechanism for \nimplementation. The selection criteria will ensure that subprojects will not affect the habitats of \nendangered  indigenous  peoples  and  areas  where  there  is  a  dispute  over  water  user  rights. \nIssues  of  gender,  participation  and  land  acquisition  are  dealt  with  under  the  project  gender \naction  plan,  the  resettlement  framework,  and  the  consultation  and  participation  plan.  The \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  summarizes  the  strategy  for  participation  and \nrealization  of  project  benefits,  specifically  enhancing  participation  by  indigenous  peoples, \nscreening  for  negative  impacts  and  ensuring  benefits,  institutional  arrangements,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nindigenous  peoples \n\n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 \n \n\n                                                \n18  See Involuntary Resettlement Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n19  See Indigenous Peoples Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n20  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2).  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPublic Financial Management. Public \nfinancial management capacity in DDCs \nis weak. \nProcurement. \nin \nprocurement  controls  at  DDCs  threaten \ntransparency or effectiveness. \n\nWeaknesses \n\nMitigating Measures \nDOLIDAR, with the support of the international joint \nventure, will provide implementation support, \nincluding financial management training. \nThe DOLIDAR PCU will conduct random but regular \nreviews of contracts awarded by the DDCs; MLD will \nensure that DDCs that are not complying with the \napplicable procurement procedures take appropriate \nremedial action.     \n\nADB will conduct random reviews of contracts \nawarded for civil works and supply of materials \n(except for the first contracts in each district which \nwill be reviewed before they are awarded); contracts \nwith misprocurement will not be eligible for grant \nfinancing.   \nDOLIDAR will assign a project-dedicated irrigation \nengineer to the DTO of each district to monitor the \nperformance of contractors, suppliers and WUAs.  \n\nRandom and independent spot checks will be \nundertaken by the PCU. The National Vigilance \nCenter will conduct technical audits of subprojects. \n\nADB review missions will conduct spot checks of \ncontractor and WUA performance. \nA significant part of the civil works will be undertaken \nthrough community contracts awarded to WUAs. \n\nMLD will engage with the political parties and DDC \nofficials to maintain political support for the \nanticorruption agenda. \nCommunity contracting will be used where possible. \nA WUA monitoring committee will oversee \nsubproject construction works.  \n\nProject field teams will monitor the bidding. \n\nTraining on ADB's anticorruption policy will be \nprovided for project staff during inception and review \nmissions. \n\nUpon the recommendation of DOLIDAR, PPMO to \nblacklist contractors and suppliers proven to be \ninvolved in malfeasance.     \n\nOversight  and  monitoring  of  performance \nof  contractors,  suppliers,  and  WUAs  by \nthe DDCs Is inadequate.  \n\nCorruption.  Politicians  and  officials \ninterfere in project implementation \n\nBidding of facilities and services is \nsubject to malfeasance. Potential risks \ninclude imposition of informal conditions, \nkickbacks by officials, bid rigging, \ncollusion, fraud, and deviations from \noriginal bid documents. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  DDC  =  district  development  committee,  DOLIDAR  =  Department  of  Local \nInfrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural  Roads,  DTO  =  district  technical  office,  MLD  =  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment, PCU = project coordinating unit, PPMO = Public Procurement Monitoring Organization, WUA = \nwater users associations.  \nSource:  Nepal:  Governance  Risk  Assessment  prepared  for  the  Country  Partnership  Strategy,  August  2009; \nAsian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  government  and  the  MLD  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \n28. \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and grant documents. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fThe government  and  MLD  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants for  the  project, \n\n \n29. \nwhich are set forth in the grant agreement and project agreement. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n30. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the grant not exceeding $26,400,000 to Nepal from ADB\u201fs Special Funds resources for \nthe  Community  Irrigation  Project,  on  terms  and conditions  that  are  substantially  in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft grant agreement and project agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n\nC.
