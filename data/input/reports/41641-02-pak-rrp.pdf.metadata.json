Yet its social indicators lag behind those of the other South \nAsian  countries.  This  is  particularly  true  for  two  important  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs),  which  Punjab  will  not  be  able  to  achieve  by  the  targeted  date  of  2015  without  wide-\nranging reforms in health service delivery and significant improvements in health care financing: \nMDG4, reducing the infant mortality rate (IMR), and MDG5, reducing the maternal mortality ratio \n(MMR).  For  instance,  per  capita  public  health  spending  in  2009  in  Punjab  was  about  $6.4,  in \ncontrast  to  the  levels  in  2004  of  $18.1  in  Bangladesh,  $18.6  in  Nepal and  $74.1  in  Sri  Lanka. \nSuch a situation has serious implications, given Punjab's importance to the country's economy. \nRecognizing the challenges, the Punjab government has attached top priority to the attainment \nof these two MDGs, and sought assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to address \nthe critical fiscal and health sector constraints standing in the way. \n \nIn response, during 2007-2008, ADB and the Punjab government together formulated \n3. \nthe  program  cluster  comprising  three  subprograms. 1  The  program  cluster  aims  to  improve \naccess, quality, and equity of health services in the province, especially in relation to MDGs 4 \nand  5.  It  will  also  more  broadly  ensure  adequate  health  care  for  the  poor  by  improving  the \navailability and quality of primary and secondary health services, and developing a viable pro-\npoor  health  care  financing  system.  In  addition,  it  will  strengthen  the  management  structure  of \nhealth service delivery. \n \nSubprogram 1 had several noteworthy achievements, including (i) creation of essential \n4. \nmaternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) posts; (ii) recruitment of additional female health \nworkers; (iii) mapping of private practitioners;  (iv) strengthening of health information systems; \nand (v) merging of budget and development wings of the Punjab Health Department. By setting \nminimum  service  delivery  standards  (MSDS)  in  2007,  the  government  clearly  shifted  its  focus \nfrom  merely  expanding  to  improving  the  quality  of  health  services.  Critical  lessons  from  the \nimplementation of subprogram 1 include the need for: (i) sustained and results-based interaction \nbetween the Health Department and the districts; and (ii) closer coordination with the provincial \nMNCH program to avoid duplication in the provision of equipment, drugs, and supplies.  \n \n5. \nSubprogram  2  continues  to  focus  on  MSDS  implementation,  particularly  related  to \nMNCH. Also, it seeks to improve day-to-day management  of health services by addressing (i) \ncapacity  constraints  in  the  health  sector,  (ii)  challenges  in  recruiting  and  posting  motivated \ndoctors and other professionals in rural and remote areas, (iii) rigid administrative procedures, \n(iv) inefficient and lengthy procurement processes for drugs and medical supplies, and (v) lack \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Program \nCluster  and  Loan  for  Subprogram  1  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Punjab  Millennium  Development \nGoals Program. Manila. A loan of $100 million equivalent was provided in a single tranche for Subprogram 1. \n\n \n\n\fof  performance  monitoring.  To  foster  efficiency  and  accountability  in  the  use  of  scarce  public \nresources,  subprogram  2  supports  the  establishment  of  provincial  and  district  internal  audit \nfunctions,  and  strengthening  of  internal  controls.  It  also  focuses  on  developing  options  for  a \nsustainable pro-poor health financing system for Punjab. The design and monitoring framework \nis  in  Appendix  1,  a  list  of  linked  documents  analyzing  the  program  is  in  Appendix  2,  and  the \ngovernment's development policy letter is in Appendix 3.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n6. \nThe impact of the program will be the attainment of MDGs 4 and 5, relating to reducing \nthe  IMR  and  MMR  in  Punjab.  The program's  outcome  will  be  improved  access  to,  and  quality \nand equity of, health services. The delivery of the minimum package of services described in the \nMSDS,  especially  for  MNCH,  is  the  core  strategy  for  attaining  MDGs  4  and  5.  Therefore,  the \nprogram  focuses  on  reforms  required  for  effective  MSDS  implementation.  The  program  will \nassist the government in undertaking health sector reforms in three core policy areas (CPAs):  \n(i) improve the availability and quality of primary and secondary health services, (ii) improve the \nmanagement of health service delivery, and (iii) develop a sustainable and pro-poor health care \nfinancing system. A policy matrix for subprogram 2 and tentative policy actions for subprogram \n3 are in Appendix 4. Under each CPA, outcomes and outputs are identified to ensure sustained \nprogress in achieving MDGs 4 and 5. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nCPA  1:  Improve  the  Availability  and  Quality  of  Primary  and  Secondary \nHealth Services  \n\na. \n\nMSDS Introduced to Primary and Secondary Health Services \n\nThis policy objective aims to introduce service standards first in the public sector and \n7. \nultimately to private sector health service providers. Under subprogram 2, the government has \n(i) completed a wide-ranging information campaign to build awareness of MNCH-related MSDS, \ntargeting general public as well as health workers; (ii) ensured that each district government has \nupdated  its  3-year  rolling  development  plan  previously  adopted  under  subprogram  1  for \nimplementing  MNCH-related  MSDS;  and  (iii)  ensured  that  seven  district  governments  have \nsubstantially  conformed  to  the  minimum  level  of  MNCH-related  MSDS.  The  Office  of  the \nDirector  General,  Health  Services  (ODGHS)  is  monitoring  implementation  of  the  3-year  plans \nthrough monthly meetings of the executive district officers for health. All 36 districts have signed \na memorandum of understanding with the government to reach the minimum acceptable MSDS \nby 2012.  \n \n\nb. \n\nPrimary and Secondary Health Services Fully Staffed and \nEquipped According to the MSDS \n\n8. \nThis policy objective aims to provide adequate physical and human resources to health \nfacilities. Under subprogram 2, the government has placed at least one woman medical officer \n(WMO) or a lady health visitor or a trained midwife in 95% of the basic health units (BHUs), to \nprovide the public with access to competent female staff for MNCH. However, the government \nfaces difficulties in filling all existing vacancies of crucial MNCH-related positions, especially in \nthe specialist categories, where 60% of posts for gynecologists are vacant and 48% of posts for \nanesthetists.  A  major  reason  for  these  high  vacancy  rates  is  the  availability  of  attractive  pay \npackages  in  the  private  sector  and  internationally.  WMOs  are  crucial  for  delivering  MNCH-\n\n2 \n\n \n\n\frelated services, especially primary health care. Only 54% of WMO posts are currently filled in \nPunjab. The situation is comparatively better for lady health visitors (92% of positions filled) and \nnurses  (75%  of  positions  filled).  For  medical  officers,  71%  positions  are  filled  both  for  primary \nand secondary care facilities.  \n\n9. \nRealizing the gravity of the situation, the government has developed a human resource \nplan to address these issues. It is also pursuing short- to medium-term measures, including ad \nhoc  recruitment  of  specialists  and  nurses,  accelerated  training  courses  especially  for \nanesthetists to bridge the gap, rotation of postgraduate training students from teaching hospitals \nto  different  districts,  regularization  of  contractual  posts  (medical  officers,  WMOs,  and  nurses), \nage  relaxation  for  hiring  medical  officers  and  WMOs,  and  introduction  of  evening  shifts  for \ntraining  nurses  in  some  districts  to  improve  the  supply  situation.  The  Punjab  Public  Service \nCommission has recruited 1,200 medical officers (approximately 600 available for public sector \nservice delivery) and 276 WMOs.  \n \n10. \nAvailability of functional equipment is another essential feature of effective health care \ndelivery.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  has  equipped  80%  of  BHUs,  rural  health \ncenters, and MNCH-related departments of tehsil and district headquarters hospitals in line with \n95% or more of MSDS requirements. The government has developed and circulated a standard \nMNCH-related  equipment  list  for  all  health  care  facilities,  and  circulated  a  pro  forma  to  the \ndistricts for tracking the availability and functionality of equipment.  \n \n\nc. \n\nMeasures  Adopted  to  Improve  Quality  of  Health  Workers  and  Their \nPractices \n\n11. \nThe  quality  of  health  workers  is  the  most  critical  determinant  of  the  quality  of  health \nservices,  as  paramedics,  nurses,  midwives,  and  lady  health  visitors  play  an  important  role  in \nhealth  service  delivery.  Five  paramedical  and  30  nursing  schools  are  under  the  control  of  the \ndistrict governments in Punjab. Under subprogram 1, a conceptual framework and plans were \ndeveloped  for  improving  facilities  at  these  institutions.  Building  on  this,  the  government  has \naccomplished  the  following  under  subprogram  2:  (i)  improved  facilities  in  three  important \nparamedical schools and 15 nursing schools, through the provision of such items as minor civil \nworks,  teaching  aids,  computers,  and  books;  (ii)  trained  90%  of  the  MNCH-related  workers  in \nthe  relevant  parts  of  standard  medical  protocols,  standard  operating  procedures,  and  referral \nprotocols;  (iii)  approved  a  new  service  structure  for  paramedics;  and  (iv)  introduced  greater \nclarity and rigor in the profession, by separating the examination of paramedics from the Punjab \nMedical Faculty to the University of Health Sciences, known for its high standards, leaving the \nregulatory function with the former. \n \n12. \nContinuous medical education is an important tool to ensure quality of health workers; \nhowever, in Pakistan, neither medical doctors nor paramedics have systematic opportunities or \nincentives  to  update  their  knowledge.  The  government  has  developed  a  continuing  education \nsystem  for  both  groups  under  subprogram  2,  approved  by  the  chief  minister.  Continuous \nmedical education will be linked to the promotion of medical and paramedical staff in the public \nsector in Punjab in the future, with implementation commencing under subprogram 3.  \n \n13. \nA  comprehensive  health  human  resources  plan  has  been  developed  and  approved \nunder subprogram 2. The plan addresses both the quality and quantity of health sector human \nrationalization  of  service  structures,  and \nresources, \ncomputerized  registration  of  health  workers.  Further,  a  computerized  database  has  been \nestablished with detailed data of all health workers, including designation, place of posting, and \n\nfilling  vacancies, \n\nincentives \n\nfor \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\faddresses  of  the  respective  facilities.  This  will  substantially  improve  the  Health  Department's \nmapping  of  human  resources,  besides  facilitating  the  process  of  postings,  transfers,  and \npromotions.  Detailed  information  on  all  health  sector  staff  will  decrease  the  number  of  ghost \nworkers, thereby increasing efficiency of health sector expenditures. \n \n14. \nIn  Punjab,  private  health  services  are  not  subject  to  any  regulation,  which  leads  to \nwidely  varying  quality.  In  some  instances,  private  practices  are  run  without  a  proper  permit  or \nregistration.  As  a  result,  even  identifying  where  private  practitioners  exist  in  Punjab  is  difficult. \nYet,  an  estimated  70%  of  the  initial  health  consultations  are  reported  to  take  place  at  private \nfacilities,  including  dispensaries.  To  protect  citizens  from  negligence  and  questionable  health \npractices, some regulation and quality oversight of the private sector is necessary. At the same \ntime,  private  sector  participation  is  vital  given  the  capacity  constraints  in  the  public  sector. \nBalancing  these  needs,  the  government  has  taken  the  bold  step  of  introducing  a  health  care \ncommission,  which  would,  inter  alia,  register  private  practitioners,  license  private  health  care \nfacilities,  and  provide  accreditation  and  performance  audit  of  both  public  and  private  health \nfacilities.  The  government  will  retain  the  role  of  standard  setting.  The  proposed  Health  Care \nCommission Act has been presented to the Standing Committee of the Provincial Assembly and \nis  likely  to  be  approved  as  an  act  under  subprogram  3,  with  an  action  plan  developed  for \nframing the required rules, bylaws and regulations.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCPA 2: Strengthen Management of Health Service Delivery \n\na. \n\nImproved Management and Performance Monitoring \n\nPrior to subprogram 1,  the role of ODGHS  was reviewed from the perspective of the \n15. \nneed  to  strengthen  the  management  of  health  service  delivery;  ODGHS  was  subsequently \nrestructured.  One  of  the  principal  functions  of  ODGHS  is  to  support  district  governments, \nespecially  with  capacity  development  needs  in  planning  and  financial  management.  In  this \nrespect,  the  plan  of  action  for  district  capacity  development  adopted  under  subprogram  1  has \nbeen fully implemented under subprogram 2. Specifically, 50% of the district health teams and \nmanagers  have  been  trained  under  subprogram  2.  As  noted  in  para.  7,  ODGHS  is  also \nresponsible for  ensuring  the  quality of  the  districts'  3-year  rolling  plans and  the  consistency  of \nthese plans with attaining the MSDS. Underpinning these efforts to monitor MSDS is the district \nhealth  information  system  (DHIS),  which  effectively  consolidates  various  sources  of  data, \nregularizes  input,  and  promotes  use  of  such  information  for  decision-making.  The  DHIS  was \nintroduced  in  10  districts  in  Punjab  under  subprogram  1.  The  government  has  rolled  out  the \nDHIS to all 36 districts under subprogram 2.  \n \n16. \nIn  collaboration  with  the  Provincial  Information  and  Analysis  Unit,  the  Health \nDepartment is developing key performance indicators as part of an evaluation system based on \ntransparent  criteria  for  assessing  the  performance  of  executive  district  officers  (EDOs)  for \nhealth, and medical superintendents for district headquarters hospitals and tehsil headquarters \nhospitals. The key performance indicators will provide top management with a tool for holding \nmanagers accountable for the effectiveness of field offices and service delivery outlets. Also, the \ngovernment  with  the  support  of  ADB  has  developed  a  results-based  management  framework \ncovering eight line departments, including health. The framework will link public investments to \ndevelopment objectives through integration with the medium-term budget framework.  \n\nb. \n\nImproved Efficiency of Drug and Supply Procurement  \n\n17. \nThis  policy  objective  supports  the  achievement  of  the  MSDS  and  reduced  MMR  and \nIMR by improving the procurement and supply system for the health sector to ensure necessary \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fdrugs  and  supplies  are  available  on  a  regular  basis,  thereby  eliminating  frequent  out-of-stock \nsituations. Under subprogram 1, the Health Department reviewed drug, equipment, and supply \nmanagement systems with a view to improving efficiency and transparency. Under subprogram \n2,  work  has  progressed  on  sector-specific  procurement  guidelines,  and  18  drugs  have  been \nidentified as tracer drugs. These tracer drugs are tracked on a monthly basis through the DHIS, \nidentifying  the  incidence  and  location  of  stock  shortages.  Additional  monitoring  of  facilities  is \nundertaken  by  the  EDOs,  health.  While  the  tracer  drug  list  is  sufficient  for  primary  health \nfacilities, it needs to be expanded to reflect needs at secondary facilities. Under subprogram 3, \nthe essential drug list will be rationalized for primary and secondary health facilities, preferably \non the basis of burden of disease patterns within a specific district.  \n \n\nc. \n\nAlternative  Models  of  Health  Service  Delivery  Examined  and \nInstitutionalized \n\n18. \nPunjab has in the past implemented two models of contracting: with the Punjab Rural \nSupport Program and the National Commission for Human Development (NCHD). In an effort to \ndetermine whether the contracting model produced better health outcomes and led to efficient \nand  effective  health  services  in  the  districts  compared  with  those  that  did  not  contract,  the \ngovernment  has  finalized  the  study  design  for  a  third-party  evaluation  of  the  Punjab  Rural \nSupport  Program  and  NCHD  models  with  inputs  from  ADB  and  assistance  from  the  United \nNations'  Children's  Fund.  Based  on  the  evaluation  results,  where  feasible,  the  government \nintends to move to institutionalizing viable contracting arrangements for the health sector. The \ngovernment  has  also  taken  steps  to  improve  efficiency  of  service  delivery  through  functional \nintegration  of  health  services  financed  by  federal,  provincial,  and  district  governments  for  the \nBHUs.  The  concept  of  functional  integration  was  finalized  under  subprogram  1.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the integration approach was pilot tested in five districts in Punjab and the results \nappear quite promising. This will be rolled out to all districts under subprogram 3.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCPA 3: Establish a Sustainable Pro-Poor Health Financing Arrangement \n\na. \n\nGreater  Provision  and  More  Rational  Budget  Allocation  for  the \nHealth  Sector,  especially  for  Primary  and  Secondary  Health \nServices \n\n19. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  has  developed  a  medium-term  budget \nframework  for  the  health  sector  at  the  provincial  level,  which  also  captures  local  government \nactivities, providing a consolidated approach to the health sector (provincial and district budget). \nIn  this  context,  given  the  large  expenditure  requirements  and  low  levels  of  public  health \nspending,  the  government  has  increased  the  provincial  budget  for  health  by  15%  in  FY2010 \nunder subprogram 2. This will trigger an increase in district budgets and expenditures as well. \n \n20. \nAnalysis  of  district  expenditure  indicates  that  health  services  receive  only  a  small \nshare of the district budget and are severely underfinanced. To ensure that district governments \nallocate sufficient funding for MNCH-related MSDS, the conditional grant mechanism is used as \na tool to earmark funds for the health sector. Under subprogram 1, grants were made available \nto all districts in Punjab. Under subprogram 2, those districts showing at least 80% utilization of \ntheir  first  grant  are  eligible  to  receive  the  next  conditional  grant.  The  grants  are  shown \nseparately  in  the  budget  and  are  governed  by  a  memorandum  of  understanding  between  the \nprovince  and  district  governments,  stipulating  access  conditions.  Under  subprogram  2, \nperformance criteria have been incorporated in the second and third round of conditional grants \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nto  incentivize  improved  district  performance  toward  achievement  of  MSDS.  A  designated \nsecretariat within ODGHS will monitor district utilization of conditional grants. \n \n21. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  conditional  grants  in  the  amount  of  Rs.3.5  billion  for  pursuing \nMSDS were disbursed. Under subprogram 2, the government has allocated PRs 6.4 Billion ($75 \nmillion)  in  the  current  FY2010  budget  to  be  disbursed  as  conditional  grants  to  those  districts \nwho  have  spent  80%  of  the  conditional  grants  provided  under  subprogram  1.  The  Health \nDepartment  works  with  districts  in  ensuring  they  regularly  report  on  the  use  of  the  conditional \ngrants.   \n \n\nb. \n\nImproved Financial Management and Reporting, and Internal \nControls and Audits in the Health Sector \n\n22. \nGood  financial  management  and  reporting  practices  will  help  ensure  effective  and \nefficient  use  of  resources  to  meet  the  program  objective  of  improved  quality  and  equitable \naccess  to  health  services.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  Health  Department  merged  the \nDevelopment Wing and Budget and Accounts Wing into the Financial Management Cell (FMC) \nto  serve  as  the  focal  point  for  the  Finance  Department  and  the  Planning  and  Development \nDepartment for provincial and district budget preparation, execution, and monitoring. The FMC \nbridges  the  traditional  separation  of  the  recurrent  and  development  budgets,  providing  an \nimproved  basis  for  resource  allocation.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  budget  classification  codes \nhave  been  amended  to  provide  detailed  monthly  reporting  for  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary \nhealth  care. 2  Under  subprogram  3,  the  Health  Department  will  consolidate  reporting  on \ndevelopment  and  current  expenditures  in  a  manner  that  clearly  sets  out  information  on  the \nimplications of ongoing development programs for future recurrent spending. \n \n23. \nWhile increased resources for the health sector in Punjab will help increase quality and \naccess of health services, strong internal controls are vital to ensure that the resources are used \neffectively.  Continuing  earlier  work,  the  government  has  taken  a  range  of  measures  under \nsubprogram 2: (i) clearance of more than 1,200 outstanding audit observations by the Internal \nAudit Wing; (ii) analysis of the effectiveness and adequacy of the present internal controls, and \ndesign of a conceptual framework for their improvement, guided by recent external audit reports \nfor spending units within the Health Department; (iii) filling of the positions of director and deputy \ndirector  of  the  Internal  Audit  Wing  in  the  Health  Department,  separating  the  previously  jointly \nadministered  budget  and  internal  audit  wings,  and  setting  the  foundation  for  increased \ntransparency  and  accountability;  (iv)  completion  of  a  fiduciary  risk  assessment,  which  will \nprovide  the  basis  for  restructuring  the  internal  control  system,  and  an  internal  audit  plan  for \nimplementation  under  subprogram  3;  (v)  development  of  a  manual  and  training  material  for \ninternal auditors; and (vi) appointment of internal auditors in 10 districts.  \n \n\nc. \n\nPro-Poor Health Financing \n\n24. \nThe  government  is  committed  to  increasing  health  investment  and  introducing  major \nhealth  financing  reforms  that  will  improve  equity  in  access  to  health  services  and  reduce  the \nhealth expenditure burden. Major financing reforms may take several years to complete. Hence, \nthe  government  has  adopted  a  two-pronged  approach:  introducing  short-term  measures  to \nrelieve  the  poor  and  vulnerable  from  the  burden  of  significant  health  expenditure,  while \ndeveloping  an  alternative  overall  health  financing  system  for  the  medium  to  long  term.  Under \n\n                                                 \n2  This action supports the use of the accounting module of the World Bank-supported Project for Improved Financial \n\nReporting and Accounting. \n\n\fsubprogram 2, the government pilot tested in two districts the Sehat Sahulat scheme, a pro-poor \nhealth  financing  model,  which  gives  pregnant  women  living  below  poverty  line  access  to  free \nMNCH services through health vouchers. The results were evaluated and presented in a report. \nBased  on  this,  and  with  a  view  to  providing  more  institutional  autonomy  and  efficiency,  the \ngovernment has rationalized user charges across facilities and according to services provided, \nand  developed  a  mechanism  for  institutionalizing  and  retaining  user  charges  for  facilities.  A \nconceptual framework for reducing health care expenditure burden on the poor was developed \nunder subprogram 1. Building on this, the government has prepared a position paper over the \ncourse  of  2009-2010.  Based  on  the  realities  of  Punjab's  current  health  financing  system,  the \npaper  presents  various  options  for  pro-poor  health-financing:  a  tax  based  system,  voluntary \nhealth  insurance,  social  health  insurance,  and community-based  insurance.  While  none  of  the \noptions  would  be  ideal  on  a  stand  alone  basis  for  Punjab,  the  paper  and  background  reports \ndiscuss the strengths of each and recommend that a combination of two or three of the options \nmay be adopted. The position paper and recommendations have been disseminated within the \nhealth  community.  They  will  be  debated  at  a  round  table  for  major  stakeholders  under \nsubprogram 3. \n   \nD. \n \n25. \nThe  government  has  requested  ADB  for  a  loan  of  $150  million  for  subprogram  2  to \npartially  meet  the  financing  needs  for  health  sector  reforms.  At  the  time  of  subprogram  1,  the \nfollowing requirements were identified for a 3-year period, which have now been revised (Table \n1):3 \n \n\nProgram Costs and Financing \n\nTable 1: Punjab Health Sector Financing Requirements \n\n \n\n$ million \n\nFinancing Requirements Over 2008\u20132011 \nImplementation of MNCH-related MSDS \nImplementation of MSDS overall in the health sector \nProvision of pro-poor health financing \nScaling  up  of  public  health  expenditures  to  raise  per  capita \nspending to $16 (about half of the international benchmark set \nby World Health Organization) \nTotal Requirements \nMNCH = maternal, neonatal, and child health; MSDS = minimum service delivery standards. \nSource: ADB staff. \n\n82.0\n400.0\n194.0\n929.0\n\n1,605.0\n\n \n26. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  out  of  the  loan  of  $100  million  equivalent,  the  government \nallocated  PRs3.5  billion  ($50  million)  as  conditional  grants  to  district  governments  to  carry  out \nthe  reforms  associated  with  the  program.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  equivalent  of  $75  million \n(50% of the loan amount) has been allocated for the second round of conditional grants. \n \n27. \nThe  proposed  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR  102,318,000  for \nsubprogram 2 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will have an interest rate of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. The \nloan will be released in a single tranche.

The specific loan size and composition for subprogram 3 will \nbe  confirmed  during  loan  processing,  on  the  basis  of  reform  progress,  requirements,  and \navailability of resources at that time. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n27. \nSubprogram  2  actions  have  been  implemented  over  January  2009\u2013June  2010.  The \nsubprogram 2 will remain open until 30 December 2010 to allow for the audit of the use of the \ncounterpart funds generated from the loan proceeds. The management of subprogram 2 will be \noverseen by the Health Sector Reform Program Steering Committee, comprising the chairman \nof Punjab Planning and Development Board as the chair; and secretaries of health, finance and \nlocal  government  and  community  development  departments  as  members,  along  with \nrepresentatives  of  various  public  and  private  sector  health  care  providers.  The  Health \nDepartment  of  the  Punjab  government  will  function  as  the  executing  agency,  with  Finance \nDepartment  and  the  Planning  and  Development  Department  acting  as  the  implementing \nagencies. The Health Sector Reform Program Management Unit, comprising 22 staff, will be in-\ncharge of the day-to-day implementation of the program.  \n \nF. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \n28. \nduties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries excluding the items \nspecified  in  a  negative  list  of  ineligible  items.  The  list  of  ineligible  items  is  a  linked  document \ncited in Appendix 2. The proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with the \nprovisions  of  ADB's  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for \nProgram Loans.4 Loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports on the basis of a \ncertificate provided by the government stipulating that the value of the total imports of Pakistan, \nminus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under \nother  official  development  assistance,  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan \nexpected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the \nloan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the government's certification. \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe provision of budget support for reforms under the Punjab Millennium Development \n29. \nGoals  Program  is  justified  on  two  principal  grounds.  First,  as  noted  in  para.  2,  Punjab  lags \nconsiderably  behind  other  regions  in  South  Asia.  It  needs  to  expand  its  public  spending  on \nhealth  to  catch  up  with  its  neighbors.  Second,  the  district  and  local  government  interventions \nsupported  under  the  program  are  better  implemented  through  a  programmatic  modality,  given \nthe  reform  imperatives  to  design  and  deliver  basic  health  services  for  MNCH.  The  program \nsupports  inclusive  growth  through  improvements  in  governance  and  service  delivery.  The \nreforms  will  improve  the  availability  of  health  care,  management  of  service  delivery,  and \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  pro-poor  health  financing  arrangements  in  a  manner \nconsistent  with  fiscal  sustainability.  The  introduction  of  a  medium-term  framework  for  fiscal \nplanning and a framework that consolidates recurrent and development spending objectives for \nthe  health  sector  ensures  that  increased  financing  for  the  health  sector  focuses  on  efficient \nspending  and  sustainability.  Conditional  grants  for  districts  not  only  contribute  increased \n\n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2007. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n\fdevelopment  resources,  but  also  strengthen  managerial  capacity.  Improvements  in  financial \nmanagement and internal audit within the provincial and district health services work to support \nefficient  use  of  resources  and  ensure  sustainability  of  improved  allocation  for  public  health \nservices.  \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n30. \nSeveral  governance  risks  are  identified  in  the  areas  of  public  financial  management, \nexpenditure  planning  and  control,  procurement,  and  corruption.  As  a  policy  and  institutional \nreform program, the program deliberately and explicitly puts governance and public expenditure \nmanagement issues at the center of the reform effort. Reforms proposed under the program will \npositively  affect  the  current  institutional  setup  in  the  health  sector  and  address  these \ngovernance  risks,  although  the  change  in  public  financial  management  practices  and  the \nemphasis on results-based allocation of resources may encounter internal resistance to change. \nThe program has built-in third-party assessments, including a citizen satisfaction survey. ADB's \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nGovernment of Pakistan and the Health Department, Government of Punjab.  \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  majority  of  maternal  and  infant  deaths  in  Punjab  are  preventable  if  women  and \n31. \nchildren have timely access to quality preventive, primary, and secondary health care. Access is \nlimited  or  delayed  because  health  services  are  not  physically  available  locally,  doctors  and/or \nmedicines  are  not  available,  or  services  are  unaffordable.  Where  health  care  services  are \navailable,  their  quality  is  not  always  optimal.  Punjab\u2019s  health  service  delivery  system  needs \nquantitative  and  qualitative  improvements,  and  measures  to  reduce  the  burden  of  health  care \nexpenditure  on  the  poor.  Poor  people  have  the  worst  health  outcomes  and  they  are  pushed \nfurther  into  poverty  because  of  ill  health,  resulting  in  lower  productivity  or  loss  of  daily  wages, \nand a burden of high health care expenditures. Although public health care is in principle free, \npatients  often  have  to  pay  substantial  amounts  for  health  care  because  of  missing  drugs  and \nsupplies at public health facilities. Approximately 75% of health expenditure is estimated to be \nfinanced  through  out-of-pocket  expenditures  in  Punjab.  Until  2  years  ago,  the  majority  of  the \nhealth  care  budget  of  the  government  went  to  tertiary  health  care,  which  mainly  serves  the \nurban population and whose benefits are known to be regressively distributed.  \n\n32. \nImproved access and quality for primary and secondary health care supports a reduction \nin  IMR  and  MMR  consistent  with  the  attainment  of  MDG  targets  by  2015.  By  that  time,  the \nprogram  will  have  contributed  to  saving  the  lives  of  more  than  11,000  women  and  more  than \n235,000  infants.  By  assisting  the  government  in  implementing  the  MSDS,  the  program  will \nensure  that the  MSDS  are  observed  and  ultimately  enforced  throughout  Punjab.  The  program \nwill  also  improve  the  capacity  of  the  Health  Department  and  district  governments  in  human \nresource management, and will support improved and ongoing training for all levels of medical \nstaff. By ensuring primary and secondary health services meet the MSDS, the program will have \na positive impact on MDG6, through inclusion of HIV prevention measures in the MSDS. \n\nThe  loan  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  as  C  for \n\n33. \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people.  \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.  Measures  incorporated  in  the  subprogram  2  design  address  key  risks  (Table  2), \nprovided  that  the  government's  commitment  and  implementation  of  policy  and  fiscal  reforms \ncontinue  in  a  reasonably  stable  economic  and  political  environment.  The  overall  integrated \nbenefits and impact of the program are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n\nTable 2: Summary Risk and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \n\nManagement Plan \n\nMacroeconomic risks. Economic crisis and \nimplications for revenue could reduce fiscal space for \nsocial sector reforms.  \n \nGovernance risks. Weak public financial management \ncould undermine improvements in accountability and \nability to meet policy commitments.  \n\nRisks related to decentralization. Expected \nseparation of primary and secondary health care \nservices financing and management under the new \nlocal government act could lead to further fragmentation \nof health services. \n\nImplementation risks. Weak management capacity \nmay undermine planning, monitoring, and reporting. \n\nADB will coordinate closely with the government to \nensure agreed allocations and expenditures for the \nhealth sector. \n \nAn integrated approach will be followed for recurrent and \ndevelopment spending, with a focus on internal control \nsystems.  \n \nADB will closely track improvements in procurement \nprocedures. \n \nADB will dialogue closely with the government to avoid \nsuch fragmentation. The government will retain \nfunctional integration of management for primary and \nsecondary health and ensure that changes do not \nundermine district financing for primary health care. \n \nHealth sector human resources will be strengthened to \nensure adequate district capacity for delivering health \nservices.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n35. \nThe  federal  and  provincial  governments  have  assured  ADB  that  the  implementation  of \nsubprogram 2 will conform to all applicable ADB policies. They have also agreed with ADB on \ncertain  covenants  for  subprogram  2,  including  those  on  policy  actions  and  their  continuation, \npolicy dialogue, use of counterpart funds and program implementation as described in detail in \nthe loan and program agreements. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n36. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR 102,318,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 2 \nof  the  Punjab  Millennium  Development  Goals  Program  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources \nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and \nprogram agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n2 June 2010 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets and Indicators \n\nData Sources and  \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nBy 2015 \nIMR reduced from 78 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in \nFY2007 to 40  \nMMR reduced from 276 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births \nin FY2007 to 140  \n\n \nMICS \nDHS \n \n\nBy 2011 \nProportion of pregnant women having received four antenatal \ncare examinations by skilled birth attendant increased from \n61% in FY2007 to 80% \nNumber of women having delivered at health facilities increased \nfrom 33% in FY2007 to 50% \nProportion of deliveries attended by skilled birth attendants \nincreased from 38% in FY2007 to 70%  \nProportion of fully immunized children between 12 and 23 \nmonths of age increased from 53% in FY2007 to 80% \nCurrent use of modern contraceptives among married women \nincreased from 23% in FY2007 to 40% \nDifference in these five indicators between rural and urban \nareas reduced by 50%  \n\n \nMICS, DHS \n \nDHIS reports \n \nNational family planning \nand primary health care \nreports (MOH) \n \n\nBy 2011 \n80% of BHUs, RHCs, and MNCH-related departments of THQs \nand DHQs are fully equipped up to or beyond 95%, according \nto the MSDS  \nAt least 90% of all health providers trained in the MSDS, SOPs, \nand SMPs \nAt least 70% of health care workers at BHUs, RHCs, THQs, \nand DHQs are providing MNCH services according to the \nMSDS, SOPs, and SMPs   \n90% DHQs and THQs are operating and providing \ncomprehensive obstetric care 24-hours a day, 7-days a week \n90% RHCs operating for basic obstetric care 24-hours a day, 7-\ndays a week    \n\n \nHSRP progress reports \n \n \nODGHS DHIS reports on \nequipment, training, and \nservice provision \nEDO health reports \n \nPRMP Study on Facility \nBased Quality of Care \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nAssumptions \nPunjab Government continued \ncommitment to MDG attainment \nSustained availability of adequate \nresources \nRisk \nPolitical crises and economic \ninstability \nAssumptions \nCommunity informed of availability \nof quality health services at public \nhealth facilities \nCommunity trust established on \naccessibility and quality of services \nEffective implementation of federal \nvertical programs \nRisks \nFiscal crisis leading to reduced \npublic health sector budget \nallocation and expenditure \nWeak institutional capacity of \ndistrict governments \nLimited mobility of women because \nof sociocultural norms \nInadequate family planning \nacceptance by men \nAssumptions \nAdequate financial resources \navailable \nThe regulation requiring WMOs at \nRHCs to do postmortem on female \nbodies is repealed \nRisks \nDelay in contract awards and works \ncompletion caused by a large \nnumber of facilities \nInadequate number of nurses, \nWMOs, and paramedics available in \nthe job market \n\n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n1\n\n \n\n1\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nThe \ngovernment \nof Punjab \nattains health \nMDGs 4 and \n5.  \n\nOutcome \nImproved \naccess to \nequitable \nquality health \nservices  \n\nOutputs \n \n1.
