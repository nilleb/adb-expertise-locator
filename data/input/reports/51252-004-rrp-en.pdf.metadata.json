The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) \nfor  Strengthening  the  Financial  Market  Development  Program,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2. \nThe program supports key policy reforms designed to address finance sector deficiencies \nin  terms  of  institutions, markets  and  products,  vulnerabilities  caused  by  inadequate  risk-based \nsupervision and concentration, and increased inclusiveness in the finance sector.1 The program \nutilizes  a  programmatic  approach  that  aligns  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  to  key \ngovernment reform programs over the medium to long-term, to increase access to finance for the \nprivate sector and improve financial inclusion to enable economic diversification efforts in Bhutan. \nIn October 2019, the ADB Board of Directors approved the programmatic approach and a $30 \nmillion loan for subprogram 1 which was implemented from January 2018 to October 2019 was \nfinancially closed 31 May 2020 without any issues on record.2 Subprogram 2 is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 for commitment in 2020.3 The program is aligned \nwith  the  following  operational  priorities  of  Strategy  2030:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and \nreducing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  and  (iii)  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.4  \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProgrammatic approach and budget support. The program was originally designed to \ncomprise two subprograms, with the possibility of including a third. This approach allows ADB to \nhave an advisory role that ensures the relevant reforms are put into operation by the institutions \nconcerned  and  to  pace  its  support  for  the  government\u2019s  reform  efforts.  Subprogram  2  was \nadvanced to 2020 from 2021 at the government\u2019s request. The processing of subprogram 2 in \n2020  facilitates  the  urgent requirement for  domestic  resource  mobilization  (first  Treasury  bond \nissued  in  September  2020),  and  improved  risk  management  of  financial  institutions.  The \nadditional  subprogram  3  will  help  continue  the  reforms  commenced  under  subprogram  1  and \ncontinued under subprogram 2 in key areas, with logical sequencing of successive policy actions \nand  the  development  of  new  policy  actions  in  related  subcategories.  Subprogram  3  will  help \ncontinue the reform momentum, sustain the progress of reforms at key financial institutions, and \nintroduce  new  finance  sector  reforms.5 The  program  aims  to  achieve  standards  in  the  finance \n\n \n\n1  Independent  Evaluation  Department  (IED).  2019.

Economic diversification is a significant development problem for \nBhutan despite three decades of rapid economic growth averaging 7.0% ending fiscal year (FY) \n2018, coupled with a reduction in the national poverty rate from 23.0% in 2007 to 8.2% in 2017. \nHydropower contributes 25.0% to the gross domestic product (GDP). A decline in the production \nof electricity because of lower-than-expected rainfall and delays in the completion of hydropower \nprojects is likely to affect Bhutan\u2019s economy adversely.6 The unemployment rate was 2.7%, with \nyouth unemployment at 11.9%, as of the end of 2019. The government\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, \n2018\u20132023  aims  to  diversify  the  economy  by  creating  jobs  and  promoting  the  private  sector.7 \nGrowth in the private sector has been sluggish because of inadequate access to finance. Banks \nin  Bhutan  rely  on  collateral  and  owner\u2019s  equity  for  lending,  which  makes  access to  finance  by \nmicro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSME) difficult. This is out of line with international \npractice, which places greater weight on financial assessments and credit history. \n \nEconomic  Impact  of  COVID-19.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  has \n5. \nsignificantly dampened growth prospects. An initial 30.0% reduction in direct tourism receipts from \nthe  daily  tariff  is  estimated  for  FY2020.  While  traditionally  a  strong  driver  of  growth,  the \nconstruction  industry  is  facing  a  shortage  of  21,568  workers  because  of  entry  restrictions. \nHydropower  projects  have  been  affected  by  work  stoppages  and  labor  unavailability.  ADB \nprojects Bhutan\u2019s GDP growth to contract to 2.4% in FY2020 and 1.7% in FY2021\u2014the lowest in \na decade.8 Post-COVID-19 fiscal deficits are targeted at 6.2% of GDP in FY2020 and 7.4% of \nGDP in FY2021. ADB disbursed $20 million in May 2020, under its COVID-19 Active Response \nand Expenditure Support Program, to complement the government\u2019s pandemic response plan. \nThis support was intended to give short-term assistance and relief in terms of access to finance \nto the MSMEs, whereas subprograms 2 and 3 under the proposed program will continue to add \nlong-term budgetary support while achieving financial reforms. \n \n6. \nSignificant risks to finance sector post-COVID-19. The pandemic resulted in a sharp \nincrease in nonperforming loans (NPLs) as MSMEs struggled to meet debt repayments. NPLs \nwere high even prior to COVID-19 due to the rapid credit growth from FY2015 to FY2019 and \nconcentration in a few sectors like housing and tourism. Weakening bank balance sheets with \nhigh NPLs and a further breach in macro-prudential thresholds are expected.9 Although capital \nadequacy of banks is above the regulatory threshold, a decline is anticipated due to rising NPLs.10 \nNonbank finance segment is similarly challenged. Capital markets, which witnessed some growth \nin secondary trading in equity from January 2020 to February 2020, are expected to slow down, \nsignificantly wiping out recent gains. With an anticipated fall in dividend payouts in the corporate \nsegment, stock prices are expected to fall. A lower demand for new capital will result in a decline \nin fund-raising. Insurance companies\u2019 solvency has reduced as they now comply with RMA\u2019s new \nsolvency regulations effective from September 2019.11 \n \n\n \n\n6  World Bank. 2017.

Constraints in the finance sector impede the financial intermediation \n7. \nprocess. Finance sector constraints include (i) underdeveloped nonbank financial institutions, (ii) \ndeficient  financial  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  the  combined  effects  of  low  financial  literacy  and \ninadequate  financial  inclusion.  Removing  these  constraints  would  ensure  well-functioning \nfinancial  markets,  including  strong  institutions,  transparent  legal  structures,  and  rules  and \nregulations  that  cater  to  the  latest  requirements  of  electronic  commerce,  thereby  helping  to \nimprove financial inclusion and mobilization of domestic resources to meet development needs. \n \nNascent finance sector. Bhutan\u2019s finance sector architecture is dominated by the Royal \n8. \nMonetary  Authority  (RMA),  which  includes  the  electronic  clearinghouse,  the  financial  inclusion \nsecretariat, the consumer protection cell, and the central registry. The rest of the financial system \nis  composed  of  the  credit  information  bureau,  the  Bhutan  electronic  clearinghouse,  the  Royal \nStock  Exchange  of  Bhutan  and  the  depository,  the  Prospectus  Approval  Committee,  the \nAccounting Standards Board, and the Royal Audit Authority. Bhutan\u2019s financial system comprises \nfive banks, three insurance companies, and six microfinance institutions. The RMA regulates all \nfinancial  institutions,  including  banks,  insurance  companies,  pension  and  provident  funds  and \nmicrofinance institutions, and financial technology service providers. Measures on market depth \nlike credit to the private sector was 62.8% of GDP in March 202012 while the market capitalization \nwas  30.8%  of  GDP  in  March  2020. 13 Detailed  rules  and  regulations  on  bond  issuance  were \nachieved under subprogram 2, which enabled the first government bond issuance. The corporate \nbond  market  is  highly  illiquid.  The  Royal  Securities  Exchange  of  Bhutan  had  registered \n16 corporate bonds worth Nu8.66 billion as of December 2019.    \n \n9. \nDominant  banking  industry.  Banks  provided  75.5%  of  credit  to  the  economy  as  of \nDecember 2019. The industry fully complies with Basel II prudential requirements and partially \nwith  Basel  III  capital  adequacy  requirements.  While  the  banking  segment  is  adequately \ncapitalized, loan asset quality has steadily deteriorated because of aggressive credit expansion \nduring 2013-2019. This led to high NPLs even before COVID-19 and the erosion of the capital \nbase from high levels, but still within regulatory requirements (footnote 10). Banks do not comply \nwith Basel III liquidity requirements but maintain statutory liquidity ratios which are more lenient \nthan Basel III. The industry\u2019s deposit base is predominantly short-term, but its loans are typically \nlong-term. Although banks generally provide 20-year fixed-rate housing loans, they are vulnerable \nto  a  rise  in  interest  rates  as  banks  run  negative  liquidity  mismatches.14 This  creates  maturity \nmismatches, which were mitigated by a high current and savings account composition of 45.6% \nof total deposits as of December 2019.15 \n \nUnderdeveloped nonbank financial institutions. Bhutan\u2019s nonbanking financial system \n10. \nconsists of six microfinance institutions, two insurance companies, and one superannuation fund. \nThe bond and equity markets do not provide many investment opportunities to long-term saving \ninstitutions, such as the National Pension and Provident Fund and insurance companies, because \nof undeveloped capital markets. Like banks, insurance companies also create loan assets and \nfollow  similar  regulations  in  their  lending  business.  This  is  due  to  the  nonavailability  of \ninvestments.  Bank  lending  relied  heavily  on  housing  before  the  Indian  rupee  crisis  of  2012.16 \nHousing  loans  comprised  25.9%  of  finance  sector  credit  as  of  December  2019  and  posed \n\n \n\n12 Royal  Monetary  Authority,  Annual  Report,  2019,  Bhutan.

The  concentration  of  regulation  may  be \nappropriate,  given  the  size  of  the  financial  system,  but  a  gradual  reduction  of  concentration  is \nbetter to develop strong institutions. The Prospectus Approval Committee (PAC), under Office of \nthe  Registrar  of  Companies  and  MoEA,  performs  the  functions  of  a  securities  exchange \ncommission.  The  PAC  is  envisaged  to  be  upgraded  to  a  regulatory  body  under  chapter  14  of \nCompanies Act, 2016. In its 2018 follow-up report on the 2016 mutual evaluation report on Bhutan, \nthe Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) rated the country\u2019s effectiveness low both for \nthe \ninstitutions\u2019  compliance  with  anti-money \nlaundering/combating the financing of terrorism requirements.18  \n \nLow financial literacy and inadequate financial inclusion. Bhutan\u2019s finance sector has \n12. \nbeen growing rapidly. The ratio of private sector credit to GDP increased from 15.4% in 2005 to \n62.8% in March 2020. As of December 2018, 64.0% of adults in Bhutan held savings accounts \nwith a composition of 58.0% men and 46.0% women. Only 16.8% of adults had access to credit, \nof  which  65.0%  were  men  and  35.0%  were  women.  Banks  still  assess  loan  requests  against \ncollateral, which restricts women\u2019s access. Similarly, of the 18.0% of adults with insurance, 52.0% \nwere men and 48.0% were women for life insurance.19 Many rural communities lack access to \nformal  remittance  services.20 Therefore,  the  benefits  of  modern  electronic  and  online  payment \nsystems  have  yet  to  reach  all,  and  cash  still  dominates  the  payment  system. 21  Rules  and \nregulations on consumer redress giving protection to users of financial products and services like \ndisclosures  helped  educate  consumers  to  make  effective  and  informed  financial  decisions.  In \naddition, the redress mechanism helped to implement effective and impartial dispute resolution.  \n \n13. \nin  rural  areas.  Some \nimprovements  have  been  made,  with  the  establishment  of  microfinance  institutions,  the \nintroduction of digital services, the use of bank agents, the introduction of priority sector lending \nand  financial  literacy  programs,  and  the  imposition  of  a  minimum  lending  rate  in  2016.  The \nNational CSI Development Bank, a specialized bank to cater to financing needs of the micro and \nsmall industries was established on 22 February 2020. It was earlier known as Rural Enterprise \nDevelopment  Corporation  Limited  and the  Tarayana  Foundation  launched  the  Tarayana  Micro \nFinance for Rural Development program to meet the financial needs of rural communities on 20 \nFebruary 2020.22 However, financial inclusion remains inadequate because of limited access to \nfinance. Rural borrowers rarely have any means of recourse if bank staff act improperly. \n  \n\nimprovements  required \n\ninclusion \n\nfinancial \n\nFurther \n\n \n\n17 Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan. 2018.

The program will support the government in its commitment \nto  continue  reforms  to  make  the  finance  sector  more  responsive  to  emerging  priorities,  while \nremaining stable and inclusive. This support is critical for the government to achieve national key \nresult  areas  of  the  Twelfth  Five  Year  Plan,  2018\u20132023,  such  as  macroeconomic  stability, \neconomic  diversification,  improving  access  to  finance,  and  poverty  reduction  (footnote  7).  The \ngovernment has prepared several long-term sector development strategies. In 2017, it approved \nthe Financial Sector Development Action Plan, which details reform actions that affect, among \nothers,  the  banking  system,  nonbank financial  institutions,  and  financial  inclusion  and  financial \nliteracy.23 By using a programmatic approach, the program targets reforms in the nonbanking and \nfinance  segment  and  promotes  financial  inclusion  to  ensure  an  increased  role  for  the  private \nsector in Bhutan\u2019s economy. Transaction TA to deliver policy actions strengthened subprogram 2. \n \n15. \nRisk-based surveillance introduced under reforms. The Macro-Prudential Regulations \nwere adopted in 2018. In 2019, risk management guidelines were issued by the RMA to provide \nminimum standards in risk mitigation at financial institutions and to ensure adoption of a sound \nrisk  management  framework. 24  In  addition,  directives  on  risk-based  solvency  and  capital \nrequirements  were  issued  by  RMA  for  insurance  and  reinsurance  companies  in  Bhutan  in \nSeptember 2019.25 The RMA received support under reform area 2 of subprogram 2 on revised \nprudential guidelines to help introduce risk-based supervision and introduce relevant directives to \nfinancial institutions.  \n \n16. \nPolicy  reforms  proposed  through  the  program.  Policy  reforms  in  the  areas  of  the \nnonbank financial system, strengthening of the finance sector, and financial inclusion will continue \nto  be  delivered  under  subprogram  2.  When  subprogram  1  was  approved,  only  one  other \nsubprogram (subprogram 2) was envisaged (footnote 2), but a third subprogram is now proposed \nwith  further  policy  actions  in the three  reform  areas  (paras.  17\u201319).  The revised  post  program \nengagement  framework  after  subprogram  3  will  ensure  the  continuity  of  the  financial  market \nsector  reforms  in  several  areas.  Each  subprogram  is  a  single  tranche  intervention.  These  are \npresented in detail in the government\u2019s Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3) and the Policy \nMatrix (Appendix 4). \n \n17. \nReform area 1: Nonbank financial systems developed. This reform area is designed \nto develop Bhutan\u2019s capital markets, insurance, housing, and pension segments.26 Subprogram 1 \ndeveloped a strategy for bond issuance, and policies on new housing financing and pensions. \nUnder subprogram 2, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) approved detailed rules and regulations to \nissue government bonds and has issued the first government bond in September 2020 (maturing \nin 3 years).27 The MOF approved a pension strategy to cover private sector employees and the \nself-employed, of whom women comprise 61.0%.28 Subprogram 3 will concentrate on secondary \nmarket  development  and  an  insurance  strategy,  including  alternative  investments  and  housing \n\n \n\n23 Government of Bhutan, RMA.

Required revisions to existing rules on equity and debt issuances are included. \n \n18. \nReform area 2: Stability and integrity of the financial system strengthened. Although \nthe RMA has made improvements in the direction of risk-based monitoring, high NPLs remain a \nconcern. Under subprogram 1, the RMA instituted risk-based bank supervision, including stress \ntesting,  and  designed  templates  for  institutional  risk  profiles  and  risk  assessment  that  will \nsignificantly  assist  RMA  supervision.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  reforms  were  continued  in  the \nareas of risk assessment, with emphasis on credit and cybersecurity risks, and the inclusion of \nthe International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 in prudential requirements.29 All financial \ninstitutions operationalized an online anti-money laundering reporting system. Subprogram 3 will \nfocus  on  implementing  the  IFRS  9,  revised  rules  on  anti-money  laundering  based  on \nrequirements,  and  full  alignment  with  Basel  III,  leading  to  enhanced  stability,  efficiency,  and \ninclusiveness in financial markets. This will also lead to increased compliance with both risk-based \nsupervision and compliance. Further, NPL management strategy will be a focus to reduce NPLs \nand improve risk management. \n  \n19. \nReform area 3: Financial inclusion promoted. Under subprogram 1, the RMA approved \nthe National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), 2018\u20132023 and the National Financial Literacy \nStrategy (NFLS), 2018\u20132023.30 Under subprogram 2, the RMA approved an action plan for the \nNFLS 2018\u20132023 and the NFIS 2018\u20132023 that included (i) identifying the responsible agencies \nand  clear  timelines  for  developing  a  gender-responsive  and  socially  inclusive  financial  literacy \nprogram; (ii) conducting surveys on demand and use of financial products by women and various \ngroups;  and  (iii)  ensuring  data  and  analysis  are  disaggregated  by  sex.  In  addition,  the  RMA \nestablished a consumer redress mechanism under the Consumer Protection Financial Services \nRules  and  Regulations,  2019  to  provide  redress  to  aggrieved  consumers,  promote  fair  trade \npractices,  and  empower  and  enhance  consumer  confidence  in  financial  services.  The  RMA \napproved  an  inclusive  green  finance  road  map  in  2020  to  promote  access  to  finance  for \nentrepreneurs  seeking  funding  for  environment-friendly  projects.  Subprogram  3  will  focus  on \nfinancing inclusive green finance and financial technology to promote digital inclusion. \n \n20. \nPost  program  engagement  framework.  The  framework  was  included  to  facilitate  a \nstructured dialogue over 5\u201310 years on finance sector reforms between ADB, the MOF, and the \nRMA.  A  third  subprogram  is  proposed,  drawing  on  the  post  program  engagement  framework, \nincluding new areas such as the securitization of finance sector assets and developing the fintech \nregulatory framework. Key activities under subprogram 3 that require further dialogue to promote \nsustainability include (i) developing debt and equity capital markets; (ii) improving the insurance \nsegment by formulating an insurance strategy using amendments to the Financial Services Act \n2011; (iii) developing specific plans for affordable housing, including implementation measures to \naddress  women\u2019s  constraints  in  accessing  housing  finance;  (iv) widening  the  scope  of  risk \nprofiling  and  assessment  of  financial  institutions,  in  compliance  with  Basel  III;  (v)  developing \nstrategies to  ensure  consumer  protection;  and  (vi)  ensuring timely  implementation  of  the  NFIS \nand the NFLS, with specific gender elements. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s experience. ADB has been a long-standing partner in Bhutan\u2019s development since \n1982. The Bhutan\u2013ADB partnership in the finance sector began in 1984, with the provision of the \n\n \n\n29 The Accounting and Auditing Standards Board of Bhutan signed an agreement with the IFRS Foundation to adopt \nthe IFRS in a phased manner (phase 1 for 2013\u20132015, phase 2 for 2016\u20132017, and phase 3 for 2018\u20132019), aiming \nfor full adoption and compliance by 2021. \n\n30 Government  of  Bhutan,  RMA.  2018.

Since  then, \nBhutan has been reforming its finance sector, which deepened and expanded by about 14.0% \nannually in terms of assets from December 2014 to December 2018. The validation report of the \nIndependent Evaluation Department (IED) of the country partnership strategy final review, 2014\u2013\n2018 recommended continued support to finance sector reforms in Bhutan. ADB has proven that \na key strength is the high level of continuity through an advisory role, in supporting Bhutan, in its \ncore sectors.32 \n \n22. \nLessons.  The  program  has  drawn  on  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  policy-based \nprograms that supported finance sector reforms.33 The design of subprogram 2 is also based on \nthe achievements and lessons of ongoing TA projects. Subprogram 2\u2019s policy actions revealed \nthat issuance of a Treasury bond would help establish a yield curve and risk premiums to develop \nthe market for future issuances. Risk assessment policy actions revealed that compliance with \nthe international accounting standards was a significant need, as financial institutions were not \naligned with best practices to manage risks. Further, the expansion of pension coverage was a \npolicy  action  central  to  the  developments  in  the  insurance  and  capital  market  segments,  and \ntimely because Bhutan is experiencing a demographic dividend.34 The reform actions under the \nprogram have been prepared to help the government realize its capacity to improve cybersecurity \nin Bhutan. IED\u2019s validation report noted that efforts to diversify the economy cannot be sustained \nwithout  accompanying  public  sector  management  and  finance  reforms  that  strengthen \ngovernance (footnote 1). \n \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  to  the  program.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  has  been  to  support  the \n23. \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda through a strategic framework; informed policy dialogue; evidence-\nbased studies; and sequencing and pacing of reforms, particularly in planning and coordinating \nvarious elements of reforms. The \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach has been implemented more effectively \nsince 2017, when ADB\u2019s Bhutan Resident Mission expanded and undertook core tasks in country \noperations. Greater field presence and staff strength have enabled ADB to be more responsive \nto  client  needs  and  emerging  issues,  in  coordination  with  ADB  experts  from  the  South  Asia \nDepartment and other departments, including the Economic Research and Regional Coordination \nDepartment; Office of Anticorruption and Integrity; Office of the General Counsel; Office of Public\u2013\nPrivate  Partnership;  Office  of  Risk  Management;  Procurement,  Portfolio  and  Financial \nManagement  Department;  Private  Sector  Operations  Department;  Treasury  Department;  and \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department. A programmatic approach with two \nsubprograms was approved in 2019 to enable ADB to stay engaged and help the government \nimplement effective long-term reforms. \n \n24. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  The  involvement  of  development  partners  in  the \nfinance  sector  is  well  defined. 35 Access  to  credit  was  identified  as  one  of  the  major  critical \ndevelopment constraints in a diagnostic study on Bhutan that ADB prepared with the Government \nof Australia and Japan International Cooperation Agency.36 The government adopted its Capital \n\nBank.

In  the  same  year,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nestablished  the  South  Asia  Regional  Training  and  Technical  Assistance  Center  for  economic \ncapacity  building  in  New  Delhi  and  is  helping  the  government  set  up  a  liquidity  forecasting \nframework. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nThe  program  will  support  the  government  with  institutional  reforms  to  assist  economic \ndiversification, while improving the technical capacity of regulatory and financial institutions. The \ninclusion of subprogram 3 will have further impacts, which have been introduced as additional \nperformance  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF)  (Appendix  1).  The \nprogram\u2019s  impacts  on  macroeconomic  stability  achieved,  economic  diversity  and  productive \ncapacity  enhanced,  and  poverty  eradicated,  and  inequality  reduced  is  aligned  with  Bhutan\u2019s \nTwelfth  Five  Year  Plan,  2018\u20132023.  The  effect  of  the  reform  is  stability,  efficiency,  and \ninclusiveness of the finance sector enhanced. This will be measured by the following indicators:(i) \nall  bonds  issued  from  2018  to  2023  increased  by  6.0%,  reaching  Nu9.3  billion  (about \n$127 million);38 (ii) the year-on-year growth of private sector credit provided by commercial banks \nincreased from 14.7% in 2017 to at least an average of 17.0% for 2019\u20132023; and (iii) adults with \naccess  to  credit  reached  at  least  20.0%  by  2023  compared  with  the  16.0%  baseline  of  2018. \nAdditional DMF indicators could be added in the financial inclusion area, strengthening gender \nelements,  with  a suitable  assessment  of the  post-COVID-19  impact  on financial  access.39 The \nfinance sector has achieved compliance with the IFRS 9, partial compliance with Basel III, and \nthe operationalization of anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism compliance. \n \nD. \n \nThe total expenditure for the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u20132023 is estimated at Nu310 \n26. \nbillion (about $4.3 billion), an increase of 38.0% from the previous five-year plan. The external \nfinancing gap over the 5-year period was estimated at Nu29 billion (about $400 million). However, \npost-COVID-19, the estimated external financing gap over the 5-year period was revised to $541 \nmillion from $406 million with the largest deficits concentrated in FY2020 and FY2021. The post-\nCOVID-19 financing gap of the government in FY2020 at 6.2% of GDP was estimated at $158.1 \nmillion.    Budget  support  was  provided  by  (i)  World  Bank  $55.0  million  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  COVID-19 \nPandemic Response Option (CPRO) loan $20 million and (iii) ADB\u2019s FMDP subprogram 1 $30 \nmillion  totaling  $105  million.  Financing  gap  of  FY2021  is  estimated  at  7.4%  of  GDP  at  $203.9 \nmillion.  This  loan  of  $30  million  under  subprogram  2,  will  partially  support  the  FY2021  deficit \n(footnote  3).  The  deficits  in  both  FY2020  and  FY2021  of  $53.1  million  and  $173.9  million \nrespectively will be financed through domestic Treasury bonds and Treasury bills within FY2020 \nand FY2021. \n \n27. \nThe loan amount for subprogram 2 is $30 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 2.

In  addition,  the \ngovernment of Bhutan has requested a concessional loan of $30 million from ADB\u2019s concessional \nordinary  capital  resources  for  subprogram  3.  The  IMF  confirmed  that  the  letter  issued  in  April \n2020, in which Bhutan was assessed to have a moderate risk in the 2018 IMF\u2013World Bank debt \nsustainability  assessment  based  on  the  post-COVID-19  pandemic  assessment  of  Bhutan\u2019s \nmacroeconomic conditions, prospects, and policies, could be used for subprogram 2.40 \n \nE. \n \n28. \nThe MOF is the executing agency, and the RMA and the Ministry of Works and Human \nSettlement are the implementing agencies. A steering committee, chaired by the secretary of the \nMOF and established under subprogram 1, will continue to guide and monitor the implementation \nof  subprogram  2.  The  proceeds  of the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) in a single tranche. \nThe  implementation  period  is  November  2019\u2013November  2020  for  subprogram  2,  and \nsubprogram  3  is  expected  to  be  implemented  from  December  2020  to  March  2022.  All  policy \nactions accomplished under subprogram 1 remain effective. \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n29. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $525,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-6)  and  Financial  Sector  Development \nPartnership Special  Fund.41 The TA will be implemented over 15 months from December 2020 \nto March  2022  to  support  financial  inclusion  activities  and  post  program engagement  activities \nunder subprogram 3.42 Individual consultants will be engaged. The TA under subprogram 2 will \nprovide  significant  support  to  implementing  reforms.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart \nsupport. Consultants will be recruited following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  All  disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  following  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nSafeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \n30. \nis  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples \nsafeguards. It is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguard impacts following \nthe definition of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.43 Counterpart support will be in the form of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  and  housing  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance, \ndomestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n31. \nPoverty  and  social.  Bhutan\u2019s  limited  financial  market  development  has  had  a \ndisproportionate impact on the poor. Only 25.0% of adults in the poorest 40.0% of households in \nBhutan have a bank account, while the rate in other developing economies is 50.0% based on \n2014 data (footnote 17). Further, as of December 2019, although 67.6% of adults in Bhutan had \na  savings  account,  only  19.7%  had  access  to  credit  and  19.6%  held  an  insurance  policy \n(footnote 17). \n \n\n \n\n40 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Established by ADB.

The  program\u2019s  objectives  and  activities  align  with  the  goal  of \n32. \nadvancing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment by improving women\u2019s access to financial \nresources. The program includes three gender-related policy action areas: (i) the housing finance \nstrategy will focus on addressing demand-side factors related to women in providing access to \nhousing  finance,  (ii)  financial  inclusion  actions  will  support  the  collection  of  sex-disaggregated \ninformation and data to assess levels of financial awareness, and (iii) the development of financial \nproducts  and  services  will  address  the  financing  needs  and  constraints  faced  by  women.  The \nprogram is categorized some gender elements. \n \nGovernance.  Bhutan\u2019s  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  The  2016  public \n33. \nexpenditure  and financial  accountability  assessment  reported  improvements  from  the  previous \nassessment (2010).44 The  lowest  scores  were  given  for  accounting  and reporting,  government \ntransparency,  and  budget  reliability.  The  government  has  implemented  four  of  the  five  reform \nmeasures.
