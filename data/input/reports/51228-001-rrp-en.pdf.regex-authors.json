I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $750,000,000 in Indian rupee equivalent to the Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) \nfor the Railways Track Electrification Project in India. \n \n2.  The project involves electrification of approximately 3,378 route kilometers (km) of existing \nrailway tracks spread across 13 states in India.1 In the Indian context, electric traction has several \nadvantages. First, it is substantially cheaper to run trains on electric traction compared with diesel-\npowered trains. Despite carrying 65.4% of all freight and 51.2% of the passenger load of Indian \nRailways, electric traction accounts for only 36% of the total energy bill, with diesel accounting for \nthe balance 64%. Second, electric traction is not dependent on a specific primary source of energy \n(in contrast to diesel) and can therefore be sourced from a range of energy forms taking price and \nother characteristics into consideration, such as increasing renewable energy capacity in India. \nThird, electric traction makes regenerative braking possible, where energy is recovered from \nbraking or slowing down of the train and thereby saving energy by up to 20%.2 Finally, it reduces \ndependence on imported energy (diesel), thereby helping manage the current account deficit, and \nremoves variability of input energy prices which are dependent on international crude oil price \nmovements. Moreover, ADB\u2019s 20-year loan will allow IRFC to match the cash flows from the \nassets to loan repayment with no foreign exchange risk.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  The Government of India has placed significant emphasis on investing in infrastructure, \nand has developed a 5-year, $132 billion capital expenditure program for the modernization of \nIndian Railways, which it owns through the Ministry of Railways (MOR). The program comprises \nof network expansion and decongestion, enhancement of safety and passenger amenities, \ndevelopment of dedicated freight corridors, station redevelopment, and procurement of rolling \nstock and other related assets. The electrification of railway tracks is part of this overall master \nplan, which is critical for the movement of goods and people within the country. Indian Railways \nlaunched Mission Electrification in November 2016 under the guidance of MOR, and has set an \nelectrification target of 38,000 route km by FY2022.3 With a substantial part of its network \nelectrified, Indian Railways is expected to achieve cumulative savings of \u20b9260 billion over a \ndecade because of reduced diesel bills from FY2021 onwards.4 \n \n4.  Indian Railways is the third largest railway network in the world, comprising over 121,407 \nkm of total track length and a total route length5 of 67,368 km as of 31 March 2017.6 In FY2017, \nIndian Railways carried over 8.2 billion passengers and 1.1 billion tons of freight. As of 31 March \n2017, 25,367 route km were electrified out of the total 61,680 route km of broad-gauge network.6  \n \n                                                \n1  Government of India, Ministry of Railways. 2017.

Existing sources of funds for Indian Railways include internal cash generation, sovereign-\nbacked loans from multilateral and bilateral agencies, budgetary support from the government, \njoint ventures with other state-owned enterprises, resource mobilization by undertaking public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships,  commercial  borrowings  from  banks,  financial  institutions,  and  capital \nmarkets. In its effort to mobilize funding from a new avenue, MOR, through IRFC (its fully owned \nand captive financing vehicle), has approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to consider \na nonsovereign loan to meet a part of the funding requirements for railway track electrification. \nThe proposed financing, aimed at supporting key infrastructure development, represents a unique \nopportunity for ADB to engage with a commercially viable and professionally managed state-\nowned enterprise, which has embarked upon a highly ambitious fund-raising plan to support the \ngovernment\u2019s railway modernization aspirations. To ensure success of this initiative, IRFC needs \nto explore all possible sources of long-term financing, including from multilateral development \nbanks. ADB will play a critical role in funding this capital expenditure program. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n6.  Payment structure: The figure below shows the payment structure for the project. ADB \nwill enter into a facility agreement with IRFC. IRFC (the owner of the assets financed by the ADB \nloan) will be entering into a lease agreement with MOR. In addition, ADB, IRFC, and MOR will be \nentering into a substitution agreement. ADB will have substitution rights under the substitution \nagreement, which will enable it to replace IRFC with a nominated company in case of its \nnonperformance.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n7.  Project implementation. For electrification, MOR currently relies on in-house agencies: \nCentral Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE), Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, and railways \nzonal offices, which historically have undertaken the track electrification work. To achieve the \nelectrification target, MOR has increased the number of agencies executing electrification projects \nfrom the existing 3 to 6 by entrusting works to new agencies\u2014the Indian Railway Construction \nCompany Limited, Rail India Techno Economic Service Limited, and the Power Grid Corporation \nof India Limited. CORE was set up in 1979 and since then has been the key executing agency for \nrailway electrification, having electrified 22,522 route km of tracks.7 For the railway tracks to be \nelectrified under the ADB project, CORE would be the implementing agency. \n \n8.  Execution and monitoring strategy. MOR has allocated sections of the track to the \nimplementing agency based on its capacity to implement. Since CORE is the most experienced \nand largest agency, it has secured most of the work, followed by other agencies. CORE and other \nimplementing  agencies  have  been  advised  by  MOR  to  implement  electrification  on  an \nengineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) basis. The selection of the contractor is based \non the contractor\u2019s technical and financial capacity. The EPC contracts awarded are typically lump \nsum, turnkey contracts. EPC contracts follow open tendering and are awarded after completion \nof the predevelopment work such as acquisition of land (if required), procurement of various \nconsents and permits, and completion of design and technical specifications. The technical \nspecifications are provided by the Research Designs and Standards Organisation, which is the \nresearch arm of Indian Railways. Monitoring of the construction activity is undertaken by an \nindependent technical firm and an authorized representative of CORE. \n \n                                                \n7  Central Organisation for Railway Electrification. 2017.

The railway track electrification consists of civil and electrical works (such as traction \noverhead equipment, low-tension supply transformer stations, and others). The project also \ninvolves construction of traction substations and the installation of electricity poles along the \nrailway track.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n10.  Location, land, and project details. A long list of electrification subprojects (sections) is \ncurrently under consideration. These sections are located in 13 states: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, \nBihar,  Chhattisgarh,  Gujarat,  Haryana,  Jharkhand,  Karnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Orissa, \nRajasthan,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  Two  subprojects\u2014Rohtak\u2013Panipat  (location: \nHaryana,  length:  71  route  km,  cost:  \u20b9713  million)  and  Ranchi\u2013Lohardaga\u2013Tori  (location: \nJharkhand,  length:  116  route  km,  cost:  \u20b91,050  million)\u2014have  been  selected  for  the  initial \nsafeguards due diligence, and the due diligence has been completed. Other sections to be funded \nunder the project will be selected from this long list based on a pre-agreed set of screening and \ndue diligence criteria to arrive at approximately 3,378 route km of subprojects. Land required for \nthe traction overhead equipment is owned by Indian Railways and additional land acquisition is \nnot envisaged. However, transmission lines from the nearest feeder substation to the track \nsubstation will involve right-of-way acquisitions. As confirmed by CORE, the transmission line \nworks  from  feeder  substations  to  track  substations  are  executed  by  the  respective  state \ntransmission utility. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n11.  Financing strategy. Based on the average cost of electrification per route km, it is \nestimated that the $750 million of the ADB loan can finance the electrification of approximately \n3,378 route km of existing railway tracks. Debt financing is being structured as a standard secured \nproject finance loan for a tenor of 20 years. \n \n3.  Borrower and Sponsors \n \n12.  Borrower. IRFC was set up in 1986 as the dedicated financing arm of Indian Railways for \nmobilizing  funds  from  domestic  and  international  capital  markets.  It  is  fully  owned  by  the \ngovernment and is registered as a nonbanking finance company. IRFC\u2019s principal business is to \nraise funds from the financial markets to finance the acquisition or creation of assets which are \nthen leased out to MOR. IRFC is rated BBB\u2013 by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Baa2 by \nMoody\u2019s Investors Service, which are at par with India\u2019s sovereign rating, and AAA by all three \ndomestic rating agencies (Crisil, ICRA, and CARE). \n \n13.  Borrower financials. The 3-year historical financials of IRFC are shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Indian Railway Finance Corporation Historical Financials \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n14.  Sponsor. Indian Railways is India\u2019s national railways system operated by MOR. For the \nyear ending 31 March 2017, Indian Railways generated revenues of \u20b91,653 billion, consisting of ", "4 \n \n\u20b91,043 billion in freight earnings, \u20b9463 billion in passenger earnings, and \u20b9147 billion in nonfare \nearnings.8 \n \n15.  Disclosure on ultimate beneficial owners. Integrity due diligence was conducted.9 The \nGovernment of India owns 100% of IRFC through MOR. No significant or potentially significant \nintegrity risks were identified. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n \n16.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impacts: Indian Railways\u2019 goals of (i) \nproviding an efficient, affordable, customer-focused, and environmentally sustainable integrated \ntransportation solution; and (ii) securing at least 10% of its total energy requirements from \nrenewable energy sources such as solar and wind power and biomass by 2020, apart from using \nelectricity from the national grid, which also has a component of clean and renewable energy.10 \nFollowing ADB guidelines to calculate climate change mitigation from projects of this nature, and \ngiven the high grid emission factor of the current Indian electricity grid, no net emission reductions \nfrom the project can be identified at this stage.  However, a significant shift towards renewable \nenergy is expected in the Indian grid mix in coming years. Moreover, the Indian Railways has \nitself made strong commitments to directly source electricity from renewable sources. These two \ndevelopments will contribute to climate change mitigation benefits from the project in the future, \nalthough it is not possible to quantify such benefits at this stage. \n \n17.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: Increased number of passengers \nand cargo transported by electric traction on the additionally electrified tracks. \n \n18.  Output. The output of the project is that 3,378 km of railway routes are electrified. The \nwork related to the electrification will also generate employment for the local community and \nstimulate the local and national economy. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n19.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports \ninfrastructure, one of ADB\u2019s five core operational areas, which are based on ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 \nand  reaffirmed  through  its  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020.11  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 for India is based on three development pillars: (i) boosting economic \ncompetitiveness to create more and better jobs, (ii) inclusive provision of infrastructure networks \nand services, and (iii) addressing climate change and increasing climate resilience.12 The project \nparticularly supports pillars (i) and (ii). \n \n20.  Consistency  with  sector  initiative  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative which defines a sustainable transport \n                                                \n8  Government  of  India,  Indian  Railways.  2018.

In 2011, ADB approved a $500 million multitranche financing facility \nfor the Railway Sector Investment Program.14 Part of tranche 1 within the multitranche financing \nfacility was used towards electrification of 640 km of railway tracks. Lessons learnt from the \nimplementation of the multitranche financing facility have been considered in designing this \nproject. One of the key lessons learnt was that the project implementation gets delayed due to \nland acquisition issues. This lesson has been incorporated in the project design. Initial selection \nof the subprojects will be undertaken to minimize land acquisition, and payment under the lease \nagreement will start on a pre-specified date irrespective of the subproject construction progress.  \n \nD.

Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.15 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Indian Railways initiated the Mission Electrification program with the intention to electrify \n38,000 route km by FY2022. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) regulates the track \nelectrification and has entrusted the following government entities to achieve the target \nset by Indian Railways: Central Organisation for Railway Electrification, Rail Vikas \nNigam Limited, Indian Railway Construction Company, Rail India Techno Economic \nService Limited, Power Grid Corporation, and Indian Railways zonal offices. \nImplementation period  The track electrification work for the project has commenced and will be completed in \nsections. EPC contractors for one of the sections (in Jharkhand) have been appointed. \nBids for the other sections will progressively be called. The construction of all the \nidentified sections, which together comprise the project, is expected to be completed by \nDecember 2022. \nConstruction arrangements  Track electrification will be executed through multiple turnkey EPC contracts, which will \nbe awarded by the Central Organisation for Railway Electrification. Qualified private \ncontractors are expected to undertake the construction responsibility for electrifying each \nspecific section of track. \nOperations arrangements    \nRevenue structure  The Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) will sign a lease agreement with MOR \nunder which IRFC will lease the assets to MOR on a long-term basis. The semiannual \nlease rentals would be sized to cover Asian Development Bank\u2019s loan principal and \ninterest payments, as well as an operating margin to IRFC. \nOperation and  Indian  Railways  will  be  responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the \nmaintenance  electrification assets. \n    Performance monitoring  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, will be reported \nby IRFC and monitored by the Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Indian Railway Finance Corporation. \n \nF.

The 20-year tenor comprises of a 4-year availability period and a 16-year \nrepayment period. Customary project finance security package will be available to ADB. \n \n26.  A proposed technical assistance (TA) grant to Indian Railways, with CORE acting as the \nimplementing agency is being separately processed for ADB internal approval. This TA will help \nbuild capacities on environmental and social safeguards systems required for implementing the \nproposed railway electrification subprojects. The TA support will include deployment of a team of \nconsultants to assist the corporate and subproject teams of CORE in implementing ADB\u2019s \nsafeguards provisions. Through the establishment of an environmental and social management \nsystem and procedures, the TA will strengthen CORE\u2019s position as a safeguards-compliant \norganization with adequate capacities to mitigate and manage environmental and social impacts \nin its railways electrification program. The TA will be implemented over a period of 36 months. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n27.  The value additions of ADB\u2019s assistance are as follows: \n(i)  ADB  is  providing  a  20-year  amortizing  local  currency  loan.  Structuring  the \ntransaction in this manner allows IRFC to match the cash flows from the assets to \nloan repayment with no foreign exchange risk.  \n(ii)  The  aggregate  funding  requirements  of  Indian  Railways  for  its  ongoing \nmodernization program is immense\u2014about $132 billion. ADB\u2019s participation will \nhelp  crowd-in  private  sector  insurance  companies  by  way  of  unfunded  risk \ntransfers, which is an important and new source of mobilization. The precedent set \nthrough this transaction will encourage other private sector institutions to provide \nfinancing to IRFC for its project pipeline. \n(iii)  ADB's  TA  will  help  Indian  Railways  enhance  its  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard evaluation and monitoring systems. This will help Indian Railways \nachieve the international norms for safeguard compliance, thus improving its \naccess to various other international funding sources. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n28.  Lease agreement framework. Under the lease agreement framework, MOR undertakes \nto provide sufficient funds to IRFC to meet its debt service obligations under the ADB loan.    \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n29.  Substitution agreement framework. The substitution agreement will enable ADB to \nnominate a replacement (including itself), which will inherit the rights of IRFC, including receipt of \nlease payments directly from MOR. ADB\u2019s legal advisor has confirmed the enforceability of claims \nunder the substitution agreement provided certain arrangements (included in the conditions \nprecedent to loan signing) are obtained.    \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n30.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) (2009), the project is classified \ncategory B for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \n34.  The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified, and \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated \nin  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans,  that  include  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework, resettlement framework, and indigenous peoples planning framework.18 Preparation of \nsafeguard reports and plans, in line with ADB safeguard requirements, for the entire 3,378 route km \nis not possible at this stage, since the alignments and their designs have not been finalized and \ntherefore there is limited degree of preparedness resulting in appraisal of only two subprojects as a \nfirst step. Initial environmental examinations and resettlement plans for these two identified \nsubprojects (Rohtak\u2013Panipat and Ranchi\u2013Tori sections) were prepared in line with ADB\u2019s SPS \nrequirements  and  reviewed  by  ADB.  An  environmental  compliance  audit  was  additionally \nundertaken as part of the initial environmental examination for ongoing construction projects of \nthe Ranchi\u2013Tori section. Safeguard documents for other subprojects will be prepared by CORE, \non behalf of IRFC, prior to disbursement, to ADB\u2019s satisfaction, and in line with ADB\u2019s safeguard \nframeworks. Subprojects categorized A for any of the three safeguard categories will not be taken \nup for ADB funding. The institutional capacity and commitment of IRFC and CORE to manage \nthe project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n35.  Environmental safeguards. The potential environmental impacts of track electrification \nsubprojects are generally site specific, reversible, and mostly caused by associated construction \nactivities.  These  impacts  typically  include  land  and  vegetation  clearing  for  site  preparation, \ntransportation and delivery of equipment and materials, and excavation and laying of foundations \nfor electricity poles and transmission towers. Issues may potentially include occupational and \ncommunity  health  and  safety  during  the  construction  phase,  which  includes  short-term  and \nlocalized generation of dust, air emission, noise, wastes, soil erosion, and water pollution. There \nare  no  protected  areas  or  environmentally  sensitive  areas  along  these  two  corridors.  The \ntransmission lines will be aligned through agricultural or government land avoiding residential \nareas or lands, and any impacts on forests or water bodies. Recommended mitigation measures \nto address the project environmental impacts are presented in the environmental management \nplan and will be monitored. IRFC through CORE commits to implement the corrective actions \n                                                \n16 India\u2019s sovereign rating is upgraded by Moody\u2019s from Baa3 to Baa2, with outlook changed from positive to stable. \n17  Sources: (i) S&P Global Ratings.

The respective state power \ntransmission agencies will implement the transmission lines. \n \n36.  Social safeguards. The railways electrification will be carried out along the existing tracks \nwithin  land  owned  by  Indian  Railways  and  is  unlikely  to  result  in  physical  or  economic \ndisplacement impacts. New facilities such as traction substations and sectioning and paralleling \nposts will be located on railway land. No permanent land acquisition will be carried out for the \ntransmission line alignments. These alignments will be finalized to avoid impacts on structures \nand permanent assets and minimize impacts on agricultural land. Compensation for temporary \ndamage to crops and trees will be paid at replacement costs to the landowners. In addition, IRFC, \nthrough CORE and the state power transmission agencies, commits to implement the guidelines \nof the Ministry of Power of the Government of India to compensate 85% of the land value for the \nfootprint of the transmission towers and 15% of the land value for the corridor impacted by the \nstringing of the transmission lines. A section of the 8.8 km transmission line for the Ranchi\u2013Tori \nsubproject passes through scheduled areas occupied by tribal groups. The impacts will be limited \nto temporary crop damage during construction.
