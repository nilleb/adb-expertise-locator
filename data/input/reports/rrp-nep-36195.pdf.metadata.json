The \neconomy experienced a sharp downturn from the impact of a series of \ninternal  shocks,  deterioration  in  the  domestic  security  situation, \npolitical instability, and adverse developments in the global economy. \nThe  economic  scenario  deteriorated  sharply  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2002, \nwith  a  negative  growth  rate  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  that \nseverely  strained  Government  finances.  The  deteriorating  economic \nsituation  coincides  with  the  initiation  of  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan \n(10FYP)  covering  FY2003\u2013FY2007,  which  is  also  the  Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction strategy (PRS).   \n \nBuilding  on  the  lessons  learned  from  the  past,  the  10FYP  refocuses \nthe poverty reduction program with a strategy based on four pillars of \ndevelopment:  broad-based  and  sustainable  economic  growth,  social \nthe  poor  and \ntargeted  programs \nsector  development, \ndisadvantaged, and good governance. The 10FYP aims to reduce the \nincidence of poverty to 30% from the current level of 38%, along with \nsignificant  improvements  in  key  human  development  indicators  such \nas rising literacy rate, reduced infant mortality, higher life expectancy, \nand increased access to sanitation and safe drinking water, especially \nin  the  rural  areas.  The  10FYP\u2019s  development  strategy  is  closely \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  PRS  and  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program \nUpdate (CSPU) for Nepal.  \n \nThe  medium-term  economic  outlook  remains  uncertain  due  to  further \ndeterioration in the global economic and political environment. In view \nof  the  current  uncertainties  regarding  the  growth  prospects  of  the \neconomy,  the  outlook  for  revenue  mobilization,  and  the  large  regular \n(current) expenditure, the Government is unable to mobilize adequate \nresources  for  implementing  the  poverty  reduction  program  of  the \n10FYP.  Consequently,  planned  development  expenditure  in  FY2003 \nhad  to  be  sharply  curtailed,  impacting  negatively  on  the  poverty \nreduction efforts. However, the domestic political and security situation \nimproved  recently.  On  29  January  2003,  the  Government  and  the \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nfinal  peace  agreement \n\nis  reached.  Meanwhile, \n\nimproved  recently.  On  29  January  2003,  the  Government  and  the \nUnderground Communist Party of Nepal/Maoist (CPN/M) agreed on a \ncease-fire,  and  are  now  engaged  in  negotiations  for  lasting  peace. \nWhile the peace efforts are making good progress, it will be some time \nthe \nbefore  a \nGovernment  is  acutely  conscious  that  despite  current  uncertainties, \npolicy  measures  need  to  be  pursued  to  attain  rapid  and  sustained \nreduction  in  poverty,  and  to  lay  the  foundations  for  sustainable  pro-\npoor  growth.  This  is  all  the  more  important  since  Nepal  is  one  of  the \npoorest countries in the world, in terms of both per capita GDP and the \noverall levels of social indicators.  \n \nIn  March  2002,  the  Government  requested  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  for  assistance  in  implementing  the  Public  Sector  Management \nProgram  (PSMP).  The  Government  and  ADB  have  since  then  held \nextensive  discussions  on  the  objectives,  scope,  structure,  and  the \ntiming of the PSMP. Discussions were also held with the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and bilateral donors, after which an \nunderstanding  was  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  main \nelements of the PSMP. In view of the current economic situation and \ntaking into account the medium-term economic outlook, the proposed \nPSMP will address the major constraints hampering implementation of \nthe 10FYP and, therefore, has the full commitment of the Government.  \n \nThe  PSMP  aims  to  support  poverty  reduction  by  facilitating  the \nimplementation of the Government\u2019s PRS embodied in the 10FYP. To \nachieve  the  objective,  the  PSMP  will  address  some  key  policy  and \ninstitutional  constraints  to  strengthen  the  Government's  resource \nposition over the medium term, and lay the foundation for acceleration \nof  pro-poor  growth.  The  PSMP  will  focus  on  reforms  related  to  (i) \nstrengthening the fiscal position of the Government, (ii) facilitating the \nGovernment\u2019s \n(PE) \nmanagement  and  ownership,  and  (iii)  strengthening  public  and \ncorporate  sector  governance.  The  PSMP  will  also  support  the \nimplementation  of  the  Immediate  Action  Plan  (IAP)  and  will  be \nconsistent  with  the  macroeconomic  framework  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment and IMF. \n \nThe Asian Development \nBank Loan \n \n\nObjective and \nScope \n\ndisengagement \n\nenterprise \n\npublic \n\nfrom \n\nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  24,649,000  ($35 \nmillion equivalent) be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Sector  Management  Program.  The \nloan will have a maturity period of 24 years, including a grace period of \n8 years. The loan will have an interest charge of 1% during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  thereafter,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  standard \nprocedures,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan \nAgreement. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProgram \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursements \n\nUtilization of the \nLoan \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n\nv\n\nimplementation  of \n\nDiscussions with the Government began in May 2002, and agreement \non  the  package  of  policy  reforms  for  the  PSMP  was  reached  in  June \n2002.  The  Government  started  implementing  agreed-upon policies in \nJuly  2002,  the  beginning  of  its  fiscal  year.  However,  due  to  political \nuncertainty in Nepal, particularly around October\u2013November 2002, the \nAppraisal  Mission  was  not  fielded  and  therefore  the  PSMP  was  not \nfinalized  for  Board  consideration  in  2002.  Nevertheless,  since  the \nGovernment  has  been  implementing  the  reform  policies  under  the \nproposed  PSMP  since  July  2002,  the  program  period  will  span  2.5 \nyears, from July 2002 to December 2004. The loan is in two tranches. \nThe  first  tranche  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  14,085,000  ($20  million \nequivalent) will be released upon compliance with the policy conditions \nspecified  in  the  policy  matrix  and  loan  effectiveness.  The  second \ntranche of Special Drawing  Rights 10,564,000 ($15 million equivalent) \nwill be released after the policy conditions specified in the policy matrix \nhave  been  satisfactorily  complied  with.  The  second  tranche  is \nexpected  to  be  released  approximately  15  months  after  the  first \ntranche. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the \nPSMP. To oversee implementation, a program coordination committee \n(PCC) chaired by the Chief Secretary has been established. MOF has \nestablished  a  program  implementation  unit  (PIU)  to  ensure  timely \nthe  program  measures.  A \npreparation  and \nthe \n(PCSC)  under \nprivatization  coordination  sub-committee \nprivatization  committee \nthe \nin \nliquidation/privatization of PEs.  \n \nfollowing  normal  commercial \nEligible \nprocurement  practices  and  procedures  of  the  private  sector,  or  the \nprescribed procurement procedures of the Government, acceptable to \nADB.  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  in \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \naccordance  with \nDisbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program \nLoans.  All  goods  to  be  financed  out  of  the  loan  will  be  produced  and \nprocured from ADB member countries. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  cost \n(excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  a  broad  range  of  imports  other \nthan  those  specified  in  the  ineligible  list  (Appendix  7),  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n \nThe loan will be disbursed during the Program period i.e. by December \n2004. However, program activities will cover a three-year period, up to \n30 June 2005 (loan closing date). \n \nThe  counterpart  funds  generated  in  local  currency  from  the  loan \nproceeds will be deposited in a special counterpart fund account to be \nestablished  by  MOF  at  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  (Central  Bank),  and  will \nbecome  part  of  the  Government  budget.  MOF  will  decide  on  the \nallocation  of  the  counterpart  funds  and  will  closely  monitor their use. \nThe Government will ensure that the counterpart funds are available to \n\nitems  will  be  procured \n\nin  MOF  will  assist \n\n(PC) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nTechnical \nAssistance \n \n\nRisks and \nSafeguards \n\nThe Government will ensure that the counterpart funds are available to \nmeet  the  costs  associated  with  the  implementation  of  the  PSMP,  in \nparticular,  (i)  the  payment  of  all  dues  to  staff  of  PEs  relating  to  or \nfollowing  retrenchment,  whether  as  a  result  of  statutory  provisions  or \notherwise;  this  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  wages  in  arrears,  and \nother  benefits  such  as  pension  contributions  and  severance  benefits; \n(ii) payment of other liabilities of liquidated PEs; and (iii) administrative \ncosts to implement the Program.  \n \nTechnical assistance (TA) will be provided to help the Government (i) \ndevelop  and  implement  an  effective  privatization/liquidation  process, \n(ii)  build  capacity  within  the  Government  for  undertaking divestment, \n(iii) manage and supervise the transactions, (iv) implement an effective \nand  fair  policy  for  labor  retrenchment,  and  (v)  support  overall \nmanagement  of  the  Program.  The  TA  will  cost  $425,000,  and  will  be \nfinanced  under  the  ADB-funded  TA  Program.  DFID  envisages \nproviding  supplementary  support  of  up  to  $1.2  million  to  finance  the \nexpertise required for individual PE liquidation and sale transactions.1  \n \nThe PSMP assumes that the fiscal situation will not deteriorate further \nto  require  a  bigger  cut  in  development  expenditure,  and  thereby \nadversely affect the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy. \nThis  could  happen  due  to  extraneous  reasons,  such  as  worsening  of \nthe  global  economic  environment,  over  which  the  Government  has \nlittle  control.  Alternatively,  weak  domestic  economic  performance \ncould reduce revenue mobilization. However, by prioritizing projects in \naccordance  with  their  poverty  reduction  impact,  the  Government  will, \nto  a  large  extent,  be  able  to  mitigate  the  serious  impact  on  poverty \nreduction  efforts.  Simultaneously,  the  PSMP  will  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s revenue mobilization efforts. Another risk is whether the \nGovernment  will  have  adequate  political  will  to  drop  low-priority \nprojects,  and  thereby  increase  the  effectiveness  of  development \nexpenditure. The Government has already displayed its determination \nto manage public resources more efficiently by reducing the number of \ndevelopment  projects  by  25%  in  FY2003.  Similarly,  the  Government \nhas  renewed  its  efforts  to  reform  PEs  and  has  made  a  public \ncommitment to this effect during the Nepal Development Forum 2002. \nThis  commitment  was  reiterated  in  the  FY2003  budget  and  the \nEconomic  Reforms  Program  announced \nIn \npursuance  of  this  objective,  under  the  PSMP,  the  Government  will \nliquidate/privatize nine PEs. To streamline the divestment process, the \nGovernment  has  established  a  PCSC  in  the  MOF  under  the \nPrivatization Committee. Successive administrations have made good \nprogress with governance reforms and the PSMP will push the reform \nagenda forward in certain key areas.   \n\nin  October  2002. \n\n \n\nThe  Government,  in  the  past,  has  demonstrated  a  positive  attitude \ntoward  reform  agreements  with  international  development  partners. \n\n                                                 \n1  In the event that the DFID support does not materialize, the Government will use its own resources to finance the \nconsultants for PE liquidation and sale transactions by allocating $0.6 million each in the budgets of FY2004 and \nFY2005. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nvii \n\nin \n\nimplementing \n\nIndeed,  during \nthe  PSMP. \nthe  PSMP,  discussions  were  held  with \n\nThe  political  instability  caused  by  frequent  changes  in  Government \nand  the  internal  unrest  have  adversely  affected  the  Government\u2019s \nability  to  implement  reforms  effectively  and  at  the  required  pace.  The \nsituation  is  likely  to  change  as  the  Government  and  the  CPN/M  are \nworking  toward  a  negotiated  settlement.  Prospects  are  good  that \nlasting  peace  will  be  established.  Peace  will  considerably  reduce  the \nthe \nrisk  of  delay \npreparation  of \nthe \nrepresentatives of the opposition political parties, labor unions, and aid \nagencies. There is support for the PSMP\u2019s objectives, both within and \noutside  the  Government.  This  commitment  is  expected  to  continue \ndespite the change in Government in June 2003, when the incumbent \nPrime Minister resigned. There is unanimity of opinion that to meet the \nobjectives  of  the  10FYP,  the  pace  of  reforms  must  be  significantly \naccelerated,  and  the  PSMP  will  play  a  catalytic  role  in  the  process. \nGiven  the  successive  Governments\u2019  political  commitment  to  reforms, \nthe  implementation  arrangements  agreed  upon  with  the  current \nGovernment  will  ensure  timely  implementation  of  the  PSMP.  The \nGovernment has established the PIU in MOF with adequate staff, who \nhave  the  capacity  to  implement  and  monitor  the  agreed  upon  reform \nmeasures.  In  addition,  the  PCSC,  under  the  Privatization  Committee, \nwill  manage  the  implementation  of  the  agreed  upon  PE  reform \nmeasures.  TA-financed  consultants  will  assist  the  Government  in \nprivatizing/liquidating  PEs  and  will  also  create  critical  capacity within \nthe Government to undertake future divestment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n1. \n I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Public Sector Management Program. The report also describes \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  Government  Disengagement  from  Public \nEnterprises  (PEs),  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the proposed TA. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\nCurrent Macroeconomic Problems  \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \n Nepal has been facing a sharp economic downturn since mid-2001 from the impacts of \ninternal  shocks,  especially  the  deaths  of  members  of  the  royal  family  in  June  2001  and  the \nupsurge  of  the  conflict  with  the  Underground  Communist  Party  of  Nepal/Maoist (CPN/M). The \neconomic scenario further deteriorated in FY2002 due to the 11 September events in the United \nStates,  the  global  economic  slowdown,  and  the  continued  escalation  of  insurgency  and  the \nresulting political instability. These disruptions adversely affected the performance of a number \nof key sectors, especially manufacturing, tourism, and exports. Gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth  declined  sharply  and  the  Government\u2019s  finances  came  under  severe  strain.  The \ndeteriorating  economic  situation  coincided  with  the  initiation  of  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan \n(10FYP) covering FY2003\u2013FY 2007, which is also the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy \n(PRS).  The  current  economic  situation  is  severely  constraining  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to \npursue a coherent poverty reduction agenda outlined in the 10FYP. \n \n3. \nGDP growth in FY2001 remained favorable although it slipped to 4.6% from the target of \n6%.  Economic  performance  deteriorated  precipitously  in  FY2002,  with  economic  growth \nestimated at minus 0.5% due to the worsening internal security situation, unfavorable weather \nconditions, and weak external demand. The agriculture sector grew by 2.2%, down from 5.5% in \nFY2001,  due  to  irregular  monsoon  rains  in  June\u2013August  2001.  The  performance  of  exports, \ntourism, and domestic manufacturing was also poor. These sectors were particularly hard hit by \ndomestic insurgency as well as by the global economic slowdown. \n \n4. \nExports declined by 18% in FY2002 after an annual average growth of 21% during the \nlast  3  years.  Key  merchandise  exports  such  as  woolen  carpets,  ready-made garments, and \npashmina products declined significantly due to supply disruptions as well as the slowdown in \ndemand  abroad.  Simultaneously,  tourist  arrivals  in  FY2002  declined  by  about  40%,  which \nresulted in an estimated 34% decline in receipts from tourism, a major source of the country\u2019s \nforeign exchange earnings. \n \n5. \nThe impact of the slowdown in exports and tourism on the overall balance of payments \nwas  more  than  offset  by  a  drop  in  imports  and  a  steady  growth  of  workers\u2019  remittances  from \nabroad.  Imports  are  estimated  to  have  declined  by  about  11.4%  in  FY2002  due  to  lower \ndemand  for  industrial  raw  materials,  lower  oil  prices,  and  reduced  aid-related  imports. \nRemittances, on the other hand, increased by 14.8% due to the increased number of workers \ngoing  abroad.  As  a  consequence,  the  surplus  on  current  account  of  the  balance  of  payments \nincreased  from  1%  of  GDP  in  FY2001  to  2.6%  of  GDP  in  FY2002.  The  overall  balance  of \npayments is estimated to have worsened from a surplus of $37 million in FY2001 to a deficit of \n$32  million  in  FY2002  due  to  a  significant  decline  in  foreign  loans  (a  drop  of  about  32%  in \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n\nFY2002)1.  Despite  the  deterioration  in  external  accounts,  gross  official  reserves at the end of \nFY2002  remained  at  a  comfortable  level  of  $1.05  billion,  equivalent  to  about  7  months  of \nimports. \n \nThe  sharp  deceleration  in  the  growth  rate  of  the  economy  in  FY2002  had  a  major \n6. \nnegative impact on the Government\u2019s fiscal position. Because of disruption in manufacturing, fall \nin imports, and sharp downturn in tourism, revenue collections were only NRs50.5 billion (12% \nof  GDP).  Revenue  collections  deteriorated  despite  the  Government\u2019s  special  revenue \nmobilization measures, including the introduction of a voluntary income disclosure scheme, and \nmidcourse  adjustments  to  several  tax  rates.  At  the  same  time,  regular  expenditure  increased \nsharply  (from  NRs42.7  billion  in  FY2001  to  NRs46.8  billion  in  FY2002)  due  mainly  to  an \nincrease  to  NRs13.3  billion  in  security  related  spending,  about  NRs2  billion  more  than  the \nallocation  in  the  FY2002  budget.  Virtually  no  surplus  was  left  in  the  budget  to  finance \ndevelopment  expenditure  from  the  Government\u2019s  own  resources.  To  keep  the  fiscal  deficit \nwithin  sustainable  limits,  development  expenditure  was  curtailed  sharply  to  NRs30.6  billion, \ncompared with NRs50 billion allocated in the FY2002 budget (a 39% reduction) and an actual \nspending  of  NRs37  billion  in  FY2001.  Financing  this  considerably  reduced  development \nexpenditure required domestic borrowings of NRs13.9 billion (3.3% of GDP) compared with the \nbudgeted  amount  of  NRs9  billion  (2.0%  of  GDP)  and  foreign  borrowings  of  NRs10.9  billion  in \nFY2002.  With  the  drastic  reduction  in  development  expenditure,  the  fiscal  deficit  (including \ngrants) in FY2002 was contained at 5.4% of GDP.  \n \nB. \n\nShort- to Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook \n\n \n\n  Macroeconomic  prospects  in  the  short  to  medium  term  depend  largely  on  how  the \n7. \nsecurity and political scenarios develop. Current indications are that the security situation should \nimprove as the Government and the CPN/M are making a serious effort to reach a negotiated \nsettlement. Assuming an improved security situation, and considering the sectoral trends in the \ncurrent year, GDP growth in FY2003 is projected at around 2%. This is considerably lower than \nthe  targets  of  the  10FYP  (paras.  10\u201314).  Despite  some  signs  of  recovery,  manufacturing  is \nexpected  to  remain  depressed  until  the  security  problems  are  resolved.  Uncertainties  about \nexternal demand in both India and third countries are also affecting the sector\u2019s output. A major \nupturn  in  tourism  is  unlikely  unless  the  security  environment  significantly  improves.  Growth  in \nagriculture will continue to depend on the vagaries of weather.  \n \n8. \nGiven  these  uncertainties,  it  is  doubtful  whether  the  Government  could  mobilize \nadequate resources for implementing the poverty reduction program of the 10FYP. The FY2003 \nbudget  (the  first  year  of  the  10FYP)  proposed  a  total  expenditure  of  NRs96  billion  (23%  more \nthan FY2002): NRs57 billion for regular (current) expenditure, and NRs39 billion of development \nexpenditure.  Regular  expenditure,  which  is  projected  to  increase  by  20%  over  FY2002,  has \nlimited  scope  for  pruning  since  it  comprises  mainly  payments  for  wages,  servicing  debt \nobligations, and security-related expenditures. While the budget projected mobilization revenue \nof NRs57 billion (12.2% of GDP), the mid-term budget review by the Government indicated that \nthe revenue mobilization will be around NRs53.5 billion. This means that the revenue would be \ninsufficient to finance even the regular expenditure and that the entire development expenditure \nin  FY2003  will  essentially  be  financed  either  by  foreign  resources  or  by  domestic borrowings. \nThe  budget  also  anticipated  a  significant  increase  in  foreign  assistance  and  domestic \nborrowings  to  finance  development  expenditure.  Foreign  grants  were  projected  at  NRs14.6 \nbillion (a 67% increase compared with FY2002), foreign loans of  NRs12.4 billion, and domestic \n\n                                                 \n1  Foreign grants are estimated to have declined by 14% in FY2002 compared with FY2001.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\nThe Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy \n\nborrowing of NRs12 billion (2.6% of GDP). The midterm review of the FY2003 budget noted a \nsignificant  shortfall  and  revised  both  domestic  revenue  collection  and  external  financing \ndownward  by  5%  and  24%  respectively,  causing  a  significant  23%  drop  in  development \nexpenditure.  Domestic  borrowing  is  now  targeted  at  NRs12.5  billion  (equivalent  to  2.8%  of \nGDP).  The  fiscal  deficit  is  currently  projected  at  5.3%  of  GDP,  slightly  higher  than  the  5.2% \nprojected in the budget. \n \n9. \nThe  Government  finances  are  in  a  precarious  situation.  Any  slippage  in  revenue \nmobilization  or  increase  in  security-related  expenditure  squeezes  development  expenditure \nfurther and makes it difficult for the Government to pursue its poverty reduction agenda. While \nthe  FY2003  budget  proposed  some  additional  revenue  mobilization  measures,  including \nrationalizing certain tax exemptions and adjusting some tax rates upward, meeting the medium-\nterm  revenue  mobilization  targets  would  depend  critically  on  a  marked  improvement  in  tax \nadministration.  \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe  10FYP,  which  is  also  the  Government\u2019s  PRS,  was  approved  in  January  2003.  It \naims  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  poverty  to  30%  from  the  current  level  of  38%.2      Building  on \nlessons learned, the 10FYP refocuses the poverty reduction program with a strategy based on \nfour  pillars  of  development:  broad-based  and  sustainable  economic  growth,  social  sector \ndevelopment, targeted programs for the poor and disadvantaged, and good governance. \n \n11. \nThe 10FYP aims to speed up the rate of broad-based economic growth to an average of \n6.2%  per  annum.  The  pattern  of  resource  allocation  has  a  distinct  poverty  focus.  Agriculture, \nwhich  provides  employment  to  about  80%  of  the  population,  has  been  allocated  24%  of  total \ndevelopment spending (from 19% during the 9FYP), in view of its direct impact on the welfare of \nthe  poor  and  vulnerable.  The  social  sectors  have  been  allocated  38.5%  of  total  development \nspending compared with 36.5% in the 9FYP. The amount will facilitate increased investments in \nbasic  education,  health,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation,  along  with  improved  decentralized \nservice  delivery  mechanisms.  To  address  the  resource  disparities  and  social  discrimination \nfaced  by  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  groups,  the  10FYP  will  set  up  through  various  targeted \nprograms  for  their  upliftment,  create  employment  opportunities,  and  provide  basic  security. \nSpecial schemes have been designed specifically to benefit isolated communities. Development \nof  the  private  sector  is  a  key  element  of  the  poverty  reduction  agenda.  The  10FYP  aims  to \ncreate an enabling legal and policy environment for the private sector, and facilitate withdrawal \nof  Government  involvement  in  areas  that  are  commercially  viable.  Promotion  of  good \ngovernance will involve enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the civil service; promoting \ndecentralization;  strengthening  local  bodies,  and  nongovernment  and  community-based \norganizations; improving corporate governance; and promoting the role of civil society. \n \n12. \nThe  10FYP  is  a  major  departure  from  past  plans  in  its  sharp  focus  on  monitorable \nobjectives.  At  the  same  time  it  raises  the  standards  of  accountability  and  provides  more \nflexibility  to  the  ministries  to  plan  and  adopt  different  modalities  for  achieving  its  objectives.  A \nsystematic  framework  that  has  been  developed  to  facilitate  implementation  will  allow  better \nfocus  on  the  linkage  between  objectives,  outcomes,  and  performance  indicators.  Close \nmonitoring of progress is another important difference from the past. The Government is in the \n\n                                                 \n2  Based  on  the  Government\u2019s  midterm  review  of  the  9FYP.  The  10FYP  Summary,  National  Planning  Commission, \nNepal  (January  2003),  also  states  that  the  Government\u2019s  target  is  to  further  reduce  poverty  to  10%  in  about  15 \nyears. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n \n\nprocess of enhancing capacity in the National Planning Commission to effectively undertake this \nactivity. More importantly, the 10FYP was developed in a consultative manner with stakeholders \nat  community,  village,  district  and  national  levels.  The  stakeholders  included  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  professional  organizations, \npolicy  makers,  political  parties,  and  aid  agencies.  The  Government  has  expressed  its \ncommitment to continue the consultative process during implementation. \n \n13. \nThe  10FYP  seeks  to  focus  scarce  resources  on  poverty  reduction  measures  through \neffective public expenditure management. It has prioritized development projects based on a set \nof  criteria  reflecting  a  direct  link  to  poverty  reduction,  sectoral  priority,  need  for  Government \ninvolvement, extent to which local bodies are involved, previous performance of the project, and \nthe scope for private sector involvement. The Government has already started prioritizing public \ninvestments  through  a  3-year  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  (MTEF),  designed  to \nanchor  the  10FYP  to  a  realistic  projection  of  resource  availability  in  the  annual  budgets. \nAccordingly, starting with the budgeting exercise of FY2003, the Government has cut or merged \n160  low-priority  development  projects.  The  remaining  projects  have  been  classified  in  three \ncategories: P1, P2, and P3. Of the development budget, about 59% has been allocated to P1, \n33% to P2, and 8% to P3 projects. In the event of a shortfall in resources, priority will be given \nto  categories  P1  and  P2.  This  prioritization  will  help  rationalize  the  government\u2019s  portfolio  of \ndevelopment projects to a manageable size, prevent wastage of public resources, and ensure \nadequate  funding  for  high-priority  projects.  The  gap  between  the  aggregate  expenditure \nrequired to meet the 10FYP targets and realistic projections of revenue mobilization (including \ndomestic  borrowing)  is  cumulatively  estimated  to  be  $350  million  per  annum,  over  the  next  5 \nyears.  External  resource  inflow  (grants  plus  loans)  over  the  last  5  years  has  averaged  $250 \nmillion per annum. This means that if poverty reduction targets are to be met, the Government \nwill need to further streamline and prioritize expenditure, improve resource mobilization efforts, \nstrengthen  service  delivery,  and,  on  evidence  of  its  improved  performance,  seek  additional \nexternal resources.  \n \n14. \nSuccessful  implementation  of  the  10FYP  depends  on  certain  key  assumptions,  and \nthere  are  inevitable  risks  these  assumptions  may  not  be  entirely  realized.  In  particular,  the \nrestoration  of  internal  law  and  order  could  take  longer  than  currently  estimated,  resource \nconstraints  could  continue  to  hamper  development  efforts,  and  the  recovery  of  the  global \neconomy  could  become  more  uncertain.  A  combination  of  these  factors  would  slow  down \neconomic  recovery  in  Nepal,  lower  investments  in  development  projects,  and  correspondingly \nreduce the poverty impact of the 10FYP. Recognizing these factors, the 10FYP has developed \nan alternative scenario, which projects an average GDP growth rate of 4.3% per annum, and a \nper capita income increase of a mere 2.0% per annum. In the low-growth scenario, both savings \nand  investment  ratios  are  lower  and  external  resource  inflows  are  somewhat  reduced.  With \nlower growth and social sector investments, poverty reduction would be significantly lower.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \nIn  response  to  the  current  fiscal  difficulties  and  the  critical  need  to  improve  delivery  of \nbasic  public  services,  the  Government  implemented  the  Immediate  Action  Plan  (IAP)  in  2002, \nincorporating  some  of  the  core  elements  of  the  10FYP 3.  IAP  2002  focused  on  prioritizing \n                                                 \n3   The FY2003 budget speech states: \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s Government has formulated Immediate Action Plan and started \nits  implementation  with  the  objective  of  prioritization  of  public  resources  in  order  to  provide  immediate  relief  to \nNepalese people and reduce poverty, envisaged as the main agenda in the 10FYP. The Action Plan also aims to \nimprove  the  quality  of  public  services  and  transparency  and  accountability\u201d  (para.  16  of  the  Public  Statement  on \nIncome and Expenditure of the Fiscal Year 2002\u20132003, His Majesty\u2019s Government, Ministry of Finance, 2002). \n\nImmediate Action Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\nRecent Economic Policy Initiatives \n\nexpenditure,  especially  development  expenditure,  to  improve  service  delivery  and  enhance \ntransparency  and  accountability.  IAP  2002  sought  to  allocate  resources  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  decentralization  policy.  As  a  result,  there  were  no  budgetary  cuts  in  the  block \ngrants to local bodies in the FY2003 budget. Furthermore, funds were channeled through local \nbodies  for  activities  related  to  agriculture  extension,  sub-health  posts,  and  basic  and  primary \neducation.  The  Government  has  also  developed  a  poverty-based  formula for allocating block \ngrants to the local bodies.  \n \nIn  pursuance  of  the  decentralization  policy,  the  Government  also  transferred  the \n16. \nadministration  of  public  primary  schools  and  sub-health  posts  to  local  communities  on  a  pilot \nbasis.    The  Government  also  froze  the  recruitment  of  primary  school  teachers  and  gave  this \nresponsibility  to  the  school  management  committees.  The  Government  decided  on  11 \nSeptember  2002  to  eliminate  about  7,500  vacant  civil  service  positions  to  rightsize  the \nbureaucracy.  To  increase  transparency  and  accountability,  IAP  2002  encouraged  the  line \nagencies,  local  bodies,  schools,  and  health  posts  to  publish  quarterly  reports  of  budget \nallocations  and  actual  expenditure.  The  Government  is  also  in  the  process  of  establishing  an \nexpenditure tracking system to ensure that allocated funds reach the point of service delivery. \nThe  Government  developed  an  anticorruption  strategy  and  is  currently  preparing  a  detailed \naction  plan.  In  view  of  good  progress  in  implementing  some  core  elements  of  the  10FYP \nthrough  IAP  2002,  the  Government  is  currently  preparing  IAP  2003  in  consultation  with  its \ndevelopment  partners  to  further  improve  public  expenditure  management,  service  delivery, \ngovernance, and targeting public investments to the poor and disadvantaged. \n \nE. \n \nThere  have  been  some  recent  initiatives  in  the  Economic  Reforms  Program  of  2002.4 \n17. \nThe Government is in the process of strengthening the Central Monitoring Unit of the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), and a program is being initiated for monitoring revenue offices and will conduct \nregular  market  surveys,  more  effective  supervision  to  ensure  that  the  targeted  collection  of \nrevenue materializes. Teams including representatives of the private sector will conduct regular \nmarket surveys to broaden the tax network. The Government also plans to adopt postclearance \naudit  of  customs  valuation,  with  the  proviso  that  undervalued  imported  goods  will  be \nconfiscated. Customs data are being automated in three more points of entry of imported goods \nin Kakarbitta, Krishnanagar, and Tatopani. For more effective implementation of the Income Tax \nAct  of  2002,  the  Government  is  in  the  process  of  adopting  simplified  returns,  and  preparing \nmanuals, pamphlets, and brochures to better explain the provisions of the Act. Greater private \nsector involvement is being sought to make tax administration more effective and transparent. \nThe  Department  of  Internal  Revenue  will  be  provided  with  more  resources  to  stop  revenue \nleakages, and to initiate special investigation and control programs. The Government also plans \nto reduce in FY2003 and FY2004 the number of goods exempted from value added tax (VAT) \nand bring them under the tax net gradually. \n \n18. \nThe  Government  has  announced  that  its  decision  to  adhere  to  strict  austerity  while \nensuring  adequate  funding  for  priority  projects  will  continue.  Further,  priority  will  be  given  to \nreleasing budgetary resources for basic social sector requirements such as education, health, \nand  drinking  water.  Simultaneously,  a  strict  check  will  be  kept  on  employment  in  the \nGovernment  and  redundant  positions  will  be  eliminated  in  FY2003.  Austerity  measures  have \nbeen  introduced  for  expenditure  on  seminars  and  conferences,  travel  abroad  by  Government \nservants, medical allowances, procurement of vehicles and furniture, and building construction. \n                                                 \n4\n  Economic Reforms Program. 2002.Kathmandu: His Majesty\u2019s Government, Ministry of Finance. 31 October 2002. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\n \n\n \nEfficient  and  effective  management  of  public  sector  resources  is  a  major  challenge  in \n19. \nachieving  the  goals  of  the  10FYP.  Since  the  current  resources  of  the  Government  are \ninadequate,  improving  the  fiscal  position  of  the  Government  requires  immediate  efforts  to \nincrease resource mobilization and prioritize expenditure, reduce the growing budgetary burden \non  account  of  substantial  losses  and  contingent  liabilities  due  to  the  persistent  poor \nperformance of public enterprises (PEs), and improve governance so that public resources are \nmore effectively managed. The Government has initiated several reform measures over the last \n2  years  for  strengthening  resource  mobilization,  prioritizing  expenditure,  and  improving \ngovernance.  Progress  on  the  Government\u2019s  disengagement  from  PEs,  however,  has  been \nvirtually  stalled  over  the  last  5  years  due  to  the  unstable  political  environment,  inadequate \ninstitutional arrangements, and insufficient resources to settle the dues to the concerned parties. \nThe Government has, however, reaffirmed in the FY2003 budget statement and more recently \nin  the  Economic  Reforms  Program  of  October  2002  that  management  of  PEs  has  become \nburdensome in the context of the fiscal problems, and that disengagement from them needs to \nbe more actively pursued.   \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\nRevenue Mobilization and Expenditure Management  \n\n1. \n  \n20. \nOver the last 2 years, the Government has adopted several measures aimed at reducing \ntax-induced  distortions,  strengthening  tax  administration,  and  making  the  tax  laws  and \nprocedures simpler and more transparent. The Income Tax Act of 2001 broadened the tax base \nsignificantly,  rationalized  the  tax  structure  by  reducing  the  number  of  tax  slabs  to  two,  and \nestablished  neutrality  of  taxation  in  various  income-generating  activities.  A  self-assessment \nsystem  for  taxpayers  has  been  implemented  to  further  streamline  tax  administration. \nAmendments  have  been  made  to  the  VAT  Act,  which  now  requires  better  maintenance  of \nrecords  and  has  more  explicit  penal  provisions  for  noncompliance.    VAT  coverage  has  been \nexpanded to include services and retail trade enterprises. Similarly, the Excise Act of 2002 aims \nat  harmonizing  and  updating  excise  administration  and  expanding  the  coverage  of  the  excise \nnet. A Customs Act amendment has been drafted to implement the World Trade Organization \n(WTO) valuation system and to reform customs administration. The structure of key taxes has \nbeen rationalized: the maximum marginal tax rate for the personal income tax and the corporate \ntax has been set at 25% (banks, financial institutions, insurance and petroleum companies pay \na maximum marginal tax rate of 30%), there are seven slabs of customs tariffs5 although over \n75% of imports are taxed at 15% or less, and there is a single VAT rate of 10%. \n \n21. \nA  number  of  other  measures  aim  to  streamline  tax  administration.  An  Inland  Revenue \nDepartment  (IRD)  was  established  by  merging  the  erstwhile  Department  of  Taxation  and the \nValue  Added  Tax  Department.  This  merger  is  expected  to  increase  efficiency,  improve \nenforcement,  and  reduce  administrative  cost.  Twenty-one inland revenue offices (IROs) were \nset up in the field to expand the reach of the tax system. The Government also expanded the \nPermanent Account Number (PAN) system, and efforts are ongoing to integrate both VAT and \nincome tax under the PAN system to simplify administrative procedures. The use of information \ntechnology  has  been  expanded  to  strengthen  tax  administration.  Many  of  the  tax  reform \n\n                                                 \n5  The seven slabs are 5%, 10%, 15%, 25%, 40%, 80%, and 130%. Customs duty on petroleum products, cement, \nand a few other commodities is levied on volume. In addition, a special fee ranging from 1% to 10% is levied on \nimports as a temporary surcharge to finance security-related expenditure. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\ninitiatives  have  been  undertaken  with  the  assistance  of  the  Danish  Agency  for  Development \nAssistance  (DANIDA)  and  German  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ),  and  progress  to  date  has \nbeen encouraging. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is also taking further initiatives in this \narea. Tax collection has improved somewhat, but not by the anticipated amount, partly because \nthe economy has been in recession for the last 2 years. Furthermore, internal security problems \nhave had an adverse impact on the tax collection efforts (Appendix 1). \n\n \n22. \nThe  Government  has  announced  a  number  of  reform  measures  aimed  at  containing \npublic expenditure and improving its efficiency. In March 2001, the Public Expenditure Review \nCommission (PERC) made several recommendations related to efficient management of public \nexpenditure.  Key  recommendations \ninclude  streamlining  and  rationalizing  Government \nministries/departments to better focus the delivery of public goods and services; prioritizing the \nallocation of resources for development programs through rigorous screening and performance \ncriteria; developing a 5-year expenditure prioritization framework; reforming the pension system \nthrough  shared  contribution;  reforming  the  civil  service  to  increase  accountability  and  to \nrightsize  key  ministries;  improving  financial  management  and  internal  auditing  systems; \npromoting decentralization; and assigning the shareholding function and ownership mandate of \nPEs to a single ministry. \n\n \n2. \n\nPublic Enterprises  \n\n \n23. \nPoor  Governance  and  Profitability  of  PEs.  Most  of  Nepal\u2019s  PEs  were  established  in \nthe 1960s and 1970s. Management and supervision are assigned to the various line ministries, \na significant number of which are under the Ministry of Commerce and Industries. The Ministry \nof Water Resources controls the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), by far the largest PE.  \n \n24. \nFinancial  and  operational  information  on  PEs  is  largely  unaudited;  as  a  result,  the \nexisting financial information is often of doubtful quality. The published records of MOF currently \ninclude 39 PEs under full Government ownership, with reported assets of about NRs198 billion \n($2.5 billion), and total employment of 46,000.6 Lack of reliable and up-to-date accounts reflects \nthe  Government\u2019s  incoherent  approach  to  maintain  its  ownership  mandate.  The  line  ministries \ntend  to  interfere  in  the  PEs\u2019  day-to-day  operations,  while  relevant  legal  provisions  are  either \nabsent, or not enforced, to ensure rule-based supervision by PE boards. Political appointees on \nboards  have  undermined  the  latter\u2019s  independence,  precluded  commercial  orientation,  and \nhampered  the  development  of  a  professional  culture  on  the  boards.  Frequent  changes  in \nGovernment  have  resulted  in  unstable  board  composition,  politicization,  and  appointment  of \nmanagement  and  staff  on  nonprofessional  considerations.  The  result  is  significant  over-\nemployment  and  staff  redundancy.  In  the  absence  of  clear  objectives  and  controls,  PE \nmanagers  have  little  incentive  to  adhere  to  sound  corporate  governance  principles.  As  a \nconsequence, PEs are subject to rent seeking by their staff and the line ministries. \n \n25. \nThe available low-quality reports available point to poor profitability of PEs. In FY2002, \n17  fully  government-owned  PEs  recorded  operating  losses  of  $12  million  equivalent  (losses \nwere  $53  million  in  FY2001),  despite  direct  budget  transfers  of  $28  million.7 The accumulated \nlosses are reported to be about $149 million. Poor profitability is thus an endemic problem and \ncontributes  to  fiscal  risks.  These  risks  are  compounded  by  the  fact  that  the  loss-incurring PEs \n                                                 \n6  One major PE not mentioned in the published records of MOF is the Nepal Bank Ltd. (NBL) with assets of NRs50 \nbillion.  Government  ownership  of  NBL  is  41%.  The  Government  also  has  full  or  part  ownership  of  some  more \nrelatively small enterprises, for which no records are officially published. \n\n7  This  is  done  in  the  form  of  share  capital  investment,  which  serves  to  absorb  liquidity  shortfall  rather  than  real \n\ninvestment. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\n \n\nrepresent a significant portion of PE employment. Fiscal risks are mainly a result of (i) erosion of \nthe  PEs\u2019  equity  due  to  persistent  poor  profitability;  (ii)  poor  loan  portfolio  and  the  need  for \nsignificant write-offs of loans granted to PEs by the financial sector;8 (iii) liabilities to the private \nsector;  and  (iv)  unfunded  liabilities  to  PE  staff  in  the  form  of  overdue  wages,  pension \ncontributions, severance pay, and other benefits. The Government closed and privatized 18 PEs \nduring the 8FYP period. However, the 9FYP witnessed a standstill of initiatives as a result of the \nfrequent change in Governments and weak institutional structure. \n \nUnfunded liabilities to PE staff alone are estimated to be as high as $300 million. While \n26. \nthe  total  extent  of  fiscal  risks  are  difficult  to  quantify,  the  rising  budget  transfers  to  PEs  and \ncontingent liabilities call for aggressive measures to contain the fiscal risks and stem the known \nand hidden losses and contingent liabilities. Due to the absence of controls and accountability of \nPE management, unfunded and unidentified liabilities constitute a significant medium-term fiscal \nrisk. Poor management by the Government is evident by the absence of financial management \ncontrols.  The  Government  has  also  not  been  effective  in  communicating  staff  retrenchment \ndecisions  and  procedures  to  PE  employees  and  their  representatives.  In  the  absence  of  a \nsystematic and mutually agreeable process, the Government has not been able to settle labor \ndisputes in an orderly manner, through negotiation and arbitration. Recent court cases suggest \nthat an effective communication and negotiation approach is missing. To arrest the fiscal risks \nand to ensure proper application of a fair process to all parties, a decisive time-bound approach, \nbacked  by  strong  implementation  arrangements,  is  needed.  Lessons  from  the  last  decade  of \nprivatization  in  Nepal  point  to  the  importance  of  political  will  and  effective  institutional \narrangements as well as professional capacity for conducting privatization successfully. Despite \nexternally  financed  long-term  technical  assistance  through  a  resident  adviser,  only  one \nprivatization  was  successfully  implemented  during  1997-2002.  To  restart  the  process  of \nGovernment  disengagement  from  PEs,  a  new  approach  that  takes  into  account  these  lessons \n(Appendixes 2 and 3) is needed. \n \n27.  Weak Legal and Regulatory Framework, and Enforcement Mechanisms.  There are \nimportant  gaps  in  the  development  of  supporting  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks,  and  in \nenforcement  structures  and  skills.  The  Company  Law  of  1997  lacks  provisions  supporting \ncorporate  governance,  transparency,  and  accountability,  and  the  enforcement  provisions  are \nweak.  Further,  lack  of  legislation  on  regulation  of  companies,  insolvency,  and  secured \ntransactions  has  hampered  the  orderly  market  entry  and  exit  of  companies  and  financial \ninstitutions,  and  development  of  enforcement  mechanisms  of  contractual  obligations,  sound \ndisclosure,  credit  and  investor  rights,  and  accountability  of  boards.  Since  most  PEs  are \nregistered  under  the  Company  Law,  enactment  of  the  new  Company  Law  and  the  supporting \nInsolvency  and  Secured  Transactions  laws,  along  with  implementation  regulations,  will  be \nimportant  milestones  for  improving  the  framework  for  board  and  management  appointments, \naccountability,  and  orderly  exit  of  PEs.  These  laws  are  being  developed  with  assistance  from \nADB.9  Similarly,  the  Chartered  Accountants  Act,  which  was  also  developed  with  support  from \nADB, is a major improvement for setting accounting and auditing standards for PEs and private \nsector  companies.10  The  Labour  Act  only  partly  covers  the  employment  of  staff  in  PEs  and \n\n                                                 \n8   The reported overall lending to PEs was at NRs2.7 billion ($35 million) as of October 2001. This, however, appears \nto be an underestimate, given the considerable guarantee exposure of banks. A more recent statement by one of \nthe larger banks alone reports credit and guarantee exposure exceeding $40 million, of which 70% are classified as \nsubstandard. \n\n9  ADB. 2000.  Technical  Assistance  to  Nepal  for  Reforming  Company,  Insolvency, and Secured Transactions Law \n\n10 ADB. 1999.  Technical  Assistance  to  Nepal  for  Capacity  Building  for  the  Accounting  and  Auditing  Profession. \n\nReform . Manila. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\napplication  of  its  provisions  has  been  ad  hoc,  with  weak enforcement. While internal rules of \nmost PEs have some provisions on compensation for retrenchment, there is no comprehensive \npolicy on retrenchment in the event of liquidation or privatization of PEs.    \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance for Improving Public Service Delivery \n\n \nNepal\u2019s  public  administration  comprises  bodies  at  the  central,  local,  and  municipal \n28. \nlevels.  The  central  Government  has  21  ministries  and  9  constitutional  bodies.  There  are  5 \nregional  administrative  units,  75  district  development  committees  (DDCs),  3,913  village \ndevelopment committees (VDCs), and 58 municipalities. The Civil Service Act and Civil Service \nRules,  amended  in  1998,  govern  the  present  civil  service,  which  is  estimated  to  cover  about \n103,000 approved positions.11 \n \n29. \nThe  Government  has  increasingly  recognized  that  weak  public  sector  governance  has \ncontributed  to  a  demoralized  bureaucracy,  misallocation  of  budgetary  resources,  poor \nimplementation  of  development  programs,  and  ineffective  delivery  of  public  services.  The \nGovernment  recognizes  that  sustained  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  cannot  be \nachieved  without  sound  public  sector  governance.    Drawing  lessons  from  experience,  the \nGovernment  has  embarked  on  a  major  governance  reform  program  since  1999  (Appendix  4). \nAs  part  of  the  reform  program,  an  action  plan  on  civil  service  reforms  was  prepared  with \ntechnical assistance from ADB.12 Under the action plan, the Government introduced a number \nof key reforms: (i) reducing the number of ministries from 26 to 21; (ii) introducing the voluntary \nearly  retirement  scheme;  (iii)  streamlining  redundancy  and  creating  new  positions;  (iv) \nabolishing about 3,500 posts; (v) increasing pay; and (vi) installing a reward system. To further \naddress  the  critical  institutional  constraints  that  hinder  reform  initiatives  and  to  bring  about \nfundamental and sustainable changes in the civil service, the Government started implementing \na  more  comprehensive  Governance  Reform  Program  (GRP)  in  December  2001  with  support \nfrom  ADB.13  Under  the  GRP,  a  personnel  database  for  civil  servants  was  created  to  improve \naccountability  and  transparency  of  the  civil  service.  To  contain  corruption,  the  Government \nlegislated four anticorruption bills in April 2002.14 The bills entail the establishment of a National \nVigilance  Center,  and  declaration  of  property  and  income  by  all  public  servants.  The \nGovernment  has  also  initiated  steps  to  strengthen  the  Commission  for  the  Investigation  of \nAbuse of Authority. \n \n30. \nIn the area of decentralization, the Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) was promulgated \nin  1999  to  strengthen  local  institutions  by  providing  them  with  greater  financial  autonomy,  and \nmaking  them  directly  accountable  to  the  people.  The  decentralization  process  became \n\n                                                 \n11 The  civil  service  does  not  include  staff  of  local  bodies  and  public  enterprises,  the  military,  police  force,  and \n\nteachers.  \n\n12 ADB. 1998.  Technical Assistance to Nepal for Formulating an Action Plan on Civil Service Reforms. Manila. This \ntechnical  assistance  included  the  following  initiatives:  (i)  conducting  a  civil  service  census;  (ii)  establishing a \ncomputerized personnel database; (iii) undertaking a functional review of ministries, departments, and offices; and \n(iv) considering a range of alternatives for fiscal decentralization. \n\n13 ADB. 2001.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Nepal \nfor the Governance Reform Program (GRP). Manila. The GRP consists of five components to be implemented over \n4  years  (ending  in  December  2005):  (i)  develop  internal  capacity  for  leading  civil  service  reform; (ii) improve the \nefficiency  of  the  civil  service;  (iii)  improve  governance  and  reduce  corruption  in  government;  (iv)  enhance \ncompetence  and  motivation  of  civil  servants;  and  (v)  establish  processes  for  improving  performance  in  key \nministries. For details of GRP, refer to Appendix 4. \n\n14 The four bills are Anticorruption Bill, Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority Bill, Impeachment Bill, \n\nand Special Court Bill. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\noperational with the approval of the Decentralization Implementation Plan (DIP)15. The DIP lists \na  number  of  decentralization-related  measures  to  be  completed  over  the  next  5  years,  and  is \nthe main document for implementing the policy. Some progress has been achieved in devolving \nresponsibility  for  key  service  areas  (primary  education,  agricultural  extension,  and  health-\nservice delivery) to the local bodies. The PERC had recommended that the delivery of services \nfor  health,  education,  and  agriculture  extension  should  be  entrusted  to  the  local  bodies with \nmanagerial  responsibilities.  A  Cabinet  decision  in  June  2002  commits  the  Government  to \nchanneling funds for these areas to local bodies from FY2003. Despite some tangible progress, \nthe decentralization efforts suffered a major setback since the elected local bodies\u2019 5-year term \nexpired  on  16  July  2002.  Although  their  tenure  could  have  been  extended,  the  Government \ndecided  to  hand  over  their  responsibilities  to  the  civil  service  bureaucracy  until  the  local \nelections are held. The schedule for the local elections remains uncertain. As a result, service \ndelivery  and  development  work  at  the  local  level  have  suffered.  In  addition,  the  destruction  of \nsome one third of the 3,913 VDC offices during the recent phase of the internal conflict and the \nabsence of a large number of VDC secretaries (about 1,000) have exacerbated the situation. \n  \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nPrioritizing Expenditure to Focus on Poverty Reduction \n\n \nEfficient expenditure management remains a major challenge. There has been growing \n31. \npressure  on  the  development  budget  due  to  increasing  regular  expenditures,  which  averaged \n86% of revenue during the 9FYP period. The resource situation has further worsened in recent \nyears,  entailing  large  cuts  in  the  development  expenditure.  The  effectiveness  of  public \ninvestments  has  also  suffered  due  to  the  inadequate  focus  on  planning  and  budgeting.  The \ndevelopment budget is highly inadequate to accommodate a large number of projects, many of \nwhich  lack  a  clear  development  rationale.  Poor  capacity  to  report  and  monitor  development \nexpenditure  remains  a  constraint  in  the  introduction  of  performance  based  budget  allocation. \nThere  is  an  urgent  need  to  strengthen  the  capacity  for  project  screening  and  appraisal, \nprioritizing projects in terms of their poverty reduction impact, and ensuring that priority projects \nare adequately funded and implemented. Budgetary transfers to PEs are also a significant part \nof  public  expenditure.  PE  operations  have  created  large  contingent  liabilities  in  the  form  of \nunfunded liabilities to PE staff, commercial banks, and other creditors. Given the poor financial \nperformance of PEs, these contingent liabilities are expected to increase significantly and need \nto be addressed to ensure that fiscal sustainability is not compromised. \n \n\nStrengthening Revenue Mobilization \n\n2. \n \n32. \n Despite  the  several  reform  measures  aimed  at  streamlining  the  tax  structure  and \nstrengthening  tax  administration,  Nepal\u2019s  revenue/GDP  ratio  remains  about  12%.  The \nGovernment  anticipates  the  revenue/GDP  ratio  to  increase  to  about  14%  by  the  end  of  the \n10FYP. Since the increase in the revenue/GDP ratio was a mere 1% over the 9FYP period, to \nmeet  the  10FYP  targets,  the  Government  needs  to  reassess  its  strategy  for  accelerating \nrevenue  mobilization,  to  develop  an  implementable  action  plan  to  improve  tax  administration, \nand to check the current leakage in revenue mobilization. Several issues need to be addressed \non a priority basis. The scope of various tax exemptions currently being extended needs to be \nsharply  curtailed.  There  are  significant  amounts  of  uncollected  tax  arrears,  especially  of  VAT \n\n                                                 \n15 The  Government\u2019s  DIP,  which  was  approved  by  the  Decentralization  Implementation and Monitoring Committee \n(chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister)  on  8  January  2002,  aims  to  operationalize  provisions  made  in  the  Local  Self-\nGovernance Act over the next 5 years. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f11\n\n \n\n \n\n \n3. \n\nand income tax. A determined effort to collect the arrears would provide an immediate source of \nrevenue  and  would  signal  the  Government\u2019s  firm  commitment  to  strengthen  revenue \nmobilization.  In  this  regard,  IRD  needs  to  be  strengthened  by  filling  up  the  essential  positions \nthat  are  currently  vacant.  Further,  as  a  monitoring  tool  for  revenue  administration,  the \nGovernment  needs  to  set  performance  targets  for  tax  offices  and  senior  tax  officials.  The \ncapacity  of  the  Central  Monitoring  Unit  in  MOF  to  periodically  review  revenue  policy  and \ncoordinate the joint action of different departments also needs to be enhanced.  \n\nDisengaging Government from PE Management and Ownership \n\nframework \n\nlegal  and  regulatory \n\n \n33. \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  disengagement  from  PE  is  necessary  to  contain \nexpenditure  and  reduce  the  fiscal  risks.  However,  past  experience  points  to  the  complexity  of \nthe  process  and  the  need  for  a  multiprong  approach.  This  approach  involves:  (i)  building  an \nappropriate \nto  support  sound  corporate  governance, \naccountability,  recognition  of  liabilities,  and  an  orderly  market  exit  for  failed  institutions;  (ii) \nbuilding the institutional and legal infrastructure to implement the Government\u2019s disengagement \nfrom PEs; (iii) adopting measures to contain the budget outflow and fiscal risks through reduced \nbudgetary allocation, and imposing credit limits to PEs, and irrevocable liquidation and sale of a \nnumber  of  them;  and  (iv)  improving  governance  and  accountability  by  assigning  to  one  single \nministry,16 supervision of PEs to be privatized, or liquidated, removing political appointees from \nPE  boards,  reducing  the  backlog  of  PE  audits,  and  establishing  standardized    financial \nreporting. \n \n\n4. \n\nImproving Public Service Delivery \n\n \n34. \n Rightsizing  the  Civil  Service.  The  civil  service  is  overstaffed  in  Nepal.  A  significant \nreduction in the number of civil servants has been recommended in the Administrative Reform \nCommission Report 1992 and, more recently, the PERC. The ongoing GRP aims at establishing \na civil service that is results- and people-oriented and gender responsive, and which contributes \nto higher economic growth and poverty reduction. Under the GRP,  a policy and a detailed plan \nfor  rightsizing  the  civil  service  through  commercialization,  devolution  to  local  authorities,  and \ncontracting  out  or  elimination  of  selected  functions  will  be  developed  for  Cabinet  approval  in \n2003.  Following  this,  the  Government  will  implement  rightsizing  in  three  line  ministries.  About \n17,000 vacant positions existed in the civil service. The Government announced in the Budget \nFY2002  speech  a  policy  for  rightsizing  the  civil  service  by  eliminating  unnecessary  vacant \npositions. This initiative is critical since it will reduce the risk of vacant posts being filled under \npolitical pressure and patronage. \n \n35. \nStrengthening Decentralization.  To  improve  service  delivery  at  the  grassroot  level, \nallocation of block grants to the local bodies must be closely linked to the incidence of poverty in \na  region.  Simultaneously,  devolution  of  financial  and  administrative  authority  to  local  bodies  is \nalso essential to facilitate a smooth transition from a centrally controlled civil service system to a \nmultilayered system that meets the specific needs of the central, regional, and local levels. Until \nnow,  management  of  personnel  of  local  bodies  has  been  centrally  controlled.  The  central \nGovernment  defines  the  recruitment  process,  salary  scale,  promotion,  and  levels  of  position. \nWith  the  devolution  of  sectoral  functions,  the  elected  local  bodies  need  to  have  their  own \nemployees and to make them accountable to the local bodies rather than to the line ministries.  \nAnother important issue relates to making the local bodies technically competent to enable them \nto  manage  development  projects  and  programs,  and  to  institutionalize  these  technical  units \n\n                                                 \n16 This is consistent with the recommendations of the PERC (para. 22). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\nwithin  the  local  bodies.  At  the  same  time,  delivery  of  education  service  needs  substantial \nimprovement. Despite the critical importance of basic education in poverty reduction, the quality \nof basic education remains poor, mainly because the teachers are not accountable to the local \ncommunities. To improve the quality of basic education and to make the  teachers accountable, \nstarting with the FY2003 budget, the Government will begin the devolving the management of \nschools to the local communities on a pilot basis. \n \n36. \n  Improving  the  Transparency  and  Accountability  of  Civil  Service.  Despite  several \nreform initiatives of the Government, corruption remains a critical challenge to good governance \nin  the  country.  So  far,  preventive  measures  have  proven  inadequate,  and  actions  either  have \nnot  been  taken  against  the  corrupt,  or  have  been  ineffective.  The  Government  recently \ndeveloped  a  comprehensive  strategy  to  curb  corruption.  The  Anti-Corruption  Act  of  2002 \nrequires  all  national  servants  (includes  civil  servants)  to  submit  a  statement,  supported  by \ndocumentary evidence, of their wealth/property held in their name or in the name of their family \nmembers.    This  requirement  needs  to  be  institutionalized  and  the  information  needs  to  be \nupdated annually. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM  \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\n Objectives and Scope \n\n \n37. \nThe  goal  of  the  Public  Sector  Management  Program  (PSMP)  is  to  support  poverty \nreduction consistent with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy embodied in the 10FYP. \nThe strategy is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s PRS and the country strategy for Nepal, and focuses \non  improved  public  expenditure  management  and  governance.  The  PSMP  will  assist  the \nGovernment  to  improve  revenue  collection,  prioritize  expenditure,  and  strengthen  fiscal \nsustainability  through  elimination  of  noncore  government  functions  and  activities.  The  PSMP \nalso  aims  to  enhance  corporate  and  public  sector  governance  as  an  integral  part  of  Nepal's \nPRS. Key policy and institutional constraints will be addressed to strengthen the Government's \nresource  position  over  the  medium  term  and  lay  the  foundation  for  acceleration  of  pro-poor \ngrowth. These measures will take 3-4 years to yield their intended benefits. Given the prevailing \nfiscal scenario, the Government\u2019s ability to pursue the poverty reduction strategy outlined in the \n10FYP is contingent on the availability of additional external finance. The program framework is \nin Appendix 5. \n \nThe  PSMP  will  focus  on  reforms  related  to  (i)  strengthening  the  fiscal  position  of  the \n38. \ngovernment, (ii) facilitating the Government\u2019s withdrawal from PE management and ownership, \nand (iii) strengthening public and corporate sector governance. The PSMP will also support the \nimplementation of the IAP and is consistent with the macroeconomic framework agreed upon by \nIMF and Government. \n \n39. \nDiscussions  between  the  Government  and  ADB  on  the  scope  of  the  PSMP  began  in \nMay  2002.  An  agreement  was  reached  in  June  2002  on  the  policy  issues  that  needed  to  be \naddressed to arrest further deterioration of the economic situation, and to lay the foundations for \neffective  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  poverty  reduction  strategy.  In \nresponse  to  the  agreement,  the  Government  started  taking  policy  actions  beginning  with  the \nbudget  of  FY2003.  While  good  progress  was  being  made  in  addressing  the  policy  issues,  the \npolitical  situation  in  the  country  deteriorated  dramatically  in  the  second  half  of  2002.  The \nParliament  was  dissolved  on  the  advice  of  the  then  Prime  Minister,  and  national  elections  in \nNovember 2002 were announced. The King appointed the then Prime Minister to be a caretaker \n\n \n\n \n\n\f13\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nincumbent along with a relatively small cabinet. Meanwhile, the Government and ADB were in \nclose  dialogue  on  policy-related  issues,  and  it  was  anticipated  that  the  PSMP  would  be \npresented to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors for their consideration after the November 2002 national \nelections.  The  internal  security  situation  in  the  country  worsened  in  October  2002,  and  it \nbecame  apparent  that  elections  could  not  be  held  in  the  prevailing  environment.  In  October \n2002, the King replaced the caretaker Government with a nonpartisan Government to tackle the \ndeteriorating security situation, and to hold elections as soon as the situation permitted. \n \nThe Government made considerable progress in improving the internal security situation \n40. \nand  to  establish  peace  within  the  country.  A  cease-fire  between  the  Government  and  the \nCPN/M  was  announced  on  29  January  2003  and  a  code  of  conduct  was  agreed  upon  on  13 \nMarch  2003.  In  the  meantime,  the  Prime  Minister  resigned  on  30  May  2003  and  the  King \nappointed  a  new  Prime  Minister  on  5  June  2003.  The  new  Government  and  the  CPN/M  have \nreiterated their intention to remain engaged in the peace process. The process may take some \ntime,  but  successive  Governments  have  displayed  determination  in  tackling  the  difficult \neconomic  situation  and  implementing  the  10FYP.  The  Government  and  ADB  have  worked \nclosely  since  mid-2002  to  develop  the  PSMP.  Since  then,  the  Government  has  been \nimplementing  the  core  elements  of  the  PSMP  that  address  some  key  constraints  facing  the \neconomy. \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Action \n\n1. \n\nImproving Expenditure Management \n\n \n Improved expenditure management is key to strengthening the fiscal position. As a first \n41. \nstep,  the  Government  has  initiated  implementation  of  the  MTEF  by  formulating  the  FY2003 \nbudget and prioritizing development projects based on their poverty reduction impact. Under the \nPSMP,  the  Government  has  developed  the  priority  criteria  for  classifying  projects  to  ensure \nadequate  and  timely  budget  release  for  high-priority  ones  and  enhance  the  poverty  reduction \nimpact of public investment. \n \n42. \nThe Government recently streamlined the pipeline of development projects. The overall \nnumber  of  planned  projects  had  increased  sharply  from  about  400  in  the  second  half  of  the \n1990s to 715 in FY2001, far exceeding the Government\u2019s funding and implementation capacity. \nThe  process  of  rationalization  began  in  FY2002  when  the  number  was  reduced  to  633.  The \nprocess was pushed forward in the FY2003 budget, which announced dropping or merging an \nadditional 160 low-priority projects. The process, which was recently completed, is expected to \ngenerate  budget  savings  of  about  NRs2  billion\u2013NRs3  billion  annually  overall,  and \nsimultaneously improve the focus on poverty-related projects. \n \nConcurrently,  an  effective  mechanism  to  ensure  that  the  scarce  budgetary  resources \n43. \nallocated  to  the  priority  projects  are  effectively  utilized  needs  to  be  institutionalized.  Under  the \nPSMP, the Government will prepare a performance-based budget release mechanism to ensure \nthat the best performing projects obtain funds in an effective and timely manner. The Financial \nAdministration  Rule  of  1999  requires  all  project  administration  units  to  regularly  report  the \nimplementation  progress  to  the  concerned  ministries  and  the  National  Planning  Commission, \nbut  this  requirement  has  been  infrequently  followed.  The  result  is  delays  and  weak \nimplementation  of  ongoing  projects.  To  address  the  situation,  in  FY2003,  the  Government \nconducted  a  review  to  improve  the  reporting  format  under  the  Financial  Administration Rule. \nHenceforth,  the  project  implementation  progress  reports  will  form  the  basis  for  performance-\n\n \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\nbased release of trimester budget allocations to the respective projects and thus ensure more \neffective use of development expenditures. \n \n44. \n  Allocations  to  PEs,  which  are  a  significant  burden  to  the  budget,  are  projected  to  be \nNRs10.3  billion  (10.8%  of  the  total  budgetary  outlay)  in  FY2003.  While  the  bulk  of  the \nallocations represents loans for investment projects, poor profitability and weak management by \nthe  PEs  have  adverse  long-term  fiscal  implications  for  such  investments.  In  recent  years,  the \nGovernment has invested significant direct share capital through cash transfers to PEs (NRs2.1 \nbillion  in  FY2002)  due  to  the  continuing  erosion  of  their  equity  base  and  strained  liquidity. \nMoreover,  net  resource  inflows  from  PEs  to  the  budget  have  recently  reversed  to  significant \noutflows  (NRs1.8  billion).  The  Government  has  also  accumulated  large  contingent  liabilities \nthrough PE staff retirement benefits, unpaid wages, and other work-related benefits, which add \nto the medium-term fiscal risks. In addition to direct budgetary outflows, the banking system also \nhas significant loan exposure to PEs, which Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) reported at $35 million in \nOctober 2001. One of the larger banks alone reports its credit and guarantee exposure to PEs \nat about $40 million, indicating that official statistics are unreliable and grossly understate actual \nexposure. The banking system\u2019s loan and guarantee exposure related to PEs could turn into a \ngovernment  budgetary  liability  once  PEs  prove  unable  to  service  their  debt.  To  arrest  the \ngrowing contingent liabilities and budget transfers, and to reduce the risk to the financial system, \nthe Government will develop and implement under the PSMP a medium-term plan to check the \nfiscal  drain  on  account  of  PEs  by  reducing  (i)  budget  transfers  on  revenue  account,  (ii) \ncontingent liabilities, and (iii) exposure to creditors, especially to the banking system. Ongoing \ninternational audits of four major banks will give a more accurate assessment of the credit and \nguarantee risk exposure to PEs, and the actual extent of liabilities.  \n \n\n2. \n\nStrengthening Revenue Mobilization and Management \n\n \n45. \nBesides applying expenditure management measures, the Government will also need to \nstrengthen  revenue  mobilization  to  improve  the  current  fiscal  situation.  There  is  significant \npotential  in  broadening  the  tax  base  and  mobilizing  additional  revenues  by  cutting  the  wide \nrange of exemptions, many of which do not have a clear economic rationale.  Estimates show \nthat exemptions extended in key revenue sources such as customs duty, VAT, and income tax \nadd up to NRs6 billion, 12% of current Government revenue or more than 1% of GDP. Customs \nand  VAT  account  for  a  major  share  of  these  exemptions.  To  accelerate  the  pace  of  revenue \nmobilization,  under  the  PSMP  the  Government  appointed  a  task  force  to  develop  a  Revenue \nMobilization Action Plan that examines the key constraints in the areas of tax administration, tax \nexemptions, tax arrears, and customs valuation. The Task Force recently submitted its report to \nthe Government. The Government will begin to eliminate these exemptions in the FY2004 and \nFY2005 budgets, and most will have been eliminated by the end of the PSMP period. Similarly, \nthe  Government  will  also  examine  the  scope  for  rationalizing  the  applicable  rates  of  various \ntaxes and implement the required changes in the FY2004 budget. \n \n46. \nSignificant  tax  arrears  have  been  building  up  over  time.  According  to  estimates,  the \ncumulative arrears of income tax, VAT, and excise/sales tax are about NRs5 billion, nearly 10% \nof the Government\u2019s current revenue, or 1.5% of GDP. A determined effort to collect the arrears \nwill  give  the  Government  an  immediate  source  of  revenue.  It  will  also  signal  to  taxpayers  the \nGovernment\u2019s  determination \nthe \ncomputerization  of  taxpayers\u2019  records,  the  strategy  for  collecting  these  arrears  would  include \ncollection  visits,  offsetting  tax  dues  with  tax  refunds,  linking  arrears  with  nonpayers\u2019  business \ntransactions  such  as  exports  and  imports,  and  stricter  punitive  actions  against  nonpayers  to \nencourage others to pay.   \n\nto  effectively  enforce \n\nthe  existing \n\nlaws.  With \n\ntax \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\n \n47. \nUndervaluing  imports  during  assessment  of  customs  duties  remains  a  serious  tax \nadministration  problem.  While  the  automated  system  for  customs  data  has  been  introduced  in \nsome  of  the  major  customs  points  to  simplify  procedures  and  improve  the  valuation  system \nbased  on  the  transaction  value,  underinvoicing  of  imports  remains  a  common  practice.  The \npractice impacts negatively on the collection not only of customs duty, but also VAT and income \ntax  proceeds.  The  Revenue  Mobilization  Action  Plan  will  address  this  issue  by  extending  the \nimplementation of the automated system to other customs points.  \n \n48. \nThe  capacity  of  IRD  to  effectively  undertake  tax  reform  measures  needs  to  be \nstrengthened  by  filling  up  the  allotted  positions  with  qualified  staff.  Around  70  professional \npositions  in  the  IRD  are  not  currently  filled.  It  is  estimated  that  about  50  of  the  positions  are \nessential and need to be filled immediately to increase the effectiveness of tax reforms. Under \nthe PSMP, the Government recruited 58 essential staff required in IRD, after training them. \n \n49. \nThe  performance  of  the  various  tax  offices  and  key  tax  officials  must  be  monitored  to \nsustain  improved  revenue  collection.  Under  the  PSMP,  the  Government  will  develop \nmeasurable  performance  targets  for  all  tax  offices  and  officials,  and  a  performance  evaluation \nsystem  for  the  indicators.  While  evaluation  of  the  performance  of  specific  tax  offices  will  be \nbased  on  regular  collection  of  relevant  taxes,  collection  of  arrears,  number  of  tax  audits \nundertaken,  and  punitive  actions  against  defaulters  and  nonfilers,  evaluation  of  individual  tax \nofficials  will  focus  on  effective  monitoring  of  the  performance  of  tax  officers  under  him/her, \nnumber of collection visits, number of field audits performed, and regular reporting to the parent \ndepartment.  Monitoring  and  performance  evaluation  of  the  tax  offices  and  officials  will  be \nundertaken  by  IRD,  the  Customs  Department,  and  the  Central  Monitoring  Unit  in  MOF.  The \nGovernment will also institute a regular monitoring system for assessing the achievement of the \nmonthly/quarterly revenue collection targets and improvement in the coverage of the taxpayers, \nparticularly the VAT and income tax.  \n \n\nSupporting the Disengagement of Government from PEs \n \n\n3. \n \n \n50. \nImproving  the  Legal  Framework.  The  existing  laws  do  not  support  strong  corporate \ngovernance.  The  implementation  of  the  recently  drafted  new  Company  Law,  Insolvency  Law, \nand Secured Transactions Law will be instrumental in creating a rules-based environment and \nthus, lay the foundation for better corporate governance. The Company Law and the Insolvency \nLaw  will  provide  the  framework  for  the  constitution  of  boards,  professional  management, \naccountability and disclosure, as well as the orderly entry and exit of companies. The Secured \nTransactions  Law  will  enhance  creditor  rights.  Under  the  PSMP,  the  revised  Company  Law, \nInsolvency Law, and Secured Transactions Law will be put into force through publication in the \nNepal  Gazette  and  issuance  of  necessary  implementation  regulations.  The  Government  will \nalso  prepare  a  policy  and  time-bound  action  plan  for  disengagement  from  PEs  and  has \nestablished  a  privatization  coordination  sub-committee  (PCSC)  under  the  Privatization \nCommittee  (PC)  in  MOF.  The  Government  will  also  transfer  to  MOF  the  management  and \nsupervision of units to be privatized. Further, the Government will reconstitute the boards of PEs \nto  include  only  professionals.  The  Cabinet  has  already  approved  the  policy  and  this  measure \nwill be fully implemented in FY2004. \n \n51. \n Containing Contingent Liabilities. To support the poverty focus of public expenditure, \nbudget expenditures on PEs and their contingent liabilities need to be contained and gradually \nreduced. Measures under the PSMP consist of short- and medium-term actions. The short-term \nactions are as follows: \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n16\n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Government  will  continue \nits  current  policy  of  capping  aggregate \nemployment  in  PEs,  with  the  cap  being  automatically  reduced  in  line  with  each \nretrenchment. This measure will reduce the contingent liabilities related to staff. \n\nUnder  the  PSMP,  the  Government  will  implement  the  irrevocable  liquidation  of \nfive PEs. Consequently, the boards of these companies will be dissolved and a \nliquidator  will  be  appointed \nformalities.  The \nGovernment will settle all dues to staff and creditors. From its past privatization \nexperience, the Government recognizes that prospects for an outright sale of PE \nasset  would  improve  if  prior  action  was  taken  on  Labor  rationalization  and \nsettlement  of  liabilities.  Labor  rationalization  will  be  accompanied  by  support \nmeasures such as training and job placement, and will be based on the principles \nof fairness, transparency, and consultation. \n\nto  complete \n\nliquidation \n\nthe \n\nThe  Government  has  identified  six  PEs  as  potential  candidates  for  sale  or \ninitiation  of  irrevocable  liquidation.  If  bidding  proves  unsuccessful,  the  PC  will \nrecommend to the Cabinet liquidation of four of the six companies. Subsequently, \nthe  company  registrar,  for  PEs  registered  as  companies,  will  initiate  irrevocable \nliquidation  through  the  issuance  of  a  liquidation  order,  or  public  notice  of \ndissolution.  The  Government  will  settle  all  outstanding  dues  from  the  liquidation \nand sale of the four entities by the end of the PSMP period. Labor rationalization \nwill follow similar procedures to those for the five PEs liquidated earlier.  \n\n \n  Preparing a Medium-Term  Action  Plan. To accelerate the disengagement from PE \n52. \nownership,  the  Government  will  develop  a  strategy  and  an  action  plan  in  active  collaboration \nwith  all  stakeholders.  The  implementation  of  the  action  plan  will  begin  in  FY2004  and  spread \nover  5-years.  The  strategy  will  explicitly  prioritize  enterprises  for  sale,  liquidation,  and \nrestructuring,  and  develop  an  institutional  model,  such  as  a  privatization  agency,  for  effective \nimplementation. The strategy and the action plan will be approved by the Cabinet and will entail \nthe following steps (Appendix 2). \n\nDiagnosis. Assessment of the cost and contingent liabilities incurred by PEs will \ninclude  analysis  of  the  staffing  needs  of  PEs,  staff  reduction  plans,  training  for \nretrenched staff, planned reduction of direct and indirect budgetary transfers, and \nan accurate assessment of exposure of the banking system to PEs. \n\nStrategic  planning.  Based  on  the  diagnostic  results,  PEs  from  which  the \nGovernment will disengage will be prioritized. The strategy will include measures \nto  improve  governance,  accountability  of  management,  and  efficiency  of  PEs; \nreduce  overstaffing;  establish  hard  budget  and  borrowing  constraint  for  all  PEs; \nprivatize  PEs  with  market  potential;  and  close  enterprises  without  market \npotential. \n\nImplementation.  Development  of  the  legal  and  institutional  infrastructure  to \nsupport privatization received initial support from ADB17. Further, TA is required \nto  support  implementation  of  short-  and  medium-term  measures.  ADB  will \nprovide  TA  support.  In  addition,  the  Department  for  International  Development, \nU.K.  (DFID)  and  the  Government  are  finalizing  a  supplementary  TA  for  this \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Privatization and Liquidation of Public Enterprises. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\npurpose.  The  Government  will  begin  implementing  the  medium-term  plan \nimmediately, following approval by the cabinet. \n\n \n53. \n  Enforcing  Accounting  and  Auditing  Standards  on  PEs.  To  reduce  the  significant \nbacklog of unaudited PEs, the Government under the PSMP has completed updated audit of 20 \nPEs in FY2003. The process will continue in FY2004 and, by the end of the PSMP period, 40 \nPEs  will  have  updated  audits.  Particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  two  financial  sector  PEs\u2014 \nAgricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) and Nepal Industrial Development Corporation \n(NIDC)\u2014where  the  Government  will  complete  institutional  strategies  and  action  plans  for \nrestructuring.  \n \n54. \n Enforcing Fairness and Transparency in Labor Rationalization in PEs.  The current \nLabour  Act  covers  only  procedures  for  retrenchment  or  collective  disputes  relating  to \nprivatization  and  rightsizing.  There  are  no  labor-related rules or policies for liquidation of PEs. \nFurther, the internal rules of PEs differ significantly on the package of retrenchment benefits. A \nnew  policy  will  cover  retrenchment  resulting  from  liquidation,  privatization,  or  rightsizing.  The \nGovernment  will  develop  the  policy  in  a  participatory  and  consultative  manner  with  a \nrepresentative  of  all  stakeholders,  including  employees  of  PEs,  line  ministries  responsible  for \nPEs,  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  MOF,  labor  unions,  and  independent  experts  on  privatization  and \nretrenchment issues.  \n \n55. \n The  policy  will  cover  issues  such  as  (i)  scope  of  retrenchment,  and  alternatives  to \nretrenchment,  where  appropriate;  (ii)  public  information  and  announcements  of  the  likely \nretrenchment due to planned disinvestments; (iii) assessment of staff capacities through human \nresources  audits;  (iv)  development  of  appropriate  assistance  packages  for  retrenched  labor, \nincluding  monetary  and  nonmonetary assistance such as training, business advisory services, \nand identification of new jobs; and (v) grievance procedures.  \n \n\n4. \n\nImproving Public Sector Governance \n\n \n56. \nRecognizing the critical importance of good governance to achieve the poverty reduction \ntargets, the Government has adopted good governance as one of the four pillars of the 10FYP. \nThis  component  is  designed  to  complement  and  reinforce  the  civil  service  reform  and \nanticorruption  measures  initiated  under  the  GRP  and  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization \nprogram.  The  objectives  of  this  component  are  to  (i)  rightsize  the  civil  service  by  eliminating \nvacant posts and freezing recruitment so as to contain the Government\u2019s recurrent expenditure \nin the medium term; (ii) support devolution of public services by supporting the Government in \nimplementing its decentralization program; (iii) enhance transparency and accountability of the \ncivil service; and (iv) improve public sector auditing and accounting standards and practices. \n \n\nRightsizing the Civil Service and Freezing Recruitment \n\na. \n \n\n57. \nTo  contain  the  Government\u2019s  recurrent  expenditure  and  generate  fiscal  savings  in  the \nmedium term, the Government is committed to rightsizing the bureaucracy and streamlining the \ncreation of new posts. Under the PSMP, the Government issued an order for eliminating about \n7,518  vacant  posts.  The  elimination  of  vacant  posts  primarily  targets  nongazetted  positions. \nImplementation  has  been  somewhat  slow  and  only  1,500  posts  have  been  eliminated  so  far. \nThe  Government  has  agreed  to  expedite  implementation;  an  additional  2,000  posts  will  be \neliminated by June 2003 and the rest August 2003. If the 7,500 vacant posts were to be filled, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n\npersonnel  expenditures  are  estimated  to  be  around  NRs2.0  billion  during  the  10FYP  period.18 \nEliminating  vacant  posts  will  reduce  the  risk  of  having  vacant  posts  filled  through  political \npressure and patronage. For the remaining vacant posts, the Government will continue to freeze \nrecruitment  in  vacant  nongazetted  positions  during  the  program  period.  A  proper  job \nassessment will identify the necessary posts. Recruitment for those posts will be initiated after \nMOF and Ministry of General Administration (MOGA) reach agreement on recruitment. \n \n\nb. \n\nSupporting Devolution of Public Services \n\n \n58. \nAlthough the LSGA offers a policy and regulatory framework for decentralization and for \nstrengthening  local  governance,  there  has  not  been  adequate  financial  and  human  resources \nsupport  to  enable  local  bodies  to  undertake  their  prescribed  functions.  While  complete  and \nsuccessful devolution of public services to the local bodies is a medium- to long-term goal and \nwill  require  substantial  capacity  building  of  local  bodies  including  strengthening  their  recurrent \nbudgets, the central Government has decided to adopt a number of measures in this direction. \nTo  operationalize  and  implement  the  decentralization  program,  the  Government  identified  a \nnumber of tasks in the DIP approved in January 2002. The PSMP will support the Government \nin implementing the DIP, specifically focusing on the following areas: (i) a poverty-based formula \nfor  allocation  of  block  grants;  (ii)  human  resource  management  for  local  governments;  (iii) \ninstituting  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  district  technical  offices  (DTOs);  and  (iv) \ndecentralization of education services. \n \n59. \nProgressive  decentralization  of  financial  and  administrative  authority  to  the  local \ngovernments  (DDCs  and  VDCs)  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nstrategy. In pursuance of the strategy, the Government decided that, despite the fiscal crisis, the \namount  of  budgetary  transfers  to  local  bodies  would  not  be  reduced  in  FY2003.  Accordingly, \nNRs2.97 billion was allocated for block grants to the local bodies, which is roughly the amount \nallocated in FY2002. While this is a positive step, the quantum of funds is inadequate to address \nthe  needs  of  the  remote  and  poorer  areas.  Since  the  Government  lacks  resources  for \nsubstantial  budget  transfers,  it  needs  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  poverty-targeting  of \nresources  allocated  to  the  local  bodies.  Under  the  PSMP,  the  Government  will  develop  and \nimplement  a  poverty-based  mechanism  for  allocating  block  grants  to  the  local  bodies.  The \nallocation  criteria  will  be  based  on  the  incidence  of  poverty  as determined by factors such as \nremoteness of the respective DDCs, access to basic social and physical infrastructure, and the \nlevel of local resources that can be mobilized. \n \n60.  With the devolution of sectoral functions, employees working for local bodies need to be \naccountable to them rather than to the line ministries. The PSMP supports the preparation of a \ndraft local service legislation to (i) empower and enable local bodies to manage their staff, and \n(ii)  gradually  remove  dependence  on  manpower  policies/rules  dictated  by  the  central \nGovernment.  Under  the  PSMP,  the  Government  has  issued  a  directive  and  has  established \nDistrict  Technical  Offices  (DTOs)  as  technical  units  of  DDC  as  envisaged  in  the  LSGA.  The \nGovernment  is  also  in  the  process  of  implementing  an  action  plan  for  institutionalizing  and \nstrengthening  the  project  implementation  and  monitoring  capacity  of  the  technical  units.  As  a \nprerequisite  for  ensuring  a  high  level  of  coordination  and  cooperation  with  the  concerned  line \nministries, the roles and responsibilities of the technical units relative to the central Government \nwill  be  clearly  defined.  In  addition,  staffing  of  the  technical  units,  capacity  building  including \n\n                                                 \n18  It is assumed that the monthly salary per post is NRs3,800. The starting salary (monthly) is NRs4,900 for a non-\ngazetted class I officer and NRs3,000 for a peon. In addition to salary, the Government currently contributes 10% \nof the employee\u2019s salary to the provident fund and pays one month\u2019s additional salary as Dashain allowances. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n\ntraining and orientation, provision of physical facilities, administrative control and monitoring and \nsupervision mechanisms, functional relationship and accountability; and expenditure modalities \nfor infrastructure development will also be addressed. \n \n61.  While  access  to  basic  education  has  increased  considerably  in  Nepal,  the  quality  of \nbasic  education  remains  poor.19  High  repetition  and  dropout  rates  throughout  the  public \neducation system waste scarce public resources. To increase the effectiveness of resource use \nand  enhance  the  quality  of  education,  the  Government  is  in  the  process  of  implementing  the \npolicy  of  decentralization  of  education  services  to  the  local  communities.  This  measure  will \nimprove  public  education  service  delivery,  and  make  education  need-based  and  more \nresponsive  to  local  demands.  Under  the  PSMP,  the  Government  has  issued  Community-\nManaged  School  Management  Directives  to  facilitate  handing  over  the  management  of  public \nschools  to  local  communities.  The  directives  delegate  to  the  school  management  committees, \nwhich comprise local people, full authority in appointing teachers and school principals, and in \nother administrative matters. The Ministry of Education and Sports has approved the transfer of \nmanagement of 100 local schools to the community school management committees, which will \nbe provided block grants through DDCs. The Government has already transferred 90 schools to \nthe school management committees.  \n\nEnhancing Transparency and Accountability of the Civil Service  \n\n \nc. \n \n\ninitiate \n\n62. \nIn Nepal, it is frequently perceived that corruption is a systemic problem that undermines \nthe performance of the public sector. Although the four legislations enacted in 2002 (para. 29) \nare  expected  to  make  anticorruption  measures  more  effective,  reform  measures  are  also \nneeded to strengthen the prevailing system, procedures, and processes. Under the PSMP, the \nPrime  Minister\u2019s  Office  will  prepare  and \nimplementation  of  a  comprehensive \nanticorruption  strategy,  which  will  include  specific  preventive  and  prosecution  measures.  Key \nelements  of  the  strategy  will include (i) establishment of a citizen\u2019s charter; (ii) mechanism for \ntime-bound  delivery  of  services;  (iii)  public  awareness  campaigns  and  transparency  in  civil \nservant  transfers;  (iv)  improved  auditing  and  accounting  standards;  and  (v)  measures  against \nrevenue leakages. The Government has agreed to make the strategy operational in FY2004. As \na preventive measure, the Anti-Corruption Act of 2002 requires all public servants (includes civil \nservants) to submit a statement\u2014supported by documentary evidence\u2014of their wealth/property \nheld in their name, or in the name of family members. The PSMP supports the implementation \nof legal provisions, which make it mandatory on civil servants of class 2 and above, to declare \ntheir  income/property.  This  disclosure  will  improve  the  accountability  and  transparency  of  the \ncivil service.  \n\nd. \n\nImproving the Capacity of the Accounting and Audit Profession \n\nNepal  has  established  a  professional  group  of  accountants  and  auditors  and  standard-\n63. \nsetting committees. The Chartered Accountants Act, which was enacted on 8 July 2002, makes \nimportant  provisions  for  establishing  boards  for  setting  accounting  and  audit  standards  and \nenhancing  the  status  of  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  Nepal  (ICAN)  as  a  self-\nregulating professional body for the accounting and audit profession. The PSMP will support the \n\n                                                 \n19  In  Nepal  the  education  environment  tends  to  be  politicized.  Teacher  discipline  and  the  commitment  to  students \nhave  declined.  The  institutional  infrastructure  and  physical  facilities  are  in  a  poor  state.  As  a  consequence,  the \nquality  of  education  in  government  schools  is  dismally  poor.  Inadequacies  in  public  schools  have  led  to  the \nmushrooming of a host of private schools, which the poor simply cannot afford. The teachers are poorly motivated \nas  a  consequence  of  low  salaries,  limited  career  development,  and  poor  supervision  and  monitoring.  Teacher \nabsenteeism is currently estimated at over 50%.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\nestablishment of the Nepal Accounting Standards Board (NASB) and the Nepal Audit Standards \nBoard (NAuSB).  \n \nC. \n \n\nAmount of Loan, Source of Funds, and Cost of Adjustment \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n1. \n\n  \n64. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  24,649,000  (or  $35 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  support  the  PSMP.  The  size  of  the \nproposed loan is based on the scope of the reform program, and on the adjustment costs of the \nreform measures. The adjustment costs of implementing the PSMP will be partially offset over \nthe medium term by savings achieved through reform actions, especially from the Government\u2019s \ndisengagement from PEs and better  fiscal management. Some short-term savings will also be \ngenerated  from  the  PSMP  reforms  on  prioritizing  expenditures  and  effective  revenue \nmobilization.  \n \n65. \nare estimated at $48.5 million, consisting of the following components: \n \n\nGross adjustment costs (excluding medium- to long-term savings on account of reforms) \n\n$48.2  million  on  account  of  the  sale  and  liquidation  of  nine  PEs  including  costs \nfor arrears of wages, retrenchment packages, and settling of creditor claims; and \n\n$0.3  million  on  account  of  the  establishment  and  enhancement  of  the  delivery \ninfrastructure, supporting revenue and expenditure management, and devolution \nof functions to villages and districts. \n\n66. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  6.  The  Government  has  already  spent $ 5.0 \nmillion  in  FY2002  from  its  own  resources,  while  $6.8  million  constitute  noncash  liabilities.  The \nnet cash outflow is estimated at $36.7 million. \n \n\n2. \n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period \n\n \nThe  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  24  years,  including  a \n67. \ngrace  period  of  8  years.  The  interest  charge  will  be  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  standard  procedures  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set \nforth in the Loan Agreement. \n \n68. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  available  for  withdrawal  in  two  tranches\u2014upon satisfactory \ncompliance  with  an  agreed-upon  number  of  eligible  conditions\u2014from  the  date  of  loan \neffectiveness up to the loan closing date, which is 30 June 2005. Compliance with the second \ntranche is expected by October 2004. \n \nD. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n69.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the PSMP. Because of the scope and complexity \nof  the  measures  that  need  to  be  implemented,  an  effective  PSMP  infrastructure  needs  to  be \nestablished to assure the quality and timeliness of implementation.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n \n\nThe  Government  has  established  a  program  coordination  committee  (PCC)  to  be \n70. \nchaired  by  the  Chief  Secretary,  and  comprising  the  Secretary  of  MOF,  secretaries  of  the \nrelevant  line  ministries,  and  deputy  governor  of  NRB.  The  PCC  will  coordinate  the  actions  of \nMOF  and  the  line  ministries,  monitor  the  progress  of  reforms,  and  address  any  major \ninterministerial issues related to program implementation. \n \n71. \n MOF  has  established  a  program  implementation  unit  (PIU)  to  ensure  the  timely \npreparation  and  implementation  of  the  program  measures.  The  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly \nprogress reports and brief the PCC monthly on the implementation status.  \n \n72. \nThe Privatization Committee (PC) will facilitate the process of disengagement from PEs. \nThe  PC  has  established  the  PCSC  in  the  MOF  staffed  with  suitably  qualified  government \nofficials  familiar  with  the  privatization  process  for  implementing  the  PC\u2019s  decisions.  Qualified \nstaff of MOF\u2019s privatization cell will report to the PCSC and will be trained to manage liquidation \nand privatization transactions. \n \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n \n73. \nDiscussions  with  the  Government  on  the  scope,  structure,  and  timing  of  the  PSMP \nbegan in May 2002. An initial agreement on the package of policy reforms was reached with the \nGovernment  in  June  2002  and  the  Government  started  implementing  agreed-upon policies in \nJuly 2002. To meet the urgent needs under the  current fiscal crisis, the PSMP period will be 30 \nmonths, beginning July 2002 through December 2004. The closing date will be 30 June 2005.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \n74. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local duties and \ntaxes)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member  countries,  other  than  ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  7)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement will be through normal commercial practices in case of procurement by the private \nsector,  or  through  prescribed  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  in  case  of  procurement  by  the \npublic sector, with due regard for the principles of economy and efficiency. \n \n75. \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed  to  the  Government  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired if, during each year in which the loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value \nof  the  Government\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports \nand imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the \nloan  amount  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  the  year.  The  Government  will,  however,  certify \nwith each withdrawal request its compliance with this formula. Otherwise, import documentation \nunder existing procedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. Loan proceeds may be used \nto  finance  eligible  imports  for  which  expenditures  were  incurred  180  days  before  the  loan \nbecomes effective. \n \n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nThe  counterpart  funds  in  local  currency  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \n76. \ndeposited in a special account to be established by MOF at NRB, immediately after the effective \ndate,  and  will  become  part  of  the  Government  budget.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22\n\n \n\n \n\ncounterpart funds are made available to meet the costs associated with implementation of the \nPSMP,  in  particular  (i)  the  payment  of  all  dues  to  staff  of  PEs  relating  to  or  following  from \nretrenchment, whether as a result of statutory provisions or otherwise, including, but not limited \nto,  wages  in  arrears,  and  other  benefits  such  as  pension  contributions  as  well  as  severance \nbenefits; (ii) payments of other liabilities of liquidated PEs; and (iii) other costs to implement the \nprogram. \n \n77. \nAll financial transactions of the special account will be recorded separately in a manner \nthat  allows  identification  of  expenditures  from  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds.  The \nAuditor-General of Nepal, or independent auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms \nof  reference  are  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  audit  the  accounts,  together  with  records  of \nexpenditures. NRB will submit to ADB certified copies of audited accounts and records within 9 \nmonths  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year,  starting  with  FY2004.  Within  3  months  of  the  loan \nclosing  date,  the  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  detailed  report  on  the  performance  of  the \nproposed  loan.  The  report  will  evaluate  implementation  of  the  activities  and  outputs  under  the \nPSMP; report the impact of the PSMP on the economy, including the social and poverty impact \nof the reforms; elaborate the lessons learned during the program; and identify the future reform \nagenda.  \n \n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n \n78. \nPerformance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly \nmonitor  and  review  the  progress  of  implementation  of  tranche  release  conditions  in  the  policy \nmatrix  (Appendix  8)  to  ensure  that  they  are  met  in  substance  and  on  schedule.    The \nestablishment of an effective PIU is essential for performance monitoring and evaluation.  The \nPIU will provide progress reports every four months to monitor implementation and evaluate the \nimpact  of  the  PSMP.  A  team  of  professional  staff  from  ADB\u2019s  Nepal  Resident  Mission  and \nHeadquarters  will  closely  supervise  program  implementation  and  maintain  high-level  policy \ndialogue with the Government. The PE component will be closely supervised by ADB and DFID, \nthrough  joint  review  missions.  A  full  review  will  be  undertaken  before  release  of  the  second \ntranche, which is scheduled for October 2004. \n \nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting. Annual program audits will be conducted by the \n79. \nOffice  of  the  Auditor  General  in  compliance  with  international  audit  standards  and  Nepal\u2019s \nspecific  regulations.  The  annual  audits  entail  audits  of  the  accounts,  the  PIU,  and  the  PC  in \nimplementing  reforms.  Reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  9  months  of  the  completion  of \neach financial year.   \n \n80. \n Tranching.  In  view  of  the  front  loading  of  the  policy  conditions,  the  first  tranche  of \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  14,085,000  ($20  million  equivalent)  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness  and  after  the  first  tranche  conditions  have  been  met.  The  second  tranche  of \nSpecial Drawing Rights 10,564,000 ($15 million equivalent), will be released approximately 15 \nmonths after the first tranche, and upon compliance with the second-tranche release conditions \nas set out in the policy matrix.  \n  \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n\nADB  provided  technical  assistance  to  help  the  Government  prepare  information  and \n81. \nlegal advice on the status of PEs, in particular those considered for liquidation and privatization \nunder the PSMP. An outline of the approach for accelerated privatization and liquidation of PEs \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\n \n\nwas  prepared.  The  preparation  of  the  PSMP  has,  however,  highlighted  the  lack  of  adequate \nstaffing and weak institutional capacity of the Privatization Cell, and the inadequate institutional \narrangements  and  processes  to  facilitate  privatization.  The  standstill  of  privatization  measures \nover  the  9FYP  (1997\u20132002)  period  was  accompanied  by  a  drain  of  experienced  staff  to  other \nunits  of  the  Government,  and  an  erosion  of  skills  at  the  cell.  As  a  result,  more  effective \ninstitutional arrangements and substantial technical assistance are required.20  \n \n82. \nObjective.    The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  (i)  developing  and  implementing  an \neffective  privatization/liquidation  process,  (ii)  building  capacity  within  the  Government  for \nundertaking  divestment,  (iii)  managing  and  supervising  the  transactions,  (iv)  implementing  an \neffective and fair policy for Labor rationalization, and (v) supporting the overall management of \nthe program. \n\n83. \nScope.  The  liquidation  and  privatization  transactions  will  be  carried  out  by  consultants \ncontracted  by  the  PCSC,  established  under  the  PC.  The  PCSC  will  be  in  charge  of  (i) \ncontracting out the initial studies for valuation of the PEs and proposal of modality; (ii) submitting \nprivatization/liquidation  proposals  to  the  PC  for  their  endorsement,  and  of  the  Cabinet;  (iii) \nestablishing liquidation transaction teams and contracting the expertise on enterprise, industrial \nrelations,  legal,  and  communications  expertise  to  effectively  manage  the  process  with \nconcerned stakeholders; (iv) managing payment of dues to staff and creditors; (v) managing the \nsale  and  transfer  of  assets;  and  (vi)  creating  technical  capacity  within  the  Government  for \nundertaking divestment.    \n\n84. \n\nThree types of advisory services are required:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nsenior policy advisers (ADB financing) to advise the Government and the PC on \nthe  proper  design  and  implementation  of  the  privatization/liquidation  strategy, \nand the Labor rationalization policy; \n\ntransaction  management  advisers  (ADB  financing)  to  support  the  PCSC  in \nbuilding  capacity  within  the  Government  through  methodological  and  on-the-job \ntraining  to  manage  its  tasks  noted  above,  especially  on  issues  of  contracting \nconsultants  in  charge  of  administering  liquidation/privatization  and  supervising \nthe transaction administrators/liquidators.  \n\ntransaction  administrators/liquidators  (proposed  DFID  financing)  to conduct the \nprivatization  transactions  based  on  performance-based  contracts  and  pre-\ndetermined  time  limits  for  completing  each  transaction,  including  the  full \nsettlement of dues to staff and creditors. These consultants will be contracted by  \nthe Government and closely supervised by the transaction management advisers \nengaged under the TA. \n\nIn addition, the TA will help the PIU execute its performance monitoring and evaluation \n\n85. \nfunctions. \n\n \n\n86. \nCost and Financing. The TA is estimated to cost $1.925 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign exchange of $0.698 million and the local currency cost of $1.227 million equivalent. ADB \nwill provide $425,000 equivalent to finance $183,000 or 26.2% of the foreign exchange cost and \n$242,000 or 19.7% of the local currency cost. ADB will finance the TA on a grant basis under \n\n                                                 \n20 See Appendix 2 for background analysis and Appendix 3 for details of the proposed TA. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24\n\n \n\n \n\nthe  ADB-funded  TA  program.  The  Government  and  DFID  are  in  the  process  of  finalizing  the \nunderstanding  on \ntransaction \nadministrators/liquidators  and  the  modalities  for  DFID  parallel  financing  of  the  TA. 21  DFID\u2019s \nshare will be equivalent to 62.3 % of the total TA cost. The Government\u2019s share will be 15.5%, \nand ADB\u2019s share 22.2%.  \n\nfor  DFID  provision  of  parallel  TA \n\nthe  conditions \n\nfor \n\n87. \nImplementation  Arrangements. For PE liquidation and privatization, the PC will be the \nExecuting Agency and the PCSC will be the Implementing Agency for the TA. The PCSC will be \nstaffed  by  at  least  five  suitably  qualified  persons,  at  least  three  of  whom  will  be  on  a  full-time \nbasis. The Government will provide free office space and telephone, free utility access and use \nto  all  consultants.  The  ADB  funded  TA  will  cover  42  person-months  of  individual  consulting \nservices: 6 person-months of international expertise, and 36 of domestic expertise for the tasks \ndescribed in para. 84 (i) and (ii). The services for the tasks described in para. 84 (iii) will entail \nan estimated 20 person-months for each liquidation and sale.  \n \n88. \nPIU in the management of the Program. \n    \n \n\nSix  person-months  of  domestic  expertise  will  be  required  to  intermittently  support  the \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n \n89. \nThe  major  benefit  of  the  Program  will  be  the  enhanced  capacity  of  the  Government to \nimplement  its  poverty  reduction  strategy.  Since  the  Government  is  faced  with  a  severe  fiscal \ncrisis,  the  PSMP  will  assist  the  Government  in  improving  expenditure  management,  and \nstrengthening  revenue  mobilization  and  management.  The  benefits  of  prioritizing  and \nstreamlining expenditures, reducing the fiscal burden on account of PEs, and improving revenue \nmobilization  and  tax  administration  will  be  of  long-term  nature  and  will  be  sustained  much \nbeyond the PSMP period.  \n\n \n\n90. \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  disengaging  itself  from  ownership  and \nmanagement  of  PEs,  but  attempts  in  the  recent  past  have  been  unsuccessful  because  of \npolitical  instability,  inadequate  professional  and  financial  resources,  and  lack  of  a  clear-cut \nstrategy.  The  PSMP  will  improve  the  legal  environment  for  the  corporate  sector,  improve \ncorporate  governance  especially  in  the  PEs,  and  streamline  the  disengagement  process.  The \nliquidation  of  the  nine  PEs  under  the  PSMP  will  be  the  starting  point  in  accelerating  the \nGovernment\u2019s disengagement. As the process gains momentum, it will have a positive medium- \nto  long-term  impact  on  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  position,  and  simultaneously  encourage  the \nprivate  sector  to  play  a  more  active  role  in  the  development  of  the  country. Over the medium \nterm,  privatization  and  liquidation  of  PEs  will  generate  significant  benefits  by  reducing  of \ncontingent  liabilities  on  the  budget  and  supporting  a  gradual  shift  of  resources  to  priority \nexpenditures. \n \nPoor  public  sector  governance  is  a  major  factor  impeding  the  rapid  economic \n91. \ndevelopment  of  the  country.  The  PSMP  pushes  the  reform  agenda  of  ADB\u2019s  GRP  further  by \nstreamlining  public  administration\u2014eliminating  vacant  civil  service  positions  and  freezing \n\n                                                 \n21 In the event that the TA with DFID financing does not materialize, the Government will use its own resources for \nfunding the DFID\u2019s proposed financing by  making an allocation of $0.6 million each in the budgets of FY2004 and \nFY2005. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\n \n\nImpacts \n\nrecruitment.  The  reform  will  positively  impact  on  the  budget  over  the  medium  term.  By \nsupporting  the  devolution  of  public  services,  the  PSMP  will  encourage  more  effective  use  of \nresources  and  enhanced  participation  of  local  beneficiaries.  The  PSMP  will  also  enhance  the \naccountability and transparency of civil servants and will thus check corruption. \n  \nB. \n \n92. \nThe major impact of the PSMP will be assisting the Government to achieve the 10FYP\u2019s \npoverty reduction target. Poverty is expected to be reduced over the program period by about \n6%\u2014from 38% to 32%. Along with reduced poverty, the 10FYP\u2019s resource allocation pattern will \nlead to improvement in key social indicators. With better expenditure management and resource \nmobilization efforts, the fiscal position will gradually improve and result in higher allocations for \ndevelopment expenditure. The PSMP will simultaneously support the allocation of development \nresources to projects depending on their poverty impact, and institute a system for performance-\nbased budget release for priority projects. The fiscal position will also improve with the reduced \nbudgetary  transfers  to  the  PEs  and  the  liquidation/privatization  of  nine  PEs.  The  PSMP  will \nsupport  the  Government  in  developing  and  adopting  a  medium-term  strategy  for  disengaging \nfrom PE management and ownership. The Program will also support rightsizing the civil service, \naccelerate  the  pace  of  on-going  decentralization,  and  enhance  the  transparency  and \naccountability  of  the  public  sector.  The  PSMP  will  improve  the  legal  and  institutional \nenvironment for the corporate sector, and thus broaden the role of the private sector. \n \nC. \n \nSuccessful implementation of the PSMP is contingent on a number of key assumptions, \n93. \nsubject to varying degrees of risks, but appropriate mitigating measures have been put in place. \nAt  the  same  time,  the  program  measures  have  been  designed  to  support  and  strengthen \nongoing  restructuring  processes,  and  the  new  initiatives  are  within  the  capacity  of  the \nGovernment to implement.  \n\nPossible Risks \n\n \n94. \nThe PSMP assumes that the fiscal situation will not deteriorate further to require a bigger \ncut in development expenditure and in the poverty reduction efforts. This could happen due to \nextraneous  reasons,  such  as  the  worsening  of  the  global political and economic environment, \nover  which  the  Government  has  little  control.  Sluggish  domestic  economic  growth  could  also \nadversely  affect  the  Government\u2019s  revenue  mobilization  effort.  By  prioritizing  projects  in \naccordance with their poverty reduction impact, the Government will, to a large extent, be able \nto  mitigate  a  serious  impact  of  fiscal  constraints  on  poverty  reduction  efforts.  Another  risk  is \nwhether the Government will have adequate political will to drop (or merge) low-priority projects. \nThe  Government  has  already  displayed  its  determination  to  manage  public  resources  more \nefficiently  by  reducing  the  number  of  development  projects  by  25%  in  FY2003.  Similarly,  the \nGovernment  has  renewed  its  efforts  to  reform  PEs  and  has  made  a  public  statement  in  its \nEconomic  Reforms  Program  in  October  2002.  In  support  of  this  changed  attitude  toward  PE \nreforms,  under  the  PSMP  the  Government  has  already  approved  the  liquidation  of  five  PEs. \nLiquidators have been appointed and the liquidation process is ongoing.  \n\n \n95. \nThe  Government  has,  in  the  past,  demonstrated  a  positive  attitude  toward  reform \nagreements with international development partners. The political instability caused by frequent \nchanges  in  Government,  and  internal  security  problems  have  adversely  affected  the \nGovernment\u2019s ability to implement reforms effectively and at the required pace. This is likely to \nchange  as  the  Government  and  the  CPN/M  are  working  toward  a  negotiated  settlement,  and \nprospects are good that lasting peace will be established. Peace is likely to reduce the risk of \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26\n\n \n\n \n\ndelay in PSMP\u2019s implementation, but it must to be emphasized that a successful completion of \nthe peace process will take time, and the risks of some political instability in the interim period \ncannot be ruled out. However, during the preparation of the PSMP, discussions were held with \nthe representatives of the opposition political parties, labor unions, and aid agencies. There is \nsupport  for  the  PSMP\u2019s  objectives,  both  within  and  outside  the  Government.  There  was \nunanimity  of  opinion  that  to  meet  the  10FYP\u2019s  objectives,  the  pace  of  reforms  must  be \nsignificantly accelerated. The PSMP will play a catalytic role in the process. Given the political \ncommitment, arrangements agreed upon with the Government will ensure timely implementation \nof the PSMP. The Government has assured ADB that the PIU in MOF will be adequately staffed \nand  will  have  the  capacity  to  implement  and  monitor  the  agreed  upon  reform  measures.  In \naddition, PCSC under the PC will manage the implementation of the PE reform measures. TA-\nfinanced consultants will assist the Government in managing the privatization/liquidation of PEs \nand will also create critical capacity within the Government to undertake future divestment.  \n \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n96. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nThe Government will ensure that policies adopted and actions taken prior to the \ndate  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  as  described  in  the  Development  Policy  Letter \n(Appendix 8) will continue to be in effect of the duration of the PSMP period. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  for  the  duration  of  the  PSMP  implementation, \nthe budget allocations for block grants to local bodies will stay at least at the level \nof FY02 \n\nThe  Government  will  continue  its  overall  policy  of  freezing  new  recruitment  for \nvacant  civil  servant  positions.  For  any  exceptional  recruitment  for  frozen \nvacancies, this will only be done after a proper job assessment has been carried \nout and an agreement has been reached between MOF and MOGA. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Company  Ordinance,  the  Secured \nTransactions Ordinance and the Insolvency Ordinance will be renewed on a six-\nmonthly basis until such time as the Parliament is reconstituted, at which time the \nOrdinances will be submitted to the Parliament for passage as Acts.  \n\nThe Government will ensure that all necessary actions are taken to discharge its \nobligations due to creditors arising from liquidation, sale of assets, and transfer of \nunsold assets of PEs to Government. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  for  all  closed,  liquidated  or  privatized  PEs, \nwhether  in  part  or  in  whole,  all  obligations  to  staff  relating  to  or  following  from \nretrenchment,  whether  as  a  result  of  statutory  provisions  or  else  wise,  will  be \ncomplied with. \n\n(vii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that the taskforce established to develop the policy \non  retrenchment  in  case  of  liquidation  or  sale  will  include  all  stakeholders, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\n \n\nincluding  representatives  of  employees  of  PEs,  line  ministries  responsible  for \nPEs,  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  MOF,  labor  unions,  and  independent  experts  on \nprivatization and retrenchment issues. \n \n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that in the event of sale of land, as core or non-core \nassets of PEs to be liquidated, closed or privatized, or any other action taken that \nmight lead to resettlement effects, the ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \nwill be complied with. \n\n \n(ix)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, MO F will establish a system for semi-\nannual reporting by all PEs on their performance, profitability, balance sheet and \ncost flows.  \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \n\nThe following condition for loan effectiveness has been incorporated into the draft loan \n\n \nB. \n\n97. \nagreement: \n \n\nThe  Government  shall  have  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  Government  of  the \nUnited  Kingdom  regarding  the  DFID  grant  or  shall  have  made  other  arrangements \nacceptable to ADB for the financing of the transactions administration component of the \nTA. \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n98. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 24,649,000 to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Public Sector Management \nProgram  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter;  a  term  of  24  years,  including  the  grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n \n17 June 2003 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n28\n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \n\nTHE SECTOR-REVENUE MOBILIZATION AND EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT EFFORTS \n\nRevenue Mobilization Reforms \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  recent  years,  the  Government  has  adopted  several  key  reform  measures  aimed  at \n1. \nreducing tax-induced distortions, strengthening tax administration, and making the tax laws and \nprocedures both simple and transparent. The Income Tax Act of 2001 rationalizes the income \ntax  regime  and  promotes  neutrality  of  taxation  in  various  income-generating  activities.  The \nmajor features of the Act include measures to check transfer-pricing and to expand the tax net \nby  including  export  earnings,  dividends,  pensions,  foreign  earnings  from  insurance,  and \nprovident fund deposits. The number of tax slabs has been reduced to 2, compared with 10 a \ndecade back, and a self-assessment system has been implemented.  \n\nAmendments were made on the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act, which now requires better \n2. \nmaintenance  of  records  and  makes  penal  provisions  more  explicit.  The  coverage  of  VAT  has \nbeen expanded to include services such as health (provided by private hospitals), auditing, and \nlegal services. Moreover, the VAT has been extended up to the retail stage to assist in shifting \nthe tax base from international trade to domestic consumption and establish VAT as the main \nsource of domestic resource mobilization. A single VAT rate of 10% was adopted to facilitate tax \nadministration  and  to  achieve  greater  transparency.  Similarly,  the  new  Excise  Act  aims  at \nharmonizing and updating excise administration and expanding its scope by bringing new areas \nwithin  the  excise  net.  A  draft  Customs  Act  was  prepared  to  reform  customs  administration. \nNepal  also  introduced  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  valuation  system  to  reduce \ndiscretionary  power  in  customs  valuation.  This  measure  is  also  expected  to  bring  customs \nvaluation closer to the market price and facilitate the administration of VAT. As part of improving \ncustoms administration, a recent version of the Harmonized System was introduced.  \n\n \n3. \nA  number  of  other  measures  were  also  adopted  to  streamline  the  administration  of \ntaxes.  An  Inland  Revenue  Department  (IRD)  was  established  by  merging  the  erstwhile \nDepartment  of  Taxation  and  Value  Added  Tax  Department.  This  measure  is  expected  to \nincrease  efficiency,  improve  enforcement,  and  reduce  administrative  cost.  Twenty-one  inland \nrevenue  offices  (IROs)  were  set  up  in  the  field  to  expand  the  reach  of  the  tax  system.  To \nimprove the client orientation of the IRD, a separate Taxpayers Service Section was established \nin each IRO to enhance the quality of service to the taxpayers. The Government also expanded \nthe Permanent Account Number (PAN) system, and efforts are ongoing to integrate both VAT \nand the income tax with the PAN system to simplify the administrative procedures. \n\n4. \nThe  use  of  information  technology  was  expanded  to  strengthen  tax  administration.  All \nIROs  and  major  customs  points  have  been  automated  and  connected  with  the  central \ninformation system in their respective departments. The introduction of the Automated  System \nof Customs Data simplified the customs process and helped establish a better information base \nfor the tax system.  \n\n5. \nAs  part  of  the  tax  collection  drive,  a  Voluntary  Disclosure  of  Income  Scheme  was \nintroduced  in  the  FY2002  budget  to  give  taxpayers  an  opportunity  to  clear  their  undeclared \nincome tax liabilities. The scheme required disclosure of undeclared income by February 2002. \nAccording  to  the  Government\u2019s  estimates,  the  scheme  brought  an  additional  2,200  taxpayers \ninto  the  tax  net,  increased  tax  awareness  among  taxpayers,  and  generated  an  additional \nincome tax of NRs440 million.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n 29\n\nReforms in Expenditure Management \n\nSome actions were also initiated to reduce the leakage in revenue collection. A Central \n6. \nMonitoring  Unit  was  established  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance (MOF) and enforcement measures \nare being implemented to improve the billing system of VAT, with provision of heavy penalties \non  defaulters.  Tax  officials  are  being  assigned  to  enforce  VAT  laws  and  to  bring  potential \ntaxpayers within the VAT net. The Revenue Leakage Control Act is being amended to make it \nmore effective in controlling revenue leakage.  In addition, a nine-point Code of Conduct aimed \nat  developing  transparent,  accountable,  performance-oriented  revenue  administration  was \ndeveloped for revenue administration employees. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe  Government  has  announced  a  number  of  reform  measures  aimed  at  containing \npublic expenditure and improving its efficiency. In March 2001, the Public Expenditure Review \nCommission  (PERC)  recommended  several  measures  for  efficient  management  of  public \nexpenditure. Some of the key recommendations are streamlining and rationalizing Government \nministries/departments  to  better  focus  the  delivery  of  public  goods  and  services;  prioritizing \ndevelopment  projects/programs  by  more  rigorous  screening  criteria  and  using  project \nimplementation  performance  criteria  for  allocating  resources;  developing  a  5-year  (FY2002\u2013\nFY2006)  expenditure  prioritization  framework  for  better  fiscal  management;  pension  reform \nthrough  shared  contribution;  civil  service  reforms  to  increase  accountability  and  rightsize  key \nministries;  improving  financial  management  and  internal  auditing  systems;  and  promoting \ndecentralization  especially  in  education  and  agriculture  extension  services.  The  PERC  also \nrecommended  that  the  delivery  of  health,  education,  and  agriculture  extension  services  at  the \nlocal  level  should  be  entrusted  to  local  bodies  with  managerial  responsibilities.  These  bodies \nshould  be  allocated  grants  equivalent  to  that  allocated  to  the  central  organization.  Another \nsignificant recommendation of the PERC was that the Government should be shareholder and \nnot  manager  of  PEs  and  the  management  of  its  investment  should  be  entrusted  to  a  single \nministry, which should be responsible for the privatization of the PEs. \n \n8. \nimplement  148 \nrecommendations  of  PERC  over  the  next  3  years.  A significant measure emanating from the \nrecommendations  of  the  PERC  has  been  the  adoption  of  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure \nFramework,  essentially  a  fiscal  management  tool  to  meet  the  core  objectives  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction strategy within a given time frame and resource constraints. In \nview of the acute scarcity of resources to meet the development needs of the country, projects \nwill be scrutinized based on their poverty reduction impact. This three-year budgeting framework \nwas introduced in the FY2003 budget and covers five core ministries: Ministry of Agriculture and \nCooperatives, Ministry of Education and Sports, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Water Resources, \nand Ministry of Physical Planning and Works.  \n\nThe  Government  announced  a \n\ntime-bound  action  plan \n\nto \n\n \nThe Government amended the financial administrations rules to simplify the procedures, \n9. \nenhance  transparency,  and  ensure  timely  completion  of  projects.  The  amendment  delegates \nfinancial authority to department chiefs, provides for multiyear funding and tendering of priority \nprojects,  and  introduces  transparent  procedures  in  the  tendering  processes.  A  network  of \nDistrict  Expenditure  Control  System  was  established,  covering  46  district  treasury  control \noffices, and will be extended to cover 17 more districts. The financial management information \nsystem  was  also  strengthened;  as  a  result,  the  Financial  and  Comptroller  General\u2019s  Office  is \nnow able to submit annual accounts within a stipulated time period. \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n30\n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \n\nRecent Initiatives \n\nC. \n \n10. \nThe  Government  has  announced  some  recent  initiatives  in  the  Economic  Reforms \nProgram  of  2002.1  The  Government  is  in  the  process  of  strengthening  the  Central  Monitoring \nUnit  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  a  program  is  being  initiated  for  monitoring  revenue  offices \nand  for  more  effective  supervision  to  ensure  that  the  targeted  revenue  collection  materializes. \nRegular  market  surveys  will  be  conducted  by  teams  comprising  representatives  of  the  private \nsector, to broaden the tax network. The Government also plans to adopt a post-clearance audit \nof  customs  valuation  and  undervalued  imported  goods  will  be  confiscated.  An  automated \nsystem  of  customs  data  system  is  being  extended  to  three  more  points  of  entry  of  imported \ngoods in Kakarbhitta, Krishnanagar, and Tatopani. To facilitate more effective implementation of \nthe  Income  Tax  Act  of  2002,  the  Government  is  in  the  process  of  adopting  simplified returns, \nand  preparing  manuals,  pamphlets,  and  brochures  to  better  explain  the  provisions  of  the  Act. \nGreater  involvement  of  the  private  sector  is  being  sought  to  make  tax  administration  more \neffective  and  transparent.  The  Department  of  Inland  Revenue  will  also  be  provided  with  more \nresources to check revenue leakages, and to initiate special investigation and control programs. \nThe  Government  plans  to  narrow  down  in  FY2003  the  number  of  goods  exempted  from  VAT \nand bring them under the tax net gradually. \n \n11. \nThe Government announced that its decision to adhere to strict austerity, while ensuring \nadequate  funding  for  priority  projects  will  continue.  Further,  when  releasing  budgetary \nresources, priority will be given to basic social sector requirements such as those for education, \nhealth,  and  drinking  water.  Simultaneously,  a  strict  check  will  be  made  on  employment  in  the \nGovernment,  and  redundant  positions  will  be  eliminated  in  FY2003  and  FY2004.  Austerity \nmeasures were also introduced for expenditure on seminars and conferences, travel abroad by \nGovernment servants, medical allowances, procurement of vehicles and furniture, and building \nconstruction. \n \n\n \n\n                                                                 \n1 Economic Reforms Program. 2002. His Majesty\u2019s Government, Ministry of Finance, Kathmandu, 31October 2002. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nTHE SECTOR\u2013DISENGAGEMENT FROM PUBLIC ENTERPRISES \n\n \n\n \nA. \n \n\nBackground and Issues \n\n1.  \n\nPublic Enterprises \n\nthe  PC  became  dysfunctional \n\nthrough  excessive  delegation  of \n\n \n1. \nMost of Nepal\u2019s public enterprises (PEs) were established in the 1960s and early 1970s \nat  a  period  when  the  role  of  Government  as  producer  and  service  provider was emphasized. \nDuring the 1980s the Government recognized the need for commercial orientation. However, it \nwas not until the early 1990s that the Government undertook a significant effort to move in that \ndirection and consider privatization as a serious option. \n \nfirst \nGovernment  Strongly  Supported  Privatization  During  8th  Plan.  The \n2. \ndemocratically  elected  Government  recognized  that  the  significant  budget  drain  to  support \nunprofitable PEs was no longer justified in a more liberalized economic environment. Under the \n8th  5-year  plan  (1992-1997),  the  Privatization  Act  (1994)  became  effective  and  18  PEs  were \nprivatized.  \n \n3. \nVolatile Political Environment Leads to Standstill of Privatization During 9th Plan. \nDuring  1997\u20132002  only  one  of  the  planned  30  enterprises  was  successfully  privatized.  In  a \nvolatile political environment, members of the Privatization Committee (PC) changed frequently. \nUltimately \nto \nsubcommittees  and  disagreement  over  modalities.  Privatization  was  also  blocked  by  labor \nunrest. Potential investors lost interest since bidding documents usually required the takeover of \nexisting large liabilities. Since 2001, privatization has been further hampered due to an adverse \ninvestment climate characterized by recession, and deteriorating security and political situation. \nIn view of the currently tight budgetary situation and large and increasing contingent liabilities, \nthe  Government  now  recognizes  that  it  can  no  longer  afford  operating  PEs,  in  which  it  has \ninvested  over  $500  million  equivalent  in  share  capital  from  1997  to  2002,  and  that  it  must \ndisengage from nonsocially sensitive PE operations.  \n \n4. \nProfile of PEs.  The  official  reports  published  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  list  39 \nPEs, among which 21 were established under the Company Act, 5 under the Corporation Act, 8 \nunder Special Acts and 5 under other legislation.1 The 39 PEs reportedly employ about 46,000 \npeople at the end of FY2003. The PEs established under Special Acts represent about 90% of \nGovernment  equity  in  PEs.  These  Acts  provide  special  powers  to  the  PEs\u2019  board  and \nmanagement, including powers to issue by-laws, which are used to determine staff benefits and \nto  borrow.  These  powers  have  contributed  significantly  to  contingent  liabilities  for  the \nGovernment. \n \nAssets and Equity Are Highly Concentrated in a Few PEs. The net assets of the 39 \n5. \nPEs are estimated to amount to NRs198 billion ($2.5 billion) in 2002 and are concentrated in a \nfew  large  entities.  One  utility  enterprise,  two  banks,  and  one  industrial  enterprise  represent \nroughly 90% of PE assets. Utilities represent by far the largest share of PE equity (80%), while \nthe  equity  of  the  state-owned  financial  institutions  has  been  eroded  because  of  poor  loan \nportfolio quality. The PEs in the trade and industry sectors are performing poorly. Although small \nin asset size, these units represent about 30% of PE employment. In about one third of the 21 \n\nissues \n\n                                                                 \n1   Corporations  created  under  the  Corporation  Act  and  Communication  Act  are  exclusively  Government  owned. \nThese entities are established and dissolved through notice in the public gazette. Companies that are incorporated \nunder the Company Act include publicly and privately owned shareholding companies. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nindustrial and trade PEs, reported liabilities exceed assets, and nearly all are incurring losses. In \nalmost all cases, reported assets are significantly below actual liabilities because of accrual of \ntaxes and employee obligations. The true financial position of these enterprises is known to be \nmuch  worse  since  international  accounting and auditing principles are not applied to measure \nthe accuracy of accounts and check the integrity of management information.  \n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nTable A2.1: Flow of Funds Between Government and Public Enterprises \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNRs million \n\n$ million \n\nFY1998 FY1999 FY2000  FY2001 \nEstimate \n\nFY2002 \nEstimate \n\nTotal \nFY1998-\nFY2002 \n\nAverage \nFY1998-\nFY2002 \n\n  FY2002 \nEstimate \n\nTotal \nFY1998-\nFY2002 \n\nAverage \nFY1998-\nFY2002 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n118  \n27  \n87  \n4  \n0  \n  \n\n96  \n14  \n31  \n22  \n28  \n  \n(23) \n  \n31  \n\n39,207  \n7,861  \n28,392  \n2,818  \n137  \n  \n\n36,504  \n8,689  \n10,334  \n7,594  \n9,887  \n  \n(2,703) \n  \n10,334  \n\n7,841  \n1,572  \n5,678  \n564  \n27  \n  \n\n7,301  \n1,738  \n2,067  \n1,519  \n1,977  \n  \n(541) \n  \n2,067  \n\n503  \n101  \n364  \n36  \n2  \n  \n\n468  \n111  \n132  \n97  \n127  \n  \n(35) \n  \n132  \n\n101  \n20  \n73  \n7  \n0  \n  \n\n94  \n22  \n26  \n19  \n25  \n  \n(7) \n  \n26  \n\n(13,037) \n\n(2,607) \n\n(53) \n\n(167) \n\n(33) \n\n  \n\n578 \n55 \n\n699 \n5 \n  \n\n988 \n77 \n  \n\n9,225  \n2,140  \n6,800  \n285  \n0  \n  \n\nOutflows to \n7,563  6,214  7,951  8,255  \nPEs \nShare Capital  1,839  1,420  1,373  1,089  \n4,659  4,090  5,945  6,898  \nLoan \n268  \nSubsidy \n0  \nCapital Grant \n \n  \nInflows from \nPEs \nIncome Tax \nDividend \nInterest \nPrincipal \n  \nNet Flow \nLess \nDividends  \nOutflow \nbefore \ndividends  \nPEs = public enterprises. \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Economic Survey Fiscal Year 2002. \n \n\n4,913  6,830  8,523  8,784  \n1,318  1,150  2,190  2,928  \n1,195  1,780  2,623  2,336  \n1,153  1,660  1,568  1,463  \n1,248  2,240  2,142  2,057  \n  \n  \n529  \n616 \n  \n  \n1,195  1,780  2,623  2,336  \n\n  \n(2,649)\n  \n\n7,453  \n1,103  \n2,400  \n1,750  \n2,200  \n  \n(1,772) \n  \n2,400  \n\n(3,844) (1,164) (2,050)\n\n(4,172) \n\n(1,807) \n\n573 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n2. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Policy Issues  \n\n \n6. \nCorporate  Governance  Is  Poorly  Developed  and  Commercial  Orientation  Is \nLacking. Currently the line ministries supervise the PEs. While 21 PEs are supervised by the \nMinistry  of  Industry,  Commerce,  and  Supply,2  the  importance  of  the  MOF  and  the  Ministry  of \nWater Resources, which supervise the larger entities, is more significant. The boards of Nepal \nElectricity  Authority  (NEA),3  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Nepal  are  chaired  by  the  line \nministers. The heavy board representation by ex -officio members of Government and political \nappointees has undermined the independence, commercial orientation, and the development of \na professional culture in the boards of the PEs. Frequent changes in Government have resulted \nin  unstable  board  composition,  politicization,  and  appointment  of  management  on \nnonprofessional considerations, which is common practice in the recruitment of staff throughout \nPEs and has led to significant overemployment and redundancy of staff. The absence of sound \ncorporate  governance  structures  has  blurred  the  objectives  of  PEs.  Commercial  orientation, \npreservation  of  assets,  and  orientation  to  cash  flow  and  profitability  are  largely  nonexistent.  In \n\n                                                                 \n2  Enterprises operating in the industry and trading sector and established mainly under the Company Law.  \n3  NEA is by far the largest PE, representing about one third of PE assets, and 20% of PE employment. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\nthe  absence  of  clear  objectives  and  controls,  PE  management  have  no  incentive to establish \nbasic accounting and supporting management systems to monitor the soundness of operations. \nUnder  the  Program  the  Government  agreed  to  remove  ministers  and  political  appointees  from \nthe boards of PEs and has issued an order to that effect. However, their line ministers currently \nstill chair NEA and the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal boards. \n \n7. \nLegal and Regulatory Framework, and Enforcement Mechanisms Are Weak. There \nare  important  gaps  in  the  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  and  their  enforcement. Although a \ncompany law was enacted in 1997, its coverage is incomplete and enforcement weak. Lack of \nadequate  legislation  and  regulation  for  companies,  company  insolvency,  and  secured \ntransactions has hampered the development of orderly market entry and exit of companies, the \nenforcement  mechanisms  of  contractual  obligations,  sound  disclosure,  credit  and  investor \nrights,  and  the  accountability  of  boards  and  management  of  firms.  Since  most  PEs  are \norganized  under  the  Company  Law,  the  revision  of  the  Company  Law,  and  supporting \nInsolvency  and  Secured  Transactions  Laws  and  pertinent  implementing  regulations  will  be \nimportant  milestones  in  setting  up  the  framework  for  improving  corporate  governance  and  the \ndivisions  of  the  legislative,  judicial,  and  executive  powers  to  the  cabinet,  courts,  and  the \nGovernment ministries and the orderly exit of PEs. \n\n \n3. \n\nFiscal Risk and Financial Accountability \n\n \n \n8. \nDespite  Budget  Support  Most  PEs  Are  Unprofitable.  Despite  annual  transfers  for \nshare capital of $28 million, 17 PEs reported annual operating losses of about $12 million in the \nFY2002 ($53 million, FY2001).4 The same enterprises reportedly accumulated losses equivalent \nto  $149  million.  Only  half  of  the  PEs  submit  accounts  on  time,  limiting  the  validity  of  this \ninformation.  The  Office  of  Auditor  General  audits  confirm  that  poor  record  maintenance  is \ncommon, profits overstated, and losses understated. To stem the inherent losses and to contain \ncontingent liabilities\u2014the full size of which is unknown\u2014decisive action is required to dispose of \nthe PEs. \n \n9. \nAssets  Are  Not  Properly  Recognized  and  Valued.  Even  large  PEs  fail  to  maintain \nconsistent records for financial reports. NEA\u2019s FY2001 audit report revealed that inventories for \nits  substantial  fixed  assets  are  not  properly  maintained.  Likewise  government-owned  banks \noverstate  the  asset  quality  of  their  loan  portfolio  and  revenues  through  inadequate  asset \nclassification,  lack  of  reports  on  debt  rescheduling,  and  low  levels  of  risk  provisioning.  More \nadequate provisioning  alone  is  likely  to  present  negative  equity  values  for  these  banks.  The \nAsian Development Bank-financed financial reviews of Agriculture Development Bank of Nepal \nand Nepal Industrial Development Corporation, as well as the forthcoming World Bank-financed \naudits  of  Rastriya  Banijya  Bank  (RBB)  and  Nepal  Bank  Limited  (NBL)  will  permit  the \nunderstanding of the true financial position of the largest banks. \n \n10. \nPoor  Accounting  and  Reporting  Increases  Fiscal  Risks  and  Undermines  Good \nCorporate Governance. Poor quality of financial information is a major obstacle to professional \ncommercial management and accountability of PEs. Although the Government recognizes that \nfinancial  reporting \nmost  PEs  are \nrequirements would greatly improve understanding of the true financial situation, management \nand supervision of PEs. Under the Program, the Government will introduce periodical financial \nreporting by the PEs. \n \n\nintroducing  of  simple  regular \n\ntechnically \n\ninsolvent, \n\n                                                                 \n4  In addition, line ministries are known to extend significant budget support to PEs. \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nUnfunded  Liabilities  to  Employees  Are  Large.  Currently  PE  accounts  ignore  or \n11. \nunderstate  the  cost  and  future  liabilities  of  staff  benefits,  retirement,  and  separation.  A  recent \nstudy  by  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  consultants  underscored  the \nlarge  size  of  contingent  liabilities  in  the  case  of  PE  labor rationalization. The study estimated \n$300 million unfunded liabilities of PEs should all staff be retrenched. Also tax collection rules \nseem  to  constitute  important  potential  revenue  losses.  The  mismatch  between  monthly \ndeduction  of  income  tax  from  salaries  and  the  annual  payment  of  income  taxes  increases  the \nrisk of unfunded income tax liabilities.  \n \n12. \nPEs Are Overly Leveraged. PE borrowing is not properly recorded at the Nepal Rastra \nBank, which reported in October 2001 an exposure to PEs to banks of about NRs2.7 billion ($35 \nmillion).  More  recently  one  larger  bank  alone  reported  credit  and  guarantee  exposure  to  PEs \nexceeding  $40  million,  of  which  70%  were  classified  as  substandard  and  below.  As  a  result, \nsubstantial contingent liabilities are in Government-owned banks. Since most lending to PEs is \nfrom Government-owned banks, and creditor rights gain low priority in the case of bankruptcy, \nthe Government is bearing the consequences of default.   \n \n13. \nContingent  Liabilities  Are  Likely  To  Worsen.  While  management  contracts  are \noperational  for  the  two  largest  banks,  the  overall  lack  of  commercial  management  of  PEs, \nexternal interference, and the absence of business incentives and sound accounting, disclosure, \nand  controls  create  a  very  challenging  environment  for the buildup of a commercial culture in \nPEs.  Measures  such  as  aggressive  loan  recovery  and  rightsizing  of  PE  staff  are  important  to \nstem  the  inflow  of  additional  contingent  liabilities.  Decisive  action  is  required  to  liquidate \nunprofitable  enterprises,  to  disengage  the  Government  from  commercial  activity  through \nprivatization, and to strictly control performance, cost of operations, and borrowing of PEs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned from Nepal\u2019s Privatization Process \n\n \nAs stipulated in the Privatization Act, the  PC is the executive organ for privatization. The \n14. \nPC is chaired by the minister of finance and composed of chairman, finance committee (House \nof  Representatives),  two  members  of  Parliament  designated  by  Government,  member  of  the \nNational  Planning  Commission,  secretaries  of  the  MOF,  Ministries  of  Law,  Justice,  and \nParliamentary Affairs, Labor, and of the concerned line ministry, president of the Federation of \nNepalese  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  and  Joint  Secretary,  MOF  (Corporation \nCoordination Division). The PC may establish subcommittees as necessary to deal with specific \nissues of privatization and individual deals. The PC is supported by the Privatization Cell, which \nis  housed  at  MOF\u2019s  Corporation  Coordination  Division,  and  acts  as  the  PC\u2019s  secretariat. The \ncomplete  standstill  of  privatizations  during  the  Ninth  Plan  period  underscored  that,  despite \nsubstantial  aid  support,  which  included  a  resident  advisor  and  short-term  experts,  the \ninstitutional arrangements were ineffective to support privatization. Among the key reasons for \nlack of success were (i) frequent change of Government,  (ii) vested interests of line ministries \nto keep the investments or manage their disposal, (iii) lack of powers of the privatization cell, (iv) \nabsence of proper communication and policies to address retrenchment, and (v) lack of funding \nto  absorb  the  cash  cost  associated  with  privatization  and  liquidation.  Heavy  involvement  of \nmany  players  and  layers  in  decision  making  and  implementation  have  contributed  to  the  poor \noutcome.  \n \n15.  While knowledge of the ways of Government decision making is essential, lack of private \nsector experience in PC and cell has undermined the ability to effectively manage transactions. \nIn  recent  years  the  political  nature  of  decisions  and  the  high  political  instability  have  severely \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\nundermined effectiveness and staff morale in the PC, leaving a dysfunctional unit lacking a clear \nmandate, and sufficient and well-qualified staff. It is recognized that a new approach is needed. \n \n16. \n \n\nThe following key lessons can be learned from Nepal\u2019s privatization experience: \n\nHigh  Government  Commitment  Is  Essential.  Privatization,  even  without  a \nstrong  legal  and  institutional  foundation,  worked  well  under  a  stable  reform-\nminded,  and  highly  committed  Government.  Unstable  Governments  lacking \ncommitment,  and  a  high  degree  of  external  interference  in  individual  deals \nheavily undermined progress and led to a complete standstill since 1997.  \n\nPrivatization Objectives and Actions Need To Be Well Communicated to the \nPublic.  Privatization  objectives,  processes,  and  their  consequences  were  not \nwell communicated, especially relating to staff retrenchment. \n\nA Strong Executing Agency Is Required To Lead the Privatization Process. \nThe  volatile  political  environment  and  weak  legislation  and organizational setup \nare  inadequate  to  implement  privatization  in  a  time-bound  manner.  A  strong \nagency with special powers and a strict time limit is needed. \n\nA  Strategic  Time -Bound Approach Is Needed.  Measures to liquidate smaller \nunits should precede more complex activities to gain momentum and credibility. \nPolicies guiding privatization and retrenchment should be in place.  \n\nOverstaffing  of  PE  Needs  To  Be  Reduced  and  Liabilities  Paid.  To ensure \ncredibility  of  the  process,  the  Government  must  take  action  to  reduce \noverstaffing; prohibit refilling of posts, new investments in PEs, new lending and \nguarantees to PEs; and gradually pay the liabilities to lower the fiscal risks. \n\n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n \nImprove the Legal and Institutional Framework for Privatization \n\n1. \n\n \n17. \nImprove the Legal Framework. To lay the foundations for good corporate governance, \nenactment of the newly drafted Company Law, Insolvency Law, and Secured Transactions Law \nis  needed.  These  laws  will  provide  the  framework  for  the  constitution of boards, professional \nmanagement, accountability and disclosure, as well as the orderly entry and exit of companies. \nThe Secured Transactions Law is essential to enhance creditor rights.  \n \n18.   Build  Effective  Institutional  Arrangements  for  Implementation  and  Strategic \nApproach  to  Privatization.  To  develop  a  robust  institutional  framework  for  disengagement \nfrom PEs, the privatization process needs to be revamped. The Government needs to develop a \ntime-bound  strategy  and  action  plan.  The  strategy  must  adopt  a  two-track  approach:  (i) \nimplement  tangible  and  irreversible  short-term  measures  to  stop  the  budget  drain,  gain \nmomentum, and credibility; and (ii) develop a suitable process and institutional arrangements to \nbe  implemented  over  the  medium  term.  The  institutional  arrangements  should  be  consistent \nwith the Privatization Act. \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nEstablish a Sound Process for Privatization \n\n19. \nThe  medium-term  strategy  will  develop  a  time-bound  approach  for  the  Government\u2018s \ndisengagement from PEs. Effective communication to all stakeholders is essential. The strategy \nand action plan would entail the following elements. \n \n20. \n \n\nAnalyze the Cost and Contingent Liabilities. This includes analysis of \n\nproper  staffing  needs  of  PEs,  staff  reduction  plans,  estimate  of  contingent \nliabilities related to employment by type of benefit and enterprise, and estimate of \nretrenchment cost scenarios; establish proper quarterly PE reporting;  \n\ncontingent  liabilities  from  loans,  accounts  payable,  and  other  contractual \nobligations  of  PEs,  and  outstanding  liabilities  to  private  and  public  sector \ncreditors; \n\n \n\n \n\n21. \n\n(iii) \n\ndirect and indirect budgetary transfers by source and beneficiary; and \n\npossible training measures for laid-off staff and related costs. \n\n(iv) \n \nStrategic Planning. Based on the diagnostic results this involves three steps:  \n\ndetermine objectives, and time frame; \n\nidentify  and  prioritize  PE  interventions  differentiated  by  PEs  with  (a)  essential \npublic good content, such as utilities; (b) potential risk on financial stability such \nas banks; and (c) commercial market potential for the remaining PEs; and \n\nprepare  plans  to  (a)  improve  governance,  accountability  of  management,  and \nefficiency  of  PEs;  (b)  reduce  overstaffing  and  prepare  plans  to  accommodate \nLabor  rationalization,  and  retraining;  (c)  establish  a  hard  budget  and  borrowing \nconstraint on all PEs; (d) privatize PEs with market potential; and (e) immediately \nprepare irrevocable liquidation of PEs without market potential. \n\n \n22. \nPrepare  a  Medium-Term  Action  Plan.  To  accelerate  the  disengagement  from  PE \nownership,  the  Government  will  develop  a  strategy  and  an  action  plan  in  active  collaboration \nwith  all  stakeholders.  The  implementation  of  the  action  plan  will  begin  in  FY2004  and  will  be \nspread over a 5-year period. The strategy will explicitly prioritize enterprises for sale, liquidation, \nand  restructuring;  and  develop  an  appropriate  institutional  model  for  effective  implementation. \nThe  strategy  and  the  action  plan  will  be  approved  by  the  Cabinet  and  will  entail  the  following \nsteps: \n\ndiagnostic assessment of cost and contingent liabilities incurred by PEs. This will \ninclude  analysis  of  staffing  needs  of  PEs,  staff  reduction  plans,  training  for \nretrenched staff, planned reduction of direct and indirect budgetary transfers, and \nan accurate assessment of exposure of the banking system to PEs; \n\nstrategic  planning.  Based  on \nfor \ndisengagement  from  ownership.  The  strategy  will  include  measures  to  improve \ngovernance,  accountability  of  management,  and  efficiency  of  PEs;  reduce \noverstaffing;  establish  a  hard  budget  and  borrowing  constraint  on  all  PEs; \n\nthe  diagnostic  results,  prioritize  PEs \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\n \n(iii) \n\nprivatize  PEs  with  market  potential;  and  close  enterprises  without  market \npotential; and \n\nimplementation.  This  includes  the  development  of  the  legal  and  institutional \ninfrastructure to support privatization. The Government will begin implementation \nof the medium term plan immediately following approval by the Cabinet. \n\n3. \n\nDevelop a Retrenchment Policy and Process \n\n \n23. \nA Retrenchment Policy and Process for PEs Need to be Developed. Currently only \nprivatization  and  rightsizing  for  workers  are  covered  by  the  Labor  Act,  which  requires  consent \nfrom  the  Ministry  of  Labor  for  such  retrenchment.  The  Labor  Act,  however,  does  not  cover \nemployees, the majority of PE staff, and the modality of liquidation, for which no other rules and \npolicies  exist.  Consultation  reportedly  happens  on  an  ad  hoc  basis,  but  in  the  majority  of  the \ncases  the  liquidator  sells  the  assets  and  pays  arrears  and  benefits  to  labor  to  the  extent  that \nproceeds  from  the  sale  of  assets  are  available.  Reportedly,  the  proceeds  in  number  of  cases \nwere far from sufficient to cover wages and benefits in arrears. The internal rules of the PEs on \npossible retrenchment benefits differ significantly from enterprise to enterprise. It is essential to \ndevelop a policy determining equitable retrenchment and benefits applicable to all PEs. \n\nA  PE  Retrenchment  Policy  and  Action  Plan  will  Avoid  Inconsistent  Ad  Hoc \n24. \nBehavior. The policy should cover all types of PE disengagement and needs to be developed in \na participatory manner through the establishment of a task force representing (i) employees in \nPEs, (ii) Ministry of Labor in its capacity to deal with retrenchment and collective disputes, (iii) \nMinistry of Finance, and (iv) independent experts on privatization and labor rationalization.  \n\n25. \nFairness,  Transparency,  and  Dialogue  Must  Be  the  Principles  Underpinning  the \nPolicy.  Fairness  entails  (i)  availability  of  the  financial  and  nonfinancial  package  to  all  PE \nemployees,  (ii)  impartial  selection  of  the  staff  affected  by  retrenchment,  and  (iii)  adequate \ngrievance  procedures.  Transparency  entails  a  clear  process  of  sharing  information  with  all \naffected  parties.  The  information  must  be  accurate,  shared  regularly,  and  in  a  form  that staff, \nincluding the illiterate, understand. Dialogue entails communication with worker representatives \nto  reach  understanding  of  and  agreement  on  the  options  and  measures  to  implement \nretrenchment. A policy and action plan should cover the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nExamination  of  Alternatives.  In  the  case  of  liquidation  this  entails  alternative \nemployment, with and without retraining. In the case of downsizing, more options \nsuch  as  reduced  pay,  job  sharing  can  be  considered.  Retrenchment  requires  a \nserious assessment of alternatives and consideration of staffs\u2019 views. \n\nPublic  Announcement. A committee, which may include stakeholders such as \nrepresentatives of employees, management, the line ministry, and the Ministry of \nLabor, will be established to clarify the reasons for retrenchment, categories and \nnumbers  of  staff  affected,  timing,  financial  and  other  assistance  offered,  and \nvoluntary or compulsory nature of retrenchment. \n\nAssessment of Staff Capabilities.  For compulsory downsizing, the staff to be \nretrenched need to  be  identified.  Fairness  dictates  that  an  independent  expert \nconduct a human resource audit to determine the qualifications, experience and \nskills  needed  to  meet  the  job  requirements  after  the  downsizing.  The  human \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nresource  audit  will  provide  an  impartial  independent  assessment,  leading  to  a \nmatching process that relates staff profiles to job descriptions. \n\n(iv) \n\nNonfinancial  Assistance.  In  addition  to  the  financial  severance  package, \nassistance may take the following forms: (i) training, business advisory services, \nand  identification  of  new  jobs;  (ii)  counseling  for  staff  that  are  difficult  to  re-\nemploy  and  in  need  of  social  and  welfare  services,  and  (iii)  registration  with \nemployment services or the establishment of an own employment service unit. \n\n(v) \n\nGrievance  Procedure.  Grievance  mechanisms  need  to  be  put  in  place  to  deal \nwith  complaints  arising  from  the  retrenchment.  The  procedure  should  be  clear \nand simple, and use independent conciliators and arbitrators.  \n\n(vi)  Monitoring.  The  task  force  may  consider  establishing  an  independent  and \nrespected  \u201cmonitoring  function\u201d  to  oversee  retrenchment.  This  could  be  part  of \nthe tasks of the privatization unit.  \n\n \n4. \n\nOther Measures Supported under the  Public Sector Management Program \n(PSMP) \n\n \nImmediate  Measures  at  the  PE  Level  Need  to  be  Supported  by  the  PSMP. \n26. \nConsistent  with  the  envisaged  framework,  closed  PEs  will  immediately  undergo  liquidation  or \nirrevocable closure according to the provisions of the Privatization Act, Company Law,5 and the \nCorporations Act. The Government will complete the payout of liabilities to staff, consistent with \nthe retrenchment policy and rules governing the PEs. The Government, with the assistance of \nTA-funded  consultants,  will  (i)  examine  the  poverty,  social,  and  gender  dimensions  of  labor \nrationalization; and (ii) consistent with the new PE retrenchment policy being developed under \nthe  PSMP,  will  adopt  measures  to  mitigate  the  impacts  to  the  extent  feasible.  Adequate \narrangements will be made to ensure that other liabilities of PEs to creditors are settled. \n \n27. \nEnhance Timeliness of Reports and Quality of Audits.  To  enhance  the  quality  and \ntimeliness of financial information on PEs, the Office of Auditor General will strengthen control \nso that full audits are delivered within 9 months after the end of the fiscal year. \n \n\n                                                                 \n5  There are three modalities for liquidation of a company in Nepal: (i) voluntary decision of the board, (ii) request by \ncreditors  if  one  third  of  the  debt  is  overdue,  and  (iii)  through  the  Company  Registrar  Office  at  the  Ministry  of \nIndustry,  Commerce,  and  Supply.  The  latter  process  can  be  initiated  under  certain  conditions,  such  as  when  the \ncompany has not provided adequate annual reports. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n39 \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SUPPORTING GOVERNMENT  \nDISENGAGEMENT FROM PUBLIC ENTERPRISES \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n \n1. \n\nStrategy \n\n \n1. \nThe Government recognizes that privatization efforts and capacity were inadequate over \nthe  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  period,  where  only  one  privatization  transaction  was  successfully \ncompleted. The recent fiscal crisis has highlighted the urgent need to stem the serious adverse \nimpact  of  large  and  increasing  budget  transfers  and  contingent  liabilities,  due  largely  to  poor \ngovernance  and  inefficient  management  of  public  enterprises  (PEs).  The  Government  is  now \ntaking a more aggressive approach to PE reform. Key features include quickly liquidating closed \nand  insolvent  PEs  and  establishing  a  process  of  quick  disposal  of  PEs,  either  as  a  going \nconcern  or  in  the  form  of  liquidation.  To  gain  momentum  in  its  disengagement  from  PEs,  the \nGovernment  has  selected  seven  PEs  for  liquidation,  and  issued  liquidation  orders  and  notices \nfor four of these entities. The Government will disengage from a total of nine PEs by the end of \nthe program. \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n \n\n2. \nThe  legislative  environment  for  state-owned  enterprise  reform  is  currently  governed  by \nthe Privatization Act (1994). The Act provides for a Privatization Committee (PC) with executive \npowers  to  propose  candidates  for  privatization.  Once  these  proposals  are  sanctioned  by \nCabinet, the PC is responsible for implementation leading to the conclusion of negotiations with \na prospective bidder. The matter is then submitted to the Cabinet for final approval. The PC is \nempowered  to  establish  subcommittees.  According  to  the  Act,  the  PC  will  define  the  terms  of \nreference for the subcommittees. In the past individual subcommittees were tasked with taking \nforward  technical  work  for  each  privatization  candidate.  As  defined  in  the  Act,  the  PC  is \ncomposed of 11 members: minister of state for finance, chairman; chairman, finance committee \n(House of Representatives); two members of Parliament designated by Government; member, \nNational  Planning  Commission;  secretary,  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF);  secretary,  Ministry  of \nLaw,  Justice  and  Parliamentary  Affairs;  secretary,  Ministry  of  Labor;  secretary  of  the  line \nministry of the PE to be privatized; president, Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce \nand  Industry;  and  Joint  Secretary,  MOF  (Corporation  Coordination  Division)  as  member-\nsecretary. \n \n3. \nDelay in Reforms due to the Separation of Functions of the Cabinet, PC, MOF, and \nLine  Ministry.  First,  the  need  for  prior  consent  of  the  respective  line  ministry  in  proposing \nprivatization  candidates  has  hampered  decision  making  by  the  PC.  Second,  once  Cabinet \napproval has been obtained, opportunities for line ministry interference throughout the work of \nthe sub-committees have resulted in a protracted privatization process. Third, ownership in the \nPC  of  the  work  undertaken  by  the  subcommittees  is  insufficient.  There  is  currently  no \nmechanism to tackle vested interests. \n\n4. \nCorporation  Coordination  Division  (CCD)  Responsible  for  PEs  Within  MOF. The \nCCD\u2019s tasks include annual budget negotiations and are not limited to privatization or liquidation \nfunctions.  The  CCD  acts  as  secretariat  to  the  PC  and  the  Joint  Secretary  is  the  member \nsecretary  to  the  PC.  In  practice,  officials  in  the  CCD  form  the  majority  of  the  subcommittees. \nTheir  role  as  the  Privatization  Cell  under  the  previous  aid-funded  project  was  severely \nundermined by their inability to overcome political opposition to reform, despite the presence of \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n40 \n \n\na  long-term  resident  adviser.  It  will  be  imperative  for  the  program  that  the  CCD  members  are \nempowered and integrated both technically and institutionally to support the function of the PC. \n\n5. \nReduction  of  Bureaucratic  Layers  Involved  in  Privatization.  A  new  approach  is \nneeded  to  ensure  effective  disengagement  of  the  Government  from  PEs  and  to  build  the \ninstitutional foundation for the privatization and liquidation process. The objective is to empower \nthe technical unit responsible for taking forward privatization with sufficient capacity, while at the \nsame time reducing the opportunities for political interference to their work and providing a more \neffective mechanism to overcome such obstacles should they arise. \n\n6. \nPermanent  Privatization  Coordination  Subcommittee  (PCSC)  under  the  PC.  To \nwork  as  much  as  possible  within  the  existing  legal  and  institutional  boundaries,  it  is  proposed \nthat the Government support utilization of the powers of the PC under the existing Privatization \nAct more effectively. The PC will establish a PCSC, which will be responsible for taking forward \nthe process of disengagement. The PCSC will take charge  of preparing and implementing the \ndecisions of the Cabinet and the PC, including the existing functions of the secretariat of the PC. \nIt  will  be  responsible,  along  with  technical  subcommittees,  for  contracting  the  technical \nassistance  (TA)  required  for  each  privatization  episode  and  managing  tasks  such  as  the \ndevelopment of a labor policy and communications strategy. \n\nThe PCSC will be headed by a person selected by the PC and, who may be a member \n7. \nof the PC. The joint secretary of the CCD will be appointed as the senior official in the PCSC on \na  full-time  basis.  The  PCSC  will  absorb  qualified  staff  of  the  CCD  and  train  them  to  manage \nliquidation and privatization transactions. The PCSC will be supported by recruited transaction \nmanagers. Liquidators appointed by the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Commerce,  and  Supplies  will be \naccountable to the PCSC. \n\n8. \nTransfer  of  Line  Ministry  Function  to  MOF.  The  Government  has  committed  to \nimplement  an  important  change.  Once  Cabinet  approves  a  candidate  for  privatization  or \nliquidation, it will also approve the transfer of management responsibility from the respective line \nministry  to  MOF.  This  is  critical  in  reducing  the  ability  of  line  ministries  to  continually  interfere \nwith the liquidation and privatization work of the PCSC. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\nB. \n \n9. \nThe  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  (i)  developing  and  implementing  an  effective \nprivatization/liquidation  process,  (ii)  building  capacity  and  managing  and  supervising  the \ntransactions,  (iii)  implementing  an  effective  and  fair  policy  for  Labor  rationalization  in  the \naffected PEs, and (iv) communicating effectively with all stakeholders. \n \nThe  PCSC  and  the  technical  subcommittees  will  (i)  submit  privatization/liquidation \n10. \nproposals  to  the  PC  for  decision  and  endorsement  by  Cabinet;  (ii)  contract  out  the  initial \nvaluation  studies, \n(iii)  establish \nprivatization/liquidation  transaction  teams  within  the  subcommittee  in  order  to  contract \nnecessary specialist inputs for each privatization episode; this may include enterprise, industrial \nrelations,  and  legal  expertise;  (iv)  manage  the  payment  of  dues  to  staff  and creditors; and (v) \nconclude the privatization/liquidation process by managing the sale of assets, or, if unsuccessful \nor legally difficult to achieve within a reasonable period, transfer of assets to the Government. \n \n11. \nSupported by the TA, the PCSC will also manage the development of a comprehensive \nlabor policy to implement a fair Labor rationalization exercise, and be responsible for designing \n\nfor  privatization/liquidation; \n\nthe  approach \n\nincluding \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n41 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nand implementing a communications strategy to support Government leaders in explaining the \nPE reform policy to stakeholders.  \n \n12. \nSupporting PE Reforms. The Government committed itself to (i) establish a task force \nto  prepare  a  labor  rationalization  policy,  (ii)  implement  the  labor  rationalization  policy for any \noperating  PEs  to  be  closed,  (iii)  settle  all  dues  to  workers  and  other  creditors  in  negotiated \nagreements for the entities under liquidation or entities where staff downsizing is involved, and \n(iv)  adopt  a  Cabinet-approved  comprehensive  strategy  and  time-bound  action  plan  for \nstreamlining disengagement from PEs.  \n \n13. \n \n\nThree types of advisory services are required:  \n\nTransaction  management  advisers  (TMA)  (Asian  Development  Bank  [ADB]-\nfinanced)  will  actively  support  PCSC \nthrough \nmethodological and on-the-job-training (OJT) and in critical issues of contracting \nthe  consultants  in  charge  of  administering  the  liquidation/privatization  and \nsupervising the transaction administrators/ liquidators. \n\nits  capacity \n\nin  building \n\nSenior  policy  advisers  to  the  Government  and  the  PC,  in  coordination  with  the \nPCSC  (ADB-financed)  will  advise  on  the  design  and  implementation  of  (a)  a \nprivatization/liquidation  strategy,  (b)  a  consistent  labor  rationalization  policy \napplicable  to  all  PEs,  (c)  a  communications  strategy,  and  (d)  modalities  for \nsettlement of dues to creditors. \n\nTransaction  administrators/liquidators  (TAL)  (proposed  to  be  financed  by  the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  [DFID])  will  be  responsible  for \ndelivering  the  technical  inputs  necessary  for  each  privatization/liquidation \nepisode.  They  will  be  recruited  externally  on  performance-based contracts with \npredetermined  time  limits  for  completing  each  transaction  including  the  full \nsettlement  of  dues  to  staff  and  creditors.  The  consultants  will  be  closely \nsupervised by the transaction management advisors and will be directly recruited \nby PCSC.  \n\nthe \n\nthat \n\ntake \n\nforward \n\nthe  Government  will \n\n \n14. \nThe  principle  underpinning  this  approach  is  to  provide  the  necessary  TA  in  a  way  that \nresponds  to  the  pace  of  Government  reform,  which  should  avoid  a  repeat  of  past  experience \nwhere  advisory  inputs  were  rendered  ineffective  by  the  absence  of  political  decisions.  The  TA \nfull  program  of \noutlined  here  assumes \ndisengagement. \n \n15. \nThe  TA  will  require  42  person-months  of  consulting  services:  6  international  and  36 \ndomestic.  The  TA  will  also  require  6  person-months  of  domestic  expertise  to  support  the \nprogram  implementation  unit  in  exercising  its  performance  management  functions.  An \nexperienced project/program manager will be recruited on an intermittent basis. \n \nSenior Policy Advisers. Six person-months of international expertise is required in the \n16. \nareas  of  public  enterprise  privatization,  industrial  labor  relations,  and  dispute  settlement \nmanagement  (labor  specialist)  and  legal  matters.  The  individual  expert  assignments  will  be \ndetermined  as  required  but  will  not  exceed  3  person-months  for  each  area  of expertise. The \nexperts  will  have  at  least  a  10  years  experience  in  their  relevant  field  in  emerging  markets,  a \ngood  knowledge  of  the  situation  in  South  Asia,  and  a  proven  track  record  of  assisting \ngovernments in designing and carrying through similar tasks. The experts will assist task forces \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n42 \n \n\nestablished by the Government to prepare the relevant policies, strategies, and action plans and \nlead  in  preparing  the  drafts  for  Cabinet  approval.  The  experts  will  also  advise  the  PCSC  in \nleading  piloting  efforts  to  field  test  and  illustrate  the  practical  implementation  of  measures \nadopted under the respective strategies and action plans. \n \n17. \nTMA.  Domestic  specialists  inputs  of  36-person  months  will  be  required  to  support  the \nPCSC.  The  TMA  will  have  expertise  in  international  good  practice  of  procurement,  contract \nmanagement, accounting, finance and audit, and law. \n \n18. \nThe ADB TA is expected to finance the inputs described in parts (i) and (ii) of para. 13. \nThese  include  the  permanent  positions  in  the  TSC  including  the  transaction  managers  and \nnecessary  inputs  to  the  development  of  (i)  a  privatization/liquidation  strategy,  (ii)  a  consistent \nlabor  policy,  (iii)  the  modalities  for  settlement  of  dues  to  creditors, and (iv) a communications \nstrategy.  The  selection,  engagement,  and  services  of  ADB-financed  consultants  will  be  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  or  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for domestic consultants. \n \n19. \nTAL  Support.  DFID  proposed  to  finance  the  technical  inputs  required  for  each \nprivatization/liquidation  episode,  as  described  in  part  (iii)  of  para.  13.  The  PC  (through  the \nPCSC) will manage DFID TA funds. On behalf of the PC, the PCSC will recruit inputs for each \nprivatization/liquidation episode. The PC will endorse a proposal for selecting consultants for a \ntransaction  describing  (i)  the  outputs,  (ii)  the  type  and  quantity  of  inputs,  and  (iii)  the \nprocurement process for submis sion to DFID for their no objection. DFID funds will be released \nupon  completion  of  the  privatization/liquidation  according  to  the  provisions  of  performance-\nbased contracts described in para.13 (iii). \n \nC. \n \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.925 million equivalent, of which ADB will fund \n20. \n$425,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program, to cover 26.2% of the \nforeign exchange cost and 19.7% of the local currency cost. The Government and DFID are in \nthe  process  of  finalizing  an  agreement  on  the  conditions  for  DFID  provision  of  parallel  TA  for \nTAL and the modalities for a DFID parallel financing of the TA. 1 DFID will provide  $1.2 million, \nwhich is equivalent to 62.3 % of the total TA cost.

This  is  particularly  true  in  Nepal  where \ninstitutions  are  weak,  incentive  structures  are  distorted,  and  people\u2019s  participation  in  policy \nmaking  is  weak.  Therefore,  governance  reform  has  remained  a  key  element  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  economic  and  structural  reform  program,  which  seeks  to  sustain  accelerated \ngrowth  and  economic  stability.  Governance  reform  involves  a  host  of  issues  including \nempowering  people,  devolving  power  to  grassroot  organizations,  enhancing  transparency  in \ngovernment activities, calling public officials to task for their actions, and ensuring predictability \nin  government  and  consistency  in  application  of  rules.  Accordingly,  the  Government  has \nprioritized reforms in the areas of civil service, decentralization, and combating corruption.  \n \n2. \nThe  FY2003  Budget  spells  out  the  Government\u2019s  policy  on  governance.  The  Civil \nService  Reform  Program  will  be  continued  to  make  the  civil  service  responsible,  accountable, \nand  efficient;  and  to  eliminate  unnecessary  vacant  positions.  In  the  area  of  decentralization, \nsources  of  revenue  that  can  be  devolved  to  local  bodies  will  be  identified,  block  grants  to  the \nlocal  bodies  will  be  linked  to  poverty  level,  and  local  bodies  will  need  to  make  mandatory \nquarterly  public  reports.  As  part  of  its  initiatives  to  control  corruption,  the  Government  will \nprepare  a  comprehensive  anticorruption  strategy  and  will  start  implementing  it  in  FY2004.  In \naddition,  additional  manpower  and  resources  will  be  made  available  to  constitutional  entities \nengaged in corruption control.  \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe civil service in Nepal was originally established for land administration, collection of \nland  revenue,  maintenance  of  law  and  order,  and  dispensation  of  justice.  The  present  civil \nservice  is  governed  by  the  1998  Civil  Service  Act  and  Civil  Service  Rules.  The  Nepalese  civil \nservice  consists  of  10  services:  administrative;  agriculture;  economic  planning  and  statistical; \neducation; engineering; forest; health; judicial; miscellaneous; and parliamentary.1 The total size \nof  Nepal\u2019s  civil  service  is  estimated  at  103,000  approved  posts,  of  which  about  86,000  are \ncurrently  occupied.  Approximately  90%  of  civil  servants  are  in  the  nongazetted  (support  staff) \nclass,  and  of  this  group,  almost  35%  are  cleaning  staff  and  messengers.  There  are \napproximately  0.57  civil  servant  per  100  population,  which  is  low  by  developing  country \nstandards, considering that only 10% of the civil servants are at officer level.   \n \nWomen are underrepresented in the civil service. They account for only about 8.6% of \n4. \ntotal positions, of which only 5.1% are at officer level. During 1997\u20132000, only one woman was \npromoted  to  class  one.  The  trend  is  similar  at  all  levels,  indicating  that  cultural  stereotypes \nprevent the development of an environment that is conducive to the promotion of women or to \nwomen\u2019s interests.  \n \n5. \nNepal has a lengthy history of weak implementation of civil service reforms. There were \nfive  administrative  commissions  from  1952  to  1992.  The  principal  recommendations  made  by \neach  commission  were  valid  and  important  in  their  time.  However,  in  the  absence  of  an \nappropriate  institutional  mechanism,  they  could  only  be  partially  implemented.  The  1992 \nCommission  made  116  principal  recommendations  aimed  at  making  the  public  service  more \nefficient,  results-oriented,  accountable,  motivated,  and  capable.  Key  proposals  included  the \n\n                                                                 \n1  The health service is governed by the Nepal Health Service Act (1996) while the other nine services are governed \n\nby the latest Civil Service Act promulgated in 1998. \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nto \n\nimplementation of a 15-year development plan and 5-year rolling plan, reduction in the number \nof ministries from 21 to 18, rightsizing of the bureaucracy, placement of certain functions under \nautonomous  authority,  and  devolution  of  power \nlocal  bodies.  The  majority  of \nrecommendations  of  the  1992  Commission  could  not  be  implemented  because  of  the  short \ntenures of seven coalition governments from 1994 to 1999, before a majority government was \nelected.  The  previous  attempts  at  reform  of  the  civil  service  were  unsuccessful  mainly  due  to \nfour  factors:  (i)  absence  of  serious  political  commitment;  (ii)  resistance  from  the  civil  servants; \n(iii) lack of serious dialogue on reform opportunities with stakeholders outside the civil service; \nand  (iv)  lack  of  experience  and  appropriate  skills  to  diagnose  the  real  central  issues,  and \ndevelop a process for managing and implementing the needed changes. \n \n6. \nDrawing  lessons  from  past  failed  attempts,  since  1999  the  Government  has  embarked \non  a  major  Civil  Service  Reform  Program  with  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB). This included preparation of an action plan on civil service reforms to lay the foundation \nfor broader reform efforts.2 ADB also assisted the Government to introduce the first steps in its \nlong-term  reform  program  and  in  strengthening  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  implement \nreforms.3 As part of that assistance, a number of thematic reform proposals were presented to \nthe  Government:  computerized  personal  information  system,  merit-based  employment policy, \nstaff  redundancy  and  early  retirement  scheme,  long-term  pay  policy  provision,  establishment \nand  wage  bill,  gender  mainstreaming  policy,  and  performance  management  policy  and  plan. \nThe Governance Reform Program4 (GRP), which became effective in December 2001, aims at \nestablishing  a  civil  service  that  is  results-  and  people-oriented  and  gender  responsive  and \ncontributes to higher economic growth and poverty reduction. It attempts to overcome some of \nthe  major  constraints  to  operation  of  an  efficient,  service-oriented  civil  service,  i.e.  corruption, \nlow staff productivity and morale, performance and service issues, by revising and implementing \nreforms  proposed/developed  with  ADB  assistance  (footnote  3).  The  Swiss  Agency  for \nDevelopment  and  Cooperation  has  extended  support  to  the  GRP  and  has  provided  financial \nassistance  in  two  specific  areas  of  reform,  i.e.  civil  society  support  for  reform  measures,  and \nprogram  monitoring  and  reporting.  Engaging  the  civil  society  and  relevant  stakeholders  in \ndesigning, refining, and implementing the reform will enhance transparency and accountability. \nThis  mechanism  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  incorporate  a  supply-side  and  people\u2019s \nperspective  to  reform,  which  will  ensure  sustained  support  to  the  program.  In  addition,  an \nindependent monitoring, reporting, and evaluation system will ensure that all stakeholders have \ndetailed information on the program goals, plans, implementation successes, and failures. \n \n7. \nIn addition to initiatives under the GRP, the Government has adapted a number of civil \nservice reforms. These initiatives cover prevention of premature transfers, streamlining the civil \nservice,  improving  pension  records,  streamlining  the  creation  of  new  positions,  payroll  control, \nimplementation  of  a  voluntary  early  retirement  scheme,  preparation  of  manual  for  training,  job \ndescriptions  for  different  positions,  gender  measures,  and  pay  hike  and  rewards  for  civil \nservants. The Government is increasingly using information technology to bring about efficiency \nin its operations. Many ministries and departments have their own web sites and rely on e-mail \n                                                                 \n2   ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Formulating an Action Plan on Civil Service Reforms. Manila. This \nincluded  the  following  initiatives:  (i)  conducting  a  civil  service  census;  (ii)  establishing  a  computerized  personnel \ndatabase; (iii) undertaking a functional review of ministries, departments, and offices; and (iv) considering a range \nof alternatives for fiscal decentralization. \n\n3  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Institutional Support for Governance Reforms. Manila.  \n4  The GRP consists of five components to be implemented over four years ending December 2005: (i) develop an \ninternal  capacity  for  leading  reform,  (ii)  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  civil  service,  (iii)  improve  governance  and \nreduce  corruption  in  government,  (iv)  enhance  competence  and  motivation  of  civil  servants,  and  (v)  establish \nprocesses for improving performance in key ministries.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n47 \n\nfor receiving and sending information. For example, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and National \nPlanning Commission have been disseminating information through their web sites.  \n \nB. \n\nDecentralization \n\n \n\n8. \nA  series  of  legislation  on  decentralization  were  approved  between  1965  and  1982,  but \nthey  were  confined  to  deconcentrating  the  administrative  system  to  district  level,  under  an \nelected,  but  nonparty  model  of  governance.  Decentralized  governance  is  one  of  the  guiding \nprinciples  embodied  in  the  Constitution  of  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  in  1990.  The  main  goal  is  to \nstrengthen  multiparty  democracy  and  poverty  reduction.  Successive  governments  after  1990 \nhave  given  impetus  to  decentralization  with  the  result  that  the  Local  Self-Governance  Act \n(LSGA) of 1999 and Local Self-Governance Regulations have come into force.  \n \n9. \nThe  Ninth  Plan  and  the  LSGA  offered  a  policy  and  regulatory  framework  on \ndecentralization and local governance. Although this framework sets a process of devolution, it \nhas  not  been  adequately  supported  by  financial  and  human  resources  necessary  for  enabling \nthe  local  bodies  to  undertake  their  prescribed  functions.  The  Public  Expenditure  Review \nCommission  in  November  2000  recommended  streamlining  of  the  poverty  focus  and \ndecentralization in the budgetary system and its implementation. In March 2001, a Government \nreview  entitled  Decentralization  in  Nepal:  Prospects  and  Challenges  recommended  a  time-\nbound  implementation  plan  for  decentralization.  The  Local  Bodies  Financial  Commission  has \nprovided a number of recommendations for policy consideration. It recommended classification \nof local bodies for the application of a new formula of grants, sharing of tax revenue, and review \nof  the  number  and  structure  of  local  bodies.  It  further  recommended  creation  of  a  special \ntown  development  committee,  and \nregulation \nimplementation of all the provisions of LSGA and matching classification of local bodies along \nwith the assignment of appropriate functions. The Budget Speech of FY2002 had provisions for \ndevolution of agriculture, primary health, primary education, and postal service to the local level; \nand for the establishment of a district technical office in all districts.  \n \n10. \nThe  Decentralization  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Committee  meeting  held  on  8 \nJanuary  2002  approved  the  Decentralization  Implementation  Plan  (DIP).  The  following  key \ndecisions were taken by the decentralization committee:  \n \n\nthe  capital  city,  dissolution  of \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nThe  schedule  of  work  to  be  handed  over  by  ministries  to  the  local  bodies  in \naccordance  with  the  LSGA  will  be  prepared  in  FY2002  for  implementation  in \nFY2003. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nEducation, health, agriculture extension (including livestock services), postal and \ninfrastructure  development  works  will  be  handed  over  to  the  local  bodies  in \nFY2003  in  accordance  with  the  policies  adopted  by  the  Government.  Other \nministries  will  prepare  a  schedule  of  works  to  be  handed  over  to  local  bodies \nbeginning in FY2004. The concerned ministries will provide local bodies with the \nnecessary budget, responsibilities, and technical manpower to execute the works \nto be handed over to local bodies. \n\n(iii) \n\nProvision  will  be  made  to  review  the  progress  and  monitoring  system  for  the \nworks being carried out by local bodies, to develop a system for local bodies to \napprove the annual program at the local level. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nLaws  that  contradict  with  the  LSGA  will  be  amended  so  as  to  make  the  local \nbodies more efficient and effective. \n\nImplementation of the report of the Local Bodies Financial Commission will be in \nphases. \n\n \n11. \nThe DIP lists a number of tasks to be completed over the next 5 years and is presently \nregarded  as  the  main  document  for  program  implementation.  The  decentralization  reform \nprocess  in  Nepal  gained  momentum  after  the  approval  of  DIP  in  January  2002.  The  DIP \nenvisages bringing into operation all the provisions of LSGA within the next 5 years. Since the \nDIP  is  a  product  of  collaborative  initiative  by  Government,  aid  agencies,  professionals,  and \nrepresentatives of local bodies\u2019 associations, the success of the entire decentralization program \nrests on the continued efforts of all stakeholders to effectively operationalize the actions listed in \nthe  document.  Several  critical  constraints  need  to  be  overcome  to  achieve  the  goals  of \ndecentralization and these are related to policy issues, institutionalization of long-term planning \nat  the  local  level,  personnel  management  at  the  local  level,  fiscal  decentralization,  technical \nbackstopping to local bodies, capacity building for local bodies, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n12. \nIn  the  Tenth  Plan  (FY2003\u2013FY2007) approved by the Government in December 2002, \n\u201cimplementing  the  principle  and  policies  determined  through  Local  Self-Governance  Act\u201d  is \nstated as the long-term concept of decentralization. The main strategies, policies, and functions \nrelated to decentralization comprise, and restructuring the number of local bodies as well as of \nthe elected representatives. In addition, the DIP will be made operational in a coordinated way \nwith  all  the  concerned  agencies  during  the  plan  period.  Policy,  institutional,  and  legal  reforms \nwill  be  implemented  as  well.  The  FY2003  Budget  has  recognized  that  the  decentralization \nprogram has lagged in enhancing the implementation capability of the local bodies, and giving \nthem  ownership  of  program  implementation.  There  are  provisions  to  tie  up  the  block  grants  to \nbe  provided  to  the  local  bodies  with  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  the  districts  and  to  develop \nmechanisms for providing more grants to the poorer local bodies. The budget has provisions for \nimplementing  various  targeted  programs  so  as  to  uplift  the  living  condition  of  poor, \ndisadvantaged, ethnic, and women\u2019s and children\u2019s groups. It also provides for the development \nof  an  effective  monitoring  system  for  assessing  the  outreach  of  allocated  fund  to  the  targeted \ngroups and to develop a community-auditing system for such programs.  \n  \n13. \nOn 15 July 2002, the Government decided that the responsibilities of local bodies would \nbe  handed  over  to  the  civil  service  bureaucracy  when  the  5-year  terms  of  the  local  bodies \nexpired  on  16  July  2002.  Many  regarded  this  decision  as  against  the  overall  spirit  of \nempowering  local  governments  and  counter  to  the  spirit  of  democracy  and  decentralization. It \nundermines  the  work  and  support  provided  by  numerous  aid  agencies  to  strengthen  local \ngovernance,  including  implementation  of  the  DIP.  On  15  August  2002,  the  Government \nestablished  various  committees  (comprising  civil  servants)  at  different  levels  of  local \ngovernment to undertake the functions performed by elected bodies. \n \n14. \nService delivery to the local people and development work have been adversely affected \nin  part  because  the  elected  local  bodies  were  replaced  with  civil  service  committees. Civil \nservants  working  in  local  bodies  have  complained  that  they  lack  the  legal  provision  and \nexperience  in  running  the  local  government.  Nongazetted  staff,  for  example,  have  been \nassigned  to  make  recommendations  for  citizenship  certificates  and  relationship certificates. In \naddition,  civil  servants  are  over-burdened  for  they  have  to  undertake  jobs  that  were  earlier \nhandled by a large number of local representatives. The absence of about 1,000 secretaries in \nmany  village  development  committees  has  aggravated  the  situation  and  negatively  affected \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n49 \n\nTransparency and Accountability of the Civil Service  \n\nservice  delivery.  The  committee  members  who  are  government  employees  have  been  more \naccountable to the Government officials other than the local people. An ordinance, promulgated \nin December 2002, will enable the Government to make temporary appointments to the vacant \nvillage  development  committee\u2019s  secretary  positions  after  securing  approval  of  the  Public \nService  Commission.  To  some  extent,  this  new  arrangement  is  expected  to  enable  the \nGovernment to fill the large vacant positions and improve service delivery.  \n \nC. \n \n15. \nGovernance  reform  is  unrealistic  in  the  presence  of  rampant  corruption.  In  the  case  of \nNepal,  it  has  often  been  said  that  corruption  is  a  systemic  problem  that  undermines  the \nperformance  of  the  bureaucracy  and  the  Government  as  a  whole.  It  is  alleged  that  there  is \nuncontrolled  growth  of  corruption  in  high  places  and  low,  and  in  politics,  bureaucracy,  public \nenterprises (PEs), business, etc. The five administrative reform commission reports from 1951 \nto  1992  have  consistently  identified  the  prevalence  of  corruption  and  suggested  actions  to \novercome  this  weakness.  Although  legislation,  institutional  arrangements,  and  mechanisms \nexist  for  corruption  control,  they  have  remained  ineffective.  In  the  past,  commissions  and \nstudies (e.g., Mahadev Yadav Commission, Acharya Task Force, and the study on  Causes and \nConsequences  of  Corruption  in  Nepal by Baivab Consultancy Service and Environment Study \nCenter)  have  recommended  amendments  to  existing  legislation  and  introduction  of  new \nlegislation as major steps to reduce corruption.  \n\n \n16. \nThe  21st  session  of  the  House  of  Representatives  unanimously  approved  four \nanticorruption bills: Anti-Corruption Bill (amendment), Commission for Investigation of Abuse of \nAuthority (CIAA) Bill (second amendment), Impeachment Bill, and Special Court Bill on 17 April \n2002. Deliberation on amendments to the CIAA Act and Anti-Corruption Act was initiated in the \n16th  session  of  the  Parliament,  and  amendment  to  the  CIAA  Act  was  tabled  in  Parliament  in \n1998.  It  took  4  years  for  the  amendments  to  be  legislated.  New  provisions  have  been \nincorporated  in  the  anticorruption  legislation,  which  should  have  an  overall  positive  impact  on \nthe anticorruption efforts of the Government. Several important features of the new bills are: a \nclear definition of corruption, which makes it difficult for the accused to get away; activities that \nconstitute corruption clearly spelled out; wide range of penalty provisions for the bribe taker and \nthe giver as well; provision of additional penalties for senior public persons; role, responsibilities, \nand  accountability  of  Investigation  Officer  defined;  cases  against  retired  personnel  can  be \nregistered at any time, if required; considerably widened scope and authority of CIAA; provision \nfor hiring of private lawyers by CIAA; procedures and authority of Special Court to be used while \nregistering  corruption  cases;  and  provision  for  impeachment  of  persons  appointed  by  His \nMajesty the King under the recommendation of the Constitutional Council and sitting judges. On \n17  August  2002,  the  CIAA  executed  a  major  raid  against  22  Government  officials  from  the \nMinistry of Finance less than 24 hours after the new CIAA Act received  the Royal assent. The \nCIAA  also  initiated  investigation  and  filed  charge  sheets  against  former  ministers,  senior \nbureaucrats, civil servants, and other public officials in the special court. \n\n \n17. \nThe  Government  constituted  a  Judicial  Property  Probe  Commission  in  April  2002  to \nprobe  the  property  of  all  post-1990  (after  advent  of  multiparty  democracy)  high-ranking \ngovernment officials, political appointees, ministers, municipal mayors and deputy mayors, and \nchiefs of the district development committees and their families. The overall objective of setting \nup  the  Commission  was  to  discourage  accumulation  of  wealth  through  unfair  means  by \nindividuals  who  have  access  to  power  and  privilege.  It  was  a  move  to  identify  and  check \ncorruption.  Approximately  40,000  forms  have  been  circulated  to  retired  and  working  public \nofficials  and  they  have  been  asked  to  submit  detailed  statements  supported  by  documentary \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nevidence. The Commission submitted its report to His Majesty the King on 18 March 2003 and \ncompleted  its  work.  The  Commission  was  dissolved  after  the  submission  of  the  report.  His \nMajesty  the  King  handed  over  the  Commission\u2019s  report  to  the  Prime  Minister  for  necessary \naction. On 1 May 2003, the Government handed over the Commission\u2019s report to the CIAA. The \nCIAA on 14 May 2003 summoned around 40 high-ranking political leaders and civil servants for \nfurther interrogation.  \n\n \n18. \nThe  amended  Anti-Corruption  Act  of  2002  includes  a  provision,  which  requires  all \nnational  servants  (including  civil  servants)  to  submit  a  statement\u2014supported by documentary \nevidence\u2014of  their  wealth/property  held  in  their  name  or  in  anyone  else\u2019s  name.  The \nGovernment  recently  established  a  National  Vigilance  Center  in  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  to \neffectively  monitor  anti-corruption  initiatives  and  to  build  public  awareness  against  corruption. \nAmong the responsibilities of the Center, a major one is monitoring the income and wealth of all \npublic officials.  \n \n19. \nThe  Government  has  initiated  actions  to  strengthen  the  CIAA  by  providing  additional \nstaff,  information  and  communication  technology,  and  training  opportunities.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment  has  introduced  a  system  of  independent  physical  auditing  of  civil  works, \namendment  of  financial  administration  rules,  and  formation  of  a  judicial  committee  to  probe \npublic officials\u2019 ownership of property. Reforms in the judicial system for an enhanced rule of law \nhave  been  planned  as  well.  Under  the  GRP,  the  Government  is  expected  to  table  new \nlegislation on financial audit of political parties and anti-money laundering.  \n \n20. \nDespite  the  range  of  reforms  undertaken  by  the  Government,  corruption  remains  a \ncritical  challenge  to  good  governance  in  the  country  because  preventive  measures  are \ninadequate  and  actions  initiated  against  the  corrupt  have  been  ineffective  and  inadequate. \nAlthough  political  leaders\u2019  pronouncements  frequently  include  promises  to  combat  corruption, \nthere is no evidence of a well-integrated and concentrated effort. The problem is intensified by \nlack of properly worked-out measures/actions, noninvolvement of civil society in the fight against \ncorruption, and general lack of transparency and accountability. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nDesign Summary \n\nGoal \n \nReduction in poverty by assisting the \nGovernment to implement its poverty \nreduction strategy (PRS) \n\nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Indicators and Targets \n\nMonitoring Mechanisms \n\n \n \nPoverty incidence reduced from 38% to 32% (2005) in \nline with the Tenth Plan\u2019s (Poverty Reduction \nStrategy) target  \n \nImproved key social and poverty indicators as \nspecified in the Tenth Plan \n\nPurpose/Objectives \n \nSupport implementation of the \nGovernment\u2019s PRS as embodied in the \nTenth Plan by focusing on strengthening  \n(i) the fiscal position, (ii) disengaging the \nGovernment from public enterprises (PEs) \nmanagement and ownership, and (iii) public \nand corporate sector governance \n \n\n  \nImproved fiscal position, especially allocation of higher \nbudgetary resources for development expenditure as \nspecified in the Tenth Plan and MTEF \n \nReduced budgetary transfer to PEs, liquidation of \nPEs, and adoption of a medium - to long-term strategy \nfor divestment \n \nRightsizing civil service, decentralization and \ndevolution, and improved public sector accountability \n \nImproved legal and institutional environment for the \ncorporate sector \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStreamlined resource \nmobilization and expenditure \npattern as indicated in the Tenth \nPlan and Medium-Term \nExpenditure Framework (MTEF) \n  \nPoverty-focused prioritization of \nannual expenditure in line with \nthe Tenth Plan and MTEF  \n \nEconomic, social, and poverty \nstatistics  \n \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) \nstatistics  \n \nProgram progress reports \n \n \nTenth Plan and MTEF \n \nAnnual budgets of the \nGovernment  \n \nImplementation progress of the \nRevenue Mobilization Action \nPlan \n \nAnnouncements in the Nepal \nPublic Gazette of various actions \ninvolving PEs and civil service \n \nProgram progress reports \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) \nreviews  \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\n \n\n \nPolitical and macro-\neconomic stability \n \nContainment of the \ninternal conflict and \nnegotiating a peace \nprocess \n \nStrong political \ncommitment to reforms \nacross the political \nspectrum  \n\n \nStrong commitment of \nthe Government to \naddress the current \nfiscal problems \n \nNo deterioration in \ndomestic s ecurity \nsituation  \n \nGovernment support for \nprivatization of state-\nowned institutions as \nstated in FY2003 budget \nand the Economic \nReforms Program of \nOctober 2002 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n\ni\n\n \n\n5\n1\n\n \n\n\f5\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n\ni\n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Indicators and Targets \n\nMonitoring Mechanisms \n\nOutputs \n \n1.

The fiscal situation has deteriorated sharply due to internal security \nproblems,  uncertain  global  conditions,  and  a  precipitous  slowdown  in  economic  growth.  The \nresource  crunch  has  sharply  reduced  the  development  expenditure,  which  is  currently  much \nlower  than  that  required  to  meet  the  Tenth  Plan\u2019s  targets.    This  is  adversely  affecting  the \nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  deliver  social  services  and  combat  poverty.  The  problems  are  further \ncompounded by lack of good governance. The Public Sector Management Program (PSMP) will \nassist the Government in improving its fiscal position, improve the effectiveness of resource use \nfor  economic  development,  and  improve  governance.  In  the  absence  of  the  policy  measures \nsuggested  in  the  PSMP,  the  fiscal  situation  is  likely  to  further  deteriorate,  development \nexpenditure  would  drop,  resource  use  for  development  would  be  ineffective,  and  key \ngovernance  constraints  would  remain  unresolved.  In  fact,  the  Government  would  be  in  a  very \nweak  position  to  implement  the  Tenth  Plan,  as  its  capacity  to  provide  basic  social services \nwould be considerably weakened, and poverty reduction efforts would have minimal impact on \npoverty reduction and human resource development. \n \nIn line with the resource requirements of the Tenth Plan, the Government needs to raise \n2. \nthe  revenue/gross  domestic  product  ratio  by  2%  points  over  the  Plan  period.  If  that  is  not \naccomplished, resources will be insufficient to meet the development expenditure target of the \nTenth  Plan.  In  the  absence  of  the  PSMP,  which  requires  the  Government  to  develop  and \nimplement  a  comprehensive  Revenue  Mobilization  Action  Plan,  the  existing  fiscal  situation \nwould not show perceptible improvement. Revenue losses due to low customs valuation, wide \nrange  of  exemptions,  and  leakages  would  continue.  The  PSMP  also  seeks  to strengthen the \nInternal Revenue Department by filling the essential positions, which are currently vacant. In the \nabsence  of  the  PSMP,  the  tax  administration  system  would  continue  to  remain  weak.  Further, \nwhile  the  Government  has  expressed  its  intention  to  disengage  from  ownership  of  public \nenterprises  (PEs)  except  in  certain  critical  social  sectors,  it  neither  has  the  resources  nor  the \ntechnical  capacity  to  undertake  divestment  in  a  systematic  manner.  The  PSMP  will  assist  the \nGovernment in addressing the various constraints hampering divestment. \n \n3. \nSimilarly,  in  the  absence  of  reforms  to  improve  public  expenditure  management,  the \nexisting  wasteful  use  of  scarce  resources  would  not  be  curbed,  and  the  effectiveness  of \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  interventions  would  remain  weak.  The  PSMP  seeks  to  put  in \nplace  measures  to  prioritize  and  screen  the  projects  based  on  their  poverty  reduction  impact, \nand  to  introduce  a  system  of  performance-based  budget  release  mechanism  for  priority \nprojects.  These  measures  would  improve  the  poverty  focus  of  the  Government\u2019s  public \nexpenditure  program.  Similarly,  reducing  the  budget  transfers  to  PEs  and  containing  their \ncontingent liabilities and exposures of creditors would improve the fiscal situation, and release \nresources for development expenditure, which will be utilized for poverty reduction interventions \nin line with the objectives of the Tenth Plan. The PSMP will also help the Government improve \ngovernance, a key element in the successful implementation of the poverty  reduction strategy. \nWithout  the  PSMP,  the  Government  would  make  slower  progress  in  devolving  essential \nservices  to  the  local  bodies,  improving  the  capacity  of  the  local  bodies  to  administer  and \nimplement  projects/programs,  and  in  strengthening  the  participatory approach to development \nof the poorer regions of Nepal.  \n \n \n\n\f \n\n70\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact of the Program \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nGeneral Impact \n\n \nThe PSMP supports the effective implementation of the Tenth Plan at a time when the \n4. \nGovernment  is  facing  a  severe  resource  crunch  to  pursue  the  poverty  reduction  strategy.  To \nhelp the Government implement the core elements of the Tenth Plan and to sharpen the poverty \nreduction  impact,  the  PSMP  supports  the  prioritization  of  programs  and  projects  by  poverty-\nbased  criteria,  higher  allocation  of  resources  to  priority  social  sectors  (basic  education,  basic \nhealth,  and  drinking  water),  poverty-focused  programs  for  vulnerable  targeted  groups  and \nareas,  good  governance  including  decentralization  for  empowering  people,  and  poverty-based \nblock  grants  to  the  local  bodies.  Refocusing  expenditure  on  poverty  reduction  interventions \nwould  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  opportunities  for  the  poor  to  improve  their  income  and \nsocial  indicators.  Empowering  local  bodies,  improving  in  the  government  service delivery, and \nraising  the  allocation  of  public  resources  for  the  priority  sectors  will  also  help  accelerate  the \npace of poverty reduction.  \n \n5. \nPoor  governance  in  the  past  has  undermined  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nefforts.  Addressing  governance-related  issues  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Tenth  Plan,  and  is \nsupported in the PSMP. Support for the Government\u2019s decentralization plan, aimed at improving \nparticipation  by  the  stakeholders  and  thereby  strengthening  governance,  forms  an  important \ncomponent of the PSMP. The PSMP supports delegation of greater administrative and financial \nautonomy  to  the  local  bodies,  strengthening  their  technical  capacity  to  maintain  infrastructure, \nand inculcating greater accountability. Involving beneficiaries in the decision-making process will \nhave a positive impact and improve governance. The PSMP also supports greater transparency \nof civil servants and makes it mandatory for class 2 officials and above to declare their assets. \nIn addition, under the PSMP the Government will prepare and implement a comprehensive anti-\ncorruption  strategy  that  includes  both  preventive  and  prosecution  measures.  The  PSMP  also \nsupports  the  improvement  of  public  sector  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  which  is  a \nimportant  loophole  in  preventing  corruption.  Taken  together,  the  measures  will  improve \ngovernance, increase the participation of the poor in decision making, and curb corruption. \n\n \n2. \n\nImpact on the Labor Market \n\n \n6. \nWhile the Government has agreed to prioritize and streamline development expenditure, \nand  decrease  the  total  number  of  development  projects  by  at  least  25%,  the  impact  on \nemployment  will  be  minimal.  Most  of  the  projects  dropped  were  not  being  implemented \neffectively  due  to  scarcity  of  resources  and  the  limited  capacity  of  the Government in project \nimplementation.  The  Government\u2019s  assessment  is  that  since  the  implementation  of  these \nprojects  was  being  held  up,  or  was  moving  very  slowly,  they  were  unable  to  generate  much \nemployment. On the other hand, by focusing development  expenditure on priority projects and \nusing  a  poverty-based  formula  for  allocating  resources,  the  overall  employment  generated  by \ndevelopment projects should increase, especially in areas of high poverty concentration. \n \nUnder  the  PSMP,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  liquidate  or  privatize  9  PEs.  It  is \n7. \nestimated that about 4,000 employees are likely to be affected by the liquidation or sale of PEs.  \nThere will be some short- to medium-term adverse impact on the staff employed in these units. \nThe Program will seek to mitigate the impact by ensuring that all dues to staff, including wages \nin arrears and other benefits such as pension contributions as well as severance pay, are fully \npaid  in  accordance  with  relevant  legislation,  internal  rules,  and  negotiated  agreements. The \nnumber of affected staff is probably an overestimate because some of the employees could be \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n71\n\n \n\nabsorbed in the privatized enterprise. However, considering the widespread overstaffing in PEs, \nwhich is usually a result of political patronage, the adverse impact of privatization and liquidation \nof  PEs  on  employment,  particularly  on  semiskilled  and  unskilled  workers,  cannot  be  avoided. \nThe  Program  will  closely  monitor  the  impact  and  will  assist  in  developing  and  implementing  a \ncomprehensive  policy  on  retrenchment-related  mitigation  measures  and  social  dialogue  in  the \ncase  of  closure,  liquidation,  or  privatization.  The  policy  will  include  both  monetary  and \nnonmonetary measures, and will provide the framework for specific divestment initiatives. \n \nUnder the PSMP, the Government will also cap aggregate employment in the PEs, with \n8. \nthe cap being automatically reduced subsequent to each retrenchment. The rationale underlying \nthis  reform  is  that  PEs  are  overstaffed  and  their  commercial  viability  is,  to  large extent, being \ncompromised  by  overemployment.  The  employment  freeze  in  PEs  is  consistent  with  the \nGovernment policy of moving out of sectors in which private enterprises can be more efficient \nand profitable. The Tenth Plan envisages that public investment will henceforth focus on social \nsectors,  agriculture-related  activities,  transport,  electricity,  and  water.  About  72%  of  the  Tenth \nPlan\u2019s aggregate investment requirement of $7.7 billion will be met by the private sector. Taking \nthe  investment  pattern  into  account,  the  bulk  of  the  additional  employment  in  Nepal  will  be \ncreated in the private sector, and PE employment will shrink over time. The impact of freezing \nemployment in PEs will, therefore, not be a constraining factor in future employment creation.   \n\n \nEliminating  7,500  vacant  Government  positions  will  have  no  effect  on  current  public \n9. \nemployment.  A  3-year  freeze  on  employment  within  the  Government  could  limit  future \nemployment  opportunities.  This  is  unlikely  to  be  a  major  constraint  on  future  employment \ncreation for the reasons cited in para. 8 \n \n\n3. \n\nImpact on Prices of Goods and Services \n\n  \n10. \nThe  reform  measures  under  the  PSMP  will  not  have  any  discernible,  direct  or  indirect, \nimpact on prices of goods and services. There could be some beneficial impact on prices, if the \nprivatized PEs are able to produce goods and services more efficiently and at lower cost. In the \nshort to medium term, however, this impact is likely to be negligible. \n \n\n4. \n\nImpact on Access to Public Services \n\n \n11. \nThe PSMP will have a positive impact on the access of the poor to public services.  First,  \nan  increase  in  resource  mobilization  and  more  focused  and  prudent  public  expenditure \nmanagement  will  make  additional  resources  available  for  pursuing  the  poverty  reduction \nagenda. The process will be facilitated by screening of projects, and prioritizing them depending \non  their  poverty-reducing  impact.  Further,  block  grants  to  the  local  bodies  will  be  allocated  on \nthe basis of a poverty-based formula. Second, devolution of some functions to the local bodies \nwill  increase  the  services  delivered  to  the  poor  due  to  beneficiary  participation  in  the \nmanagement and control of resources, and also by more accountable monitoring. The transfer \nof the management of schools to the community school management committees is expected to \nhave a significant positive impact on service quality, through an increased number of teachers in \nthe  schools,  particularly  in  remote  areas.  The  devolution  of  agriculture  extension,  basic \neducation  and  health  posts  to  the  local  bodies  will  strengthen  the  delivery  of  services  at  the \nVDC and DDC level and thus benefit the poor. \n \nC. \n \n12. \n\nUnder  the  PSMP,  the  Government  will  adopt  measures  to  mitigate  the  effects  of \n\nMitigating Unemployment Impact and Enhancement Measures \n\n\f \n\n72\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nretrenchment  on  account  of  liquidation/privatization  of  9  PEs.  The  measures  will  include \nexploring  alternatives  to  retrenchment,  monetary  and  nonmonetary  packages,  skills  training  to \nenhance  the  capability  of  laid-off  workers,  and  services  relating  to  alternative  employment \npossibilities. Laid-off workers will be trained at a cost of NRs10,000 per person. The PSMP will \nalso introduce a social dialogue process, and procedures for grievance redressal.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n73\n\n \n\nSUMMARY OF THE INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nYes \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSectors identified as a National Priority \nin Country Poverty Partnership \nAgreement?   \n\n \nA. \nSectors identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \n \nThis Program supports the Tenth Plan (FY2003-FY2007), which is also the poverty reduction strategy of the country. \nTo achieve the goal of reducing poverty from 38% to 30%, the Plan emphasizes prioritization of programs and projects \nby poverty-based criteria, higher allocation of resources for social priority sectors (basic education, basic health and \ndrinking  water),  poverty-focused  programs  for  vulnerable  targeted  groups  and  areas,  good  governance\u2014including \ndecentralization  for  empowering  people\u2014poverty  indicator-based  block  grant  to  the  local  bodies.    Thus  the  overall \nimpact of refocusing expenditure on poverty-related measures would have a positive impact on the target groups. Both \nper capita income and human development indicators are likely to improve.  \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                         Proposed Classification:    Other  \n\nYes \n\nThematic:                             Good Governance \n\n \nADB conducted an in-depth poverty analysis of the country before signing the Poverty Partnership Agreement. Based \non  the  Nepal  Living  Standards  Survey  (1996),  the  Government  defines  the  threshold  for  poverty  at  an  annual  per \ncapita income of NRs4,404. People below this threshold have been estimated at 38% at the end the Ninth Plan period \n(FY1997-FY2002).  Large  segments  of  the  poor  are  hard  core  or  chronic,  barely  managing  a  subsistence  living  on \nfragile  and  vulnerable  ecosystems.  Large  parts  of  the  country  lack  even  the  most  basic  infrastructure,  which  is \nreflected by very low socio economic indicators in certain districts.  \n \nThere are wide variations in poverty based on rural-urban divide, gender, geography, ethnic group, and occupational \ncaste.  About  44%  of  the  rural  households  and  23%  of  the  urban  households  are  estimated  to  lie  below  the  poverty \nline. Given that close to 88% of the total population reside in rural areas, poverty is much more widespread in the rural \nareas.  While  poverty  does  not  vary  much  between  the  hill  and  Terai  regions,  it  is  much  higher  in  the  mountainous \nregion. Distribution of poverty incidence across the five development regions indicates that the number of households \nbelow  the  poverty  line  in  the  eastern  and  central  development  regions  are  less  than  those  in  other  development \nregions.  There  are  more  poor  people  in  the  remote  rural  western  part  of  the  country.  Poverty  incidence  is  higher \namong  the  people  belonging  to  the  lower  caste  groups,  ethnic  minorities.  Weak  governance,  low  growth  rate,  high \npopulation growth rate, urban-centered growth, and inadequate socio economic infrastructure are some of the reasons \nfor the perpetuation of poverty in Nepal.  \n \nWeak governance is a major impediment to the poverty reduction efforts . Empowerment of people, accountability and \ntransparency  in  resource  use,  prioritizing  and  closely  monitoring  public  expenditures,  streamlining  the  civil  service, \nstrengthening  decentralization  for  better  delivery  of  public  services,  and  controlling  corruption  are  some  of  the \nimportant  measures  in  improving  weak  governance.  Adopting  these  measures  will  reduce  the  gap  in  poverty  level \nbetween rural and urban areas, between sexes, and lead to better regional balance in development. \n \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nStakeholder Analysis.  The Program supports the implementation of the Tenth Plan. The Tenth Plan was prepared \nthrough  a  consultative  process  with  stakeholders  at  different  levels\u2014community,  district,  village  development \ncommittees and national. Stakeholders included nongovernment organizations, community-based organizations, other \nprofessional organizations, policy decision makers, political parties, and also the aid agencies. \n \nThe Program will involve various stakeholders at different levels.  The local bodies will have more authority and will be \ninvolved  in  implementing  the  Program.  Public  enterprise  (PE)  labor  will  be  affected  by  the  liquidation/privatization  of \nthe 9 PEs. \n \nParticipation  Strategy  Required.    The  Program  includes  measures  for  greater  participation  of  concerned \nstakeholders  in  the  decision-making  process.  Boards  for  PEs  are  to  be  reconstituted  with  greater  participation  of \nprofessionals. Devolution of public services to local bodies and capacity building for them will enhance participation at \nthe local level. The Policy on Retrenchment and Social Dialogue to be developed in a participatory manner will include \nconsultation measures in case of specific divestment initiatives. \n \n\n\f \n\n74\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nD. \n\nPotential Issues \n\n \n\n \nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \n\n \nResettlement   \n\n \nUncertain  \n\n \nGender \n\n \nUncertain \n\n \nAffordability \n\n \nNone \n\n \nLabor \n \n \n\n \nSignificant \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeople \n \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities  \n\n \nNone \n\n \nSignificant \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\n \n\n \n\nOutput Prepared  \n\n \nResettlement impacts are at present unclear. The sale of land as \ncore or noncore assets of PEs may have resettlement effects. \nAssurance has been obtained from the Government that the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement will \napply in case of any resettlement. \n \n \nUncertain but potentially an issue because a more precise \nassessment of the gender impact of disengagement from PEs \ncan be made after more data becomes available.  \n \n \nThere are no affordability-related issues from the beneficiary or \ninstitutional points of view. \n \n \nEmployment promotion is foreseen in the medium term as a \nresult of increased private sector participation, commercialization \nof informal sectors, and devolution of certain functions at the \nlocal level, leading to increased economic activities at the local \nlevel as well. In the short run, retrenchment of employees will \ncause unemployment, for which mitigation measures are \nproposed. Retrenchment following the closure of the nine PEs \nidentified under the Program will be mitigated by ensuring that all \ndues to staff, whether wages in arrears and other benefits, or \nseverance pay, will be paid in full and on a priority basis.

To  help  the  Government  implement  the  core  elements  of  the  Tenth  Plan  and  sharpen  the  poverty  reduction  impact,  the  Program \nsupports the prioritization of projects by poverty-based criteria, disengagement of Government from PEs, higher allocation of resources for social priority sectors \nsuch as basic education, good governance including decentralization, and poverty-based block grant to the local bodies.  \n \nNet Impacts:  The Program is expected to have a positive overall net impact on the opportunities for the poor to improve their income and social indicators. The \ndirect impact of the Program will be largely pro-poor, giving them better access to public services, and greater transfer of resources to backward and poor areas. \nThe  indirect  impact  can  be  generally  pro-poor,  as  the  majority  of  the  population  is  considered  poor.  The  actions  taken  under  the  Program  will  contribute  to \ninstitution  building  for  efficient  public  sector  administration  and  policy  making  conducive  to  private-sector-led  economic  growth,  which  will  naturally  reduce \naggregate  poverty.  Indirect  impacts  can  benefit  the  poor  disproportionately  through  improved  access  to  public  services  that  have  otherwise  been  limited  to  the \nurban population.  \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n7\n7\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 13 June 2003) \n", "Currency Unit \nNRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe  Nepalese  rupee  is  pegged  to  the  Indian  rupee  (Re)  at  NRs1.60  to  Re1.00  and  is  fully \nconvertible on all current account transactions. \n \n \n", "Nepalese rupee/s (NRe/NRs) \n$0.0128 \nNRs77.00 \n", "= \n= \n= \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \nADB \n \nCCD \n \nDDC \nDFID \n \nDIDO   \n \nDIP \n10FYP  \n \nGDP \n \nGRP \n \nIAP \n \nIMF \n \nIRD \nIRO \n \nLSGA   \nMOF \n \nMTEF   \n \nNEA \n \nNRB \n \nNRM \n \nOAG \nPAN \n \n \nPC \nPCSC   \nPE \n \nPERC   \n \nPIU \nPRS \n \nPSMP   \n \nTA \n \nVAT \n \nVDC \n \n \n", "- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n-  \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nCorporation Coordination Division \ndistrict development committee \nDepartment for International Development \nDistrict Infrastructure Development Office \nDecentralization Implementation Plan \nTenth Five-Year Plan \ngross domestic product \nGovernance Reform Program \nImmediate Action Plan \nInternational Monetary Fund \nInternal Revenue Department \nInland Revenue Office \nLocal Self-Governance Act \nMinistry of Finance \nMedium-Term Expenditure Framework \nNepal Electricity Authority \nNepal Rastra Bank \nNepal Resident Mission \nOffice of Auditor General \nPermanent Account Number \nPrivatization Committee \nPrivatization Coordination Sub-Committee \npublic enterprise \nPublic Expenditure Review Commission \nProject Implementation Unit \npoverty reduction strategy \nPublic Sector Management Program \ntechnical assistance \nvalue added tax \nvillage development committee \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", " \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  15  July.
