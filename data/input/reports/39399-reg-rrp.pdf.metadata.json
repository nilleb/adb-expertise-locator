The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts.  A  summary  of  the  initial  environmental \nexaminations  (IEEs)  conducted  for  the  Project  is  provided  as  a  core \nappendix.  Full  environmental  assessment  documents  for  subprojects \nin  the  three  countries  and  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures for Bangladesh are in a supplementary appendix. \n \nThe Project will develop and improve tourism-related infrastructure in \nNepal, India, and Bangladesh. It will focus on improving connectivity to \nand destination infrastructure and services in key nature and culture-\nbased  tourism  sites  on  selected  high-priority  subregional  circuits. \nInfrastructure  interventions  will  include  airport  upgrading,  last  mile \nroad  connectivity,  environmental  improvements  of  destinations,  such \nas water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management; and visitor \nmanagement  infrastructure  and  services.  The  physical  interventions \nwill  be  accompanied  with  a  program  of  capacity  building  in  each \ncountry  to  develop  the  capacities  of  sector  agencies  for  sustainable \nprotection and management of natural and cultural heritage of tourism \nimportance.  Moreover,  the  Project  will  implement  a  program  in  each \ncountry to better engage local communities in tourism to enhance the \neconomic  linkages  between  local  populations  and  tourism,  and \nincrease benefits from tourism to the subregion\u2019s communities.  \n \nSouth  Asia,  particularly  the  area  which  contains  Nepal,  north  and \nnortheastern states of India, and Bangladesh (the subregion), is one of \nthe  poor  regions  of  the  world.  However,  the  subregion  has  vast  and \ndiverse  cultural  and  natural  resources  and  contains  many  of  the \nworld\u2019s  major  Buddhist  sites,  which  potentially  position  it  as  a  world \ndestination for nature and culture-based tourism.  Tourism plays a vital \n\n\frole  in  the  subregion\u2019s  economy.  During  1999  to  2006,  international \ntourist  arrivals  grew  at  an  average  rate  of  8%,  higher  than  the  world \naverage.  In 2007, tourism earnings from international visitors totaled \n$12.3  billion,  representing  a  150%  increase  from  2003;  and  tourism \ndirectly employed 13.76 million people in the three countries (including \nall of India). Tourism in  the subregion, however, remains constrained \nby  (i)  inadequate  connectivity  and  destination  infrastructure;  (ii)  weak \nprotection and management of heritage assets of tourism importance, \nwhich  threaten  the  environmental  and  cultural  sustainability;  and  (iii) \ninadequate  community  engagement.  Together  these  limit  the  growth \nprospect  and  ability  of  tourism  to  significantly  contribute  to  the \neconomy and poverty reduction. The Project is required to address the \ninfrastructure  and  management  deficiencies,  and  foster  community \nparticipation  in  nature  and  culture-based  tourism  by  supporting \nintegrated development of priority destinations in high-potential circuits \nof subregional importance. \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  promote  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth  in  South \nAsia  through  tourism  infrastructure  development  that  will  tap  the \neconomic  potential  of  contiguous  and  complementary  tourism  assets \nof  Nepal,  India,  and  Bangladesh.  The  impact  will  be  reflected  as  an \nincrease in the contribution of tourism to the subregion\u2019s economy and \nemployment  opportunities,  including  local  livelihoods.  The  Project \noutcome  will  be  several  key \ntourism  circuits  (of  subregional \nimportance)  of  nature  and  culture-based  destinations  with  (i) \nenhanced  connectivity,  (ii)  better  quality  environment  and  visitor \nservices, (iii) improved natural and cultural heritage and capacities for \nheritage  management,  and  (iv)  greater  community  engagement  in \nheritage management and tourism benefits.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $89.5  million, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  of  $7.35  million.  The  project  cost  for  the \nNepal  component  is  $46.5  million;  for  the  India  component  $28.0 \nmillion; and for the Bangladesh component $15.0 million. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  to  Nepal  a  loan  of \nSDR8,234,000  ($12.75  million  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nand  with  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  A  grant  of  $12.75  million \nequivalent from ADB's Special Funds resources will also be provided \nto Nepal. The Government of Nepal will provide $6.0 million equivalent \nas  counterpart \nInternational \nDevelopment  will  provide  $15.0  million  as  cofinancing  to  finance  part \nof the Nepal component of the Project. \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nthe  OPEC  Fund \n\nfunds  and \n\nfor \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii \n\nA  loan  of  $20.0  million  equivalent  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital \nresources  will  be  provided  to  India  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.

A  national  project \nsteering  committee  will  be  established  in  each  country  to  provide \npolicy guidance and oversee project implementation.  \n \nIn  Nepal,  a  project  coordination  unit  will  be  formed  in  the  Ministry  of \nTourism  and  Civil  Aviation  to  undertake  overall  monitoring  and \nprogress \nreporting  of  activities  of  project  management  and \nimplementation  units  to  be  set  up  in  the  two  implementing  agencies, \ni.e.,  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Nepal  and  the  Lumbini  Development \nTrust.  \n \nIn India, a project management and implementation unit will be set up \nin the Sikkim State Department of Tourism that is designated as both \nproject executing and implementing agency.  \n \nIn  Bangladesh,  similarly  a  project  management  and  implementation \nunit  will  be  set  up  in  the  Department  of  Archaeology,  the  project \nexecuting and implementing agency. \n \nGoods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  and  the  OPEC  Fund  for \nInternational Development will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  used  for  civil \nworks contracts estimated to cost $10.0 million or more in India, $2.0 \nmillion or more in Bangladesh, and $1.0 million or more in Nepal; and \nfor supply contracts valued at $1.0 million or higher. The upper limit for \ncivil  works  to  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  will  be  less  than  $10.0  million  in  India,  $2.0  million  in \nBangladesh,  and  $1.0  million  in  Nepal;  and  for  equipment  the  upper \nlimit  will  be  $1.0  million.  Shopping  will  be  used  for  contracts  for \nprocurement  of  equipment  and  simple  civil  works  worth  $100,000  or \nless.  \n \nTeams of international and national consultants will be engaged to assist \nin  managing  and  implementing  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  Services  will  be  required  in  the  areas  of  project  management, \ndetailed  design,  supervision,  community  participation,  environmental \nand  social  safeguards,  project  performance  monitoring,  heritage \nplanning  and  management,  ecotourism,  airport  engineering, \ninstitutional  development,  and  financial  management.  A  total  of  935 \nperson-months  consulting  services  is  expected  to  be  required  for  the \nProject; 417 person-months (30 person-months international and 387 \nperson-months  national)  for  Nepal;  333  person-months  (12  person-\nmonths  international  and  321  person-months  national)  for  India;  and \n185 person-months (25 person-months international and 160 person-\nmonths national) for Bangladesh.  \n \n\n\fProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \nRisk and \nAssumptions \n\nv \n\nimprove \n\njobs,  and \n\nThe  increased  tourist  arrivals,  length  of  stay,  and  expenditure  as  a \nresult  of  project  interventions  will  enable  each  country  to  earn  more \nforeign  exchange,  generate  additional \ntotal \neconomic  output.  Preservation  and  effective  management  of  natural \nand cultural heritage sites will help ensure continued benefits from the \nassets  into  the  future.  Improved  environment  and  infrastructure  in \ndestinations  will  enhance  the  experience  of  tourists  and  the  living \nconditions  and  public  health  of  communities  living  in  and  around  the \nsites.  Enhanced  air  and  road  connectivity  to  the  new  tourism \ndestinations in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India will benefit tourists while \nimproving  access  and  mobility  of  local  residents  living  around  these \ncurrently isolated locations. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  approach,  which  favors  expanding  existing  tourism \npatterns into remote areas and concepts like \u201cgreater Himalayan trail\u201d \nor  \u201cvillage  tourism,\u201d  will  help  spread  tourism  benefits  to  communities \ncurrently  bypassed  by  tourism  markets.  Inclusive  approaches  will  be \nreinforced  by  special efforts  to  raise  awareness  and  develop  skills  of \ncommunities to increase tourism livelihood opportunities. \n  \nThe Project is expected to benefit an overall 2.4 million people through \nincreased \nincome,  employment,  and  health  and  environmental \nimprovements;  and  reduced  travel  time.  About  270,000  people  will \nbenefit from additional employment in the tourism industry and related \nindustries. At least 5,000 local livelihoods will be created improving the \nlives  of  nearby  communities.  Capacity  development  activities  will \nequip  around  250  practitioners  with  skills  for  enhanced  protection, \nmanagement, and marketing of key destinations in the three countries.\n\n \nThe  major  risks  of  the  proposed  Project  are  related  to  (i)  lower  than \nexpected  market  demand  for  the  tourism  destinations  and  passenger \narrivals  for  Gautam  Buddha  airport,  (ii)  sustainability  of  heritage  sites \nand  tourism  assets  created,  (iii)  suboptimal  benefits  to  local  people \nfrom  enhanced  heritage  and  tourism  growth,  and  (iv)  poor  project \nimplementation  performance  resulting  in  delays  and  timely  accrual  of \nbenefits. The Project addresses these risks through various measures. \n \nThe  conservative  assumptions  used  in  assessing  the  tourism  market \nand  passenger  demands  for  the  sites  will  mitigate  the  risk  for  lower \nthan  expected  market  demand.  Moreover,  the  Project  will  support  a \nmarketing and promotion program for the sites and circuits developed \nto ensure that the projected market demand will materialize.    \n \nRisk  for  sustainability  of  the  heritage  sites  will  be  mitigated  by  (i) \nimproving  the  protection,  environment,  and  visitor  infrastructure;  (ii) \nenhancing  capacity  of  public  sector  site  managers;  (iii)  supporting \npreparation and implementation of management plans for the heritage \nsites; (iv) gaining community support for heritage management through \nawareness  programs;  and  (v) \nimplementing  revenue  generation \nreforms to create sustainable sources of funds for managing the sites.  \n\n\fThe  Project  will  ensure  that  tourism  will  not  bypass  the  communities. \nIts approach and concept to expand current tourism patterns to remote \ndestinations will help spread tourism benefits more widely. Community \nawareness  programs  on  potential  benefits  from  tourism  will  be \nconducted.  The  Project  will  support  community  training  and  skills \ndevelopment,  as  well  as  schemes  for  village  tourism  and  heritage-\nbased  tourism  livelihood  generation.  Where  available,  the  services  of \nnongovernment  organizations  or  other  development  partners  with \nfor  effective \nin  similar  programs  will  be  sought \ncompetence \nengagement of communities in tourism.     \n \nThe  risk  of  slow  project \nimplementation  will  be  mitigated  by \nestablishing  project  coordination  units  and  project  management  and \nimplementation units as efficient units with qualified staff supported by \nproject  management  and  design  consultants.  Moreover,  a  regional \ntechnical  assistance  commencing  before  the  project  effectiveness  in \neach country will provide an up-front support to the project agencies in \nundertaking  project  start-up  activities,  recruiting  consultants,  and \npreparing the detailed design of first batch subprojects. \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n\f1 \n\nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  proposed \nloans to Nepal, India and the People's Republic of Bangladesh, (ii) a proposed grant to Nepal, \nand  (iii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the  Organization  of  Petroleum \nExporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for International Development (OFID) to Nepal for the South \nAsia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project. The design and monitoring framework for the \nProject is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \nSouth  Asia  is  one  of  the  poor  regions  in  the  world.  Poverty  is  concentrated  in  the \n2. \nnortheastern  part  of  the  region,  including  Nepal,  the  northeastern  states  of  India,  and \nBangladesh (the subregion). However, the subregion is endowed with vast and diverse cultural \nand natural resources that give it the opportunity to build a globally competitive tourism sector. \nThe  subregion  has  an  ancient  cultural  heritage  of  more  than  5,000  years  old,  and  is  home  to \nmany  natural  and  cultural  heritage  sites  inscribed  in  the  World  Heritage  List.  The  subregion \ncontains  the  world\u2019s  highest  mountain,  the  eastern  Himalayan  range.  It  has  a  rich  diversity  of \nethnic groups with distinctive cultures. The subregion is also home to the \u201cBuddhist heartland\u201d \n\u2014an area that contains many of the world\u2019s major Buddhist sites.  \n \n3. \nIn  Nepal,  Lumbini,  the  birthplace  of  Buddha  is  the  icon  of  the  Footsteps  of  the  Lord \nBuddha  circuit.  The  circuit  follows  the  chronological  steps  of  Buddha\u2019s  life,  and  links  with  the \nBuddhist attractions of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states of India appealing to the growing number \nof international Buddhist pilgrims and spiritual tourists. The Footsteps of the Lord Buddha circuit \nis the jewel in the crown of Buddhist circuits that justifies the \u201cBuddhist heartland\" label for the \nsubregion.  The  Sacred  Garden  in  Lumbini,  where  Buddha  was  born,  is  inscribed  as  a  World \nHeritage site due to its outstanding universal value.  \n \n4. \nIn  India,  the  Sikkim  state,  which  is  strategically  located  at  the  center  of  the  subregion, \nhas  spectacular  and  picturesque  nature,  and  is  home  to  the  well-known  Kanchendzonga \nnational  park  with  hundreds  of  species  of  flora  and  fauna.  The  state  also  has  a  rich  Buddhist \nheritage,  including  the  world-renowned  Rumtek  Monastery  which  attracts  visitors  from  all  over \nthe  world.  Sikkim  is  only  2  hours  drive  from  the  Indian  city  of  Bagdogra,  i.e.,  the  subregional \nhub,  with  existing  and  potential  links  to  Bangladesh,  Nepal,  and  Bhutan.  Located  on  the \nHimalayas, Sikkim forms part of the greater Himalayan trail1 \u2014a development concept as well \nas a physical trail that extends the full length of the Himalayas through Nepal, India and Bhutan; \nlinking the popular destinations with remote valleys.  \n  \nBangladesh, despite its relatively limited international recognition, has a very rich cultural \n5. \nheritage.  The  heritage  sites  concentrated  along  a  corridor  from  north  to  south  in  the  western \nregions  of  Bangladesh  are  especially  important,  and  have  existing  and  potential  links  to  the \nnortheast region of India in the north and West Bengal of India in the south. The corridor forms \npart  of  a  potential  multi-country  circuit  called  the  Bangladesh  India  Cultural  Heritage  Highway \ncircuit.  The  four  heritage  sites  along  the  Bangladesh  Heritage  Highway  have  outstanding \nuniversal  cultural  value  and  are  popular  visitor  attractions  among  Bangladesh\u2019s  391  cultural \nheritage sites. Paharpur, a world heritage site, is the single largest Buddhist Monastery built in \nthe 8th century. Kantajee is the largest Hindu terracotta temple in the world. Mahastangarh is an \n                                                 \n1  Greater Himalayan Trail was first proposed by The Mountain Institute and trekking entrepreneurs, and was included \n\nin the 2004 South Asia Tourism Strategy as one of the key concepts and priority areas for development. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nancient  Buddhist  city  which  is  about  to  be  inscribed  in  the  World  Heritage  List.  Bagerhat, \nanother world heritage site on the southern part of the corridor, is a splendid mosque complex \nwith a 77 domed mosque and eight other mosques nearby.   \n \nAccording to World Travel & Tourism Council statistics, during 2000\u20132007, international \n6. \ntourist arrivals in Nepal, India (northeastern states), and Bangladesh grew at an average rate of \n8% reaching almost double the global average of 4.8%. Total international arrivals were about \n5.7  million  in  2007,  representing  a  73%  increase  from  2000.  In  2007,  tourism  earnings  from \ninternational  visitors  totaled  $12.3  billion,  representing  a  150%  increase  from  the  tourism \nearnings  of  2003,  and  tourism  directly  employed  13.76  million  people  in  the  three  countries \n(including  all  of  India).  Growth  in  the  region  has  been  fuelled  by  India.  While  international \narrivals  to  Bangladesh  and  Nepal  have  fluctuated  in  2000\u20132006,  demand  has  improved \nmarkedly in 2007 with an estimated increase in arrivals of at least 6% for Bangladesh and 20%, \nfor Nepal.   \n \n7. \nAs  for  the  specific  culture  and  nature-based  attractions  of  the  region,  a  more  specific \nanalysis carried out under project preparatory technical assistance (TA)2 suggests that Lumbini \nin Nepal currently receives an estimated 500,000 annual visitors, including 71,000 international \ntourists.  Sikkim  State  in  India  receives  an  estimated  210,000  tourists  including  18,000 \ninternational tourists. The cultural attractions of the Bangladesh Heritage Highway are estimated \nto receive 370,000 visitors annually including 36,000 international visitors. The key international \nmarkets  include  the  regional  market  segments  of  Thailand,  Republic  of  Korea,  Japan,  the \nPeople's Republic of China, the European countries of the United Kingdom, France, Germany \nand Italy; and the United States of America, Canada, and Australia.         \n \nAvailable data suggest that tourism is a multicountry activity in the region. Considerable \n8. \nnumbers of international visitors combine several countries for their visit. A recent exit survey in \nIndia  indicates  that  one-third  of  foreign  tourists  visit  India  in  combination  with  other  countries, \nnotably  Nepal.  A  2006  study  in  Bhutan  records  that  25%  of  visitors  combined  their  visits  with \nIndia, 13% with Nepal, and 8% with Nepal and India.      \n \n9. \nAccording  to  United  Nations  World  Tourism  Organization  estimates,  the  global  market \nfor  nature  and  culture-based  tourism  is  growing  about  five  times  the  growth  rate  of  standard \ntourism.  The  western  ecotourism  market  segments  provide  convincing  potential  for  the \nsubregion in terms of both volume and yield. Similarly, for Buddhist attractions, strong growth in \ndemand  is  observed  from  both  domestic  and  international  markets,  which  range  across  a \nspectrum from pilgrims on a religious quest, to long-staying visitors pursuing spiritual studies or \nBuddhist  spiritual  well-being,  and  general  sightseers.  The  subregion\u2019s  unique  natural  and \ncultural endowments therefore position it as a world destination for spiritual and heritage tourism \noffering immense opportunities for the socioeconomic growth of the subregion. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nDespite  the  impressive  range  of  its  superb  cultural,  natural,  and  spiritual  endowments \nand  sharp  increases  in  tourist  arrivals  in  recent  years,  the  subregion\u2019s  share  of  world  tourism \nremains insignificant. In 2007, the three countries\u2019 5.7 million international visitors represented \n0.4% of world tourism. Potential tourists in the source markets and the tourism industry widely \nperceive the region as a \u201cdifficult\u201d destination for a number of reasons.  \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  for  Preparing  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Tourism \n\nDevelopment Project. Manila (TA 6362- REG, December, $1.0 million). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nLimited  Connectivity.  An  important  constraint  to  tourism  growth  in  the  participating \n11. \ncountries  is  inadequate  connectivity.  Access  to  the  heritage  assets  is  a  major  impediment. \nDistances  from  source  markets  to  the  subregion  as  well  as  within  the  subregion  are  so  great \nthat  air  access  in  some  cases  is  vital  to  tourism  development.  This  is  especially  the  case  for \nLumbini  in  Nepal  where  connectivity  to  the  site  is  limited,  with  no  direct  air  services  from  key \nregional and international visitor markets. Air access to Lumbini is through Kathmandu only. The \nairport, located within half an hour drive from Lumbini, currently serves only to domestic flights. \nThere  is  need  to  upgrade  this  airport  to  enable  direct  access  of  growing  number  of  visitors  to \nLumbini by increasing the airport\u2019s capacity for the load and volume of passengers, enhancing \nits  service  level,  and  increasing  its  ability  to  handle  international  air  traffic.  There  are  also \naccessibility constraints arising from poor \"last mile\" road connectivity to many of the important \nsites along the Bangladesh Heritage Highway and in Sikkim State in India. These deter tourists \nfrom  visiting  these  significant  cultural  and  natural  sites  and  hinder  the  potential  to  expand \ncurrent  tourism  patterns  and  spread  tourism  benefits  more  widely.  If  the  subregion  is  to  be \npresented  on  a  world  stage,  providing  access  to  places,  where  culture  and  nature-based \ntourism products can be delivered, is a fundamental need.   \n \n12. \nInadequate Destination Infrastructure. There is a general perception of the subregion \nin the marketplace as poorly developed tourism destinations. Environmental standards are poor. \nUtilities  and  civic  services,  such  as  water,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  are \ninadequate and do not provide safe and attractive environments for visitors. In all of the cultural \nand natural heritage sites of tourism importance (including Lumbini in Nepal, Sikkim\u2019s  Rumtek \nmonastery and nature-based sites, and heritage sites along the Bangladesh Heritage Highway), \ntraffic management around the sites is inadequate; parking is limited; on-site visitor circulation \nremains  poor;  public  amenities  such  as  rest  rooms  and  toilets  are  unfit  for  visitor  use;  basic \nvisitor  information  and  site  interpretation  facilities  are  either  unavailable  or  substandard;  the \nmonuments  along  the  Bangladesh  Heritage  Highway  are  in  need  of  conservation  to  maintain \ntheir  cultural  value;  and  the  infrastructure  to  properly  protect  key  cultural  and  natural  heritage \nsites  from  adverse  effects  of  tourism  and  the  surrounding  populations  is  not  in  place. \nInadequate environmental services, on-site infrastructure, and facilities are causing degradation \nof  heritage  structures  and  undermining  the  cultural  and  natural  value  of  these  heritage  sites, \nwhile  adversely  affecting  the  visitor  experience.  Lack  of  visitor  information  and  interpretation \nfacilities is limiting proper interpretation of the subregion\u2019s heritage. There is an urgent need to \nimprove the infrastructure and services in these sites most of which are World Heritage Sites.  \n \n13.  Weak Heritage Protection and Destination Management. The subregions' enormous \npotential for tourism development is further constrained by inadequate institutional capacity and \nhuman  resources  of  sector  agencies  to  plan,  develop,  protect,  and  manage  these  heritage \ndestinations and deliver quality tourist experiences. Capacity of public sector agencies such as \nNepal\u2019s  Lumbini  Development  Trust  (LDT),  India\u2019s  Sikkim  Department  of  Tourism,  and \nBangladesh\u2019s  Department  of  Archeology,  which  are  responsible  for  managing  their  respective \nsites,  are  in  need  of  strengthening.  The  master  plans  for  Nepal's  Lumbini  and  Bangladesh\u2019s \ncultural heritage sites are outdated while no master plan exists for Sikkim\u2019s Rumtek monastery. \nSimilarly,  site  management  plans  either  do  not  exist  or  are  not  being  implemented.  Funds  for \nprotection and management of heritage assets and sites are grossly inadequate. Tourist entry \nfees  and  user  charges,  which  can  be  used  for  sustainable  sources  of  revenue  for  site \nmanagement,  are  not  sufficient.  The  situation  is  aggravated  by  inadequate  community \nawareness  of  the  value  of  the  cultural  and  natural  heritage,  and  potential  benefits  that  will \naccrue  from  sustainable  heritage  tourism.  Sustainable  heritage  tourism  in  the  subregion  is \nfurther constrained by weak capacity of existing training institutions and absence of a center of \nexcellence  specializing  in  sustainable  culture  and  nature-based  tourism.  The  resulting  weak \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nincluding  accommodation,  retail,  and \n\nprotection  and  management  of  heritage  destinations  is  a  major  risk,  which  unless  effectively \naddressed, could result in the loss of these indispensable heritage assets and tourism markets. \n \n14. \nInadequate  Community  Engagement.  The  heritage  sites  in  the  subregion,  including \nNepal\u2019s  Lumbini,  Bangladesh  Heritage  Highway  sites,  and  nature  and  culture-based  heritage \nsites in Sikkim in India, are all located far from major growth centers, and therefore offer great \npotential for diversifying and spreading tourism benefits in the subregion. However, the absence \nof connectivity and destination infrastructure constrains potential benefits from tourism to local \ncommunities. Potential benefits are further limited by inadequate mobilization of communities in \ntourism,  lack  of  tourism-related  skills  among  the  local  populations,  and  weak  supply  chain \nlinkages between the local economy and tourism. There are immense opportunities to promote \ninclusive tourism and community tourism products in and around Nepal\u2019s Lumbini, Bangladesh \nHeritage  Highway  sites,  and  Sikkim\u2019s  Buddhist  circuit  and  natural  sites  through  infrastructure \ndevelopment and special efforts for mobilizing communities to engage in the tourism economy. \nThe  subregion  has  already  had  good  practices  of  inclusive  tourism  such  as  the  Tourism  for \nRural  Poverty  Alleviation  program  (TRPA)  in  Nepal  and  the  award-winning  village  tourism \nprojects in Sikkim. There is need to foster participation of communities in tourism and increase \nthe benefits to local populations building on these good practices.  \n \nLimited  Public  Private  Partnerships.  Currently  the  private  sector  provides  hospitality \n15. \ninadequate \nservices, \nconnectivity  and  destination  infrastructure  creates  an  unfavorable  climate  for  the  hospitality \nindustry,  whose  investments  are  needed  for  tourism  growth  and  tourism-related  employment \ngeneration  in  the  subregion.  Investments  to  improve  connectivity  and  destinations,  which  are \nin \nidentified \ncomplementary  hospitality  services.  While  planned  and  regulated  public  sector  investments  in \nkey connectivity and environmental improvements and protection of these environmentally and \nculturally sensitive heritage sites are essential at this time, there is need in the medium term to \npromote,  (i)  partnerships  between  the  community,  and  the  private  and  public  sectors  in \ncommunity-based  tourism  to  enhance  marketability  (e.g.,  heritage  village  products);  and  (ii) \nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  management  of  sites  and  assets  in  a  regulated  manner  for \nmore  efficient  and  sustainable  management  of  heritage  sites  and  properties.  There is  need  to \ntest and gradually introduce innovative partnership models.  \n \n16. \nCross-Border Travel. Many tourists to the subregion combine travel to a few countries. \nHowever, currently some border points do not offer efficient and smooth services for the entry \nand  exit  of  tourists.  Benefits  will  significantly  increase  in  the  long-run  if  cross-border  travel  is \nfurther streamlined. Possible actions to facilitate cross-border travel include, depending on the \nspecific  border  point,  streamlining  visa  issuance  procedures,  facilitating  tourist  vehicle \nmovements,  and  coordinating  border  opening  times  and  duration.  The  participating  countries \nrecognize these issues and they are at various stages of addressing them. A recently approved \nregional TA3 will also support the three countries and their subregional partners in developing a \nplan of action to streamline cross-border travel in the subregion.  \n  \nParticipating Governments\u2019 Policies. Notwithstanding the above constraints, all of the \n17. \nparticipating  countries\u2019  policies  promote  sustainable  and  inclusive  development.  The  countries \nprioritize  tourism  as  a  sector  with  capacity  to  make  a  significant  contribution  to  inclusive \ndevelopment,  enhanced  protection  and  management  of  natural  and  cultural  assets,  and \n\nin  close  consultation  with \n\ntour  operations.  However, \n\ninduce  private \n\nindustry,  will \n\ninvestments \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Improving Connectivity and Destination Management of Cultural and Natural \nResources  of  South  Asia  Subregion.  Manila  (TA  6504-REG,  December,  $2.0  million  financed  by  the  Regional \nCooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nsustainable development of physical environments. Nepal's Interim Plan (2008\u20132010) reaffirms \nthe Government's plans for further supporting tourism as a major contributor to economic growth \nand livelihood generation through air transport and destination improvements. India's 11th Five \nYear  Plan  (2008\u20132012)  confirms  the  Government\u2019s  continued  commitment  to  tourism \ndevelopment  as  also  reflected  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB)  country  partnership \nstrategy (2008-2012) for India. Likewise, the Government of Bangladesh since 1999 recognizes \ntourism  as  a  thrust  sector;  it  acknowledges  the  need  to  tap  the  potential  of  the  country's  vast \ncultural heritage for inclusive tourism growth. The recent cultural policy of Bangladesh confirms \nthe priority attached by the Government to enhanced management of heritage.   \n  \n18. \nSubregional  Cooperation  in  Tourism.  Until  recently,  each  of  the  three  countries  has \nbeen trying to carve out a niche in the market without any efforts to tap the potential synergies \nof tourism endowments available in the subregion. In 2001, Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, and \ntheir subregional partners (i.e., Bhutan and Sri Lanka) recognized the need to work together to \npromote tourism. The three countries and their subregional partners acknowledged that tourism \nin South Asia is a multicountry activity, and that there is need to harness the complementarities \nand  contiguity  of  individual  country  tourism  endowments.  In  2001,  a  tourism  working  group \n(TWG) was  formed comprising members of the national tourism organizations of Nepal, India, \nBangladesh,  and  Bhutan  under  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Program \n(SASEC).  The  TWG  was  subsequently  expanded  with  the  participation  of  Sri  Lanka.  In  2004, \nthe  TWG  with  ADB  assistance  developed  and  adopted  a  tourism  strategy4,  covering  the  five \ncountries,  and  building  on  the  national  tourism  plans.  Since  then,  the  tourism  strategy  has \nprovided  a  framework  for  coordinated  efforts  of  the  TWG  to  promote  tourism  based  on  the \nthemes of nature and culture-based tourism, including Buddhist circuits.  \n \n19. \nTowards  Joint  Development  of  Infrastructure.  More  recently,  the  TWG  countries \naspired  to  work  toward  more  tangible  outcomes  through  joint  development  of  tourism \ninfrastructure  in  a  phased  manner.  A  South  Asia  Tourism  Circuit  and  Infrastructure  Vision, \nprepared with ADB support (footnote 2) and endorsed by the TWG demonstrates the countries\u2019 \ncommitment  to  joint  development  of  infrastructure  along  defined  multi-country  circuits  that \ncombine  complementary  country  assets  into  marketable  subregional  tourism  products.  A \nmulticountry circuit is defined as a route on which more than one or two major destinations are \nlocated in more than one country. In this way, a tourist who enters a destination in one country \nis motivated to visit other destinations along the same route located in another country, hence \nresulting in increased arrivals to all destinations in more than one country.   \n \nSouth  Asia  Tourism  Circuits  and  Infrastructure  Vision.  The  vision,  endorsed  by \n20. \nNepal,  India,  and  Bangladesh  and  their  subregional  partners,  involves  a  pattern  of  interlinked \nmulticountry  circuits  of  nature  and  culture-based  destinations  determined  and  ranked  on  the \nbasis  of  the  criteria,  including  the  levels  of  market  demand,  contribution  to  national  and \nsubregional  tourism  growth,  and  poverty  reduction.  The  vision  also  broadly  identifies  the \ninvestment  requirements  of  these  multicountry  circuits  in  terms  of  access  and  destination \ninfrastructure,  as  well  as  improved  management.  The  vision,  thus,  (i)  provides  a  long-term \ndevelopment  planning  framework  for  phased  development  of  infrastructure  along  multicountry \ncircuits in accordance with priorities and available funds, and (ii) sets the basis for the highest \npriority circuits and the subprojects to be included in the Project (Appendix 2). \n \n21. \nThe  Project  forms  part  of  the  South  Asia  tourism  circuits  and  infrastructure  vision.  It \nincludes  the  integrated  development  of  priority  tourism  infrastructure  and  services  in  selected \n\n                                                 \n4  Prepared under ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Tourism \n\nDevelopment Plan. Manila. (TA 6131-REG, November, $450,000).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nmulticountry  circuits  ranked  in  the  vision  document  as  highest  priority  circuits  with  greatest \npotential for inclusive and sustainable tourism development. The priority circuits, included in the \nProject,  are  (i)  the  Nepal  portion  of  the  Footsteps  of  the  Lord  Buddha  circuit  that  cuts  across \nIndia  and  Nepal,  and  combines  Lumbini,  the  birth  place  of  Buddha  with  the  Buddhist  sites  of \nnorthern India, (ii) the Sikkim portion of both the greater Himalayan trail and the northeast India \ncircuits centered near India\u2019s Bagdogra, an air gateway linking the Himalayan culture, trekking, \nand  adventure  destinations  of  Sikkim,  with  northeastern  Indian  states,  east  Nepal,  northern \nBangladesh,  and  Bhutan,  and  (iii)  the  Bangladesh  Heritage  Highway  connecting  a  cultural \nheritage-focused  corridor  from  north  to  the  south  in  the  western  regions  of  Bangladesh  with \nestablished tourist flows in West Bengal and the northeast region of India.  \n \n22. \nPublic sector intervention in the tourism sector in a subregional framework is required to \n(i)  link  and  collectively  promote  the  complementary  and  contiguous  tourism  attractions  of  the \nsubregion\u2019s countries  that  individually  may  not  be  able  to  attract  high  international  arrivals;  (ii) \nminimize  infrastructure  constraints  and  bottlenecks  that  hamper  tourism  development;  (iii) \nregulate and enhance the sustainable protection and use of public tourism assets of natural and \ncultural  importance  by  tourists,  the  private  sector,  and  communities  to  reduce  negative \nexternalities;  and  (iv)  increase  opportunities  for  the  subregion\u2019s  communities  to  benefit  from \ntourism. The Project will have synergies with other ongoing and planned subregional initiatives, \ne.g., ADB\u2019s subregional transport and communications project.     \n \n23. \nExternal  Assistance  and  Lessons.  No  major  development  partners  are  active  in \nsubregional  tourism  in  South  Asia,  except  JBIC,  which  is  involved  in  tourism  infrastructure \ndevelopment in India, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n(UNESCO)  with  indirect  involvement  through  mostly  technical  assistance  for  the  protection  of \ncultural  heritage  sites.  The  Project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  lending  assistance  for  a  subregional \nproject  in  the  tourism  sector  in  South  Asia.  The  Project  is  a  culmination  of  a  process  of \nsubregional  cooperation  in  tourism  in  which  ADB  has  played  a  major  role  since  2001  under \nSASEC  program.  ADB,  in  accordance  with  its  South  Asia  regional  cooperation  strategy  and \nprogram  (2006\u20132008)  and  through  several  regional  TAs,  supported  the  formation  of  the  TWG \nand a tourism strategy for South Asia. While the strategy has been a useful first step towards a \nframework  for  subregional  action  in  tourism,  it  proved  to  be  too  ambitious  to  lead  to  focused \ninterventions. A following regional TA on human resource development in the tourism sector has \nbeen  effective  in  creating  a  pool  of  trainers  with  a  view  to  cascading  the  knowledge  to  the \nnational level, but again pointed to the need for more focused and sustainable outcomes.  \n \n24.  While ADB, to date, has not provided any lending assistance for subregional tourism in \nSouth Asia, it provided  two loans to Nepal for tourism infrastructure development in 1992 and \n1996. Overall, these projects, especially air connectivity and ecotourism interventions, are found \nrelevant and effective, except urban tourism improvements, which suffered from weak municipal \ncapacities.  Lessons  include  the  following  (i)  marketing  of  destinations  developed  is  critical,  (ii) \nprivate  sector  involvement  in  site  identification  is  needed  to  ensure  viability,  (iii)  community \ninvolvement  enhances  sustainability,  (iv)  rigorous  financial  and  marketability  assessment  of \ntourism sites is required, and (v) up-front capacity building of project agencies is important for \ntimely  implementation  and  sustenance  of  project  outcomes  and  outputs.  A  recent  evaluation \nstudy5 rates ADB assistance to the Greater Mekong Subregion tourism sector \"successful\" while \nproviding  several  lessons,  including  the  need  for  (i)  greater  facilitation  of  border  crossings,  (ii) \ninclusive  approaches  to  ensure  that  tourism  benefits  local  communities,  (iii)  improved  inter-\nsectoral  and  interagency  coordination,  and  (iv)  accurate  demand  analysis.  These  lessons  are \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2008.  Evaluation  Study  on  the  Tourism  Sector  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion.

This  will  be  reflected  in  an  increase  in  the  contribution  of  tourism  to  the \nsubregion\u2019s  economy  and  employment  opportunities.  The  expected  outcomes  are  several \nsubregional  circuits  of  nature  and  culture-based  tourism  destinations  with  (i)  improved \nconnectivity,  (ii)  better  quality  environment  and  visitor  services;  (iii)  enhanced  natural  and \ncultural  heritage,  and  capacity  for  sustainable  heritage  management;  and  (iv)  greater \nengagement of communities in heritage management and tourism benefits. These outcomes will \nbe  achieved  by  (i)  improving  access  and  destination  infrastructure  and  services  in  key  nature \nand culture-based tourism sites located along selected multicountry tourist circuits; (ii) building \nthe  capacities  of  sector  agencies  for  sustainable  protection  and  management  of  natural  and \ncultural heritage sites as well as tourism-related infrastructure and assets e.g., airport; and (iii) \nstrengthening  linkages  between  tourism  and  local  population  and  building  the  capacity  of \ncommunities to enable them to obtain greater benefits from tourism. The Project includes three \ncountries: Nepal, India, and Bangladesh.  \n \nB. \n \nProject outputs include (i) connectivity enhancement; (ii) destination improvements; and \n26. \n(iii)  support \nfostering  community  participation,  capacity  development,  and  project \nmanagement.  The  first  output  involves  upgrading  air  and  road  access  to  selected  natural  and \ncultural  sites  of  importance  for  tourism.

A  key  area  of  assistance  for  the  institute  is  the  smooth  operationalization  and  long-term \nsustainability of the institute under the capacity building subcomponent. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nCommunity  Participation  and  Partnership.  The  subcomponent \n\n \n44. \nVillage  Tourism  Infrastructure  Development.  The  subcomponent  aims  to  use  the \npotential of the major destinations to attract tourists to surrounding villages. It focuses on three \nvillages each within easy access of the Rumtek monastery  circuit, West Sikkim trekking trails, \nand  the  Himalayan  Training  Institute.  Improvements  are  targeted  at  enhancing  the  physical \nenvironment  and  heritage  of  villages  and  visitor  services.  These  include,  depending  on  the \nspecific  needs  of  each  village,  provision  of  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management \nimprovements;  improvements  to  trekking  trails  passing  through  the  villages;  designing  village \nwalks covering the key village attractions; development of viewpoints; directional signage; visitor \ninformation  centers;  and  cultural  performance  stages.  All  these  physical  improvements  are \naccompanied  by  community  preparation  activities  under  the  capacity  building  subcomponent. \nThe component builds on the award-winning village tourism projects in Sikkim. \n     \n 45. \nFostering Community Participation, Capacity Building, and Project   Management. \nThis  component  aims  to  complement  the  inclusive  infrastructure  development  interventions  in \nSikkim  with  increased  community  engagement  in  sustainable  heritage  management  and \ntourism, and improved capacity of relevant public sector agencies and other stakeholders.  \n \n46. \nincludes  general \nawareness-raising  programs  on  the  importance  of  natural  and  cultural  heritage  sites  and \npotential  benefits  from  tourism  to  the  community.  A  specific  focus  is  placed  on  fostering \ncommunity  engagement  in  (i)  the  West  Sikkim  Himalayan  Trail,  and  (ii)  heritage  villages \nidentified for tourism infrastructure development. Activities in West Sikkim include formation and \ncapacity  development  of  ecodevelopment  committees  representing  local  communities  and \ndeveloping  skills  on  ecotourism  services.  Support  for  heritage  villages  includes  (i)  forming \nvillage  communities;  (ii)  training  villagers  in  heritage  management  and  hospitality  skills \nespecially  in  home-stay  management,  handicraft  development,  and  marketing,  and  other \nactivities; and (iii) establishing links with the distribution end, e.g., the tour operators with a view \nto promoting community, private and public partnership in heritage village tourism. These utilize \nthe  state's  current  enabling  framework  for  community  involvement  in  ecotourism  and  build  on \naward-winning  village  tourism  schemes.  NGOs  with  competence  in  similar  programs  are \nexpected to be involved as needed (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \nCapacity  Building.  Efforts  are  directed  at  (i)  building  the  capacity  of  relevant  agencies, \n47. \nincluding the Sikkim\u2019s Department of Tourism  (DOT)  which is the executing and implementing \nagency for the Project; and other stakeholders involved in planning, developing, and managing \nthe tourism and heritage assets; and (ii) operationalizing the Himalayan Training Institute. \n \n48. \nAssistance to DOT includes (i) drafting guidelines for nature and culture-based tourism; \n(ii)  establishing  within  DOT  a  unit  for  inclusive  tourism;  (iii)  enhancing  DOT  revenues  through \nlevies  and  collection  of  various  tourist  entry  fees  and  charges,  and  in  the  medium-term  ring-\nfencing  of  tourism  revenues;  (iv)  identifying  areas  of  special  importance  for  regulated \ndevelopment,  and  helping  in  notification  of  those  areas  as  planning  zones;  (v)  preparing  a \nmaster plan for the Rumtek Monastery circuit; and (vi) marketing and promoting the circuits and \nsites  created,  in  coordination  with  subregional  marketing  and  promotion  efforts  under  the \nregional  TA  (footnote  3).  Moreover,  the  assistance  includes  training  of  site  managers  at  key \nagencies i.e., DOT, Department of Forest, the Ecclesiastical Department, and any other relevant \nagency, including Rumtek monastery administration. \n \nSupport  for  operationalizing  the  Himalayan  Training  Institute  involves  developing  and \n49. \nassisting in the implementation of an operation and business plan, including (i) identification of \ntechnical  and  managerial  skills  and  other  requirements  to  run  the  institute;  (ii)  design  of \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ncurricula; (iii) identification of various laws, professional bodies, and committees governing and \nregulating the spectrum of nature and culture-based tourism; (iv) preparation of a prerequisites \nlist  to  obtain  appropriate  affiliations,  all  mandatory  approvals,  and  accreditations  to  conduct \ncredible  training  programs;  (v)  identification  of  potential  strategic  partners  whose  experience, \nexpertise,  and  market  reach  could  be  utilized;  and  (vi)  development  of  measures  to  transform \nthe  institute  in  the  medium-term  into  a  not-for-profit  organization  to  enable  DOT  to  retain  a \nsupervisory role and enhance the financial sustainability of the institute. \n \nProject  Management.  This  subcomponent  supports  funding  the  costs  of  the  PMIU  in \n50. \nDOT and project implementation units in West Sikkim and South Sikkim, including incremental \nadministration and operations, and provision of equipment, logistics, and consulting services.  \n\n \n3. \n\nBangladesh \n\n \n51. \nThe Bangladesh portion of the Project aims to promote key cultural heritage sites along \na heritage-rich geographic corridor extending from north to the south in the western regions of \nBangladesh.  Improving  the  access  and  site  conditions,  protecting  and  managing  these \nsignificant  heritage  sites,  and  promoting  them  through  an  innovative  concept  of  a  \u201cheritage \nhighway\u201d are expected to lead to increasing visitor numbers and the spread of tourism benefits \nto remote communities.  \n \n52. \nThe Bangladesh portion of the proposed Project, to be implemented using a sector loan \napproach,  includes  the  four  key  sites  \u2014Paharpur,  Mahastangarh,  Kantajee,  and  Bagerhat.  A \ndetailed  subproject,  already  prepared  for  Paharpur,  forms  the  first  batch  of  subprojects  for \nimplementation. The subproject serves as a sample for design and feasibility of other sites that \nhave  already  been  identified  and  that  will  be  confirmed  as  subprojects  on  the  basis  of  the \nsubproject selection and preparation criteria set out in section F of Supplementary Appendix C. \nThe  proposed  subproject  for  Paharpur,  a  World  Heritage  Site,  builds  on  plans  and  studies \nconducted by UNESCO.  \n \n53. \nConnectivity Enhancement. This component includes \"last mile\" connectivity roads to \nenhance  access  to  the  sites  and  manage  visitor  movement.  In  the  case  of  Paharpur,  the \ncomponent  include  (i)  developing  an  intermediate  lane  road  to  enable  access  to  the  northern \ngate of the site culminating at the proposed parking space near the northern gateway, and (ii) a \npedestrian  pathway  along  the  eastern  side  to  facilitate  movement  of  local  residents  from \nsurrounding villages without trespassing the heritage site.     \n \nDestination  Improvements.  This  component  includes  (i)  essential  conservation  works \n54. \nto  protect  the  cultural  value  and  authenticity  of  heritage  structures,  (ii)  improvements  to \nenvironmental  infrastructure  and  services,  which  will  prevent  destruction  of  the  sites  and \nstructures and their authenticity and upgrade the quality of the site environment, (iii) provision of \nfacilities  to  address  visitor  needs  and  control  on-site  movement  of  visitors  and  (iv)  enhanced \ninterpretation  and  presentation  of  the  sites.  In  the  case  of  Paharpur,  improvements  aim  to \naddress  the  major  issues  of  (i)  management  of  increased  tourism,  (ii)  accumulation  of  salt  in \nheritage due to inadequate drainage and use of inappropriate material in conservation, and (iii) \nwater  logging  and  resulting  degradation  of  heritage  structures.  Interventions  include  site \ndrainage  improvements;  provision  of  car  parks;  construction  of  a  visitor  information  and \ninterpretation center, ticket boots, toilets, and on-site walkways, on site signage, displays, and \nserviced area for commercial use; and reorganization of the heritage site space though various \nlandscaping work and walkway improvements.        \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nFostering  Community  Participation,  Capacity  Building,  and  Project  Management. \n55. \nThe  component,  as  in  other  two  participating  countries,  aims  to  foster  engagement  of  local \ncommunities  in  heritage  protection  and  tourism,  build  the  capacity  of  agencies  involved  in \nheritage and tourism management, and ensure effective implementation of the Project.  \n \n56. \nCommunity  Participation.  Activities  include  community  awareness-raising  programs  on \nlinkages  between  sustainable  heritage  management  and  tourism,  and  the  potential  benefits \nfrom  heritage  tourism  to  communities.  A  major  activity  is  support  to  the  design  and \nimplementation  of  a  demonstration  scheme  for  tourism  livelihood  generation.  This  involves \nsocial  mobilization,  training  and  skills  development  for  local  communities  in  heritage  site \nmanagement  and  tourism-related  activities,  and  establishment  of  linkages  with  microfinance \nservices  based  on  supply  chain  analysis.  The  activities  also  involve  building  the  capacities  of \nDepartment of Archaeology (DOA) and Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation (BPC) to enable them \nto  better  interface  with  local  communities  and  effectively  engage  in  heritage  tourism.  Local \norganizations  and  NGOs  experienced  in  similar  programs  are  expected  to  be  involved  as \napplicable (Supplementary Appendix F). \n  \n57. \nCapacity Building. The activities are primarily directed at (i) strengthening DOA which is \nresponsible  for  planning  and  managing  the  heritage  sites,  and  (ii)  increasing  the  interface \nbetween  agencies  responsible  for  heritage  management  and  tourism,  i.e.,  the  Ministry  of  Civil \nAviation  and  Tourism,  BPC,  and  DOA  under  the  Ministry  of  Cultural  Affairs.  Support  to  DOA \ninvolves  (i)  developing  organizational  and  operational  systems  for  enhanced  heritage  site \nplanning, protection, and management; (ii) devising measures for increased revenue generation \nfrom  user  fees,  and  creating  dedicated  sources  of  funds  for  heritage  management  where \nfeasible through ring-fencing of incomes from heritage sites; (iii) developing incentive measures \nand conducting training for staff in planning, conservation, and management of heritage tourism; \nand (iv) preparing management plans for heritage sites and key studies for innovative heritage \nprotection and management. Further, assistance is given to BPC in designing and implementing \na marketing program and pilot livelihood scheme.    \n \n58. \nProject  Management.  This  subcomponent  supports  the  PMIU  in  DOA  and  project \nimplementing units at the sites as well as BPC by funding the cost of incremental administration \nand other related costs, e.g., provision of equipment, logistics, and consulting services. \n \nC. \n \nSubregional  Dimension.  The  Project  involves  three  countries  (Nepal,  India,  and \n59. \nBangladesh).  ADB  will  sign  separate  grant  and  loan  agreements  with  each  country.  The \nrationale for a subregional project rather than national tourism projects stems from the fact that \ndevelopment  of  tourism  in  each  country  in  isolation  will  become  increasingly  difficult  in  a \ncompetitive  world  tourism  market.  Isolated  country  efforts  to  develop  tourism  will  also  bring \nsuboptimal  benefits  given  that  tourism  is  a  multicountry  activity  in  the  subregion.  Substantial \nadditional  benefits  will  accrue  through  joint  development  and  promotion  of  high  potential \nmulticountry  circuits  that  link  the  complementary  and  contiguous  heritage  assets  of  individual \ncountries, thus motivating tourists to visit more than one country in the subregion.   \n \n60. \nFocus on  Nature and Culture-Based Tourism. An important feature of the Project is \nits  focus  on  nature  and  culture-based  tourism,  including  Buddhist  circuits.  This  provides  an \nappropriate branding considering the subregion's rich natural and cultural endowments as well \nas the fast-growing global markets for nature and culture-based tourism. Moreover, developing \ntourism based on these themes accompanied with necessary safeguard measures, support for \nplanned  interventions,  and  capacity  building  of  all  stakeholders  on  heritage  management, \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\npresent  greater  opportunities  for  (i)  enhancing  sustainable  protection  and  management  of  the \nnatural  and  cultural  heritage  assets  and  (ii)  stimulating  subregional  action  for  management  of \nprecious subregional heritage upon which the subregion\u2019s tourism depends.  \n \nSupport  for  Sustainability  and  Capacity  Building.  The  Project  supports  the \n61. \ngovernments\u2019  policies  for  sustainable  heritage  management  and  tourism  growth.  It  includes \ncapacity development assistance in each country to assist in the attainment of the action plan, \nspecifically to  (i) guide planned interventions in heritage sites in accordance with international \nbenchmarks;  (ii)  strengthen  public  sector  agencies  in  management  of  heritage  and  tourism \nassets;  (iii)  ensure  community  engagement  in  heritage  protection  and  tourism;  (iv)  strengthen \nsector  agencies  in  entering  partnerships  with  the  community  and  explore  the  opportunity  for \npublic-private  sector  partnership  in  the  management  of  heritage  sites,  and  (v)  enhance \nrevenues  for  sustainable  management  of  heritage  sites  and  other  tourism  infrastructure,  e.g., \nairport,  by  introducing  and  rationalizing  site  entry  fees;  user  charges  for  services,  e.g.,  water \nsupply  and  toilets,  parking  fees  where  these  are  not  concessioned  out;  concession  fees  on \ncommercial  facilities  undertaken  by  the  private  sector,  and the  sale  of  interpretative  materials; \nand  preparation  of  a  Business  Plan  for  the  Gautam  Buddha  airport,  including  airport  fees  and \ncharges.  The  \u201csustainable  heritage  and  tourism  action  plan\u201d  is  in  Appendix  4.  The  Project\u2019s \napproach to public\u2013private partnership is in Supplementary Appendix E.   \n \nInclusive  Tourism.  Inclusive  tourism  principles  are  embedded  in  the  Project.  The \n62. \nProject\u2019s principals, including the (i) consideration of poverty as one of the criteria in selecting \ncircuits and subprojects, (ii) focus on cultural and natural heritage which are mostly located far \nfrom major growth centers, and (iii) inclusion of concepts such as the greater Himalayan trail, all \nenable  linking  the  currently  established  tourism  patterns  to  impoverished  remote  communities \nthus  spreading  tourism  benefits  more  widely.  To  ensure  that  the  communities  can  avail  of  the \nopportunities  created,  the  Project  incorporates  a  specific  program  to  foster  community \nengagement as an integral and tailored element of the Project in each participating country. This \ninvolves community mobilization, awareness-raising, and skills development in tourism; tailored \nschemes to promote tourism livelihood generation in Bangladesh and Nepal; and partnerships \nbetween  the  community,  and  public  and  private  sectors  through  West  Sikkim  ecotourism  and \nvillage tourism in Sikkim State in India (Supplementary Appendixes D, E, and F). \n \nGrant-Funded  Regional  TA.  The  Project  is  supported  by  a  grant-funded  regional  TA \n63. \n(footnote  3)  which  will  commence  ahead  of  the  effectiveness  of  each  loan  and  grant  for  each \nparticipating  country.  The  TA  aims  to  (i)  enhance  the  readiness  of  countries  for  implementing \nthe  Project  through  capacity  building  in  project  management  and  implementation,  and  (ii) \naddress subregional aspects of tourism development. The latter includes support for (i) periodic \nreview  and  coordination  of  the  country-specific  projects  at  the  subregional  level,  (ii)  a \nsubregional tourism marketing and promotion program, (iii) streamlining cross-border travel, (iv) \nsubregional  knowledge  sharing  through  study  tours  and  workshops  on  heritage  tourism  best \npractices  and  innovative  approaches  in  heritage  site  management,  and,  (v)  updating  the \nTourism Strategy of 2004 in line with the evolving priorities and needs for adjustments in view of \nthe new stage of subregional cooperation for joint tourism infrastructure development .  \n \nD. \n \n64. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $89.5 million, including taxes and duties of \n$7.35 million.

The task force will meet annually and be chaired \non a rotational basis between the three countries. The secretariat support to the meetings will \nbe given by the host country with logistical and technical support from the regional TA (footnote \n3).  The  representatives  of  the  national  tourism  organizations  of  other  subregional  partners \n(Bhutan and Sri Lanka) may participate in the meetings as observers. The project organization \nchart is in Appendix 6. Details of project implementation arrangements for each country are in \nSupplementary Appendixes J, K, and L. \n \n71. \nEach country will have a national project steering committee, comprising the secretaries \nof the ministries of tourism as chair and representatives of the ministries of finance and project \nexecuting and implementing agencies and other relevant agencies. The committees will meet as \nrequired,  at  least  biannually  (i)  provide  policy  guidance  and  facilitate  cooperation  among \nagencies involved  in  implementation;  (ii)  ensure  that  project  implementation  arrangements  are \nin  place;  and  (iii)  oversee  overall  project  progress,  including  the  sustainable  heritage  and \ntourism action plan, and address key issues. In the case of India, a state steering committee will \nalso be established in Sikkim state to oversee the India (Sikkim) portion of the Project.  \n \n72. \nIn  Nepal,  the  executing  agency  will  be  MOTCA  where  a  PCU  will  be  established  to \ncoordinate  and  perform  consolidated  project  performance  monitoring  of  the  project  activities \nundertaken  by  the  two  key  implementing  agencies,  i.e.,  CAAN  and  LDT.  PMIUs  will  be \nestablished  in  LDT  and  CAAN  to  manage  and  implement  the  connectivity  enhancement  and \nLumbini  heritage  site  improvements.  In  India,  the  Sikkim  DOT,  where  a  PMIU  will  be \nestablished, will be the executing and implementing agency to manage and implement the India \nportion  of  the  Project.  In  Bangladesh,  DOA  is  designated  as  the  executing  and  implementing \nagency; a PMIU will be established in DOA to manage and implement the Bangladesh portion of \nthe Project.  \n    \n73. \nEach PMIU in Nepal, India and Bangladesh will be headed by a Project Director with a \nteam  of  administrative,  financial,  technical,  cultural,  social,  and  environmental  staff  and  will  (i) \nmonitor  the  Project  and  have  overall  responsibility  for  its  implementation;  (ii)  appoint  project \nmanagement  and  detailed  design  and  capacity  development  consultants;  (iii)  ensure  land \nacquisition and other safeguards; (iv) approve surveys, investigations, engineering designs and \nbid documents; (v) review and endorse procurement of works and goods; (vi) oversee contract \nadministration;  (vii)  organize  awareness  campaigns  and  participation  programs;  (viii)  organize \nand  operate  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  to  be  linked  to  PCU  in  the  case  of \nNepal; (ix) prepare disbursement requests and forward them to ADB through PCU in the case of \nNepal; (x) prepare and submit timely progress reports (through PCU in Nepal); (xi) review and \nfacilitate the progress of the sustainable heritage and tourism action plan and compliance with \nloan covenants; and (xii) design and implement capacity building programs.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nProject  implementation  units  responsible  for  overseeing  the  implementation  and \n74. \nconstruction activities in the field will be established in all the countries as needed. For cultural \nheritage sites in Bangladesh and Lumbini in Nepal, close involvement of UNESCO as a member \nof  the  review  panels  will  be  ensured  to  bring  expert  inputs  in  the  preparation  of  management \nand master plans and detailed design of heritage sites. Capacity development for marketing and \npromotion  will  be  implemented  with  close  involvement  of  Nepal  Tourism  Board  in  Nepal  and \nBPC in Bangladesh.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\nImplementation Period   \n\n2. \n \n75. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  (2009-2014).  Capacity  building  and \ncommunity  awareness  activities  will  take  place  at  the  early  stages  of  project  implementation. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 7.   \n  \n \n \n76.62.  Goods,  civil  works,  and  services  financed  by  ADB  and  OFID  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational competitive bidding procedures will be used for civil works contracts estimated to \ncost $10.0 million or more in India, $2.0 million or more in Bangladesh, and $1.0 million or more \nin Nepal; and for supply contracts valued at $1.0 million or higher. The upper limit for civil works \nto be procured through national competitive bidding procedures will be less than $10.0 million in \nIndia, $2.0 million in Bangladesh, and $1.0 million in Nepal; and for equipment the upper limit \nwill  be  $1.0  million.  Shopping  will  be  used  for  contracts  for  procurement  of  equipment  and \nsimple civil works of $100,000 or less.  \n \n77. \nThe size of procurement packages are made (i) on the basis of the particular nature of \nworks involved\u2014such as cultural heritage improvements, small-scale ecotourism infrastructure \nor  connectivity  infrastructure;  and  (ii)  to  enable  reasonable  competition  in  the  bidding  and  to \nminimize  contract  administration  and  management  efforts  by  the  PCU  and  PMIUs.  Before  the \ncommencement  of  any  procurement  activity  under  national  competitive  bidding,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment will review the public procurement laws of the participating government to ensure \nconsistency  with  the  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Any \nnecessary  modifications  or  clarifications7  will  be  reflected  in  the  relevant  loan  agreement  and \nprocurement  plan.  The  indicative  procurement  packages  will  be  elaborated  upon  and  updated \nby the PMIUs for approval by ADB. An indicative procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n \nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing. Advance action will be undertaken under \n78. \nthe  project  for  procurement  of  civil  works,  equipment,  and  materials,  and  recruitment  of \nconsultants. The Project offers retroactive financing for expenditures incurred during the period \nof  12  months  prior  to  signing  of  the  respective  loan  and  grant  agreements,  and  which  do  not \nexceed an amount equivalent to 20% of the individual loan or grant. The approval of advance \naction and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project.        \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n4. \n \n79. \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the  PCU  and  PMIUs  in  managing  and \nimplementing the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Services will be required in the areas of project management, \ndetailed  design,  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  community  participation, \n\n                                                 \n7  These are available in the form of NCB annexes that become part of the procurement plan. The NCB annexes for \n\nNepal and Bangladesh require review and updating due to recently passed national procurement acts. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nenvironmental  social  safeguards,  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  cultural \nheritage  planning  and  management,  ecotourism  development,  airport  engineering,  institutional \ndevelopment, and financial management.  \n \nTeams of international and national consultants based at the PCU and PMIUs in each of \n80. \nthe  countries  will  assist  in  managing,  monitoring,  and  detailed  design work  and  supervision  of \nthe Project. The consultants will support the PMIUs on a sustained basis; delineate the PMIU\u2019s \nmethod  and  detailed  program  and  work  plans, procedures for  coordination,  management,  and \nreporting; design, installation and operationalization of new systems as required; assist PMIU in \ndetailed  design,  update  environmental  and  resettlement  safeguard  documents,  prepare \ncontracts,  procure  construction  firms,  and  supervise  construction;  assist  in  planning  and \nimplementing  capacity  development,  community  participation,  and  marketing  and  promotion \nactivities and design and conduct of training programs including hands-on training. Consultants \nfor preparing the management and master plans for the cultural heritage sites especially for the \nworld heritage sites in Nepal and Bangladesh may be recruited separately. Services of NGOs \nand community-based organizations will likely be required for capacity building of communities, \nlivelihood  generation,  and  skill  development.  Terms  of  reference  for  consultants  for  each \ncountry are in Supplementary Appendixes M, N, and O. \n   \n81. \nA  total  of  935  person-months  consulting  services  are  expected  to  be  required  for  the \nProject.  The  consulting  services  requirement  for  Nepal  is  417  person-months  (30  person-\nmonths international and 387 person-months national), for India 333 person-months (12 person-\nmonths international and 321 person-months national), and for Bangladesh 185 person-months \n(25  person-months  international  and  160  person-months  national).  For  contract  values  of  at \nleast  $200,000  and  above,  consultants  will  be  selected  following  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  method.  For  contracts  valued  at  less  than  $200,000  and  requiring  highly  specialized \nand  boutique  expertise,  the  consultants  qualification  selection  method  will  be  followed;  for \ncontracts  valued  at  less  than  $100,000,  consultants  will  be  selected  following  the  least-cost \nselection method.  \n\n \n\n5.  \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n82. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  all  three  participating  countries.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nlegal agreements and the bidding documents for each participating country under the Project. In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions \nspecifying  the  rights  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing \nand  implementing  agencies;  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  All  the  PMIUs  in  the  three  countries  will  announce  the \nsubprojects and associated business opportunities on their websites and at least disclose the (i) \nlist  of  participating  bidders,  (ii)  amount  of  the  contracts  awarded,  and  (iii)  goods  and  services \nprocured.  Moreover,  grievance  redress  committees  will  be  formed  with  participation  of  all \nstakeholders in each country to address any public concern on the use of project funds.   \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement \n\n \nPayment  of  eligible  expenditures  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  and  grant  under  the \n83. \nProject  will be  made  in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2007, \nas amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements between ADB and the governments. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nAs the volume of expenditure will be quite large, the executing and implementing agencies will \nbe  provided  with  imprest  accounts  to  enhance  their  liquidity  and  ensure  timely  payments  for \nproject expenditures.  \n \nIn  Nepal,  separate  first  generation  imprest  accounts  will  be  opened  by  MOTCA  and \n84. \noperated  by  PCU  for  the  ADB  loan,  ADB  grant,  and  OFID  loan.  Concurrently  CAAN  will  open \nseparate second generation imprest accounts (SGIAs) for the ADB loan, ADB grant, and OFID \nloan  in  current  accounts  in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  LDT  will  open  a  separate \nSGIA for the ADB grant. In India, the Government will open a first generation imprest account in \nthe  account  of  the  Controller  of  Aid  Accounts  and  Audit  with  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India.  The \nSikkim state government will open an SGIA as a current account in a reputed commercial bank \nsubject  to  commitment  of  the  state  and  DOT  to  adhere  to  ADB  procedures  for  operating  the \nSGIA.  All  disbursements  made  by  ADB  towards  imprest  advance  or  replenishment  should  be \ncredited to SGIA within 30 calendar days. In Bangladesh, the Government will open an imprest \naccount at the Bangladesh Bank which will fund an SGIA to be opened by DOA at a commercial \nbank selected in accordance with Borrower's procedures that are acceptable to ADB.  \n  \n85. \nThe initial advances to and the ceiling of each of the imprest accounts will be based on \nestimated expenditures for the first 6 months or 10% of the total ADB grant and/or loan amount, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  each  country  and  ADB.  The \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  and  liquidate  eligible \nexpenditures not exceeding $100,000 equivalent per individual payment. The project fund flows \nfor each country are included in Supplementary Appendixes J, K, and L. \n \n \n\nAccounting Auditing and Reporting \n\n7. \n \nThe  PCU  in  Nepal  and  PMIUs  and  project  implementation  units  in  Nepal,  India,  and \n86. \nBangladesh  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted \naccounting principles for all expenditures incurred for the Project, whether funded out of loan or \ngrant proceeds or other sources. They will establish and maintain separate records for works, \ngoods and services financed out of loan proceeds. The participating governments will cause the \ndetailed  consolidated  project  accounts,  as  maintained  by  the  PCU,  PMIUs  and  project \nimplementation  untis,  to  be  audited  by  independent  auditors,  whose  qualifications,  experience \nand terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. The use of imprest accounts and statement of \nexpenditures  will  be  part  of  the  annual  audit  and  the  audit  report  should  include  a  separate \nopinion on the use of imprest accounts and statement of expenditures. ADB reserves the right \nto verify the financial accounts of the PCU, PMIUs, and project implementation units to confirm \nthat  the  share  of  ADB\u2019s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures. \nThe audited accounts will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Review    \n\n \n87. \nThe  PCU  in  MOTCA  in  Nepal,  and  the  PMIUs  in  Sikkim  DOT  (India)  and  DOA \n(Bangladesh)  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  a  project  performance  monitoring  system \nacceptable to ADB within 3 months of the effectiveness of the loans and grant. The monitoring \nsystem  will  track  project  implementation  activities,  target  dates,  expected  inputs,  impacts, \noutcomes  and  outputs,  and  responsibilities,  including  those  for  the  sustainable  heritage  and \ntourism action plan.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21 \n\nThe  PCU  in  Nepal  and  the  PMIUs  in  India  and  Bangladesh  will  provide  ADB  with \n88. \nquarterly progress reports informing of the national projects' progress. The reports will provide \nsummary  financial  accounts  of  the  Project  including  summary  account  for  each  implementing \nagency,  expenditures  to  date,  and  a  report  on  benefit  monitoring.  An  ADB  project  inception \nmission will be fielded soon after the approval of the loans and grant. Regular review missions \nwill be held twice yearly, with a midterm review in 2012. The midterm review will assess issues \nor weaknesses in implementation arrangements, and agree on changes needed. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nAll  subprojects  have  a  strong  economic  rationale  since  many  of  the  services  required     \n\n \nA.  \n \n89. \n(i)  are  natural  monopolies  unsuited  to  unregulated  private  investment,  and  hence  justify \ngovernment intervention; (ii) include environmental protection and sanitation improvement which \nprotects public goods (such as a safe and clean environment) and prevents negative situations \narising  from  pollution;  and  (iii)  incorporate  inclusive  approaches  that  minimize  inefficiencies  of \neconomic  growth.  The  design  of  all  subprojects  were  based  on  sound  principles  of  need  and \npriority that support the Project\u2019s primary themes of nature and culture-based tourism including \nBuddhist circuits, incorporate demand forecasts based on local surveys and tourism trends, and \nrepresent the least-cost technically viable options that emphasize rehabilitation or expansion of \ninfrastructure facilities.     \n \n90. \nThe economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were estimated to range from 23.76% to \n33.21%,  exceeding  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  and  confirming  the  economic \nrobustness  of  the  proposed  subprojects.  The  overall  EIRR  is  28.27%  demonstrating  the \neconomic  viability  of  the  whole  Project.  A  sensitivity  analysis,  undertaken  to  further  test  the \neconomic viability of the subprojects, ascertained that the subprojects are economically robust \nunder most conditions. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the EIRRs will be highly \nsensitive to a reduction or a delay in benefits. To address these risks, the Project is designed to \nsupport the participating Governments\u2019 coordinated marketing and promotion programs for the \ncircuits developed, as well as skill development programs in local communities to upgrade the \nquality of professional tourism services available.  \n\n \n\n \n\n91. \nA  distribution  analysis  of  the  quantified  benefits  from  the  Project  was  also  conducted. \nThe  major  stakeholders  of  the  Project  are  (i)  the  governments,  (ii)  labor,  and  (iii)  households, \nincluding  those  comprising  the  nearby  communities  in  the  selected  destination  sites.  The \ngovernments  involved  will  gain  an  estimated  $52.5  million  from  the  Project,  mainly  from \nincreased  tax  revenues  arising  from  increased  incremental  tourist  spending,  as  well  as \npassenger movements. Laborers, both unskilled and skilled, will gain an estimated $37.3 million \nfrom  the  Project  through  wage  payments  and  salaries  paid  by  incremental  businesses  arising \nfrom  the  increased  tourism  spending.  Households  will  benefit  from  the  increased  number  of \ntourists  and  their  expenditures  increasing  by  an  estimated  $17.4  million.  A  subregional \ndistribution  analysis  was  also  undertaken  (Appendix  9,  para.  11).  The  analysis  confirms  that \nlabor and households stand to gain substantially from the Project.  \n \n92. \nThe  poverty  reduction  impact  will  be  higher  in  local  communities  surrounding  the \ndestinations  to  be  improved  and  made  more  accessible  by  the  Project.  These  results  can  be \ntraced  to  the  inclusive  principles  embedded  in  the  project  design  (para.  62).  The  community \ncapacity  building  and  skill  development  activities  of  the  Project  will  increase  employment \nopportunities  particularly  for  those  likely  to  be  engaged  in  hospitality  and  heritage  tourism \nservices  and  will  enable  nearby  communities  to  maximize  their  local  earnings  from  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nadditional  local  employment  and  alternative  livelihood  opportunities  arising  from  the  Project. \nDetails of the economic analysis are in Appendix 9. Economic analyses for each country are in \nSupplementary Appendixes P, Q, and R.  \n \nB.  \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n93. \nThe financial assessment established that all the executing and implementing agencies \nhave the basic financial reporting, internal controls, and audit systems for the Project. Capacity \nwill  be  further  strengthened  by  training  of  staff  from  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in \neach country in accounting, budgeting, financial information management, reporting, and use of \ninformation technology. In addition, indicative financial improvement action plans formulated by \nthe  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  ensure  their  subprojects\u2019  financial  viability  and \nsustainability.  Current  tourism  fees  charged  in  the  destination  sites  are  deemed  low.  The \nindicative financial improvement action plans reflect this and incorporate the need for increased \nrates  and  new  charges  to  generate  sufficient  financial  revenues  to  meet  the  operating  needs, \nand potentially the capital investment requirements of the destination sites.       \n \n94. \nThe  financial  evaluation  of  subprojects  was  undertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant \n2009 prices. The financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) for the subprojects were estimated to \nrange from 3.72% percent to 9.03%, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital which was \ncalculated to be between 0.19%\u20132.75%. The sensitivity analysis confirms the financial viability \nof the proposed subprojects and the Project as a whole. The results of the sensitivity analysis \nindicate  that  the  FIRRs  are  most  responsive  to  reductions  in  the  projected  financial  revenues. \nThe governments\u2019 financial improvement action plans were prepared to mitigate this risk. Details \nof  the  financial  analysis,  including  the  indicative  financial  improvement  action  plans  are  in \nAppendix 9. Country-specific analyses are in Supplementary Appendixes P, Q, and R.  \n \nC. \n \nSocial.  The  subregion  is  in  a  vulnerable  zone.  Himalayan  regions  are  sensitive \n95. \nearthquake zones prone to landslides, while floods and cyclones bring extensive damage to the \nlow-lying areas. Although poverty has decreased in the last 2 decades in the project countries \n(poverty  headcount  for  Nepal  at  31%,  India  at  35%,  and  Bangladesh  at  50%),  with  the  high \npopulation  this  translates  to  high  absolute  poverty.  Economic  growth  and  employment  are \nnecessary  to  reduce  poverty.  Given  the  extreme  climatic  conditions  and  vulnerability  of  the \nproject  countries,  new  sources  of  employment  must  be  found  by  utilizing  the  strengths  of  the \ncountries. The Project will contribute to sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty in the \nsubregion  by  developing  environmentally  and  culturally  sustainable  and  socially  inclusive \ntourism,  leading  to  increased  employment,  better  distributed  incomes  and  benefits  to  the \nsubregion\u2019s  communities,  and  enhanced  conservation  and  management  of  the  subregion\u2019s \nnatural  and  cultural  assets.  The  poverty  and  social  strategy  for  the  Project  is  summarized  in \nAppendix 10. \n  \n \n96. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  governments'  and  ADB's \npolicy  and  requirements  on  involuntary  resettlement,  a  full  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for \nthe Gautam Buddha airport upgrading component in Nepal, a short resettlement plan has been \nprepared  for  Rumtek  monastery  component  in  India,  and  a  resettlement  framework  has  been \nprepared  for  future  subprojects  in  Bangladesh  (Supplementary  Appendix  S).  The  resettlement \nplans outline the involuntary resettlement objectives and strategy for affected persons based on \nnational and state laws and policies of the three countries and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995).  The  resettlement  plans  provide  a  comparison  of  these  and  address  gaps \n(summarized in Appendix 11). \n\n22 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23 \n\nEnvironment  \n\n \n97. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  In  all \nsubprojects,  to  the  extent  possible,  works  will  be  within  existing  facilities  on  government  land. \nFor  the  sample  subproject  in  Bangladesh;  the  West  Sikkim  destination  improvements  and \nHimalayan Training Institute component in India; and the Lumbini improvements in Nepal there \nwill  be  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  as  all  works  will  be  within  unencroached \nexisting facilities on government land. While most of the Rumtek monastery circuit component in \nIndia  and  Gautam  Buddha  airport  upgrading  in  Nepal  will  be  within  the  existing  premises,  the \nmultilevel  parking  and  Shanti  viewpoint  works  in  Rumtek  monastery  circuit  and  the  runway \nexpansion in Gautam Buddha airport require land acquisition. \n \n98. \nIn  Rumtek,  land  acquisition  (0.6  hectares)  for  multilevel  parking  will  affect  five  people \nand  their  families.  The land  is  used  for  agriculture  and  has  one  structure  (a  makeshift  pigsty). \nThe  Shanti  viewpoint  has  four  tenants  operating  eateries  and  tea  shops.  They  will  be \ntemporarily  affected  during  construction,  but  will  be  provided  commercial  space  after  the \nconstruction of the viewpoint. In Gautam Buddha airport, strip land acquisition (92.89 hectares) \nwill  affect  590  plots  belonging  to  312  households.  Affected  lands  are  agricultural  with  the \nexception of 17 plots with residential structures. The land acquisition will also affect 132 fruit and \ntimber trees, two primary schools (one private school serving 300 students and one government \nschool serving 500 students), 80 wells, one shrine, and a portion of a poultry farm. Due to the \nproposed expansion, 10 km of village access roads will be disrupted and require reconstruction. \n \nD. \n \n99. \nTo  ensure  compliance  with  the  governments  and  ADB  policy  and  requirements  on \nenvironmental assessment and management, seven Initial Environmental Examinations (IEEs) \nhave been prepared for subprojects in Nepal and India, and a sample subproject in Bangladesh. \nAn environmental assessment and review procedure (EARP) was also prepared for subprojects \nin  Bangladesh.  These  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  T,  and  summarized  in  Appendix  12. \nCultural and natural heritage subprojects will have positive environmental impacts particularly in \nand  around  the  sites  through  the  provision  of  basic  infrastructure  amenities:  water  supply, \nsanitation facilities, site drainage, and solid waste management (paras. 29, 39\u201341, and 54). The \nIEEs  also  show  that  while  cultural  and  natural  heritage  subprojects  may  be  sited  in \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas,  the  works  are  designed  to  result  in  improvements  in \nenvironmental conditions on-site. \n  \n100.  Environmental  impacts  due  to  the  Gautam  Buddha  airport  upgrading  are  largely \nconstruction  related\u2014civil  construction  works  associated  with  the  proposed  upgrading  (para. \n28). There are no impacts on sensitive receptors. The modeling of air and noise impacts due to \nthe air traffic do not indicate significant impacts on surrounding communities, and do not require \nany further assessments or special mitigation measures. Any adverse environmental impact can \nbe  addressed  through  proper  location,  planning,  and  design  of  the  subproject;  control  of \nconstruction  activity;  proper  system  maintenance  following  construction;  and  mitigation \nmeasures.  The  IEEs  prescribe  measures  to  ensure  preservation  of  archaeological  sites  and \nsensitive ecosystems including careful design in consultation with government and other experts \nsuch as UNESCO, and consistent with masterplans developed, engagement of experts during \nall  stages  of  the  Project  to  ensure  mitigating  negative  impacts,  siting  improvements  only  in \nareas  designated  for  ecotourism  and  outside  core  areas,  and  planning  construction  to  ensure \nreduced  risks  to  cultural  and  natural  heritage.  Stakeholders  were  consulted  about  the \nsubprojects  and  no  significant  environmental  issues  were  raised.  Environmental  management \nplans  (EMPs)  were  prepared,  and  the  contract  clauses  specified  in  the  EMPs  will  address \nconstruction-related  impacts  and  effectively  minimize  any  adverse  impacts.  Implementation \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\narrangements  provide  for  inputs  of  environmental  specialists  at  the  PCU  and  PMIUs  during \nproject  implementation  to  effectively  implement  the  EMPs,  and  undertake  monitoring  with \nreports submitted periodically to ADB. \n \nE. \n\nRisks \n\n101.  The  main  risks  of  the  Project  relate  to  (i)  lower  than  expected  market  demand  for  the \ntourism destinations and the passenger arrivals for Gautam Buddha airport, (ii) sustainability of \nheritage  assets  and  tourism  infrastructure  upgraded,  (iii)  suboptimal  benefits  to  local \ncommunities  from  enhanced  heritage  management  and  tourism  growth,  and  (iv)  poor  project \nimplementation performance resulting in delays and accrual of benefits. The Project addresses \nthese risks through various measures.  \n \n102.  The  conservative  assumptions  used  in  assessing  the  tourism  market  and  passenger \ndemands  will  mitigate  the  risk  of  lower  than  expected  market  demand.  To  ensure  that  the \nprojected  demand  will  materialize  for  the  culture  and  nature-based  tourism  sites  and  the \nconnectivity  infrastructure  upgraded,  the  Project  will  support  a  marketing  and  promotion \nprogram for the multicountry circuits and destinations created.    \n \n103.  The Project will make sure that tourism will not bypass the communities. An awareness-\nraising  program  will  be  conducted  at  the  outset  of  the  Project  on  tourism  benefits  and  the \nlinkage between sustainable heritage management and tourism growth. The Project will support \ncapacity and skill development of communities, as well as pilot schemes for promoting heritage-\nbased tourism livelihood generation. Where available, services of NGOs and other development \npartners  with  experience  in  such  programs  will  be  sought  to  ensure  the  engagement  of \ncommunities in tourism and heritage management.     \n \n104.  Risks  to  sustainability  of  the  heritage  sites  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  improving  protection \nand environmental infrastructure; (ii) enhancing capacities of Nepal\u2019s LDT, Bangladesh\u2019s DOA, \nand India\u2019s DOT of Sikkim, and other stakeholders for heritage management; (iii) supporting the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  management  plans  for  the  heritage  sites;  (iv)  gaining  \ncommunity support for heritage site protection through awareness-raising, and (v) implementing \nrevenue  generation  reforms  to  create  sustainable  sources  of  funds  for  managing  the  sites.  All \nthese  will  be  supported  by  the  Project  under  the  capacity  building  component  as  well  as \nsubregional  knowledge-sharing  activities  under  the  grant-funded  regional  TA  (footnote  3).  The \nimplementation progress of the sustainable heritage and tourism action plan will be monitored \nby  PMIUs,  national  project  steering  committees,  and  STF  which  will  be  supported  by  ADB \nreview missions maintaining active dialogue with each country during project implementation.  \n \n105.  Finally,  the  risks  for  slow  project  implementation  will  be  mitigated  by  establishing  PCU \nand  PMIUs  with  qualified  staff  supported  by  project  management  and  design  consultants.  In \naddition,  the  regional  TA  (footnote  3)  commencing  before  the  Project  will  expose  the  project \nagencies to ADB procedures and support them in project start-up activities including recruitment \nof project consultants and preparation of initial contracts.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  governments  of  the  participating  countries \n106. \nhave given the following assurances which are incorporated in the legal agreements subject to \nany amendment to be mutually agreed by the participating governments and ADB. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25 \n\n(i) \n\nThe governments of the participating countries will ensure that the Sustainable Heritage \nand Tourism Action Plan (Appendix 4) will be implemented.  \n\n(ii)  The  governments  of  the  participating  countries  will  ensure  that  sufficient  funds  will  be \nprovided to meet any shortfall between the cost of and revenues for the operation and \nmaintenance of the assets created under the Project.  \n\n(iii)  The governments of the participating countries will ensure that all land and right-of-way \nrequired for the Project are made available in a timely manner; adequate compensations \nare  provided  prior  to  the  signing  of  relevant  civil  works  contracts;  and  involuntary \nresettlement  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  plans  and  resettlement \nframeworks  agreed  upon  between  the  governments  and  ADB,  the  national  policies  on \nresettlement  and  land  acquisition  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995). \nUpdated and all new resettlement plans will be submitted for each subproject to ADB for \nreview and approval following detailed design and prior to award of civil contracts.  \n(iv)  The  governments  of  the  participating  countries  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  not \nnegatively  impact  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  indigenous  peoples.  In  the  event  of  their \ninvolvement in any of the subprojects, the governments of the participating countries will \nensure that the subprojects comply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n(v)  The  governments  of  the  participating  countries  will  ensure  that  the  Project  considers \ngender issues at all appropriate stages of the Project particularly during design, and that \nthe  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment (1998). \n\n(vi)   The governments of the participating countries will ensure that (a) the Project is carried \nout in accordance with the project design, and construction and operations comply with \napplicable national and local environmental laws and ADB's Environment Policy (2002); \n(b)  the  EARP  prepared  for  subprojects  in  Bangladesh  will  be  followed  to  guide \nenvironmental  assessment  during \nimpact \nassessment  will  be  undertaken  prior  to  award  of  civil  works  contracts;  (d)  the  relevant \nenvironmental mitigation measures specified in the EMP are incorporated in tender and \nbidding  documents;  (e)  civil  works  contractor's  specifications  include  requirements  to \ncomply with the environmental mitigation measures contained in the EMP; (f) civil work \ncontractors  are  closely  supervised  to  ensure  proper  implementation  of  mitigation  and \nmanagement  measures;  (g)  project  environmental  performance  is  monitored;  and  (h) \nmonitoring reports describing the progress in implementing the applicable environmental \nmitigation measures are submitted annually. \n\n(c)  archaeological \n\nimplementation; \n\n(vi)  The  governments  of  participating  countries  will  ensure  that  (a)  bidding  documents \ninclude  specific  provisions  to  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  will  comply  with  core \nlabor  standards  and  labor  laws  and  (b)  civil  works  contractors  will  disseminate \ninformation on sexually transmitted diseases including HIV to their employees and local \ncommunities surrounding the subproject sites. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness  \n\n \nB. \n \n107.  Apart  from  regular  conditions  to  loan  effectiveness,  the  loan  and  the  grant  to  Nepal \nbecome  effective  only  on  condition  (i)  that  the  Project  Agreements  with  CAAN  and  LDT  have \nbecome legally binding on CAAN and LDT, and (ii) that the loan agreement between the OPEC \nFund for International Development and Nepal has become effective. \n \nC. \n  \n108.  Nepal cannot make any withdrawals from the loan account and the grant account until it \nhas furnished a copy of its subsidiary financing agreement with CAAN, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB.     \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n109. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 8,234,000 to Nepal \nfor  the  South  Asia  Tourism  Infrastructure  Development  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter;

It  has  a  rich \ndiversity  of  ethnic  groups  with  distinctive  lifestyles.  The  region  is  also  the  Buddhist  heartland, \nwith  many  of  the  world\u2019s  major  Buddhist  sites,  including  ancient  monasteries  and  sacred \nlandscapes  associated  with  the  life  of  Buddha.  The  region's  rich  and  unique  endowments \nposition it as a world destination for nature and culture-based tourism.  \n \n2. \nIn  2001,  a  tourism  working  group  (TWG)  was  formed  comprising  Nepal,  India,  Bhutan, \nand Bangladesh under the SASEC Program. The TWG was expanded in 2005 with participation \nof  Sri  Lanka.  The  TWG  has  recognizes  that  complementary  natural  and  cultural  endowments \nprovide  an  opportunity  for  regional  cooperation  in  tourism,  which  can  lead  to  joint  product \ndevelopment  and  marketing  with  resulting  enhanced  subregional \ntourism.  With  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  support,  it  developed  and  adopted  a  regional  Tourism  Strategy1  \nproviding  a  framework  for  cooperation  in  tourism.  The  strategy  is  based  on  the  principle  that \ntourism  should  be  environmentally  and  culturally  sustainable  and  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction. \u201cBuddhist circuits\u201d and \u201cecotourism based on nature and culture\u201d are identified as the \nprimary  themes  of  tourism  development.  Recently  the  TWG  perceived  the  need  for  joint \ndevelopment  of  tourism  infrastructure  and  requested  ADB  support.  ADB  provided  regional \ntechnical assistance (TA)2 to help prepare an investment project.  \n \nB. \n  \n3. \nAsia  accounts  for  almost  20%  of  global  international  tourists  with  an  estimated  170 \nmillion  arrivals  in  2006.  During  1995\u20132006,  South  Asian  countries\u2019  tourist  arrivals  grew  at  an \nannual average of 8%, outperforming many regions of the world and reaching almost double the \nglobal  average  of  4.8%.  The  United  Nations  World  Tourism  Organization  forecasts  that  the \nSouth Asian countries will receive almost 15 million international visitors by 2020. In 2007, total \ninternational  arrivals  to  Nepal,  India,  and  Bangladesh  were  around  5.7  million,  representing  a \n73%  increase  from  2000;  tourism  earnings  from  international  visitors  in  the  three  project \ncountries  (including  all  of  India)  totaled  $12.3  billion,  representing  a  150%  increase  from  the \nearnings of 2003. India has fuelled the growth. International arrivals to Bangladesh and Nepal \nhave fluctuated during 2000\u20132006; however demand improved in both countries in 2007 with an \nestimated increase in arrivals of at least 6% in Bangladesh and 20% in Nepal. \n \nC. \n \nDuring  the  eighth  meeting  of  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation \n4. \n(SASEC) TWG in July 2007, TWG representatives considered tourism development priorities in \nthe  subregion  and  the  overlap  of  national  tourism  development  agendas.  Adopting  India\u2019s \napproach  of  using  tourism  circuit  as  a  tool  for  expanding  current  tourism  patterns  and \ncoordinated development and marketing, the TWG conceived a broad pattern for the future of \n\nSouth Asia Tourism Circuits and Infrastructure Vision \n\nSouth Asia Tourism Patterns and Prospects \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2008.

The  potential subregional circuits  (multicountry  circuits)  were  identified  on \nthe basis of current and projected demand and flows of tourism, and the envisaged connectivity \nand destination enhancements in the subregion. A multicountry circuit was defined as a route on \nwhich  more  than  one  or  two  major  destinations  are  located  in  more  than  one  country.  In  this \nway,  a  tourist  who  enters  to  a  destination  in  one  country  would  be  motivated  to  visit  other \ndestinations in the same route located in another country, hence resulting in increased arrivals \nto all destinations in more than one country. The future pattern of tourism in the subregion thus \nenvisages  a  number  of  multicountry  circuits  of  nature  and  culture-based  sites  and  Buddhist \ncircuits that are interlinked. \n \n\nFigure A2.1: Future Tourism Pattern in South Asia \n\n \n\nIndia and Nepal tourism become intertwined at Lumbini where the \u201cFootsteps of \nLord Buddha\u201d circuit (1) meets a proposed \u201cNepal ecotourism road\u201d circuit (2).  \n\nBagdogra  in  India  becomes  not  only  an  air  gateway  for  expansion  of  India\u2019s \ntourism circuit development patterns into the northeastern states, but also a hub \nfor a \u201cnorth east Himalaya\u201d circuit (3), linking the Himalayan culture, trekking, and \nadventure destinations of Sikkim and Bhutan.  \n\nIn Bangladesh, a \u201cHeritage Highway\u201d concept creates a new international circuit \n(4)  with  West  Bengal.  A  former  \u201cBhutan-India\u201d  (5)  circuit  is  restored,  providing \nroad linkage from Bhutan to Assam\u2019s air hub at Guwahati.  \n\nAlso linking India and Bangladesh, a \u201cBrahmaputra river cruise\u201d circuit (6) to be \ncreated by extending the current Assam cruise pattern down to the sea.  \n\nAs a ribbon running east\u2013west along the northern boundary of the subregion, the \n\u201cgreater  Himalayan  trail\u201d  circuit  (7)  spreads  trekking  to  the  entire  length  of  the \nHimalaya linking remote areas of Nepal, India, and Bhutan.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f      Appendix 2 \n\n33 \n\n(vi) \n\nSri Lanka\u2019s established \u201ccultural triangle\u201d circuit (8) in the central region, and the \nproposed  \u201csouthern  ecotourism  triangle\u201d  circuit  (9)  link  wildlife,  ecotourism,  and \nsignificant Buddhist attractions. \n\n \nThe  Vision  also  provides  a  prioritization  of  the  circuits  based  on  criteria:  (i)  market \n5. \ndemand, (ii) contribution to national and more importantly to subregional tourism development, \nand (iii) potential for inclusive tourism growth. The market demand criterion refers to the type of \ndemand  relevant  to  the  theme  of  nature  and  culture-based  tourism  and  Buddhist  circuits  with \nstrong  appeal  to  target regional  and  international  markets.  Contribution  to  subregional  tourism \ndevelopment takes into account the extent to which the circuit is likely to influence incremental \ntourism  benefits  at  national  and  subregional  levels.  Higher  ranked  circuits  are  those  that  are \nlikely to generate additional benefits in two or  more countries. Contribution to national tourism \ndevelopment priorities relates to the level of importance given by the countries and their private \nsector ascertained through discussions and a review of relevant policies and plans. The criteria \nfor  inclusive  growth  are  factored  through  (i)  prioritizing  circuits  in  high  poverty  areas,  (ii)  the \nfocus  on  nature  and  culture-based  tourism  with  greatest  potential  to  expand  the  prevailing \ntourism patterns, and (iii) taking into account the national priorities that all aim to use tourism as \na  tool  for  poverty  reduction.  Special  attention  is  given  to  links  between  Buddhist  circuits  and \nnature  and  culture-based  destinations,  and  seeking  opportunities  to  develop  ecotourism  near \nBuddhist sites or to extend Buddhist circuits to include natural and cultural destinations. The aim \nis to consolidate the appeal of tourism products and to expand the subregion\u2019s appeal to new \nmarkets. \n\nTable A2.1: Subregional Tourism Circuits and Their Ranking \n\n \n \n \nCircuit \nCircuit 1 Footsteps of Lord Buddha \n\n \n \nMarket \nDemand\n3 \n\nContribution to \nSubregional \nTourism \nDevelopment \n3 \n\n \n \nTotal \nScores \n14 \n\n \n \nPriority \nRanking\n1 \n\nCircuit 7 Great Himalaya Trail \n\nCircuit 3 North East Himalaya \n\nCircuit  4  Bangladesh  India  Heritage \nHighway \nCircuit 5 Bhutan-India \nCircuit  8  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Cultural \nTriangle \nCircuit 2 Nepal Ecotourism Road \nCircuit 6 Brahmaputra River Cruise \n\n3 \n\n2 \n\n2 \n\n2 \n3 \n\n2 \n2 \n\n3 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n1 \n\n2 \n2 \n\nContribution to \nNational Priorities \nfor Tourism \nDevelopment \n3 \u2013 Nepal; 3 \u2013 India; 1 \n\u2013 SL; 1 \u2013 Bhutan \n2 \u2013 Bhutan; 3 \u2013 \nNepal; 2 \u2013 India \n3 \u2013 India; 2 - Bhutan; \n1 \u2013 Nepal; 1 \u2013 \nBangladesh \n3 \u2013 Bangladesh; 1 \u2013 \nIndia \n2 \u2013 Bhutan; 2 - India \n3 - SL \n \n2 \u2013 Nepal; 1 - India \n1 \u2013 Bangladesh; 2 \u2013 \nIndia \n3 \u2013 SL \n\n13 \n\n11 \n\n9 \n\n9 \n7 \n\n7 \n7 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\nCircuit  9  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Southern \nEcotourism Triangle \n \n6. \nThe  South  Asia  tourism  circuits  and  infrastructure  vision  also  broadly  provides  the \ninvestment  requirements  along  the  circuits  based  on  an  assessment  of  gaps,  needs,  and \ndemands,  and  investment  prospects  undertaken  through  consultations  with  governments,  the \ntourism industry, and communities.

Activities are classified as \ninfrastructure;  destination  amenities;  or  capacity  building.  The  access \neither:  access \nincludes \ninfrastructure  components  are  airports  or \nenvironmental  and  visitor  infrastructure  and  services  and  site  presentation.  Capacity  building \ninvolves building capacity in (i) communities to participate in tourism and (ii) sector agencies to \nbetter develop and manage the heritage sites, infrastructure, and tourism. The broad estimates \nsuggest that the overall cost of integrated packages of investments is about $300 million. \n \n8. \nThe  Project  forms  part  of  the  South  Asia  tourism  circuits  and  infrastructure  vision.  It \ninvolves  integrated  development  of  high-priority  infrastructure  and  services  and  management \nimprovements in high potential multicountry circuits. Specifically, it includes investments in the \n(i) Nepal portion of the Footsteps of the Lord Buddha circuit cutting across India and Nepal, and \ncombining Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha with the Buddhist sites of Uttar Pradesh state \nof  India;  (ii)  the  Sikkim  State  of  India  which  is  a  premier  nature  and  culture-based  tourism \ndestination and  Buddhist  site  that  forms  part  of  the  greater  Himalayan  trail  circuit, and  (iii)  the \nBangladesh portion of the heritage highway with key cultural heritage sites along a corridor in \nthe  western  regions  of  Bangladesh  with  established  tourist  flows  from  south  to  north  in  West \nBengal of India. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nBuddhist Circuit of Nepal\u2014Lumbini. The Footsteps of the Lord Buddha circuit is the \njewel in the crown of Buddhist circuits that justifies the \u201cBuddhist heartland\" label. The sites in \nthe  Indian  portion  of  the  circuit  are  currently  developed  by  the  Government  of  India  with \nassistance of Japan Bank for International Cooperation. In the Nepal part, Lumbini is the most \npopular attraction and the icon of the Buddhist heartland. Lumbini\u2019s importance stems from the \nSacred Garden that includes the birthplace of Buddha and related archaeological remains and \nstructures  e.g.,  the  Maya  Devi  temple,  Ashokan  pillar,  Nativity  sculpture,  Puskarini  pond,  and \nthe  Marker  Stone  which  authenticates  the  exact  spot  where  Buddha  was  born.  The  Sacred \nGarden was declared as a World Heritage site in 1997 in recognition of its outstanding universal \nvalue.  The  Lumbini  Development  Area  covers,  in  addition  to  the  Sacred  Garden,  two  other \nzones  of  (i) a  monastic enclave  and  (ii)  a  cultural  and  administrative  center  with  museum  and \ntourist  information  center  and  other  facilities.  In  addition,  nine  important  Buddhist  sites  are \nlocated  around  Lumbini  Development  Area  each  with  values  for  pilgrimage,  sightseeing,  and \nhistorical and archeological features.  \n  \n10. \nAnnual  arrivals  to  Lumbini  are  estimated  to  be  around  0.5  million,  including  71,000 \ninternational  tourists  from  85  countries.  Current  key  markets  include  Buddhist  pilgrims  and \nreligious sightseeing segments from South Asia, Japan, People's Republic of China, Republic of \nKorea,  Thailand,  and  some  western  countries.  As  a  cornerstone  Buddhist  attraction,  Lumbini \nhas great potential for strong growth in tourism demand. However, its potential is constrained by \nseveral factors that are also the reasons for the current short stay and consequent low spending \nby visitors. \n \n11. \nInadequate  Connectivity.  One  of  the  limitations  of  Lumbini  is  its  remoteness  and \ninadequate connectivity. Currently no direct air links are available to Lumbini from key regional \n\nAnalysis of the Nepal Portion of the Footsteps of the Lord Buddha Circuit  \n\n \n\n\f      Appendix 2 \n\n35 \n\nand  international  visitor  markets;  Current  air  access  is  through  Kathmandu  only.  There  is  an \nurgent need to upgrade the Gautam Buddha airport in Bhairahawa (0.5 hour drive from Lumbini) \nto improve access to Lumbini from other airports such as Colombo, Dhaka, Paro, and open up \nlinks to key Southeast Asian and global markets. Such air link will also help link several national \necotourism  circuits  to  this  regional  Buddhist  circuit  hence  help  spread  the  benefits  to  a  wider \ncommunity.     \n \n12. \nInadequate On-Site Infrastructure and Facilities. Lumbini\u2019s development is guided by \na  master  plan  prepared  in  1978  to  provide  a  framework  for  reinforcing  the  site\u2019s  symbolic \nidentity  by  defining  the  land  use  patterns  and  requirements  for  infrastructure,  tourist  facilities \nand  services.  However,  many  of  the  master  plan\u2019s  proposals  have  not  been  implemented  to \ndate due to limited technical, financial, and institutional capacities, as well as the monumental \nnature  of  the  proposals  requiring  large-scale  financing.  The  inadequate  on-site  infrastructure \nand services are undermining the cultural value of Lumbini, while adversely affecting the visitor \nexperience. No water supply and toilet facilities are available to meet visitors\u2019 needs. The solid \nwaste management system is inadequate, with garbage collected being either burnt or buried. \nThe visitor center, currently serving in temporary structures, is hindering the proper presentation \nof  the  site\u2019s  outstanding  universal  value.  On-site  interpretation  including  displays  and  signage \nare  substandard.  Inadequate  landscaping  works,  e.g.,  unpaved  roads  and  lack  of  suitable \nplantation is a source of pollution and contradicts to the required ambience of the Buddha\u2019s birth \nplace.  Visitor  facilities  such  as  car  parking  and  pedestrian  walkways  around  the  visitor  center \nare insufficient. Lack of facilities in the site is also a major impediment to generating revenues \nfrom visitors. On-site infrastructure and services need to be improved urgently.   \n \nInstitutional  Issues.  The  related  institutional  structure  provides  a  good  framework  for \n13. \ncoordinated initiatives of various participants in tourism. The key agency responsible for tourism \nis the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation (MOTCA) which reflects the Government\u2019s policy to \npromote tourism and use air transport as an important driver of tourism. MOTCA undertakes its \nactivities  through  Nepal  Tourism  Board  and  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Nepal  (CAAN)  both \naffiliated to it. The Nepal Tourism Board is an autonomous entity in the form of a partnership of \nGovernment  and  the  tourism  industry,  and  responsible  for  marketing  and  promotion  and \nproviding  overall  policy  guidance.  Lumbini  Development  Trust  (LDT),  which  is  affiliated  to  the \nMinistry  of  Culture  and  State  Restructuring,  is  responsible  for  developing  and  managing  the \nLumbini  area  following  the  Lumbini  master  plan.  LDT  is  formed  as  a  Trust,  an  autonomous \nbody, demonstrating Government commitment to Lumbini\u2019s development. CAAN is responsible \nfor regulating air transport and civil aviation, developing and operating airports, and overseeing \nairline operations.    \n  \n14. \nHowever  these  agencies  need  strengthening  to  accomplish  their  mandate.  LDT's \ncapacity  needs  to  be  developed  for  it  to  effectively  perform  its  complex  duties  of  planning, \ndeveloping,  and  managing  Lumbini;  and  addressing  visitor  demands  while  safeguarding  the \nconservation  of  the  Sacred  Garden.  The  sustainable  management  of  Lumbini  also  requires \nadequate  and  sustainable  revenues \nits  development,  conservation,  and \nmanagement. There is need to enhance financial management and increase revenues of LDT.  \n \nThe current master plan of Lumbini is more than 2 decades old; it was prepared before \n15. \nthe Sacred Garden was inscribed in the World Heritage list. Preparation of a management plan \nfor the Sacred Garden is considered an urgent need to protect the outstanding universal value \nof  the  World  Heritage  site  as  an  effective  management  tool.  In  parallel,  the  master  plan \n(covering  a  larger  area)  needs  to  be  reviewed  and  updated  to  address  the  multidimensional \nneeds  of  the  site  in  visitor  services,  conservation,  environmental  management;  and  to  adopt \nstrategies for financing and resource mobilization based on contemporary best practices.  \n\nfinancing \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36         Appendix 2 \n \n\nAnalysis of Sikkim (Northeast Himalaya Circuit) of India  \n\n \n16. \nSimilarly,  investments  in  airport  development  have  to  be  accompanied  with  support  for \nCAAN's  institutional  development  in  line  with  the  objectives  of  Nepal\u2019s  civil  aviation  strategy. \nManagement  skills  and  capacity,  business  orientation,  and  corporate  planning  within  CAAN \nneed to be enhanced with specific focus on the Gautam Buddha airport management.  \n \n17. \nLimited Community Engagement in Heritage Management and Tourism. The long-\nterm  conservation  and  sustainability  of  Lumbini  cannot  be  achieved  without  engaging \ncommunities living in its vicinity. The socioeconomic status of surrounding communities is weak \nand  the  benefits  from  Lumbini  to  these  communities  are  limited.  In  the  absence  of  tangible \nlinkages between Lumbini and its communities, most local inhabitants are indifferent or ignorant \nof  the  concept  of  conservation  of  Lumbini  and  tourism  growth.  It  is  essential  to  raise  the \nawareness of communities in conserving Lumbini, enhancing the attractiveness of the site, and \nthe associated benefits from tourism while creating economic opportunities for them.  \n \nE. \n \n18. \nSikkim\u2019s Heritage Tourism. Sikkim is strategically located at the geographic center of \nthe  region.  It  is  part  of  the  greater  Himalayan  trail  circuit  and  the  Northeast  Himalaya  circuit \n(para. 4). It has a good road connection to Bagdogra, a site of an airport, which is soon to be \nupgraded to a regional airport by the Government of India. Bagdogra is the major air node and a \nregional  hub  with  potential  links  to  Bangladesh  cultural  heritage  highway  circuit,  east  Nepal, \nBhutan,  and  other  northeastern  states.  Sikkim  has  107  monasteries,  four  sacred  caves,  the \ntallest  statue  of  Guru  Rinpoche,  and  29  sacred  lakes.  It  is  one  of  India\u2019s  premier  nature  and \nculture-based  tourism  destinations  and  has  been  successful  in  attracting  high-yield  domestic \nsegments  as  well  as  international  trekkers,  pilgrims,  and  nature-based  adventure  enthusiasts. \nFrom  2002  to  2006  Sikkim  experienced  32%  annual  average  growth  in  foreign  arrivals.  The \nmain  generating  markets  are  United  States,  United  Kingdom,  Germany,  France,  and  Japan. \nProvisional  figures  from  the  state  government  of  Sikkim  indicate  that  arrivals  in  2007  totaled \n17,500 persons. Industry estimates show that about 12,000 of these tourists go trekking in West \nSikkim and around 9,000 visit the \u201cmust-see\u201d Buddhist monastery of Rumtek near Gangtok. The \nplanned  upgrading  of Bagdogra  airport  and  development  of  a  domestic  airport  in Gangtok  will \nincrease the appeal of Sikkim for international and regional travelers, and strengthen its role in \nsubregional tourism development.  \n \n19. \nGovernment  Policy.  The  state  government  of  Sikkim  identifies  nature-based  tourism, \nas  a  \u201cthrust  industry,\u201d  demonstrating  its  commitment  and  high  priority  attached  to  tourism \ndevelopment.  The  Department  of  Tourism  is  the  key  state  agency  for  tourism  development; \nthrough  planning,  policy  making,  regulation,  and  where  necessary  undertaking  tourism \ninfrastructure development. The Sikkim Tourism Development Corporation, established in 1999, \nprovides and manages tourist facilities and services such as hotel accommodation, restaurants, \nand  the  Gangtok\u2013Bagdogra  helicopter  service.  The  20-year  perspective  plan  of  Sikkim  for \nSustainable  Tourism  Development  aims  to  sustain  Sikkim\u2019s  position  as  a  premier  nature  and \nculture-based tourism destination in India. Policy objectives relevant to sustainable tourism are \nalso set out with more focus on making tourism the state\u2019s core competency sector and decisive \nsource  of  employment  and  income  generation  for  the  benefit  of  local  residents.  While  nature-\nbased  tourism  is  seen  as  the  key  driver,  the  state  also  aspires  to  be  a  major  destination  for \nBuddhist tourism, ethnic culture, and adventure tourism in India by 2022. The state realizes that \nthe existing poor access and destination infrastructure constraints tourism development. \n  \n20. \nRumtek  Monastery  Circuit.  The  Rumtek  monastery  is  one  of  the  international \nheadquarters of the Kagyupa sect of Tibetan Buddhism and a well-known monastery located 24 \n\n \n\n\f      Appendix 2 \n\n37 \n\nkm from Gangtok within a forest setting. The monastery is home to a large community of monks, \nand contains the Golden Stupa as well as an institute for higher Buddhist studies. The original \nmonastery,  built  in  the  16th  century,  is  located  very  close  to  the  Rumtek  monastery  and  has \nunique  architecture;  it  contains  valuable  manuscripts  and  Buddhist  heritage  artifacts.  The \nRumtek  monastery  receives  an  estimated  5,000  visitors  per  day  during  the  peak  season,  and \nhas  potential  for  growth  in  visitor  numbers.  However,  the  potential  of  the  monastery  to \naccommodate increased numbers of visitors and to sustain its cultural value and environmental \nquality  is  constrained  by  several  factors.  A  major  constraint  is  inadequate  traffic  management \naround the monastery. No organized car parking is available; and the high congestion creates a \ncontrast  to  the  serenity  of  Rumtek.  Water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management  facilities \nare inadequate in the monastery complex. The complex lacks on-site interpretation material and \na  visitor  information  center  required  to  enhance  the  awareness  of  visitors  on  the  cultural  and \nspiritual  value  of  the  site.  There  is  need  to  provide  the  key  environmental  and  visitor \ninfrastructure. There is also need for developing facade regulations and a guiding framework for \nfuture  development  within  and  outside  the  complex  to  prevent  the  adverse  affects  of \nunregulated development on the authenticity and integrity of the monastery. \n \n21. \nSeveral  other  key  attractions  are  located  in  the  vicinity  of  Rumtek,  including  Lingdum \nMonastery  and  Ban  Jakhri  Falls,  which  are  positioned  on  a  potential  circuit  road  connecting \nGangtok\u2013Rumtek  Monastry  off  NH31A  above  Ranipool\u2013Sajong  (Lingdum  monastry  and  Ban \nJakhri  Falls)-Gangtok.  In  addition,  the  road  from  Gangtok  to  Rumtek  passes  through  highly \nscenic  landscape  such  as  Shanti  and  Rey  Khola  providing  opportunities  to  develop  rest  stop \nand scenic viewing areas and short walking trails that could help visitors to explore the natural \nenvironment  of  Rumtek  and  its  vicinity.  However  due  to  poor  road  conditions  and  supporting \ntourist infrastructure, these places are currently bypassed by current visitor flows. There is great \npotential to expand tourist flows to cover these areas, by improving the access and developing \nrest stops, scenic viewing stations, and waterfront areas.    \n \nSeveral  villages  are  located  along  the  Rumtek  monastery  circuit.  In  the  absence  of \n22. \nadequate  linkages,  benefits  from  enhanced  tourism  in  the  Rumtek  monastery  circuit  to  these \ncommunities remain suboptimal. For example, Rey Mindu, a Lepcha village, located along the \nSadong\u2013Lingdum\u2013Gangtok road, has a unique traditional character and is the starting point of a \ntrek  leading  into  the  Flambanglo  wildlife  sanctuary.  The  village  has  significant  potential  for \nheritage and ecotourism development. However, basic environmental and tourist infrastructure \nalong with community capacity building are needed to link these villages to the major circuits.  \n \nNature and Culture-Based Tourism in the Himalayas in West Sikkim. About 50% of \n23. \ninternational  visitors  to  Sikkim  go  trekking  in  West  Sikkim.  The  region  has  spectacular  and \npicturesque nature, and is home to world famous Kanchendzonga national park with hundreds \nof  species  of  flora  and  fauna.  West  Sikkim,  where  the  first  capital  of  Sikkim\u2014Yuksam\u2014is \nlocated  is  also  the  birthplace  of  the  history  and  culture  of  Sikkim.  Yuksam  is  the  starting  and \ncompletion  point  for  a  number  of  treks  mainly  into  Kanchendzonga  National  Park  (to  Dzongri, \nGoechala) and to nearby monasteries, and lakes. Some of the oldest monasteries of Sikkim\u2014\nDubdi, Pemayangste, and Tashiding\u2014are in West Sikkim and form part of the Coronation Trail \nstarting  from  Yuksam.  Yuksam  and  West  Sikkim  trails  are  part  of  the  greater  Himalayan  trail \ncircuit and offer immense scope to spread tourism benefits to remote communities.  \n \n24. \nDuring  the  peak  season,  more  than  200  trekkers  and  campers  everyday  start  their \njourneys  from  Yuksam,  where  all  the  supplies,  porters,  and  guides,  serving  the  trekkers,  are \nbased.  However,  the  facilities  in  Yuksam  are  limited  to  meet  the  tourist  needs  and  ensure \nenvironmental  sustainability.  There  is  need  for  developing    a  proper  campsite  with  facilities, \nincluding toilets, kitchen, solid waste management facilities, porter shelters, as well as a tourist \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38         Appendix 2 \n \n\ninformation  center,  and  administration  facilities  in  Yuksam.  Similarly  the  main  trekking  trails  in \nWest  Sikkim  are  poorly  developed,  resulting  in  safety  concerns.  Basic  amenities,  e.g.,  toilets, \nrest  areas,  and  on-trail  campsites  with  water  and  sanitation  are  absent.  Besides,  inadequate \ncommunity  awareness  and  mobilization,  and  local  skills  in  tourism  activities  and  heritage \nprotection  and  management  are  limiting  benefits  to  surrounding  villages.  Taken  together,  the \ndeteriorating  sanitary  conditions,  growing  environmental  impacts,  and  limited  community \ninvolvement pose risks to these assets that unless effectively addressed, could result in the loss \nof  the  assets  and  markets.  There  is  need  for  small-scale  infrastructure  and  along  select  trails \nsuch as stabilization of treks, sanitation and waste management facilities, footbridges, and signs \nalong with programs for community engagement in tourism.   \n \n25. \nSikkim  as  the  Venue  of  the  Himalayan  Training  Institute  for  Culture  and  Nature-\nBased Tourism. Demand is growing in India and the rest of South Asia for a training institute \ndelivering  courses  and  short-term  experiences  on  culture  and  nature-based \ntourism \ndevelopment  and  management  for  tourism  trainers,  public  and  private  sector  developers  and \nmanagers of tourism, tour operators and guides, and interested tourists. Currently, there is no \ninstitute  dedicated  to  nature  and  culture-based  tourism.  Such  an  institute  will  meet  the  critical \nneed for human resource development not only in India but the subregion where economies and \npeople\u2019s livelihood largely depend on culture and nature-based tourism. Sikkim, because of (i) \nits central location, (ii) being a key destination for nature and culture-based tourism, and (iii) its \ngood  record  on  sustainable  tourism,  provides  the  ideal  venue  for  a  subregional  institute  of \nexcellence.  \n \n26. \nRecognizing  the  need,  and  based  on  national  and  subregional  demand  for  such  an \ninstitute,  the  Government  of  India,  in  partnership  with  Sikkim  State,  has  already  initiated  a \nproject  to  develop  the  Himalayan  Training  Institute  for  nature  and  culture-based  tourism  in \nChemchey  in  South  Sikkim.  The  site  is  easily  accessible  from  Bagdogra,  and  is  about  80  km \nfrom  Gangtok.  A  helipad  is  available  at  a  distance  of  about  5  km  from  the  site,  enhancing  its \naccess  and  emergency  evacuation.  The  natural  scenery  around  the  site  comprises  valleys, \nmountains, and exotic flora and fauna providing the right environment for such an institute. The \nGovernment has already approved the construction of institute and funds to complete phases 1 \nand  2.  However,  the  institute  has  not  yet  been  operationalized  due  to  inadequate  funding  to \ncomplete  all  the  training  facilities  and  provide  furnishings  and  equipment.  There  is  need  to \ncomplete  the  construction  of  training  institute  and  develop  and  implement  a  business  plan  to \nenable full operation and sustainability of the institute.  \n \nA training institute specialized in nature and culture-based tourism is required under the \n27. \nlead  of  the  public  sector,  to  address  the  needs  for  (i)  ensuring  balance  between  tourism  and \nbiodiversity  conservation  in  highly  sensitive  alpine  areas;  (ii)  strengthening  the  planning, \ndevelopment  and  management  skills  of  the  public  sector  officials  to  ensure  that  nature  and \nculture-based  tourism  destinations  are  developed  on  a  sustainable  and  inclusive  basis;  (iii) \nincreasing  the  number  and  quality  of  trained  tourism  professionals  and  guides;  and  (iv) \ndeveloping  the  knowledge  of  the  private  sector  operators  and  community  tourism  service \nproviders for sustainable management of nature and culture-based tourism products.  \n \nSandruptkse, a place of pilgrimage importance, is located at about 10 km from the site of \n28. \nthe Institute. This contains a large statue of Guru Padma Sambhava, an 8th century monk, who \ntraveled  and  taught  in  Sikkim,  and  meditated  at  the  site.  The  work  for  the  statue  was \ninaugurated by the Dalai Lama. An annual festival is organized at the location on the occasion \nof Guru Padmasambhava\u2019s birthday on 10th day of the 6th month of the Tibetan calendar. Many \nvisitors,  especially  from  South  Asia  visit  this  place  which  is  also  considered  critical  for  the \nmeditation training element of the institute. However, the base of the statue is currently in poor \n\n \n\n\f      Appendix 2 \n\n39 \n\nAnalysis of Bangladesh Heritage Highway \n\nrepair. Water in the pools around the statue is seeping into the prayer hall below. There is need \nto repair structure of the statue, improve the site, and provide basic tourist amenities. \n \n29. \nVillage  Tourism.  The  sustainability  of  nature  and  culture-based  tourism  destinations \ncannot be achieved without engaging communities living around these sites. Similarly, benefits \nfrom growing tourism will not automatically be felt by the communities unless special efforts are \nmade  to  enable  their  participation  in  tourism.  It  is  essential  to  raise  the  awareness  of \ncommunities on the importance of protection of heritage sites and linkage between tourism and \nassociated benefits to communities. It is also critical to create economic opportunities for them \nby linking villages to major destinations, and capacity building and skill training of communities \non tourism-related activities building on the best practices that Sikkim has already developed.  \n \nF. \n \n30. \nCultural  Heritage  Endowments.  The  heritage  sites  along  the  Bangladesh  Heritage \nHighway  are  culturally  very  significant.  These include  Paharpur,  Kantajee,  Mahastangarh,  and \nBagerhat. Paharpur, a world heritage site, is the single largest Buddhist monastery built in the \n8th  century.  Kantajee  is  the  largest  Hindu  terracotta  temple  in  the  world.  Bagerhat,  another \nworld  heritage  site  is  a  mosque  complex  with  a  77  domed  mosque  and  eight  other  mosques \nnearby.  These  sites  are  the  most  popular  attractions,  and  offer  great  potential  for  inclusive \ndevelopment  by  spreading  tourism  benefits  more  widely.  Packaging  these  attractions  through \nan  innovative  concept  of  a  heritage  corridor  with  links  to  northern  and  eastern  India,  and \nimproving  their  access  and  site  conditions  together  with  marketing  will  lead  to  increasing \nnumbers  of  visitors  including  Indian  tourists,  cultural  and  special  interest  groups,  and  wider \ninternational and intraregional segments. \n \n31. \nHeritage  Site  Conditions.  These  sites  are  in  need  of  restoration  to  maintain  their \nuniversal  value.  The  lack  of  environmental  infrastructure  e.g.,  drainage  and  solid  waste \nmanagement is undermining the cultural value of the sites while adversely affecting the tourist \nexperience. Visitor facilities such as car parking, internal walkways, and toilets are inadequate \nto cope with demand. The absence of such facilities, causing uncontrolled tourist circulation in \nthe  sites,  further  contributes  to  degradation  of  the  assets. Site  presentations  are  substandard, \nlimiting  the  experience  of  visitors.  Nearby  communities  are  able  to  derive  a  minimal  livelihood \nfrom  the  sites  but  this  is  constrained  by  lack  of  infrastructure,  information,  and  skilled  people \nwho  can  get  involved  in  site  maintenance  and  management.  These  constraints  also  act  as \ndeterrence for the industry to invest and promote these sites.   \n \nInstitutional  and  Financial  Issues.  The  Government  first  recognized  tourism  as  an \n32. \nimportant industry with the framing of the National Tourism Policy in 1992. In 1999, tourism was \ndeclared  a  thrust  sector.  The  policy  recognizes  the  importance  of  cultural  heritage  as  the \nprimary  tourism  endowments.  The  Government  also  recently  issued  a  Cultural  policy  with \npreservation of the heritage assets as a core component. The Department of Archeology (DOA) \nis the lead agency for the management of heritage sites in Bangladesh. Other agencies involved \ninclude  the  Ministry  of  Tourism  through  its  Bangladesh  Parjatan  Corporation,  which  is \nresponsible for tourism promotion, provision of visitor information and accommodation services, \nand selected capacity development in tourism. The organizational functions of DOA are spread \nover  four  regional  directorates.  However,  delegation  is  limited,  and  financial  and  technical \npowers are rather centralized. The current staffing and skills are limited. A significant number of \npositions remain vacant, and staff incentives, e.g., promotions are inadequate. The pressure on \nthe staff in managing sites is tremendous, considering that Bangladesh has around 400 heritage \nsites.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40         Appendix 2 \n \n\nSustainability  of  heritage  sites  is  further  constrained  by  inadequate  maintenance \n33. \nbudgets. The average annual investment on cultural properties is Tk30,000 and repair budget is \nestimated  at  Tk10  million  ($150,000).  The  revenues  for  a  site  like  Paharpur  are  substantially \nbelow  its  cost  of  operation  and  maintenance.  The  primary  sources  of  income  for  heritage  site \nmanagement are visitor fees and income from lease rental and parking arrangements. But these \nare  low  when  compared  with  those  in  neighboring  countries  such  as  India.  Besides,  the \nrevenues  generated  from  the  cultural  heritage  sites  are  not  retained  by  DOA.  Sources  of \nincomes  need  to  be  increased  by  increasing  existing  tourist  fees  and  introducing  new  fees. \nDedicated funds need to be created for site management by exploring options to enable DOA to \nretain the revenues for the operation and maintenance of sites.   \n        \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR TOURISM IN ASIA \n\n \n\n \nProject \n\nYear \nApproved \n\n \nSource \n\nA.

Tourism  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  the  subregion \n2. \neconomies.  According  to  the  World  Travel  &  Tourism  Council,  the  tourism  industry\u2019s  direct \nimpact  on  the  economies  of  Bangladesh,  India,  and  Nepal  will  reach  a  combined  total  of  \n$29.5  billion,  equivalent  to  1.6%\u20133.1%  of  their  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  The  council \nindicates  that  tourism\u2019s  contribution  to  GDP  will  reach  4%  or  $6,385  million  by  2018  in \nBangladesh, 6.1% or $172 billion in India, and 8% or $1,173 million in Nepal. But to achieve or \neven surpass these forecasts, the governments will have to address constraints to the tourism \nindustry.  The  often-cited  tourism  development  bottlenecks  in  the  three  countries  include  (i) \ndifficulties  with  connectivity  and  access  to  the  sites,  (ii)  inadequate  infrastructure  and  visitor \nfacilities,  (iii)  insufficient  human  resources  and  trained  professional  staff,  (iv)  relatively  weak \nborder  crossing  infrastructure  and  systems,  (v)  inadequate  basic  infrastructure  such  as  water \nsupply and sanitation systems, and (vi) limited benefits to surrounding communities.  \n \n \n \nJustification  for  Government  Intervention  in  the  Sector.  Fostering  private  sector \n3. \nparticipation \ntourism  development  strategy. \nNonetheless,  airport  upgrading  and  the  provision  of  public  toilets,  public  footpaths,  drainage, \nand public information centres justify government intervention for the following reasons: (i) many \nof  the  services  required  are  natural  monopolies  usually  unsuited  to  private  investment  and \nhence,  justify  government  intervention  at  least  in  regulation;  (ii)  environmental  protection  and \nsanitation  improvement  provide  public  goods  such  as  a  hygienic  and  flood-free  environment, \nand  prevent  negative  situations  arising  from  pollution;  and  (iii)  poverty  reduction  programs \nminimize  the  inefficiencies  of  economic  growth.  The  economic  rationale  for  government \nintervention is, therefore, sound. \n \n \n \n4. \nDuring  1995\u20132006,  tourist  arrivals  of  member  countries  of  the  South  Asia  Subregional \nEconomic  Cooperation  grew  at  an  annual  average  of  8%,  outperforming  many  regions  of  the \nworld  and  reaching  almost  double  the  global  average  of  4.8%.  The  United  Nations  World \nTourism Organization forecasts that these countries will receive almost 15 million international \nvisitors  by  2020.  However,  demand  forecasts  show  that  without  the  Project,  growth  will  be \nlower, or worse, demand for tourism in the subproject areas will gradually decline because of (i) \nthe diminishing attractiveness of the sites due to major physical constraints that will worsen over \n\nDemand Analysis \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n1   Tun Lin and F.D. de Guzman. 2007.

To arrive at \ndemand forecasts for each of the subprojects, surveys of tourist arrivals, duration of stay, and \naverage spending in the destination sites were conducted with assistance from the local tourism \noffices in each participating country.  \n \n \n \n \n \nIn  calculating  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  subprojects,  the \n5. \nestimated  costs  and  benefits  were  valued  at  their  economic  prices  using  the  world  price \nnumeraire. The standard conversion factors used were taken from recent ADB studies on South \nAsia  of  a  similar  nature5  and  confirmed  using  available  import  and  export  data  from  each \ncountry.  The  conversion  factors  used  were  as  follows:  Bangladesh  (0.90);  India  (0.91),  and \nNepal (0.89). The economic costs do not include applicable taxes and duties, and are based on \npreliminary engineering designs and estimates prepared for the subprojects.  \n   \n \n \n6. \nIncremental  Tourism  Benefits.  Tourism  benefits  from  subprojects  were  calculated \nbased on the increased (i) number of passenger or tourist arrivals as a result of the subprojects, \n(ii)  length  of  tourist  stays  in  the  area,  and  (iii)  amount  of  spending  by  tourists.  The  following \nincome  multipliers  were  applied:  Bangladesh  (0.63),  India  (0.93),  and  Nepal  (0.76).6  The \ndemand  surveys  conducted  indicate  that  as  a  result  of  the  subprojects,  average  daily  tourism \nspending will increase. Based on the increase estimated for each destination site, average daily \ntourism benefits were determined taking into account the substitution effect.7   \n \n7. \nIncremental  Airport  Benefits.  Using  projected  incremental  passenger  arrivals  and \naircraft  movements,  passenger  and  landing  fees  for  relevant  subprojects  were  calculated  and \nconverted  into  economic  benefits  by  applying  the  appropriate  standard  conversion  factors. \nAdditional  benefits  such  as  airport  revenues  from  parking  facilities  and  cargo  services  were \ncomputed at 5% of the total incremental tourism and airport benefits.  \n \n \n \n8. \nOther Benefits. The analysis did not quantify other benefits that were difficult to value \ndue  to  lack  of  data  or  the  potential  for  double  counting.  These  nonquantified  benefits  include \n(i) aircraft operating cost savings, (ii) increased public health due to improved water supply and \nsanitation  facilities  in  the  site,  and  (iii)  access  to  increased  employment  and  livelihood \nopportunities in the communities surrounding the destination sites.    \n \n\nNonquantified Economic Benefits \n\nc. \n\n \n\nd. \n\n \n \n9. \nThe  results  of  the  EIRR  calculation  and  sensitivity  analysis  are  summarized  in  Table \nA9.1.

The results of the sensitivity analysis show that \nthe  EIRRs  are  highly  sensitive  to  a  reduction  or  a  delay  in  benefits.  To  address  this  risk, \nsubprojects  were  selected  using  a  set  of  criteria  that  emphasized  both  contribution  to \nsubregional  and  national  tourism  development.  The  Project  is  also  designed  to  support  the \nparticipating  governments\u2019  coordinated  marketing  and  promotion  programs  for  the  proposed \ncircuits.   \n \n\nTable A9.1: Summary of Economic Internal Rates of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n\nBase Case/Sensitivity Scenarios\n\nEconomic Cost\n($'000)\n\nNet Present Value\n\n($'000)\n\nBase Case EIRR (%)\nSensitivity Tests:\nCase 1:  Capital Cost + 10% \nEIRR (%)\nSwitching Value\nSensitivity Indicator\n\nCase 2:  Benefits - 10% \n\nEIRR (%)\nSwitching Value\nSensitivity Indicator\n\nCase 3:  1, 2 & O&M+10%\n\nEIRR (%)\nNPV ($'000)\n% Drop in NPV\nCase 4:  Benefits delayed by 1 yr\n\nEIRR (%)\nNPV ($'000)\n% Change in NPV\n\nSubproject\n\nLumbini\nPaharpur\nHeritage Site\nHeritage Site\nBhairahawa\nImprovements Airport Upgrading Improvements\n\nSikkim \nImprovements\n\nProject\n\n1,565.00\n\n20,807.00\n\n2,663.00\n\n17,576.00\n\n42,611.00\n\n2,365.00\n\n25,919.00\n\n6,370.00\n\n42,183.00\n\n73,993.00\n\n    30.72\n\n     23.76\n\n   34.69\n\n      33.21\n\n     28.27\n\n    28.53\n    85.40\n      1.17\n\n     28.08\n    71.10\n      1.41\n\n    25.87\n1,843.00\n    22.08\n\n   16.07\n 741.00\n   68.68\n\n     22.43\n      88.51\n      1.13\n\n      22.25\n      77.76\n        1.29\n\n     20.93\n19,917.00\n     23.16\n\n      21.05\n21,295.00\n      17.84\n\n  32.54\n105.18\n    0.95\n\n    31.94\n    82.52\n       1.21\n\n    26.62\n5,158.00\n    19.03\n\n     19.30\n2,858.00\n    55.14\n\n       31.22\n      106.70\n         0.94\n\n      30.88\n      91.04\n        1.10\n\n       28.91\n34,889.00\n       27.43\n\n       20.02\n21,783.00\n       98.70\n\n     26.64\n     99.90\n      1.00\n\n     26.37\n     85.63\n       1.17\n\n      24.73\n59,247.00\n      19.92\n\n      24.42\n62,057.00\n      16.12\n\n \n\nEIRR  =  economic  internal  rate  of  return;  NPV  =  net  present  value;  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance;  NPV  =  net \npresent value. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \n5.  \n\nBenefit Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n\n11. \nA  distribution  analysis  of  the  quantified  benefits  from  the  Project  was  conducted.  India \nwill  gain  most  from  the  Project  with  an  estimated  $52.2  million  in  net  benefits.  Nepal  will  gain \napproximately  $39.1  million,  while  the  net  benefit  to  Bangladesh  will  be  about  $16.1  million. \nThese results reflect findings that the economic impact of tourism, as measured by its income \nmultiplier,  is  highest  in  India,  followed  by  Nepal  (para.  6).9  The  net  benefit  to  Bangladesh  is \nsmallest due to its lower income multiplier, which can be traced, in part, to the relatively limited \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003.

Skills  development  to  be  carried  out  in  each  participating \ncountry will increase employment and livelihood opportunities particularly for those likely to be \nengaged in hospitality, guesthouse and small hotel services, food and beverages, handicrafts, \nlocal \ninterpretation,  and  other  microenterprise \nendeavors.

The \nfinancial  assessment  established  that  all  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  the \nbasic financial reporting, internal controls, and audit systems for the Project. Capacities will be \nstrengthened  under  the  Project  by  training  executing  and  implementing  agency  staff  in  each \ncountry  on  accounting,  budgeting,  financial  information  management,  reporting,  and  use  of \ninformation technology.  \n \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\n2. \n\n \n\nIndicative Financial Improvement Action Plans \n\n14. \nThe  Government  of  Bangladesh  has  decided  on  the  following  action  agenda:  (i) \ncomplete  filling  of  key  vacancies,  and  prepare  and  start  implementation  of  an  action  plan  to \ninduct staff by December 2009; (ii) prepare an action plan and begin implementation to increase \nincome  from  various  sources  including  entrance  fees,  user  charges  for  facilities,  parking  fees, \nconcession  fees,  and  sale  of  interpretative  materials  to  generate  sufficient  funds  to  gradually \nmeet  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  the  sites  by  June  2012;  and  (iv)  devise  a \nfeasible  mechanism  to  allow  revenues  generated  from  the  sites  to  be  used  for  O&M,  while \nimplementing a rational policy to support sites with lower revenue realization by June 2012.   \n \n15. \nThe  Sikkim  state  government  has  decided  to  (i)  assess  the  feasibility,  and  start \nimplementation of a strategy for separately accounting and managing revenues for nature- and \nculture-based  tourism  by  June  2012;  and  (ii)  develop  and  start  implementing  a  financial \nimprovement action plan involving enhanced ecotourism service fees, other fees and charges to \nmeet O&M costs of the Rumtek monastery complex and facilities, as well as proposed tourism \nproducts by June 2012.  \n \nThe  Government  of  Nepal  has  committed  to  pursue  the  following:  (i)  prepare  and \n16. \nendorse a policy statement and guidelines acceptable to ADB to eliminate outstanding charges \nto  CAAN  by  July  2010;  (ii)  reduce  overall  outstanding  dues  of  CAAN  to  30%  by  June  2012;  \n(iii)  prepare  and  start  implementing  a  business  plan  for  the  Gautam  Buddha  airport  by \nDecember  2010,  including  setting  of  aeronautical  and  nonaeronautical  rates  by  January  2014 \nand every year thereafter; and (iv) design, install, and operate a financial management reporting \nsystem  for  the  Gautam  Buddha  airport  linking  it  with  the  overall  management  information \nsystem of CAAN by December 2010.  \n \n17.   Management of Lumbini Development Trust (LDT) in Nepal will implement the following \naction  agenda:  (i)  develop  an  action  plan  and  start  implementing  measures  for  enhanced \nstrategic planning, heritage protection, visitor management, environmental management, O&M \n\n \n\n\f    Appendix 9 \n\n61 \n\nof  infrastructure,  and  engagement  of  communities  in  heritage  tourism  by  Jan  2011;  and  \n(ii)  develop  and  implement  a  financial  improvement  action  plan  to  gradually  enhance  the \nrevenues and financial management of LDT by June 2012, including an annual revision of the \nstructures and rates of fees, and charges for various services to meet O&M expenses.     \n \n\nCost\u2013Benefit Analysis   \n\n \n3. \n \n18. \nCapital  investment  costs,  valued  at  constant  2008  prices,  were  considered  in  the \nanalysis.  Recurrent  annual  expenses  to  support  O&M  were  calculated  at  3%  of  the  total  civil \nworks  cost.  Using  the  visitor  forecasts  prepared  for  each  subproject  as  part  of  the  demand \nanalysis  (para.  4),  financial  revenue  projections  were  prepared  based  on  the  indicative  lease \nand fee rates proposed by the implementing agencies.  \n \n19. \nTable  9.2  presents  the  results  of  the  calculation  of  financial  internal  rates  of  return \n(FIRRs)  and  sensitivity  analysis.  The  base  case  FIRRs  for  the  subprojects  are  estimated  to \nrange  from  3.72%  to  9.03%,  exceeding  the  weighted  average  costs  of  capital  calculated  at \n0.19%  to  2.75%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  performed  confirms  the  financial  viability  of  the \nsubprojects and the Project as a whole. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the \nFIRRs are most responsive to reductions in the projected financial revenues. The governments\u2019 \nfinancial  improvement  action  plans  will  address  this  risk  sufficiently  (paras.  14\u201317).

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nSouth  Asia,  with  a  population  of  1.2  billion  is  in  a  vulnerable  zone.  This  includes  the  project  countries  of  Nepal,  India,  and \nBangladesh. Himalayan regions of the countries are in a sensitive earthquake zone, prone to landslides. Floods and cyclones \nbring  extensive  damage  to  Bangladesh.  While  poverty  levels  have  improved  in  the  last  two  decades  in  the  four  countries \n(poverty headcount for Nepal at 31%, India at 35%, and Bangladesh at 50%), with the high population\u2014this translates to high \nlevels  of  absolute  poverty.  Country  poverty  assessments,  country  partnership  strategies,  and  sector  analyses  for  these \ncountries  show  that  economic  growth  and  employment  are  necessary  to  reduce  poverty.  Given  the  extreme  weather \nconditions and vulnerability of the project countries, there is a need tap new sources of employment which  will harness the \nstrengths of the countries.  \n \nDespite high levels of poverty, the subregion has a remarkable combination of potentials. The project countries are endowed \nwith  vast  and  diverse  cultural  and  natural  resources  that  give  them  the  opportunity  to  build  a  globally  competitive  tourism \nsector.  Tourism  contributes  to  the  project  countries\u2019  national  and  local  economies.  In  2007,  tourism  earnings  from \ninternational  visitors  in  the  three  countries  (including  entire  India)  totaled  $12.3  billion,  representing  a  150% \nincrease from the tourism earnings of 2003. According to World Travel and Tourism Council\u2019s statistics tourism employed \n13.7 million people in the three countries. However there is substantial scope to further enhance the contribution of tourism to \neconomic growth and job creation through enhancing (i) connectivity to and destination infrastructure in remote tourism assets \n(ii)  public  sector  capacities  to  manage  heritage  tourism  and  (iii)  engagement  of  communities  in  heritage  site  protection  and \nmanagement and the tourism economy.  \n \nThe Project will contribute to sustainable economic growth and reduced poverty in the subregion through the development of \nenvironmentally  and  culturally  sustainable  and  socially  inclusive  tourism,  leading  to  increased  employment,  increased  and \nbetter distributed incomes and benefits to the subregion\u2019s communities, and enhanced conservation and management of the \nsubregion\u2019s natural and cultural resources. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n\n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  tourism  sector  as  reflected  in  an  increase  in  arrivals  and  length  of  stay  of  tourists  in  the \nsubregion and increased spending of tourists and expanded patterns of existing tourist flows. All these are expected to result \nin additional employment and improved living conditions for the local populations including the poor. Subprojects are designed \nto further reach the poor.  \n \nIn Nepal, tourism is an important sector for the economy and the proposed subprojects in and around Lumbini will increase \nalternative  livelihoods for the  population. Poverty  in the Terai is 28%. In India\u2019s Sikkim,  the poverty levels  are  around 36%. \nThe  nature  and  culture-based  tourism  and  village  tourism  will  provide  additional  employment  to  the  rural  communities  and \nimprove their environmental and accessibility conditions. The proposed training center will result in indirect employment in the \nsurrounding  communities.  In  Bangladesh,  infrastructure  development  will  support  local  livelihood,  and  the  proposed \nimprovements and restoration of cultural sites will increase tourist flows to benefit the local community. With constant threats \nfrom natural elements, alternative livelihood is required in  these areas of the country (Rajshahi, Bogra and Dinajpur)  where \npoverty levels are as high as 65% (in rural Rajshahi division). \n2. Design Features \n \nWhile the Project will improve destinations and access, it also aims to expand access to livelihoods directly through project-\nbased  activities  such  as  construction,  and  through  structured  efforts  to  promote  community-based  eco  and  cultural  tourism \nactivities and community-based management of select sites. To enable  communities, the project  will  have capacity  building \nactivities to foster community involvement, and provide support in designing community-based tourism products. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n63 \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThere  has  been  progress  in  the  achievements  of  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  targets  in  the  three  countries. \nNepal\u2019s 2005 MDG Progress Report indicated that Nepal was likely or potentially able to meet MDG goals except universal \nprimary  education  and  HIV/AIDS.  India  on  the  other  hand  has  been  cited  by  the  Millennium  Progress  Report  as  leading \npoverty reduction as \u201cwith more than 2.3 billion people in these two countries (People's Republic of China and India) alone, \ntheir major advances in poverty reduction drive developing world averages.\u201d The 11th Five Year Plan of India have goals and \nprograms  more  ambitious  than  the  MDGs  targets.  Finally,  UNDP\u2019s  MDG  Monitor  reflects  that  Bangladesh  is  on  track  in \nrelation to most targets already achieving gender parity in primary and secondary education, and in wage employment in the \nnon-agriculture sector. \n \nThe achievement of the MDGs has been boosted by economic growth, which is expected to grow at a less rapid pace as a \nresult of the global slowdown. This can worsen unemployment. While employment rates have been increasing in Bangladesh \nand  India,  at  the  current  rates  of  4.2%  and  3.1%  respectively\u2014this  translates  to  about  14  million  individuals  who  are \nunemployed.  While  Nepal  employment  statistics  are  unavailable,  studies  estimate  it  in  the  region  of  40%  of  labor  force.  \nSustained  economic  growth  and  employment  generation  are  key  factors  in  further  achieving  MDG  targets  and  achieving \ndevelopment. The Project is expected to enable the countries to earn more foreign exchange, generate additional jobs, and \nimprove  total  economic  output.  It  is  estimated  that  the  Project  will  benefit  an  overall  2.4  million  people  through  increased \nincomes, employment, health and environmental improvements, and reduced travel time. Around 500,000 people will benefit \nfrom additional employment both in the tourism industry and the industries related to tourism. At least 10,000 local livelihoods \nwill  be  created  improving  the  lives  of  communities  around  the  sites.  The  capacity  building  activities  will  equip  around  250 \npractitioners with skills for enhanced protection, management, and marketing of key destinations in the three countries.     \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nExtensive consultations  were  held  with stakeholders. As select activities  will be community-based,  willingness to participate \nand  manage  assets  is  one  of  the  key  requirements  in  subproject  selection.  The  Project  is  designed  to  be  inclusive,  hence \ncommunity capacity building, is part of the Project, including participatory processes. A stakeholder analysis was undertaken \nparticularly for community based tourism subprojects. Key stakeholders identified were communities, NGOs, self-help groups \nand  the  government  agencies.  The  perceptions  were  obtained  through  focus  group  discussions,  individual  interviews,  and \ngroup  meetings  to  assess  the  income  and  other  benefits  from  the  investments,  the  needs  and  willingness  to  participate  in \nservice and site management. These were considered in the project design.  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues  \n\n \n\nWomen and men  will benefit  from the Project, through improved opportunities for income generation,  directly as  part of the \ncommunity-based  tourism  activities,  and  indirectly  through  increase  employment  from  increased  tourist  inflows.  The \nimprovement  of  tourist  infrastructure  and  amenities  will  also  result  in  general  benefits  to  communities,  including  women.  \nGiven that the project provides for harnessing local handicrafts and potentials for community based tourism, it will positively \nbenefit women entrepreneurs. \n  \n2.

This will be through: (i) integrated development of \nhigh  yielding  tourism  circuits  and  destinations,  (ii)  effective  management  of  tourism  and \nenvironment  and  culture,  and  (iii)  enhancing  the  linkages  of  expanded  tourism  to  the  local \ncommunities. These will be undertaken in three countries.1 \n \n2. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  In  all \nsubprojects,  to  the  extent  possible,  works  will  be  within  existing  facilities  which  is  government \nland.  For  the  Lumbini  subproject  in  Nepal;  the  Chemchey,  Singalila,  Yuksom,  and  Himalayan \nInstitute  of  Ecotourism  and  Mountaineering  subprojects  in  India;  and  the  sample-subproject  in \nBangladesh\u2014there  will  be  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  as  all  works  will  be \nwithin  un-encroached  existing  facilities  which  is  government  land.  While  most  of  the  Gautam \nBuddha airport improvement in Nepal, and the Rumtek monastery subproject works in India will \nbe within existing facilities, the runway expansion in Gautam Buddha airport, and the parking lot \nand Shanti view point works in Rumtek require land acquisition. \n \n3. \nIn the Gautam Buddha airport, strip land acquisition (92.89 hectares) will affect 590 plots \nbelonging to 312 households. Affected lands are agricultural with the exception of 17 residential \nplots with residential structures. The land acquisition will also affect 132 fruit and timber trees, \ntwo  primary  schools  (one  private  school  and  one  Government  School)  serving  300  and  500 \nstudents respectively, 80 wells, 1 shrine, and a portion of a poultry farm. Due to the proposed \nexpansion,  10  kilometers  of  village  access  roads  will  be  disrupted  and  will  require \nreconstruction.  Of  the  312  affected  households    in  Gautam  Buddha  airport,  68  affected \nhouseholds  are  vulnerable:  7  Affected  households  are  headed  by  women,  and  61  affected \nhouseholds  are  poor  Dalit/Janjati  whose  livelihood  is  land-based.  In  Rumtek,  land  acquisition \n(0.6 hectares) for multi-level parking will affect 5 brothers and their families. The land is used for \nagriculture and has one structure (a makeshift pigsty). The Shanti view point has four tenants \noperating eateries and tea shops. They will be temporarily affected during construction, but will \nbe  provided  commercial  space  after  the  re-construction  of  the  view  point.  Detailed  design  will \nfurther  consider  subproject  siting  and  alignment  to  further  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  impacts.  A  full  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  airport,  a  short \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  Rumtek,  and  a  resettlement  framework  has  been \nprepared for future subprojects in Bangladesh (Supplementary Appendix T).  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  resettlement  plans  are  summarized  in  this  document.  The  resettlement  plans \noutline  the  involuntary  resettlement  objectives  and  strategy  for  affected  persons  based  on \nnational and state laws and policies of the three countries and the Asian Development Bank's \n(ADB\u2019s) Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, 1995. The resettlement plans provide a comparison \nof these documents and addresses gaps. \n \n5. \nCore involuntary resettlement principles for the Project are: (i) acquisition of land will be \nminimized and will avoid the resettlement of people, as much as possible; (ii) local stakeholders \nwill  be  systematically  informed  and  properly  consulted    to  identify  the  possible  alternative \nsubproject  engineering  and  operational  solutions  to  avoid  or  minimize  the  adverse  impacts  of \nland  acquisition;  and  disclosure  to  the  public  regarding  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans, \n\nObjectives, Policy Framework and Entitlements \n\n                                                 \n1  Components per country are described in the main text paras 28-29, 38 to 44, and 53-54.  \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\neligibility  of  affected  persons,  compensation,  entitlements  and  special  assistance  measures  to \nvulnerable  groups  will  be  undertaken;  (iii)  all  affected  persons  will  be  properly  identified  and \nrecorded  in  a  census  instrument  in  which  cut-off  date  for  their  eligibility  is  the  last  day  of  the \nsurvey in the subproject area, and will be notified in advance when land for the subproject will \nbe  acquired;  (iv)  lack of  formal  legal  rights  to  the  assets  lost  will  not  prevent  affected  persons \nfrom  receiving  compensation,  entitlement  and  rehabilitation  measures;  (v)  where  resettlement \ncannot be avoided, relocation site(s) whether permanent or temporary, free from environmental \nrisks  and  with  access  to  drinking  water  and  sanitation,  social  services  and  all  other  services \naccessible  in  the  previous  location,  will  be  provided  prior  to  relocation,  in  consultation  with \naffected persons and their hosts; (vi) relocated affected persons will be provided with assistance \nto  maintain,  or  improve  their  pre-subproject  living  standards,  income  earning  capacity  and \nproduction  levels;  (vii)  special  assistance  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  resettlement \nimplementation process to protect the socially and economically vulnerable groups that will be \naffected;2 (viii) effective mechanism for arbitration of complaints and grievances will be provided \nduring resettlement implementation; (ix) institutional arrangements and human resources will be \nin  place  for  consultation,  liaison,  land  acquisition,  resettlement  and  monitoring  to  ensure  the \neffective  resettlement  implementation  prior  to  commencement  of  the  subproject;  and  (x) \npayment  of  compensation  prior  to  displacement  must  be  provided,  and  other  resettlement \nassistance initiated prior to award of civil works contract.

For the Gautam \nBuddha airport, consultations employing various methods (household sample surveys with 275 \nrespondents, and focus group discussions with affected persons (June 2008) have been carried \nout.  In  addition,  key  informant  interviews  including  affected  persons  (including  vulnerable \naffected  persons),  village  heads,  and  government  agency  representatives  have  been  carried \nout.  In  line  with  the  requirements  of  the  Government  of  Nepal,  public  hearing  to  disclose  and \ndiscuss  the  subproject  and  safeguards  in  communities,  involving  affected  persons  and  other \nstakeholders,  has  been  undertaken  (March  2008).  The  issues  raised  were  addressed  in  the \nsafeguard documents. Subsequent to preparation of draft  safeguard documents, consultations \nwere  undertaken  in  July  2008  involving  stakeholders  to  disclose  and  discuss  safeguards \ndocuments in local language. For Rumtek, consultations included focus group discussions with \nthe affected persons at Shanti view point, and on-site interviews and household surveys for the \n5 affected households (September 2008). Feedback was reflected in subproject design.33. \n \nThe  resettlement  plans  for  Nepal  and  India,  and  the  resettlement  framework  for \n7. \nBangladesh  will  be  made  available  in  relevant  local  government  agencies,  and  the  Project \nManagement  and  Implementation  Unit  (PMIU).  The  resettlement  plan  will  also  be  made \navailable  in  the  website  of  the  Executing  Agencies  (EAs).  The  resettlement  plan  will  also  be \ndisclosed  in  ADB\u2019s  website;  and  information  dissemination  and  consultation  will  continue \nthroughout Project implementation. \n \n8. \nGrievances of affected persons will first be brought to the attention of the project social \ndevelopment  specialist  (SDS).  Grievances  not  redressed  will  be  brought  to  the  grievance \n                                                 \n3   Based on the feedback received during consultations, designs have been revised to enable the AHs to retain the \n\nfrontage of 30m from the road line, which they wanted to keep for future residential construction.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n69  \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\nCompensation, Relocation and Income Restoration \n\nLoss of land, structure, assets, trees, and crops will be at replacement cost.

The  GRC  will  meet  every  month  (if  grievances  are  brought  to  the \nCommittee),  determine  the  merit  of  each  grievance,  and  resolve  grievances  within a  month  of \nreceiving  the  complaint\u2014failing  which  the  grievance  can  be  appealed  with  the  GRC.  Further \ngrievances  will  be  referred  by  affected  persons  to  the  appropriate  courts  of  law.  The  project \nmanagement  and  implementation  unit  (PMIU)  will  keep  records  of  all  grievances  received \nincluding: contact details of complainant, date the complaint was received, nature of grievance, \nagreed corrective actions and the date these were effected, and final outcome. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nin the resettlement plans. Vulnerable households will be provided additional assistance in the \nform of land-for-land replacement options, prioritization in project employment, and an additional \nallowance for land and structure losses. Income losses are anticipated to be minimal and \ntemporary. Income restoration activities include the provision of short-term allowances and \nrestoration of access to livelihood activities. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nThe  Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation,  Department  of  Tourism,  Sikkim;  and \nDepartment  of  Archaeology;  are  the  EAs  for  Nepal,  India,  and  Bangladesh,  respectively.  For \nNepal, a project coordination unit (PCU) for implementing the project at the national level will be \nestablished within the EA. Within the PCU, a safeguards coordinator will oversee and manage \nsocial issues and social safeguards. The safeguards coordinator will ensure that all subprojects \ncomply with Government and ADB policies. NGOs or consultants will be engaged to implement \nthe  resettlement  plans.  Design,  Supervision,  and  Management  Consultants  (DMS)  will  be \nrecruited by the PCU to provide assistance to the PMIUs. In India and Bangladesh, these tasks \nwill  be  within  the  PMIU.  A  Social  Development  Specialist  (SDS)  from  the  DMS  will  finalize \n(during detailed design stage) and implement resettlement plans, and monitor resettlement plan \nimplementation. \n \nF. \n \nThe  detailed  budget  estimates  for  involuntary  resettlement  is  in  the  resettlement  plan, \n11. \nwhich the EA will include in the overall project cost estimate.

The Gautam Buddha airport and Lumbini subproject sites are in the \nflat terai region, is geologically stable with no major faults in the vicinity. There are neither any \nweak  rocks  nor  any  history  of  subsidence  of  land.  The  soil  of  the  area  comprises  loose  soils \nrepresented  by  silt,  clay  and  sand.  In  the  Gautam  Buddha  airport  the  Ghaghar  Khola  stream \nwhich supports common species in the rainy season flows where the runway will be extended.4 \nLand use is predominantly agricultural. All flora and fauna are common species and there are \nno protected areas in and around the site. In Lumbini works will be outside of the sacred garden \narea which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and outside of the Crane and Bird Sanctuary.5  \n \n3. \nIndia Subprojects. The subprojects are in the eastern, southern and western districts of \nSikkim, which is part of inner ranges of Himalayan mountains with no open valley or plains but \nof varied elevations ranging from 300 to 8,585 m. The eastern and western districts constitute \nhard massive gneissose rocks, while the southern portion is formed of comparatively soft, thin, \nslate  and  half-schistose  rocks.  The  proposed  improvement  of  treks  is  within  the  Singalila \necotourism zone, in the west district and is within the Kanchendzonga National Park (KNP). The \nsubprojects  are  outside  core  areas  identified  for  conservation  within  the  KNP  and  Biosphere \nreserve and are all within the Manipulation (Tourism) Zone.6 Other subproject sites are not in or \nadjacent to protected areas.  \n                                                 \n1  For Bangladesh, to ensure compliance with the environmental guidelines and requirements of the Government and \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  environmental  subproject  selection  guidelines  and  an  EARP  to  guide  the \nimplementation  of  future  subprojects  have  been  developed.  The  EARP  details  the  (i)  government  environmental \nassessment and review procedures, (ii) responsibilities and authorities involved in environmental assessment and \nreview,  (iii) compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines,  (iv) staffing  requirements  and  budgets,  and  (v) \nsubproject environmental selection guidelines. \n\n2  The  Project  will  be  phased;  the  works  in  Paharpur  Mahavihara  site  comprises  Phase  1  and  is  the  sample \n\nsubproject. \n\n3   Including environmental assessment undertaken by the Government for the Nepal airport subproject. \n4   A tributary of the Tinau River. During the rainy season, varieties of fishes found in the khola are the same as those \n\nin the River. Aquatic vegetation is sparse in the river bed due to the high velocity of the river current. \n\n5  The  Lumbini  Gardens  were  created  after  the  acquisition  of  land  under  the  1978  master  plan,  and  the  area  has \nturned  into  a  rich  habitat  after  tree  plantation  and  creation  of  wetlands.  The  Crane  and  Bird  Sanctuary  was \nestablished by the International Crane foundation, in association with the World Conservation Union (IUCN) for the \nconservation and restoration of wetland biodiversity. \n\n6  The KBP, has been demarcated into the core zone, manipulation zone (forestry), manipulation zone (tourism) and \nrestoration  zones.  The  subproject  works  in  the  manipulation  zone  (tourism)  are  in  line  with  the  conservation \n/development  plans  of  the  State  Forest  Department,  Government  of  Sikkim  for  the  management  of  the  National \nPark, and promotion of the Singalila ecotourism zone.  \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 12 \n\n71 \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nEnvironmental Impact Forecasting and Mitigation \n\n \n4. \nBangladesh  Subprojects.  The  Paharpur  sample  subproject  site  is  a  UNESCO  World \nHeritage site in the Rahshahi division. Paharpur is located in slightly elevated landform terraces \ncompared with the surrounding flat plains and form a distinct, relatively flood-free physiographic \nunit. The soil is red clay containing an excess of iron and lime but is deficient in siliceous matter. \nThe  surrounding  land  is  predominantly  agricultural  (paddy).  There  are  several  streams  and \nstanding water bodies connected to the rivers through artificial channels. The site is drained by \na lined drain to the Malancha wetland, which discharges into the Tulsi Ganga River. There is no \nadjacent natural vegetation or protected area. \n \nC. \n \n \n \n5. \nNepal.  The  subprojects  will  have  positive  environmental  impacts  particularly  in  and \naround the cultural and natural heritage site of Lumbini through improved water and solid waste \nmanagement. All works are outside the sacred garden area and the Crane and Bird Sanctuary. \nPotential adverse environmental impacts in the works in Lumbini are largely construction related \nof  limited  intensity  and  of  short  duration,  and  can  be  addressed  through  proven  mitigation \nmeasures and adoption of good engineering practices. The Gautam Buddha airport subproject \nwill  result  in  improved  environmental  conditions  with  the  improvement  in  drainage  conditions \nwithin the site, provision of better sanitation and waste management facilities, and landscaping. \nThe  diversion  of  the  Ghaghar  Khola  stream  to  the  periphery  of  the  airport  site  has  been \ndesigned based on 1:100 year return flood flow. No adverse impacts on flooding or on aquatic \nhabitat are envisaged. Potential adverse impacts are largely construction related, which shall be \nof  limited  intensity  to  the  surrounding  communities  during  the  construction  period  and  can  be \naddressed  through  proven  mitigation  measures  and  adoption  of  good  engineering  practices \nduring  construction.  The  modeling  of  air  and  noise7  due  to  the  increased  air  traffic  operations \nindicates that the impacts on the surroundings communities are not significant. \n \n6. \nIndia.  The  subprojects  will  have  positive  environmental  impacts  particularly  in  and \naround  the  cultural  and  natural  heritage  sites  through  the  provision  of  basic  infrastructure \namenities:  water  supply,  basic  sanitation  facilities,  and  solid  waste  management.  Works  are \noutside  protected  areas  with  the  exception  of  the  strengthening  of  the  trek  in  the  Singalila \nEcotourism Promotion Zone. However, work in this trek will be limited to existing trek and camp \nsites and will result in positive environmental impacts including reducing erosion, and preventing \ntrekkers  from  going  to  sensitive  areas  outside  the  trails.  Connectivity  improvements  are \nproposed within the vacant existing rights of way. Potential adverse environmental impacts are \nlargely  construction  related  which  are  of  limited  intensity  and  of  short  duration,  and  can  be \naddressed through proven mitigation measures and adoption of good engineering practices.  \n \nBangladesh. The subproject will have positive environmental impacts particularly in and \n7. \naround the cultural heritage sites through the provision of basic infrastructure amenities: water \nsupply, basic sanitation facilities, site drainage, and solid waste management. Potential adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  are  mostly  related  to  planning,  location,  and  design  where  failure  to \nfollow  environmental  subproject  selection  guidelines  may  adversely  affect  the  site  and  its \n\n                                                 \n7   For the short-term simulations from the airport, cumulative emissions from all sources in the area are simulated as \nmultiple point area source using SCREEN3. The concentrations  were estimated around 400 grid points to obtain \nan  optimum  description  of  variations  in  concentrations  over  the  site  in  10-km  radius  covering  16  directions.  The \nincremental concentrations are estimated for the worst case scenario using stability class B. For noise impacts , a \nscreening model Area Equivalent Method, version 7.0 developed by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office \nof Environment and Energy, USA has been used. \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nsurroundings.  There  are  also  construction  impacts  but  these  will  be  of  limited  intensity  and  of \nshort  duration.  These  can  be  addressed  through  proven  mitigation  measures  and  adoption  of \ngood engineering practices. \n \n \n \n8. \nIn  all  subprojects  mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  for  potential  adverse \nimpacts.  Measures  include  proper  location,  planning,  and  design  of  components;  control  of \nconstruction  activity;  and  proper  system  maintenance  following  commissioning.  While  each \nsubproject with components in cultural and natural heritage sites are designed to have positive \nenvironmental impacts, in view of the fact that the sites are of cultural and natural value, extra \nprecautions  have  been  identified.  All  environmental  assessments  include  environmental \nmanagement  plans  (EMPs),  and  contractor  clauses  as  part  of  the  IEEs.8  Contractors  will \nprepare  a  site  specific  environmental  implementation  plan  (EIP)  on  the  basis  of  the \nenvironmental assessment documents, the EMP, and contractor clauses. The airport expansion \nin Nepal is the subproject which has the largest potential negative environmental impacts. In this \nregard,  EMPs  have  been  prepared  for  the  subproject.

In \nNepal, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) for implementing the project at the national level will \nbe  established  within  the  EA.  Within  the  PCU,  a  safeguards  coordinator  will  provide  overall \ndirection for management of environmental issues. A Project Management and Implementation \nUnit  (PMIU)  will  be  established  for  each  subproject.  In  India  and  Bangladesh,  the  PCU \nresponsibilities  will  be  undertaken  by  the  PMIU.  The  PMIU\u2019s  responsibilities  include  ensuring \nimplementation of IEEs. For Bangladesh it also includes preparing and updating IEEs consistent \nwith the EARP. \n \n10. \nDesign, Supervision, and Management Consultants (DMS) will be recruited by the PMIU \nto  provide  assistance  in  project  implementation.  The  DMS  consultants  will  include  an \nenvironment  specialist  (DMS-ES).  The  DMS-ES  will  support  environmental  management \nfunctions  including  updating  subproject  IEEs  in  respect  to  environmental  management  plans, \nassisting  in  updating  IEEs,  and  assisting  in  monitoring  impacts  and  mitigation  measures \nassociate with subprojects. For Bangladesh, the DMS-ES will also provide technical support to \nthe  PMIU  including  reviewing  and  updating  the  EARP  and  guidelines  for  specific  types  of \nsubprojects,  assisting  in  the  preparation  of  reference  for  environmental  assessment,  and \nassisting in the preparation of IEEs.  \n \n11. \nEnvironmental  review  of  subprojects  will  consist  of  screening  by  the  PMIU  and \npreparation  of  updated  and  new  IEEs  by  with  DMS-ES  support.  The  DMS  will  assist  in \nsubproject  preparation  and  implementation.  Review  will  be  conducted  by  environmental \nauthorities in conjunction with a review panel set up by the PMIU. The PMIU working with the \nDMS-ES  assist  in  the  steps  for  updating  or  preparing  the  IEE,  capacity  building  and  training, \npreparation  of  guidelines  and  procedures,  and  subproject-specific  guidance.  Environmental \nmonitoring  as  specified  in  the  IEEs  will  be  undertaken  by  the  PMIU  through  the  DMS  ES. \nMonitoring reports will be provided to the PCU in Nepal and PMIU in India and Bangladesh, for \napproval and submission on a biannual basis to ADB. \n \nThe  DMS-ES  will  be  required  to  include  mitigation  measures  in  designs  where \n12. \nappropriate,  and  to  specify  other  measures  in  construction  contracts.  Contractors  will  be \nrequired  by  their  contracts  to  implement  all  specified  mitigation,  monitoring,  and  reporting \nassigned to contractors as presented in subproject IEEs. Draft terms of reference for the ES and \nDMS-ES are in the IEEs and EARP. \n \nD. \n \nPublic  consultations  (29  sessions)  on  safeguards  were  held  in  each  subproject  site \n13. \nbetween  April  and  August  2008.  This  comprised  a  subproject  briefing  which  provides  an \noverview  of  potential  environmental  impacts  and  proposed  mitigation  measures.  Participants \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n(418)  included  communities  directly  affected  by  the  subprojects,  representatives  of  local \nnongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs),  and  representatives  of  local  government  agencies. \nIssues  raised  during  public  consultations  were  mostly  related  to  compensation  for  lost  assets, \nand  ensuring  that  there  was  no  loss  in  access to  resources  due  to  the  subprojects.  All  issues \nraised  and  how  these  were  addressed  is  documented  in  the  IEEs.    A  proposal  has  been \ndescribed  in  IEEs  for  continuing  the  process  of  public  consultation  during  construction  that \nincludes  a  mechanism  for  redress  of  grievances  that  arise  during  construction.  All  IEEs  and \nother  relevant  documents  will  be  made  available  at  public  locations  in  the  towns  and  will  be \ndisclosed to a wider audience via the ADB website.  \n \nE.  \n\nEnvironmental Guidelines and Environmental Assessment and Review \nProcedures (EARP) for Bangladesh \n\nthe \n\nConclusion \n\nreview  procedures, \n\n(i)  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and \n\n \n14. \nTo  ensure  compliance  with  Government  and  ADB  environmental  guidelines  and \nrequirements,  environmental  guidelines  and  EARP  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future \nsubprojects have been developed. Future subprojects will be screened and categorized by the \nPMIU.  Appropriate  environmental  assessment  documents  will  be  prepared  depending  on  the \ncategorization and will be reviewed and cleared by ADB for disclosure.  \n \n15. \nThe  full  EARP,  based  on  provisions  of  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  policies  and \nlegislative  provisions  and  the  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  of  ADB.  The  EARP  also \n(ii) \ndetails \nresponsibilities  and  authorities  involved  in  environmental  assessment  and  review,  (iii) \ncompliance  of  the  Project  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines,  and  (iv)  staffing  requirements \nand budgets.  \n \nF. \n \n16. \nThe  IEEs  show  that  while  cultural  and  natural  heritage  subprojects  may  be  sited  in \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas,  the  works  are  designed  to  result  in  improvements  in \nenvironmental  conditions  on-site.  The  environmental  impacts  due  to  the  GBA  are  largely \nconstruction  related\u2014civil  construction  works  associated  with  the  proposed  improvements. \nThere are no impacts on sensitive receptors. The modeling of air and noise impacts due to the \nair traffic do not indicate significant impacts on surrounding communities, and do not require any \nfurther assessments or special mitigation measures. Any adverse environmental impact can be \naddressed  through  proper  location,  planning,  and  design  of  the  subproject;  control  of \nconstruction  activity;  proper  system  maintenance  following  construction;  and  mitigation \nmeasures.  The  proposed  subprojects  have  been  consulted  with  the  stakeholders  and  no \nsignificant  environmental  issues  were  raised.  EMPs  have  been  prepared  and  the  contract \nclauses specified in the EMP will address construction related impacts and effectively minimize \nany  adverse  impacts.  Implementation  arrangements  provide  for  inputs  of  environmental \nspecialists  during  project  implementation  to  effectively  implement  the  EMP.  No  further \nassessments  of  environmental  impacts  are  required  for  the  cultural  and  natural  heritage \nsubprojects in India and Nepal; and the sample subproject in Bangladesh. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["  \n", "  \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 8 October 2009) \n", "Currency Unit\n1.00\n$1.00\n", "Currency Unit\nRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "Currency Unit\nNRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "taka (Tk)  \n$0.0145 \nTk68.3 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \n \n$0.0217 \n \nRs46.08 \n", " \n \n", "Nepalese rupee/s (NRe/NRs) \n$0.0132 \nNRs75.20 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nBPC \nCAAN \nDOA \nDOT \nEA \nEARP \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nGRC \nIEE \nkm \nLDT \nLIBOR \nMOTCA \nMTR \nNGO \nO&M \nOFID \nOPEC \nPCU \nPMIU \nSASEC \nSGIA \nTWG \nUNESCO \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBangladesh Parjatan Corporation \nCivil Aviation Authority of Nepal \nDepartment of Archaeology \nDepartment of Tourism \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancial internal rate of return \nGrievance Redress Committee \ninitial environmental examination \nkilometer \nLumbini Development Trust \nLondon interbank offered rate \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation  \n\u2013  mid term review \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "nongovernment organization \noperations and maintenance \nOPEC Fund for International Development \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \nproject coordination unit \nproject management and implementation unit \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nsecond-generation imprest account \ntourism working group \nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "NOTES \n \n", "The fiscal year of the Government of Nepal and its agencies ends on 15 July; of \nIndia and its agencies on 31 March, and of Bangladesh and its agencies on 30 \nJune.  \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "(i) \n", " \n(ii) \n \n \n  \n \n", " \nVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n", "X.
