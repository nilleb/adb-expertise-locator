(VGC Fund II or the fund), a private \nequity fund investing in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2. \nRationale for proposed ADB assistance. The proposed investment in VGC Fund II will \nprovide about 20 private companies with growth capital to help fast track their development. In \ndoing so, the fund will help increase the depth and diversity of venture and growth capital business \nmodels, encourage entrepreneurship, and support the transition of the PRC economy from one \nfocused on manufacturing to one driven increasingly by innovation and technology. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \nDescription.  Founded  in  2002  by  six  founding  partners,  CDH  China  Management \n3. \nCompany Limited and its affiliate (collectively known as \u201cCDH\u201d) is a pioneer private equity fund \nmanager that invests in companies with significant operations in the PRC.1 CDH has developed \nin-depth knowledge and expertise within target sectors from its long record of managing different \nfunds before VGC Fund II, which intends to invest in early to growth stage companies. 2 The fund \nmay also invest a limited portion of its capital opportunistically outside of its primary investment \nobjectives.3  VGC  Fund  II  intends  to  focus  on  companies  in  the  health  care,  logistics  and/or \nconsumer  goods,  and  artificial  intelligence  and technology  sectors.4  VGC Fund  II\u2019s  investment \nteam is led by Wang Lin and comprises 25 investment professionals, including 10 partners across \nits four offices.5 \n \n4. \nSince  its  inception,  CDH  has  raised  14  private  equity  and  venture  capital  funds \ndenominated in United States (US) dollars and renminbi, exceeding $10 billion in commitments.6 \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access \nto Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \nVGC Fund II is a closed-end private equity fund with a target capitalization of $500 million. \n5. \nCDH VGC II Holdings Company Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company, will manage the \nfund as the general partner. CDH Mid Market Management Company Limited, a Cayman Islands \n\n \n\n1  The founding partners are Wu Shangzhi, Jiao Shuge, Stuart Schonberger, Hu Xiaoling, Wang Lin, and Wang Zhenyu; \nCDH  VGC  II  Holdings  Company  Limited  (general  partner),  CDH  Mid  Market  Management  Company  Limited \n(manager), CDH Investments Management (Hong Kong) Limited (investment advisor), and any other entities that \nacted and/or will act as advisors to CDH VGC Fund II, L.P. and CDH\u2019s other funds are collectively referred to as \nCDH. \n\n2  CDH is an investment platform that, in addition to private equity funds (both onshore and offshore), manages different \nasset classes, including private equity, real estate, mezzanine, public fixed income, public equity, and private wealth \nmanagement. \n\n3 The ability to make opportunistic investments will provide the fund greater flexibility to create a balanced portfolio, \ngiven its focus on early to growth stage portfolio companies, and will include the ability to invest in publicly listed \nsecurities. \n\n4  The  fund  may  also  invest  in  other  sectors.  A  climate  change  target  amount  cannot  be  specified  as  this  is  an \ninvestment in a fund (as opposed to an investment in a company), and the composition of the underlying investee \ncompanies is not yet known. \n\n5  As of 31 July 2019, CDH employed more than 300 staff, including more than 150 investment professionals across \n\nBeijing, Hong Kong, China, Shanghai, and Singapore that manage different asset platforms. \n\n6  As  of  31  March  2019;  excludes  CDH  real  estate,  mezzanine  finance,  public  equities,  fixed  income,  and  wealth \n\nmanagement businesses. \n\n\fBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nexempted  company,  will  provide  management  and  administrative  services  to  the  fund  as  its \nmanager. It will also enter into arrangements with CDH Investments Management (Hong Kong) \nLimited,  the  advisor  and  a  Hong  Kong,  China  limited  liability  company,  to  obtain  advisory \nservices.7 \n \n6. \nInvestment identification. Through market mapping of 40 private equity funds focused \non the PRC, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) identified CDH as one of the top performing and \nconsistent fund managers investing growth capital in small and medium-sized companies. CDH \nhas a strong investment track record and has demonstrated its ability to anticipate and capitalize \non fast-growing sectors in the PRC. \n \n7. \nADB initiated dialogue with CDH in 2015 and has actively tracked the platform since then. \nADB  views  the  proposed  investment  to  be  consistent  with  its  private  equity  fund  investment \nguidelines. The investment would provide development benefits, including skilled jobs generation \nand technological innovation and adoption, particularly in the PRC health care sector. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nVGC Fund II aims to make about 20 investments averaging $10 million\u2013$30 million each \nin early to growth stage companies. The fund may provide additional capital to certain companies \nthat  have  grown  significantly  since  the  initial  investments.  It  will  generally  seek  to  invest  in \nbusinesses with experienced and driven management teams; strong alignment of interests with \nbusiness owners and management; significant growth prospects; mutually agreed exit strategies; \nand opportunities for the general partner to add value through its operational, strategic, and/or \ncapital markets expertise. VGC Fund II may invest a limited portion of its committed capital for \nopportunistic investments outside of its primary investment objective (footnote 3). \n \n9. \nVGC Fund II will adopt a top-down, research-intensive approach to identify key players in \ntargeted  sectors  and  source  investment  opportunities  with  leading  entrepreneurs.  The  fund\u2019s \ninvestments  are  expected  to  improve  the  PRC\u2019s  supply  and  demand  imbalances,  increase \nefficiency  and/or  reduce  costs  through  technology  advancements  and/or  business  model \nupgrades  to  deliver  long-term  sustainable  growth.  CDH  also  aims  to  build  an  ecosystem  of \nstakeholders  with  complementary  businesses  in  each  sector  that  will  benefit  and  add  value  to \nexisting and potential portfolio companies. \n \n10. \nCDH\u2019s  extensive  investment  experience  in  each  identified  sector  has  allowed  it  to \nproactively  address  the  challenges  and  opportunities  arising  from  the  PRC\u2019s  fast-evolving \neconomy.  The  investment  team  will  rely  on  CDH\u2019s  extensive relationships  to  identify  attractive \ninvestment opportunities and build a complementary network including leading entrepreneurs and \nmanagement teams in PRC. The investment team may use industry experts to analyze specific \nissues to mitigate particular risks and seek operational improvements. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nOwnership. VGC Fund II is an exempted limited partnership registered in the Cayman \nIslands. Its limited partners include institutional investors and family offices. ADB will be the first \ndevelopment financial institution to invest in VGC Fund II and will therefore add value in terms of \ncorporate  governance,  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  and  heightened  focus  on \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n7  Detailed information on the structure of the fund is in Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\ndevelopment investments. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to \ndisclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n12.  Management. The investment team consists of 25 investment professionals led by two \nmanaging  partners\u2014Wang  Lin  and  Huang  Yan\u2014who  are  supported  by  eight  senior  partners, \neach with an average of 10 years of private equity and/or operational experience in the PRC. The \ntwo managing partners, along with chairman Wu Shangzhi and chief executive officer Jiao Shuge, \nwill form the investment committee, which approves investments by majority decision. CDH also \nhas  59  back-office  staff,  including  legal  and  compliance,  finance  and  accounting,  investor \nrelations, and human resources, to support the investment platform. \n \n13. \nADB conducted integrity due diligence and enhanced tax integrity due diligence on CDH \nand  its  related  entities  and  identified  no  significant  integrity  risks.8  The  results  are  in  the \nownership,  management,  and  governance  linked  document  (footnote  7).  ADB\u2019s  review  of  the \nentity  does  not  give the bank  cause  to  believe  that  CDH  was  established  or  is  being  used  for \nmoney  laundering  or  terrorism  financing.  ADB  has  obtained  reasonable  assurance  that  the \ntransaction is not being used for tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud; and that the tax integrity \nrisks are low and acceptable to the bank. \n \n14. \nprocess: sourcing and underwriting, portfolio monitoring, and exiting. \n \n15. \nA typical investment would be led by one partner and up to four investment professionals, \ndepending on the deal size. The investment team evaluates a deal, prepares its investment thesis, \nand conducts due diligence on the target company. The sourcing and underwriting of investments \nare further divided into a four-stage process: \n\nGovernance  structure.  VGC  Fund  II  follows  a  three-stage  investment  and  divestment \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nProject brief. The investment team drafts a project brief on the opportunity. \nInitiating memorandum. The investment team conducts initial due diligence on the \ntarget company\u2019s business model and growth prospects, industry analysis, valuation, \nand key risks; and presents its findings to the investment committee. \nInvestment decision memorandum. The investment team completes the necessary \nfinancial, legal, and technical due diligence; and prepares a formal memorandum for \nthe investment committee\u2019s approval. \nFinal investment decision and execution. The investment team closes the deal and \nenters into binding legal documentation. \n\n \nThe  investment  team  also manages  the portfolio  investment  through  the  planned  exits. \n16. \nMonitoring  may  include  (i)  active  participation  at  the  board  level,  (ii)  regular  dialogue  with \nmanagement  and  company  visits,  (iii)  budget  and  strategy  reviews,  and  (iv)  management \ninformation  analysis.  The  team  also  works  closely  with  company  management  to  execute  the \ngrowth  strategy.  Key  focus  areas  for  value  creation  include  (i)  active  involvement  in  strategic \ndecisions  to  enhance  market  position,  (ii)  navigation  of  complex  shareholding  structures,  (iii) \nexternal  growth  through  mergers  and  acquisitions,  and  (iv)  long-term  financing  solutions  via \ncapital markets access. The investment team also monitors market conditions that could impact \nthe exit strategy and timing. \n \n\n8  ADB. 2003.

The  ADB \ninvestment will not exceed 25% of the fund\u2019s total committed capital and will not result in ADB \nbeing its single largest investor. \n \nB. \n \nThe general partner aims to achieve a target gross internal rate of return of 25% in US \n20. \ndollars for the fund. Consistent with market practice but subject to certain limitations, the general \npartner can recall a portion of ADB\u2019s capital (previously distributed to ADB) for reinvestment. In \nsuch instances, ADB\u2019s total capital commitment to VGC Fund II will remain unchanged. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nExit  strategy.  CDH  will  have  a  10-year  term  from  final  closing,  subject  to  two  1-year \nextensions. The anticipated exit strategies of CDH\u2019s investments include (i) public offerings on \nthe  Hong  Kong,  China;  PRC;  and/or  other  international  stock  exchanges;  (ii)  trade  sales  of \nportfolio companies to local and foreign strategic buyers; and (iii) secondary sales to other private \nequity funds. \n \n22. \nReporting arrangements. The general partner will provide ADB with unaudited quarterly \nreports,  audited  annual  reports  with  financial  statements,  quarterly  and  annual  fund  overview \nreports  with  summary  description  of  each  portfolio  company,  and  annual  development \neffectiveness monitoring reports. ADB will review this information and follow up with the general \npartner if more information or clarification is needed. If the information received from the general \npartner raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in VGC Fund II, ADB could \ndecide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent and detailed review. \n \n23. \nVGC  Fund  II  will  adopt  an  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS) \ncompliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) before its first disbursement and must \nreport annually on environmental and social safeguard issues. ADB will monitor the timing and \nquality  of  the  ESMS  reports  and  offer  guidance  if  the  general  partner  requires  clarification  on \nADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \n\n9  Voting representatives of the advisory committee will not be affiliates of the general partner or the advisor. \n10 [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nD. \n \n24. \nPromote  private  sector  development.  The  proposed  investment  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nobjectives to promote private sector development by supporting the PRC\u2019s rapidly growing private \nsector  economy.  Through  this  investment,  ADB  will  help  finance  small  and  medium-sized \ncompanies  in  the  PRC,  thereby  potentially  reducing  the  economic  dominance  of  large  state-\nowned  enterprises.  VGC  Fund  II  is  expected  to  identify  and  support  strong,  capable  business \nleaders, thereby helping to foster a new generation of entrepreneurs in the PRC. By supporting \nthe  fund,  ADB  also  aims  to  increase  business  efficiency,  labor  productivity,  and  overall \nemployment in the investee companies. \n \n25. \nRaise  standards.  As  the  second  development  financial  institution  investor  in  a  CDH-\nmanaged fund, ADB will enhance VGC Fund II\u2019s ESMS to comply with the bank\u2019s environmental \nand social safeguard standards and report on development indicators. In addition, ADB and other \nadvisory committee members will provide oversight on important governance matters, which are \ncritical for companies to demonstrate as they seek additional sources of growth capital. \n \n26.  Mobilize  cofinancing  opportunities.  CDH  values  ADB\u2019s  ability  to  provide  debt  and \nequity financing directly to portfolio companies to help them grow. In addition to providing capital \nfrom its own balance sheet, ADB can help mobilize financing from third-party sources. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. 11 \n \n28. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n29. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. 12 \n \n30. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. 13 \n \n31. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n32. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n11  [This  information  has been  removed as it  falls  under the exception  to  disclosure in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n12 [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n13  [This  information  has been  removed as it  falls  under the exception  to  disclosure in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nOutcome.

The investment is aligned with \n36. \nthe  operational  priorities  of  ADB  Strategy  2030,  including  addressing  remaining  poverty  and \nreducing inequalities by generating quality jobs, improving education, and achieving better health \nfor all.14 Strategy 2030 also supports using private equity funds as an important modality to extend \nADB\u2019s reach because of their significant leveraging and mobilizing effects, as well as to promote \nfinancial inclusion. \n \n37. \nConsistency with country strategy. The investment is aligned with ADB\u2019s PRC country \npartnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020,  which  prioritizes  enhancing  finance  sector  infrastructure  and \nsupporting commercially viable business models to assist in continued domestic rebalancing from \nindustry to services.15 \n \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. ADB\u2019s Operational \n38. \nPlan for Health strongly supports private sector approaches to address quality, affordability, and \naccessibility in the health sector.16 By investing in VGC Fund II, ADB would be partnering with a \nleading  PRC-focused  private  equity  fund  manager  that  has  developed  deep  expertise  and  a \nnetwork in health care. Investments made by the fund are expected to support the generation of \ninnovative solutions to improve the quality, accessibility, and affordability of health care services \nin the PRC. \n \nLessons from previous operations. The project team considered lessons from previous \n39. \nADB private equity fund investments and incorporated the same into the proposed transaction. \nFor example, an evaluation report published in 2019 on ADB Private Sector Equity Investments \nconcluded that ADB should refine its approach to private equity fund investments to ensure their \nfinancial  sustainability  and  appropriately  prioritize  value  addition  and  development  impact.17  In \nthis case, ADB comprehensively assessed CDH as a platform, including the quality and depth of \nthe management team, performance of its portfolio companies, and investment and exit record of \nprior funds. ADB also confirmed CDH\u2019s alignment with the bank\u2019s development mandate in terms \n\n \n\n14 ADB.  2018.

The  potential  fund \ninvestees\u2019 business activities are not expected to generate significant environmental and social \nimpacts or risks, require involuntary resettlement, or adversely or beneficially affect distinct and \nvulnerable  ethnic  minority  communities.  Environmental  impacts  caused  by  expected  investee \nbusiness activities are, however, possible during the construction and operation of buildings, such \nas health care and manufacturing facilities. Such environmental impacts are expected to be site-\nspecific, few are irreversible, and in most cases mitigation measures can be incorporated in the \nproject designs and operational controls. All other prospective investments are expected to be \nsmall-scale and operate in leased premises in urban and peri-urban locations. ADB will have the \nright  to  be  exempted  from  contributing  capital  to  any  proposed  investment  that  it  assesses  as \nbeing noncompliant with the ESMS and any safeguards category A investment. \n \nVGC Fund II has established and implemented an ESMS commensurate with identified \n42. \nportfolio risks and impacts. The ESMS was established following the Performance Standards on \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Standards  of the  International  Finance  Corporation (IFC)  after IFC\u2019s \ninvestment in CDH Fund V in 2013 and was last updated in January 2018.19 During due diligence, \nADB has identified the following actions to enhance the ESMS: harmonize the fund\u2019s exclusion \nlist  with  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list;  update  procedures for  categorizing  projects \nbased on Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, and for compliance with national laws and \nregulations;  include  measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards \npursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy (2001);  include  a  grievance  redress mechanism; \ninclude project information disclosure and meaningful consultation with affected people following \nADB  requirements;  and  provide  supervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting  of  fund  investees\u2019 \nenvironmental and social performance to ADB.20 The ESMS will be enhanced following Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements and approved by ADB before ADB\u2019s first disbursement. CDH will \ninclude in its regular reporting information to ADB for VGC Fund II (i) the nature of subprojects \nand  categorization,  (ii)  compliance  with  the  safeguard  and  social  requirements,  and  (iii) \ncompliance with applicable national and international laws and standards.  \n \n43. \nNo gender elements. The project team discussed opportunities with CDH to undertake \nan  internal  gender  diversity  and  inclusion  policy  review  and  include  gender  indicators  in  their \ninvestment appraisal process. However, CDH does not view such measures to be necessary for \na PRC-based and -focused private equity firm given the country\u2019s strong policy and legislative \n\n \n\n18  ADB.
