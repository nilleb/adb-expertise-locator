An \nsample  community-based  minor \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  also \nprepared  to  guide  the  environmental  assessment  of  further \nsubprojects.  \n \nThe  proposed  Orissa  Integrated  Irrigated  Agriculture  and  Water \nManagement  Investment  Program  will  enhance  the  productivity, \nwater  use  efficiency,  and  sustainability  of  the  existing  major  and \nmedium-sized irrigation schemes and community-based minor lift \nirrigation  systems  in  the  four  northern  river  basins  and  a  part  of \nthe Mahanadi River Delta in Orissa state. The selected schemes \nare suffering from poor performance in irrigated agriculture due to \ninefficient  operation,  system  deterioration,  and  limited  integration \nwith  agriculture  support  services  and  marketing  systems.  The \nInvestment Program will include (i) water user association (WUA) \nempowerment,  (ii)  renovation  and  extension  of  irrigation  and \nassociated  infrastructure  including  field  channels,  (iii)  agriculture \nand related support services including livelihood enhancement of \nthe  poor,  and  (iv)  progressive  transfer  of  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  to  WUAs.  The  Investment  Program  will  also \nirrigation \nstrengthen \nmanagement  (PIM)  and  integrated  water  resources  management \n(IWRM)  with  management  reforms  and  capacity  strengthening  of \nrelevant institutions.  \n \nThe  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  will  finance  projects \nunder the Investment Program, provided the Government of India \nand  the  Orissa  state  government  comply  with  the  assurances  to \nADB and the constituent projects are in line with those assurances \nand with the criteria set out in the framework financing agreement \n(FFA).  \n \nADB will provide loans to finance projects under the MFF as soon \nas  the  projects  are  ready  for  financing  upon  submission  of \nsatisfactory  related  periodic  financing  request.  Each  loan  will \n\ninstitutional  basis \n\nfor  participatory \n\nthe \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\nthe  existing \n\nconstitute  a  tranche  and  may  carry  terms  different  from  the \nfinancing terms of previous or later loans. The choice of financing \nterms  will  depend  on  the  project  and  ADB\u2019s  financing  policies  at \nthe  time  the  loan  is  documented  in  a  legal  document.  Tranches \nmay be provided in sequence or simultaneously, and may overlap.\n \nThe  projects  corresponding  to  individual  tranches  may  comprise \nindividual subprojects, their subcomponents, and/or other physical \nand nonphysical components of the Investment Program that are \npackaged based on procurement and/or implementation years.  \n \nDespite  India\u2019s  rapid  overall  economic  growth,  development  in \nagriculture  and  related  rural  nonfarm  sectors  has  been  stagnant, \nand the sector is making a slow transformation to more intensive \nand high-value production and processing systems. Bottlenecks in \nboth  rural  and  urban  water  resources  are  also  increasingly  seen \nas a major constraint to economic growth. In this context, irrigation \nis drawing major attention because of its high share (84%) of total \nwater  use,  as  well  as  its  crucial  importance  for  agriculture  and \nrural  growth.  A  significant  part  of \nirrigation \ninfrastructure remains underutilized, with low water-use efficiency \nand insufficient O&M. The Government of India is promoting state \nsector reforms through its National Water Policy (NWP) 1987 and \n2002,  which  advocates  PIM  and  IWRM  to  promote  and  sustain \nmore efficient water use.  \n \nOrissa  is  one  of  the  poorest  states  in  India.  Despite  recent \nacceleration of its annual economic growth rates, disparity against \nthe national average is still widening. Agriculture is the backbone \nof  the  economy  and  is  the  central  focus  of  the  strategy  of  the \nOrissa  state  government  (OSG)  to  reduce  rural  poverty.  In  this \ncontext,  the  low  performance  of  existing  irrigation  infrastructure \nseriously  constrains  agricultural  productivity  and  diversification. \nWhile 45% of agricultural land is equipped with irrigation facilities, \nover  30%  of  this  area  hardly  receives  any  irrigation  and  the  rest \nhas  irregular  water  supply  due  to  poor  system  design,  inefficient \noperation,  lack  of  field  channels,  limited  accountability  in  system \nmanagement  to  farmers,  and  insufficient  maintenance.  Following \nthe  NWP,  the  OSG  is  prioritizing  the  improved  performance  of \nexisting infrastructure in partnership with WUAs as the fastest and \nmost  cost-effective  way  to  expand  reliable  irrigation  and  as  a \npathway to intensified, high-value agriculture.  \n \nTo support the process, the OSG has progressively developed the \npolicy, planning, and institutional basis for the irrigation and water \nresources  sector  since  the  late  1990s.  Specific  steps  taken \ninclude (i) promulgation of the State Water Policy and State Water \nPlan  adopting  PIM  and  IWRM  principles,  (ii)  establishment  of  a \nlegal  framework  for  WUAs,  (iii)  substantial  increases  in  water \ntariffs  and  O&M  financing,  and  (iv)  capacity  strengthening  of  the \nDepartment  of  Water  Resources  (DOWR).  In  line  with  this,  the \n\n\f \n\niii\n\ninitiated \n\nformation  of  WUAs,  renovation  of \n\nirrigation \nOSG \ninfrastructure,  and  progressive  transfer  of  the  O&M  responsibility \nto  WUAs.  So  far,  WUA  formation  has  reached  40%  of  the  total \ncommand  areas  under  public  irrigation  systems.  The  overall \nimpacts of the process are positive, particularly where WUAs are \nsufficiently  strengthened  and  provided  with  well-functioning \ninfrastructure,  although  capacity  development  of  WUAs  and \nDOWR requires long-term support and partnership.    \n \nThe  OSG  also  initiated  comprehensive  economic  reforms  in  the \nearly 2000s, aiming at inclusive growth with stronger public sector \naccountability  and  community  and  private  sector  participation. \nWithin this context, the OSG is keen to further advance PIM in the \nremaining schemes, and to incorporate the lessons learned so far, \nas  well  as  the  best  practices  from  other  Asian  countries  and \nIndian states to attain higher impacts in terms of productivity and \nsustainability.  The  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  meet  this \nneed,  with  an  improved  institutional  basis  including  enhanced \nDOWR  accountability  to  WUAs,  further  refinement  of  the  WUA \nlegal  framework,  and  steps  towards  sustainable  O&M  financing \nand IWRM. Investment program delivery and governance will also \nbe  upgraded  to  ensure  sufficient  WUA  empowerment  up  front, \ninfrastructure  quality,  integration  with  the  agriculture  value  chain \nand  support  systems,  and  sound  provider\u2013recipient  relations  for \nO&M.  Prepared  as  part  of  the  investment  plan  to  put  PIM  into \noperation  statewide,  the  Investment  Program  will  support  the \nrealization of sound sector operations from the OSG initiative.   \n \nThe  MFF  modality  is  most  suitable  for  the  Investment  Program. \nBuilding  on  the  progressively  developed  policy  and  institutional \nbasis,  the  MFF  provides  an  opportunity  for  (i)  flexibility  in \ninvestment  decision  making  based  on  subproject  readiness,  in \nin  planning  and  WUA \nparticular  ensuring  sound  progress \ninstitutional  building;  (ii)  higher  implementation  quality,  reflecting \nlessons learned and progressive and incremental improvement of \nthe  institutional  basis  during  the  program  period;  (iii)  longer-term \nprogram  engagement  allowing  sufficient  monitoring  of  the  critical \ninstitutional  development  process;  and \n(iv)  wider  program \ncoverage  that  allows  more  significant  sector  impacts  under  the \nproposed Investment Program.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe expected impact of the Investment Program is enhanced rural \neconomic growth and reduced poverty in the selected river basins, \nand  institutionalization  of  effective  mechanisms  to  put  into \noperation PIM-based agricultural growth.  \n \nThe  expected  outcome  is  enhanced  productivity,  water-use \nefficiency, and sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the selected \nexisting  schemes  in  the  river  basins,  and  improved  performance \nof  irrigation  service  delivery  and  water  resources  management \nwith empowered WUAs progressively taking over O&M roles.  \n \n\n \nProgram Investment Plan   The  investment  cost  of  the  Investment  Program  is  estimated  at \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n$268.8 million, including taxes and duties of $11.1 million.  \n \n\n \n\nSource \n\nADB \nOrissa State Government \nBeneficiaries a \n\nTotal \n\n \nAmount \n($ million) \n188.2 \n73.4 \n7.2 \n268.8 \n \n\n \nShare  \n(%) \n\n70 \n27 \n3 \n100 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\na  Contribution in cash or in kind \n\n \n \nA  facility  of  up  to  $188.2  million  from  the  ordinary  capital \nresources of ADB will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  Government  of \nIndia will cause the OSG to use the proceeds of each tranche for \nthe  expenditures  of  the  Investment  Program,  according  to  the \nconditions set forth in the FFA and the legal agreements for each \ntranche.  \n \nThe  Government  of  India  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds  in  local \ncurrency  to  the  OSG  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as \nreceived from ADB. The OSG will bear the foreign exchange risk \non the loan.  \n \nThe Investment Program resources will tentatively be available in \nfour  (or  more  if  needed)  tranches  until  September  2017  (the  last \nperiodic  financing  request  is  expected  to  be  submitted  by  31 \nMarch 2015).   \n \nMarch 2017 \n\n \nDepartment of Water Resources, Orissa \n \nProgram  implementation  will  institutionalize  effective  program \ndelivery  mechanisms  for  planning,  implementing,  and  sustaining \nirrigated  agriculture  development  with  PIM  within  the  regular  and \nimproved  setup  of  the  DOWR,  with  outsourcing  to  the  private \n(NGOs).

Day-to-day implementation will be done \nthrough  subproject  implementation  offices  (SIOs)  set  up  in \nDOWR\u2019s  field  offices  with  multidisciplinary  staff,  under  the \nguidance  and  coordination  of  the  district  development  committee \nchaired by the district collector. WUAs will have a major role in the \nprocess  by  endorsing  implementation  plans,  monitoring  program \ndelivery,  and  executing  minor  civil  works.  Regular  SIO\u2013WUA \nmeetings  will  be  institutionalized  as  a  major  forum  for  decision \nmaking.  \n \nProcurement  financed  from  the  ADB  loans  under  the  MFF  will \nconform  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). Civil works contracts of at least $10 million will \nbe  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  and  those \ncosting  less  than  $10  million  will  be  under  national  competitive \nbidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to ADB.  Single-stage, two-\nenvelope  bidding  with  post  qualification  will  be  adopted  for  all \nInvestment  Program. \nNCB  and \nSpecialized and small community works costing less than $10,000 \nmay be directly contracted with the concerned WUAs. \n \nFor  the  procurement  of  goods  and  related  services,  ICB  will  be \nused for contracts of at least $1 million and NCB for contracts of \nless  than  $1  million.  For  contracts  valued  at  less  than  $100,000 \nADB\u2019s shopping procedures may be followed.   \n \nConsultants  will  be  hired  for  institutional  development  and \ncapacity  building,  project  management,  design  and  construction \nmonitoring,  and  benefit  monitoring.  Agencies  or  institutions, \nincluding  established  registered  NGOs,  will  also  be  engaged  for \nparticipatory  planning,  WUA  strengthening,  minor  work  execution \nby WUAs, agriculture and livelihood programs, and facilitation and \nmonitoring of resettlement plans. All consultants and NGOs will be \nthe  Use  of \nto  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nengaged  according \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  directly  improve  the  incomes  and \nlivelihoods of about 1.7 million people by raising the performance \nof  215,000  hectares  (ha)  within  the  command  area  of  existing \nirrigation  schemes.  The  main  benefits  are  increased  agriculture \nproduction\u2014brought about by reliable water supply, particularly in \nareas  with  little  or  no  access  to  irrigation,  through  renovation  of \nthe  existing  infrastructure  and  improved  reservoir  and  canal \noperation\u2014along  with \nlabor  opportunities,  better \nnutrition, increased incomes, and lowered poverty. The economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  five  major  and  medium-sized \nschemes is between 19% and 23%, whereas the EIRRs of the two \nsample  minor  lift  schemes  are  30%  and  38%.  At  the  state  level, \n\nincreased \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n(ii) \n\nthrough \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe  OSG  has  committed \n\nthe Investment Program  will improve irrigation service delivery to \nattain  maximum  sustainable  benefits \nrenovating \ninfrastructure  and  installing  PIM  systems,  along  with  improved \nsector governance with associated institutional actions.  \n \nBetween  22%  and  69%  of  the  population  in  the  five  major  and \nmedium-sized irrigation subprojects fall below the poverty line, but \nare  generally  higher  than  the  national  average.  Most  of  those \npeople live on less than $1 a day. The social and gender strategy \nwill enhance the participation of the poor in WUAs, linking them to \nexisting  poverty  reduction  programs  of  the  OSG  with  delivery  of \ntargeted  support  under  the  Investment  Program  as  required, \nenhancing  the  role  of  women  in  project  institutions  and  WUAs, \nand  strengthening  the  capacities  of  the  DOWR  in  addressing \ngender development issues in promoting PIM.       \n \n \nThe  Investment  Program  has  a  few  risks  that  could  adversely \naffect  its  effectiveness  and  sustainability,  including  (i)  O&M \nsustainability; \nreform  principles  with \nleadership;  and  (iii)  implementation  risk.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of \nO&M  sustainability, \nto  continued \ncompliance  with  the  directions  of  the  Government\u2019s  Finance \nCommission on the O&M fund allocation and associated revisions \nof  tariff  structures.  This  is  accompanied  by  (i)  progressive \nstrengthening  of  DOWR  capacities  and  accountability  and  of \nWUAs  to  establish  self-sustaining  O&M  management  systems, \nand (ii) establishment of a sound asset performance management \nlevels  of  reform \ninformation  system.  To  ensure  adequate \nprinciples  operation,  sequential  steps  have  been  specified  in  the \nsector road map and implementation arrangements to ensure this \ndoes happen at sector and Investment Program levels.

The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nNational  Context  of  Rural  Economy  and  Water  Resources.  India  has  seen  rapid \neconomic  growth  since  the  late  1990s  and  achieved  a  per  capita  income  of  $588  in  2005. \nHowever, many people still remain poor; among the total population of 1.1 billion, 35% were living \non less than $1 a day, and 80% on less than $2 a day, mostly in rural areas,3 causing growing \nconcern about the urban\u2013rural divide. The growth rate of agriculture (accounting for 25% of gross \ndomestic product [GDP] but 58% of employment) slowed recently to just 1.8% per annum during \n2002\u20132005. Crop production stagnated with less than 1% growth, even though Indian yields are \nmuch lower than those in other developing countries.4 While diversification is progressing with the \nshare of horticulture and livestock reaching 21% and agriculture reaching 29% of GDP, growth in \nthese  subsectors  also  decelerated  to  less  than  4%  despite  high  potential.  Growth  of  the  rural \nnonfarm  sector,  now  larger  than  agriculture  as  a  share  of  GDP,  is  also  strongly  correlated  with \nagriculture  performance.  In  view  of  the  wide  regional  disparity  in  productivity  and  overall  self-\nsufficiency  in  cereal  crops,  the  growth  strategy  of  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP),  2007\u20132012, \nenvisages  a  multipronged  approach  in  response  to  diverse  agro-climatic  conditions,  aiming  at \ndiversification  to  high-value  agriculture  in  areas  endowed  with  better  climate  and  marketing \nconditions, while intensifying food crops in less advantaged areas.  \n\nIn  India,  bottlenecks  in  water  resources  are  increasingly  seen  as  a  major  threat  to \n3. \neconomic growth. Per capita availability of water is rapidly declining and is one third of the level \nit was at independence. Water stress is increasing in many river basins, while water quality is \ndeteriorating.  In  this  context,  more  efficient  irrigation  has  become  crucial  for  both  accelerating \nrural growth and conserving water resources. Irrigation is essential to agriculture and accounts \nfor 84% of total water use. Despite this, a significant part of the existing infrastructure (20% of \n57 million  hectares  [ha]  developed  for  surface  water  irrigation)  remains  unutilized  due  to  low \nwater-use efficiency and inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M). Management capacity \nof the state water agencies is a constraint in terms of the quality of service delivery and farmer \nparticipation. A sound regulatory framework for efficient inter-sector water management is in the \ninitial  stage  of  implementation. 5  The  Government  is  promoting  state  reforms  through  the \nNational  Water  Policy  (NWP)  of  1987  and  2002,  which  advocates  participatory  irrigation \nmanagement  (PIM)  in  partnership  with  water  user  associations  (WUAs),  and  integrated  water \n                                                 \n1  Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  was  provided  under  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  India  for \n\nPreparing the Orissa Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management Project. Manila. \n\n2   Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, and Norway. \n3   The country\u2019s urban\u2013rural population ratio was 29:71 in 2006.  \n4   The average rice yield is half that of Indonesia and Viet Nam.  \n5   Improving  the  management  of  existing  irrigation  infrastructure  is  critical  to  reduce  the  burden  on  India\u2019s  limited \nwater resources amidst the increasing demand for food and other water uses, and increasing financial, social, and \nenvironmental costs and time required to develop new water storage facilities. \n\n \n \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nresources  management  (IWRM). 6  Several  states  have  introduced  improved  institutional \nframeworks, but implementation progress varies across the country.  \n\n4. \nStatus in Orissa. Orissa remains one of India\u2019s poorest states, with a per capita income \nof Rs16,300 (70% of the national average) and 46% of the population (about 39 million) living \nbelow the poverty line in 2005. Disparity against the national average is widening, although the \nannual  economic  growth  rate  accelerated  to  over  7%  in  2006\u20132007.  About  85%  of  the  state\u2019s \npoor live in rural areas. Agriculture is the backbone of the economy, accounting for 33% of state \ndomestic product and employing over 60% of total labor; despite this, productivity remains low. \nThe value of agriculture output per hectare is 78% of the national average due to low yields and \ncropping  intensity.  Diversification  also  lags  behind,  with  food  crops  accounting  for  75%  of \ncropped  area  against  the  national  average  of  67%.  Key  constraints  are  (i)  limited  physical \ncapital, including irrigation and other rural infrastructure; (ii) limited access to and use of modern \ninputs  and  financial  services;  (iii)  a  low  technology  base;  (iv)  small  landholdings  (with  an \naverage size of 1.3 ha); (v) a lack of effective local institutions and links from input delivery to \noutput marketing; and (vi) limited effectiveness of public research and extension systems. \n\n5. \nOrissa  is  endowed  with  relatively  high  rainfall,  with  an  annual  average  of  1,500 \nmillimeters.  Despite  this,  irrigation  is  a  critical  input  for  agriculture  throughout  the  year,  as \n80%  of  the  annual  rainfall  occurs  in  the  June\u2013September  period  in  an  erratic  pattern.  The \nstate has a net sown area of 6.0 million ha. So far, 2.69 million ha of net irrigation potential \nhas  been  created,  comprising  1.24  million  ha  in  major  and  medium-sized  schemes,  0.50 \nmillion ha in minor flow schemes, 0.39 million ha in lift schemes, and 0.57 million ha in other \nmodalities  including  groundwater  irrigation.  An  additional  0.47  million  ha  of  potential \nirrigated  area  is  being  created.  However,  the  actual  area  with  irrigation  remains  at  a \nmaximum of 70% of the designed area. This is due to (i) infrastructure deterioration caused \nby insufficient maintenance; (ii) lack of water control structures, inefficient system operation, \nand  lack  of  accountability  of  facility  operators  to  farmers,  all  leading  to  high  levels  of  loss; \n(iii)  lack  of  farmer  participation  in  O&M;  and  (iv)  lack  of  field  channels  to  distribute  water \nacross  farm  plots. 7 Productivity  in  irrigated  agriculture  is  also  constrained  due  to  limited \nintegration  with  input  delivery,  agriculture  support  services,  and  output  marketing,  with \nlimited coordination among the line departments.  \n\n6. \nWith  regard  to  overall  water  resources  management  (as  against  irrigation  service \ndelivery),  competition  among  bulk  water  users  and  environmental  requirements  within  a  basin \nare  gradually  becoming  issues.8 This  calls  for  (i)  further  developing  water  resources  through \nwater  storage,  (ii)  improving  the  water-use  efficiency  of  existing  systems  in  particular  for \nirrigation,  and  (iii)  introducing  effective  institutional  mechanisms  for  regulatory  and  other  water \nmanagement functions on the basis of river basins from an IWRM perspective.  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nAgriculture  and  Support  Systems.  In  its  Vision  2020  and  the  11th  FYP,  the  Orissa \nstate government (OSG) envisions accelerating economic growth to 9% per year and reducing \npoverty by 15% during 2008\u20132012. Building on the comprehensive economic reforms pursued \n                                                 \n6   PIM promotes establishing WUAs and progressively transferring O&M responsibilities (presently held by irrigation \n\ndepartments) to WUAs, while enhancing the departmental accountability to WUAs with institutional reforms. \n\n7   Efficient water distribution in the dry season is a particular challenge requiring stronger management to efficiently \nallocate  the  limited  amount  of  available  water  among  farmers.  Moreover,  limited  efforts  have  been  made  to \npromote conjunctive use of groundwater irrigation within the irrigation schemes.  \n\n8   In 2001, irrigation accounted for 93% of surface water use, followed by domestic (4%) and industry (3%). With the \nannounced large foreign direct investments in the industry sector, inter-sector allocation and coordination in water \nuse is an emerging issue, despite overall abundance of water except during the very lean period.    \n\n\f3 \n\nsince  early  2000s,  key  priorities  include  (i)  improving  agriculture  productivity  and  market \norientation with PIM and the formation of farmer groups, (ii) expanding rural nonfarm business \nopportunities, and (iii) enabling broad-based industrial growth. These priorities will be supported \nby reforms in the enabling environment for private sector entry and improved fiscal and financial \nmanagement and public sector accountability. In this context, the OSG amended the Agriculture \nProduce Marketing Act in April 2006, which has opened ways for private investments in storage \nand  marketing  facilities  and  contract  farming.  The  OSG  also  endorsed  the  State  Agriculture \nPolicy  in  2008,  which  aims  at  commercially  oriented  agriculture,  with  emphasis  on  crop \ndiversification  and  marketing  reforms.  This  policy  promotes  participatory  and  comprehensive \nplanning  at  district  and  lower  levels,  based  on  which  support  will  be  delivered  through \ncoordination by line departments, private providers, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n\nDespite  the  improving  policy  environment,  dynamic  market-oriented  responses  are  still \n8. \nat  an  early  stage.  While  the  availability  of  fertilizer  improved  after  deregulation  of  private \ndistribution,  its  use  remains  half  the  national  average,  leading  to  declining  soil  fertility  in  large \nareas.  Availability  and  use  of  improved  seeds  also  remains  a  constraint,  meeting  only  25%  of \nthe  annual  replacement  needs  for  food  grains.  Formal  rural  credit  reaches  up  to  60%  of  farm \nhouseholds, but the remainder requires other solutions, such as a group guarantee approach.9 \nAgriculture extension suffers from lack of outreach, calling for improved accountability of public \nextension workers and increased use of private providers and information technology. In output \nmarketing, despite the rapidly expanding transport network,10 marketing chains are fragmented \nwith  information  dissymmetry,  requiring  collective  approaches  and  leadership  to  form  value-\nchain  networks.  In  general,  local  conditions  are  highly  varied.  Some  areas  have  progressed \ntowards intensive crop production and diversification, particularly with irrigation and good market \nconnectivity, while subsistence-oriented cropping also prevails in large areas. These conditions \ncall for (i) careful planning of the most suitable production systems for the locality, (ii) concerted \nefforts  to  facilitate  input  delivery  and  output  marketing,  and  (iii)  strategic  provision  of  support \nservices. Farmer organizations also need strengthening so that they can drive the process.  \n\nIrrigation \n\nInfrastructure  and  Management  System. \n\n9. \nIn  OSG\u2019s  development \nstrategy, development and sound management of irrigation infrastructure in partnership with \nWUAs  is  recognized  as  a  pathway  to  productive  and  high-value  agriculture,  and  poverty \nreduction.  Accordingly,  following  the  NWP  1987  and  2002,  the  OSG  has  progressively \nimproved  the  policy  and  institutional  framework  with  the  assistance  of  external  financiers, \nincluding  the  World  Bank  and  the  European  Union.  The  specific  reforms  include  (i) \npromulgating  the  State  Water  Policy  in  1994,  which  embodies  the  principles  of  PIM;  (ii) \nadopting  the  State  Water  Plan  in  2004  to  provide  a  prioritized  investment  framework;  (iii) \nestablishing  a  legal  framework  for  WUAs  with  the  enactment  of  the  Pani  Panchayat  Act \n2002;  (iv)  substantially  increasing  the  irrigation  tariff  and  O&M  fund  allocation;  and \n(v) strengthening  the  capacities  of  the  Department  of  Water  Resources  (DOWR)  for \nparticipatory skills and infrastructure development and management.  \n\n10. \nFollowing  this  framework,  the  process  of  WUA  formation,  infrastructure  improvement, \nand transfer of minor facilities to WUAs was initiated. While all externally assisted projects were \ncompleted by 2005 with a combined coverage of 0.4 million ha of net irrigated area (NIA), the \nOSG  maintained  the  drive  and  the  area  under  WUA  transfer  of  minor  facilities  reached  0.9 \nmillion  ha  by  mid-2007.  However,  this  transformation  process  remains  incomplete  and  needs \n                                                 \n9   OSG has initiated steps to reform its cooperatives credit system with the support of an ADB program loan (ADB. \n2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance  Grant  to  India  for  Rural  Cooperative  Credit  Restructuring  and  Development  Program.  Manila)  as  its \nparticipating states.   \n\n10 OSG is extending all-weather road to unserved habitations with a population of 1,000 or more through a national \nprogram assisted by ADB (ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on \na Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to India for Rural Roads Sector II Investment Program. Manila).  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ngreater  momentum  and  farmer  enthusiasm  so  that  the  reform  can  fully  achieve  sound  sector \noperations. To this end, sufficient institutional development of WUAs and further strengthening \nof the DOWR remain critical.11 Specifically, WUAs need to be empowered as equal partners of \nthe  DOWR,  while  the  DOWR  needs  to  be  transformed  from  an  implementer  of  irrigation \nconstruction  to  an  accountable  service  provider.  An  equally  critical  issue  is  that  existing \ninfrastructure  needs  not  only  rehabilitation  but  also  modernization,  with  clear  operational  rules \nfor efficient water distribution12 before WUAs can take over O&M. This calls for well-sequenced \ninterventions  for  participatory  planning  and  WUA  strengthening,  facility  renovation,  agricultural \nsupport,  and  institutionalization  of  self-sustaining  O&M.  Opportunities  also  exist  to  develop \nWUAs into a platform to drive agricultural development by forming effective links to input supply, \ntechnical  support,  and  marketing.  Similarly,  the  institutional  basis  for  PIM  needs  to  be  further \nadvanced, along with the framework for IWRM that needs to guide improved service delivery.  \n\n11. \nInvestment  Plan  for  Irrigation  Scheme  Modernization.  In  line  with  the  above \ninitiatives,  the  OSG\u2019s  State  Water  Plan  has  prioritized  improving  the  productivity  and \nsustainability  of  existing  underutilized  irrigation  infrastructure  by  adopting  PIM  with  WUA \ndevelopment as the critical step towards attaining sustainable water resources management. A \nspecific  investment  plan  of  $660  million  (Appendix  2,  Table  A2.1)  has  been  prepared  by  the \nDOWR  as  a  priority  program  for  the  11th  FYP.  The  proposed  Investment  Program  has  been \nformulated  to  implement  this  plan,  covering  major  and  medium-sized  irrigation  schemes  and \nminor lift schemes in the four northern river basins and a part of the Mahanadi River Delta. The \nremaining  schemes  are  implemented  with  the  support  of  the  Government  and  other  external \nfinanciers.13 The Investment Program aims to intensify and diversify agriculture with a focus on \nhigh-value  crops.  It  will  also  support  participatory  and  integrated  basin  planning  and  relevant \ninstitutional development towards IWRM, following the framework of the State Water Plan.  \n\n12. \nPolicy  and  Institutional  Development  Actions.  To support the implementation of the \nInvestment  Plan,  the  OSG  has  taken  initiatives  to  further  improve  policy,  planning,  and \ninstitutional frameworks. First, the revised State Water Policy was adopted in 2007, reaffirming \nthe OSG\u2019s resolve to pursue PIM with full O&M cost recovery by users while initiating specific \nsteps  to  introduce  IWRM.  Second,  the  DOWR  is  establishing  a  specialized  multidisciplinary \ndirectorate for PIM, with actions developed to improve its business processes and capacities as \na  multidisciplinary  service-oriented  agency.  Third,  the  OSG  has  taken  steps  to  enhance  O&M \nfund  allocation  complying  with  the  Government\u2019s  12th  Finance  Commission,  and  is  revising \nwater tariffs for the industry sector to meet the increased allocation. The OSG will also improve \nits  management  system  and  take  steps  to  improve  cost  recovery  rates,  such  as  introducing \ndirect  links  between  tariff  collection  (by  the  Revenue  Department)  and  fund  allocation  (by  the \nDOWR). Fourth, the OSG is refining the existing WUA legal framework for longer-term tenure, \ninstitutional  continuity,  and  better  representation  of  farmers  in  head,  middle,  and  tail-end \nreaches of irrigation canal systems, as well as women. Finally, following the revised State Water \nPolicy,  the  OSG  is  initiating  consultative  steps  towards  establishing  appropriate  IWRM \ninstitutions and instruments, such as a regulatory commission or authority for water tariff setting \nand  water  allocation,  as  well  as  a  pilot  river  basin  organization.  (The  sector  road  map  and \ninvestment plan are shown in Appendix 2.)  \n                                                 \n11  WUAs are legally authorized to undertake irrigation O&M by receiving funds from DOWR (in return for water tariff \npaid) and collecting fees from members. They may also extend their activities to collective agriculture development \nas  a  noncommercial  undertaking.  However,  most  WUAs  remain  at  an  early  stage  of  development  with  limited \nfinancial and physical assets. The progress is also constrained due to limited support funds being made available.  \n12  Including the provision of (i) sufficient water control structures, appropriately sized outlets, and measuring devices; \nand (ii) equipment, communication systems, and supporting software to support the operational plan. Establishing \nagreed water distribution rules and adopting necessary adjustments after initial operations are also critical.     \n\n13  A statewide community tank rehabilitation project has been prepared with World Bank assistance.  \n\n\fLessons  Identified.  The  Investment  Program  has  been  prepared  with  the  exploration \n13. \nand incorporation of best practices and lessons learned from other Indian states and countries \nof Asia.14 While the performance of PIM projects in India including Orissa is generally deemed \nsuccessful, key lessons include (i) a conducive policy and institutional framework with political \nsupport is essential to improve and sustain irrigation embedding PIM; (ii) sustainable O&M with \nuser financing should be pursued with specific actions to improve the management systems; (iii) \nDOWR\u2019s commitment and capacities to establish PIM and to become a service-oriented agency \nshould  be  deepened  with  appropriate  incentives;  (iv)  stringent  planning  is  needed  to  tap \nmaximum growth potentials with links to input delivery, technical support, and output marketing; \n(v)  WUAs  need  to  be  developed  early  in  the  project  cycle  with  clear  targets  and  continuous \nsupport;  (vi)  critical  attention  is  needed  to  deliver  quality  infrastructure  and  set  up  sound \noperational rules; (vii) field channels should be pursued as an integral part of the program; (viii) \nWUAs  are  generally  willing  to  expand  their  tasks  beyond  irrigation  O&M  to  facilitate  collective \nagricultural  development;  (ix)  an  effective  interagency  coordination  mechanism  should  be  in \nplace with the involvement of district heads; and (x) with due capacity development, NGOs and \nprivate providers can be used for program delivery such as WUA strengthening and agriculture \nextension. (External assistance and lessons learned are shown in Appendixes 3 and 4.) \n\nADB\u2019s  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for India 2003\u2013200615 expanded \n14. \nADB\u2019s operations in agriculture, irrigation, and rural infrastructure as its most important feature \nto address the country\u2019s rural poverty problems and looming water crisis. This was followed by \nsector  studies  to  accumulate  a  sector  knowledgebase  and  disseminate  best  practices  and \nlessons  (footnote  14),  based  on  which  opportunities  for  supporting  PIM  were  identified  as  a \npriority area of ADB support, given the country\u2019s vast sector needs, both for finance and transfer \nof  best  practices.  The  new  draft  country  partnership  strategy  for  India  (2008\u20132012)  envisages \nenhanced ADB roles in rural infrastructure development for irrigation, water resources, and rural \nmarket  and  transport  infrastructure.  This  follows  the  Government\u2019s  11th  FYP  that  places \nemphasis  on  addressing  the  regional  and  rural\u2013urban  disparities.  Within  this  context,  the \nInvestment  Program  is  needed  to  institutionalize  PIM  and  to  improve  irrigation  infrastructure, \nthereby promoting intensive and high-value irrigated agriculture in Orissa. With a primary focus \non  irrigation  infrastructure  and  its  management  system,  it  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Long-\nterm Strategic Framework,16 Water for All Policy,17 and Water Financing Program 2006\u20132010.18  \n\n15.  Multitranche  Financing  Facility.  ADB\u2019s  MFF  modality  is  most  appropriate  for  the \nInvestment Program. Building on the progressively developed policy and institutional bases, an \nMFF provides an opportunity for high implementation quality while reflecting further lessons in \nthe  implementation  design  and  pursuing  further  improvement  of  the  institutional  basis.  These \ncan  be  undertaken  at  the  time  of  processing  subsequent  loans.  It  also  allows  flexibility  in \ninvestment decision making based on subproject readiness. Higher incentives will be provided \nto the concerned parties to ensure sufficient implementation performance. The MFF also allows \na longer-term partnership with sufficient monitoring of critical institutional development process \nwith  continued  dialogue.  Its  progressive  commitment  structure  also  facilitates  wider  area \ncoverage in the Investment Program design, and hence more significant sector impacts.  \n                                                 \n14  ADB  undertook  studies  on  (i)  international  and  Indian  best  practices  on  PIM  and  IWRM,  (ii)  minor  tank  irrigation \nsystems in India, (iii) the Government\u2019s priority programs in the irrigation sector, and (iv) agribusiness development. \nIn  the  meantime,  a  loan  for  Chhattisgarh  to  support  minor  irrigation  infrastructure  renovation  with  PIM  was \napproved in 2005, for which project preparatory TA outputs and initial implementation experience were explored.   \n\n15 ADB. 2003.

The \noutcome  will  be  enhanced  productivity,  water  use  efficiency,  sustainability  of  irrigated \nagriculture,  and  improved  performance  of  irrigation  service  delivery  and  water  resources \nmanagement with empowered WUAs progressively taking over O&M roles.   \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Productive and Sustainable Irrigated Agriculture Management \nSystems  \n\n17. \nThis  component  will  establish  productive  and  sustainable  irrigation  systems  through \nWUA  strengthening,  renovation  of  irrigation  and  associated  infrastructure,  agriculture  and \nlivelihood support services, and O&M support. The Investment Program will cover six major and \nnine  medium-sized  existing  and  low-performing  irrigation  schemes  (having  a  NIA  of  185,000 \nha), and about 1,400 existing community-based minor lift irrigation (MLI) schemes (having a NIA \nof 30,000 ha).19 The following subcomponents are provided, aligned in a step-by-step process \nof implementation. In principle, substantial WUA strengthening and participatory planning will be \npursued up front with performance targets set and achieved before infrastructure is provided.   \n\na. \n\nParticipatory Planning and Water User Association Empowerment  \n\n18. \nParticipatory Scheme Planning. Following the planning documents prepared under the \npreceding  technical  assistance  (footnote  1),  the  Investment  Program  will  support  participatory \nfeasibility studies including subproject implementation plans (SIPs) for the irrigation schemes in \nconsultation with the WUAs. The SIP will stipulate specific programs and output targets for the \nscheme  while  meeting  any  safeguards  requirements.  All  subprojects  will  be  appraised  and \ncleared  by  the  OSG,  the  Government  of  India,  and  ADB  prior  to  their inclusion  in the  periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) of the MFF tranche.20  \n\n19.  WUA Micro Planning. For major and medium-sized schemes, the planning process has \ntwo tiers: scheme planning (completed prior to the PFR), and WUA micro planning. The former \nwill provide an overall framework for the scheme, including the main infrastructure, whereas the \nlatter will detail WUA implementation plans for minor infrastructure, command area development \n(CAD), agriculture, livelihood, and O&M. A multidisciplinary team including NGO staff and local \nfacilitators will be designated to prepare the plan with individual WUAs.  \n\n20.  WUA  Strengthening  and  Empowerment.  The  Investment  Program  will  strengthen \nWUAs  to  manage  planning,  construction,  and O&M  as  an  equal partner  of  the  DOWR.  WUAs \nwill  undertake  effective  organizational,  operational,  resource  mobilization,  and  networking \nfunctions as a platform to advance the development of irrigated agriculture. Specific targets will \nbe  set  and  achieved,  including  membership  enrollment  of  more  than  70%  of  farmers,  election \nand  formation  of  an  executive  committee  and  subcommittees,  and  implementation  of  routine \nO&M. Upon achieving the targets, implementation of the micro plan activities will be started. \n                                                 \n19 It will also include other major and medium-sized schemes that are functional but require WUA strengthening and \n\nminor facility refinement, and minor creek irrigation schemes, covering an additional 20,000 ha. \n\n20 Excluding the MLI schemes where subprojects are implemented in a process-type approach.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nb. \n\nIrrigation and Associated Infrastructure Development \n\n21. \nIrrigation  and  Associated  Infrastructure.  The  Investment  Program  will  renovate  and \nextend infrastructure21\u2014including repair of reservoirs, renovation of head and cross regulators, \ncanals,  and  ancillary  facilities;  and  minor  drainage  works\u2014along  with  the  community-based \nminor lift irrigation facilities. For major and medium-sized schemes, main facilities requiring early \ncompletion  to  ensure  timely  delivery  of  benefits  across  the  command  area  are  implemented \nfollowing  the  SIPs,22 whereas  other  facilities  are  implemented  upon  achievement  of  the  WUA \ndevelopment  targets.  Scheme  renovation  will  upgrade  the  system  with  sufficient  water  control \nstructures  and  adequately  sized  outlets \nimproved  distribution  efficiency. \nCommunications  equipment  and  software  will  be  provided  to  ensure  sound  operation  at  the \nscheme and individual WUA levels. During the process, WUAs will be made aware of seasonal \nwater  entitlements  with  the  provision  of  measuring  devices  to  monitor  and  coordinate  the \ndelivery of the set discharges. Construction quality will be monitored by the WUAs. WUAs will \nalso be involved in the implementation of the minor works within their constituencies.  \n\nto  support \n\nCommand  Area  Development  and  Conjunctive  Use.  The  Investment  Program  will \n22. \nemphasize the placing of field channel systems and the strengthening of WUA capacities for on-\nfarm  water  management  as  essential  conditions  to  attain  high  water-use  efficiency  and \nintensification  and  diversification  of  cropping.  Specific  plans  will  be  laid  out  in  the  micro  plan. \nThe  concerned  WUAs  will  implement  the  minor  CAD  facilities.  With  the  use  of  field  channel \nsystems,  conjunctive  use  of  groundwater  will  be  promoted  for  dry  season  cropping,  with \ngroundwater  surveys,  information  campaigns  for  private  investments  in  groundwater  irrigation, \nand provision of pilot wells targeted to marginal farmer groups in the canal tail end areas.23   \n\n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nAgriculture and Allied Sector Support, and Livelihood Enhancement \n\n23. \nAgriculture  and  Horticulture  Development.  The  Investment  Program  will  support \nagriculture and horticulture development with WUA capacity development as a platform to plan, \ncoordinate, and arrange for the program implementation. Specific programs will be prepared in \nconformity  with  the  existing  district  agricultural  plans  and  stipulated  in  the  WUA  micro  plans. \nThis  subcomponent  will  cover  (i)  production  systems  including  farmer  field  schools  for  crop \nintensification and diversification, soil nutrient management, seed multiplication, and integrated \npest  management;  and  (ii)  formation  of  links  with  input  suppliers  and  marketing  chains  with \nmarket  intelligence,  such  as  catalogues  for  existing  organizations  and  their  programs.24 New \ntechnologies and approaches (e.g., system of rice intensification, participatory variety selection, \nand  farmer  producer  companies)  will  be  introduced  and  expanded  upon  demonstration  of \npositive  impacts.  Participatory  technology  development  of  other  innovations  (e.g.,  aerobic  rice \nand  rice\u2013fish  integrated  farming)  will  also  be  implemented  in  partnership  with  local  research \nagencies. These will be delivered by the resource persons of the line departments, the private \nsector,  or  NGOs  arranged  through  the  implementation  team.  WUAs  will  sustain  activities \nthrough their trained extensionists who will form regular links with the relevant institutions.25  \n\n                                                 \n21  All schemes need to renovate the existing infrastructure, except for one major scheme, Mahanadi Chitropala Island \nIrrigation (MCII) scheme, which will expand the existing canal system to create an additional 6,000 ha of irrigated \narea to complete its original scope.  \n\n22  That is, in parallel to the WUA micro planning and strengthening process.  \n23  CAD will be primarily implemented through existing government programs, whereas provision under the Investment \n\nProgram will also be kept for support where government programs are not readily made available. \n\n24 Resources for existing state and other programs will be sought prior to accessing Investment Program funding.   \n25  Demonstration works will be undertaken with a focus on the land plots of marginal farmers.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fLivelihood  Enhancement  Support.  The  Investment  Program  will  also  support  the \n24. \nformation  of  links  between  the  vulnerable  groups  within  the  WUA  area  and  the  existing \nprograms for poverty reduction, such as forming self-help groups and facilitating delivery of rural \ncredit  and  training  for  income  generation.  While  primary  efforts  will  be  made  to  deliver  the \nagriculture and horticulture support services to these vulnerable groups, provisions targeted for \nskills  development  of  these  groups\u2014such  as  fisheries,  fodder  planting  along  the  water \nchannels, livestock,  organic  fertilizer  production,  group  cultivation  through  leasing of  land,  and \ncommunity-based participatory works26\u2014are also included in the Investment Program. \n\n \n\n \n\nd. \n\nSustainable Operation and Maintenance System \n\n25.  Minor  Facilities.  The  Investment  Program  will  institutionalize  sustainable  O&M  for  the \nirrigation  schemes.  At  present,  the  facilities  are  classified  into  those  managed  jointly  by  the \nDOWR  and  WUAs  (project  committees  at  main  canal  level,  and  distributary  committees  at \nsecondary  canal  level),  and  minor  facilities  for  which  O&M  is  transferred  to  WUAs.  Under  the \nInvestment Program, WUA capacities to sustain minor facilities will be set up first. This will be \nattained by forming water management subcommittees and preparing the O&M plans during the \nmicro plan stage, and engaging subcommittees in implementing the works. Upon completion of \nthe  civil  works,  training  will  be  provided  to  (i)  prepare  and  implement  operational  plans;  and \n(ii) undertake  joint  walk-throughs  of  canals  to  identify  and  plan  maintenance  works.  For  major \nand medium-sized schemes, WUAs will implement the maintenance plan with grants provided \nby the DOWR. If grants are insufficient, WUAs will mobilize funds from their members. As to the \nminor lift schemes, WUAs will mobilize all resources from members to implement the plan.27  \n\n26.  Main  and  Secondary  Facilities.  At  the  higher  levels  of  major  and  medium-sized \nschemes, participatory joint management systems will be established between the DOWR and \nthe  WUA  committees,  which  will  jointly  prepare  and  implement  system  operational  plans  on  a \nseasonal basis. Maintenance plans will also be prepared through joint canal walk-throughs and \nthe demands from lower-tier WUAs, and implemented with the allocated funds from the DOWR. \nGuidelines for O&M performance monitoring, planning, and fund allocation will be established to \nguide the process, along with a scheme-wise management information system (MIS). Over the \nyears, the Investment Program will pursue further O&M transfer of these larger facilities to the \nWUAs, leaving the role of the DOWR in these schemes to bulk water delivery.  \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Institutional Strengthening and Project Management \n\nThis  component  comprises  (i)  institutional  strengthening  for  PIM  and  IWRM,  and  (ii) \n27. \nInvestment  Program  management.  Necessary  hardware  and  software  (civil  works  for  office \nrefurbishment and extension, vehicles and equipment, consultants, and incremental operational \ncosts) will be provided to support these activities.28  \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\n28. \nParticipatory Irrigation Management. This subcomponent will establish self-sustaining \nmechanisms for developing and delivering accountable irrigation services with the strengthening \nof the relevant institutions. Specifically, this will include (i) putting into operation the new PIM-\n\n                                                 \n26 A separate program to develop WUA capacities to enhance the livelihoods of the poor is also being prepared for \n\npossible Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction funding.  \n\n27 Responsibilities  for  fee  collection  have  also  been  transferred  to  minor  lift  WUAs,  who  are  also  responsible  for  all \nrepairs and future replacement of assets. They will also establish and build up a reserve fund to meet the purpose. \n\n28A capacity-development plan applied to the relevant institutions has been prepared (Supplementary Appendix B). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fCAD  directorate  of  the  DOWR;  (ii)  establishing  upgraded  O&M  guidelines  and  the  MIS  for \nscheme  O&M  performance  monitoring  and  planning;  (iii)  operationalizing  a  third-party  internal \ntechnical auditing using externally hired experts; (iv) developing and delivering training for staff \nand  WUAs;29 (v)  undertaking  information,  education,  and  communication  campaigns  for  PIM; \n(vi)  advising  on  implementing  the  institutional  actions  specified  in  the  road  map  (Appendix  2); \nand  (vii)  setting  up  staff  incentive  and  performance  evaluation  systems  to  internalize  PIM. \nOverall performance and achievements will be measured through WUA satisfaction surveys at \nthe subproject level. The Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI) will be strengthened \nwith reforms with (i) upgrading of training programs, (ii) developing up-to-date knowledge base \nlearning from best practices; and (iii) twinning with a reputed international institute.30  \n\n29. \nIntegrated  Water  Resources  Management.  In  accordance  with  the  road  map,  this \nsubcomponent  will  support  (i)  studies  to  assess  appropriate  IWRM  functions  and  institutional \narrangements for setting up a commission for water tariff fixation and other regulatory functions \nsuch  as  water  allocation  and  entitlement;  (ii)  preparation  of  multisector  river  basin  plans  with \nestablishment of participatory river basin organizations, initially in the Baitarani River basin as a \npilot; (iii) strengthening of the hydrological database and decision support systems; and (iv) staff \ntraining on IWRM, basin planning, and associated analytical methodologies.  \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nProject Management  \n\nThis  subcomponent  will  operate \n\nthe  program  management  system \n\n30. \nthrough  a \nmultidisciplinary project management unit (PMU) and subproject implementation offices (SIOs) \ncomprising the OSG and outsourced experts, consultants, and NGOs. The Investment Program \nwill  be  implemented  with  a  participatory  decision-making  system  with  WUAs.  The  WUAs  are \ntrained  to  jointly  make  decisions  with  SIOs  on  the  subproject  planning,  implementation,  and \nO&M, based on which specific works will be implemented by the responsible organizations, and \nmonitored by the WUAs. This will be supported by (i) the project-specific MIS and quality control \nsystem that ensures due recording and reporting at SIO on institutional, physical, financial and \nother  progress  against  the  set  targets  specified  in  the  SIPs;  and  (ii)  regular  PMU\u2013SIO  review \nmeetings.  This  subcomponent  will  also  support  the  consulting  services  for  preparing  further \nschemes for the subsequent tranches, and implementation performance review.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n31. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  introduce  effective  irrigation  service  delivery  to  enhance \nefficiency,  productivity,  and  sustainability  in  water  use  by  implementing  key  policy  principles, \nfurthering reforms for improved sector governance, and by incorporating the following lessons:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Investment Program will implement the key principles of the NWP 2002 and \nState Water Policy 2007, in particular by making PIM fully operational in the low-\nperforming irrigation schemes, with associated institutional reforms owned by the \nOSG, which are in line with ADB\u2019s Water Policy (footnote 17).  \nIts  components  are  designed  consistently  with  step-by-step  implementation \nprocedures  to  establish  PIM-based  productive  agriculture,  incorporating  best \npractices collected through national and international studies (Appendix 4).   \n\n                                                 \n29 The  specific  training  subjects  include  participatory  planning,  WUA  development,  design  and  construction \n\nmanagement, quality control, O&M, PIM, resettlement, environmental management, and support services. \n\n30 WALMI  is  an  autonomous  training  and  research  institute  for  PIM  and  IWRM  under  the  DOWR.  Subject  to  the \nimplementation of the reforms for higher autonomy and staff quality, WALMI will provide necessary technical and \ninstitutional  backup  and  training  support  for  PIM  and  IWRM.  The  Investment  Program  will  consider  providing  a \ncorpus fund in its subsequent loan by establishing an arrangement acceptable to ADB.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nIn  contrast  to  conventional  projects,  the  program  has  a  specific  focus  on \nextending  field  channel  networks  (to  convert  field-to-field  flood  irrigation  into  a \nmore  efficient  plot-to-plot  irrigation  through  channel  turn-outs)  and  promoting \nconjunctive  use  of  groundwater,  as  essential  elements  for  improving  water-use \nefficiency, crop intensification, and diversification.  \nIt  will  empower  WUAs  to  progressively  take  on  O&M  and  implementation  roles, \nwith  their  capacity  developed  to  facilitate  links  and  bargaining  power  in  input \ndelivery,  technology  extension,  and  product  marketing  to  achieve  productive \nagriculture.  \nThe  efforts  of  institutionalizing  PIM  is  ongoing  as  a  national  priority,  yet  the \nprocess  is  still  at  an  intermediate  stage  and  needs  to  be  strengthened  by \nincorporating  lessons.  The  MFF  modality  allows  flexibility  to  refine  the  process, \nand is suited to pursue the agenda with progressively improved arrangements. \n\nD. \n\nProgram Investment and Financing Plan \n\nThe Investment Program. The investment cost is estimated at $268.8 million (Table 1). \n\n32. \nThis includes taxes and duties of $11.1 million to be financed by the Government.  \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n\nAmount ($ million)\n\nProject Components\nI.

The  DOWR  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the \n35. \nInvestment  Program.  A  state  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  agriculture  production \ncommissioner or an officer not below the rank of secretary has been set up for policy guidance \nand interdepartmental coordination. Its implementation institutionalizes effective mechanisms to \nplan,  improve,  and  manage  irrigation  systems  through  the  DOWR\u2019s  regular  setup,  with \noutsourcing  to  the  private  sector  and  NGOs.  The  DOWR  has  established  a  permanent \nmultidisciplinary  PIM-CAD  directorate  to  monitor,  guide,  implement,  and  coordinate  PIM  and \nrelated integrated development services for the entire state. A PMU has been established in the \ndirectorate with  the  assignment  of  a  full-time  program  director  with  the  rank  of  chief  engineer. \nThe PMU has a multidisciplinary structure comprising staff from the  DOWR, line  departments, \nand  those  recruited  from  the  market, 35  and  is  assisted  by  consultants  for  institutional \nstrengthening and project management (ISPM). The organization structure is in Appendix 6.  \n\nIn \n\nimplementation, \n\nInvestment  Program \n\nfeasibility  studies  and  endorse  subproject  appraisal  reports \n\n36. \nthe  PMU  will  (i)  prepare  an  overall \nimplementation plan and annual project budget; (ii) coordinate with other departments; (iii) guide \nthe \nincluding  safeguards \ndocuments;  (iv)  monitor  and  guide  the  activities  of  the  SIOs  on  subproject  planning, \nimplementation, and O&M; (v) manage and guide safeguards action plans and implementation; \n(vi) monitor project progress and evaluate project benefits and social and environmental impacts \nwith  the  MIS;  (vii)  arrange  necessary  training  programs  for  staff  and  other  providers;  (viii) \nmanage  procurement,  consulting  and  NGO  services,  and  loan  disbursement;  (ix) maintain \nfinancial accounts; and (x) prepare periodic implementation progress reports.  \n\n37. \nTo implement a total of 15 major and medium-sized schemes, 12 SIOs will be set up in \nthe existing DOWR field offices enhanced with cells for WUA support and CAD. Each SIO will \nbe  headed  by  a  subproject  manager  with  the  rank  of  superintending  engineer  (or  executive \nengineer  for  medium-sized  schemes).  It  will  be  assisted  by  an  NGO  team  led  by  a  team \ncoordinator  and  including  mobile  NGO  support  service  teams  (comprising  experts  on \ninstitutional development, water management, and agriculture) and locally engaged community \norganizers. The  SIOs  will  (i) prepare  an  annual  work  plan  endorsed  by  the  PMU;  (ii)  establish \nand  operate  (a)  coordination  systems  through  a  district  coordination  committee  headed  by  a \ndistrict  head,  (b)  a  participatory  decision-making  with  WUAs  on  subproject  implementation \nmatters, and (c) reporting systems on physical, institutional, and other progress and impacts; (iii) \nprovide inputs to subproject planning and design processes; (iv) undertake WUA strengthening \nand micro planning; (v) implement safeguards actions following the relevant plans;36 (vi) execute \ncivil  works;  (vii) coordinate  and/or  implement  support  services  for  agriculture  and  livelihoods; \n(viii) manage  subproject  O&M  in  collaboration  with  WUAs  while  ensuring  the  capacities  and \nresources for the latter; and (ix) arrange training programs for staff, NGOs, and WUAs.  \n\n38. \nFor  implementing  community-based  minor  lift  schemes,  the  PMU  will  have  a  lift \nirrigation cell comprising an engineer in lift irrigation, an economist, and three mobile planning teams \n                                                 \n34  Implementation  arrangements  have  drawn  lessons  from  the  models  followed  in  Orissa,  other  Indian  states,  and \nAsian  countries,  and  incorporated  necessary  improvements  such  as  sufficiency  in  WUA  institutional  support, \nsoundness in process management and quality control, and effective use of outsourcing.  \n\n35 Including project planning, design, lift irrigation, implementation, quality control, WUA mobilization, agriculture and \n\nallied sectors, economics, environment, resettlement and rehabilitation, and vulnerable groups.  \n\n36  The deputy subproject manager will be assigned as chief officer for environmental management, resettlement, and \n\nvulnerable peoples to undertake the required tasks through the designated SIO staff.  \n\n \n\n\fincluding  a  lift  irrigation  engineer  and  an  agricultural  specialist.  They  will  be  entrusted  with \nprocurement of equipment and goods, and subproject feasibility studies. At the field level, up to \nfour mobile SIOs will be set up, comprising a PIM specialist (assigned as subproject manager), \nirrigation engineer, agriculture engineer, work inspector, and monitoring and evaluation officer. \nThe  lift  irrigation  cell  and  SIO  staff  are  primarily  engaged  from  a  local  firm  as  implementation \nconsultants, who will also be associated with local NGOs to mobilize field facilitators to support \ninstitution building and coordination for program delivery on the ground.  \n\nSubproject  Selection  Criteria  and  Implementation  Procedure.  All subprojects to be \n39. \nincluded  under  the  Investment  Program  will  meet  the  selection  criteria  shown  in  Appendix  7, \nincluding  (i)  water  availability;  (ii)  technical,  social,  institutional,  and  economic  feasibility; \n(iv)  compliance  with  safeguards \n(iii) insignificant  social  and  environmental \nthe  set  beneficiary  contribution \n(v)  endorsement  by  WUAs \nrequirements; \nrequirements;  and  (vi)  proposal  clearance  by  the  Government  as  applicable.  Implementation \nprocedures for individual subprojects are outlined in Appendix 8.  \n\nimpacts; \nincluding \n\nInvestment  Program  Management.  The  five  major  and  medium-sized  subprojects \n40. \nproposed for project 1 were studied under the TA (footnote 1) and appraised by the OSG, the \nGovernment, and ADB, along with two sample minor lift irrigation schemes. The PMU, with the \nsupport of the ISPM consultants, will prepare further subprojects proposed for the subsequent \nprojects. At that time the PMU will also assess the implementation progress and performance of \nthe ongoing project(s). This will cover the policy and institutional actions, progress in achieving \nthe  capacity  development  and  other \nin  safeguards \nmanagement.  On  the  basis  of  these,  specific  measures  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of \ninterventions  will  be  identified  for  incorporation  into  the  subsequent  project.  ADB  will  provide \nadvice to the OSG and the Government while the work is being carried out. After ADB appraisal, \nthe  Government  will  submit  a  PFR  of  the  project,  together  with  the  appraisal  reports  of  new \nsubprojects and the Investment Program performance assessment report.  \n\nlessons,  and  compliance \n\ntargets, \n\n41. \nSustainable O&M. In Orissa, water tariffs are collected by the Revenue Department and \nallocated to individual schemes and WUAs by the DOWR from OSG funds, except for minor lift \nschemes, where responsibility for fee collection is given to WUAs. The OSG has a policy of full \nmaintenance funding with user financing, including (i) allocating O&M funds complying with the \nGovernment\u2019s Finance Commission, and (ii) recovering the cost through tariffs levied to users. \nHowever, there are still gaps. Regarding fund allocation, while the OSG has adopted the 12th \nFinance  Commission  report  and  raised  the  allocation  to  Rs600/ha  from  Rs450/ha  in  FY2005, \nthe funds available to DOWR for works (Rs300/ha) is less than the norm (Rs480/ha) due to the \nhigher establishment cost of the DOWR. As to cost recovery, efforts to increase water tariffs for \nindustries  is  in  progress  to  fully  meet  the  increase  of  allocation  in  FY2005.37 However,  actual \ncollection  for  irrigation  remains  at  about  50%  of  the  requirements,  due  to  large  gaps  between \nthe irrigated areas claimed by the DOWR and certified by the Revenue Department (40%), and \nshortfalls  in  collection  in  the  certified  areas  (10%).  This  reflects  the  poor  performance  of \nirrigation  water  delivery.  There  is  no  link  between  the  tariffs  collected  and  funds  allocated  to \nindividual schemes at present, thereby providing WUAs little incentives for higher payments.  \n\n42. \n To  sustain  O&M,  the  OSG  is  committed  to  revising  funds  allocation  following  future \nFinance Commission reports, and increasing water tariffs including irrigation (with the progress \nof the present efforts to enhance system productivity and farmer incomes with PIM). The DOWR \nis also rationalizing the nontechnical field staff (taking the bulk  of establishment  costs) with \n                                                 \n37  Irrigation tariff rates in Orissa are generally at par with other Indian states, whereas industrial rates are lower than \n\nthe national average, based on which the OSG is now pursuing the tariff increase in industries.  \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nnatural attrition. In the context of the Investment Program, the DOWR will (i) establish a sound \nMIS for O&M monitoring and planning, (ii) introduce a needs- and performance-based allocation \nsystem,  (iii)  operationalize  participatory  decision  making  for  fund  allocation  of  O&M  in  each \nscheme,  and  (iv)  ensure  WUAs  address  any  shortfalls  through  their  own  cash  or  labor \ncontribution. To reduce the shortfalls in cost recovery, the DOWR will (i) enhance the certified \nirrigated  areas  with  improved  irrigation,  (ii)  involve  WUAs  in  the  collection  process,  and  (iii) \nintroduce  direct  links  between  the  O&M  funds  allocated  and  the  water  tariffs  submitted.  An \nappropriate regulatory mechanism for the fixing of water tariffs will also be assessed.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n43. \nThe Investment Program will be implemented over 8 years with four provisional projects \n(Appendix 9) from April 2009 to March 2017, with funds utilized up to September 2017. Project 1 \ncomprises mainly consulting and NGO services, equipment, and civil works for two major and \nthree  medium-sized  irrigation  schemes,  and  about  650  minor  lift  irrigation  schemes.  These \nsubprojects  were  selected  based  on  implementation  readiness  and  their  representative \ncharacter.38 The ISPM support will continue over the entire period, and emphasis is placed on \nachieving the progressive reform milestones as set forth in the sector road map (Appendix 2).  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services \n\n44. \nProcurement.  Procurement  to  be  financed  from  the  ADB  loans  under  the  MFF  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  will  be  followed  for  civil  work  contracts  costing \n$10 million or more. Civil works contracts costing less than $10 million will be procured through \nnational  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  ADB  standard  bidding  documents  with  post-qualification \nunder the two-envelope system will be adopted. In addition, small community works costing less \nthan  $10,000  may  be  directly  contracted  with  the  concerned  WUA  that  has  participated  in  the \nplanning  and  design  and  will  take  over  O&M.39 In  procuring  goods  and  related  services,  ICB \nprocedures  will  be  used  if  the  estimated  cost  is  at  least  $1  million  and  NCB  procedures  if  the \ncost  is  between  $0.1  million  and  $1  million,  and  shopping  if  the  estimated  contract  amount  is \nless than $0.1 million. The detailed procurement plan for Project 1 is shown in Appendix 10.  \n\n45. \nConsulting  Services.  The  Investment  Program  provides  for  the  following  consultancy \nservices: (i) ISPM consultancy including program administration (including the institutionalization \nof the PIM process and steps for IWRM, and monitoring and evaluation) and subsequent Project \npreparation (including safeguards aspects) (158 person-months of international and 738 person-\nmonths  of  national  consultants);  and  (ii)  implementation  support  consultancy  for  minor  lift \nirrigation  schemes  (1,080  person-months  of  national  consultants).  NGOs  will  be  engaged  to \nsupport  WUA  strengthening,  and  to  facilitate  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  PMU  will \nselect  and  engage  the  consultants  and  NGOs  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures. In addition, NGOs, independent agencies, institutions, and resource persons will be \nhired  for  monitoring  and  program  delivery  activities  such  as  training.  WALMI  will  be  engaged \nthrough  direct  contracting  to  undertake  specialized  training  and  action  research  for  PIM  and \n                                                 \n38 The major and medium-sized subprojects will be implemented over 6 years (except for O&M that extends to year \n8).They are also divided into three tranches, broadly comprising (i) WUA strengthening (phase 1) and civil  works \ncanal systems; (ii) WUA strengthening (phase 2) and remaining minor works such as command area development, \nagriculture, and O&M support; and (iii) all remaining activities. The division into separate phases will facilitate the \nincorporation of findings and lessons based on the performance evaluation of the preceding phase.  \n\n39 This will contribute to stronger ownership by the WUA to take over O&M. In addition, the community participation \nmodality will also be undertaken for civil works and procurement of goods and services valued less than $10,000 \nduring the first project as a pilot, with procedures and arrangements acceptable to ADB.  \n\n\fIWRM.40 All consultants, NGOs, other institutions, and resource persons will be hired following \nthe ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).41  \n\n46. \nAdvance  Contracting  and  Retroactive  Financing.  The  Government  has  requested \nadvance  contracting  for  consultant  and  NGO  engagement  and  for  procurement  of  goods  and \ncivil  works,  and  retroactive  financing  under  the  MFF.  ADB  Management  has  agreed  to  seek \nBoard approval for retroactive financing provided that the total eligible expenditure under such \nfinancing will not exceed an amount equivalent to 20% of the individual loans, and must have \nbeen  incurred  not  more  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  relevant  legal  agreements. \nThe  Government  has  been  informed  that  the  approval  of  advance  action  and  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the relevant projects under the Investment Program. \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n47. \nDisbursement  of  loan  proceeds  under  the  MFF  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Each loan under the MFF will \nhave its own imprest account in the Reserve Bank of India. The state, through the DOWR, may \nestablish a second-generation imprest account (SGIA) for each loan in a current account with a \ncommercial  bank.  The  DOWR  will  be  responsible  for  administering  and  managing  the  imprest \naccount and the SGIA will be equivalent to 6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the \nrelevant  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  Individual  payments  under  the  statement  of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedure will be $100,000. \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n\n48. \nThe  Government  and  OSG  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency,  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program  shall  adhere to  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy. ADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Investment  Program.  In  this \nregard,  investigation  of  government  officials,  if  any,  would  be  requested  by  ADB  to  be \nundertaken  by  the  Government.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. \n\n49. \nGood  governance  is  an  essential  element  for  ensuring  and  sustaining  the  intended \nbenefits  from  irrigation  infrastructure  renovation  with  PIM.  In  this  context,  ADB  has  also \nassessed  the  financial  management  system  of  the  DOWR. 42 The  Investment  Program  has \nincorporated  measures  for  ensuring  accountability  and  transparency,  with  a  pursuit  of \nparticipatory management of processes and outputs with quality control mechanisms (Appendix \n8, Table A8). Specifically, subprojects are prepared by setting out clear input and output targets \nin SIPs and WUA micro plans, and progressively implemented by confirming that the set targets \nare achieved at each stage, including up-front strengthening of WUAs. WUAs are empowered to \nparticipate in all decision making, such as endorsing micro plans and periodic work plans. \nProgram expenditures including the civil work scope, quantity, cost, and contractors will be  \n\n                                                 \n40  WALMI is an autonomous body under the DOWR and a sole agency designated for in-house training for OSG staff, \nproviders, and WUAs on PIM and associated research. Their engagement is critical to permanently institute PIM.     \n\n41 Outline terms of reference for the consultancy services and NGOs are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n42  Shown in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fposted  at  the  subproject  sites,  which  will  be  monitored  by  trained  WUA  members  and  quality \nmonitors  of  the  consultants.  With  awareness  campaigns,  grievance  reporting  and  redressal \nmechanisms will be operated through grievance officers. In addition, the DOWR will (i) annually \nundertake, through its internal audit wing, full financial audit of SIOs and the PMU, inspecting all \nfinancial  transactions;  and  (ii)  establish  an  internal  third-party  technical  audit  mechanism \nthrough DOWR\u2019s newly created quality control cell, with the support of the ISPM consultants.    \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n50. \nThe  DOWR,  through  the  PMU,  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  records  for  works, \ngoods,  and  services  financed  out  of  loan  proceeds.  The  DOWR  will  also  maintain  separate \nproject  accounts  according  to  generally  acceptable  accounting  principles  for  all  expenditures \nincurred under the MFF and the Projects, whether out of loan proceeds or other sources. The \nDOWR  will  record  in  a  transparent  manner  all  funds  received  from  the  OSG,  ADB,  and \nbeneficiaries.  Detailed  consolidated  annual  project  accounts  as  maintained  by  the  DOWR \nthrough the PMU will be audited by independent auditors whose qualifications, experience, and \nterms of reference are acceptable to ADB, and will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the \nend of the fiscal year. The annual audit report will include the audit of the imprest account, the \nSGIA,  and  the  SOE  procedure,  and  will  include  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds, the operation of the SGIA, and compliance with SOE procedures and loan covenants. \nThe DOWR has been made aware of ADB\u2019s policy regarding the delayed submission of audits \nand the requirements for a satisfactory and acceptable audit of accounts.  \n\n7. \n\nInvestment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n51. \nThe DOWR will establish an investment program and road map performance monitoring \nsystem acceptable to ADB within 3 months of the effectiveness of the first loan. The system will \nfirst  select  a  set  of  results-based  performance  monitoring  indicators  relating  to  physical \ninstitutional  development,  and  socioeconomic  and  other  conditions \nimplementation, \n(disaggregated into gender and other social classes), including those set out in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). The DOWR will establish baseline data within 6 months of \nthe  date  the  first  Project  takes  effect.  Following  that,  the  DOWR  will  conduct  annual  surveys \nthrough  the  consultants  and  NGOs,  and  update  the  OSG  and  ADB  on  the  progress  against \neach indicator. The DOWR will also provide the Government and ADB with quarterly progress \nreports in the format to be attached with the MFF administration memorandum, within 30 days \nof the end of each quarter. The report will cover the indicators as specified in the performance \nthe \nmonitoring  system,  and \nimplementation.  The  monitoring  report  will  also  be  used  for  shaping  the  subprojects  to  be \ndeveloped for succeeding PFRs and loan tranches. Prior to submitting individual PFRs, a report \nwill also be prepared to review program progress and performance (para. 40). A further detailed \nstudy will be conducted prior to the midterm review. Within 3 months of physical completion of \nany  loan  under  the  MFF,  the  OSG  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report.  Within  3 \nmonths of the completion of the MFF, the OSG will submit to ADB a program completion report. \n\nthe  effectiveness  of \n\nrecommendations \n\nfor  enhancing \n\n8. \n\nInvestment Program Review \n\n52. \nThe  Investment  Program\u2019s  performance  will  be  reviewed  monthly  at  the  field  level \nthrough regular SIO\u2013WUA meetings where the progress of field activities will be assessed, and \nwork  plans  for  the  subsequent  period  decided.  The  PMU  will  also  organize  PMU\u2013SIO  review \nmeetings, which will be reflected in the quarterly progress reports. At the country level, progress \nis to be reviewed by tripartite project review meetings chaired by the Government and attended  \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nby the DOWR and ADB. ADB will undertake Investment Program review twice a year, covering \nthe  performance  of  the  DOWR  and  other  institutions,  loan  covenants,  and  physical  and \nnonphysical progress of implementation. Prior to the submission of individual PFRs, a detailed \nreview  of  the  Investment  Program  performance  will  also  be  undertaken.  A  comprehensive \nmidterm review will be done in year 4 (possibly coinciding with the review of the draft PFR for \nthe third project) to evaluate the progress of road map actions, performance of the Investment \nProgram institutions, and of all process and output indicators, and future implementation plans. \n\n9. \n\nProject Readiness \n\n53. \nIn  response  to  the  need  for  seamlessly  taking  the  remaining  preparatory  steps  and  to \nlaunch  Investment  Program  activities  after  the  completion  of  the  project  preparatory  TA,    a \ncomponent  TA  project  under  a  TA  cluster  was  provided  to  the  OSG  from  September  2007  to \nJune 2008. 43 It supported (i) initiating steps for institutional reform actions for PIM and IWRM in \nthe road map; (ii) establishment of PIM\u2013CAD directorate, the PMU, and SIOs; (iii) preparation of \ntraining  materials  and  staff  training;  (iv)  preparation  of  implementation  manuals;  (v)  feasibility \nstudies  of  subprojects  for  the  second  PFR;  (vi)  pre-construction  activities  for  the  subprojects \nincluded in project 1; and (vii) advance recruitment of consultants and NGOs.  \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n54. \nA  TA  for  institutional  strengthening  for  IWRM  will  be  provided  in  combination  to  the \nInvestment Program. To be provided as a part of the subcomponent for promoting IWRM (para \n29), it aims to support OSG to initiate specific steps towards establishing and operationalizing \nIWRM  at  state  and  selected  river  basin  levels44 with  stakeholder  consultation  and  awareness, \nand capacity building of the concerned organizations. The total TA cost is $313,000. MTFWFPF \nwill  finance  $250,000  of  the  TA  cost  on  a  grant  basis  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  OSG  will \nfinance the remaining cost of $63,000 (in-kind support).45  \n\nV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\nThe  Investment  Program  will  renovate  and  extend  185,000  ha  of  major  and  medium-\n55. \nsized irrigation systems and 30,000 ha of community-based minor lift irrigation systems, which \nare  currently  low-performing,  potentially  benefiting  about  1.7  million  people.  The  main \nquantifiable benefits will be the increased agriculture production brought about by reliable water \nsupply  and  expansion  of  irrigated  areas  in  the  kharif  (monsoon),  rabi  (winter),  and  summer \nseasons  through  renovated  irrigation  infrastructure  and  improved  operations  of  the  reservoirs \nand water distribution networks including field channels. The generated increased labor demand \nwill  particularly  benefit  the  poor.  Major  quantifiable  benefits  are  shown  in  Appendix  1. \nNonquantifiable benefits include the operation of sound irrigation service delivery systems with \nPIM, improved sector governance pursued through progressive institutional reform actions, and \nfollow-on impacts on nonfarm sectors associated with increased agriculture production.  \n\nEconomic and financial impacts were analyzed for two major schemes (in the Mahanadi \n56. \nRiver Delta), three medium-sized schemes, and two sample minor lift systems (in the northern  \n\n                                                 \n43 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to India for Project Processing and Capacity Development. Manila. The TA was \nfinanced by the Government of the United Kingdom and administered by ADB. The total cost of the component TA \nwas $1.875 million, of which $1.5 million was financed by the Government of the United Kingdom.   \n\n44 Including a pilot river basin organization in the Baitarani River basin.  \n45  The  TA  first  appeared  in  the  business  opportunities  section  of  ADB\u2019s  website  on  31  January  2008.  The  detailed \nactivities,  cost  estimates,  implementation  arrangements,  and  financing  plan  are  available  as  Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nbasins), which are included in the first PFR (summarized in Appendix 11).46 All have year-round \nirrigation  opportunities.  Cropping  intensities  will  increase  from  165%  to  173%  for  the  major \nrenovation scheme and from 128% to 183% for the major extension scheme, by 20%\u201335% for \nmedium-sized schemes from the present level (125%\u2013150%), and up to 220%\u2013230% for minor \nlift  schemes  through  full  operation  of  the  pumps.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR), \nestimated by incorporating the yield increase and modest crop diversification observed in similar \ninterventions, is 18.8% for the major extension scheme, 19.7%\u201322.7% for major and medium-\nsized  renovation  schemes,  and  30.1%  and  38.2%  for  the  two  minor  lift  schemes.  Sensitivity \nanalyses to test the impacts of a range of risks, including adverse changes in investment costs, \noutput  prices,  and  yields,  showed  that  project  returns  are  generally  robust.  The  greatest  risk \nappears to be reduction of crop prices, but even in this case a drop of 31% in the price of non-\ncereals will still produce an EIRR of 12% in the subproject with the lowest EIRR. \n\n57. \nThe OSG will bear most of the investment costs in line with the State Water Policy 2007, \nwhile seeking farmer contributions of 5% of the cost of minor facilities to be managed by WUAs, \n10% for CAD, and 20% for minor lift works. For O&M, the OSG collects the set water tariff for \nthe  major  and  medium-sized  schemes  and  allocates  funds  to  individual  schemes,  while  O&M \nincluding fee collection is also transferred to the WUAs for minor lift schemes. The investment \ncontribution  remains  at  about  6%\u201315%  of  incremental  income  for  major  and  medium-sized \nschemes and 25%\u201335% for minor lift schemes, whereas the O&M contribution will be at 3%\u20136% \nof incremental income for major and medium schemes and 9%\u201317% for minor lift schemes.  \n\nB. \n\nHouseholds and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n\nThe  Investment  Program  will  have  positive  poverty  reduction  impacts  on  income, \n58. \nemployment, and food security, particularly for marginal farmers (those having less than 1 ha of \nland).  The  poverty  ratio  in  the  scheme  areas  is  highly  variable:  22%  for  major  renovation \nschemes,  37%  for  the  major  extension  scheme  (i.e.,  presently  non-irrigated)  areas  of  the \nMahanadi River Delta, 35%\u201369% for the three medium-sized schemes, and 6% and 40% for the \ntwo sample minor lift scheme areas.47 Anticipated increases in incomes for marginal farmers are \nin  the  ranges  of  45%  and  95%  for  the  major  renovation  and  major  extension  schemes,  60%\u2013\n80%  for  the  medium-sized  schemes,  and  70%  and  105%  for  the  two  minor  lift  schemes.  The \nbenefit will be higher for presently non-irrigated areas, where the incidence of poverty is higher \ncompared with the areas with higher, albeit unreliable, irrigation access.  \n\nC. \n\nSocial and Gender Development Strategy \n\n59. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  primarily  focus  on  the  modernization  of  existing  irrigation \nschemes.  As  such,  it  will  have  beneficial  social  impacts  for  the  general  population. \nNevertheless, it is erroneous to assume that physical improvement will induce the DOWR and \nWUAs  to  manage  the  infrastructure  efficiently  and  equitably.  The  Investment  Program  will \ntherefore place strategic emphasis on beneficiary participation with due attention to the diversity \nof their interests and possible vulnerability (e.g., farmers in the tail-end reaches of the canals) \nunder the framework of the WUAs. The strategy has four levels, including (i) policy measures to \nequalize  opportunities  and  access,  including  the  refinement  of  the  WUA  Act  to  support  equal \nrepresentation of head, middle, and tail reach farmers and increased participation of vulnerable \ngroups including women; (ii) WUA capacity enhancement to ensure sound governance including \nparticipatory decision making and equal water distribution; (iii) specific actions and programs \n                                                 \n46  Details are shown in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n47 The low level  of poverty  in one of the lift schemes is related to its close  vicinity to a national highway  and urban \n\nareas, and diversification of high-value crops with a pump providing irrigation in part of the command area.   \n\n\ftargeting  vulnerable  groups  including  women  in  order  to  establish  links  to  the  existing  poverty \nreduction  programs  (such  as  self-help  groups);  and  (iv)  compliance  with  social  safeguards \nmeasures. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n\nThe  Investment  Program\u2019s  gender  action  plan48 includes  (i) creating  a  staff  position  in \n60. \nthe  DOWR  PIM\u2013CAD  directorate  to  look  after  social  and  vulnerable  groups;  (ii)  developing \ntraining  programs  for  program  staff  to  enhance  gender  participation;  (iii)  increasing  women \nengaged as field implementation team members (towards 20% of total), with increased female \nstaff in the DOWR; (iv) promoting women representatives elected to WUAs  (preferably towards \n33% of total) following the WUA Act being revised; (v) establishing links with the Department of \nWomen  and  Child  Development;  (vi)  forming  women's  groups  and  delivering  programs  in  the \nWUA; and (vii) undertaking gender-disaggregated surveying and monitoring.  \n\nD. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n61. \nOrissa  has  a  relatively  high  indigenous  population  (22%)  compared  with  other  states. \nHigher  concentration  is  seen  in  inland  districts  including  those  covered  under  the  Investment \nProgram.  An  approved  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  will  be  the  basis  for \ndeveloping  indigenous  peoples  development  plans  for  schemes  having  project  impacts  on \naffected indigenous people.49 Regarding the schemes studied for the first PFR, three medium-\nsized  schemes  were  found  to  have  high  indigenous  populations  at  23%,  26%,  and  63%. \nIndigenous peoples specific actions were prepared for them to benefit from the positive impacts \nand  to  avoid  adverse  impacts,  if  any. 50  The  specific  actions  include  (i)  promoting  due \nrepresentation  of  indigenous  peoples  in  the  concerned  WUAs;  (ii)  undertaking  separate \ninformation campaigns and needs assessment, and ensuring that their interests are met in the \nWUA development and program delivery process; (iii) forming indigenous people's groups within \nthe  WUAs  and  empowering  them  by  establishing  links  to  the  existing  OSG  programs  and \nsupporting specific activities under the Investment Program; and (iv) developing WUA capacities \nto address the needs of indigenous farmers.   \n\nE. \n\nResettlement  \n\nThe  Investment  Program  will  only  involve  the  renovation  of  the  existing  irrigation \n62. \ninfrastructure, except for the Mahanadi Chitropala Island Irrigation (MCII) scheme (footnote 21) \nwhere the irrigation system will be expanded with minor canals. For the subprojects appraised, \nonly  the  MCII  scheme  involves  strip  land  acquisition;  the  existing  right-of-way  is  sufficient  to \nundertake renovation works with no encroachment in all other schemes. For the purpose of the \nInvestment  Program,  a  resettlement  framework  (RF)  has  been  prepared  and  agreed  following \nthe Government\u2019s and OSG\u2019s laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995).51 Under  the  RF,  all  affected  persons  (APs)  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  for  land \nacquired and lost assets at their replacement cost. They will also be assisted in improving, or at \nleast restoring, their pre-intervention income and livelihood standards, and productive capacity. \nThe  PMU  will  supervise  resettlement  plan  (RP)  preparation  and  implementation  by  the \nconcerned  SIO  with  the  support  of  the  ISPM  consultants,  and  with  a  supporting  NGO  for  RP \nimplementation. The RPs as prepared for individual PFRs, as well as those for finalization with \ndetailed designs, will be sent to ADB for approval. Before implementing an RP, an independent  \n                                                 \n48 Available as Supplementary Appendix J. \n49 Indigenous peoples development framework is in Supplementary Appendix K. \n50 Indigenous peoples specific actions are in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n51  A resettlement plan for the MCII scheme is being prepared, following closely RF. The scope for the MCII scheme \nunder project 1 includes only the pre-construction works, including WUA formation, micro planning, and finalization \nand implementation of the resettlement plan. Civil works will be done in project 2.  \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\fmonitoring  and  evaluation  agency  will  also  be  engaged  to  assess  performance  and  impacts. \nThe  provisional  cost  estimates  for  resettlement  is  about  $4.7  million.  Appendix  13  presents  a \nsummary RF. 52  \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n63. \nDuring  the  project  preparatory  TA,  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were \nprepared  for  the  seven  subprojects  proposed  for  the  first  PFR,  which  were  classified  as \nenvironmental  category  B,  along  with  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \n(EARF),  following  existing  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government,  OSG,  and \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  Overall,  the  Investment  Program  will  have  positive  impacts \non  the  environment,  including  improved  water  availability  and  water-use  efficiency,  increased \nagricultural  production,  and  an  institutional  system  of  PIM  to  distribute  water  efficiently. \nInstitutional  strengthening  for  IWRM  will  deliver  further  benefits  through  development  of  a \nframework  for  improved  water  resources  and  environmental  management.  Potential  negative \nimpacts  include  (i)  increased  competition  in  water  use  within  the  subprojects  and  with  other \nwater uses,53 (ii) deterioration of water quality due to agriculture intensification, and (iii) impacts \nduring construction of infrastructure. These are mitigated by (i) sufficient consultation to develop \noperational  plans  agreeable  to  all  the  WUAs,  (ii)  use  of  effective  coordination  mechanisms \namong  the  water  users  at  times  of  drought,  (iii)  introducing  integrated  pest  management  and \neffective  soil  nutrient  management,  and  (iv)  ensuring  safe  and  environmentally  sound \nconstruction practices. Environmental capacity development for the Investment Program will be \nsupported by having an environmental cell in the PIM\u2013CAD directorate of the DOWR, which will \nbe strengthened by the ISPM consultants. For future subprojects, IEEs or environmental impact \nassessments,  if  required,  will  be  prepared  following  the  EARF  and  included  in  the  subproject \nappraisal report, with due public consultation and information disclosure. Summary IEEs for the \nsubprojects proposed for the first PFR are in Appendix 14.54  \n\nG. \n\nRisks \n\n64. \nThere  are  several  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  effective  implementation  and \nsustainable benefits, for which mitigation measures have been included. Refinement of program \ndesign and diversion of resources will be considered, if needed, under the subsequent PFRs.  \n\n65. \nO&M  Sustainability.  The  sustainability  of  the  improved  irrigation  infrastructure  would \ncritically  depend  on  (i)  the  commitment  and  actions  by  the  DOWR  to  properly  manage  and \nmaintain  the  system,  (ii)  sufficient  O&M  funds  allocation  by  the  OSG,  and  (iii)  the  WUA\u2019s \ncapacity  to  progressively  take  over  O&M  responsibility  from  the  minor  canal  level  to  larger \nfacilities. There is a risk that system performance may deteriorate with inferior performance of \nany of these parties. To mitigate the risk, the Investment Program implementation must ensure \n(i) progressive  strengthening  of  DOWR  capacities  with  improved  field  staff  accountability  to \nWUAs; (ii) the OSG\u2019s continuation of its full maintenance funding policy and natural attrition of \nthe DOWR\u2019s nontechnical staff, with increased  water tariff collection through improved system \nperformance and WUA motivation; and (iii) sound WUA development with identification of strong \nlocal  leadership,  farmer  enrollment,  and  establishment  of  self-sustaining  O&M  systems  with \nresource mobilization. These are included as key components and related institutional actions.  \n\n                                                 \n52 The RF and due diligence reports for other subprojects under project 1 are in Supplementary Appendixes M and N. \n53 For major and medium-sized schemes, water balance was assessed to reconfirm the overall water availability with \n\nthe updated hydrological data. \n\n54 The EARF and IEEs are in Supplementary Appendixes O and P. \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\fOperationalization of Reform Frameworks. There is strong political and administrative \n66. \nleadership  to  advance  the  PIM  reform  process  in  Orissa  at  present,  as  reflected  in  the  latest \nState Water Policy 2007, DOWR reforms to establish a PIM\u2013CAD directorate in the DOWR, and \nimprovements to the WUA legal basis, which provide sound policy frameworks. However, there \nis  a  risk  of  insufficient  implementation  of  these  frameworks,  which  will  depend  on  continued \npolitical  will,  strong  leadership  of  DOWR  management,  qualified  and  dedicated  program  staff \nassignments,  and  overall  staff  support  for  the  initiatives.  To  mitigate  the  risks,  key  sequential \nsteps to implement the frameworks have been detailed in the sector road map and included as \nassurances. At the subproject level, operational arrangements have been developed to ensure \nWUA-driven planning, design, implementation, and O&M.  Capacity-development programs will \nsupport  continuous  facilitation  and  learning,  along  with  the  staff  incentive  systems  to  reward \nwell-performing staff in terms of better service delivery to WUAs. \n\n67. \nImplementation  Risk.  Timely initiation and implementation of the Investment Program, \nquality  of  outputs,  and  adherence  to  ADB  operating  policies  and  procedures  also  remain  at \nrisk.55 To mitigate the risk of start-up delay, a component TA project was provided (para. 53) to \nsupport the early establishment of program organizations with training, advance recruitment of \nconsultants  and  NGOs,  and  advanced  procurement  of  civil  works.  Implementation  delay  and \nquality of output risk will be mitigated by addressing the key causes, including (i) advance land \nacquisition, efficient contract packaging, and advance procurement; (ii) sufficient training for the \nprogram staff in contract administration, supervision of civil works and other programs such as \nWUA  strengthening;  and  (iii)  adequate  resource  allocation  for  outsourcing  pre-construction \nactivities  and  for  consulting  services  for  work  supervision  and  training.  Safeguards  risks  are \nmitigated  with  the  relevant  frameworks  and  plans  prepared  under  project  preparatory  TA,  as \nwell  as  the  support  for  addressing  the  safeguards  issues  included  in  the  ISPM  consultancy. \nADB will also assist these processes through regular review and supervision missions.  \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n68. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, the OSG, and the DOWR have \ngiven  the  following  assurances.  These  have  been  incorporated  into  the  FFA  and  will  be \nincorporated into the individual loan agreements as applicable, subject to any amendment to be \nmutually agreed on by the Government of India, OSG, and ADB. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe OSG will implement all policy and institutional actions as specified in Table \nA2.2 of Appendix 2 and stipulated as the sector road map in the FFA, including \nactions  to  implement  State  Water  Policy  2007,  and  State  Water  Plan  2004; \norganizational  reforms  and  strengthening  of  DOWR  and  associated  institutions; \nrefinement  of  Pani  Panchayat  Act  2002;  progress  in  irrigation  management \ntransfer; sustainable O&M; and steps towards operationalizing IWRM.  \nThe OSG will ensure compliance with the specific measures for implementation \nquality assurance as stipulated in the FFA (Schedule 3) and para. 49.  \nThe  OSG  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  meet  the  selection  criteria  and \nimplementation  arrangements  and  procedures  as  specified  in  the  FFA  and  in \nAppendixes 7 and 8, while assuring their timely and efficient implementation with \nsufficient strengthening of the WUAs to take over minor facility O&M.   \nThe OSG will ensure that the Investment Program is implemented in compliance \nwith  the  existing  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government,  OSG, \n\n                                                 \n55 The implementation completion report of the Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project (assisted by the World \nBank  and  implemented  during  1996\u20132004)  also  noted,  despite  an  overall  successful  rating,  administrative \nconstraints and lengthy processes for procurement and contract management.   \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\nand ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and environmental assessment and review \nframework (EARF: Supplementary Appendix O). To this effect, the Government, \nOSG,  and  DOWR  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  PMU  will  prepare  an  IEE  or \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report  as  required,  including  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  with  a  budget  identifying  the  cost  of  its \nimplementation,  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  for  each  subproject  following \nthe  EARF,  and  submit  the  same  to  ADB,  with  the  EIA  or  IEE  for  B-sensitive \nsubprojects to be subject to ADB\u2019s concurrence and to the 120-day requirement \nfor  public  disclosure  under  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy;  (b) all  environmental \nclearances  required  by  all  laws,  acts,  and  regulations  are  obtained  prior  to  the \ncommencement  of  civil  works  for  the  relevant  subproject;  (c) all  mitigation \nmeasures  identified  in  the  IEEs  and  EIAs  prepared  for  the  subprojects,  as \napplicable, are incorporated in the subproject design, and are implemented; (d) if \nthere  are  any  changes  in  the  scope  of  subproject  facilities  during  the  detailed \ndesign or implementation stage that has an impact on the IEE or EIA carried out, \nthen additional environmental assessment will be carried out and DOWR will take \nprior  concurrence  of  ADB  before  further  implementation;  and  (e)  DOWR  will \nsubmit  semiannual  progress  reports  to  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental management plans and measures under the IEE or EIA, and the \nenvironmental monitoring carried out as a regular part of project implementation, \nfor  review  and  disclosure  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \nPolicy (2005).  \nThe  OSG  will  undertake  the  Investment  Program  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s and OSG\u2019s laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995),  and  the  approved  resettlement  framework  (RF:  Supplementary \nAppendix  M).  If  land  acquisition  is  required  or  any  other  resettlement  impact  is \nenvisaged  in  any  proposed  subproject,  the  Government,  OSG,  and  DOWR  will \nensure  that  (a)  PMU  prepares  a  resettlement  plan  (RP)  for  that  subproject \nfollowing  the  RF  and  submits  it  to  ADB  for  approval  after  discussing  its \nresettlement  information  with  APs;  (b)  all  APs  are  compensated  in  accordance \nwith  the  approved  RP  before  the  commencement  of  the  civil  works;  (c)  if  any \nmodification  is  identified  during  detailed  design  and  implementation,  OSG  and \nDOWR  will  modify  the  RP  and  will  seek  ADB  approval  before  further  RP \nimplementation; (d) the PMU will ensure that grievance redress mechanisms are \nin place to assist APs in resolving their complaints in a timely manner; (e) DOWR \nwill  make  available  all  necessary  funds  in  a  timely  manner  so  that  RPs  are \nimplemented and full reimbursement for acquired assets is made to the APs well \nin  advance  so  as \nto  make  alternative \narrangements;  (f)  the  PMU  will  submit  the  quarterly  progress  and  completion \nreports on land acquisition and resettlement to ADB; (g) an independent agency \nthe \nwill  be  engaged  by  DOWR \nimplementation of the RP that will also submit the reports semiannually to DOWR \nand ADB; and (h) relevant information including the RPs,  progress reports, and \nindependent  review  reports  will  be  disclosed,  including  on  the  ADB  website, \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.  \nIn  case  any  significant  impacts  on  indigenous  people  are  identified  in  any \nsubprojects,  the  Government,  the  OSG,  and  DOWR  will  ensure  that  an \nindigenous  peoples  development  plan  or  specific  actions  in  favor  of  them  are \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and the \napproved indigenous peoples development framework (Supplementary Appendix \nK), and the same is further (a) approved by  ADB before award of the related civil \n\nto  undertake  external  monitoring  of \n\nthem  sufficient \n\nto  provide \n\ntime \n\n\f \n\n(vii) \n\nworks contract, and (b) implemented before the commencement of the civil works \ncontract of the relevant section of the subproject. Any update of the same due to \ndetailed  designs  or  during  implementation,  progress  and  independent  review \nreporting,  and  disclosure  will  follow  the  same  requirements  as  involuntary \nresettlement. \nAt  the  time  of  each  PFR  preparation,  the  Government  and  OSG  will  review  the \nstatus  of  compliance  with  the  safeguards  plan  and  frameworks,  and  submit  the \nreview  report  to  ADB,  together  with  the  other  required  safeguard  documents \nrelevant to the subproject included in the tranche being processed.    \n\n(viii)  The  Government  and  OSG  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contracts  under  the \nInvestment  Program  will  follow  all  applicable labor  laws  of  the  Government  and \nthe  OSG  and  that  these  further  include  provisions  to  the  effect  that  contractors \n(i) carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs for labor and disseminate information \nat  worksites  as  part  of  health  and  safety  measures  for  those  employed  during \nconstruction;  and  (ii)  follow  and  implement  all  statutory  provisions  on  labor \n(including  not  employing  or  using  children  as  labor,  equal  pay  for  equal  work), \nhealth,  safety,  welfare,  sanitation,  and  working  conditions.

The  Orissa  state  government\u2019s  (OSG\u2019s)  Vision  2020  and  11th  Five-\n1. \nYear Plan (2007\u20132012) envisage accelerating the annual growth rate to 9% and reducing poverty \nby 15% by 2012. Building on the comprehensive economic reforms pursued since early 2000s, the \n11th  FYP  set  out  key  strategic  pillars  comprising  (i)  improving  agricultural  productivity  and  market \norientation  by  forming  farmer  groups  and  promoting  participatory  irrigation,  (ii)  expanding  rural \nnonfarm business opportunities, (iii) enabling broad-based industrial growth, and (iv) reforming fiscal \nand \nfinancial  management  with  public  sector  accountability.  Development  and  sound \nmanagement of irrigation infrastructure with water user associations (WUAs) is prioritized as a \npathway to productive and high-value agriculture, and poverty reduction in rural areas. To this end, \nthe  OSG  has  progressively  improved  its  policy  and  institutional  basis  for  the  irrigation  and  water \nresources  sector  since  the  1990s.  A  new  State  Water  Policy,  revised  from  the  1994  policy,  was \ndeclared in March 2007, reconfirming the principles of participatory irrigation  management  (PIM)  and \nintegrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM),  and  full  recovery  of  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M) costs from users. The 2007 policy also called for expeditious completion of WUA formation and \ntransfer of O&M. It has further set out specific tasks towards making IWRM operational.  \n\nInstitutional  Arrangements.  The  key  public  institutions  associated  with  irrigated  agriculture \n2. \ninclude (i) the Department of Water Resources (DOWR); (ii) the departments of agriculture, horticulture, \nand fisheries and animal husbandry; and (iii) local government village, subdistrict, and district institutions. \nFor  the  purpose  of  holistic  water  resources  management,  the  OSG  has  established  the  State  Water \nResources Board chaired by the chief secretary as the apex body for policy formulation, inter-sector water \nplanning, and allocation, to which the Water Planning Organization of the DOWR serves as secretariat. In \ngeneral, the concerned departments have requisite technical capacities but are constrained by (i) limited \noperational  finance  due  to  high  overhead  costs;  (ii)  insufficient  incentives  and  capacity  to  implement \nirrigated  agriculture  works  using  participatory  processes;  (iii)  need  for  better  coordination  among  line \ndepartments, local government institutions, and WUAs; (iv) deficient O&M due to shortages of funds and \nhigh staff costs; and (v) need for greater accountability to service recipients.  \n\nState  Water  Plan.  The  OSG  completed  the  State  Water  Plan  in  2004.  It  provides  a  basic \n3. \nframework  to  pursue  the  necessary  interventions  to  meet  the  needs  of  diverse  water  users  while \nmaintaining the integrity of the environment, with broad basin plans up to 2051. Key priorities include \n(i) reviving the investments in irrigation including improved efficiency of existing systems and creating \nnew  systems;  (ii)  ensuring  safe  drinking  water  and  waste  disposal  in  rural  and  urban  areas  giving \nfinancial  autonomy  to  their  management  bodies;  (iii)  reducing  the  gaps  between  environmental \nregulations and practices; and (iv) enhancing O&M sustainability through levying of reasonable water \ncharges. Overall, the plan provides a solid initial basis from which to pursue integrated water sector \nplanning  and  investment.  However,  it  largely  remains  a  qualitative  strategic  framework,  calling  for \nquantitative and analytical investment planning with stakeholder participation starting at the individual \nbasin level.  \n\nLegal  Framework  of  Participatory  Irrigation  Management.  The  OSG  enacted  the  Pani \n4. \nPanchayat Act in 2002 and framed the Pani Panchayat Rules in 2003. They provide a legal basis for WUA \nestablishment and progressive transfer of O&M responsibilities to WUAs by delegating minor facilities to \nthem. It outlines arrangements whereby the WUAs would undertake necessary works from grant funds \n\n                                                 \n1   See paras. 2\u20136 of the main text for the key sector performance and issues.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\nAppendix 2  29 \n \n\nreceived  from  the  DOWR  and  from  collection  of  fees  from  their  members.2 While  they  provide  a \nsatisfactory framework for promoting PIM, the initial experience has led to the recognition of the need \nfor improvements in several areas. The present 3-year tenure of elected representatives is too short \nfor institution-building and continuity, and could be extended with tenure overlap. Better representation \nis needed by users of head, middle, and tail-end reaches of the canals among office bearers. Stronger \nWUA  involvement  is  needed  in  planning  and  implementation  of  main  system  maintenance,  and \nstronger participation of women and other vulnerable groups.  \n\nAgriculture  Sector  Policy  and  Strategic  Framework.  In  line  with  its  market-oriented \n5. \neconomic reform principles, the OSG amended the Agriculture Produce Marketing Act in 2006. This \ncreated opportunities for  private investment in storage and  marketing facilities, and contract farming. \nThe  OSG  also  declared  State  Agriculture  Policy  in  2008.  It  aims  at  more  commercially  oriented \nagriculture, and promotes participatory planning at local levels to be implemented with the private sector \nand  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  Despite  this  improving  policy  environment,  agricultural \nproductivity remains low, with farmers beginning to respond to the new policies but facing constraints, \nincluding  (i)  low  use  of  fertilizer  (30%  of  the  recommended  level)  despite  the  recent  deregulation  of \nprivate  distribution,  (ii)  limited  availability  and  use  of  improved  seeds  (seed  replacement  of  only  6% \nagainst the 25% recommended), (iii) limited outreach of rural credit (40% of farm households have no \naccess  to  formal  credit,  calling  for  other  solutions  such  as  group-based  approaches),  (iv)  limited \neffectiveness of extension services (calling for improved accountability of field extension workers and \nuse  of  private  providers),  and  (v)  the  fragmented  marketing  chain  and  information  asymmetry.  In \ngeneral,  local  conditions  vary  considerably,  with  some  areas  progressing  in  crop  intensification  and \ndiversification, particularly where they have irrigation and ready access to markets. Strategically, these \nconditions  call  for  careful  planning  of  the  most  suitable  production  systems  for  the  locality,  and \nconcerted efforts to facilitate delivery of inputs and marketing of outputs, as well as support services.  \n\nfor \n\nInternational  Development  (DFID)  of \n\n6. \nWater User Association Formation and Operation and Maintenance Transfer. In the \nlate 1990s, the process of forming WUAs was initiated with assistance from the World Bank for \nmajor  and  medium-sized  schemes,3 the  European  Union  (EU)  for  minor  tank  schemes,4 and  the \nDepartment \nthe  United  Kingdom  and  German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW for minor lift schemes,5 following the foregoing institutional \nframework. Following completion of these projects, the OSG has continued the process of forming \nWUAs. As of July 2007, WUAs have been formed for 1.25 million hectares (ha) of the state\u2019s net \nirrigated area  of 2.7  million ha,  and O&M  has  been  transferred to  WUAs  on  0.92  million  ha.  This \nprocess  has  received  strong  political  support  and  is  further  buttressed  by  the  OSG\u2019s  most  recent \neconomic reform programs.  \n\n7. \nThe overall response and impacts of the process are positive, with strong enthusiasm by \nWUAs,  particularly  where  sufficient  motivation  and  facilitation  was  provided  along  with  sound \nirrigation  infrastructure.  However,  recent  progress  has  been  slower,  mainly  because  continuous \ninstitutional  development  support  could  not  be  provided  to  the  WUAs.  In  general,  experience  in \nPIM in India suggests that long-term support is needed for WUAs to become vibrant institutions \nwith  financial  sustainability.  Moreover,  much  of  the  irrigation  infrastructure  has  deteriorated  and \ncannot  function  as  desired,  posing  significant  difficulties  for  orderly  water  distribution.  Other \nlessons include the following: (i) WUAs need to be developed up-front in the project cycle, with full \nparticipation  in  the  decision-making  process;  (ii)  critical  attention  is  needed  to  deliver  quality \n                                                 \n2  For the minor lift schemes, the Pani Panchayat Act exempts WUAs from water rates and authorizes them to carry \nout  necessary  O&M  works  by  collecting  fees  from  members.  In  other  schemes,  water  rates  are  collected  by  the \nRevenue Department, and WUAs are provided with grants from the DOWR. \n\n3  Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project, approved in 1995 for $290 million, covering 315,000 hectares (ha).  \n4  Orissa Minor Irrigation Project, implemented in 1995\u20132005 for \u20ac10.7 million, covering 9,600 ha.  \n5  DFID provided Rs385 million and KfW Rs994 million, covering a total of about 60,000 ha. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ninfrastructure  and  sound  operational  rules  need  to  be  agreed  to  with  the  WUAs;  (iii)  limited \nattention  has  been  provided  to  field  channel  networks,  which  should  be  pursued  as  an  integral \npart of interventions for efficient water use; (iv) WUAs are willing to expand their scope beyond \nirrigation to pursue agriculture development, which could be facilitated; (v) effective mechanisms \nof planning and delivering agriculture support systems are needed; and (vi) NGOs and private \nproviders can be effectively utilized, but this requires capacity development.  \n\n8. \nDepartment of Water Resources. In the DOWR, there is significant organizational support \nfor  PIM  and  technical  capacities  to  design  and  implement  irrigation  infrastructure.  However,  their \ncapacity to establish PIM systems needs further strengthening. Specifically, the DOWR still remains \nan engineering agency with high establishment costs and an aging staff structure. At the field level, \nsound  provider\u2013recipient  relationships  between  the  DOWR  and  WUAs  that  would  support \naccountable service delivery by the DOWR commensurate with water tariff payments by WUAs are \nstill  developing.  To  this  end,  the  DOWR  needs  to  enhance  its  service  orientation  with  a  clearer \nmission statement and performance management. Their multidisciplinary managerial skills need to \nbe enhanced, as well as capacities of sound infrastructure operation. Support systems for PIM need \nstrengthening  with  more  effective  institutional  arrangements  to  develop  viable  WUAs  while \npromoting  productive  agriculture.  Finally,  the  DOWR  needs  to  strengthen  its  management \ninformation system (MIS) to more effectively monitor, plan, and implement O&M. \n\nOperation  and  Maintenance  Framework  and  Arrangements.  To  foster  PIM,  the  OSG \n9. \nhas taken steps to move towards sustainable O&M. Specifically, the OSG has been allocating O&M \nfunds  following  the  Government\u2019s  Finance  Commission  reports.  Allocations  were  increased  from \nRs450/hectare (ha) to Rs600/ha for major and medium-sized schemes in FY2006 following the 12th \nFinance Commission report. On the revenue side, the irrigation water tariff was increased by 150% \nin  2002  (to  a  level  at  par  with  the  national  average)  to  recover  O&M  costs.  The  OSG  is  in  the \nprocess  of  raising  industrial  water  tariff  to  meet  the  recent  rise  in  allocation.  However,  O&M \nsustainability  is  constrained  due  to  the  high  establishment  cost  of  the  DOWR  (Rs260/ha  as \ncompared with the norm of Rs120/ha). Cost recovery also remains at about 50% in FY2006, due to \nthe large gap (about 40%) between the irrigated areas claimed by the DOWR and those certified by \nthe  Revenue  Department,  and  the  underachievement  of  the  collection  targets  (by  about  10%). \nEfforts  are  needed  to  reduce  the  gaps  by  improving  the  reliability  of  irrigation  with  better  system \nperformance, and motivating farmers to pay water tariffs. The present system of collecting the water \ntariff by the Revenue Department and allocation of O&M funds to WUAs by the DOWR with no link \nbetween the two also poses a constraint that must be addressed.  \n\nIntegrated  Water  Resources  Managment.  In  parallel  with  pursuing  productive  and \n10. \nsustainable  irrigated  agriculture  through  PIM,  the  OSG  is  also  taking  steps  towards  further  making \nIWRM operational. The specific agendas have been set out under the State Water Policy 2007, and \ninclude  (i)  preparing  multisector  river  basin  plans  with  participatory  river  basin  organizations, \n(ii) strengthening databases, and (iii) setting up a regulatory authority to set water tariff rates. These \ninitiatives are timely and need to be transformed into actions and operation with suitable institutional \nbacking.  \n\nB. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Irrigated Agriculture Sector \n\n11. \nIn  the  irrigated  agriculture  sector,  the  World  Bank  has  been  the  most  dominant  external \nfinancier  for  India,  with  provision  of  22  investment  projects  for  a  total  funding  of  $4.4  billion  in \n10 states since 1986, including one completed project for Orissa (footnote 3). Major studies were \nundertaken  in  1991  and  1998  with  the  Government  of  India,  which  defined  directions  for  key \npolicy, institutional, and investment reforms for the sector. Over the years, World Bank assistance \nhas  moved  from  project  to  state  sector  loans  to  develop  and  sustain  water  resources \ninfrastructure  and  its  management  with  critical  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  The  ongoing \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\nAppendix 2  31 \n \n\nportfolio  (eight  projects  in  six  states)  pursues  institutional  reforms  of  the  state  irrigation \ndepartments towards greater accountability, decentralization with WUA participation, O&M cost \nrecovery, and progress towards establishment of regulatory frameworks to support IWRM.6 The \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  is  the  second  largest  financier  and  has \nincreased  sector  operation  in  recent  years,  with  four  loans  in  four  states  for  $700  million, \nincluding one in Orissa. JBIC\u2019s assistance is also focusing on effective physical improvement in \ncombination  with  capacity  building  of  the  state  irrigation  departments.  Other  key  partners \ninclude the EU (financing about $110 million for minor irrigation schemes), Canada, and DFID, \nwhich have also focused on institutional strengthening of WUAs with minor scheme renovation.  \n\n12. \nIn Orissa, the projects assisted by four external funding agencies cited in para. 6 were \nimplemented  from  the  mid-1990s  and  completed  by  2005.  Among  these,  the  Water  Sector \nRestructuring  Project  assisted  by  the  World  Bank  has  been  instrumental  in  setting  out  and \nproceeding  with  the  relevant  sector  reforms.  At  present,  the  JBIC-assisted  Rengali  Irrigation \nProject,  a  major  new  irrigation  scheme,  is  the  only  externally  assisted  project  in  the  sector, \nwhereas  the  World  Bank  is  processing  the  Community  Tank  Irrigation  Project,  for  approval  in \n2008,  to  renovate  the  minor  irrigation  systems  in  the  entire  state  with  PIM.  In  agriculture  and \nnatural  resources  sector,  DFID  is  assisting  a  comprehensive  livelihoods  project  in  western \nOrissa  that  is  providing  a  range  of  valuable  models  for  community  based  natural  resources \nmanagement.  ADB  is  also  assisting  the  expansion  of  rural  road  networks  and  reforms  of  the \ncooperatives credit system that provide a basis for irrigated agriculture development.7  \n\nC. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy  \n\nADB\u2019s overall strategic direction in India is to assist the country in promoting efficient and \n13. \nsustainable economic growth to increase employment opportunities and reduce poverty. While \nADB\u2019s sector operation started only recently in 2001, the country strategy and program for India \n(2003\u20132006) 8  expanded  the  operational  area  to  include  agriculture  and  rural  infrastructure \nincluding irrigation  as  its  most  important  feature  to  address  the  country\u2019s  chronic  rural  poverty \nproblems and looming water crisis. Accordingly, a number of sector studies were undertaken to \naccumulate  knowledge  and  disseminate  the  best  practices  and  lessons  learned  in  India  and \nother  Asian  countries.  A  loan  to  support  minor  irrigation  system  renovation  with  PIM  in \nChhattisgarh was approved in 2005, and its implementation is accelerating with increasing state \nownership. 9  The  new  draft  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132012)  further  envisages  an \nenhanced  ADB  role  in  rural  infrastructure,  including  irrigation,  water  resources  management, \nrural markets, and transport facilities. This is in consideration of (i) the high priorities accorded \nby the Government and the stakeholders, (ii) vast country sector needs in terms of finance, and \n(iii)  the  prospects  for  transferring  the  best  practices  and  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  sector \noperations in other Asian countries. The operational focus on water management is also in line \nwith  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)  and  Water  Financing \nProgram 2006\u20132010.10 \n\n14.  Within  this  framework,  the  assistance  strategy  for  irrigation  and  the  water  resources \nsector  envisages  gradual  extension  of  ADB  operations  in  India  with  a  selective  focus  on  the \nstates willing to pursue critical investments with requisite policy and institutional reforms, with a \n                                                 \n6   Despite high lending, the external funding compared with the overall sector budgets in India is deemed small, and \nthe country assistance evaluation by the World Bank in 2002 indicated the need for higher selectivity of states in \nterms of reform ownership and orientation, and closer collaboration with other development partners.  \n\n7   See footnotes 9 and 10 in the main text.    \n8   ADB. 2003.

Recognizing that institutional development \nis  a  long-term  process  requiring  continued  dialogue,  assistance  will  be  selectively  focused  on \nthe  most  critical  agendas  in  line  with  the  specific  contexts  and  needs  of  the  state,  with \nsequenced capacity building and investments, in collaboration with other development partners. \nImproving deteriorated irrigation infrastructure while institutionalizing PIM will be accorded high \npriority in an effort to promote productive and high-value agriculture in rural areas dominated by \nsmallholders, while strengthening the capacities of (i) local WUAs to progressively take over the \nmanagement  of  the  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  state  irrigation  agencies  as  accountable  bulk  water \nservice providers. Based on the best practices and lessons learned, ADB assistance will pursue \ninstitutionalizing  comprehensive  planning  and  stringent  process  management  to  put  PIM \nprinciples into sound sector operation. There will be an emphasis on early capacity development \nof WUAs, following which infrastructure and other support services are provided. Assistance will \nalso emphasize capacity development of, and incentives for, all agencies involved. Gaining local \nexperience  and  reflecting  this  in  the  further  improved  implementation  arrangements  is  also  an \nimportant  part  of  the  strategy.  WUAs  will  also  be  promoted  to  facilitate  local  agriculture \ndevelopment and poverty reduction, linking with existing or project-specific self-help schemes. \n\nD. \n\nSector Road Map and Investment Program \n\n15. \nIn  line  with  the  foregoing  partnership  opportunities,  the  road  map  and  investment \nprogram  for  the  Orissa  Integrated  Irrigated  Agriculture  and  Water  Management  Investment \nProgram  have  been  prepared  to  assist  the  OSG  in  completing  the  establishment  of  WUAs, \nrenovating infrastructure, and transferring the O&M of minor facilities. In general, critical actions \nare to be taken up front, and then followed by incremental steps during the program period. The \nroad  map  also  envisages  supporting  further  steps  for  management  transfer  of  higher-level \nfacilities while putting IWRM into operation. It is built on initiatives that the OSG has proposed or \nhas already taken, and on consultation held during the program preparatory stage.  \n\n16. \nVision,  Goals,  and  Principles.  The  road  map  and  investment  program  envision \nimproving  irrigation  service  delivery  with  WUA  empowerment  to  enhance  the  productivity  and \nsustainability  of  irrigated  agriculture,  thereby  contributing  to  rural  poverty  reduction.  Specific \ngoals include (i) enhancing productivity and incomes by realizing the full development potential \nof  irrigation  infrastructure,  (ii)  setting  up  sustainable  management  systems,  (iii)  improving  the \nlivelihood of the poor, and (iv) putting into operation effective processes and mechanisms based \non a sound policy and institutional framework. Implementation will be guided by the principles of \n(i)  informed  participatory  decision  making  by  stakeholders,  (ii)  coordinated  and  integrated \norganizational  links  at  all  stages,  (iii) accountability  and  transparency,  (iv)  effectiveness  to  be \nmonitored based on clearly defined result targets, (v) efficiency pursued with sound step-by-step \nprocess management, and (vi) a knowledge-driven approach with flexibility for adjustments.      \n\nInstitutional Strengthening of the DOWR. The roles and capacities of the DOWR are \n\n17. \nmost critical for the implementation of the Investment Program. The following are envisaged:  \n\n(i) \n\nThe DOWR has established a permanent directorate for PIM and command area \ndevelopment (CAD) with three divisions: (a) WUA institutional support, (b) O&M \nof  transferred  facilities,  and  (c)  CAD.  Its  leadership  has  been  appointed  from \nqualified multidisciplinary staff. The existing technical set-up of the DOWR is also \nrealigned into directorates for irrigation service delivery and IWRM. \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2003. Water for All: The Water Policy of the ADB. Manila (adopted in 2001).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n  \n\nAppendix 2  33 \n \n\nTo reduce establishment costs, the DOWR has adopted the rationalization of its \nnontechnical  field  staff  through  natural  attrition  without  new  recruitment.  In  the \nmeantime,  those  field  staff  will  also  be  trained  and  placed  under  the  WUA  to \nprovide services for better accountability.  \n\nTo ensure that PIM-based accountable service delivery systems are embedded, \nthe  DOWR  has  initiated  a  change-management  process  to  formulate  an \ninstitutional  vision,  strategy,  and  action  plan  for  staff  management.  This  will  be \nreflected  in  staff  instructions  and  performance  evaluation  systems.  A  capacity-\ndevelopment plan will be expanded to include new requirements.    \n\nThe  DOWR  will  strengthen  its  quality  control  systems  with  the  establishment  of \n(a) a work process for participation of WUAs in construction quality monitoring of \nDOWR-engaged  contractors  and  for  executing  minor  works,  and  (b)  quality \ncontrol cell to undertake third-party testing and internal technical auditing. \n\nFinally,  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  the  Water  and  Land  Management \nInstitute  as  a  state  training  and  research  institute,  it  has  been  reorganized  with \nimproved representation of relevant stakeholders, and stronger autonomy.  \n\n18. \nLegal Framework of PIM. To address the present constraint in WUA establishment and \nmanagement, the OSG will revise the Pani Panchayat Act 2002 and Rules 2003, with specific \nimprovements  including  (i)  longer  tenure  of  elected  members  (6  years)  with  overlap  of  two \nseparate terms at 3-year intervals; (ii) equal representation of farmers from head,  middle, and \ntail-end reaches of the canals as office bearers; and (iii) promotion of women elected members \n(towards  33%).  In  the  context  of  the  investment  program,  the  OSG  will  also  (i)  establish  and \nimplement  clear  operational  rules  specifying  WUAs\u2019  water  entitlements,  (ii)  participation  of \nWUAs  and  higher-level  committees  in  the  decision  making  of  scheme-wide  maintenance \nplanning and implementation, (iii) set up and operate district coordination committees headed by \ndistrict  collectors  to  meet  the  WUAs\u2019  development  concerns,  and  (iv)  promote  livelihood \nenhancement of other vulnerable people within the WUA framework. Upon sound demonstration \nof these functions, their inclusion in the legal framework will be further pursued.  \n \nSustainable  O&M  Financing.12 The  road  map  includes several  short-  to  medium-term \n19. \nmeasures to ensure sustainable O&M. For overall macro planning, the OSG will (i) maintain the \npolicy  of  providing  O&M  funds  following  the  Government\u2019s  Finance  Commission  reports \n(completed in the context of the 12th Finance Commission); and (ii) maintain the full O&M cost \nrecovery policy by revising irrigation, industrial, and other water tariffs following the changes in \nthe O&M allocation. To reduce the burden of establishment costs in the allocated O&M fund, the \nDOWR  is  also  to  maintain  the  present  natural  attrition  of  its  field  nontechnical  staff.  For  the \npurpose  of  reducing  the  immediate  shortfalls  between  O&M  allocation  and  revenue,  the  OSG \nwill  (i)  strengthen  the  MIS  for  O&M  performance  monitoring  and  planning,  (ii)  reduce  the  gap \nbetween  irrigated  areas  recorded  by  the  DOWR  and  certified  by  the  Revenue  Department \nthrough joint verification with WUAs, (iii) improve the revenue record database to monitor WUA \nperformance,  and  (iv) establish  guidelines  for  O&M  fund  allocation  with  a  clear  performance-\nbased  criteria  (i.e.,  a  link  between  the  tariff  collected  and  funds  allocated).  To  ensure \nsustainable O&M at the scheme level, the DOWR will introduce a system of (i) jointly deciding \non the O&M plan with WUAs, (ii) providing additional available funds to WUAs for the facilities \nrequiring  higher  maintenance,  and  (iii)  ensuring  WUAs  mobilize  their  own  resources  in  case \nfunds from the DOWR cannot meet the requirements.  \n\n                                                 \n12 These  measures  are  applicable  to  major  and  medium-sized  schemes.  For  minor  schemes,  all  responsibility  for \n\nO&M, including fund collection and work execution, is envisaged to be transferred to the WUAs. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nIrrigation Management Transfer. The OSG is in the process of establishing WUAs for \n20. \nall public irrigation schemes by 2008. To strengthen statewide awareness and support for PIM, \nthe  DOWR  has  prepared  an  information,  education,  and  communication  strategy,  and  will  put \nthe  strategy  into  operation  within  2008.  As  the  first  step  of  this  process,  the  OSG  has \nannounced 2008 as the \u201cyear of irrigation.\u201d The WUA establishment process is accompanied by \nthe  transfer  of  the  responsibility  for  minor  facility  O&M  to  WUAs  with  necessary  infrastructure \nrenovation  for  ready  O&M  management  by  WUAs.  Upon  completion  of  this  process,  further \ntransfer of O&M responsibility of higher-level canals is also envisaged in the longer term.  \n\n21. \nIWRM.  Along  with  pursuing  the  above-mentioned  steps  to  improve  irrigation  service \ndelivery,  the  road  map  envisages  step-by-step  progress  in  introducing  IWRM  following  the \nactions specified in the State Water Policy 2007. Specifically, the OSG will (i) assess and define \nappropriate  IWRM  functions  and  institutional  arrangements  for  setting  up  an  authority  or \ncommission for fixing water tariffs and other regulatory functions including water allocation and \nentitlement  and  environmental  management,  and  put  them  into  operation;  (ii)  prepare \nmultisector  river  basin  plans  while  establishing  participatory  river  basin  organizations;  and  (iii) \nstrengthen  the  database  and  decision  support  systems  for  the  concerned  river  basins.  The \nprocess will be guided by the State Water Resources Board with stakeholder participation.   \n\n22. \nOSG\u2019s  Investment  Plan  and  the  Investment  Program.  In  accordance  with  the  road \nmap,  a  specific  investment  plan  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  existing \nunderutilized  irrigation  infrastructure  based  on  PIM  and  WUA  development  (as  summarized  in \nTable  A2.1  below)  has  been  prepared  and  included  by  the  DOWR  and  the  OSG  as  a  priority \nprogram  for  the  11th  FYP  (2007\u20132012).  The  investment  program  has  been  formulated  to \nimplement the investment plan, covering major, medium-sized, and minor (lift) schemes in the \nfour  northern  basins,  and  priority  major  schemes  in  the  Mahanadi  River  Delta.  The  remaining \nschemes are to be implemented with the support of the Government and external financiers.  \n\nTable A2.1: Investment Plan for Irrigation Infrastructure in Orissa \n\nItem\n\nNumber of basins\nGeographical area\nNet Irrigated Area (NIA: '000 ha)\nModernization Requirement\n   NIA for Major and Medium ('000 ha)\n   NIA for Minor (lift: '000 ha)\n   NIA for Minor (flow: '000 ha)\n   Investment Need(cid:31)(except minor flow) \n   Investment Need(cid:31)(minor flow)\n   Total Investment Need\nOngoing New Schemes\n   NIA ('000 ha)\n   Investment Requirement\nProposed New Schemes\n   NIA ('000 ha)\n\nNorthern\n\n4\n43,800 km2\n481.0\n\nRegion/Basin\nMahanadi\n\nSouthern\n\nTotal\n\n1\n65,600 km2\n940.1\n\n6\n\n11\n41,013 km2 150,400 km2\n1838.4\n\n417.3\n\n205.0\n30.0\n\n121.6\n20.0\n\n440.8\n100.0\n\n$270 million\n\n$185 million\n\n$86 million\n\n$541 million\n\n114.2\n50.0\n\n50.6\n\n$123 million\n$664 million\n\n233.9\n$718 million\n\n145.4\n$284 million\n\n141.2\n\n520.5\n$76 million $1,078 million\n\n198\n\n578\n\n220\n\n996\n\n=\n\nOrissa Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management Investment Program, \nincluding priority scheme modernization in the Mahanadi delta\n\nSource: Department of Water Resources, Orissa state government. \n\n \n\nThe  overall  sector  road  map  stipulating  policy  and  institutional  actions  and  their  time \n\n \n23. \nframe is shown in Table A2.2.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nKey Issues and Actions \n\nTime Frame \n\nPerformance Indicators \n\nA.

Project Institutions  \n(i)  DOWR  \n\n\u2022  Capacity development of irrigation agencies should be \ncarefully prepared and included as an essential part of \nPIM projects.  \n\n\u2022  A draft capacity-development plan has been developed \n\nand included in the investment program, covering DOWR \nand other institutions (paras. 27\u201329). \n\n\u2022  It is essential to have efficient program management \n\n\u2022  This has been pursued with early establishment and staff \n\nincluding the procurement system up-front, with \nadvanced procurement and engagement of critical \nservice providers for timely initiation of projects. \n\nassignment for PMU, advanced procedures for key \ncontracts, and other capacity-development support \nthrough separate TA (para. 53).  \n\n\u2022  DOWR recognizes the need for farmer participation, yet \n\ntheir capacity and field staff commitment needs \nstrengthening with deeper ownership. Staff incentives to \nsupport PIM are also critical. \n\n\u2022  DOWR is initiating a change-management process to \nrevise its vision in order to reflect the need for client \norientation. Staff performance evaluation system will be \nrevised, along with incentive systems (para. 28).  \n\n\u2022  Specialized PIM directorate needs to be established to \neffectively pursue PIM. DOWR capacity in addressing \nsocial and environmental agenda needs strengthening. \n\n\u2022  DOWR has taken its own initiative to create PIM\u2013CAD \n\ndirectorate and has assigned staff in order to mainstream \nPIM while integrating CAD. The directorate has sections \nto address social environmental issues (para. 35).   \n\n\u2022  Quality control systems need rigorous attention for \n\n\u2022  Quality control will be pursued through WUA \n\nensuring quality outputs. \n\nempowerment and monitoring of program delivery, and \nquality control with third-party audits (paras. 28\u201330). \n\u2022  The program MIS will monitor comprehensive target \n\n\u2022  Integration of institutional, physical, and financial \n\nperformance monitoring systems and effective use of its \nanalysis is needed.  \n\nindicators, to be used as a tool to guide implementation, \nincluding adjustments based on lessons (para. 51).   \n\n\u2022  DOWR should be reoriented from supply enhancement \nto demand management. Bifurcating irrigation service \ndelivery and water management functions is also \nbecoming an issue. \n\n\u2022  DOWR is realigning its offices into directorates for \n\nirrigation and for IWRM. The investment program has \nincluded a consultative study on suitable IWRM functions \nand institutions. (para. 29).     \n\n(ii)  DOA (and Other Line Departments) \n\n\u2022  Despite technical capacity, DOA staff incentives and \nskills to train farmers remain insufficient, and may not \nbe available for service delivery. \n\n\u2022  Interdepartmental coordination in PIM generally \n\nremains a constraint. District coordination committee \nchaired by district heads may be used.   \n\n(iii)  Local Government (Panchayat Raj) Institutions \n\n\u2022  The investment program envisages the use of qualified \nprivate providers and local NGOs. WUAs will select the \nmost appropriate providers depending on the \nperformance and quality of available services (para. 23). \n\n\u2022  The committees were organized during the preparatory \nTA with effectiveness, and will be further utilized, with \nWUA participation (para. 37).  \n\n\u2022  Experience of LGI involvement in PIM in India is mixed, \nwith some WUAs suffering from political conflicts while \nothers gain access to rural services provided by LGIs, \ncalling for careful management of the relations.  \n\n\u2022  While the investment program will not envisage strong \n\ninvolvement of LGIs, establishing productive links would \nbe pursued once WUAs are established and willing to \npursue the associated benefits.   \n\n(iv)  WUAs (Pani Panchayat)  \n\n\u2022  It is possible to form viable WUAs that can take on \nO&M. This requires rights and responsibilities to be \ndevolved to them legally, continuous capacity building, \na structured awareness campaign, commitment of \nresources, and monitoring and support. \n\n\u2022  Program design has incorporated these elements (paras. \n\n19\u201320 and 22\u201328).  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n\u2022  Farmers have genuine interests in agriculture \n\ndevelopment taking water management as its means. \nWUAs can provide a platform for farmer group efforts to \nlead to sustained income enhancement. \n\n\u2022  Involving women can bring about highly positive \n\ndevelopment impacts on the functions of WUAs in \nterms of motivation and administration, although this \nrequires progressive efforts with demonstration.  \n\nC.  Managing Subproject Development Cycle \n(i)  Overall Management \n\nIncorporation of Lessons Learned  \n\u2022  Upon due development of capacities for irrigation \nmanagement, the investment program will provide \nsupport for WUAs forming organizational links between \nfarmer (sub)groups and input delivery, agriculture \nextension, and output marketing (para. 23). \n\n\u2022  Step-by-step efforts will be made starting with women \nsubgroup formation with specific roles and training, to \nmove towards 33% representation in WUA committees \nas a target (paras. 24 and 59-60).    \n\n\u2022  Stakeholder involvement is an integrated part of PIM \n\n\u2022  This is incorporated with WUAs participation in joint \n\nand their participation should be ensured at all stages of \nthe subproject cycle. \n\ndecision-making process, their legal empowerment, and \nO&M transfer of facilities (para. 30). \n\n\u2022  Effective compliance with the set participatory \n\n\u2022  Individual subprojects will be implemented with specific \n\narrangements should be ensured. \n\nperformance targets at each stage (para. 17). \n\n(ii)  Planning and Design of Schemes \n\n\u2022  Reliable and equitable access to water including \n\nfarmers in the canal tail-end reaches has to be ensured \nas an indispensable element of PIM. \n\n\u2022  Access to inputs, output markets, and agriculture \nservices remains an issue. Institutional links and \nprovider capacities are needed. Concrete scope of \nsupport activities and required resources should be \nconfirmed at the planning stage. \n\n \n\u2022  Structure design will consider operational requirements \n(beyond rehabilitation). Operational rules are defined at \nplanning (paras. 19 and 21).  \n\n\u2022  WUA micro plans will specify actions and programs to \n\naddress these constraints. Alternative services (such as \nthrough NGOs) will also be provided, and technologies \nsuch as participatory seed selection, SRI, ICT, farmers \nproducer companies, etc. (paras. 19 and 23) \n\n\u2022  Realistic targets should be set for cropping intensities \nand yields. The planning stage should also capture \ndiverse stakeholder interests with effective conflict \nresolution mechanisms.  \n\n\u2022  Feasibility targets are fixed incorporating the impacts \nobserved in similar interventions. Issues on water \ndistribution\u2014a possible source of inter- and intra-WUA \nconflicts\u2014will be resolved at the earliest (paras. 18\u201319).  \n\n(iii)  WUA Strengthening \n\n\u2022  Sufficient time and resources should be provided in \norganizing WUAs. A firm institutional basis to ensure \ncoordinated and sustainable O&M should be set up \nprior to physical works. \n\n\u2022  The approach of seeking up-front cash contributions \nfrom farmers is sound, but this should be kept as an \nO&M reserve fund in lieu of capital cost contribution. \n\n\u2022  This will be attained through a structured awareness \n\ncampaign and the use of NGOs. Specific WUA \ninstitutional targets will be attained prior to the physical \nworks of the WUA facilities (paras. 17 and 20). \n\n\u2022  5% contribution will be sought for WUA facilities that will \nlead to a sense of ownership. This will be used as a \nreserve fund for O&M (Table 2 of main text). \n\n\u2022  Identifying and working with local leadership \n\n\u2022  Particular efforts will be made to develop genuine local \n\nrepresenting genuine farmer interests is most critical. \nWUAs should develop capacities for irrigation \nmanagement (before attending to multidimensional \ndevelopment activities).   \n\nleadership. Capacity building will focus on organizational \n(including financial management) aspects on irrigation \nO&M. Other development activities will be based on \nfarmer subgroups (paras. 19\u201320, 65)  \n\n(iv)  Water Management and Associated Infrastructure \n\u2022  (See the need for quality control: 4th point for DOWR.) \n\u2022  CAD needs to be integrated into the PIM programs as \n\ntheir essential element. Efforts for conjunctive use could \nalso be provided to expand rabi (dry season) irrigation. \n\n(v)  Agriculture, Fishery and Livelihood Development \n\u2022  (See the need for concerted efforts: 2nd point, B[ii]) \nIn PIM interventions, promotion of participation of \n\u2022 \nvulnerable groups and women in the WUAs remains \nlimited. \n\n(vi)  Sustainable O&M \n\n\u2022  The Investment Program promotes CAD as an essential \nelement, which is integrated in the planning process. \nDOWR also establishes PIM\u2013CAD directorate (para. 22). \n\n\u2022  The project pursues the participation of vulnerable \n\ngroups, with formation of self-help groups and extending \nemployments such as earthworks (paras. 24 and 59).   \n\n\u2022  O&M arrangements require critical attention and \n\n\u2022  The investment program is designed with specific \n\nplanning at the policy, DOWR, and field levels. Key \nconstraints are lack of accountability of agency staff, \nand lack of WUA capacity. \n\nmeasures at these levels to address the constraints \n(paras. 41\u201342). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n41 \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n\u2022  Commitment of DOWR and capacities of the WUAs are \n\nessential for effective O&M. Its requirements and \nresponsibilities should be clearly agreed during \nappraisal with MOUs, water entitlements, and gradual \nshift to volumetric supply. \n\nIncorporation of Lessons Learned  \n\u2022  WUAs will be clarified with water entitlements. They will \nalso be provided with measurement at their water intake \nfor effective monitoring and communication. Progressive \nO&M transfer at higher-tier level is also envisaged \n(paras. 21 and 25\u201326). \n\n\u2022  WUAs should be sufficiently trained to undertake \n\n\u2022  The investment program will pursue this under the \n\nannual O&M with preparation and implementation of \nO&M plans. \n\nspecific subcomponent dedicated to this purpose (paras. \n25\u201326).   \n\n\u2022  Effective MIS needs to be in place to monitor the \nscheme performance. Water audit as practiced in \nMaharashtra can provide a framework. \n\n\u2022  Establishment of effective MIS will be supported, which \nwill also be used for O&M planning and funds allocation \nbased on the improved guidelines (para. 26).    \n\n \n \n\n \n\nD.  Other Supporting Organizations \n(i)  NGOs and COs \n\n\u2022  WUA formation requires special social mobilization \nskills given the diversity of members and farmer \nresource mobilization needs. NGOs should be trained \nfor this purpose. Their performance should be \nmonitored focusing on outputs as opposed to inputs.  \n\n\u2022  The investment program will engage experienced \n\nregional NGOs in association with local NGOs, and \nresources for training. Performance monitoring will be \nbased on set WUA development target indicators (paras. \n19\u201320 and 28).  \n\n (ii)  Private Sector Experts and Contractors \n\n\u2022  Outsourcing of nontechnical expertise to private sector \nexperts is used in PIM projects. While it is possible to \nobtain required services, effective capacity \ndevelopment is needed to ensure their quality. \n\n\u2022  There are capacities to undertake civil works included \nunder the investment program by local contractors, yet \nselection of duly qualified contractors is critical, as is \neffective monitoring.  \n\n\u2022  The capacity-development plan has included the \n\nprograms to train the outsourced experts in the relevant \npositions (para. 27). \n\n   \n\u2022  Selection of qualified contractors will be pursued through \n\nan appropriate packaging and bidder information \ncampaign. Sound quality control systems will also be set \nup with WUA and third-party monitors (paras. 28 and 65).   \n\nCAD = command area development, CO = community organizer, DOA = Department of Agriculture, DOWR = Department \nof Water Resources, ICT = information and communication technology, IWRM = integrated water resources management, \nLGI  =  local  government  institution,  MFF  =  multitranche  financing  facility,  MIS  =  management  information  system,  MOU  = \nmemorandum  of  understanding,  NGO  =  nongovernment  organization,  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance,  PIM  = \nparticipatory irrigation management, PMU = project management unit, SRI = system of rice intensification, TA = technical \nassistance, WUA = water user association. \n\nNote: Cross-references are to paragraph numbers in the main text. \n\nSources:  \n(i)  ADB country assistance program evaluation reports, including ADB. 2007.

Subprojects  will  either  be  major \n(having  a  command  area  of  over  10,000  hectares  [ha]),  medium-sized  (between \n1,000 ha and 10,000 ha), or very minor community-based lift (between 10 ha and \n50 ha) irrigation schemes.1 \n\nFor each subproject, a participatory feasibility study and support due diligence will \nhave  been  prepared,  covering  technical  design,  economic  and  financial  viability, \ninstitutional  arrangements,  social  assessments  including  social  safeguards  plans \nas applicable, environmental analysis, and an implementation plan. \n\nAll necessary central and state government approvals will be in place. \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n\n(g) \n\nFor individual subproject feasibility assessments, the following criteria will apply: \n(a) \n\ntechnical  feasibility,  with  insignificant  technical  risks  that  would  undermine \nefficacy, economic return, safety, or sustainability;  \nreliable  water  availability  and  quality,  with  insignificant  negative  impact  on \nthe other users of the same source or the ecosystem downstream; \nfinancial and economic viability with an economic internal rate of return of \nover 12% with robustness under sensitivity and risk analysis; \nmarginal farmers (less than 1 ha landholding) constituting more than 50%; \nsocial and environmental soundness with insignificant negative impacts; \nfulfillment of safeguards requirements (involuntary resettlement, indigenous \npeoples,  and  environment)  of  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  efforts  to \nminimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  in  the  planning  and  design \nprocess; and \nconcurrence of the concerned water user associations (WUAs) on the basic \ndesign, including farmer contribution (in cash or in kind) for minor facilities \n(5%),  command  area  development  works  (10%),  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the minor facilities within the WUA boundary.  \n\n(b) \n\nFor minor lift irrigation schemes, the following criteria will also apply: \n(a) \n\noperational status being either operational by the WUA or nonoperational in \nless than 5 years due to the causes addressed through rehabilitation; \ntechnical  and  socioeconomic  soundness  and  sustainability  with  flat  land \ntopography (less than 5% slope), vicinity to reliable power supply (within 3 \nkilometers), and little risk of riverbank erosion or sand casting due to floods; \n(c)  WUA  members\u2019  agreement  to  assume  full  responsibility  of  O&M  including \nfuture  asset \npayment \nreplacement,  with  power  agreement  with  electric  supply  company  and \nbeneficiary  contribution  (in  cash  or  in  kind)  equivalent  to  20%  of  the \n\nfor  power  supply  and  all  major  repair  and \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   The  investment  program  will  also  accommodate  as  a  pilot  a  small  number  of  minor  (less  than  1,000  ha)  creek \n\nirrigation schemes, which will also follow the same criteria.   \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\ninvestment  costs,  and  additional  amount  as  reserve  funds  to  prepare  for \nfuture asset replacement;  \nsound O&M plan developed to fully irrigate the command area; \nthe subproject cost of less than Rs36,000/ha of net irrigated area; and \nrelatively  equal  land  distribution,  with  less  than  70%  of  net  irrigated  area \noperated by the largest 20% of operators.   \n\n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n\n2. \nProcedures.  For  the  purpose  of  the  first  periodic  financing  request  (PFR)  under  the \ninvestment  program,  an  appraisal  process  has  been  undertaken  for  two  major  (Taladanda  and \nMahanadi  Chitropala  island  irrigation)  and  three  medium-sized  (Gohira,  Remal,  and  Sunei) \nschemes, along with the two sample subprojects for community-based minor lift irrigation.2    \n \n3. \nsubproject will be processed in accordance with the following procedures:  \n\nFor  all  irrigation  schemes  to  be  proposed  for  inclusion  in  the  subsequent  PFRs,  each \n\nFeasibility  studies  will  be  conducted  by  the  executing  agency  (EA)  including  its  cost \nestimates. The EA will also prepare an initial poverty and social assessment and fill out \nchecklists  for  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and  environment;  and \nsubmit the same to ADB for review and categorization.  \n\nBased  on  the  categorization  and  the  feasibility  studies,  the  EA  will  prepare  the  draft \nappraisal  reports  for  all  subprojects  to  be  considered  under  the  respective  PFRs \nfollowing  the  selection  criteria,  together  with  required  attachments,  i.e.,  draft \nresettlement  plan  (RP), 3  draft  indigenous  peoples  development  plan,  and  draft \nenvironmental assessment.4 \n\nDuring the above process, the EA, with the assistance of the institutional strengthening \nand project management consultants, will also assess the progress and performance \nof  the  implementation  of  the  preceding  loans  under  the  Investment  Program,  with \nnecessary actions to enhance their effectiveness. ADB will closely engage with the EA \nwhile the work is being carried out. \n\nIf a proposed subproject is not likely to satisfy the eligibility criteria and/or the agreed \nprocedures,  ADB  will  advise  the  EA  to  either  (a)  modify  the  subproject  proposal  in  a \nmanner that will make it eligible, or (b) reject the subproject. In the latter case, the EA \nmay propose a replacement subproject under the loan.  \n\nUpon  completing  the  feasibility  assessments  of  the  concerned  subprojects  and \nprogress  and  performance  review  of  the  preceding  loans  under  the  Investment \nProgram,  the  EA  will  submit  the  same  with  a  PFR  to  ADB  for  approval.  The  EA  will \nensure  that  the  necessary  approvals  of  the  Government  of  India  or  Orissa  state \ngovernment have been obtained prior to submission of the PFR. \n\n                                                 \n2   About  650  subprojects  are  envisaged  to  be  implemented  for  minor  lift  irrigation  schemes  under  the  first  loan.  For \nthese  subprojects,  the  executing  agency  (EA)  will  conduct  feasibility  studies  and  prepare  the  appraisal  reports \nfollowing  the  selection  criteria  together  with  required  attachments,  i.e.,  draft  resettlement  plan,  draft  indigenous \npeoples  development  plan,  and  draft  environmental  assessment,  if  required,  and  submit  the  same  to  ADB  for \napproval. Once it has been established that the appraisal reports have achieved a desired level of quality, these will \nbe  submitted  to  ADB  for  information,  except  for  those  appraisal  reports  that  have  safeguards  documents  requiring \nprior approval by ADB. \n\n3   The EA will translate the RP into the local language and disclose it to the affected people and incorporate the results \n\nof the consultation. The final RP will also be disclosed on the ADB website and the website of the EA. \n\n4   If  any  of  the  subprojects  are  categorized  as  environmental  category  A  or  B  sensitive  in  any  subsequent  loan, \ncompliance is required with the 120-day advance disclosure rule. The summary environmental impact assessment or \nsummary initial environmental examination must be circulated to the ADB Board of Directors and made available to \nthe general public 120 days before the PFR is submitted to ADB. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n49 \n\nSUBPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE AND ARRANGEMENTS \n\nFigure A8: Implementation Procedure \n\nFeasibility Studies and Subproject Implementation Plan Preparation  \n\nConfirmation of Candidate Subproject Selection  \n(ii)  Existing major, medium, or MLI scheme in the set \n\ngeographical area requiring renovation  \n(iii)  Technical feasibility with insignificant risks \n(iv)  Reliable water availability, insignificant negative \nimpacts on downstream users and ecosystems  \n\n(v)  EIRR greater than 12%, robustness against risks \n(vi)  Marginal and small farmers constituting more than \n50% beneficiary households and land areas  \n\n(vii) No major environmental issues \n(viii) No major social and land-related issues \n(ix)  Beneficiaries support overall subproject concept, \nand agree on contribution for 5% of minor works, \n10% of CAD, and 20% of MLI works \n\n \n \n\n   Feasibility Studies and Subproject Implementation Plan  \n\nField confirmation of the issues on the left \nInitial formulation of ad hoc WUA   \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii)  Data collection on physical, socioeconomic, and \n\ninstitutional setting \n\n(iv)  Problem assessment on agriculture, infrastructure, and \n\nirrigation and water management \n(v) \nInventory of existing and planned programs \n(vi)  Participatory rapid rural appraisal at village \n(vii)  Identification of priority investment requirements focusing \n\non water and associated interventions \n(viii)  Feasibility studies of identified interventions \n(ix)  Formulation of SIP specifying input and output targets \n(x)  Associated safeguard and other assessments \n(xi)  Presentation of feasibility study and SIP and endorsement \n\nby WUA \nApproval of Feasibility Studies and Inclusion in the \nMFF Subprojects (through PFR) \n\n(See footnote 1  for main facilities requiring early implementation) \n\nWUA Micro Plan (Major and Medium-Sized \nSchemes)1 \n\nWUA Beneficiary Mobilization \n\nWUA Micro Plan Preparation \n\n  During Micro Plan Preparation \n\n(i)  WUA institutional development plan prepared, with \n\n(ii) \n\nfull land and household records  \nInfrastructure development plan (including CAD \nlayouts and conjunctive use promotion), and water \nmanagement improvement plan \n\n(iii)  Agriculture and livelihood enhancement plan, \n\nprepared for synergy with other ongoing programs \n\n(iv)  Environmental and social safeguards plans (as \n\nrequired) \n\n(v)  Endorsement of draft WUA micro plan by WUA \n\nApproval by SIO with support of the \nconsultants  \n\n(i)  WUA working group established to work with SIP \n\n(ii) \n\nteam for micro plan preparation \nInformation campaign on the project and its \nrequirements \n\n(iii)  Endorsement of draft micro plan by WUA \n\nAfter Micro Plan Approval \n(i)  Start implementing WUA institutional development \n\nplan with facilitation by NGOs \n(ii)  Membership enrollment over 70% \n(iii)  Election, and executive and subcommittee formation \n(iv)  Participate in and endorse detailed design and \n\nbeneficiary contribution targets \n\n \n\n(v)  Achievement of set beneficiary contribution targets \nFull achievements of the targets in (ii)\u2013(v) \nconfirmed by SIO  \n\nWUA Implementation Agreement Signing \nImplementation agreement to stipulate schedules, programs, and responsibilities \nof  the  concerned  organizations  to  implement  the  micro  plans\u2014to  be  signed  by \nheads of SIO and WUAs \n\n                                                 \n1   Implementation will be based on the canal units constituting individual WUAs.

All  are  existing \nschemes, with one major scheme1 to extend the branch and minor canal systems to compete its \nincomplete scope, while the rest are to renovate the existing irrigation infrastructure.2 The analysis \nhas  focused  on  (i)  affordability  and  sustainability,  and  (ii) economic  feasibility.  For  each \nsubproject,  the  capacity  of  individual  farm  households  to  bear  the  additional  on-farm  costs \nassociated  with  the  project  was  assessed.  The  beneficial  impacts  of  rehabilitated  irrigation \nschemes and all nonengineering support including agricultural extension on crop profitability are \nweighed  against  the  capital  costs  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  Given  that  the \nremaining  subprojects  under  the  Investment  Program  are  all  to  renovate  existing  infrastructure, \nthe results can be both representative and indicative of the remaining sites.  \n \nB. \n \nTo assess the expected direct benefits of the subprojects, quantifiable effects are valued \n2. \nby  comparing  the  with-program  and  without-program  scenarios.  The  input\u2013output  coefficient  of \nfarm  production\u2014including  cropping  patterns  and  yields,  fertilizer  use,  and  labor  costs\u2014was \nestimated  based  on  farm  surveys  in  the  subproject  areas  and  cross-checked  with  the  data \nreported  in  completed  irrigated  agriculture  projects  in  Orissa.3 All  subprojects  were  assumed  to \nhave an economic life of 25 years and to achieve the full benefits in the third year after civil work \ncompletion. The investment costs were estimated based on the basic design data.4 All overhead \ncosts including consulting services, training, and administration were included in the analysis. The \nanalysis  uses  a  domestic  price  numeraire,  and  economic  prices  for  traded  inputs  and \ncommodities  (rice  and  wheat  with  export  parity,  and  fertilizers  with  import  parity  prices)  were \nbased  on  World  Bank  commodity  price  projections.  The  prices  of  other  crops  and  farm  inputs \nwere  derived  based  on  the  market  prices  in  the  subproject  areas  in  June  2007.  A  standard \nconversion factor of 0.90 and shadow wage rate of 0.75 were used.  \n\nApproach and Major Assumptions \n\nEstimated Benefits \n\nC. \n \nIncreased  Crop  Production.  Crop  production  is  expected  to  increase  both  in  terms  of \n3. \nquantity  and  value  as  a  result  of  scheme  renovation,  because  of  expanded  command  area,  \nincreased  yields,  and  changes  in  cropping  patterns  and  intensities.  Low  reliability  of  water  is  a \n\n                                                 \n1   Mahanadi Chitropala Island Irrigation (MCII) subproject in the Mahanadi River Delta (12,360 hectares [ha], of which \n\n5,940 ha are new). \n\n2   Taladanda subproject (Mahanadi Delta, 32,630 ha), Gohira subproject (Brahmani basin, 8,300 ha), Remal subproject \n(Baitarani basin, 4,310 ha), Sunei subproject (Burhabalanga basin, 10,000 ha), Jalhda minor lift irrigation subproject \n(Subernarekha basin, 20 ha), and Parimukundapur MLI subproject (Brahmani basin, 40 ha).  \n\n3  While  the  Investment  Program  aims  to  achieve  high  potential  yield  levels  with  integration  with  command  area \ndevelopment  and  agriculture  extension  and  other  services,  conservative  estimates  were  adopted  in  terms  of  the \nassumed changes in input use and yields that are comparable to those observed in other irrigation projects (having \nless command area development [CAD] and agriculture support services provided) for the purpose of the analyses.  \n4   O&M  cost  has  adopted  the  figure  cited  in  the  Government\u2019s  12th  Finance  Commission  (December  2004),  and \npresent  level  of  water  tariff  for  households  financial  analysis  for  major  and  medium-sized  schemes,  plus  data \nobtained  for  O&M  requirement  of  CAD  works.  For  MLI  schemes,  actual  requirements  including  electricity  fees  and \ndepreciation costs, were calculated on a case-by-case basis.    \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nmajor  factor  constraining  the  productivity  of  the  irrigation  systems  both  in  monsoon  and  dry \nseasons,  which  is  associated  with  deteriorated  infrastructure  and  inefficient  canal  operation.  An \nimproved  canal  network  with  installation  of  field  channel  systems  will  increase  the  distribution \nefficiency, thereby enabling the expansion of the irrigated area. In reservoir-based medium-sized \nschemes,  the  dry-season  command  area  can  be  increased  by  improving  reservoir  operational \npractices. Crop yields are also expected to increase because of (i) more reliable water supply (via \nimproved  canal  and  operation  systems),  (ii)  increased  use  of  modern  inputs  (induced  by  stable \nand  assured  water  supply),  and  (iii)  provision  of  extension  and  other  support  services.  Crop \ndiversification  is  also  expected  to  be  facilitated  through  (i)  introduction  of  field  channels  (to \ndistribute  water  efficiently  to  the  tail  ends  without  resorting  to  plot-to-plot  flooding  irrigation \nconstraining  the  crop  choice),  and  (ii)  intensification  of  staple  crops  (that  will  increase  the  food \nself-sufficiency of marginal farmers motivating the adoption of high-value crops). WUA members \nwill also be motivated to grow water-saving crops in the dry season.  \n \nNonquantifiable  Benefits.  The  project  will  also  generate  nonquantifiable  benefits, \n4. \nincluding  (i)  an \nimplementation  plans; \n(ii) strengthened WUAs to undertake O&M of at least minor facilities and serve as local agriculture \ndevelopment  facilitators  for  input  supply,  technical  support,  and  collective  marketing;  and  (iii) \nimproved  irrigation  and  related  service-delivery  mechanism  with  transparent  and  accountable \ngovernance through WUAs. Benefits derived from strengthening policy, planning, and institutional \nframework  for  participatory  irrigation  management  (PIM)  and  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM) will also have wider impacts at state and field levels.5 \n\nimproved  planning  system  with  comprehensive \n\nD. \n\nAssessment of Financial Returns \n\n5. \nFarm budget analysis was conducted for typical farm households in the subproject areas, \ndifferentiating fully or partly irrigated and nonirrigated areas, and marginal, small, and medium to \nlarge farm households.6 The gains in farm net income as a result of the project are compared with \nthe farmers\u2019 share of investment costs (Table A11). The annual gains with the project exceed the \none-time  investment  costs  for  all  categories  of  farm  households.  The  annual  net  gain  with  the \nInvestment  Program  (Rs10,000\u2013Rs11,200/ha  for  major  and  medium  scheme  renovation, \nRs20,000/ha  for  major  extension,  and  Rs15,000\u2013Rs20,000/ha  for  MLI  renovation)  represents  a \n50%\u201398% increase in annual income for major and medium scheme renovation, 109% for major \nextension,  and  64%\u2013108%  for  MLI  renovation  on  average.  The  expected  increase  is  higher  for \ncurrently  nonirrigated  or  deprived  areas,  and  reduces  their  income  difference  with  the  irrigated \nareas.  \n \n6. \nTwo  Major  Schemes  in  the  Mahanadi  River  Delta.  The  first  MFF  tranche  will  include \none  major  scheme  for  extension  (Mahanadi  Chitropala  Island  Irrigation  [MCII];  footnote  1)  and \nanother for rehabilitation (Taladanda; footnote 2). The MCII scheme will provide irrigation to 5,940 \nha of presently nonirrigated land (except some 5% irrigated with groundwater), and the Taladanda \nscheme  will  provide  irrigation  to  its  original  command  area  of  32,700  ha.  The  areas  are  mostly \ncultivated  with  paddy  in  the  monsoon,  although  irrigation  is  not  provided  in  the  MCII  area  and \nreaches  only  65%  of  the  command  area  in  Taladanda  with  limited  reliability  due  to  deteriorated \ninfrastructure  and  limited  water  control  structures,  field  channels,  and  communications  systems. \nCropping is limited to 28% of the area in the MCII area and 65% in Taladanda in the dry season, \nmainly due to the limited water availability. It is well-diversified, with non-cereal crops accounting \n                                                 \n5  Economic  analysis  has  not  taken  into  account  impacts  associated  with  canal  maintenance  roads  and  bridges  to \nreduce transport time, as well as follow-on impacts on the nonfarm sector derived from increased crop production.  \n6   Marginal farm are defined as those of less than 1.0 ha, small farms are 1.0\u20132.0 ha, and medium to large farms are \n\ngreater than 2.0 ha.  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nfor 54% of the cropped area in the MCII area and 41% in Taladanda. The area under high-value \ncrops  (vegetables,  groundnuts,  and  sugar  cane)  is  also  relatively  high,  reaching  53%  of  the \ncropped area in the MCII area and 30% in Taladanda. In crop production, limited use of improved \ncereal seeds (as well as their availability) and fertilizer are issues (due partly to the unreliability of \nwater),  along  with  limited  contacts  with  agriculture  extension  workers.  On  the  other  hand,  the \nareas have good and close connectivity with key urban centers (the state capital and nearby city \nwith  a  combined  population  of  1.4  million)  through  state  and  national  road  networks  to  sell  the \nmarket  surplus. 7 The  Investment  Program  will  generate  several  benefits.  First,  reliable  water \nsupply, provided through canal and field channel systems, will lead to paddy yield increases in the \nmonsoon  season,  particularly  in  the  currently  nonirrigated  or  deprived  areas.  Second,  irrigation \nwill also be provided in the dry season, increasing the percentage of cropped area from 28% to \n83%  in  the  MCII  area  and  from  65%  to  73%  in  Taladanda,  with  yield  increase  associated  with \nmore reliable irrigation.8 The dry-season cropping is assumed to have a similar cropping pattern \nthat  prevails  at  present  with  marginal  increases  of  high-value  crops.  The  area  will  have  a  large \nmarket surplus of all crops.  \n\nThree Reservoir-Based Medium-Sized Schemes. The three schemes (footnote 2) have \n7. \nsimilar characteristics, having a storage reservoir (constructed by the mid-1980s) that can provide \nirrigation over a part of the command area during the dry season.9 All aim at restoring the design \ncommand  areas  with  fully  assured  irrigation  for  8,300  ha  for  Gohira,  4,310  ha  for  Remal,  and \n10,000 ha for Sunei. Paddy remains the predominant crop in the monsoon, and irrigation reaches \nabout 66% of the command area in Gohira with limited reliability, and 63% in Remal and Sunei. \nKey  constraints  include  the  deteriorated  infrastructure  (particularly  severe  in  Remal  and  Sunei), \nand  limited  water  control  structures  and  virtual  nonexistence  of  field  channels.  As  a  result, \nreservoir  water  is  generally  overdrawn  in  the  monsoon,  reducing  the  scope  of  dry-season \nirrigation,  for  which  present  cultivation  remains  at  50%  in  Gohira,  30%  in  Remal,  and  26%  in \nSunei, all with partial or no irrigation. Diversification in the dry season is varied, with  non-cereal \ncrops accounting for 45% in Gohira, 15% in Sunei, and only 2% in Remal. The low figures in the \nlatter  two  schemes  are  due  to  the  large  areas  devoted  to  pulse,  which  is  cropped  without \nirrigation.  High-value  crops  are  cultivated  in  17%  of  the  cropped  area  in  Gohira,  and  15%  in \nSunei.  Productivity  is  constrained  by  limited  use  of  improved  seeds  and  fertilizer,  availability  of \nwhich  is  also  an  issue,  along  with  limited  contacts  with  agriculture  extension  workers. 10 The \nInvestment  Program  will  enhance  the  reliability  of  irrigation  in  the  monsoon  season,  thereby \nincreasing the paddy yields. In the dry season, renovation of irrigation infrastructure, placement of \nfield channels, and improved reservoir and system operation will expand the irrigated area to 70% \nof the command area in Gohira, 66% in Remal, and 50% in Sunei, with increased yields.11 High-\nvalue crop cultivation (vegetable and groundnuts) is anticipated to reach 28%\u201335% of the cropped \narea (11%\u201320% of the command area) during the dry season. The area will have market surplus \nof all crops.  \n \nTwo  MLI  Schemes.  The  two  sample  MLI  schemes  (Jaldha  for  groundwater  lift  and \n8. \nParimukundapur  for  river  lift)  are  only  partially  operational  at  present  due  to  the  deteriorated \n                                                 \n7   Many farmers have shown interest in high-value cropping once reliable irrigation is made available in dry seasons. \n8   The yield levels for monsoon paddy are about 3.0 tons (t)/ha for irrigated areas (albeit with unreliable supply) and 2.0 \nt/ha  for  deprived  areas,  which  is  anticipated  to  reach  3.5  t/ha  after  the  project.  For  dry-season  crops,  a  20%\u201330% \nyield increase is anticipated in presently partly irrigated areas, and slightly more for nonirrigated areas. \n\n9  All schemes are located in lower plateau zones and are slightly undulating.  \n10  Although distant from the state capital (120\u2013250 km) the subproject areas are relatively well connected with national \n\nroads, and are in close proximity of regional towns (with populations of 100,000\u2013200,000).  \n\n11 The reported yields for monsoon paddy are about 2.6\u20132.7 t/ha for irrigated areas and 2.0 t/ha for deprived areas at \npresent,  which  is  expected  to  increase  to  3.2\u20133.3  t/ha.  For  dry-season  crops,  a  20%\u201340%  yield  increase  is \nanticipated in partly irrigated areas at present, and slightly more for nonirrigated areas. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n59 \n\ncondition of pump sets and distribution channels. Irrigation is currently 45% of the command area \nin  the  monsoon  and  the  dry  seasons  for  Jaldha,  and  25%  in  the  monsoon  and  35%  in  the  dry \nseasons  for  Parimukundapur.  Paddy  is  the  sole  crop  produced  in  both  areas,  while  Jaldha  also \nhas  a  small  area  (8%  of  cropped  area)  devoted  to  vegetable  in  the  dry  season,  and \nParimukundapur  has  35%  of  the  area  cultivated  with  high-value  crops,  reflecting  its  very  good \nconnectivity  and  vicinity  to  urban  centers.12 The  renovation  will  support  the  expansion  of  the \nirrigated  area  to  100%  of  the  command  in  both  monsoon  and  dry  seasons  (and  an  additional \n20%\u201330% in the summer season for triple cropping), increasing the cropping intensity and yield \nlevels,  although  scope  for  yield  increase  in  the  monsoon  in  Jaldha  is  limited  due  to  the  poor \ndrainage  conditions.  It  is  expected  that  the  share  of  high-value  crops  will  increase  to  20%  in \nJaldha and 50% in Parimukundapur.  \n\nE. \n\nAssessment of Economic Returns     \n\n9. \nResults  of  the  economic  analysis  show  that  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR) \nfor  the  MCII  scheme  is  18.8%,  for  the  Taladanda  scheme  22.7%,  for  the  three  medium-sized \nschemes  19.8%\u201322.0%,  and  the  two  MLI  schemes  30.1%\u201338.2%.  Switching  values  were \nestimated to determine the maximum level of cost overrun, delay in years to achieve the benefit \ntargets,  reduced  incremental  benefits,  and  reduced  cereal  and  non-cereal  prices,  at  which  the \nschemes  will  still  be  economically  viable.  These  schemes  remain  economically  viable  with  cost \noverruns of at least 51%, delay of 4\u20138 years in achieving full benefit targets, 33%\u201354% reduction \nin  incremental  benefits,  and  cereal  and  non-cereal  crop  price  reduction  of  at  least  31%.  A \nseparate  sensitivity  analysis  of  smaller  diversification  to  high-value  crops  was  also  undertaken, \nwhich resulted in 12.3%\u201317.5% EIRRs under the assumption that the share of high-value crops \nremains the same as present for the major and medium-sized schemes.  \n\nF. \n\nImpacts on Poverty     \n\nThe percentage of the poor in the subproject areas were variable among subprojects, at \n10. \n37% in the MCII extension area (population of 32,000), 22% in Taladanda (with 210,000 people), \n35%\u201369% in medium-sized schemes (total population of 101,000, with highest poverty in Sunei), \n40%  in  Jaldha,  and  6%  in  Parimukundapur.  Farms  in  these  subprojects  are  also  predominantly \nmarginal in size, with an average size of 1.0 ha in the MCII area and Taladanda, 0.9\u20131.1 ha in the \nthree medium-sized schemes, and 0.3\u20130.4 ha in the MLI schemes; landless, marginal, and small \nfarmers (up to 2 ha landholding) account for about 90% in the major and medium-sized schemes, \nand almost 100% in MLI schemes. Given that the poor households are within this group (as well \nas near-poor households with an average per capita daily income of $2/day who account for 80% \nof the total households in India), the Investment Program will have significant direct benefits to the \npoor and near-poor people. The percentage of net financial income gains that will be captured by \nlandless,  marginal,  and  small  farmers  accounts  for  74%\u201378%  in  major  and  medium-sized \nschemes, and 94%\u2013100% for MLI schemes.  \n\n11. \nPoor  people  will  also  benefit  from  increased  opportunities  for  family  and  hired  on-farm \nlabor.  Annual  on-farm  labor  opportunities  are  estimated  to  increase  by  1.56  million  days  for  the \nMCII  scheme  and  Taladanda  combined  (of  which  0.88  million  days  will  be  hired-labor \nopportunities), and 0.94 million days for the three medium-sized schemes (of which 0.72 million \ndays will be hired-labor opportunities). It is anticipated that most hired-labor opportunities will be \nprovided  to  the  landless  and  marginal  farm  households  with  less  land.  The  increased  labor \namounts  to  35\u201397  days  per  landless  and  lower  half  of  marginal  family  household  for  major  and \nmedium-sized schemes, and 21\u201324 days for MLI schemes.  \n                                                 \n12 The Jaldha scheme is also closely connected with state and national roads. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nTable A11: Summary of Financial and Economic Analysis \n\nMCII\n(Expansion)\n\nTaladanda\n(Renovation)\n\nGohira/Remal\n(Renovation)\n\nJhalda\n(Renovation)\n\nCommand Area (ha)\n     Presently Partily/Fully Irrigated\n     Presently Non-Irrigated/ Deprived of Irrigation\n\nItem\n\nHouseholds\n     Landless\n     Marginal\n     Small\n     Med/Large\nPopulation\n\n(Up to 1.0 ha)\n(1.0\u20132.0 ha)\n(Above 2 ha)\n\nIncremental Net Crop Revenue (Rs'000)\n\nSubproject Cost (Rs'000)\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (%)\nEconomic Net Present Value (Rs'000)\nSwitching Values\n    Cost Overrun (%)\n    Benefit Delay (years)\n    Incremental Benefit Shortfall (%)\n    Cereal Crop Price Reduction (%)\n    Non-cereal Crop Price Reduction (%)\nSensitivity Analysis\n    EIRR at same high value cropping share\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (%)\n\nIncremental Income per Household (Rs)\n    Landless\n    Marginal\n    Small\n    Med/Large\n    Average\n\nAverage Incremental Income (Rs/ha)\nProject Investment Cost Contribution (Rs/ha)\nAnnual O&M Cost (Rs/ha)\nO&M as % of Incremental Income (average)\n\nIncremental Annual Labor Inputs ('000 days/year)\nIncremental Hired Labor ('000 days/year)\n\nCrop Production ('000 tons)\n     Total (Without Project/ With Project)\n     Food Grains (Without Project/ With project)\n     High Value Crops (without Project/ With Project)\n     Others (Without Project/ With Project)\n\nPoverty Incidence \nShare of Net Benefits (%)\n    Landless and marginal farmers\n    Small\n    Medium/Large\n\n5,937\n317\n5,620\n\n32,684\n21,383\n11,301\n\n5,840\n590 (10%)\n\n31,300\n2,700 (  9%)\n2,950 (51%) 16,700 (53%)\n8,400 (27%)\n1,670 (29%)\n3,500 (11%)\n630 (10%)\n210,000\n32,000\n\n8,304/ 4,313\n6,030/ 2,729\n2,274/ 1,584\n\n11,010\n890 (  2%)\n7,200 (65%)\n1,660 (17%)\n1,260 (16%)\n47,000\n\n119,000\n\n436,000\n\n18.8\n160,000\n\n337,000\n\n86,000/48,000\n\n1,064,000 294,000/172,000\n\n22.7\n\n22.0/ 19.8\n624,000 161,000/ 68,000\n\n51\n4.5\n33\n-\u2013\n31\n\n14.8\n15.0\n\n4,180\n17,460\n23,790\n43,400\n20,380\n\n20,040\n1,303\n569\n2.8\n\n435\n200\n\n25.0/53.9\n13.0/18.3\n9.4/27.1\n2.6/  8.5\n\n37%\n\n45%\n33%\n23%\n\n88\n6\n45\n-\u2013\n48\n\n77/ 55\n7/ 5\n42/ 34\n \u2013 / 41\n40/ 48\n\n17.5\n18.7\n\n16.6/ 13.9\n18.8/ 17.8\n\n3,720/ 3,790\n9,450/ 8,980\n12,480/11,670\n23,030/21,430\n10,940/10,650\n\n10,360/11,130\n1,302/ 1,303\n509/ 469\n4.9/ 4.1\n\n312/ 179\n238/ 128\n\n2,750\n9,130\n12,900\n21,750\n10,770\n\n10,310\n1,010\n532\n5.2\n\n1,120\n680\n\n175/267\n87/110\n42/  76\n46/  81\n\n22%\n\n35%/ 44%\n\n46%\n31%\n22%\n\n52%/ 49%\n22%/ 26%\n26%/ 25%\n\n40.7/ 66.9\n31.0/ 41.7\n9.1/ 23.8\n0.6/   1.4\n\n0.067/0.137\n0.056/0.079\n0.011/0.054\n0.000/0.004\n\n20\n9\n11\n\n60\n11 (18%)\n47 (78%)\n2 (  3%)\n0 (  0%)\n60\n\n300\n\n556\n\n30.1\n629\n\n>100%\n8\n54\n84\n46\n\n20.2\n21.3\n\n1,220\n5,680\n16,730\n-\n5,000\n\n15,000\n3,805\n2,300\n15.3\n\n2.14\n0.84\n\n40%\n\n89%\n11%\n-\u2013\n\n \n\nMCII = Mahanadi Chitropala Island Irrigation, O&M = operation and maintenance.\nNote: Figures for household number and crop production for Gohira and Remal are combined totals of the two. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: India: Orissa Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management Investment Program \n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nSouth Asia Department / Agriculture, Natural \nResources, and Social Services Division \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nMultitranche Financing Facility \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nIndia\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2007\u20132012) prioritizes reducing rural\u2013urban disparity and chronic rural poverty through \ninclusive and equitable growth with a strong focus on accelerating agriculture, irrigation, and rural development. According \nto the draft Vision 2020 and 11th Five-Year Plan of the Orissa state government, accelerating economic growth to 7% per \nannum and reducing poverty by 15% during the 5-year period is targeted. Key priorities in achieving this include improving \nagriculture  productivity  with  participatory  irrigation  management  (PIM)  and  formation  of  water  user  associations  (WUAs) \nand  expanding  nonfarm  business  opportunities  in  rural  areas,  along  with  reforms  in  the  enabling  environment  for  public \nsector  accountability  and  market  orientation  pursued  within  the  framework  of  sound  macroeconomic  (including  fiscal  and \nfinancial)  management.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  India  (2003\u20132006) 1  expanded  ADB\u2019s  operations  in \nagriculture,  irrigation,  and  rural  infrastructure  to  address  the  country\u2019s  chronic  rural  poverty  problems  and  looming  water \ncrises.  The  new  draft  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132012)  envisages  enhanced  ADB  roles  in  rural  infrastructure \ndevelopment  for  irrigation,  water  resources,  and  agriculture  marketing,  following  the  priority  of  the  sector  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  11th  FYP  and  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework.2 The  proposed  Orissa  Integrated  Irrigated  Agriculture \nand  Water  Management  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program)  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  help \nreduce  rural  poverty  focusing  on  irrigation  infrastructure  development,  and  will  help  expand  their  coverage,  while \nestablishing and strengthening farmer WUAs to progressively take on operation and maintenance (O&M) and to serve as a \nplatform to promote local agricultural development through a collective and demand-driven approach. The project\u2019s scope \nincludes renovation of selected major, medium-sized, and minor lift irrigation systems within four major river basins, namely \nthe  Subernarekha,  Budhabalanga,  Baitarani,  and  Brahmani  basins,  plus  a  part  of  the  Mahanadi  River  Delta.  The \nInvestment  Program  objective  and  its  design  are  in  line  with  the  priorities  and  strategic  directions  of  the  11th  FYP  of  the \nGovernment and the state government, ADB\u2019s draft country strategy and program, and long-term strategic framework.  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nIn  Orissa,  poverty  is  predominantly  a  rural  phenomenon  as  more  than  85%  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas  and  engage  in \nagriculture  and related  nonfarm activities. As per the latest estimates of the Planning  Commission, the percentage  of the \npopulation below the poverty line was 46% in rural areas in 2005 as against the all-India average of 28%, and 44% in urban \nareas against the all-India average of 26%. It is much higher among indigenous peoples (IPs) and castes people. \n\nThe major and medium-sized irrigation subproject areas proposed for the first tranche have a poverty  incidence  of 22%\u2013\n69%  in  2007.  About  6.5%  of  the  total  households  are  below  the  \u201cabsolute  poverty  line\u201d  in  terms  of  calorific  intake  and \naccess  to  resources.  Poverty  incidence  is  higher  in  tail-end  reaches  of  canals  having  less  access  to  irrigation  within  the \nsubprojects, and among IPs and castes people. In these schemes, the overwhelming majority (about 80%) of the cultivators \nare landless and marginal and small farmers (with less than 2 hectares [ha] landholding) who are mostly poor or near-poor. \nThey  also  occupy  the  majority  (about  70%)  of  the  irrigation  command  area.  Therefore,  improving  the  irrigation  system  in \nterms of better coverage and equal and efficient distribution would substantially contribute to increased farm income of the \npoor and near-poor people. Improved irrigation  will also contribute to job creation in  agriculture as  well as labor intensive \nagro-based  industries  by  providing  job  opportunities  for  agricultural  laborers  and  marginal  farmers.  With  a  more  dynamic \nrural economy through irrigated agriculture, a multiplier effect of growth in the nonagricultural sector is also expected.  \n\nWithout  irrigation,  agricultural  operations  are  seasonal  and  mostly  of  single-crop  nature  (during  the  monsoon,  or  kharif) \nwhich provides for subsistence agriculture and employment for only about 6 months a year. For the rest of the year, people \nare not fully engaged, which leads to serious underemployment and abject poverty. Small and marginal landholdings and \nuneconomical  single-crop  patterns  do  not  provide  for  surplus  yields  for  food  processing  or  marketing  of  agricultural \nproduce. Unless there is multiple and intensive cropping many people will remain partially employed.  \n\nFor  the  rural  poor,  access  to  and  control  of  irrigation  water  are  of  fundamental  importance  as  water  is  the  foundation  for \nagriculture and livelihood activities, including pisciculture, agroforestry, and livestock. Irrigated agriculture is a major source \nof food and income for rural households below and above the poverty line, including smallholders and sharecroppers (the \nmajority  of  cultivators),  who  have  little  source  of  income  other  than  agriculture.  Sufficient  and  timely  access  to  irrigation \nreduces vulnerability risk and increases livelihood security. Therefore, ensuring equitable and secured access to irrigation \nwater and participation in water management has a major impact on the livelihood opportunities for poor rural people. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n2. Design Features  \nThe  Investment  Program  consists  of  the  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure,  including  regulators  and \nretention  structures,  sluices,  canal  resectioning,  outlets,  and  field  channels.  Through  the  expansion  of  the  irrigated  area, \nand by providing water in the dry (rabi) season and improving the agricultural farming systems, the project will improve crop \nyields due to double-cropping (in monsoon and dry seasons), diversify agricultural production, and support pisciculture in \nreservoirs and canals. The formation of WUAs will empower farmers to manage water resources and organizational affairs \neffectively, as equal partners to the service provider, the  Department of Water Resources (DOWR),  whose accountability \nand service orientation will be improved through institutional reforms and capacity strengthening. Agricultural improvement \nand  livelihood  enhancement,  implemented  through  WUAs,  are  particularly  targeted  at  small  and  marginal  farmers  who \nconstitute  a  vulnerable  group.  The  Investment  Program  also  seeks  to  achieve  poverty  reduction  through  (i)  rehabilitation \nand  modernization  of  irrigation  infrastructure  to  make  water  supply  more  reliable  for  cultivation  and  livestock  rearing,  (ii) \nempowerment  of  WUAs  capable  of  managing  and  maintaining  the  irrigation  system,  and  (iii)  strengthening  WUAs  to \npromote agriculture intensification and diversification through a collective approach. A system of rotational irrigation water \nsupply and conjunctive use of groundwater will be promoted under the project to ensure water delivery to the farmers in the \ntail end reaches of the irrigation canal systems who are suffering greater poverty due to water deprivation. The participatory \nproject design seeks to ensure that the poor and vulnerable are actively engaged in WUA and self-help group formation as \nwell  as  planning  activities,  thereby  ensuring  ownership  by  communities,  including  their  poorest  members.  Minor \nconstruction work will also be awarded to WUAs. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.    Findings of Social Analysis \nAccording to the 2001 census, the total population of the state is 36.8 million, of which almost 80% live in rural areas. The \nIPs  number  over  8.1  million  (22%  of  the  state\u2019s  population)  and  castes  people  number  6.1  million  (17%  of  the  state\u2019s \npopulation).  The  IPs  are  the  most  disadvantaged  social  group  in  Orissa,  characterized  by  relatively  low  levels  of  literacy \nand health, and high economic deprivation. Although IPs are spread all over the state, they  are primarily concentrated in \nthe  southern,  northern,  and  north-eastern  districts.  At  the  state  level,  literacy  among  the  tribes  is  as  low  as  37%  and  the \nincidence of poverty among the rural IPs is around 64%. The infant mortality rate is 10.3% higher for Orissa\u2019s indigenous \npopulation  as  compared  to  the  state\u2019s  population  as  a  whole,  the  under-5  mortality  rate  is  19.6%  higher,  and  the  child \nmortality  rate  is  52.7%  higher. The  work  participation  rate  among  the  tribes  is  57%.  Out  of  this,  33%  are  cultivators,  and \nagricultural laborers constitute 47%. The majority of workers in IP communities are thus engaged as agricultural laborers. \n\nAccording  to  the  household  survey  in  the  seven  subproject  areas  studied  for  the  first  tranche,  17%  of  households  are \nclassified as IPs, 18% as castes people, 34% as other backward classes, and 30% as general castes. Three medium-sized \nschemes have a high percentage of IP population at 23%, 26%, and 63%, the highest being the Sunei irrigation scheme. \nOverall, around 7% of households are headed by women. The majority of people in the subproject area are landless people \n(14%)  and  marginal  farmers  (up  to  1  ha  of  landholding,  55%\u201360%),  followed  by  small  farmers  (up  to  2  ha,  25%\u201328%), \nmedium  farmers  (up  to  5  ha,  6%\u20138%)  and  large  landholders  (2%\u20133%).  Around  25%  of  the  cultivators  are  sharecroppers \n(and  about  half  of  them  do  not  own  land)  dependent  on  agriculture.  They  have  to  supplement  their  income  by  seeking \nemployment  as  daily  wage  laborers.  Rice  cultivation  in  the  wet  season  is  the  main  economic  activity  for  which  a  labor \ncontracting system with varying wage rates has evolved. Agricultural wage rates are lower than the wage rates for mining, \nconstruction, or other activities. Big farmers usually engage one laborer per 2 ha of cultivable land. Small farmers generally \nengage labor for harvest only. The average wage for male agriculture labor during the peak season is Rs55 a day. Women \nare paid much less than men. \n\nAccording to the social survey, although classified as IPs, the social, cultural, economic, and political characteristics of the \nindigenous people do not differ significantly from other social groups and the mainstream Hindu population. As the project \nenvisages  rehabilitation  and  modernization  of  the  existing  irrigation  infrastructure,  no  new  infrastructure  such  as  dams  or \nreservoirs are foreseen. Potential impacts were screened with no potential adverse impacts on IPs found. As such, and with \nno land acquisition or significant environmental impacts envisaged, the subproject population overall is expected to obtain \nbenefits from the improved irrigation infrastructure and its management systems.  \n\nThe Investment Program will place strategic emphasis on beneficiary participation with due attention to the diversity of their \ninterests  and  possible  vulnerability  (e.g.,  farmers  in  the  tail-end  reaches  of  canals,  IPs  and  castes  people)  under  the \nframework of the WUAs. The strategy has four levels: (i) policy measures to equalize opportunities and access, including \nthe refinement of the WUA Act to support equal representation of farmers from head, middle, and tail reaches of irrigation \ncanal systems and increased participation of vulnerable groups including women; (ii) WUA capacity enhancement to ensure \nsound governance including representation, participatory decision making, and equal water distribution; (iii) specific actions \nand  programs  targeting  vulnerable  groups  including  women  with  establishing  links  to  the  existing  poverty  reduction \nprograms (such as self-help groups); and (iv) compliance with social safeguards measures.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n63 \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nA participatory process was used during the project preparatory stage, and consultation, collaborative decision making, and \nempowerment exercises were carried out with women, the landless, IPs, and other vulnerable groups in the subproject area \nusing participatory rural appraisal techniques. An inventory of local needs was prepared, encompassing problems related to \n(i)  water  resources  in  relation  to  agriculture,  fisheries  and  other  uses;  (ii)  possible  solutions  to  resolve  the  constraints \nidentified; and (iii) their implications for poverty reduction. The role of service providers, people\u2019s willingness to contribute to \noperations  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  the  scope  of  enhancing  impacts  with  micro  credit  and  extension  services,  were \nalso  discussed.  Nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  were  engaged  to  facilitate  this  process.  The  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance identified the future course of action and mechanisms to institutionalize community participation. \n\nThe community expectations of the benefits and impacts of the Investment Program are (i) increased agriculture and fish \nproduction, (ii) more opportunities for disadvantaged groups to become involved in farming and nonfarming activities, and \n(iii)  increased  income  opportunities.  All  women  interviewed  expected  to  benefit  mainly  by  employment  and  income \ngeneration  through  improved  post-harvest  work,  livestock  and  fish  production,  farm  and  homestead  production,  cottage \nindustries, improved water supply and sanitation services, and access to credit. \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIn order to promote sustainability of the intervention as well as prevent implementation delays and manage conflicts, WUAs \nwill  be  empowered  to  progressively  take  control  of  the  irrigation  systems.  Irrigation  field  staff  and  contracted  NGOs  will \nassist  in  strengthening  WUAs.  WUAs  will  prepare  cropping  plans,  enter  into  irrigation  management  agreements  with  the \nDOWR, and take over O&M activities. The C&P plan focuses on empowering WUAs in the governance of irrigation systems \nand  the  preparation  of  WUA  plans.  NGOs  will  provide  leadership  and  confidence-building,  training  WUAs  to  become \ncapable of managing and operating their schemes. Furthermore, village facilitators will be selected and trained to provide a \nsustainable  mechanism  for  continued  community-based  management  and  development.  The  Investment  Program  will \nestablish procedures for close coordination among district administration and NGOs for effective service delivery. A budget \nof $5 million is provided for empowerment processes of WUAs, facilitated by NGOs. \n\nIP  communities  have  a  long  tradition  of  participating  in  community-based  activities  but  their  participation  in  WUAs  is  not \neffective. During the field survey, it was observed that participation of IPs in WUAs is much less than the general population \nin executive committees and as office bearers of WUAs. In addition, they exhibit the following limiting characteristics: little \nland in the command area, traditional agricultural practices with low returns, limited access to bank loans and farm inputs, \nand less access to water. Consequently, quite often they are unable to secure meaningful representation in the process of \ndecision making in community affairs and in the development processes. Therefore, attempts will be made to ensure that \nsocially  weaker  sections  of  society  are  equally  represented  in  the  WUAs  and  receive  the  benefits.  Training  and  income-\ngenerating activities to minimize the existing economic imbalances of the IPs have been planned. For this purpose an IP \nspecific action was developed, which defines the strategy and activities for the empowerment of vulnerable people. \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nDue  to  unequal  access  of  women  to  productive  resources  and  the  gender  discrimination  within  traditional  households, \nwomen bear a disproportionately high burden of poverty. Lack of autonomy within the household and social restrictions on \nmobility  prevent  women  from  accessing  education,  skills  training,  and  health  facilities  as  well  as  labor  markets.  Besides \nhousehold chores, rural women are major contributors to the rural economy in crop and livestock production, and cottage \nindustries. In addition, women spend a large part of their time gathering water and firewood for household use. A strategy \nfor gender mainstreaming was formulated taking these features into consideration. \n\n2.  Key  Actions.

The  project  will  give  specific  attention  to \nemployment  of  female  staff  at  all  levels  and  train  field  staff  in  gender-sensitive  and  participatory  planning  and \nimplementation.  Furthermore,  the  gender  action  plan  will  (i)  ensure  labor  employment  opportunities  generated  by  the \nproject and O&M works, (ii) train women to be involved in WUAs and all aspects of O&M; (iii) support women's work in farm \nand  homestead  production;  (iv)  strengthen  the  extension  system  to  be  gender-equitable;  (v)  identify  and  respond  to \nwomen's agricultural and household needs for technology in close collaboration with implementing agencies and NGOs; (vi) \nsupport  women  in  their  home-based  post-harvest  production  and  marketing  activities;  (vii)  improve  processing  of \nagricultural produce and diversify to high-value vegetable production; (viii) support credit and savings groups; (ix) provide \nwomen with training in crop and horticulture production, poultry and small livestock rearing, fisheries, and processing.  \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n   Full Plan in preparation \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\nSignificant in one (Mahanadi Chitropala Island) \nirrigation scheme to be implemented in tranche 2, for \nwhich a resettlement plan is being prepared. All other \nsubprojects are rehabilitation of existing schemes \nand will have limited or no resettlement impacts. A \nresettlement framework has been prepared to guide \nplanning and implementation of resettlement, \nincluding compensation and livelihood restoration.  \n\nOut of seven subprojects under tranche 1, three \nsubprojects have relatively high IP populations, \nalthough no negative impacts are expected. An IP \nspecific action plan was prepared for those schemes \nto aim at equal participation and empowerment of IPs \nin project activities. An IP framework was also \nprepared to guide all subproject implementation. \n\nLabor-intensive irrigation rehabilitation and O&M will \ncreate local employment activities. Core labor \nstandards will be included in contractors\u2019 contract \nclause. Contracted labor arrangements will pursue \nequal pay for men and women and observe official \nwage standards. \n\nThe \nInvestment  Program  envisages  beneficiary \ncontribution  of  5%  of  the  investment  costs  for  minor \ncanal systems, 10% for command area development, \nand 20% for minor lift irrigation, along with the cost of \nO&M. The affordability assessment suggests that the \nrequired  contribution  is  well  within  the  increased \nincome brought about by the project interventions. \n\nThe Investment Program does not envisage adverse \nimpacts. It will reduce risks vis-\u00e0-vis unreliable water \nsupply, overdependence on monsoon rain, frequent \ncrop failure, and inefficient O&M, thus changing \npeople\u2019s attitudes towards participation with more \nopportunity. \n\nGovernance concerns will also be addressed by \nparticipatory approaches. Open meetings, open \nbooks, audits, and legal empowerment of WUAs will \nalso promote accountability. The participatory \nprinciple will develop project ownership among \nstakeholders and this, in turn, will enhance \nsustainability. The cost-sharing mechanism will \nrelieve the Government from financial support for \nO&M, and allows government funds to be used for \nsustaining and further expanding the reforms. \n\n64 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nLimited/ \nNo Impact \nSignificant in \none \ntranche 2 \nscheme, \nand not \nsignificant \nfor others \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nLimited \nImpact \n\nLabor \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor \nretrenchment \n Core labor \nstandards \nAffordability \n\nLimited \nimpact \n\nLimited \nimpact \n\nLimited or \nno impact \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman \ntrafficking \nOthers \n\n(conflict, political \ninstability, etc), \nplease specify \n\n \n\nIV.

The  Orissa \n\n1. \nIrrigated  Agriculture  and  Water \nManagement  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program)  aims  to  enhance  the  productivity \nand  sustainability  of  irrigation  systems  in  the  four  northern  river  basins  plus  a  part  of  the \nMahanadi  River  Delta.  Following  the  modality  of  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  and \nenvisaging  the  coverage  of  five  major  and  nine  medium-sized  irrigation  schemes,  and  up  to \n1,400 community-based minor lift irrigation schemes, its specific scope includes (i) participatory \nplanning with strengthening of water user associations; (ii) renovation and extension of irrigation \nand  associated  infrastructure  including  field  channel  systems;  (iii)  agriculture  and  allied  sector \nsupport and livelihood enhancement of the poor; and (iv) monitoring and support for sustainable \noperation  and  maintenance,  along  with  project  management  and  institutional  development.  All \nare existing schemes proposed for renovation, except for one scheme (the Mahanadi Chitropala \nIsland  Irrigation  subproject)  that  will  expand  its  canal  systems  to  about  5,940  hectares  (ha)  of \nnew command area to complete its original scope of investment. \n \nFor  the  purpose  of  the  first  Project  under  MFF,  feasibility  studies  were  undertaken  for \n2.  \ntwo major, three medium-sized, and two minor lift irrigation subprojects including the Mahanadi \nChitropala  Island  Irrigation  subproject.  This  resettlement  framework  (RF)  outlines  the  policy, \nprocedures,  and  institutional  requirements  for  preparing  and  implementing  resettlement  plans \n(RPs) for the subprojects to be included in the Investment Program.   \n  \n3.   \nResettlement  Policy.  Resettlement  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  Land \nAcquisition Act and the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation 2007 (Government \nof  India),  the  Orissa  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  Policy  2006,  and  the  relevant  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  policies  and  operations  manuals,  in  particular  the  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and the Operations Manual section on involuntary resettlement.1 \n \nResettlement  Principles,  Entitlements,  and  Procedures.  The  RF  applies  to  all \n4. \ninvoluntary resettlement effects\u2014including displacement of nontitled people\u2014arising from land \nacquisition  or  conversion,  or  any  other  effects  that  arise  from  the  project  works  including  the \neffects on people with no title to the land. Those affected will be entitled to maintain at least their \nstandard  of  living  at  pre-project  level,  and  to  receive  compensation  for  all  types  of  losses \nincluding land, crops, trees, structures, and any other assets at full replacement value. Affected \nhouseholds will receive (i) an additional cash grant to match replacement value to supplement \nthe grant provided by the district collector, and (ii) other resettlement assistance such as shifting \nallowances and compensation for loss of workdays and income due to dislocation. Households \nbelonging  to  scheduled  tribes,  if  any,  will  be  eligible  for  further  cash  assistance  for  relocation \nand  house  reconstruction.  People  involuntarily  displaced  will  receive  priority  assistance  under \nthe Investment Program\u2019s livelihood enhancement subcomponent.  \n \n5. \nThe types of loss and entitlements will cover (i) loss of titleholders, including agricultural \nland,  homestead  land  and  assets,  commercial  land  and  structure,  residential  tenancy  and \ncommercial tenancy; (ii) loss of nontitleholders, including agriculture land possessed by informal \nland  and/or \ntenants  (including  sharecroppers),  squatters  and  encroachers,  homestead \nhomestead  and  commercial  structure  possessed  by \ntenants,  squatters  and \nencroachers,  shifting  business,  and  kiosks;  (iii)  loss  of  livelihoods  (loss  of  wage  earnings, \nincomes from nonperennial and/or perennial crops such as fruit trees); (iv) additional support to \nvulnerable groups, including negative impacts on scheduled tribe families; (v) loss of community \n\ninformal \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

The  specific  details  of  the \nentitlements are shown in the resettlement framework in Supplementary Appendix M.  \n  \nInstitutional  Responsibilities  and  Procedures.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU) \n6. \nhas  overall  planning,  financing,  and  supervisory  responsibility  for  preparing  and  implementing \nthe  RPs,  with  the  support  of  the  consultants,  including  capacity  strengthening  and  monitoring. \nThe  PMU  will  have  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  manager  assigned  from  among  the \nsenior  staff  of  the  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  directorate  of  the  Department  of  Water \nResources  (DOWR),  under  the  guidance  of  the  project  director.  The  specific  works  will  be \ncarried  out  by  the  subproject  implementation  offices  (SIOs),  which  will  have  a  specialized \nresettlement  unit  comprising  experienced  officers  from  the  resettlement  and  rehabilitation \ndirectorate  in  case  any  subprojects  require  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  a  RP.  The \nresettlement  unit  will  work  closely  with  the  district  compensation  advisory  committee  for  the \nreplacement  valuation  of  the  assets.  Compensation  will  be  awarded  by  the  district  office,  and \nthe  resettlement  unit  will  pay  any  difference  between  the  award  rates  and  the  values  as \nstipulated in the RP. The PMU will engage experienced nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nto assist in the process. For future subprojects, the PMU with the assistance of the consultants \nwill  undertake  assessments  on  social  impacts;  resettlement  due  diligence  will  be  undertaken \nbased  on  preliminary  technical  designs,  and  full  or  short  RPs  will  be  prepared  as  necessary. \nThe draft RPs as prepared will be submitted to ADB for approval.2 Affected persons (APs) will \nbe fully compensated before award of the relevant civil works contracts.    \n \n7. \nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievances. The RP will be prepared and implemented \nin  close  consultation  with  the  stakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group  discussions  and \nmeetings with the APs, with disclosure of information in the form of brochures written in the local \nlanguage.  Copies  of  the  RF  and  draft  RPs  will  be  distributed  among  NGOs  and  community \ngroups  prior  to  finalizing  the  engineering  design.  They  will  also  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite. A grievance redress committee will be established headed by the district collector and \ncomprising  representatives  of  the  APs,  local  governments,  and  the  NGOs  to  resolve  any  AP \ngrievances.  People\u2019s  participation  will  also  be  ensured  by  including  APs  representatives  with \nNGO facilitation in the district compensation advisory committee.     \n \n8. \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  DOWR,  with  assistance  from  the  consultant \nresettlement specialist, will establish a monthly monitoring system involving the PMU, SIOs, and \nimplementing  NGOs,  and  prepare  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  (covering  staff  appointment  and  capacities,  planning,  scheduling  and  budgeting; \ndelivery of entitlements; consultation, grievance, and other issues; and resettlement impacts) in \nthe  quarterly  reports.  An  annual  report  stipulating  all  efforts  and  outcome  will  be  submitted  to \nADB.  External  monitoring  will  also  be  assigned  to  an  independent  local  agency,  which  will \nreview  the  progress  and  performance  of  RP  preparation  and  implementation,  and  report  the \nfindings and recommendations to the DOWR and ADB.  \n \n9. \nResettlement  Cost.  The cost of land acquisition and resettlement is estimated at $4.7 \nmillion including NGO services, based on the assessment of the replacement value of the land \nand  assets  to  be  acquired.  The  Orissa  state  government  will  provide  the  entire  fund  for  land \nacquisition and resettlement, and will guarantee meeting unforeseen obligations in excess of the \nbudget estimate to meet the resettlement objectives. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   In  the  event  that  the  RPs  are  revised  with  the  process  of  the  detailed  designs,  such  revised  RPs  will  also  be \n\nsubmitted to ADB for approval. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATIONS \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n67 \n\nIsland  (major \n\nirrigation),  Mahanadi  Chitropala \n\nIn  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines,  initial  environmental \n1. \nexaminations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  as  part  of  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(TA)  for  the  Orissa  Integrated  Irrigated  Agriculture  and  Water  Management  Investment \nProgram.  The  IEEs  assessed  the  environmental  implications  of  the  specific  loan  interventions \nand  identified  mitigating  measures.  In  view  of  the  diversity,  scale,  and  extent  of  the  project \ninterventions, IEEs for all major and medium-sized irrigation subprojects for the first tranche of \nthe multitranche financing facility (MFF Project 1) were prepared, along with the IEEs for sample \nsubprojects  for  minor  lift  irrigation  subprojects\u2014Gohira  (medium-sized  irrigation),  Taladanda \nirrigation),  Remal  (medium-sized \n(major \nirrigation),  Sunei  (medium-sized  irrigation),  Jaldha  (minor  lift  irrigation),  and  Parimukundapur \n(minor lift irrigation). Project 1 has been classified as environmental category B.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  focuses  on  planning  within  the  five  contiguous  basins  of  the \n2. \nstate  by  adopting  a  basin  management  approach  to  support  the  state\u2019s  critical  agenda  for \nenhancing the productivity and sustainability of existing underutilized major, medium-sized, and \nminor  (lift)  irrigation  projects.  The  basins  are  the  Brahmani,  Baitarani,  Budhabalanga,  and \nSubernarekha (covering 29% of the state and supporting 33% of the overall population). It also \nincludes  part  of  Mahanadi  River  Delta.  The  Investment  Program  aims  to  reduce  the  regional \nimbalance in infrastructure development and to increase the productivity including remote areas \nthrough  sustainable  water  management  with  participatory  irrigation  management  (PIM)  and \nadopting an integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach.  \n \nB. \n\nEnvironment Conditions for the Investment Program Areas \n\nOrissa  is  rich  in  surface  and  groundwater  resources,  and  receives  approximately  231 \n3. \nbillion cubic meters (m3) of rainfall annually, of which approximately 80% flows to the ocean as \nsurface  runoff.1 There  are  a  total  of  11  river  basins  in  Orissa,  of  which  the  Mahanadi  is  the \nbiggest  river  system.  The  state  covers  155.7  square  kilometers,  and  its  land  utilization \ncomprises cultivated area (45%), forest (37%), nonagricultural land (6%), barren land (5%), and \nothers (7%). The forest area has rich flora and fauna,2 but is increasingly under pressure due to \nillegal logging, fuel wood collection, agriculture and pastoral encroachment, forest fires, mining, \nand other related development activities. The natural regeneration in many forests is poor due \nto forest fire. Intense grazing and other human activities, invasion of exotic species, and loss of \nendemic flora and fauna, are other problems related to forest degradation.  \n \n4. \nWhile the state\u2019s water resources are abundant overall, river flows have high spatial and \ntemporal variation due to the high concentration of rainfall within an 80-day period each year. As \nsuch,  the  available  flow  cannot  provide  irrigation  to  the  full  command  area  of  most  irrigation \nsystems.  In  addition,  the  state  has  substantial  mineral  deposits,  the  exploitation  of  which  is \nputting increasing pressure on the environment, in particular on water quality. The ongoing and \nplanned  industrial  development  is  adding  further  pressure  and  concern.  These  issues  call  for \ncoordinated water use within and among the irrigation and other users, in particular for the dry \nseason, and effective monitoring and regulation of water quality within the context of IWRM.  \n                                                 \n1   In  2001  the  average  availability  of  surface  water  was  120  billion  cubic  meters  (m3),  or 3,280  m3  per  person,  and \n\ngroundwater availability was 13 billion m3, or 340 m3 per person. \n\n2   There  are  six  main  forest  types  found  in  the  state  of  Orissa,  namely  tropical  semi-evergreen,  tropical  moist \n\ndeciduous, tropical dry deciduous, subtropical broad-leaved hill, and scattered littoral and mangrove forests. \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nThe  project  strategy  of  rehabilitating  the  existing  schemes  in  an  effort  to  improve  the \n5. \nreliability  of  diversion  and  efficiency  in  water  use  with  institutional  development  will  mean  that \npotential  environmental  impacts  will  generally  be  positive.  Potential  environmental  concerns \ninclude water-use conflicts and quality deterioration in areas of water scarcity, particularly in the \ndry  season.  Water  and  soil  quality  may  also  be  affected  as  a  result  of  enhanced  agricultural \nactivities in the concerned schemes. Given that subproject works are generally on a small scale \nand  confined  to  existing  agricultural  land,  they  can  be  kept  minimal  with  little  cumulative \nimpacts, through due environmental consideration to screening, planning, and implementation.  \n\nSummary of Initial Environmental Examinations Prepared for Subprojects \n\nSubproject Description. Key features of the subprojects are summarized Table A14.1.  \n\nTable A14.1: Summary of Scope of Principal Works for Subprojects \n\nMajor: Taladanda and Mahanadi \nChitropala Island Irrigation (MCII) \nMahanadi River Delta (Stage I \narea) \n\nTaladanda: Renovation \nMCII: Extension \nTaladanda: 32,700 ha \nMCII: 13,300 ha (5,940 ha new) \nTaladanda: Canal system \nrenovation (83 km main, 115 km \ndistributary, and 386 km minor), \ncross regulators, inspection roads \nand bridges, minor drainage, and \ncommand area development (CAD) \nMCII: Extension of branch (52 km) \nand minor (61 km), and ancillary \nstructures (e.g., cross-drainage \nworks, canal bridges), CAD \n\nMedium-sized: Gohira, \nRemal, and Sunei \nGohira: Brahmani basin \nRemal: Baitarani basin \nSunei: Budhabalanga basin \nRenovation \n\nMinor Lift: Jaldha and \nParimukundapur \nJaldha: Subernarekha basin \nParimukundapur: Brahmani \nbasin \nRenovation \n\nGohira: 8,300 ha; Remal: \n4,310 ha; Sunei: 10,000 ha \nCombined Total: Minor \nrepair of reservoir facilities, \ncanal renovation (96 km \ndistributary and 234 km \nminor), ancillary facilities \n(cross regulators, inspection \nroads, drop structures, etc.), \nCAD \n \n\nJaldha: 20 ha (groundwater) \nParimukundapur: 40 ha (river) \nJaldha: Electrical installation, \npump house renovation, buried \ndistribution system with \ndistribution box, CAD. \nParimukundapur: two pump \nunits, electrical installation, \ndistribution systems with \ndistribution box, CAD \n\nC. \n\n6. \n\nItem \n\nLocation \n\nSubproject \ntype \nCommand \narea \nNature and \nscope of \nheadwork and \ncanal network \nimprovements \n\nCAD = command area development, MCII = Mahanadi Chitropala Island Irrigation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nThe above physical works will be accompanied by support for institutional strengthening \n7. \nincluding  water  user  association  strengthening,  agriculture  and  allied  sector  support  services \nsuch  as  agriculture  extension  and  exposure  visits,  and  livelihood  enhancement  of  the  poor  to \nsupport their capacities for income generation.   \n\nPotential  Environmental \n\n8. \nthe \nenvironmental  assessment  of  the  subprojects,  the  following  impacts  and  mitigation  measures \nhave been summarized for the Investment Program. \n\nImpacts  and  Mitigation  Measures.  Based  on \n\nTable A14.2: Summary of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nMitigation Measures  \n\nImpact \nA. Construction Phase \nPhysical Environment \nStability of the embankments. The slope stability of the \nembankments may be affected adversely during the \nconstruction phase due to adjacent canal excavation work \nin Taladanda and MCII. There is also a possibility of small-\nscale erosion. To minimize this, the construction methods \nwill control surface erosion as far as is practical.     \nAirborne dust. The construction activities will temporarily \nincrease the level of dust particles in the surrounding area.  \n\nThe construction activities will be strictly carried out \nemploying sound technology. Blasting will not be allowed.  \nCut and fill mass management methods will be applied. \nProtective measures such as construction of protection \nwalls, catchments, drains, and plantations will be adopted \nin areas with erosion problems.   \nUse of masks or dust guards among the laborers will be \nencouraged, with regular sprinkling of water during the day.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n69 \n\nImpact \nWater quality. Water in the streams may get polluted due \nto the construction works. The impact will be direct, low, \nlocal and short term during the construction phase only. \nGiven the limited space on the access roads to the \nsubproject sites for two-way vehicular traffic, there is an \nincreased chance for vehicular and other accidents. \n\nConstruction debris. The mismanagement of unused \nconstruction materials may have long-term implications. \nBiological Environment \nWaterborne pathogens in nonirrigated areas. Increased \nchance of waterborne vectors \n\nVegetation and other resources. Most of the forests \nalong the canal alignment will be government-owned land. \nThe impact on these resources is expected to be limited as \nthey are already developed.   \n\nSocial, Economic, and Cultural Environment \nDisruption due to rehabilitation works. The subprojects \nmay partially damage the existing irrigation canals, local \ncommon facilities, etc. \nOccupational safety. Occupational safety issues and \npublic health concerns will be the most important element \nduring the construction phase in the absence of attention \nto personal accident coverage for construction laborers. \nB. Planning and Operational Phases \nPhysical Environment \nWater balance requirements. Uneven water flows and \nimbalances if not monitored correctly could negatively \naffect downstream users and habitats. \n\nMitigation Measures  \n\nThe project will design the drainage systems by \nconsidering the flow, conveyance, disposal of surface water \nrunoff from the construction works (e.g., with check dams).   \nTo minimize the accidents, proper road safety measures \nwill be adopted. The road safety guidelines and codes by \nthe Department of Road will be followed. This should be \ncommunicated to the residents close to the work sites.  \nAfter completion of construction activities, the construction \ndebris and excess debris will be reused where possible.  \n\nAt present this is a significant problem in nonirrigated areas \ncontributing to greater incidence of disease. Farmers will \nbe trained in safer farm practices (including health aspects) \nto help reduce breeding grounds, etc.  \nLoss of vegetation will be minimized through judicious site \nclearance and adoption of appropriate protection \nmeasures.  Temporary loss of vegetation at the work site \nwill be revegetated after the completion of the civil works. \nThe directives of the Ministry of Environment and Forests \nand the soil conservation cell of the Department of Water \nResources will be strictly followed. During revegetation, \nlocal species identified during the survey will be used.   \n\nCareful planning will be done to avoid any damage to \nexisting infrastructure. Funds will be allocated to avoid \nfunding problems at a later stage or after work completion. \nSafety-related local orientations to the workforce and the \nfield staff will be carried out on a regular fixed basis. A first \naid box and medical facilities will be made available at the \nwork site. \n\nThe water use pattern of the schemes has been developed \nwithin the existing water balance (and the impacts are \ndeemed insignificant with most schemes focusing on \nrehabilitation and relatively small extension works). \nHowever, available flows need to be carefully monitored, \nand water-use needs adjusted at times of very low flows \nthrough effective communication with WUAs (within the \nscheme) and between DOWR and different water users \n(particularly in case of subprojects in the Mahanadi River \nDelta stage 1).a Infrastructure design and operation will \nalso incorporate proportional offtakes and canal rotations in \nwater shortage periods. \nThese impacts will be mitigated by including sustainable \nland-use practices in agriculture extension, such as \npromoting organic-based practices, optimal use of \nfertilizers with provision of soil testing kits, and extension \nservices on integrated pest management.  \nA sustainable approach to control soil erosion will be \nbrought into practice. This could be developed through \nlocal maintenance groups.  \n\nIncreased use of agriculture chemicals. The \nrehabilitated infrastructure and subproject programs will \nenhance agriculture productivity that may cause soil and \nwater contamination due to increased agrochemical use \nand livestock activities, and reduce soil nutrients.  \nSoil erosion. The proposed rehabilitation works will be \ndesigned to strategically minimize soil erosion. There may \nbe several unstable embankments.   \nBiological Environment \nMaintenance. Regular maintenance of the canal works \nand environmental mitigation measures are not routinely \ncarried out during the operation phase, which may result in \nthe gradual degradation of the environmental protection \nmeasures adopted during the construction phase.   \nDOWR  =  Department  of  Water  Resources,  MCII  =  Mahanadi  Chitropala  Island  Irrigation,  WUA  =  water  user \nassociation. \n\nAn innovative and sustainable approach to maintenance of \nthe infrastructure thus created, will have to be brought in to \npractice. This could be developed through the WUAs for \nwhom there are direct incentives involved.  \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\na  Overall water balance at Mahanadi is regularly monitored by DOWR along with flow utilization by various users, \nparticularly  domestic  and  industrial  users  who  may  have  increasing  future  requirements.  Downstream \nenvironmental flow of 150 m3 as given in the Mahanadi River Basin Plan (2004) will also be examined. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nPublic  Consultation.  Public  consultation  and  disclosure  was  completed  during  the \n9. \nproject  preparatory  TA  in  the  subproject  areas.  Activities  consisted  of  disseminating  project \ninformation  among  stakeholders  combined  with  household  surveys  and \nfocus-group \ndiscussions.  Stakeholders\u2019  views  of  the  proposed  project  and  their  concerns  have  been  taken \ninto  account  and  incorporated  into  the  project  design.  Specific  details  of  this  are  provided  in \nindividual  IEE  reports  that  have  been  prepared.  Continued  public  participation  from  design  to \noperation will be an important aspect of all subproject works, which will be carried out through \nthe water user associations. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nAt  the  Department  of  Water  Resources  (DOWR)  headquarters,  a  central  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be set up and will be responsible for overall implementation of the \nproject  including  environmental  management.  The  PMU  will  have  an  environmental  cell \ncomprising  a  senior  environmental  engineer  having  sufficient  experience  in  environmental \nmanagement  of  irrigation  projects  who  is  seconded  from  Department  of  Forest  and \nEnvironment,  along  with  designated  environmental  engineers  from  the  Orissa  Planning \nOrganization of the DOWR. The environmental cell will bear overall responsibility for preparing \nthe IEE and/or environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports of the further subprojects under \nthe  multitranche  financing  facility  in  coordination  with  the  external  agencies,  obtaining \nenvironmental  clearances  as  necessary,  and  implementation  of  environmental  management \nplans at the subproject level. At each subproject level, a subproject implementation office will be \nset up, where an assistant executive engineer will be assigned as chief officer responsible for \nenvironmental  management.  A  total  budget  of  $770,000  has  been  assigned  to  cover  the \nnecessary  costs  for  IEE  and  EIA  reports  of  further  subprojects,  and  staffing  including \ninstitutional strengthening activities.  \n \nBased  on  the  IEE  and  stakeholder  consultation  and  following  ADB  guidelines  and  the \n11. \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  requirements, 3  project-specific  environmental  assessment  and \nreview  framework  (EARF)  were  prepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  O). 4  Under  the  EARF, \nenvironmental considerations are made fundamental to the Investment Program approach and \nwill be introduced from a very early stage of subproject selection and planning.5 Emphasis will \nbe  placed  on  incorporating  environmental  considerations  into  each  stage  of  the  subproject \ncycle; for example, avoiding environmental damage as far as possible through proper planning; \nminimizing  the  damage  risk  through  environmentally  sensitive  design  and  the  use  of  sound \ntechnology; and controlling potential damage through proper management practices employed \nduring  the  implementation  phase.  The  proposed  environmental  planning  and  mitigation  works \nhave  been  elaborated  upon  in  detail  in  the  environmental  management  plan  and  have  been \nfurther expanded in the EARF document where efforts have been made to ensure that this work \nis consistent with the environmental guidelines of the state and national Government.  \n                                                 \n3   Including the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006; Water and \n\nAir Acts, Forest Act, 1980; and Wild Life Act, 1972, among others.  \n\n4   In the context of MFF Project 1, DOWR and PMU will be responsible for preparing environmental assessment for \n\nabout 650 minor lift irrigation schemes to be identified during the implementation period following the EARF. \n\n5   The  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  subprojects  will  ultimately  depend  on  type,  size,  and  location.  The \nEARF  has  incorporated  (i)  environmental  criteria  for  subproject  eligibility,  planning,  design,  and  implementation; \nand (ii) individual screening and assessment of each subproject as to the potential impacts on the environment. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 August 2008)  \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Indian rupee(s) (Re/Rs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n \n", "Rs1.00 \n$1.00 \n \n", "$0.0235  \nRs42.49 \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS  \n", "ADB \nAP \nCAD \nDOWR \nEARF \nEA \nEIA \nEIRR \nFFA \nFYP \nGDP \nICB \nIEE \nIP \nISPM \nIWRM \nJBIC \nLIBOR \nMCII \nMFF \nMIS \nMLI \nMTFWFPF \n", "NCB \nNGO \nNIA \nNWP \nO&M \nOFID \nOPEC \nOSG \nPFR \nPIM \nPMU \nRF \nRP \nSGIA \nSIO \nSIP \nSOE \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \naffected person \ncommand area development \nDepartment of Water Resources \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nframework financing agreement \nfive-year plan \ngross domestic product \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nindigenous people \ninstitutional strengthening and project management \nintegrated water resources management \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMahanadi Chitropala Island Irrigation \nmultitranche financing facility \nmanagement information system \nminor lift irrigation \nMulti-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility \nnational competitive bidding \nnongovernment organization \nnet irrigated area \nNational Water Policy \noperation and maintenance \nOPEC Fund for International Development \nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries \nOrissa state government \nperiodic financing request \nparticipatory irrigation management \nproject management unit \nresettlement framework \nresettlement plan \nsecond-generation imprest account \nsubproject implementation office \nsubproject implementation plan \nstatement of expenditure \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "TA \nWALMI \nWUA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "technical assistance \nWater and Land Management Institute \nwater user association \n", " \n", " \n \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  of  the  Government  of  India  ends  on  31  March.  \u201cFY\u201d  before  a \ncalendar year denotes the year in which the fiscal year ends, e.g., FY2007 ends \non 31 March 2007.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", "B.
