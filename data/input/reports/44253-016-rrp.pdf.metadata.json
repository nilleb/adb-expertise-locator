The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe development problem. The Philippines has achieved high economic growth rates, \nwhich  averaged  6.4%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  during  2012\u20132015.  However,  poverty \nrates declined only marginally to 25.8% in 2014 from 27.9% in 2012. Reductions in poverty have \nnot  been  inclusive  or  evenly  distributed  as  regional  disparities  have  continued  to  widen.  The \npoor are overwhelmingly concentrated in the southern regions and in rural areas. For example, \npoverty rates in the National Capital Region are less than 3%, while poverty rates exceed 48% \nin  Autonomous  Region  in  Muslim  Mindanao,  and  37%  in  eastern  Visayas  and  Soccsksargen. \nDisparities in access to services are also large. Only 25% of the rural population has access to \nsafe water, compared with 88% in the National Capital Region. Infant mortality rates are three \ntimes higher in the regions of Caraga, Mimaropa, or eastern Visayas compared with the capital.3 \n\n4. \nLGUs  play  a  central  role  in  ensuring  comparable  levels  of  service  delivery  across  the \nPhilippines. LGUs accounted for some 27% of total government expenditures in 2014 (excluding \ndebt  amortization),  up  from  25%  in  2011,  and  represented  approximately  4%  of  GDP. 4 \nNevertheless,  the  scope  and  efficiency  of  LGU  service  delivery  are  limited.  National-local \ngovernment  relations  are  weighed  down  by  the  overlapping  and  unclear  assignments  of \nfunctions  across  various levels  of government. This  has  led  to  duplication  of  efforts,  inefficient \nuse of resources, and numerous mandates without funding. As a consequence, critical services \nare  often  not  delivered,  or  are  delivered  in  insufficient  quantities.  For  example,  the  national \ngovernment  instructs  LGUs  to  deliver  services  in  support  of  national  priorities  but  does  not \nprovide the LGUs with an appropriate level of financial resources. In either case, the welfare of \nlocal communities is adversely affected. \n\n5. \nWhile  a  system  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfers\u2014the  internal  revenue  allotment \n(IRA)\u2014provides much-needed revenues, the system is based on a rigid formulaic approach that \ndoes not consider the fiscal capacity of local governments. Compounding this issue, the ability \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2014.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Programmatic \nApproach  and  Policy-Based  Loan  for  Subprogram  1  to  the  Republic  of  Philippines  for  the  Local  Government \nFinance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform Program. Manila.  \n\n2  Local  Government  Code.  1991.  The  Philippines  has  17  regions,  81  provinces,  38  independent  cities,  107 \n\ncomponent cities, 1,490 municipalities, and 42,029 barangays.  \n\n3  Philippine Institute for Development Studies.

LGUs  also  face  limited \naccess  to  the  debt  capital  markets.  This  inhibits  their  ability  to  efficiently  plan  and  execute \ninvestment  programs.  Finally,  local  public  financial  management  (PFM)  systems  are  outdated \nand do not ensure transparency or support effective monitoring by civil society. \n \n6. \nThe  binding  constraints.  As  a  result,  LGUs  are  unable  to  enhance  local  economic \ndevelopment  and  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  at  the  local  level.  Moreover,  the \naccountability between LGUs and their constituents that is expected from an efficient local  tax \nsystem has been diluted. These issues perpetuate regional disparities in poverty reduction in a \nnumber  of  ways.  First,  regional  disparities  limit  inclusive  growth  and  employment-generating \nopportunities  for  the  country  as  a  whole  as  lagging  regions  struggle  to  develop  a  skilled \nworkforce  and  lack  the  conditions  necessary  for  business  development.  Second,  less \nprosperous  localities  are  unlikely  to  develop  good governance  practices,  including  transparent \nand efficient service delivery systems, due to a lack of accountability between constituents and \ntheir local governments. This lack of basic services restrains the development prospects of the \nPhilippines.  Third,  the  resultant  weakness  in  revenue  collection  increases  pressure  on  the \nnational government to provide fiscal transfers, which affects fiscal stability and sustainability. \n \nDuring  2010\u20132013,  ADB  supported  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  address  the  first  set  of \n7. \ndevelopment constraints: (i) inadequate and inequitable resource mobilization, (ii) weaknesses \nin PFM systems at the national and local levels, and (iii) ineffective feedback and accountability \nsystems (footnote 1). Subprogram 1 strengthened the demand side of the decentralized system \nof government by introducing performance-based monitoring systems and grants mechanisms, \nand  improved  the  transparency  and  accountability  of  LGUs.  Subprogram  1  also  began  the \ndevelopment  of  a  medium-  to  long-term  fiscal  decentralization  road  map  and  launched  an \nambitious  first-ever  review  of  the  Local  Government  Code  (LGC)  of  1991.  The  review,  which \nwas  supported  by  ADB,  covered  the  LGC\u2019s  fiscal  provisions  and  identified  the  next  set  of \ndevelopment  constraints  as  well  as  a  framework  to  further  improve  intergovernmental  fiscal \nrelations.  Subprogram  2  will  now  address  this  remaining  set  of  development  constraints.  The \nLGC,  which  interconnects  and  anchors  the  activities  of  LGUs,  suffers  from  structural \ndeficiencies that prevent an equitable distribution of fiscal transfers, limit the size of own-source \ntax  revenue  available  to  LGUs,  and  restrict  their  ability  to  access  debt  capital  markets.  This \nlimits the capacity of LGUs to efficiently deliver services that are responsive to the needs of their \nconstituents. In response, the government has embarked on a sequenced reform program that \nwill  address  the  following  constraints  (discussed  in  paras  8  to  11)  by  prioritizing  those  that  do \nnot require a change in law while simultaneously pursuing an effort to amend the LGC.  \n \n8. \nLGUs have a limited capacity to raise revenue. Highly urbanized centers are able to \ngenerate  large  amounts  of  revenues  from  local  taxes,  while  rural  LGUs  are  not.  Overall,  tax \nassessment  mechanisms  and  the  capacity  of  LGUs  to  collect  tax  in  coordination  with  the \nnational  government  need  to  be  improved.  Tax  and  nontax  revenues  for  LGUs  accounted  for \n34% of their total operating income in 2014. However, this metric is misleading as LGU finances \nare  still  highly  dependent  on  fiscal  transfers  from  the  national  government.  For  example,  local \ntax  revenue  of  all  provinces  in  the  aggregate  represented  only  0.06%  of  GDP  in  2013.  LGUs \nhave  been  provided,  by  law,  with  a  very  limited  set  of  potential  taxes  that  can  be  used  to \nstrengthen  local  tax  bases.  Moreover,  these  potential  revenue  sources  suffer  from  inefficient \ndesign  and  require  frequent  regulatory  changes.  While  LGUs  have  been  granted  borrowing \npowers, there are implicit provisions that restrict their access to credit, including a cumbersome \napproval process and a narrow scope of approved borrowing purposes.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fPublic  financial  management  systems  are  inefficient.  Efficient  PFM  provides  the \n9. \nframework through which public services are delivered effectively and efficiently.  However, the \nabsence  of  a  strategic  vision  has  resulted  in  a  piecemeal  approach  which  focused  only  on \nreforming individual elements of the PFM system. Budget operation systems are outdated and \nprevent  the  synchronization  of  planning  and  budgeting.  Expenditure  targeting  needs  to  be \nimproved.  Regulations  governing  PFM  at  the  LGU  level  need  to  be  aligned  with  national \nexpenditure priorities and institutionalized. New initiatives at the national level which encourage \nand reward enhanced PFM at the LGU level, such as the Assistance to LGU Program (ALGUP) \nand the Performance Challenge Fund (PCF), are not coordinated with local development plans.5 \nKey  LGU  policies,  such  as  those  covering  local  economic  enterprises,  the  Special  Education \nFund, and disaster risk management, do not incorporate the recently established performance-\nbased management systems such as the seal of good local governance (SGLG) system. \n\n10. \nLocal  government  accountability  systems  are  underdeveloped.  Performance \nmeasurement systems are critical to ensuring that local budgets are responsive to local needs \nand  aligned  with  national  development  priorities.  However,  local  constituents  do  not  have  the \nmeans to monitor and evaluate, or provide feedback on the budget performance of LGUs. The \nperformance evaluation systems currently in use do not provide useful data to guide investment \ndecisions, do not allow for inter-local comparisons, and are not easily accessible to the public. In \naddition, the number of these performance measurement instruments has multiplied which has \nincreased LGUs compliance costs. Performance mechanisms for LGUs also need to be binding, \nas well as compliant with transparency policies. \n\n11. \nFiscal  transfers  are  not  equitably  distributed.  The  IRA  is  the  largest  national \ngovernment transfer, representing close to two-thirds of the aggregate income of LGUs in 2014  \n(\u20b1341 billion). The  IRA  is  divided among different  LGUs  as follows:  23% to  provinces,  23% to \ncities,  34%  to  municipalities,  and  20%  to  barangays.  The  IRA  share  of  each  tier  of  local \ngovernment  is  then  apportioned  to  individual  LGUs  within  each  level  based  on  population \n(50%), land area (25%), and equal sharing (25%). The IRA does not consider the fiscal capacity \nof LGUs, which causes large disparities in expenditure per capita and limits the ability of poorer \nLGUs to deliver a level of basic services comparable with the more well-off LGUs. \n\nThe  government\u2019s  sector  strategy.  The  PDP,  2011\u20132016  identifies  three  primary \n12. \nobjectives: (i) promoting inclusive growth and generating employment, (ii) improving governance \nand human development standards, and (iii) achieving macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability. \nThe  Good  Governance  and  Anti-Corruption  Cabinet  Cluster  (GGACC)  coordinates  the \nimplementation  of  the  government\u2019s  initiatives  to  strengthen  public  institutions,  promote \ntransparency,  and  increase  accountability  through  participatory  governance.  Within  this \nframework,  the  PFM  road  map  provides  a  comprehensive  reform  agenda  to  ensure  that  the \nnational  government  is  able  to  maintain  fiscal  discipline,  allocate  funds  efficiently,  and  provide \nefficient service delivery. For example, the road map calls for the development of an integrated \nfinancial  management  information  system  that  can  provide  web-based  access  to  LGU \ninformation  in  a  common  format.  Emphasis  is  also  being  placed  on  performance-informed \nbudgeting  to  strengthen  alignment  with  national  priorities,  reinforce  accountability,  and  better \nengage  civil  society.  Efforts  to  promote  decentralization  and  strengthen  PFM  are  expected  to \ncontinue under the draft PDP for 2017\u20132022 and will be supported by the LGU PFM reform road \nmap 2016\u20132022, which was adopted in 2015 as part of this program. The road map addresses \nthe  gaps  identified  in  the  2007  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  Assessment \n(PEFA)  through  four  sequenced  reform  clusters;  linking  budget  planning  to  policy  priorities, \n\n                                                \n5 ALGUP has superseded the Bottom-up Budgeting program. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fdeveloping  reliable  and  predictable  budgets,  increasing  transparency,  and  holding  managers \naccountable. \n\nADB\u2019s Engagement in PFM Reforms\n\n2013: Technical \nAssistance Grant for the \nSupport to Local \nGovernment Finance and \nFiscal Decentralization \nReform Program\n\n2018\u20132020: Proposed \nLocal Government \nDevelopment Program\n\n2004.

ADB  has  supported  local  government  reforms  in  the  Philippines \nsince 2004. The first programmatic approach focused on decentralization and local government \nfinance  by  institutionalizing  the  timely  and  transparent  release  of  LGU  shares  in  national \ngovernment  revenues.6 In  addition,  the  program  developed  the  pillars  of  a  performance-based \nLGU PFM framework, provided LGUs with limited access to credit financing, and strengthened \nthe  ability  of  national  oversight  agencies  to  monitor  LGU  finances.  Building  on  these \naccomplishments, the program (footnote 1) now serves as an umbrella to anchor ADB\u2019s support \nfor  broader  PFM  reform  and  its  expanding  engagement  with  LGUs.  For  example,  the \nEncouraging Investment through Capital Market Reforms  Program is providing complementary \nsupport  to  the  Bureau of  the  Treasury to  strengthen  debt management, cash flow forecasting, \nand  control  over  the  government\u2019s  cash  balances. 7  The  Expanding  Private  Participation  in \nInfrastructure  Program8 provides  support  to  the  national  government  and  LGUs  to  accelerate \nthe development of infrastructure, while the proposed (2016) Enhancing Youth School-to-Work \nTransition  Program  supports  measures  to  improve  employment,  including  labor  market \nactivation  programs  in  LGUs.  Continuing  support  to  LGUs  is  planned  through  the  Enhancing \nRural  Enterprise  and  Rural  Employment  Program,  planned  for  2017,  and  the  next  generation \nLocal Government Development Program, which is planned for 2018. \n\nfrequent \n\ninteragency  coordination.

Manila. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fengagement of stakeholders to incorporate the views of the business sector, academe, and civil \nsociety for successful reform implementation. This has been particularly true in the review of the \nLGC, among other initiatives. A third lesson was gained from the continuing dissemination of the \nlink  between  LGU  reform  and  the  achievement  of  the  country\u2019s  long-term  development  goals \nwhich enhanced stakeholder participation. In addition, good local governance is instrumental in \nensuring program implementation and, in particular, infrastructure development. \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s value added to the design and implementation of the program. Through the \nprovision of technical assistance and policy advice, ADB established a framework that improved \nthe administration of real estate and property taxes,9 and supported the completion of a number \nof  policy  reforms  under  the  program. 10  Notably,  ADB  provided  the  technical  and  logistical \nresources to complete the government-led review of the fiscal provisions of the LGC. ADB also \nprovided  capacity  development  to  improve  comprehensive  development  planning  and,  in \nparticular,  the  harmonization  of  the  different  planning  processes  linked  to  national  and  local \nprograms  (e.g.,  the  ALGUP  and  the  PCF).  ADB  strengthened  the  analytical  value  of  reporting \nthrough  the  implementation  of  financial  management  information  systems  for  LGUs  (e.g.,  the \nelectronic  statement  of receipts  and  expenditures  [eSRE]). Technical  assistance was provided \nto  assess  the  impact  of  national  tax  incentives  on  local  government  revenues  and  economic \ngrowth, identify new sources of local revenue for LGUs, and develop a financing framework for \nLGU  alliances  that  assists  joint  service  delivery.  Finally,  ADB  encouraged  the  civil  society  to \nplay  an  enhanced  role  in  LGUs  by  reengineering  the  local  government  performance \nmeasurement system to align it with the SGLG. \n\nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  The  program  has  benefited \n\n16. \nfrom  close \ncoordination  with  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  through  joint  missions  and \nonsite  reviews.  AFD  provided  parallel  financing  in  the  amount  of  $150  million  equivalent  for \nsubprogram 1 and plans an equivalent amount of support for subprogram 2.  In addition, close \ncoordination  has  been  sustained  with  the  European  Union-led  LGU  Public  Finance  Reform \nProgram  through  the  CCD.  Coordination  with  other  development  partners  (such  as  the  World \nBank,  Australia,  and  Canada)  has  been  assisted  by  the  work  of  the  Philippine  Development \nForum working group on decentralization. \n\nPolicy-based loan and budget support. The programmatic approach was selected as \n17. \nit  leverages  government  and  stakeholder  engagement  and  supports  the  implementation  of  a \ncomplex  set  of  policy \ninto  a \ncomprehensive  and  cohesive  medium-term  reform  plan.  The  approach  is  optimized  by  the \nability  to  deliver  technical  assistance  from  several  development  partners  to  national  and  local \ngovernment agencies. The post-program partnership framework will support a continuing policy \ndialogue between the government and ADB. \n\nincluding  eventual  amendments \n\ninitiatives, \n\nlaw, \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nEconomic  impact  of  the  program.  Research  indicates  that  decentralization  of \n18. \ngovernment  expenditure  can  reduce  income  inequality,  given  a  sufficiently  large  government \nexpenditure  program,  comprehensive  decentralization,  and  most  importantly,  decentralization \non the revenue side to reduce LGU reliance on the IRA.11 Therefore the program  will  increase \nthe efficiency of service provision  by LGUs through a better allocation of budgetary resources. \nThe  economic  benefits  will  be  achieved  by  aligning  expenditure  assignments  across  tiers  of \n\n                                                \n9  ADB.  2011.

The outcome will be \nefficient and transparent local government financial management systems developed. There are \nfour  major  outputs  which  are  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  reform  priorities.  Subprogram  2 \nincludes  26  policy  actions  (14  triggers  and  12  milestones),  which  were  completed  from  July \n2013 to May 2016.12 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n20. \nOutput  1:  Resource  framework  for  fiscal  sustainability  developed.  LGUs  need  to \nincrease  their  own  source  revenue.  As  LGUs  currently  generate  tax  revenues  primarily  from \nbusiness and real estate taxes, the government improved the assessment of real estate market \nvalues  and  strengthened  the  capacity  of  the  personnel  that  conduct  tax  assessments.  In \naddition,  the  government  developed  proposals  to  reform  property  and  business  taxes,  and  to \ncreate  new  tax  instruments  for  LGUs.13 Access  to  the  Bureau for  Internal  Revenue\u2019s  taxpayer \ndatabase  was  increased  and  the  related  reporting  requirements  are  now  an  assessment \ncriterion in the performance standards of local treasurers and assessors. As a result, aggregate \nproperty taxes collected by LGUs increased by 48% between 2010 and 2015. \n \n21. \nThe government also increased LGU access to credit financing through the deployment \nof  new  eSRE  modules  on  LGU  creditworthiness  to the  regional  offices  of  the  Bureau  of  Local \nGovernment Finance (BLGF) of the Department of Finance (DOF). The modules allow LGUs to \nestimate  their  debt  borrowing  limits  and  provide  a  solid  technical  instrument  for  the  DOF  to \nvalidate the borrowing capacity of LGUs. In addition, a dedicated Debt Monitoring Unit has been \ncreated in the BLGF, which is designing and maintaining LGU monitoring procedures, collecting \nconsolidated LGU borrowing data, and issuing regular publications. \n \n22. \nConcurrently,  the  government  strengthened  its  oversight  of  LGU  expenditures.  A  new \nmodule  under  the  eSRE  provides  a  publicly  available  means  of  monitoring  LGU  capital \nexpenditures  from  the  development  fund. 14  In  addition,  reporting  mechanisms  have  been \nincorporated  into  the  ALGUP  to  capture  and  monitor  the  capital  expenditure  of  LGUs,  and  to \nfacilitate  ex  post  monitoring  through  the  Commission  of  Audit\u2019s  annual  audits.  Eligibility  to \naccess  development  funds,  including  the  PCF  and  ALGUP,  has  been  tied  to  the  SGLG  to \nincentivize performance-based management in local governments. Expanding on the initial Seal \nof Good Financial Housekeeping, the SGLG validates that LGUs comply with national legal and \npolicy  requirements \nincluding  disaster  preparedness, \ncompetitiveness, and environment protection. \n \nOutput 2: Public financial management system to assist efficient local government \n23. \nunit  service  delivery  strengthened.  To  provide  much-needed  strategic  guidance  and \ncontinuity, the government approved and implemented its LGU PFM road map and strategy. In \n                                                \n12 Subprogram  2  originally  proposed  59  policy  actions  and  sub-actions.  All  were  completed  as  originally  proposed. \n\nin  additional  performance  areas, \n\nSubsequently, the policy matrix was modified and streamlined to improve its presentation and readability. \n\n13 These proposals emanated from output 1 and the review of the LGC. \n14 The development fund is defined as 20% of the IRA allocation and is earmarked for capital investment projects. \n\n\frequires \n\nresponsive  PFM \n\nOutput  3:  Local  governance, \n\naddition,  the  government  updated  its  budget  and  planning  systems  and  synchronized  project \ndevelopment, planning, investment programming, and budgeting across all levels of government. \nThe  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  revised  the  Budget  Operations  Manual  to \ninstitutionalize  performance-informed  and  participatory  budgeting  processes  at  the  LGU  level. \nThe revised manual covers the preparation of medium-term expenditure frameworks for LGUs, \nand incorporates policy changes to dedicated funds (e.g., the Special Education Fund and the \nLocal  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  and  Management  Fund).  The  manual  also  incorporates  the \nprovisions  of  the  new  manual  on  local  economic  enterprises  along  with  enhanced  procedures \nfor internal audit. In addition, the government has upgraded financial management information \nsystems and completed a common database of financial information for LGUs. \n \n24. \nThe ALGUP initiative has been expanded and now encompasses over 1,514 LGUs with \nan  aggregate  expenditure  of  \u20b125  billion  ($517  million)  in  2015  compared  with  595  LGUs  and  \n\u20b18 billion ($165 million) in 2013. Concurrently, the government has  integrated the ALGUP into \nlocal  planning  process  through  synchronized  calendars,  formats,  terminologies,  and  the \ncomposition of consultative bodies.  Civil society provides inputs in the identification of projects \nand ensures funds are allocated in an increasingly equitable manner. \n \n25. \ntransparency,  and  accountability  systems \nestablished.  A  performance-based, \nthe \nparticipation  of  civil  society.  In  recognition,  the  government  has  improved  accountability \nmechanisms  between  LGUs  and  their  constituents.  The  Citizen\u2019s  Satisfaction  Index,  which \ncovered  35  cities  in  2013,  has  been  expanded  and  now  covers  140  cities  (2015).  The  index \nallows constituents to evaluate the performance of LGUs in the areas of health, governance and \nresponse,  environment  management,  public  works  and  infrastructure,  support  to  education, \nsocial welfare, tourism promotion, and agricultural support. Full disclosure of the results of the \nindex  is  required  as  a  binding  prerequisite  to  access  national  government  funds.  To  further \nexpand and strengthen the participation of civil society, the Department of the Interior and Local \nGovernance (DILG)  has  redesigned  the  Local Government  Performance  Management  System \nand,  over  time,  will  align  it  with  the  SGLG.  This  will  enhance  the  analytical  capacity  of  the \nsystem  to  assist  planning  and  budget  formulation  by  LGUs,  and  improve  access  of  local \nconstituents to the data and information contained in the system. \n \n26. \nTo  promote  an  accelerated  adoption  of  the  revised  performance-based  PFM  systems, \nthe government has implemented a program to test and evaluate the technical capacity of LGU \ntreasurers.  The  first  assessments  have  been  released.  In  addition,  the  DILG  upgraded  the \nNewly Elected Officials\u2019 training program, and provided training to 560 newly elected officials as \npart of the recent election cycle. Capacity development has also been provided to local planning \nofficers in select regions to improve the preparation of local comprehensive development plans. \nMoreover, the government has improved the implementation of gender and development plans \nfor LGUs by issuing guidelines to incorporate the Magna Carta for Women in LGU budgets and \ninvestment plans, and has deployed a system to monitor implementation.15 This effort has been \nsupported by training programs, delivered at the local level, to help LGUs identify and evaluate \nactivities in local gender and development plans. \n \n27. \nOutput  4:  Fiscal  framework  for  inclusive  growth  created.  Changes  to  the  legal \nframework are required to provide a more equitable system for intergovernmental fiscal relations. \nTo support an eventual revision of the LGC, the government completed the first comprehensive \n\ntransparency  and \n\n                                                \n15 The Magna Carta for Women (Republic Act 9710 dated 28 July 2008) is a comprehensive women's human rights \n\nlaw that seeks to eliminate discrimination and promote the rights of Filipino women. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nreview of the LGC in 25 years. The review, which was completed in 2015, was led by national \nand local government  agencies,  and  included  the participation  of  academe, the  private  sector, \ncivil  society,  and  development  partners.  The  DILG  submitted  the  results  of  the  review  to  all \nmembers  of the  GGACC,  and to  the  head  of the Oversight  Committee on  Devolution (i.e., the \nexecutive  secretary  to  the  government).  Two  of  the  proposals  (i.e.,  the  Valuation  Act  and  the \nLGU  Income  Classification  Bill)  were  filed  in  the  16th  Philippine  Congress,  and  have  reached \ndifferent  stages  of  progress.  Moreover,  the  recommendations  for  amendment  of  the  LGC \nobtained  from  the  review  have  provided  a  comprehensive  medium-term  road  map  for  fiscal \ndecentralization that will be available for the next administration. \n \nD. \n \nThe  government  has  requested  a  single-tranche  loan  of  $250  million  from  ADB\u2019s \n28. \nordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  2,  which  is  the  second  and  last \nsubprogram  of  a  programmatic  approach  (footnote  1).  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 12.1 years. The loan size is based on the financing \nneeds of the Philippines, the strength of the policy reform package, and its development impact. \nThe Philippines\u2019 gross financing needs are high. In 2016, with a budget deficit target of 2.7% of \nGDP, the government will need to borrow $6.9 billion, of which an estimated $1.5 billion will be \nsourced  through  official  development  assistance.  AFD  will  provide  parallel  financing  in  the \namount of $150 million equivalent. \n  \n29. \nThe government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  foreign \nexchange  of  economy-wide  imports,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2015, as amended from time to time). The loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Philippines as \nthe borrower. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  DOF  is  the  executing  agency  for  the  program  and  is  responsible  for  the  overall \n30. \nimplementation  of both subprograms  and  the medium-term results framework.  CCD  served  as \nthe  steering  committee  for  the  program,  as  it  includes  all  the  implementing  agencies  and \nrelevant stakeholders. CCD led the review of the LGC and submitted the recommendations to \nOversight  Committee  on  Devolution  for  consideration.  The  program\u2019s  implementing  agencies \ninclude the BLGF, the DILG, the DBM, and the National Economic and Development Authority. \nSubprogram 2 was implemented from July 2013 to May 2016. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  net  present  value  of  the  potential  gains from full  implementation  of  the  program  is \n31. \nestimated  to  be  $2  billion.  This  estimate  assumes  a  10%  discount  rate,  that  the  program \naccelerated the reforms by 10 years, and that the costs and expenditures grow at a real rate of \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\n3% a year. The program\u2019s benefits are derived from three primary sources: increased efficiency \nof  LGU  expenditure,  redistributive  gains  arising  out  of  a  realignment  of  the  IRA  towards \nrelatively poorer LGUs, and gains arising from more targeted and efficient spending programs. \nHowever, the primary benefit arising out of the reforms is clearly due to the increased efficiency \nof LGU service provision. In the aggregate, the direct costs of the program are estimated to total \n$1.4  billion.  This  includes  the  cost  of  financing  the  ALGUP  initiative,  estimated  at  around  \n$1.1 billion, the PCF and associated funds to the Seal of Good Governance (with an estimated \nbudget of $170 million), and costs related to policy development and administration.16 \n \nB. \n \n32. \nUnder the PDP, 2011\u20132016, the government has instituted an aggressive reform agenda \nto  create  an  enabling  environment  for  citizens  and  the  private  sector  (para.  11).  Under  this \nagenda,  the  implementation  of  the  2011  PFM  reform  road  map  has  achieved  measurable \nresults. The 2014 update of the 2010 PEFA noted that the average scores for three of the six \ndimensions  (comprehensiveness  and  transparency;  policy-based  budgeting;  and  accounting, \nrecording,  and  reporting)  have  improved.  The  remaining  areas  of  weakness  (e.g.,  budget \ncredibility,  predictability  and  control  in  budget  execution,  and  external  scrutiny  and  audit)  are \nbeing  addressed.  Budget  credibility  has  been  enhanced through  the  adoption of  performance-\nbased  budgeting  and  efforts  to  ensure  accelerated  budget  execution.  In  addition,  the \ngovernment  has  strengthened  the  budget  review  process  and  has  reduced  the  number  and \nmagnitude of special purpose funds. The recent adoption of a treasury single account will also \nincrease budget credibility by centralizing the collection of government revenues. Transparency \nhas been strengthened through the adoption of the transparency seal. This program requires all \ngovernment agencies to disclose key information, including open-source data sets, through their \nrespective  websites.  To  improve  scrutiny  and  audit,  Congress  now  reviews  and  approves  the \nannual budget and the standards governing public audit have been strengthened.17 \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  DOF.  GGACC  is  implementing  a  comprehensive  and  results-\nbased  anticorruption  action  plan,  drawing  on  a  review  of  the  National  Anti-Corruption  Plan  of \nAction.  Various  initiatives  by  various  development  partners  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the \nOffice of the Ombudsman and the justice sector have achieved positive results. The Philippines \nrose  to  95th  place  out  of  175  countries  in  Transparency  International\u2019s  2015  Corruption \nPerception Index, from 134th place out of 178 countries in 2010 when the program commenced. \n \nC. \n \n34. \nThe  potential  beneficiaries  of  the  program  will  include  local  constituents,  the  private \nsector,  civil  society  organizations,  and  the  poor.  The  program  will  introduce  participatory  and \naccountable planning, budgeting, and monitoring systems that allow improved matching of local \nbudgets and local development priorities and preferences. The reforms implemented under the \nprogram will also have a direct impact on poverty reduction by helping prioritize and improve the \ncoordination  of  pro-poor  expenditures.  The  reforms  will  also  improve  service  delivery  through \nthe  ALGUP  and  PCF  and,  indirectly,  through  savings  obtained  from  more  efficient  PFM \npractices.  Finally,  the  program  will  support  the  creation  of  predictable  and  adequate  local \nrevenue  bases  that  assist  private  entrepreneurship  and  business  development,  as  well  as \nemployment  generation.  Subprogram  2  is  classified  as  some  gender  elements  and  includes \nimprovements to the preparation and monitoring of gender and development plans by LGUs, the \n                                                \n16 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Public Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nprioritization  of  gender-sensitive  expenditures  under  the  ALGUP,  and  the  inclusion  of  gender \ndimensions in performance-based monitoring systems. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  2  is \nclassified  category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. \nThe assessment of policy actions concludes that no safeguard policies are triggered. \n \nE. \n \n36. \nThe program is exposed to broad macroeconomic risks, as well as risks associated with \nPFM and corruption. Overall, risks are medium and well-controlled, and the integrated benefits \nand  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Macroeconomic  risks  are  low,  and  ADB  is \nactively  coordinating  with other  development  partners  to  mitigate the remaining  broad risks  by \nsupporting a whole of government approach, which includes this program, to reduce corruption \nand strengthen the entire PFM cycle, including procurement. Contextual or project-specific risks \narise  primarily  out  of  the  need  to  assure  the  continuity  of  reforms  through  the  government \ntransition.  ADB  has  addressed  these  risks  by  building  a  wide  stakeholder  engagement, \nincluding representatives from the Senate and the House of Representatives, and by providing \nexplicit incentives in the reform program for local government officials. ADB will also provide the \nnew administration with a briefing note to describe the rationale and benefits of the program, as \nwell  as the  extent  of  existing  stakeholder  support. The  CCD,  which was established with ADB \nsupport,  also  plays  a  lead  role  in  ensuring  continuing  progress.  Major  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.18  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government and DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \n37. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan document. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n38. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $250,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Local \nGovernment Finance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those  set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n21 November 2016 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned With \nThe program is aligned with the Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016a and will improve governance \nand human development standards through more efficient service delivery. \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nEfficient and \ntransparent local \ngovernment financial \nmanagement \nsystems developed \n\nOutputs \n1.
