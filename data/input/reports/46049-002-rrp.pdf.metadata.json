As  the  first  proposed  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  urban  sector  loan  in  southern  XUAR,  the  project  will  contribute  to \nsustainable economic growth and improve the quality of life for about 509,200 urban residents in \nAkesu, with a specific focus on the rehabilitation and upgrading of existing urban areas with high \nethnic minority populations. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nLocated  in  the  northwest  of  the  PRC,  XUAR  is  a  remote  region  linking  the  PRC  to \n3. \nCentral  Asia.  Despite  recent  economic  development  due  to  the  expansion  of  agriculture  and \nextractive industries, XUAR remains one of the poorest and least-developed regions in the PRC. \nIn  2013,  XUAR\u2019s  average  urban  per  capita  disposable  income  was  the  second  lowest  in  the \nPRC,  at  CNY19,874. 2  XUAR  is  one  of  the  less-developed  western  regions  targeted  for \naccelerated  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction  by  the  preferential  policies \nunder  the  National  Strategy  for  Development  of  the  West.  XUAR  has  a  large  ethnic  minority \npopulation:  the  Uygur  account  for  45.73%  of  the  total  population  and  other  ethnic  minority \ngroups  for  14.77%.  The  regional  capital,  Urumqi,  with  a  population  of  3.1  million,  and  the \npopulated urban centers in the northern part of the region are the main industrial hubs. They are \nalso  the  primary  points  of  public  infrastructure  investment  and  private  sector  activities.  On  the \nother  hand,  investments  in  the  southern  part  of  XUAR,  mainly  constituted  of  mountains  and \ndesert  areas,  lag  behind.  The  development  of  an  arc-shaped  urban  and  transport  corridor \nbetween  the  southern  piedmont  of  Tianshan  Mountain  and  the  northern  rim  of  Taklamakan \nDesert is an opportunity to achieve a more balanced level of development across the region. \n \nFive oases cities exist along highway A314 and the national railway, each with an urban \n4. \npopulation  between  300,000  and  700,000.  Over  time,  agricultural  expansion,  poorly  managed \nurbanization,  and  extractive  industries  have  degraded  the  local  environment,  decreasing  the \nsustainability  of  these  cities.  These  cities  are  the  only  urban  centers  capable  of  clustering \neconomic activities in the southern part of the region.  \n \n5. \nAkesu  is  a  medium-sized  city  in  southern  XUAR  established  as  an  oasis  town  on  the \nhistoric  Silk  Road.  In  2013,  its  poverty  incidence  was  5.45%  for  the  urban  population,  and \n12.3%  for  the  rural  population.  Akesu  has  a  higher  poverty  rate  than  regional  and  national \naverages.  The  city  has  expanded  in  recent  years  following  (i)  economic  growth  in  agricultural \nproduction, (ii) exploration and processing of oil and gas, and (iii) regional and intercity transport \nimprovements. The urban population grew from 422,470 in 2005 to 509,200 in 2013, reaching \nan urbanization rate of 61.2%, while the built-up area expanded from 27 square kilometers (km2) \nto 46.5 km2 over the same period. Although the burgeoning city benefits from a good economic \noutlook,  inadequate  infrastructure  investment  in  existing  areas  and  environmental  degradation \nare contributing to a poorer quality of life. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  2013 statistical bulletins of socioeconomic development in the PRC and XUAR. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n6. \nAkesu\u2019s  long-term  sustainable  development  requires  socially  and  environmentally \nresponsible  management  of  its  urbanization.  It  urgently  needs  to  tackle  its  significant \ndeficiencies  in  urban  infrastructure  and  services;3 as  current  access  to  water,  sanitation,  and \nheating  in  Akesu  is  low  and  variable.  Meanwhile,  poor  land  use  and  waste  management \npractices  threaten  environmental  conditions  in  Akesu\u2019s  rivers  and  wetlands.  While  improved \nservices will reduce the negative impact of urbanization on the environment in Akesu, additional \nmeasures are needed to rehabilitate and preserve the water resources for the city and the larger \nwatershed. The Akesu Duolang wetlands, located within the ecological conservation zone of the \npilot  Xinjiang  Akesu  Duolang  River  National  Wetland  Park,  provide  important  ecosystem \nservices.  These  include  groundwater  replenishment,  flood  retention,  sediment  and  nutrient \nremoval,  micro-climate  regulation,  cultural  services,  and  biodiversity  conservation. 4  The \nrehabilitation  of  these  wetlands  will  enhance  the  National  Wetland  Park  network  in  the  PRC, \nprovide  a  demonstration  of  wise  wetland  use  as  promoted  by  the  Ramsar  Convention,  and \ncontribute to improved water resources management within the Tarim River Basin. 5 \n \nThe proposed project aims to improve municipal services in the project area significantly: \n7. \n(i) the households with connection to piped urban water supply would increase from 52.6%  to \n88.6%, (ii) the households with sewerage connections would increase from 8.0% to 66.6%, (iii) \nthe  area  with  access  to  central  heating  would  increase  from  12.7%  to  87.0%,  and  (iv)  the \nhouseholds  covered  by  solid  waste  management  would  increase  from  18.7%  to  100%.  The \nurban road component is aligned with the Comprehensive Transportation Planning of the Urban \nCenter  Area  of  Akesu  (2013\u20132030)  to  improve  conditions  and  connectivity  of  the  urban  road \nnetwork in Akesu for all users on arterial, secondary, collector, and lane-scale roads.6 The peri-\nurban  communities  targeted  for  improvement  under  the  residential  alley  component  are \ninhabited  mostly  by  ethnic  minorities.  The \nlarge \nenvironmental  impacts,  including  interception  of  some  21,600  cubic  meters  of  currently \nuncollected wastewater, reducing contamination of the Akesu water resources.7  \n \n8. \nStrategic  fit.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (2010\u2013\n2015), and these urbanization policies, priorities, and agendas will continue into the Thirteenth \nFive-Year  Plan.  The  project  supports  environmentally  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic \ngrowth,  which  is  a  key  priority  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  as  well  as  the  Midterm  Review  of \nStrategy  2020. 8  It  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for \ninclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth. 9  It  also  conforms  to  (i)  ADB\u2019s  Water \nOperational Plan, as the project encourages water and wastewater management, and wetland \nand biodiversity protection; (ii) ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, which fosters competitive, green, \nand  inclusive  cities  by  promoting  connectivity,  road  safety,  waste  management,  and  urban \nsanitation;  and (iii)  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational  Plan  by  supporting  road \n\nimprovement  of  services  will  have \n\n                                                \n3  The direct project areas cover 31 km2 in central Akesu. \n4  The wetlands provide a critical link for migratory birds in the Central Asian flyway. \n5  Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (1971). Ramsar, Iran. http://www.ramsar.org/ \n6  While  there  are  no  current  plans  to  create  new  mass  transit  networks  in  Akesu,  the  urban  road  component \n\nsupports existing bus networks and maintains adequate space for future development of rapid transit. \n\n7  This will result in an estimated reduction of 9,280 tons per year of chemical oxygen demand, 39 tons per year of \n\ntotal phosphorus, and 32 tons per year of total nitrogen. \n\n8  ADB.  2008.

That  plan  aims  to  (i)  improve  the \nurban  services  of  small  towns  and  (ii)  establish  harmonious  and  pleasant  living  conditions  in \ncities  with  improved  infrastructure,  public  services,  and  environment.11 Finally,  the  project  will \nalso support the PRC's National Wetland Conservation Program (2004\u20132030).12  \n \n9. \nThis  is  the  fifth  project  of  the  strategic  urban  sector  partnership  between  XUAR  and \nADB.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  can  be  seen  in  the  optimization  of  project  design,  reduction  of \nresettlement impacts and costs, as well as the incorporation of lessons and special features. \n \n10. \nIncorporation of lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from previous ADB-\nfinanced  urban  development  projects,  emphasizing  holistic  urban  development  approaches  to \nsupport  the  development  of  livable  cities  with  universal  access. 13  The  project  focuses  on \nimproving access to urban water supply, sewerage, and heating services in existing urban areas \nrather  than  the  establishment  of  new  districts.  The  project  has  been  informed  by  the  lessons \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  water  and  wastewater  tariff  studies,  which  developed  the  National  Guidelines  on \nWater Tariffs.14 Akesu, being in an ethnic minority and poverty area, is currently exempted from \nthe  1998  National  Regulation  for  Urban  Water  Tariff  Management.  The  project  will,  however, \npromote cost-recovery and progressive tariffs in line with national standards through institutional \nstrengthening  and  capacity  building.15 The  project  will  follow  the  reduce,  reuse,  recycle  (3R) \nprinciples adopted in previous ADB projects in XUAR.16 \n \n11. \nSpecial  features.  In  line  with  the  integrated  nature  of  the  project,  several  special \nfeatures have been developed and are supported by capacity building. First, two \u201cliving street\u201d \npilots  will  be  designed  in  low-income,  ethnic  minority  communities  of  Akesu,  aiming  to  create \nsocial and shared spaces where people can meet and children can play safely by reducing the \nspeed and dominance of motorized transport in these areas. The pilot locations will be selected \nin  a  participatory  process  with  affected  communities.  Second,  the  road  component  will  be \nsupported  by  urban  traffic  planning  with  an  emphasis  on  nonmotorized  traffic,  including  the \npreparation  of  a  human-centered  urban  transport  master  plan  for  the  city  of  Akesu,  and  the \ndesign and implementation of a public education program on traffic safety. Third, the project will \ncontribute  to  the  development  of  a  citywide  solid  waste  management  road  map,  with  defined \nshort-, medium-,  and  long-term targets,  including  support  to the  development  of  a  3R-oriented \nintegrated  solid  waste  management  plan.  Finally,  the  wetland  rehabilitation  component  will \n\n                                                \n10 ADB.  2012.  Water  Operational  Plan  (2011\u20132020).  Manila;  ADB.  2013.

The technical designs are suitable for local circumstances, \ntopography,  and  climate  (arid  desert  conditions  with  long,  harsh  winters),  consistent  with \nstrategic  and  sector  priorities,  and  PRC  design  guidelines  and  local  regulations.  The  demand \nprojections  for  the  urban  infrastructure  services  were  assessed  to  be  appropriate.  Design \noptions were compared and appropriate technologies and alternatives with the least costs and \n\n                                                \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\frehabilitation  component \n\nleast  environmental  and  social  impacts  were  selected.  The  design  of  the  Akesu  Duolang \nwetland \nincorporates  state-of-the-art  scientific  principles  and \ninternational and national good practices, and takes into account local climatic and hydrological \nconditions. A detailed final design will be undertaken by a class A design institute, and start-up \nconsultants  will  provide  procurement  support  during  the  advance  action  period.  The  capacity-\nbuilding  component  was formulated  on  the  basis  of  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  local \nneeds for successfully implementing and operating project facilities, and incorporates innovative \nfeatures with respect to environment-friendly and socially inclusive urban infrastructure planning, \nawareness  building  for  road  safety,  public  education  and  demonstration  for  road-sharing  and \nwaste 3Rs, and public education for wetland and biodiversity protection. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nEconomic  analysis.  An  economic  analysis,  with  a  cost\u2013benefit  analysis,  sensitivity \nanalysis,  and  distributional  analysis,  was  conducted  for  all  physical  components.20 The  least-\ncost analysis confirms the selection of technologies and alternatives for individual components. \nThe  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  considered  direct  impacts  on  beneficiaries.  The  analysis  confirmed \nthat  the  project  outputs  and  the  overall  project  are  economically  viable,  with  an  economic \ninternal rate of return for the overall project of 23.6%, which exceeds the economic opportunity \ncost  of  capital  of  12%.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  urban  development \ncomponent is 26.0%, and for the Akesu Duolang wetland component it is 13.3%. The sensitivity \nanalysis shows that the project remains economically  viable in the event of a 10% increase in \ncost and 10% decrease in benefit. \n \nFinancial  analysis. The financial analysis includes (i) the project\u2019s fiscal impact on the \n23. \nfinances  of  the  AMG  as  the  ultimate  borrower  of  the  loan,  and  (ii)  the  financial  viability  of  the \ncost-recovery  element  of  the central  heating component. 21 The fiscal  impact  was assessed  by \ncomparing  the  annual  revenues  from  the  AMG\u2019s  identified  financing  sources  with  the  annual \ncounterpart  funds  required  for  (i)  capital  expenditures  during  project  implementation  and  (ii) \nrecurrent costs for operation and maintenance and debt service during operations. The analysis \nindicates  that  the  AMG  is  able  to  finance  counterpart  funds,  service  debts,  and  recurrent \noperation  and  maintenance  costs.  The  fiscal  risk  assumed  by  the  AMG  in  financing  the \ncomponent  parts  is  assessed  to  be  acceptable.  The  financial  viability  analysis  for  the  central \nheating component shows that the financial internal rate of return, estimated at 8.03%, is higher \nthan the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 1.78%. The financial analysis and related \nsensitivity analysis find the project components financially viable. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  its  Accountability \nMechanism Policy22 were explained to and discussed with the XUAR government and the AMG. \nThe procurement capacity assessment of the AMG concluded that the procedural arrangements \nare  adequate  to  ensure  full  compliance  with  ADB  procurement  guidelines  considering  the \nsupport  that  will  be  provided  by  the  Akesu  Public  Resources  Trading  Center,  the  international \ntendering  company,  and  the  loan  implementation  consultant.23 The  financial  management  risk \nhas been assessed as moderate.The project financial management arrangements are adequate. \nThe specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n                                                \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB. 2012.

The project will directly benefit 263,830 people, \nof  which 122,420 or  46.4%  are ethnic minorities,  and  44,320  people  or 16.8%  are  poor. It  will \ngenerate  12,130  person-years  of   direct  employment  during the  construction  phase  and  2,761 \nperson-years of direct employment during the operational phase.24 The XUAR government and \nthe AMG have committed to prioritizing the employment of vulnerable groups, including women, \nthe poor, and ethnic minorities. Project implementation units will ensure that all PRC labor laws \nand core  labor  standards  are respected.  Details  on  specific measures  will  ensure  that  poverty \nand  social  benefits  are  in  the  social  and  gender  action  plan  in  the  PAM  and  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  plan.  Social  and  gender  indicators  will  be  included  in  the  project  performance \nmanagement  system,  and  appropriate  consultant  inputs  for  implementation  and  monitoring  of \nboth plans are included in the supervision consultant package.25 \n \n26. \nGender  benefits.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  will \nhave  significant  benefits  for  women  by  reducing  the  energy,  time,  and  effort  spent  on  their \nroutine household activities as well as allowing them greater participation in income-generating \nactivities. Women  strongly  support  the  project  across  all  components,  and  perceive  that  it  will \nimprove their quality of life and create employment and income for them. A gender action plan \nwas prepared, including specific targets for women\u2019s employment and participation. 26 The plan \nwill  help  ensure  (i)  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  project,  including  a  target  for  at  least  45% \nemployment  for  women  (including  ethnic  minorities);  (ii)  participation  and  gender-sensitive \npublic training on public road safety, solid waste management, and wetland protection, with up \nto 50% female participation (and staff training participation up to 30% female); (iii) participation \nin  capacity-building  activities;  and  (iv)  appropriate  gender  targets,  indicators,  and  sex-\ndisaggregated data for project monitoring and evaluation. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  AMG  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination \nthat  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  and  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite on 25 February 2015.27 The anticipated impacts will be localized, short-term, reversible, \nthe \nand  effectively  mitigated  by  applying  good  construction  practices  as  defined \nenvironmental  management  plan.  During  construction,  dust,  noise,  and  temporary  traffic \ndisturbance generated by road rehabilitation activities will be a nuisance to nearby residents. All \nroads will be developed with safe and adequately wide footpaths, fully segregated nonmotorized \nlanes,  and  public  transport  facilities.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  Duolang  wetlands  will  require \nsignificant construction activities with temporary impact on existing wetland functions. However, \nthe  project  is  expected  to greatly  boost  these functions  by  significantly  increasing the  value  of \nthe  wetland\u2019s  ecosystem  services.28 The  project  will  also  have  substantial  pollution-abatement \nbenefits. 29 The  climate  risk  to  the  project  is  medium. 30 Akesu  River  runoff  will  significantly \n                                                \n24 These targets are disaggregated by component in the design and monitoring Framework (Appendix 1). \n25 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 The two-page gender action plan was prepared based on the combined social and gender action plan included in \n\nin \n\nthe PAM and assurances. Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n27 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 The wetland biotope will provide regulating services (e.g., water storage, supply and treatment,  and micro-climate \nregulation), supporting services (biodiversity maintenance by providing resting, feeding, and breeding habitats for \nwildlife such as migratory water birds), and cultural services (including tourism, research, and recreation). \n\n29 29.3  million  liters  of  fuel  can  be  saved  per  year  from  improved  road  conditions  and  connectivity,  resulting  in  the \nreduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 215,000 tons per year. The use of waste heat from a combined heat and \npower plant will result in the closure of 28 small, low-efficiency boilers, which will reduce coal use by 25,900 tons \n\n \n\n\fincrease due to increased  snow  and glacier melt  in the  Tianshan Mountains.  All  project roads \nwill include high-capacity culverts and separate storm- and wastewater-collection systems. The \nrehabilitation  and  protection  of  the  Duolang  wetlands  is  an  important  measure  to  enhance \nclimate resilience by increasing number and diversity of habitats on the Central Asian flyway. \n \n28. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  A  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  following \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on  27  February  2015.31 \nBased on the resettlement impact survey, the urban road component and the wetland output will \nhave land acquisition and resettlement impacts. A total of 184 households and 790 persons will \nbe affected by the project. In total, 1,502.93 mu (100.2 ha) of land will be permanently acquired; \nincluding 825.13 mu (55 ha) state-owned land and 677.8 mu (45.19 ha) of collective-owned land, \nwhich  will  affect  176  households  with  740  persons.32 Of  the  collectively  owned  land  acquired, \n66.5% (450.6 mu or 30 ha) is cultivated land. Along with land acquisition, 5,655 square meters \nof residential structures will be demolished, affecting 21 households with 120 persons. About 13 \nhouseholds  and  70  persons  will  be  affected  by  both  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The \nresettlement  plan  was  disclosed  to  affected  persons,  and  resettlement  information  booklets \nwere  distributed  in  January  2015.  Appropriate  livelihood-restoration  measures  associated  with \nresettlement  are  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  plan.  The  project  will  also  establish  a \ntransparent grievance redress mechanism that will provide meaningful consultation and ensure \nthat  remedial  action  is  taken  as  necessary  during  project  implementation.  An  external \nresettlement monitor or a firm will be engaged to conduct semiannual monitoring and evaluation \nof resettlement implementation and submit reports to the AMG and ADB. The AMG\u2019s capacity \nfor  resettlement  will  be  strengthened.  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  Government  has \nassured  ADB  that  adequate  funds  for  resettlement  will  be  made  available  on  a  timely  basis \nduring project implementation.  \n \n29. \nIndigenous peoples (category B). Ethnic minorities constitute 46.4% of the population \nin the direct project area and 53.6% in the indirect area in Akesu. Although urban communities \nare  ethnically  mixed,  some  aspects  such  as  cultural,  religious,  and  linguistic  differences  are \nmaintained.  All  households  in  the  urban  areas  will  benefit  from  the  new  and  upgraded \ninfrastructure  services  and  rehabilitated  wetlands.  Ethnic  minorities  will  not  be  adversely \naffected, except for 172 Uygur minority households (land acquisition) and 18 other households \n(residential  house  demolition).  An  ethnic  minority  development  plan  has  been  prepared  and \nendorsed  by  the  AMG.33 The  plan  focuses  on  measures  to  facilitate  the  inclusion  of  ethnic \nminorities  in  all  project  activities,  and  ensure  that  their  customs  and  beliefs  will  be  respected \nthroughout project implementation. The ethnic minority development plan was disclosed  on 23 \nJanuary 2015 to ethnic minorities in the areas targeted by the project. Monitoring and reporting \narrangements are included in the PAM and in the project agreement. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30.
