I submit for your approval the report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, (ii) a \nproposed  grant,  and  (iii)  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the  Urban \nEnvironmental Infrastructure Fund (UEIF)1 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility to the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) East\u2013\nWest Economic Corridor Towns Development Project. This is one of three projects for GMS \ncorridor towns; the others will be in Cambodia and Viet Nam.2 \n \n2.  This project is a first generation intervention of a long-term engagement in towns of the \nGMS economic corridors, and is aligned with the strategic framework of the GMS Economic \nCooperation Program, 2012\u20132022, approved by the Fourth GMS Summit on 19 to 20 December \n2011.3 It is also in line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy \n2012\u20132016 for the Lao PDR4 and supports ADB\u2019s urban operational plan (2012\u20132020) and water \noperational plan (2011\u20132020).5 \n \n3.  The project will enhance the competitiveness of towns along the East\u2013West Economic \nCorridor (EWEC), and will complement years of work on trade facilitation and cross-border trade \nagreements.6 The project will transform the corridor towns of Kaysone Phomvihane, Phine, and \nDansavanh  into  economic  hubs  by  improving  urban  environmental  infrastructure  and \nstrengthening the institutional capacity of provincial and local authorities. The productivity and \nsustainability of economic enterprises in these towns will be significantly improved, as the flood \ncontrol measures will increase climate resilience. The environment will be improved through \nclean wastewater, disposal of solid waste, and enhanced mobility on improved urban roads. The \nproject will provide environmental infrastructure that will, among others, help reduce the carbon \nfootprint of the towns, making them cleaner and greener, and thus more livable. The project will \nfinance seven subprojects in the three towns.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n4.  Strategic  economic  development.  The  government  and  ADB  place  considerable \nemphasis on developing priority transport corridors to increase physical connectivity between \nthe GMS countries and to establish the foundation for more efficient movement of people, \ngoods, and services. Towns along the EWEC, which links the Lao PDR and Viet Nam with \nThailand and Myanmar, are well positioned to serve as dynamic centers of investment and \neconomic  growth.  The  strategic  location  of  the  corridor  towns  provides  the  stimulus  for \nincreased  trade  and  investments  along  the  transport  routes.  Access  to  infrastructure  and \nmarkets will provide many stimuli for the local economy and the hinterland of the corridor towns. \nGiven these development opportunities, and with the rapid growth of the urban population and \nexpansion  of  urban  areas,  several  corridor  towns  are  now  facing  demands  for  urban \ninfrastructure and essential support services. \n \n \n                                                \n1  Contributor: the Government of Sweden. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

The participating corridor towns in the Lao PDR now face the pressing \ntask  of  coping  with  the  demands  of  rapidly  growing  and  expanding  urban  areas.  Local \nauthorities want to plan and manage urban growth using an integrated approach, operate and \nmaintain urban environmental and economic infrastructure, and efficiently deliver municipal \nservices. Despite policy reforms to promote decentralization, local institutional capacity has not \nkept pace with urban sector development and economic growth. With increasing trade and \ntraffic flows, the capacity of the corridor towns to manage local economic development in an \nenvironmentally sustainable manner urgently needs to be strengthened.7 \n \n6.  Project towns. Three corridor towns along the EWEC were selected as project areas on \nthe basis of their economic potential, infrastructure constraints, and expressed commitments. \n \n7.  Kaysone Phomvihane is a border town that serves as a (i) major commercial and service \ncenter; (ii) agricultural processing center; and (iii) emerging prime destination for manufacturing \nindustries, business, and tourism. Its strategic location across the Mekong River Bridge into \nThailand offers considerable opportunities for increased economic activities and investments. \nWith increasing cross-border trading and commercial exchanges, the town is emerging as a \ndynamic economic center for public and private sector investments. \n \n8.  Phine is a market town located at an important road junction along the EWEC with a \nbypass road connecting to neighboring towns and provinces. Increasingly the town center is \ninvolved in trade and commercial activities for goods and services produced in Savannakhet \nprovince, and from Thailand and Viet Nam. The increasing local economic activities brought \nabout by the improved National Road 9 are stimulating the establishment of businesses. \n \n9.  Dansavanh, a town bordering Viet Nam, is emerging as an important trading center in \nthe Sepone district. Its primary business is mining. Its strategic location along the EWEC made \nit a prime location for the newly established special economic zone. Local economic activities \nare fostered by the presence of a dry port logistics facility, a public market, transport terminal, \nand duty free shopping at the border gate. \n \n10.  Related policies and strategies. The government has taken several initiatives to set up \nthe policy framework for urban development where district authorities would eventually take the \nmain role in planning and implementation. The 2010 National Socio-Economic Development \nPlan (NSEDP) provides broad economic and social targets, and specific proposals for urban \nsector development. Essential measures for economic development and poverty reduction will \nbe pursued to reduce gaps between urban and rural areas and to make urban areas the focal \npoints for increased trade and investment. The strategic focus of infrastructure development will \nbe EWEC connectivity; provision of urban infrastructure; and construction of main roads in \ndistricts, and access roads that link rural production areas to urban markets. The government \nstrategy is reflected in ADB\u2019s urban development sector assessment, strategy, and road map.8 \n \n11.  Lessons. Major lessons from completed or ongoing ADB-financed projects in urban \ndevelopment include (i) civic participation positively affects urban governance; (ii) participatory \nand demand-driven development activities enhance the sense of local ownership; (iii) capacity \nbuilding  requires  proper  planning  and  up-front  implementation  as  it  is  a  long-term  effort;  \n(iv) institutional and policy reform should be based on realistic assessment of timing, resource \nrequirements, and political will; and (v) weak performance in project financial cost recovery \n                                                \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water Supply and Other Municipal Infrastructure and Services (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  ADB. 2011.

Manila (work-in-progress draft). \n ", "3 \nthreatens sustainability, although project social and economic benefits are exceptionally high.9 \nThese lessons are closely linked to recommendations of ADB\u2019s country assistance program \nevaluation  (2010),  which  stressed  the  need  for  environmental  and  social  safeguards  and \ncapacity development.10 Project preparation involved high degree of social participation. The \nproject  has  a  strong  capacity  development  component,  and  a  business  plan  approach  to \nrevenue collection and operation and maintenance (O&M). Further, it is conscious of the time \nand resources needed for institutional reform.11 \n \n12.  Special  features.  The  project  has  three  special  features:  (i)  as  a  first-generation \nintervention, it supports regional development in the GMS (and the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations) by creating growth engines in corridor towns across the GMS, preparing for \nfuture fully  integrated  subregional  projects;  (ii)  it  provides  recycling  of  solid  waste  through \ninnovative materials recovery facilities (MRFs) for waste segregation, with cofinancing from the \nUEIF  under  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership  Facility;  and  (iii)  it  supports  increased \ndecentralization by strengthening provincial and district authorities.12 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The expected impact of the project is for the towns of Kaysone Phomvihane, Phine, and \nDansavanh to become centers of trade and investment in the EWEC, thereby contributing to the \ntransformation of transport corridors to economic corridors in the GMS. The expected outcome \nis adequate essential urban infrastructure and services in the project towns. The wastewater \ntreatment,  the  drainage  and  sewerage  systems,  and  the  river  embankment  protection \nsubprojects will contribute to increased climate resilience of the participating towns. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The key outputs of the project are (i) adoption and implementation of strategic local \neconomic development plans, developed during ADB\u2019s project preparatory technical assistance \nfor  the Greater  Mekong  Subregion for  Preparing  the  Corridor Towns Development  Project \n(footnote 6), in the project towns; (ii) implementation of priority urban infrastructure investments; \nand (iii) strengthened institutional capacity for urban development. Identification of the priority \nsubprojects for infrastructure investments was based on (i) consistency with the project\u2019s overall \ngoals  and  objectives;  (ii)  potential  impact  on  contributing  to  economic  growth  and \ncompetitiveness; and (iii) expressed interest and commitment of the Ministry of Public Works \nand Transport (MPWT), as the executing agency, to provide the necessary resources.  \n \n15.

Project management support and capacity development. The project will provide \nproject management support and capacity development to MPWT and the department of public \nworks and transport (DPWT). This will help to ensure that project implementation will fully \ncomply with ADB\u2019s policies and operational requirements in terms of procurement procedures, \nconstruction supervision, financial management and disbursement, social and environmental \nsafeguards, and O&M. Consulting services will be engaged for capacity building in these areas, \nand assisting in developing business plans for the O&M of urban services supported under the \nproject.  Financial  audit and  monitoring  of  the social  and  environmental  safeguards  will  be \nseparate services. MPWT will establish close links with the executing agencies of the other \nGMS corridor towns development projects in Cambodia and Viet Nam (being processed for \napproval in December 2012) by sharing best practices in project implementation and monitoring \nof results.13 \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  The project involves the construction of new urban infrastructure, such as wastewater \ntreatment  plants;  and  the  improvement  of  existing  urban  roads,  drainage  networks  and \nsewerage pipelines, solid waste management, an MRF, and embankment protection structures. \nThe technology for undertaking the civil works is within the capacity of the provincial offices and \ndistrict authorities. The technical and engineering designs, including the O&M plan, are based \non standard parameters to ensure long-term sustainability of infrastructure. \n \n24.  The  national  government,  through  the  7th  NSEDP,  envisions  strengthening  and \nexpanding local governance to promote local economic development and reduce poverty in the \ncountryside.  The  NSEDP  contains  essential  provisions  for  improved  public  administration, \n ", "7 \nenhanced  regional  integration,  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources,  and  infrastructure \nprovision. The urban sector strategies are intended to reduce gaps between urban and rural \nareas and establish urban areas as the focal points for economic development. The NSEDP \nrecognizes  the  weak  institutional  capacity  of  provincial  and  district  authorities  to  plan  and \nmanage urban sector development, implement and operate urban infrastructure, and deliver \nessential urban services. The project will provide the enabling environment for strategic local \neconomic development, infrastructure investments, and institutional capacity building. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The seven subprojects were subjected to economic analysis to determine their viability. \nIn  undertaking  the  analysis,  the  quantification  and  valuation  of  economic  benefits  varied \ndepending  on  the  nature  of  the  subproject.  Benefits  that  were  quantified  included  vehicle \noperating costs and travel time for the urban road subprojects, increase in land value for the \ndrainage and embankment protection subprojects, economic efficiency of recovering recyclable \nand compostable solid waste and reduction in solid waste disposal cost for the MRF, and health \nbenefits and willingness to pay for wastewater treatment and solid waste management. The \nexpected beneficiaries of the overall project constitute a diverse group, including road users, \nbusinesses, tourism service providers, property owners, and households. The base case results \nindicate all components are economically viable with an estimated economic internal rate of \nreturn exceeding the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. Results range from \n12.3% to 31.8%. All subprojects are generally also viable under adverse scenarios in which \ncosts are higher or benefits lower by 10% than the base case.16 \n \n26.  The financial analysis of the three towns with urban road subprojects, the provincial \nauthority has to provide funds to the provincial DPWT through annual budgetary allocations, to \ncover the required O&M costs and ensure project sustainability. The financial analysis focused \non historical annual budget allocations to the provincial DPWT, the incremental O&M of the \nthree road subprojects was not significant compared with previous budgets. The wastewater \ntreatment,  solid  waste  management,  MRF,  and  Mekong  River  embankment  protection  are \nconsidered revenue-generating, thus financial internal rates of return consider the amount of \nfees or income that can be generated from their operation. Resulting financial internal rates of \nreturn ranged from 4.3% to 21.2%, all higher than the computed weighted average cost of \ncapital.17 \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  An assessment of the financial management and fund disbursement system indicates \nthat MPWT has adhered to the transparency and accountability elements of good governance. \nThrough direct participation and involvement in undertaking procurement procedures for an \nADB-financed project, MPWT has developed the institutional capacity to undertake international \nand national competitive bidding for civil works. Capacity development and training assistance \nwill be provided to MPWT and DPWT on financial and procurement management and fund \ndisbursement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  MPWT  and  DPWT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  12).  The  assessment  of \nprocurement capacity indicates that MPWT\u2019s capacity is adequate; however, DPWT requires \ntechnical assistance. \n \n                                                \n16 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Urban  poverty.  Based  on  the  household  survey  and  the  urban  poverty  line  of \nKN240,000 ($30) per person per month, the proportion of poor in the participating towns is 23% \nin Kaysone Phomvihane, 31% in Dansavanh, and 37% in Phine. The poor are mostly living in \nareas  with  inadequate  running  water  supply,  wastewater  and  solid  waste  collection  and \ntreatment  services,  and  roads  and  drainage.  They  often  suffer  from  serious  water  supply \nshortages, poor water quality, wastewater pollution, and poor urban environmental sanitation. \nThey have less capacity to cope with pollution and degraded environments and, in turn, suffer \nfrom increased exposure and risks to surface and groundwater and air pollution, which add to \ntheir poverty situation. Through implementation of the subprojects, the project will improve the \nliving environment and health status of urban residents, especially of the poor, and create \nemployment opportunities.19 \n \n29.  Gender analysis. Based on the survey, households headed by women account for \n11%\u201333%  of  beneficiary  households.  The  subprojects  will  provide  benefits  to  women  as \nindividuals and as part of households. Improved drainage and wastewater treatment, and flood \ncontrol  will  reduce flooding,  as  well  as  the  associated  physical  damage,  and  exposure to \nwaterborne illnesses from overflow of drains, which often carry runoff and wastewater. Women \ncan benefit by eliminating the need for post-flood cleanup, which can be heavy work that takes \nthem away from other productive activities, and reducing exposure to waterborne illnesses, \nwhich decreases the need to care for sick household members and minimizes women\u2019s own \nexposure. The project will mitigate any negative impacts. The gender action plan includes \nmeasures  and  activities  that  will  enhance  the  benefits  to  women  through  participatory \ncommunity  development,  employment  during  construction,  improvements  in  sanitation  and \nhygiene, and awareness-raising programs. The design and monitoring framework and the PAM \ninclude gender-specific targets.20 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Environment. The project is under environment category B, as the subprojects are not \nexpected to cause irreversible adverse environment impacts. Initial environmental examinations \n(IEEs)21 conducted  for  all  the  project  cities  (i)  identified  potential  impacts  and  mitigating \nmeasures to be implemented through environment management plans (EMPs), and (ii) included \ninputs from public consultations. Most impacts are site-specific and mitigating measures are \nreadily available. Potential impacts can be mitigated with good construction practices outlined in \nthe EMPs.22 The IEEs are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \nthe applicable environment regulations of the government. At the detailed design stage, when \nthe EMPs are updated, the final receiving environments for the wastewater treatment plants and \nlandfill will be reviewed to ensure that local groundwater and human uses of the affected areas \nare not adversely affected. Estimated costs for implementing the EMP are integrated in the \nproject costs. The EMP will be finalized during the detailed design. The updated EMP, cleared \nby  ADB,  will  form  part  of  the  contract  bidding  documents.  The  adequate  incorporation  of \nenvironmental considerations during design, and allocation of sufficient budget for O&M will \n                                                \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  Initial Environmental Examination: Kaysone Phomvihane, Phine, and Dansavanh Subprojects (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22  Initial Environmental Examination: Environmental Management Plan for Kaysone Phomvihane Subproject; Initial \nEnvironmental Examination: Environmental Management Plan for Phine Subproject; and Initial Environmental \nExamination: Environmental Management Plan for Dansavanh Subproject (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nmitigate potential adverse impacts during operation. Effective environment monitoring at all \nstages of the subproject implementation will be ensured. In compliance with ADB\u2019s information \ndisclosure and consultation requirements, the safeguard documents will be posted on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n \n31.  Land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  under  safeguard \ncategory  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the  three \nsubprojects, which will trigger the application of the involuntary resettlement requirements of \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement.23 Three due diligence studies were conducted and reports  \nprepared for  subprojects  without  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts: (i)  solid  waste \nmanagement in Kaysone Phomvihane, (ii) the MRF in Dansavanh, and (iii) the MRF in Phine. A \ntotal of 7.8 hectares will be acquired and 508 households (2,559 people) will be affected by the \nsubprojects. The Kaysone Phomvihane subprojects will affect 290 households (1,445 people), \nthe  Dansavanh  subproject  109  households  (506  people),  and  the  Phine  subproject  \n109 households (608 people). However, only 2 affected households in Dansavanh require \nrelocation. All other impacts are partial and temporary. The cost is estimated to be $1.72 million, \nincluding  base  costs,  allowances,  and  contingencies.  Following  extensive  stakeholder \nconsultation  and  participation,  a  cutoff  date  for  inclusion  of  affected  households  was \nestablished.  Project  information  was  disclosed  to  affected  persons  throughout  project \npreparation and a project information booklet will be updated and distributed during the detailed \nmeasurement survey. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  Indigenous peoples. The Lao PDR population includes 49 ethnic groups; the Lao\u2013Tai \nethnic groups make up the majority of the population. Based on the household survey data, Lao \naccount for 98% of the Kaysone Phomvihane population, Phoutai for 1.5%, and other ethnic \ngroups (Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese migrants) 0.5%. The beneficiary communities, which \ninclude non-Lao ethnic groups, are supportive of the subprojects and see clear and direct \nbenefits for themselves. The social assessment confirms that none of the subprojects will create \nadverse indigenous peoples impacts as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n33.  Resettlement  and  environment  documents  were  prepared  in  consultation  with  local \ncommunities and are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national laws \nand  regulations.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information  disclosure  and  consultation \nrequirements, the resettlement plans will be posted on the ADB website. A grievance redress \nmechanism  will  help  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints  regarding  project  performance.  The \nresettlement plans, IEEs, and EMPs will be updated and disclosed after detailed design, and \ncleared  by  ADB  prior to  contract  awards. The  project  is under  category  C for  indigenous \npeoples, which does not require preparation of an indigenous peoples development plan. A \nPMU will be established with a focal person on the environment and resettlement to coordinate \nand  implement  the  implementation  activities.  MPWT  will  engage  international  and  national \nconsultants on resettlement and environment to provide management support during project \nimplementation. \n \n34.
