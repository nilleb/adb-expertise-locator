THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridor 2 \n(Bukhara\u2013Miskin\u2013Urgench\u2013Khiva) Railway Electrification Project. The report also describes the \nproposed partial administration of a loan to be provided by the Asian Infrastructure Investment \nBank (AIIB) for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridor 2 (Bukhara\u2013Miskin\u2013\nUrgench\u2013Khiva) Railway Electrification Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the AIIB \nloan.  \n \n2.  The project will electrify 465 kilometers (km) of railway line linking the major urban centers \nof Bukhara, Miskin, Urgench, and Khiva in western Uzbekistan. This will enable the operation of \nhigh-speed trains with a velocity of up to 250 km per hour, vastly cutting travel time. The project \nwill create an economic corridor linking the heritage-rich Khorezm region to the rest of Uzbekistan, \nsupport the recovery of the tourism industry from the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19), and empower women to take up roles in the railway and tourism industries. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The role of railways in the development of Uzbekistan and the Khorezm region. \nUzbekistan serves three of six Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) corridors, \nindicating its importance as a regional transit hub. With about 33 million people, it is the most \npopulous country in Central Asia. It is doubly landlocked, requiring the crossing of at least two \ncountries to reach a seaport. Its economic survival therefore hinges on good transport links. Its \n4,735 km rail network carries about 30%\u201340% of its total freight and 3%\u20134% of its total passenger \ntraffic. Since 2004, Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product has grown by an average of 7% per year. \nThis has contributed to strong demand for rail transport. The project mainly targets the western \nregion of Khorezm. Its distance to the country's other urbanized areas is vast. Urgench, the \nregional capital, is more than 940 kilometers away from the national capital of Tashkent. This \nhinders economies of scope and scale, and keeps Khorezm as a lagging area. Khorezm\u2019s gross \ndomestic product per capita is only 56% of the national average, and 28% of Tashkent\u2019s.1  \n \n4.  Potential of Khorezm. Khorezm is rich in agricultural, industrial, and tourism assets. It is \nhome to Khiva, accredited as a world heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, \nand Cultural Organization and popular with domestic and foreign visitors alike. A nationally \ncoordinated effort is underway to develop the tourism industry. The tourism sector in Uzbekistan \ngrew at a rate of 13.4% in 2018, before shrinking due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.2 \nThe government\u2019s Concept for Tourism Development for 2019\u20132025, approved in January 2019, \nhas among its strategic priorities the expansion of transport routes and the improvement of the \nquality of transport services.3  \n \n5.  Remaining challenges and required solutions. The government has continued to \nimprove a combination of road, rail, and air transport, aware of their relative strengths in improving \nconnectivity to and from Khorezm. Road corridors upgraded with the support of the Asian \n \n1  State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics. 2018. Gross Regional Product. Tashkent. \n2  World Travel & Tourism Council. 2019. Annual Research: Key Highlights Uzbekistan. London. \n3  Government of Uzbekistan. 2019. Presidential Decree No. UP-5611 \u201cAbout additional measures for the accelerated \ndevelopment of tourism in the Republic of Uzbekistan. Tashkent. \n   ", "2 \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  are  providing  flexible  services  to  end  users,  including  last-mile \nconnectivity. Air transport, served mainly from Urgench airport, caters to passengers with the \nhighest time sensitivity, although their numbers remain low. Rail transport serves to move heavy \nand bulky goods over long distances, as well as serving time-sensitive passengers at mass. \nAccordingly, the government completed a new, 465 km railway line linking Bukhara, Miskin, \nUrgench, and Khiva in December 2017. However, passenger operations still rely on diesel traction \nand require a journey of 5.2 hours. Similarly, freight travel between Bukhara and Urgench takes \n13 hours. For Khorezm to gain attractiveness as a tourism and business destination, travel times \nneed to be reduced.  \n \n6.  Countering the impact of COVID-19. The project will help Khorezm bounce back \neconomically from the impacts of COVID-19. Railways have proven to be the most reliable mode \nfor freight transport during the pandemic, while truck traffic decreased. Passenger trains remained \na safe means of transport, thanks to the physical distancing and hygiene measures employed by \nthe public railway company, O\u2019zbekiston Temir Yo\u2019llari (UTY). This contrasts with microbuses and \nother forms of public transport where space is too limited to ensure adequate distancing. The \nproject\u2019s construction work is expected to start in 2022, when COVID-19 is likely to have subsided \nand  be  more  manageable.  To  deal  with  COVID-19  risks  during  project  implementation, \ncontractors will have to develop and implement a COVID-19 health and safety management plan \nand an emergency response plan as part of their site-specific environmental management plans. \n \n7.  Envisaged benefits to Khorezm. The project will electrify and modernize the railway line \nbetween Bukhara and Khiva, extending the electrified, high-speed line already in existence \nbetween Tashkent and Bukhara. High-speed trains that run at up to 250km per hour will cut travel \ntime between Bukhara and Khiva to 3 hours, and the entire journey from Tashkent to Khiva will \nbe made possible in 7 hours, well within a day\u2019s journey. These improvements will have several \nbeneficial impacts on agriculture, industry, and tourism. For one, higher-value agricultural produce \ncan be exported faster and farther, and in refrigerated wagons. Second, tourist flows to Khorezm \nwill increase, leading to sustainable revenue and better employment opportunities, especially for \nwomen. Finally, the population of Khorezm will have better access to jobs, markets, and health \ncare and education facilities in the region or other parts of the country.  \n \n8.  Links to the government strategy. Transport infrastructure is recognized as a key \ngrowth driver in the government\u2019s Development Strategy for 2017\u20132021, apt to promote economic \ndevelopment and liberalization, and support the development of the social sectors.4 The strategy \nspecifically mentions the importance of improving transport services, raising passenger safety, \nand reducing harmful emissions. The project will assist the switch from diesel traction to electricity, \nand the shift to a clean and low-carbon mode of transport. It will help Uzbekistan meet its \ncommitment to the Paris Agreement, as communicated in its intended nationally determined \ncontributions, which highlight the need for \"efficient energy resource use for transport.\"5 \n \n9.  Links to regional strategies. The project railway is on CAREC Corridor 2 (Europe\u2013\nMediterranean\u2013East Asia) and CAREC Designated Rail Corridor 202, which serves the vital East\u2013\nWest trade corridor linking the People\u2019s Republic of China via Central Asia, to Europe. The project \nimproves Uzbekistan\u2019s connectivity and trade with neighboring countries, and markets beyond, \nby expanding the frequency and quality of train services. The project railway is expected to carry \n6 million tons of international freight per year by 2030. The project will boost Uzbekistan\u2019s role as \n \n4  Government of Uzbekistan. 2017.

Consistency with the strategy of ADB. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030, particularly its operational priorities of (i) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster  resilience  and  ensuring  environmental  sustainability;  and  (ii)  fostering  regional \ncooperation and integration.10 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2019\u20132023 for Uzbekistan, which calls for the modernization of railway infrastructure, as well as \npromoting increased access to tourism destinations. 11 The project is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2021\u20132023 for Uzbekistan.12 \n \n11.  Supporting ongoing reforms in the railway subsector. UTY is a financially robust \norganization, able to carry all operation and maintenance costs, and most capital works. However, \nto ensure further growth of a low-carbon, sustainable mode of transport, and to enhance the \ncompetitiveness of rail corridors through Uzbekistan, UTY needs to improve the attractiveness of \nits services to clients. ADB is therefore supporting the UTY-led initiative to develop and implement \na long-term development strategy.13 The strategy\u2019s main directions are the improvement of \noperational efficiency, digitization to enhance customer experience, and the revision of UTY\u2019s \ncorporate structure. While infrastructure improvements will continue to require public investments, \nthese new thrusts may lead to opportunities for closer collaboration with and more participation \nof the private sector in railway transport operations. The project contributes by pushing the \nboundaries of technical innovation and reinforcing the capacity of UTY staff. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: sustainable regional trade and economic \nactivity promoted along CAREC Corridor 2 (footnotes 6, 7, and 9). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: railway services for freight and passengers in western Uzbekistan improved.14 \n \n13.  Output  1:  Railway  infrastructure  along  and  adjacent  to  the  Bukhara\u2013Miskin\u2013\nUrgench\u2013Khiva line upgraded. The project will help electrify 465 km of railway track, through (i) \nconstruction of 8 traction substations; (ii) construction of 7 sectioning posts; (iii) supply and \ninstallation  of  catenary  systems;  (iv)  supply  and  installation  of  signaling,  telecoms,  and \nsupervisory control and data acquisition systems; (v) construction of external power supply; (vi) \npurchase of maintenance equipment and machinery; and (vii) procurement of specialized wires. \nIn  addition,  minor  upgrades  will  be  made  to  electrification  infrastructure  on  adjacent  lines \nextending from Bukhara to Tashkent, and from Samarkand to the border with Afghanistan.15 The \n \n6  ADB. 2017.

The technical training program will be developed based on the results of \nthe assessment of STEM programs, TVET curricula, and courses relevant to railway technology \nof major universities, colleges, and TVET institutions.  \n \n14.  Output  2:  Tourism-led  economic  corridor  Bukhara\u2013Miskin\u2013Urgench\u2013Khiva \ndeveloped. The railway corridor will be transformed into a tourism-led, economic corridor through \n(i) support to municipalities along the railway corridor for sound urban development around \nstations which will include access and safety features for the elderly, women, children, and the \nmobility impaired; (ii) support to the same municipalities to develop a sustainable tourism industry; \n(iii)  marketing  of  railways  as  part  of  wider  efforts  of  Uzbekistan  to  attract  tourists;  (iv) \nimplementation of an electronic ticketing system to allow tourists and domestic passengers easier \nmeans of booking tickets, with provision for discounts and priority seats for the elderly, pregnant \nwomen, children, and the mobility impaired; (v) strengthening women\u2019s participation in economic \nactivities related to tourism, including the operation of tourist information centers, employment at \ntourism facilities, and sale of local crafts; and (vi) training of women in hospitality and tourism \nmanagement. \n \n15.  With the project, annual passenger traffic on the Bukhara to Khiva line is expected to \nincrease from 280,000 passengers per year in 2021 to 1,080,000 passengers by 2026. Freight \nwill reach a total of 11.8 million tons per year by 2026. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s support has ensured the adoption of international technical expertise. The technical \nspecifications for the signaling and telecommunication systems were improved with transaction \ntechnical assistance (TA) to meet international standards and to utilize state-of-the-art technology, \nreflecting lessons from past involvements in electrification and high-speed railway infrastructure.16 \nADB introduced measures into the project to ensure the resilience of the upgraded line to \ndisasters triggered by natural hazards and climate change, and to minimize the environmental \nimpact of the external power supply.17 ADB helped to design measures to support the economic \nrecovery and further growth of the Khorezm region (para. 14), with strong gender features \nsupported by the TA (para. 24). The project will have synergies with other ongoing and upcoming \nADB-supported  projects  in  Uzbekistan.  For  example,  the  proposed  Integrated  Urban \nDevelopment Project will further support the city of Khiva (among others) to build inclusive urban \nand tourism infrastructure and services. ADB has taken the lead in coordinating investments in \nthe railway subsector through the CAREC program (para. 9), and the project will supplement the \nwork done by other development partners in modernizing railway operations in Uzbekistan.18 \n \nD.

Based on the \nstraight-line method, the average maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium payable to \nADB is 0.10% per year.  \n \n19.  The government has also requested a loan not exceeding $108,000,000 from AIIB to help \nfinance the project. The AIIB loan is expected to have a 25-year term, including a grace period of \n5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with the LIBOR-based lending facility;21 \na commitment charge of 0.25% per year, a front-end fee of 0.25%; and such other terms and \nconditions to be set forth in the draft AIIB loan and project agreements. ADB will partially \nadminister the AIIB loan for environment and social services, financial management services, \nprocurement services, investigative services and disbursement services in accordance with ADB \npolicies and procedures. \n \n20.  The  summary  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  ADB  and  AIIB  will  jointly  finance  the \nexpenditures  in  relation  to  the  packages  listed  in  Table  3.  The  AIIB  loan  will  be  partially \nadministered by ADB on an untied, joint, and pro-rata basis, with ADB financing 60% of eligible \namounts and AIIB 40% of eligible amounts. The government will relend the proceeds of the ADB \nloan to UTY with applicable interest and a term of 25 years including a grace period of 5 years. \nThe government and UTY will finance local expenditures, which will cover land acquisition and \nresettlement, taxes and duties, and financing charges during implementation. \n \n20 Set as 5-year forward LIBOR, plus a contractual spread of 0.50% per annum. Transition of the reference rate from \nLIBOR to Secured Overnight Financing Rate will be done in line with the approach indicated in the R-paper approved \nby ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 26 July 2021. \n21 Set as 6-month LIBOR plus fixed or variable lending spread as selected by the borrower (link: AIIB Interest Rates). \nThe lending spread will not exceed 1.3%. \n   ", "6 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  162.00  36.35 \nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank (loan)a  108.00  24.23 \nGovernment and O\u2019zbekiston Temir Yo\u2019llari  175.65  39.42 \nTotal  445.65  100.00 \nNote: Does not include the technical assistance (main text, para. 24) to be provided by ADB on a grant basis. \na  Joint cofinancing, partially administered by ADB.

Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $438.95 million and climate adaptation is estimated \nto cost $6.70 million. ADB will finance 36.0% of mitigation costs and 60.0% of adaptation costs. \nDetails are in the climate change assessment (footnote 17). Mitigation costs comprise railway \nelectrification which will promote a shift to lower-carbon transport. Adaptation costs include the \nclimate-resilient wires for the catenary system, and specialized machinery for clearing sand and \nmonitoring track conditions. Annual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are expected at \n81,000 tons. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  UTY will be the executing agency. It has a sound track record in executing projects \nfinanced by ADB and other international financial institutions. UTY\u2019s Project Implementation Unit \nfor Electrification and Renewal of Rolling Stock (PIU-ET) will implement the project. UTY will plan \nthe works to minimize disruption of train services and maintain safe train operations. UTY will \ncoordinate closely with the Joint Stock Company National Electric Networks of Uzbekistan for \nworks relating to the external power supply. All procurement financed under the ADB and AIIB \nloans will follow open competitive bidding procedures pursuant to ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, \nas amended from time to time). The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 \nand described in detail in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \n23.  Among the financiers, ADB will (i) partially administer the AIIB financing portion (para. 19), \n(ii) lead the supervision and monitoring of the project, and (iii) provide the services identified in \nthe corresponding co-lenders\u2019 agreement to be signed between ADB and AIIB, following ADB\u2019s \napplicable policies and procedures.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n24.  TA of $300,000, financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-6), was approved to support UTY in preparing and implementing key gender actions \nassociated with the project.22 The TA will support selected women students of STEM courses at \nuniversities or TVET institutes gaining the skills required for railway operations and management. \nThe modules will also be used to build the capacity of UTY's women staff. In addition, women \nfrom communities in the project area will be offered training related to tourism and hospitality. The \nTA will be administered by ADB. The consultants recruited for the TA will liaise with UTY, \nkhokimyat (local government) representatives, the Ministry of Mahalla and Family Support, \nMinistry of Investments and Foreign Trade, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, and the \nState Committee for Tourism, among other stakeholders. \n   \n \n22 ADB. 2020.

The technical parameters of the project were prepared by UTY \nand government design institutes. The transaction TA consultants reviewed the design and \nrecommended improvements, especially to ensure the safety of high-speed train operations and \noptimize the design and routing of the external power supply system.  \n \n26.  Climate-resilient design. Thorough considerations were made to ensure the resilience \nof the project to climate change. A special kind of cement will be used to manufacture foundations \nfor the catenary system. Specialized cables resistant to corrosion from sand and salt will be used. \nA sand-clearing machine will be brought in to avoid sand accumulation, rail and wheel abrasion, \nsensor or signal losses, drainage issues, and early corrosion of track superstructures. Equipment \nwill also be procured to periodically check track conditions. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n27.  Economic viability. The economic analysis of the project was conducted in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines by comparing the incremental costs of the project with the incremental \nbenefits in with-project and without-project scenarios.23 The main economic benefits of the project \nare savings in travel time and vehicle operating costs for passenger and freight traffic, reductions \nin carbon dioxide emissions, energy cost savings, and net economic development from increased \ntourism.  The  economic  impact  of  COVID-19  is  reflected  in  the  projections.  The  project  is \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 15.1%. The project remains viable \nagainst (i) a 10% reduction in projected benefits, (ii) a 10% increase in costs, (iii) a combined 10% \nreduction of project benefits and 10% increase in costs, (iv) a 1-year delay in completion, and \n(v) the exclusion of tourism-induced benefits. The project will also improve the conditions for more \ntrade with neighboring countries, especially Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.  \n \n28.  Financial viability. The project will generate revenue, and its financial viability was \nassessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines by comparing incremental costs and revenues in \nwith-project and without-project scenarios.24 The project will increase revenues, mainly from \nfreight traffic that currently provides about 88.0% of UTY\u2019s total revenues. It will also reduce \noperations and maintenance costs of locomotives. The financial internal rate of return is 4.9%, \nand exceeds the calculated weighted average cost of capital of 2.9%. The project remains \nfinancially viable against (i) a 10% increase in costs, (ii) a 10% decrease in revenues, (iii) a 10% \nincrease in costs and 10% decrease in revenues, and (iv) a 1-year delay in completion. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n29.  Financial  and  institutional  sustainability  of  the  railway  operator.  UTY  remains \nprofitable thanks to its robust freight revenues. However, the operating income ratio decreased \nfrom 0.33 in 2017 to 0.14 in 2019, mainly because of the poor financial performance of its non-\ncore businesses, especially coal production. The government decreed that coal production be \ntaken out of UTY\u2019s business portfolio, and is also removing other non-core operations. With these \nmeasures, the operating income ratio is expected to increase to 0.18 by 2030. The long-term \ndebt\u2013equity ratio is forecast to fall from 3.7 in 2020 to 1.2 by 2030, while the debt service coverage \n \n23 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n24 ADB. 2019. Financial Analysis and Evaluation: Technical Guidance Note. Manila. \n   ", "9 \nratio is forecast to increase from 2.0 in 2020 to 3.2 by 2030. Overall, UTY maintains the financial \ncapacity to implement the project, fund its contribution to the project costs, repay the loan, and \nmake the required payments on its existing debt. To ensure the future financial health of UTY, the \nloan includes covenants (i) on the operating income ratio of UTY, which shall be maintained above \n0.1 from 2021 onward; and (ii) for the government to pass an official decree to remove other non-\ncore businesses from UTY and to avoid adding such businesses to UTY in the future.  \n \n30.  Debt sustainability of Uzbekistan. Based on the latest analysis by the International \nMonetary Fund and the World Bank, Uzbekistan\u2019s public and publicly guaranteed external debt \nremains at about 40% of gross domestic product over the medium term. This is far below the debt \nstress threshold of 70%, and the project will not impair debt sustainability. The government has \npursued a prudent debt policy with low public and external debt, and with mechanisms to control \nannual borrowing, while significant official reserves provide a buffer against potential distress.25  \n \nD.  Governance \n \n31.  Financial management. A financial management assessment confirmed that UTY has \nthe capacity to implement the project in compliance with ADB requirements. UTY has a good \nrecord in making disbursements based on ADB requirements. It generally has a record of \nsatisfactory submission of audited financial statements, although some delays were observed.26 \nThe overall pre-mitigated financial management risk is substantial. Risks exist in the management \nof foreign exchange risks, non-core businesses, compliance with international financial reporting \nstandards, timeliness and accuracy of monitoring and reporting, and integration of accounting and \nreporting within UTY. Staff turnover in the PIU-ET was seen in 2021 but has been addressed with \nthe provision of training. UTY shall, among other tasks, (i) carefully monitor its foreign currency \nreserves and develop measures to hedge against currency fluctuations, (ii) remove non-core \nbusinesses, (iii) attend additional training organized by ADB, (iv) move to multiyear contracts for \nauditors and conduct midyear interim audit missions to reduce delays in the preparation of \nfinancial statements, (v) engage external consultants and a valuation company to address the \nqualified audit opinions, and (vi) accelerate the integration of the accounting system. Details of \nrisks and key mitigating measures are in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \n32.  Procurement. A project procurement risk assessment confirmed the procurement risk as \nmoderate. It identified some capacity issues in the PIU-ET, leading to delays in the preparation of \nbidding documents, and the conduct of bidding and bid evaluation. ADB staff and transaction TA \nconsultants provided training to the PIU-ET on ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy and Regulations and \nare assisting it in advance contracting. After the project becomes effective, the engineering and \nworks supervision consultants will assist the contract management. All procurement packages to \nbe financed by ADB will be cofinanced by AIIB. Each package is divided into lots to give small \ncontractors a chance to bid, and for large contractors to bid for all the contracts in each package. \nAt the same time, this reduces the transactional costs of conducting multiple tenders. \n \n33.  Integrity  and  anticorruption.  Uzbekistan  has  made  large  strides  in  improving \ngovernance by strengthening the rule of law and anticorruption measures.27 It set up a new Anti-\nCorruption Agency in 2020 to guide and coordinate anticorruption efforts. ADB conducted integrity \n \n25 World Bank Group. 2021. Joint World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis.

ADB has obtained reasonable \nassurance that UTY was not established, and is not being used, for money laundering or terrorism \nfinancing in the project jurisdiction. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and UTY. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The primary beneficiaries will be local passengers, providers of tourism services, freight \ntransporters, and agro-industrial producers. The project will improve access for the elderly, \nwomen, children, and people with mobility impairments to railway transport, with safety features \nand facilities in trains and at modernized stations.  \n \n35.  Gender segregation undermines the empowerment of women in Uzbekistan. Women \nmake up only 8.5% of workers employed in transportation and storage. The project is classified \neffective gender mainstreaming and will boost women\u2019s participation in the railway and tourism \nindustries. First, women staff of UTY will be empowered through technical training in operation \nand maintenance of high-speed railway lines. Second, women staff working at railway stations \nwill undergo training in tourism promotion, marketing, and public health. Third, employment \nopportunities in railway transport will be boosted for female STEM students, who will be given \nspecialized training on railway operations and technology. Fourth, to increase employment and \nincome generation opportunities for women in communities, the project will support training on \nhospitality, tourism management, and tourism-related enterprises. Finally, the project will develop \nguidelines  on  sound  urban  development  around  stations  that  will  help  enhance  the  travel \nexperience of women, the elderly, children, and people with mobility impairments. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.29 \n \n37.  Environment (category B). The initial environmental examination report was prepared in \ncompliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement.30 It includes two environmental management \nplans (EMPs) for the (i) construction of the catenary system and the traction substations, and the \ninstallation  of  signaling,  telecommunication,  and  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition \nsystems; and (ii) construction of the external power supply. Potential impacts include dust or \nvehicular emissions, noise and waste generation, occupational and community health and safety \nrisks. These can be readily mitigated by implementing the EMPs. As part of the EMPs, contractors \nwill have to prepare and execute a COVID-19 health and safety management plan and an \nemergency response plan to manage COVID-19 risks to workers and local communities. \n \n38.  Since the wider surroundings of the project site feature some key biodiversity areas \n(KBAs),31 a biodiversity assessment and a critical habitat assessment were conducted. According \n \n28 ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila. \n29 ADB.

The project\u2019s \npotential impacts were evaluated, and adequate mitigation measures are proposed in the EMPs \nand in a biodiversity action plan (Attachment 8 of the initial environmental examination). Given \nthese mitigation measures, the critical habitat assessment concluded that no significant or \nirreversible impacts are to be expected. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The eight traction substations to be built will \nimpact 28.09 hectares (ha) of land\u201418.91 ha of agricultural cultivated land and 9.18 ha of reserve \nland owned by the government\u2014and permanently affect 65 farm enterprises and dehkans (family-\nowned farms). Of these, 58 dehkan farm holders (with an estimated 290 household members) \nare considered severely affected. The external power supply will impact 575.63 ha\u201427.12 ha \npermanently and 548.71 ha temporarily\u2014and affect 307 dehkans and 149 farm enterprises, none \nof whom are severely affected. Two draft land acquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs); and \none social due diligence report (SDDR) were prepared based on desk surveys and site visits, and \nhave been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Detailed measurement surveys and census of affected \nland users have not yet been conducted. Public information booklets were distributed to inform \naffected people of the key parameters of the project. UTY staff, along with khokimyat and mahalla \nrepresentatives, provided information to affected people and answered their questions. The \nLARPs and SDDR will be updated based on the detailed design to be prepared by the plant \ncontractor and following the conduct of detailed measurement surveys, census, and follow-up \nconsultations; with support from the engineering and works supervision consultants. UTY\u2019s \ndedicated safeguards specialist will supervise the implementation of the two LARPs. The LARPs \nwill be subjected to both internal and external monitoring. The start of civil works will be conditional \non the full implementation of the LARPs, as verified by an external monitor. Semi-annual social \nmonitoring reports will be prepared throughout the project implementation. Updated LARPs and \nmonitoring reports will be disclosed online and locally to the affected persons. \n \n40.  Grievance Redress Mechanism. A two-level grievance redress mechanism (GRM) is in \nplace, involving (i) the nearest railway station, and (ii) UTY\u2019s secretariat in Tashkent. As a third \nchannel, aggrieved persons can approach any competent court at any stage of the complaint. \nUTY will ensure that grievances and complaints on any aspect of land acquisition, compensation, \nresettlement, and environmental impacts are addressed in a timely and satisfactory manner \nthrough the GRM. UTY, with the support of the engineering and works supervision consultants, \nwill ensure that meaningful consultations are carried out with the affected persons throughout the \nproject cycle with particular attention to the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. \n \n41.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The country in general and the project area in \nparticular do not have communities of indigenous peoples as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement for operational purposes. No further action will be required. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n42.
