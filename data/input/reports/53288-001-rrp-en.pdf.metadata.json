These funds will each invest in a portfolio of growing companies in India \nacross multiple sectors including climate or green infrastructure, affordable housing, infrastructure \nservices, agribusiness, health care and education.2 \n \nNIIF-I is a targeted $1 billion category II alternative investment fund (AIF) registered with the \n3. \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI). 3 National  Investment  and  Infrastructure  Fund \nLimited, established in November 2015, serves as the investment manager and manages NIIF-I.4 \nThe  Government  of  India,  which  is  represented  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance\u2019s \nDepartment of Economic Affairs (DEA), sponsors NIIF and NIIF-I. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n4. \nFrom 2015 to 2017, private equity fund managers based in India raised approximately $6 \nbillion, 50% more than from 2012 to 2014.5 However, India\u2019s share of fund raising across Asia and \nthe Pacific remained essentially flat from 2015 to 2017 compared with 2009\u20132011. This occurred \ndespite the steadily increasing number of active fund managers that reached an all-time high of 491 \nin 2017, the surge of private equity investment volume to more than $26 billion in 2017 and 2018, \nand historically high exit volumes totaling $16 billion in 2017 and $33 billion in 2018.6 Moreover, the \nshare of locally based private equity fund managers participating in domestic equity investments \nwas  much  lower  in  India  at  42%  than  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  at  83%  (footnote  5). \nTherefore, Indian institutional investors can enhance fund-raising efforts of domestic fund managers \nby  increasing  their  investment  allocation  to  the  private  equity  asset  class.  However,  this  type  of \ninstitutional  support  has  historically  been  lacking  in  India  because  domestic  institutions  (e.g., \n\n \n\n1   NIIF-I is a single currency Indian rupee (INR) fund and all USD amounts shown in this document are approximate. \n2  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n3   In India, alternative investment funds (AIFs) are defined in Securities and Exchange Board of India Regulations, 2012 \nas any privately pooled investment fund, (whether from Indian or foreign sources), in the form of a trust or a company \nor a body corporate or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). Category II includes AIFs such as private equity funds \nor debt funds for which no specific incentives or concessions are given by the government or any other regulator. \n4  NIIF was established to manage the NIIF platform, comprising NIIF-I and two other funds also sponsored by the \nGovernment of India (the Master Fund and the Strategic Opportunities Fund). The Master Fund is a targeted $2.1 \nbillion fund (of which about $850 million had been raised as of June 2019) that will focus on investments in companies \nand/or  projects  with  operating  assets  in  core  infrastructure  sectors  such  as  transport,  energy,  and  urban \ninfrastructure. The Strategic Opportunities Fund (target size: $3 billion) is being developed and will have an asset-\nfocused investment strategy and will consider investments into greenfield projects. NIIF is identifying and recruiting \na  dedicated  investment  team  for  the  Strategic  Opportunities  Fund  that  will  finalize  the  investment  strategy  and \ndevelop a pipeline of investment opportunities. The timing for the establishment of the Strategic Opportunities Fund \nis uncertain. To date, NIIF-I is the only fund-of-funds that NIIF manages. \n5  McKinsey & Company. 2019.

India\u2019s economy (in nominal terms) \nhas approximately doubled in size since 2009.7 During this period, private equity has also increased \nfourfold,  the  syndicated  loan  market  and  (non-private  equity)  foreign  direct  investment  have \nremained  mostly  flat,  and  initial  public  offerings  have  been  volatile  (footnote  5).  Given  the \nmomentum of its economy, India has also expanded in private equity deal sizes because larger \ndeals have become increasingly available. For example, deals greater than $100 million have more \nthan doubled in count from 2015 to 2017 compared with 2012\u20132014 (footnote 5). Companies are \nseeking larger investments, and funds able to write large checks are well-positioned to respond. \n \n6. \nTherefore, to support this maturing private equity industry and assist India-domiciled private \nequity funds to raise investment capital efficiently from international and domestic institutions, NIIF \nestablished  NIIF-I\u2014India\u2019s  first  large,  domestic  fund-of-funds  platform\u2014in  March  2018.  The \nGovernment of India requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support NIIF with an investment \nin one of its fund platforms and ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has been engaged \nwith NIIF since January 2017 before settling on the proposed fund-of-funds vehicle. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nNIIF-I\u2019s  mandate  is  to  invest  in  private  equity  funds  dedicated  to  India  and  managed  by \nestablished third-party domestic fund managers with proven track records across multiple market \nand economic cycles. NIIF-I intends to anchor these funds by providing significant commitments of \nbetween  $50  million  and  $150  million  in  each  (generally  between  25%  and  35%  of  a  fund\u2019s \ncommitted capital).8 As an anchor investor, NIIF-I aims to catalyze additional capital from foreign \nand  domestic  institutions  to  help  these  funds  reach  their  target  size,  thereby  enabling  them  to \nexecute their respective investment strategies. \n \n8. \nNIIF-I aims to construct a portfolio of up to 10 funds diversified across strategies (including \nminority growth, control growth, and special situations) and products (equity, mezzanine, and debt). \nIt is expected that targeted funds will consist primarily of single sector dedicated funds focused on \nclimate  or  green  infrastructure,  affordable  housing,  infrastructure  services,  agribusiness,  health \ncare, and education, which are all aligned with ADB\u2019s existing sectoral mandates. NIIF-I will also \nconsider selectively investing in multi-sector funds.9 \n \n9. \nNIIF-I achieved a first close in March 2018, which initiated its 6-year commitment period. \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to \nInformation  Policy,  para.  17.2.(v)].

NIIF will be required to provide ADB with (i) an annual report \nsummarizing financial information received from NIIF-I\u2019s investee funds as required under India\u2019s \nAIF regulations, (ii) annual audited and unaudited financial statements of NIIF-I, (iii) a quarterly \nnewsletter containing updates on the investee funds, and (iv) quarterly valuation reports.19 NIIF \nwill also be required to provide to ADB an annual development effectiveness monitoring report. \nADB will review this information and follow up with NIIF if more information or clarifications are \nneeded. If the information received raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment \nin  NIIF-I,  ADB  could  decide  to  put  NIIF-I  on  a  watch  list  for  more  frequent  reviews  and  closer \nattention.
