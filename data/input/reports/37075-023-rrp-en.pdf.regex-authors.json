THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Qaisar\u2013Dari Bum Road Project. \n \n2.  The proposed grant will finance the construction of a 151-kilometer (km) section of road \nin northwestern Afghanistan from Qaisar to Dari Bum, which is the last missing link of the Ring \nRoad and the top priority among the nation\u2019s strategic corridors. The road section is also part of \nthe key corridors under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program. The \nproject is the latest attempt to complete this road section and will be taking the fragile and conflict-\naffected situation (FCAS) approach to give the contractors more flexibility in security provision \nand arrangement.1 It will also include capacity development programs for the implementing \nagency. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Surrounded by six countries, Afghanistan is in a strategic location along the ancient Silk \nRoute and is the crucial link for Central Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East. It is also a conduit \nto access ports in Pakistan and on the Caspian Sea for trade with Europe and the Middle East. \nHowever, prolonged wars and conflict have devastated Afghanistan\u2019s economy by destroying the \nminimal economic infrastructure and institutions this country once possessed and driving more \nthan 2.5 million Afghans away from their homes and livelihoods. Following the fall of the Taliban \nregime,  Afghanistan  received  billions  of  dollars  for  reconstruction  of  the  country  through \ninternational assistance, which has dramatically boosted its gross domestic product to more than \n$20 billion\u2014five times higher than in 2002. However, the country is still at the beginning of \nrecreating an economy that can ensure stable and sustainable development. \n \n4.  Rehabilitation of the transport infrastructure was one of the key development strategies, \nand the Ring Road, with a total length of 2,210 km, was the government\u2019s top priority because it \nis considered the backbone of Afghanistan\u2019s transport system and the principal conduit for \nnational and international passenger and freight traffic. More than 80% of Afghans live within \n50 km from the road alignment. Reconstruction of the Ring Road started in 2002 and to date, \n1,925 km have been completed under the assistance of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency, World  Bank,  Government  of  Saudi \nArabia, and Asian Development Bank (ADB).  The ongoing construction of the 52-km section from \nArmalik to Leman, financed by the Government of Saudi Arabia, is expected to be completed by \nDecember 2017. Therefore, the 233-km section from Qaisar to Leman is virtually the only missing \nlink of the Ring Road. This link is strategically important, as it passes through one of Afghanistan\u2019s \nmost remote and insecure regions. \n \n5.  With ADB\u2019s support, the government has made multiple attempts since 2005 to complete \nconstruction of this missing link of the Ring Road.  First, in 2005, ADB approved $55 million under \nGrant 0012-AFG: Qaisar\u2013Bala Murghab Road Project to finance the construction of the 90-km \nsection from Qaisar to Bala Murghab,2 and subsequently, in 2007, approved $176 million under \n                                                \n1  M.  Woolcock.  2014.  Engaging  with  fragile  and  conflict-affected  states:  An  alternative  approach  to  theory, \nmeasurement, and practice. https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/engaging-fragile-and-conflict-affected-states. \n2  ADB. Islamic Republic of Afghanistan: Qaisar-Bala Murghab Road Project. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/documents/qaisar-bala-murghab-road-project-rrp. \n ", "2 \nGrant 0081-AFG: Road Network Development Project 1 to finance the 143-km section from Bala \nMurghab to Leman.3 The Ministry of Finance (MOF) was the executing agency and the Ministry \nof Public Works (MPW) through its Program Management Office (PMO) was the implementing \nagency  for  both  projects.  The  implementation  of  Qaisar\u2013Bala  Murghab  Road  Project  was \nhampered  by  significant  security  challenges,  including  the  kidnappings  of  two  contractor \npersonnel, one of whom was subsequently killed. Due to the security threats and a lack of \nconstruction progress, the contract was terminated for convenience in November 2009. For the \nBala Murghab\u2013Leman Project, the civil works procurement failed in all three attempts made \nbetween 2007 and 2009, as each was unable to attract any bids from qualified contractors. As of \nDecember 2009, the combined physical progress of these two projects was approximately 5%, \nand the combined undisbursed amount was $202 million.  \n \n6.  The rising prices for construction materials and labor during the prolonged construction \ndelay, and the need for additional funds for project security, led to a significant shortfall in project \nfinancing. To fill the funding gap and complete the entire 233-km section from Qaisar to Leman, \nin  December  2010,  ADB  approved  $340  million  under  Grant  0244-AFG:  Road  Network \nDevelopment Investment Program Tranche 2 (Project 2) under the Multi-tranche Financing \nFacility Road Network Development Investment Program (the MFF) to finance the cost overruns \nunder both sections.4 As a result, the total amount of ADB financing for the entire road section \nfrom Qaisar to Leman increased to $542 million, comprising the newly approved $340 million \nunder Grant 0244 and the undisbursed $202 million under Grants 0012 and 0081. In a new \napproach, the civil works contract was re-tendered as one large design-build contract with an \nintention to attract bids from quality international firms capable of managing the complex risks in \nthe Afghanistan context. The contract was awarded in December 2011 to a joint venture of U.S. \nand Turkish firms in the amount of $477.8 million. To ensure the works could proceed in a secure \nenvironment, $30 million of the overall contract amount was allocated for community development \nand $50 million of the overall contract amount was allocated for security services from the Afghan \nPublic  Protection  Force  (APPF),  the Government  of Afghanistan-controlled  security  service \nprovider.  \n \n7.  Poor coordination among the MPW/PMO, the contractor and the consultant caused \nsubstantial  implementation  delays  and  several  contractual  disputes.  The  security  threats \nremained a major challenge. During implementation, the contractor only had access to the 82-km \nsection from Leman to Dari Bum while the remaining 151 km from Qaisar to Dari Bum was not \nhanded over as it remained unsecured. The contract was terminated in August 2014 after a series \nof contract disputes with the overall physical progress standing at approximately 15%. The \ndisbursements of the three grants under Project 2 at the time of contract termination was $208 \nmillion. \n \n8.  Following the change in the MPW\u2019s leadership in May 2015, the government, with the \nsupport  of  ADB,  made  a  major  change  in  the  PMO\u2019s  personnel  to  strengthen  its  project \nimplementation  capacity.  In  addition,  to  manage  the  persistent  security  threats,  the  FCAS \napproach has been adopted for the ongoing ADB financed projects. The contractors were given \ndispensation to make their own security arrangements with third party security firms instead of \nbeing required to use the APPF. These changes have led to significant progress for two ongoing \n                                                \n3  ADB.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors to the Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan: Road Network Development Investment Program Tranche 2. Manila. The MFF was approved on  \n27 November 2008 for $400 million. Financing for tranche 1 was utilized to fill the financing gap for the Andkhoy\u2013\nQaisar Road Project and North\u2013South Corridor Project.  \n ", "3 \nADB-financed projects in the security-volatile provinces of Helmand and Paktika, where contract \nawards  and  disbursements  have  proceeded  apace.  In  addition,  the  National  Procurement \nAuthority was introduced in 2015 to provide oversight support for procurement and greatly \nimproved transparency in Afghanistan\u2019s public procurement processes. In parallel, the Leman\u2013\nDari Bum section, which was left uncompleted under the terminated contract, was re-tendered in \ntwo international competitive bidding packages and the contracts were awarded in September \n2017. Recruitment of a consulting firm to carry out the detailed design of the Qaisar\u2013Dari Bum \nsection is in progress and mobilization is expected by March 2018. \n \n9.  While making efforts to resume the work, the government requires additional funding, as \n$232 million has been spent under the previous contract on the civil works, security services and \ncontractual dispute. The remaining amount of $310 million under the three grants is inadequate \nto finance the remaining work of the Qaisar-Leman section. An estimated $130 million is required \nto complete the unfinished 82-km section from Leman to Dari Bum, and an estimated $330 million \nto complete the 151-km section from Qaisar to Dari Bum. Furthermore, Grant 0244, under which \nan uncommitted amount of $220 million still remains, will expire on 28 November 2018 because \nthe MFF expires. Based on the current progress of Project 2, it will take the government at least \n5 more years, i.e., until June 2022, to utilize all the funds, which will exceed the MFF availability \nperiod by 3.5 years. To ensure sufficient funds for completing the Ring Road, the government \nrequested to restructure Project 2\u2019s financing by (i) cancelling $180 million from Grant 0244,  \n(ii) combining the cancelled amount of $180 million with $150 million of the 2017 allocation for \nAfghanistan, and (iii) utilizing the combined amount of $330 million to finance a new stand-alone \nproject for construction of the 151-km section from Qaisar to Dari Bum. The remaining amount of  \n$130 million ($40 million under Grant 0244 and $90 million under Grant 0081) will be sufficient to \nfinance the uncompleted Leman\u2013Dari Bum section. \n \n10.  Lessons learned. To ensure the successful implementation of the project, ADB and the \ngovernment have taken the lessons from the failures of the previous attempts and introduced \npreventive and corrective measures using an FCAS approach5 as follows:  \n \n(i)  Contractors to manage their own security. Based on the improved performance \nof the ongoing projects in Helmand and Paktika following the adoption of FCAS \napproach, the civil works contractors will be allowed to arrange their own project \nsecurity, which will be made a pay item of the contract. To ensure that the security \nbudget is effectively spent, the payments for security will be linked to the physical \nprogress  of  the  project.  In  addition,  the  project  scope  includes  community \ndevelopment works to help obtain the support of local communities and thus \nindirectly improve the project\u2019s security.   \n \n(ii)  Project implementation capacity strengthened. The change in the MPW\u2019s \nleadership and the PMO\u2019s personnel in 2015 have significantly improved the \ngovernment\u2019s  implementing  capacity.  Continued  strengthening  of  the  PMO \nthrough the ongoing ADB-financed projects and the capacity-building programs \nunder this project should ensure the sustainability of the implementing capacity in \nthe short and medium term. \n \n(iii)  Design-bid-build modality with contract size suitable for local contractors. \nThe  change  in  project  modality  from  a  large  design\u2013build  contract  to  the \nconventional design\u2013bid\u2013build contracts of smaller sizes was made to improve the \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2016. Afghanistan: Enhanced Project Delivery Approach Paper. Manila.   \n ", "4 \nproject\u2019s readiness and reduce contractual risks. The civil works will be tendered \nin three packages to attract the capable local firms and hence increase competition. \nTo  minimize  procurement  delays,  the  single-stage\u2013one-envelope  bidding \nprocedure  will  be  used  instead  of  the  single-stage\u2013two-envelopes  bidding \nprocedure under the predecessor projects. \n \n11.  Value added by ADB assistance. Its rugged terrain and arid climate make Afghanistan \nprone to a wide range of natural hazards such as floods, droughts, landslides, avalanches, and \nearthquakes. Disasters triggered by these hazards have devastating impacts on lives, livelihoods, \nand physical infrastructure, including roads. Recent estimates by the World Bank indicate that the \nmodeled economic impacts of a 1-in-50-years flood could be $30 million for the road subsector \nalone, and $5.5 billion in the event of a 1-in-50-years earthquake.6 Moreover, climate change is \nexpected to lead to an increase in temperature and spring precipitation patterns, and alter the \nintensity and frequency of extreme weather events. These changes will have serious implications \nfor road planning, design, construction, and operation and maintenance. Accordingly, the project \nwill also develop the capacity for strengthening the disaster and climate resilience of road \ninfrastructure. \n \n12.  Strategic context. The project is ranked first among the investment priorities of the road \nimprovement master plan and is programmed under the Afghanistan National Development \nStrategy.7 The road is part of a strategic international and regional corridor. The recently updated \nTransport Master Plan under TA 8687-AFG considers the completion of the Ring Road as a critical \nelement in enabling regional connectivity,8 improving road transport services, and promoting \ninclusive economic growth in Afghanistan. The project is consistent with the country partnership \nstrategy for Afghanistan, 2017\u20132021,9 and is included in the country operations business plan for \nAfghanistan, 2017\u20132019.10 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impact: national trade in and through northwestern \nAfghanistan increased. The project will have the following outcome: an efficient and reliable road \nnetwork in northwestern Afghanistan developed.11 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  Output 1: Qaisar\u2013Dari Bum link of the national Ring Road constructed. Output 1 will \nbe a 151-km, two-lane national highway from Qaisar to Dari Bum, with appropriate drainage \nstructures and highway safety features.  \n \n15.  Output 2: Roadside infrastructure facilities for 60 local communities installed or \nconstructed. Output 2 will provide basic infrastructure such as rural access roads, culverts, \nsmall-scale irrigation schemes, schools, and clinics. The community development program will be \ndesigned based on needs assessment and culturally appropriate consultation with women. \n                                                \n6  The World Bank. 2017.

The conventional design\u2013bid\u2013build modality  was adopted for the project, instead of \ndesign\u2013build modality. The consultant for detailed engineering design is expected to be mobilized \nby March 2018. In parallel, the bid documents are being prepared by the PMO\u2019s international \n ", "7 \nspecialists. The preliminary design from the 2004 feasibility study is being improved using high-\nresolution satellite imagery.13 The bid documents are being prepared based on the improved \npreliminary design and expected to be ready by August 2017. The civil works will be procured in \nthree packages (40 km\u201360 km each). For project security, the government has agreed that the \ncontractors will be allowed to have their own security arrangements, including selection of a \nsecurity subcontractor. The MPW will hold consultations with the local communities to assess \ntheir needs for basic infrastructure as soon as the detailed design consultant is mobilized. \n \n22.  The project will undertake a climate change and disaster risk assessment for the road \nsubsector, including a probabilistic flood risk assessment of the road section that passes through \nBadghis and Faryab provinces, to inform the detailed design. The assessment proposed under \nthe project will provide a better understanding of the potential impacts of climate change and \ndisaster risk on the road infrastructure, and help identify critical road sections, the expected \nannual losses (of key hazards) for the critical sections, and recommendations on measures to \nmanage the risk. The assessment will build on the disaster risk management decision-making \ntool  developed  by  the MPW  with  support from the World  Bank  and  currently focusing  on \nearthquakes and landslides, and expand its scope to include data on flood risk.14 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Being the last missing link of the national Ring Road and a high-priority part of one of the \ncorridors under the CAREC Program, the project road will have a strategic impact on the efficiency \nof the transport corridor. The complete Ring Road will substantially improve regional connectivity, \nraise intercity travel speeds, reduce vehicle operating costs, and increase communities\u2019 access \nto social services and infrastructure. The community development component will build basic \ninfrastructure such as rural access roads, culverts, schools, clinics, and small-scale irrigation \nschemes. Thus, the project will benefit the economy as a whole by improving the investment and \njob-creation conditions in the areas. The economic evaluation of the project was undertaken using \nADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.15 The results show that the project is \neconomically feasible with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 12.4%. The results of \nsensitivity tests indicate that the project will remain economically viable even when assuming \nadverse developments of traffic and project cost. A 29.5% increase in project cost will reduce the \neconomic internal rate of return to 9%. A reduction in traffic by 24.3% would have the same \nimpact. \n \n24.  Government funding for maintenance is considered a major risk in Afghanistan. Given the \ncountry\u2019s narrow economic base and competing claims on scarce budget resources, Afghanistan \nwill in the foreseeable future have to rely on donor contributions to finance road maintenance.16 \nThe government needs about $250 million annually to maintain its roads, while the revenue \ncollected in 2016 through road user fees and taxes totaled $83 million. However, revenues from \nroad users are not earmarked for road financing but are part of the general budget. Supported by \ndonors, the government has taken steps to introduce a road asset management system that \n                                                \n13 The satellite imagery used for improving the preliminary design provides an accuracy of 1 meter for the horizontal \ndimension and 0.10 meters for the vertical dimension. \n14 MPW has recently developed an online decision-making support system that allows analysis and visualization of \npotential disaster risk scenarios for the Baghlan\u2013Bamiyan road and the Salang Highway. The system currently \nincludes the risks from earthquakes, landslides (dry), and avalanches. The system also provides disaster risk \nreduction strategies at the transport corridor scale, such as slope stabilization using vegetation.  \n15 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n16 ADB. Islamic Republic of Afghanistan: Road Asset Management Project. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/documents/afg-road-asset-management-project-rrp. \n \n ", "8 \nwould enable a more rational and systematic operation and maintenance regime. A review of road \nuser  charges  and  their  allocation  is  underway.  The  effective  introduction  of  a  road  asset \nmanagement system and the envisaged restructuring of road user charges entail major reforms. \nBased on ADB\u2019s experience with such reforms and Afghanistan\u2019s fragile and conflict-affected \nsituation, it difficult to determine a time-bound target for the conclusion of the reforms. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial management risk is moderate\u2014while the PMO has a fully functional finance \nsection with adequate financial management capacity and the overall capacity of the PMO \ncontinues to improve, delays may occur in the submission of the audited project financial \nstatements and country-level corruption is prevalent.  \n \n26.  Institutional capacity. The overall capacity of the MPW is still inadequate to implement \nthe ADB transport program with a portfolio value of about $1.4 billion. Therefore, the reliance on \nthe PMO (also financed by ADB) is inevitable. During the change in 2015, the program director \nand several key staff were removed because of their weak capacity, poor performance, and \ngovernance issues. The vacant positions were filled by new staff who were jointly selected by the \nMPW, MOF, and ADB in a transparent recruitment process. Later, three international experts \nwere engaged to support the PMO in the field of highway design, contract management, and \ninvoluntary resettlement. These changes have significantly improved the overall capacity of the \nPMO, as verified by the steady improvement in the portfolio performance from January 2016 to \ndate. With its current staffing (22 professionals and 30 supporting staff), the PMO\u2019s capacity is \ndeemed adequate to implement the ADB transport program, including this project.  \n \n27.  Financial management. An updated financial management assessment of the MPW and \nPMO took into consideration their overall capacity, including governance, staffing, budgeting, \nfund-flow arrangements, accounting and financial reporting systems, internal control procedures, \nfinancial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. It was found that, \nfrom a financial management perspective, the overall control risk is moderate, and that the MPW \nand PMO have adequate experience and capacity in financial management to manage the project \nfunds as well as adequate fund flow, accounting, and budgeting arrangements.  The 2015 \nstrengthening of the PMO has significantly improved its overall capacity. The PMO\u2019s finance \nsection staff includes a section manager, five accountants, and a trainee. To support the finance \nsection more efficiently in the conduct of financial management and further strengthen the staff\u2019s \ncapacity, the PMO is currently recruiting an international financial management specialist.  \n \n28.  The MPW conducts internal audits periodically, and annual external audits have yielded \nsatisfactory results since ADB\u2019s engagement with the MPW in 2003. The MPW is responsible for \nensuring an adequate audit trail, and an independent auditor acceptable to ADB has been auditing \nthe annual financial statements in accordance with auditing standards. Although the financial \nmanagement risk is assessed to be moderate, major delays were observed in the submission of \nthe audited project financial statements, and this needs to be monitored closely.  \n \n29.  Procurement and anticorruption. For the procurement of project-related goods, works, \nand non-consulting and consulting services, ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) shall apply. The civil works will be packaged in three open competitive bidding packages, \nfor about 40 km\u201360 km each. To mitigate procurement delay, the single-stage\u2013one-envelope \nbidding procedure will be used. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \n ", "9 \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOF.  Policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 12). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  Poverty and social. Socially, the improved road is expected to ameliorate the mobility \nconstraint in accessing education, health services, employment, and wage labor. Better mobility \nmay contribute to increased market-based production, enabling small farmers and herders to \nimprove food security and income. (The poverty and social assessment conducted for the project \nrevealed the extent of poverty in the country\u2014including, among other factors, (i) a high rate of \nfood insecurity affecting one-third of the population, (ii) a lack of access to improved water \nresources, and (iii) limited access to education and health services.)  \n \n31.  Gender. The gender assessment revealed high maternal and infant mortality rates, less \nmobility of women than of men, and women\u2019s overall low status. While the project\u2019s long-term \nimpact is expected to improve women\u2019s physical access to education, health, and other services \nby shortening travel times and making roads safer, these benefits are indirect. The project will \nensure equal pay for equal work among men and women. The project will attempt to benefit the \nwomen  and  children  in  communities  along  the  road  alignment  through  the  community \ndevelopment  component.  To  ensure  that  women\u2019s  needs  are  dealt  with  meaningfully, \ninfrastructure subprojects will be selected based on separate consultations with the communities\u2019 \nwomen, instituted in a culturally appropriate manner. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS)  (2009),  the  project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are as follows.17 \n \n33.  Environment (category B). The project road will mostly follow the existing dirt track\u2019s \nalignment, so the environmental impacts are expected to be minimal. The initial environmental \nexamination prepared for Project 2 in 2010 was updated in accordance with ADB\u2019s SPS, and was \ndisclosed in August 2017. The initial environmental examination will be updated by the detailed \ndesign consultant, whose mobilization is expected by October 2017. It is anticipated that the major \nenvironmental impacts of the project will occur during construction and will include soil erosion, \nair and water pollution, noise impacts, occupational health and safety issues, and cutting of trees. \nAdequate  mitigation  measures  are  included  in,  and  will  be  implemented  through,  an \nenvironmental management plan. Emissions from the increased traffic volume will be minimized \nby  vehicle  speed  control.  The  environmental  management  plan  stipulates  that  capacity \ndevelopment be provided through training workshops before and during construction. Due to \nsecurity issues on the site, additional public consultations will be conducted during the detailed \ndesign stage (before construction). The proposed subprojects under the community development \ncomponent (output 2) will be screened by the PMO. The proposals that will cause significant \nimpacts on the environment (category B or A) will not be considered. \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Most of the road improvement work will be \ncarried out within the existing right-of-way. However, acquisition of privately owned land presently \nbeing used for agricultural, residential, and commercial purposes will be needed to meet the \nminimum standard pavement and embankment width of 12 meters for national roads. Based on \na preliminary assessment, works in all three road sections (Dari Bum\u2013Bala Murghab, Bala \n                                                \n17  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "10 \nMurghab\u2013Gormach, and Gormach\u2013Sar Chashma) will require the acquisition of 34.6 hectares of \nagricultural and 8.96 hectares of residential and commercial land, and will have an impact on \n14,701 square meters of primary and secondary residential and commercial structures. It is \nestimated that 491 households (3,437 individuals) will be affected. Of these, 168 persons will \nexperience significant impacts, i.e., be displaced from housing or lose 10% or more of their \nproductive assets. Access to the project sites is difficult at this time because of security threats. \nThe anticipated land acquisition impact was assessed by using satellite imagery in combination \nwith highway design software. Based on this and consultation with village representatives, three \ndraft land acquisition and resettlement plans, one for each road section, were prepared in \naccordance with Afghanistan law and ADB\u2019s SPS. The draft plans were endorsed by the MPW \nand disclosed on the ADB website by 15 August 2017. These will be updated following detailed \ndesign, consultations, detailed measurement surveys, and valuation of assets.  \n \n35.  Land acquisition and resettlement plan implementation will be monitored, and semi-annual \nmonitoring reports will be submitted to ADB and the MPW for review and disclosure. The proposed \nworks under the community development component will involve land acquisition. The proposals \nthat will have involuntary resettlement impacts will not be considered. The PMO will screen \ncommunity proposals to ensure that this requirement is met. \n \n36.  The MPW has demonstrated a commitment to manage social risks while implementing \nthe three tranches of an ongoing MFF Transport Network Development Investment Program. This \nhas also enabled the continuation of the PMO\u2019s environmental and social safeguards unit beyond \nits initial establishment. The unit exhibits a good level of proficiency in understanding the laws, \nrules,  and  procedures  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement-related  tasks,  and  the  social \nsafeguards requirements of ADB. MPW officers as well as PMO project managers will participate \nin orientation workshops on ADB\u2019s SPS and other land acquisition and resettlement topics to be \nconducted under RETA 7433.18 \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Communities along the project alignment comprise \nmainly Pashtuns and some other, smaller ethnic groups. These are all mainstreamed into \nAfghanistan's general society and culture and cannot be considered as indigenous people as \ndefined under ADB\u2019s SPS. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n38.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nVolatile  Civil works will be procured in small and medium-sized packages to involve local \nsecurity in  contractors. The contractors are allowed to make their own security arrangements. The \nproject area  community development works will create a sense of ownership and gain support from \nlocal communities for the project. \nUncertain  In the short and medium term, ADB\u2019s Road Asset Management Project will provide \nfinancial  maintenance for selected major highways and develop an asset management system to \nsustainability  help the government prioritize O&M works. In the long term, USAID\u2019s Road Sector \nof O&M  Sustainability Program is supporting road sector reform by establishing a road authority \nand road fund that will help develop and allocate O&M resources. \n                                                \n18 ADB.2009.
