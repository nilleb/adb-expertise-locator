I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Upper Secondary Education Development \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The  project  is  a  continuation  of  the  first  Upper  Secondary  Education  Development \nProject,2 which was successfully completed in 2011. The project will help the Government of \nViet Nam promote its ongoing reform initiative for upper secondary education (USE) through \nupgrading of teaching and learning to international standards, improving student access and \nretention, and strengthening school management for USE. The project will be national in scope, \nwith investments to improve access targeted to selected disadvantaged provinces. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country context. Viet Nam has achieved high economic growth since the mid-1990s \nand according to the World Bank\u201fs World Development Indicators, Viet Nam has been ranked \nas a lower-middle-income country since 2010. Gross domestic product per capita reached \n$1,224 in 2010, with an average annual growth rate of 6.8%. To sustain growth, Viet Nam\u201fs \nindustrial and services sectors will need to undergo substantial reforms to remain competitive; \nthis  will  in  turn  depend  on  a  skilled  workforce.  Improvements  in  access  to  educational \nopportunities at the upper secondary school (USS) level will help boost the quality of the labor \nforce. Young workers (aged 20\u201339 years) represent half (50.5%) of the total labor force, but \nless than 30% of the workforce has completed USE. \n \n4.  Government  development  plan  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy.  The \ngovernment\u201fs socioeconomic development plan for 2011\u20132015 has identified the development \nof  a  high-quality  labor  force  as  one  of  three  key  pillars  for  sustainable  and  equitable \ndevelopment  of  the  country.3 The  Asian  Development  Bank\u201fs  (ADB)  country  partnership \nstrategy for Viet Nam in 2012\u201320154 has also accorded priority to improving the employability of \nVietnamese youth. USE is particularly important in terms of ensuring (i) an effective transition \nfrom basic to higher-level education; and (ii) the entrance quality of USS graduates, of which \nsome proceed to tertiary education and others enter the labor market. \n \n5.  Achievements of the first Upper Secondary Education Development Project. The \nfirst  project  was  designed  and  approved  in  2002  when  USE  in  Viet  Nam  was  still \nunderdeveloped. The national USE gross enrollment rate (GER) was only 15% in school year \n(SY) 2000 and the quality of curriculum and textbooks was poor. The principal objectives of the \nfirst project were (i) to improve access to USE, and (ii) to develop the curriculum and textbooks \nfor  core  subjects.  To  date,  general  USE  coverage  and  the  provision  of  curriculum  and \ninstructional materials have expanded. As of 2011, the USE GER reached 56.3%, while the net \nenrollment rate was 50.4%. Teacher quality has also improved through updated curricula and \ntextbooks. \n \n6.  Lessons from the first project. Lessons from the first USE project (and other related \nprojects) have been taken into consideration in the design and implementation plan of this \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. A more detailed design and monitoring framework is in \nProject Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n2  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for the Upper Secondary Education Development Project. Manila (Loan 1979-VIE, approved \non 18 December). \n3  Government of Viet Nam. 2011. Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015. Ha Noi. \n4  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy, Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila. ", "2   \nproject.  Previous  projects  targeted  disadvantaged  areas  at  the  provincial  level.  However, \ndistricts show large variations in educational indicators, and the USE project sites for this project \nwill therefore be identified at the district or school level. Baseline data sources have been \nabsent. The project will use the results from indicators that can be more easily measured.  \n \n7.  Remaining and new challenges. The first USE project was successfully implemented \nand  achieved  its  expected  project  outcome.  However,  several  issues  remain  and  new \nchallenges are emerging that need to be addressed. These include the: (i) overall poor quality of \ninstruction and limited relevance of curricula, (ii) limited access for disadvantaged groups to \nUSS, and (iii) weak planning and management capacity of local authorities for improving USE. \n \n8.  Performance and quality. While the USS completion rate is high (92.6% in SY2010), the \naverage  academic  performance  of  USS  students  is  still  low  compared  with  those  in  the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations.5 In  SY2010,  only  10.3%  of  USS  attained  national \nstandards. Many USS graduates could not meet the expectations of either industry or higher \neducation. Achieving significant improvement in the quality and relevance of USS programs is \ncrucial. To address these concerns, the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) is undertaking \nseveral reforms, including improving the quality of teachers and teaching methods, and curriculum \nreform. MOET will adapt the curriculum based on international standards, and in accordance with \nanticipated economic and social needs. \n \n9.  Access  and  retention. Having achieved impressive overall economic growth rates, \npoverty  incidence  is  now  concentrated  in  four  vulnerable  groups:  poor  households,  ethnic \nminorities,6 people with special needs, and women and girls. While the national USE GER has \nimproved  dramatically,  the  disadvantaged  target  provinces  have  much  lower  rates.  Poor \nstudents  have  a  completion  rate  of  about  75%,  considerably  below  the  national  average \ncompletion rate. The student enrollments of low-income households are below those of high-\nincome households as a result of the heavy burden of direct and indirect education costs. \nPhysically disabled persons have limited opportunity to access USE. Access to USE needs to \nbe expanded and educational opportunities provided to disadvantaged students. \n  \n10.  Planning  and  management.  Gaps  in  subsector  management  undermine  the \naccountability and effectiveness of USE. While the government has introduced a decentralized \neducation  policy,  capital  expenditure  by  local  authorities  varies,  with  many  not  allocating \nsufficient funding;7 contributing factors are limited budgets and the low importance placed on \nUSE. The inspection of schools is limited, leading to significant differences in the quality of \nprograms  and facilities.8 An  international  study conducted  by  the World  Economic  Forum9 \nindicated that capacity building is needed for school management in Viet Nam. \n \n11.  Link to ongoing reform initiatives. The project will support the ongoing Secondary \nEducation Sector Development Program,10 which promotes 10 education reform actions,11  and \n                                                \n5  Only 40.1% of USS students received \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d grades in the five-grade evaluation in SY2011 in Viet Nam, \nwhich was considerably lower than the similar national monitoring of other Asian countries.  \n6  There is a wide gap among ethnic groups, ranging from the 6.6% net enrollment rate among the Hmong to 61.8% \namong the Kinh in 2009. \n7  Only 58% of capital expenditure is allocated to the local portion (74% of total education expenditures was allocated \nto the local portion in 2010). \n8  Inspection of USS is conducted once every 5 years.  \n9  Viet Nam was rated 123rd out of 142 countries regarding school management quality in the World Economic \nForum. 2011. Global Competitiveness Report 2011\u20132012. Geneva.  \n10 ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for the Secondary Education Sector Development Program. Manila (Loans 2582-VIE and \n2583-VIE, approved on 13 November). \n11 The 10 reform actions are (i) development of secondary education sector master plan; (ii) establishment of a \nnational accreditation agency for secondary schools; (iii) upgrading of a human resource management strategy; (iv) \nnationwide teacher assessment; (v) standard learning assessment through participation in the Organisation for ", "3 \n \nfinanced the Programme for International Student Assessment 2012 for Viet Nam. The project \nwill use the results of the assessment in developing a new secondary curriculum, innovative \nteaching methods, textbooks, and information and communication technology applications. \n \n12.  Innovations of the project. The project includes a number of new initiatives: (i) the \nContinuing Education Center (CEC) will be restructured from conventional informal education \ncenters into a platform for in-service teacher training (INSETT); (ii) more attention will be paid to \npractical skills of classroom teaching through the use of teaching simulation rooms for teacher \ntraining  university  (TTU)  students;  (iii)  ethnic  minority  students  will  receive  financial  and \nacademic support to reduce dropout; and (iv) a research study will explore applicable public\u2013\nprivate partnership models for USE. The project is structured as a follow-on loan to the first USE \nproject rather than a sector loan. The selection criteria for the provinces, schools, and teachers \nand/or students that will benefit from key project activities will be approved by ADB. \n \n13.  Development coordination. ADB is a member of the education sector group, which \nserves as a donor coordination framework for the education sector. In Viet Nam, ADB has been \nthe principal development partner in the secondary education subsector. The governments of \nAustralia and Belgium have provided grant assistance to secondary education as cofinanciers of \nsome ADB projects. ADB is the only development partner providing USE support. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The impact of the project will be improved employability of the young labor force aged \n18\u201324 in Viet Nam. The project outcome will be improved readiness of USS graduates for \ntertiary and vocational career development. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n1.  Upper  Secondary  Education  Quality  Enhanced  to  meet  International \nStandards12 \n \n15.  Improvement of teaching strategies through pre-service teacher training and in-\nservice teacher training. Capacity building of TTU lecturers and curriculum specialists will help \nprepare a new curriculum, with supporting textbooks and teacher training, in order to improve \nUSE quality from 2015 onwards. The project will provide (i) overseas short-term training courses \non curriculum and textbook drafting skills for approximately 75 core specialists to assist them to \ndevelop the new curriculum and textbooks, and (ii) 3 in-country INSETT training activities for \napproximately 18,750 teachers regarding piloting and implementing the new USE curriculum \nand textbooks.  \n \n16.  Provision of textbooks and development of instructional materials based on the \nnew upper secondary education curriculum. The new USE curriculum will be developed by \nMOET  using  government  funding,  with  implementation  support  by  the  project  through:              \n(i) textbooks that support the new curriculum for pilot and nationwide use; (ii) teaching materials \n                                                \nEconomic  Co-operation  and  Development\u201fs  Programme  for  International  Student  Assessment  and  national \nachievement monitoring; (vi) periodic curriculum review and upgrading system; (vii) policy on the use of information \nand communication technology in teaching and learning; (viii) development of a new equivalency program; (ix) \nintegrated secondary education for children with special needs; and (x) conditional cash transfers. \n12 \u201cInternational standards\u201d is defined in government\u201fs various education and training sector plans and strategies as \nthe quality standards in developed countries (e.g., member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development). \u201cRegional standards\u201d refer to the quality standards of member countries of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. ", "4   \nand guidelines to assist in piloting the effective use of textbooks; and (iii) specific and targeted \nteaching support materials/teaching aids for approximately 800 USS in EM regions. \n \n17.  Improving the academic environment for gifted upper secondary school students. \nThe project will support the strengthening of a selected number of schools assigned to nurture \ngifted  students  through  developmentally  appropriate  programs.  The  project  will  provide             \n(i) laboratory equipment and teaching aids in physics, chemistry, and biology; (ii) in-country \ntraining for approximately 833 teachers on advanced coursework from abroad in support of \ngifted and talented education; and (iii) short-term overseas training for up to 15 teachers and \nvice-principals selected by MOET in consultation with ADB. \n \n18.  Support for a continuing education center to improve in-service teacher training. \nTo expand the capacity and improve the effectiveness of a provincial CEC to implement the new \nINSETT for USS teachers, the project will provide (i) approximately 63 sets of teaching and \npractical  equipment,  and  textbooks  and  teaching  materials  to  relevant  libraries  to  support \nprograms  conducted  by  the  CEC;  and  (ii)  in-country  training  on  curriculum  reform  for \napproximately 15 teachers from each CEC. \n \n19.  Improving the quality of foreign language training and education. The project will \nsupport the improvement of the oral communication skills of USS English language teachers \nthrough: (i) the procurement of books for 2,700 schools; (ii) the provision of quality audiovisual \nequipment to equip one specialist foreign language room in each province; and (iii) in-country \ntraining for core English teachers to focus on enhancing student\u201fs listening and speaking skills. \n \n20.  Establishment  of  centers  for  pedagogical  excellence.  Teachers  learn  best  by \nobserving  highly  effective  classroom  practice.  Therefore,  six  centers  for  pedagogical \nexcellence13 will be established to enable TTUs and pedagogical faculties to more effectively \ntrain prospective teachers. These simulation classrooms will showcase highly effective practices, \nincluding how to engage students in their learning and how to plan, manage, and assess \nstudent  outcomes.  Specifically,  the  project  will  (i)  establish  6  Centres  for  Pedagogical \nExcellence; (ii) provide simulation teaching equipment; (iii) provide construction (or upgrading) \nof teaching simulation rooms; (iv) provide in-country training workshops for approximately 20 \nlecturers per center; and (v) provide a two-week overseas training program for 6 TTU lecturers \nand nine specialists from MOET to acquire pedagogical expertise. \n \n21.  Improved teaching of selected subjects. To improve the quality and relevance of USE \nto national goals, five key subjects have been identified for specific improvement.14 Effective \napproaches  to  teaching  and  learning  will  be  developed  for  each  subject.  The  project  will            \n(i) provide in-country training to improve the teaching practices of core teachers; (ii) support \nteachers in recording, publishing, and sharing effective practice; (iii) provide short-term OST for \n15 teachers to acquire updated teaching methodologies; and (iv) conduct an assessment study \non the new teaching methods in mathematics. \n \n22.  Support for academically disadvantaged groups. To facilitate access to USS, and in \nparticular access by academically disadvantaged students, the project will build the capacity of \nteachers by conducting in-country INSETT training programs. Teachers will be assisted to \ndevelop a range of self-study materials and guidelines to ensure that students undertaking study \nvia distance education have access to appropriate materials and support. \n \n                                                \n13 Centers for pedagogical excellence will be established at the following six TTUs: Can Tho, Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh \nCity, Hue, Tay Nguyen, and Thai Nguyen. \n14 The subjects are biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and social sciences. ", "5 \n \n2.  Increased  Access  and  Retention  of  Disadvantaged  Groups  to  Upper \nSecondary Education15 \n \n23.  New facility development at existing upper secondary schools in target provinces. \nTo improve access to quality facilities for students in the disadvantaged target provinces,16 the \nproject will provide 1,050 rooms (and furniture) at existing USS, and specialized equipment for \n152 of the newly constructed facilities. These facilities will also help improve the quality of \nlearning outcomes by students who attend USS in the disadvantaged target provinces. \n \n24.  Support for ethnic minority boarding schools. To encourage increased participation \nof ethnic minority students, the project will improve the learning environment in selected ethnic \nminority  boarding  USS  through  provision  of  information  technology,  library,  and  related \nequipment. \n \n25.  Pilot an inclusive education program for students with special needs. To ensure \nimproved access to USE by students with special needs and to develop an effective and \nsustainable approach to disabilities  within the USE subsector, a pilot program focused on \ndeveloping appropriate teaching and learning environments for students with special needs will \nbe conducted. The project will support the: (i) development of sign language tools for deaf \nstudents, (ii) development and provision of instructional materials on sign language for inclusive \neducation centers, and (iii) provision of in-country training in the management of inclusive \neducation and teaching methodologies for 600 teachers in inclusive education centers. \n \n26.  Education for sustainable development support for disadvantaged groups. To help \ndisadvantaged students continue with education and training programs after completing USE, \nthe project will help develop their lifelong skills. The project will provide three in-country teacher \ntraining programs for approximately 1,650 teachers with focus on (i) developing active and \nengaging approaches to teaching and disciplines that are particularly effective for academically \ndisadvantaged  students,  (ii)  developing  high-quality  life  skills  together  with  an  improved \nunderstanding of environment and social issues, and (iii) ensuring the cultural preservation of \nethnic minorities. \n \n27.  Capacity development of private sector schooling. To improve access to USE for \ndisadvantaged groups, new models of finance and management need to be explored that would \nenable private education providers to play an increased role. The project will provide support to \ngovernment agencies and MOET to undertake research and develop a model on how public\u2013\nprivate partnerships can be most effectively applied within USE. The project will also pilot the \nprovision of in-country teacher training to 300 teachers from private USS. \n \n3.  Strengthened Planning and Management of Upper Secondary Education \n \n28.  Capacity development of upper secondary education managers. The project will \nprovide  in-country  training  to  improve  significant  aspects  of  USE  including  planning, \n                                                \n15 Beneficiaries of Output 2 defined as \u201edisadvantaged groups\u201f will include: (i) ethnic minorities, (ii) physically \ndisadvantaged students, (iii) students from poor household, (iv) students who are academically disadvantaged, and \n(v) students studying in private schools where the average teacher quality is often lower than that in public schools. \nExcept for school construction and provision of equipment, Output 2 activities will be implemented nationwide.  \n16 The disadvantaged target provinces were selected using the socioeconomic and educational selection criteria \nprovided in Selection Criteria and Profile of Beneficiary Provinces and Districts for Civil Works (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). The list of 33 target provinces for civil works is provided in List of \nBeneficiary Provinces for Civil Works (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Target schools \nwill be finalized based on the site condition at implementation stage. All sub-outputs other than civil works will be \nimplemented nationwide (63 provinces). The criteria for selecting teachers and other staff for in-country and \noverseas trainings will be developed during implementation and approved by ADB. ", "6   \nmanagement, and leadership for education reform. The training programs will involve 2,700 \nUSS  principals,  and  600  directors  of  CECs,  and  principals  of  complementary  educational \nschools. Key USE managers participating in an OST program will learn effective approaches to \nquality management for USE programs. The project will procure school mapping software to \nimprove education planning capacity. \n \n29.  Provision  of  block  grants  to  support  local  government.  The  funding  of  local \ngovernment departments and the effective and efficient use by each Department of Education \nand Training (DOET) of their block grant has been a concern for some time. The project will \nsupport building the planning and management capacity of DOETs to meet local needs, and \ndeveloping agreed solutions to key management issues for each DOET to meet the reform \nrequirements  associated  with  the  introduction  of  a  revised  curriculum,  new  approaches  to \nteaching and learning, and new textbooks after 2015. Each DOET will receive one block grant \npackage including a block grants manual, orientation workshops, and monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E) training. \n \n30.  Support for pilot research studies for upper secondary education. The project will \nsupport the use of action\u2013research approaches to help improve strategic planning capacity of \neducation authorities to promote and implement the ongoing MOET \u201ceducation renovation\u201d \ninitiatives. Five action\u2013research packages are anticipated with a focus on (i) developing a model \nof USS autonomy within a framework of social responsibility and accountability, (ii) developing \nmanagement  and  planning  skills  for  TTU  students,  (iii)  managing  curriculum  change  and \ndeveloping instructional materials for complementary USE, (iv) counseling students in USS, and \n(v) organizing USS applied science research. \n \n31.  Support  for  enhancement  of  research  and  training  capacity  for  education \nmanagement. The project will help strengthen the capacity of training and research centers for \neducation management by providing equipment for a multifunction room at the National Institute \nfor  Educational  Management  (NIEM),  and  in-country  training  to  develop  the  teaching  and \nscientific research capacity of lecturers at NIEM and the Institute of Educational Managers Ho \nChi Minh City. \n \n4.  Support for Project Implementation, Quality Assurance, and Monitoring \n \n32.  Capacity development of CPMU, PPMUs, and other Implementing Agencies. The \nproject will support the capacity strengthening of the central project management unit (CPMU), \nprovincial project management units (PPMUs), and other implementing agencies responsible for \nproject management and implementation. This output will provide in-country training for project \nmanagement. Consulting services, totaling 471 person-months, will be provided to support the \nCPMU in project implementation. \n \n33.  Provision of equipment and facilities to project implementing agencies. The project \nwill provide the necessary office equipment, furniture and facilities, and vehicles for the CPMU. \nEquipment will also be provided for PPMUs to ensure timely and quality project implementation. \n \n34.  Project monitoring, quality assurance, and evaluation. The project will strengthen \nproject monitoring and evaluation within the agreed M&E framework. Through review workshops, \noutput assessments, independent project evaluation, and external audits, the project will be \nclosely monitored and improvements will be made where required. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n37.  The government will establish an inter-ministerial project steering committee to guide \nand supervise the overall management of the project. As the executing agency, MOET will be \nresponsible for project management and provide guidance to the CPMU that oversees the day-\nto-day  implementation of  the  project. The  CPMU  will  comprise  a qualified full-time  project \nmanager, deputy project manager, and key technical staff acceptable to ADB. ADB approval for \nthe nomination of CPMU staff is a condition for loan effectiveness. All 63 provinces will establish \nPPMUs within each DOET; the DOETs will be the liaison between the CPMU and the PPMUs. \nThe PPMUs will be responsible for implementing activities at the provincial level. Selected TTUs, \nUSS,  and  the  NIEM  will  be  participating  agencies.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the Project Administrative Manual (PAM).19 \n                                                \n17 ADB will finance the amount of taxes and duties as it (i) is within reasonable country thresholds, (ii) does not \nrepresent an excessive share of the project investment, and (iii) is material and relevant to the project\u201fs success. \n18 ADB loan resources will finance the value added tax and corporate income tax charged to the consulting services \ncontract for the project implementation contract, which is estimated at 12% of the contract amount. \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The  major  economic  benefits  of  the  project  will  include:  (i)  improved  efficiency  of \ninfrastructure, personnel, and resources allocated to USE; and (ii) improved productivity of \ngraduates, who will contribute to economic development. The recurrent costs, to be borne by \nthe government after the project, are estimated at $660,000 per year and include the O&M of \nnew  school  facilities  and  equipment.  The  estimated  annual  recurrent  costs  after  project \nimplementation account for 0.24% of the USE operating cost during 2020\u20132025. This level of \ncost is sustainable, given the projected size of the education budget. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n39.  The financial management assessment has confirmed that MOET and key implementing \nagencies have sufficient capacity for project implementation. The departments of secondary \neducation; planning and finance; and education facilities, equipment and children\u201fs toys  of \nMOET are directly involved in this project. Having been involved in all ADB-funded secondary \neducation projects, these departments are experienced with ADB procedures, and past projects ", "9 \n \nwere successful.20 ADB\u201fs Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOET.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n40.  Poverty. Indigenous peoples in the northern and central mountain provinces suffer high \nlevels of poverty, and their average years of school attendance is lower than that of Kinh \nstudents, because students leave school early to do agricultural work, or, in the case of girls, to \nget married at a young age. \n \n41.  Gender. The project has a gender equity theme. The project will address the lack of \ngender-sensitive  teaching  and  learning  materials,  limited  access  by  female  teachers  and \nmanagement staff to training opportunities, and limited awareness about the value of education \nfor girls. The project gender action plan ensures that (i) all female management staff in CECs \nparticipate in management training; (ii) strategies promote female access to and completion of \nUSE; (iii) 40% of participants in INSETT, 55% of English teachers, and 60% of teachers trained \non  life  skills  curricula  are  female;  (iv)  new  curriculum  and  materials  are  gender-sensitive;         \n(v) separate latrines are provided for female and male students; (vi) 20% of provincial block \ngrants are earmarked for addressing gender issues; (vii) gender criteria are included in school \nnetwork mapping; and (viii) all M&E reports include sex- and ethnicity-disaggregated data. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n42.  Due diligence has been undertaken on the project design to assess potential impacts on \nenvironment, indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement. The project is categorized as C \nfor environment and involuntary resettlement, and B for indigenous peoples. \n \n43.  Environment and involuntary resettlement. No significant impact on the environment \nis anticipated. The project will not entail land acquisition or restrict access to lands, and no \nrelocation of people is planned. \n \n44.  Indigenous peoples. The project addresses access and equity issues related to poor \nethnic groups in 33 disadvantaged target provinces with large ethnic populations. The project \nensures ethnic inclusion and equity in all, quality USE teaching and learning including curricula, \ncapacity development, and management interventions. Key features of the ethnic group plan \ninclude: (i) targets for participation by ethnic teachers in various training, (ii) ethnicity-sensitive \ncurricula and instructional materials, (iii) training materials on life skills include analyses of key \nethnic minority social issues and vulnerability, (iv) selected civil work sites located in ethnic \nminority areas, and (v) guidelines for block grants to support local needs. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n45.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.21 The project is considered to be low risk. \n \n \n \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2008.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n46.  The government and MOET have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n47.  The government and MOET have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement. The government has also agreed that the loan will not \nbe declared effective unless MOET has established and set up the CPMU and appointed a full-\ntime  project  manager,  a  deputy  project  manager,  and  key  technical  staff  including  an \nappropriate  number  of  experts  in  curriculum  and  textbook  development,  equipment  and \ninstructional material development, finance, procurement, civil works, staff development, social \ndevelopment,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  administration,  whose  experience  and \nqualification will be approved by ADB. \n \nV.
