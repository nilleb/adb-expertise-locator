I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $60,000,000 (or its yuan equivalent) to Zhujiang Financial Leasing Company Limited (ZFL) \nfor the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Finance in Underdeveloped Regions Project in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing longer-tenor financing \nto  ZFL  for  lease  finance  to  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  located  in  the \nunderdeveloped central and western regions of the PRC. ADB\u2019s financing will meet ZFL\u2019s funding \nrequirements for medium-term funding, which is in short supply in the PRC. This will enable the \ncompany to provide longer-tenor lease finance to underserved segments, improve its asset\u2013\nliability profile, and diversify its funding sources. Being the first development finance institution \nlender, ADB will also add value by helping ZFL enhance its safeguards capacity. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  After more than three decades of strong economic growth in the PRC, the real gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth rate slowed to 6.7% in 2016 and 6.9% in 2017. ADB estimates \nthat GDP growth will be 6.4% in 2018.1 Despite rapid economic growth since the 1980s, regional \ndisparity and income inequality remain a major issue. Economic development in central and \nwestern regions lags significantly behind that in the coastal region in the east, where most foreign \ndirect investment and export-oriented industries are located. Measured by GDP per capita, all \nprovinces ranked in the lower half are located in the central and western regions. In 2016, the \nGDP per capita in the western province of Gansu was only 23% of that in Beijing, and the \ndisposable income per capita was only 28%. Strong economic growth has lifted more than 600 \nmillion people out of poverty between 1990 and 2010. However, over 65 million people were still \nliving below the national poverty line (average annual income per person below CNY2,300) in \n2016 most of whom lived in the central and western regions.2 There are currently 592 poverty-\nstricken counties designated by the central government, covering large rural areas in the central \nand western regions of the PRC. \n \n4.  Development of SMEs directly contributes to inclusive growth of the PRC economy, given \nthe important role of these enterprises in employment generation. Small businesses with 300 or \nfewer employees account for 98.6% of all firms in the PRC.3 SMEs contributed to over 60% of the \nPRC\u2019s GDP and approximately 50% of the country\u2019s tax income, and generated more than 80% \nof the urban employment as of YE2016.4 More job opportunities associated with faster growth of \nSMEs in central and western regions will help reduce regional disparity. According to data from \nthe National Bureau of Statistics, the number of SMEs in the central region grew by 5.8% in 2016 \nand in the western regions by 6.6%, which is much higher than in the eastern region (0.8%).5 \nDespite the major contribution from SMEs to the country\u2019s economic growth and their role as a \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Banks have shown a preference in lending to state-owned enterprises \nand larger enterprises operating in priority sectors identified in domestic industrial policy. As of \nthe end of 2017 (YE2017), credit to micro and small enterprises represented only 24.7% of total \nbank loans.6 SMEs in central and western regions have more restricted access to finance, with \naverage borrowing costs 0.7% higher than those in the eastern regions.7  \n \n5.  Leasing industry. The leasing industry can play an important role in a country\u2019s financial \nsystem as it is particularly suited for financing SMEs, which typically lack eligible collateral \nrequired for bank finance. The leasing industry has been growing rapidly in the PRC, filling a \nfinancing gap left by traditional bank financing. According to the World Leasing Yearbook, new \nleasing sales in the PRC expanded from $21.88 billion in 2008 to $136.45 billion in 2015, \nrepresenting  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  of  29.9%.  By  YE2016,  total  assets  reached \nCNY2.15 trillion, a 32.4% increase compared with the previous year. Total industry revenues \namounted to CNY1.54 trillion with an industry aggregate net profit of CNY26.8 billion.8 Despite \nrapid growth since 2008, the PRC\u2019s financial leasing industry still needs further development. \nLease market penetration measured as the ratio of lease finance over all fixed investment in plant \nand equipment in 2016 was only 6.0%, compared with 21.5% in the United States, 33.7% in the \nUnited Kingdom, and high single-digit rates in developed Asian countries such as Japan and the \nRepublic of Korea. The lease penetration rate measured as a percentage of lease finance to total \nGDP was 1.84% in the PRC in 2016, ranking it 17th among 50 countries.9 The leasing industry is \nalso much smaller than the banking industry, with assets totaling CNY232.3 trillion at YE2016. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  have  been  actively  supporting  leasing  in  the  PRC, \ntargeting a diverse range of development subsectors. ADB has provided $350 million in debt to \nfour PRC financial leasing companies for clean buses and health care finance since 2013. In \n2017, the ADB Board of Directors approved another $200 million loan to one of the largest leasing \ncompanies in the PRC for green bus leasing.10 ADB identified ZFL as a good partner to support \naccess to finance for SMEs. Established by one of the PRC\u2019s leading rural commercial banks, the \nGuangzhou Rural Commercial Bank (GRCB), ZFL\u2019s operations have a strong development focus \nwith a majority of its leasing portfolio being to SMEs and to clients located in the underdeveloped \ncentral and western regions of the PRC. ZFL has sound corporate governance, an experienced \nmanagement team, developed risk management systems, and good financial performance. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  ZFL was established in December 2014 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the GRCB and \nis a leasing company regulated by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC). The \ncompany has experienced rapid growth since its establishment. As of YE2017, its total assets \nwere CNY12.50 billion and total equity was CNY1.38 billion. ZFL is headquartered in Guangdong \n                                                \n6  CBRC.  2017.

Unlike \nGRCB which is restricted to operations in select cities in Guangdong province, ZFL holds a \nnational license. The company\u2019s leasing operations cover 28 out of the 31 provinces, with a strong \npresence in the underdeveloped central and western regions. Its exposures in Guangdong \naccounted for 26% of outstanding lease portfolio by YE2017, followed by three underdeveloped \nprovinces of Henan (21%), Guizhou (11%), and Sichuan (9%). Overall, 63% of ZFL\u2019s portfolio \nwas in the central and western regions of the PRC. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n8.  Ownership.  Integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted.11 No  significant  or  potentially \nsignificant risks were identified. Tax integrity due diligence was not required as the transaction \ndoes not involve intermediate jurisdictions or material related-party transactions.12 As noted, ZFL \nis a wholly owned subsidiary of the GRCB, one of the leading rural commercial banks in the PRC \nand was founded in 1951. As of YE2017, the GRCB ranked 216th among all commercial banks \nin the world and fourth among all rural commercial banks in the PRC in terms of core tier 1 capital. \nIt had total assets of CNY735.7 billion and a nonperforming loan ratio of 1.51% as of December \n2017, well below the industry average of 2.95%. The GRCB was listed on the Hong Kong Stock \nExchange on 20 June 2017 and is rated as Baa2 by Moody\u2019s. The GRCB has a diversified \nshareholder structure. Its largest beneficial owner is the Guangzhou municipal government, which \nholds 18.32% of GRCB shares through 14 state-owned enterprises. The remaining shareholders \nare mainly private sector entities and individual investors. There are no other shareholders directly \nor indirectly holding more than a 5% stake in the GRCB. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n9.  ADB will provide a senior secured loan of up to $60 million (or yuan equivalent) with tenor \nof up to 5 years. The ADB loan will fund lease finance to SMEs located in the underdeveloped \ncentral and western regions of the PRC. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  Use of proceeds. ZFL will use the proceeds of the ADB debt financing to fund lease \ncontracts with SMEs located in central and western regions of the PRC. The SMEs are defined \nper current policy and regulation promulgated by the government.13 Similarly, the central and \nwestern regions are defined as per current government policy.14 \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2003.

Monitoring. Monitoring of the project will be carried out by ADB over the life of the project. \nZFL will provide ADB with financial and other reports at predetermined regular intervals and as \nrequested. These reports will include (i) semiannual unaudited financial statements, (ii) annual \naudited financial statements, (iii) annual reporting of the SME lease portfolio financed under the \nADB loan, (iv) annual reports on selected development indicators agreed upon between ADB and \nZFL, and (v) an annual social and environmental performance report on safeguards and social \nprotection compliance. \n \n12.  Evaluation.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  prepare  and  submit \nmonitoring reports at least annually. The first report will be submitted no later than 12 months \nafter the first disbursement. \n  \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n13.  Provide  access  to  longer  tenor  debt  in  support  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises. The ADB 5-year loan will provide critically needed longer tenor funding to SMEs in \nunderdeveloped regions of the PRC, which face significant barriers in accessing finance. Leasing \nis a modality particularly suited for financing SMEs, which typically lack collateral required by \ncommercial banks. The ADB loan will improve SMEs\u2019 access to longer term lease finance in the \ntarget regions, thus broadly contributing to economic development and poverty alleviation. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n14.  Enhance ZFL\u2019s environmental and social safeguard capacity. ADB will be the first \ninternational finance institution to provide any financing to ZFL. As a condition precedent for \ndisbursement,  the  company  will  be  required  to  establish  an  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) that meets the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). ADB will continue to work with the company throughout the period of ADB investment to \nenhance the safeguard capacity of the company and support the company\u2019s adherence to high \nsafeguard standards and promote gender-inclusive measures in its operations. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n \n15.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: \n \n(i)  Improved  access  to  lease  finance  for  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprises and agribusiness companies through financial leasing. Despite \nthe importance of SMEs in job creation and output generation, SMEs still face \nsignificant barriers to accessing credit from financial institutions. This project will \npromote  access  to  finance  for  SMEs,  thereby  contributing  to  economic \ndevelopment. By targeting SMEs located in underdeveloped central and western \nregions, the project will contribute to inclusive growth of the PRC economy and \nhelp reduce regional disparity. \n(ii)  Developed financial leasing industry. By providing longer tenor finance to a \nyoung leasing company and introducing international best practice in safeguards, \nthe project will support the development of the financial lease industry. Despite \n ", "5 \nrapid  growth  since  2008,  the  PRC\u2019s  financial  leasing  industry  is  still \nunderdeveloped,  with  a  leasing  penetration  rate  that  is  below  that  in  other \ndeveloped markets. The current project extends ADB\u2019s support to the leasing \nindustry beyond the top tier leasing companies previously financed by ADB. \n \n16.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: enhanced sustainability of ZFL\u2019s \nlease financing capacity to SMEs. \n \n17.  Output. The output will be an increase in ZFL\u2019s lease financing capacity to SMEs, \nparticularly those located in underdeveloped regions. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  Consistency with  ADB  strategy and country strategy. The project supports four \npriorities identified by ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: (i) poverty reduction and inclusive \neconomic growth, (ii) environment and climate change, (iii) middle-income countries, and (iv) \nprivate sector development and operations.15 ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 highlights \nADB\u2019s focus on reducing vulnerability and inequality and promoting inclusive growth in middle-\nincome countries. It is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the \nPRC, which prioritizes supporting inclusive economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, \nand promoting private sector development through improving access to finance.16 \n \n19.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \nwith the Review of ADB\u2019s 2011 Financial Sector Operational Plan, which notes that ADB will \nsupport enhanced financial inclusion of the traditionally underserved, such as SMEs.17 The \nfinance sector operational plan review also called for increased support to leasing and other \nfinance subsectors such as credit guarantee and factoring, which supplement the commercial \nbanks and play an important role in improving SMEs\u2019 access to finance. ADB\u2019s enhanced poverty \nreduction strategy also states that ADB seeks to promote sound and efficient financial markets to \nimprove access to finance and achieve pro-poor growth.18 As noted, the project builds on previous \nADB support to the leasing industry in the PRC. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n20.  The loan is classified category FI for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand indigenous peoples. ZFL's existing and likely future portfolios, which are mostly in the SME \nsubsector with a strong focus on agriculture, health, education, tourism, clean energy, and \nenvironmental protection; its corresponding environment and social risks and impacts; and its \ncommitment and capacity for environmental and social management have been assessed. The \nmajority of ZFL\u2019s business activities have no or minimal adverse environmental impacts, and are \nunlikely to impact involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. ZFL has committed to establish \nan appropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB prior to first disbursement and appoint designated staff \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2014.

The ESMS \nwill  include  procedures  to  screen  and  categorize  transactions,  and  exclude  those  having \nsignificant impacts (category A) on environmental and social impacts and on indigenous peoples \nfrom ADB finance. ZFL will also apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, ensure that \ninvestments abide by applicable national laws and regulations, and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement.19 \n \n21.  ZFL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n(2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards. \nZFL will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. \nThe investment is categorized as having some gender elements and ZFL has set targets to \nincorporate gender measures into its operations. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n22.  ZFL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nC.
