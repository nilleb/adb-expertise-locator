THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  loan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the \nTransport Project Preparatory Facility.1 \n \n2.  The proposed facility will improve the start-up efficiency of priority transport projects in \nthe road, railway, and port subsectors by (i) preparing feasibility studies, detailed designs, and \nprocurement documents; and (ii) providing implementation support during the inception stage of \nproject implementation. The facility will contribute to good portfolio performance of transport \nsector projects. \n \nII.  THE FACILITY \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  strategic  position  in  fast-growing  South  Asia,  near  the  main  sea  lanes \nbetween Europe and Asia, has allowed Colombo to develop very early as an international port \ncity and subsequently as a transshipment point for cargo originating in or destined for the Indian \nsubcontinent.  The  country\u2019s  economy  faces  several  short-term  challenges  in  2016  as  the \ngovernment seeks to undertake difficult reforms to re-start fiscal consolidation and tackle high-\npriority structural reforms, but it has favorable medium-term prospects given that the issues are \nbeing dealt with proactively.2 Real gross domestic product growth was 4.8% in 2015, slightly \nhigher than in 2014.3 The strong increase in services, continued growth in agriculture, and a \npositive (albeit declining) contribution from industry helped the country maintain its growth. \nHowever, a slowdown in public and private investments, as well as the negative effects of \nslowing world trade, prevented Sri Lanka from achieving even faster growth. To attain high, \ninclusive, and sustained growth, the country needs to further invest in its international and \ndomestic transport infrastructure. \n \n4.  Sri Lanka\u2019s transport sector delivers key functions to international trade and its domestic \neconomy. Taking advantage of its strategic location in global trade, Sri Lanka developed several \ninternational  transport facilities,  of  which  Colombo  Port  is the most  important.  To  serve  a \ndynamic domestic economy, the functions of the transport sector have gradually changed, from \nmoving agricultural commodities toward Colombo to providing more diversified services and \ncatering to the value-adding manufacturing industry. New economic activities continue to be \nestablished close to population centers. They place heavy demands on the country\u2019s transport \nnetwork to provide adequate and high-quality access. \n \n5.  To manage the key transport challenges, the government has taken actions to improve \nthe performance of the transport sector on three tiers. First, international trade facilities\u2014such \nas international seaports, airports, and routes on the Asian Highway network\u2014will be operated \nand further improved to international standards. Second, a multimodal trunk network comprising \nhighways and railways will be improved and upgraded to provide reliable and efficient transport \nservices  within  the  country.  Third,  a  comprehensive  road  network  will  be  completed  and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2016. Sri Lanka: Staff Report for the 2016 Article IV Consultation and Request for a \nThree-Year  Extended  Arrangement  Under  the  Extended  Fund  Facility\u2014Press  Release;  Staff  Report;  Staff \nStatement, and Statement by the Executive Director for Sri Lanka. IMF Staff Country Report. No. 16/150. \nWashington, DC. \n3  Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \nmaintained  to  provide  access  for  rural  populations  to  the  multimodal  trunk  network.  The \ngovernment requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide support for the next stage \nof infrastructure development in the road, railway, and port subsectors. \n \n6.  Roads. Roads are the dominant mode of transportation in Sri Lanka, accounting for 93% \nof passenger transport, and 96% of freight transport. The road network is dense and well laid \nout, and provides basic spatial coverage of the country\u2019s population and centers of economic \nactivity. Extending across 132,072 kilometers (km), it is classified by function and administrative \nresponsibility  and  is  broken  down  into  expressways  (175  km)  and  national  (11,922  km), \nprovincial (15,975 km), and local roads (about 104,000 km). Expressways were integrated into \nthe network only after the Southern Expressway was completed in 2011. As of 31 May 2016, \nthree expressways are in operation. Under the guidance of the Ministry of Higher Education and \nHighways (MOHEH), the Road Development Authority (RDA) is updating its road master plan. \nUnder the proposed facility, RDA will formulate an expressway development program, and \nprepare an expressway project and a port access road to directly link the Colombo port area to \nthe expressway network. \n \n7.  Railways. The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation (MOTCA) manages the railway \nsubsector through Sri Lanka Railways (SLR). The development of a railway network in Sri \nLanka started in 1864. SLR currently operates 10 railway lines totaling around 1,500 route-km. \nAlmost 90% of the railway network of the country is single track; the rest consists of double, \ntriple, or quadruple tracks. All multiple lines, totaling 230 km, are on the Coastal Line, Kelani \nValley Line, Main Line, and Puttlam Line\u2014four major corridors in the Colombo Metropolitan \nRegion. The railway provides an important service during peak hours as it shuttles commuters \nbetween  the  outer  suburbs  and  central  Colombo. The government  intends  to  improve  the \nrailway transport system to complement the road transport system, both for passengers and \nfreight. ADB provided a TA grant to SLR to prioritize the required investment in Colombo\u2019s \nsuburban  railway  system, conduct  a feasibility  study  of  investment  projects,  and  build  the \nnecessary capacity of SLR.4 The proposed facility will prepare the detailed design, bidding \ndocuments,  safeguard  documents,  and  other  technical  studies  required  for  the  priority \ninvestment projects. \n \n8.  Ports. Maritime transport is essential for Sri Lanka as an island nation. Colombo Port \nhas become the world\u2019s 76th busiest port in 2013 by total shipping tonnage and the 32nd \nbusiest container port. The total container volume handled in Sri Lanka ports increased by \n108% from 2.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units in 2005 to 5.2 million twenty-foot equivalent \nunits in 2015. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) develops and operates port facilities under \nthe supervision of the Ministry of Ports and Shipping (MOPS). In addition to Colombo Port, the \ngovernment  is  considering  the  ports  in  Galle,  Hambantota,  Kankasanthurai,  Oluvil,  and \nTrincomalee for future development to meet the demands of growing international and domestic \nmaritime transport. Each port has its own strength and weakness. ADB is processing a TA grant \nto assist the SLPA in preparing a master plan for the future development of port facilities, \ndesigned to strategically allocate public sector resources for development and operation, and \nguide private sector investments. Based on the outcome of the TA grant, the proposed facility \nwill prepare the detailed design, bidding documents, safeguard documents, and other technical \nstudies required for priority investments in the port sector. \n \n9.  Government strategy. In its forthcoming Public Investment Program, 2016\u20132018, the \ngovernment aims to provide proper connectivity to the economic zones across the country by \n                                                \n4  ADB. Sri Lanka: Colombo Suburban Railway Project. http://www.adb.org/projects/49111-002/main. \n ", "3 \nroad transport, increase the share of railway transport for both passengers and freight, and \nenhance the competitive position of port facilities in the region.5 To ultimately lead the country \ntoward a status of upper-middle-level development, the government plans to allocate about 70% \nof public investment to economic infrastructure, including roads, railways, and ports. Among \nother sectors, ADB plans to continue its support of the transport sector to contribute to the \ngovernment\u2019s targets.6 \n \n10.  Financing modality and past experience. A TA loan is proposed as the financing \nmodality.7 The government had a good experience with this modality when it implemented a \nroad project preparatory facility (RPPF) during 2004\u20132015.8 In the past, project readiness in Sri \nLanka was problematic because detailed design and procurement documents were prepared \nonly  after  ADB  loans  had  been  approved  and  became  effective.  The  RPPF  significantly \nstrengthened the implementation readiness and portfolio performance of loans in the road \nsubsector. The main takeaways include: (i) the RPPF provided a platform for policy dialogue, \ninvestment  programming,  and  project  preparation;  (ii)  improved  the  readiness  of  project \nimplementation  by  decoupling  project  preparation  and  loan  processing;  and (iii)  the  RPPF \nshould include mechanisms for capacity building to improve the quality of project preparation \nand engineering design. To proactively manage project readiness issues in the new areas of the \ntransport sector, the government, through the facility, intends to continue the successful model \nin the road subsector with a focus on developing an expressway network in urban and rural \nareas, and replicating it to the railway and port subsectors. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be successfully implemented transport projects. The outcome will be \nimproved readiness of priority transport projects. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The outputs will be (i) feasibility studies and/or detailed designs of transport projects are \ncompleted, and (ii) implementation support for transport projects is provided. The facility will be \nimplemented through three components: road, railway, and port.9 The components may involve \ncross-cutting interventions in urban transport, regional cooperation and integration, multimodal \ntransport connectivity, and other related areas. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n13.  The facility is estimated to cost $27.7 million, including taxes and duties, physical and \nprice contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 1).10 \n \n                                                \n5  Government of Sri Lanka, Department of National Planning, Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs. \nForthcoming.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n16.  All transport sector investments to be prepared under the facility should be in line with \n(i) the government\u2019s national strategy and sector development plans, and (ii) ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy  for  Sri  Lanka.  The  four  investment  projects  in  the  preliminary  list \n(footnote 9) are the government\u2019s priority projects in the road, railway, and port subsectors; and \n ", "6 \nare in line with ADB\u2019s current country partnership strategy for Sri Lanka, making them eligible \nfor support under the facility. The terms of reference were prepared for the consulting services \nfor the four investment projects, covering technical aspects such as engineering design, road \nsafety,  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation,  regional  cooperation  and  integration, \nmultimodal connection, urban transport, and other related areas. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.  The recruitment of consultants will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) to obtain consulting services at \nfair market prices and to ensure economic and financial viability. \n \n18.  The ensuing transport investment projects to be prepared under the facility will support \nSri Lanka\u2019s overall economic growth and poverty reduction by reducing the transport costs to \nmajor international and domestic markets, and connecting communities with broad economic \nand social activities. The facility will support the government in preparing feasibility studies and \ndetailed designs, and will assist the executing and/or implementing agencies in procurement \nand  safeguard  implementation.  It  will  bridge  the  gap  between  project  preparation  and \nimplementation; minimize the delays normally observed between preparing feasibility studies \nand detailed designs, procurement activities, and commencement of actual works; and reduce \nthe financial charges, such as commitment and interest fees, under the ensuing projects. \n \n19.  The  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  include  carrying  out  economic  and \nfinancial assessments in accordance with the related policies and guidelines of the government \nand ADB. These assessments will help the government formulate economically and financially \nviable investment transport projects. \n \nC.  Governance \n20.  Policy and legal. Three ministries will act as executing agencies: MOHEH, MOTCA, \nand MOPS. They will formulate the policies and monitor the performance of the road, railway, \nand port subsectors. RDA, the implementing agency for the road component, was established \nas  a  statutory  authority  with  an  independent  legal  status  through  the  Road  Development \nAuthority  Act,  1981.  RDA\u2019s  chairperson  reports  to  the  MOHEH  secretary.  MOTCA  will \nimplement the railway component through SLR, a department under the ministry and headed by \nthe general manager. SLPA, the implementing agency for the port component, was established \nas a statutory authority with an independent legal status under the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act, \n1979. \n \n21.  Institutional capacity. Except for SLR, all executing and implementing agencies have \nsufficient  capacity  and past  experience  to  recruit  consultants  and  administer  contracts. To \nsupport SLR in project implementation, ADB has provided SLR with project preparatory TA \nunder the Colombo Suburban Railway Project, which is currently being processed (footnote 4). \n \n22.  Financial management. A financial management assessment was carried out for RDA, \nSLR, and SLPA. RDA and SLPA have prior experience implementing ADB-funded projects, and \nsatisfactory capacity in project financial accounting and in ADB disbursement procedures. All \nthree agencies have project accounting and finance teams with suitably qualified accountants. \nThe three implementation units will establish and maintain separate records and accounts to \ntrack  the  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  for  the  project  preparatory \nfacility, to ensure an adequate audit trail. The government\u2019s Auditor General\u2019s Department will \n ", "7 \nannually  audit  the  facility  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  following  international \nauditing standards. \n \n23.  Procurement and anticorruption measures. Only consulting services will be procured \nunder the facility, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The Bribery Act, 1954 (as amended from time to time); the Declaration of \nAssets and Liabilities Act, 1975; and the Permanent Commission to Investigate Allegations of \nBribery and Corruption Act, 1994 provide the legal basis to deal with bribery and corruption. The \nauditor general monitors procurement activities. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  all  executing  and \nimplementing agencies. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  The facility is not expected to have any impact on gender and social dimensions. Follow-\non transport projects will be prepared in compliance with ADB's Handbook on Poverty and \nSocial Analysis: A Working Document.12 Gender, labor, HIV/AIDS, and other social risks related \nto follow-on transport projects will be assessed, and a mitigation plan will be prepared to \nmanage those issues. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  The proposed facility will support the development of environmentally and socially viable \ninvestment projects. Because it is focused on preparing investment projects and will not involve \nconstruction work, the facility is not expected to have any adverse social and environmental \nconsequences. The facility is categorized as C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples. Follow-on transport projects will be assessed for safeguards in accordance \nwith ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government guidelines, regulations, and \npolicies.  During  the  feasibility  studies,  the  consultants  will  prepare  environmental  impact \nassessments  or  initial  environmental  examinations  as  applicable,  including  environmental \nmanagement plans and climate risk and vulnerability assessments, for the selected transport \nprojects. Similarly, resettlement planning, indigenous peoples planning, and gender analyses \nwill be done during this stage. Capacity building on safeguard implementation and coordination \nwill be carried out as required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n26.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.13 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nGovernment delays in the release of  The Asian Development Bank will finance 88.1% of the total \ncounterpart funds  expenditure.
