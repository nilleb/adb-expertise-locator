This  practice  generates  a \ntemporary \nsubstantial negative carry, or rate of return, discourages the \ndevelopment  of  robust  cash  management  at  the  Bureau  of \nthe Treasury, and has led to a critical shortage of short-term \ntreasury bills. \n \nAn  agency  of  the  Department  of  Finance  which,  under \nExecutive Order No. 449, acts as the principal custodian of \nthe financial assets of the Government of the Philippines and \nits  agencies  and  instrumentalities.  The  Treasury\u2019s  official \nduties can be found at \nhttp://www.treasury.gov.ph/aboutbtr/mission_main.html.  \n \nIn finance,  the  duration  of  a  financial  asset  that  consists  of \nfixed cash flows (e.g., a bond) is the weighted average time \nuntil repayment. When an asset is considered as a function \nof yield, duration also measures the price sensitivity to yield, \nthe  rate  of  change  of  price  with  respect  to  yield,  or  the \npercentage change in price for a parallel shift in yields.  \n \nAn essential  tool for government  cash  management, this  is \ncritical for  ensuring  that (i)  all  tax  and nontax  revenues  are \ncollected,  and  payments  are  made  correctly  in  a  timely \nmanner;  and  (ii)  government  cash  balances  are  optimally \nmanaged to reduce borrowing costs (or to maximize returns \non surplus cash). This is achieved by establishing a unified \nstructure of government bank accounts via a treasury single \naccount system. \n \nA broker\u2013dealer firm that accepts the risk of holding a certain \nnumber of shares of a particular security in order to facilitate \ntrading  in  that  security.  Each  market  maker  competes  for \ncustomer order flow by displaying buy and sell quotations for \na guaranteed number of shares. Once an order is received, \nthe market maker immediately sells from its own inventory, or \nseeks an offsetting order. This process takes place in mere \nseconds. \n \nA set of preapproved financial institutions, which all bid for the \nright  to  participate  in  primary  auctions  of  government \nsecurities. Primary dealers are responsible for purchasing the \nmajority  of  government  securities  at  auction  and  then \nredistributing them to their clients, creating the initial market \nin the process. These institutions must meet certain liquidity \nand quality requirements. Specific privileges typically include \nactively  participating \nissuance \nprograms,  providing  liquidity  by  quoting  effective  two-way \n\nin  primary  government \n\n\f \n\nfor \n\nto  both \n\nfacilitate  and  compensate \n\nprices  for  government  securities  (sales  and  repurchase \nagreements)  under  all  market  conditions,  providing  market \nfeedback to the monetary authorities, and contributing to the \ndevelopment  of  the  capital  market.  Privileges  are  often \nthese \ngranted \nresponsibilities  and  include  exclusive  access  to  primary \nauctions of government securities (sometimes coupled with a \nhigher  noncompetitive  tender  limit  and  overall  allocation \nlimit), exclusive access to financing facilities that are used to \nfacilitate  market-making,  and  close  dialogue  with  monetary \nauthorities on the conduct of market-related issues. \n \nA  form  of  short-term  borrowing  for  dealers  in  government \nsecurities.  The  dealer  sells  the  government  securities  to \ninvestors, usually on an overnight basis, with an agreement to \nrepurchase them at a set term for a set purchase price, which \nincludes repurchase interest. For the party selling the security \n(and agreeing to repurchase it in the future), it is a repurchase; \nfor the  party  on the  other  end of the  transaction (buying  the \nsecurity  and  agreeing  to  sell  in  the  future),  it  is  a  reverse \nrepurchase agreement. \n \nA  self-regulatory  organization \nis  a  non-government \norganization  that  has  the  power  to  create  and  enforce \nindustry  regulations  and  standards.  Its  priority  is  to  protect \ninvestors  by  establishing  rules  that  promote  ethics  and \nequality.  Some  examples  of  self-regulatory  organizations \ninclude stock exchanges, the Investment Dealers Association \nof  Canada,  and  the  National  Association  of  Securities \nDealers in the United States. \n \nA  line  that  plots  the  interest rates, at  a  set  point  in time,  of \nbonds  with  equal  credit  quality  but  differing  maturity  dates. \nThe  most  frequently  reported  yield  curve  compares  the  \n3-month, 2-year, 5-year, and 30-year United States Treasury \ndebt. This yield curve is used as a benchmark for pricing all \nother  debts  in the  market,  such  as mortgage  rates  or  bank \nlending  rates. The  curve is  also used to predict changes  in \neconomic output and growth. \n \n \n\nNOTE \n\n \n\u2013 \n\n \n\u2013 \n\n \n\u2013 \n\n \n\nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars. \n\n \nrepurchase \nagreement \n(\u201crepo\u201d) \n\n \nself-regulatory \norganization \n\n \nyield curve \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n\nCountry Director \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n\n \nPeer reviewer \n\n \n\nS.

The program \nwill  deepen  the  capital  market  through  a  series  of  sequenced  reforms  designed  to  \n(i)  further  develop  the  government  bond  market,  (ii)  encourage  growth  in  domestic  long-term \nsavings,  and  (iii)  ease  barriers  to  entry  to  diversify  and  broaden  available  funding  sources. \nSubprogram  2  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2017\u20132019  for  the \nPhilippines.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nThe programmatic approach and budget support. ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved \n3. \nthe  programmatic  approach  and  loan  for  subprogram  1  on  26  November  2015.  The  program \nincluded  two  subprograms  and  focused  on  developing  the  domestic  capital  market  to  provide \nlong-term finance to support the government\u2019s infrastructure agenda. Utilizing strong diagnostics \nas  its  base,  the  programmatic  approach  initially  concentrated  on  improving  efficiencies, \nstrengthening  capacity,  and  providing  an  enabling  environment  for  the  more  complex  and \nsubstantive reforms to come. Subprogram 2 implements these initiatives, thus providing a more \nstable and reliable yield curve, increased long-term savings and finance, and a greater diversity \nof  participants  in  the  domestic  bond  market.  The  inclusion  of  a  post-program  partnership \nframework (P3F), 2017\u20132021 continues ADB\u2019s engagement utilizing TA (para. 24). By addressing \nlong-standing constraints in the wholesale finance market, ADB can now pivot its support toward \nincreasing  financial  inclusion  with  a  focus  on  improving  poor  households\u2019  access  to  finance, \nfinancial literacy, and consumer protection. The use of a programmatic approach with a policy-\nbased loan and TA aligns ADB\u2019s support with the government\u2019s reform program while providing \nincentives and capacity to complete the reforms.  \n \nThe  development  problem.  The  Philippine  Development  Plan  (PDP),  2017\u20132022 \n4. \ncontinues the government\u2019s emphasis on inclusive growth. Under the PDP, the government has \nset a strategic target to reach upper-middle-income status by 2022.3 It has also targeted gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth of 7%\u20138% per year, in real terms, with GDP per capita increasing \nfrom $3,550 in 2015 to $5,000 by 2022. In addition, the government has targeted a decline in the \nnational poverty rate from 21.6% in 2015 to 14.0% in 2022, and from 30% to 20% in rural areas \nover the same timeframe. To accomplish these goals, a primary emphasis has again been placed \non investment and infrastructure. However, the competitiveness of infrastructure in the Philippines \nstill ranks very low worldwide\u2014112th out of 138 in 2016\u20132017 compared to 98th out of 144 in \n2012\u20132013\u2014with  inadequate  infrastructure  ranked  as  the  second  most  problematic  factor  for \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n3  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017. Philippine Development Plan, \n\n2017\u20132022. Manila. http://pdp.neda.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PDP-2017-2022-04-24-2017.pdf. \n\n \n\n\f \n2 \n\n \n\ndoing  business  in  the  country. 4  To  address  this  deficit,  the  government  plans  to  increase \nexpenditure  on  infrastructure  significantly  relative  to  the  previous  PDP.  Public  spending  on \ninfrastructure as a share of GDP is expected to increase from 5.1% in 2016 to 7.4% by 2022, or \napproximately  $14.5  billion  annually.  A  diversified  funding  mix  will  be  utilized,  including \ngovernment financing, private capital, and official development assistance.5  \n \n5. \nTo achieve these goals, the financial sector must now absorb higher levels of long-tenor \ngovernment  debt  and  private  sector  debt  capital  without  generating  a  significant  increase  in \nborrowing  costs.  In  particular,  the  government  recognizes  the  need  to  channel  more  private \nsavings  into  bankable  infrastructure  investments  through  the  domestic  financial  markets. 6 \nHowever, the capacity of the domestic financial market remains limited. The size of the Philippine \nbond market as a share of GDP remains small, at 27% relative to the average of 68% in emerging \nEast Asia. The government bond market itself is underdeveloped and exhibits low liquidity, which \nreduces its attractiveness. Bid\u2013offer spreads average 4.6 basis points, compared to the emerging \nEast  Asia  average  of  3.8  basis  points.  The  nonbank  finance  sector  represents  an  alternative \nsource of private capital for infrastructure. Outstanding corporate bonds have reached an all-time \nhigh of 6.2% of GDP. The lapse of an exemption to the banking sector\u2019s single-borrower limit for \ninfrastructure at the end of 2016 has intensified interest in the capital market. Nevertheless, more \nneeds to be done, as the size of the corporate bond market lags well behind regional averages. \nInsurance  premiums  are  approaching  2%  of  GDP  but  are  still  less  than half  the  level  in  more \nadvanced markets such as Thailand (5.53%), Malaysia (4.30%), and Singapore (6.06%).  \n \n6. \nBinding  constraints.  The government  recognizes  the  challenges  it  faces  in  improving \nfinancial intermediation in the economy, including the need to (i) strengthen the management of \nin  government  bond  auctions,  \nincreased  participation \ntreasury  operations  and  ensure \n(ii)  encourage  the  development  of  long-term  contractual  savings  and  investment  products  to \nchannel funds to infrastructure, and (iii) diversify the investor base in terms of participants and \nbusiness models (paras. 7\u20139). \n\n \n7. \nIncreasing expectations for the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) to fund infrastructure with \ngovernment  debt  directly  will  be  difficult  to  meet  in  the  longer  term.  There  are  two  primary \nconstraints.  First,  the  BTr  has  not  yet  institutionalized  reforms  to  strengthen  cash,  investment, \nand  risk  management.  Thus,  a  compensating  bond  sinking  fund,  consisting  of  government \nsecurities and liquid assets (see glossary), is still being maintained to ensure cash is adequate to \nmeet maturing obligations. While the fund\u2019s balance has declined, total holdings still exceed P700 \nbillion and financing costs exceed revenue (negative carry) by approximately P17 billion per year. \nSupporting financial infrastructure must be modernized and inefficiencies arising from the bond \nsinking fund must be addressed. Second, the government must ensure significant and sustained \nparticipation in primary government bond auctions. The current Government Eligible Securities \nDealers  (GSED)  system  does  not  impose  responsibilities  and  provides  few  incentives  to \nparticipate. Efforts to defragment the government bond market by building a limited number of \ndeep and liquid issues must continue, which will improve liquidity and increase the reliability of \nthe yield curve as a price-setting tool. Dealers must be also provided with the tools to manage \nrisks arising from market making. \n \n\n                                                \n4  World Economic Forum. 2012. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2012\u20132013. Geneva; World Economic Forum. \n\n2016. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2016\u20132017. Geneva. \n\n5  Under the PDP, the national budget devoted to infrastructure expenditure is expected to increase from 3.5% to 5.7% \n\nof GDP by 2022, and resulting GDP growth is estimated to be 1.5\u20137.0 percentage points higher. \n\n6  An ADB staff \u201chigh-side\u201d estimate indicates that untapped private capital could be sufficient to meet 4\u20135 years of \n\ninfrastructure expenditure at an annual rate of 6% of GDP. \n\n \n\n\fLegislative  changes,  financial  infrastructure  upgrades,  and  reduced  friction  costs  have \n8. \nincreased  the  availability  of  both  long-term  savings  and  finance.  Nevertheless,  development \nconstraints remain. First, the government has not yet provided detailed implementation guidelines \nto support recent legislative initiatives (e.g., the revised insurance code and the law establishing \nthe Personal Equity Retirement Account [PERA]). New products and services, while authorized, \nhave  not  yet  been  provided  with  an  enabling  environment  (e.g.,  repurchase  agreements  and \nproject  bonds).  For  example,  the  contractual  savings  sector  exhibits  elevated  risk  due  to  a \nsignificant mismatch between the duration of its liabilities and the far shorter duration of its assets. \nProviding incentives to close this mismatch will both reduce risk and increase the sector\u2019s appetite \nfor long-term financial instruments, such as infrastructure bonds. Recent efforts to launch a tax-\ndeferred  long-term  retirement  savings  account  must  be  completed,  and  initiatives  to  authorize \nadditional  modalities  of  long-term  finance  must  continue.  Second,  legal,  operational,  and  cost \ndistortions  restrain  the  development  of  the  nonbank  finance  sector  and  inhibit  innovation. \nForemost,  taxation  across  subsectors  has  not  been  harmonized,  regulatory  constraints \ndiscourage alternative trading strategies, and associated costs are high.  \n\n \nThe finance sector is not adequately diversified. More needs to be done to encourage the \n9. \nentry of foreign financial institutions to stimulate additional demand for the increased issuance of \nlocal currency long-term debt. In addition, foreign financial institutions can (i) introduce different \nbusiness models, which rely more heavily on investment banking as opposed to interest income; \n(ii)  accelerate knowledge  transfer (such  as  project finance);  and (iii)  provide  counterparties for \nhedging  transactions.  Moreover,  the  government  should  strengthen  governance  within  the \nfinancial markets to ensure competitive parity and guard against excesses, which often arise in \nhigh-growth scenarios coupled with increased debt issuance.  \n \n10. \nThe government\u2019s reform agenda. Under the PDP, the government plans to increase \npublic spending on infrastructure to as high as 7.4% of GDP by 2022 (para. 4). To finance this \nincrease, the government will (i) increase public spending, (ii) promote public\u2013private partnerships \n(PPPs), and (iii) develop the capital market to provide long-term finance. The government will also \nmanage the  debt  portfolio and borrowing  mix  program  proactively  to increase fiscal  space. To \ndevelop the capital market, the central bank will refine its interest rate corridor mechanism to align \nmarket  and  policy  rates,  establishing  a  foundation  for  the  short  end  of  the  yield  curve.  The \ngovernment  will  also  implement  an  issuance  program  to  maintain  liquid  benchmark  securities, \nthereby establishing a reliable domestic yield curve. Complimentary reforms will strengthen the \nGovernment Securities Eligible Dealer (GSED) system to establish a market-making function to \nboost trading activity and liquidity. A repurchase agreement (\u201crepo\u201d) for domestic securities will \nbe  launched,  and  upgrades  to the  financial  market  infrastructure  will  promote  efficiency  in  the \ntrading and settlement of securities. \n \n11. \nADB  experience.  ADB  has  supported  finance  sector  reforms  with  five  programmatic-\napproach, policy-based loans and substantial TA (Figure 1). ADB initially focused on the equity \nmarket and encouraged consolidation, self-regulation, and enhanced transparency. Responding \nto the 1997 financial crisis, ADB supported the government\u2019s efforts to strengthen governance, \nimprove the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), implement investor protections, and \ndevelop an anti-money laundering function. Beginning in 2005, ADB launched an effort to support \ndevelopment  of  the  fixed  income  market  but  these  efforts  were  overtaken  by  the  2008  global \nfinancial  crisis  which  necessitated  a  revised  focus  on  financial  stability.  Nevertheless,  reforms \nharmonized reporting and disclosure practices with international standards, improved settlement \nand payment systems, and strengthened regulatory capabilities. Based on lessons learned (para. \n12), ADB has instituted a highly coordinated approach to guide its programmatic support.  This \nprogram has re-emphasized the fundamentals of capital market development beginning with the \n\n \n3 \n\n \n\n\fmoney and government debt markets. Concurrent with these efforts, ADB will continue to support \nthe  issuance  of  local  currency  project  bonds.  Recognizing  that  inclusive  finance  and  finance \nsector development are mutually reinforcing, ADB will also launch a dedicated financial inclusion \nprogram in 2018 to supplement ADB's PPP and youth employment programs. 7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12. \nLessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  engagement  helped  inform  the  program  by \nhighlighting  key  lessons  learned.  First,  success  in  developing  a  local  currency  bond  market \ndepends  on  several  factors,  including (i)  sound macroeconomic  policies (e.g.,  a market-based \nmonetary  framework)  and  debt  management  strategies;  (ii)  a  diversified  investor  base;  (iii)  a \nsound legal framework; and (iv) modern, reliable, and efficient infrastructure.8 Seen through this \nframework,  the  credit  rating  upgrades  and  the  recent  launch  of  an  interest  rate  corridor \nmechanism by the central bank have together provided a strong foundation for developing the \ndomestic capital market. Second, finance sector reforms are complex, have a medium- to long-\nterm gestation period, and require proper sequencing.9 In retrospect, ADB\u2019s early engagement in \nthe  equity  market  delayed  reforms  to  the  fixed-income market  that  would  have  integrated  and \nmodernized the market in step with the wider financial market and international standards. Third, \nprograms should exhibit sufficient flexibility to accommodate a medium- to long-term development \nhorizon and changes in the addenda of reform champions. Fourth, capital market development is \na prerequisite for  expanding  the financial  inclusion  of  poor  households  beyond microcredit.  As \nempirical  evidence  shows  that  financial  exclusion  of  the  poor  contributes  to  persistently  high \nincome inequality, ADB\u2019s assistance will increasingly focus on financial inclusion.  \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. ADB\u2019s TA support to \nsubprogram 2 has produced impressive results. To institutionalize reforms under subprogram 1, \nthe  BTr  has  reconstituted  divisions  covering  cash,  investment,  and  risk  management.

ADB  also \nprovided  direct  support  to  upgrade  the  BTr\u2019s  infrastructure,  including  its  registry  of  scripless \nsecurities. This is the first upgrade in over 20 years and will significantly modernize finance sector \ninfrastructure  in  the  Philippines. 10 In  addition,  ADB  TA  supported  the  adoption  of  risk-based \ncapital by the insurance sector, providing a direct incentive for the purchase of four infrastructure \nbonds  under  subprogram  2. 11  ADB  provided  the  infrastructure  to  launch  the  PERA,  and  is \nsupporting  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  reform  the  tax  regime,  including  those  applied  to  the \nfinance sector.12 Finally, ADB supported the SEC\u2019s efforts to implement the corporate governance \nroad map, and to strengthen the definition of an independent director.13 \n \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.

ADB,  the  United  States  Treasury,  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  are \ncurrently  facilitating  an  initiative  to  develop  the  Philippines\u2019  first  government-led  capital  market \ndevelopment  strategy.  Otherwise,  the  existing  donor  demarcation  remains.  The  United  States \nTreasury  is  providing  resident  advisors  to  strengthen  the  GSED  system  and  develop  an \ninfrastructure bond market. ADB is providing support to modernize infrastructure, strengthen cash \nmanagement,  introduce  a  repurchase  market,  and  develop  capacity.  The  IMF  is  providing \nintermittent follow-up support and advice to strengthen the conduct of monetary policy.  \n \nEconomic  impact  of the program. The  program  has  several  important  impacts.  First, \n15. \nthe BTr\u2019s more efficient management of liquid assets has yielded additional fiscal savings over \nsubprogram  1.  Second,  reforms  to  treasury  operations  and  the  government  bond  market  are \nexpected  to  not  only  deepen  the  bond  market  but  also produce  efficiencies  that  will  lower  the \noverall cost of capital in the Philippines. Third, liberalized foreign entry into the banking system is \nexpected to produce efficiencies and more competitive pricing (para. 28). \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n \n16. \nThe program\u2019s impact is meeting the government\u2019s targeted investment rate. The outcome \nwill  be  a  deeper  nonbank  finance  sector  developed.  At  the  program\u2019s  inception  in  2015,  the \ngovernment agreed to accomplish nine prior expected actions and 13 policy milestones as the \nbasis  for  subprogram  2. 15 All  nine  policy  triggers  have  been  fully  accomplished.  During  the \nprocessing  of  subprogram  2,  a  new  prior  action  reflecting  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to \nliberalize  foreign  entry  to  the  finance  sector  was  added.  Two  policy  milestones  related  to  the \ndevelopment of unregistered bonds and the ongoing effort to harmonize finance sector taxes were \nshifted  to  the  post-program  partnership  framework  (P3F)  at  the  government\u2019s  request.

The changes  in  the  policy \nmatrix and DMF are reflected in the revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).16 \n \nC. \n \n17. \nOutput  1:  Liquidity  in  the  government  bond  market  enhanced.  This  output  will \nincrease  efficiencies  to  provide  additional  direct  funding  for  infrastructure,  and  will  provide  a \nfoundation for developing the government bond market, itself a foundation of wider capital market \ndevelopment.  Accomplishments  under  subprogram  2 \nthe  BTr \ninstitutionalized  improvements  in  cash  management  achieved  under  subprogram  1  by \nreconstituting  a  cash  management  committee  and  implementing  enhanced  reporting,  formal \npolicies and targets, and a standardized reporting template. The BTr also reconstituted a formal \ninvestment management process to improve the returns on its invested cash balances. Like the \ncash  management  committee,  the  investment  management  committee  is  now  supported  by  a \ndedicated staff, operations manuals, performance targets, risk limits, and a standardized reporting \nprotocol.    Finally,  the  BTr  further  reduced  the  negative  cost  of  carry  associated  with  the  bond \nsinking fund by reducing the fund\u2019s size to cover only 2 years of debt service, as opposed to the \noriginal  20%  of  all  outstanding  debt.  All  together,  these  reforms  achieved  or  preserved \napproximately P5 billion\u2013P7 billion in annual fiscal savings over the life of the reforms. \n \n18. \nThe  rapid  growth  of  the  corporate  bond  market  over  the  past  3  years  is  encouraging. \nHowever, much more needs to be done to develop the local currency government bond market \nto  reduce  the  economy\u2019s  dependence  of  bank-dominated  financing  and  to  match  long-term \nfinance  with  long-term  funding.  To  support  increased  debt  issuance,  and  to  provide  a  term \nstructure  of  interest  rates,  the  government  launched  an  initiative  to  ensure  significant  and \nconsistent  participation  in  primary  auctions.  An  evaluation  system  will  rank  the  participating \nGSED\u2019s  (primary  dealers)  based  on  participation  and  activity  levels.  The  BTr  designed  a  \n\u201ctop-ranked dealer\u201d program, which will include responsibilities and, more importantly, incentives, \nincluding  exclusive  market  feedback  discussions  with  the  BTr  and  a  government  securities \nlending program. Moreover, the BTr continued to defragment the government securities market, \nand increase its liquidity by reducing the number of outstanding issues to 85 from 118 at the end \nof subprogram 1 and 204 at the inception of the program. To improve liquidity in the government \nbond  market further,  support  market making,  and encourage  alternative  trading  strategies,  the \nMoney  Market  Association  of  the  Philippines  has  formally  applied  to  the  SEC  to  establish  a  \nself-regulatory organization to govern the repurchase market.  \n \n19. \nTo modernize its operations, the BTr institutionalized risk management by operationalizing \nfour previously authorized divisions (e.g., the risk management, fund management, capital market \nstrategy and planning, and debt strategy and planning divisions).  Operations manuals, risk limits \nand  structures,  and  exception  reporting  have  been  completed  and  implemented.  In  addition, \ninternal treasury risk management systems and the registry of scripless securities were replaced \nwith modern, off-the-shelf vendor products, representing the first such upgrade in approximately \n20 years. The risk management system will facilitate the establishment and monitoring of fiscal \nrisk limits. The new scripless registry will eliminate redundancies and foster greater efficiencies in \nthe trading and settlement of securities, and will also lead to the more effective implementation of \nprior reforms such as trading across the tax and tax-exempt sectors. \n\n                                                \n16 Summary  Assessment  of  Policy  Actions  under  Subprogram  2  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 13). \n\n \n\n\fOutput 2: Long-term savings and investment products encouraged. This output will \n20. \nincrease  the  supply  and  demand  of  long-term  investment  products.  Accomplishments  under \nsubprogram  2  include  the  following.  The  Insurance  Commission  has  encouraged  insurance \ncompanies to consolidate through increased capital standards, which will strengthen the sector\u2019s \nfinancial footing  and  create  economies  of scale. The  Insurance  Commission  has  also  adopted \nrisk-based capital to provide economic incentives to the insurance sector to hold long-duration \nassets to  match  their  long-duration  liabilities.  Moreover,  the Insurance Commission  has  begun \nauthorizing insurance companies to purchase infrastructure bonds and PPP-related debt under \nthe revised Insurance Code (a reform under subprogram 1.) To date, insurance companies have \nbeen authorized to purchase debt issued by two separate projects supporting the construction of \nschools (PPP) and a power plant. The government launched the PERA to the public, and the SEC \nfacilitated the introduction of additional fundraising channels by approving the listing rules for PPP \ncompanies of the Philippine Stock Exchange.  \n\n \n21. \nAt  the  same  time,  the  government  has  moved  to  reduce  costs  and  improve  the  legal \nframework. The SEC submitted for congressional approval the revised Corporation Code, which \nincludes provisions to provide corporations with perpetual existence and enable the creation of \n\u201cone-person\u201d corporations to extend the benefits and protections of the corporate legal structure \nto  small  businesses.  To  accommodate  foreign  strategic  investors,  the  revised  code  has \nauthorized board participation via remote access, and poll voting will be mandated at the request \nof  shareholders.  The  legislation  also  strengthens  protections  against  anticompetitive  behavior, \nand allows the SEC to order the dissolution of any corporation found to be engaged in fraudulent \npractices, tax evasion, or corruption. The proposed code also authorizes the SEC to retain fees, \nfines, and other charges to fund modernization efforts and attract highly skilled technical staff by \nincreasing staff salaries to mirror the private sector more closely.    \n\n \n22. \nOutput  3:  Market  depth  and  diversity  increased.  This  output  will  encourage  the \nintroduction of varied business models and products by liberalizing entry to the finance sector and \nstrengthening  its  governance.  Accomplishments  under  subprogram  2  include  the  following. \nSupported by legal reforms enacted under subprogram 1, the government has authorized foreign \nfinancial institutions (nine banks and one insurance company) to establish domestic subsidiaries \nin the Philippines.  Unlike previously authorized branches, these banks will enjoy full access to \nthe  domestic  market  and  can  establish  branches  at  will.  The  government  also  strengthened \ncorporate  governance  by  adopting  a  blueprint  covering  2016\u20132020  that  formally  confirms  the \ngovernment\u2019s intent to adopt global corporate governance practices. The blueprint identifies gaps, \ncommunicates ongoing corrective measures, and establishes a phased implementation schedule. \nThe blueprint also incorporates the recommendations of the Asian Roundtable 2003 White Paper \non  Corporate  Governance  which  cover  increased  awareness,  active  enforcement,  improved \ndisclosures, capacity development, and protections for minority shareholders.17   \n\n \nUnder the blueprint, the SEC promulgated a new Code of Corporate Governance based \n23. \non  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development\u2019s  principles.  The  code \nincorporates  the  concepts  of  \u201ccomply  or  explain\u201d  and  proportionality,  and  covers  board \nresponsibility, transparency, internal controls, relationships, and duties to shareholders. The code \nalso  requires  the  following  four  committees:  audit,  corporate  governance,  risk  oversight,  and \nrelated party transactions. At least three directors must be independent. Independent directors \nare now limited to a maximum cumulative term of 9 years and can hold no more than five outside \ndirectorships. This change brings the Philippines in line with regional peers such as Malaysia and \nSingapore. By 2015, one quarter of the 609 independent directors of publicly listed companies in \n\n                                                \n17 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2003.

Paris.  \n\n \n7 \n\n \n\n\f \n8 \n\n \n\nthe Philippines had served more than 10 years, and 18 had served for 20 years consecutively. \nThe government  also  identified  specific revisions to the  Securities Regulation Code  needed to \nenable  the  government  to  join  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions\u2019 \nmultilateral memorandum of understanding (MMOU). These changes include granting the SEC \nsubpoena powers, and the power to respond directly to requests for information. \n\n \n24. \nPost-program  partnership  framework.  While  nonbinding,  the  P3F  provides  for  a \nstructured  dialogue  over  the  medium  term  between  ADB  and  the  government,  as  well  as  a \nframework for continuing TA support. Under this framework, ADB will support the government\u2019s \nefforts to develop a capital market blueprint and to provide an enabling environment. The BTr will \nassume greater administrative control over the wholesale government bond market, improve its \noperations, and strengthen risk management. The \u201ctop-ranked dealer\u201d program will be formalized \nand the development of a working repurchase market is anticipated within this timeframe. The \nSEC  will  continue  pursuing  legislative  and  regulatory  changes,  including  amendments  to  the \nSecurities Regulation Code and the possible adoption of a collective investment schemes law. \nThe government will remove tax distortions that favor bank lending over capital markets, introduce \nadditional long-term financing instruments, and launch the PERA to the wider market. Finally, the \ngovernment will process revisions to the legal framework to join the International Organization of \nSecurities  Commissions\u2019  MMOU.  Participation  in  the  MMOU  will  increase  cross-border \ninvestments and strengthen the quality of capital market supervision. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a 3-year grace \nperiod, annuity method with 30% discount, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement (the \naverage  maturity  is  12.1  years).  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). The loan size is based on the \nPhilippines\u2019  financing  needs,  the  development  impact  of  the  policy  reform  package,  and \ndevelopment spending arising from the reform. In 2017, the government\u2019s total gross borrowing \nrequirement is estimated at $12.6 billion, a fifth of which will be from foreign borrowing. The foreign \nborrowing will comprise government bonds estimated at $477.1 million, and official development \nassistance in the form of program loans estimated at $1.40 billion. \n \nE. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n26. \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) is the executing agency, and the BTr and SEC are the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  implementation  period  is  July  2015\u2013June  2017.  A  steering \ncommittee  chaired  by  the  DOF  with  the  implementing  agencies  as  members  will  oversee  the \nprogram\u2019s implementation.18\n The steering committee will meet semiannually and, if needed, on \nan ad hoc basis to monitor the continuing implementation of reforms under the P3F.  \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n27.      The government asked ADB to provide transaction TA to support reforms specified under \nthe program\u2019s P3F. The TA will have the same impact and outcome, and will contain two outputs. \nThe first will prepare the government\u2019s first detailed implementation plan covering 2017\u20132022 to \n                                                \n18 The  Insurance  Commission  and  the  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  will  be  committee  members,  reflecting  ADB\u2019s \nongoing TA to each and the role of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in supporting financial inclusion and literacy. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fguide the stakeholders\u2019 reform priorities, and the second will provide support to complete specific \nkey technical reforms called for in the P3F and necessary to develop a well-functioning domestic \ncurrency bond market. The BTr will be the executing agency, and the BTr and SEC will be the \nimplementing agencies. The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The TA will \nbe implemented from November 2017 to November 2020, and will include a total of 20 person-\nmonths  of  consulting  services.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB \nProcurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017).19 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \nA growing body of empirical research produces a remarkably consistent narrative, namely, \nthat finance sector development exerts a first-order impact on long-run economic growth.20 On a \nproject-specific  level,  the  program  generates  recurrent  quantifiable  benefits  with  a  net  present \nvalue of $437 million, supplementing the $1.2 billion in net benefits achieved under subprogram \n1. These benefits reflect the continuity of reforms through the programmatic approach, but still far \nexceed the program\u2019s estimated costs. The present value of gross benefits is $653 million accrued \nprimarily  from  enhancements  to  the  primary  and  secondary  government  bond  markets.  In \naddition,  foreign  entry  into  the  banking  sector  is  expected  to  produce  significant  efficiencies \nthrough increased competition, more competitive pricing, and a wider array of business models. \nThe present value of costs is approximately $216 million, representing forgone tax revenue, an \nincrease in the SEC\u2019s budget, and administrative and compliance expenses.21 \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n \n29. \nThe government continues to strengthen its public financial management (PFM). The 2017 \nPublic  Expenditure  and Financial  Accountability assessment  confirmed that  three  of the  seven \ncore  areas  (transparency,  policy-based  budgeting,  and  asset-liability  management)  have \nimproved  and are  now  considered  strong.22 Areas of  weakness  identified  in the  assessment\u2014\nbudget credibility, predictability and control in budget execution, and external scrutiny and audit\u2014\nare being actively addressed. Moreover, the proposed Public Financial Accountability Act will help \nto enforce accountability in PFM by strengthening congressional control and oversight, requiring \nan  integrated  PFM  system,  and  increasing  budget  transparency  and  participation.  The \ngovernment  continues  to  pursue  a  comprehensive,  results-based  anticorruption  plan,  and  to \nincrease the capacity of the Office of the Ombudsman and the justice sector. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC. \n \n30. \nFinance sector development helps reduce poverty through at least three channels: higher \neconomic  growth,  finance  sector  inclusiveness,  and  finance  sector  stability.  The  program \ncontributes  to  poverty  reduction  by  increasing  fiscal  space  for  social  expenditures,  and  by \nencouraging  the  provision  of  long-term,  peso-denominated  financing  to  support  infrastructure \ndevelopment. Increased infrastructure investment will lead to increased employment and, in turn, \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n19  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20   Ross  Levine,  Sara  Zervos,  The  American  Economic  Review,  Volume  88,  No.  3  (June  1998)  pp.  637-558,  and  \n\n Marco Arena 2008.

While  the  program  does  not  focus  directly  on  financial \ninclusion,  reforms  to  encourage  retirement  savings  and  policy  improvements  in  the  insurance \nsector provide an entry point for ADB\u2019s planned future engagement in this area.23 \n \nD. \n \n31. \nThe program will not entail any involuntary resettlement or affect indigenous people or the \nenvironment. It is classified as category C for all safeguards categories (involuntary resettlement, \nimpact on indigenous people, and environmental impact).  \n \nE. \n \nThe program has four substantial risks.24 National risks include weaknesses in the PFM \n32. \nsystem  and  corruption.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  the  government,  with  the  support  of  ADB  and \nother development partners in the Philippines Development Forum, has strengthened the budget \nreview process, reduced the number and size of special purpose funds, and mandated increased \ntransparency as a precondition to accessing public funds. To reduce corruption risks, the Good \nGovernance  and  Anti-Corruption  Cabinet  Cluster  of \nimplemented  a \ncomprehensive  and  results-based  anticorruption  action  plan.
