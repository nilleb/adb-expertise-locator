A summary of the environmental impact assessment \nAssessment  was circulated to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of \nDirectors and posted on the ADB website on 14 October 2009. \n   \nProject Description  The project is located in the northwest of Heilongjiang province. It \nwill  improve  the  transport  capacity  of  the  province's  East\u2013West \n2 corridor (Qiangfeng Farm\u2013Nenjiang) by completing a key missing \nsection between Yichun and Wudalianchi, improving the capacity of \nthe existing road section between Longzhen and Nenjiang, and \nconnecting these improved road sections to the other parts of the \nroad network. This will complete the Yichun\u2013Wudalianchi\u2013Harbin \ntourism loop connecting prominent tourism destinations for forest \ntourism and geological scenery, and the provincial capital city.  \nBy optimizing the road alignment and shortening the travel distance \nby 400 km, the project will help to develop a more resource-efficient \ntransport  infrastructure  with  significantly  reduced  energy \nconsumption,  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  road  traffic \naccidents. \nThe  project  will  also  improve  road  connectivity  between \nHeilongjiang  and  the  neighboring  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous \nRegion (Inner Mongolia) by constructing a missing link including a \nbridge across the Nen River.  \nIn addition to road construction, the project will help the province \nestablish an improved road asset management system for selecting \nmaintenance  works  on  the  basis  of  their  expected  economic \nreturns.  It  will  support  the  institutionalizing  of  this  system  by \nfinancing a program of priority maintenance works selected using \nthe system. The project will also introduce the use of performance-\nbased maintenance contracts on a pilot basis. \nTo  improve  rural  village  bus  services,  the  project  will  provide \nsupport for reform of the rural village bus route licensing system \nand finance upgrading of 20 bus stations. \n ", "ii   \n  The  project  has  four  components:  component  A,  improving  the \n347.06 km  provincial  road  between  Yichun  and  the  provincial \nborder  with  Inner  Mongolia  including  three  branch  roads; \ncomponent  B,  improving  road  maintenance;  component  C, \nimproving  rural  village  bus  services;  and  component  D, \nstrengthening  of  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  Heilongjiang \nProvincial Transportation Department and other relevant agencies \nby providing consulting services and training. \n   \nRationale  Heilongjiang province needs more efficient transportation to support \neconomic growth, foster domestic and international trade, facilitate \ninterregional  integration,  and  reduce  poverty.  Through  the \nNortheast Region Development Strategy, which is the key theme of \nthe Eleventh Five-Year Plan, the PRC government aims to reduce \ndevelopment  disparities  between  the  northeastern  and  coastal \nregions. Through the project it will complete an important missing \nlink between the northeast and northwest of Heilongjiang province.  \n \nOver  the  past  30  years,  the  government  has  given  priority  to \nexpanding  the  road  network  to  improve  connectivity.  Now  an \nimproved system for maintaining the road asset base is needed. \nThis requires better approaches to the planning, budgeting, and \nexecution of road maintenance works, including the introduction of \nmore effective methods of maintenance contracting. \n \nEfficient  road  transport  services  are  needed  to  realize  the  full \nbenefits  of  road  infrastructure.  In  some  parts  of  Heilongjiang \nprovince,  rural  villages  lack  adequate  bus  services  in  terms  of \navailability, frequency, cost, reliability, and safety. Rural passenger \ntransport services can be improved by introducing more effective \napproaches to licensing and upgrading stations.  \n \nThe project is part of ADB's ongoing policy dialogue in the PRC \ntransport  sector,  which  includes  (i) financing  new  roads  that \nconnect  major  growth  centers,  supported  by  a  system  of  local \nroads;  (ii) developing  and  improving  urban  transport  and  rural \nroads; (iii) promoting road safety; (iv) reducing vehicle emissions \nand raising energy efficiency; (v) improving commercial orientation \nand  efficiency  of  expressway  organizations;  and  (vi) promoting \nsustainable transport.  \n \nThe project is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and \nADB's country partnership strategy for the PRC (2008\u20132010), which \nseek to promote inclusive growth and environmentally sustainable \ntransport.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  more  balanced  economic \ndevelopment in Heilongjiang province. The outcome will be a more \nresource-efficient,  safe,  and  environment-friendly  road  transport \nsystem in Heilongjiang province.  \n   ", "  iii\nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the project is estimated at $998.15 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $28.59 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan \nTotal \nSource  ($ million)    % \nAsian Development Bank   200.00    20.04 \nAgricultural Bank of China    419.70    42.05 \nMinistry of Transport   203.56    20.39 \nHeilongjiang Provincial Government   174.89    17.52 \n   Total    998.15    100.00 \n   \n  A loan of $200,000,000 from ADB's ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe loan and project agreements. \n   \nAllocation and  The  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  by  the  PRC \nRelending Terms  government to the Heilongjiang provincial government (HPG), and \nbe HPG will make them available to the Heilongjiang Provincial \nTransportation  Department  (HPTD)  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan. HPTD will bear the interest \nrate variation and foreign exchange risks.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date  31 December 2014 \n   \nExecuting Agency  HPTD \n   \nImplementation  HPG  has  established  a  project  steering  committee  to  oversee \nArrangements  project  implementation.  HPTD  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation  of  the  project.  HPTD  has  established  a  project \nmanagement  office,  which  will  be  the  implementing  agency \nresponsible for components A, C, and D. Heilongjiang Provincial \nHighway Bureau, through the project implementing unit, will be the \nimplementing agency for component B. \n   \n ", "iv   \nProcurement  Goods and works financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). On 21 April and 25 September 2009, \nADB approved advance contracting. On 24 November 2009, ADB \napproved  retroactive  financing  for  eligible  expenditures  not \nexceeding $40 million incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not \nearlier than a maximum of 12 months before signing of the loan \nagreement.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  22  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services for (i) construction supervision, (ii) road safety \nimprovement,  and  (iii)  road  maintenance  improvement;  and \n15 person-months national consulting services for implementation \nof a pilot project for bus route licensing reform. The consultants will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB approved \nadvance recruitment on 25 September 2009.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The project will help reduce development disparities between the \nBeneficiaries  northeastern  and  coastal  regions  of  the  PRC  to  promote \nharmonized  and  coordinated  development.  In  Heilongjiang \nprovince, improved accessibility between the east and west of the \nprovince  will  provide  better  connections  to  markets  and  social \nservices. The project will directly benefit about 1.7 million people in \nthe three prefectures and five counties and cities along the project \nroads.  This  will  include  passengers,  traders,  manufacturers, \ntransport providers, laborers, the local economy, private sector, and \nadministrators of the transport sector and public security.   \n \nThe project will benefit local people by (i) integrating the existing \nlocal and forest roads with the project roads by building branch \nroads and intersections, and (ii) completing a missing link between \nNenjiang and Inner Mongolia. By completing the Harbin\u2013Yichun\u2013\nWudalianchi  tourism  loop,  the  project  will  bring  new  economic \nopportunities for local forest workers who have lost jobs due to the \nnational policy to preserve forest resources.  \n \nThe  economic  and  social  benefits  of  the  project  will  include \n(i) transport cost and time savings; (ii) road accident cost savings; \n(iii) fuel savings; (iv) improved access to health care and social \nservices; (v) job opportunities; (vi) increased demand locally for \nbuilding  materials,  construction  machinery,  and  transport  during \nconstruction; (vii) increased speed of information flow; (viii) enabling \nenvironment to attract private sector participation; and (ix) reduced \nvehicle emissions.  \n ", "  v\n  The project will help Heilongjiang deliver safer and more convenient \nroad  transport  services  to  the  public  by  (i) applying  information \ncommunication technology to improve regulation, monitoring, and \nresponse to the movement of people and goods on the project \nroads;  (ii)  improving  road  maintenance;  and  (iii)  improving  rural \nvillage bus services. \n \nThe project will improve the province\u2019s public sector management \ncapacity by strengthening institutional and staff capacity in road \nmaintenance management, public transport management, and road \nsafety management by (i) providing expertise, training, systems, \nand  equipment;  (ii)  developing  and/or  amending  the  regulatory \nframework  and  introducing  improved  business  processes;  and \n(iii) implementing  pilot  projects  for  rural  bus  services  and \nperformance-based maintenance contracts.  \n \nThe project is economically and financially justified. Its economic \ninternal rate of return is estimated at 17.79%. The financial rate of \nreturn for the expressway and class I road is 6.17%, which is higher \nthan the real weighted average cost of capital. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Overall, the risks associated with the project are considered low. In \npreparing the project, the financial, environmental, and social risks \nwere assessed, and mitigating measures incorporated. \n \nTo mitigate the financial risk associated with construction and initial \noperation of the expressway, HPTD will provide sufficient funding to \nbalance any shortfall in cash flow during the first year of operation. \n \nAfter implementation of the mitigation measures reflected in the \nenvironmental  management  plan,  the  adverse  environmental \nimpact due to construction will be minor. \n \nTo mitigate social risks, appropriate measures are included in the \nresettlement  plans  and  the  social  development  action  plan. \nImplementation of these plans will be closely monitored by HPG \nand reviewed by ADB. \n \n \n ", "121o  00'E 132o  00'E\nSECOND HEILONGJIANG ROAD NETWORK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nRUSSIAN   FEDERATION\nProvincial Capital\nCity/Town\nCounty\nMohe Highway Port\nB Bus Station\nProposed Project Road Sections\nH ADB--Financed Road\nTahe eilo Loop Line\nn\nHumag River RVeardtiiacal Ll Lininee\nHorizontal Line\nRiver\nProvincial Boundary\n52 o 00'N International Boundary 52 o 00'N\nJiagdaqi River Woduhe Heihe Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nI N N E R     M O N G O L I A n \nNe\nProject Road\n(Yichun--Bei\u2019an)\nProject Road Sunwu\n(Nenjiang--Inner Mongolia) Sunwu Xunke\nNenjiang\nProject Road B Jiayin\n(Bei\u2019P(aLrnoo--njWegcuzthd Reaonlia-a-dNncehnij)iang) Nehe BBBB BLongHzhEeInLONGJIANG Heilong RiverFuyuan\nWudalianchi\nBei'an Qiangfeng Farm\nGanFnuaynu Yi'an BaiqKueadnong BBBBBBBB B Yichun Hegang LuobeiSuibin TFounjingjiang Raohe\nNianzishan Hailun B B\nQiqihar Mingshui Suiling B Tieli B Jiamusi\nLindian\nQinggang Qing'an B Tangyuan Shuangyashan\nR.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Second  Heilongjiang  Road  Network \nDevelopment Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The PRC has achieved rapid economic growth; gross domestic product growth has \nexceeded  9.0%  per  year  since  the  1980s.  Sustained  economic  growth  has  resulted  in  an \nunprecedented expansion of traffic between and within provinces. The economy\u2019s changing \nstructure  and  increasing  diversification  have  altered  the  pattern  of  transport  demand.  The \nmovement of goods and passengers by road, which is more flexible and responsive to market \nneeds than other modes of transport, is increasing rapidly.  \n \n3.  Propelling  the  country\u2019s  robust  growth  and  rapid  poverty  reduction  were  massive \ninvestments in roads. As a result, by the end of 2006, a total of 3.457 million kilometers (km) of \nroads  were  opened  to  traffic;  100%  of  counties,  98.3%  of  townships,  and  86.4%  of \nadministrative villages were connected by roads. At the end of the Tenth Five-Year Plan, the \ntotal length of expressways reached 45,300 km, class I highways 45,300 km, class II highways \n262,700  km,  class  III  highways  354,700  km,  class  IV  highways  1,574  million  km,  and \nunclassified roads 1,174 million km. The government\u2019s policy for road subsector, as reflected in \nthe Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), calls for (i)  construction of 38,000 km of new roads \nto  bring  the  total  length  of  expressways  to  65,000 km;  (ii)   completion  of  the  35,000  km \nNational Trunk Highway System; and (iii) completion of the 7,918 km network1 reflected in the \nWestern Region Development Plan. \n \n4.  Even  though  rural  roads  play  a  significant  role  in  poverty  reduction,  the  rural  road \nnetwork, which accounts for 85% of the country\u2019s total road network, is underdeveloped in both \naccessibility and technical standards. Thus, the 30 million rural poor face significant challenges \nin relation to transport. Many live in isolated villages, thereby restricting their access to basic \ngoods and services. Most rural roads, especially in western PRC, are in poor condition due to \nlimitations  in  design,  construction,  and  inadequate  maintenance;  and  damage  caused  by \noverloaded  vehicles.  The  technical  standards  of  the  roads  are  low:  only  11%  are \nclass III highways or above. Village roads are even worse, with only 2% of class III or above. \nOnly 20% of county roads, 15% of township roads, and 9% of village roads are paved. About \n71% of rural roads are dirt roads that serve many townships and villages. These have no \ndrainage system, making them unsuitable for motorized traffic and impassable during the rainy \nseason, preventing the rural poor from taking advantage of jobs created by economic growth. \nThe  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  assigns  high  priority  to  rural  road  development  to  promote \neconomic growth and reduce poverty in rural areas. At the beginning of 2005, the government \nlaunched a Rural Road Construction Program aiming that by 2010 paved roads will link all \neastern villages, 80% of the central villages, and 90% of western villages. The government \nplans to complete 1.2 million km of rural roads under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. \n \n5.  In  the  past  30  years,  the  government  has  provided  enormous  investment  for  the \nconstruction of national and provincial trunk highway networks. Substantial funds have been \nused for rural road development. However, funding for road maintenance has been inadequate. \n                                                 \n1  7,918 km network includes 7 expressways radiating from Beijing, 9 north\u2013south expressways, and 18 east\u2013west \nexpressways. ", " 2 \nIn  recent  years,  road  development  has  been  funded  mainly  by  domestic  banks,  local \ngovernments and Ministry of Transport grants. Expressways and class I highways are expected \nto cover their operating and maintenance costs and debt service charges from toll revenues. \nDomestic debt has been increasingly used to finance expressways and other road projects, \nrepaid from toll revenues. On 1 January 2009, the State Council introduced a new policy to \nimplement collection of a fuel tax and abolish the collection of road maintenance fees and five \nother transportation fees. The consumption tax levied as part of the fuel price was increased \nfrom CNY0.2 to CNY1.0 per liter for gasoline, and from CNY0.1 to CNY0.8 per liter for diesel. \nRevenues from the fuel tax are expected to be allocated initially to each province in proportion to \ntheir 2007 vehicle maintenance fee revenues.  \n \n6.  In addition to the construction and maintenance of road infrastructure, the improvement \nof transport services for passengers and goods is an important part of improving rural transport. \nIn 2008, the number of passengers traveling by roads reached 1,247.6 billion passenger-km, an \nincrease  of  54.0%  of total  transport  by  all  modes,  while  the  volume  of  goods  transported \nreached 3,286.8 billion ton-km, an increase of 12.3%. The government has been giving priority \nto improving rural passenger transport. By the end of 2008, about 99.2% of townships and \n92.8% of administrative villages had regular bus services. The services are mainly provided by \nprivate  transport  companies  and  based  on  market  needs.  However,  villages  with  fewer \npassengers often lack adequate bus services. Appropriate government policies are needed to \nregulate rural village bus services and improve bus service quality. \n \n7.  The government recognizes the importance of road safety and has been implementing \nvarious initiatives and programs including the National Road Safety Law, approved in 2004. This \nhas resulted in a decrease of the fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles from 10.2 in 2004 to 5.1 in \n2007.2 However, this rate is still relatively high when compared with developed countries.3 \nTherefore, in 2008, the government formulated the National Science and Technology Action \nPlan for Road Traffic Safety to reduce the road traffic fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles to 3\u20134, the \nrate prevailing in other middle-income countries. The PRC design standards are still lacking \nsome components for road safety. The government needs to adopt a more advanced road \nsafety design concept in the engineering design, such as providing clear zones, guiderail end \ntreatment,  and  guiderail  to  bridge  transition.  Good  practices  and  policies  are  needed  for \nenforcing traffic regulation to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads. \n8.  Heilongjiang, a landlocked province in the extreme northeast of the PRC, is bordered by \nthe Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Inner Mongolia) in the west, the Russian Federation in \nthe north and east, and Jilin province in the south. With an area of 454,000 square kilometers \n(km2), it is the sixth largest province, with a population of 38.2 million and per capita gross \ndomestic product of CNY18,478 in 2008. Heilongjiang has fertile land and abundant natural \nresources.  The  province  was  an  industrial  base  before  the  1980s;  its  main  sectors  are \npetroleum, coal, power plant equipment, metallurgy, heavy machinery, steel, timber, and wood. \nTrade plays an important role in the province\u2019s economy; international and domestic demand for \nits products has consistently risen. However, since the 1980s Heilongjiang has fallen behind the \ncoastal provinces. In 1982, its per capita gross domestic product was about the same as that of \nthe coastal provinces (Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang); by 2008, it had dropped to 50%.  \n \n9.  The transport network of Heilongjiang includes railways, highways, waterways, aviation, \nand pipelines. It is centered around Harbin, connecting to regional cities as nodes, and radiating \nto border areas. The road network is relatively underdeveloped. In 2007, only 7.1% of the \n                                                 \n2  J. Scales. 2008. China Road Traffic Safety: The Achievements, the Challenges, and the Way Ahead. World Bank \nWorking Paper Series No. 49562. Washington, DC: World Bank.    \n3  The fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles is 1.2 in Australia, 1.0 in Japan, 1.0 in the United Kingdom, and 1.8 in the \nUnited States. ", "    3\nnetwork consisted of high standard roads (above class II); the national average was 15.5%. The \nprovince has 1,044 km of expressways, 1,435 km of class I highways, 7,443 km of class II \nhighways,  33,207  km  of  class  III  road,  50,883  km  of  class  IV  roads,  and  46,897  km  of \nunclassified roads. The road density of 31 km per hundred km2 is lower than the country\u2019s \naverage of 37.24 km. To support future socioeconomic development, Heilongjiang approved a \n3-year plan for speeding up road development during 2008\u20132010. It is investing CNY90 billion to \ndevelop 2,207 km of expressways, 731 km of class I highways, 3.252 km of class II highways, \nand 60,799 km of rural roads. It aims to provide road access to all administrative villages by the \nend of 2010. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Problems and Constraints \n \n10.  Despite huge investment, the PRC road network still does not provide all-weather access \nto large parts of the country, particularly the poorer inland regions, and is not sufficient to sustain \neconomic growth. Expanding demand for road transport has strained road infrastructure, as \nmanifested  by  missing  links  and  bottlenecks  in  the  network.  The  resulting  high  cost  of \ntransporting goods between inland provinces and ports has been a serious constraint for inland \nprovinces, including Heilongjiang. In Heilongjiang, the road network is concentrated around \nHarbin, and the roads serving the far north, east, and west still need to be improved. Due to lack \nof road network connectivity and the low technical standard of the roads, the transport cost is \nhigh and the access to the remote rural hinterland is one of the main constraints for rural poverty \nreduction. \n \n11.  Natural resources and industrial production in the province are geographically dispersed. \nXiaoxinganling  mountain  provides  a  barrier  to  developing  an  adequate  transport  corridor \nbetween the northeast and northwest part of the province. Sanjiang Plain, a major agricultural \nand coal mining area, is located in the northeast, while Harbin\u2013Daqing\u2013Qiqihar, a center for \nheavy industries and the Songnen Plain farming area are located in the west and northwest. \nTwo prominent tourism destinations, Wudalianchi and Yichun, are located in the northwest. \nCurrently, travelers have to take a long detour via Harbin to reach Wudalianchi and Yichun. \nRoad transport between the east and west is therefore costly, inefficient in use of natural \nresources, and involves high consumption of fuel, greenhouse gas emissions, and a high road \ntraffic  accident  toll.  This  is  a  constraint  for  socioeconomic  development  and  for  reducing \ndevelopment disparities in the province.  \n \n12.  In the past, the province focused on expanding the road asset base, and gave less \nattention to addressing road maintenance requirements. Though the road length has increased, \nparts of the network are getting old, and road condition is deteriorating due to lack of adequate \nmaintenance. The maintenance backlog has created a need for expensive road improvements \nsuch as rehabilitation and reconstruction. Periodically assessing road condition, maintaining a \nroad database, and planning road maintenance works based on the updated road database are \nessential for timely execution of maintenance work. This will help to avoid expensive road \nimprovements and make optimal use of available maintenance funds. Currently, Heilongjiang \ndoes not have a systematic approach for updating the road database and for planning road \nmaintenance works. To minimize further deterioration of the aging road asset base and preserve \nthe  newly  built  road  infrastructure,  the  province  has  decided  to  introduce  a  road  asset \nmanagement system (RAMS) for planning and prioritizing road maintenance works.  \n \n13.  The  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Transportation  Department  (HPTD)  implements \nmaintenance  works  through  its  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Highway  Bureau  (HPHB).  HPHB  is \nrelatively  inefficient  in  managing  and  undertaking  maintenance  works.  It  has  29,158  staff \n ", " 4 \nresponsible for approximately 13,165 km of national and provincial roads, which amounts to \napproximately 2.8 persons/km, much higher than in developed countries (the ratio is 0.3 in \nAustralia and 0.02 in British Columbia, Canada). HPHB uses road maintenance contracting on a \nlimited basis for some periodic maintenance. Most routine maintenance works are undertaken \nthrough  force-account  work  by  HPHB  and  local  highway  bureaus.  The  province  needs  to \nstreamline  its  organization  and  improve  its  approach  to  undertaking  and  supervising  road \nmaintenance works. It recognizes that a contract-based approach to maintenance would better \nuse human resources, improve operating efficiency, and deliver better quality maintenance \nworks. \n \n14.  Heilongjiang  implemented  fuel  tax  reform  in  January  2009.  This  included  removing \nexisting  tolls  on  class  II  highways  and  receiving  fuel  tax  proceed  funds  from  the  central \ngovernment. The maintenance needs of the province are expected to be supported by applying \nthe RAMS. Heilongjiang received $385 million for road maintenance in 2007, and is expecting to \nreceive $600 million in 2010. Successful RAMS implementation is essential to help the province \njustify the receipt of adequate funding for undertaking proper road maintenance. \n \n15.  Road  safety  remains  a  major  issue  in  Heilongjiang.  In  2008,  road  traffic  accidents \nresulted in 1,703 fatalities and 4,905 injuries. The direct property loss was CNY20.1 million. In \n2007, the number of fatalities per 10,000 vehicles was 6.34; the national average was 5.1. The \nprovince experiences a long winter, with snow coverage for about 120 days. About 10% of \naccidents are due to the presence of ice and snow on roads because of inadequate snow \nclearance. Due to poor knowledge of traffic regulations and use of unsafe vehicles in rural \nareas, the elderly, women, and children are often the victims of road traffic accidents. Other \nfactors  contributing  to  road  accidents  are  inadequate  road  design,  improper  traffic  safety \ndevices, poor knowledge of traffic regulation, and lack of enforcement of road safety law and \nregulation. Timely and effective emergency rescue and first aid mechanisms are also lacking.  \n16.  The Heilongjiang provincial government (HPG) is taking steps to improve road safety, \nsuch as (i) introducing road safety auditing at the design and completion stages of roads, \n(ii) increasing public awareness of traffic regulations, (iii) improving winter road maintenance, \nand (iv) strengthening measures to enforce road safety law and regulations. In 2007, it issued \nthe Heilongjiang Road Traffic Safety Regulations4 and established new requirements for drivers, \nvehicles,  roads,  pedestrians,  accident  treatment,  and  monitoring  of  legal  responsibilities. \nHowever, issues such as traffic regulation enforcement, overloaded vehicles, restriction of use \nof unregistered and unsafe vehicles, improvement of road user behavior, and provision of \neffective emergency response measures still must be addressed. Advanced technologies and \nmethods used in developed countries could be introduced to improve road safety.   \n17.  The province has been making efforts to improve rural transport services for passengers \nand goods, and aims to provide bus services to all but 40 administrative villages by 2009. It has \nbeen improving county rural bus services, and recently financed a pilot project in Lindian county \nthat included (i) deregulation of certain requirements such as cancelling the conventional \u201cfixed \nstops, fixed routings, and fixed schedule\u201d; (ii) issuing area licenses so that buses can operate on \nany  route  within  an  area;  and  (iii)  introducing  chartered  vehicles  to  provide  door-to-door \nservices. These measures are helping to improve county transport services.  \n \n18.  However, in rural and remote areas, the quality of village bus services is inadequate, \nparticularly  in  villages  with  small  populations.  Most  rural  bus  service  providers  are  small \ncompanies or individuals; and lack of competition, overpricing, and overloading are prevalent. \nThe use of old vehicles without proper maintenance is a safety hazard. When accidents occur, \n                                                 \n4  Heilongjiang Provincial Government. 2007. Heilongjiang Province Road Traffic Safety Regulations. Heilongjiang.  ", "    5\nneither service providers nor victims are adequately compensated due to lack of enforcement of \ninsurance policies and guidelines. Service frequency is very low and the average trip distance is \nlong. Because of the low travel demand and long travel distance, bus operators have difficulty \nmaking profits. These various problems are therefore an obstacle to safe, convenient, and \ncomfortable mobility of rural people between villages and townships; and limit the benefit gained \nfrom infrastructure investments. The province needs improved arrangements for village bus \nservices and mechanisms to encourage private operators to provide rural village bus services. \nThe road subsector analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n2.  Government and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n19.  The  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  emphasizes  balanced,  equitable,  and  sustainable \ndevelopment. The government is seeking to increase farmers' incomes, improve infrastructure, \nand enhance public services in the countryside. Transport development is a high priority as it is \nconsidered essential for promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. Starting in 2004, the \ncentral  government  has  been  making  efforts  to  revitalize  the  northeast  region,  including \nHeilongjiang province, as an industrial hub. Part of its approach is to provide improved transport \ninfrastructure to reduce the transport disadvantages faced by the region. The project will support \nthese efforts.  \n \n20.  The  theme  of  the  PRC  country  partnership  strategy  for  2008\u201320105 of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is mainstreaming inclusive growth and environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment. The project will contribute to the strategy, in particular to its main strategic pillars \nof  inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  resource  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability, and support for enabling the environment for private sector participation.   \n3.  Development Coordination \n21.  The PRC transport sector has been receiving considerable external assistance. ADB has \nextended assistance to the central and western provinces and the old industrial areas in the \nnortheast. It has provided 40 loans totaling about $8.07 billion to finance the construction of \nabout 17,088.8 km of roads. Since 1991, 32 advisory technical assistance (TA) projects totaling \n$18.8 million have been provided for roads to strengthen institutions for highway operation and \nmanagement,  improve  road  safety  and  rural  transport  services,  improve  design  standards, \ndeploy information technology, develop human resources, develop urban transport, and mitigate \nadverse impacts. The World Bank has provided about $9.4 billion and the Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  about  \u00a5195.0  billion  to  finance  road  investments.  The  European \nInvestment Bank and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement provided \u20ac85 million of cofinancing \nfor  road  projects  in  the  southwestern  region  of  the  PRC.  ADB  coordinates  with  these \norganizations to discuss progress and issues in the sector, and meets regularly with the World \nBank for coordination and information sharing. A summary of development coordination is in \nAppendix 3.  \n4.  Lessons  \n22.  ADB has financed three road projects in Heilongjiang.6 The first two were implemented \nsuccessfully and the third is currently under implementation. These projects have helped to \nstrengthen  HPTD  capacity  in  project  management  and  administration.  The  project  design \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", " 6 \nbenefited from lessons from these and other ADB-financed road projects in the PRC and the \n2008 Sector Assistance Program Evaluation (SAPE) of ADB Assistance for Roads and Railways \nin the PRC.7 The following lessons guided the design of the project.  \n23.  Be responsive to changing needs. ADB has been responsive to the high priority of the \ngovernment to build national, local, and rural roads, especially in the central, western, and \nnortheastern  provinces.  However,  as  the  road  network  becomes  better  developed,  the \ngovernment will need to improve its approach to managing and financing road maintenance in \norder to sustain the road infrastructure. The project responds to the government's emerging \nneed to address existing weaknesses in road maintenance. \n24.  Traffic  projection  and  adoption  of  lower-capacity  design  standard. International \nfinancial institutions have found that in the PRC, roads tend to be overdesigned compared with \nthe capacity required to serve the traffic. The project design has addressed this issue. Traffic \nforecasts and the origin and destination network were carefully prepared, economic analysis \nwas done separately for each road section with different traffic volumes, and different road \nclassifications were selected to meet the expected traffic volume.  \n25.  Transport network connectivity. Despite building major roads in each province, the \nissue of connectivity with neighboring provinces was not always adequately addressed. This has \nbeen taken into account in preparing the project by including construction of a missing link \nbetween Nenjiang and the border with Inner Mongolia.  \n26.  Road safety. Based on recent studies of road accidents, the World Health Organization \npredicts that, globally, road traffic injuries will rise to become the fifth leading cause of death by \n2030.8 It has drawn attention to the need to (i) emphasize road safety when decisions are made \nabout road infrastructure and transport services, and (ii) improve and sustain enforcement of \nroad safety laws. In the past, ADB-financed projects in the PRC have helped the government \nimprove  road  safety  by  strengthening  collaboration  between  different  agencies,  applying \ninformation technology for monitoring road and traffic conditions, and optimizing road designs. \nADB continues to provide support to strengthen these measures in ADB-financed investment \nprojects and has assisted the government by providing TA support for road safety improvement. \nImportant lessons from these interventions are incorporated in the project design, including \nimproving  road  design  and  enforcement  of  traffic  law,  and  increasing  rural  community \nawareness of traffic regulations to prevent accidents.  \n27.  Transport services. Efficient transport services are essential to maximize the benefit of \ntransport infrastructure investments and enhance contributions to poverty reduction. ADB has \nprovided several TA projects for integrating transport services as part of investment projects. \nThe recommendations of these TAs are integrated in the project design. In particular, the TA for \nSustainable Rural Transport Services provides a model for village bus transport services reform \nand pilot projects.  \n5.  Policy Dialogue \n28.  The project is part of ADB's ongoing policy dialogue with the government on (i) improving \ntransport  connectivity,  efficiency,  and  sustainability;  (ii)  improving  the  regulatory  framework \ngoverning rural road transport services; (iii) promoting information technologies; (iv) addressing \nissues such as greenhouse gas emission, fuel efficiency, and road safety; (v) strengthening \ninstitutional development; and (vi) facilitating private sector participation. The policy dialogue \nmatrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n                                                 \n7  SAPE recommended that ADB should be responsive to changing needs in road subsector in the PRC. \n8  World Health Organization. 2009. Global Status Report on Road Safety. Geneva. ", "    7\n29.  To support improvement of economic efficiency, foster domestic and international trade, \nfacilitate  interregional  integration,  and  reduce  poverty  in  Heilongjiang,  project  preparation \nincluded dialogue on improving road network performance by completing key missing links. \nPriority was given to careful selection of road alignment and road capacity to provide a more \nresource-efficient and environmentally optimized transport infrastructure. The road alignment \nwas revised to avoid one national and two provincial nature reserves. The project will construct \nexpressway and class I and II highways to minimize acquisition, match capacity with expected \ntraffic, and achieve high economic returns.  \n \n30.  ADB  had  a  dialogue  with  the  central  and  provincial  governments  on  road  asset \nsustainability  in  Heilongjiang.  This  included  discussions  on  (i)  efforts  to  improve  road \nmaintenance planning; (ii) the process for planning, budgeting, and implementing maintenance \nworks;  and  (iii)  the  capacity  of  HPHB,  which  is  responsible  for  maintaining  national  and \nprovincial road assets. In 1991, the government developed the China Pavement Management \nSystem, but its use by provinces is limited due to (i) absence of corporate commitment by \ngovernment agencies, (ii) limited funding, (iii) difficulty in operating the system, and (iv) lack of \ncapacity. Several new regulations and procedures have been issued for managing road assets, \nand the government asked the Research Institute of Highway to develop a new system. In 2008, \nthe  research  institute  developed  the  RAMS,  which  is  based  on  the  latest  technology  and \nsoftware, is user friendly, and uses the geographic information system. To facilitate easy and \nreliable data collection for the RAMS, the Research Institute of Highway has also produced a \nspecial vehicle for road condition data collection. Heilongjiang received the RAMS and the \nspecial vehicle in December 2009. The project will help Heilongjiang to introduce the RAMS, \nand institutionalize the improved system.  \n31.  An assessment was conducted on the need to extend bus services to townships and \nvillages.  The  findings  of  ADB-financed  TA9 and  lessons  from  a  pilot  project  financed  by \nHeilongjiang province to provide more flexible user needs-based services in Lindian county were \ndiscussed. Needs  were  identified  to  extend bus  services  to  villages;  to  develop  governing \ndocuments to enforce implementation of government directives, guidelines, and procedures for \nproviding safe, reliable, and affordable village bus services; and to help the province encourage \nprivate  sector  participation  to  provide  rural  village  bus  services.  This  resulted  in  including \nsupport for village bus services within the project. \n \n32.  During  project  preparation,  the  need  for  improved  institutional  arrangements  of  the \nprovincial government agencies to meet the new functions and required skill was assessed. The \nproject will produce recommendations for realigning the highway maintenance organization of \nHeilongjiang  and  provide  capacity  building  support  for  provincial  government  staff  and  the \nprivate sector of the province in managing and delivering road maintenance and rural bus \nservices.  \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Sustainable Rural Transport Services. \nManila. The TA provided the following recommendations to improve rural bus services: (i) revise and update \npolicies on licensing and regulation for rural buses, routes, operators, and bus terminals to encourage more \ndemand-responsive, township-based operations for providing more flexible and efficient services based on user\u2019s \nneeds; and (ii) clarify the role and strengthen the capacity of the county road transport administrations in relation to \nthe recommended regulatory changes. \n ", " 8 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n33.  The impact of the project will be more balanced economic development in Heilongjiang \nprovince. The outcome will be a more resource-efficient, safe, and environment-friendly road \ntransport system in Heilongjiang province. \n \nB.  Outputs \n34.  The project outputs will be (i) 347.06 km of improved road infrastructure in the provincial \nEast\u2013West 2 corridor, (ii) improved road maintenance in the province, (iii) improved bus services \nin  Bei'an  county,  and  (iv)  strengthened  institutional  capacity.  These  will  be  delivered  by \nimplementing four project components:  \n \n(i)  Component A: Improving road infrastructure. The project will (a) construct a \n206.26 km four-lane expressway between Yichun and Wudalianchi (163.67 km \nbetween  Yichun  and  Bei'an  East  and  42.59  km  between  Bei'an  West  and \nWudalianchi),  (b) upgrade  a  127.92  km  gravel  road  between  Longzhen  and \nNenjiang to class II highway, (c) complete the new 12.88 km class I road between \nNenjiang and the provincial border with Inner Mongolia including the extra large \nNen River Bridge, and (d) build three class I and III branch roads with combined \nlength  of  4.33  km.  The  project  road  technical  details  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n(ii)  Component B: Improving road maintenance. The project will introduce the \nRAMS to support road maintenance planning and budgeting, institutionalize the \nimproved road maintenance planning by financing a program of priority road \nmaintenance works at an estimated cost of $50 million, and introduce on a pilot \nbasis the use of performance-based maintenance contracts for road maintenance \nworks (Appendix 5).  \n(iii)  Component C: Improving rural village bus services. The project will introduce \nuser  needs-based  bus  services  in  the  three  villages  of  Bei'an  county  by \nimplementing a pilot project for bus route licensing reform (Appendix 6). The \nproject will also construct 16 new bus stations and rehabilitate 4 bus stations in \nfour counties and three prefectures (Supplementary Appendix B). \n(iv)  Component D: Strengthening institutional capacity. The project will develop \na proposal for realigning the provincial highway bureau to meet the new functions \nto manage the road database, and planning and budgeting of maintenance works \nusing  the  RAMS.  It  will  improve  staff  capacity  through  training  in  road \nmaintenance planning and execution, winter road maintenance and emergency \nresponse, road safety, rural bus services, advanced construction technologies, \nand  use  of  information  technology  in  road  and  traffic  condition  monitoring \n(Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nC.  Special Features \n35.  The  project  will  introduce  best  practices,  approaches,  knowledge,  and  expertise  to \nprovincial transport administrators and beneficiaries to ensure the road transport system is \nadministered in an effective and sustainable manner. \n  \n36.  Promoting regional integration and resource optimization. The project is designed to \npromote more balanced economic development in Heilongjiang by enhancing interprovincial ", "    9\nconnectivity between Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, and linking isolated parts of the province \nwith  more  developed  areas,  thereby  promoting  economic  integration,  expanding  access  to \neconomic opportunities for the rural poor, enhancing mobility of residents, and attracting more \ninvestment to the hinterland. The project will support resource conservation by shortening the \ntravel  distance  by  400  km  and,  in  doing  so,  significantly  reducing  energy  consumption, \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and road accidents.  \n \n37.  Ensuring  transport  infrastructure  sustainability.  Adequate  road  maintenance \nplanning and execution is essential to ensure safe and comfortable road services to road users. \nThe project will assist Heilongjiang in introducing and institutionalizing the RAMS by (i) collecting \nand inputting road condition data into the RAMS, (ii) preparing annual maintenance plans using \nthe RAMS and selecting priority maintenance works on the basis of estimated economic returns, \n(iii) developing a performance-based maintenance contract document including specifications, \n(iv) implementing priority maintenance works over 3 years, and (v) developing a proposal for \nrealigning  the  provincial  highway  bureau  to  meet  the  new  functions  associated  with  the \nimproved road maintenance process. The improved road maintenance planning and budgeting \nwill provide a mechanism to utilize fuel tax proceeds efficiently and in a more sustainable \nmanner. It will also lead to a more predictable pipeline of maintenance works, which will help \nHeilongjiang to attract private sector participation for maintenance contracts and concessions, \nand to improve work quality.  \n \n38.  Introducing  flexible  village  bus  services.  Drawing  upon  the  experience  of \nimplementing the reforms recommended by the ADB TA on improving rural bus services in \nvarious provinces of the PRC, and best practices gained from Lindian county, the project will \nintroduce user needs-based bus services on a pilot basis in three administrative villages of \nBei'an county. Bei'an has experience in providing county bus services; however under this \nproject its capacity for providing safe and reliable village bus services will be strengthened. \nBei'an comprises 62 administrative villages\u201420 do not have formal bus services. The pilot \nproject will help Bei'an (i) protect the public interest by introducing village bus route licensing \nreform, maintaining reasonable fares, and ensuring vehicles are in good condition; (ii) improve \nconditions for bus service providers to operate profitably; and (iii) improve its capacity to monitor \nbus service demand and make the information available to bus service providers and bus \noperators. The pilot project will be implemented in three phases: (i) preparation (collect and \nanalyze  data,  develop  regulations  and  procedures,  and  formulate  pilot  reform); \n(ii) implementation (recruit bus service providers; train government managers, service providers, \nvehicle operators, and other relevant personnel; and introduce bus services on a pilot basis); \nand  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation  (conduct  monitoring,  assess  effectiveness,  and  prepare \nevaluation report including guidance for improvement and replication). To encourage private bus \nservice  providers,  the  government  will  select  a  bus  service  provider  through  open  bidding \namong private and county public bus services providers. \n \n39.  Enhancing road safety. To enhance road safety, the project will improve the behavior \nof rural and forest farm road users, and strengthen the provincial traffic law enforcement process \nby  (i) implementing  public  awareness  programs  on  road  traffic  regulation,  and  (ii) training \ntechnical and managerial staff on best practices in enforcing traffic safety law and regulations. \nDuring project preparation, a road safety audit was undertaken on the preliminary design, and \nroad safety enhancement measures were recommended. The project will provide consulting \nservices to ensure that these recommendations are adequately incorporated during construction \nof the project roads.    \n40.  Promoting intelligent transport system. The use of an intelligent transport system is \nbuilt into the project and includes (i) advanced toll payment; (ii) variable message displays to \nimprove driver information; (iii) use of surveillance technology, and detection of black spot \n ", " 10 \nlocations and weather conditions; (iv) monitoring of speed limit, overloaded vehicles, and toll \npayment; and (v) provision of real-time information on road and traffic conditions. This will \nstrengthen traffic management and enhance road safety. \n41.  Reducing  vehicle  emissions.  Rapid  motorization  has  led  to  increased  vehicle \nemissions and air pollution in Heilongjiang. Through the project, an integrated plan has been \ndeveloped to help agencies in Heilongjiang reduce vehicle emissions (Appendix 7); the plan will \nbe implemented and monitored by Heilongjiang Environmental Protection Bureau. The plan \nincludes  (i)  regulating  the  automobile  industry,  (ii)  requiring  annual  vehicle  testing, \n(iii) implementing  a  vehicle  inspection  and  maintenance  program,  and  (iv)  introducing  tax \nincentives for manufacturers of environment-friendly cars. The project will directly decrease air \npollution as (i) vehicle emissions on the project roads are expected to be lower because of \nbetter  traffic  flow  and  increased  efficiency  of  energy  use,  and  (ii)  travel  distance  will  be \nshortened by 400 km. Consequently, carbon dioxide emissions will be reduced by 5.65 million \ntons cumulatively in the first 20 years after completion of the project roads.  \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n42.  The project investment cost is estimated at $998.15 million, including taxes and duties of \n$28.59 million (Table 1).

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period ", "    11\nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  and  project  agreements.  The \ngovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.  \n \n44.  The ADB loan will finance 20.04% of the project cost, including the financing charges on \nthe ADB loan during implementation. Agricultural Bank of China will finance $419.70 million \n(CNY2.86 billion or 42.05%) of the project cost on a 20-year term, including a grace period of \n4 years, at an interest rate of 5.94%. The Ministry of Transport will finance $203.56 million \n(20.39%) of the project cost. HPG will finance $174.89 million (17.52%) of the project cost. \nHPTD has provided a commitment letter to confirm (i) timely provision of adequate counterpart \nfunds, and (ii) provision of additional counterpart funding to cover any funding shortfalls that may \noccur during project implementation. The PRC will be the borrower. The ADB loan proceeds will \nbe made available to HPG, which will make them available to HPTD on the same terms and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan, with HPTD bearing the exchange rate and interest rate \nvariation risks on the ADB loan.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n45.  HPG has established a project steering committee chaired by the vice governor of the \nprovince to oversee the construction of all road projects under implementation. The steering \ncommittee will provide guidance and resolve project implementation issues. HPTD will be the \nexecuting agency, responsible for overall implementation of the project. It has established a \nproject management office (PMO), which will be the implementing agency for construction of \nproject roads (component A) and implementation of project components C and D. The PMO will \nbe  headed  by  a  project  manager,  who  will  oversee  day-to-day  implementation  including \ncoordinating activities to comply with safeguard requirements, supervising procurement of goods \nand services, monitoring utilization of the ADB loan and government funds, preparing and \nsubmitting reports to ADB and the government, and ensuring that the complaints received from \nlocal residents are addressed adequately. The expressway and class I roads will be operated \nand managed by the Toll Roads Administration Bureau under HPTD, while the class II road will \nbe maintained by HPHB.  \n46.  Within the PMO, Bei'an county transport bureau will form a pilot project secretariat for \nimplementation of the rural village bus services pilot project. The secretariat will be chaired by \nthe pilot project coordinator who will (i) provide the interface between the implementing agency \nand the pilot project, (ii) oversee day-to-day implementation, (iii) provide information to the PMO \n ", " 12 \nfor decision making, (iv) supervise the activities of consultants to be engaged under the project, \nand (v) submit progress reports to the PMO.  \n47.  HPHB will be the implementing agency for implementing project component B. It has \nestablished a project implementing unit to be responsible for implementing the activities for \nimproving road maintenance. The organization chart for project implementation is in Appendix 9. \n2.  Implementation Period \n48.  The  project  will  be  implemented  from  March  2010  to  December  2014.  The  road \nconstruction is expected to take 3.5 years. Implementation of the road maintenance component \nwill  take  4\u00bd  years,  and  the  pilot  project  for  introducing  rural  village  bus  services  will  be \nimplemented over 3 years. Institutional and staff capacity building activities are expected to be \nimplemented during 2010\u20132014. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement \n49.  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The ADB loan will finance the 23 contract packages for project road \ncivil works, which will be procured through international competitive bidding. Prior review will be \napplied for these contract packages. Other civil works contract packages, bus stations, and \nmaintenance  works  will  be  financed  by  the  government  and  procured  using  government \nprocedure acceptable to ADB. A procurement plan is in Appendix 11. During project preparation, \nADB assessed HPTD\u2019s capacity to handle procurement and found it to be acceptable.    \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n50.  The ADB loan will finance (i) 14 person-months of international consulting services for \nconstruction supervision (8 person-months for a highway engineer, and 2 person-months each \nfor a bridge engineer, road safety expert, and pavement engineer); (ii) 8 person-months of \ninternational consulting services for implementation of component B (2.5 person-months for a \nmaintenance contract specialist, 2 person-months each for a RAMS specialist and maintenance \nwork  specialist,  1  person-month  for  an  institutional  specialist,  and 0.5 person-months  for  a \nmaintenance financing specialist); and (iii) 15 person-months of national consulting services for \nimplementation of component C (8 person-months for a rural transport specialist and 4 person-\nmonths for a bus service regulation specialist, and 3 person-months for a passenger survey \nspecialist).  The  government  will  finance  about  8,000  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices  for  construction  supervision,  monitoring  of  resettlement,  and  monitoring  of \nenvironmental  and  socioeconomic  impacts,  and  25 person-months  for  implementing \ncomponent B.   \n \n51.  All  ADB-financed  consulting  services  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  international  consultants  for \nconstruction  supervision  and  piloting  maintenance-by-contract  for  maintenance  works,  and \nnational consultants for piloting rural village bus services will be recruited through a firm using \nthe quality- and cost-based selection method based on simplified technical proposal, with quality \nand cost ratio of 80:20 for construction supervision and 90:10 for implementing the two pilot \nprojects.10 For  introducing  the  RAMS,  an  individual  consultant  will  be  engaged  using  the \nindividual consultant selection method. All national consultants financed by the government will \nbe recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. The outline terms of \nreference for consulting services is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n                                                 \n10 The higher weighting reflects the need for specialized expertise to carry out the two pilot projects.  ", "    13\n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n52.  Given the high priority accorded to the project by the government, on 21 April and \n25 September 2009 ADB approved advance contracting of civil works and consulting services. \nAdvance contracting covers the bidding, bid evaluation, short-listing, and request and evaluation \nof consultants' proposals. On 24 November 2009, ADB approved retroactive financing to finance \neligible expenditures for civil works and consulting services of up to $40 million incurred prior to \nloan effectiveness but not earlier than a maximum of 12 months before signing of the loan \nagreement.  The  government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n53.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  the  PRC  and  HPTD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nproject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations, and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of HPTD, implementing agencies, and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project.  \n \n54.  HPTD will ensure, during project implementation, that (i) officials from the Discipline and \nInspection Bureau monitor bidding, construction, and operations; (ii) a two-contract system is \nadopted where the winner of a civil works contract will also sign an anticorruption contract with \nthe employer; and (iii) periodic inspection of contractors is undertaken to ensure that funds \nwithdrawal  and  settlement  procedures  are  followed.  HPTD  will  initiate  liaison  with  the \nprosecutor\u2019s office, on an as-needed basis, to discuss any warnings about, or information on, \nany corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n55.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment and commitment procedures \nwill  be  used  for  large  works  contracts.  If  the  government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible \nexpenditures, ADB\u2019s reimbursement procedure will be followed. To expedite the flow of funds \nHeilongjiang Provincial Finance Bureau will establish and manage a separate imprest account \nafter loan effectiveness, at a bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest account shall be used \nexclusively to finance ADB's share of eligible expenditures for the loan. Disbursement from the \nimprest  account  will  be  supported  by  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related \ndocumentation.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  set  as  either  the  estimated \nexpenditures to be financed through the imprest account for the next 6 months, or 10% of the \nloan amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures procedure may be used to \nreimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances provided into the imprest account for \nany individual payment not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  HPTD will maintain separate accounts and records for the project and related financial \nstatements. The project accounts and financial statement will be maintained in accordance with \nsound accounting principles and practices as prescribed by the Accounting Law of the PRC. \nHPTD will have such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by independent \n ", " 14 \nexternal auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to \nADB, and in accordance with auditing standards that are acceptable to ADB. The audit of such \nfinancial statements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal \ncontrol systems with respect to project expenditures and other financial transactions, and (ii) an \nassessment of compliance with loan covenants that may be agreed under the project and ADB's \nrequirements on project management. HPTD will submit to ADB within 6 months of the end of \neach related fiscal year the project\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements, audited project \naccounts, audit reports, and management letters in English. A separate auditors opinion on the \nuse of the statement of expenditures procedure and the imprest account, if any, will be included \nas part of the auditor's report. \n \n57.  To  ensure  that  internal  controls  and  checks  on  the  project  construction  costs  and \noperations are effective, HPTD has established an internal audit unit to carry out independent \nchecks during project implementation. The internal audit unit will independently test financial \ntransactions of the PMO to ensure the safe custody of the project-financed assets and will report \ndirectly to HPTD and external auditors. HPTD will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting \nthe progress of project implementation to ADB by submitting quarterly progress reports to ADB \nas well as a project completion report within 3 months of the end of the project. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n58.  The project performance monitoring system was prepared including all the indicators that \nrelate to the project\u2019s impacts, outcomes, and outputs; and specifies the source and frequency \nfor data collection. HPTD agrees with the monitoring system; and will establish and verify the \nbaseline values at project inception and measure the indicators and report the key findings to \nADB prior to midterm review, at completion, and annually for 3 years after completion. The \nproject performance monitoring system is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n10.  Project Review \n59.  In addition to regular annual reviews, ADB will carry out a detailed midterm review of the \nproject in the third year of project implementation, identify major problems, and agree on any \nchanges  needed  to  achieve  the  project  objectives.  The  review  will  cover  all  institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, \neconomic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of \nthe project and its viability. The review will examine compliance with covenants and assurances \nin the loan and project agreements.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Institutional Improvements \n \n60.  The project will improve the public sector management capacity of the province by \nstrengthening institutional and staff capacity in road maintenance management, public transport \nmanagement, and road safety management by (i) providing expertise, training, and equipment; \n(ii) helping to introduce and institutionalize an improved system for maintenance planning and \nbudgeting; (iii) developing regulatory documentation for bus services; and (iv) implementing the \npilot activities. It will create an enabling environment to attract private sector participation in \nexecution of road maintenance and providing rural village bus services.  \n \n \n \n ", "    15\nB.  Traffic Forecast \n \n61.  During project preparation, traffic analysis and forecasts were reviewed and reestimated. \nComprehensive origin\u2013destination zones were used to carry out an origin\u2013destination survey. \nTraffic on the project roads is forecasted to be 3,927\u20139,517 passenger car units per day in 2014 \nand increase to 12,933\u201329,569 in 2033. Based on the capacity required to carry the expected \ntraffic, the road sections are designed in three different classifications (expressway, and class I \nand II).  \n \nC.  Economic Analysis \n62.  The project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated by comparing the \nwithout-project  and  with-project  scenarios  for  four  road  sections:  Yichun\u2013Bei\u2019an,  Bei\u2019an\u2013\nWudalianchi,  Longzhen\u2013Nenjiang,  and  Nenjiang\u2013Inner  Mongolia  border  (Appendix  12). The \neconomic costs include (i) the capital cost for construction including physical contingencies, and \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (ii) costs  for  environmental  management  and  monitoring, \ndetailed engineering design, and construction supervision; and (iii) annualized recurring costs for \nroad maintenance, environmental monitoring, and opportunity cost of land. The economic benefits \nare  (i)  savings  in  travel  time,  vehicle  operating  costs,  and  traffic  accidents  costs;  and \n(ii) generated traffic. The project is economically viable. The economic internal rate of return for \nthe whole project is 17.79%; the rates for the four road sections range from 14.04% to 19.36%. \nSensitivity tests confirm the robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability.  \n \nD.  Financial Analysis and Projections \n63.  The project's financial analysis was prepared in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for \nthe Financial Management and Analysis of Projects11 (Appendix 13). For the expressway and \nclass I road, the projected financial statements indicate a cash-flow shortage in the first year of \noperation. HPTD confirmed that it will allocate required funds for operation and maintenance of \nthe project expressway and class I road during the first year of operation to balance any \nshortage in the projected cash flow. The financial evaluation of the expressway was undertaken \nin real terms using constant 2009 prices. The financial internal rate of return for the project \nexpressway, computed on an after-tax basis is 6.17%. This compares favorably with the real \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  of  3.56%.  The \nexpressway and class I road are therefore considered financially viable. Sensitivity tests indicate \nthat the project is financially viable in most circumstances except in the worst case scenario of \ntraffic  falling  20%  below  the  forecast  and  the  project  cost  increasing  by  20%.  Given  past \nexperience of projects in the sector, the likelihood of this combination of adverse circumstances \nis considered low. HPTD will review the performance of the expressway regularly and monitor \nactual traffic volume and financial performance to prevent such occurrence.  \n \n64.  To maintain the constructed and upgraded sections of the project roads so that they do \nnot exceed an international roughness index of 3.5, annual maintenance will be required along \nwith  periodic  maintenance  every  9  years.  HPTD  will  provide  necessary  funds  for  the \nmaintenance of the project roads. Revenue-earning road sections generate adequate funds for \ntheir  maintenance  and  debt  repayment.  The  average  annual  cost  of  maintenance  of  the \nclass II road is anticipated to be only 0.8% of HPTD\u2019s total road maintenance budget. Financial \nmanagement assessment found that HPTD meets the financial management requirements and \ncan provide accurate and timely information in the reports required by ADB. The financial \nmanagement assessment is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2005. Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", " 16 \nE.  Social Impact \n1.  Poverty and Socioeconomic Impacts \n65.  The project will benefit about 1.7 million people in the five counties along the project \nroads. The project impact area has 512,200 direct beneficiaries in 48 township or towns, of \nwhom 49.2% are rural, 23.3% are state farm workers, 4.8% are state forest workers, and \n22.7% are urban residents. The 9,090 ethnic minority people in the project impact area comprise \n1.7% of the total population, and include Hui, Korean, and Mongolian. In 2008, the poverty \nincidence12 in the project impact area was 8.7% involving 44,500 people, with poverty conditions \nin the state forest farms averaging 12.8%. Among them, the rural poor account for about 30,000 \nwho live in 50 poverty villages. The project will significantly improve rural connectivity and \nfacilitate the delivery of safe and comfortable road and road transport services to the public by \n(i) improving road safety by applying information communication technology for better regulation, \nmonitoring, response to the movement of people and goods on the project roads; (ii) improving \nroad maintenance; and (iii) introducing rural village bus services. \n66.  The  project  will  generate  social  and  economic  benefits  for  local  residents  and \ngovernments including (i) transport cost and time savings; (ii) traffic accident cost savings; \n(iii) improved access to health care and social services; (iv) direct job opportunities during \nconstruction and maintenance works; (v) new economic opportunities for local forest workers \nwho have lost their jobs due to the national policy on preserving forest resources; (vi) increased \ndemand locally for building materials, construction machinery, and transport during civil works; \n(vii) increased information flow; (viii) facilitation of tourism development; (ix) reduced vehicle \nemissions; and (ix) an enabling environment for private sector participation. The project will \ncontribute to poverty reduction by (i) promoting ecotourism in Wudalianchi Scenic Area and \nYichun  forestry  areas,  and  (ii)  facilitating  more  efficient  flow  of  agricultural  products  and \nnontimber forest products to market. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 14. \n \n67.  The project will not have major adverse social impacts except for land acquisition, which \nwill be mitigated by implementation of the resettlement plan. A social development action plan \n(SDAP) was prepared to increase the inclusiveness of project benefits, and avoid or mitigate \nany adverse social impacts, particularly for women, ethnic minorities, and the poor. The project \nis rated category B for ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), so specific actions are \nincluded in the SDAP. Key features of the SDAP include (i) road safety awareness for rural \ncommunities;  (ii) income  and  livelihood  recovery  for  people  affected  by  resettlement; \n(iii) transmissible  disease  prevention;  (iv)  avoidance  of  community  disturbance  during \nconstruction; (v) priority hiring of local residents for construction; (vi) complementary poverty \nreduction programs; (vii) enhancement of project benefits for women, including through women's \nemployment, livelihood training, and microcredit, and promoting women's participation in project \nimplementation;  and  (viii) transport  service  improvements.  HPTD  will  closely  monitor \nimplementation of the SDAP; ADB will review implementation. The SDAP is in Supplementary \nAppendix G.   \n  \n68.  Extensive  public  consultations  were  held  with  1,600  people  throughout  project \npreparation,  including  16  focus  group  discussions  to  gather  opinions  on  road  alignment, \nenvironment,  and  resettlement  measures.  Public  awareness  of  the project  is  high  and  the \nresidents and local governments view the construction of the project road positively. HPTD \ncarried out consultation meetings with (i) the people affected by the revision of the road alignments \nand the respective local governments were informed about the alignments, and (ii) the people who \n                                                 \n12  Heilongjiang adopts CNY1,300 per person per year as the rural poverty line. The urban poverty threshold is \nCNY176 per person per month. ADB's new poverty standard is $1.25 per day (equivalent to CNY1,500 per year). ", "    17\nwould have been affected by the original alignments and respective local governments were \ninformed about the change in the alignment to avoid any possible misunderstanding or incorrect \nexpectation about the alignment of the project road. Consultations will be ongoing to increase \nunderstanding  and  meet  the  evolving  needs  and  expectations  of  the  stakeholders,  and \nencourage active involvement of local communities. The consultation and participation plan to \nbe implemented during project implementation is in Supplementary Appendix H.   \n \n2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n69.  The project is classified as category A for involuntary resettlement. HPTD has prepared \na full resettlement plan for the project roads and a short resettlement plan for the bus stations. \nResettlement  information  booklets  were  distributed  to  affected  villages.  The  project  will \npermanently acquire 1,365 hectares 13 of land, which will partially affect about 3,500 households \nwith 14,000 people, and require 134.6 hectares for temporary use. Ten households and one \nenterprise  need  to  be  relocated.  Of  the  total  affected  population,  2,000  households  with \n8,000 people  are  rural  residents,  and  1,500 households  with  6,000  persons  are  state  farm \nworkers or state forest farm workers. On average, only 7.5% of each affected household\u2019s \nfarmland will be acquired; abundant farmland is available, especially on state farms. No ethnic \nminorities are affected by land acquisition and resettlement. The summary resettlement plan is \nincluded in Appendix 15 and full resettlement plans are in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \nF.  Environmental Impact \n \n70.  The  project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  A.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) for the project roads and bus stations was prepared by HPTD and approved \nby Heilongjiang Environmental Protection Bureau in May 2009. A summary EIA (SEIA) including \nan  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  environmental  framework  for  maintenance \nworks was circulated to the ADB Board of Directors and made publicly available through the \nADB website on 14 October 2009. The EIA and SEIA assess the environmental impact of the \nselected road alignments of the project roads and bus stations, and prescribe environmental \nprotection and mitigation measures. HPTD will implement the EMP to ensure that all potential \nadverse environmental impacts of the project are mitigated. \n \nG.  Risks \n \n71.  Overall,  the  project  risk  is  considered  low.  In  preparing  the  project,  the  financial, \nenvironmental, and social risks were assessed and the mitigation measures were incorporated. \nTo mitigate financial risks associated with construction and initial operation of the expressway \nand class I road, HPTD has agreed to provide sufficient funding to balance any shortfall in cash \nflow in the first year of operation. The class II road will be toll free. Adequate maintenance and \nfunding of road maintenance of the road without tolls will be ensured through the improved road \nmaintenance planning and budgeting process to be introduced under the project. These actions \nwill help in ensuring that financial risks of the project are low. The project is expected to have \nadverse  environmental  impacts  during  construction;  however,  after  implementation  of  the \nmitigation measures reflected in the environmental management plan, adverse environmental \nimpacts  due  to  construction  will  be  minor.  Social  issues  include  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  and  transmissible  diseases.  However,  after  implementation  of  the  mitigation \nmeasures, the residual effect will be minor. Implementation of these measures will be closely \nmonitored by the government and reviewed by ADB. \n \n                                                 \n13  This includes 3.1 ha of land required for the 16 new bus stations. \n ", " 18 \nV.  ASSURANCES \n72.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  and  HPG  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the loan and project agreements.  \n73.  Road  maintenance.  HPG  will  implement  the  road  maintenance  component  by \n(i) providing adequate funds to HPHB to (a) purchase the RAMS and specialized data collection \nvehicles, (b) collect field data annually, and (c) update and maintain the road database and/or \ndatacenter; and (ii) financing maintenance works at an estimated cost of $50 million including \n$5 million for pilot testing performance-based maintenance contract works during 3 years to be \nselected from priority works identified in the annual road maintenance plans.  \n74.  To help institutionalize the road maintenance system, HPG will (i) prepare annual road \nmaintenance plans, which will be based on prioritization of maintenance works according to \nobjective criteria that include expected economic rate of return calculated using the RAMS; and \n(ii) ensure that the prioritized works included in the annual road maintenance plans are used as \nthe basis for determining works that are executed under the annual maintenance budget.  \n75.  HPG  will  (i)  maintain  the  project  class  II  road,  (ii)  ensure  that  documents  on  road \nmaintenance that are developed under the project are adopted, and (iii) ensure that the proposal \non realignment of HPHB is considered within 6 months of completion of project component B. \n \n76.  Road  safety.  HPG will ensure that (i) HPTD incorporates the road safety auditor's \nrecommendations into the road detailed design and implements them during construction; and \n(ii) Heilongjiang Public Security Bureau will install (a) traffic violation monitoring cameras on the \nproject expressway and at entrances to villages where the class II road passes, and (b) two \nweighbridges on the class II road within 6 months after  its opening. \n \n77.  Rural village bus services. HPG will cause (i) HPTD to ensure that (a) bus services will \nbe  sustainably  operating  in  three  administrative  villages  of  Bei'an  county,  (b) documents \ngoverning the provision of village bus services are developed and used, and (c) private bus \nservices providers are given equal opportunity to be involved in the pilot project; (ii) Heilongjiang \nPublic Security Bureau to ensure that traffic police stations in the three administrative villages \nenforce all traffic regulations in the pilot project area; and (iii) Heilongjiang Provincial Finance \nBureau to provide subsidy, if needed, to the selected bus services providers. \n \n78.

Heilongjiang Transport Sector \n1.  The transport network of Heilongjiang province comprises five modes: railway, highway, \nwaterway, aviation, and pipeline; and has a very important role in the integrated transportation \nsystem of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The overall layout of the province\u2019s transport \nnetwork is centered around Harbin, connecting to regional central cities as nodes, and radiating \nto border areas. This transport network also connects to Jilin province in the south and Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region in the west. \n \n2.  By  the  end  of  2007,  the  province\u2019s  railway  lines  reached  7,250  kilometers  (km), \nconnecting 62.8% of the cities in Heilongjiang. Railways play an important role in the province\u2019s \neconomic development, especially for the transportation of energy, minerals, materials, and \nother bulk cargo.  \n \n3.  By the end of 2007, Heilongjiang had a road network of 140,909 km, with a density of \n31 km  per  hundred  square  km,  lower  than  the  country\u2019s  average  density.  By  technical \nclassification,  the  road  network  comprises  1,044  km  of  expressways,  1,435  km  of  class  I \nhighways, 7,443 km of class II highways, 33,207 km of class III roads, and 50,883 km of class \nIV roads. \n \n4.  Inland waterway transport in Heilongjiang province is mainly along the Heilongjiang \nRiver,  Wusuli  River,  Songhua  River  and  Nen  River;  comprising  5,528  km  of  navigable \nwaterways.  Water  ports  are  mainly  located  along  Songhua  River  and  Heilongjiang  River, \nincluding the main ports of Fuyuan, Harbin, Heihe, Jiamusi, and Tongjiang. The system has \n172 passenger and freight berths, with annual freight capacity of 15 million tons, and capacity \nfor 1.8 million passengers. \n \n5.  Currently, Heilongjiang province has five civil airports, located at Harbin, Heihe, Jiamusi, \nMudanjiang, and Qiqihar. Harbin Taiping Airport is an international airport and the second \nlargest airport in the northeast of the PRC. More than 60 air routes form an aviation network to \nall provinces of the country, and Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation. \n \n6.  Alongside robust socioeconomic development and transport infrastructure improvement, \npassenger and freight traffic in Heilongjiang province have grown rapidly. During 2000\u20132007, \ntotal passenger traffic increased by 30%; and total freight traffic increased by 28%. Despite \ncompetition among transport modes in recent years, railway transportation is still dominant in \nfreight transportation due to its low price and high reliability. However, a significant amount of \nmedium and short-distance passenger traffic has diverted from railway to road. During 2000\u2013\n2007, passenger road traffic increased by an annual average of 4.72% and freight traffic by \n4.03% per annum. \n \nB.  Heilongjiang Road Subsector \n7.  The Heilongjiang Provincial Transportation Department (HPTD) is responsible for the \nplanning, development, maintenance, and administration of the road and waterway subsectors \non behalf of the provincial government. HPTD is mainly responsible for national and provincial \nhighways, including planning, financing, construction, operation, and maintenance. Prefecture \nand county communications bureaus are responsible for construction and maintenance of local \nroads. HPTD also regulates the road transport industry by licensing drivers, vehicles, and ", "Appendix 2  25 \nintercity bus services. Freight transport is essentially deregulated, but interprovincial bus routes \nstill  require  approval  from  the  Ministry  of  Transport.  Private  operations  have  increased, \nimproving transport efficiency and quality, and increasing competition. Road transport tariffs are \nallowed  to  vary  within  a  range  of  plus  or  minus  20%  of  advisory  tariffs  set  by  the  local \ngovernment.  \n \n8.  Substantial  funds  have  been  used  for  rural  road  development.  However,  road \nmaintenance funding appears to be inadequate. In recent years, the funds for road development \nwere sourced mainly from domestic banks, local governments, and Ministry of Transport grants. \nHigh class roads (above class I) are expected to cover their operation and maintenance costs \nand  debt  service  charges  from  their  toll  revenues.  Reliance  on  domestic  debt  has  been \nincreasing, used to finance both expressways and other road projects and repaid from toll \nrevenues. Starting on 1 January 2009, the central government issued and implemented a new \npolicy to abolish the collection of road maintenance fees and five other types of transportation \nfees, and to start collection of fuel tax. \n \nC.  Heilongjiang Road Sector Development Plan \n9.  To  stimulate  and  maintain  high  socioeconomic  development,  in  June  2008  the \nHeilongjiang government approved a 3-year plan for speeding up road development. It will \nenhance  efforts  and  investment  for  road  development  during  2008\u20132011,  and  invest \nCNY90 billion to develop 2,207 km of expressways, 731 km of class I highways, 3,252 km of \nclass II highways, and 60,799 km of rural roads.  \n \nD.  Road Issues \n10.  Transport connectivity. Heilongjiang is the sixth largest province in the PRC with large \nforest cover area and agricultural farmlands. Historically timber production, agriculture, and \nheavy  industry  are  the  three  major  outputs,  and  the  railroad  has  been  one  of  the  major \ntransportation modes. As for road transportation, despite the large amount of investment in \nrecent years, including investments from ADB, development of the road network is still lagging \nother parts of the PRC, especially in the coastal and more populated areas. Currently, the road \nnetwork is mainly concentrated around Harbin and the construction and upgrading of roads in \nthe far north, east, and west along the provincial border is still in the planning stage. Transport \ncost is high and poor access to the vast rural and remote area is one of the main constraints for \nrural poverty reduction. \n \n11.  Road  maintenance.  HPTD  implements  maintenance  works  using  its  own  staff  of \napproximately 29,158, of which 18,831 are categorized as maintenance workers. They are \nresponsible for approximately 13,165 km of national and provincial roads. This amounts to \napproximately 2.8 persons/km, which is much higher than in developed countries (in Australia \nthe ratio is 0.3 and in British Columbia, Canada it is 0.02). Heilongjiang province makes limited \nuse  of  the  private  sector  for  contracted  maintenance.  The  approach  to  planning  road \nmaintenance works and allocation of funds for road maintenance in the province is not yet well \ndeveloped. \n \n12.  Road  safety.  In  2008,  road  traffic  accidents  resulted  in  1,703  fatalities  and \n4,905 injuries. The direct property loss was CNY20.1 million. In 2007, the number of fatalities \nper 10,000 vehicles was 6.34; the national average was 5.1. The province experiences a long \nwinter with snow coverage for about 120 days. About 40% of total accidents are due to the \npresence of ice and snow on roads because of inadequate snow clearance. Due to poor ", "26  Appendix 2 \nknowledge of traffic regulations and use of unsafe vehicles, the rural elderly, women, and \nchildren  often  become  victims  of  road  traffic  accidents.  Other  factors  contributing  to  road \naccidents are inadequate road design, improper traffic safety devices, and lack of enforcement. \nMany law-enforcement groups are not well educated about road safety and do not adopt best \npractices, methods, approaches, and systems. Timely and effective emergency rescue and first \naid mechanisms are also lacking.  \n \n13.  Public  transport  services.  In  addition  to  the  construction  and  upgrading  of  road \ninfrastructure, the improvement of transport services, both for passengers and goods, is an \nimportant part of improving transport in rural areas. Currently, bus service is still one of the \nmajor means of transport in rural areas. Services are mainly provided by private transport \ncompanies and are subject to market forces. In some cases, villages with fewer passengers do \nnot have any bus services. In addition to market forces, appropriate government policies are \nneeded to regulate rural bus services and to provide incentives for bus companies to provide \nservices for both populated and less populated villages. \n ", "  Appendix 3  27 \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION \n \n1.  In the road subsector, the World Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national and local road networks. The \nWorld Bank has provided loans of about $9.4 billion to finance road investments and the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (provided by Japan Bank for International Cooperation) has \nprovided  about  \u00a5195.0  billion.  The  European  Investment  Bank  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement provided \u20ac85 million cofinancing for road projects in the southwestern region of \nthe People's Republic of China. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) coordinates with these \ndevelopment partners to discuss progress and issues in the sector. ADB meets regularly with \nthe World Bank for coordination and information sharing. The government coordinates the \nactivities of different development partners and has utilized ADB technical assistance support \nfor researching and influencing a number of policy interventions. ADB has coordinated closely \nwith other development partners on policy dialogue and shared its development experiences \nwith them. \nTable A3: Major Development Partners: Key Activities \nProject Name  Date Approved  Amount \nA.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Highway Bureau (HPHB) is responsible for approximately \n13,165 kilometers of national and provincial roads.1 Heilongjiang has utilized road maintenance \ncontracting  on  a  limited  basis  for  some  periodic  maintenance;  however  most  routine \nmaintenance is undertaken as force account with some complementary funding provided by the \nHeilongjiang Provincial Transportation Department (HPTD). \n \n2.  In  2007,  the  Ministry  of  Transport  issued  the  highway  performance  assessment \nstandards, and in 2008 developed the road asset management system (RAMS). The RAMS has \nfunctions to meet highway performance assessment standards requirements, including highway \ncondition information management, highway performance assessment, maintenance decision-\nmaking analysis, annual road maintenance planning, and medium- and long-term maintenance \nplanning. To facilitate easy and reliable data collection for the RAMS, the Ministry of Transport \nhas developed a special road condition data collection vehicle. It has asked the provinces to use \nthe RAMS for planning and budgeting of road maintenance works in their jurisdiction including \nHeilongjiang. \n \nB.  Objective and Scope of Asian Development Bank Assistance \n \n3.  Introduction of the RAMS in Heilongjiang requires support for development of skills in \nrunning the RAMS; field data collection using the special vehicle; data processing and upgrading \nthe road database; preparing annual road maintenance plans based on road conditions, traffic, \nand expected economic returns; and maintaining the improved database and software and \nequipment. HPTD has also recognized that the long-term sustainability of the RAMS will require \nan efficient organization structure to facilitate proactive road asset management; this would \nrequire a realignment of relevant parts of HPHB to meet the new functions and processes. \nDuring project preparation, HPTD asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help introduce \nthe RAMS in the province and build required capacity in road maintenance by including a project \ncomponent for improving road maintenance. This component aims to enhance HPHB's capacity \nin prioritizing and budgeting maintenance works. It will also assist HPHB to introduce the use of \nperformance-based maintenance contract to improve the quality of works and develop private \nsector capacity for bidding and execution of maintenance works.  \n4.  This project component consists of introducing and institutionalizing the RAMS, and \nintroducing a performance-based maintenance contract on a pilot basis. \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n5.  HPHB will be the implementing agency with overall responsibility for this component. It \nhas established a project implementing unit (PIU). The director of the HPTD Planning Division \nwill  chair  the  PIU.  The  PIU  has  five  staff:  (i)  deputy  director,  Planning  Division,  HPTD; \n(ii) director and deputy director, Planning and Statistic Division, HPHB; (iii) staff from Planning \nDivision,  HPTD;  and  (iv)  chief,  Maintenance  Administration  Division,  HPHB.  During  project \nimplementation the PIU will be supported by staff from local highway maintenance stations.

The bus services between counties and towns in Heilongjiang are generally adequate, \nhowever township and village services in rural and remote areas are unreliable and unsafe. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)-financed technical assistance for Sustainable Rural Transport \nServices1  indicates  that  improvement  in  rural  transport  services  is  needed  as  part  of  the \ngovernment policy to reduce rural poverty. To support this, the project includes component C: \nimproving rural village bus services. This project component will provide new bus services in \nthree  administrative  villages  in  Bei'an  county  by  implementing  a  pilot  project.  It  will  also \nconstruct and rehabilitate 20 bus stations in the project impact area including four new bus \nstations in Bei'an. The Ministry of Transport will finance the civil works for these bus stations \n($880,000). \nA.  Pilot Project \n \n2.  Overview. Bei'an county comprises 62 administrative villages\u201420 do not have formal \nbus services. Small companies or individuals provide the rural bus service. Lack of competition, \noverpricing, and overloading often occur. The use of old vehicles without proper maintenance \nand  agriculture  tractors,  tri-motor-cycles,  and  trucks  is  common,  and  sometimes  results  in \naccidents. In the event of an accident, due to lack of enforcement of insurance regulation, the \nbus service providers and victims are not properly compensated.  \n \n3.  Objective. The pilot project aims to (i) protect the public interest by introducing village \nbus  route  licensing  reform,  keeping  fares  reasonable,  and  ensuring  vehicles  are  in  good \ncondition; (ii) improve conditions for bus service providers to operate profitably; and (iii) improve \nthe efficiency of local transport bureaus in monitoring demand for bus services and responding \nto increased demand for bus services providers and bus operators. One township and three \nadministrative villages will be selected to pilot bus route licensing reform based on the results of \nfield investigations to be undertaken under the project. The following recommendations given \nunder ADB technical assistance will be applied for the pilot project: \n \n(i)  encourage the development of local bus operators that would have the exclusive \nright to provide a coordinated network of bus services to surrounding villages; \nand  \n(ii)  amend the licensing regulations2 applicable to bus services between townships \nand villages and between villages to permit greater flexibility in the use of bus \nroute, fares charged, and types of vehicle used.  \n \n4.  Implementation  arrangements.  The  project  management  office  established  under \nHeilongjiang  Provincial  Transportation  Department  (HPTD)  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation of the pilot project. Bei'an County Transport Administration Station (BCTAS) will \nform  a  pilot  project  secretariat  chaired  by  the  pilot  project  coordinator.  The  pilot  project \ncoordinator will (i) provide the interface between the implementing agency and the pilot project, \n(ii)  oversee  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  pilot  project,  (iii)  provide  information  to  the \nimplementing agency for decision making, (iv) supervise activities performed by consultants to \nbe engaged under the project, and (v) submit progress reports to the project management office \n                                                 \n1  2006.

The pilot project will be implemented over 3 years, starting \nin mid-2010. The pilot activity will require 1 year, then the new bus services will be annually \nmonitored and evaluated for the following 2 years. The pilot project will be undertaken in three \nphases:  (i)  preparation,  (ii)  implementation,  and  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation.  During \nimplementation of the pilot project, the following activities will be undertaken: \n(i)  review  the  outcome  of  the  pilot  projects  being  undertaken  in  the  People's \nRepublic of China and the existing regulatory framework, and draft amendments \nto the licensing regulations or new regulations as needed; \n(ii)  conduct surveys and select (a) one township and three villages, (b) bus routes to \nbe included in the village bus route license, and (c) bus stops; \n(iii)  carry  out  public  consultation  with  BCTAS  staff,  passengers,  bus  and  taxi \noperators, and civil groups to inform about the pilot project; \n(iv)  prepare  procurement  document  for  selecting  bus  service  providers,  conduct \nbidding, and select bus services providers; \n(v)  define and adjust the role and responsibilities of BCTAS; \n(vi)  monitor bus service quality for the following 2 years; \n(vii)  prepare  report  on  pilot  project  activities  including  recommendations  for \nimprovement and guidelines for replication in other parts of the province; and \n(viii)  discuss the recommendations with HPTD, BCTAS, and ADB.  \n \n6.  Extensive training will be provided for operations staff of county and provincial transport \nbureaus and potential bus service providers including private companies. ADB loan will finance \nsix seminars and/or workshops and three study tours in Xinjiang and Anhui provinces, and \nLindian county of Heilongjiang (Supplementary Appendix C). \nB.  Consulting Services \n7.  A team of national consultants, comprising one rural transport services specialist and \nteam leader (8 person-months), one bus service regulation specialist (4 person-months), and \none bus passenger survey specialist (3 person-months), will be required. The ADB loan will \nfinance national consulting services. A consulting firm will be recruited using the quality- and \ncost-based-selection method with quality and cost ratio of 90:10 using a simplified technical \nproposal. Consulting services will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). \nC.   Reporting  \n8.  Consultants will prepare an inception report, interim report, draft final report, and final \nreport. The final reports should reflect the details of activities, lessons, assessment of pilot \nproject effectiveness, and recommendations for improvements. The report should attach a copy \nof the amendment and decrees developed during the pilot project. Three copies of English and \nChinese versions of the reports will be required for ADB and HPTD, respectively.  \nD.  Cost Estimates \n9.  The cost for implementing the pilot project is estimated at $200,000 and will be financed \nby  the  ADB  loan.  This  includes  the  consultants'  expenses  ($131,100),  field  survey  cost \n($13,500),  training  cost  ($18,400),  report  preparation  and  translation  cost  ($18,800),  and \ncontingency ($18,200). ", "38  Appendix 7 \nVEHICLE EMISSION REDUCTION PLAN \n \nA.  Overview \n \n1.   The power to move a vehicle comes from burning fuel in an engine. The main products \nof the combustion process are carbon dioxide (CO ) and water, but inefficiencies and high \n2\ntemperatures  inherent  in  engine  operation  also  produce  other  byproducts  such  as \nhydrocarbons,  oxides  of  nitrogen  (NOx),  carbon  monoxide,  particulate  matter,  and  their \nchemical compounds. The emission of pollutants has global, regional, social, environmental, \nand economic impacts. Excessive greenhouse gas emissions increase global warming and \ncause climate change, NOx plays a major role in the formation of acid rain in the atmosphere, \nand particulate matter damages human health. Vehicle emissions have a direct and adverse \nimpact on health and the environment. Reducing vehicle emissions to improve air quality is an \nimportant issue that should be addressed in transport projects. \n \nB.  Reducing Vehicle Emissions \n \n2.  The  main  vehicle  pollutants  are  CO ,  carbon  monoxide,  hydrocarbons,  NOx,  and \n2\nparticulate matter. In general, vehicle emissions from individual vehicles depend on various \nfactors, including vehicle maintenance, driving behavior, and road and traffic conditions. The \nreduction of emission pollutants was estimated by comparing the case with and without the \nproject. Without the project, the traffic will continue to use the existing road, which will be more \ncongested, engines will consume more fuel and produce more pollutants as a result of slow-\nmoving traffic, inefficient stop-and-go travel, and longer engine running times. With the project, \nthe traffic will benefit from shorter distance, optimal alignment, better road condition, and less \ncongestion, which will make travel more smooth. Vehicles will operate efficiently without stop-\nand-go, which will result in lower fuel consumption and less emission of pollutants. Smooth \ntraffic flow will raise fuel efficiency on the project roads and reduce emissions. \n \n3.  The project will increase the efficiency of energy use, which will reduce vehicle emission \nper unit of transport. The estimation of vehicle emissions is based on the relationship of fuel \nconsumption, emission of pollutants, and vehicle average speed. The average fuel saving is \nestimated  at  about  260,365  tons  oil  equivalent  per  year  and  CO   reduction  is  about \n2\n282,500 tons per year. \n \n4.  The Heilongjiang provincial government is committed to adhere to the national vehicle \nemission control strategies and plans, which include (i) enforcing stricter standards by July 2010 \n(GB18352-3-2005 and GB17691-2005 that are equivalent to step IV of European Emission \nStandards);  (ii)  enforcing  vehicle  inspection  and  maintenance  programs  including \n(a) establishing annual emission checks and random roadside testing, (b) requiring emission \ncontrol devices to be repaired, updated, and installed if the vehicle can't meet the standard, \n(c) developing a quality audit system to guarantee the quality of testing and prevent fraud and \ncorruption,  (d)  upgrading  vehicle  testing  facilities,  and  (e)  promoting  awareness  regarding \nvehicle emission and fuel consumption; (iii) encouraging use of clean fuel; (iv) forcing retirement \nof vehicles based on their age and failure to pass the emission inspection test three consecutive \ntimes; and (v) encouraging retirement of old vehicles through subsidy.1 Table A7 provides an \nintegrated plan developed to help agencies reduce vehicle emissions in Heilongjiang. \n \n                                                 \n1  A subsidy of CNY6,000 was introduced on 1 September 2009.

Traffic Forecast \n \n1.  Typical  traffic  forecast methodology  was  used,  including traffic  demand  forecast,  trip \ndistribution, mode split, and traffic assignment. The traffic analysis and forecast uses 2008 as the \nbase year. The project is expected to commence in early 2010 and be completed in late 2013; \nwith the project road opening to the public in 2014. The future key years for analysis include \n2014, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, and 2033. \n \n2.  Traffic forecast. Table A12.1 shows the aggregated traffic forecast for each section of \nthe project roads in future key years. The traffic forecast result shows that future traffic on the \nproject roads will be on the growth curves. During 2014\u20132020, annual traffic increase rates will be \nabout  9.9%  for  the  Yichun\u2013Bei\u2019an  section  (expressway),  7.4%  for  Bei\u2019an\u2013Wudalianchi \n(expressway), 9.1% for Longzhen\u2013Nenjiang (class II highway), and 11.3% for Nenjiang to the \nprovincial border with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (class I road). After 2020, annual \nincrease rates of the four sections will slow down as traffic will have matured.  \n \n3.  Except for some localized gravel roads used by the timber industry transporting timber \nproducts, no direct road connection is available between Yichun and Wudalianchi. After the \ncompletion of the project road sections, the traffic between these cities will benefit from a direct \nhigh-quality road link, shortening the distance by 400 km and reducing time by 6 hours. Local \nresidents will also have much better access to the project roads. Diverted and generated traffic \nwill therefore be high on the project road sections, taking into account traffic that previously used \nindirect routes or was suppressed due to time, cost, and access concerns. \nTable A12.1: Full Traffic Forecast Result by Sections \n(PCU-AADT) \nSection  2014  2015  2020  2025  2030  2033  Average \nPCU  8,132  9,603  14,364  20,045  25,676  29,569  \u2026 \nYichun\u2013Bei'an \nAnnual increase  9.9%  6.9%  5.1%  4.8%  7.0% \nBei'an\u2013 PCU  9,517  10,665  14,619  19,322  24,225  27,645  \u2026 \nWudalianchi  Annual increase  7.4%  5.7%  4.6%  4.5%  5.8% \nLongzhen\u2013 PCU  3,927  4,523  6,631  9,200  11,410  12,933  \u2026 \nNenjiang  Annual increase  9.1%  6.8%  4.4%  4.3%  6.5% \nNenjiang\u2013Inner  PCU  4,317  5,105  8,226  11,965  16,722  20,073  \u2026 \nMongolia Border  Annual increase  11.3%  7.8%  6.9%  6.3%  8.4% \n\u2026 = not available, AADT = average annual daily traffic, PCU = passenger car unit. \nNote: Periods of annual increase rate are 2014\u20132020, 2020\u20132025, 2025\u20132030, and 2030\u20132033. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.  Methodology and alternatives. The economic assessment conducted for the project \nfollows ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.1 The evaluation period is from \nbeginning 2010 to 2033 with the period from 2010 to late-2013 representing the implementation \nperiod and the 20-year period from mid-2014 to 2033 representing the operation period for the \nproject road. Project road construction is to commence in late 2009. For all quantifiable project \ncosts and benefits, the unit of account used is the domestic price expressed in the national \ncurrency for the People's Republic of China (yuan). Four alternatives were considered for the \nproject. However, due to geographical and environmental constraints, the \u201cno action\u201d alternative \naddresses the likely consequences of not implementing the project. This alternative would work \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

Economic Costs \n5.  Economic evaluation was undertaken using 2009 prices. The prices are expressed in \nyuan, employing the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for \nforeign exchange effects. A shadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages paid \nto unskilled labor, but not on the wages paid to skilled labor, because no skilled worker surplus \nexists. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to convert the financial wage rate to an \neconomic opportunity cost of labor. The economic costs include (i) the capital cost, including \nphysical contingencies, land acquisition and resettlement, and environmental mitigation costs; \nand  (ii)  the  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  roads,  including  the  costs  of  replacing \ndepreciated  equipment.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  are  based  on  their \nopportunity costs calculated by the National Development Reform Commission's methodology \nand parameters, which is the agricultural output forgone and the relocation of displaced activities.  \nC.  Economic Benefits \n \n6.  Vehicle operating cost savings. Vehicle operating cost savings are the differences \nbetween  with-  and  without-project  cases.  The  PPK  model2  was  utilized  to  estimate  vehicle \noperating costs in both cases. Data for the PPK model were collected from pertinent sources in \nthe province. In this respect, the following data were acquired: prices of vehicles, tires, fuel and \nlubricants; maintenance labor cost, crew wages, and annual overhead cost; annual interest rate; \nand time value of passengers and freight. For each vehicle type, the model assumes specific \nparameter values describing the vehicle\u2019s configuration, engineering characteristics, operation, \nand cost. For estimation of the vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings, the international roughness \nindex is assumed to be 6 using without-project conditions and 2 using with-project conditions. \n \n7.  Time savings benefits. Using the vehicle operating speeds of the traffic assignment \nmodel, the total passenger-hours and freight ton-hours are estimated for with- and without-project \nassumptions. In estimating the time value for passengers, the following parameters are used: \n(i) the gross domestic product per capita of CNY21,727 in 2008, (ii) total working hours for \npassengers is 2,000,3 and (iii) hourly rates of CNY10.86. \n \n8.  Generated traffic benefits. The new roads will generate new traffic. The benefits of \ngenerated traffic are estimated on the basis of cost savings to generated traffic. The generated \ntraffic benefits are valued at 50% of the VOC savings used for normal and diverted traffic.  \n \n9.  Accident savings. Road traffic accidents resulted in costs of CNY150, 000 for fatalities, \nCNY 100,000 for injuries, and CNY30,000 for property damage. In 2008, the total number of road \naccidents  in  Heilongjiang  Province  was  4,538  with  1,703  fatalities  and  4,905  injuries,  this \nrepresents a decrease from 2007 of 32.57% for total number of accidents, 10.65% for fatalities, \nand 34.36% for injuries from 2007. Property damages were estimated at CNY20.06 million, a \ndecrease of 23.4%. In estimating benefits to accident reduction, cost per km was estimated at \nCNY0.04187 per vehicle-km. In the case of normal and generated traffic, 5% of the estimated \naccident cost was attributed, which was then multiplied by the annual average daily traffic and \nroad length to estimate the total accident benefits. In the case of diverted traffic, the full accident \ncost per vehicle-km was considered and then multiplied by the annual average daily traffic and \nreduced road length.  \n                                                 \n2  World Bank. 1996.

The financial analysis and projections for the project were undertaken in accordance with \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of \nProjects.1 The project has both revenue and nonrevenue components. The revenue component \nconsists of two expressway sections and a class I road section. The nonrevenue component is a \nclass II road section.  \nA.   Revenue-Earning Expressway Component of the Project \n1.  Financial Projections \n2.  After construction, expressways and the class I road will be operated and managed by \nthe Toll Roads Administration Bureau. Toll rates will be set 6 months before the opening of these \nroad sections to the public by considering cost recovery and affordability. In the province, one \nexpressway subsidizes another, resulting in different expressways having different toll rates. The \nexisting average tolls are used to assess the financial viability of the expressways (Table A13.1). \nTable A13.1: Base Year Tolls in 2009 Prices \nVehicle Class  1  2  3  4  5 \nCars and trucks by weight (ton)  <2  2\u20135  5\u201310  10\u201315 and 20  >15 and 40 \nfoot-container  foot-container \nNumber of bus seats  <7  8\u201319  20\u201339  >40   \nToll rates expressway (CNY per vehicle-km)  0.45  0.65  0.85  1.00  1.20 \nToll rates class I (CNY per vehicle-km)  0.30  0.40  0.50  0.60  0.80 \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Heilongjiang Provincial Transportation Department. \n3.  Periodic maintenance will be required every 9 years. Depreciation is calculated using a \nstraight line method with an average life of 40 years. Corporate income tax at 25% is paid on \nincome after deducting business taxes, depreciation and interest charges, operating expenses, \nand any prior year losses carried forward. \n4.  The  project  will  be  funded  38%  by  equity  (17.5%  by  the  Heilongjiang  provincial \ngovernment  and  the  rest  by  the  central  government)  and  62%  by  long-term  loans  from \nAgricultural Bank of China and ADB. ADB's financing for the expressways and class I road part \nof the overall project is $157.53 million. It will have a 25-year term including a 5-year grace \nperiod,  and  a  US dollar  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loan  with  a  0.15% \ncommitment fee. The projected financial statements (Table A13.2) indicate that forecast revenue \nunder the base assumptions is sufficient to cover annual recurrent costs, depreciation, and debt \nrepayments on ADB and domestic bank loans; and generate reasonable profits. \n2.  Financial Analysis \n5.  The major assumptions used to calculate a financial internal rate of return include (i) all \ncalculations  are  based  on  2009  prices,  covering  2010\u20132033;  (ii)  capital  costs  include  all \nincremental capital expenditures related to construction and equipment for the revenue-earning \nroads, but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) operating costs \ninclude  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  roads,  but  exclude \ndepreciation and debt payments; and (iv) a residual value equal to the net book value of capital \ninvestment. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 13  53 \n6.  The estimated real weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after-tax, in real terms, was \ncalculated using  estimated  capital  mix  and  cost  of  funds.  Costs  considered include  (i)  the \napplicable 5-year LIBOR fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.2% is used for \nADB debt, (ii) the present interest rate of 5.94% per annum is used for the domestic bank loans, \nand (iii) the opportunity cost of equity capital is assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is adjusted \nto reflect the impact of income tax of 25%. The nominal cost is converted to real cost by applying \ndomestic long-term inflation rates for local currency and international inflation rates for foreign \nexchange denominated debt. \n7.  The financial internal rate of return for the project, computed on an after-tax basis, is \n6.17% (Table A13.3), which compares favorably with the WACC, computed at an after-tax basis \nat 3.56%. The project is considered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity tests \nindicate that the project's viability will fall below the WACC in the worst case scenario where \ntraffic will fall below 20% of the forecast and the project cost will increase above 20%. However, \nsuch an event is unlikely to occur. The sensitivity of the project's financial indicators to cost and \nrevenue variations is shown in Table A13.4. \n3.  Summary Financial Results of the Revenue-Earning Road Sections \n8.  With average toll rates, the expressway section is financially viable in the long run. \nHowever, average toll rates are not sufficient to generate adequate cash flows in the first year of \noperations and the debt service coverage ratio does not reach the ADB norm of 1.2 until 2017. \nThis short-term cash flow shortage will be financed by the Heilongjiang Provincial Transportation \nDepartment (HPTD) during the early years.  \nB.  Financial Analysis Nonrevenue-Earning Components of the Project \n \n9.  Class II road sections will not earn revenue, only the two expressway sections and class \nI  road  section  are  expected  to  earn  revenue.  Other  project  components  are  (i)  road \nmaintenance, (ii) rural bus service, and (iii) institutional capacity building. ADB funds will be used \nfor these nonrevenue-earning components, including construction and/or rehabilitation of the bus \nstations. Financial evaluation of the nonrevenue-earning components focuses on fiscal impact \non the operating entity. \n10.  The financial data confirm the availability of sufficient counterpart funds and the capacity \nof  HPTD  to  finance  both  investment  in  the  project  and  future  maintenance  and  operating \nexpenses of the project roads. As the class II road will not be tolled, funds for road maintenance \nwill be provided by the fuel tax proceeds.  \n11.  The total capital required for the class II road represents only 1.5% of past annual HPTD \nrevenues. Similarly, operation and maintenance, including periodic maintenance of the class II \nroad will represent 0.8% of HPTD\u2019s historic costs for these items.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe PRC has made good progress in poverty reduction over the last 25 years, but it is still facing a big challenge in \naddressing poverty. Poor accessibility or isolation can inhibit economic and social development. The road subsector is \none of the most important areas for poverty reduction. Roads provide (i) improved access for the poor to external \nmarkets, employment opportunities, and social services; (ii) lower transport costs of agricultural inputs and produce; and \n(iii) improved interaction with other regions, thus providing opportunities to develop and exploit comparative and \ncompetitive advantages. Increased economic activities and urbanization of the project area can lead to increasing local \nemployment opportunities (e.g., commercial agriculture, eco-forestry, and other tourism).  \n \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s PRC country strategy and program,a especially pillar I of Inclusive Growth and \nBalanced Development. Under this pillar I, ADB will help the PRC build a harmonious society and boost rural \ndevelopment in areas where growth and development are lagging. The central government has a program to revitalize \nthe northeast region as an industrial hub, and the regional transport network development plan is an important \ncomponent of this program. Also, the Heilongjiang Poverty Reduction Development Regulation prioritizes transport. \n \nThe project will continue ADB's engagement with the Heilongjiang provincial government in the transport sector. It will \nprovide more reliable and safe transport services to local people, which will contribute to economic development, \nlivelihood improvement, and indirect poverty reduction. The highway will establish a direct connection between Yichun \nand Bei\u2019an, and improve transport between Wudalianchi and Nenjiang. Integrated with improving the local road network, \nthe highway will improve transport between the forestry area in east and agricultural area in west, promote trade of the \ntwo areas, and add economic value to their production of grains, nontimber forest products, and livestock, as well as \nfacilitate  the  provision  of  social  and  physical  infrastructure  services  (e.g.,  health,  education,  water,  and \ntelecommunications) to be upgraded by local government.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe poverty analysis is based on published statistical data, socioeconomic questionnaire survey of 513 households, \nfocus group discussions, and key informant interviews in the project area. Heilongjiang is an agricultural and forestry \nprovince,  and  also  a  relatively  undeveloped  province.  About  44,500  people  or  8.7%  of  the  total  population  in \n48 townships and towns along the proposed highway corridor are categorized as poverty population. Most of the rural \npoor are living in 50 poverty villages, while the rest are scattered in nonpoverty villages. Poverty is also present on the \nstate forest farms. The causes of poverty in the project area include poor quality farmland in mountainous areas, poor \nirrigation systems, poor transportation conditions, and natural disasters. In state forest farms, the main causes of poverty \nare unemployment due to the natural forest logging ban program, lack of farmland, and financial risks of marketing \nnontimber forest products.  \n \n2.  Design Features \nThe improved access afforded by the proposed highway and bus services will remove transport constraints and \ncontribute to social and economic development. In poverty villages, the project will be complemented by poverty \nreduction activities carried out by the local government, such as village road and bridge construction, water supply, \nlivestock technical services, cable TV, and employment training. During construction of the highway and bus stations, \nabout CNY6.767 billion will be invested, much of which will flow into the rural townships and towns. About 19,000 \nunskilled and skilled labors will be required during the project construction and about 790 will be required during its \noperation and maintenance.  \n \nThe Heilongjiang Provincial Transportation Department (HPTD) and the local governments have agreed to take the \nfollowing actions to enhance project benefits for the poor: (i) hiring laborers from poverty villages and households, \n(ii) providing special support for poor households affected by resettlement, (iii) integrating poverty reduction and road \nimprovement programs, (iv) providing technical training programs, and (v) promoting nonfarm employment opportunities. \n \nC.    Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n  Not applicable \n ", "  Appendix 14  57 \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nStakeholder analysis was conducted as part of the poverty and social assessment for this project. The key stakeholders \ninclude town and township residents, state farm workers, state forest workers, small businesses, adversely affected \npeople, HPTD, and the implementing agencies. Other government stakeholders include Civil Affairs Bureau, Labor, \nForestry, Poverty Reduction Office, Health Bureau, women\u2019s federation, and Religious and Minority Affairs Bureau. \nDuring project preparation, a socioeconomic survey of 513 households, stakeholder consultation workshops, focus \ngroup discussions, and key informant interviews were conducted to gain a better understanding of the demands, needs, \nand interests of the stakeholders.  \n \nThe project roads will benefit 512,000 people in 48 townships, towns, state farms, and state forest farms; the improved \nrural transport services will benefit 431,500 people in 12 townships, towns, state farms, and state forest farms. The \nwestern section of the project area is mainly a farming region, where agricultural production and profitability has been \ngood the past decade. The eastern section of the project area is mountainous and mainly forested; however, the state \nforest farms are not profitable due to the ban on logging old forests. The proposed highway will link these two areas and \nenable the local economies to become more diversified and integrated. Also, the highway will encourage more tourism \nbusinesses by linking the forest-based tourism in Yichun with tourism based on the old volcanic formation and springs in \nWudalianchi.  \n \nThe potential adverse social impacts from the project include (i) land acquisition and resettlement, (ii) increased \naccidents due to higher speeds and mixed traffic, (iii) transmissible diseases spread by the large construction workforce, \nand (iv) disruption to local communities during construction. Mitigations measures to address these issues are included \nin the resettlement plans and the social development action plan (SDAP). A few ethnic minority villages in the project \narea can benefit from the project; they will not be adversely impacted. HPTD and the local government have agreed to \ntake following actions to enhance project benefits for five ethnic minority villages: (i) integrated poverty reduction, road \nimprovement and tourism development programs, and (ii) cultural protection and development. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nPublic consultation and participation was a core element of the project design and it will continue during project \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Several rounds of public consultations in the project areas were carried out \nto prepare the environmental management plan (EMP), resettlement plans, and SDAP. The consultations included \n(i) explaining the project components; (ii) soliciting ideas, suggestions, and comments on the potential impacts of the \nproject; and (iii) presenting the findings of the analyses and the proposed social and environmental mitigation measures. \nThe results of these meetings and concerns of the affected people, particularly the poor and women were integrated into \nthe project design, EMP, resettlement plans and/or SDAP. Ongoing consultations will be carried out by the implementing \nagencies to understand and meet the evolving needs and expectations of the stakeholders, and to encourage the active \ninvolvement of local communities.  \n \n2.

Country Strategy and Program: People's Republic of China, 2007\u20132008. Manila. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "  Appendix 15  59 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n1.  Two  of  the  project  components  will  have  some  resettlement  impacts.  The  roads \ncomponent involves the construction and improvement of the 353.8 kilometers (km) of provincial \nroad between Yichun and the provincial border with Inner Mongolia, as well as three branch \nroads totaling 5.1 km. The bus service component includes the construction or upgrading of \n20 rural bus stations. The resettlement planning and implementation is designed to ensure that \naffected persons will be better-off or at least not worse-off as a result of the project. A full \nresettlement plan for the road component and a short resettlement plan for the bus service \ncomponent were prepared.   \n2.  The project will permanently acquire 1,365 hectares (ha) of land: 518.4 ha of cultivated \nland (38.0%), 642.4 ha of forestland (47.1%), and 204.1 ha of other kinds of land (14.9%). \nTemporary land use will require 134.6 ha, among which cultivated land is 51.5 ha, forestland is \n35.6 ha, and wasteland is 47.5 ha. The permanent land acquisition will affect about 3,500 \nhouseholds  or  about  14,000 people.  On  average,  only  7.5%  of  each  affected  household's \nfarmland will be acquired; most affected villages have abundant farmland. Only 10 households \nand 1 enterprise will need to be relocated. Also, some productive assets, ground attachments, \nand public infrastructure and facilities will be affected, including electric poles, cables, high \nvoltage towers, wells, fences, toilets, roads, and trees. Of the total affected population, 2,000 \nhouseholds with about 8,000 people are rural residents, and 1,500 households with about 6,000 \npeople are state farm workers and state forestry farm workers.  \n3.  Compensation for permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of the \nPeople's Republic of China (2004) and the Implementation Regulations of Integrated Price for \nLand Acquisition Based on the Region and Location of Heilongjiang province (2009). The house \ncompensation is based on negotiations with the affected people with reference to the local price \nstandards.  The  resettlement  plans  comply  with  the  People's  Republic  of  China  laws,  the \nregulations  of  Heilongjiang  province,  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). Based on consultations with local governments and affected people, \nand the integrated price in the area, the respective city and county agencies adopted a set of \ncompensation standards.  \n4.  The  resettlement  principles  established  for  the  project  are  (i)  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible by developing and \ncomparing different design alternatives; (ii) compensation and entitlements provided are based \non integrated land price or replacement value and must be adequate to allow those affected to \nmaintain at least their preproject standard of living, with the prospect of improvements; (iii) lands \ntemporarily occupied and the period for disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) the per \ncapita landholding after land acquisition will be sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood \nstandard; (v) where land allocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood \nstandards, other income-generating activities will be provided; (vi) a preferential policy will be \nprovided  to  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  the  payment  of  special  subsidies,  minimum  living \nguarantee, and employment; (vii) all people affected will be adequately informed about eligibility, \ncompensation rates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; \nand (viii) close monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to resolve any problems. \n5.  The people affected were notified of the key elements of the resettlement plan. On \nvarious  occasions  during  meetings,  interviews,  group  discussions,  public  consultation \nworkshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  participated  in  the \nplanning, and their concerns are integrated in the resettlement plan. An information booklet on \nthe  project  was  distributed  to  affected  villages  and  households  in  January  2009.  The \nresettlement  plan  was  made  publicly  available  to  forestry  farms,  state  farms,  and  affected \nvillages in September 2009. The respective cities and counties will establish project resettlement \nunits for supervising the implementation, continuing public consultation, monitoring progress, and \n ", "60  Appendix 15 \nresponding to grievances. Procedures to address grievances will be set up and explanations are \nincluded in the resettlement information booklets. \n6.  For land acquisition, generally 30% of the land compensation will be paid in cash to the \naffected villages to be used for the basic infrastructure improvement and 70% will be paid to the \naffected  households  directly.  For  residential  houses  and  nonresidential  houses  to  be \ndemolished, all compensation will be paid directly to owners. The payment will be made in cash \naccording to the appraised value of the property. Households that have to relocate will also \nreceive a relocation allowance. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and other assets \nwill also be paid directly to the affected units and households.  \n7.  The resettlement strategy has two aspects: (i) replacement of housing, and (ii) restoration \nof livelihoods and income. For people to be relocated, a new house plot for house construction \nwill be provided as well as assistance from local government to construct or find available \nhousing close to their original community as they prefer. For people who lose farmland, the \nmeasures for economic revitalization include (i) 70% of the land compensation will be paid to the \naffected  household,  which  they  can  use  to  rent  farmland  from  state  farms  nearby; \n(ii) readjustment of farmland using reserve land in villages or reassignment of land to affected \nworkers on state farms; (iii) provision of employment opportunities during the project construction \nphase; (iv) local governments will provide preferential policies for items such as credit and taxes \nto the affected people to encourage them to engage in other sectors, such as small businesses; \n(v) local governments will provide agricultural and nonagricultural skills training; and (vi) after the \ncompletion of the highway, the affected households will be given priority to be employed in \nroutine highway maintenance. The five affected county or city governments will all ensure that \nthe affected people will have priority to be trained each year and the training budget will be \nprovided by the county governments. The development opportunity derived from the project \nroads  and  compensation  for  land  acquisition  should  enable  most  households  to  increase \nnonagricultural production and improve their income. \n8.  For  the  project  highway,  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  take  overall \nresponsibility  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  PMO  will  make  payments  to  the \nHeilongjiang Provincial Land and Resources Department, which in turn will allocate funds to the \ncounty  administrations  to  make  compensation  payments  to  affected  entities,  villages,  and \nhouseholds. The city, county, farm, and forestry farm project resettlement offices will have at \nleast one full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and resettlement. They will work closely \nwith  relevant  village  officials  and  land  administration  bureaus,  and  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing and monitoring the resettlement. For the bus stations, local transport bureaus will \npay land acquisition and resettlement compensation to the county land administration bureau, \nwhich will then make payments to the affected villages, state entities, or households.  \n9.  The cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement is CNY326.7 million,1 including \nland  taxes  and  contingencies.  Implementation  of  resettlement  for  the  road  component \ncommenced  in  October  2009  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2010;  land \nacquisition for bus stations will be done in 2011.  \n10.  Internal and external monitoring of resettlement implementation will be conducted as \nspecified in the resettlement plans. Internal monitoring and supervision will be done by each \ncounty, city, farm, and forestry farm resettlement office to ensure compliance with the provisions \nof  the  resettlement  plans.  External  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  carried  out  by  an \nindependent agency under contract to the PMO. External monitoring reports will be submitted \ndirectly to Heilongjiang Provincial Transportation Department and the Asian Development Bank \non a semiannual basis the first year; annual evaluation reports will be submitted for 2 years \nthereafter. \n \n                                                 \n1  Includes CNY247,000 cost of land acquisition for the 20 bus stations. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20100329112327+08'00'", "Author": "ds4", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20100421124011+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - Draft RRP, 18 March with deletion of specific assurances.doc"}}
