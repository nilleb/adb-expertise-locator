A  summary  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment \nwas  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Board  of \nDirectors and posted on the ADB website on 14 October 2009. \n \n\nThe  project  is  located  in  the  northwest  of  Heilongjiang  province.  It \nwill  improve  the  transport  capacity  of  the  province's  East\u2013West \n2 corridor (Qiangfeng Farm\u2013Nenjiang) by completing a key missing \nsection between Yichun and Wudalianchi, improving the capacity of \nthe  existing  road  section  between  Longzhen  and  Nenjiang,  and \nconnecting  these  improved  road  sections  to  the  other  parts  of  the \nroad  network.  This  will  complete  the  Yichun\u2013Wudalianchi\u2013Harbin \ntourism  loop  connecting  prominent  tourism  destinations  for  forest \ntourism and geological scenery, and the provincial capital city.  \n\nBy optimizing the road alignment and shortening the travel distance \nby 400 km, the project will help to develop a more resource-efficient \nreduced  energy \ntransport \nconsumption,  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and \ntraffic \naccidents. \n\ninfrastructure  with \n\nsignificantly \n\nroad \n\nThe  project  will  also \nroad  connectivity  between \nHeilongjiang  and  the  neighboring  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous \nRegion  (Inner  Mongolia)  by  constructing  a  missing  link  including  a \nbridge across the Nen River.  \n\nimprove \n\nIn  addition  to  road  construction,  the  project  will  help  the  province \nestablish an improved road asset management system for selecting \nmaintenance  works  on  the  basis  of  their  expected  economic \nreturns.  It  will  support  the  institutionalizing  of  this  system  by \nfinancing  a  program  of  priority  maintenance  works  selected  using \nthe system. The project will also introduce the use of performance-\nbased maintenance contracts on a pilot basis. \n\nTo  improve  rural  village  bus  services,  the  project  will  provide \nsupport  for  reform  of  the  rural  village  bus  route  licensing  system \nand finance upgrading of 20 bus stations. \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nInner  Mongolia \nimproving \n\nThe  project  has  four  components:  component  A,  improving  the \n347.06 km  provincial  road  between  Yichun  and  the  provincial \nborder  with \nroads; \ncomponent  B, \nroad  maintenance;  component  C, \nimproving \nrural  village  bus  services;  and  component  D, \nstrengthening  of  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  Heilongjiang \nProvincial  Transportation  Department  and  other  relevant  agencies \nby providing consulting services and training. \n \n\nthree  branch \n\nincluding \n\nintegration,  and \n\nreduce  poverty.  Through \n\nHeilongjiang province needs more efficient transportation to support \neconomic growth, foster domestic and international trade, facilitate \ninterregional \nthe \nNortheast Region Development Strategy, which is the key theme of \nthe Eleventh Five-Year Plan, the PRC government aims to reduce \ndevelopment  disparities  between  the  northeastern  and  coastal \nregions.  Through  the  project  it  will  complete  an  important  missing \nlink between the northeast and northwest of Heilongjiang province.  \n \nOver  the  past  30  years,  the  government  has  given  priority  to \nexpanding  the  road  network  to  improve  connectivity.  Now  an \nimproved  system  for  maintaining  the  road  asset  base  is  needed. \nThis  requires  better  approaches  to  the  planning,  budgeting,  and \nexecution of road maintenance works, including the introduction of \nmore effective methods of maintenance contracting. \n \nEfficient  road  transport  services  are  needed  to  realize  the  full \nbenefits  of  road  infrastructure.  In  some  parts  of  Heilongjiang \nprovince,  rural  villages  lack  adequate  bus  services  in  terms  of \navailability, frequency, cost, reliability, and safety. Rural passenger \ntransport  services  can  be  improved  by  introducing  more  effective \napproaches to licensing and upgrading stations.  \n \nThe  project  is  part  of  ADB's  ongoing  policy  dialogue  in  the  PRC \ntransport  sector,  which  includes  (i) financing  new  roads  that \nconnect  major  growth  centers,  supported  by  a  system  of  local \nroads;  (ii) developing  and  improving  urban  transport  and  rural \nroads;  (iii) promoting  road  safety;  (iv)  reducing  vehicle  emissions \nand  raising  energy  efficiency;  (v) improving  commercial  orientation \nand  efficiency  of  expressway  organizations;  and  (vi) promoting \nsustainable transport.  \n \nThe project is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and \nADB's country partnership strategy for the PRC (2008\u20132010), which \nseek  to  promote  inclusive  growth  and  environmentally  sustainable \ntransport.  \n \n\nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  more  balanced  economic \ndevelopment in Heilongjiang province. The outcome will be a more \nresource-efficient,  safe,  and  environment-friendly  road  transport \nsystem in Heilongjiang province.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  investment  cost  of  the  project is  estimated  at  $998.15  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $28.59 million.  \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\niii\n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nAgricultural Bank of China   \nMinistry of Transport  \nHeilongjiang Provincial Government  \n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n200.00 \n419.70 \n203.56 \n174.89 \n998.15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n% \n20.04 \n42.05 \n20.39 \n17.52 \n100.00 \n\n \n\n \n \nA  loan  of  $200,000,000  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources  will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility.

The consultants will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB approved \nadvance recruitment on 25 September 2009.  \n \n\nthe  PRC \n\ninclude  passengers, \n\nThe  project  will  help  reduce  development  disparities  between  the \nnortheastern  and  coastal  regions  of \nto  promote \nIn  Heilongjiang \nharmonized  and  coordinated  development. \nprovince,  improved  accessibility  between  the  east  and  west  of  the \nprovince  will  provide  better  connections  to  markets  and  social \nservices. The project will directly benefit about 1.7 million people in \nthe three prefectures and five counties and cities along the project \nroads.  This  will \ntraders,  manufacturers, \ntransport providers, laborers, the local economy, private sector, and \nadministrators of the transport sector and public security.   \n \nThe  project  will  benefit  local  people  by  (i)  integrating  the  existing \nlocal  and  forest  roads  with  the  project  roads  by  building  branch \nroads and intersections, and (ii) completing a missing link between \nNenjiang  and  Inner  Mongolia.  By  completing  the  Harbin\u2013Yichun\u2013\nWudalianchi  tourism  loop,  the  project  will  bring  new  economic \nopportunities for local forest workers who have lost jobs due to the \nnational policy to preserve forest resources.  \n \nThe  economic  and  social  benefits  of  the  project  will  include \n(i) transport  cost  and  time  savings;  (ii)  road  accident  cost  savings; \n(iii) fuel  savings;  (iv)  improved  access  to  health  care  and  social \nservices;  (v)  job  opportunities;  (vi)  increased  demand  locally  for \nbuilding  materials,  construction  machinery,  and  transport  during \nconstruction; (vii) increased speed of information flow; (viii) enabling \nenvironment to attract private sector participation; and (ix) reduced \nvehicle emissions.  \n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nThe project will help Heilongjiang deliver safer and more convenient \nroad  transport  services  to  the  public  by  (i) applying  information \ncommunication  technology  to  improve  regulation,  monitoring,  and \nresponse  to  the  movement  of  people  and  goods  on  the  project \nroads;  (ii)  improving  road  maintenance;  and  (iii)  improving  rural \nvillage bus services. \n \nThe  project  will  improve  the  province\u2019s  public  sector  management \ncapacity  by  strengthening  institutional  and  staff  capacity  in  road \nmaintenance management, public transport management, and road \nsafety  management  by  (i)  providing  expertise,  training,  systems, \nand  equipment;  (ii)  developing  and/or  amending  the  regulatory \nframework  and  introducing  improved  business  processes;  and \n(iii) implementing  pilot  projects \nrural  bus  services  and \nperformance-based maintenance contracts.  \n \nThe  project  is  economically  and  financially  justified.  Its  economic \ninternal rate of return is estimated at 17.79%. The financial rate of \nreturn for the expressway and class I road is 6.17%, which is higher \nthan the real weighted average cost of capital. \n \n\nfor \n\nRisks and Assumptions  Overall, the risks associated with the project are considered low. In \npreparing the project, the financial, environmental, and social risks \nwere assessed, and mitigating measures incorporated. \n \nTo mitigate the financial risk associated with construction and initial \noperation of the expressway, HPTD will provide sufficient funding to \nbalance any shortfall in cash flow during the first year of operation. \n \nAfter  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  reflected  in  the \nenvironmental  management  plan, \nthe  adverse  environmental \nimpact due to construction will be minor. \n \nTo  mitigate  social  risks,  appropriate  measures  are  included  in  the \nresettlement  plans  and \nthe  social  development  action  plan. \nImplementation  of  these  plans  will  be  closely  monitored  by  HPG \nand reviewed by ADB. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f121  00'Eo\n\n132  00'Eo\n\nSECOND HEILONGJIANG ROAD NETWORK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nRUSSIAN   FEDERATION\n\nMohe\n\nTahe\n\nH\n\ne\n\ni\n\nl\n\no\n\nn\n\ng\n\n \n\nR\n\ni\n\nv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nHuma\n\nB\n\nBus Station\n\nProposed Project Road Sections\n\nADB--Financed Road\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nCounty\n\nHighway Port\n\nLoop Line\n\nRadial Line\n\nVertical Line\n\nHorizontal Line\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nProject Road\n(Yichun--Bei\u2019an)\n\n52  00'No\n\nI N N E R     M O N G O L I A\n\nJiagdaqi\n\nWoduhe\n\nHeihe\n\nr\ne\n\nn Riv\n\ne\nN\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n52  00'No\n\nProject Road\n(Nenjiang--Inner Mongolia)\n\nProject Road\n(Longzhen--Nenjiang)\n\nProject Road\n(Bei\u2019an--Wudalianchi)\n\nNenjiang\n\nSunwu\n\nSunwu\n\nXunke\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nNehe\n\nB\nWudalianchi\n\nBei'an\n\nKedong\n\nJiayin\n\nLongzhen\n\nB\n\nHEILONGJIANG\n\nGannan\n\nYi'an\n\nFuyu\n\nNianzishan\n\nQiqihar\n\nLindian\n\nBaiquan\n\nMingshui\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\nBB\nB\nB\nB\n\nHailun\n\nSuiling\n\nQinggang\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nTieli\n\nQing'an\n\nDaqing\n\nSuihua\n\nTailai\n\nZhaodong\n\nYichun\n\nHegang\n\nLuobei\n\nSuibin\n\nB\n\nB\n\nJiamusi\n\nTangyuan\n\nShuangyashan\n\nBaoqing\n\nSonghua R.\n\nTonghe\n\nYilan\n\nDaluomi\n\nQitaihe\n\nMishan\n\nX i n g k a i   La k e\n\nHulin\n\nDatong\n\nZhaoyuan\n\nHARBIN\n\nBinxian\n\nFangzheng\n\nJiantang\n\n.\nR\n \nn\na\nd\nu\nM\n\nLinkou\n\nJixi\n\nFuyuan\n\ng   R i v e r\n\nn\n\nH\n\ne il o\nQiangfeng Farm\n\nTongjiang\n\nFujin\n\nRaohe\n\n44  00'No\n\nHailin\n\nMudanjiang\n\nSuifenhe\n\nDongning\n\nRUSSIAN\nFEDERATION\n\n44  00'No\n\nShangzhi\n\nHailang R.\n\nJ I L I N\n\nN\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nKilometers\n\n121  00'Eo\n\nDEMOCRATIC PEOPLE\u2019S\nREPUBLIC OF KOREA\n\n132  00'Eo\n\n09-3253 HR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Second  Heilongjiang  Road  Network \nDevelopment Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  PRC  has  achieved  rapid  economic  growth;  gross  domestic  product  growth  has \nexceeded  9.0%  per  year  since  the  1980s.  Sustained  economic  growth  has  resulted  in  an \nunprecedented  expansion  of  traffic  between  and  within  provinces.  The  economy\u2019s  changing \nstructure  and  increasing  diversification  have  altered  the  pattern  of  transport  demand.  The \nmovement of goods and passengers by road, which is more flexible and responsive to market \nneeds than other modes of transport, is increasing rapidly.  \n \nPropelling  the  country\u2019s  robust  growth  and  rapid  poverty  reduction  were  massive \n3. \ninvestments in roads. As a result, by the end of 2006, a total of 3.457 million kilometers (km) of \nroads  were  opened  to  traffic;  100%  of  counties,  98.3%  of  townships,  and  86.4%  of \nadministrative  villages  were  connected  by  roads.  At  the  end  of  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan,  the \ntotal length of expressways reached 45,300 km, class I highways 45,300 km, class II highways \n262,700  km,  class  III  highways  354,700  km,  class  IV  highways  1,574  million  km,  and \nunclassified roads 1,174 million km. The government\u2019s policy for road subsector, as reflected in \nthe Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), calls for (i)  construction of 38,000 km of new roads \nto  bring  the  total  length  of  expressways  to  65,000 km;  (ii)   completion  of  the  35,000  km \nNational Trunk  Highway  System;  and  (iii)  completion  of  the  7,918  km  network1 reflected  in  the \nWestern Region Development Plan. \n \nEven  though  rural  roads  play  a  significant  role  in  poverty  reduction,  the  rural  road \n4. \nnetwork, which accounts for 85% of the country\u2019s total road network, is underdeveloped in both \naccessibility and technical standards. Thus, the 30 million rural poor face significant challenges \nin  relation  to  transport.  Many  live  in  isolated  villages,  thereby  restricting  their  access  to  basic \ngoods and services. Most rural roads, especially in western PRC, are in poor condition due to \nlimitations  in  design,  construction,  and  inadequate  maintenance;  and  damage  caused  by \noverloaded  vehicles.  The \nlow:  only  11%  are \nclass III highways  or  above.  Village  roads  are  even  worse,  with  only  2%  of  class  III  or  above. \nOnly  20%  of  county  roads,  15%  of  township  roads,  and  9%  of  village  roads  are  paved.  About \n71%  of  rural  roads  are  dirt  roads  that  serve  many  townships  and  villages.  These  have  no \ndrainage system, making them unsuitable for motorized traffic and impassable during the rainy \nseason,  preventing  the  rural  poor  from  taking  advantage  of  jobs  created  by  economic  growth. \nThe  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  assigns  high  priority  to  rural  road  development  to  promote \neconomic growth and reduce poverty in rural areas. At the beginning of 2005, the government \nlaunched  a  Rural  Road  Construction  Program  aiming  that  by  2010  paved  roads  will  link  all \neastern  villages,  80%  of  the  central  villages,  and  90%  of  western  villages.  The  government \nplans to complete 1.2 million km of rural roads under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. \n \n5. \nIn  the  past  30  years,  the  government  has  provided  enormous  investment  for  the \nconstruction  of  national  and  provincial  trunk  highway  networks.  Substantial  funds  have  been \nused for rural road development. However, funding for road maintenance has been inadequate. \n\ntechnical  standards  of \n\nthe  roads  are \n\n                                                 \n1  7,918  km  network  includes  7  expressways  radiating  from  Beijing,  9  north\u2013south  expressways,  and  18  east\u2013west \n\nexpressways. \n\n\f 2 \n\nIn  recent  years,  road  development  has  been  funded  mainly  by  domestic  banks,  local \ngovernments and Ministry of Transport grants. Expressways and class I highways are expected \nto  cover  their  operating  and  maintenance  costs  and  debt  service  charges  from  toll  revenues. \nDomestic  debt  has  been  increasingly  used  to  finance  expressways  and  other  road  projects, \nrepaid  from  toll  revenues.  On  1  January  2009,  the  State  Council  introduced  a  new  policy  to \nimplement collection of a fuel tax and abolish the collection of road maintenance fees and five \nother  transportation  fees.  The  consumption  tax  levied  as  part  of  the  fuel  price  was  increased \nfrom CNY0.2 to CNY1.0 per liter for gasoline, and from CNY0.1 to CNY0.8 per liter for diesel. \nRevenues from the fuel tax are expected to be allocated initially to each province in proportion to \ntheir 2007 vehicle maintenance fee revenues.  \n \n6. \nIn addition to the construction and maintenance of road infrastructure, the improvement \nof transport services for passengers and goods is an important part of improving rural transport. \nIn 2008, the number of passengers traveling by roads reached 1,247.6 billion passenger-km, an \nincrease  of  54.0%  of  total  transport  by  all  modes,  while  the  volume  of  goods  transported \nreached 3,286.8 billion ton-km, an increase of 12.3%. The government has been giving priority \nto  improving  rural  passenger  transport.  By  the  end  of  2008,  about  99.2%  of  townships  and \n92.8% of administrative villages had regular bus services. The services are mainly provided by \nprivate  transport  companies  and  based  on  market  needs.  However,  villages  with  fewer \npassengers  often  lack  adequate  bus  services.  Appropriate  government  policies  are  needed  to \nregulate rural village bus services and improve bus service quality. \n \n7. \nThe  government  recognizes  the  importance  of  road  safety  and  has  been  implementing \nvarious initiatives and programs including the National Road Safety Law, approved in 2004. This \nhas  resulted  in  a  decrease  of  the  fatality  rate  per  10,000  vehicles  from  10.2  in  2004  to  5.1  in \n2007. 2 However,  this  rate  is  still  relatively  high  when  compared  with  developed  countries. 3 \nTherefore,  in  2008,  the  government  formulated  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Action \nPlan for Road Traffic Safety to reduce the road traffic fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles to 3\u20134, the \nrate  prevailing  in  other  middle-income  countries.  The  PRC  design  standards  are  still  lacking \nsome  components  for  road  safety.  The  government  needs  to  adopt  a  more  advanced  road \nsafety  design  concept  in  the  engineering  design,  such  as  providing  clear  zones,  guiderail  end \ntreatment,  and  guiderail  to  bridge  transition.  Good  practices  and  policies  are  needed  for \nenforcing traffic regulation to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads. \n\n8. \nHeilongjiang, a landlocked province in the extreme northeast of the PRC, is bordered by \nthe Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Inner Mongolia) in the west, the Russian Federation in \nthe north and east, and Jilin province in the south. With an area of 454,000 square kilometers \n(km2),  it  is  the  sixth largest  province,  with  a  population  of  38.2  million  and  per  capita  gross \ndomestic  product  of  CNY18,478  in  2008.  Heilongjiang  has  fertile  land  and  abundant  natural \nresources.  The  province  was  an  industrial  base  before  the  1980s;  its  main  sectors  are \npetroleum, coal, power plant equipment, metallurgy, heavy machinery, steel, timber, and wood. \nTrade plays an important role in the province\u2019s economy; international and domestic demand for \nits products has consistently risen. However, since the 1980s Heilongjiang has fallen behind the \ncoastal provinces. In 1982, its per capita gross domestic product was about the same as that of \nthe coastal provinces (Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang); by 2008, it had dropped to 50%.  \n \n9. \nThe transport network of Heilongjiang includes railways, highways, waterways, aviation, \nand pipelines. It is centered around Harbin, connecting to regional cities as nodes, and radiating \nto  border  areas.  The  road  network  is  relatively  underdeveloped.  In  2007,  only  7.1%  of  the \n                                                 \n2   J. Scales. 2008. China Road Traffic Safety: The Achievements, the Challenges, and the Way Ahead.

Washington, DC: World Bank.    \n\n3  The  fatality  rate  per  10,000  vehicles  is  1.2  in  Australia,  1.0  in  Japan,  1.0  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  1.8  in  the \n\nUnited States. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nnetwork consisted of high standard roads (above class II); the national average was 15.5%. The \nprovince  has  1,044  km  of  expressways,  1,435  km  of  class  I  highways,  7,443 km  of  class  II \nhighways,  33,207  km  of  class  III  road,  50,883  km  of  class  IV  roads,  and  46,897  km  of \nunclassified  roads.  The  road  density  of  31  km  per  hundred  km2  is  lower  than  the  country\u2019s \naverage  of  37.24 km.  To  support  future  socioeconomic  development,  Heilongjiang  approved  a \n3-year plan for speeding up road development during 2008\u20132010. It is investing CNY90 billion to \ndevelop 2,207 km of expressways, 731 km of class I highways, 3.252 km of class II highways, \nand 60,799 km of rural roads. It aims to provide road access to all administrative villages by the \nend of 2010. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Constraints \n\n \n10. \nDespite huge investment, the PRC road network still does not provide all-weather access \nto large parts of the country, particularly the poorer inland regions, and is not sufficient to sustain \neconomic  growth.  Expanding  demand  for  road  transport  has  strained  road  infrastructure,  as \nmanifested  by  missing  links  and  bottlenecks  in  the  network.  The  resulting  high  cost  of \ntransporting goods between inland provinces and ports has been a serious constraint for inland \nprovinces,  including  Heilongjiang.  In  Heilongjiang,  the  road  network  is  concentrated  around \nHarbin, and the roads serving the far north, east, and west still need to be improved. Due to lack \nof  road  network  connectivity  and  the  low  technical  standard  of  the  roads,  the  transport  cost  is \nhigh and the access to the remote rural hinterland is one of the main constraints for rural poverty \nreduction. \n \n11. \nNatural resources and industrial production in the province are geographically dispersed. \nXiaoxinganling  mountain  provides  a  barrier  to  developing  an  adequate  transport  corridor \nbetween  the  northeast  and  northwest  part  of  the  province.  Sanjiang  Plain,  a  major  agricultural \nand  coal  mining  area,  is  located  in  the  northeast,  while  Harbin\u2013Daqing\u2013Qiqihar,  a  center  for \nheavy  industries  and  the  Songnen  Plain  farming  area  are  located  in  the  west  and  northwest. \nTwo  prominent  tourism  destinations,  Wudalianchi  and  Yichun,  are  located  in  the  northwest. \nCurrently,  travelers  have  to  take  a  long  detour  via  Harbin  to  reach  Wudalianchi  and  Yichun. \nRoad  transport  between  the  east  and  west  is  therefore  costly,  inefficient  in  use  of  natural \nresources, and involves high consumption of fuel, greenhouse gas emissions, and a high road \ntraffic  accident  toll.  This  is  a  constraint  for  socioeconomic  development  and  for  reducing \ndevelopment disparities in the province.  \n \nIn  the  past,  the  province  focused  on  expanding  the  road  asset  base,  and  gave  less \n12. \nattention to addressing road maintenance requirements. Though the road length has increased, \nparts of the network are getting old, and road condition is deteriorating due to lack of adequate \nmaintenance. The maintenance backlog has created a need for expensive road improvements \nsuch  as  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  Periodically  assessing  road  condition,  maintaining  a \nroad database, and planning road maintenance works based on the updated road database are \nessential  for  timely  execution  of  maintenance  work.  This  will  help  to  avoid  expensive  road \nimprovements  and  make  optimal  use  of  available  maintenance  funds.  Currently,  Heilongjiang \ndoes  not  have  a  systematic  approach  for  updating  the  road  database  and  for  planning  road \nmaintenance works. To minimize further deterioration of the aging road asset base and preserve \nthe  newly  built  road  infrastructure,  the  province  has  decided  to  introduce  a  road  asset \nmanagement system (RAMS) for planning and prioritizing road maintenance works.  \n \n13. \nimplements \nmaintenance  works  through  its  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Highway  Bureau  (HPHB).  HPHB  is \nrelatively  inefficient  in  managing  and  undertaking  maintenance  works.  It  has  29,158  staff \n\nThe  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Transportation  Department \n\n(HPTD) \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nresponsible  for  approximately  13,165  km  of  national  and  provincial  roads,  which  amounts  to \napproximately  2.8  persons/km,  much  higher  than  in  developed  countries  (the  ratio  is  0.3  in \nAustralia and 0.02 in British Columbia, Canada). HPHB uses road maintenance contracting on a \nlimited  basis  for  some  periodic  maintenance.  Most  routine  maintenance  works  are  undertaken \nthrough  force-account  work  by  HPHB  and  local  highway  bureaus.  The  province  needs  to \nstreamline  its  organization  and  improve  its  approach  to  undertaking  and  supervising  road \nmaintenance works. It recognizes that a contract-based approach to maintenance would better \nuse  human  resources,  improve  operating  efficiency,  and  deliver  better  quality  maintenance \nworks. \n \n14. \nHeilongjiang  implemented  fuel  tax  reform  in  January  2009.  This  included  removing \nexisting  tolls  on  class  II  highways  and  receiving  fuel  tax  proceed  funds  from  the  central \ngovernment. The maintenance needs of the province are expected to be supported by applying \nthe RAMS. Heilongjiang received $385 million for road maintenance in 2007, and is expecting to \nreceive $600 million in 2010. Successful RAMS implementation is essential to help the province \njustify the receipt of adequate funding for undertaking proper road maintenance. \n \nRoad  safety  remains  a  major  issue  in  Heilongjiang.  In  2008,  road  traffic  accidents \n15. \nresulted in 1,703 fatalities and 4,905 injuries. The direct property loss was CNY20.1 million. In \n2007, the number of fatalities per 10,000 vehicles was 6.34; the national average was 5.1. The \nprovince  experiences  a  long  winter,  with  snow  coverage  for  about  120 days.  About  10%  of \naccidents  are  due  to  the  presence  of  ice  and  snow  on  roads  because  of  inadequate  snow \nclearance.  Due  to  poor  knowledge  of  traffic  regulations  and  use  of  unsafe  vehicles  in  rural \nareas,  the  elderly,  women,  and  children  are  often  the  victims  of  road  traffic  accidents.  Other \nfactors  contributing  to  road  accidents  are  inadequate  road  design,  improper  traffic  safety \ndevices,  poor  knowledge  of  traffic  regulation,  and  lack  of  enforcement  of  road  safety  law  and \nregulation. Timely and effective emergency rescue and first aid mechanisms are also lacking.  \n\n16. \nThe  Heilongjiang  provincial  government  (HPG)  is  taking  steps  to  improve  road  safety, \nsuch  as  (i)  introducing  road  safety  auditing  at  the  design  and  completion  stages  of  roads, \n(ii) increasing  public  awareness  of  traffic  regulations,  (iii)  improving  winter  road  maintenance, \nand (iv) strengthening measures to enforce road safety law and regulations. In 2007, it issued \nthe Heilongjiang Road Traffic Safety Regulations4 and established new requirements for drivers, \nvehicles,  roads,  pedestrians,  accident  treatment,  and  monitoring  of  legal  responsibilities. \nHowever, issues such as traffic regulation enforcement, overloaded vehicles, restriction of use \nof  unregistered  and  unsafe  vehicles,  improvement  of  road  user  behavior,  and  provision  of \neffective  emergency  response  measures  still  must  be  addressed.  Advanced  technologies  and \nmethods used in developed countries could be introduced to improve road safety.   \n\n17. \nThe province has been making efforts to improve rural transport services for passengers \nand goods, and aims to provide bus services to all but 40 administrative villages by 2009. It has \nbeen improving county rural bus services, and recently financed a pilot project in Lindian county \nthat included (i) deregulation of certain requirements such as cancelling the conventional \u201cfixed \nstops, fixed routings, and fixed schedule\u201d; (ii) issuing area licenses so that buses can operate on \nany  route  within  an  area;  and  (iii)  introducing  chartered  vehicles  to  provide  door-to-door \nservices. These measures are helping to improve county transport services.  \n \n18. \nHowever,  in  rural  and  remote  areas,  the  quality  of  village  bus  services  is  inadequate, \nparticularly  in  villages  with  small  populations.  Most  rural  bus  service  providers  are  small \ncompanies  or  individuals;  and  lack  of  competition,  overpricing,  and  overloading  are  prevalent. \nThe use of old vehicles without proper maintenance is a safety hazard. When accidents occur, \n\n                                                 \n4  Heilongjiang Provincial Government. 2007. Heilongjiang Province Road Traffic Safety Regulations. Heilongjiang.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nneither service providers nor victims are adequately compensated due to lack of enforcement of \ninsurance policies and guidelines. Service frequency is very low and the average trip distance is \nlong. Because of the low travel demand and long travel distance, bus operators have difficulty \nmaking  profits.  These  various  problems  are  therefore  an  obstacle  to  safe,  convenient,  and \ncomfortable mobility of rural people between villages and townships; and limit the benefit gained \nfrom  infrastructure  investments.  The  province  needs  improved  arrangements  for  village  bus \nservices and mechanisms to encourage private operators to provide rural village bus services. \nThe road subsector analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n\n2. \n\nGovernment and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n\n19. \nThe  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  emphasizes  balanced,  equitable,  and  sustainable \ndevelopment. The government is seeking to increase farmers' incomes, improve infrastructure, \nand enhance public services in the countryside. Transport development is a high priority as it is \nconsidered essential for promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. Starting in 2004, the \ncentral  government  has  been  making  efforts  to  revitalize  the  northeast  region,  including \nHeilongjiang province, as an industrial hub. Part of its approach is to provide improved transport \ninfrastructure to reduce the transport disadvantages faced by the region. The project will support \nthese efforts.  \n \nThe  theme  of  the  PRC  country  partnership  strategy  for  2008\u20132010 5  of  the  Asian \n20. \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  is  mainstreaming  inclusive  growth  and  environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment. The project will contribute to the strategy, in particular to its main strategic pillars \nof  inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  resource  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability, and support for enabling the environment for private sector participation.   \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment Coordination \n\n21. \nThe PRC transport sector has been receiving considerable external assistance. ADB has \nextended  assistance  to  the  central  and  western  provinces  and  the  old  industrial  areas  in  the \nnortheast.  It  has  provided  40  loans  totaling  about  $8.07  billion  to  finance  the  construction  of \nabout 17,088.8 km of roads. Since 1991, 32 advisory technical assistance (TA) projects totaling \n$18.8 million have been provided for roads to strengthen institutions for highway operation and \nmanagement,  improve  road  safety  and  rural  transport  services,  improve  design  standards, \ndeploy information technology, develop human resources, develop urban transport, and mitigate \nadverse  impacts.  The  World  Bank  has  provided  about  $9.4  billion  and  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  about  \u00a5195.0  billion  to  finance  road  investments.  The  European \nInvestment Bank and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement provided \u20ac85 million of cofinancing \nfor  road  projects  in  the  southwestern  region  of  the  PRC.  ADB  coordinates  with  these \norganizations to discuss progress and issues in the sector, and meets regularly with the World \nBank  for  coordination  and  information  sharing.  A  summary  of  development  coordination  is  in \nAppendix 3.  \n\n4. \n\nLessons  \n\nADB  has  financed  three  road  projects  in  Heilongjiang.6 The  first  two  were  implemented \n22. \nsuccessfully  and  the  third  is  currently  under  implementation.  These  projects  have  helped  to \nstrengthen  HPTD  capacity  in  project  management  and  administration.  The  project  design \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2008.

ADB has been responsive to the high priority of the \ngovernment  to  build  national,  local,  and  rural  roads,  especially  in  the  central,  western,  and \nnortheastern  provinces.  However,  as  the  road  network  becomes  better  developed,  the \ngovernment will need to improve its approach to managing and financing road maintenance in \norder  to  sustain  the  road  infrastructure.  The  project  responds  to  the  government's  emerging \nneed to address existing weaknesses in road maintenance. \n\n24. \nTraffic  projection  and  adoption  of  lower-capacity  design  standard.  International \nfinancial institutions have found that in the PRC, roads tend to be overdesigned compared with \nthe  capacity  required  to  serve  the  traffic.  The  project  design  has  addressed  this  issue.  Traffic \nforecasts  and  the  origin  and  destination  network  were  carefully  prepared,  economic  analysis \nwas  done  separately  for  each  road  section  with  different  traffic  volumes,  and  different  road \nclassifications were selected to meet the expected traffic volume.  \n\nTransport  network  connectivity.  Despite  building  major  roads  in  each  province,  the \n25. \nissue of connectivity with neighboring provinces was not always adequately addressed. This has \nbeen  taken  into  account  in  preparing  the  project  by  including  construction  of  a  missing  link \nbetween Nenjiang and the border with Inner Mongolia.  \n\n26. \nRoad safety. Based on recent studies of road accidents, the World Health Organization \npredicts that, globally, road traffic injuries will rise to become the fifth leading cause of death by \n2030.8 It has drawn attention to the need to (i) emphasize road safety when decisions are made \nabout  road  infrastructure  and  transport  services,  and  (ii)  improve  and  sustain  enforcement  of \nroad  safety  laws.  In  the  past,  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  PRC  have  helped  the  government \nimprove  road  safety  by  strengthening  collaboration  between  different  agencies,  applying \ninformation  technology  for  monitoring  road  and  traffic  conditions,  and  optimizing  road  designs. \nADB  continues  to  provide  support  to  strengthen  these  measures  in  ADB-financed  investment \nprojects and has assisted the government by providing TA support for road safety improvement. \nImportant  lessons  from  these  interventions  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design,  including \nimproving  road  design  and  enforcement  of  traffic  law,  and  increasing  rural  community \nawareness of traffic regulations to prevent accidents.  \n\n27. \nTransport services. Efficient transport services are essential to maximize the benefit of \ntransport  infrastructure  investments  and  enhance  contributions  to  poverty  reduction.  ADB  has \nprovided  several  TA  projects  for  integrating  transport  services  as  part  of  investment  projects. \nThe recommendations of these TAs are integrated in the project design. In particular, the TA for \nSustainable Rural Transport Services provides a model for village bus transport services reform \nand pilot projects.  \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n28. \nThe project is part of ADB's ongoing policy dialogue with the government on (i) improving \ntransport  connectivity,  efficiency,  and  sustainability;  (ii)  improving  the  regulatory  framework \ngoverning rural road transport services; (iii) promoting information technologies; (iv) addressing \nissues  such  as  greenhouse  gas  emission,  fuel  efficiency,  and  road  safety;  (v) strengthening \ninstitutional  development;  and  (vi)  facilitating  private  sector  participation.  The  policy  dialogue \nmatrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n\n                                                 \n7   SAPE recommended that ADB should be responsive to changing needs in road subsector in the PRC. \n8  World Health Organization. 2009.

The  road  alignment \nwas revised to avoid one national and two provincial nature reserves. The project will construct \nexpressway and class I and II highways to minimize acquisition, match capacity with expected \ntraffic, and achieve high economic returns.  \n \nADB  had  a  dialogue  with  the  central  and  provincial  governments  on  road  asset \n30. \nsustainability  in  Heilongjiang.  This  included  discussions  on  (i)  efforts  to  improve  road \nmaintenance planning; (ii) the process for planning, budgeting, and implementing maintenance \nworks;  and  (iii)  the  capacity  of  HPHB,  which  is  responsible  for  maintaining  national  and \nprovincial  road  assets.  In  1991,  the  government  developed  the  China  Pavement  Management \nSystem,  but  its  use  by  provinces  is  limited  due  to  (i) absence  of  corporate  commitment  by \ngovernment agencies, (ii) limited funding, (iii) difficulty in operating the system, and (iv) lack of \ncapacity. Several new regulations and procedures have been issued for managing road assets, \nand the government asked the Research Institute of Highway to develop a new system. In 2008, \nthe  research  institute  developed  the  RAMS,  which  is  based  on  the  latest  technology  and \nsoftware,  is  user  friendly,  and  uses  the  geographic  information  system.  To  facilitate  easy  and \nreliable  data  collection  for  the  RAMS,  the  Research  Institute  of  Highway  has  also  produced  a \nspecial  vehicle  for  road  condition  data  collection.  Heilongjiang  received  the  RAMS  and  the \nspecial  vehicle  in  December  2009.  The  project  will  help  Heilongjiang  to  introduce  the  RAMS, \nand institutionalize the improved system.  \n\nAn  assessment  was  conducted  on  the  need  to  extend  bus  services  to  townships  and \n31. \nvillages.  The  findings  of  ADB-financed  TA 9  and  lessons  from  a  pilot  project  financed  by \nHeilongjiang province to provide more flexible user needs-based services in Lindian county were \ndiscussed.  Needs  were  identified  to  extend  bus  services  to  villages;  to  develop  governing \ndocuments to enforce implementation of government directives, guidelines, and procedures for \nproviding safe, reliable, and affordable village bus services; and to help the province encourage \nprivate  sector  participation  to  provide  rural  village  bus  services.  This  resulted  in  including \nsupport for village bus services within the project. \n \n32. \nDuring  project  preparation,  the  need  for  improved  institutional  arrangements  of  the \nprovincial government agencies to meet the new functions and required skill was assessed. The \nproject  will  produce  recommendations  for  realigning  the  highway  maintenance  organization  of \nHeilongjiang  and  provide  capacity  building  support  for  provincial  government  staff  and  the \nprivate  sector  of  the  province  in  managing  and  delivering  road  maintenance  and  rural  bus \nservices.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  Services. \nManila.  The  TA  provided  the  following  recommendations  to  improve  rural  bus  services:  (i)  revise  and  update \npolicies  on  licensing  and  regulation  for  rural  buses,  routes,  operators,  and  bus  terminals  to  encourage  more \ndemand-responsive, township-based operations for providing more flexible and efficient services based on user\u2019s \nneeds; and (ii) clarify the role and strengthen the capacity of the county road transport administrations in relation to \nthe recommended regulatory changes. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n33. \nThe impact of the project will be more balanced economic development in Heilongjiang \nprovince.  The  outcome  will  be  a  more  resource-efficient,  safe,  and  environment-friendly  road \ntransport system in Heilongjiang province. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n34. \nThe project outputs will be (i) 347.06 km of improved road infrastructure in the provincial \nEast\u2013West 2 corridor, (ii) improved road maintenance in the province, (iii) improved bus services \nin  Bei'an  county,  and  (iv)  strengthened  institutional  capacity.  These  will  be  delivered  by \nimplementing four project components:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nComponent  A: Improving  road  infrastructure. The project will (a) construct a \n206.26  km  four-lane  expressway  between  Yichun  and  Wudalianchi  (163.67 km \nbetween  Yichun  and  Bei'an  East  and  42.59  km  between  Bei'an  West  and \nWudalianchi),  (b) upgrade  a  127.92  km  gravel  road  between  Longzhen  and \nNenjiang to class II highway, (c) complete the new 12.88 km class I road between \nNenjiang and the provincial border with Inner Mongolia including the extra large \nNen River Bridge, and (d) build three class I and III branch roads with combined \nlength  of  4.33  km.  The  project  road  technical  details  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n\nComponent  B:  Improving  road  maintenance.  The  project  will  introduce  the \nRAMS  to  support  road  maintenance  planning  and  budgeting,  institutionalize  the \nimproved  road  maintenance  planning  by  financing  a  program  of  priority  road \nmaintenance works at an estimated cost of $50 million, and introduce on a pilot \nbasis the use of performance-based maintenance contracts for road maintenance \nworks (Appendix 5).  \n\nComponent C: Improving rural village bus services. The project will introduce \nuser  needs-based  bus  services  in  the  three  villages  of  Bei'an  county  by \nimplementing  a  pilot  project  for  bus  route  licensing  reform  (Appendix  6).  The \nproject will also construct 16 new bus stations and rehabilitate 4 bus stations in \nfour counties and three prefectures (Supplementary Appendix B). \n\nComponent  D: Strengthening  institutional  capacity. The project will develop \na proposal for realigning the provincial highway bureau to meet the new functions \nto manage the road database, and planning and budgeting of maintenance works \nusing  the  RAMS.  It  will  improve  staff  capacity  through  training  in  road \nmaintenance  planning  and  execution,  winter  road  maintenance  and  emergency \nresponse,  road  safety,  rural  bus  services,  advanced  construction  technologies, \nand  use  of  information  technology  in  road  and  traffic  condition  monitoring \n(Supplementary Appendix C). \n\n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n35. \nThe  project  will  introduce  best  practices,  approaches,  knowledge,  and  expertise  to \nprovincial  transport  administrators  and  beneficiaries  to  ensure  the  road  transport  system  is \nadministered in an effective and sustainable manner. \n  \n36. \nPromoting regional integration and resource optimization. The project is designed to \npromote  more  balanced  economic  development  in  Heilongjiang  by  enhancing  interprovincial \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nEnsuring  transport \n\nIntroducing  flexible  village  bus  services.  Drawing  upon \n\nconnectivity between Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, and linking isolated parts of the province \nwith  more  developed  areas,  thereby  promoting  economic  integration,  expanding  access  to \neconomic  opportunities for  the  rural  poor,  enhancing  mobility  of  residents,  and  attracting  more \ninvestment  to  the  hinterland.  The  project  will  support  resource  conservation  by  shortening  the \ntravel  distance  by  400  km  and,  in  doing  so,  significantly  reducing  energy  consumption, \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and road accidents.  \n \n37. \ninfrastructure  sustainability.  Adequate  road  maintenance \nplanning and execution is essential to ensure safe and comfortable road services to road users. \nThe project will assist Heilongjiang in introducing and institutionalizing the RAMS by (i) collecting \nand inputting road condition data into the RAMS, (ii) preparing annual maintenance plans using \nthe RAMS and selecting priority maintenance works on the basis of estimated economic returns, \n(iii) developing  a  performance-based  maintenance  contract  document  including  specifications, \n(iv) implementing  priority  maintenance  works  over  3  years,  and  (v) developing  a  proposal  for \nrealigning  the  provincial  highway  bureau  to  meet  the  new  functions  associated  with  the \nimproved road maintenance process. The improved road maintenance planning and budgeting \nwill  provide  a  mechanism  to  utilize  fuel  tax  proceeds  efficiently  and  in  a  more  sustainable \nmanner.  It  will  also  lead  to  a  more  predictable  pipeline  of  maintenance  works,  which  will  help \nHeilongjiang  to  attract  private  sector  participation  for  maintenance  contracts  and  concessions, \nand to improve work quality.  \n \nthe  experience  of \n38. \nimplementing  the  reforms  recommended  by  the  ADB  TA  on  improving  rural  bus  services  in \nvarious  provinces  of  the  PRC,  and  best  practices  gained  from  Lindian  county,  the  project  will \nintroduce  user  needs-based  bus  services  on  a  pilot  basis  in  three  administrative  villages  of \nBei'an  county.  Bei'an  has  experience  in  providing  county  bus  services;  however  under  this \nproject  its  capacity  for  providing  safe  and  reliable  village  bus  services  will  be  strengthened. \nBei'an  comprises  62  administrative  villages\u201420  do  not  have  formal  bus  services.  The  pilot \nproject  will  help  Bei'an  (i) protect  the  public  interest  by  introducing  village  bus  route  licensing \nreform, maintaining reasonable fares, and ensuring  vehicles are in good condition; (ii) improve \nconditions for bus service providers to operate profitably; and (iii) improve its capacity to monitor \nbus  service  demand  and  make  the  information  available  to  bus  service  providers  and  bus \noperators.  The  pilot  project  will  be  implemented  in  three  phases:  (i) preparation  (collect  and \nreform); \nregulations  and  procedures,  and \nanalyze  data,  develop \n(ii) implementation (recruit bus service providers; train government managers, service providers, \nvehicle  operators,  and  other  relevant  personnel;  and  introduce  bus  services  on  a  pilot  basis); \nand  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation  (conduct  monitoring,  assess  effectiveness,  and  prepare \nevaluation report including guidance for improvement and replication). To encourage private bus \nservice  providers,  the  government  will  select  a  bus  service  provider  through  open  bidding \namong private and county public bus services providers. \n \n39. \nEnhancing  road  safety.  To enhance road safety, the project will improve the behavior \nof rural and forest farm road users, and strengthen the provincial traffic law enforcement process \nby  (i) implementing  public  awareness  programs  on  road  traffic  regulation,  and  (ii) training \ntechnical and managerial staff on best practices in enforcing traffic safety law and regulations. \nDuring project preparation, a road  safety audit was undertaken on the preliminary design, and \nroad  safety  enhancement  measures  were  recommended.  The  project  will  provide  consulting \nservices to ensure that these recommendations are adequately incorporated during construction \nof the project roads.    \n\nformulate  pilot \n\n40. \nPromoting  intelligent  transport  system. The use of an intelligent transport system is \nbuilt  into  the  project  and  includes  (i)  advanced  toll  payment;  (ii)  variable  message  displays  to \nimprove  driver  information;  (iii)  use  of  surveillance  technology,  and  detection  of  black  spot \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nlocations  and  weather  conditions;  (iv)  monitoring  of  speed  limit,  overloaded  vehicles,  and  toll \npayment;  and  (v) provision  of  real-time  information  on  road  and  traffic  conditions.  This  will \nstrengthen traffic management and enhance road safety. \n\n41. \nReducing  vehicle  emissions.  Rapid  motorization  has  led  to  increased  vehicle \nemissions  and  air  pollution  in  Heilongjiang.  Through  the  project,  an  integrated  plan  has  been \ndeveloped to help agencies in Heilongjiang reduce vehicle emissions (Appendix 7); the plan will \nbe  implemented  and  monitored  by  Heilongjiang  Environmental  Protection  Bureau.  The  plan \nincludes  (i)  regulating \ntesting, \n(iii) implementing  a  vehicle  inspection  and  maintenance  program,  and  (iv)  introducing  tax \nincentives for manufacturers of environment-friendly cars. The project will directly decrease air \npollution  as  (i)  vehicle  emissions  on  the  project  roads  are  expected  to  be  lower  because  of \nbetter  traffic  flow  and  increased  efficiency  of  energy  use,  and  (ii)  travel  distance  will  be \nshortened by 400 km. Consequently, carbon dioxide emissions will be reduced by 5.65 million \ntons cumulatively in the first 20 years after completion of the project roads.  \n\nindustry,  (ii)  requiring  annual  vehicle \n\nthe  automobile \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe project investment cost is estimated at $998.15 million, including taxes and duties of \n\n42. \n$28.59 million (Table 1).

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  and  project  agreements.  The \ngovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.  \n \n44. \nThe ADB loan will finance 20.04% of the project cost, including the financing charges on \nthe  ADB  loan  during  implementation.  Agricultural  Bank  of  China  will  finance  $419.70  million \n(CNY2.86  billion  or  42.05%)  of  the project  cost  on  a  20-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of \n4 years,  at  an  interest  rate  of  5.94%.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  will  finance  $203.56  million \n(20.39%)  of  the  project  cost.  HPG  will  finance  $174.89 million  (17.52%)  of  the  project  cost. \nHPTD has provided a commitment letter to confirm (i) timely provision of adequate counterpart \nfunds, and (ii) provision of additional counterpart funding to cover any funding shortfalls that may \noccur during project implementation.

The  steering \ncommittee  will  provide  guidance  and  resolve  project  implementation  issues.  HPTD  will  be  the \nexecuting  agency,  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the  project.  It  has  established  a \nproject  management  office  (PMO),  which  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  construction  of \nproject roads (component A) and implementation of project components C and D. The PMO will \nbe  headed  by  a  project  manager,  who  will  oversee  day-to-day  implementation  including \ncoordinating activities to comply with safeguard requirements, supervising procurement of goods \nand  services,  monitoring  utilization  of  the  ADB  loan  and  government  funds,  preparing  and \nsubmitting reports to ADB and the government, and ensuring that the complaints received from \nlocal  residents  are  addressed  adequately.  The  expressway  and  class  I  roads  will  be  operated \nand managed by the Toll Roads Administration Bureau under HPTD, while the class II road will \nbe maintained by HPHB.  \n\n46.  Within  the  PMO,  Bei'an  county  transport  bureau  will  form  a  pilot  project  secretariat  for \nimplementation of the rural village bus services pilot project. The secretariat will be chaired by \nthe pilot project coordinator who will (i) provide the interface between the implementing agency \nand the pilot project, (ii) oversee day-to-day implementation, (iii) provide information to the PMO \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nfor decision making, (iv) supervise the activities of consultants to be engaged under the project, \nand (v) submit progress reports to the PMO.  \n\n47. \nHPHB  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  implementing  project  component  B.  It  has \nestablished  a  project  implementing  unit  to  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  activities  for \nimproving road maintenance. The organization chart for project implementation is in Appendix 9. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n48. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  from  March  2010  to  December  2014.  The  road \nconstruction is expected to take 3.5 years. Implementation of the road maintenance component \nwill  take  4\u00bd  years,  and  the  pilot  project  for  introducing  rural  village  bus  services  will  be \nimplemented over 3 years. Institutional and staff capacity building activities are expected to be \nimplemented during 2010\u20132014. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n49. \nADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The ADB loan will finance the 23 contract packages for project road \ncivil works, which will be procured through international competitive bidding. Prior review will be \napplied  for  these  contract  packages.  Other  civil  works  contract  packages,  bus  stations,  and \nmaintenance  works  will  be  financed  by  the  government  and  procured  using  government \nprocedure acceptable to ADB. A procurement plan is in Appendix 11. During project preparation, \nADB assessed HPTD\u2019s capacity to handle procurement and found it to be acceptable.    \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nfor  construction  supervision,  monitoring  of \n\n \n50. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  (i)  14  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  for \nconstruction supervision (8 person-months for a highway engineer, and 2 person-months each \nfor  a  bridge  engineer,  road  safety  expert,  and  pavement  engineer);  (ii)  8  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services  for  implementation  of  component  B  (2.5  person-months  for  a \nmaintenance contract specialist, 2 person-months each for a RAMS specialist and maintenance \nwork  specialist,  1  person-month  for  an  institutional  specialist,  and  0.5 person-months  for  a \nmaintenance financing specialist); and (iii) 15 person-months of national consulting services for \nimplementation of component C (8 person-months for a rural transport specialist and 4 person-\nmonths  for  a  bus  service  regulation  specialist,  and  3  person-months  for  a  passenger  survey \nspecialist).  The  government  will  finance  about  8,000  person-months  of  national  consulting \nresettlement,  and  monitoring  of \nservices \nenvironmental  and  socioeconomic \nimplementing \nfor \ncomponent B.   \n \nAll  ADB-financed  consulting  services  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \n51. \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  international  consultants  for \nconstruction  supervision  and  piloting  maintenance-by-contract  for  maintenance  works,  and \nnational consultants for piloting rural village bus services will be recruited through a firm using \nthe quality- and cost-based selection method based on simplified technical proposal, with quality \nand  cost  ratio  of  80:20  for  construction  supervision  and  90:10  for  implementing  the  two  pilot \nprojects. 10  For  introducing  the  RAMS,  an  individual  consultant  will  be  engaged  using  the \nindividual consultant selection method. All national consultants financed by the government will \nbe recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. The outline terms of \nreference for consulting services is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n                                                 \n10 The higher weighting reflects the need for specialized expertise to carry out the two pilot projects.  \n\nimpacts,  and  25 person-months \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n52. \nGiven  the  high  priority  accorded  to  the  project  by  the  government,  on  21  April  and \n25 September 2009 ADB approved advance contracting of civil works and consulting services. \nAdvance contracting covers the bidding, bid evaluation, short-listing, and request and evaluation \nof consultants' proposals. On 24 November 2009, ADB approved retroactive financing to finance \neligible expenditures for civil works and consulting services of up to $40 million incurred prior to \nloan  effectiveness  but  not  earlier  than  a  maximum  of  12  months  before  signing  of  the  loan \nagreement.  The  government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n53. \nwith  the  Government  of  the  PRC  and  HPTD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nproject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations,  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of HPTD, implementing agencies, and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project.  \n \n54. \nHPTD will ensure, during project implementation, that (i) officials from the Discipline and \nInspection  Bureau  monitor  bidding,  construction,  and  operations;  (ii)  a  two-contract  system  is \nadopted where the winner of a civil works contract will also sign an anticorruption contract with \nthe  employer;  and  (iii)  periodic  inspection  of  contractors  is  undertaken  to  ensure  that  funds \nwithdrawal  and  settlement  procedures  are  followed.  HPTD  will  initiate  liaison  with  the \nprosecutor\u2019s  office,  on  an  as-needed  basis,  to  discuss  any  warnings  about,  or  information  on, \nany corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n55. \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment and commitment procedures \nwill  be  used  for  large  works  contracts.  If  the  government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible \nexpenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  followed.  To  expedite  the  flow  of  funds \nHeilongjiang  Provincial  Finance  Bureau  will  establish  and manage  a  separate  imprest  account \nafter  loan  effectiveness,  at  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  imprest  account  shall  be  used \nexclusively to finance ADB's share of eligible expenditures for the loan. Disbursement from the \nimprest  account  will  be  supported  by  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related \ndocumentation.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  set  as  either  the  estimated \nexpenditures to be financed through the imprest account for the next 6 months, or 10% of the \nloan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  to \nreimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances provided into the imprest account for \nany individual payment not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nHPTD  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and  records  for  the  project  and  related  financial \n56. \nstatements. The project accounts and financial statement will be maintained in accordance with \nsound  accounting  principles  and  practices  as  prescribed  by  the  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC. \nHPTD will have such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by independent \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nexternal  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to \nADB, and in accordance with auditing standards that are acceptable to ADB. The audit of such \nfinancial  statements  will  include  (i)  an  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  accounting  and  internal \ncontrol systems with respect to project expenditures and other financial transactions, and (ii) an \nassessment of compliance with loan covenants that may be agreed under the project and ADB's \nrequirements on project management. HPTD will submit to ADB within 6 months of the end of \neach related fiscal year the project\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements, audited project \naccounts, audit reports, and management letters in English. A separate auditors opinion on the \nuse of the statement of expenditures procedure and the imprest account, if any, will be included \nas part of the auditor's report. \n \n57. \nTo  ensure  that  internal  controls  and  checks  on  the  project  construction  costs  and \noperations  are  effective,  HPTD  has  established  an  internal  audit  unit  to  carry  out  independent \nchecks  during  project  implementation.  The  internal  audit  unit  will  independently  test  financial \ntransactions of the PMO to ensure the safe custody of the project-financed assets and will report \ndirectly to HPTD and external auditors. HPTD will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting \nthe progress of project implementation to ADB by submitting quarterly progress reports to ADB \nas well as a project completion report within 3 months of the end of the project. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe project performance monitoring system was prepared including all the indicators that \n58. \nrelate to the project\u2019s impacts, outcomes, and outputs; and specifies the source and frequency \nfor  data  collection.  HPTD  agrees  with  the  monitoring  system;  and  will  establish  and  verify  the \nbaseline  values  at  project  inception  and  measure  the  indicators  and  report  the  key  findings  to \nADB  prior  to  midterm  review,  at  completion,  and  annually  for  3  years  after  completion.  The \nproject performance monitoring system is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n59. \nIn addition to regular annual reviews, ADB will carry out a detailed midterm review of the \nproject  in  the  third  year  of  project  implementation,  identify  major  problems,  and  agree  on  any \nchanges  needed  to  achieve  the  project  objectives.  The  review  will  cover  all  institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty  reduction, resettlement, \neconomic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of \nthe project and its viability. The review will examine compliance with covenants and assurances \nin the loan and project agreements.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nInstitutional Improvements \n\nA. \n \n60. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  public  sector  management  capacity  of  the  province  by \nstrengthening institutional and staff capacity in road maintenance management, public transport \nmanagement, and road safety management by (i) providing expertise, training, and equipment; \n(ii)  helping  to  introduce  and  institutionalize  an  improved  system  for  maintenance  planning  and \nbudgeting; (iii) developing regulatory documentation for bus services; and (iv) implementing the \npilot  activities.  It  will  create  an  enabling  environment  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in \nexecution of road maintenance and providing rural village bus services.  \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nTraffic Forecast \n\nB. \n \n61. \nDuring project preparation, traffic analysis and forecasts were reviewed and reestimated. \nComprehensive  origin\u2013destination  zones  were  used  to  carry  out  an  origin\u2013destination  survey. \nTraffic on the project roads is forecasted to be 3,927\u20139,517 passenger car units per day in 2014 \nand increase to 12,933\u201329,569 in 2033. Based on the capacity required to carry the expected \ntraffic, the road sections are designed in three different classifications (expressway, and class I \nand II).  \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n62. \nThe  project  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  by  comparing  the \nwithout-project  and  with-project  scenarios  for  four  road  sections:  Yichun\u2013Bei\u2019an,  Bei\u2019an\u2013\nWudalianchi,  Longzhen\u2013Nenjiang,  and  Nenjiang\u2013Inner  Mongolia  border  (Appendix  12).  The \neconomic costs include (i) the capital cost for construction including physical contingencies, and \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (ii) costs  for  environmental  management  and  monitoring, \ndetailed engineering design, and construction supervision; and (iii) annualized recurring costs for \nroad maintenance, environmental monitoring, and opportunity cost of land. The economic benefits \nare  (i)  savings  in  travel  time,  vehicle  operating  costs,  and  traffic  accidents  costs;  and \n(ii) generated traffic. The project is economically viable. The economic internal rate of return for \nthe whole project is 17.79%; the rates for the four road sections range from 14.04% to 19.36%. \nSensitivity tests confirm the robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Analysis and Projections \n\nThe  project's  financial  analysis  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for \n63. \nthe  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects11 (Appendix  13).  For  the  expressway  and \nclass I road, the projected financial statements indicate a cash-flow shortage in the first year of \noperation. HPTD confirmed that it will allocate required funds for operation and maintenance of \nthe  project  expressway  and  class  I  road  during  the  first  year  of  operation  to  balance  any \nshortage in the projected cash flow. The financial evaluation of the expressway was undertaken \nin  real  terms  using  constant  2009  prices.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  project \nexpressway,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  is  6.17%.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  real \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  of  3.56%.  The \nexpressway and class I road are therefore considered financially viable. Sensitivity tests indicate \nthat the project is financially viable in most circumstances except in the worst case scenario of \ntraffic  falling  20%  below  the  forecast  and  the  project  cost  increasing  by  20%.  Given  past \nexperience of projects in the sector, the likelihood of this combination of adverse circumstances \nis  considered  low.  HPTD  will  review  the  performance  of  the  expressway  regularly  and  monitor \nactual traffic volume and financial performance to prevent such occurrence.  \n \nTo maintain the constructed and upgraded sections of the project roads so that they do \n64. \nnot exceed an international roughness index of 3.5, annual maintenance will be required along \nwith  periodic  maintenance  every  9  years.  HPTD  will  provide  necessary  funds  for  the \nmaintenance of the project roads. Revenue-earning road sections generate adequate funds for \ntheir  maintenance  and  debt  repayment.  The  average  annual  cost  of  maintenance  of  the \nclass II road is anticipated to be only 0.8% of HPTD\u2019s total road maintenance budget. Financial \nmanagement assessment found that HPTD meets the financial management requirements and \ncan  provide  accurate  and  timely  information  in  the  reports  required  by  ADB.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nE. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Socioeconomic Impacts \n\n65. \nThe  project  will  benefit  about  1.7  million  people  in  the  five  counties  along  the  project \nroads.  The  project  impact  area  has  512,200  direct  beneficiaries  in  48  township  or  towns,  of \nwhom  49.2%  are  rural,  23.3%  are  state  farm  workers,  4.8%  are  state  forest  workers,  and \n22.7% are urban residents. The 9,090 ethnic minority people in the project impact area comprise \n1.7%  of  the  total  population,  and  include  Hui,  Korean,  and  Mongolian.  In  2008,  the  poverty \nincidence12 in the project impact area was 8.7% involving 44,500 people, with poverty conditions \nin the state forest farms averaging 12.8%. Among them, the rural poor account for about 30,000 \nwho  live  in  50  poverty  villages.  The  project  will  significantly  improve  rural  connectivity  and \nfacilitate the delivery of safe and comfortable road and road transport services to the public by \n(i) improving road safety by applying information communication technology for better regulation, \nmonitoring, response to the movement of people and goods on the project roads; (ii) improving \nroad maintenance; and (iii) introducing rural village bus services. \n\n66. \nThe  project  will  generate  social  and  economic  benefits  for  local  residents  and \ngovernments  including  (i)  transport  cost  and  time  savings;  (ii)  traffic  accident  cost  savings; \n(iii) improved  access  to  health  care  and  social  services;  (iv)  direct  job  opportunities  during \nconstruction  and  maintenance  works;  (v) new  economic  opportunities  for  local  forest  workers \nwho have lost their jobs due to the national policy on preserving forest resources; (vi) increased \ndemand locally for building materials, construction machinery, and transport during civil works; \n(vii)  increased  information  flow;  (viii) facilitation  of  tourism  development;  (ix)  reduced  vehicle \nemissions;  and  (ix) an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  participation.  The  project  will \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  promoting  ecotourism  in  Wudalianchi  Scenic  Area  and \nYichun  forestry  areas,  and  (ii)  facilitating  more  efficient  flow  of  agricultural  products  and \nnontimber  forest  products  to  market.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 14. \n \n67. \nThe project will not have major adverse social impacts except for land acquisition, which \nwill be mitigated by implementation of the resettlement plan. A social development action plan \n(SDAP)  was  prepared  to  increase  the  inclusiveness  of  project  benefits,  and  avoid  or  mitigate \nany adverse social impacts, particularly for women, ethnic minorities, and the poor. The project \nis  rated  category  B  for  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  so  specific  actions  are \nincluded  in  the  SDAP.  Key  features  of  the  SDAP  include  (i)  road  safety  awareness  for  rural \ncommunities;  (ii) income  and \nfor  people  affected  by  resettlement; \n(iii) transmissible  disease  prevention;  (iv)  avoidance  of  community  disturbance  during \nconstruction;  (v)  priority  hiring  of  local  residents  for  construction;  (vi) complementary  poverty \nreduction programs; (vii) enhancement of project benefits for women, including through women's \nemployment, livelihood training, and microcredit, and promoting women's participation in project \nimprovements.  HPTD  will  closely  monitor \nimplementation;  and \nimplementation  of  the  SDAP;  ADB  will  review  implementation.  The  SDAP  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix G.   \n  \nthroughout  project \n68. \npreparation,  including  16  focus  group  discussions  to  gather  opinions  on  road  alignment, \nenvironment,  and  resettlement  measures.  Public  awareness  of  the  project  is  high  and  the \nresidents  and  local  governments  view  the  construction  of  the  project  road  positively.  HPTD \ncarried out consultation meetings with (i) the people affected by the revision of the road alignments \nand the respective local governments were informed about the alignments, and (ii) the people who \n\nExtensive  public  consultations  were  held  with  1,600  people \n\n(viii) transport  service \n\nlivelihood  recovery \n\n                                                 \n12  Heilongjiang  adopts  CNY1,300  per  person  per  year  as  the  rural  poverty  line.  The  urban  poverty  threshold  is \nCNY176 per person per month. ADB's new poverty standard is $1.25 per day (equivalent to CNY1,500 per year). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\nwould  have  been  affected  by  the  original  alignments  and  respective  local  governments  were \ninformed about the change in the alignment to avoid any possible misunderstanding or incorrect \nexpectation  about  the  alignment  of  the  project  road.  Consultations  will  be  ongoing  to  increase \nunderstanding  and  meet  the  evolving  needs  and  expectations  of  the  stakeholders,  and \nencourage  active  involvement  of  local  communities.  The  consultation  and  participation  plan  to \nbe implemented during project implementation is in Supplementary Appendix H.   \n \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n2. \n \nThe project is classified as category A for involuntary resettlement. HPTD has prepared \n69. \na full resettlement plan for the project roads and a short resettlement plan for the bus stations. \nResettlement  information  booklets  were  distributed  to  affected  villages.  The  project  will \npermanently acquire 1,365 hectares 13 of land, which will partially affect about 3,500 households \nwith  14,000  people,  and  require  134.6  hectares  for  temporary  use.  Ten  households  and  one \nenterprise  need  to  be  relocated.  Of  the  total  affected  population,  2,000  households  with \n8,000 people  are  rural  residents,  and  1,500 households  with  6,000  persons  are  state  farm \nworkers  or  state  forest  farm  workers.  On  average,  only  7.5%  of  each  affected  household\u2019s \nfarmland will be acquired; abundant farmland is available, especially on state farms. No ethnic \nminorities are affected by land acquisition and resettlement. The summary resettlement plan is \nincluded in Appendix 15 and full resettlement plans are in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \nF. \n \n70. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  A.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) for the project roads and bus stations was prepared by HPTD and approved \nby Heilongjiang Environmental Protection Bureau in May 2009. A summary EIA (SEIA) including \nan  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  environmental  framework  for  maintenance \nworks  was  circulated  to  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  and  made  publicly  available  through  the \nADB  website  on  14  October  2009. The  EIA  and  SEIA  assess  the environmental  impact  of  the \nselected  road  alignments  of  the  project  roads  and  bus  stations,  and  prescribe  environmental \nprotection  and  mitigation  measures.  HPTD  will  implement  the  EMP  to  ensure  that  all  potential \nadverse environmental impacts of the project are mitigated. \n \nG. \n \n71. \nOverall,  the  project  risk  is  considered  low.  In  preparing  the  project,  the  financial, \nenvironmental, and social risks were assessed and the mitigation measures were incorporated. \nTo  mitigate  financial  risks  associated  with  construction  and  initial  operation  of  the  expressway \nand class I road, HPTD has agreed to provide sufficient funding to balance any shortfall in cash \nflow in the first year of operation. The class II road will be toll free. Adequate maintenance and \nfunding of road maintenance of the road without tolls will be ensured through the improved road \nmaintenance planning and budgeting process to be introduced under the project. These actions \nwill  help  in  ensuring  that  financial  risks  of  the  project  are  low.  The  project  is  expected  to  have \nadverse  environmental  impacts  during  construction;  however,  after  implementation  of  the \nmitigation  measures  reflected  in  the  environmental  management  plan,  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  due  to  construction  will  be  minor.  Social  issues  include  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  and  transmissible  diseases.  However,  after  implementation  of  the  mitigation \nmeasures,  the  residual  effect  will  be  minor.  Implementation  of  these  measures  will  be  closely \nmonitored by the government and reviewed by ADB. \n \n\nRisks \n\n                                                 \n13  This includes 3.1 ha of land required for the 16 new bus stations. \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  and  HPG  have  given  the \n\n72. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the loan and project agreements.  \n\nRoad  maintenance.

The overall layout of the province\u2019s transport \nnetwork is centered around Harbin, connecting to regional central cities as nodes, and radiating \nto  border  areas.  This  transport  network  also  connects  to  Jilin  province  in  the  south  and  Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region in the west. \n \n2. \nBy  the  end  of  2007,  the  province\u2019s  railway  lines  reached  7,250  kilometers  (km), \nconnecting 62.8% of the cities in Heilongjiang. Railways play an important role in the province\u2019s \neconomic  development,  especially  for  the  transportation  of  energy,  minerals,  materials,  and \nother bulk cargo.  \n \nBy  the  end  of  2007,  Heilongjiang  had  a  road  network  of  140,909  km, with  a  density  of \n3. \n31 km  per  hundred  square  km,  lower  than  the  country\u2019s  average  density.  By  technical \nclassification,  the  road  network  comprises  1,044  km  of  expressways,  1,435  km  of  class  I \nhighways, 7,443 km of class II highways, 33,207 km of class III roads, and 50,883 km of class \nIV roads. \n \n4. \nInland  waterway  transport  in  Heilongjiang  province  is  mainly  along  the  Heilongjiang \nRiver,  Wusuli  River,  Songhua  River  and  Nen  River;  comprising  5,528  km  of  navigable \nwaterways.  Water  ports  are  mainly  located  along  Songhua  River  and  Heilongjiang  River, \nincluding  the  main  ports  of  Fuyuan,  Harbin,  Heihe,  Jiamusi,  and  Tongjiang.  The  system  has \n172 passenger and freight berths, with annual freight capacity of 15 million tons, and capacity \nfor 1.8 million passengers. \n \n5. \nCurrently, Heilongjiang province has five civil airports, located at Harbin, Heihe, Jiamusi, \nMudanjiang,  and  Qiqihar.  Harbin  Taiping  Airport  is  an  international  airport  and  the  second \nlargest airport in the northeast of the PRC. More than 60 air routes form an aviation network to \nall provinces of the country, and Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation. \n \n6. \nAlongside robust socioeconomic development and transport infrastructure improvement, \npassenger  and  freight  traffic  in  Heilongjiang  province  have  grown  rapidly.  During  2000\u20132007, \ntotal  passenger  traffic  increased  by  30%;  and  total  freight  traffic  increased  by  28%.  Despite \ncompetition  among  transport  modes  in  recent  years,  railway  transportation  is  still  dominant  in \nfreight  transportation  due  to  its  low  price  and  high  reliability.  However,  a  significant  amount  of \nmedium  and  short-distance  passenger  traffic  has  diverted  from  railway  to  road.  During  2000\u2013\n2007,  passenger  road  traffic  increased  by  an  annual  average  of  4.72%  and  freight  traffic  by \n4.03% per annum. \n \nB. \n\nHeilongjiang Road Subsector \n\n7. \nThe  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Transportation  Department  (HPTD)  is  responsible  for  the \nplanning, development, maintenance, and administration of the road and waterway subsectors \non behalf of the provincial government. HPTD is mainly responsible for national and provincial \nhighways,  including  planning,  financing,  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance.  Prefecture \nand county communications bureaus are responsible for construction and maintenance of local \nroads.  HPTD  also  regulates  the  road  transport  industry  by  licensing  drivers,  vehicles,  and \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nintercity bus services. Freight transport is essentially deregulated, but interprovincial bus routes \nstill  require  approval  from  the  Ministry  of  Transport.  Private  operations  have  increased, \nimproving transport efficiency and quality, and increasing competition. Road transport tariffs are \nallowed  to  vary  within  a  range  of  plus  or  minus  20%  of  advisory  tariffs  set  by  the  local \ngovernment.  \n \n8. \nSubstantial  funds  have  been  used  for  rural  road  development.  However,  road \nmaintenance funding appears to be inadequate. In recent years, the funds for road development \nwere sourced mainly from domestic banks, local governments, and Ministry of Transport grants. \nHigh class roads (above class I) are expected to cover their operation and maintenance costs \nand  debt  service  charges  from  their  toll  revenues.  Reliance  on  domestic  debt  has  been \nincreasing,  used  to  finance  both  expressways  and  other  road  projects  and  repaid  from  toll \nrevenues. Starting on 1 January 2009, the central government issued and implemented a new \npolicy to abolish the collection of road maintenance fees and five other types of transportation \nfees, and to start collection of fuel tax. \n \nC. \n\nHeilongjiang Road Sector Development Plan \n\n9. \nTo  stimulate  and  maintain  high  socioeconomic  development,  in  June  2008  the \nHeilongjiang  government  approved  a  3-year  plan  for  speeding  up  road  development.  It  will \nenhance  efforts  and  investment  for  road  development  during  2008\u20132011,  and  invest \nCNY90 billion  to  develop  2,207  km  of  expressways,  731 km  of  class  I  highways,  3,252  km  of \nclass II highways, and 60,799 km of rural roads.  \n \nD. \n\nRoad Issues \n\n10. \nTransport connectivity. Heilongjiang is the sixth largest province in the PRC with large \nforest  cover  area  and  agricultural  farmlands.  Historically  timber  production,  agriculture,  and \nheavy  industry  are  the  three  major  outputs,  and  the  railroad  has  been  one  of  the  major \ntransportation  modes.  As  for  road  transportation,  despite  the  large  amount  of  investment  in \nrecent years, including investments from ADB, development of the road network is still lagging \nother parts of the PRC, especially in the coastal and more populated areas. Currently, the road \nnetwork is mainly concentrated around Harbin and the construction and upgrading of roads in \nthe far north, east, and west along the provincial border is still in the planning stage. Transport \ncost is high and poor access to the vast rural and remote area is one of the main constraints for \nrural poverty reduction. \n \n11. \nRoad  maintenance.  HPTD  implements  maintenance  works  using  its  own  staff  of \napproximately  29,158,  of  which  18,831  are  categorized  as  maintenance  workers.  They  are \nresponsible  for  approximately  13,165  km  of  national  and  provincial  roads.  This  amounts  to \napproximately  2.8  persons/km,  which  is  much  higher  than  in  developed  countries  (in  Australia \nthe ratio is 0.3 and in British Columbia, Canada it is 0.02). Heilongjiang province makes limited \nuse  of  the  private  sector  for  contracted  maintenance.  The  approach  to  planning  road \nmaintenance works and allocation of funds for road maintenance in the province is not yet well \ndeveloped. \n \n12. \nfatalities  and \n4,905 injuries.  The  direct  property  loss  was  CNY20.1  million.  In  2007,  the  number  of  fatalities \nper 10,000 vehicles was 6.34; the national average was 5.1. The province experiences a long \nwinter  with  snow  coverage  for  about  120  days.  About  40%  of  total  accidents  are  due  to  the \npresence  of  ice  and  snow  on  roads  because  of  inadequate  snow  clearance.  Due  to  poor \n\ntraffic  accidents  resulted \n\nIn  2008,  road \n\nRoad  safety. \n\nin  1,703 \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nknowledge  of  traffic  regulations  and  use  of  unsafe  vehicles,  the  rural  elderly,  women,  and \nchildren  often  become  victims  of  road  traffic  accidents.  Other  factors  contributing  to  road \naccidents are inadequate road design, improper traffic safety devices, and lack of enforcement. \nMany law-enforcement groups are not well educated about road safety and do not adopt best \npractices, methods, approaches, and systems. Timely and effective emergency rescue and first \naid mechanisms are also lacking.  \n \n13. \nPublic  transport  services.  In  addition  to  the  construction  and  upgrading  of  road \ninfrastructure,  the  improvement  of  transport  services,  both  for  passengers  and  goods,  is  an \nimportant  part  of  improving  transport  in  rural  areas.  Currently,  bus  service  is  still  one  of  the \nmajor  means  of  transport  in  rural  areas.  Services  are  mainly  provided  by  private  transport \ncompanies and are subject to market forces. In some cases, villages with fewer passengers do \nnot  have  any  bus  services.  In  addition  to  market  forces,  appropriate  government  policies  are \nneeded  to  regulate  rural  bus  services  and  to  provide  incentives  for  bus  companies  to  provide \nservices for both populated and less populated villages. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION \n\n \n1. \nIn  the  road  subsector,  the  World  Bank  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national and local road networks. The \nWorld Bank has provided loans of about $9.4 billion to finance road investments and the Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (provided  by  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation)  has \nprovided  about  \u00a5195.0  billion.  The  European  Investment  Bank  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement provided \u20ac85 million cofinancing for road projects in the southwestern region of \nthe  People's  Republic  of  China.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  coordinates  with  these \ndevelopment  partners  to  discuss  progress  and  issues  in  the  sector.  ADB  meets  regularly  with \nthe  World  Bank  for  coordination  and  information  sharing.  The  government  coordinates  the \nactivities  of  different  development  partners  and  has  utilized  ADB  technical  assistance  support \nfor researching and influencing a number of policy interventions. ADB has coordinated closely \nwith  other  development  partners  on  policy  dialogue  and  shared  its  development  experiences \nwith them. \n\nTable A3: Major Development Partners: Key Activities \nDate Approved \n\nTotal \n\nProject Name \nA.

The RAMS has \nfunctions to meet highway performance assessment standards requirements, including highway \ncondition  information  management,  highway  performance  assessment,  maintenance  decision-\nmaking analysis, annual road maintenance planning, and medium- and long-term maintenance \nplanning. To facilitate easy and reliable data collection for the RAMS, the Ministry of Transport \nhas developed a special road condition data collection vehicle. It has asked the provinces to use \nthe RAMS for planning and budgeting of road maintenance works in their jurisdiction including \nHeilongjiang. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nIntroduction  of  the  RAMS  in  Heilongjiang  requires  support  for  development  of  skills  in \nrunning the RAMS; field data collection using the special vehicle; data processing and upgrading \nthe road database; preparing annual road maintenance plans based on road conditions, traffic, \nand  expected  economic  returns;  and  maintaining  the  improved  database  and  software  and \nequipment. HPTD has also recognized that the long-term sustainability of the RAMS will require \nan  efficient  organization  structure  to  facilitate  proactive  road  asset  management;  this  would \nrequire  a  realignment  of  relevant  parts  of  HPHB  to  meet  the  new  functions  and  processes. \nDuring project preparation, HPTD asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help introduce \nthe RAMS in the province and build required capacity in road maintenance by including a project \ncomponent for improving road maintenance. This component aims to enhance HPHB's capacity \nin prioritizing and budgeting maintenance works. It will also assist HPHB to introduce the use of \nperformance-based  maintenance  contract  to  improve  the  quality  of  works  and  develop  private \nsector capacity for bidding and execution of maintenance works.  \n\nObjective and Scope of Asian Development Bank Assistance \n\nThis  project  component  consists  of  introducing  and  institutionalizing  the  RAMS,  and \n\n4. \nintroducing a performance-based maintenance contract on a pilot basis. \n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nHPHB will be the implementing agency with overall responsibility for this component. It \n5. \nhas established a project implementing unit (PIU). The director of the HPTD Planning Division \nwill  chair  the  PIU.

The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  technical  assistance  for  Sustainable  Rural  Transport \nServices1  indicates  that  improvement  in  rural  transport  services  is  needed  as  part  of  the \ngovernment  policy  to  reduce  rural  poverty.  To  support  this, the  project  includes component  C: \nimproving  rural  village  bus  services.  This  project  component  will  provide  new  bus  services  in \nthree  administrative  villages  in  Bei'an  county  by  implementing  a  pilot  project.  It  will  also \nconstruct  and  rehabilitate  20 bus  stations  in  the  project  impact  area  including  four  new  bus \nstations  in  Bei'an.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  will  finance  the  civil  works  for  these  bus  stations \n($880,000). \n\nPilot Project \n\nA. \n \n2. \nOverview.  Bei'an  county  comprises  62  administrative  villages\u201420  do  not  have  formal \nbus services. Small companies or individuals provide the rural bus service. Lack of competition, \noverpricing,  and  overloading  often  occur.  The  use  of  old  vehicles  without  proper  maintenance \nand  agriculture  tractors,  tri-motor-cycles,  and  trucks  is  common,  and  sometimes  results  in \naccidents. In the event of an accident, due to lack of enforcement of insurance regulation, the \nbus service providers and victims are not properly compensated.  \n \n3. \nObjective.  The  pilot  project  aims  to  (i)  protect  the  public  interest  by  introducing  village \nbus  route  licensing  reform,  keeping  fares  reasonable,  and  ensuring  vehicles  are  in  good \ncondition; (ii) improve conditions for bus service providers to operate profitably; and (iii) improve \nthe efficiency of local transport bureaus in monitoring demand for bus services and responding \nto  increased  demand  for  bus  services  providers  and  bus  operators.  One  township  and  three \nadministrative villages will be selected to pilot bus route licensing reform based on the results of \nfield  investigations  to  be  undertaken  under  the  project.  The  following  recommendations  given \nunder ADB technical assistance will be applied for the pilot project: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nencourage the development of local bus operators that would have the exclusive \nright  to  provide  a  coordinated  network  of  bus  services  to  surrounding  villages; \nand  \namend  the  licensing  regulations2  applicable  to  bus  services  between  townships \nand  villages  and  between  villages  to  permit  greater  flexibility  in  the  use  of  bus \nroute, fares charged, and types of vehicle used.  \n\n \nImplementation  arrangements.

The main products \n1.  \nof  the  combustion  process  are  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  and  water,  but  inefficiencies  and  high \ntemperatures \nin  engine  operation  also  produce  other  byproducts  such  as \nhydrocarbons,  oxides  of  nitrogen  (NOx),  carbon  monoxide,  particulate  matter,  and  their \nchemical  compounds.  The  emission  of  pollutants  has  global,  regional,  social,  environmental, \nand  economic  impacts.  Excessive  greenhouse  gas  emissions  increase  global  warming  and \ncause climate change, NOx plays a major role in the formation of acid rain in the atmosphere, \nand  particulate  matter  damages  human  health.  Vehicle  emissions  have  a  direct  and  adverse \nimpact on health and the environment. Reducing vehicle emissions to improve air quality is an \nimportant issue that should be addressed in transport projects. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  main  vehicle  pollutants  are  CO2,  carbon  monoxide,  hydrocarbons,  NOx,  and \nparticulate  matter.  In  general,  vehicle  emissions  from  individual  vehicles  depend  on  various \nfactors,  including  vehicle  maintenance,  driving  behavior,  and  road  and  traffic  conditions.  The \nreduction  of  emission  pollutants  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  case  with  and  without  the \nproject. Without the project, the traffic will continue to use the existing road, which will be more \ncongested,  engines  will  consume  more  fuel  and  produce  more  pollutants  as  a  result  of  slow-\nmoving  traffic,  inefficient  stop-and-go  travel,  and  longer  engine  running  times.  With  the  project, \nthe  traffic  will  benefit  from  shorter  distance,  optimal  alignment,  better  road  condition,  and  less \ncongestion, which will make travel more smooth. Vehicles will operate efficiently without stop-\nand-go,  which  will  result  in  lower  fuel  consumption  and  less  emission  of  pollutants.  Smooth \ntraffic flow will raise fuel efficiency on the project roads and reduce emissions. \n \n3. \nThe project will increase the efficiency of energy use, which will reduce vehicle emission \nper  unit  of  transport.  The  estimation  of  vehicle  emissions  is  based  on  the  relationship  of  fuel \nconsumption,  emission  of  pollutants,  and  vehicle  average  speed.  The  average  fuel  saving  is \nestimated  at  about  260,365  tons  oil  equivalent  per  year  and  CO2  reduction  is  about \n282,500 tons per year. \n \n4. \nThe Heilongjiang provincial government is committed to  adhere to the national vehicle \nemission control strategies and plans, which include (i) enforcing stricter standards by July 2010 \n(GB18352-3-2005  and  GB17691-2005  that  are  equivalent  to  step  IV  of  European  Emission \nStandards); \nincluding \n(a) establishing  annual  emission  checks  and  random  roadside  testing,  (b)  requiring  emission \ncontrol  devices  to  be  repaired,  updated,  and  installed  if  the  vehicle  can't  meet  the  standard, \n(c) developing a quality audit system to guarantee the quality of testing and prevent fraud and \ncorruption,  (d)  upgrading  vehicle  testing  facilities,  and  (e)  promoting  awareness  regarding \nvehicle emission and fuel consumption; (iii) encouraging use of clean fuel; (iv) forcing retirement \nof vehicles based on their age and failure to pass the emission inspection test three consecutive \ntimes;  and  (v) encouraging  retirement  of  old  vehicles  through  subsidy.1  Table  A7  provides  an \nintegrated plan developed to help agencies reduce vehicle emissions in Heilongjiang. \n \n\ninspection  and  maintenance  programs \n\n(ii)  enforcing  vehicle \n\n                                                 \n1  A subsidy of CNY6,000 was introduced on 1 September 2009.

The traffic analysis and forecast uses 2008 as the \nbase year. The project is expected to commence in early 2010 and be completed in late 2013; \nwith  the  project  road  opening  to  the  public  in  2014.  The  future  key  years  for  analysis  include \n2014, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, and 2033. \n \n2. \nTraffic  forecast.  Table  A12.1  shows  the  aggregated  traffic  forecast  for  each  section  of \nthe  project  roads  in  future  key  years.  The  traffic  forecast  result  shows  that  future  traffic  on  the \nproject roads will be on the growth curves. During 2014\u20132020, annual traffic increase rates will be \nfor  Bei\u2019an\u2013Wudalianchi \nabout  9.9% \n(expressway),  9.1%  for  Longzhen\u2013Nenjiang  (class  II  highway),  and  11.3%  for  Nenjiang  to  the \nprovincial border with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (class I road). After 2020, annual \nincrease rates of the four sections will slow down as traffic will have matured.  \n \n3. \nExcept  for  some  localized  gravel  roads  used  by  the  timber  industry  transporting  timber \nproducts,  no  direct  road  connection  is  available  between  Yichun  and  Wudalianchi.  After  the \ncompletion of the project road sections, the traffic between these cities will benefit from a direct \nhigh-quality  road  link,  shortening  the  distance  by  400 km  and  reducing  time  by  6 hours.  Local \nresidents will also have much better access to the project roads. Diverted and generated traffic \nwill therefore be high on the project road sections, taking into account traffic that previously used \nindirect routes or was suppressed due to time, cost, and access concerns. \n\nthe  Yichun\u2013Bei\u2019an  section  (expressway),  7.4% \n\nfor \n\nTable A12.1: Full Traffic Forecast Result by Sections \n(PCU-AADT) \n\nSection \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2020 \n\n2025 \n\n2030 \n\n2033 \n\nAverage \n\nYichun\u2013Bei'an \n\nBei'an\u2013\nWudalianchi \n\nLongzhen\u2013\nNenjiang \n\nPCU \n\nPCU \n\nPCU \n\nAnnual increase \n\nAnnual increase \n\n8,132 \n\n9,603 \n\n14,364 \n\n20,045 \n\n25,676 \n\n29,569 \n\nAnnual increase \n\n9.9% \n\n6.9% \n\n5.1% \n\n4.8% \n\n7.0% \n\n9,517 \n\n10,665 \n\n14,619 \n\n19,322 \n\n24,225 \n\n27,645 \n\n3,927 \n\n6,631 \n\n9,200 \n\n11,410 \n\n12,933 \n\n7.4% \n\n4,523 \n\n9.1% \n\n5.7% \n\n4.6% \n\n4.5% \n\n5.8% \n\n6.8% \n\n4.4% \n\n4.3% \n\n6.5% \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\nPCU \n\n4,317 \n\n5,105 \n\n8,226 \n\n11,965 \n\n16,722 \n\n20,073 \n\n8.4% \n\n6.3% \n\n6.9% \n\n7.8% \n\n11.3% \n\nNenjiang\u2013Inner \nMongolia Border  Annual increase \n\u2026 = not available, AADT = average annual daily traffic, PCU = passenger car unit. \nNote: Periods of annual increase rate are 2014\u20132020, 2020\u20132025, 2025\u20132030, and 2030\u20132033. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4. \nMethodology  and  alternatives.  The  economic  assessment  conducted  for  the  project \nfollows  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.1  The  evaluation  period  is  from \nbeginning 2010 to 2033 with the period from 2010 to late-2013 representing the implementation \nperiod  and  the  20-year  period  from  mid-2014  to  2033  representing  the  operation  period  for  the \nproject  road.  Project  road  construction  is  to  commence  in  late  2009.  For  all  quantifiable  project \ncosts  and  benefits,  the  unit  of  account  used  is  the  domestic  price  expressed  in  the  national \ncurrency  for  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (yuan).  Four  alternatives  were  considered  for  the \nproject.

The  prices  are  expressed  in \n5. \nyuan,  employing  the  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.01  for \nforeign exchange effects. A shadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages paid \nto unskilled labor, but not on the wages paid to skilled labor, because no skilled worker surplus \nexists.  A  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.67  was  used  to  convert  the  financial  wage  rate  to  an \neconomic  opportunity  cost  of  labor.  The  economic  costs  include  (i)  the  capital  cost,  including \nphysical  contingencies,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  costs; \nand  (ii)  the  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  roads,  including  the  costs  of  replacing \ndepreciated  equipment.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  are  based  on  their \nopportunity  costs  calculated  by  the  National  Development  Reform  Commission's  methodology \nand parameters, which is the agricultural output forgone and the relocation of displaced activities.  \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nC. \n \n6. \nVehicle  operating  cost  savings.  Vehicle  operating  cost  savings  are  the  differences \nbetween  with-  and  without-project  cases.  The  PPK  model2  was  utilized  to  estimate  vehicle \noperating costs in both cases. Data for the PPK model were collected from pertinent sources in \nthe province. In this respect, the following data were acquired: prices of vehicles, tires, fuel and \nlubricants; maintenance labor cost, crew wages, and annual overhead cost; annual interest rate; \nand  time  value  of  passengers  and  freight.  For  each  vehicle  type,  the  model  assumes  specific \nparameter  values  describing  the  vehicle\u2019s  configuration,  engineering  characteristics,  operation, \nand cost. For estimation of the vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings, the international roughness \nindex is assumed to be 6 using without-project conditions and 2 using with-project conditions. \n \nTime  savings  benefits.  Using  the  vehicle  operating  speeds  of  the  traffic  assignment \n7. \nmodel, the total passenger-hours and freight ton-hours are estimated for with- and without-project \nassumptions.  In  estimating  the  time  value  for  passengers,  the  following  parameters  are  used: \n(i) the  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  of  CNY21,727  in  2008,  (ii)  total  working  hours  for \npassengers is 2,000,3 and (iii) hourly rates of CNY10.86. \n \n8. \nGenerated  traffic  benefits.  The  new  roads  will  generate  new  traffic.  The  benefits  of \ngenerated traffic are estimated on the basis of cost savings to generated traffic. The generated \ntraffic benefits are valued at 50% of the VOC savings used for normal and diverted traffic.  \n \n9. \nAccident savings. Road traffic accidents resulted in costs of CNY150, 000 for fatalities, \nCNY 100,000 for injuries, and CNY30,000 for property damage. In 2008, the total number of road \naccidents  in  Heilongjiang  Province  was  4,538  with  1,703  fatalities  and  4,905  injuries,  this \nrepresents a decrease from 2007 of 32.57% for total number of accidents, 10.65% for fatalities, \nand  34.36%  for  injuries  from  2007.  Property  damages  were  estimated  at  CNY20.06  million,  a \ndecrease  of  23.4%.  In  estimating  benefits  to  accident  reduction,  cost  per  km  was  estimated  at \nCNY0.04187  per  vehicle-km.  In  the  case  of  normal  and  generated  traffic,  5%  of  the  estimated \naccident  cost  was  attributed,  which  was  then  multiplied  by  the  annual  average  daily  traffic  and \nroad length to estimate the total accident benefits. In the case of diverted traffic, the full accident \ncost  per  vehicle-km  was  considered  and  then multiplied  by  the  annual  average  daily  traffic  and \nreduced road length.  \n                                                 \n2  World  Bank.  1996.

At  a  12%  rate  of \ndiscount,  the  net  present  value  calculated  for  each  section  ranges  from  CNY87  million  to \nCNY3.75  billion.  The  consolidated  net  present  value  for  the  four  sections  amounts  to \nCNY3.8 billion.  The  project  as  a  whole  generates  an  EIRR  of  17.79%  (Table  A12.3).

The revenue component \nconsists of two expressway sections and a class I road section. The nonrevenue component is a \nclass II road section.  \n\nA.  \n\nRevenue-Earning Expressway Component of the Project \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Projections \n\n2. \nAfter construction, expressways and the class I road will be operated  and managed by \nthe Toll Roads Administration Bureau. Toll rates will be set 6 months before the opening of these \nroad  sections  to  the  public  by  considering  cost  recovery  and  affordability.  In  the  province,  one \nexpressway subsidizes another, resulting in different expressways having different toll rates. The \nexisting average tolls are used to assess the financial viability of the expressways (Table A13.1). \n\nTable A13.1: Base Year Tolls in 2009 Prices \n\nVehicle Class \nCars and trucks by weight (ton) \n\n1 \n<2 \n\n2 \n2\u20135 \n\n3 \n5\u201310 \n\nNumber of bus seats \nToll rates expressway (CNY per vehicle-km) \nToll rates class I (CNY per vehicle-km) \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Heilongjiang Provincial Transportation Department. \n\n<7 \n0.45 \n0.30 \n\n8\u201319 \n0.65 \n0.40 \n\n20\u201339 \n0.85 \n0.50 \n\n4 \n10\u201315 and 20 \nfoot-container \n>40 \n1.00 \n0.60 \n\n5 \n>15 and 40 \nfoot-container \n \n1.20 \n0.80 \n\n3. \nPeriodic maintenance will be required every 9 years. Depreciation is calculated using a \nstraight  line  method  with  an  average  life  of  40  years.  Corporate  income  tax  at  25%  is  paid  on \nincome after deducting business taxes, depreciation and interest charges, operating expenses, \nand any prior year losses carried forward. \n\n4. \nThe  project  will  be  funded  38%  by  equity  (17.5%  by  the  Heilongjiang  provincial \ngovernment  and  the  rest  by  the  central  government)  and  62%  by  long-term  loans  from \nAgricultural Bank of China and ADB. ADB's financing for the expressways and class I road part \nof  the  overall  project  is  $157.53  million.  It  will  have  a  25-year  term  including  a  5-year  grace \nperiod,  and  a  US dollar  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loan  with  a  0.15% \ncommitment fee. The projected financial statements (Table A13.2) indicate that forecast revenue \nunder the base assumptions is sufficient to cover annual recurrent costs, depreciation, and debt \nrepayments on ADB and domestic bank loans; and generate reasonable profits. \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n5. \nThe major assumptions used to calculate a financial internal rate of return include (i) all \ncalculations  are  based  on  2009  prices,  covering  2010\u20132033;  (ii)  capital  costs  include  all \nincremental capital expenditures related to construction and equipment for the revenue-earning \nroads,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  (iii)  operating  costs \ninclude  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  roads,  but  exclude \ndepreciation and debt payments; and (iv) a residual value equal to the net book value of capital \ninvestment. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\nThe estimated real weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after-tax, in real terms, was \n6. \ncalculated  using  estimated  capital  mix  and  cost  of  funds.  Costs  considered  include  (i)  the \napplicable 5-year LIBOR fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.2% is used for \nADB debt, (ii) the present interest rate of 5.94% per annum is used for the domestic bank loans, \nand (iii) the opportunity cost of equity capital is assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is adjusted \nto reflect the impact of income tax of 25%. The nominal cost is converted to real cost by applying \ndomestic  long-term  inflation  rates  for  local  currency  and  international  inflation  rates  for  foreign \nexchange denominated debt. \n\n7. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  project,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is \n6.17% (Table A13.3), which compares favorably with the WACC, computed at an after-tax basis \nat  3.56%.  The  project  is  considered  both  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  tests \nindicate  that  the  project's  viability  will  fall  below  the  WACC  in  the  worst  case  scenario  where \ntraffic will fall below 20% of the forecast and the project cost will increase above 20%. However, \nsuch an event is unlikely to occur. The sensitivity of the project's financial indicators to cost and \nrevenue variations is shown in Table A13.4. \n\n3. \n\nSummary Financial Results of the Revenue-Earning Road Sections \n\n8. \nWith  average  toll  rates,  the  expressway  section  is  financially  viable  in  the  long  run. \nHowever, average toll rates are not sufficient to generate adequate cash flows in the first year of \noperations and the debt service coverage ratio does not reach the ADB norm of 1.2 until 2017. \nThis short-term cash flow shortage will be financed by the Heilongjiang Provincial Transportation \nDepartment (HPTD) during the early years.  \n\nFinancial Analysis Nonrevenue-Earning Components of the Project \n\nB. \n \n9. \nClass II road sections will not earn revenue, only the two expressway sections and class \nI  road  section  are  expected  to  earn  revenue.  Other  project  components  are  (i)  road \nmaintenance, (ii) rural bus service, and (iii) institutional capacity building. ADB funds will be used \nfor these nonrevenue-earning components, including construction and/or rehabilitation of the bus \nstations.  Financial  evaluation  of  the  nonrevenue-earning  components  focuses  on  fiscal  impact \non the operating entity. \n\n10. \nThe financial data confirm the availability of sufficient counterpart funds and the capacity \nof  HPTD  to  finance  both  investment  in  the  project  and  future  maintenance  and  operating \nexpenses of the project roads. As the class II road will not be tolled, funds for road maintenance \nwill be provided by the fuel tax proceeds.  \n\n11. \nThe total capital required for the class II road represents only 1.5% of past annual HPTD \nrevenues.  Similarly,  operation  and  maintenance,  including  periodic  maintenance  of  the  class  II \nroad  will  represent  0.8%  of  HPTD\u2019s  historic  costs  for  these  items.  Full  debt  payments  on  the \nclass  II  road,  when  they  become  due  in  2014  will  be  0.77%  of  HPTD's  total  debt  payments  in \n2011.  \n\nThese low financial ratios indicate that the project presents a very modest financial risk \n12.  \nwith respect to (i) the availability of resources to cover the project cost, (ii) the maintenance and \noperating  needs,  (iii)  the  loan

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  PRC  has  made  good  progress  in  poverty  reduction  over  the  last  25  years,  but  it  is  still  facing  a  big  challenge  in \naddressing poverty. Poor accessibility or isolation can inhibit economic and social development. The road subsector is \none  of  the  most  important  areas  for  poverty  reduction.  Roads  provide  (i)  improved  access  for  the  poor  to  external \nmarkets, employment opportunities, and social services; (ii) lower transport costs of agricultural inputs and produce; and \n(iii)  improved  interaction  with  other  regions,  thus  providing  opportunities  to  develop  and  exploit  comparative  and \ncompetitive advantages. Increased economic activities and urbanization of the project area can lead to increasing local \nemployment opportunities (e.g., commercial agriculture, eco-forestry, and other tourism).  \n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  strategy  and  program,a  especially  pillar  I  of  Inclusive  Growth  and \nBalanced  Development.  Under  this  pillar  I,  ADB  will  help  the  PRC  build  a  harmonious  society  and  boost  rural \ndevelopment in areas where growth and development are lagging. The central government has a program to revitalize \nthe  northeast  region  as  an  industrial  hub,  and  the  regional  transport  network  development  plan  is  an  important \ncomponent of this program. Also, the Heilongjiang Poverty Reduction Development Regulation prioritizes transport. \n \nThe project will continue ADB's engagement with the Heilongjiang provincial government in the transport sector. It will \nprovide  more  reliable  and  safe  transport  services  to  local  people,  which  will  contribute  to  economic  development, \nlivelihood improvement, and indirect poverty reduction. The highway will establish a direct connection between Yichun \nand Bei\u2019an, and improve transport between Wudalianchi and Nenjiang. Integrated with improving the local road network, \nthe highway will improve transport between the forestry area in east and agricultural area in west, promote trade of the \ntwo  areas,  and  add  economic  value  to  their  production  of  grains,  nontimber  forest  products,  and  livestock,  as  well  as \nfacilitate \ninfrastructure  services  (e.g.,  health,  education,  water,  and \ntelecommunications) to be upgraded by local government.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\nthe  provision  of  social  and  physical \n\n1.  Key Issues  \n\nThe  poverty  analysis  is  based  on  published  statistical  data,  socioeconomic  questionnaire  survey  of  513  households, \nfocus  group  discussions,  and  key  informant  interviews  in  the  project  area.  Heilongjiang  is  an  agricultural  and  forestry \nprovince,  and  also  a  relatively  undeveloped  province.  About  44,500  people  or  8.7%  of  the  total  population  in \n48 townships and towns along the proposed highway corridor are categorized as poverty population. Most of the rural \npoor are living in 50 poverty villages, while the rest are scattered in nonpoverty villages. Poverty is also present on the \nstate forest farms. The causes of poverty in the project area include poor quality farmland in mountainous areas, poor \nirrigation systems, poor transportation conditions, and natural disasters. In state forest farms, the main causes of poverty \nare  unemployment  due  to  the  natural  forest  logging  ban  program,  lack  of  farmland,  and  financial  risks  of  marketing \nnontimber forest products.  \n \n2.  Design Features \n\nThe  improved  access  afforded  by  the  proposed  highway  and  bus  services  will  remove  transport  constraints  and \ncontribute  to  social  and  economic  development.  In  poverty  villages,  the  project  will  be  complemented  by  poverty \nreduction  activities  carried  out  by  the  local  government,  such  as  village  road  and  bridge  construction,  water  supply, \nlivestock  technical  services,  cable  TV,  and  employment  training.  During  construction  of  the  highway  and  bus  stations, \nabout  CNY6.767  billion  will  be  invested,  much  of  which  will  flow  into  the  rural  townships  and  towns.  About  19,000 \nunskilled  and  skilled  labors  will  be  required  during  the  project  construction  and  about  790  will  be  required  during  its \noperation and maintenance.  \n \nThe  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Transportation  Department  (HPTD)  and  the  local  governments  have  agreed  to  take  the \nfollowing  actions  to  enhance  project  benefits  for  the  poor:  (i)  hiring  laborers  from  poverty  villages  and  households, \n(ii) providing  special  support  for  poor  households  affected  by  resettlement,  (iii)  integrating  poverty  reduction  and  road \nimprovement programs, (iv) providing technical training programs, and (v) promoting nonfarm employment opportunities. \n \nC.    Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n\nNot applicable \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nStakeholder analysis was conducted as part of the poverty and social assessment for this project. The key stakeholders \ninclude  town  and  township  residents,  state  farm  workers,  state  forest  workers,  small  businesses,  adversely  affected \npeople,  HPTD,  and  the  implementing  agencies.  Other  government  stakeholders  include  Civil  Affairs  Bureau,  Labor, \nForestry,  Poverty  Reduction  Office,  Health  Bureau,  women\u2019s  federation,  and  Religious  and  Minority  Affairs  Bureau. \nDuring  project  preparation,  a  socioeconomic  survey  of  513  households,  stakeholder  consultation  workshops,  focus \ngroup discussions, and key informant interviews were conducted to gain a better understanding of the demands, needs, \nand interests of the stakeholders.  \n \nThe project roads will benefit 512,000 people in 48 townships, towns, state farms, and state forest farms; the improved \nrural  transport  services  will  benefit  431,500  people  in  12  townships,  towns,  state  farms,  and  state  forest  farms.  The \nwestern section of the project area is mainly a farming region,  where agricultural production and profitability has been \ngood the past decade. The eastern section of the project area is mountainous and mainly forested; however, the state \nforest farms are not profitable due to the ban on logging old forests. The proposed highway will link these two areas and \nenable the local economies to become more diversified and integrated. Also, the highway will encourage more tourism \nbusinesses by linking the forest-based tourism in Yichun with tourism based on the old volcanic formation and springs in \nWudalianchi.  \n \nThe  potential  adverse  social  impacts  from  the  project  include  (i)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  (ii)  increased \naccidents due to higher speeds and mixed traffic, (iii) transmissible diseases spread by the large construction workforce, \nand (iv) disruption to local communities during construction. Mitigations measures to address these issues are included \nin the resettlement plans  and the social development  action plan (SDAP). A few ethnic minority villages in the  project \narea can benefit from the project; they will not be adversely impacted. HPTD and the local government have agreed to \ntake following actions to enhance project benefits for five ethnic minority villages: (i) integrated poverty reduction, road \nimprovement and tourism development programs, and (ii) cultural protection and development. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nPublic  consultation  and  participation  was  a  core  element  of  the  project  design  and  it  will  continue  during  project \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Several rounds of public consultations in the project areas were carried out \nto  prepare  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  resettlement  plans,  and  SDAP.  The  consultations  included \n(i) explaining  the  project  components;  (ii)  soliciting  ideas,  suggestions,  and  comments  on  the  potential  impacts  of  the \nproject; and (iii) presenting the findings of the analyses and the proposed social and environmental mitigation measures. \nThe results of these meetings and concerns of the affected people, particularly the poor and women were integrated into \nthe project design, EMP, resettlement plans and/or SDAP. Ongoing consultations will be carried out by the implementing \nagencies to understand and meet the evolving needs and expectations of the stakeholders, and to encourage the active \ninvolvement of local communities.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n   Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.    Was a consultation and participation plan prepared? \nThe public consultation and participation will be carried out during implementation of the resettlement plans, SDAP, and \nEMP so the problems and concerns of affected people are properly addressed in a timely manner. The consultation and \nparticipation plan is included in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \n\nThe  major  benefits  of  the  project  include  (i)  enhanced  economic  development;  (ii)  an  improved  west\u2013east  road \nconnection;  (iii) improved  rural  transport  services;  (iv)  direct  job  creation  during  construction;  and  (v)  indirect  job \nopportunities  due  to  economic  development  (e.g.,  tourism  and  nontimber  forest  products).  The  project  does  not  have \nany significant adverse impacts on women, except for impacts common to both men and women (i.e., land acquisition). \n\n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to \nand use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n  Other actions/measures (see the SDAP)     \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nThe  SDAP  includes  measures  to  enhance  benefits  to  women  and  prevent  any  adverse  impacts.  HPTD  and  the  local \ngovernments have agreed to take the following actions: (i) coordinate with contractors and the local women's federation \nto  hire  women  for  project  construction;  (ii)  hire  women  for  highway,  rural  road,  and  bus  station  operation  and \nmaintenance;  (iii)  target  women  and  children  for  road  safety  awareness;  (iv)  provide  HIV,  AIDS,  STI  awareness  for \nwomen at high risk; (v) provide 50% of livelihood training for affected households to women; (vi) promote microcredit for \nwomen;  (vii)  provide  technical  training  on  organic  farming  and  tourism  for  women;  and  (viii)  organize  periodic \nconsultations with women and encourage their participation in the project implementation. \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nIssue \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures Included in \nDesign \n\n Full Plan \n Short Plan \n Resettlement  \nFramework \n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n(SDAP) \n Indigenous Peoples \nFramework \n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n(SDAP) \n No Action \n\n Action \n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n(SDAP) \n No Action \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA full resettlement plan for the proposed \nhighway and a short resettlement plan for \nthe bus stations were prepared in \naccordance with the PRC Land \nAdministration Law (2004) and ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) to \nensure that affected people will be made \nbetter off, or at least not worse off, as a \nresult of the project. \nThere are 9,090 ethnic minorities (1.7% of \ntotal population) living in the project area. \nThey mainly include Hui, Mongolian, and \nKorean. They have been integrated into \nthe mainstream society and will equally \nbenefit from the increased and improved \nroad and transport facilities and services; \nin addition, some specific actions are \nincluded in the SDAP to enhance benefits \nin a culturally sensitive manner.  \nThe project will create about 6,335 job \nopportunities per year during the 3-year \nconstruction and about 790 for operation \nand maintenance. Employees involved in \nthe project will be protected in accordance \nwith the PRC labor laws and other \nregulations and guidelines issued by \nHPTD; this will be monitored closely. \nThe class II highway section will not be \ntolled and the expressway and class I \nsections will adhere to existing toll \nstructures in Heilongjiang. \nHealth and safety training will be provided \nto the construction workers. The project \nmanagement office will ensure that \ncontractors will receive and disseminate \ninformation on health and safety issues. \nThe SDAP contains measures to prevent \nHIV/AIDS and other transmissible \ndisease. \n\nIV.  MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\nAre  social  indicators  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  to  facilitate  monitoring  of  social  development \nactivities and/or social impacts during project implementation?  \nThe design and monitoring framework will require the collection of some socioeconomic monitoring indicators, which are \nprovided  in  the  project  performance  monitoring  system,  including  baseline  data.  The  social  safeguard  measures  are \nproject management activities which will be monitored separately, as specified in the resettlement plans and SDAP. \na ADB. 2006.

The  roads \n1. \ncomponent involves the construction and improvement of the 353.8 kilometers (km) of provincial \nroad  between  Yichun  and  the  provincial  border  with  Inner  Mongolia,  as  well  as  three  branch \nroads  totaling  5.1  km.  The  bus  service  component  includes  the  construction  or  upgrading  of \n20 rural bus stations. The resettlement planning and implementation is designed to ensure that \naffected  persons  will  be  better-off  or  at  least  not  worse-off  as  a  result  of  the  project.  A  full \nresettlement  plan  for  the  road  component  and  a  short  resettlement  plan  for  the  bus  service \ncomponent were prepared. \n\n \n\n2. \nThe  project  will  permanently  acquire  1,365  hectares  (ha)  of  land:  518.4 ha  of  cultivated \nland  (38.0%),  642.4  ha  of  forestland  (47.1%),  and  204.1  ha  of  other  kinds  of  land  (14.9%). \nTemporary land use will require 134.6 ha, among which cultivated land is 51.5 ha, forestland is \n35.6  ha,  and  wasteland  is  47.5 ha.  The  permanent  land  acquisition  will  affect  about  3,500 \nhouseholds  or  about  14,000 people.  On  average,  only  7.5%  of  each  affected  household's \nfarmland will be acquired; most affected villages have abundant farmland. Only 10 households \nand  1 enterprise  will  need  to  be  relocated.  Also,  some  productive  assets,  ground  attachments, \nand  public  infrastructure  and  facilities  will  be  affected,  including  electric  poles,  cables,  high \nvoltage  towers,  wells,  fences,  toilets,  roads,  and  trees.  Of  the  total  affected  population,  2,000 \nhouseholds with about 8,000 people are rural residents, and 1,500 households with about 6,000 \npeople are state farm workers and state forestry farm workers.  \n\n3. \nCompensation  for  permanent  land  loss  is  based  on  the  Land  Administration  Law  of  the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  (2004)  and  the  Implementation  Regulations  of  Integrated  Price  for \nLand Acquisition Based on the Region and Location of Heilongjiang province (2009). The house \ncompensation is based on negotiations with the affected people with reference to the local price \nstandards.  The  resettlement  plans  comply  with  the  People's  Republic  of  China  laws,  the \nregulations  of  Heilongjiang  province,  and \nInvoluntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). Based on consultations with local governments and affected people, \nand  the  integrated  price  in  the  area,  the  respective  city  and  county  agencies  adopted  a  set  of \ncompensation standards.  \n\nthe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n\n4. \nThe  resettlement  principles  established  for  the  project  are  (i)  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary  resettlement  should  be  avoided  or  minimized  where  feasible  by  developing  and \ncomparing  different  design  alternatives;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements  provided  are  based \non integrated land price or replacement value and must be adequate to allow those affected to \nmaintain at least their preproject standard of living, with the prospect of improvements; (iii) lands \ntemporarily  occupied  and  the  period  for  disruption  are  to  be  kept  to  a  minimum;  (iv)  the  per \ncapita  landholding  after  land  acquisition  will  be  sufficient  to  maintain  the  previous  livelihood \nstandard; (v) where land allocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood \nstandards,  other  income-generating  activities  will  be  provided;  (vi)  a  preferential  policy  will  be \nprovided  to  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  the  payment  of  special  subsidies,  minimum  living \nguarantee, and employment; (vii) all people affected will be adequately informed about eligibility, \ncompensation rates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; \nand (viii) close monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to resolve any problems. \n\nThe  people  affected  were  notified  of  the  key  elements  of  the  resettlement  plan.  On \n5. \nvarious  occasions  during  meetings, \ninterviews,  group  discussions,  public  consultation \nworkshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  participated  in  the \nplanning, and their concerns are integrated in the resettlement plan. An information booklet on \nthe  project  was  distributed  to  affected  villages  and  households  in  January  2009.  The \nresettlement  plan  was  made  publicly  available  to  forestry  farms,  state  farms,  and  affected \nvillages in September 2009. The respective cities and counties will establish project resettlement \nunits for supervising the implementation, continuing public consultation, monitoring progress, and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nresponding to grievances. Procedures to address grievances will be set up and explanations are \nincluded in the resettlement information booklets. \n\n6. \nFor land acquisition, generally 30% of the land compensation will be paid in cash to the \naffected villages to be used for the basic infrastructure improvement and 70% will be paid to the \naffected  households  directly.  For  residential  houses  and  nonresidential  houses \nto  be \ndemolished, all compensation will be paid directly to owners. The payment will be made in cash \naccording  to  the  appraised  value  of  the  property.  Households  that  have  to  relocate  will  also \nreceive  a  relocation  allowance.  Compensation  for  standing  crops,  auxiliaries,  and  other  assets \nwill also be paid directly to the affected units and households.  \n\nthey  can  use \n\n7. \nThe resettlement strategy has two aspects: (i) replacement of housing, and (ii) restoration \nof livelihoods and income. For people to be relocated, a new house plot for house construction \nwill  be  provided  as  well  as  assistance  from  local  government  to  construct  or  find  available \nhousing  close  to  their  original  community  as  they  prefer.  For  people  who  lose  farmland,  the \nmeasures for economic revitalization include (i) 70% of the land compensation will be paid to the \naffected  household,  which \nfarms  nearby; \n(ii) readjustment  of  farmland  using  reserve  land  in  villages  or  reassignment  of  land  to  affected \nworkers on state farms; (iii) provision of employment opportunities during the project construction \nphase; (iv) local governments will provide preferential policies for items such as credit and taxes \nto the affected people to encourage them to engage in other sectors, such as small businesses; \n(v) local governments will provide agricultural and nonagricultural skills training; and (vi) after the \ncompletion  of  the  highway,  the  affected  households  will  be  given  priority  to  be  employed  in \nroutine  highway  maintenance.  The  five  affected  county  or  city  governments  will  all  ensure  that \nthe  affected  people  will  have  priority  to  be  trained  each  year  and  the  training  budget  will  be \nprovided  by  the  county  governments.  The  development  opportunity  derived  from  the  project \nroads  and  compensation  for  land  acquisition  should  enable  most  households  to  increase \nnonagricultural production and improve their income. \n\nfrom  state \n\nfarmland \n\nto  rent \n\n8. \nFor  the  project  highway,  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  take  overall \nresponsibility  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  PMO  will  make  payments  to  the \nHeilongjiang Provincial Land and Resources Department, which in turn will allocate funds to the \ncounty  administrations  to  make  compensation  payments  to  affected  entities,  villages,  and \nhouseholds.  The  city,  county,  farm,  and  forestry  farm  project  resettlement  offices  will  have  at \nleast one full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and resettlement. They will work closely \nwith  relevant  village  officials  and  land  administration  bureaus,  and  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing and monitoring the resettlement. For the bus stations, local transport bureaus will \npay  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  compensation  to  the  county  land  administration  bureau, \nwhich will then make payments to the affected villages, state entities, or households.  \n\nThe  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  CNY326.7  million,1  including \n9. \nland  taxes  and  contingencies.  Implementation  of  resettlement  for  the  road  component \ncommenced  in  October  2009  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2010;  land \nacquisition for bus stations will be done in 2011.  \n\n10. \nInternal  and  external  monitoring  of  resettlement  implementation  will  be  conducted  as \nspecified  in  the  resettlement  plans.  Internal  monitoring  and  supervision  will  be  done  by  each \ncounty, city, farm, and forestry farm resettlement office to ensure compliance with the provisions \nof  the  resettlement  plans.  External  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  carried  out  by  an \nindependent  agency  under  contract  to  the  PMO.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted \ndirectly to Heilongjiang Provincial Transportation Department and the Asian Development Bank \non  a  semiannual  basis  the  first  year;  annual  evaluation  reports  will  be  submitted  for  2  years \nthereafter. \n \n                                                 \n1  Includes CNY247,000 cost of land acquisition for the 20 bus stations. \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 18 March 2010) \n \n\u2013 \n", "yuan (CNY) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "CNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "= \n= \n", "$0.14650 \nCNY6.8260 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nBCTAS \nCO2  \nEIA   \nEIRR \nEMP  \nHPG  \nHPHB \nHPTD \nITS   \nLIBOR  \nNOx  \nPIU   \nPMO \nPRC \nRAMS  \nSDAP \nSEIA \nWACC  \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013\u2013 \n\u2013  \n\u2013  \n\u2013  \n\u2013  \n\u2013 \n\u2013  \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  \n\u2013  \n\u2013 \n\u2013  \n\u2013 \n\u2013  \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBei'an County Transport Administration Station \ncarbon dioxide  \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nHeilongjiang provincial government \nHeilongjiang Provincial Highway Bureau \nHeilongjiang Provincial Transportation Department \nintelligent transport system  \nLondon interbank offered rate \noxides of nitrogen  \nproject implementation unit \nproject management office \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nroad asset management system \nsocial development action plan \nsummary environmental impact assessment \nweighted average cost of capital  \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "ha \nkm \nkm2 \nkm/h \nm \nm2 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "hectare \nkilometer \nsquare kilometer \nkilometer per hour \nmeter \nsquare meter \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year of the government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars  \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "C.
