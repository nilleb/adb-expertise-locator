The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in \nAssessment  Supplementary Appendix G. \n   \nProject Description  The proposed Project is Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) third \nproject in agriculture and natural resources in the Kyrgyz Republic \nand adapts the concept and approach of the ongoing area-based \nAgriculture  Area  Development  Project  in  Chui  Oblast  to  three \noblasts in the south of the Kyrgyz Republic: Batken, Jalalabad, \nand Osh.  \n \nThe Project focuses on the lowest level of government, that is, aiyl \nokmotu. The Project will (i) provide support for agricultural and \nlegal advisory services by improving the capacity, technical scope, \nquality,  and  outreach  of  existing  advisory  service  providers; \nfacilitating access to existing legal services; and increasing the \navailability of and access to credit by farmers; (ii) increase and \nimprove  contractual  arrangements  between  farmers  and \nagribusinesses  for  input  supply,  machinery  services,  and \nwholesale  and  processing  enterprises;  improve  agribusiness \nperformance;  increase  the  availability  of  and  access  to \nappropriate financing facilities for agribusinesses; and increase \npublic investment in physical market infrastructure; (iii) develop \nwater user associations (WUAs) further and rehabilitate irrigation \nand drainage systems in cooperation with the World Bank; and \n(iv)  support  a  holistic  and  participatory  approach  to  the \nsustainable use of pasture lands and the improvement of orchard \nmanagement.  \n \nThe Project aims to integrate ongoing and planned activities and \nto contract available service providers for project implementation \nwhere feasible. \n   \nRationale  The  agriculture  sector  continues  to  experience  substantial \nadjustments  in  its  transition  to  a  market-oriented  economy. \nDespite  its  importance  to  the  economy  and  recent  growth, \nagriculture continues to underperform, as many of the farms and \nagroprocessing  facilities  are  not  operating  efficiently,  are  not \nprofitable, and in some cases are not financially viable. \n ", "iv   \n \n  The key problems being addressed are the low productivity of \nland and the low profitability of agriculture. The key constraints \ncontinue to be the absence of a land market, the nontransparent \nuse of the Land Redistribution Fund, and the poor administration \nand management of pasture lands; the lack of readily available \nand accessible agricultural inputs and the need to reorient various \nservices,  such  as  veterinary,  machinery,  and  advisory  and \nresearch services, to the market system and their need for further \ncapacity  development  to  provide  effective  services;  the \ndeteriorating irrigation and drainage infrastructure; the need for \nimproved  water  management;  and  the  limited  access  to  and \navailability of micro and rural finance, especially for investment \nlending. \n \nUnder the Agriculture Area Development Project (AADP), a new \nconcept and approach to ADB assistance in the Kyrgyz Republic \nwas developed. This approach is holistic in addressing the key \nconstraints  and  issues,  integrated  in  terms  of  unifying \ninterventions  in  specific  geographic  areas  and  coordinated  in \nterms  of  partnerships  with  other  projects  and  outsourcing  to \neffective local service providers. Both the Government and ADB \nhave  been  satisfied  with  the  progress  of  the  AADP  and  the \nGovernment has requested further adaptation of this concept and \napproach to the country\u2019s southern regions. \n \nThe grant component of the Project will improve the agricultural \nknowledge and capacity of farmers; prepare plans, maps, and \ninvest  in  pastures;  prepare  plans  and  invest  in  orchards;  and \nprocure  international  and  national  consultants  for  farm \ndevelopment,  agribusiness  advisory  services,  irrigation  and \ndrainage  rehabilitation,  orchard  management,  and  project \nmanagement.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project\u2019s  expected  impact  is  region-wide  adoption  of \nimproved  agricultural,  orchard,  and  pasture  management \ntechniques. The expected outcome of the Project is a sustainable \nincrease in land productivity and profitability.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the project is estimated at $31.23 million, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  of  $2.80  million,  $3.75  million  for \nphysical  and  price  contingencies,  and  $0.52  million  in  interest \ncharges  during  implementation.  ADB  will  finance  $20.0  million \nequivalent\u2500$15 million equivalent from the Asian Development \nFund (ADF) resources and $5 million with an ADF IX grant. The \nGlobal Environment Facility will finance $2.5 million equivalent, \nthe Government, $6.81 million equivalent, and beneficiaries, $1.92 \nmillion equivalent.  \n   ", "  v\nFinancing Plan  A loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR 9,925,000 ($15.0 \nmillion) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be provided. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, \nan interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nas are set forth in the Financing Agreement. The loan will meet \nthe costs of the credit line for farms and agribusiness; the advisory \nservices for agribusinesses; the public investment in marketing \ninfrastructure;  the  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure \nrehabilitation; the WUA technical credit; the equipment for WUA \nsupport units; and the costs of office equipment and vehicles, \ntraining,  workshops  and  seminars,  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsurveys,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  for  vehicles  and \nequipment,  support  staff,  and  utilities  for  project  management. \nThe ADF IX grant of $5 million will finance the training of trainers \nand  farmers;  the  planning  and  mapping  of  and  investment  in \npastures;  the  planning  of  and  investment  in  orchards;  the \ninternational  and  national  consultants  for  farm  development, \nirrigation and drainage rehabilitation, orchard management and \nproject  management;  and  the  support  staff  and  related  office \nexpenses  for  project  management.  The  proposed  Global \nEnvironment Facility grant of $2.5 million will meet the costs of \nadditional  training  of  trainers,  farmer  field  schools,  and  village \nadvisory  services;  pasture  planning,  infrastructure,  and \nimprovement,  monitoring,  and  capacity  development  for  aiyl \nokmotu  and  pasture  user  groups;  international  and  national \nconsultants  for  land  improvement;  and  equipment,  vehicles, \ncommunications,  support  staff,  workshops  and  seminars, \nmonitoring and evaluation, staff training, and communications and \nreport production for project management. The Government will \nprovide  in-kind  contributions  to  finance  taxes  and  duties  and \nbudget support for WUA support unit costs and off-farm irrigation \nand drainage system O&M costs. The WUAs will finance O&M of \nthe rehabilitated infrastructure on completion and repay 25% of \nthe costs of irrigation and rehabilitation construction.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The loan funds will be provided by the Government to the Ministry \nTerms  of Agriculture, Water Resources and Processing Industry as a \ngrant except for a $4 million equivalent credit line to be channeled \nthrough  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MOEF)  to \nparticipating financial institutions. The MOEF will onlend the funds \nin som or US dollars. The participating financial institutions will \nrelend  to  subborrowers  under  separate  loan  agreements \nacceptable to ADB. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \n ", "vi   \n \nImplementation  The management arrangements for the Project comprise a project \nArrangements  steering  committee,  an  Executing  Agency,  a  central  project \nmanagement  unit,  and  two  regional  offices.  Various  Project \nactivities will be contracted out to local service providers. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Water  Resources,  and  Processing \nIndustry. \n   \nProcurement  The procurement of goods, related services, and civil works will \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, \nas amended from time to time). \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  provide  2,655  person-months  of  consulting \nservices comprising 96 person-months of international consultants \nand  2,559  person-months  of  national  consultants.  The \ninternational  and  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(April 2006, as amended from time to time) using consulting firms, \nfull technical proposals, and quality- and cost-based selection.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The benefits of the Project are expected to be increases in the \nBeneficiaries  productivity  and  profitability  of  farms  and  agribusiness.  These \nbenefits  are  expected  to  derive  from  the  integrated \nimplementation  of  activities  to  generate  the  following  benefits: \nincreased  knowledge  and  better  farming  practices;  increased \nvalue  added  and  improved  performance  of  agribusinesses; \nreduced  waterlogging  and  salinity  and  reclaimed  lands  from \nrehabilitated irrigation and drainage infrastructure and improved \nwater  management;  improved  planning  and  management  of \npasture lands and orchards; and reduced land degradation. \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  a  population  of  158,500  in  31,000 \nhouseholds  in  the  3  oblasts.  Project  beneficiaries  will  include \nhouseholds  that  have  an  allocated  land  share  as  well  as \nhouseholds who have only a household plot, but no allocated land \nshare. About 58% of the beneficiaries live below the poverty line. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  investment  in  WUA  development  aims  to  establish \nsustainable WUAs. The 5-year financial and O&M plans prepared \nby the WUAs are intended to ensure that these objectives are \nachievable.  There  is  a  moderate  risk  that  WUA  collection  of \nirrigation service fees will be poor and that some WUAs will find it \nsocially unacceptable to raise irrigation service fees. If these risks \nmaterialize, the outcome is likely to be nonrepayment of the 25% \nof funds to the Government rather than the collapse of WUAs \ndepending on how the MOEF\u2019s State Development Fund enforces \nrepayment.  \n ", "  vii\n  In their current form, farm advisory services are highly dependent \non finance from development partners and are not financially self-\nsustainable. Competition between service providers partly brought \nabout by the opportunity to bid for contacts such as those under \nthe  AADP  will  help  drive  rationalization  of  the  farm  advisory \nservices.  The  key  to  achieving  financial  self-sufficiency  is \nimproved quality of services, which the Project\u2019s farm advisory \nservice interventions seek to achieve. \n \nThe Project will invest in the rehabilitation of storage and cooling \nfacilities and recognizes the need for financial sustainability of \nthese  facilities  by  requiring  appropriate  mechanisms  for  their \nmanagement, financial viability, and sustainability. \n \nThe  pasture  land  management  plans  will  include  financial \nprojections  for  each  of  the  infrastructure  investments  to  be \nfinanced under project grants. If the investments do not generate \nsufficient financial incentives for the aiyl okmotu and communities, \nrehabilitated facilities and improved pastures may not be properly \nmaintained, thus proper selection of investments based on criteria \nthat include financial sustainability will be critical. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "o o\n71  00'E 78  00'E\nKYRGYZ  REPUBLIC\nSOUTHERN AGRICULTURE AREA DEVELOPMENT\nK A Z A K H S T A N\nTyup\no o\n42  30'N Dzhergalan 42  30'N\nShopokov Cholpon-Ata\nKara Kol\nKara Balta CHBUISIHKEK Tokmok Balykchy Lake Issyk-Kul\nMaimak Talas ISSYK-KUL\nKochkorka\nTALAS\nChaek\nToktogul Lake Song-Kul\nToktogul Reservoir\nNARYN\nKarakul Naryn\nTerek Sai JALAL-ABAD\nTash Kumyr\nShamaldy Sai Kok Yangak\nMassy\nKochkor Ata\nBazar Korgon Jalal-Abad Lake Chatyr-Kul N\nAndizhan Reservoir\nUZBEKISTAN Suzak Uzgen\nKara Su\nOsh\nAravan 0 50 100\nKilometers\nNaiman\nTAJIKISTAN Kyzyl Kiya OSH\nBatken Frunze Pulgon Project District\n38o  00'N PEOPLE'S    REPUBLIC 38o  00'N\nSulyukta Haidarkan Sary Tash OF   CHINA  Project Oblast\nNational Capital\nIsfana BATKEN\nProvincial Capital\nCity/Town\nMain Road\nRailway\nTAJIKISTAN River\nProvincial/Oblast Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n6\n-4\n0\n9\n4 o o\n H 71  00'E 78  00'E\nR", " \nI.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  At the request of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  approved  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  Southern \nAgriculture Area Development Project.1 The TA was carried out from August 2005 to July 2006. \nThe  participatory  process  for  Project  preparation  was  facilitated  through  regional  TA  on \nparticipatory approaches.2 Two regional workshops and one national workshop were held for \nabout  137  participants,  of  which  27%  were  women.  The  participants  consisted  of \nrepresentatives  of  the  central  Government,  local  governments,  farming  households,  and \ndevelopment partners; members of cooperatives and water user associations (WUAs); staff of \ncredit unions and nongovernment organizations (NGOs); and owners of agro-enterprises. The \nworkshops  discussed  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  experience  with  participatory  approaches  and \nmade recommendations to be considered in designing the Project. This report is based on the \nTA feasibility study; the participatory process workshops; the findings of ADB workshops; and \nthe discussions held with Government officials, the private sector, and development partners. \nThe Project is adapting the concept and approach of the Agriculture Area Development Project \n(AADP)3 in the Chui Oblast, which was approved in 1999 and is still under implementation. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a small, mountainous, landlocked country. The Government\u2019s \nstructural reform program has achieved macroeconomic stability and reasonable growth. The \npolitical upheavals of 2005 have been stabilized and gross domestic product (GDP) growth is \nexpected to be 5% in 2006 and 5.5% in 2007. Growth still remains heavily dependent on gold \nproduction. Inflation has remained below 5%,4 the budget deficit has declined from 54% of GDP \nin 2003 to 4% in 2005, government revenues have increased from 22.2% of GDP  in 2002 \n24.9% in 2005 of GDP and the exchange rate has remained relatively stable since 2002. The \nGovernment  remains  within  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  targets  under  the  Poverty \nReduction  and  Growth  Facility.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  remains  highly  indebted,  and  the \nGovernment has requested debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries initiative, but it \ncurrently exceeds the initiative\u2019s revenue threshold of 250% by a substantial margin.  \n \n4.  Poverty levels are declining. Based on per head consumption, poverty declined from \n49.9% in 2003 to 45.9% in 2004 and extreme poverty declined from 17.2% to 13.4%.5 During \nthe same period, urban poverty declined from 35.7% to 28.3% and rural poverty declined from \n57.4% to 55.5%; however, rural poverty continues to be significantly higher than urban poverty. \nInequality is increasing, with the Gini coefficient6 increasing from 0.29 in 2001 to 0.33 in 2004, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

The target for \n2006 is 5.7%. \n5  In 2003, new poverty line indicators based on per head consumption were adopted as the official measure of \npoverty incidence.  \n6  The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality based on an index from 0 to 1, with 0 meaning everyone has the \nsame income. ", "2   \n \nparticularly in rural areas. Poverty levels also vary significantly from region to region. In addition, \nmuch of the population lives close to the margin between poor and nonpoor, resulting in a \nsignificant degree of transient poverty. Batken Oblast is the poorest province, with 77.8% of its \npopulation being poor, while Chui Oblast is the least poor, with a poverty rate of 21.7%.7   \n \n5.  The agriculture sector is extremely important to the economy. It accounts for more than \n33% of GDP (average for 2000\u20132004), 50% of employment (75% in rural areas), and 11% of \nexports. Of the total land area of 19.6 million hectares (ha), pasture land accounts for the largest \narea, 47%. Only about 7% of the country is arable land, of which about 80% is irrigated. \n \n6.  Since  1996,  agricultural  growth  has  increasingly  been  driven  by  private  small  farm \nproduction.  Between  1996  and  2004,  average  yields  increased  substantially:  61%  for \nvegetables, 24% for grains, 13% for cotton, and 8% for milk. During the same period, gross \noutput increased by 55% for vegetables, 8% for grains, 95% for cotton, and 34% for milk. The \nshare of production from state farms declined from 22% in 1995 to 6% in 2004. With the \nemergence of slightly more commercially oriented small private farms since 1999, the share of \nproduction from household plots declined from 65% in 1995 to 40% in 2004. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  The agriculture sector continues to experience substantial adjustments in its transition to \na  market-oriented  economy.  Despite  its  importance  to  the  economy  and  recent  growth, \nagriculture continues to underperform, as many farms and agroprocessing facilities are not \noperating  efficiently,  are  not  profitable,  and  in  some  cases  are  not  financially  viable.  In \naddressing the key problems of low productivity and profitability in agriculture, several key \nissues pertain to land, agricultural inputs and services, infrastructure, and finance (Appendix 2). \n \n8.  The absence of a viable land market, the nontransparent use of the Land Redistribution \nFund,8 and the poor administration and management of pasture lands are directly inhibiting the \nproductivity and effective use of these lands. Most arable land is privately owned, and even \nthough a functional lease market exists, the land sales market is largely inactive. The Land \nRedistribution Fund is managed by aiyl okmotu,9 and land is mostly leased on a competitive \nbasis.  However,  the  transparency  and  competitiveness  of  the  leasing  process  varies.  Aiyl \nokmotu governments administer the lowest-level pastures, raion administrations administer the \nmidlevel  pastures,  and  oblast  administrations  administer  the  high  mountain  pastures.  In \naddition, forest farms lease out pastures from the Forest Fund. The State Land Development \nInstitute  monitors  pasture  land  use  and  quality.  The  current  pasture  administration  and \nmanagement  system  is  not  sustainable  because  of  a  lack  of  transparency,  no  effective \nmonitoring of pasture conditions, and of investments to improve access to and the quality of \npastures. Extensive land degradation caused by salinity, waterlogging, erosion, and overgrazing \nis also evident. Some current land management practices reflect a lack of knowledge, training, \nand experience.  \n \n9.  Agricultural inputs and services are slowly developing, but need to be reoriented to the \nmarket system and require further capacity development to provide effective services. The \nsupply of agricultural inputs is largely in private sector hands. While nitrogen fertilizer is widely \navailable, other fertilizers are not. Agrochemicals are available, but the verification of origin and \nquality is not always satisfactory. Application equipment is often inaccurate and dangerous to \nthe health of users. Under the former Soviet Union, the Kyrgyz Republic was an important \n                                                 \n7  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2006. Country Development Strategy (2006\u20132010). Bishkek. Draft. \n8  Land Redistribution Fund comprises 25% of agricultural land held by the state and controlled by aiyl okmotu. It is to \nbe used for state-run farms such as for seed and cattle breeding or allocated to individuals who did not receive \ntheir title to land in the initial allocation. \n9  Known locally as ayil okmotu, these are the lowest level of local government and may include more than one \nvillage. ", "      3\nproducer of seed and has the potential to multiply imported seeds for both the domestic market \nand for re-export, but will need to address the research institutes\u2019 limited resources for field \ntesting,  the  absence  of  arrangements  for  royalty  payments,  the  concentration  of  seed \nmultiplication  and  distribution  on  a  small  number  of  large  farms,  and  the  need  to  adopt \ninternational measures and standards to comply with World Trade Organization requirements. \nThe demand for inputs is also constrained by a lack of finance. \n \n10.  Smallholders account for most agricultural production, but the various services available \nto them have not been able to adapt to the changing farm structure. The state veterinary system \nhas diminished because of budget cuts, and the current veterinary service does not have the \nstaff, budget, working conditions, and facilities to fulfill the tasks associated with legislation, \nregulation, control, and monitoring, and private veterinary practices have not developed quickly \nenough to fill the vacuum. The value added to agricultural production is limited, as processing \nunits face difficulties in securing a consistent quantity and quality of raw materials; contractual \narrangements are weak; and collection, storage, and cooling facilities are poor. Machinery is \ngenerally in a poor state of repair and is inappropriate for small farms. This means that the \ndemand for and supply of machinery services and the absence of finance further constrain \ninvestment in more appropriate machinery. The Rural Advisory Service is well established and \nhas a national network that includes seven oblast offices and a network of raion-based advisers, \nbut the quality of services varies between oblasts, and outreach is low at around 25% of all \nvillages and 6% of farmers within each village. The research institutes lack clear research \nstrategies and the resources to implement them. Farmers and the extension services perceive \nresearch to be irrelevant to farmers\u2019 needs and the link between research and extension is \nweak.  \n \n11.  Irrigation and drainage infrastructure is in need of rehabilitation. The Kyrgyz Republic is \nhighly dependent on irrigated agriculture, with 80% (1.1 million ha) of the 1.4 million ha of arable \nland being irrigated. Constraints to efficient water management exist at the national, oblast, \nraion, and WUA levels. WUAs are responsible for the ownership and management of onfarm \nirrigation systems and the Department of Water Resources (DWR) of the Ministry of Agriculture, \nWater Resources, and Processing Industry (MAWRPI) is responsible for off-farm drainage and \nirrigation. The country has 434 WUAs, and these continue to require support in relation to (i) \nplanning  and  implementing  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  programs;  (ii)  undertaking \nfinancial management, in particular, estimating O&M costs and setting and collecting irrigation \nservice fees (ISFs);10 (iii) managing water allocation and improving water use efficiency; and (iv) \nresolving the incomplete transfer of the ownership of drainage and irrigation infrastructure from \naiyl okmotu to WUAs. WUA support units in each raion are providing training and consultancy to \naddress these problems. \n \n12.  The WUAs have inherited dilapidated irrigation and drainage systems. More than a third \nof existing systems have been rehabilitated, including off-farm systems and major structures \nunder  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project,  onfarm  systems  under  the  World \nBank\u2019s Onfarm Irrigation Project (OIP), and in Chui Oblast under the AADP. Other rehabilitation \nis being done by the Aga Khan Foundation, Winrock International, and others. Nevertheless, a \nvast area still requires rehabilitation, and the DWR has identified 82 schemes serving 235,000 \nha that require immediate rehabilitation. \n \n13.  The  provision  of  agricultural  finance  faces  both  supply-side  and  demand-side \nconstraints. The demand-side constraints are a result of low farm productivity and farmers\u2019 \nperceptions of high risk and of interest rates being excessively high. The supply-side constraints \ninclude (i) infeasible borrower applications, (ii) banks\u2019 inexperience in assessing agricultural \n                                                 \n10  Estimates indicate that ISFs will need to increase from an average cost of approximately Som230 per ha to \nSom1,000 per ha to cover onfarm O&M costs. \n ", "4   \n \ninvestment loans, (iii) absence of acceptable collateral, and (iv) banks\u2019 own limited access to \nfinance because of limited deposits. \n \n14.  Only  about  5%  of  commercial  bank  lending  is  for  agriculture,  storage,  and \nagroprocessing.11 The  Kyrgyz  Agriculture  Finance  Corporation  (KAFC)  lends  only  to  the \nagriculture sector and has a loan portfolio of $38.2 million,12 of which 8% is for agroprocessing. \nThe Financial Company for Savings and Credit Unions has assets of $10 million and lends to \ndiversified borrowers, including in agriculture. The microfinance market serves approximately \n102,241 borrowers and has a total outstanding loan portfolio of about $82 million. While the \nKyrgyz Republic has 139 microfinance institutions, three established microfinance institutions \ndominate the sector, namely, Foundation for International Community Assistance, Kompanion, \nand Bai Tushum, which lend approximately 85% of the microfinance institution portfolio. The \nmicrofinance sector includes 5 banks, 300 credit unions, and the KAFC. In addition, the country \nhas two wholesale lending institutions. As of the end of 2004, agriculture accounted for only \n12% of the outstanding loan portfolio of the microfinance institutions.13 There is considerable \nunmet demand for microfinance loans in the Kyrgyz Republic, with the National Bank of the \nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s (NBKR\u2019s) medium-term microfinance development strategy estimating the \ndemand for loans to be $24 million\u2013$40 million for farms and enterprises and $14 million\u2013$18 \nmillion for households.  \n \n15.  While the issues facing agricultural development are diverse, they are interrelated and \nshould be addressed as far as possible in a holistic, integrated, and coordinated manner. The \nsocial accounting matrix in the World Bank\u2019s Country Economic Memorandum 200514 shows \nhigh intersectoral linkage multipliers for all agricultural products above 2.6, with the multiplier for \nlivestock  products  (3.2-3.5)  exceeding  crop  products  (2.6-2.8).15 The  input  supply  industry \nmultiplier  is  2.7.  This  highlights  the  need  for  simultaneous  investment  in  upstream  and \ndownstream sectors to take full advantage of the multiplier effects of agricultural growth. \n \n16.  The World Bank\u2019s Agricultural Policy Update 200416 presents a social mobility matrix for \n662 households for 1999\u20132002. The study demonstrates the importance of agriculture in lifting \nthose in the lowest income quintile out of poverty and concludes that poverty is transient. During \n1999\u20132002, 54% of those in the lowest income quintile improved their income ranking, while \n75% of those in the second quintile maintained or improved their income ranking. The study \nconcluded that income mobility was driven by land reform and subsequent agricultural growth, \nwith the lowest quintile increasing agricultural sales by 335% compared with an average of \n111%  and  own  food  consumption  by  71%  compared  with  an  average  of  18%.  However, \nfollowing this impressive upward mobility, those who remained in the lowest quintile at the end \nof 2002 are constrained by a low agricultural asset base that limits their potential for further \nagricultural growth: they derive only 35% of their income from agriculture (compared with 45% \nfor the second, third, and fourth quintiles and 40% for the fifth quintile) and spend 47% of their \ncash on food. As long as nonagricultural opportunities remain limited, ensuring access to land \nand other agricultural assets is critical for increasing the incomes and food security of those in \nthe lowest quintile. Given the high percentage of cash income the lowest quintile spends on \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2004.

The development of the agriculture sector is guided by the comprehensive development \nframework  (to  2010)  and  the  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  for  2003\u20132005.  Further \nguidance is provided in various presidential decrees and addresses to the nation. According to \nthe comprehensive development framework, priorities until 2010 are cooperative development; \ndevelopment of peasant farms and agribusinesses; expansion of rural credit, mortgages, and \ninsurance; land registration; seed and cattle breeding; research and marketing; agricultural \nextension and veterinary services; processing and export development; improved water and \npasture management; and social development of villages. The Government\u2019s strategy also \nrecognizes  the  need  for  local  government  reform,  including  decentralization.  However,  the \ndelineation of responsibilities between the central Government and local governments is not \nclear.  Finances  and  local  budgets  are  still  largely  centralized  and  local  governments  are \nunderfunded.  \n \n18.  Government  Resolution  465  approved  the  agrarian  policy  concept  of  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic to 2010 on 22 June 2004. The main objectives of the concept include (i) providing the \ncountry\u2019s population with foodstuffs and industry with raw materials on a sustainable basis, (ii) \npreserving the environment; (iii) ensuring food safety, (iv) promoting the marketing and export of \nagricultural  and  processed  products,  and  (v)  reducing  poverty  and  undertaking  land  and \nagrarian reform and farm development. \n \n19.  Agricultural policy and the strategy framework are frequently revised. ADB is financing \nthe formulation of a new strategy to 2015 and this is expected to be completed in March 2007. \nThe  key  areas  being  addressed  include:  (i)  improved  services,  (ii)  agroprocessing  and \nmarketing, (iii) land market development, (iv) water resources management, (v) training and \nresearch  and  development,  (vi)  trade  and  tax  policy,  (vii)  rural  finance,  and  (viii)  rural \ndevelopment.  \n \n20.  Development assistance to agriculture and related areas is diverse in size, focus, scope, \nand location. A large number of aid-supported activities focus on the southern regions. Projects \nrange  from  small  pilot  activities  in  selected  raions  to  large,  nationwide  programs.  These \nprograms address all constraints to agricultural development, but to varying degrees and with \nvarying levels of coordination. In recent years, efforts have been made by development partners \nto harmonize practices, and in March 2003, the Kyrgyz Republic was selected as a pilot country \nfor harmonization, with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MOEF) being appointed as the \nexecuting agency. In addition, the Government and its development partners\u2014including the \nWorld Bank, ADB, United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) of the \nUnited  Kingdom,  and  the  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC)\u2014are \npreparing a joint country assistance strategy. The strategy is expected to be released in early \n2007. \n \n21.  Annual financing of public investment by development partners in the agriculture sector \nrose from $22.81 million in 2001 to a peak of $32.07 million in 2003, and is expected to decline \nto $24.70 million in 2006.17 The key areas of assistance include agricultural strategy formulation \nand policy development (ADB, the SDC, and the World Bank); budgetary support (the European \nUnion Food Security Program); farm privatization and land reform (the World Bank, the United \nStates Agency for International Development [USAID], the SDC, the DFID, and ADB); financial \ninstitution  development  (the  World  Bank,  ADB,  German  development  cooperation  through \nDeutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  [German  Agency  for  Technical \nCooperation, GTZ] and the Raiffeisen Foundation for Development Cooperatives, the USAID, \n                                                 \n17 World Bank. 2004.

Appendix 3 provides further information on external \ndevelopment assistance.  \n \n22.  According  to  the  2006  Annual  Evaluation  Review,18 project  success  in  category  A \ncountries, including the Kyrgyz Republic, from 1990 to 1997 was 74%, above both category B \ncountries and average performance overall. The countries that performed well included the \ntransition economies. By contrast, agriculture projects had the worst outcomes for projects \nfinanced by the Asian Development Fund (ADF), with only 47% being rated as successful \noverall, but for irrigation and rural development projects the success rate exceeded 50%. The \nmain  problems  identified  were  (i)  inadequate  project  design,  including  an  inadequate \nunderstanding of the problems and opportunities viewed from the perspective of beneficiaries; \n(ii) project complexity; (iii) weak institutions; (iv) limited budgets; (v) adverse impact of external \nfactors;  and  (vi)  weaknesses  in  project  administration.  Furthermore,  the  critical  factors \ncontributing to project success generally across ADB projects were (i) quality of project at entry, \n(ii) strong country ownership, (iii) flexible design and a participatory approach, (iv) ability to learn \nfrom experience and incorporate lessons into project design, (v) good supervision of project \nimplementation,  and  (vi)  strong  project  management  units  (PMUs)  and  related  oversight \ninstitutions to ensure good performance and timely delivery from contractors. \n \n23.  The Project is based on the AADP, which is still ongoing. ADB annual reviews continue \nto rate the AADP as satisfactory. The Government is also satisfied with the concept, approach, \nand results to the extent that it has requested adaptation of the AADP to three oblasts in the \nsouthern part of the Kyrgyz Republic. Appendix 4 summarizes details of progress to date, \nincluding key lessons. These lessons are (i) the oblast administrations do not have the capacity \nto be appointed as implementing agencies, but should be represented on the project steering \ncommittee (PSC); (ii) the early establishment of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system is \nessential, and adequate staff should be deployed for this purpose; (iii) a strong management \nteam, a sound financial management system, transparency and fairness in staff recruitment, \ninvestment in staff training early in the project, and sufficient international consultancy to support \nthe PMU during the first 3 years of the project are essential; (iv) the general approach of \ncontracting local advisory services and encouraging competition between service providers has \nimproved the quality of the services provided, more intensive investment in the quality of training \nmaterials and field advisers\u2019 skills is needed; (v) the procurement procedure for the design of \ndrainage and irrigation rehabilitation did not result in significant competition given the limited \nnumber of design companies, and in-house design capacity is preferable; (vi) the existence of \nwell-managed, financially sustainable WUAs is critical to the rehabilitation process and the \nsustainability  of  rehabilitated  systems;  (vii)  the  scale  of  technical  support  for  agribusiness \ndevelopment was relatively small in relation to the amount of credit finance available and the \nuptake of credit for investment in agribusiness development was relatively small; and (viii) the \nconditions  for  obtaining  credit  from  the  KAFC  were  not  appropriate  for  all  farmers  and \nagribusinesses, and diversifying the range of financial institutions involved in credit provision \nwould provide a more appropriate credit mechanism. Appendix 4 explains how these lessons \nhave been incorporated into the current Project.  \n \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2006. 2006 Annual Evaluation Review. Manila.

The Project has benefited from ongoing ADB regional TA19  supporting the development \nof  the  Central  Asian  Countries  Initiative  for  Land  Management  (CACILM),  a  multicountry \nprogram extending over 10 years and involving all five Central Asian countries to systematically \nidentify and address the most important land degradation problems in the region. The CACILM \nis based on national programming frameworks for sustainable land management developed for \neach  of  the  five  countries,  and  the  Project  is  included  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  national \nprogramming framework as a high priority under the country's strategy for addressing land \ndegradation. The framework identifies the need to strengthen policies and institutions and to \nmake the complementary on-the-ground investments required both within the agriculture sector \nand across other relevant sectors and national development plans. The CACILM is also a \nframework for generating financing to support the identified priorities, and ADB is leading a \nconsortium of bilateral and multilateral partners to mobilize such funding. In particular, the \nGlobal Environment Facility (GEF) has endorsed a first phase of projects amounting to more \nthan $150 million in investments, with the GEF to provide $20 million in grant financing. The \nProject is included in this framework and is expected to receive $2.5 million in GEF grant \ncofinancing as part of the CACILM program. \n \n25.  The area development concept recognizes the need for balanced investment to address \nconstraints relating to agricultural production, inputs and services, infrastructure, and finance \nsimultaneously in a clearly targeted area. The intent is to enhance productivity and profitability in \na  more  sustainable  manner  through  a  holistic,  integrated,  and  coordinated  approach.  The \napproach  is  holistic  in  comprehensively  addressing  key  constraints,  integrated  in  terms  of \nunifying interventions in specific geographic areas, and coordinated in terms of partnership with \nother projects and outsourcing to effective local service providers. \n \n26.  The Project seeks to adapt the overall concept and approach of the AADP, but more \ninvestment in developing agribusinesses, promoting marketing, and diversifying participating \nfinancial institutions (PFIs) and the addition of a component to address pasture and orchard \nmanagement are expected to lead to an even more successful area development project in the \nsouth.  The  Project  addresses  short-term  investment  needs  in  relation  to  credit  and  the \nrehabilitation  of  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure,  but  also  longer-term  needs  through \ninvestment in training, advisory services, and pasture management. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n27.  The Project\u2019s expected impact is region-wide adoption of improved agricultural, orchard, \nand pasture management techniques. The expected outcome of the Project is a sustainable \nincrease in land productivity and profitability.  \n \n  1.  Project Area \n \n28.  The Project is located in the three southern oblasts of Batken, Jalalabad, and Osh. Of \nthe 18 raions in these oblasts, 9 were selected based on the following criteria: (i) a large \nproportion of the oblast\u2019s arable land is located in the raion; (ii) the population is at least 60% \nrural; (iii) the extent of crops grown that are prohibited from direct investment by ADB is not \nsubstantial (e.g., tobacco); and (iv) the raions are, as far as possible, contiguous and are \naccessible year round. The PSC agreed to include the following raions in the project area: \nBatken, Kadamjay, and Leylek in Batken; Bazaar Korgon, Nooken, and Suzak in Jalalabad; \nAravan, Kara Su, and Uzgen in Osh.  \n \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2005.

In addition, some aiyl okmotu and WUAs were selected for inclusion in the Project during \nthe preparation phase and the loan Fact-Finding Mission. This selection was based primarily on \nthe need for rehabilitation of drainage and irrigation systems (Table 1). Further details are \nprovided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  Based  on  the  prioritized  list  of  WUAs  eligible  for \nparticipation in the Project; about 45,000 ha were identified in 27 WUAs in 24 aiyl okmotu \ngrouped into 12 area clusters of one or more WUAs, in the 9 target raions. However, this goes \nbeyond the coverage expected under the Project of about 28,500 ha and 17 WUAs, and the \nfinal selection from the shortlisted WUAs will be carried out when project implementation starts \nand will include a detailed assessment against the foregoing criteria and submission to ADB for \nreview and approval. WUAs will not be included if their irrigation infrastructure is prone to being \naffected by natural disasters and cannot easily be protected through modest expenditures on \nprotective infrastructure or if rehabilitation is likely to have a serious negative environmental \nimpact, including the dispersal of heavy metals and other pollutants into the water supply and \nsoils. \n \nTable 1: Shortlisted Aiyl Okmotu and WUAs \n \nOblasts   Number of Aiyl  Number of Water  Number of  Area  \nand Raions  Okmotu  User Associations  Clusters  (hectares) \nBatken         \n     Batken         3    4    1    7,103 \n     Kadamjay    4    4    2    7,456 \n     Leylek    2    2    1    2,247 \n     Subtotal    9    10    4    16,806 \nJalalabad         \n     Bazar Korgon    1    2    1    2,519 \n     Nooken    2    2    1    3,389 \n     Suzak    2    2    1    5,780 \n     Subtotal    5    6    3    11,688 \nOsh         \n     Aravan    3    4    2    5,388 \n     Kara Su    4    4    1    7,810 \n     Uzgen    3    3    2    3,687 \n     Subtotal    10    11    5    16,885 \nTotal    24    27    12    45,379 \nSource: Meeting with senior engineers and staff of the Department of Water Resources from Bishkek, Batken, \nJalalabad, and Osh.19 September 2006, Osh. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n30.  The Project has five components, four technical and one project management, with \nrelated outputs and activities. Outputs for each component are summarized below and a more \ndetailed description is provided in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n  1.  Farm Development \n \n31.  The Project will support agricultural and legal advisory services by (i) improving the \ncapacity and technical scope of existing advisory service providers (output 1.1), (ii) increasing \nthe quality and outreach of advisory services (output 1.2), (iii) facilitating access to existing legal \nservices (output 1.3), and (iv) increasing the availability of and access to credit by farmers \n(output 1.4).  \n \n32.  The Project will assess the situation and prepare a plan for project interventions in each \nvillage government. This assessment will (i) be undertaken with community participation; (ii) \ndescribe  the  current  status  of  farms,  agricultural  businesses,  and  other  agricultural ", "      9\norganizations; (iii) identify potential development opportunities and partner organizations; and \n(iv) outline a plan of Project interventions for the village government.  \n \n33.  To improve the capacity and technical scope of advisory services (output 1.1), high-\nquality training materials will be developed to improve the technical skills of advisory staff and \ntheir capacity to deliver advice to farmers. The Project will contract national organizations with \nappropriate experience to (i) assess and, where necessary, upgrade existing training materials; \n(ii)  identify  new  technologies  to  address  farmers\u2019  needs  and  improve  the  sustainability  of \nfarming systems; and (iii) train the advisory service providers contracted under the Project in the \ndelivery of new technologies and methodologies for training small farmers. All training materials \nused by the service providers will be approved by the contracted organization and all advisory \nservice staff will be trained in training techniques for small farmers before the delivery of any \ntraining.  \n \n34.  To increase the quality and outreach of advisory services (output 1.2), the Project will \ncontract a suitable national organization to set up farmer field schools (FFSs) to increase the \nfield experience of skilled trainers in crops that are particularly important to the project area, \nsuch as tree crops, vegetables, and cotton. These FFSs will involve three levels of participants: \nmaster trainers, trainers, and farmers. A master trainer from the contracted organization will \ntrain 16 trainers, divided into 8 pairs, 2 days per week for 16 weeks throughout the growing \nseason in year 1. Simultaneously during year 1, each pair of trainers will train up to 18 farmers \nunder the supervision of a master trainer using the same training method. FFS trainees will \nestablish their own demonstration plots and use these to demonstrate up to two technologies. \nFFSs will involve 1 day of training for farmers each week throughout the growing season. In \nyear 2, the training with the same 8 pairs of trainers continues, but is less intensive and involves \nnew technologies. Trainers continue the FFS with the farmers from year 1 and an additional 18 \nnew farmers join each FFS. There will be two cycles of 2 years for FFSs.  \n \n35.  The Project will also finance the expansion of village advisory services to increase their \noutreach to more aiyl okmotu and more farmers within each village government and to improve \nfarmers\u2019 skills in crop production (including tree crops), livestock production, management, \nfinance and income diversification, integrated pest management, onfarm water management, \nand pasture management. The Project aims to create competition among the advisory service \nproviders by procuring services from more than one provider and providing an incentive for \nimproving services. The contracted service providers will provide intensive field training and \ntrain village advisers. The village advisers will be respected successful farmers in the villages \nwho will lead groups of 10\u201315 farmers with common agricultural interests.  \n \n36.  The  Project  will  facilitate  access  to  legal  advisory  services  (output  1.3)  to  improve \nfarmers\u2019 understanding of their legal rights, improve contract enforcement, and create greater \nconfidence in legal contracts to provide a more stable climate for investment. The Project will \nidentify farmers\u2019 legal problems, and in cases where the Project cannot solve them, farmers will \nbe referred to the Legal Assistance to Rural Citizens Association of Lawyers. The Project will \nsign a memorandum  of understanding with the association to provide legal services on a \nretainer basis and will cover the costs of advice to farmers, but not the costs of further resolution \nof activities provided by the association, for which farmers will be required to pay. \n \n37.  The Project will provide funds for a credit line (output 1.4) to help farmers undertake their \ninvestment needs. The credit line will be provided to financial institutions for onlending to target \nfarmers  and  will  include  both  working  capital  and  investment  finance.  Several  financial \ninstitutions are expected to participate in the Project. The participatory financial institutions \n(PFIs) will have to (i) be legally registered with the NBKR, (ii) have their accounts audited by an \ninternational audit company, (iii) adhere to the NBKR\u2019s prudential standards, and (iv) provide a \nbusiness plan that is acceptable to ADB and is updated annually. A competitive process will be \n ", "10  \n \nfollowed to select appropriate PFIs and due diligence will be undertaken on all potentially \nqualified and interested PFIs. PFIs will be required to meet the following criteria: (i) be financially \nsound;  (ii)  have  adequate  credit  and  risk  management  policies,  operating  system,  and \nprocedures; (iii) comply with prudential regulations; (iv) have acceptable corporate and financial \ngovernance and management practices; (v) have sound business objectives and strategies \nand/or plans; (vi) have autonomy in lending and pricing decisions; (vii) have adequate policies, \nsystems, and procedures for assessing and monitoring the impacts of subprojects; and (viii) \nhave  environmental  screening  processes  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  final  list  of  qualified \nmicrofinance institutions will be selected and agreed with ADB.20 \n \n2.  Agribusiness Development and Marketing \n \n38.  The Project will (i) increase and improve contractual arrangements between farmers and \nagribusinesses for input supply, machinery services, and wholesale and processing enterprises \n(output 2.1); (ii) improve agribusiness performance (output 2.2); (iii) increase the availability of \nand access to appropriate finance for agribusinesses (output 2.3); and (iv) increase public \ninvestment in physical market infrastructure (output 2.4). \n \n39.  The Project will facilitate and support contractual arrangements (output 2.1), including \nthose pertaining to domestic and export marketing, by helping farmers identify, negotiate with, \nand  conclude  equitable  contracts  with  buyers  and  enterprises  associated  with  collecting, \npreparing, and transporting produce to buyers. Farmers will also be given the knowledge and \ninformation needed to plan their production for sale to the market. The Project will also help \nfarmers  identify  strategically  important  processors,  agricultural  produce  wholesalers,  input \nsuppliers, and machinery contractors (agribusinesses).  \n \n40.  The Project will contract the services of qualified agencies whose qualifications and \nexperience are acceptable to ADB to support the development of contracts between farmers or \nfarmers\u2019  cooperatives  and  identified  agribusinesses.  Currently,  the  Agribusiness \nCompetitiveness Center and the Marketing Development Service satisfy ADB\u2019s criteria. The \nfocus will be on supporting existing informal marketing groups and marketing cooperatives, but \nwhere required, the Project will provide support for the organizational development of emergent \ninformal marketing groups. Where more intensive support for the development of marketing \ncooperatives is required, the Project will provide organizational development support directly \nwith the assistance of cooperative development projects such as the GTZ-funded Development \nof Trade and Service  Cooperative Project and the Raiffeisen Foundation for Development \nCooperatives.  \n \n41.  The Project will improve agribusiness performance (output 2.2) by providing advisory \nservices to agribusinesses serving the target farm areas. These services will involve two types \nof contracts: one for input suppliers and machinery-related services and one for processors and \nagricultural produce wholesalers. The Project proposes to contract the services of agencies with \nappropriate  qualifications  and  experience,  such  as  the  Association  of  Agribusinessmen  of  \nKyrgyzstan and the Agribusiness Competitiveness Center. The advisory services will make a \nlong-term  consultancy  facility  available  to  agribusinesses  using  national,  regional,  or \ninternational consultants as necessary to provide general management support, and specifically \nto support agribusinesses in planning and managing agribusiness investments financed by the \nProject. Consultancy may be provided to more than one business depending on the size and \nneeds of the agribusiness, but in all cases each consultant will work with no more than three \nagribusinesses simultaneously.21 Specialist short-term consultants (e.g., processing engineers) \nmay  also  be  provided  to  supplement  the  long-term  consultants  where  specific  support  is \n                                                 \n20  The credit line for agribusinesses (output 2.3) will also be channeled through PFIs meeting the same criteria. \n21 The Project recognizes that the allocation of businesses to each consultant should be organized in such a way that \neach consultant does not support businesses competing in the same technical or geographic area. ", "     11\nrequired or to support other agribusinesses that require shorter-term TA. Agribusinesses will be \nrequired to contribute at least 5% of the cost of consultancy fees.  \n \n42.  The  Project  will  increase  the  availability  of  and  access  to  appropriate  finance  for \nagribusinesses (output 2.3) by providing funds for a credit line to help agribusinesses implement \ntheir investment plans. The credit line will be provided to PFIs for onlending to agribusinesses \nand will be available primarily for investment finance, but where necessary, some funds will be \nprovided for working capital. Part of the credit line may also be used to provide alternative forms \nof finance, such as equity investment in agribusinesses, subject to ADB\u2019s agreement to the \nterms and conditions. \n \n43.  To further support marketing activities under this component and to ensure that farmers \nhave access to functioning storage and cooling facilities, the Project will rehabilitate existing \nstorage and cooling facilities or construct new facilities on existing facility locations (output 2.4). \nWhere facilities remain under state ownership, the Project aims to transfer the management of \nsuch facilities to the private sector. In cases where the aiyl okmotu own the facilities, prior to \ntheir rehabilitation, the relevant village government will obtain a legally binding commitment from \nthe proposed private sector operator to (i) operate and manage the cooling and storage facility \nfollowing its rehabilitation; and (ii) lease the facility from the village government for a period of at \nleast 5 years, with the option to purchase the facility on completion of the lease term. The \nprivate sector operator will make lease payments to the MOEF\u2019s State Development Fund under \nan  agreement  on  commercial  terms  that  shall  provide  for  lease  payments  in  an  amount \nsufficient to cover the commercial value of the rehabilitated facility. In cases where the facilities \nare currently owned by a functional cooperative organization, the organization will enter into a \nrepayment  agreement  with  the  MOEF\u2019s  State  Development  Fund  to  repay  the  costs  of \nrehabilitation of the facility over a period of 7 years, with a grace period of 2 years, and to pay \ninterest at the inflation rate for the previous calendar year as determined by the National \nStatistics  Committee.  In  cases  where  the  facilities  are  currently  owned  by  a  cooperative \norganization that is inoperative, the organization will be required either to transfer ownership \nback  to  the  relevant  village  government  or  to  transfer  or  sell  the  facilities  to  a  functional \nmarketing cooperative. Rehabilitation will then be financed in the same manner as for facilities \nowned  by  a  village  government  (where  such  facilities  are  transferred  back  to  a  village \ngovernment) or as for facilities owned by a functional cooperative (where such facilities are sold \nor otherwise transferred to a functional cooperative). \n \n3.  Irrigation and Drainage  \n \n44.  The Project will cooperate with the World Bank on development of the WUAs (output \n3.1) and will directly support rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure (output 3.2). \n \n45.  Under  a  memorandum  of  understanding  between  the  ADB-financed  AADP  and  the \nWorld Bank-financed OIP, the latter project has established WUAs and trained members in Chui \nOblast, including for systems selected for rehabilitation by the AADP. This highly successful \ncooperation between ADB and the World Bank will continue under this Project. Based on \nagreements  reached  between  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the  World  Bank,  a  tripartite \nagreement will be prepared defining how WUAs and oblast and raion WUA support units will be \nfurther developed and supported by all three parties. Each WUA support unit comprises a water \nmanagement specialist, a WUA development specialist, and an engineer. The WUA support \nunits provide consultancy and formal training for all aspects of WUA formation, organizational \ndevelopment, financial planning, and water management.  \n \n46.  The Government currently finances 70% of the operating costs of the oblast and raion \nWUA support units through the DWR budget and the OIP finances 30%. However, as of \nJanuary 2007, the Government will finance 100% of the operating costs of the WUA support \n ", "12  \n \nunits and the units will be completely absorbed into the DWR. Under the World Bank-financed \nWater Management Improvement Project, support for training for WUA support units and WUAs \nwill continue. ADB has agreed with the World Bank that the proposed Project will not provide \nany financing for the WUA support units in the Project area. Consideration may, however, be \ngiven  to  providing  financial  support  to  replace  furniture,  equipment,  and  some  vehicles,  if \nnecessary, during the course of implementation. \n  \n47.  The Project will support the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure (output \n3.2) for selected WUAs from the 27 WUAs identified in the shortlist and expects to rehabilitate \nabout 17 WUAs serving about 28,500 ha of irrigated land. The Project will rehabilitate onfarm \nsystems and, to a lesser extent, off-farm systems serving those WUAs. No more than 30% of \nfunds for irrigation and drainage rehabilitation will be used for off-farm rehabilitation. \n \n48.  The implementation arrangements for irrigation and drainage rehabilitation will be the \nsame as those for the AADP and the OIP, with minor adjustments to reflect lessons learned. \nThese arrangements include assessing WUA milestones, preliminary rehabilitation designs, and \nestimates  of  financial  and  economic  feasibility;  having  oblast  rehabilitation  teams  (ORTs) \nprepare designs with support from a contracted design company for more difficult and complex \ninfrastructure;  and  contracting  construction  civil  works  companies  supervised  by  ORT \nengineers.  \n \n49.  A joint assessment by the PMU will be conducted for each of the shortlisted WUAs in \ncooperation with the WUA support units to assess their suitability for inclusion in the Project and \nto identify any steps that the WUAs need to take. In addition to their adherence to qualification \ncriteria, the assessment will involve a range of factors that may affect WUAs\u2019 capacity to \nmanage a rehabilitated system. A plan will be agreed on with WUAs to resolve any outstanding \nissues that need to be addressed before their inclusion in the Project. \n \n50.  Decisions concerning priorities, works required, and scale of investments will lie largely \nwith farmers, and the Project will be responsive to their needs. A series of meetings will be held \nfor WUA members to ensure that they understand the proposals and timetable for rehabilitation \nand the financial implications of repayment obligations for individual members. Consultation with \nWUA members and management will continue throughout rehabilitation. The final design will \nfocus on priority interventions to bring the system back to operational condition, but will not \nnecessarily involve complete rehabilitation. However, the scale of rehabilitation will not be less \nthan what is required to ensure that the proposed design is technically, financially, economically, \nand environmentally feasible. The final design will reflect more accurate estimates of works and \ncosts and will be subject to stringent financial and economic analyses. The final design, costs, \nand expected timetable for construction will be discussed and agreed with WUA members, and \na formal decision will be taken to proceed with the procurement of a civil works contractor to \nexecute the agreed rehabilitation works.  \n \n51.  The  Project  will  use  the  staff  of  the  ORTs,  which  consist  of  a  design  engineer,  a \nconstruction engineer, and a draftsperson, which are currently financed by the OIP, for regular \ndesign work and construction supervision. The OIP will finance these teams until the Project \nbecomes effective, estimated to be March 2007, at which time the Project will take over the \nfinancing. The Project will finance one additional design engineer for a minimum of 2 years to \naccommodate the extra design work activities and up to six university graduates to provide them \nwith  work  experience.  ADB  has  agreed  with  the  World  Bank  that  the  position  of  regional \nengineer, currently financed by the OIP will be jointly financed by the World Bank and ADB until \nMay 2008, when the OIP is expected to be completed. After this date, the Project will fully \nfinance this engineer, who will manage the Project\u2019s irrigation and drainage component. In \naddition, a design company or companies will be contracted to provide design support to the \nORTs for the more difficult and complex aspects of design and consideration will be given to \nusing a framework agreement similar to that currently practiced under the OIP. Designs will be ", "     13\nsupervised by the Project. Final designs will be approved by WUA management following \nconsultation  with  WUA  members;  the  State  Committee  on  Environmental  Protection  and \nForestry to provide environmental clearance; and oblast technical committees, which will consist \nof  Project  staff,  oblast  DWR  staff,  WUA  representatives,  farmer  representatives,  and  the \ncompany  responsible  for  the  design.  In  addition,  an  international  irrigation  and  drainage \nengineer will undertake an external technical review of engineering designs prior to civil works \ntenders. This engineer will be part of the international consulting team and will conduct reviews \nof each design and submit comments for ADB consideration. \n  \n52.  Construction will be contracted out to qualified companies. Construction supervision will \nbe undertaken by the construction engineers in each ORT and supported by site supervisors, \nwho will be permanently engaged for each construction site (one per site). \n \n53.  As under the AADP and the OIP, WUAs will be required to repay 25% of construction \ncosts under a repayment agreement to be signed before construction contracts are signed and \nwill generally finance this repayment through increased ISFs. Each WUA, with assistance from \nraion  WUA  support  unit,  will  be  required  to  prepare  a  7-year  financial  plan  that  includes \nprojections for increased ISFs sufficient to cover the 25% repayment and improved O&M. The \nterms and conditions of agreements between WUAs and the MOEF include repayment of 25% \nof the costs of onfarm irrigation and drainage rehabilitation (construction costs only, not design \ncosts) over a 7-year period from the date of completion of rehabilitation, with a 4-year grace \nperiod; interest charged on the amount to be repaid based on inflation; and the amount to be \nrepaid defined in som. The WUAs will not bear any foreign exchange risk. \n \n54.  As under the AADP and the OIP, a technical credit will be made available to WUAs to \npurchase office furniture and equipment, vehicles, meters, concrete mixers, and machinery for \nO&M of the rehabilitated irrigation systems. The technical credit will be limited to $40,000 per \nWUA, and 100% of the amount will be recovered through a repayment agreement between \nWUAs and the MOEF, similar to the repayment agreement for the rehabilitation of irrigation and \ndrainage infrastructure. \n \n4.   Land Improvement \n \n55.  The Project will support a holistic and participatory approach to the sustainable use of \npasture lands (output 4.1) and the improvement of orchard management (output 4.2). \n \n56.  The enabling environment for pasture management at the national level is in need of \nreform, and the World Bank is currently undertaking a pilot project to develop legislation and \nadministrative arrangements for pasture management and investment as a foundation for future \ninvestments in pasture development. The Project will collaborate with this and any future World \nBank projects, but will not conduct specific activities aimed at reform at the national level. The \nProject will design and implement pasture land interventions within the existing policy and legal \nframework, concentrating its efforts at building local capacity for planning and management.  \n \n57.  Regulation  360  dated  4  June  200222 establishes  a  set  of  procedures  for  pasture \nallocation based on written plans for the reallocation, use, and protection of pastures to be \nelaborated jointly by raion and village government officials (article 9). The aim is to specify \noverall use and management plans within oblasts, raions, or aiyl okmotu based on a quantitative \nassessment of available pasture areas and their forage productivity. In addition, plans are to be \ndeveloped for pasture rotation, water, road access, and infrastructure needs. On the basis of \n                                                 \n22 This description of the main elements of the regulation is taken from Undeland, Asyl. 2005. Kyrgyz Livestock \nStudy; Pasture Management and Use. World Bank. Bishkek. Unpublished report (November, p. 54).  \n ", "14  \n \nthese plans, competitive tenders are to be organized for livestock holders who wish to rent \npasture land (article 10).  \n \n58.  To support sustainable pasture land management (output 4.1), the Project will initially \nhelp prepare and implement pasture land management plans incorporating all three levels of \npastures used by farmers from each village government. Communities will be mobilized to \nensure  effective  participation  (by  both  women  and  men)  in  pasture  land  planning  and \nmanagement.  The  Project  will  explore  options  for  establishing  appropriate  community \norganizational or representation mechanisms for ensuring that the interests of pasture land \nusers are adequately represented in the planning process and subsequent plan implementation. \nFor example, the Project may help livestock farmers manage their own pasture resources \nthrough the formation of pasture user associations or similar groups. Capacity development will \nbe provided to aiyl okmotu and community-based user groups to support the planning and \nmanagement of pasture lands.  \n \n59.  Community-based pasture land management plans will be prepared for pastures serving \nfarmers  in  selected  aiyl  okmotu  during  the  first  3  years  of  the  Project.  Planning  will  be \nundertaken with the full participation of communities in (i) surveying the condition of pastures; \n(ii) undertaking socioeconomic surveys; (iii) preparing pasture boundary maps; (iv) preparing \npasture  improvement  plans,  including  pasture  infrastructure  rehabilitation  plans;  and  (v) \ndeveloping  pasture  monitoring  systems.  The  pasture  land  management  plans  will  include \nexpected impacts and outcomes, leasing and allocation schemes, pasture improvement plans, \ninstitutional arrangements (including M&E systems), capacity development plans, budgets, and \nfinancial commitments.  \n \n60.  Pasture land improvement plans will be implemented and monitored with community \nparticipation. Pasture improvements will include (i) pasture rotation schemes, (ii) investments to \nincrease forage productivity through reseeding and weed control, and (iii) pasture infrastructure \ninvestments. Forage productivity improvements will be made through a combination of pasture \nrotation plans, revegetation of degraded pasture land, and enforcement of sustainable stocking \nrates for livestock. Village advisory services will provide improved skills training in livestock \nproduction and pasture management. \n  \n61.  In consultation with the community-based pasture user groups, the Project will help aiyl \nokmotu develop investment plans and will support such plans for the first 4 years. After that \ntime,  the  income  generated  from  leasing  access  to  pastures  is  expected  to  support  plan \nimplementation. The plans will cover phased repair and construction or reconstruction of crucial \npasture infrastructure such as roads and tracks, bridges, handling facilities, and housing. \n \n62.  Both aiyl okmotu and pasture-user groups will be trained to improve their management \nand administration of pastures. Aiyl okmotu will receive revenues from the leasing of pastures \nand will be helped to set up proper administrative systems for managing these revenues and \nachieving  transparency  and  accountability  in  handling  them.  The  Project  will  also  provide \ncapacity development for managing grant funds for improving pasture land infrastructure. Such \ntraining will include financial management and M&E.  \n \n63.  The  Project  will  develop  an  effective  monitoring  system  for  pasture  land  use.  The \nmonitoring system will be based on animal production characteristics and vegetation and soil \nerosion criteria. It is anticipated that monitoring data will have to be collated and analyzed by \none system under the Project. The pasture user groups operating in the village government \npasture areas will be responsible for routine monitoring to collect data on the state of vegetation, \npastures, livestock, and infrastructure. To this end, local service providers will assist and train \nthe  pasture  user  groups  under  contract  to  the  aiyl  okmotu  during  their  first  4  years  after \nestablishment. Monitoring activities will be coordinated with the CACILM, which will be operating \na  sustainable  land  management  information  system  to  monitor  changes  in  pasture  land ", "     15\nindicators  as  part  of  the  monitoring  of  overall  changes  in  land  degradation  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic.  \n \n64.  The  pasture  land  management  activities  will  generate  a  number  of  lessons,  and \ninformation  will  be  gathered  using  the  monitoring  system.  To  ensure  effective  sharing  of \nknowledge,  the  Project  will  develop  a  manual  on  sustainable  pasture  land  management \npractices. The first version of the manual is expected to be produced within 2 years of project \ninitiation, and it will be updated at least once as project activities generate new information. The \nadvisory services will use this manual to train pasture users. \n \n65.  The  Project  will  support  improvements  to  orchard  management  (output  4.2)  by  (i) \ndeveloping  improvement  plans,  (ii)  addressing  legal  restrictions,  (iii)  improving  leasing \narrangements, (iv) restocking orchards, and (v) training farmers. \n \n66.  The Project will help aiyl okmotu prepare orchard management plans to be completed \nwithin 3 years of Project effectiveness. Each plan will (i) identify all government agencies and \ntheir respective responsibilities with respect to the plan, (ii) include procedures for ensuring \ncommunity participation in the planning process, (iii) establish systems and procedures for \nallocating orchards to farmers through lease arrangements in an equitable and transparent \nmanner, (iv) include strategies for improving orchards, and (v) incorporate investment plans. \n \n67.  There is currently a moratorium on the felling of trees, which prevents the responsible \nfelling of unproductive trees and restocking. The Project will work with aiyl okmotu and relevant \ngovernment agencies to identify areas where responsible felling and restocking would increase \norchard  productivity  and  to  examine  possible  systems  and  procedures  for  assessment, \napproval, and monitoring of applications for felling and restocking on a pilot basis. \n \n68.  The Project will assist aiyl okmotu to establish improved long-term agreements with \nfarmers for leasing orchards and to encourage proper tree management. The aiyl okmotu will \nalso contract private or forest farm nurseries to supply tree and shrub planting materials. Aiyl \nokmotu will also contract forest farms or individuals to plant new stock in orchards or other \nareas that need to be planted. Aiyl okmotu will contract individuals or advisory services to train \nfarmers leasing those areas in tree crop management.  \n \n5.   Project Management \n \n69.  Project  management  will  be  undertaken  by  a  PMU.  Most  project  activities  will  be \nconducted by contracting existing institutions to build up sustainable implementation capacity. \nThe Project will also work collaboratively with other development partners to avoid duplication \nand minimize project management costs. Where national institutional capacity is limited or \nunavailable,  international  and  national  consulting  services  will  be  employed  to  strengthen \ntechnical capacity for selected activities and project management.  \n \nC.  ADF IX Grant Component \n \n70.  The  Project\u2019s  grant  component  includes  financing  for  (i)  international  and  national \nconsultants; (ii) FFSs; (iii) farmer training and advisory services; (iv) pasture planning, training, \nand management; (v) orchard planning, training, and management; and (vi) vehicles, office \nfurniture and equipment, communications, office support staff, and O&M costs for vehicles and \nequipment. The purposes of the grant component are to (i) train trainers and farmers; (ii) plan, \nmap, and invest in pastures; (iii) plan and invest in orchards; (iv) provide international and \nnational  consultants  for  farm  development,  agribusiness  advisory  services,  irrigation  and \ndrainage rehabilitation, orchard management, and project management; and (v) provide support \n ", "16  \n \nstaff  and  related  office  expenses  for  project  management.  Appendix  5  provides  further \ninformation. \n \nD.  Special Features \n \n71.  The Project is adapting the concept and approach of the AADP to three oblasts in the \nsouth of the Kyrgyz Republic. It is taking a holistic, integrated and coordinated approach to \naddress  fundamental  constraints  in  moving  agriculture  forward  and  builds  extensively  on \nlessons learned from the AADP (Appendix 4). \n \n72.  Cofinancing is anticipated from the GEF. A grant from GEF Operational Program 15 on \nsustainable land management is proposed to enhance measures to address land improvement \nthrough  a  holistic  and  integrated  approach  to  pasture  land  management  and  orchard \nimprovement. ADB will submit a request for grant financing ($2.5 million) to the GEF Council to \nfinance additional activities. If approved, ADB will administer the GEF grant, in line with an \nagreement between the GEF and ADB, to improve land management and generate additional \nglobal environmental benefits. GEF financing is expected to begin in 2007. \n \nE.  Project Investment Plan \n \n73.  The project investment cost is estimated at $31.23 million, including taxes and duties of \n$2.80 million, $3.75 million for physical and price contingencies, and $0.52 million in interest \ncharges during implementation. Table 2 summarizes cost estimates by project component and \ndetailed  cost  estimates  are  provided  in  Appendix  6.

The proposed ADB loan will finance 48% of the project cost and will meet the costs of \nthe  credit  line  for  farms  and  agribusiness,  advisory  services  for  agribusinesses,  public \ninvestments  in  marketing  infrastructure,  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  rehabilitation, \nWUA technical credits, WUA support unit equipment, office equipment and vehicles, training, \nworkshops and seminars, M&E surveys, O&M for vehicles and equipment, support staff, and \nutilities for project management. The proposed ADF IX grant will finance 16% of the project cost \nand will finance training of trainers and farmers; planning and mapping of and investment in \npastures; planning of and investment in orchards; and international and national consultants for \nfarm development, agribusiness advisory services, irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, orchard \nmanagement, project management, and support staff and related office expenses for project \nmanagement.  The proposed GEF funds will finance 8% of the project cost to meet the costs of \ntraining of trainers, FFSs, and village advisory services; pasture planning, infrastructure and \nimprovement, monitoring, and capacity development for aiyl okmotu and pasture-user groups; \ninternational  and  national  consultants  for  land  improvement;  and  equipment,  vehicles, \ncommunications,  support  staff,  workshops  and  seminars,  M&E,  staff  training,  and \ncommunications and report production for project management. The detailed proposal for the \nGEF grant is in Supplementary Appendix C. The Government will finance 22% of total project \ncost through taxes and duties, support for WUA support unit costs, and off-farm irrigation and \ndrainage system O&M costs. The WUAs will finance 1.9% of project cost for the O&M of the \nrehabilitated  infrastructure  on  completion.  The  WUAs  will  also  repay  25%  of  the  cost  of \nrehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage infrastructure. \n \n76.  ADB has typically sought Board approval for the administration of loan or grant funds \nfrom cofinanciers only when cofinancing agreements are in place. In the case of the proposed \ngrant funding from GEF, the full GEF proposal is being finalized and submitted to GEF together \nwith  this  Report.  To  avoid  any  project  delay,  the  Board  is  requested  to  approve  the \nadministration of the proposed GEF grant, in the amount of $2,500,000, which is expected to be \nobtained subsequent to the date of Board approval. Approval of the GEF grant will be reported \nto the Board in accordance with standard operating procedures. If GEF does not approve \nfinancing, the farm development component will be marginally affected, with less training and \nfewer demonstrations; the land improvement component will be significantly reduced in scope, \nwith no remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) for pasture mapping, reduced \ninfrastructure investment in pastures, reduced training for pasture users and aiyl okmotu, and no \ninternational pasture land management or GIS specialists; and project management inputs will \nbe proportionally reduced.  \n \n77.  Disbursements will be based on the percentages in the Financing Agreement.  \n \n ", "18  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n78.  The project management arrangements include a PSC, MAWRPI as Executing Agency, \nand the PMU and two regional offices. Appendix 7 presents the organization chart. \n \n79.  Project implementation will be guided by the PSC, which will consist of the MAWRPI \n(chair); representatives of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the MOEF, oblast administrations, the \nState Committee for Environmental Protection and Forestry, the CACILM National Council, the \nprivate sector, the nongovernment sector, and ADB; the project manager; and the project \ncoordinator. The PSC will (i) guide the overall policy and strategic direction of the Project, (ii) \nguide overall project priorities, (iii) review and evaluate project performance, (iv) review audited \nproject accounts, (v) select consultants through the tender committee, and (vi) facilitate the \ncoordination of activities between the Project and other projects. The PSC will meet at least \ntwice during the inception period (4 months after project effectiveness) and at least every six \nmonths after that, when the Project is well established, to review progress.  \n \n80.  MAWRPI as the Executing Agency, will (i) disburse ADB loan and grant proceeds; (ii) \nkeep  accurate  and  duplicate  records  and  accounts  on  withdrawal  applications  and \ndisbursements under the project accounts; (iii) submit progress and other reports prepared by \nthe PMU to ADB; (iv) ensure timely submission of the Project\u2019s audited accounts to ADB; (v) \nserve as the focal point for ADB project review administration activities; and (vi) coordinate \ncommunication and interaction between ADB and MAWRPI, oblast administrations, and other \ncontracted and implementation partners. A project coordinator from MAWRPI will be appointed, \nbut will not be funded from the Project. The coordinator will oversee the Project and will report to \nthe MAWRPI and the PSC on major issues. \n \n81.  The report on the financial management assessment of the MAWRPI (Supplementary \nAppendix E) concluded that while MAWRPI\u2019s budgeting and financial management is improving, \nit  does  not  provide  a  basis  for  the  financial  management  of  loan  projects.  The  financial \nmanagement  assessment  recommends  the  adoption  of  the  same  financial  management \narrangements as under the AADP with some improvements based on lessons learned. The plan \nis for the Project\u2019s financial management team to be trained by the current AADP team during \nthe initial 2 weeks of implementation. The proposed arrangements and training for financial \nmanagement  will  provide  a  sound  basis  for  accurate  recording  and  reporting  of  financial \ninformation. \n \n82.  The PMU will be established in the MAWRPI and located in Osh Oblast to ensure \neffective implementation and management of the Project and the appropriate use of funds to \nproduce the results anticipated under the Project. The PMU will be headed by a full time project \nmanager  who  will  report  to  the  project  coordinator,  and  will  be  staffed  with  national  and \ninternational consultants. The project manager will be informed and guided by the management \nteam, which will consist of three deputy project managers (one for each oblast), a financial \nmanager, a regional engineer, a procurement specialist, and an M&E manager. During project \nstart-up, PMU staff will work with relevant ADB staff to ensure effective compliance with ADB \nand government project rules and procedures. The PMU will establish regional offices in both \nBatken and Jalalabad.  \n \n83.  The  PMU  will  essentially  be  a  contract  management  unit,  selecting,  contracting, \nmonitoring, and remunerating local service providers. The PMU will (i) ensure that the Project is \nimplemented in accordance with its design; (ii) ensure effective coordination of all activities and \nagencies involved; (iii) ensure compliance with environmental requirements and other safeguard \nmeasures; (iv) maintain appropriate accounts, including reports on withdrawal applications and \ndisbursements;  (v)  manage  procurement  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines;  (vi)  prepare ", "     19\nquarterly progress and other reports in formats agreed on with ADB; (vii) monitor all contracts; \n(viii) work closely with selected service providers to ensure that methodologies, approaches, \nand management systems are appropriate and deliver the expected results; (ix) develop an \neffective  M&E  system;  and  (x)  develop  appropriate  public  relations  procedures,  including \nbrochures and press releases.  \n \n84.  The tender committee will review and evaluate all procurement proposals for consulting \nservices,  civil  works,  and  goods.  The  committee  will  consist  of  the  MAWRPI  (chair); \nrepresentatives of the MOEF, the State Committee for Environmental Protection and Forestry, \nand the national procurement agency; the PMU manager; the PMU procurement specialist; \nrepresentatives of each project oblast; and others as deemed necessary by the chair.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n85.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years from July 2007. By 30 June 2013, all \nwithdrawal applications must have been submitted, approved, and authorized. The closing date \nfor disbursements will be 31 December 2013. The implementation schedule for the Project is \nshown in Appendix 8. \n \n86.  The central PMU will be established prior to Project effectiveness. The regional offices in \nBatken and Jalalabad will be established during the first year following project effectiveness. \nWhile implementation will initially commence in Batken, activities are expected to commence in \nJalalabad and Osh within the first 12 months of project implementation. \n \n  3.  Flow of Funds \n \n87.  Apart from the credit line to be provided through PFIs, all loan funds will be provided to \nthe MAWRPI in the form of a grant. The credit line will be administered under subsidiary loan \nagreements entered into between the Government, through the MOEF, PFIs, and by project \nagreements  between  ADB  and  each  PFI.  The  MOEF  has  agreed  to  use  its  Credit  Line \nManagement Unit to manage the credit line. The MOEF will lend the credit line funds directly to \nPFIs that have been licensed by the NBKR. The MOEF will relend these funds in som or US \ndollars for periods of up to 15 years, with a 3-year grace period. The relending interest rate for \nsom loans will be a variable rate based on the average inflation rate for the past year as \nannounced by the National Statistics Office and projected inflation for the current year as \nannounced by the NBKR. The reference rate will be reviewed semiannually. In addition, a fixed \nmargin of 1% shall be added for administrative costs and a variable margin of no less than 1% \nto cover the Government\u2019s foreign exchange risks. The relending interest rate for loans in \ndollars will be a variable rate based on the 6-month London interbank offered rate for dollars. \nThe rate, formula, and actual margins charged by the PFIs shall be reviewed semiannually as \nnecessary. A minimum margin of 1% will be added to cover the Government\u2019s administrative \nand related costs. Following repayment by the PFIs, the funds will be relent to eligible financial \ninstitutions for a similar term.  \n \n88.  Funds  under  the  credit  line  will  be  onlent  to  farmers  and  agribusinesses  as \nsubborrowers. The subloans are anticipated to provide working capital and onfarm and business \ninvestments  for  the  development  of  agricultural  production  and  of  input  supply,  machinery \nservices, storage, packing, marketing, and related agribusiness and service enterprises. The \nsubborrowers  will  prepare  business  plans  and  have  commercially  viable  subprojects  with \nadequate  collateral,  financial  rates  of  return,  and  demonstrated  repayment  capacity.  The \nfinancial institutions will onlend the credit line to eligible subborrowers under separate loan \nagreements acceptable to ADB. Subject to the procedures agreed with ADB, the financial \ninstitutions will have full authority to select subborrowers, approve subloans, and determine \nlending terms in accordance with their own credit policies. Subloans to subborrowers may be \n ", "20  \n \nmade in som or dollars. The lending arrangements from financial institutions to subborrowers \nwill be reviewed on a regular basis, as required, and the arrangements will be adjusted if \nnecessary. ADB will approve all subloans exceeding $20,000 and the first five subloans for each \nfinancial institution before disbursement by any such financial institution. All PFIs will submit a \nquarterly loan portfolio report and an annual external audit report to ADB by 30 June each year. \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n89.  All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as \namended from time to time). ADB will finance the procurement of vehicles, materials, and \nequipment as described in the procurement plan (Appendix 9). Contracts for civil works valued \nat $1 million equivalent or more and contracts for goods and services valued at $0.5 million \nequivalent or more, will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts \nfor civil works valued at less than $1 million equivalent may follow ICB, national competitive \nbidding (NCB), or limited international bidding as determined by the particular circumstances of \nthe  contract  package.  Contracts  for  goods  and  services,  valued  at  less  than  $0.5  million \nequivalent may follow NCB or limited international bidding as determined by the particular \ncircumstances of the actual package. Contracts valued at less than $100,000 equivalent may \nfollow the shopping procedure. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Policy on Anticorruption (1998, \nas amended to date) will be included in all documents during the bidding for and implementation \nof the Project. \n \n90.  Before  the  start  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the \nGovernment\u2019s procurement procedures to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s requirements. Any \nnecessary modifications to or clarifications of the Government\u2019s procedures will be documented \nin the procurement plan. \n \n91.  For the procurement of goods and services to be financed with the subloans to farmers \nand agribusinesses, each PFI will ensure that procurement procedures are appropriate under \nthe  circumstances,  are  in  accordance  with  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB,  and \nconform to ADB\u2019s Policy on Anticorruption.  \n \n92.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  will  be  agreed  on  between  the  Project  and  the \nmanagement of the OIP and the Water Management Improvement Project for the development \nof WUAs and the initial services of the ORTs. \n \n93.  The rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure will employ separate contracts \nfor design and for civil works construction under NCB. Under the AADP and the OIP, more than \n10 companies have already been prequalified. The prequalified civil works contractors may \nparticipate  in  new  bidding  provided  their  qualifications  are  evaluated  again  as  part  of  bid \nevaluations. If new firms wish to qualify to tender, then a postqualification procedure can be \nadopted, whereby the criteria for qualifying will be included in the bidding documents, the lowest \nbid will be evaluated, and if it does not meet the criteria the qualifications of the next lowest \nbidder will be assessed. In addition, the bidding document and the draft contract for the first \ndesign  contract  and  the  first  civil  works  contract  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval. \nThereafter, it is proposed to give approval following the awarding of contracts.  \n \n94.  Advance action is required for consulting services for project implementation to establish \nthe  PMU,  including  engaging  the  project  manager,  financial  management  specialist,  and \nprocurement specialist. Retroactive financing of $50,000 equivalent from the grant is necessary \nto cover expenditures for activities incurred prior to loan and grant effectiveness, but not earlier \nthan a maximum period of 12 months prior to the date of signing the Financing Agreement. The \nadvance recruitment of consultants would be carried out in conformity with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). The Government has been \nadvised that approval of early recruitment of consultants does not commit ADB to approving or ", "     21\notherwise  financing  the  Project.  Advance  action  would  enable  early  preparation  of  draft \ndocuments for contracting various services required under the Project, and would require that \nthe Government agree to finance the PMU and its staff before loan and grant effectiveness.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n95.  The Project will provide 2,655 person-months of consulting services,23 consisting of 96 \nperson-months of international consultants (Appendix 10) and 2,559 person-months of national \nconsultants. The international consultants and their length of service (in person-months, shown \nin parentheses) are as follows: team leader (27), M&E specialist (10), gender and community \ndevelopment specialist (4), farm and agribusiness development specialist (19), irrigation and \ndrainage  engineer  (9),  pasture  management  specialist  (14),  GIS  specialist  (3),  orchard \nmanagement specialist (5), and unallocated short-term consultants (5). National consultants and \nthe length of their service (in person-months, shown in parentheses) are as follows: project \nmanager  (72),  deputy  project  managers  (216),  financial  manager  (72),  accountants  (210), \nprocurement  specialist  (69),  lawyer  (69),  M&E  manager  (69),  senior  sociologist  (69), \nenvironmental  monitoring  specialist  (69),  M&E  specialist  (69),  regional  engineer  (48), \ndraftspeople (90), design supervisors (180), construction supervisors (144), site supervisors \n(348),  trainee  engineers  (144),  senior  farm  development  specialist  (69),  farm  development \nspecialists (138), senior agribusiness development specialist (69), civil engineer (69), senior \npasture  management  specialist  (69),  pasture  management  specialists  (138),  and  orchard \nmanagement specialist (69). In addition, the Project will employ community coordinators (1,224 \nperson-months). The international and national consultants will provide project support and \ncapacity  development  for  advisory  services  in  agriculture  and  agribusiness,  irrigation  and \ndrainage, land improvement practices, and project management (including M&E).  \n \n96.  Suitably qualified local service providers will be contracted for the provision of improved \ntraining materials and training of advisory service providers; the establishment of FFSs,  and \nvillage advisory services to farmers; legal advice for farmers; marketing support and contractual \narrangements between farmers and agribusinesses, and agribusiness advisory services; village \ngovernment pasture plans, GIS work, and pasture mapping. These contracts will be under NCB. \nHowever, where it is established that only one potential contractor has the requisite experience, \nthe services will be procured under direct selection. \n \n97.  The international and national consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on  the  Use  of  Consultants  using consulting  firms,  full  technical  proposals,  and \nquality- and cost-based selection. Detailed terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n98.  ADB\u2019s Policy on Anticorruption was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand the MAWRPI. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption are included in the loan and grant \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Project will specify the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the Executing Agency and of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n                                                 \n23 This does not include 1,224 person-months of community coordinators who will be nominated by communities and \nwork on a part-time basis. \n ", "22  \n \n99.  In relation to the Project, the Government will ensure the disclosure of Project-related \nprocurement actions, including consulting services contracts and the procurement of major \nequipment and civil works, in local newspapers and on the internet. Such disclosed information \nwill  include,  among  other  matters,  the  list  of  participating  bidders;  the  winning  bidder;  a \nreference to the tender procedures adopted; the amount of the contract awarded; and the \ngeneral terms and specifications of the goods, works, or services procured. In addition, the \neffective financial management arrangements under the AADP will also be introduced into the \nProject, including direct payments by ADB for ICB contracts, and inclusion of the international \nconsultant team leader as an observer on the tender committee, and national staff selection \nprocedures. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n100.  The proceeds of the ADB loan and grant will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2001, as amended from time to time). For consulting services and \nequipment following ICB procedures, loan and grant funds will be disbursed through direct \npayment. For civil works following NCB procedures and small expenditures related to the PMU, \nreimbursement and imprest fund procedures will be applied. The MAWRPI will open two imprest \naccounts, one for the loan funds and one for the grant funds. These imprest accounts will be \nestablished and managed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial deposit \nin the loan imprest account will not exceed estimated expenditures for 6 months of project \nimplementation or 10% of the loan, whichever is less. The initial deposit in the grant imprest \naccount will not exceed estimated expenditures for 6 months of project implementation or 10% \nof the grant, whichever is less. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be applied when \nreimbursing eligible project outlays and liquidating and replenishing the imprest accounts for \nindividual payments of up to $50,000. The MAWRPI will submit requests for replenishment to \nADB.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n101.  The MAWRPI will maintain project accounts acceptable to ADB, through the PMU, \naccording to the provisions of the Financing Agreement and ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB.24 The MAWRPI, on \nbehalf of the Government and through the PMU, will maintain separate records and accounts \nthat will allow goods and services to be financed out of the loan and grant proceeds, and \ngovernment financing to be identified and its use to be disclosed, following sound accounting \nprinciples. The accounts will show total expenditures by category for each project component. \nThey will record (i) amounts spent by the MAWRPI, (ii) amounts by project component; and (iii) \nand amounts by loan and grant financing.  \n \n102.  Independent auditors acceptable to ADB will audit these accounts and records yearly. \nWithin 6 months of the close of the financial year, certified copies of the audit report, together \nwith the auditor\u2019s opinion, will be submitted in English to the Government and ADB. The audit \nreports will include a management letter and a separate opinion on the use of the imprest \naccounts and statement of expenditures procedure. The Government has been advised that \ndelays in the submission of audited financial statements may result in the suspension of loan \nand grant disbursements by ADB. For the external audit of accounts, the loan proceeds may \nfinance the services of private sector auditors and the translation of their reports into English \nprovided that (i) the auditors are qualified, capable, and acceptable to ADB; and (ii) the auditors \nare recruited in a manner acceptable to ADB. \n \n                                                 \n24  ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Government and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \nManila. ", "     23\n103.  The PFIs will be required to maintain separate project accounts for the funds spent \nunder the Project. They must also maintain their overall accounts, audits, and financial status as \nrequired  by  the  NBKR  and  ADB.  The  PFIs\u2019  annual  accounts\u2014comprising  balance  sheets, \nincome statements, and fund flow statements at a minimum\u2014must conform to international \nfinancial accounting standards. The annual accounts and project accounts will be audited by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. Copies of the accounts and audit reports, together \nwith the auditor\u2019s opinion and management letter, will be submitted to ADB in English within 6 \nmonths of the close of each financial year.  \n \n104.  The MAWRPI, through the PMU, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The \nreports will indicate the progress made, the problems encountered, the steps taken to remedy \nthe problems, and a program of activities along with expected progress during the remainder of \nthe implementation period. The reports will also incorporate project performance monitoring \ndata and all relevant financial data. The reporting system will focus on outcomes, efficiency, and \nquality and will be consistent with international and local reporting standards, as well as with the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The MAWRPI will also provide other reports \nand information relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request. Within 6 months of \nproject completion, the MAWRPI, through the PMU, will submit a project completion report to \nADB that includes information on project implementation, use of the loan and grant proceeds, \nand accomplishments in relation to the Project\u2019s outcome and impact.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n105.  To monitor the Project\u2019s progress in achieving the planned outputs and outcome, the \nPMU  will  establish  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  within  6  months  of  project \neffectiveness. During project inception, a matrix of subindicators that substantiate the core \nperformance indicators shown in Appendix 1 will be developed by the PMU in a participatory \nmanner.  Where  feasible,  community-based  monitoring  mechanisms  will  be  developed  to \nstrengthen participation and community-level decision making. The performance monitoring \nsystem will be presented to the PSC for verification. Baseline data for the agreed indicators will \nbe  gathered  and  will  be  updated  every  6  months.  These  data  will  be  reported  to  other \ndevelopment partners, stakeholders, and the public. During the midterm review, the indicators \nwill be validated and may be modified to reflect project performance more accurately. \n \n106.  The GEF-financed activities will require monitoring, evaluation, and reporting to CACILM \nand  the  GEF.  Information  from  the  project  monitoring  systems  will  feed  into  the  CACILM \nnational M&E system, which will cover all CACILM projects in the Kyrgyz Republic and will \ntarget  four  types  of  information:  (i)  land  degradation  and  sustainable  land  management \nindicators for the design and monitoring framework; (ii) compliance with environmental and \nsocial  safeguards  that  may  be  prescribed  by  the  cofinancing  agreements  of  the  Strategic \nPartnership Agreement members;25 (iii) project implementation, including the recording and \ntracking of work plan progress, all project inputs, and all activities; and (iv) project finances, \nincluding annual disbursements, contracts awarded, and annual audited financial statements. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n107.  Semiannual  reviews  will  be  conducted  during  the  first  few  years  of  project \nimplementation  until  ADB  determines  that  an  annual  review  will  be  sufficient  for  effective \n                                                 \n25 Strategic  Partnership  Agreement  for  United  Nations  Convention  to  Combat  Drought  and  Desertification \nImplementation  in  the  Central  Asian  Countries.  Current  members  are  ADB,  the  Canadian  International \nDevelopment Agency, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification Project of the GTZ, the Global \nMechanism, the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas, the International Fund for Agriculture \nDevelopment,  the  SDC,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  the  United  Nations  Environment \nProgramme, and the World Bank. \n ", "24  \n \nadministration  and  implementation.  In  addition  to  these  regular  reviews,  a  comprehensive \nreview of the Project will be carried out jointly by the MAWRPI and ADB after 18 months and a \nmidterm review after 3 years of implementation. These reviews will, among other things, assess \nthe  overall  performance  of  the  Project  and  the  need  for  changes  in  its  design  and \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \n108.  At least one review a year by ADB should include capacity on the review team to \nindependently review the implementation of activities involving special technical skills, such as \nengineering for the irrigation and drainage rehabilitation component and pasture and livestock \nmanagement for the land improvement component.  \n \nIV. PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n109.  The Project will increase household incomes through a sustainable increase in farm \nproductivity  and  profitability.  These  benefits  are  expected  to  derive  from  the  integrated \nimplementation of activities to generate increased knowledge and better farming practices, \nincreased value added and improved performance of agribusinesses, reduced waterlogging and \nsalinity  and  reclaimed  lands  from  rehabilitated  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  and \nimproved water management, and improved planning and management of pasture lands and \norchards and reduced land degradation. The Project will benefit an estimated population of \n158,500 in 31,000 households in 17 aiyl okmotu farming 28,500 of irrigated land, 15,000 ha of \nrainfed land, and access to 93,000 ha of village pastures and an undefined area of midlevel and \nhigh mountain pastures in the three oblasts. The beneficiaries will include households that have \nan allocated land share as well as households who have only a household plot, but no allocated \nland share. About 58% of the beneficiaries live below the poverty line.  \n \nB.  Financial and Economic Analyses26 \n \n110.  The  Project  benefits  include  both  quantifiable  and  nonquantifiable  benefits.  The \nquantifiable  benefits  include  an  increase  in  yields,  a  reduction  in  the  area  of  wheat  and \nsunflowers required to meet home consumption requirements, and a diversion of this land to \nincreased forage and cash crop production. The nonquantifiable benefits not included in the \nanalysis include reduced flooding of settlements and household plots from improved drainage \nand multiplier effects in upstream and downstream sectors resulting from the integrated nature \nof the project. The analyses were undertaken for two scenarios: scenario A in which livestock \nnumbers is assumed to increase, and scenario B in which no increase in livestock numbers is \nassumed.  \n \n111.  To facilitate the analyses, a representative farm in lowland areas is assumed to have \n0.92 ha of irrigated land, 0.49 ha of rainfed land,27 and access to village pastures. The economic \nlife of the Project is assumed to be 20 years, with a 6-year implementation period. The analysis \ncompares without and with project scenarios over a 20-year period.  \n \n  1.  Financial Analysis \n \n112.  The Project is financially viable for lowland farmers, yielding a net present value of \nincremental benefits28 to all farmers of $36.22 million or $828 per ha. Gross margins are \n                                                 \n26  See Supplementary Appendix F for further information on the financial and economic analysis.  \n27 Based on average farm areas in shortlisted aiyl okmotu. \n28 The financial internal rate of return cannot be calculated for the individual farm. The farm pays increased ISFs, \nwhich are paid to the WUA that then contributes to the repayment of the 25% of the cost of onfarm irrigation and \ndrainage rehabilitation. Farmers do not make the capital investment directly themselves. Consequently there are \nno negative net incremental benefits in any year, and so the financial internal rate of return cannot be calculated. ", "     25\nestimated to increase from $512 per ha to $720 per ha and increased net margins from $352 \nper ha to $518 per ha. Under scenario B, without livestock benefits, the net present value is \n$635 per ha.  \n \n113.  Farmers\u2019 cash flow will also improve, with an annual cash margin estimated to increase \nfrom $314 per ha to $400 per ha. However, higher working and investment requirements under \nthe Project increase household borrowing from $122 to $155 per ha and to $377 in year 3 for \nadditional livestock purchases. Farmers are able to generate more than sufficient incremental \ncash  revenue  to  meet  the  borrowing  repayments.  Under  scenario  B,  without  livestock \npurchases, household borrowing requirements increase from $122 per ha to $156 per ha and \nfarmers\u2019 cash flow is adequate to meet these repayments. \n \n114.  Annual irrigation scheme O&M costs during implementation are assessed at about $0.85 \nmillion per year at the end of the implementation period, while both O&M and debt servicing \ncosts amount to about $1.3 million. An assumed increase in existing ISF levels of 47% (cash of \n$24.80 plus labor equivalent to $37.22 per hectare payments, and an assumed 90 percent \ncollection rate, will yield revenues for WUAs of $1.56 million). This will be sufficient to fully \nfinance  O&M  costs  and  WUAs\u2019  overheads.  Financial  management  of  ISFs  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the WUAs. The key issues in ensuring the WUAs\u2019 financial sustainability will be \n(i) the level of ISFs charged per ha, and (ii) the collection rate of ISFs achieved by the WUAs \nfrom member farmers. Both these factors have been analyzed. If the ISF cash component is set \nat Som1,000 per ha (it is currently around Som230), WUAs can afford the O&M costs (Som600 \nper ha) and build enough cash reserves to fund a major O&M that will be required in 15 years to \nmaintain full operational viability. In addition, the WUAs will need to recover at least 90% of all \nfees charged to ensure financial viability over time. Anything less than 90% will result in financial \ndeficits that will accumulate quickly. For example, if the collection rate drops to 80%, the WUAs \ncould expect to be more than $5 million in debt within 10 years of project commencement. The \nmounting WUA debt and/or failure to maintain the irrigation investment will result in wastage of \nthe Government\u2019s initial capital investment.  \n \n115.  Based on the assumptions with respect to land use, yields, prices, costs, input use, and \nhome consumption, farmers will enjoy a considerable improvement in their cash incomes. The \nanalysis of farm household cash flow indicates that farmers will be able to meet their ISF \nobligations to the WUAs. With the Project, ISFs as a percentage of farms\u2019 variable costs remain \nlow at less than 2%. The cash flow analysis demonstrates farmers\u2019 ability to pay; nevertheless, \nit will be the farmers\u2019 willingness to pay increased ISFs and the WUAs\u2019 ability to enforce \npayment that will be critical to the WUAs\u2019 financial viability.  \n \n  2.  Economic Analysis \n \n116.  For the economic analysis, a shadow exchange rate of Som40.30 to $1.00 was used. All \ncosts were expressed in constant 2006 prices. Economic values for cotton and for urea fertilizer \nwere calculated using border parity prices. A shadow wage rate conversion factor of 0.6 was \nused because underemployment is significant in the project area and much of the workforce is \nunderskilled. \n \n117.  The Project is expected to generate net incremental benefits with an economic net \npresent value of $31.2 million, an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 37%, and a benefit-\ncost ratio of 4.06 under scenario A. Of the total incremental benefits, 36% can be attributed to \ncrops and 64% to livestock. Scenario B demonstrates that the Project remains economically \nviable without any increases in livestock numbers, with an economic net present value of $12.3 \nmillion, an EIRR of 23%, and a benefit-cost ratio of 2.53, with crops accounting for 56% of \nincremental benefits and livestock for 44%. \n \n ", "26  \n \n118.  The sensitivity analyses examined increased cost or decreased benefit scenarios. The \nProject is economically robust under scenario A, and less robust but still economically viable \nunder scenario B. The EIRR is most sensitive to a reduction in crop and livestock prices of 25% \nand  a  delay  in  production  response  for  2  years,  with  the  EIRR  falling  to  22%  and  24%, \nrespectively. The EIRR has a low sensitivity to a decrease in the area under improved cropping, \na decline in yields, an increase in input prices, and an increase in investment costs, with the \nEIRR remaining over 30% in all cases. For scenario B, the Project remains economically viable \nat EIRRs of 15\u201317% except for a 25% reduction in crop and livestock prices, which results in an \nEIRR of 11%.  \n \n3.  Poverty Impact Analysis \n \n119.  A poverty impact analysis indicates that about 39% of project benefits will go to the poor. \nThe Project will also bring improved social benefits to the beneficiaries. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. Potential beneficiaries fall into two groups: (i) \nthose who have sufficient land and financial resources to reap the full benefits of improved \naccess to the irrigation water and drainage, inputs, pastures, credit, advisory services, and \noutput markets resulting from Project investments; and (ii) those who are very poor and who do \nnot own allocated land but may rent land or own a household plot only, who do not have \nresources or access to finance to benefit from the Project to the same extent as other farmers, \nand who are less willing to take the risks associated with making agricultural investments. \n \n120.  The Project will undertake measures to include the poor and vulnerable farmers in \nproject benefits. Such measures will include (i) targeting families that only have household plots; \n(ii) increasing the technical scope of advisory services to include topics that correspond to areas \nwhere poor farmers with limited resources have a comparative advantage, such as fruit and \nvegetable cultivation; and (iii) including in contracts with service providers for the promotion of \nvillage adviser services a requirement that consulting services target poor farmers who have \nfew resources, as well as nonpoor farmers. These contracts will also require that female farmers \nhave access to advisory services from village advisers. \n \nC.  Environment and Social Safeguards \n \n1.  Environment \n \n121.  ADB has categorized the Project as category B. An initial environmental examination \n(IEE) has been prepared. The Project is unlikely to cause any significant environmental impact. \nPotential  impacts,  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  and  capacity-building  activities,  and \nscheduling  and  reporting  requirements  are  presented  in  an  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring plan (EMP). The EMP clearly delineates institutional responsibilities and provides \ncost estimates. The monitoring program for the irrigation and drainage component includes cost \nprovisions  for  regular  sampling  of  surface  water  quality  in  the  irrigation  intake  of  and  the \ndrainage outlet from each WUA area. The EMP is to be revised, as necessary, during the \ninception stage of project implementation. Individual designs for rehabilitation of irrigation and \ndrainage infrastructure (and other subprojects with a works element) are to be submitted to the \nappropriate raion or oblast department of environmental protection for review. These designs \nshould include a site-specific environmental mitigation plan that is based on generic guidelines \nprovided in the IEE, which sets out environmental safeguards and mitigation measures to be \nincorporated  in  tender  documentation  for  design  and  works  contracts.  The  Project  site \nsupervisors and the M&E team will monitor compliance with these safeguards and mitigation \nmeasures,  which  will  be  subject  to  inspection  by  the  State  Committee  for  Environmental \nProtection and Forestry. Supplementary Appendix G provides more information on the summary \nIEE and Supplementary Appendix H provides more information about the IEE.  \n ", "     27\n  2.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n122.  The Project will only involve the rehabilitation of existing structures, such as irrigation \ncanals, drainage channels, small pasture infrastructure (e.g., bridges), and small marketing \nfacilities (e.g., cooling and storage facilities), and excludes any new construction. No works will \nbe carried out during cropping seasons to avoid damage to crops. Therefore no land acquisition \nor displacement is envisaged.  \n \n  3.  Indigenous Peoples \n \n123.  The three southern oblasts are dominated by the two main ethnic groups, Kyrgyz (70%) \nand Uzbeks (27%), with Osh having a higher Uzbek population than the two other oblasts. \nMinority groups include Russians (1%); Tajiks (0.6%); and others such as Tartars, Turks, and \nUighurs, but they live mostly in cities. Experience from ongoing programs by other development \npartners shows that discrimination in project activities based on ethnicity is unlikely. Conflicts \nabout water allocation occur across the border between the Kyrgyz Republic-and Uzbekistan, \nbut  typically  not  within  the  same  community  across  different  ethnic  groups.  Therefore  an \nindigenous peoples development plan will not be necessary. However, the Project\u2019s community \nparticipation plan (Appendix 12) will ensure that information about the services provided by the \nProject will be widely distributed among community members and that all ethnic groups will be \ngiven a fair chance to select community leaders to represent them.  \n \nD.  Community Participation and Gender \n \n1.  Participation \n \n124.  The Project has been prepared through a series of consultations with key stakeholders. \nIn addition to a series of focus group discussions with male and female community members in \nthe proposed project areas, a number of meetings have been organized with government \nofficials  and  WUA  support  unit  staff  regarding  the  criteria  for  WUA  selection.  The  three \nworkshops held in Batken, Jalalabad, and Bishkek in February 2006 involved representatives \nfrom farming households, credit unions, agriculture and agribusiness advisory service providers, \nlocal  and  national  governments,  NGOs,  and  development  partners.  The  needs  of  farmers \nexpressed through their participation in the workshops have been integrated into the project \ndesign. These workshops and other consultative processes also highlighted (i) the importance \nof  the  transparent  selection  of  representatives  from  farmer  groups  and  communities  to \nparticipate in the agriculture training and other opportunities provided by the Project, (ii) the \ncentrality of community mobilization through awareness raising and information campaigns for \nall project components, and (iii) the need for participatory M&E of WUAs\u2019 performance and of \nnatural resource management. These aspects have been highlighted in the Project\u2019s community \nparticipation and gender action plans (Appendix 12). A participatory approach at the community \nlevel is crucial to the Project\u2019s success to prevent or reduce any conflicts about water, land, and \nthe allocation and management of other natural resources. \n \n  2.  Gender  \n \n125.  Women in the south account for 70% of the agricultural labor force. However, their \nrepresentation  and/or  opportunities  in  agricultural  extension  services,  inputs,  processing, \nmarketing support, and decision making related to irrigation and natural resource management \nare marginal. During the Fact-Finding Mission, of the six WUAs visited, five had no women \ncouncil member, and one had one woman out of five members. The gender balance in training \nof trainers activities is also skewed. Even under current Rural Advisory Service training in the \narea where explicit emphasis was placed on gender equality and on addressing women\u2019s \nneeds, only 25% of the village advisers trained were women. Other service providers that do not \n ", "28  \n \npay explicit attention to gender issues have a much lower participation rate by women farmers. \nFurthermore, according to customary law, divorced women and daughters who are married \nhave no rights to land ownership in the case of divorce, while no such discrimination exists in \nwritten law.  \n \n126.  The experience of the ongoing AADP indicates that explicit attention to making sure that \nopportunities  are  equally  available  to  both  men  and  women,  looking  at  the  impacts  of \ninterventions separately by gender, and collecting and monitoring data disaggregated by gender \nare crucial in ensuring that the Project\u2019s benefits accrue to both men and women. The Project \nwill implement gender-focused activities (Appendix 12) that include the following: (i) specific \nprovisions for a gender balance in the number of trainers trained and in the types of training \nprovided to address the needs of women specified in the performance-based contract with the \nagriculture training service provider; (ii) information provided to women about the availability of \nlegal advisory services, including information related to problems with land ownership specific to \nwomen; (iii) disaggregation of key input, output, and outcome indicators by gender, wherever \nappropriate; (iv) encouragement of women through a community mobilization process to take on \npositions as village-level leaders and other representative positions in WUAs to be monitored by \nthe WUA support units; and (v) inclusion of gender and community development specialists in \nthe PMU.  \n \nE.  Project Risks and Sustainability \n \n127.  The design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) sets out a comprehensive list of \nrisks and assumptions for the Project.  \n \n128.  The Project is expected to significantly improve both the financial sustainability of target \nhouseholds as demonstrated by household cash flows and the environmental sustainability of \nthe farming system. This will come about through a shift in cropping to include higher-value \ncrops, including forage crops, in a more balanced crop rotation (as far as possible within the \nconstraints of small land plots). This will be brought about by improved pastures and more \nproductive use of degraded lands as a result of investments in WUAs, advisory services, \nagribusinesses, aiyl okmotu, and pasture user groups, which are designed to bring about the \nfinancial sustainability of all these organizations as far as possible. \n \n129.  The investment in WUA development aims to establish sustainable WUAs that (i) have \nadequate skills to plan for O&M of rehabilitated systems, (ii) can generate sufficient income from \nISFs to finance annual O&M and repayment of 25% of the cost of rehabilitation construction, \nand (iii) can allocate water more efficiently. The 5-year financial and O&M plans prepared by the \nWUAs are intended to ensure that these objectives are achievable. There is a moderate risk \nthat the collection of ISFs by the WUAs will be poor and that some WUAs may find it socially \nunacceptable to raise ISFs. If these risks materialize, the result is likely to be nonrepayment of \nthe 25% of funds to the Government rather than the collapse of WUAs depending on how the \nMOEF\u2019s State Development Fund enforces repayment.  \n \n130.  In their current form, the farm advisory services are highly dependent on finance from \ndevelopment partners and are not financially self-sustainable. The services are likely to be \nrationalized over the coming years, with a move away from training a large number of small \nfarmers to training village advisers, that is, successful farmers who will eventually sell their \nservices  to  other  farmers  as  independent  advisers  or,  in  a  limited  number  of  cases,  find \nemployment as advisers with cooperatives or agribusinesses. Competition between service \nproviders partly brought about by the opportunity to bid for contracts such as those under the \nAADP will help drive rationalization of the farm advisory services. The key to achieving financial \nself-sufficiency is an improved quality of services, which the Project\u2019s farm advisory service \ninterventions seek to achieve. \n ", "     29\n131.  The Project will invest in the rehabilitation of storage and cooling facilities. The Project \ndesign recognizes the need for financial sustainability of these facilities by requiring that (i) in \ncases where facilities are owned by local governments, operation of the facilities is transferred \nto private sector operators through a lease agreement with an option to purchase the facilities \nupon  the  expiration  of  the  lease  term;  and  (ii)  private  sector  operators  provide  cash  flow \nprojections for  the  facilities  and  investment  appraisals  demonstrating  investments\u2019  financial \nviability and sustainability. \n \n132.  The pasture land management plans will include financial projections for each of the \ninfrastructure investments to be financed under Project grants that show the costs and benefits \nto both the aiyl okmotu and the community and demonstrate that the cash flow from these \ninvestments will be sufficient to cover the recurrent expenditures necessary for maintenance. If \nthe investments do not generate sufficient financial incentives for the aiyl okmotu and the \ncommunity, there is a high risk that rehabilitated facilities and improved pastures will not be \nproperly  maintained.  Therefore  the  selection  of  investments  based  on  the  proper  criteria, \nincluding financial sustainability, will be critical. \n \n133.  Other important risks include some that are beyond the control of the Project, such as \npolitical instability, macroeconomic shocks, and commodity price shocks, and others that the \nProject can influence, such as corruption and a failure to recruit staff based on their skills rather \nthan on personal connections. The problem of interference in staff recruitment is a major risk, \nand  probably  the  key  factor  that  will  determine  the  Project\u2019s  success  or  failure.  The \nindependence of the PMU and the MAWRPI in staff recruitment is critical and must be strictly \nenforced. \n \n134.  Overall, given the identified risks and associated mitigation measures, the Project is \nconsidered  to  be  financially  and  economically  viable  and  to  have  a  high  level  of  overall \nsustainability. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n135.  In addition to the standard assurances regarding, among others, accounting, auditing \nand anticorruption, the Government has agreed to include the following assurances in the \nFinancing Agreement to be entered into with ADB:  \n \n(i)  The  Government  shall  make  available  all  counterpart  funds  required  for  the \nProject and on an annual basis for each fiscal year make adequate budgetary \nallocations required to implement the Project, including the requirements of the \nIEE, EMP, gender action plan, and community participation plan.  \n(ii)  The allotted annual budget allocations to any aiyl okmotu in the Project area shall \nnot be reduced as a result of any such aiyl okmotu being provided with grant \nfinancing from the Project and the annual budget allocations to any aiyl okmotu in \nthe Project area shall not be less than those from the previous fiscal year. \n(iii)  Prior to rehabilitating any cooling and storage facilities, the aiyl okmotu or the \ncooperative, as the case may be, shall obtain a commitment from a qualified \nprivate sector operator to operate and manage the rehabilitated facilities for a \nminimum period of 5 years.

Conditions for Loan and Grant Effectiveness \n \n136.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  meet  the  following  conditions  to  loan  and  grant \neffectiveness: (i) the central PMU shall have been established in Osh Oblast; and (ii) the central \nPMU shall be staffed with a full-time project manager, financial manager, and procurement \nspecialist, in each case acceptable to ADB. \n ", "     31\nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n \n137.  The Government has agreed to meet the following conditions for any loan disbursement \nbeing made to any PFI for purposes of establishing the credit line under the Project: (i) the \nGovernment and the PFI shall have entered into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement in form and \nsubstance  satisfactory  to  ADB;  (ii)  ADB  and  the  PFI  shall  have  entered  into  a  Project \nAgreement; and (iii) ADB shall have received a satisfactory legal opinion in respect of the \nlegality and effectiveness of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement and Project Agreement, among \nother matters. \n \nVI. RECOMMENDATION \n \n190.

This appendix focuses in more detail on the three project oblasts of Batken, Jalalabad, \nand Osh. \n \nA.  Population \n \n2.  The population of the southern part of the Kyrgyz Republic accounts for more than 47% \nof the country\u2019s total population. The population in the south totals 2.6 million people, of which \n47% reside in Osh Oblast, 36% in Jalalabad Oblast, and 17% in Batken Oblast. More than 77% \nof the population in these three oblasts is rural, compared with 65% nationally. The percentage \nof the population living in rural areas is even higher for the project raions. \n \n3.  In terms of poverty, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection divides the population \ninto four household categories: nonpoor (43%), poor (19%), very poor (34%), and extremely \npoor (37%). These poverty levels are based on monthly household incomes determined using \nhousehold social passport data.1 Of the 543,400 households living in the south, 32% live in \nhighland villages, of which 25% are extremely poor, 22% are very poor, and 11% are poor. Of \nthe 68% of households living in the lowlands, 19% are extremely poor, 18% are very poor, and \n11% are poor.2 The percentage of poor, very poor, and extremely poor differs by region in the \nsouth, with Batken having the highest number of extreme poor as a percentage of all poor.  \n \nB.  Agriculture \n \n4.  The availability of agricultural land per capita of rural population is lower in the three \ntarget  oblasts  than  nationally  by  36%  to  40%.  Similarly,  the  Land  Redistribution  Fund  is \nmarkedly smaller in the south: nationally, the Land Reallocation Fund is 0.11 hectares (ha) per \ncapita of rural population available, while in the south there is only 0.07 ha per capita of rural \npopulation in all three oblasts, about 36% less than the national average. Land use is further \ncomplicated by substantial land fragmentation into smaller plots. \n \n5.  Approximately 80% of all arable land in the country is irrigated, but in the three southern \noblasts, the figures are 48% in Batken, 53% in Jalalabad, and 62% in Osh. In addition, in \nBatken not only is the availability of irrigated land 70% of the national average, but Batken is \nless suitable for agricultural production because of the higher elevation, the shorter cropping \nseason, and the harsh climatic conditions.  \n \n6.  The  south  is  dominated  by  small  subsistence  farmers.  While  significant  differences \nbetween farms are apparent, the landholding of the average lowland farmer typically consists of \n0.60 ha of irrigated arable land and 0.29 ha of rainfed arable land, along with access to an \naverage of 3 ha of village pasture.3 A typical lowland farm uses at least 75% of its irrigated land \nto produce cereal crops (for domestic use), with the remaining 25% allocated to sunflower \nproduction (5%) for home-consumed cooking oil), cotton (12% for cash and by-products for \nfeeding livestock), vegetables (5% for cash), and fruit trees (3% for cash). In addition, six sheep \n                                                 \n1  Social passport data is included at the level of the aiyl okmotu. The monthly incomes of extremely poor households \nare less than Som140, of very poor households are between Som140 and Som400, and of poor households \nbetween Som400 and Som600.  \n2  These figures should be treated with caution. Anecdotal evidence suggests cases of people unfairly influencing the \nallocation of social passports. In addition, data problems with the classification of poor, very poor, and extremely \npoor households have resulted in duplication between categories.  \n3  This is an indicative figure based on the total amount of village pasture in the project area divided by the number of \nhouseholds in the project area. Farmers have to lease village pastures from the aiyl okmotu. They also have \naccess to midlevel and high mountain pastures if they can secure a lease agreement with raion and oblast \nadministrations, respectively. \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \n \nmight be fattened on concentrates, crop waste, and fodder. Rainfed arable land is used for \ncereals and forage production: 55% for cereals, 10% for safflower or other oil crops (for oil), and \n35% for forage (including 30% for sheep and 5% for dairy cows). Farms\u2019 cash income, after \nhousehold and livestock needs, is around $346 annually. Nonfarm income typically amounts to \na further $500 per year. Farm expenditure accounts for around $304 annually. Household \nexpenses (additional food, nonfood items, education, health, social obligations, and additional \nlivestock fodder purchases) typically account for a further $690 per year. Thus, households \nhave a cash deficit in most years and accumulate debt. They require financing, which reaches a \nseasonal peak of $179 per year.  \n \nC.  Crop Production and Marketing \n \n7.  A significant decrease in wheat areas, and corresponding increases in cash crop areas \n(notably cotton and oilseeds), has been apparent throughout the project area. This suggests \nthat small farmers may slowly be moving out of subsistence production, possibly in response to \ninvestments in irrigation infrastructure, agricultural services, and finance, or possibly because of \nan increased availability of wheat flour in shops.  \n \n8.  In Batken Oblast, wheat is by far the dominant crop in all raions\u2014along with maize and \npotatoes in upland areas and relatively small quantities of rice\u2014and is used primarily for home \nconsumption, with bran being fed to livestock. Cash crops include oilseed crops (partly for home \nconsumption); fruits (particularly apricots sold dried and cherries sold fresh to the Russian \nmarket);  vegetables;  and  small  areas  of  rice,  cotton,  and  tobacco  (sold  under  contract  to \ntobacco companies). A small decline in wheat areas and an increase in cash crops have been \nevident over the last 4 years. \n \n9.  In Jalalabad Oblast, wheat and maize mainly for home consumption are important, but \ncotton and oilseed production are more important sources of cash than in the other two oblasts, \nwhile  fruit production  is  less  important.  Small  areas  of  vegetables,  rice,  and  tobacco  also \nprovide  cash  income.  The  wheat  area  has  decreased  sharply  in  the  last  4  years,  with \ncorresponding increases in cotton and/or oilseed crop production depending on the raion. The \npistachio  and  walnut  forests  are  a  resource  unique  to  Jalalabad  and  are  of  international \nsignificance. The livelihoods of people around these forests are strongly linked to the forests. \n \n10.  In Osh Oblast, wheat is the dominant crop, which along with maize is used mainly for \nhome consumption. Oil crops and cotton are the main cash crops. Other cash crops are fruit, \nvegetables, and rice grown in small areas. Potatoes are important in upland areas. The cotton \narea has increased by almost 30% over the last 4 years.  \n \nD.  Livestock Production \n \n11.  Livestock numbers have increased since 2000. While official data suggest that livestock \nproduction per head is high, the data appear to be unrealistic. Official data indicate that lambing \npercentages in 2003 were 86% in Batken, 94% in Jalalabad, and 93% in Osh. The calving \npercentages in 2003 were 102% in Batken, 91% in Jalalabad, and 98% in Osh. Given the \nanimal health and nutrition issues farmers in the Kyrgyz Republic face, including in the three \nsouthern oblasts, these numbers appear to be unrealistically high. Milk yields typically range \nbetween 1,000 and 1,500 liters per lactation and are low. \n \n12.  With  the  fragmentation  of  administration  between  oblast  administrations,  raion \nadministrations, aiyl okmotu, and forest farms, the centralization of pasture monitoring in relation \nto effective grazing management in the south has not been achieved, resulting in overgrazing of \nthe lower pastures and undergrazing of the higher pastures. A complicating factor is the large \nnumber of animals from the Fergana Valley coming into the southern oblasts for summer \n ", "  Appendix 2  39 \nmountain  grazing,  which  makes  stocking  rate  calculations  of  limited  usefulness.  With  the \nintroduction of price differentiation (payments for summer grazing for livestock from neighboring \ncountries are around eight times more than those for local livestock), evasion of payment further \ncomplicates pasture management and animal health issues. \n \nE.  Irrigation and Drainage System \n \n13.  Table A2.1 shows irrigated areas and salinity levels and table A2.2 shows the incidence \nof waterlogging. \n \nTable A2.1: Proportion of Irrigated Land and Percentage of Salination,  \nSelected Oblasts, 2005 \n \nPercentage of  Percentage of Irrigated \nTotal Area  Total Area \nOblast  Irrigated Area  Area Moderately to \nIrrigated (ha)  Salinated (ha) \nSalinated  Strongly Salinated \nBatken    57,505  3,783  6.6  2.9 \nJalalabad  128,959  2,865  2.2  0.2 \nOsh  130,776  2,328  1.8  0.2 \nSource: Institute of Irrigation data. \n \nTable A2.2: Groundwater Depth Classes as a Percentage of Area Irrigated, \n Selected Oblasts, 2005 \n \nOblast  0\u20131.0  0\u20131.5  0\u20132.0  2.0\u20133.0  3.0\u20135.0  >5.0 \nBatken  0.7  1.3  2.3  2.3  2.7  92.7 \nJalalabad  0.3  2.9  5.8  2.5  5.0  86.8 \nOsh  1.0  2.3  5.0  2.1  2.0  90.9 \n  Source: Institute of Irrigation data. \n \nF.  Advisory Services \n \n14.  The Rural Advisory Service provides services in all three oblasts, but its coverage is \nlimited  to  less  than  6%  of  farmers.  The  three  oblast  Rural  Advisory  Service  offices  are \nindependent and have different organizational structures and approaches. The Training and \nExtension Service Center is an alternative service provider, which works in Osh Oblast, but is \nconsidering extending its services to Batken Oblast. The Association of Agribusinessmen of \nKyrgyzstan also provides advisory services to clients of its member agribusinesses (mainly input \nsuppliers) and is encouraging its agribusiness clients to provide advisory services to farmers \ndirectly. \n \nG.  Financial Institutions \n \n15.  The Kyrgyz Agricultural Finance Corporation has branches and sub-branches through \nthe project area and is likely to be the main source of finance for small farmers. The south has \n156 credit unions, a total of almost 14,000 members, and an active portfolio totaling $8.38 \nmillion.  The  three  established  microfinance  institutions\u2014Bai  Tushum,  Kompanion,  and \nFoundation for International Community Assistance\u2014all have branches in Osh and serve part of \nthe project area. At least three emerging microfinance institutions\u2014Agro Kredit Plus, Mehkr \nShavkat, and Oxus\u2014serve small parts of the project area, and are expected to expand.  \n \n \n ", "40  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \n1.  A number of entities have provided external assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has provided a series of technical assistance (TA) activities to \nthe Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry (MAWRPI) to support \nagricultural strategy formulation and policy development.1 The Swiss Agency for Development \nand Cooperation (SDC) undertook a policy support project that assisted with the preparation of \nMAWRPI\u2019s agrarian policy concept until 2010. The European Union Technical Assistance for \nCommonwealth of Independent States provided support for the strategy plan for the agriculture \nand food sector, which started in 1994, and the Regional Agricultural Reform Project, which \nstarted in 1996. The World Bank has had a major influence on agricultural strategy and policy \nthrough  its agriculture sector  projects  and  published  reports  on  agriculture sector  reviews, \nstrategy, and policy.2  \n \n2.  The European Union Food Security Program, which finances the entire MAWRPI budget \nexcept  for  salaries  through  conditional  budgetary  support,  has  initiated  a  series  of \nreorganizations and downsizing of the MAWRPI since the start of the program in 1997.3 The \nprogram has also established systems for providing training in agriculture sector budgeting at \nthe national, oblast, and raion levels.  \n \n3.  The World Bank has driven farm privatization and land reform through its Agricultural \nPrivatization and Adjustment Credit, Land, and Real Estate Project, on which it is working with \nGosregister, and the land and agrarian reform component of the Agricultural Services Support \nProject (ASSP).4 Legal support and public information on land reform has been provided by \nprojects funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the \nSDC (the Kyrgyz Land Reform Project, the Legal Assistance to Rural Citizens Project, and the \nLegal  Infrastructure  for  a  Market  Economy  Project),  as  well  as  by  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s \nDepartment for International Development (DFID) (the Third Party Arbitration Project). ADB is \ncurrently preparing an overview of the impact of land reform.5  \n \n4.  The Kyrgyz Agricultural Finance Corporation (KAFC), a nonbank financial institution, \nwas established in 1997 following the dissolution of Agroprombank and has since been financed \nthrough credit lines, namely, the World Bank Rural Finance Project I ($16 million), the World \nBank Rural Finance Project II ($15 million), the World Bank Agribusiness and Marketing Project \n(AMP, $5 million), the Farmers Development Fund ($2.25 million), and the ADB AADP ($10 \nmillion), and through guarantees from German development cooperation through Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ,  German  Agency  for  Technical \nCooperation) and from the Raiffeisen Foundation for Development Cooperatives. The KAFC \nhas received substantial TA from the World Bank, ADB, the European Union, and the DFID.  \n                                                 \n1  Loan 1407-KGZ: Agricultural Sector Program 1995; TA 2540 Reorganization and Strengthening of MAWR 1995\u2013\n1999; TA 3035 Capacity Building for MAWRPI Phase I 1998-1999; TA 3439 Capacity Building for MAWRPI, Phase \nII 2001\u20132003; and TA 4409 Agricultural Strategy Formulation 2005\u20132006). \n2  Agricultural Policy Review: Strategies for Rural Growth and Poverty Alleviation, 1998; Kyrgyz Agriculture and \nAgribusiness, Opportunities and Obstacles 1992; Irrigation in Central Asia\u2014Social, Economic, and Environmental \nConsiderations, 2003; World Bank Agricultural Policy Update 2004; Livestock Sector Review, 2005. \n3  The program started in the Ministry of Economy and Finance in 1997, and the MAWRPI office opened in 1999. \n4  The World Bank ASSP components are land and agrarian reform, seed sector development, crop protection and \nplant quarantine, rural advisory service and agricultural market information, and flood damage repair and are \nscheduled for completion in June 2007. The project is financed by an International Development Association credit \nof $13.9 million and an International Fund for Agricultural Development loan of $8.6 million.  \n5  Currently being prepared by the ADB under TA 4408-KGZ: Study on the Impact of Land Reform Agriculture, \nPoverty and the Environment. \n ", "  Appendix 3  41 \n5.  The Financial Company for Savings and Credit Unions, an apex organization that lends \nto  credit  unions,  was  financed  by  ADB  under  the  Rural  Financial  Institutions  Project6 and \nsupported by ADB TA7 and GTZ TA.  \n \n6.  Institutional development of the microfinance sector has been financed mainly by ADB,8 \nUSAID,  Mercy  Corp,  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation,  while  numerous \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  including  the  Aga  Khan  Foundation  and  GTZ  have \nprovided  microfinance  loans  directly  from  their  projects.  The  USAID  has  established  a \nwholesale microfinance organization, Frontiers, through which the Community Development \nInvestment Agency will disburse credit to several microfinance institutions in Chui and Osh \noblasts  under  the  ADB  Rural  Livelihood  Development  Project.9 The  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development is financing the provision of microfinance through commercial \nbanks under the Micro and Small Enterprises Financing Facility ($20 million under the first credit \nline and $30 million under a second credit line).  \n \n7.  The Rural Advisory Service, a nationwide advisory service and a sister organization to \nthe Agricultural Training Center, was established in 1998 under the World Bank ASSP and \ncontinues to be financed by the SDC and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. A \nfurther phase of financing may be considered during preparation of the ASSP II, which is likely \nto be in 2007. The Training and Extension Service Center, has been financed by both GTZ and \nthe USAID. Both advisory services now derive an increasing proportion of their income from \nservice contracts with various funding agency and NGO-financed projects, including the ADB \nAADP and Rural Livelihood Development Project. \n \n8.  The seeds industry is currently supported by the Swedish International Development \nCooperation Authority and the World Bank ASSP. Support has included development of a legal \nand  regulatory  framework,  including  the  Seed  Law  and  the  Plant  Variety  Protection  Law; \nassistance with attaining membership of international organizations governing the seed trade, \nthat is, the International Seed Trade Association, the Union for Protection of Varieties, and the \nInternational Seed Federation; protection of breeders\u2019 rights through the establishment of a \nroyalty collection system; technical support to specialized seed farms; establishment of the \nSeeds  Association  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic;  development  of  the  Republican  State  Seeds \nInspectorate and the Cotton Seed Inspectorate, which are responsible for seed certification and \ninspection; and assistance with developing agreements for seed multiplication with international \nseed companies. The World Bank ASSP has also distributed seed to 70 community seed funds \nunder a pilot program for poverty reduction \n \n9.  Funding agencies have supported the development of agribusinesses in various ways. \nOne approach has been the establishment of associations of agribusinesses, including the \nAssociation of Agribusinessmen of Kyrgyzstan, which was financed by the USAID, and the \nAssociation of Fruit and Vegetable Processing Industries which was supported by the Helvetas \nSupport to Private Initiatives Project funded by the SDC. A complementary approach used by \nthe Support to Private Initiatives Project was the development of local consultancy companies \nproviding financial planning, marketing, and legal services to agribusinesses. The World Bank \nAMP  established  the  Agribusiness  Competitiveness  Center  in  2005  to  provide  long-term \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1997.

The \nInternational Trade Center is supporting the certification of processors for international phyto-\nsanitary standards. Other projects have taken a more product-specific approach, including the \nHelvetas Local Market Development Project and the USAID-funded Agrofin Plus Project, which \nfacilitate the management of contracts between farmers and input suppliers, agroprocessors, \nadvisory services, and credit institutions for specific fruit, vegetable, and dairy products. The \nUSAID  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  Project,  implemented  by  Pragma \nCorporation,  provides  business  planning  advice  directly  to  small  and  medium  enterprises, \nincluding  agribusinesses,  which  is  also  the  approach  taken  under  the  ADB  AADP.  Little \nbusiness advice has been targeted specifically at machinery services other than the advisory \nwork undertaken by the AADP. However, between 1997 and 2001, the Japan International \nCooperation Agency provided tractors and combine harvesters as a grant to the Government. \nThe machinery was provided to beneficiaries under preferential lease agreements between \nbeneficiaries and the Altyntechservice, a state-owned enterprise now due for privatization. \n \n10.  The  German  Government,  through  the  GTZ  Development  of  Trade  and  Service \nCooperatives Project and the Raiffeisen Foundation for Development Cooperatives projects, \nhas assisted with the development of the legal framework for the establishment of cooperatives, \nprovided field TA, and provided finance to cooperatives through guarantee agreements with the \nKAFC and Bai Tushum. Various other projects have also included elements of cooperative \ndevelopment, including the Batken-based GTZ Project for Capacity Building and Food Security, \nRegional Cooperation, and Conflict Mitigation, which established Moll Tushum, a large input \nsupply cooperative with more than 1,500 members. \n \n11.  The  main  investments  in  relation  to  the  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  and  drainage \ninfrastructure have been made under the World Bank\u2019s Irrigation Rehabilitation Project ($46.80 \nmillion), the Onfarm Irrigation Project ($29 million), and the drainage and irrigation rehabilitation \ncomponent of the ADB AADP ($15.28 million). Further off-farm rehabilitation ($19 million) is \nscheduled  under  the  World  Bank  Water  Management  Improvement  Project.  Smaller-scale \nrehabilitation has been undertaken by the USAID, Mercy Corp, the European Union, the United \nNations Development Programme, and the Aga Khan Foundation. \n \n12.  The  legal  and  institutional  framework  for  water  management  resulting  in  the \nestablishment of water user associations (WUAs) and the new Water Code (2005) has been led \nby  the  World  Bank.  ADB  has  supported  water  management  through  several  TAs.10 The \nestablishment and training of WUA staff has primarily been undertaken by the World Bank \nOnfarm Irrigation Project and to a lesser extent and more recently, by the USAID. Further \ninstitutional reform, including the establishment of WUA federations, the reorganization of the \nDepartment of Water Resources, and the establishment of the State Water Administration, will \nbe undertaken under the World Bank Water Management Improvement Project.  \n \n13.  Investment in rural infrastructure has been financed under the ADB Community-Based \nInfrastructure Services Sector Project11 and the World Bank and DFID Rural Water Supply and \nSanitation Project.

These projects have also \nhelped establish capacity at the aiyl okmotu level for planning and grant management through \nthe establishment of investment committees. \n \n ", "44  Appendix 4 \nASSESSMENT OF THE AGRICULTURE AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT \n \n1.  The Southern Agriculture Area Development Project (SAADP) will adopt the same area \ndevelopment concept and approach used by the Agriculture Area Development Project (AADP) \nimplemented  in  Chui Oblast  in  the  north  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic. This  approach  seeks  to \naddress  a  range  of  issues  (drainage  and  irrigation,  access  to  credit,  advisory  services, \nmarketing, agribusiness development, and equitable access to land) simultaneously, focusing \nintensively on target aiyl okmotu. The AADP has had a substantial and visible impact on \nagriculture in those target aiyl okmotu where drainage and irrigation rehabilitation has been \ncompleted and the combined impact of all project components is now visible. Many aspects of \nthe AADP\u2019s design and implementation (notably, the farm development component and the \ndrainage and irrigation component) are therefore replicated in the Project, while other aspects \n(notably, the credit, agribusiness development, and marketing components) have been adapted \nto achieve a greater impact more rapidly. An additional component, land improvement, which \naddresses pasture management and orchard management constraints in the south, has been \nadded. \n \nA.  Overall Financial and Physical Progress \n \n2.  As of 30 September 2006, the Project had been under implementation for 102 months, \nwith a further 27 months to run until project completion (31 December 2008), had expended \n50.5% ($18.21 million) of total loan funds (SDR 8,297,000 or approximately $38 million), and \nhad achieved 79% of the intended physical progress. \n \nB.  Project Impact \n \n3.  The  AADP\u2019s  impact  on  farm  incomes  is  expected  to  be  achieved  through  several \ncategories of benefits. As drainage and irrigation rehabilitation has not yet been completed in \nthe majority of target aiyl okmotu, the combined impact of all project components is not yet \nmeasurable. The main categories of benefits are: (i) reduced flooding of settlements, including \nhouses, yards, garden plots (which are an important source of food security for the poor), and \ncrop storage areas as a result of drainage rehabilitation, including that undertaken to reduce \nvillage flooding1 in the Uzen Kur aiyl okmotu, approximately 20 households have benefited from \nreduced flooding. A further 1,450 houses affected by flooding are expected to benefit; (ii) \nreclamation  of  modest  areas  of  land  previously  unused  because  of  extreme  salinity  or \nwaterlogging as a result of drainage and irrigation rehabilitation. In Jany Pahta, 280 hectares \n(ha) (approximately 10% of the irrigated area) have been reclaimed and initially cropped with \ncabbage for sale to Kazakhstan. Cabbage will be grown in rotation with other crops, yielding a \nnet present value of incremental benefits of about $1.3 million or $4,600 per ha; (iii) a shift in \ncropping from low-value crops (e.g., nonirrigated wheat) to higher-value crops (e.g., alfalfa, root \ncrops, and vegetables in rotation with irrigated wheat) on significant areas of land. This is \nprimarily a result of drainage and irrigation rehabilitation in areas that were previously cropped, \nbut where cropping was restricted because of inadequate water supply or mild waterlogging and \nsalinity, and to a lesser extent is a result of improved marketing opportunities and training \nprovided by the Project. In Uzen Kur, a change in cropping has been achieved on 490 ha that \nwere previously cropped with nonirrigated wheat and are now cropped with irrigated wheat and \nalfalfa for cash sale. The latter crops will in the future be grown in rotation with other crops, \n                                                 \n1  The Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry requested, and the Asian Development \nBank approved, the reallocation of $3.5 million to undertake drainage rehabilitation in eight aiyl okmotu that \nexperienced extreme flooding of settlements. \n ", "  Appendix 4  45 \nyielding a net present value of incremental benefits of about $1.1 million  or $2,100 per ha. In \nJany Pahta, a change in cropping is expected to be achieved on 300 ha (approximately 10% of \nthe irrigated area), where areas previously cropped with nonirrigated wheat will now be cropped \nwith cabbage and alfalfa for cash sale in rotation with irrigated wheat. These crops will in the \nfuture be grown in rotation with other crops, yielding a net present value of incremental benefits \nof $1.2 million or $3,800 per ha; (iv) improved crop yields in areas where the Project has not led \nto a change in cropping, but where yields were previously constrained by inadequate water \nsupply, mild waterlogging and salinity, and poor production techniques. This is a result of a \ncombination of drainage and irrigation rehabilitation, training provided through the Project by the \nadvisory services, and, to a lesser extent, improved machinery services facilitated under the \nenterprise development component. In Uzen Kur, improvements in crop yields are expected to \nbe achieved on 1,475 ha as a result of drainage and irrigation rehabilitation and training, \nyielding a net present value of incremental benefits of $727,000 or $490 per ha. Similarly, in \nJany Pahta, improvements in crop yields are expected to be achieved on 2,400 ha yielding a net \npresent value of incremental benefits of $2.8 million or $1,200 per ha; (v) increased livestock \noutput as a result of purchases of livestock financed from the Kyrgyz Agricultural Finance \nCorporation (KAFC) credit line amounting to $10.5 million. Additional increases in livestock \noutput may also have resulted to a much lesser extent from improved livestock yields as a result \nof training in the area of livestock, which has been relatively limited compared with training in \ncrop production. \n \nC.  Project Results \n \n  1.  Farm Development \n \n4.  Training was provided to farmers by advisory services under contract to the Project. The \nkey constraint to the provision of services, particularly outreach, has been and remains the \nlimited  capacity  of  the  advisory  services,  although  notable  improvements  in  services  are \napparent. Both contractors (Rural Advisory Service and Arsten) initially had difficulties in fulfilling \nservices for which they were contracted, completing only 69% and 80% of contracted activities, \nrespectively,  in  2004,  although  this  increased  to  100%  for  both  contractors  in  2005.  The \nstandard of services has improved during the Project, with the annual monitoring score for the \nRural Advisory Service increasing from 62% in 2004 to 98% in 2006 for training and from 50% \nin 2004 to 91% in 2006 for demonstrations. The Project has contributed to improvements in \nservices by (i) introducing monitoring, performance-based payments, and competitive bidding \nfor services; and (ii) changing the approach to training from extensive training of a large number \nof farmers to intensive training of a small number of leaders of training groups. Consequently, (i) \n12,400 farmers (103% of the target) have been trained through formal classroom training, field \ndemonstrations, and/or consultancy, primarily in crop production, and to a lesser extent in \nlivestock production; (ii) 230 leaders of farmers\u2019 groups have been trained, many of whom have \nprogressed to work in agricultural advisory and other services;2 and (iii) 155 demonstrations \nhave been established and attended by almost 10,000 farmers. \n \n5.  In  2005,  the  Project  financed  the  development  of  a  1-year  course  in  agricultural \nextension at the Agrarian University in Bishkek to be implemented under contract with the \nAgricultural Training Center and in association with the Swiss Agricultural College. A course \ncurriculum has been prepared, 6 lecturers have been trained in course delivery, and the first 12 \n                                                 \n2   For example, of the 33 leaders trained by Arsten, 23% went on to work as village advisers for the advisory \nservices, 23% established small machinery or input supply services, and 10% became water user association staff. \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \nstudents have graduated from the course, with several going on to be employed by the advisory \nservices. The course is to be integrated into the Agrarian Academy\u2019s main curriculum in 2007. \n \n6.  Legal support was provided to farmers through cooperation with legal support projects \nfunded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The support was \nprimarily targeted at resolving land and property allocation disputes, which were most acute in \naiyl okmotu where large, unreformed cooperatives had emerged from the reorganization of the \nformer  state  farms  and  collective  farms.  The  social  tensions  and  lack  of  property  rights \ncharacterizing  these  disputes  were  a  barrier  to  achieving  advances  in  all  other  project \ncomponents.  The  Project\u2019s  cooperation  with  the  projects  funded  by  USAID  contributed \nsignificantly to the reorganization of cooperatives, enabling further development in aiyl okmotu. \n \n  2.  Drainage and Irrigation Rehabilitation  \n \n7.  The Project currently targets 20 water user associations (WUAs) serving 50,086 ha \n(90%  of  the  originally  targeted  area).3 The  Project  has completed  all  onfarm  and  off-farm \nconstruction for three WUAs serving 5,766 ha (10% of the originally target area), construction is \nongoing for a further eight WUAs serving 18,246 ha (33% of the originally targeted area), \nbidding for construction is ongoing for design for four WUAs serving 14,033 ha (26% of the \noriginally targeted area), design is ongoing for one WUA serving 3,604 ha (7% of the originally \ntargeted area), and designs are under tender for a further four WUAs serving 8,437 ha (15% of \nthe  originally  targeted  area).  Disbursements  for  onfarm  works  account  for  77%  of  total \ndisbursements  for  construction  to  date  and  those  for  off-farm  works  account  for  23%.  In \naddition, designs have been completed for civil works to alleviate flooding in six seriously \naffected villages and will be financed from unallocated funds ($3.5 million). \n \n8.  Even though the Project is expected to achieve rehabilitation of the target area before \nproject completion, implementation has been hindered by a number of factors in addition to cost \nescalations. The limited number of design and construction companies has meant that in some \ncases an inadequate number of bids were submitted or that bids were not competitively priced, \nleading to re-tendering. One design contract and one construction contract have been re-\ntendered. Designs were aimed at achieving technically and financially viable irrigation and \ndrainage systems. This did not imply complete rehabilitation of the systems; however, the \ncapping of rehabilitation costs for each WUA has in some cases resulted in a lower level of \nrehabilitation than some WUAs may have wished to undertake and been willing to repay,4 and \ngreater  flexibility  in  the  budget  for  each  WUA  may  have  been  desirable  and  has  been \nincorporated into the design of the Project. \n \n9.  The strengthening of WUAs was undertaken under a cooperation agreement with the \nWorld Bank Onfarm Irrigation Project, which had established WUA support units to establish \nand train WUAs. This collaboration has succeeded in ensuring that WUAs have attained the \nminimum criteria for participation in the Project and in advancing the WUAs\u2019 financial viability, \nspecifically,  in  helping  them  prepare  medium-term  financial  plans  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance of rehabilitated systems and for increasing water charges to cover such costs (a \nminimum requirement for participation in the Project). Ensuring implementation of these plans \nwill be an ongoing challenge for the WUA support units and will be critical for the long-term \n                                                 \n3  The reduced target area is due to increased investment costs from $184 to $284 per ha and also reallocation of \nfunds to address the village flooding problem. \n4  WUAs are required to repay 25% of the costs of construction over a 7-year period, with a 4-year grace period, \nstarting from the completion of construction.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  47 \nsustainability of the rehabilitated systems. The WUA support units have trained all WUAs under \nthe Project in administration, financial management, water engineering, water management, \nmonitoring and evaluation, and legal issues. \n \n  3.  Private Sector Input Supply and Marketing Services \n \n10.  The Project Management Unit (PMU) has sought to improve marketing opportunities for \nfarmers by (i) establishing informal marketing groups, (ii) identifying buyers, (iii) developing \nimproved  contract  terms,  and  (iv)  negotiating  contracts  with  buyers.  To  date,  59  fruit  and \nvegetable marketing groups serving 600 farmers and 13 milk marketing groups serving 100 \nfarmers have been established. Contracts for 12,000 metric tons of fruits and vegetables valued \nat $700,000 and for 673,000 liters of milk valued at $86,000 have been facilitated. Contract \nenforcement  remains  a  major  constraint,  with  both  parties  defaulting  on  contracts  with \npredetermined prices to seek short-term price gains through direct market sales or purchases. \nThe establishment of successful milk marketing groups early in the Project was hindered by the \ninability or unwillingness of group members to borrow to purchase milk cooling tanks and the \nabsence of alternative sources of finance for such investments. \n \n11.  The PMU has also worked to improve domestic and export marketing opportunities for \nprocessors and wholesalers. This has been achieved through missions to Kazakhstan and the \nRussian  Federation  to  identify  buyers;  assistance  with  representation  at  trade  fairs; \ncollaboration with other funding agencies to establish a new brand name (\u201ctaste of the sun\u201d); \nand development of an agreement to supply the major food market chain, Narodny, in Bishkek \nwith processed food products. The result has been an increase in total sales by five processors \nof $425,000. The Project currently supports six businesses in domestic and export markets and \nhas secured 25 contracts for a total of $275,000 since project inception. \n \n12.  The PMU has provided consultancy, including in the areas of market research, financial \nand strategic planning, and technical advice, to agribusinesses serving target farmers. Those \nsupported include 16 machinery contractors, 5 machinery repair services, 3 small machinery \nmanufacturers,  3  spare  parts  distributors,  21  fruit  and  vegetable  processors,  and  5  milk \nprocessors. Of these, six processing enterprises have been helped to secure finance totaling \n$415,000 from the KAFC. \n \n  4.  Rural Finance \n \n13.  A credit line of $10 million for investment finance was made available through the KAFC. \nTo date, $7.7 million has been disbursed from the Asian Development Bank to the KAFC, \nresulting in the lending of Som444.2 million ($11.1 million), of which 93% was for livestock \npurchases, 5% for equipment and construction, and 2% for processing. Fifteen percent of \nlending has been to target project areas and 85% to other areas within Chui Oblast, and 18.5% \nof the outstanding portfolio remains in the target area. The repayment performance on the credit \nline is high at 99.14%. The credit line has been managed independently by the KAFC, and the \nPMU has not been involved in lending decisions or monitoring. \n \n  5.  Project Management \n \n14.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry has proven to be \ncompetent in undertaking its role as the Executing Agency. Given its limited resources, the \noblast  administration,  the  Implementing  Agency,  contributed  little  to  the  PMU\u2019s  day-to-day \noperations, although it is involved in project oversight and tender committees. \n ", "48  Appendix 4 \n15.  The  financial  management  system  and  the  reporting  system  established  under  the \nAADP were successful and can be used for the Project with some adaptations. Acceptable \nprocurement procedures for irrigation and drainage rehabilitation took time to establish at the \nstart of the Project, and thus the Project subsequently experienced delays in relation to such \ncontracts. \n \n16.  The AADP\u2019s monitoring and evaluation system was established late during the Project, \nand until the recent appointment of a permanent sociologist, did not include adequate provision \nfor monitoring the Project\u2019s social and gender aspects. \n \nD.   Key Lessons  \n \n17.  As a result of the AADP\u2019s experience, oblast administrations have not been appointed as \nimplementing agencies under the Project, although it is considered important that they maintain \na strong oversight role through their representation on the Project Steering Committee. \n \n18.  The early establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system is essential, and the \nProject includes adequate national and international consultancy resources to be employed at \nthe start of the Project (including expertise in social and environmental monitoring) to ensure \nthat this takes place. \n \n19.  Other aspects of management that will be critical to the success of the Project include (i) \nestablishing a strong management team, (ii) replicating the financial management system used \nunder  the  AADP,  (iii)  ensuring  greater  transparency  and  fairness  in  staff  recruitment,  (iv) \ninvesting  in  staff  training  early  in  the  Project,  and  (v)  ensuring  sufficient  international \nconsultancy to support the PMU during the first 3 years of the Project. \n \n20.  While  the  general  approach  of  contracting  local  advisory  services  and  encouraging \ncompetition between service providers has helped improve the quality of the services provided, \nmore intensive investment is needed to improve the quality of training materials and field \nadvisers\u2019 skills. The Project includes a provision for a contract to develop high-quality training \nmaterials and train advisers in their use, as well as a provision for investment in farmer field \nschools to increase the number of village-based advisers with specialist extension skills. \n \n21.  The procurement procedure for the design of drainage and irrigation rehabilitation did \nnot result in significant competition given the limited number of design companies under the \nAADP, and in-house design capacity might have been preferable. In the south, the existing \noblast rehabilitation teams used by the World Bank have the capacity for basic design and can \nbe used by the Project with the support of a design company for complex designs. \n \n22.  Well-managed, financially sustainable WUAs are critical to the rehabilitation process and \nthe sustainability of rehabilitated systems. The cooperation agreement between the Project and \nWUA  support  units  established  under  the  AADP  is  to  be  replicated  under  the  Project. \nFurthermore, the Project includes an assurance that the Government will continue to finance the \nWUA support units during the life of the Project. \n \n23.  The  scale  of  technical  support  for  agribusiness  development  under  the  AADP  was \nrelatively small in relation to the amount of credit finance available, and the uptake of credit for \ninvestment  in  agribusiness  development  was  relatively  small.  Investment  in  support  for \nmarketing was similarly modest in relation to the overall project budget. To address this issue, \nthe Project design includes a provision to contract a local organization dedicated to agribusiness \n ", "  Appendix 4  49 \ndevelopment and marketing to provide, where necessary, long-term commercial consultancy to \nagribusinesses to help them prepare and implement investment proposals to be financed under \nthe credit line. Alternative forms of finance for agribusinesses, such as equity investment, will \nalso  be  examined.  The  organization  will  also  provide  marketing  links  between  these \nagribusinesses and farmers. \n \n24.  The conditions for obtaining credit from the KAFC under the AADP were not appropriate \nfor all farmers and agribusinesses. Diversifying the range of financial institutions involved in \ncredit  provision  to  include  commercial  banks  and  wholesale  microfinance  institutions  for \nonlending  to  credit  unions  and  microfinance  organizations  under  the  Project  will  provide \nborrowers with more choices and will encourage competition between lenders. \n \n25.  In conclusion, the Project seeks to replicate the overall approach used under the AADP, \nbut  greater  investment  in  agribusiness  development,  marketing,  and  diversification  of \nparticipating financial institutions and the addition of a component to address pasture and \norchard management are expected to lead to an even more successful area development \nproject in the south. \n ", "50  Appendix 5 \nASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND IX GRANT COMPONENT \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank will provide financing of $20 million for the Southern \nAgriculture Area Development Project. Of this total, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is \nrequesting an Asian Development Fund IX grant allocation of $5 million to finance (i) farmer \ntraining and village advisory services; (ii) pasture land management; (iii) orchard management; \n(iv) project management; (v) international consultants; and (vi) national consultants. \n \nA.  Constraints to Growth and Poverty Reduction \n \n2.  The crop, livestock, and agro-industrial subsectors continue to experience substantial \nadjustments. Agriculture continues to underperform, as many of the farms and agroprocessing \nfacilities are not operating efficiently, are not profitable, and in some cases are not financially \nviable.  \n \n3.  The vast majority of arable land has been distributed since 1994. A functional land lease \nmarket exists, but the land sales market is largely inactive. Moreover, the Land Redistribution \nFund consists of 25% of arable land that was not distributed, intended partly for allocation to the \npoorest  members  of  society  and  those  returning  to  the  country  after  the  land  distribution \nprocess. The fund is managed by aiyl okmotu, and land is mostly leased on a competitive basis. \nHowever,  the  transparency  and  competitiveness  of  the  leasing  process  vary.  The  Land \nRedistribution Fund limits the amount of land that is available for the private lease and sales \nmarket.  \n \n4.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  three  different  levels  of  pasture  land,  and  the  current \nadministration  by  three  different  levels  of  government,  the  monitoring  of  pasture  use  and \npasture quality by the State Land Development Institute, and the existence of forest farms, \nwhich lease out pastures from the Forest Fund, make the current pasture administration and \nmanagement system unsustainable. In addition to the lack of transparency, the leasing system \nis too complicated to be widely applied, there is no effective monitoring of the conditions of \npasture land, and no investments are made to improve access to and the quality of pastures. \n \n5.  The supply of agricultural inputs is largely in private sector hands. Agrochemicals are \navailable, but verification of their origins and quality is not always satisfactory. In addition, the \nequipment for applying fertilizer is often inaccurate and presents a danger to the health of users. \nDemand for inputs is constrained by a lack of finance. Development of the seed sector is \nconstrained by (i) the loss of contacts with traditional customers in the former Soviet Union and \nEastern Europe; (ii) the limited resources of the research institutes, which are responsible for \nfield testing before certification by the seeds inspectorate; and (iii) the absence of arrangements \nfor royalty payments. Furthermore, seed multiplication and distribution is concentrated in the \nhands  of  a  small  number  of  large  farms  that  remain  largely  unreformed  because  of  their \nstrategic status.  \n \n6.  The small sizes of farms, the relative abundance of labor (largely female) despite high \nlevels of migration, and the unsuitability of the remaining large-scale machinery, which is also in \na poor state of repair, mean that the demand for and the supply of machinery services are \nlimited.  \n \n7.  The Kyrgyz Republic is highly dependent on irrigated agriculture, with 80% (1.1 million \nhectares) of the 1.4 million hectares of arable land in the country being irrigated. Constraints to \nefficient water management exist at the national, oblast, raion, and water user association \n(WUA) levels. WUAs are responsible for the ownership and management of onfarm irrigation \nsystems. The Department of Water Resources of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, \nand Processing Industry is responsible for off-farm drainage and irrigation. In addition, the 434 \n ", "  Appendix 5  51 \nWUAs across the country, which have inherited dilapidated irrigation and drainage systems, \nrequire further support and training. Even though more than a third of existing systems have \nbeen rehabilitated, a vast area still requires rehabilitation.  \n \n8.  Since 1991, livestock previously concentrated in a relatively small number of collective \nfarms  were  dispersed  among  a  large  number  of  households,  but  at  the  same  time,  the \nveterinary system declined because of budget cuts. Staff numbers declined rapidly and the free \nsupply of drugs ceased. The current veterinary service does not have the right staff, budget, \nworking conditions, and facilities to fulfill the tasks required to deal with the minimum public \nveterinary tasks of legislation, regulation, control, and monitoring; however, private veterinary \npractices have not developed quickly enough to fill the vacuum. \n \n9.  The value added to agricultural production is limited. The agroprocessing sector is weak, \nand even though it is recovering, it is not growing as fast as the agriculture sector. Existing \nprocessing units face difficulties in securing raw materials of consistent quantity and quality from \nsmall farmers because of the low level of farm productivity; the weak contractual arrangements, \nwhich both parties often dishonor; and the poor collection, storage, and cooling facilities. Border \naccess is a major problem for both farmers and agribusinesses in the south.  \n \n10.  The Rural Advisory Service is well established and has a national network that includes \nseven oblast offices and a system of raion-based advisers. The quality of services provided by \nthe Rural Advisory Service varies among oblasts. Outreach is low at around 25% of all villages \nand 6% of farmers within each village.  \n \n11.  The research institutes lack clear research strategies and the resources to implement \nthem. Farmers and the extension services perceive research to be irrelevant to farmers\u2019 needs, \nand the link between research and extension is weak.  \n \n12.  The  provision  of  agricultural  finance  faces  both  supply-side  and  demand-side \nconstraints. The demand-side constraints are a result of low farm productivity and farmers\u2019 \nperceptions of borrowing for cash crop production as being high risk and the interest rates as \nbeing excessively high. Only about 5% of commercial bank lending is for agriculture, storage, \nand agroprocessing. The exception is the Kyrgyz Agriculture Finance Corporation, which lends \nonly to the agriculture sector and has a loan portfolio of $38.20 million,1 of which 8% is for \nagroprocessing. The Financial Company for Savings and Credit Unions was established under \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s Rural Financial Institutions Project to develop and finance credit \nunions. The company currently has assets of $10 million. German development cooperation \nthrough Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency for Technical \nCooperation) has also provided technical assistance for the Financial Company for Savings and \nCredit  Unions.  Considerable  unmet  demand  for  microfinance  loans  exists  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s medium-term microfinance development \nstrategy estimates unmet demand for loans by farms and enterprises of between $24 million \nand $40 million and unmet demand from poor households of between $14 million and $18 \nmillion.  \n \nB.

No \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic:  \nThe national poverty reduction strategy 2003\u20132005 has set private sector-led, pro-poor economic growth through \nimproved market access and an enhanced production base in the agriculture sector and in rural areas as one of its key \npriorities. The follow-on strategy\u2014the Country Development Strategy 2007\u201320101\u2014indicates that the agriculture \nsector will continue to be a priority.  Both the national poverty reduction strategy 2003\u20132005 and the country \ndevelopment  strategy  2006\u20132010  are  medium-term  plans  for  implementing  the  comprehensive  development \nframework 2010, which aims to reduce income poverty from 52.3% in 2000 to 26.5% in 2010. So far, the country is on \ntrack to achieve this goal: the incidence of income poverty has fallen steadily, reaching 39% in 2003.2  However, \ncontinuous efforts in relation to pro-poor growth are needed to achieve the comprehensive development framework \n2010 goal as well as Millennium Development Goal 1.  \n \nThe agriculture sector accounted for more than 33% of gross domestic product in 2000\u20132004. When combined with \nagroprocessing and agriculture services and trade, the agriculture sector contributes more than 40% of gross domestic \nproduct.  The  sector  also  accounts  for  more  than  50%  of  total  employment.3 With  a  shrinking  nonagricultural \nemployment market, reliance on the agriculture sector has been growing, which has led to economic growth since \n1996. The continuous growth in the sector caused by the shift from subsistence agriculture to commercial production \nwill have a significant positive effect on the growth of other sectors through increased demand for nonagriculture \nproducts by rural households, as well as on employment.   \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis has been carried out?  \nThe social assessment carried out as part of Project preparation4 included the following types of poverty analysis: (i) \nsocioeconomic poverty profiles in the proposed project areas, and (ii) impact of the Project on poverty and the poor \nfrom the perspective of equity or inclusiveness. The experience of the ongoing Agriculture Area Development Project \nand the World Bank-assisted Onfarm Irrigation Project provided a significant amount of information related to poverty \nand institutional and social impacts.  As the Project is categorized as a general intervention, a full poverty analysis was \nnot conducted. \n \nPoverty Data. During project preparation, geographic targeting of poorer raions (was considered as one of the \nselection criteria using the most widely available poverty classification (nonpoor, poor, very poor, and extremely poor) \nupon which the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection bases the provision of social assistance.  However, the \nProject\u2019s social assessment confirmed the unreliability of the data because of the widespread practice of households \nmaking informal payments to local government staff so as to obtain social assistance. Hence the geographic targeting \nwas dropped. Nonetheless, available information indicates the generally high incidence of poverty in the southern \noblasts.  According to the National Statistics Committee, compared with the 42.9% incidence of poverty at the national \nlevel in 2004, the poverty level in Batken, the poorest oblast, was 77.8%, with rural poverty standing at 82.9%.  Using \ndata from the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, which uses monthly household incomes as thresholds, 57% of \nthe population of the nine proposed project raions were classified as below the poverty line (i.e., poor, very poor, and \nextremely poor) in 2005. \n                                                 \n1  The Country Development Study 2007-2010 has been approved by the Government and submitted to Parliament \nfor its consideration. \n2  Starting from 2003, a new poverty line was adopted and the consumption-based poverty measurement was \nofficially adopted. Using the new poverty line, the incidence of poverty was 43.5% in 2005, compared with 47.9% in \n2003 and 42.9% in 2004.   \n3  ADB. 2006. TA 4438 Final Report. Manila (July). \n4  It involved (i) a literature review and a statistical review; (ii) a household survey of 92 households, including 33 \nfemale household heads; (iii) a series of focus group discussions; and (iv) a number of semistructured interviews \nwith key stakeholders.   \n ", "  Appendix 11  65 \n   \nLand and Cropping Patterns. Distinctions between the population living in the uplands (32% of that in the three \noblasts) and the lowlands (68%) are important in terms of landholding size, cropping patterns, and poverty. A typical \nupland farmer in the proposed project area has 0.5 hectares (ha) of irrigated arable land, 0.72 ha of rainfed arable \nland, and access to 12 ha of village pastures.  Upland farmers typically grow cereal crops, sunflowers, and potatoes \nand other cash crops. Jalalabad is unique in its production of walnuts and pistachios on land leased from forest farms \n(administered nationally) or local administrations. Livestock is an important source of cash income. The incidence of \npoverty is higher among upland farmers than among lowland farmers. A typical lowland farmer has 0.6 ha of irrigated \narable land, 0.29 ha of rainfed arable land and access to an average of 3 ha of village pastures. Lowland farmers tend \nto grow cereal crops, sunflowers, cotton, vegetables, and fruit trees, and also engage in some livestock production. \nBoth upland and lowland farmers achieve basic household food security, but their financial security is fragile and they \nexperience a cash deficit most of the year that often leads to some accumulation of debt. Farmers\u2019 mechanisms for \ncoping with financial difficulties include economic migration (to Kazakhstan, to Russia, and sometimes to the city of \nBishkek), which is most prevalent in Batken; sale of assets; leasing their lands; sales of fruit, milk, and other produce \nfrom their household plots, which are normally for household consumption; and borrowing money. Demand for \naffordable credit is high. Livestock is becoming an increasingly popular means of livelihood, increasing the pressure on \nland degradation. \n \nWhile the vast majority of land has been distributed since 1994, the land sales market is largely inactive. Even though \nthe southern oblasts have been ahead of the north in relation to land distribution, legal disputes related to unclear \nownership, restrictions on land use, restrictions on women\u2019s rights to inherit land, and other issues are still not \nuncommon. Twenty-five percent of arable land has been earmarked for the Land Redistribution Fund, administered by \naiyl okmotu, at least 20% of which has to be leased to poor households at preferential rates. However, the capacity to \nimplement Land Redistribution Fund management varies across aiyl okmotu and is generally low. In addition, \nhousehold size is typically large, especially for the bottom quintile of the population, which has an average of 6.1 family \nmembers per household, and this contributes to the problem of land fragmentation.   \n \nSocial Cohesion. Although much progress has been made in terms of structural reforms, the erosion of social capital \n(e.g., mutual community trust and assistance) continues, accelerated by migration and growing gaps between the \nbetter-off and the poor within communities. The extent of migration, which is more frequent among men, is not well \ndocumented, but various interviews with locals indicate that migration averages 20\u201330% of the male population. While \nthe traditional mutual help systems, such as ashar (mutual exchange of labor among kin and neighbors) still exist \namong poorer households, the better-off tend to set up social networks along with production functions. Conflicts and \ntensions over water and, to a lesser extent, land is common. Most cases are resolved within the community, e.g., by \nthe dispute resolution commissions of water user associations (WUAs), but some WUAs report court cases.  \n \nSocial Accountability. During the Project\u2019s social assessment, fewer than 40% of household survey respondents \nbelieved that aiyl okmotu represented community members\u2019 needs. Community members, and especially the poor, \noften see aiyl okmotu leaders as abusing their power in relation to deciding who is eligible for access to credit, training, \nand agricultural inputs and machinery. WUAs, whose membership ranges from 500 to 2,500 households, are too large \nfor a community-based institution and are often perceived as a replica of aiyl okmotu. More than half the respondents \ndid not know what the WUAs\u2019 objectives were, as the training and communications provided by the Department of \nWater  Resources  to  the  WUA  support  units  focuses  on  WUA  councils  and  not  on  the  members.  Smaller \nneighborhood-based self-help groups, which are often organized by local nongovernment organizations (NGOs), are \nconsidered to be more important and more relevant to the average farmer. The implication for the project design is that \nthe selection of village advisers, farmer field school trainees, and WUA subgroup leaders will have a major impact on \nproject effectiveness, and that the process of selection will need to be transparent to community members. \n  \nBorder Issues. Tensions over water sometimes go beyond the community level and may become a border issue. In \nthe raion of Kadamjay in Batken Oblast, for example, most aiyl okmotu border Uzbekistan. The Isfara River flows in \nand out of both countries several times. WUA members in Markaz, Kadamjay, reported a case to the project \npreparation team in which the upstream Uzbek community diverted water away from the Markaz community and the \nlatter retaliated by asking another Kyrgyz community to stop the flow of water back to the Uzbekistan side. Similar \ncases have also been reported in other parts of the oblast. The unique border between the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan \nand Uzbekistan, as well as the existence of a number of enclaves of Uzbek territory within Batken, make cross-border \ntrade and free movement difficult. Efforts by NGOs such as Mercy Corps to build peace at a community level across \nborders in the Ferghana Valley have been stalled since the Andijon incident in Uzbekistan in 2005.  \n \nEthnicity. While the south includes a mosaic of ethnic groups (Kyrgyz 70.0%; Uzbeks 27.0%; Russians 1.0%; Tajiks \n0.6%; and others such as Tartars, Turks, and Uighurs), habitation patterns in rural communities are generally along \nethnic lines. In the project areas, available information indicates that discrimination against minorities is unlikely to be \nan issue, while the tension between the two dominant ethnic groups (Kyrgyz and Uzbeks) may be an issue, particularly \nacross the border. Within communities, the approach should not be to protect any particular group, but to ensure equal \nopportunities for all ethnic groups through broader community participation.         \n \n \n ", "66  Appendix 11 \nGender. As detailed below and in the gender action plan, men and women are experiencing the transition and poverty \ndifferently. Unlike other neighboring ethnic groups, the Kyrgyz enjoyed relatively equal partnerships between the two \ngenders until the Soviet system collapsed. The increasing pressure on women\u2019s reproductive role resulting from the \nerosion of the social safety net; the increasing vulnerability of women because of the re-emergence of old traditions; \nthe perceptions in relation to women and girls manifested in bride theft, polygamy, domestic violence, and human \ntrafficking; and the growing gender disparities in public representation and employment opportunities are notable. In \nthe south, while women account for 70% of the labor force in agriculture, opportunities related to training, credit, and \ndecision making are especially limited in the agriculture sector. The feminization of agriculture is particularly prevalent \nin the south, where many men (although also women) migrate to the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and Bishkek.     \n \nProject Impact on Poverty and the Poor. The Project is categorized as a general intervention, as its direct \nbeneficiaries are farming households with small allocated land plots in the project area, which includes about nine \nraions in the three southern oblasts of Batken, Jalalabad, and Osh.  The primary beneficiary group in the short term \nwill be those male and female farmers who are capable of taking risks to expand their production and marketing by \ncapturing the opportunities provided by the Project.    \n \nThe development of a strategic nucleus is a prerequisite for employment generation based on agriculture and \nagroindustry and an increase in household incomes among a larger group of poor households in the medium term. \nThe Project also complements a number of interventions by other funding agencies and NGOs in the project area \nspecifically targeted at the poor and the marginalized, including female-headed farm households, e.g., the US Agency \nfor  International  Development  through  Winrock  International  and  Mercy  Corps,  the  European  Union,  German \ndevelopment cooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit, SDC (Swiss Agency for \nDevelopment and Cooperation) United Nations Development for Women, Agency for Technical Cooperation and \nDevelopment, and the Community Development Investment Agency.  \n \nFurthermore, the following inclusive elements of the Project will enhance its pro-poor nature:  (i) the inclusion of pro-\npoor activities in the service provider contracts where possible, such as the provision of training in household plot \nmanagement, vegetable growing, livestock breeding, and other topics of concern to the poor; (ii) the inclusion of \nmicrofinance wholesaler support in the credit component in addition to the provision of finance for agribusinesses; (iii) \nthe enhanced awareness raising among members and households in relation to the functions and responsibilities of \nWUAs, not just among WUA council members; and (iv) the participatory nature of community-based planning for land \nuse and natural resource management (e.g., of pastures) through participatory rural appraisal and other community \nmobilization processes.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nDuring project preparation, stakeholder analyses and extensive stakeholder consultations were conducted at a various \nlevels, including (i) institutional analysis of value chain actors and supporters, (ii) social assessment, (iii) three \nparticipatory stakeholder workshops,5 and (iv) WUA selection meetings. The value chain stakeholder analysis included \na strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis for each key institution, leading to the final design of the \nagribusiness component. Each project component involves a different set of stakeholders, but these can broadly be \ncategorized as (i) private sector service providers, e.g., farm advisory service providers, legal service providers, \nfinancial  institutions,  agribusiness  advisory  service  providers,  input  suppliers,  machinery  contractors,  and \ncooperatives; (ii) central ministries, including the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry \nand others represented on the Project Steering Committee); (iii) local administrations,  that is, oblasts, raions and, aiyl \nokmotu; (iv) community groups, e.g., WUAs and livestock and pasture management committees; (v) individual farmer \nbeneficiaries (male and female, local elite and poor); and (iv) funding agencies and civil society groups working in the \nsector or in the project oblasts. The key institutional approach of the Project is to establish effective links between \nthese stakeholders to promote pro-poor growth. In particular, performance-based contracts will be used with the \nprivate sector partners to provide appropriate incentives. \n  \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes (Appendix 12 Community Participation Plan)              No   \nParticipatory processes at the community level are crucial to avoid unnecessary conflicts, especially over water; to \nprevent from creating a sense of inequality along ethnic lines; and to alleviate the helplessness and cynicism of those \ngroups that are often excluded within the community, such as the poor and women. The financial and institutional \nsustainability of WUAs and community-based pasture management institutions depends on the accountability and \ninclusiveness forged by the participatory process.  \n \n \n                                                 \n5  Financed by ADB. 2004.

Gender Development  \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe Project\u2019s social assessment, the midterm gender evaluation of the ongoing Agriculture Area Development Project, \nand the existing literature on women in agriculture in the country provide a good account of gender issues in \nagriculture for application to the three southern oblasts. The welfare cuts and the disappearance of child care support \nthrough collective farms and state farms disproportionately affected women\u2019s competitiveness in the labor market, \ndriving them to take up lower-paid work. In the south, where mechanization of crop production is less advanced than in \nthe north, women\u2019s contribution to agricultural labor is higher and is reported to be around 70% of the total labor force \nin  the  sector.  One  impact  study  among  customers  and  noncustomers  of  members  of  the  Association  of \nAgribusinessmen of Kyrgyzstan indicates that as production increases, women\u2019s workload as sellers of agricultural \nproduce increases. Their contribution to farm household incomes is significant, especially in the south, but their \nrepresentation in decision making in water management, farm development training, and agribusiness enterprises is \nmarginal. About 10% of all farm households are headed by women. Even though the incidence of poverty is \nstatistically higher among male-headed households than female-headed households, female household heads are \ndisadvantaged in terms of access to fair representation and services.  \n \nThe key gender issues relevant to the Project include (i) the hesitance of women when self-selecting for agricultural \ntraining and community representation because of pressures to follow social norms that view women as secondary to \nmen, lack of self-confidence to enter into male-dominated activities, and lack of time; (ii) the low representation of \nwomen on WUA councils, the WUA directorate (i.e., paid positions), and audit and dispute resolution committees and \nas WUA village leaders, leading to their lack of understanding of the entire cropping system; (iii) the concentration on \nsmall-scale activities (e.g., household plots, microenterprises for a small amount of agricultural produce, demand for \nsmall loans over a long-term repayment period); and (iv) the customary law constraints to owning land in the case of \ndivorce or for daughters who are married (if such cases are brought to courts, they would be obliged to divide the land \nunder written law, but women tend to resort to local religious leaders, clan leaders, or the Court of Aksakal, which \napply customary laws). Women also express interest in going beyond so-called women\u2019s projects such as handicrafts \nto learn about new agricultural techniques, and the Project offers a great opportunity to satisfy such emerging needs. \nThe Project\u2019s gender action plan will address these issues to the extent possible. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
