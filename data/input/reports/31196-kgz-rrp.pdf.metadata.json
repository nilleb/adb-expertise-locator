The  summary \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \nThe proposed Project is Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) third \nproject in agriculture and natural resources in the Kyrgyz Republic \nand adapts the concept and approach of the ongoing area-based \nAgriculture  Area  Development  Project  in  Chui  Oblast  to  three \noblasts  in  the  south  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic:  Batken,  Jalalabad, \nand Osh.  \n \nThe Project focuses on the lowest level of government, that is, aiyl \nokmotu.  The  Project  will  (i)  provide  support  for  agricultural  and \nlegal advisory services by improving the capacity, technical scope, \nquality,  and  outreach  of  existing  advisory  service  providers; \nfacilitating  access  to  existing  legal  services;  and  increasing  the \navailability  of  and  access  to  credit  by  farmers;  (ii)  increase  and \nimprove  contractual  arrangements  between \nfarmers  and \nagribusinesses \ninput  supply,  machinery  services,  and \nwholesale  and  processing  enterprises;  improve  agribusiness \nto \nperformance; \nappropriate  financing  facilities  for  agribusinesses;  and  increase \npublic  investment  in  physical  market  infrastructure;  (iii)  develop \nwater  user  associations  (WUAs)  further  and  rehabilitate  irrigation \nand  drainage  systems  in  cooperation  with  the  World  Bank;  and \n(iv)  support  a  holistic  and  participatory  approach \nthe \nsustainable use of pasture lands and the improvement of orchard \nmanagement.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  integrate  ongoing  and  planned  activities  and \nto  contract  available  service  providers  for  project  implementation \nwhere feasible. \n \nThe  agriculture  sector  continues \nto  experience  substantial \nadjustments  in  its  transition  to  a  market-oriented  economy. \nDespite  its  importance  to  the  economy  and  recent  growth, \nagriculture  continues  to underperform,  as  many  of  the  farms  and \nagroprocessing  facilities  are  not  operating  efficiently,  are  not \nprofitable, and in some cases are not financially viable. \n \n\nthe  availability  of  and  access \n\nincrease \n\nfor \n\nto \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \n\nin \n\nissues, \n\nto  provide  effective  services; \n\nThe  key  problems  being  addressed  are  the  low  productivity  of \nland  and  the  low  profitability  of  agriculture.  The  key  constraints \ncontinue to be the absence of a land market, the nontransparent \nuse of the Land Redistribution Fund, and the poor administration \nand  management  of  pasture  lands;  the  lack  of  readily  available \nand accessible agricultural inputs and the need to reorient various \nservices,  such  as  veterinary,  machinery,  and  advisory  and \nresearch services, to the market system and their need for further \nthe \ncapacity  development \ndeteriorating  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure;  the  need  for \nimproved  water  management;  and  the  limited  access  to  and \navailability  of  micro  and  rural  finance,  especially  for  investment \nlending. \n \nUnder  the  Agriculture  Area  Development  Project  (AADP),  a  new \nconcept and approach to ADB assistance in the Kyrgyz Republic \nwas  developed.  This  approach  is  holistic  in  addressing  the  key \nconstraints  and \nterms  of  unifying \nintegrated \ninterventions  in  specific  geographic  areas  and  coordinated  in \nterms  of  partnerships  with  other  projects  and  outsourcing  to \neffective  local  service  providers.  Both  the  Government  and  ADB \nhave  been  satisfied  with  the  progress  of  the  AADP  and  the \nGovernment has requested further adaptation of this concept and \napproach to the country\u2019s southern regions. \n \nThe  grant  component  of  the  Project  will  improve  the  agricultural \nknowledge  and  capacity  of  farmers;  prepare  plans,  maps,  and \ninvest  in  pastures;  prepare  plans  and  invest  in  orchards;  and \nfarm \ninternational  and  national  consultants \nprocure \ndevelopment,  agribusiness  advisory  services, \nirrigation  and \ndrainage \nrehabilitation,  orchard  management,  and  project \nmanagement.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  expected \nis  region-wide  adoption  of \nimproved  agricultural,  orchard,  and  pasture  management \ntechniques. The expected outcome of the Project is a sustainable \nincrease in land productivity and profitability.  \n \nThe investment cost of the project is estimated at $31.23 million, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  of  $2.80  million,  $3.75  million  for \nphysical  and  price  contingencies,  and  $0.52  million  in  interest \ncharges  during  implementation.  ADB  will  finance  $20.0  million \nequivalent\u2500$15  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian  Development \nFund  (ADF)  resources  and  $5  million  with  an  ADF  IX  grant.  The \nGlobal  Environment  Facility  will  finance  $2.5  million  equivalent, \nthe Government, $6.81 million equivalent, and beneficiaries, $1.92 \nmillion equivalent.  \n \n\nimpact \n\nfor \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nthe \n\nirrigation  and  drainage \n\nA  loan  in  various  currencies equivalent  to  SDR 9,925,000  ($15.0 \nmillion) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be provided. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, \nan  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  set  forth  in  the  Financing  Agreement.  The  loan  will  meet \nthe costs of the credit line for farms and agribusiness; the advisory \nservices  for  agribusinesses;  the  public  investment  in  marketing \ninfrastructure \ninfrastructure; \nrehabilitation;  the  WUA  technical  credit;  the  equipment  for  WUA \nsupport  units;  and  the  costs  of  office  equipment  and  vehicles, \ntraining,  workshops  and  seminars,  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsurveys,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  for  vehicles  and \nequipment,  support  staff,  and  utilities  for  project  management. \nThe ADF IX grant of $5 million will finance the training of trainers \nand  farmers;  the  planning  and  mapping  of  and  investment  in \npastures;  the  planning  of  and  investment  in  orchards;  the \ninternational  and  national  consultants  for  farm  development, \nirrigation  and  drainage  rehabilitation,  orchard  management  and \nproject  management;  and  the  support  staff  and  related  office \nfor  project  management.  The  proposed  Global \nexpenses \nEnvironment  Facility  grant  of  $2.5  million  will  meet  the  costs  of \nadditional  training  of  trainers,  farmer  field  schools,  and  village \nadvisory \ninfrastructure,  and \nimprovement,  monitoring,  and  capacity  development  for  aiyl \nokmotu  and  pasture  user  groups;  international  and  national \nconsultants  for  land  improvement;  and  equipment,  vehicles, \ncommunications,  support  staff,  workshops  and  seminars, \nmonitoring and evaluation, staff training, and communications and \nreport  production  for  project  management.  The  Government  will \nprovide  in-kind  contributions  to  finance  taxes  and  duties  and \nbudget support for WUA support unit costs and off-farm irrigation \nand drainage system O&M costs. The WUAs will finance O&M of \nthe  rehabilitated  infrastructure  on  completion  and  repay  25%  of \nthe costs of irrigation and rehabilitation construction.  \n \nThe loan funds will be provided by the Government to the Ministry \nof  Agriculture,  Water  Resources  and  Processing  Industry  as  a \ngrant except for a $4 million equivalent credit line to be channeled \nthrough  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MOEF)  to \nparticipating financial institutions. The MOEF will onlend the funds \nin  som  or  US  dollars.

The \ninternational  and  national  consultants  will  be  recruited \nin \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(April 2006, as amended from time to time) using consulting firms, \nfull technical proposals, and quality- and cost-based selection.  \n \nThe  benefits  of  the  Project  are  expected  to  be  increases  in  the \nproductivity  and  profitability  of  farms  and  agribusiness.  These \nbenefits  are  expected \nintegrated \nimplementation  of  activities  to  generate  the  following  benefits: \nincreased  knowledge  and  better  farming  practices;  increased \nvalue  added  and \nimproved  performance  of  agribusinesses; \nreduced  waterlogging  and  salinity  and  reclaimed  lands  from \nrehabilitated  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  and  improved \nwater  management;  improved  planning  and  management  of \npasture lands and orchards; and reduced land degradation. \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  a  population  of  158,500  in  31,000 \nhouseholds  in  the  3  oblasts.  Project  beneficiaries  will  include \nhouseholds  that  have  an  allocated  land  share  as  well  as \nhouseholds who have only a household plot, but no allocated land \nshare. About 58% of the beneficiaries live below the poverty line. \n \nThe \nto  establish \nsustainable WUAs. The 5-year financial and O&M plans prepared \nby  the  WUAs  are  intended  to  ensure  that  these  objectives  are \nachievable.  There  is  a  moderate  risk  that  WUA  collection  of \nirrigation service fees will be poor and that some WUAs will find it \nsocially unacceptable to raise irrigation service fees. If these risks \nmaterialize, the outcome is likely to be nonrepayment of the 25% \nof  funds  to  the  Government  rather  than  the  collapse  of  WUAs \ndepending on how the MOEF\u2019s State Development Fund enforces \nrepayment.  \n \n\nin  WUA  development  aims \n\nto  derive \n\ninvestment \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nto  achieving \n\nfinancial  self-sufficiency \n\nIn their current form, farm advisory services are highly dependent \non finance from development partners and are not financially self-\nsustainable. Competition between service providers partly brought \nabout  by  the  opportunity  to  bid  for  contacts  such  as  those  under \nthe  AADP  will  help  drive  rationalization  of  the  farm  advisory \nservices.  The  key \nis \nimproved  quality  of  services,  which  the  Project\u2019s  farm  advisory \nservice interventions seek to achieve. \n \nThe Project will invest in the rehabilitation of storage and cooling \nfacilities  and  recognizes  the  need  for  financial  sustainability  of \nthese  facilities  by  requiring  appropriate  mechanisms  for  their \nmanagement, financial viability, and sustainability. \n \nThe  pasture \nfinancial \nprojections  for  each  of  the  infrastructure  investments  to  be \nfinanced under project grants. If the investments do not generate \nsufficient financial incentives for the aiyl okmotu and communities, \nrehabilitated facilities and improved pastures may not be properly \nmaintained, thus proper selection of investments based on criteria \nthat include financial sustainability will be critical. \n \n \n\nland  management  plans  will \n\ninclude \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fo\n71  00'E\n\no\n78  00'E\n\nKYRGYZ  REPUBLIC\nSOUTHERN AGRICULTURE AREA DEVELOPMENT\n\no\n42  30'N\n\nMaimak\n\nTalas\n\nTALAS\n\nK A Z A K H S T A N\n\nShopokov\n\nKara Balta\n\nCHUI\n\nBISHKEK\n\nTokmok\n\nCholpon-Ata\n\nBalykchy\n\n- K u l\n\nk\n\ny\n\ns\n\ns\n\nI\n\ne  \n\nL a k\n\nKochkorka\n\nDzhergalan\n\no\n42  30'N\n\nTyup\n\nKara Kol\n\nISSYK-KUL\n\nToktogul\n\nToktogul Reservoir\n\nTerek Sai\n\nTash Kumyr\n\nKarakul\nJALAL-ABAD\n\nKok Yangak\n\nShamaldy Sai\n\nKochkor Ata\n\nMassy\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n\nBazar Korgon\n\nJalal-Abad\n\nAndizhan Reservoir\n\nUzgen\n\nSuzak\n\nKara Su\n\nOsh\n\nAravan\n\nChaek\n\nLake Song-Kul\n\nNARYN\n\nNaryn\n\nLake Chatyr-Kul\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\no\n38  00'N\n\nSulyukta\n\nIsfana\n\nBatken\n\nFrunze\n\nPulgon\n\nHaidarkan\n\nBATKEN\n\nNaiman\n\nKyzyl Kiya\n\nOSH\n\nSary Tash\n\nPEOPLE'S    REPUBLIC\nOF   CHINA \n\no\n38  00'N\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nProject District\n\nProject Oblast\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMain Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial/Oblast Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n78  00'E\n\n0\n6\n-\n4\n0\n9\n4\n \nH\nR\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\no\n71  00'E\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \n1. \nloan,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  grant,  both  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Southern  Agriculture  Area \nDevelopment Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n2. \nAt the request of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  approved  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  Southern \nAgriculture Area Development Project.1 The TA was carried out from August 2005 to July 2006. \nThe  participatory  process  for  Project  preparation  was  facilitated  through  regional  TA  on \nparticipatory  approaches.2 Two  regional  workshops  and  one  national  workshop  were  held  for \nabout  137  participants,  of  which  27%  were  women.  The  participants  consisted  of \nrepresentatives  of  the  central  Government,  local  governments,  farming  households,  and \ndevelopment partners; members of cooperatives and water user associations (WUAs); staff of \ncredit  unions  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  and  owners  of  agro-enterprises.  The \nworkshops  discussed  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  experience  with  participatory  approaches  and \nmade recommendations to be considered in designing the Project. This report is based on the \nTA  feasibility  study;  the  participatory  process  workshops;  the  findings  of  ADB  workshops;  and \nthe  discussions  held  with  Government  officials,  the  private  sector,  and  development  partners. \nThe Project is adapting the concept and approach of the Agriculture Area Development Project \n(AADP)3 in the Chui Oblast, which was approved in 1999 and is still under implementation. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  a  small,  mountainous,  landlocked  country.  The  Government\u2019s \nstructural  reform  program  has  achieved  macroeconomic  stability  and  reasonable  growth.  The \npolitical  upheavals  of  2005  have  been  stabilized  and  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  is \nexpected to be 5% in 2006 and 5.5% in 2007. Growth still remains heavily dependent on gold \nproduction. Inflation has remained below 5%,4 the budget deficit has declined from 54% of GDP \nin  2003  to  4%  in  2005,  government  revenues  have  increased  from  22.2%  of  GDP    in  2002 \n24.9% in 2005 of GDP  and the exchange rate has remained relatively stable since 2002. The \nGovernment  remains  within  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  targets  under  the  Poverty \nReduction  and  Growth  Facility.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  remains  highly  indebted,  and  the \nGovernment has requested debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries initiative, but it \ncurrently exceeds the initiative\u2019s revenue threshold of 250% by a substantial margin.  \n \n4. \nPoverty  levels  are  declining.  Based  on  per  head  consumption,  poverty  declined  from \n49.9%  in  2003  to  45.9%  in  2004  and  extreme  poverty  declined  from  17.2%  to  13.4%.5 During \nthe same period, urban poverty declined from 35.7% to 28.3% and rural poverty declined from \n57.4% to 55.5%; however, rural poverty continues to be significantly higher than urban poverty. \nInequality is increasing, with the Gini coefficient6 increasing from 0.29 in 2001 to 0.33 in 2004, \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004.

Batken Oblast is the poorest province, with 77.8% of its \npopulation being poor, while Chui Oblast is the least poor, with a poverty rate of 21.7%.7   \n \nThe agriculture sector is extremely important to the economy. It accounts for more than \n5. \n33%  of  GDP  (average  for  2000\u20132004),  50%  of  employment  (75%  in  rural  areas),  and  11%  of \nexports. Of the total land area of 19.6 million hectares (ha), pasture land accounts for the largest \narea, 47%. Only about 7% of the country is arable land, of which about 80% is irrigated. \n \n6. \nSince  1996,  agricultural  growth  has  increasingly  been  driven  by  private  small  farm \nproduction.  Between  1996  and  2004,  average  yields  increased  substantially:  61%  for \nvegetables,  24%  for  grains,  13%  for  cotton,  and  8%  for  milk.  During  the  same  period,  gross \noutput increased by 55% for vegetables, 8% for grains, 95% for cotton, and 34% for milk. The \nshare  of  production  from  state  farms  declined  from  22%  in  1995  to  6%  in  2004.  With  the \nemergence of slightly more commercially oriented small private farms since 1999, the share of \nproduction from household plots declined from 65% in 1995 to 40% in 2004. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe agriculture sector continues to experience substantial adjustments in its transition to \na  market-oriented  economy.  Despite  its  importance  to  the  economy  and  recent  growth, \nagriculture  continues  to  underperform,  as  many  farms  and  agroprocessing  facilities  are  not \noperating  efficiently,  are  not  profitable,  and  in  some  cases  are  not  financially  viable.  In \naddressing  the  key  problems  of  low  productivity  and  profitability  in  agriculture,  several  key \nissues pertain to land, agricultural inputs and services, infrastructure, and finance (Appendix 2). \n \n8. \nThe absence of a viable land market, the nontransparent use of the Land Redistribution \nFund,8 and the poor administration and management of pasture lands are directly inhibiting the \nproductivity  and  effective  use  of  these  lands.  Most  arable  land  is  privately  owned,  and  even \nthough  a  functional  lease  market  exists,  the  land  sales  market  is  largely  inactive.  The  Land \nRedistribution  Fund  is  managed  by  aiyl  okmotu,9 and  land  is  mostly  leased  on  a  competitive \nbasis.  However,  the  transparency  and  competitiveness  of  the  leasing  process  varies.  Aiyl \nokmotu governments administer the lowest-level pastures, raion administrations administer the \nmidlevel  pastures,  and  oblast  administrations  administer  the  high  mountain  pastures.  In \naddition,  forest  farms  lease  out  pastures  from  the  Forest  Fund.  The  State  Land  Development \nInstitute  monitors  pasture  land  use  and  quality.  The  current  pasture  administration  and \nmanagement  system  is  not  sustainable  because  of  a  lack  of  transparency,  no  effective \nmonitoring  of  pasture  conditions,  and  of  investments  to  improve  access  to  and  the  quality  of \npastures. Extensive land degradation caused by salinity, waterlogging, erosion, and overgrazing \nis also evident. Some current land management practices reflect a lack of knowledge, training, \nand experience.  \n \n9. \nAgricultural inputs and services are slowly developing, but need to be reoriented to the \nmarket  system  and  require  further  capacity  development  to  provide  effective  services.  The \nsupply of agricultural inputs is largely in private sector hands. While nitrogen fertilizer is widely \navailable, other fertilizers are not. Agrochemicals are available, but the verification of origin and \nquality  is  not  always  satisfactory.  Application  equipment  is  often  inaccurate  and  dangerous  to \nthe  health  of  users.  Under  the  former  Soviet  Union,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  was  an  important \n                                                 \n7   Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2006. Country Development Strategy (2006\u20132010). Bishkek. Draft. \n8  Land Redistribution Fund comprises 25% of agricultural land held by the state and controlled by aiyl okmotu. It is to \nbe  used  for  state-run  farms  such  as  for  seed  and  cattle  breeding  or  allocated  to  individuals  who  did  not  receive \ntheir title to land in the initial allocation. \n\n9   Known  locally  as  ayil  okmotu,  these  are  the  lowest  level  of  local  government  and  may  include  more  than  one \n\nvillage. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\nproducer of seed and has the potential to multiply imported seeds for both the domestic market \nand  for  re-export,  but  will  need  to  address  the  research  institutes\u2019  limited  resources  for  field \ntesting,  the  absence  of  arrangements  for  royalty  payments,  the  concentration  of  seed \nmultiplication  and  distribution  on  a  small  number  of  large  farms,  and  the  need  to  adopt \ninternational  measures  and  standards  to  comply  with  World  Trade  Organization  requirements. \nThe demand for inputs is also constrained by a lack of finance. \n \n10. \nSmallholders account for most agricultural production, but the various services available \nto them have not been able to adapt to the changing farm structure. The state veterinary system \nhas  diminished  because  of  budget  cuts,  and  the  current  veterinary  service  does  not  have  the \nstaff,  budget,  working  conditions,  and  facilities  to  fulfill  the  tasks  associated  with  legislation, \nregulation, control, and monitoring, and private veterinary practices have not developed quickly \nenough to fill the vacuum. The value added to agricultural production is limited, as processing \nunits face difficulties in securing a consistent quantity and quality of raw materials; contractual \narrangements  are  weak;  and  collection,  storage,  and  cooling  facilities  are  poor.  Machinery  is \ngenerally  in  a  poor  state  of  repair  and  is  inappropriate  for  small  farms.  This  means  that  the \ndemand  for  and  supply  of  machinery  services  and  the  absence  of  finance  further  constrain \ninvestment in more appropriate machinery. The Rural Advisory Service is well established and \nhas a national network that includes seven oblast offices and a network of raion-based advisers, \nbut  the  quality  of  services  varies  between  oblasts,  and  outreach  is  low  at  around  25%  of  all \nvillages  and  6%  of  farmers  within  each  village.  The  research  institutes  lack  clear  research \nstrategies and the resources to implement them. Farmers and the extension services perceive \nresearch  to  be  irrelevant  to  farmers\u2019  needs  and  the  link  between  research  and  extension  is \nweak.  \n \nIrrigation and drainage infrastructure is in need of rehabilitation. The Kyrgyz Republic is \n11. \nhighly dependent on irrigated agriculture, with 80% (1.1 million ha) of the 1.4 million ha of arable \nland  being  irrigated.  Constraints  to  efficient  water  management  exist  at  the  national,  oblast, \nraion,  and  WUA  levels.  WUAs  are  responsible  for  the  ownership  and  management  of  onfarm \nirrigation systems and the Department of Water Resources (DWR) of the Ministry of Agriculture, \nWater Resources, and Processing Industry (MAWRPI) is responsible for off-farm drainage and \nirrigation.  The  country  has  434  WUAs,  and  these  continue  to  require  support  in  relation  to  (i) \nplanning  and  implementing  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  programs;  (ii)  undertaking \nfinancial management, in particular, estimating O&M costs and setting and collecting irrigation \nservice fees (ISFs);10 (iii) managing water allocation and improving water use efficiency; and (iv) \nresolving the incomplete transfer of the ownership of drainage and irrigation infrastructure from \naiyl okmotu to WUAs. WUA support units in each raion are providing training and consultancy to \naddress these problems. \n \n12. \nThe WUAs have inherited dilapidated irrigation and drainage systems. More than a third \nof  existing  systems  have  been  rehabilitated,  including  off-farm  systems  and  major  structures \nunder  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project,  onfarm  systems  under  the  World \nBank\u2019s Onfarm Irrigation Project (OIP), and in Chui Oblast under the AADP. Other rehabilitation \nis being done by the Aga Khan Foundation, Winrock International, and others. Nevertheless, a \nvast area still requires rehabilitation, and the DWR has identified 82 schemes serving 235,000 \nha that require immediate rehabilitation. \n \n13. \nfaces  both  supply-side  and  demand-side \nconstraints.  The  demand-side  constraints  are  a  result  of  low  farm  productivity  and  farmers\u2019 \nperceptions of high risk and of interest rates being excessively high. The supply-side constraints \ninclude  (i)  infeasible  borrower  applications,  (ii)  banks\u2019  inexperience  in  assessing  agricultural \n\nThe  provision  of  agricultural \n\nfinance \n\n                                                 \n10  Estimates  indicate  that  ISFs  will  need  to  increase  from  an  average  cost  of  approximately  Som230  per  ha  to \n\nSom1,000 per ha to cover onfarm O&M costs. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nis \n\nlending \n\nOnly  about  5%  of  commercial  bank \n\n \ninvestment  loans,  (iii)  absence  of  acceptable  collateral,  and  (iv)  banks\u2019  own  limited  access  to \nfinance because of limited deposits. \n \n14. \nfor  agriculture,  storage,  and \nagroprocessing. 11  The  Kyrgyz  Agriculture  Finance  Corporation  (KAFC)  lends  only  to  the \nagriculture sector and has a loan portfolio of $38.2 million,12 of which 8% is for agroprocessing. \nThe Financial Company for Savings and Credit Unions has assets of $10 million and lends to \ndiversified  borrowers,  including  in  agriculture.  The  microfinance  market  serves  approximately \n102,241  borrowers  and  has  a  total  outstanding  loan  portfolio  of  about  $82  million.  While  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  has  139  microfinance  institutions,  three  established  microfinance  institutions \ndominate the sector, namely, Foundation for International Community Assistance, Kompanion, \nand  Bai  Tushum,  which  lend  approximately  85%  of  the  microfinance  institution  portfolio.  The \nmicrofinance sector includes 5 banks, 300 credit unions, and the KAFC. In addition, the country \nhas  two  wholesale  lending  institutions.  As  of  the  end  of  2004,  agriculture  accounted  for  only \n12%  of  the  outstanding  loan  portfolio  of  the  microfinance  institutions.13 There  is  considerable \nunmet  demand  for  microfinance  loans  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  with  the  National  Bank  of  the \nKyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  (NBKR\u2019s)  medium-term  microfinance  development  strategy  estimating  the \ndemand for loans to be $24 million\u2013$40 million for farms and enterprises and $14 million\u2013$18 \nmillion for households.  \n \n15.  While  the  issues  facing  agricultural  development  are  diverse,  they  are  interrelated  and \nshould be addressed as far as possible in a holistic, integrated, and coordinated manner. The \nsocial  accounting  matrix  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Country  Economic  Memorandum  200514 shows \nhigh intersectoral linkage multipliers for all agricultural products above 2.6, with the multiplier for \nlivestock  products  (3.2-3.5)  exceeding  crop  products  (2.6-2.8). 15  The  input  supply  industry \nmultiplier  is  2.7.  This  highlights  the  need  for  simultaneous  investment  in  upstream  and \ndownstream sectors to take full advantage of the multiplier effects of agricultural growth. \n \nThe World Bank\u2019s Agricultural Policy Update 200416 presents a social mobility matrix for \n16. \n662 households for 1999\u20132002. The study demonstrates the importance of agriculture in lifting \nthose in the lowest income quintile out of poverty and concludes that poverty is transient. During \n1999\u20132002,  54%  of  those  in  the  lowest  income  quintile  improved  their  income  ranking,  while \n75%  of  those  in  the  second  quintile  maintained  or  improved  their  income  ranking.  The  study \nconcluded that income mobility was driven by land reform and subsequent agricultural growth, \nwith  the  lowest  quintile  increasing  agricultural  sales  by  335%  compared  with  an  average  of \n111%  and  own  food  consumption  by  71%  compared  with  an  average  of  18%.  However, \nfollowing this impressive upward mobility, those who remained in the lowest quintile at the end \nof  2002  are  constrained  by  a  low  agricultural  asset  base  that  limits  their  potential  for  further \nagricultural growth: they derive only 35% of their income from agriculture (compared with 45% \nfor the second, third, and fourth quintiles and 40% for the fifth quintile) and spend 47% of their \ncash on food. As long as nonagricultural opportunities remain limited, ensuring access to land \nand other agricultural assets is critical for increasing the incomes and food security of those in \nthe  lowest  quintile.  Given  the  high  percentage  of  cash  income  the  lowest  quintile  spends  on \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2004.

Washington, D.C. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\nfood,  the  development  of  an  efficient  agriculture  sector  that can  produce  low-cost  food  is  also \ncritical for ensuring the food security of those in the lowest quintile. \n \n17. \nThe development of the agriculture sector is guided by the comprehensive development \nframework  (to  2010)  and  the  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  for  2003\u20132005.  Further \nguidance is provided in various presidential decrees and addresses to the nation. According to \nthe comprehensive development framework, priorities until 2010 are cooperative development; \ndevelopment  of  peasant  farms  and  agribusinesses;  expansion  of  rural  credit,  mortgages,  and \ninsurance;  land  registration;  seed  and  cattle  breeding;  research  and  marketing;  agricultural \nextension  and  veterinary  services;  processing  and  export  development;  improved  water  and \npasture  management;  and  social  development  of  villages.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  also \nrecognizes  the  need  for  local  government  reform,  including  decentralization.  However,  the \ndelineation  of  responsibilities  between  the  central  Government  and  local  governments  is  not \nclear.  Finances  and  local  budgets  are  still  largely  centralized  and  local  governments  are \nunderfunded.  \n \n18. \nGovernment  Resolution  465  approved  the  agrarian  policy  concept  of  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic to 2010 on 22 June 2004. The main objectives of the concept include (i) providing the \ncountry\u2019s population with foodstuffs and industry with raw materials on a sustainable basis, (ii) \npreserving the environment; (iii) ensuring food safety, (iv) promoting the marketing and export of \nagricultural  and  processed  products,  and  (v)  reducing  poverty  and  undertaking  land  and \nagrarian reform and farm development. \n \n19. \nAgricultural  policy  and  the  strategy  framework  are  frequently  revised.  ADB  is  financing \nthe formulation of a new strategy to 2015 and this is expected to be completed in March 2007. \nThe  key  areas  being  addressed  include:  (i)  improved  services,  (ii)  agroprocessing  and \nmarketing,  (iii)  land  market  development,  (iv)  water  resources  management,  (v)  training  and \nresearch  and  development,  (vi)  trade  and  tax  policy,  (vii)  rural  finance,  and  (viii)  rural \ndevelopment.  \n \n20. \nDevelopment assistance to agriculture and related areas is diverse in size, focus, scope, \nand location. A large number of aid-supported activities focus on the southern regions. Projects \nrange  from  small  pilot  activities  in  selected  raions  to  large,  nationwide  programs.  These \nprograms  address  all  constraints  to  agricultural  development,  but  to  varying  degrees  and  with \nvarying levels of coordination. In recent years, efforts have been made by development partners \nto harmonize practices, and in March 2003, the Kyrgyz Republic was selected as a pilot country \nfor  harmonization,  with  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MOEF)  being  appointed  as  the \nexecuting  agency.  In  addition,  the  Government  and  its  development  partners\u2014including  the \nWorld  Bank,  ADB,  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the \nUnited  Kingdom,  and  the  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC)\u2014are \npreparing a joint country assistance strategy. The strategy is expected  to be released in early \n2007. \n \n21. \nAnnual financing of public investment by development partners in the agriculture sector \nrose from $22.81 million in 2001 to a peak of $32.07 million in 2003, and is expected to decline \nto $24.70 million in 2006.17 The key areas of assistance include agricultural strategy formulation \nand policy development (ADB, the SDC, and the World Bank); budgetary support (the European \nUnion Food Security Program); farm privatization and land reform (the World Bank, the United \nStates Agency for International Development [USAID], the SDC, the DFID, and ADB); financial \ninstitution  development  (the  World  Bank,  ADB,  German  development  cooperation  through \nDeutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  [German  Agency  for  Technical \nCooperation,  GTZ]  and  the  Raiffeisen  Foundation  for  Development  Cooperatives,  the  USAID, \n\n                                                 \n17 World Bank. 2004.

Appendix  3  provides  further  information  on  external \ndevelopment assistance.  \n \nAccording  to  the  2006  Annual  Evaluation  Review, 18  project  success  in  category  A \n22. \ncountries, including the Kyrgyz Republic, from 1990 to 1997 was 74%, above both category B \ncountries  and  average  performance  overall.  The  countries  that  performed  well  included  the \ntransition  economies.  By  contrast,  agriculture  projects  had  the  worst  outcomes  for  projects \nfinanced  by  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF),  with  only  47%  being  rated  as  successful \noverall,  but  for  irrigation  and  rural  development  projects  the  success  rate  exceeded  50%.  The \nmain  problems  identified  were  (i)  inadequate  project  design,  including  an  inadequate \nunderstanding of the problems and opportunities viewed from the perspective of beneficiaries; \n(ii) project complexity; (iii) weak institutions; (iv) limited budgets; (v) adverse impact of external \nfactors;  and  (vi)  weaknesses  in  project  administration.  Furthermore,  the  critical  factors \ncontributing to project success generally across ADB projects were (i) quality of project at entry, \n(ii) strong country ownership, (iii) flexible design and a participatory approach, (iv) ability to learn \nfrom  experience  and  incorporate  lessons  into  project  design,  (v)  good  supervision  of  project \nimplementation,  and  (vi)  strong  project  management  units  (PMUs)  and  related  oversight \ninstitutions to ensure good performance and timely delivery from contractors. \n \n23. \nThe Project is based on the AADP, which is still ongoing. ADB annual reviews continue \nto rate the AADP as satisfactory. The Government is also satisfied with the concept, approach, \nand  results  to  the  extent  that  it  has  requested  adaptation  of  the  AADP  to  three  oblasts  in  the \nsouthern  part  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Appendix  4  summarizes  details  of  progress  to  date, \nincluding key lessons. These lessons are (i) the oblast administrations do not have the capacity \nto  be  appointed  as  implementing  agencies,  but  should  be  represented  on  the  project  steering \ncommittee  (PSC);  (ii)  the  early  establishment  of  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  system  is \nessential,  and  adequate  staff  should  be  deployed  for  this  purpose;  (iii)  a  strong  management \nteam,  a  sound  financial  management  system,  transparency  and  fairness  in  staff  recruitment, \ninvestment in staff training early in the project, and sufficient international consultancy to support \nthe  PMU  during  the  first  3  years  of  the  project  are  essential;  (iv)  the  general  approach  of \ncontracting local advisory services and encouraging competition between service providers has \nimproved the quality of the services provided, more intensive investment in the quality of training \nmaterials  and  field  advisers\u2019  skills  is  needed;  (v)  the  procurement  procedure  for  the  design  of \ndrainage  and  irrigation  rehabilitation  did  not  result  in  significant  competition  given  the  limited \nnumber of design companies, and in-house design capacity is preferable; (vi) the existence of \nwell-managed,  financially  sustainable  WUAs  is  critical  to  the  rehabilitation  process  and  the \nsustainability  of  rehabilitated  systems;  (vii)  the  scale  of  technical  support  for  agribusiness \ndevelopment  was  relatively  small  in  relation  to  the  amount  of  credit  finance  available  and  the \nuptake of credit for investment in agribusiness  development was relatively small; and (viii) the \nconditions  for  obtaining  credit  from  the  KAFC  were  not  appropriate  for  all  farmers  and \nagribusinesses,  and  diversifying  the  range  of  financial  institutions  involved  in  credit  provision \nwould  provide  a  more  appropriate  credit  mechanism.  Appendix  4  explains  how  these  lessons \nhave been incorporated into the current Project.  \n \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2006. 2006 Annual Evaluation Review.

The CACILM \nis based on national programming frameworks for sustainable land management developed for \neach  of  the  five  countries,  and  the  Project  is  included  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  national \nprogramming  framework  as  a  high  priority  under  the  country's  strategy  for  addressing  land \ndegradation.  The  framework  identifies  the  need  to  strengthen  policies  and  institutions  and  to \nmake the complementary on-the-ground investments required both within the agriculture sector \nand  across  other  relevant  sectors  and  national  development  plans.  The  CACILM  is  also  a \nframework  for  generating  financing  to  support  the  identified  priorities,  and  ADB  is  leading  a \nconsortium  of  bilateral  and  multilateral  partners  to  mobilize  such  funding.  In  particular,  the \nGlobal  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  has  endorsed  a  first  phase  of  projects  amounting  to  more \nthan  $150  million  in  investments,  with  the  GEF  to  provide  $20  million  in  grant  financing.  The \nProject  is  included  in  this  framework  and  is  expected  to  receive  $2.5  million  in  GEF  grant \ncofinancing as part of the CACILM program. \n \nThe area development concept recognizes the need for balanced investment to address \n25. \nconstraints  relating  to  agricultural  production,  inputs  and  services,  infrastructure,  and  finance \nsimultaneously in a clearly targeted area. The intent is to enhance productivity and profitability in \na  more  sustainable  manner  through  a  holistic,  integrated,  and  coordinated  approach.  The \napproach  is  holistic  in  comprehensively  addressing  key  constraints,  integrated  in  terms  of \nunifying interventions in specific geographic areas, and coordinated in terms of partnership with \nother projects and outsourcing to effective local service providers. \n \nThe  Project  seeks  to  adapt  the  overall  concept  and  approach  of  the  AADP,  but  more \n26. \ninvestment  in  developing  agribusinesses,  promoting  marketing,  and  diversifying  participating \nfinancial  institutions  (PFIs)  and  the  addition  of  a  component  to  address  pasture  and  orchard \nmanagement are expected to lead to an even more successful area development project in the \nsouth.  The  Project  addresses  short-term  investment  needs  in  relation  to  credit  and  the \nrehabilitation  of  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure,  but  also  longer-term  needs  through \ninvestment in training, advisory services, and pasture management. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n1. \n\nProject Area \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Project\u2019s expected impact is region-wide adoption of improved agricultural, orchard, \n27. \nand  pasture  management  techniques.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  Project  is  a  sustainable \nincrease in land productivity and profitability.  \n \n \n \n28. \nThe  Project  is  located  in  the  three  southern  oblasts  of  Batken,  Jalalabad,  and  Osh.  Of \nthe  18  raions  in  these  oblasts,  9  were  selected  based  on  the  following  criteria:  (i)  a  large \nproportion of the oblast\u2019s arable land is located in the raion; (ii) the population is at least 60% \nrural;  (iii)  the  extent  of  crops  grown  that  are  prohibited  from  direct  investment  by  ADB  is  not \nsubstantial  (e.g.,  tobacco);  and  (iv)  the  raions  are,  as  far  as  possible,  contiguous  and  are \naccessible  year  round.  The  PSC  agreed  to  include  the  following  raions  in  the  project  area: \nBatken,  Kadamjay,  and  Leylek  in  Batken;  Bazaar  Korgon,  Nooken,  and  Suzak  in  Jalalabad; \nAravan, Kara Su, and Uzgen in Osh.  \n \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n \n\n29. \nIn addition, some aiyl okmotu and WUAs were selected for inclusion in the Project during \nthe preparation phase and the loan Fact-Finding Mission. This selection was based primarily on \nthe  need  for  rehabilitation  of  drainage  and  irrigation  systems  (Table  1).  Further  details  are \nprovided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  Based  on  the  prioritized  list  of  WUAs  eligible  for \nparticipation  in  the  Project;  about  45,000  ha  were  identified  in  27  WUAs  in  24  aiyl  okmotu \ngrouped into 12 area clusters of one or more WUAs, in the 9 target raions. However, this goes \nbeyond  the  coverage  expected  under  the  Project  of  about  28,500  ha  and  17  WUAs,  and  the \nfinal selection from the shortlisted WUAs will be carried out when project implementation starts \nand will include a detailed assessment against the foregoing criteria and submission to ADB for \nreview and approval. WUAs will not be included if their irrigation infrastructure is prone to being \naffected  by  natural  disasters  and  cannot  easily  be  protected  through  modest  expenditures  on \nprotective  infrastructure  or  if  rehabilitation  is  likely  to  have  a  serious  negative  environmental \nimpact, including the dispersal of heavy metals and other  pollutants into the water supply and \nsoils. \n \n\nTable 1: Shortlisted Aiyl Okmotu and WUAs \n \n\nNumber of Aiyl \nOkmotu \n\nNumber of Water \nUser Associations \n\nNumber of \nClusters \n\nArea  \n(hectares) \n\nOblasts  \nand Raions \n\nBatken \n     Batken      \n     Kadamjay \n     Leylek \n     Subtotal \nJalalabad \n     Bazar Korgon \n     Nooken \n     Suzak \n     Subtotal \nOsh \n     Aravan \n     Kara Su \n     Uzgen \n     Subtotal \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n4 \n2 \n9 \n\n1 \n2 \n2 \n5 \n\n3 \n4 \n3 \n10 \n24 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n4 \n2 \n10 \n\n2 \n2 \n2 \n6 \n\n4 \n4 \n3 \n11 \n27 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1 \n2 \n1 \n4 \n\n1 \n1 \n1 \n3 \n\n2 \n1 \n2 \n5 \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7,103 \n7,456 \n2,247 \n16,806 \n\n2,519 \n3,389 \n5,780 \n11,688 \n\n5,388 \n7,810 \n3,687 \n16,885 \n45,379 \n\nSource:  Meeting  with  senior  engineers  and  staff  of  the  Department  of  Water  Resources  from  Bishkek,  Batken, \n\nJalalabad, and Osh.19 September 2006, Osh. \n\nOutputs \n\n \nB. \n \n30. \nThe  Project  has  five  components,  four  technical  and  one  project  management,  with \nrelated outputs and activities. Outputs for each component are summarized below and a more \ndetailed description is provided in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n\n \n\n1. \n\nFarm Development \n\n \n \n31. \nThe  Project  will  support  agricultural  and  legal  advisory  services  by  (i)  improving  the \ncapacity  and  technical scope  of  existing  advisory  service  providers  (output  1.1),  (ii)  increasing \nthe quality and outreach of advisory services (output 1.2), (iii) facilitating access to existing legal \nservices  (output  1.3),  and  (iv)  increasing  the  availability  of  and  access  to  credit  by  farmers \n(output 1.4).  \n\n \n32. \nThe Project will assess the situation and prepare a plan for project interventions in each \nvillage  government.  This  assessment  will  (i)  be  undertaken  with  community  participation;  (ii) \nfarms,  agricultural  businesses,  and  other  agricultural \ndescribe \n\nthe  current  status  of \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\norganizations;  (iii)  identify  potential  development  opportunities  and  partner  organizations;  and \n(iv) outline a plan of Project interventions for the village government.  \n \n33. \nTo  improve  the  capacity  and  technical  scope  of  advisory  services  (output  1.1),  high-\nquality training materials will be developed to improve the technical skills of advisory staff and \ntheir capacity to deliver advice to farmers. The Project will contract national organizations with \nappropriate experience to (i) assess and, where necessary, upgrade existing training materials; \n(ii)  identify  new  technologies  to  address  farmers\u2019  needs  and  improve  the  sustainability  of \nfarming systems; and (iii) train the advisory service providers contracted under the Project in the \ndelivery of new technologies and methodologies for training small farmers. All training materials \nused by the service providers will be approved by the contracted organization and all advisory \nservice  staff  will  be  trained  in  training  techniques  for  small  farmers  before  the  delivery  of  any \ntraining.  \n \n34. \nTo  increase  the  quality  and  outreach  of  advisory  services  (output  1.2),  the  Project  will \ncontract  a  suitable  national  organization  to  set  up  farmer  field  schools  (FFSs)  to  increase  the \nfield  experience  of  skilled  trainers  in  crops  that  are  particularly  important  to  the  project  area, \nsuch as tree crops, vegetables, and cotton. These FFSs will involve three levels of participants: \nmaster  trainers,  trainers,  and  farmers.  A  master  trainer  from  the  contracted  organization  will \ntrain  16  trainers,  divided  into  8  pairs,  2  days  per  week  for  16  weeks  throughout  the  growing \nseason in year 1. Simultaneously during year 1, each pair of trainers will train up to 18 farmers \nunder  the  supervision  of  a  master  trainer  using  the  same  training  method.  FFS  trainees  will \nestablish their own demonstration plots and use these to demonstrate up to two technologies. \nFFSs  will  involve  1  day  of  training  for  farmers  each  week  throughout  the  growing  season.  In \nyear 2, the training with the same 8 pairs of trainers continues, but is less intensive and involves \nnew technologies. Trainers continue the FFS with the farmers from year 1 and an additional 18 \nnew farmers join each FFS. There will be two cycles of 2 years for FFSs.  \n \n35. \nThe Project will also finance the expansion of village advisory services to increase their \noutreach to more aiyl okmotu and more farmers within each village government and to improve \nfarmers\u2019  skills  in  crop  production  (including  tree  crops),  livestock  production,  management, \nfinance  and  income  diversification,  integrated  pest  management,  onfarm  water  management, \nand pasture management. The Project aims to create competition among the advisory service \nproviders  by  procuring  services  from  more  than  one  provider  and  providing  an  incentive  for \nimproving  services.  The  contracted  service  providers  will  provide  intensive  field  training  and \ntrain  village  advisers.  The  village  advisers  will  be  respected  successful  farmers  in  the  villages \nwho will lead groups of 10\u201315 farmers with common agricultural interests.  \n \n36. \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  access  to  legal  advisory  services  (output  1.3)  to  improve \nfarmers\u2019  understanding  of  their  legal  rights,  improve  contract  enforcement,  and  create  greater \nconfidence  in  legal  contracts  to  provide  a  more  stable  climate  for  investment.  The  Project  will \nidentify farmers\u2019 legal problems, and in cases where the Project cannot solve them, farmers will \nbe  referred  to  the  Legal  Assistance  to  Rural  Citizens  Association  of  Lawyers.  The  Project  will \nsign  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the  association  to  provide  legal  services  on  a \nretainer basis and will cover the costs of advice to farmers, but not the costs of further resolution \nof activities provided by the association, for which farmers will be required to pay. \n \n37. \nThe Project will provide funds for a credit line (output 1.4) to help farmers undertake their \ninvestment needs. The credit line will be provided to financial institutions for onlending to target \nfarmers  and  will  include  both  working  capital  and  investment  finance.  Several  financial \ninstitutions  are  expected  to  participate  in  the  Project.  The  participatory  financial  institutions \n(PFIs) will have to (i) be legally registered with the NBKR, (ii) have their accounts audited by an \ninternational audit company, (iii) adhere to the NBKR\u2019s prudential standards, and (iv) provide a \nbusiness plan that is acceptable to ADB and is updated annually. A competitive process will be \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\n \nfollowed  to  select  appropriate  PFIs  and  due  diligence  will  be  undertaken  on  all  potentially \nqualified and interested PFIs. PFIs will be required to meet the following criteria: (i) be financially \nsound;  (ii)  have  adequate  credit  and  risk  management  policies,  operating  system,  and \nprocedures; (iii) comply with prudential regulations; (iv) have acceptable corporate and financial \ngovernance  and  management  practices;  (v)  have  sound  business  objectives  and  strategies \nand/or plans; (vi) have autonomy in lending and pricing decisions; (vii) have adequate policies, \nsystems,  and  procedures  for  assessing  and  monitoring  the  impacts  of  subprojects;  and  (viii) \nhave  environmental  screening  processes  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  final  list  of  qualified \nmicrofinance institutions will be selected and agreed with ADB.20 \n \n\n2. \n\nAgribusiness Development and Marketing \n\ncooperatives  and \n\nidentified  agribusinesses.  Currently, \n\n \n38. \nThe Project will (i) increase and improve contractual arrangements between farmers and \nagribusinesses for input supply, machinery services, and wholesale and processing enterprises \n(output 2.1); (ii) improve agribusiness performance (output 2.2); (iii) increase the availability of \nand  access  to  appropriate  finance  for  agribusinesses  (output  2.3);  and  (iv)  increase  public \ninvestment in physical market infrastructure (output 2.4). \n \n39. \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  and  support  contractual  arrangements  (output  2.1),  including \nthose pertaining to domestic and export marketing, by helping farmers identify, negotiate with, \nand  conclude  equitable  contracts  with  buyers  and  enterprises  associated  with  collecting, \npreparing,  and  transporting  produce  to  buyers.  Farmers  will  also  be  given  the  knowledge  and \ninformation  needed  to  plan  their  production  for  sale  to  the  market.  The  Project  will  also  help \nfarmers  identify  strategically  important  processors,  agricultural  produce  wholesalers,  input \nsuppliers, and machinery contractors (agribusinesses).  \n \n40. \nThe  Project  will  contract  the  services  of  qualified  agencies  whose  qualifications  and \nexperience are acceptable to ADB to support the development of contracts between farmers or \nfarmers\u2019 \nthe  Agribusiness \nCompetitiveness  Center  and  the  Marketing  Development  Service  satisfy  ADB\u2019s  criteria.  The \nfocus will be on supporting existing informal marketing groups and marketing cooperatives, but \nwhere required, the Project will provide support for the organizational development of emergent \ninformal  marketing  groups.  Where  more  intensive  support  for  the  development  of  marketing \ncooperatives  is  required,  the  Project  will  provide  organizational  development  support  directly \nwith the assistance of cooperative development projects such as the GTZ-funded Development \nof  Trade  and  Service  Cooperative  Project  and  the  Raiffeisen  Foundation  for  Development \nCooperatives.  \n \n41. \nThe  Project  will  improve  agribusiness  performance  (output  2.2)  by  providing  advisory \nservices to agribusinesses serving the target farm areas. These services will involve two types \nof contracts: one for input suppliers and machinery-related services and one for processors and \nagricultural produce wholesalers. The Project proposes to contract the services of agencies with \nappropriate  qualifications  and  experience,  such  as  the  Association  of  Agribusinessmen  of  \nKyrgyzstan  and  the  Agribusiness  Competitiveness  Center.  The  advisory  services  will  make  a \nlong-term  consultancy \nto  agribusinesses  using  national,  regional,  or \ninternational consultants as necessary to provide general management support, and specifically \nto support agribusinesses in planning and managing agribusiness investments financed by the \nProject.  Consultancy  may  be  provided  to  more  than  one  business  depending  on  the  size  and \nneeds  of  the  agribusiness,  but  in  all  cases  each  consultant  will  work  with  no  more  than  three \nagribusinesses simultaneously.21 Specialist short-term consultants (e.g., processing engineers) \nmay  also  be  provided  to  supplement  the  long-term  consultants  where  specific  support  is \n\nfacility  available \n\n                                                 \n20  The credit line for agribusinesses (output 2.3) will also be channeled through PFIs meeting the same criteria. \n21 The Project recognizes that the allocation of businesses to each consultant should be organized in such a way that \n\neach consultant does not support businesses competing in the same technical or geographic area. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\nrequired or to support other agribusinesses that require shorter-term TA. Agribusinesses will be \nrequired to contribute at least 5% of the cost of consultancy fees.  \n \n42. \nThe  Project  will  increase  the  availability  of  and  access  to  appropriate  finance  for \nagribusinesses (output 2.3) by providing funds for a credit line to help agribusinesses implement \ntheir investment plans. The credit line will be provided to PFIs for onlending to agribusinesses \nand will be available primarily for investment finance, but where necessary, some funds will be \nprovided for working capital. Part of the credit line may also be used to provide alternative forms \nof  finance,  such  as  equity  investment  in  agribusinesses,  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  agreement  to  the \nterms and conditions. \n \n43. \nTo further support marketing activities under this component and to ensure that farmers \nhave  access  to  functioning  storage  and  cooling  facilities,  the  Project  will  rehabilitate  existing \nstorage and cooling facilities or construct new facilities on existing facility locations (output 2.4). \nWhere facilities remain under state ownership, the Project aims to transfer the management of \nsuch  facilities  to  the  private  sector.  In  cases  where  the  aiyl  okmotu  own  the  facilities,  prior  to \ntheir rehabilitation, the relevant village government will obtain a legally binding commitment from \nthe proposed private sector operator to (i) operate and manage the cooling and storage facility \nfollowing its rehabilitation; and (ii) lease the facility from the village government for a period of at \nleast  5  years,  with  the  option  to  purchase  the  facility  on  completion  of  the  lease  term.  The \nprivate sector operator will make lease payments to the MOEF\u2019s State Development Fund under \nan  agreement  on  commercial  terms  that  shall  provide  for  lease  payments  in  an  amount \nsufficient to cover the commercial value of the rehabilitated facility. In cases where the facilities \nare currently owned by a functional cooperative organization, the organization will enter into a \nrepayment  agreement  with  the  MOEF\u2019s  State  Development  Fund  to  repay  the  costs  of \nrehabilitation of the facility over a period of 7 years, with a grace period of 2 years, and to pay \ninterest  at  the  inflation  rate  for  the  previous  calendar  year  as  determined  by  the  National \nStatistics  Committee.  In  cases  where  the  facilities  are  currently  owned  by  a  cooperative \norganization  that  is  inoperative,  the  organization  will  be  required  either  to  transfer  ownership \nback  to  the  relevant  village  government  or  to  transfer  or  sell  the  facilities  to  a  functional \nmarketing cooperative. Rehabilitation will then be financed in the same manner as for facilities \nowned  by  a  village  government  (where  such  facilities  are  transferred  back  to  a  village \ngovernment) or as for facilities owned by a functional cooperative (where such facilities are sold \nor otherwise transferred to a functional cooperative). \n \n\nIrrigation and Drainage  \n\n3. \n \n\nThe  Project  will  cooperate  with  the  World  Bank  on  development  of  the  WUAs  (output \n\n44. \n3.1) and will directly support rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure (output 3.2). \n \n45. \nUnder  a  memorandum  of  understanding  between  the  ADB-financed  AADP  and  the \nWorld Bank-financed OIP, the latter project has established WUAs and trained members in Chui \nOblast,  including  for  systems  selected  for  rehabilitation  by  the  AADP.  This  highly  successful \ncooperation  between  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  will  continue  under  this  Project.  Based  on \nagreements  reached  between  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the  World  Bank,  a  tripartite \nagreement will be prepared defining how WUAs and oblast and raion WUA support units will be \nfurther developed and supported by all three parties. Each WUA support unit comprises a water \nmanagement  specialist,  a  WUA  development  specialist,  and  an  engineer.  The  WUA  support \nunits  provide  consultancy  and  formal  training  for  all  aspects  of  WUA  formation,  organizational \ndevelopment, financial planning, and water management.  \n \n46. \nThe  Government  currently  finances 70%  of  the  operating  costs  of  the oblast  and  raion \nWUA  support  units  through  the  DWR  budget  and  the  OIP  finances  30%.  However,  as  of \nJanuary  2007,  the  Government  will  finance  100%  of  the  operating  costs  of  the  WUA  support \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\n \nunits and the units will be completely absorbed into the DWR. Under the World Bank-financed \nWater Management Improvement Project, support for training for WUA support units and WUAs \nwill  continue.  ADB  has  agreed  with  the  World  Bank  that  the  proposed  Project  will  not  provide \nany  financing  for  the  WUA  support  units  in  the  Project  area.  Consideration  may,  however,  be \ngiven  to  providing  financial  support  to  replace  furniture,  equipment,  and  some  vehicles,  if \nnecessary, during the course of implementation. \n  \n47. \nThe Project will support the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure (output \n3.2) for selected WUAs from the 27 WUAs identified in the shortlist and expects to rehabilitate \nabout  17  WUAs  serving  about  28,500  ha  of  irrigated  land.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  onfarm \nsystems and, to a lesser extent, off-farm systems serving those WUAs. No more than 30% of \nfunds for irrigation and drainage rehabilitation will be used for off-farm rehabilitation. \n \nThe  implementation  arrangements  for  irrigation  and  drainage  rehabilitation  will  be  the \n48. \nsame  as  those  for  the  AADP  and  the  OIP,  with  minor  adjustments  to  reflect  lessons  learned. \nThese arrangements include assessing WUA milestones, preliminary rehabilitation designs, and \nestimates  of  financial  and  economic  feasibility;  having  oblast  rehabilitation  teams  (ORTs) \nprepare designs with support from a contracted design company for more difficult and complex \ninfrastructure;  and  contracting  construction  civil  works  companies  supervised  by  ORT \nengineers.  \n \nA  joint  assessment  by  the  PMU  will  be  conducted  for  each  of  the  shortlisted  WUAs  in \n49. \ncooperation with the WUA support units to assess their suitability for inclusion in the Project and \nto identify any steps that the WUAs need to take. In addition to their adherence to qualification \ncriteria,  the  assessment  will  involve  a  range  of  factors  that  may  affect  WUAs\u2019  capacity  to \nmanage a rehabilitated system. A plan will be agreed on with WUAs to resolve any outstanding \nissues that need to be addressed before their inclusion in the Project. \n \n50. \nDecisions concerning priorities, works required, and scale of investments will lie largely \nwith farmers, and the Project will be responsive to their needs. A series of meetings will be held \nfor WUA members to ensure that they understand the proposals and timetable for rehabilitation \nand the financial implications of repayment obligations for individual members. Consultation with \nWUA  members  and  management  will  continue  throughout  rehabilitation.  The  final  design  will \nfocus  on  priority  interventions  to  bring  the  system  back  to  operational  condition,  but  will  not \nnecessarily involve complete rehabilitation. However, the scale of rehabilitation will not be less \nthan what is required to ensure that the proposed design is technically, financially, economically, \nand environmentally feasible. The final design will reflect more accurate estimates of works and \ncosts and will be subject to stringent financial and economic analyses. The final design, costs, \nand expected timetable for construction will be discussed and agreed with WUA members, and \na  formal  decision  will  be  taken  to  proceed  with  the  procurement  of  a  civil  works  contractor  to \nexecute the agreed rehabilitation works.  \n \n51. \nThe  Project  will  use  the  staff  of  the  ORTs,  which  consist  of  a  design  engineer,  a \nconstruction engineer, and a draftsperson, which are currently financed by the OIP, for regular \ndesign  work  and  construction  supervision.  The  OIP  will  finance  these  teams  until  the  Project \nbecomes  effective,  estimated  to  be  March  2007,  at  which  time  the  Project  will  take  over  the \nfinancing. The Project will finance one additional design engineer for a minimum of 2 years to \naccommodate the extra design work activities and up to six university graduates to provide them \nwith  work  experience.  ADB  has  agreed  with  the  World  Bank  that  the  position  of  regional \nengineer, currently financed by the OIP will be jointly financed by the World Bank and ADB until \nMay  2008,  when  the  OIP  is  expected  to  be  completed.  After  this  date,  the  Project  will  fully \nfinance  this  engineer,  who  will  manage  the  Project\u2019s  irrigation  and  drainage  component.  In \naddition,  a  design  company  or  companies  will  be  contracted  to  provide  design  support  to  the \nORTs  for  the  more  difficult  and  complex  aspects  of  design  and  consideration  will  be  given  to \nusing a framework agreement similar to that currently practiced under the OIP. Designs will be \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\nsupervised  by  the  Project.  Final  designs  will  be  approved  by  WUA  management  following \nconsultation  with  WUA  members;  the  State  Committee  on  Environmental  Protection  and \nForestry to provide environmental clearance; and oblast technical committees, which will consist \nof  Project  staff,  oblast  DWR  staff,  WUA  representatives,  farmer  representatives,  and  the \ncompany  responsible  for  the  design.  In  addition,  an  international  irrigation  and  drainage \nengineer will undertake an external technical review of engineering designs prior to civil works \ntenders. This engineer will be part of the international consulting team and will conduct reviews \nof each design and submit comments for ADB consideration. \n  \nConstruction will be contracted out to qualified companies. Construction supervision will \n52. \nbe  undertaken  by  the  construction  engineers  in  each  ORT  and  supported  by  site  supervisors, \nwho will be permanently engaged for each construction site (one per site). \n \nAs  under  the  AADP  and  the  OIP,  WUAs  will  be  required  to  repay  25%  of  construction \n53. \ncosts under a repayment agreement to be signed before construction contracts are signed and \nwill generally finance this repayment through increased ISFs. Each WUA, with assistance from \nraion  WUA  support  unit,  will  be  required  to  prepare  a  7-year  financial  plan  that  includes \nprojections for increased ISFs sufficient to cover the 25% repayment and improved O&M. The \nterms and conditions of agreements between WUAs and the MOEF include repayment of 25% \nof the costs of onfarm irrigation and drainage rehabilitation (construction costs only, not design \ncosts)  over  a  7-year  period  from  the  date  of  completion  of  rehabilitation,  with  a  4-year  grace \nperiod;  interest  charged  on  the  amount  to  be  repaid  based  on  inflation;  and  the  amount  to  be \nrepaid defined in som. The WUAs will not bear any foreign exchange risk. \n \n54. \nAs under the AADP and the OIP, a technical credit will be made available to WUAs to \npurchase office furniture and equipment, vehicles, meters, concrete mixers, and machinery for \nO&M  of  the  rehabilitated  irrigation  systems.  The  technical  credit  will  be  limited  to  $40,000  per \nWUA,  and  100%  of  the  amount  will  be  recovered  through  a  repayment  agreement  between \nWUAs and the MOEF, similar to the repayment agreement for the rehabilitation of irrigation and \ndrainage infrastructure. \n \n\n4.  \n\nLand Improvement \n\nThe  Project  will  support  a  holistic  and  participatory  approach  to  the  sustainable  use  of \n\n \n55. \npasture lands (output 4.1) and the improvement of orchard management (output 4.2). \n \n56. \nThe  enabling  environment  for  pasture  management  at  the  national  level  is  in  need  of \nreform,  and  the  World  Bank  is  currently  undertaking  a  pilot  project  to  develop  legislation  and \nadministrative arrangements for pasture management and investment as a foundation for future \ninvestments in pasture development. The Project will collaborate with this and any future World \nBank projects, but will not conduct specific activities aimed at reform at the national level. The \nProject will design and implement pasture land interventions within the existing policy and legal \nframework, concentrating its efforts at building local capacity for planning and management.  \n \nRegulation  360  dated  4  June  2002 22  establishes  a  set  of  procedures  for  pasture \n57. \nallocation  based  on  written  plans  for  the  reallocation,  use,  and  protection  of  pastures  to  be \nelaborated  jointly  by  raion  and  village  government  officials  (article  9).  The  aim  is  to  specify \noverall use and management plans within oblasts, raions, or aiyl okmotu based on a quantitative \nassessment of available pasture areas and their forage productivity. In addition, plans are to be \ndeveloped  for  pasture  rotation,  water,  road  access,  and  infrastructure  needs.  On  the  basis  of \n\n                                                 \n22 This  description  of  the  main  elements  of  the  regulation  is  taken  from  Undeland,  Asyl.  2005.  Kyrgyz  Livestock \n\nStudy; Pasture Management and Use. World Bank. Bishkek. Unpublished report (November, p. 54).  \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n \nthese  plans,  competitive  tenders  are  to  be  organized  for  livestock  holders  who  wish  to  rent \npasture land (article 10).  \n \n58. \nTo  support  sustainable  pasture  land  management  (output  4.1),  the  Project  will  initially \nhelp  prepare  and  implement  pasture  land  management  plans  incorporating  all  three  levels  of \npastures  used  by  farmers  from  each  village  government.  Communities  will  be  mobilized  to \nensure  effective  participation  (by  both  women  and  men)  in  pasture  land  planning  and \nmanagement.  The  Project  will  explore  options  for  establishing  appropriate  community \norganizational  or  representation  mechanisms  for  ensuring  that  the  interests  of  pasture  land \nusers are adequately represented in the planning process and subsequent plan implementation. \nFor  example,  the  Project  may  help  livestock  farmers  manage  their  own  pasture  resources \nthrough the formation of pasture user associations or similar groups. Capacity development will \nbe  provided  to  aiyl  okmotu  and  community-based  user  groups  to  support  the  planning  and \nmanagement of pasture lands.  \n \n59. \nCommunity-based pasture land management plans will be prepared for pastures serving \nfarmers  in  selected  aiyl  okmotu  during  the  first  3  years  of  the  Project.  Planning  will  be \nundertaken with  the  full  participation  of  communities  in  (i) surveying  the  condition of  pastures; \n(ii)  undertaking  socioeconomic  surveys;  (iii)  preparing  pasture  boundary  maps;  (iv)  preparing \npasture  improvement  plans,  including  pasture  infrastructure  rehabilitation  plans;  and  (v) \ndeveloping  pasture  monitoring  systems.  The  pasture  land  management  plans  will  include \nexpected impacts and outcomes, leasing and allocation schemes, pasture improvement plans, \ninstitutional arrangements (including M&E systems), capacity development plans, budgets, and \nfinancial commitments.  \n \nPasture  land  improvement  plans  will  be  implemented  and  monitored  with  community \n60. \nparticipation. Pasture improvements will include (i) pasture rotation schemes, (ii) investments to \nincrease forage productivity through reseeding and weed control, and (iii) pasture infrastructure \ninvestments. Forage productivity improvements will be made through a combination of pasture \nrotation plans, revegetation of degraded pasture land, and enforcement of sustainable stocking \nrates  for  livestock.  Village  advisory  services  will  provide  improved  skills  training  in  livestock \nproduction and pasture management. \n\n  \n\nIn consultation with the community-based pasture user groups, the Project will help aiyl \n61. \nokmotu  develop  investment  plans  and  will  support  such  plans  for  the  first  4  years.  After  that \ntime,  the  income  generated  from  leasing  access  to  pastures  is  expected  to  support  plan \nimplementation. The plans will cover phased repair and construction or reconstruction of crucial \npasture infrastructure such as roads and tracks, bridges, handling facilities, and housing. \n\n \n62. \nBoth aiyl okmotu and pasture-user groups will be trained to improve their management \nand administration of pastures.  Aiyl okmotu will receive revenues from the leasing of pastures \nand  will  be  helped  to  set  up  proper  administrative  systems  for  managing  these  revenues  and \nachieving  transparency  and  accountability  in  handling  them.  The  Project  will  also  provide \ncapacity development for managing grant funds for improving pasture land infrastructure. Such \ntraining will include financial management and M&E.  \n \n63. \nThe  Project  will  develop  an  effective  monitoring  system  for  pasture  land  use.  The \nmonitoring  system  will  be  based  on  animal  production  characteristics  and  vegetation  and  soil \nerosion  criteria.  It  is  anticipated  that  monitoring  data  will  have  to  be  collated  and  analyzed  by \none  system  under  the  Project.  The  pasture  user  groups  operating  in  the  village  government \npasture areas will be responsible for routine monitoring to collect data on the state of vegetation, \npastures,  livestock,  and  infrastructure.  To  this  end,  local  service  providers  will  assist  and  train \nthe  pasture  user  groups  under  contract  to  the  aiyl  okmotu  during  their  first  4  years  after \nestablishment. Monitoring activities will be coordinated with the CACILM, which will be operating \na  sustainable  land  management  information  system  to  monitor  changes  in  pasture  land \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\nindicators  as  part  of  the  monitoring  of  overall  changes  in  land  degradation  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic.  \n \n64. \nThe  pasture  land  management  activities  will  generate  a  number  of  lessons,  and \ninformation  will  be  gathered  using  the  monitoring  system.  To  ensure  effective  sharing  of \nknowledge,  the  Project  will  develop  a  manual  on  sustainable  pasture  land  management \npractices. The first version of the manual is expected to be produced within 2 years of project \ninitiation, and it will be updated at least once as project activities generate new information. The \nadvisory services will use this manual to train pasture users. \n \n65. \nThe  Project  will  support  improvements  to  orchard  management  (output  4.2)  by  (i) \ndeveloping  improvement  plans,  (ii)  addressing  legal  restrictions,  (iii)  improving  leasing \narrangements, (iv) restocking orchards, and (v) training farmers. \n \n66. \nThe  Project  will  help  aiyl  okmotu  prepare  orchard  management  plans  to  be  completed \nwithin  3  years  of  Project  effectiveness.  Each  plan  will  (i)  identify  all  government  agencies  and \ntheir  respective  responsibilities  with  respect  to  the  plan,  (ii)  include  procedures  for  ensuring \ncommunity  participation  in  the  planning  process,  (iii)  establish  systems  and  procedures  for \nallocating  orchards  to  farmers  through  lease  arrangements  in  an  equitable  and  transparent \nmanner, (iv) include strategies for improving orchards, and (v) incorporate investment plans. \n \nThere  is  currently  a  moratorium  on  the  felling  of  trees,  which  prevents  the  responsible \n67. \nfelling of unproductive trees and restocking. The Project will work with aiyl okmotu and relevant \ngovernment agencies to identify areas where responsible felling and restocking would increase \norchard  productivity  and  to  examine  possible  systems  and  procedures  for  assessment, \napproval, and monitoring of applications for felling and restocking on a pilot basis. \n \n68. \nThe  Project  will  assist  aiyl  okmotu  to  establish  improved  long-term  agreements  with \nfarmers  for  leasing  orchards  and  to  encourage  proper  tree  management.  The  aiyl  okmotu  will \nalso  contract  private  or  forest  farm  nurseries  to  supply  tree  and  shrub  planting  materials.  Aiyl \nokmotu  will  also  contract  forest  farms  or  individuals  to  plant  new  stock  in  orchards  or  other \nareas that need to be planted. Aiyl okmotu will contract individuals or advisory services to train \nfarmers leasing those areas in tree crop management.  \n \n\n5.  \n\nProject Management \n\nADF IX Grant Component \n\n \n69. \nProject  management  will  be  undertaken  by  a  PMU.  Most  project  activities  will  be \nconducted  by  contracting  existing  institutions  to  build  up  sustainable  implementation  capacity. \nThe  Project  will  also  work  collaboratively  with  other  development  partners  to  avoid  duplication \nand  minimize  project  management  costs.  Where  national  institutional  capacity  is  limited  or \nunavailable,  international  and  national  consulting  services  will  be  employed  to  strengthen \ntechnical capacity for selected activities and project management.  \n \nC. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  grant  component  includes  financing  for  (i)  international  and  national \n70. \nconsultants; (ii) FFSs; (iii) farmer training and advisory services; (iv) pasture planning, training, \nand  management;  (v)  orchard  planning,  training,  and  management;  and  (vi)  vehicles,  office \nfurniture and equipment, communications, office support staff, and O&M costs for vehicles and \nequipment. The purposes of the grant component are to (i) train trainers and farmers; (ii) plan, \nmap,  and  invest  in  pastures;  (iii)  plan  and  invest  in  orchards;  (iv)  provide  international  and \nnational  consultants  for  farm  development,  agribusiness  advisory  services,  irrigation  and \ndrainage rehabilitation, orchard management, and project management; and (v) provide support \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \nstaff  and  related  office  expenses  for  project  management.  Appendix  5  provides  further \ninformation. \n \nD. \n \nThe  Project  is  adapting  the  concept  and  approach  of  the  AADP  to  three  oblasts  in  the \n71. \nsouth  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  It  is  taking  a  holistic,  integrated  and  coordinated  approach  to \naddress  fundamental  constraints  in  moving  agriculture  forward  and  builds  extensively  on \nlessons learned from the AADP (Appendix 4). \n \n72. \nCofinancing is anticipated from the GEF. A grant from GEF Operational Program 15 on \nsustainable land management is proposed to enhance measures to address land improvement \nthrough  a  holistic  and  integrated  approach  to  pasture  land  management  and  orchard \nimprovement. ADB will submit a request for grant financing ($2.5 million) to the GEF Council to \nfinance  additional  activities.  If  approved,  ADB  will  administer  the  GEF  grant,  in  line  with  an \nagreement between the GEF and ADB, to improve land management and generate additional \nglobal environmental benefits. GEF financing is expected to begin in 2007. \n \nE. \n \n73. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $31.23 million, including taxes and duties of \n$2.80  million,  $3.75  million  for  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  $0.52  million  in  interest \ncharges during implementation. Table 2 summarizes cost estimates by project component and \ndetailed  cost  estimates  are  provided  in  Appendix  6.  Supplementary  Appendix  C  provides \ndetailed cost tables by project component.  \n \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nTable 2: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \nA. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nBase Costa \n1.

The loan will have a 32-year term, \nincluding  a grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1% yearly  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5%  yearly  after  that,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  Financing \nAgreement. The financing plan is summarized in Table 3. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank Loan \nAsian Development Bank Grant \nGlobal Environment Facilitya \nGovernment \nWater user Associations \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n15.00 \n5.00 \n2.50 \n6.81 \n1.92 \n31.23 \n\n% \n48 \n16 \n8 \n22 \n6 \n100 \n\na  Global  Environment  Facility  funding  is  subject  to  approval  by  the  organization\u2019s  chief \n\nexecutive officer. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nThe proposed ADB loan will finance 48% of the project cost and will meet the costs of \n75. \nthe  credit  line  for  farms  and  agribusiness,  advisory  services  for  agribusinesses,  public \ninvestments  in  marketing  infrastructure,  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  rehabilitation, \nWUA  technical  credits,  WUA  support  unit  equipment,  office  equipment  and  vehicles,  training, \nworkshops  and  seminars,  M&E  surveys,  O&M  for  vehicles  and  equipment,  support  staff,  and \nutilities for project management. The proposed ADF IX grant will finance 16% of the project cost \nand  will  finance  training  of  trainers  and  farmers;  planning  and  mapping  of  and  investment  in \npastures; planning of and investment in orchards; and international and national consultants for \nfarm development, agribusiness advisory services, irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, orchard \nmanagement,  project  management,  and  support  staff  and  related  office  expenses  for  project \nmanagement.  The proposed GEF funds will finance 8% of the project cost to meet the costs of \ntraining  of  trainers,  FFSs,  and  village  advisory  services;  pasture  planning,  infrastructure  and \nimprovement,  monitoring,  and  capacity  development  for  aiyl  okmotu  and  pasture-user  groups; \ninternational  and  national  consultants  for  land  improvement;  and  equipment,  vehicles, \ncommunications,  support  staff,  workshops  and  seminars,  M&E,  staff \ntraining,  and \ncommunications  and  report  production  for  project  management.  The  detailed  proposal  for  the \nGEF grant is in Supplementary Appendix C. The Government will finance 22% of total project \ncost  through  taxes  and  duties,  support  for  WUA  support  unit  costs,  and  off-farm  irrigation  and \ndrainage  system  O&M  costs.  The  WUAs  will  finance  1.9%  of  project  cost  for  the  O&M  of  the \nrehabilitated  infrastructure  on  completion.  The  WUAs  will  also  repay  25%  of  the  cost  of \nrehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage infrastructure. \n \n76. \nADB  has  typically  sought  Board  approval  for  the  administration  of  loan  or  grant  funds \nfrom cofinanciers only when cofinancing agreements are in place. In the case of the proposed \ngrant funding from GEF, the full GEF proposal is being finalized and submitted to GEF together \nwith  this  Report.  To  avoid  any  project  delay,  the  Board  is  requested  to  approve  the \nadministration of the proposed GEF grant, in the amount of $2,500,000, which is expected to be \nobtained subsequent to the date of Board approval. Approval of the GEF grant will be reported \nto  the  Board  in  accordance  with  standard  operating  procedures.  If  GEF  does  not  approve \nfinancing,  the  farm  development  component  will  be  marginally  affected,  with  less  training  and \nfewer demonstrations; the land improvement component will be significantly reduced in scope, \nwith no remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) for pasture mapping, reduced \ninfrastructure investment in pastures, reduced training for pasture users and aiyl okmotu, and no \ninternational pasture land management or GIS specialists; and project management inputs will \nbe proportionally reduced.  \n \n77. \n \n\nDisbursements will be based on the percentages in the Financing Agreement.  \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nG. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n\nThe project management arrangements include a PSC, MAWRPI as Executing Agency, \n\n \n78. \nand the PMU and two regional offices. Appendix 7 presents the organization chart. \n \n79. \nProject  implementation  will  be  guided  by  the  PSC,  which  will  consist  of  the  MAWRPI \n(chair);  representatives  of  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office,  the  MOEF,  oblast  administrations,  the \nState Committee for Environmental Protection and Forestry, the CACILM National Council, the \nprivate  sector,  the  nongovernment  sector,  and  ADB;  the  project  manager;  and  the  project \ncoordinator.  The  PSC  will  (i)  guide  the  overall  policy  and  strategic  direction  of  the  Project,  (ii) \nguide overall project priorities, (iii) review and evaluate project performance, (iv) review audited \nproject  accounts,  (v)  select  consultants  through  the  tender  committee,  and  (vi)  facilitate  the \ncoordination  of  activities  between  the  Project  and  other  projects.  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least \ntwice  during  the  inception  period  (4  months  after  project  effectiveness)  and  at  least  every  six \nmonths after that, when the Project is well established, to review progress.  \n \n80.  MAWRPI  as  the  Executing  Agency,  will  (i)  disburse  ADB  loan  and  grant  proceeds;  (ii) \nkeep  accurate  and  duplicate  records  and  accounts  on  withdrawal  applications  and \ndisbursements under the project accounts; (iii) submit progress and other reports prepared by \nthe  PMU  to  ADB;  (iv)  ensure  timely  submission  of  the  Project\u2019s  audited  accounts  to  ADB;  (v) \nserve  as  the  focal  point  for  ADB  project  review  administration  activities;  and  (vi)  coordinate \ncommunication  and  interaction  between  ADB  and  MAWRPI,  oblast  administrations,  and  other \ncontracted and implementation partners. A project coordinator from MAWRPI will be appointed, \nbut will not be funded from the Project. The coordinator will oversee the Project and will report to \nthe MAWRPI and the PSC on major issues. \n \n81. \nThe  report  on  the  financial  management  assessment  of  the  MAWRPI  (Supplementary \nAppendix E) concluded that while MAWRPI\u2019s budgeting and financial management is improving, \nit  does  not  provide  a  basis  for  the  financial  management  of  loan  projects.  The  financial \nmanagement  assessment  recommends  the  adoption  of  the  same  financial  management \narrangements as under the AADP with some improvements based on lessons learned. The plan \nis for the Project\u2019s financial management team to be trained by the current AADP team during \nthe  initial  2  weeks  of  implementation.  The  proposed  arrangements  and  training  for  financial \nmanagement  will  provide  a  sound  basis  for  accurate  recording  and  reporting  of  financial \ninformation. \n \n82. \nThe  PMU  will  be  established  in  the  MAWRPI  and  located  in  Osh  Oblast  to  ensure \neffective  implementation  and  management  of  the  Project  and  the  appropriate  use  of  funds  to \nproduce the results anticipated under the Project. The PMU will be headed by a full time project \nmanager  who  will  report  to  the  project  coordinator,  and  will  be  staffed  with  national  and \ninternational consultants. The project manager will be informed and guided by the management \nteam,  which  will  consist  of  three  deputy  project  managers  (one  for  each  oblast),  a  financial \nmanager, a regional engineer, a procurement specialist, and an M&E manager. During project \nstart-up,  PMU  staff  will  work  with  relevant  ADB  staff  to  ensure  effective  compliance  with  ADB \nand  government  project  rules  and  procedures.  The  PMU  will  establish  regional  offices  in  both \nBatken and Jalalabad.  \n \nThe  PMU  will  essentially  be  a  contract  management  unit,  selecting,  contracting, \n83. \nmonitoring, and remunerating local service providers. The PMU will (i) ensure that the Project is \nimplemented in accordance with its design; (ii) ensure effective coordination of all activities and \nagencies involved; (iii) ensure compliance with environmental requirements and other safeguard \nmeasures; (iv) maintain appropriate accounts, including reports on withdrawal applications and \ndisbursements;  (v)  manage  procurement  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines;  (vi)  prepare \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\nquarterly progress and other reports in formats agreed on with ADB; (vii) monitor all contracts; \n(viii)  work  closely  with  selected  service  providers  to  ensure  that  methodologies,  approaches, \nand  management  systems  are  appropriate  and  deliver  the  expected  results;  (ix)  develop  an \neffective  M&E  system;  and  (x)  develop  appropriate  public  relations  procedures,  including \nbrochures and press releases.  \n \n84. \nThe tender committee will review and evaluate all procurement proposals for consulting \nservices,  civil  works,  and  goods.  The  committee  will  consist  of  the  MAWRPI  (chair); \nrepresentatives of the MOEF, the State Committee for Environmental Protection and Forestry, \nand  the  national  procurement  agency;  the  PMU  manager;  the  PMU  procurement  specialist; \nrepresentatives of each project oblast; and others as deemed necessary by the chair.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nFlow of Funds \n\n \n85. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  from  July  2007.  By  30  June  2013,  all \nwithdrawal applications must have been submitted, approved, and authorized. The closing date \nfor  disbursements  will  be  31  December  2013.  The  implementation  schedule  for  the  Project  is \nshown in Appendix 8. \n \n86. \nThe central PMU will be established prior to Project effectiveness. The regional offices in \nBatken  and  Jalalabad  will  be  established  during  the  first  year  following  project  effectiveness. \nWhile implementation will initially commence in Batken, activities are expected to commence in \nJalalabad and Osh within the first 12 months of project implementation. \n \n \n \n87. \nApart from the credit line to be provided through PFIs, all loan funds will be provided to \nthe MAWRPI in the form of a grant. The credit line will be administered under subsidiary loan \nagreements  entered  into  between  the  Government,  through  the  MOEF,  PFIs,  and  by  project \nagreements  between  ADB  and  each  PFI.  The  MOEF  has  agreed  to  use  its  Credit  Line \nManagement Unit to manage the credit line. The MOEF will lend the credit line funds directly to \nPFIs  that  have  been  licensed  by  the  NBKR.  The  MOEF  will  relend  these  funds  in  som  or  US \ndollars for periods of up to 15 years, with a 3-year grace period. The relending interest rate for \nsom  loans  will  be  a  variable  rate  based  on  the  average  inflation  rate  for  the  past  year  as \nannounced  by  the  National  Statistics  Office  and  projected  inflation  for  the  current  year  as \nannounced by the NBKR. The reference rate will be reviewed semiannually. In addition, a fixed \nmargin of 1% shall be added for administrative costs and a variable margin of no less than 1% \nto  cover  the  Government\u2019s  foreign  exchange  risks.  The  relending  interest  rate  for  loans  in \ndollars  will be  a  variable  rate  based  on  the  6-month  London  interbank  offered  rate  for  dollars. \nThe rate, formula, and actual margins charged by the PFIs shall be reviewed semiannually as \nnecessary.  A  minimum  margin  of  1%  will  be  added  to  cover  the  Government\u2019s  administrative \nand related costs. Following repayment by the PFIs, the funds will be relent to eligible financial \ninstitutions for a similar term.  \n \n88. \nFunds  under  the  credit  line  will  be  onlent  to  farmers  and  agribusinesses  as \nsubborrowers. The subloans are anticipated to provide working capital and onfarm and business \ninvestments  for  the  development  of  agricultural  production  and  of  input  supply,  machinery \nservices,  storage,  packing,  marketing,  and  related  agribusiness  and  service  enterprises.  The \nsubborrowers  will  prepare  business  plans  and  have  commercially  viable  subprojects  with \nadequate  collateral,  financial  rates  of  return,  and  demonstrated  repayment  capacity.  The \nfinancial  institutions  will  onlend  the  credit  line  to  eligible  subborrowers  under  separate  loan \nagreements  acceptable  to  ADB.  Subject  to  the  procedures  agreed  with  ADB,  the  financial \ninstitutions  will  have  full  authority  to  select  subborrowers,  approve  subloans,  and  determine \nlending  terms  in  accordance  with  their  own  credit  policies.  Subloans  to  subborrowers  may  be \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\n \nmade  in  som  or  dollars.  The  lending  arrangements  from  financial  institutions  to  subborrowers \nwill  be  reviewed  on  a  regular  basis,  as  required,  and  the  arrangements  will  be  adjusted  if \nnecessary. ADB will approve all subloans exceeding $20,000 and the first five subloans for each \nfinancial institution before disbursement by any such financial institution. All PFIs will submit a \nquarterly loan portfolio report and an annual external audit report to ADB by 30 June each year. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n89. \nAll ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  finance  the  procurement  of  vehicles,  materials,  and \nequipment as described in the procurement plan (Appendix 9). Contracts for civil works valued \nat  $1  million  equivalent  or  more  and  contracts  for  goods  and  services  valued  at  $0.5  million \nequivalent or more, will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts \nfor  civil  works  valued  at  less  than  $1  million  equivalent  may  follow  ICB,  national  competitive \nbidding (NCB), or limited international bidding as determined by the particular circumstances of \nthe  contract  package.  Contracts  for  goods  and  services,  valued  at  less  than  $0.5  million \nequivalent  may  follow  NCB  or  limited  international  bidding  as  determined  by  the  particular \ncircumstances  of  the  actual  package.  Contracts  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may \nfollow the shopping procedure. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Policy on Anticorruption (1998, \nas amended to date) will be included in all documents during the bidding for and implementation \nof the Project. \n \n90. \nBefore  the  start  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  Any \nnecessary modifications to or clarifications of the Government\u2019s procedures will be documented \nin the procurement plan. \n \n91. \nFor the procurement of goods and services to be financed with the subloans to farmers \nand  agribusinesses,  each  PFI  will  ensure  that  procurement  procedures  are  appropriate  under \nthe  circumstances,  are  in  accordance  with  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB,  and \nconform to ADB\u2019s Policy on Anticorruption.  \n \n92. \nA  memorandum  of  understanding  will  be  agreed  on  between  the  Project  and  the \nmanagement of the OIP and the Water Management Improvement Project for the development \nof WUAs and the initial services of the ORTs. \n \n93. \nThe rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure will employ separate contracts \nfor design and for civil works construction under NCB. Under the AADP and the OIP, more than \n10  companies  have  already  been  prequalified.  The  prequalified  civil  works  contractors  may \nparticipate  in  new  bidding  provided  their  qualifications  are  evaluated  again  as  part  of  bid \nevaluations.  If  new  firms  wish  to  qualify  to  tender,  then  a  postqualification  procedure  can  be \nadopted, whereby the criteria for qualifying will be included in the bidding documents, the lowest \nbid  will  be  evaluated,  and  if  it  does  not  meet  the  criteria  the  qualifications  of  the  next  lowest \nbidder  will  be  assessed.  In  addition,  the  bidding  document  and  the  draft  contract  for  the  first \ndesign  contract  and  the  first  civil  works  contract  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval. \nThereafter, it is proposed to give approval following the awarding of contracts.  \n \n94. \nAdvance action is required for consulting services for project implementation to establish \nthe  PMU,  including  engaging  the  project  manager,  financial  management  specialist,  and \nprocurement specialist. Retroactive financing of $50,000 equivalent from the grant is necessary \nto cover expenditures for activities incurred prior to loan and grant effectiveness, but not earlier \nthan a maximum period of 12 months prior to the date of signing the Financing Agreement. The \nadvance recruitment of consultants would be carried out in conformity with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  Government  has  been \nadvised that approval of early recruitment of consultants does not commit ADB to approving or \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n21\n\notherwise  financing  the  Project.  Advance  action  would  enable  early  preparation  of  draft \ndocuments  for  contracting  various  services  required  under  the  Project,  and  would  require  that \nthe Government agree to finance the PMU and its staff before loan and grant effectiveness.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nThe  Project  will  provide  2,655  person-months  of  consulting  services,23 consisting  of  96 \n95. \nperson-months of international consultants (Appendix 10) and 2,559 person-months of national \nconsultants. The international consultants and their length of service (in person-months, shown \nin  parentheses)  are  as  follows:  team  leader  (27),  M&E  specialist  (10),  gender  and  community \ndevelopment  specialist  (4),  farm  and  agribusiness  development  specialist  (19),  irrigation  and \ndrainage  engineer  (9),  pasture  management  specialist  (14),  GIS  specialist  (3),  orchard \nmanagement specialist (5), and unallocated short-term consultants (5). National consultants and \nthe  length  of  their  service  (in  person-months,  shown  in  parentheses)  are  as  follows:  project \nmanager  (72),  deputy  project  managers  (216),  financial  manager  (72),  accountants  (210), \nprocurement  specialist  (69),  lawyer  (69),  M&E  manager  (69),  senior  sociologist  (69), \nenvironmental  monitoring  specialist  (69),  M&E  specialist  (69),  regional  engineer  (48), \ndraftspeople  (90),  design  supervisors  (180),  construction  supervisors  (144),  site  supervisors \n(348),  trainee  engineers  (144),  senior  farm  development  specialist  (69),  farm  development \nspecialists  (138),  senior  agribusiness  development  specialist  (69),  civil  engineer  (69),  senior \npasture  management  specialist  (69),  pasture  management  specialists  (138),  and  orchard \nmanagement specialist (69). In addition, the Project will employ community coordinators (1,224 \nperson-months).  The  international  and  national  consultants  will  provide  project  support  and \ncapacity  development  for  advisory  services  in  agriculture  and  agribusiness,  irrigation  and \ndrainage, land improvement practices, and project management (including M&E).  \n \n96. \nSuitably qualified local service providers will be contracted for the provision of improved \ntraining  materials  and  training  of  advisory  service  providers;  the  establishment  of  FFSs,    and \nvillage advisory services to farmers; legal advice for farmers; marketing support and contractual \narrangements between farmers and agribusinesses, and agribusiness advisory services; village \ngovernment pasture plans, GIS work, and pasture mapping. These contracts will be under NCB. \nHowever, where it is established that only one potential contractor has the requisite experience, \nthe services will be procured under direct selection. \n \n97. \nThe  international  and  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  consulting  firms,  full  technical  proposals,  and \nquality- and cost-based selection. Detailed terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n98. \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Anticorruption  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government \nand  the  MAWRPI.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption are included in the loan and grant \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by \nADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  specify  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  of  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n                                                 \n23 This does not include 1,224 person-months of community coordinators who will be nominated by communities and \n\nwork on a part-time basis. \n\n \n\n\f 22 \n\n \n\n99. \nIn  relation  to  the  Project,  the  Government  will  ensure  the  disclosure  of  Project-related \nprocurement  actions,  including  consulting  services  contracts  and  the  procurement  of  major \nequipment and civil works, in local newspapers and on the internet. Such disclosed information \nwill  include,  among  other  matters,  the  list  of  participating  bidders;  the  winning  bidder;  a \nreference  to  the  tender  procedures  adopted;  the  amount  of  the  contract  awarded;  and  the \ngeneral  terms  and  specifications  of  the  goods,  works,  or  services  procured.  In  addition,  the \neffective financial management arrangements under the AADP will also be introduced into the \nProject, including direct payments by ADB for  ICB contracts, and inclusion of the international \nconsultant  team  leader  as  an  observer  on  the  tender  committee,  and  national  staff  selection \nprocedures. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n100.  The  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  and  grant  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  For  consulting  services  and \nequipment  following  ICB  procedures,  loan  and  grant  funds  will  be  disbursed  through  direct \npayment. For civil works following NCB procedures and small expenditures related to the PMU, \nreimbursement and imprest fund procedures will be applied. The MAWRPI will open two imprest \naccounts,  one  for  the  loan  funds  and  one  for  the  grant  funds.  These  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished and managed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial deposit \nin  the  loan  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  estimated  expenditures  for  6  months  of  project \nimplementation  or  10%  of  the  loan,  whichever  is  less.  The  initial  deposit  in  the  grant  imprest \naccount will not exceed estimated expenditures for 6 months of project implementation or 10% \nof the grant, whichever is less. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be applied when \nreimbursing  eligible  project  outlays  and  liquidating  and  replenishing  the  imprest  accounts  for \nindividual  payments  of  up  to  $50,000.  The  MAWRPI  will  submit  requests  for  replenishment  to \nADB.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n101.  The  MAWRPI  will  maintain  project  accounts  acceptable  to  ADB,  through  the  PMU, \naccording to the provisions of the Financing Agreement and ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial \nGovernance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB.24 The  MAWRPI,  on \nbehalf  of  the  Government  and  through  the  PMU,  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts \nthat  will  allow  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  out  of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds,  and \ngovernment  financing  to  be  identified  and  its  use  to  be  disclosed,  following  sound  accounting \nprinciples. The accounts will show total expenditures by category for each project component. \nThey will record (i) amounts spent by the MAWRPI, (ii) amounts by project component; and (iii) \nand amounts by loan and grant financing.  \n \n102. \nIndependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  these  accounts  and  records  yearly. \nWithin 6 months of the close of the financial year, certified copies of the audit report, together \nwith the auditor\u2019s opinion, will be submitted in English to the Government and ADB. The audit \nreports  will  include  a  management  letter  and  a  separate  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest \naccounts  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedure.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that \ndelays  in  the  submission  of  audited  financial  statements  may  result  in  the  suspension  of  loan \nand  grant  disbursements  by  ADB.  For  the  external  audit  of  accounts,  the  loan  proceeds  may \nfinance  the  services  of  private  sector  auditors  and  the  translation  of  their  reports  into  English \nprovided that (i) the auditors are qualified, capable, and acceptable to ADB; and (ii) the auditors \nare recruited in a manner acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n                                                 \n24  ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Government and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \n\nManila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n23\n\n103.  The  PFIs  will  be  required  to  maintain  separate  project  accounts  for  the  funds  spent \nunder the Project. They must also maintain their overall accounts, audits, and financial status as \nrequired  by  the  NBKR  and  ADB.  The  PFIs\u2019  annual  accounts\u2014comprising  balance  sheets, \nincome  statements,  and  fund  flow  statements  at  a  minimum\u2014must  conform  to  international \nfinancial  accounting  standards.  The  annual  accounts  and  project  accounts  will  be  audited  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Copies  of  the  accounts  and  audit  reports,  together \nwith the auditor\u2019s opinion and management letter, will be submitted to ADB in English within 6 \nmonths of the close of each financial year.  \n \n104.  The  MAWRPI,  through  the  PMU,  will  submit  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to  ADB.  The \nreports will indicate the progress made, the problems encountered, the steps taken to remedy \nthe problems, and a program of activities along with expected progress during the remainder of \nthe  implementation  period.  The  reports  will  also  incorporate  project  performance  monitoring \ndata and all relevant financial data. The reporting system will focus on outcomes, efficiency, and \nquality and will be consistent with international and local reporting standards, as well as with the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  The  MAWRPI  will  also  provide  other  reports \nand  information  relating  to  the  Project  as  ADB  may  reasonably  request.  Within  6  months  of \nproject  completion,  the  MAWRPI,  through  the  PMU,  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to \nADB  that  includes  information  on  project  implementation,  use  of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds, \nand accomplishments in relation to the Project\u2019s outcome and impact.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n105.  To  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  progress  in  achieving  the  planned  outputs  and  outcome,  the \nPMU  will  establish  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  within  6  months  of  project \neffectiveness.  During  project  inception,  a  matrix  of  subindicators  that  substantiate  the  core \nperformance  indicators  shown  in  Appendix  1  will  be  developed  by  the  PMU  in  a  participatory \nmanner.  Where  feasible,  community-based  monitoring  mechanisms  will  be  developed  to \nstrengthen  participation  and  community-level  decision  making.  The  performance  monitoring \nsystem will be presented to the PSC for verification. Baseline data for the agreed indicators will \nbe  gathered  and  will  be  updated  every  6  months.  These  data  will  be  reported  to  other \ndevelopment  partners,  stakeholders,  and  the  public.  During the  midterm  review,  the  indicators \nwill be validated and may be modified to reflect project performance more accurately. \n \n106.  The GEF-financed activities will require monitoring, evaluation, and reporting to CACILM \nand  the  GEF.  Information  from  the  project  monitoring  systems  will  feed  into  the  CACILM \nnational  M&E  system,  which  will  cover  all  CACILM  projects  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  will \ntarget  four  types  of  information:  (i)  land  degradation  and  sustainable  land  management \nindicators  for  the  design  and  monitoring  framework;  (ii)  compliance  with  environmental  and \nsocial  safeguards  that  may  be  prescribed  by  the  cofinancing  agreements  of  the  Strategic \nPartnership  Agreement  members; 25  (iii)  project  implementation,  including  the  recording  and \ntracking  of  work  plan  progress,  all  project  inputs,  and  all  activities;  and  (iv)  project  finances, \nincluding annual disbursements, contracts awarded, and annual audited financial statements. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n107.  Semiannual  reviews  will  be  conducted  during \nfew  years  of  project \nimplementation  until  ADB  determines  that  an  annual  review  will  be  sufficient  for  effective \n\nfirst \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n25 Strategic  Partnership  Agreement  for  United  Nations  Convention  to  Combat  Drought  and  Desertification \nImplementation  in  the  Central  Asian  Countries.  Current  members  are  ADB,  the  Canadian  International \nDevelopment  Agency,  the  United  Nations  Convention  to  Combat  Desertification  Project  of  the  GTZ,  the  Global \nMechanism, the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas, the International Fund for Agriculture \nDevelopment,  the  SDC,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  the  United  Nations  Environment \nProgramme, and the World Bank. \n\n \n\n\f 24 \n\n \nadministration  and  implementation.  In  addition  to  these  regular  reviews,  a  comprehensive \nreview of the Project will be carried out jointly by the MAWRPI and ADB after 18 months and a \nmidterm review after 3 years of implementation. These reviews will, among other things, assess \nthe  overall  performance  of  the  Project  and  the  need  for  changes  in  its  design  and \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \n108.  At  least  one  review  a  year  by  ADB  should  include  capacity  on  the  review  team  to \nindependently review the implementation of activities involving special technical skills, such as \nengineering  for  the  irrigation  and  drainage  rehabilitation  component  and  pasture  and  livestock \nmanagement for the land improvement component.  \n \n\nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses26 \n\n \nA. \n \n109.  The  Project  will  increase  household  incomes  through  a  sustainable  increase  in  farm \nproductivity  and  profitability.  These  benefits  are  expected  to  derive  from  the  integrated \nimplementation  of  activities  to  generate  increased  knowledge  and  better  farming  practices, \nincreased value added and improved performance of agribusinesses, reduced waterlogging and \nsalinity  and  reclaimed  lands  from  rehabilitated  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  and \nimproved  water  management,  and  improved  planning  and  management  of  pasture  lands  and \norchards  and  reduced  land  degradation.  The  Project  will  benefit  an  estimated  population  of \n158,500 in 31,000 households in 17 aiyl okmotu farming 28,500 of irrigated land, 15,000 ha of \nrainfed land, and access to 93,000 ha of village pastures and an undefined area of midlevel and \nhigh mountain pastures in the three oblasts. The beneficiaries will include households that have \nan allocated land share as well as households who have only a household plot, but no allocated \nland share. About 58% of the beneficiaries live below the poverty line.  \n \nB. \n \n110.  The  Project  benefits  include  both  quantifiable  and  nonquantifiable  benefits.  The \nquantifiable  benefits  include  an  increase  in  yields,  a  reduction  in  the  area  of  wheat  and \nsunflowers  required  to  meet  home  consumption  requirements,  and  a  diversion  of  this  land  to \nincreased  forage  and  cash  crop  production.  The  nonquantifiable  benefits  not  included  in  the \nanalysis  include  reduced  flooding  of  settlements  and  household  plots  from  improved  drainage \nand multiplier effects in upstream and downstream sectors resulting from the integrated nature \nof  the  project.  The  analyses  were  undertaken  for  two  scenarios: scenario  A  in  which  livestock \nnumbers is assumed to increase, and scenario B in which no increase in livestock numbers is \nassumed.  \n \n111.  To  facilitate  the  analyses,  a  representative  farm  in  lowland  areas  is  assumed  to  have \n0.92 ha of irrigated land, 0.49 ha of rainfed land,27 and access to village pastures. The economic \nlife of the Project is assumed to be 20 years, with a 6-year implementation period. The analysis \ncompares without and with project scenarios over a 20-year period.  \n \n \n \n112.  The  Project  is  financially  viable  for  lowland  farmers,  yielding  a  net  present  value  of \nincremental  benefits 28  to  all  farmers  of  $36.22  million  or  $828  per  ha.  Gross  margins  are \n                                                 \n26  See Supplementary Appendix F for further information on the financial and economic analysis.  \n27 Based on average farm areas in shortlisted aiyl okmotu. \n28 The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  cannot  be  calculated  for  the  individual  farm.  The  farm  pays  increased  ISFs, \nwhich are paid to the WUA that then contributes to the repayment of the 25% of the cost of onfarm irrigation and \ndrainage  rehabilitation.  Farmers  do  not  make  the  capital  investment  directly  themselves.  Consequently  there  are \nno negative net incremental benefits in any year, and so the financial internal rate of return cannot be calculated. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n1. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n25\n\nestimated to increase from $512 per ha to $720 per ha and increased net margins from $352 \nper  ha  to  $518  per  ha.  Under  scenario  B,  without  livestock  benefits,  the  net  present  value  is \n$635 per ha.  \n \n113.  Farmers\u2019 cash flow will also improve, with an annual cash margin estimated to increase \nfrom $314 per ha to $400 per ha. However, higher working and investment requirements under \nthe Project increase household borrowing from $122 to $155 per ha and to $377 in year 3 for \nadditional  livestock  purchases.  Farmers  are  able  to  generate  more  than  sufficient  incremental \ncash  revenue  to  meet  the  borrowing  repayments.  Under  scenario  B,  without  livestock \npurchases, household  borrowing  requirements  increase  from  $122  per  ha  to  $156  per  ha  and \nfarmers\u2019 cash flow is adequate to meet these repayments. \n \n114.  Annual irrigation scheme O&M costs during implementation are assessed at about $0.85 \nmillion  per  year  at  the  end  of  the  implementation  period,  while  both  O&M  and  debt  servicing \ncosts amount to about $1.3 million. An assumed increase in existing ISF levels of 47% (cash of \n$24.80  plus  labor  equivalent  to  $37.22  per  hectare  payments,  and  an  assumed  90  percent \ncollection  rate,  will  yield  revenues  for  WUAs  of  $1.56  million).  This  will  be  sufficient  to  fully \nfinance  O&M  costs  and  WUAs\u2019  overheads.  Financial  management  of  ISFs  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the WUAs. The key issues in ensuring the WUAs\u2019 financial sustainability will be \n(i) the level of ISFs charged per ha, and (ii) the collection rate of ISFs achieved by the WUAs \nfrom member farmers. Both these factors have been analyzed. If the ISF cash component is set \nat Som1,000 per ha (it is currently around Som230), WUAs can afford the O&M costs (Som600 \nper ha) and build enough cash reserves to fund a major O&M that will be required in 15 years to \nmaintain full operational viability. In addition, the WUAs will need to recover at least 90% of all \nfees charged to ensure financial viability over time. Anything less than 90% will result in financial \ndeficits that will accumulate quickly. For example, if the collection rate drops to 80%, the WUAs \ncould expect to be more than $5 million in debt within 10 years of project commencement. The \nmounting WUA debt and/or failure to maintain the irrigation investment will result in wastage of \nthe Government\u2019s initial capital investment.  \n \n115.  Based on the assumptions with respect to land use, yields, prices, costs, input use, and \nhome consumption, farmers will enjoy a considerable improvement in their cash incomes. The \nanalysis  of  farm  household  cash  flow  indicates  that  farmers  will  be  able  to  meet  their  ISF \nobligations to the WUAs. With the Project, ISFs as a percentage of farms\u2019 variable costs remain \nlow at less than 2%. The cash flow analysis demonstrates farmers\u2019 ability to pay; nevertheless, \nit  will  be  the  farmers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  increased  ISFs  and  the  WUAs\u2019  ability  to  enforce \npayment that will be critical to the WUAs\u2019 financial viability.  \n \n \n \n116.  For the economic analysis, a shadow exchange rate of Som40.30 to $1.00 was used. All \ncosts were expressed in constant 2006 prices. Economic values for cotton and for urea fertilizer \nwere  calculated  using  border  parity  prices.  A  shadow  wage  rate  conversion  factor  of  0.6  was \nused because underemployment is significant in the project area and much of the workforce is \nunderskilled. \n \n117.  The  Project  is  expected  to  generate  net  incremental  benefits  with  an  economic  net \npresent value of $31.2 million, an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 37%, and a benefit-\ncost ratio of 4.06 under scenario A. Of the total incremental benefits, 36% can be attributed to \ncrops  and  64%  to  livestock.  Scenario  B  demonstrates  that  the  Project  remains  economically \nviable without any increases in livestock numbers, with an economic net present value of $12.3 \nmillion,  an  EIRR  of  23%,  and  a  benefit-cost  ratio  of  2.53,  with  crops  accounting  for  56%  of \nincremental benefits and livestock for 44%. \n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f 26 \n\n \n118.  The  sensitivity  analyses  examined  increased  cost  or  decreased  benefit  scenarios.  The \nProject  is  economically  robust  under  scenario  A,  and  less  robust  but  still  economically  viable \nunder scenario B. The EIRR is most sensitive to a reduction in crop and livestock prices of 25% \nand  a  delay  in  production  response  for  2  years,  with  the  EIRR  falling  to  22%  and  24%, \nrespectively. The EIRR has a low sensitivity to a decrease in the area under improved cropping, \na  decline  in  yields,  an  increase  in  input  prices,  and  an  increase  in  investment  costs,  with  the \nEIRR remaining over 30% in all cases. For scenario B, the Project remains economically viable \nat EIRRs of 15\u201317% except for a 25% reduction in crop and livestock prices, which results in an \nEIRR of 11%.  \n \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis \n\n3. \n \n\n119.  A poverty impact analysis indicates that about 39% of project benefits will go to the poor. \nThe Project will also bring improved social benefits to the beneficiaries. The summary poverty \nreduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  11.  Potential  beneficiaries  fall  into  two  groups:  (i) \nthose  who  have  sufficient  land  and  financial  resources  to  reap  the  full  benefits  of  improved \naccess  to  the  irrigation  water  and  drainage,  inputs,  pastures,  credit,  advisory  services,  and \noutput markets resulting from Project investments; and (ii) those who are very poor and who do \nnot  own  allocated  land  but  may  rent  land  or  own  a  household  plot  only,  who  do  not  have \nresources or access to finance to benefit from the Project to the same extent as other farmers, \nand who are less willing to take the risks associated with making agricultural investments. \n \n120.  The  Project  will  undertake  measures  to  include  the  poor  and  vulnerable  farmers  in \nproject benefits. Such measures will include (i) targeting families that only have household plots; \n(ii) increasing the technical scope of advisory services to include topics that correspond to areas \nwhere  poor  farmers  with  limited  resources  have  a  comparative  advantage,  such  as  fruit  and \nvegetable cultivation; and (iii) including in contracts with service providers for the promotion of \nvillage  adviser  services  a  requirement  that  consulting  services  target  poor  farmers  who  have \nfew resources, as well as nonpoor farmers. These contracts will also require that female farmers \nhave access to advisory services from village advisers. \n \nC. \n \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n121.  ADB  has  categorized  the  Project  as  category  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE) has been prepared. The Project is unlikely to cause any significant environmental impact. \nPotential  impacts,  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  and  capacity-building  activities,  and \nscheduling  and  reporting  requirements  are  presented  in  an  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  plan  (EMP).  The  EMP  clearly  delineates  institutional  responsibilities  and  provides \ncost estimates. The monitoring program for the irrigation and drainage component includes cost \nprovisions  for  regular  sampling  of  surface  water  quality  in  the  irrigation  intake  of  and  the \ndrainage  outlet  from  each  WUA  area.  The  EMP  is  to  be  revised,  as  necessary,  during  the \ninception  stage  of  project  implementation.  Individual  designs  for  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage infrastructure (and other subprojects with a works element) are to be submitted to the \nappropriate  raion  or  oblast  department  of  environmental  protection  for  review.  These  designs \nshould include a site-specific environmental mitigation plan that is based on generic guidelines \nprovided  in  the  IEE,  which  sets  out  environmental  safeguards  and  mitigation  measures  to  be \nincorporated  in  tender  documentation  for  design  and  works  contracts.  The  Project  site \nsupervisors  and  the  M&E  team  will  monitor  compliance  with  these  safeguards  and  mitigation \nmeasures,  which  will  be  subject  to  inspection  by  the  State  Committee  for  Environmental \nProtection and Forestry. Supplementary Appendix G provides more information on the summary \nIEE and Supplementary Appendix H provides more information about the IEE.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n27\n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \n \n122.  The  Project  will  only  involve  the  rehabilitation  of  existing  structures,  such  as  irrigation \ncanals,  drainage  channels,  small  pasture  infrastructure  (e.g.,  bridges),  and  small  marketing \nfacilities (e.g., cooling and storage facilities), and excludes any new construction. No works will \nbe carried out during cropping seasons to avoid damage to crops. Therefore no land acquisition \nor displacement is envisaged.  \n \n \n \n123.  The three southern oblasts are dominated by the two main ethnic groups, Kyrgyz (70%) \nand  Uzbeks  (27%),  with  Osh  having  a  higher  Uzbek  population  than  the  two  other  oblasts. \nMinority  groups  include Russians  (1%);  Tajiks  (0.6%);  and  others  such  as  Tartars,  Turks,  and \nUighurs, but they live mostly in cities. Experience from ongoing programs by other development \npartners  shows  that  discrimination  in  project  activities  based  on  ethnicity  is  unlikely.  Conflicts \nabout  water  allocation  occur  across  the  border  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic-and  Uzbekistan, \nbut  typically  not  within  the  same  community  across  different  ethnic  groups.  Therefore  an \nindigenous peoples development plan will not be necessary. However, the Project\u2019s community \nparticipation plan (Appendix 12) will ensure that information about the services provided by the \nProject will be widely distributed among community members and that all ethnic groups will be \ngiven a fair chance to select community leaders to represent them.  \n \nD. \n \n\nCommunity Participation and Gender \n\n1. \n\nParticipation \n\n \n124.  The Project has been prepared through a series of consultations with key stakeholders. \nIn addition to a series of focus group discussions with male and female community members in \nthe  proposed  project  areas,  a  number  of  meetings  have  been  organized  with  government \nofficials  and  WUA  support  unit  staff  regarding  the  criteria  for  WUA  selection.  The  three \nworkshops  held  in  Batken,  Jalalabad,  and  Bishkek  in  February  2006  involved  representatives \nfrom farming households, credit unions, agriculture and agribusiness advisory service providers, \nlocal  and  national  governments,  NGOs,  and  development  partners.  The  needs  of  farmers \nexpressed  through  their  participation  in  the  workshops  have  been  integrated  into  the  project \ndesign. These workshops and other consultative processes also highlighted (i) the importance \nof  the  transparent  selection  of  representatives  from  farmer  groups  and  communities  to \nparticipate  in  the  agriculture  training  and  other  opportunities  provided  by  the  Project,  (ii)  the \ncentrality  of  community  mobilization  through  awareness  raising  and  information  campaigns  for \nall  project  components,  and  (iii)  the  need  for  participatory  M&E  of  WUAs\u2019  performance  and  of \nnatural resource management. These aspects have been highlighted in the Project\u2019s community \nparticipation and gender action plans (Appendix 12). A participatory approach at the community \nlevel is crucial to the Project\u2019s success to prevent or reduce any conflicts about water, land, and \nthe allocation and management of other natural resources. \n \n \n \n125.  Women  in  the  south  account  for  70%  of  the  agricultural  labor  force.  However,  their \nrepresentation  and/or  opportunities  in  agricultural  extension  services,  inputs,  processing, \nmarketing support, and decision making related to irrigation and natural resource management \nare  marginal.  During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  of  the  six  WUAs  visited,  five  had  no  women \ncouncil member, and one had one woman out of five members. The gender balance in training \nof  trainers  activities  is  also  skewed.  Even  under  current  Rural  Advisory  Service  training  in  the \narea  where  explicit  emphasis  was  placed  on  gender  equality  and  on  addressing  women\u2019s \nneeds, only 25% of the village advisers trained were women. Other service providers that do not \n\nGender  \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f 28 \n\nProject Risks and Sustainability \n\n \npay explicit attention to gender issues have a much lower participation rate by women farmers. \nFurthermore,  according  to  customary  law,  divorced  women  and  daughters  who  are  married \nhave no rights to land ownership in the case of divorce, while no such discrimination exists in \nwritten law.  \n \n126.  The experience of the ongoing AADP indicates that explicit attention to making sure that \nopportunities  are  equally  available  to  both  men  and  women,  looking  at  the  impacts  of \ninterventions separately by gender, and collecting and monitoring data disaggregated by gender \nare crucial in ensuring that the Project\u2019s benefits accrue to both men and women. The Project \nwill  implement  gender-focused  activities  (Appendix  12)  that  include  the  following:  (i)  specific \nprovisions  for  a  gender  balance  in  the  number  of  trainers  trained  and  in  the  types  of  training \nprovided to address the needs of women specified in the performance-based contract with the \nagriculture training service provider; (ii) information provided to women about the availability of \nlegal advisory services, including information related to problems with land ownership specific to \nwomen;  (iii)  disaggregation  of  key  input,  output,  and  outcome  indicators  by  gender,  wherever \nappropriate; (iv) encouragement of women through a community mobilization process to take on \npositions as village-level leaders and other representative positions in WUAs to be monitored by \nthe WUA support units; and (v) inclusion of gender and community development specialists in \nthe PMU.  \n \nE. \n \n127.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  sets  out  a  comprehensive  list  of \nrisks and assumptions for the Project.  \n \n128.  The Project is expected to significantly improve both the financial sustainability of target \nhouseholds  as  demonstrated  by  household  cash  flows  and  the  environmental  sustainability  of \nthe  farming  system.  This  will  come  about  through  a  shift  in  cropping  to  include  higher-value \ncrops,  including  forage  crops,  in  a  more  balanced  crop  rotation  (as  far  as  possible  within  the \nconstraints  of  small  land  plots).  This  will  be  brought  about  by  improved  pastures  and  more \nproductive  use  of  degraded  lands  as  a  result  of  investments  in  WUAs,  advisory  services, \nagribusinesses,  aiyl  okmotu,  and  pasture  user  groups,  which  are  designed  to  bring  about  the \nfinancial sustainability of all these organizations as far as possible. \n \n129.  The investment in WUA development aims to establish sustainable WUAs that (i) have \nadequate skills to plan for O&M of rehabilitated systems, (ii) can generate sufficient income from \nISFs  to  finance  annual  O&M  and  repayment  of  25%  of  the  cost  of  rehabilitation  construction, \nand (iii) can allocate water more efficiently. The 5-year financial and O&M plans prepared by the \nWUAs  are  intended  to  ensure  that  these  objectives  are  achievable.  There  is  a  moderate  risk \nthat the collection of ISFs by the WUAs will be poor and that some WUAs may  find it socially \nunacceptable to raise ISFs. If these risks materialize, the result is likely to be nonrepayment of \nthe 25% of funds to the Government rather than the collapse of WUAs depending on how the \nMOEF\u2019s State Development Fund enforces repayment.  \n \n130. \nIn  their  current  form,  the  farm  advisory  services  are  highly  dependent  on  finance  from \ndevelopment  partners  and  are  not  financially  self-sustainable.  The  services  are  likely  to  be \nrationalized  over  the  coming  years,  with  a  move  away  from  training  a  large  number  of  small \nfarmers  to  training  village  advisers,  that  is,  successful  farmers  who  will  eventually  sell  their \nservices  to  other  farmers  as  independent  advisers  or,  in  a  limited  number  of  cases,  find \nemployment  as  advisers  with  cooperatives  or  agribusinesses.  Competition  between  service \nproviders  partly  brought  about  by  the  opportunity  to  bid  for  contracts  such  as  those  under  the \nAADP will help drive rationalization of the farm advisory services. The key to achieving financial \nself-sufficiency  is  an  improved  quality  of  services,  which  the  Project\u2019s  farm  advisory  service \ninterventions seek to achieve. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n29\n\n131.  The Project will invest in the rehabilitation of storage and cooling facilities. The Project \ndesign  recognizes  the  need  for  financial  sustainability  of  these  facilities  by  requiring  that  (i)  in \ncases where facilities are owned by local governments, operation of the facilities is transferred \nto private sector operators through a lease agreement with an option to purchase the facilities \nupon  the  expiration  of  the  lease  term;  and  (ii)  private  sector  operators  provide  cash  flow \nprojections  for  the  facilities  and  investment  appraisals  demonstrating  investments\u2019  financial \nviability and sustainability. \n \n132.  The  pasture  land  management  plans  will  include  financial  projections  for  each  of  the \ninfrastructure investments to be financed under Project grants that show the costs and benefits \nto  both  the  aiyl  okmotu  and  the  community  and  demonstrate  that  the  cash  flow  from  these \ninvestments will be sufficient to cover the recurrent expenditures necessary for maintenance. If \nthe  investments  do  not  generate  sufficient  financial  incentives  for  the  aiyl  okmotu  and  the \ncommunity,  there  is  a  high  risk  that  rehabilitated  facilities  and  improved  pastures  will  not  be \nproperly  maintained.  Therefore  the  selection  of  investments  based  on  the  proper  criteria, \nincluding financial sustainability, will be critical. \n \n133.  Other  important  risks  include  some  that  are  beyond  the  control  of  the  Project,  such  as \npolitical  instability,  macroeconomic  shocks,  and  commodity  price  shocks,  and  others  that  the \nProject can influence, such as corruption and a failure to recruit staff based on their skills rather \nthan  on  personal connections.  The problem  of  interference in  staff  recruitment  is  a  major  risk, \nand  probably  the  key  factor  that  will  determine  the  Project\u2019s  success  or  failure.  The \nindependence of the PMU and the MAWRPI in staff recruitment is critical and must be strictly \nenforced. \n \n134.  Overall,  given  the  identified  risks  and  associated  mitigation  measures,  the  Project  is \nconsidered  to  be  financially  and  economically  viable  and  to  have  a  high  level  of  overall \nsustainability. \n \n\nV.  ASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances  regarding,  among  others,  accounting,  auditing \n135. \nand  anticorruption,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  include  the  following  assurances  in  the \nFinancing Agreement to be entered into with ADB:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Government  shall  make  available  all  counterpart  funds  required  for  the \nProject  and  on  an  annual  basis  for  each  fiscal  year  make  adequate  budgetary \nallocations  required  to  implement  the  Project,  including  the  requirements  of  the \nIEE, EMP, gender action plan, and community participation plan.  \nThe allotted annual budget allocations to any aiyl okmotu in the Project area shall \nnot  be  reduced  as  a  result  of  any  such  aiyl  okmotu  being  provided  with  grant \nfinancing from the Project and the annual budget allocations to any aiyl okmotu in \nthe Project area shall not be less than those from the previous fiscal year. \nPrior  to  rehabilitating  any  cooling  and  storage  facilities,  the  aiyl  okmotu  or  the \ncooperative,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall  obtain  a  commitment  from  a  qualified \nprivate  sector  operator  to  operate  and  manage  the  rehabilitated  facilities  for  a \nminimum period of 5 years. Cooperatives owning such facilities shall enter into a \nrepayment  agreement  with  the  MOEF  to  cover  the  cost  of  rehabilitating  the \nfacilities. \nAgribusinesses receiving advisory services shall be required to pay a portion of \nthe advisory service costs, subject to a minimum amount of 5% of such costs. \n\n \n\n\f 30 \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe WUA support units shall be fully integrated into the  DWR by the end of 2007 \nand  the  number  of  WUA  support  units  in  the  Project  area  as  of  October  2006 \nshall not be decreased. \nThe Government, through MAWRPI, shall adopt a series of plans, acceptable to \nADB,  for  improving  and  managing  pasture  lands  and  orchards  and  such  plans \nshall  be  completed  within  3  years  of  the  effective  date.  The  Government  shall \nrequest  that  the  aiyl  okmotu  reinvest  lease  revenues  derived  as  a  result  of  the \nplans for pasture lands in an amount sufficient to finance the O&M requirements \nof pasture land infrastructure. \nEach  irrigation  and  drainage  rehabilitation  plan  shall  incorporate  a  site-specific \nEMP. \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The Project shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable environmental \nlaws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  the  IEE,  the  EMP  and \neach  site-specific  EMP.  Pesticides  shall  be  selected,  procured  and  stored  in \ncompliance with all applicable laws and requirements. \nNo  WUA  infrastructure  that  (a)  is  prone  to  natural  disasters,  (b)  will  have  a \nserious  negative  impact  on  the  environment,  or  (c)  would  materially  affect  the \nquality  or  quantity  of  water  flows  in  the  Syr  Darya  river  basin  shall  be  financed \nunder the Project. \nIf the Project causes land acquisition and resettlement impacts, the Government \nshall  inform  ADB  and  justify  the  impacts.  After  concurrence  from  ADB,  the \nGovernment  shall  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement (1995).  \nAll civil works contracts will contain provisions (a) requiring contractors to comply \nwith  (1)  applicable  workplace  occupational  safety  norms,  (2)  applicable  labor \nlaws,  (3)  any  resettlement  plan,  (b)  prohibiting  the  use  of  child  labor,  and  (c) \nensuring  that  there  is  no  differentiation  in  wages  between  men  and  women  for \nwork of equal value.  \nThe use of contracted child labor by farmers for activities financed by the credit \nline shall be prohibited. \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xiii)  The gender action plan and community participation plan shall be implemented in \n\naccordance with their respective terms. \n\n(xv) \n\nin  scope: \n\n(xiv)  All  reports,  drawings,  maps,  and  historical  data  on  soil,  water  and  land  use \ncharacteristics and related information shall be made available to the PMU. \nIn  the  event  the  GEF  grant  funding  cannot  be  obtained,  the  Government  and \nADB  agree  that  (a)  the  following  Project  components  and/or  activities  shall  be \nreduced \ntraining  and  demonstrations  under  Component  1; \ninfrastructure  investment  and  training  for  pasture  users  and  aiyl  okmotu  under \nComponent 4; and project management inputs under Component 5, and (b) the \nfollowing  Project  components  and/or  activities  shall  not  be  financed:  remote \nsensing and geographical information system for pasture mapping; and provision \nof  pasture  land  management  specialist  and  GIS  specialist  under  Component  4. \nAlternatively, the Government may make other arrangements necessary to cover \nthe funding shortfall, acceptable to ADB.  \n\nB. \n\n \nConditions for Loan and Grant Effectiveness \n \n\n136.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  meet  the  following  conditions  to  loan  and  grant \neffectiveness: (i) the central PMU shall have been established in Osh Oblast; and (ii) the central \nPMU  shall  be  staffed  with  a  full-time  project  manager,  financial  manager,  and  procurement \nspecialist, in each case acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n31\n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\nC. \n \n137.  The Government has agreed to meet the following conditions for any loan disbursement \nbeing  made  to  any  PFI  for  purposes  of  establishing  the  credit  line  under  the  Project:  (i)  the \nGovernment  and  the  PFI  shall  have  entered  into  a  Subsidiary  Loan  Agreement  in  form  and \nsubstance  satisfactory  to  ADB;  (ii)  ADB  and  the  PFI  shall  have  entered  into  a  Project \nAgreement;  and  (iii)  ADB  shall  have  received  a  satisfactory  legal  opinion  in  respect  of  the \nlegality  and  effectiveness  of  the  Subsidiary  Loan  Agreement  and  Project  Agreement,  among \nother matters. \n \n\nVI.

The population in the south totals 2.6 million people, of which \n47% reside in Osh Oblast, 36% in Jalalabad Oblast, and 17% in Batken Oblast. More than 77% \nof the population in these three oblasts is rural, compared with 65% nationally. The percentage \nof the population living in rural areas is even higher for the project raions. \n \nIn  terms  of  poverty,  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection  divides  the  population \n3. \ninto  four  household  categories:  nonpoor  (43%),  poor  (19%),  very  poor  (34%),  and  extremely \npoor (37%). These poverty levels are based on monthly household incomes determined using \nhousehold  social  passport  data.1 Of  the  543,400  households  living  in  the  south,  32%  live  in \nhighland villages, of which 25% are extremely poor, 22% are very poor, and 11% are poor. Of \nthe 68% of households living in the lowlands, 19% are extremely poor, 18% are very poor, and \n11% are poor.2 The percentage of poor, very poor, and extremely poor differs by region in the \nsouth, with Batken having the highest number of extreme poor as a percentage of all poor.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  availability  of  agricultural  land  per  capita  of  rural  population  is  lower  in  the  three \ntarget  oblasts  than  nationally  by  36%  to  40%.  Similarly,  the  Land  Redistribution  Fund  is \nmarkedly smaller in the south: nationally, the Land Reallocation Fund is 0.11 hectares (ha) per \ncapita  of  rural  population  available, while  in  the  south  there  is  only  0.07  ha  per  capita  of  rural \npopulation  in  all  three  oblasts,  about  36%  less  than  the  national  average.  Land  use  is  further \ncomplicated by substantial land fragmentation into smaller plots. \n \n5. \nApproximately 80% of all arable land in the country is irrigated, but in the three southern \noblasts,  the  figures  are  48%  in  Batken,  53%  in  Jalalabad,  and  62%  in  Osh.  In  addition,  in \nBatken  not  only  is  the  availability  of  irrigated  land  70%  of  the  national  average,  but  Batken  is \nless  suitable  for  agricultural  production  because  of  the  higher  elevation,  the  shorter  cropping \nseason, and the harsh climatic conditions.  \n \nThe  south  is  dominated  by  small  subsistence  farmers.  While  significant  differences \n6. \nbetween farms are apparent, the landholding of the average lowland farmer typically consists of \n0.60  ha  of  irrigated  arable  land  and  0.29  ha  of  rainfed  arable  land,  along  with  access  to  an \naverage of 3 ha of village pasture.3 A typical lowland farm uses at least 75% of its irrigated land \nto  produce  cereal  crops  (for  domestic  use),  with  the  remaining  25%  allocated  to  sunflower \nproduction  (5%)  for  home-consumed  cooking  oil),  cotton  (12%  for  cash  and  by-products  for \nfeeding livestock), vegetables (5% for cash), and fruit trees (3% for cash). In addition, six sheep \n\n                                                 \n1  Social passport data is included at the level of the aiyl okmotu. The monthly incomes of extremely poor households \nare  less  than  Som140,  of  very  poor  households  are  between  Som140  and  Som400,  and  of  poor  households \nbetween Som400 and Som600.  \n\n2  These figures should be treated with caution. Anecdotal evidence suggests cases of people unfairly influencing the \nallocation of social  passports. In addition, data problems  with the classification of poor, very poor, and extremely \npoor households have resulted in duplication between categories.  \n\n3   This is an indicative figure based on the total amount of village pasture in the project area divided by the number of \nhouseholds  in  the  project  area.  Farmers  have  to  lease  village  pastures  from  the  aiyl  okmotu.  They  also  have \naccess  to  midlevel  and  high  mountain  pastures  if  they  can  secure  a  lease  agreement  with  raion  and  oblast \nadministrations, respectively. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\nCrop Production and Marketing \n\n38 \n \nmight  be  fattened  on  concentrates,  crop  waste,  and  fodder.  Rainfed  arable  land  is  used  for \ncereals and forage production: 55% for cereals, 10% for safflower or other oil crops (for oil), and \n35%  for  forage  (including  30%  for  sheep  and  5%  for  dairy  cows).  Farms\u2019  cash  income,  after \nhousehold and livestock needs, is around $346 annually. Nonfarm income typically amounts to \na  further  $500  per  year.  Farm  expenditure  accounts  for  around  $304  annually.  Household \nexpenses  (additional  food,  nonfood  items,  education,  health,  social  obligations,  and  additional \nlivestock  fodder  purchases)  typically  account  for  a  further  $690  per  year.  Thus,  households \nhave a cash deficit in most years and accumulate debt. They require financing, which reaches a \nseasonal peak of $179 per year.  \n \nC. \n \n7. \nA significant decrease in wheat areas, and corresponding increases in cash crop areas \n(notably  cotton  and  oilseeds),  has  been  apparent  throughout  the  project  area.  This  suggests \nthat small farmers may slowly be moving out of subsistence production, possibly in response to \ninvestments in irrigation infrastructure, agricultural services, and finance, or possibly because of \nan increased availability of wheat flour in shops.  \n \n8. \nIn Batken Oblast, wheat is by far the dominant crop in all raions\u2014along with maize and \npotatoes in upland areas and relatively small quantities of rice\u2014and is used primarily for home \nconsumption, with bran being fed to livestock. Cash crops include oilseed crops (partly for home \nconsumption);  fruits  (particularly  apricots  sold  dried  and  cherries  sold  fresh  to  the  Russian \nmarket);  vegetables;  and  small  areas  of  rice,  cotton,  and  tobacco  (sold  under  contract  to \ntobacco companies). A small decline in wheat areas and an increase in cash crops have been \nevident over the last 4 years. \n \n9. \nIn Jalalabad Oblast, wheat and maize mainly for home consumption are important, but \ncotton and oilseed production are more important sources of cash than in the other two oblasts, \nwhile  fruit  production  is  less  important.  Small  areas  of  vegetables,  rice,  and  tobacco  also \nprovide  cash  income.  The  wheat  area  has  decreased  sharply  in  the  last  4  years,  with \ncorresponding increases in cotton and/or oilseed crop production depending on the raion. The \npistachio  and  walnut  forests  are  a  resource  unique  to  Jalalabad  and  are  of  international \nsignificance. The livelihoods of people around these forests are strongly linked to the forests. \n \n10. \nIn  Osh  Oblast,  wheat  is  the  dominant  crop,  which  along  with  maize  is  used  mainly  for \nhome  consumption.  Oil  crops  and  cotton  are  the  main  cash  crops.  Other  cash  crops  are  fruit, \nvegetables, and rice grown in small areas. Potatoes are important in upland areas. The cotton \narea has increased by almost 30% over the last 4 years.  \n \nD. \n \nLivestock numbers have increased since 2000. While official data suggest that livestock \n11. \nproduction per head is high, the data appear to be unrealistic. Official data indicate that lambing \npercentages  in  2003  were  86%  in  Batken,  94%  in  Jalalabad,  and  93%  in  Osh.  The  calving \npercentages  in  2003  were  102%  in  Batken,  91%  in  Jalalabad,  and  98%  in  Osh.  Given  the \nanimal  health  and  nutrition  issues  farmers  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  face,  including  in  the  three \nsouthern  oblasts,  these  numbers  appear  to  be  unrealistically  high.  Milk  yields  typically  range \nbetween 1,000 and 1,500 liters per lactation and are low. \n \nfragmentation  of  administration  between  oblast  administrations,  raion \n12.  With \nadministrations, aiyl okmotu, and forest farms, the centralization of pasture monitoring in relation \nto effective grazing management in the south has not been achieved, resulting in overgrazing of \nthe lower pastures and undergrazing of the higher pastures. A complicating factor is the large \nnumber  of  animals  from  the  Fergana  Valley  coming  into  the  southern  oblasts  for  summer \n\nLivestock Production \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\nmountain  grazing,  which  makes  stocking  rate  calculations  of  limited  usefulness.  With  the \nintroduction of price differentiation (payments for summer grazing for livestock from neighboring \ncountries are around eight times more than those for local livestock), evasion of payment further \ncomplicates pasture management and animal health issues. \n \nE. \n \n13. \nof waterlogging. \n \n\nTable A2.1 shows irrigated areas and salinity levels and table A2.2 shows the incidence \n\nIrrigation and Drainage System \n\nTable A2.1: Proportion of Irrigated Land and Percentage of Salination,  \nSelected Oblasts, 2005 \n \n\nOblast \n\nTotal Area \nIrrigated (ha) \n\nTotal Area \nSalinated (ha) \n\nBatken \nJalalabad \nOsh \nSource: Institute of Irrigation data. \n\n  57,505 \n128,959 \n130,776 \n\n3,783 \n2,865 \n2,328 \n\nPercentage of \nIrrigated Area \nSalinated \n6.6 \n2.2 \n1.8 \n\nPercentage of Irrigated \nArea Moderately to \nStrongly Salinated \n2.9 \n0.2 \n0.2 \n\nTable A2.2: Groundwater Depth Classes as a Percentage of Area Irrigated, \n Selected Oblasts, 2005 \n\n \n\n \n\nOblast \nBatken \nJalalabad \nOsh \nSource: Institute of Irrigation data. \n\n0\u20131.0 \n0.7 \n0.3 \n1.0 \n\n0\u20131.5 \n1.3 \n2.9 \n2.3 \n\n0\u20132.0 \n2.3 \n5.8 \n5.0 \n\n2.0\u20133.0 \n2.3 \n2.5 \n2.1 \n\n3.0\u20135.0 \n2.7 \n5.0 \n2.0 \n\n>5.0 \n92.7 \n86.8 \n90.9 \n\nAdvisory Services \n\n \n \nF. \n \n14. \nThe  Rural  Advisory  Service  provides  services  in  all  three  oblasts,  but  its  coverage  is \nlimited  to  less  than  6%  of  farmers.

The  Association  of  Agribusinessmen  of \nKyrgyzstan also provides advisory services to clients of its member agribusinesses (mainly input \nsuppliers)  and  is  encouraging  its  agribusiness  clients  to  provide  advisory  services  to  farmers \ndirectly. \n \nG. \n \n15. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Agricultural  Finance  Corporation  has  branches  and  sub-branches  through \nthe project area and is likely to be the main source of finance for small farmers. The south has \n156  credit  unions,  a  total  of  almost  14,000  members,  and  an  active  portfolio  totaling  $8.38 \nmillion.  The  three  established  microfinance  institutions\u2014Bai  Tushum,  Kompanion,  and \nFoundation for International Community Assistance\u2014all have branches in Osh and serve part of \nthe  project  area.  At  least  three  emerging  microfinance  institutions\u2014Agro  Kredit  Plus,  Mehkr \nShavkat, and Oxus\u2014serve small parts of the project area, and are expected to expand.  \n \n \n\nFinancial Institutions \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \n\nfor  salaries \n\n1. \nA  number  of  entities  have  provided  external  assistance  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has provided a series of technical assistance (TA) activities to \nthe  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Water  Resources,  and  Processing  Industry  (MAWRPI)  to  support \nagricultural  strategy  formulation  and  policy  development.1 The  Swiss  Agency  for  Development \nand Cooperation (SDC) undertook a policy support project that assisted with the preparation of \nMAWRPI\u2019s  agrarian  policy  concept  until  2010.  The  European  Union  Technical  Assistance  for \nCommonwealth of Independent States provided support for the strategy plan for the agriculture \nand  food  sector,  which  started  in  1994,  and  the  Regional  Agricultural  Reform  Project,  which \nstarted in 1996. The World Bank has had a major influence on agricultural strategy and policy \nthrough  its  agriculture  sector  projects  and  published  reports  on  agriculture  sector  reviews, \nstrategy, and policy.2  \n \nThe European Union Food Security Program, which finances the entire MAWRPI budget \n2. \nexcept \ninitiated  a  series  of \nthrough  conditional  budgetary  support,  has \nreorganizations  and  downsizing  of  the  MAWRPI  since  the  start  of  the  program  in  1997.3 The \nprogram  has  also  established  systems  for  providing  training  in  agriculture  sector  budgeting  at \nthe national, oblast, and raion levels.  \n \nThe  World  Bank  has  driven  farm  privatization  and  land  reform  through  its  Agricultural \n3. \nPrivatization and Adjustment Credit, Land, and Real Estate Project, on which it is working with \nGosregister, and the land and agrarian reform component of the Agricultural Services Support \nProject  (ASSP).4 Legal  support  and  public  information  on  land  reform  has  been  provided  by \nprojects  funded  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  the \nSDC (the Kyrgyz Land Reform Project, the Legal Assistance to Rural Citizens Project, and the \nLegal  Infrastructure  for  a  Market  Economy  Project),  as  well  as  by  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  (the  Third  Party  Arbitration  Project).  ADB  is \ncurrently preparing an overview of the impact of land reform.5  \n \n4. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Agricultural  Finance  Corporation  (KAFC),  a  nonbank  financial  institution, \nwas established in 1997 following the dissolution of Agroprombank and has since been financed \nthrough  credit  lines,  namely,  the  World  Bank  Rural  Finance  Project  I  ($16  million),  the  World \nBank Rural Finance Project II ($15 million), the World Bank Agribusiness and Marketing Project \n(AMP,  $5  million),  the  Farmers  Development  Fund  ($2.25  million),  and  the  ADB  AADP  ($10 \nmillion),  and  through  guarantees  from  German  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche \nfor  Technical \nGesellschaft \nCooperation)  and  from  the  Raiffeisen  Foundation  for  Development  Cooperatives.  The  KAFC \nhas received substantial TA from the World Bank, ADB, the European Union, and the DFID.  \n\nf\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit \n\n(GTZ,  German  Agency \n\n                                                 \n1  Loan 1407-KGZ: Agricultural Sector Program 1995; TA 2540 Reorganization and Strengthening of MAWR 1995\u2013\n1999; TA 3035 Capacity Building for MAWRPI Phase I 1998-1999; TA 3439 Capacity Building for MAWRPI, Phase \nII 2001\u20132003; and TA 4409 Agricultural Strategy Formulation 2005\u20132006). \n\n2  Agricultural  Policy  Review:  Strategies  for  Rural  Growth  and  Poverty  Alleviation,  1998;  Kyrgyz  Agriculture  and \nAgribusiness, Opportunities and Obstacles 1992; Irrigation in Central Asia\u2014Social, Economic, and Environmental \nConsiderations, 2003; World Bank Agricultural Policy Update 2004; Livestock Sector Review, 2005. \n\n3  The program started in the Ministry of Economy and Finance in 1997, and the MAWRPI office opened in 1999. \n4  The World Bank ASSP components are land and agrarian reform, seed sector development, crop protection and \nplant  quarantine,  rural  advisory  service  and  agricultural  market  information,  and  flood  damage  repair  and  are \nscheduled for completion in June 2007. The project is financed by an International Development Association credit \nof $13.9 million and an International Fund for Agricultural Development loan of $8.6 million.  \n\n5  Currently  being  prepared  by  the  ADB  under  TA  4408-KGZ:  Study  on  the  Impact  of  Land  Reform  Agriculture, \n\nPoverty and the Environment. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n41 \n\nthe \n\nThe Financial Company for Savings and Credit Unions, an apex organization that lends \n5. \nto  credit  unions,  was  financed  by  ADB  under  the  Rural  Financial  Institutions  Project 6  and \nsupported by ADB TA7 and GTZ TA.  \n \nInstitutional development of the microfinance sector has been financed mainly by ADB,8 \n6. \nUSAID,  Mercy  Corp,  and \nInternational  Finance  Corporation,  while  numerous \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  including  the  Aga  Khan  Foundation  and  GTZ  have \nprovided  microfinance  loans  directly  from  their  projects.  The  USAID  has  established  a \nwholesale  microfinance  organization,  Frontiers,  through  which  the  Community  Development \nInvestment  Agency  will  disburse  credit  to  several  microfinance  institutions  in  Chui  and  Osh \noblasts  under  the  ADB  Rural  Livelihood  Development  Project. 9  The  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development is financing the provision of microfinance through commercial \nbanks under the Micro and Small Enterprises Financing Facility ($20 million under the first credit \nline and $30 million under a second credit line).  \n \n7. \nThe  Rural  Advisory  Service,  a  nationwide  advisory  service  and  a  sister  organization  to \nthe  Agricultural  Training  Center,  was  established  in  1998  under  the  World  Bank  ASSP  and \ncontinues to be financed by the SDC and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. A \nfurther phase of financing may be considered during preparation of the ASSP II, which is likely \nto be in 2007. The Training and Extension Service Center, has been financed by both GTZ and \nthe  USAID.  Both  advisory  services  now  derive  an  increasing  proportion  of  their  income  from \nservice  contracts  with  various  funding  agency  and  NGO-financed  projects,  including  the  ADB \nAADP and Rural Livelihood Development Project. \n \nThe  seeds  industry  is  currently  supported  by  the  Swedish  International  Development \n8. \nCooperation Authority and the World Bank ASSP. Support has included development of a legal \nand  regulatory  framework,  including  the  Seed  Law  and  the  Plant  Variety  Protection  Law; \nassistance  with  attaining  membership  of  international  organizations  governing  the  seed  trade, \nthat is, the International Seed Trade Association, the Union for Protection of Varieties, and the \nInternational  Seed  Federation;  protection  of  breeders\u2019  rights  through  the  establishment  of  a \nroyalty  collection  system;  technical  support  to  specialized  seed  farms;  establishment  of  the \nSeeds  Association  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic;  development  of  the  Republican  State  Seeds \nInspectorate and the Cotton Seed Inspectorate, which are responsible for seed certification and \ninspection; and assistance with developing agreements for seed multiplication with international \nseed companies. The World Bank ASSP has also distributed seed to 70 community seed funds \nunder a pilot program for poverty reduction \n \n9. \nFunding  agencies  have  supported  the  development  of  agribusinesses  in  various  ways. \nOne  approach  has  been  the  establishment  of  associations  of  agribusinesses,  including  the \nAssociation  of  Agribusinessmen  of  Kyrgyzstan,  which  was  financed  by  the  USAID,  and  the \nAssociation of Fruit and Vegetable Processing Industries which was supported by the Helvetas \nSupport  to  Private  Initiatives  Project  funded  by  the  SDC.  A  complementary  approach  used  by \nthe Support to Private Initiatives Project was the development of local consultancy companies \nproviding  financial  planning,  marketing,  and  legal  services  to  agribusinesses.  The  World  Bank \nAMP  established  the  Agribusiness  Competitiveness  Center  in  2005  to  provide  long-term \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  1997.

The \nInternational  Trade  Center  is  supporting  the  certification  of  processors  for  international  phyto-\nsanitary standards. Other projects have taken  a more product-specific approach, including the \nHelvetas Local Market Development Project and the USAID-funded Agrofin Plus Project, which \nfacilitate  the  management  of  contracts  between  farmers  and  input  suppliers,  agroprocessors, \nadvisory  services,  and  credit  institutions  for  specific  fruit,  vegetable,  and  dairy  products.  The \nUSAID  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  Project, \nimplemented  by  Pragma \nCorporation,  provides  business  planning  advice  directly  to  small  and  medium  enterprises, \nincluding  agribusinesses,  which  is  also  the  approach  taken  under  the  ADB  AADP.  Little \nbusiness  advice  has  been  targeted  specifically  at  machinery  services  other  than  the  advisory \nwork  undertaken  by  the  AADP.  However,  between  1997  and  2001,  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  provided  tractors  and  combine  harvesters  as  a  grant  to  the  Government. \nThe  machinery  was  provided  to  beneficiaries  under  preferential  lease  agreements  between \nbeneficiaries and the Altyntechservice, a state-owned enterprise now due for privatization. \n \nThe  German  Government,  through  the  GTZ  Development  of  Trade  and  Service \n10. \nCooperatives  Project  and  the  Raiffeisen  Foundation  for  Development  Cooperatives  projects, \nhas assisted with the development of the legal framework for the establishment of cooperatives, \nprovided field TA, and provided finance to cooperatives through guarantee agreements with the \nKAFC  and  Bai  Tushum.  Various  other  projects  have  also  included  elements  of  cooperative \ndevelopment, including the Batken-based GTZ Project for Capacity Building and Food Security, \nRegional  Cooperation,  and  Conflict  Mitigation,  which  established  Moll  Tushum,  a  large  input \nsupply cooperative with more than 1,500 members. \n \n11. \nThe  main  investments  in  relation  to  the  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  and  drainage \ninfrastructure have been made under the World Bank\u2019s Irrigation Rehabilitation Project ($46.80 \nmillion), the Onfarm Irrigation Project ($29 million), and the drainage and irrigation rehabilitation \ncomponent  of  the  ADB  AADP  ($15.28  million).  Further  off-farm  rehabilitation  ($19  million)  is \nscheduled  under  the  World  Bank  Water  Management  Improvement  Project.  Smaller-scale \nrehabilitation has been undertaken by the USAID, Mercy Corp, the European Union, the United \nNations Development Programme, and the Aga Khan Foundation. \n \n12. \nthe \nestablishment of water user associations (WUAs) and the new Water Code (2005) has been led \nby  the  World  Bank.  ADB  has  supported  water  management  through  several  TAs. 10  The \nestablishment  and  training  of  WUA  staff  has  primarily  been  undertaken  by  the  World  Bank \nOnfarm  Irrigation  Project  and  to  a  lesser  extent  and  more  recently,  by  the  USAID.  Further \ninstitutional  reform,  including  the  establishment  of  WUA  federations,  the  reorganization  of  the \nDepartment of Water Resources, and the establishment of the State Water Administration, will \nbe undertaken under the World Bank Water Management Improvement Project.  \n \n13. \nInvestment  in  rural  infrastructure  has  been  financed  under  the  ADB  Community-Based \nInfrastructure Services Sector Project11 and the World Bank and DFID Rural Water Supply and \nSanitation Project. Financing has also been provided through projects providing small grants to \ncommunities for investment in potable water, irrigation, electricity, schools, medical clinics, and \n\nfor  water  management  resulting \n\ninstitutional \n\nframework \n\nlegal  and \n\nThe \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n10 Including the ADB TA 2451 Build Capacity for the Formation and Management of WUA 1996 and more recently the \n\nStudy on Pricing Systems and Cost Recovery Mechanisms for Irrigation Water TA 4405, 2005 - 2006. \n\n11 ADB.  2000.

These  projects  have  also \nhelped establish capacity at the aiyl okmotu level for planning and grant management through \nthe establishment of investment committees. \n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nASSESSMENT OF THE AGRICULTURE AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT \n\nOverall Financial and Physical Progress \n\n \n1. \nThe Southern Agriculture Area Development Project (SAADP) will adopt the same area \ndevelopment concept and approach used by the Agriculture Area Development Project (AADP) \nimplemented  in  Chui  Oblast  in  the  north  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  This  approach  seeks  to \naddress  a  range  of  issues  (drainage  and  irrigation,  access  to  credit,  advisory  services, \nmarketing,  agribusiness  development,  and  equitable  access  to  land)  simultaneously,  focusing \nintensively  on  target  aiyl  okmotu.  The  AADP  has  had  a  substantial  and  visible  impact  on \nagriculture  in  those  target  aiyl  okmotu  where  drainage  and  irrigation  rehabilitation  has  been \ncompleted and the combined impact of all project components is now visible. Many aspects of \nthe  AADP\u2019s  design  and  implementation  (notably,  the  farm  development  component  and  the \ndrainage and irrigation component) are therefore replicated in the Project, while other aspects \n(notably, the credit, agribusiness development, and marketing components) have been adapted \nto  achieve  a  greater  impact  more  rapidly.  An  additional  component,  land  improvement,  which \naddresses  pasture  management  and  orchard  management  constraints  in  the  south,  has  been \nadded. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nAs of 30 September 2006, the Project had been under implementation for 102 months, \nwith  a  further  27  months  to  run  until  project  completion  (31  December  2008),  had  expended \n50.5%  ($18.21  million)  of  total  loan  funds  (SDR  8,297,000  or  approximately  $38  million),  and \nhad achieved 79% of the intended physical progress. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  AADP\u2019s  impact  on  farm  incomes  is  expected  to  be  achieved  through  several \ncategories  of  benefits.  As  drainage  and  irrigation  rehabilitation  has  not  yet  been  completed  in \nthe  majority  of  target  aiyl  okmotu,  the  combined  impact  of  all  project  components  is  not  yet \nmeasurable. The main categories of benefits are: (i) reduced flooding of settlements, including \nhouses, yards, garden plots (which are an important source of food security for the poor), and \ncrop  storage  areas  as  a  result  of  drainage  rehabilitation,  including  that  undertaken  to  reduce \nvillage flooding1 in the Uzen Kur aiyl okmotu, approximately 20 households have benefited from \nreduced  flooding.  A  further  1,450  houses  affected  by  flooding  are  expected  to  benefit;  (ii) \nreclamation  of  modest  areas  of  land  previously  unused  because  of  extreme  salinity  or \nwaterlogging  as  a  result  of  drainage  and  irrigation  rehabilitation.  In  Jany  Pahta,  280  hectares \n(ha)  (approximately  10%  of  the  irrigated  area)  have  been  reclaimed  and  initially  cropped  with \ncabbage for sale to Kazakhstan. Cabbage will be grown in rotation with other crops, yielding a \nnet  present  value  of  incremental  benefits  of  about  $1.3 million  or  $4,600  per  ha;  (iii)  a  shift  in \ncropping from low-value crops (e.g., nonirrigated wheat) to higher-value crops (e.g., alfalfa, root \ncrops,  and  vegetables  in  rotation  with  irrigated  wheat)  on  significant  areas  of  land.  This  is \nprimarily a result of drainage and irrigation rehabilitation in areas that were previously cropped, \nbut where cropping was restricted because of inadequate water supply or mild waterlogging and \nsalinity,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  is  a  result  of  improved  marketing  opportunities  and  training \nprovided by the Project. In Uzen Kur, a change in cropping has been achieved on 490 ha that \nwere previously cropped with nonirrigated wheat and are now cropped with irrigated wheat and \nalfalfa  for  cash  sale.  The  latter  crops  will  in  the  future  be  grown  in  rotation  with  other  crops, \n\nProject Impact \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Water  Resources,  and  Processing  Industry  requested,  and  the  Asian  Development \nBank  approved,  the  reallocation  of  $3.5  million  to  undertake  drainage  rehabilitation  in  eight  aiyl  okmotu  that \nexperienced extreme flooding of settlements. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n45 \n\nyielding a net present value of incremental benefits of about $1.1 million   or $2,100 per ha. In \nJany Pahta, a change in cropping is expected to be achieved on 300 ha (approximately 10% of \nthe irrigated area), where areas previously cropped with nonirrigated wheat will now be cropped \nwith  cabbage  and  alfalfa  for  cash  sale  in  rotation  with  irrigated  wheat.  These  crops  will  in  the \nfuture be grown in rotation with other crops, yielding a net present value of incremental benefits \nof $1.2 million or $3,800 per ha; (iv) improved crop yields in areas where the Project has not led \nto  a  change  in  cropping,  but  where  yields  were  previously  constrained  by  inadequate  water \nsupply,  mild  waterlogging  and  salinity,  and  poor  production  techniques.  This  is  a  result  of  a \ncombination of drainage and irrigation rehabilitation, training provided through the Project by the \nadvisory  services,  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  improved  machinery  services  facilitated  under  the \nenterprise development component. In Uzen Kur, improvements in crop yields are expected to \nbe  achieved  on  1,475  ha  as  a  result  of  drainage  and  irrigation  rehabilitation  and  training, \nyielding  a  net  present  value  of  incremental  benefits  of  $727,000  or  $490  per  ha.  Similarly,  in \nJany Pahta, improvements in crop yields are expected to be achieved on 2,400 ha yielding a net \npresent  value  of  incremental  benefits  of  $2.8  million  or  $1,200  per  ha;  (v)  increased  livestock \noutput  as  a  result  of  purchases  of  livestock  financed  from  the  Kyrgyz  Agricultural  Finance \nCorporation  (KAFC)  credit  line  amounting  to  $10.5  million.  Additional  increases  in  livestock \noutput may also have resulted to a much lesser extent from improved livestock yields as a result \nof  training  in  the  area  of  livestock,  which  has  been  relatively  limited  compared  with  training  in \ncrop production. \n \nProject Results \n\nC. \n \n \n \n4. \nTraining was provided to farmers by advisory services under contract to the Project. The \nkey  constraint  to  the  provision  of  services,  particularly  outreach,  has  been  and  remains  the \nlimited  capacity  of  the  advisory  services,  although  notable  improvements  in  services  are \napparent. Both contractors (Rural Advisory Service and Arsten) initially had difficulties in fulfilling \nservices for which they were contracted, completing only 69% and 80% of contracted activities, \nrespectively,  in  2004,  although  this  increased  to  100%  for  both  contractors  in  2005.  The \nstandard of services has improved during the Project, with the annual monitoring score for the \nRural Advisory Service increasing from 62% in 2004 to 98% in 2006 for training and from 50% \nin  2004  to  91%  in  2006  for  demonstrations.  The  Project  has  contributed  to  improvements  in \nservices  by  (i)  introducing  monitoring,  performance-based  payments,  and  competitive  bidding \nfor services; and (ii) changing the approach to training from extensive training of a large number \nof farmers to intensive training of a small number of leaders of training groups. Consequently, (i) \n12,400 farmers (103% of the target) have been trained through formal classroom training, field \ndemonstrations,  and/or  consultancy,  primarily  in  crop  production,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in \nlivestock production; (ii) 230 leaders of farmers\u2019 groups have been trained, many of whom have \nprogressed  to  work  in  agricultural  advisory  and  other  services;2 and  (iii)  155  demonstrations \nhave been established and attended by almost 10,000 farmers. \n \n5. \nIn  2005,  the  Project  financed  the  development  of  a  1-year  course  in  agricultural \nextension  at  the  Agrarian  University  in  Bishkek  to  be  implemented  under  contract  with  the \nAgricultural  Training  Center  and  in  association  with  the  Swiss  Agricultural  College.  A  course \ncurriculum has been prepared, 6 lecturers have been trained in course delivery, and the first 12 \n\nFarm Development \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n2   For  example,  of  the  33  leaders  trained  by  Arsten,  23%  went  on  to  work  as  village  advisers  for  the  advisory \nservices, 23% established small machinery or input supply services, and 10% became water user association staff. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n2. \n\nDrainage and Irrigation Rehabilitation  \n\nstudents have graduated from the course, with several going on to be employed by the advisory \nservices. The course is to be integrated into the Agrarian Academy\u2019s main curriculum in 2007. \n \n6. \nLegal  support  was  provided  to  farmers  through  cooperation  with  legal  support  projects \nfunded  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID).  The  support  was \nprimarily targeted at resolving land and property allocation disputes, which were most acute in \naiyl okmotu where large, unreformed cooperatives had emerged from the reorganization of the \nformer  state  farms  and  collective  farms.  The  social  tensions  and  lack  of  property  rights \ncharacterizing  these  disputes  were  a  barrier  to  achieving  advances  in  all  other  project \ncomponents.  The  Project\u2019s  cooperation  with  the  projects  funded  by  USAID  contributed \nsignificantly to the reorganization of cooperatives, enabling further development in aiyl okmotu. \n \n \n \n7. \nThe  Project  currently  targets  20  water  user  associations  (WUAs)  serving  50,086  ha \n(90%  of  the  originally  targeted  area). 3  The  Project  has  completed  all  onfarm  and  off-farm \nconstruction for three WUAs serving 5,766 ha (10% of the originally target area), construction is \nongoing  for  a  further  eight  WUAs  serving  18,246  ha  (33%  of  the  originally  targeted  area), \nbidding  for  construction  is  ongoing  for  design  for  four  WUAs  serving  14,033  ha  (26%  of  the \noriginally targeted area), design is ongoing for one WUA serving 3,604 ha (7% of the originally \ntargeted area), and designs are under tender for a further four WUAs serving 8,437 ha (15% of \nthe  originally  targeted  area).  Disbursements  for  onfarm  works  account  for  77%  of  total \ndisbursements  for  construction  to  date  and  those  for  off-farm  works  account  for  23%.  In \naddition,  designs  have  been  completed  for  civil  works  to  alleviate  flooding  in  six  seriously \naffected villages and will be financed from unallocated funds ($3.5 million). \n \n8. \nEven  though  the  Project  is  expected  to  achieve  rehabilitation  of  the  target  area  before \nproject completion, implementation has been hindered by a number of factors in addition to cost \nescalations. The limited number of design and construction companies has meant that in some \ncases an inadequate number of bids were submitted or that bids were not competitively priced, \nleading  to  re-tendering.  One  design  contract  and  one  construction  contract  have  been  re-\ntendered.  Designs  were  aimed  at  achieving  technically  and  financially  viable  irrigation  and \ndrainage  systems.  This  did  not  imply  complete  rehabilitation  of  the  systems;  however,  the \ncapping  of  rehabilitation  costs  for  each  WUA  has  in  some  cases  resulted  in  a  lower  level  of \nrehabilitation than some WUAs may have wished to undertake and been willing to repay,4 and \ngreater  flexibility  in  the  budget  for  each  WUA  may  have  been  desirable  and  has  been \nincorporated into the design of the Project. \n \n9. \nThe  strengthening  of  WUAs  was  undertaken  under  a  cooperation  agreement  with  the \nWorld  Bank  Onfarm  Irrigation  Project,  which  had  established  WUA  support  units  to  establish \nand  train  WUAs.  This  collaboration  has  succeeded  in  ensuring  that  WUAs  have  attained  the \nminimum  criteria  for  participation in the  Project  and  in  advancing  the  WUAs\u2019  financial  viability, \nspecifically,  in  helping  them  prepare  medium-term  financial  plans  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance of rehabilitated systems and for increasing water charges to cover such costs (a \nminimum  requirement  for  participation  in  the  Project).  Ensuring  implementation  of  these  plans \nwill  be  an  ongoing  challenge  for  the  WUA  support  units  and  will  be  critical  for  the  long-term \n\n                                                 \n3   The reduced target area is due to increased investment costs from $184 to $284 per ha and also reallocation of \n\n4  WUAs  are  required  to  repay  25%  of  the  costs  of  construction  over  a  7-year  period,  with  a  4-year  grace  period, \n\nfunds to address the village flooding problem. \n\nstarting from the completion of construction.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n47 \n\n3. \n\nto \n\nPrivate Sector Input Supply and Marketing Services \n\nidentify  buyers;  assistance  with  representation  at \n\nsustainability of the rehabilitated systems. The WUA support units have trained all WUAs under \nthe  Project  in  administration,  financial  management,  water  engineering,  water  management, \nmonitoring and evaluation, and legal issues. \n \n \n \n10. \nThe Project Management Unit (PMU) has sought to improve marketing opportunities for \nfarmers  by  (i)  establishing  informal  marketing  groups,  (ii)  identifying  buyers,  (iii)  developing \nimproved  contract  terms,  and  (iv)  negotiating  contracts  with  buyers.  To  date,  59  fruit  and \nvegetable  marketing  groups  serving  600  farmers  and  13  milk  marketing  groups  serving  100 \nfarmers have been established. Contracts for 12,000 metric tons of fruits and vegetables valued \nat  $700,000  and  for  673,000  liters  of  milk  valued  at  $86,000  have  been  facilitated.  Contract \nenforcement  remains  a  major  constraint,  with  both  parties  defaulting  on  contracts  with \npredetermined prices to seek short-term price gains through direct market sales or purchases. \nThe establishment of successful milk marketing groups early in the Project was hindered by the \ninability  or  unwillingness  of  group  members  to  borrow  to  purchase  milk  cooling  tanks  and  the \nabsence of alternative sources of finance for such investments. \n \n11. \nThe PMU has also worked to improve domestic and export marketing opportunities for \nprocessors and wholesalers. This has been achieved through missions to Kazakhstan and the \nfairs; \nRussian  Federation \ncollaboration  with  other  funding  agencies  to  establish  a  new  brand  name  (\u201ctaste  of  the  sun\u201d); \nand development of an agreement to supply the major food market chain, Narodny, in Bishkek \nwith processed food products. The result has been an increase in total sales by five processors \nof $425,000. The Project currently supports six businesses in domestic and export markets and \nhas secured 25 contracts for a total of $275,000 since project inception. \n \n12. \nThe PMU has provided consultancy, including in the areas of market research, financial \nand  strategic  planning,  and  technical  advice,  to  agribusinesses  serving  target  farmers.  Those \nsupported  include  16  machinery  contractors,  5  machinery  repair  services,  3  small  machinery \nmanufacturers,  3  spare  parts  distributors,  21  fruit  and  vegetable  processors,  and  5  milk \nprocessors.  Of  these,  six  processing  enterprises  have  been  helped  to  secure  finance  totaling \n$415,000 from the KAFC. \n \n \n \nA credit line of $10 million for investment finance was made available through the KAFC. \n13. \nTo  date,  $7.7  million  has  been  disbursed  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  to  the  KAFC, \nresulting  in  the  lending  of  Som444.2  million  ($11.1  million),  of  which  93%  was  for  livestock \npurchases,  5%  for  equipment  and  construction,  and  2%  for  processing.  Fifteen  percent  of \nlending has been to target project areas and 85% to other areas within Chui Oblast, and 18.5% \nof the outstanding portfolio remains in the target area. The repayment performance on the credit \nline is high at 99.14%. The credit line has been managed independently by the KAFC, and the \nPMU has not been involved in lending decisions or monitoring. \n \n \n \n14. \nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry has proven to be \ncompetent  in  undertaking  its  role  as  the  Executing  Agency.  Given  its  limited  resources,  the \noblast  administration,  the  Implementing  Agency,  contributed  little  to  the  PMU\u2019s  day-to-day \noperations, although it is involved in project oversight and tender committees. \n\nProject Management \n\nRural Finance \n\ntrade \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nKey Lessons  \n\nThe  financial  management  system  and  the  reporting  system  established  under  the \n15. \nAADP  were  successful  and  can  be  used  for  the  Project  with  some  adaptations.  Acceptable \nprocurement  procedures  for  irrigation  and  drainage  rehabilitation  took  time  to  establish  at  the \nstart  of  the  Project,  and  thus  the  Project  subsequently  experienced  delays  in  relation  to  such \ncontracts. \n \n16. \nThe AADP\u2019s monitoring and evaluation system was established late during the Project, \nand until the recent appointment of a permanent sociologist, did not include adequate provision \nfor monitoring the Project\u2019s social and gender aspects. \n \nD.  \n \nAs a result of the AADP\u2019s experience, oblast administrations have not been appointed as \n17. \nimplementing agencies under the Project, although it is considered important that they maintain \na strong oversight role through their representation on the Project Steering Committee. \n \nThe  early  establishment  of  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  is  essential,  and  the \n18. \nProject  includes  adequate  national and  international  consultancy  resources  to  be  employed  at \nthe  start  of  the  Project  (including  expertise  in  social  and  environmental  monitoring)  to  ensure \nthat this takes place. \n \n19. \nOther aspects of management that will be critical to the success of the Project include (i) \nestablishing a strong management team, (ii) replicating the financial management system used \nunder  the  AADP,  (iii)  ensuring  greater  transparency  and  fairness  in  staff  recruitment,  (iv) \ninvesting  in  staff  training  early  in  the  Project,  and  (v)  ensuring  sufficient  international \nconsultancy to support the PMU during the first 3 years of the Project. \n \n20.  While  the  general  approach  of  contracting  local  advisory  services  and  encouraging \ncompetition between service providers has helped improve the quality of the services provided, \nmore  intensive  investment  is  needed  to  improve  the  quality  of  training  materials  and  field \nadvisers\u2019  skills.  The  Project  includes  a  provision  for  a  contract  to  develop  high-quality  training \nmaterials  and  train  advisers  in  their  use,  as  well  as  a  provision  for  investment  in  farmer  field \nschools to increase the number of village-based advisers with specialist extension skills. \n \n21. \nThe  procurement  procedure  for  the  design  of  drainage  and  irrigation  rehabilitation  did \nnot  result  in  significant  competition  given  the  limited  number  of  design  companies  under  the \nAADP,  and  in-house  design  capacity  might  have  been  preferable.  In  the  south,  the  existing \noblast rehabilitation teams used by the World Bank have the capacity for basic design and can \nbe used by the Project with the support of a design company for complex designs. \n \n22.  Well-managed, financially sustainable WUAs are critical to the rehabilitation process and \nthe sustainability of rehabilitated systems. The cooperation agreement between the Project and \nWUA  support  units  established  under  the  AADP  is  to  be  replicated  under  the  Project. \nFurthermore, the Project includes an assurance that the Government will continue to finance the \nWUA support units during the life of the Project. \n \n23. \nThe  scale  of  technical  support  for  agribusiness  development  under  the  AADP  was \nrelatively small in relation to the amount of credit finance available, and the uptake of credit for \ninvestment  in  agribusiness  development  was  relatively  small.  Investment  in  support  for \nmarketing was similarly modest in relation to the overall project budget. To address this issue, \nthe Project design includes a provision to contract a local organization dedicated to agribusiness \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n49 \n\ndevelopment and marketing to provide, where necessary, long-term commercial consultancy to \nagribusinesses to help them prepare and implement investment proposals to be financed under \nthe  credit  line.  Alternative  forms  of  finance  for  agribusinesses,  such  as  equity  investment,  will \nalso  be  examined.  The  organization  will  also  provide  marketing  links  between  these \nagribusinesses and farmers. \n \n24. \nThe conditions for obtaining credit from the KAFC under the AADP were not appropriate \nfor  all  farmers  and  agribusinesses.  Diversifying  the  range  of  financial  institutions  involved  in \ncredit  provision  to  include  commercial  banks  and  wholesale  microfinance  institutions  for \nonlending  to  credit  unions  and  microfinance  organizations  under  the  Project  will  provide \nborrowers with more choices and will encourage competition between lenders. \n \nIn conclusion, the Project seeks to replicate the overall approach used under the AADP, \n25. \nbut  greater \nin  agribusiness  development,  marketing,  and  diversification  of \nparticipating  financial  institutions  and  the  addition  of  a  component  to  address  pasture  and \norchard  management  are  expected  to  lead  to  an  even  more  successful  area  development \nproject in the south. \n\ninvestment \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND IX GRANT COMPONENT \n \n\nConstraints to Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  will  provide  financing  of  $20  million  for  the  Southern \n1. \nAgriculture Area Development Project. Of this total, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is \nrequesting  an  Asian  Development  Fund  IX  grant  allocation  of  $5  million  to  finance  (i)  farmer \ntraining and village advisory services; (ii) pasture land management; (iii) orchard management; \n(iv) project management; (v) international consultants; and (vi) national consultants. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  crop,  livestock,  and  agro-industrial  subsectors  continue  to  experience  substantial \nadjustments. Agriculture continues to underperform, as many of the farms and agroprocessing \nfacilities  are  not  operating  efficiently,  are  not  profitable,  and  in  some  cases  are  not  financially \nviable.  \n \n3. \nThe vast majority of arable land has been distributed since 1994. A functional land lease \nmarket  exists,  but  the  land  sales  market  is  largely  inactive.  Moreover,  the  Land  Redistribution \nFund consists of 25% of arable land that was not distributed, intended partly for allocation to the \npoorest  members  of  society  and  those  returning  to  the  country  after  the  land  distribution \nprocess. The fund is managed by aiyl okmotu, and land is mostly leased on a competitive basis. \nHowever,  the  transparency  and  competitiveness  of  the  leasing  process  vary.  The  Land \nRedistribution  Fund  limits  the  amount  of  land  that  is  available  for  the  private  lease  and  sales \nmarket.  \n \n4. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  three  different  levels  of  pasture  land,  and  the  current \nadministration  by  three  different  levels  of  government,  the  monitoring  of  pasture  use  and \npasture  quality  by  the  State  Land  Development  Institute,  and  the  existence  of  forest  farms, \nwhich  lease  out  pastures  from  the  Forest  Fund,  make  the  current  pasture  administration  and \nmanagement system unsustainable. In addition to the lack of transparency, the leasing system \nis  too  complicated  to  be  widely  applied,  there  is  no  effective  monitoring  of  the  conditions  of \npasture land, and no investments are made to improve access to and the quality of pastures. \n \n5. \nThe  supply  of  agricultural  inputs  is  largely  in  private  sector  hands.  Agrochemicals  are \navailable,  but  verification  of  their  origins  and  quality  is  not  always  satisfactory.  In  addition,  the \nequipment for applying fertilizer is often inaccurate and presents a danger to the health of users. \nDemand  for  inputs  is  constrained  by  a  lack  of  finance.  Development  of  the  seed  sector  is \nconstrained by (i) the loss of contacts with traditional customers in the former Soviet Union and \nEastern  Europe;  (ii)  the  limited  resources  of  the  research  institutes,  which  are  responsible  for \nfield testing before certification by the seeds inspectorate; and (iii) the absence of arrangements \nfor  royalty  payments.  Furthermore,  seed  multiplication  and  distribution  is  concentrated  in  the \nhands  of  a  small  number  of  large  farms  that  remain  largely  unreformed  because  of  their \nstrategic status.  \n \n6. \nThe  small  sizes  of  farms,  the  relative  abundance  of  labor  (largely  female)  despite  high \nlevels of migration, and the unsuitability of the remaining large-scale machinery, which is also in \na  poor  state  of  repair,  mean  that  the  demand  for  and  the  supply  of  machinery  services  are \nlimited.  \n \n7. \nThe Kyrgyz  Republic is highly dependent on irrigated agriculture, with 80% (1.1 million \nhectares) of the 1.4 million hectares of arable land in the country being irrigated. Constraints to \nefficient  water  management  exist  at  the  national,  oblast,  raion,  and  water  user  association \n(WUA)  levels.  WUAs  are  responsible  for  the  ownership  and  management  of  onfarm  irrigation \nsystems. The Department of Water Resources of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, \nand Processing Industry is responsible for off-farm drainage and irrigation. In addition, the 434 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n51 \n\nWUAs  across  the  country,  which  have  inherited  dilapidated  irrigation  and  drainage  systems, \nrequire  further  support  and  training.  Even  though  more  than  a  third  of  existing  systems  have \nbeen rehabilitated, a vast area still requires rehabilitation.  \n \n8. \nSince  1991,  livestock  previously  concentrated  in  a  relatively  small  number  of  collective \nfarms  were  dispersed  among  a  large  number  of  households,  but  at  the  same  time,  the \nveterinary system declined because of budget cuts. Staff numbers declined rapidly and the free \nsupply  of  drugs  ceased.  The  current  veterinary  service  does  not  have  the  right  staff,  budget, \nworking  conditions,  and  facilities  to  fulfill  the  tasks  required  to  deal  with  the  minimum  public \nveterinary  tasks  of  legislation,  regulation,  control,  and  monitoring;  however,  private  veterinary \npractices have not developed quickly enough to fill the vacuum. \n \n9. \nThe value added to agricultural production is limited. The agroprocessing sector is weak, \nand  even  though  it  is  recovering,  it  is  not  growing  as  fast  as  the  agriculture  sector.  Existing \nprocessing units face difficulties in securing raw materials of consistent quantity and quality from \nsmall farmers because of the low level of farm productivity; the weak contractual arrangements, \nwhich both parties often dishonor; and the poor collection, storage, and cooling facilities. Border \naccess is a major problem for both farmers and agribusinesses in the south.  \n \n10. \nThe Rural Advisory Service is well established and has a national network that includes \nseven oblast offices and a system of raion-based advisers. The quality of services provided by \nthe Rural Advisory Service varies among oblasts. Outreach is low at around 25% of all villages \nand 6% of farmers within each village.  \n \n11. \nThe  research  institutes  lack  clear  research  strategies  and  the  resources  to  implement \nthem. Farmers and the extension services perceive research to be irrelevant to farmers\u2019 needs, \nand the link between research and extension is weak.  \n \n12. \nfaces  both  supply-side  and  demand-side \nconstraints.  The  demand-side  constraints  are  a  result  of  low  farm  productivity  and  farmers\u2019 \nperceptions of  borrowing  for  cash crop  production  as  being  high  risk  and  the  interest  rates  as \nbeing  excessively  high.  Only  about  5%  of  commercial  bank  lending  is  for  agriculture,  storage, \nand agroprocessing. The exception is the Kyrgyz Agriculture Finance Corporation, which lends \nonly  to  the  agriculture  sector  and  has  a  loan  portfolio  of  $38.20  million,1 of  which  8%  is  for \nagroprocessing. The Financial Company for Savings and Credit Unions was established under \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s Rural Financial Institutions Project to develop and finance credit \nunions.  The  company  currently  has  assets  of  $10  million.  German  development  cooperation \nthrough Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency for Technical \nCooperation) has also provided technical assistance for the Financial Company for Savings and \nCredit  Unions.  Considerable  unmet  demand  for  microfinance  loans  exists  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s medium-term microfinance development \nstrategy  estimates  unmet  demand  for  loans  by  farms  and  enterprises  of  between  $24  million \nand  $40  million  and  unmet  demand  from  poor  households  of  between  $14  million  and  $18 \nmillion.  \n \nB.  \n \n14. \n \n\nTable A5.1 summarizes the cost estimates for the grant.  \n\nThe  provision  of  agricultural \n\nProposed Activities \n\nfinance \n\n                                                 \n1  Estimated  from  National  Bank  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  2005.

The  follow-on  strategy\u2014the  Country  Development  Strategy  2007\u20132010 1 \u2014indicates  that  the  agriculture \nsector  will  continue  to  be  a  priority.    Both  the  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  2003\u20132005  and  the  country \ndevelopment  strategy  2006\u20132010  are  medium-term  plans  for  implementing  the  comprehensive  development \nframework 2010, which aims to reduce income poverty from 52.3% in 2000 to 26.5% in 2010. So far, the country is on \ntrack  to  achieve  this  goal:  the  incidence  of  income  poverty  has  fallen  steadily,  reaching  39%  in  2003.2   However, \ncontinuous  efforts  in  relation  to  pro-poor  growth  are  needed  to  achieve  the  comprehensive  development  framework \n2010 goal as well as Millennium Development Goal 1.  \n \nThe agriculture sector accounted for more than 33% of gross domestic product in 2000\u20132004. When combined  with \nagroprocessing and agriculture services and trade, the agriculture sector contributes more than 40% of gross domestic \nproduct.  The  sector  also  accounts  for  more  than  50%  of  total  employment. 3  With  a  shrinking  nonagricultural \nemployment  market,  reliance  on  the  agriculture  sector  has  been  growing,  which  has  led  to  economic  growth  since \n1996. The continuous growth in the sector caused by the shift from subsistence agriculture to commercial production \nwill  have  a  significant  positive  effect  on  the  growth  of  other  sectors  through  increased  demand  for  nonagriculture \nproducts by rural households, as well as on employment.   \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis has been carried out?  \nThe social assessment carried out as part of Project preparation4 included the following types of poverty analysis: (i) \nsocioeconomic poverty  profiles in the proposed project areas, and (ii)  impact of the Project on poverty and the  poor \nfrom the perspective of equity or inclusiveness. The experience of the ongoing Agriculture Area Development Project \nand the World Bank-assisted Onfarm Irrigation Project provided a significant amount of information related to poverty \nand institutional and social impacts.  As the Project is categorized as a general intervention, a full poverty analysis was \nnot conducted. \n \nPoverty  Data.  During  project  preparation,  geographic  targeting  of  poorer  raions  (was  considered  as  one  of  the \nselection criteria using the most widely available poverty classification (nonpoor, poor, very poor, and extremely poor) \nupon  which  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection  bases  the  provision  of  social  assistance.    However,  the \nProject\u2019s social assessment confirmed the unreliability of the data because of the widespread practice of households \nmaking informal payments to local government staff so as to obtain social assistance. Hence the geographic targeting \nwas  dropped.  Nonetheless,  available  information  indicates  the  generally  high  incidence  of  poverty  in  the  southern \noblasts.  According to the National Statistics Committee, compared with the 42.9% incidence of poverty at the national \nlevel in 2004, the poverty level in Batken, the poorest oblast, was 77.8%, with rural poverty standing at 82.9%.  Using \ndata from the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, which uses monthly household incomes as thresholds, 57% of \nthe population of the nine proposed project raions were classified as below the poverty line (i.e., poor, very poor, and \nextremely poor) in 2005. \n\n                                                 \n1   The Country Development Study 2007-2010 has been approved by the Government and submitted to Parliament \n\nfor its consideration. \n\n2   Starting  from  2003,  a  new  poverty  line  was  adopted  and  the  consumption-based  poverty  measurement  was \nofficially adopted. Using the new poverty line, the incidence of poverty was 43.5% in 2005, compared with 47.9% in \n2003 and 42.9% in 2004.   \n\n3   ADB. 2006. TA 4438 Final Report. Manila (July). \n4   It  involved  (i)  a  literature  review  and  a  statistical  review;  (ii)  a  household  survey  of  92  households,  including  33 \nfemale household heads; (iii) a series of focus group discussions; and (iv) a number of semistructured interviews \nwith key stakeholders.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n65 \n\nLand  and  Cropping  Patterns.  Distinctions  between  the  population  living  in  the  uplands  (32%  of  that  in  the  three \noblasts) and the lowlands (68%) are important in terms of landholding size, cropping patterns, and poverty. A typical \nupland  farmer  in  the  proposed  project  area  has  0.5  hectares  (ha)  of  irrigated  arable  land,  0.72  ha  of  rainfed  arable \nland, and access to 12 ha of village pastures.  Upland farmers typically grow cereal crops, sunflowers, and potatoes \nand other cash crops. Jalalabad is unique in its production of walnuts and pistachios on land leased from forest farms \n(administered nationally) or local administrations. Livestock is an important source of cash income. The incidence of \npoverty is higher among upland farmers than among lowland farmers. A typical lowland farmer has 0.6 ha of irrigated \narable land, 0.29 ha of rainfed arable land and access to an average of 3 ha of village pastures. Lowland farmers tend \nto  grow  cereal  crops,  sunflowers,  cotton,  vegetables,  and  fruit  trees,  and  also  engage  in  some  livestock  production. \nBoth upland and lowland farmers achieve basic household food security, but their financial security is fragile and they \nexperience  a  cash  deficit  most  of  the  year  that  often  leads  to  some  accumulation  of  debt.  Farmers\u2019  mechanisms  for \ncoping  with  financial  difficulties  include  economic  migration  (to  Kazakhstan,  to  Russia,  and  sometimes  to  the  city  of \nBishkek), which is most prevalent in Batken; sale of assets; leasing their lands; sales of fruit, milk, and other produce \nfrom  their  household  plots,  which  are  normally  for  household  consumption;  and  borrowing  money.  Demand  for \naffordable credit is high. Livestock is becoming an increasingly popular means of livelihood, increasing the pressure on \nland degradation. \n \nWhile the vast majority of land has been distributed since 1994, the land sales market is largely inactive. Even though \nthe  southern  oblasts  have  been  ahead  of  the  north  in  relation  to  land  distribution,  legal  disputes  related  to  unclear \nownership,  restrictions  on  land  use,  restrictions  on  women\u2019s  rights  to  inherit  land,  and  other  issues  are  still  not \nuncommon. Twenty-five percent of arable land has been earmarked for the Land Redistribution Fund, administered by \naiyl okmotu, at least 20% of which has to be leased to poor households at preferential rates. However, the capacity to \nimplement  Land  Redistribution  Fund  management  varies  across  aiyl  okmotu  and  is  generally  low.  In  addition, \nhousehold size is typically large, especially for the bottom quintile of the population, which has an average of 6.1 family \nmembers per household, and this contributes to the problem of land fragmentation.   \n \nSocial Cohesion. Although much progress has been made in terms of structural reforms, the erosion of social capital \n(e.g.,  mutual  community  trust  and  assistance)  continues,  accelerated  by  migration  and  growing  gaps  between  the \nbetter-off  and  the  poor  within  communities.  The  extent  of  migration,  which  is  more  frequent  among  men,  is  not  well \ndocumented, but various interviews with locals indicate that migration averages 20\u201330% of the male population. While \nthe  traditional  mutual  help  systems,  such  as  ashar  (mutual  exchange  of  labor  among  kin  and  neighbors)  still  exist \namong poorer households, the better-off tend to set up social networks along with production functions. Conflicts and \ntensions over water and, to a lesser extent, land is common. Most cases are resolved within the community, e.g., by \nthe dispute resolution commissions of water user associations (WUAs), but some WUAs report court cases.  \n \nSocial  Accountability.  During  the  Project\u2019s  social  assessment,  fewer  than  40%  of  household  survey  respondents \nbelieved  that  aiyl  okmotu  represented  community  members\u2019  needs.  Community  members,  and  especially  the  poor, \noften see aiyl okmotu leaders as abusing their power in relation to deciding who is eligible for access to credit, training, \nand agricultural inputs and machinery. WUAs, whose membership ranges from 500 to 2,500 households, are too large \nfor a community-based institution and are often perceived as a replica of aiyl okmotu. More than half the respondents \ndid  not  know  what  the  WUAs\u2019  objectives  were,  as  the  training  and  communications  provided  by  the  Department  of \nWater  Resources  to  the  WUA  support  units  focuses  on  WUA  councils  and  not  on  the  members.  Smaller \nneighborhood-based self-help groups,  which are often organized by local nongovernment organizations (NGOs), are \nconsidered to be more important and more relevant to the average farmer. The implication for the project design is that \nthe selection of village advisers, farmer field school trainees, and WUA subgroup leaders will have a major impact on \nproject effectiveness, and that the process of selection will need to be transparent to community members. \n  \nBorder  Issues. Tensions over water sometimes go beyond the community level and may become a border issue. In \nthe raion of Kadamjay in Batken Oblast, for example, most aiyl okmotu border Uzbekistan. The Isfara River flows in \nand  out  of  both  countries  several  times.  WUA  members  in  Markaz,  Kadamjay,  reported  a  case  to  the  project \npreparation team in which the upstream Uzbek community diverted water away from the Markaz community and the \nlatter  retaliated  by  asking  another  Kyrgyz  community  to  stop  the  flow  of  water  back  to  the  Uzbekistan  side.  Similar \ncases have also been reported in other parts of the oblast. The unique border between the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan \nand Uzbekistan, as well as the existence of a number of enclaves of Uzbek territory within Batken, make cross-border \ntrade and free movement difficult. Efforts by NGOs such as Mercy Corps to build peace at a community level across \nborders in the Ferghana Valley have been stalled since the Andijon incident in Uzbekistan in 2005.  \n \nEthnicity. While the south includes a mosaic of ethnic groups (Kyrgyz 70.0%; Uzbeks 27.0%; Russians 1.0%; Tajiks \n0.6%;  and  others  such  as  Tartars,  Turks, and  Uighurs),  habitation  patterns  in  rural  communities  are  generally  along \nethnic lines. In the project areas, available information indicates that discrimination against minorities is unlikely to be \nan issue, while the tension between the two dominant ethnic groups (Kyrgyz and Uzbeks) may be an issue, particularly \nacross the border. Within communities, the approach should not be to protect any particular group, but to ensure equal \nopportunities for all ethnic groups through broader community participation.         \n \n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nGender. As detailed below and in the gender action plan, men and women are experiencing the transition and poverty \ndifferently. Unlike other neighboring ethnic groups, the Kyrgyz enjoyed relatively equal partnerships between the two \ngenders  until  the  Soviet  system  collapsed.  The  increasing  pressure  on  women\u2019s  reproductive  role  resulting  from  the \nerosion of the social safety net; the increasing vulnerability of women because of the re-emergence of old traditions; \nthe  perceptions  in  relation  to  women  and  girls  manifested  in  bride  theft,  polygamy,  domestic  violence,  and  human \ntrafficking;  and  the  growing  gender  disparities  in  public  representation  and  employment  opportunities  are  notable.  In \nthe south, while women account for 70% of the labor force in agriculture, opportunities related to training, credit, and \ndecision making are especially limited in the agriculture sector. The feminization of agriculture is particularly prevalent \nin the south, where many men (although also women) migrate to the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and Bishkek.     \n \nProject  Impact  on  Poverty  and  the  Poor.  The  Project  is  categorized  as  a  general  intervention,  as  its  direct \nbeneficiaries  are  farming  households  with  small  allocated  land  plots  in  the  project  area,  which  includes  about  nine \nraions  in the three southern oblasts of Batken, Jalalabad, and Osh.  The primary beneficiary group in the short term \nwill  be  those  male  and  female  farmers  who  are  capable  of  taking  risks  to  expand  their  production  and  marketing  by \ncapturing the opportunities provided by the Project.    \n \nThe  development  of  a  strategic  nucleus  is  a  prerequisite  for  employment  generation  based  on  agriculture  and \nagroindustry  and  an  increase  in  household  incomes  among  a  larger  group  of  poor  households  in  the  medium  term. \nThe  Project  also  complements  a  number  of  interventions  by  other  funding  agencies  and  NGOs  in  the  project  area \nspecifically targeted at the poor and the marginalized, including female-headed farm households, e.g., the US Agency \nfor  International  Development  through  Winrock  International  and  Mercy  Corps,  the  European  Union,  German \ndevelopment  cooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit,  SDC  (Swiss  Agency  for \nDevelopment  and  Cooperation)  United  Nations  Development  for  Women,  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  and \nDevelopment, and the Community Development Investment Agency.  \n \nFurthermore, the following inclusive elements of the Project will enhance its pro-poor nature:  (i) the inclusion of pro-\npoor  activities  in  the  service  provider  contracts  where  possible,  such  as  the  provision  of  training  in  household  plot \nmanagement,  vegetable  growing,  livestock  breeding,  and  other  topics  of  concern  to  the  poor;  (ii)  the  inclusion  of \nmicrofinance wholesaler support in the credit component in addition to the provision of finance for agribusinesses; (iii) \nthe enhanced  awareness raising among members and households  in relation to the functions and responsibilities of \nWUAs, not just among WUA council members; and (iv) the participatory nature of community-based planning for land \nuse  and  natural  resource  management  (e.g.,  of  pastures)  through  participatory  rural  appraisal  and  other  community \nmobilization processes.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nDuring project preparation, stakeholder analyses and extensive stakeholder consultations were conducted at a various \nlevels,  including  (i)  institutional  analysis  of  value  chain  actors  and  supporters,  (ii)  social  assessment,  (iii)  three \nparticipatory stakeholder workshops,5 and (iv) WUA selection meetings. The value chain stakeholder analysis included \na strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis for each key institution, leading to the final design of the \nagribusiness  component.  Each  project  component  involves  a different  set  of  stakeholders,  but  these  can  broadly  be \ncategorized  as  (i)  private  sector  service  providers,  e.g.,  farm  advisory  service  providers,  legal  service  providers, \nfinancial \ninput  suppliers,  machinery  contractors,  and \ncooperatives;  (ii)  central  ministries,  including  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Water  Resources,  and  Processing  Industry \nand others represented on the Project Steering Committee); (iii) local administrations,  that is, oblasts, raions and, aiyl \nokmotu; (iv) community groups, e.g., WUAs and livestock and pasture management committees; (v) individual farmer \nbeneficiaries (male and female, local elite and poor); and (iv) funding agencies and civil society groups working in the \nsector  or  in  the  project  oblasts.  The  key  institutional  approach  of  the  Project  is  to  establish  effective  links  between \nthese  stakeholders  to  promote  pro-poor  growth.  In  particular,  performance-based  contracts  will  be  used  with  the \nprivate sector partners to provide appropriate incentives. \n  \nIs there a participation strategy? \nParticipatory  processes  at  the  community  level  are  crucial  to  avoid  unnecessary  conflicts,  especially  over  water;  to \nprevent from creating a sense of inequality along ethnic lines; and to alleviate the helplessness and cynicism of those \ngroups  that  are  often  excluded  within  the  community,  such  as  the  poor  and  women.  The  financial  and  institutional \nsustainability  of  WUAs  and  community-based  pasture  management  institutions  depends  on  the  accountability  and \ninclusiveness forged by the participatory process.  \n \n \n\ninstitutions,  agribusiness  advisory  service  providers, \n\n   Yes (Appendix 12 Community Participation Plan)          \n\n   No   \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n                                                 \n5   Financed  by  ADB.  2004.

The welfare cuts and the disappearance of child care support \nthrough  collective  farms  and  state  farms  disproportionately  affected  women\u2019s  competitiveness  in  the  labor  market, \ndriving them to take up lower-paid work. In the south, where mechanization of crop production is less advanced than in \nthe north, women\u2019s contribution to agricultural labor is higher and is reported to be around 70% of the total labor force \nin  the  sector.  One  impact  study  among  customers  and  noncustomers  of  members  of  the  Association  of \nAgribusinessmen  of  Kyrgyzstan  indicates  that  as  production  increases,  women\u2019s  workload  as  sellers  of  agricultural \nproduce  increases.  Their  contribution  to  farm  household  incomes  is  significant,  especially  in  the  south,  but  their \nrepresentation  in decision making in  water  management, farm development training,  and agribusiness enterprises is \nmarginal.  About  10%  of  all  farm  households  are  headed  by  women.  Even  though  the  incidence  of  poverty  is \nstatistically  higher  among  male-headed  households  than  female-headed  households,  female  household  heads  are \ndisadvantaged in terms of access to fair representation and services.  \n \nThe key gender issues relevant to the Project include (i) the hesitance of women  when self-selecting for agricultural \ntraining and community representation because of pressures to follow social norms that view women as secondary to \nmen,  lack  of  self-confidence  to  enter  into  male-dominated  activities,  and  lack  of  time;  (ii)  the  low  representation  of \nwomen on WUA councils, the WUA directorate (i.e., paid positions), and audit and dispute resolution committees and \nas WUA village leaders, leading to their lack of understanding of the entire cropping system; (iii) the concentration on \nsmall-scale activities (e.g., household plots, microenterprises for a small amount of agricultural produce, demand for \nsmall loans over a long-term repayment period); and (iv) the customary law constraints to owning land in the case of \ndivorce or for daughters who are married (if such cases are brought to courts, they would be obliged to divide the land \nunder  written  law,  but  women  tend  to  resort  to  local  religious  leaders,  clan  leaders,  or  the  Court  of  Aksakal,  which \napply customary laws). Women also express interest in going beyond so-called women\u2019s projects such as handicrafts \nto learn about new agricultural techniques, and the Project offers a great opportunity to satisfy such emerging needs. \nThe Project\u2019s gender action plan will address these issues to the extent possible. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

No  works  will  be \ncarried  out  during  cropping  seasons  to  avoid  damage  to \ncrops.  Therefore  no  land  acquisition  or  displacement  is \nenvisaged.   \n \n \n\nThe  pricing  of  services  provided  by  the  Project  has  fully \nconsidered  beneficiaries\u2019  repayment  capacity.  Farm  and \nagribusiness  advisory  services  will  be  provided  free  of \ncharge under the Project, although each service provider \nwill  carefully  look  into  charging  for  some  of  the  services \nin the long term. Basic legal advisory services will be free \nof charge to farmers. Existing cost-recovery  methods  as \nspecified by relevant laws and regulations will be applied \nto  credit  and  irrigation  and  drainage.  Therefore,  the \nProject  will  not  introduce  any  significant  affordability \nissues. \n\nPlan  \nRequired \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\n\fPlan  \nRequired \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\nStrategy to  \nAddress Issues \n\n \nThe  country  is  a  signatory  to  the  International  Labour \nOrganization Convention 182 (Worst Forms of Child Labor \nConvention  1999).  The  Government  assured  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  that  the  Project  will  coordinate  with \nongoing  programs  by  other  development  partners  in  the \nproject area to prevent the worst forms of child labor.  \n \nFor any works to be contracted under the Project, contract \ndocuments  will  be  prepared  such  that  contractors  will \ncomply with the country\u2019s labor legislation (e.g., minimum \nsafe  working \nwages,  gender-equal  wages,  and \nthe  Project \nin \nincluded \nconditions).  This  has  been \nassurances.  \n \n \nThe  ethnic  composition  in  the  three  southern  oblasts  is \ndominated by the two key groups (Kyrgyz 70% and Uzbek \n27%), with Osh having a higher Uzbek population than the \ntwo other oblasts. Minority groups include Russians (1%), \nTajiks (0.6%), and others such as Tartars, Turks, Uighurs, \nbut  they  live  mostly  in  cities.  Experience  from  ongoing \nprograms  by  other  development  partners  indicates  that \ndiscrimination  in  Project  activities  based  on  ethnicity  is \nunlikely. Conflicts about water allocation occur across the \nborder between the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan, but \nnot  typically  within  the  same  community  across  different \nindigenous  peoples \nethnic  groups.  Therefore  an \ndevelopment  plan  will  not  be  necessary.  However,  the \nProject\u2019s  community  participation  plan  will  ensure  that \ninformation about services provided by the Project will be \nwidely  shared  among  community  members  and  that  all \nethnic  groups  will  be  given  a  fair  chance  to  select \ncommunity leaders to represent them.   \n \n \nThe  Project  may  risk  widening  the  gap  between  the \nbetter-off  and  the  poor.
