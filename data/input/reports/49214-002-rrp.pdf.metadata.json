The report also describes the proposed administration of a \nloan  to  be  provided  by  the  Clean  Technology  Fund  (CTF)  for  the  Solar  Transmission  Sector \nProject,1 and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the loan.2  \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  finance  high-voltage  transmission  systems  to  evacuate  electricity \ngenerated  by  new  mega  solar  parks  to  the  interstate  grid,  and  improve  the  reliability  of  the \nnational  grid  system.  The  project  will  be  based  on  the  sector  loan  approach,  and  will  include \nsubprojects  in  various  locations  throughout  India.  It  will  also  use  the  country  safeguard  and \nprocurement systems at the agency level. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSector background. India is experiencing both base load and peak power deficits. The \nlack of a reliable electricity supply is constraining India\u2019s economic growth and making it difficult \nfor  around  311  million  people  to  access  electricity.3 Despite  such  constraints,  the  demand  for \nelectricity  is  continually  increasing  in  step  with  sustained  industrialization,  an  expanded \nconsumer  market,  and  enhanced  economic  development.4 Demand  for  power  is  projected  to \nmore than double from about 300 gigawatts (GW) in 2016 to over 700 GW by 2030.5 It will be \nchallenging  to  meet  such  capacity  addition  through  a  conventional  power  supply  approach. \nIndia\u2019s power system is dominated by thermal generation from coal-fired plants, and fossil fuels \nhave created several problems, including domestic production shortages, volatile prices due to \nincreased  imports,  and  adverse  climate  impacts.  To  ensure  sustainable  energy  security,  the \ngovernment has updated its strategy to provide future additional generating capacity through an \nenergy  mix,  and  has  increased  its  renewable  energy  target  for  2022.6 At  the  Conference  of \nParties 21 in Paris in 2015, the government further committed to increase its cumulative power \ncapacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources to 40% by 2030.7 \n \n4. \nNational  solar  mission.  This  ambitious  target  is  based  on  a  greater  use  of  solar  and \nwind  power.  In  2015,  the  Jawarharlal  Nehru  National  Solar  Mission\u2019s  target  for  2022  was \nrevised  from  20  GW  (its  aim  in  2010)  to  100  GW,  comprising  an  installed  capacity  of  40  GW \nfrom  rooftop  solar  projects,  and  60  GW  from  utility-scale  projects.  In  support  of  rooftop  solar \ndeployment,  the  government  has  been  encouraging  states  to  enact  model  net-metering \nregulations, and enabling financing through commercial banks to facilitate market growth in this \n\n                                                \n1  Financed  by  the  CTF,  a  funding  window  of  the  Climate  Investment  Funds  that  provides  middle-income  and \ndeveloping countries with resources to scale up the demonstration, deployment, and transfer of low-carbon, clean \ntechnologies. \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  World Bank. 2015. Power for All: Electricity Access Challenge in India. Washington, DC.  \n4  India\u2019s per capita electricity consumption is about one-third of the global average. \n5  International Energy Agency. 2015. India Energy Outlook: World Energy Outlook Special Report. Paris. \n6  As  of  June  2016,  the  country\u2019s  total  grid-connected  renewable  energy  capacity  accounted  for  around  44  GW  of \nIndia\u2019s  total  installed  power  generation  capacity  of  305  GW.  Installed  renewable  energy  sources  comprise  wind \n(27.2 GW), solar (7.8 GW), biomass (4.8 GW), and small hydropower (4.3 GW). \n7  The government ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change on 2 October 2016. \n\n\f2 \n\nsector.8 Utility-scale  solar  projects  are  supported  through  various  incentives,  including  capital \nsubsidies, customs concessions, and accelerated depreciation. Of the targeted 100 GW, 20 GW \nof installed solar capacity will be realized through 34 solar parks known as the Ultra Mega Solar \nPower Projects.9 The policy and regulatory framework assumes that the private sector will play \na  major  role  in  solar  power  generation,  while  the  public  sector  will  be  responsible  for  the \nassociated transmission facilities for grid integration, including offtake arrangements. \n \n5. \nSolar  park  development.  The  solar  parks  scheme  seeks  to  address  the  time  and \nexpense  involved  in  obtaining  suitable  land  in  remote  areas,  providing  accessibility,  and \npromoting  clearances  for  each  project,  all  of  which  have  been  identified  as  key  development \nbarriers  to  solar  expansion  in  India.  Solar  parks  provide  solar  power  developers  (independent \npower  producers  and/or  investors)  with  access  to  a  site  with  all  necessary  government \nclearances, basic infrastructure such as transmission systems, water access, road connectivity, \nand  communication  networks,  for  a  leasing  fee.  As  well  as  accelerating  the  development  of \nsolar power, these projects are also anticipated to yield lower tariffs due to economies of scale \nresulting from the development of large plots of land that can host several solar park projects.10 \nThe  government  is  providing  capital  subsidies  through  solar  park  development  to  lower \ninvestment costs for solar power producers and, ultimately, lower solar power purchase tariffs. \nStates with sufficient institutional capacity are developing the parks through state utilities, while \nothers are forming joint ventures  between the government-owned Solar Energy Corporation of \nIndia, state utilities, and/or private parties for solar park development.11 \n \n6. \nSolar  park  transmission.  The  transmission  line  expansion  associated  with  the  solar \nparks is being carried out by either the state transmission companies or the central transmission \nutility,  POWERGRID.12 The  transmission  infrastructure  required  to  increase  the  penetration  of \nsolar  energy  remains  the  responsibility  of  the  public  sector.  Despite  the  recent  decrease  in \nproject  costs,  solar  power  remains  more  expensive  than  conventional  power  in  India  and \nimposes an additional cost burden to integrate the associated variable power generation into the \ngrid. The government has thus declared transmission expansions connecting solar parks to be \npart of the interstate transmission system, with costs socialized across the entire network. This \nwill ensure that connection costs do not further increase tariffs for solar power developers.13 The \nuse  of  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  resources,  including  the  CTF,  to  finance  this \ntransmission  expansion  will  substantially  reduce  the  cost  of  connecting  the  solar  parks  to  the \n\n                                                \n8  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2016.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board of  Directors: \nProposed  Multitranche  Financing  Facility  and  Administration  of  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  Punjab \nNational  Bank  for  the  Solar  Rooftop  Investment  Program  (Guaranteed  by  India).  Manila.  The  program  includes \nCTF cofinancing. \n\n9  Each solar park will have a generation capacity of 500 megawatts (MW) or more. \n10 The  solar  power  developers  can  be  selected  in  the  bids.  The  2016  solar  project  auctions  for  the  solar  park  in \nBhadla,  Rajasthan,  indicated  a  bid  tariff  of  \u20b94.00  per  kilowatt-hour,  a  decrease  of  one-third  from  the  pioneering \nfeed-in-tariff of \u20b912.54 per kilowatt-hour that was set out for solar power in Gujarat in 2010. \n\n11 As some state distribution utilities are financially distressed, central entities such as the Solar Energy Corporation \nof  India  and  National  Thermal  Power  Corporation  are  involved  in  offtake  arrangements  between  solar  power \ndevelopers  and  selective  offtake  utilities.  To  incentivize  competitive  solar  power  tariffs  in  the  bid  selections,  the \ngovernment  also  provides  operational  subsidies  for  developers  in  the  solar  parks  that  sell  solar  power  to  state \ndistribution utilities. \n\n12 When at least 50% of the power produced at a park will be consumed within the host state, the state transmission \ncompany may choose to build the transmission network. POWERGRID may be asked to expand the transmission \nlines for the remaining parks. \n\n13 In January 2016, the National Tariff Policy was amended to include (i) no interstate transmission charges on solar \npower,  and  (ii)  a  renewable  power  obligation  to  purchase  8%  of  the  distribution  utilities\u2019  electricity  consumption, \nparticularly from solar energy, by March 2022. POWERGRID is allowed to charge solar power-related transmission \ncosts on other grid users in the form of cross-subsidization. \n\n\f3 \n\nexisting transmission network, ultimately minimizing the transmission charges paid by grid users \nand end-customers. \n \n7. \nADB  interventions.  ADB  was  one  of  the  first  institutions  to  develop  the  solar  parks\u2019 \ntransmission  systems  for  state  utilities  in  Gujarat  and  Rajasthan.14 While  various  donors  and \nmultilateral development banks are widely involved in renewable energy development projects, \nthe CTF has been allocated to ADB and the World Bank to support solar rooftop projects, solar \nparks, and the associated transmission infrastructure.15 \n \n8. \nSince  1995,  ADB  has  provided  POWERGRID  with  eight  sovereign-guaranteed  loans \nand two nonsovereign loans to strengthen its national transmission system. The projects have a \ngood implementation history and satisfactory ratings. In 2015, ADB provided loans for the Green \nEnergy Corridor and Grid Strengthening Project,16 which was based on the National Smart Grid \nMission to connect renewable resource-rich areas to the long-distance interregional grid through \nhigh-voltage,  direct-current  technology.  This  follow-on  project  for  interstate  transmission  for \nsolar  parks  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2013\u20132017. 17 \nPOWERGRID  remains  responsible  for  planning,  developing,  and  operating  the  high-voltage \ninterstate  and  interregional  power transmission network.  It  has  a  sound implementation record \nin  upgrading  and  strengthening  the  national  transmission  network  system,  and  its  operational \nperformance is consistently good. \n \n9. \nProject  design.  The  government  asked  ADB  to  provide  continued  support  for  the \ninterstate  transmission  system  for  solar  parks,  because  it  aims  to  scale  up  the  country\u2019s \ninstalled  solar  capacity  drastically  but  in  a  phased  manner.  A  series  of  solar  parks  have  been \nidentified,  but  their  development  and  preparation  processes  differ. 18  The  sector  lending \napproach is therefore considered suitable as it will enable POWERGRID to expand transmission \nlines to individual solar parks according to the planned commissioning of solar parks, based on \ntheir  readiness.  This  approach  is  warranted  based  on  the  government\u2019s  development  plan, \npolicies, and strategies, as well as POWERGRID\u2019s implementation capacity. \n \n10. \nAdoption  of  the  agency\u2019s  safeguard  and  procurement  systems.  As  a  special \nfeature,  the  project  will  use  POWERGRID\u2019s  safeguard  and  procurement  systems,  which  have \nbeen assessed and deemed satisfactory to ADB, along with agreed action plans, to comply fully \nwith  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  and  procurement  requirements  (paras.  21\u201322).  The  adoption  of  the \nagency\u2019s  systems  is  expected  to  improve  operational  flexibility  and  autonomy,  and  reduce \ntransaction  costs  and  the  time  required  for  the  safeguard  and  procurement  processes  of \nsubsequent subprojects, in conjunction with the sector loan approach. \n \n11. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  By  supporting  the  construction  of  interstate \ntransmission systems for the Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects, the project will provide a means \nof  exporting  excess  solar  energy  from  states  with  surplus  power  to  power-deficit  states  and \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2011.

It  will  thus  enable  power  trading  across  larger \ngeographical  areas,  which is  considered  a prerequisite to deploy  high penetrations  of  variable \nrenewable energy effectively. The resultant power output profiles will differ greatly from India\u2019s \ncurrent  generation  mix,  which  is  dominated  by  thermal  plants,  and  substantiate  India\u2019s \ncontribution to climate mitigation. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe impact will be increased share of clean energy in the power mix; increased overall \nefficiency  of  the  power  system;  and  enhanced  energy  security  in  India.  The  outcome  will  be \nexpanded supply of clean power to the national transmission system. \n \nC. \n \nThe  project\u2019s  outputs  will  be  (i)  the  improved  capacity  of  the  interstate  transmission \n13. \nnetwork, particularly to transmit the increased supply of electricity generated from the new solar \nparks  to  the  national  grid;  and  (ii)  POWERGRID\u2019s  improved  autonomous  management  of  its \nsafeguard and procurement systems, based on its own policies and procedures satisfactory to \nADB. \n \n14. \nsubprojects: \n\nThe  sector  lending  approach  sets  out  the  following  selection  criteria  for  ADB-financed \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nThe subproject shall be technically feasible for grid improvement and expansion, \nincluding to areas where solar parks are being developed. \nThe subproject shall be financially and economically viable. \nThe  subproject  shall  not  have  environmentally  or  socially  significant  impacts \nwarranting an ADB safeguard category A. \n\n(i) \n\nto  support \n\ntransmission  grid  systems \n\n \nBased on these criteria, ADB and POWERGRID have jointly appraised two transmission \n15. \nsystems  subprojects: \nthe  evacuation  of \n2,500 megawatts  (MW)  of  power  from  solar  parks  in  Bhadla,  Rajasthan;  and  (ii)  transmission \ngrid systems to support the evacuation of 700 MW of power from a solar park in Banaskantha, \nGujarat. 20 Subsequent  subprojects  must  satisfy  the  above  criteria  and  will  be  reviewed  based \non their readiness. POWERGRID will include at least two more subprojects: (i) a grid system to \nsupport the  evacuation of  1,000  MW of  power from  a solar  park  in Tumkur,  Karnataka (phase \n2); and (ii) the upgrading of an existing high-voltage, direct-current system between Rihand and \nDadri  in Uttar  Pradesh  to improve  the  stability  of  the  transmission grid. These subprojects  will \nhelp  improve  the  grid  system\u2019s  efficiency  and  increase  solar  power  generation  by  4.2  GW, \ncontributing to saving 7,060,273 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. Each subproject will \ninclude equipment and its related work for the interstate transmission lines and grid substations. \n \nD. \n \n16. \n                                                \n19 India\u2019s tariff policy (amended in 2016) requires that utilities purchase 8% of their power from solar energy by 2022 \n(an increase from the previous target of 3%), prohibits interstate transmission charges for renewable energy, and \npromotes the development of ancillary services to facilitate the high penetration of renewable energy on the grid. \n20 At  Bhadla,  relevant  solar  park  developers  include  the  Government  of  Rajasthan,  the  Infrastructure  Leasing  and \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $450 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nFinancial Services, Adani, and Essel.

POWERGRID has set up a program management \nunit. The project will be completed by 2021 (over a 5-year period). POWERGRID has conducted \nadvance  procurement  action  with  retroactive  financing  requirements  for  advance  subprojects \nbased  on  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 23  During \nproject  appraisal,  ADB  conducted  a  detailed  assessment  of  POWERGRID\u2019s  agency \nprocurement  system  and practices.24 The  assessment found that  POWERGRID\u2019s  procurement \nsystem  generally  meets  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  procurement  policy,  and  the  procurement  risk \nrating  is  low  given  POWERGRID\u2019s  sound  track  record  over  20  years  in  ADB-financed \n                                                \n21 The principal repayment per year will be based on 2% during the first 10 years, and 4% for the remaining 20 years. \n22  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB\u2019s member country procurement eligibility restrictions were applied for the advance procurement action  while \nCTF  cofinancing  was  still  uncertain.  Since  confirming  the  CTF  cofinancing,  universal  procurement  has  been \napplied  to  the  remaining  packages  under  the  project,  since  ADB  administers  the  cofinancing  resources  from  the \nCTF commingled with OCR. Universal procurement  is also in line with POWERGRID\u2019s member country eligibility \nrequirements.  The  subsequent  subproject  in  Uttar  Pradesh  will  include  bid  packages  procured  through  direct \ncontracting. This is because the high-voltage, direct-current system will be replaced with new equipment from the \noriginal supplier to ensure technical compatibility with existing equipment. \n\n24 Agency Procurement Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f7 \n\nprocurement.  It  is  proposed  that  POWERGRID\u2019s  procurement  system  be  adopted  for  this \nproject on a pilot basis to procure any remaining packages with an estimated contract value of \n$40  million  or  less.  ADB  will  not  exercise  oversight  through  the  usual  post  or  prior  review  of \nsuch procurement, constituting an exception to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.25 To ensure that \nany such procurement is conducted in a manner consistent with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines\u2019 \nprinciples  and  procurement  practices  acceptable  to  ADB,  POWERGRID  will  also  follow  the \naction plan for procurement set out in the PAM.26  \n \nSafeguards.  ADB  has  approved  the  use  of  country  safeguard  systems  (CSS)  for \n22. \nPOWERGRID for any future projects,27 based on an equivalence and acceptability assessment \nof  POWERGRID's  Environment  and  Social  Policy  and  Procedures  (ESPP). 28  Since \nPOWERGRID agreed to implement an action plan to address some minor gaps that will ensure \nfull acceptability and equivalence with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), all subprojects \nwill be prepared in compliance with the ESPP and the action plan included in the PAM.29  \n \n23. \nSubproject  processing.  For  each  subsequent  subproject  under  the  sector  loan, \nPOWERGRID  will  be  asked  to  follow  certain  procedures,  including  (i)  carrying  out  a  technical \nfeasibility  study;  (ii)  undertaking  financial  and  economic  analyses;  (iii)  preparing  an  initial \nenvironmental  assessment  report  (IEAR)  analogous  to  an  initial  environmental  examination, \nincluding an environmental management plan; (iv) preparing a compensation plan for temporary \ndamages  (CPTD)  analogous  to  a  resettlement  plan;  and  (v)  preparing  an  indigenous  peoples \nplan,  if  necessary.  POWERGRID  will  submit  appraisal  reports  for  these  procedures  to  ADB, \nwhich will consider and approve each subproject before financing it. ADB will not consider any \nsubproject that does not satisfy all of the eligibility criteria or where the above procedures have \nnot been followed. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nPOWERGRID  has  carried  out  detailed  technical  studies  by  using  the  latest  available \npower  system  analysis  software,  and  has  confirmed  that  the  proposed  transmission  system\u2019s \ntransfer  capacity  is  adequate  to  evacuate  the  electricity  from  the  planned  solar  parks. \n                                                \n25 ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines require prior or post reviews of contract packages. Instead, ADB will spot-check bid \ndocuments, bid evaluations, and contract awards annually (at least) and as part of a midterm audit to verify that the \nprocurement was undertaken in the manner agreed with ADB. \n\n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The action plan details \nadditional requirements to satisfy minor gaps between ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and POWERGRID\u2019s Works \nand Procurement Policy and Procedures. These include the submission of a procurement plan and bid invitations \nto  ADB,  interest-free  advance  payments,  dispute  resolution  provision,  international  arbitration  for  foreign bidders, \nanticorruption  measures,  and  the  exclusion  of  e-reverse  auction.  While  the  project\u2019s  procurement  plan  has  no \ncontracts  valued  at  more  than  $40  million  (ADB\u2019s  threshold  of  international  competitive  bidding  for  India\u2019s  works \nand plant), the procurement of any such package will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n\nManila.  The  assessment  concluded  that  POWERGRID  has  a  good  track  record,  and  has  systems  in  place  that \neffectively manage environmental and social risks. \n\n28 In 1998, POWERGRID developed the ESPP as a comprehensive environmental and social management system. \nThis  was  revised  in  2009  to  integrate  guidance  and  best  practices  from  the  World  Bank.  Since  then,  the  World \nBank has used the ESPP under its use of country systems pilot program for environmental and social safeguards. \n29 Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The  action  plan  has \nbeen agreed with POWERGRID as a result of the ESPP\u2019s equivalence and acceptance assessments. The actions \nare  mainly  related  to  improved  monitoring,  disclosure,  consultation,  and  grievance  redress;  gender  focus; \nappropriate  cumulative  impact  and  strategic  environmental  assessments;  specific  costs  in  environmental \nmanagement plans; and indigenous peoples\u2019 benefits and participation. \n\n \n\n27 ADB.  2017.  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India,  Limited.  Agency  Level  Use  of  Country  Safeguard  System.                               \n\n\f8 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nPOWERGRID  will  also  install  a  state-of-the-art  substation  automation  system  that  will  enable \nthe operators to take necessary actions to manage intermittent renewable energy sources. All of \nthe  identified  subprojects  are  based  on  well-proven  technology  and  fall  within  POWERGRID's \nimplementation capability. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nThe  subproject-level  model  makes  detailed  cost  estimates  for  specific  project-funded \nassets, and financial revenues generated from, and costs incurred related to, these assets. The \nfinancial  viability  of  the  two  subprojects  was  examined  in  advance.  The  subprojects\u2019  financial \ninternal  rates  of  return,  which  were  calculated  in  real  terms,  compare  favorably  with  the \nestimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  value  in  real  terms.  This  substantiates  the \nsubprojects\u2019 financial viability with full cost recovery.30 \n \n26. \nElectricity from the solar parks would displace coal-fired generation from existing plants \n(a  resource  cost  saving)  in  states  with  renewable  energy  shortfalls.  In  light  of  these  benefits, \nand  consistent  with  other  ADB  economic  analyses  of  renewable  energy  transmission,  the \nsubprojects\u2019 economic internal rates of return are expected to exceed the threshold of economic \nviability  established  by  ADB. 31 The  appraised  subprojects  are  thus  assessed  as  financially \nviable and economically sustainable. \n \n27. \nGiven the cost-plus nature of the tariff-setting process, which provides an assured post-\ntax  return  on  equity,  POWERGRID\u2019s  financial  position  remains  healthy  and  robust.  Both \nStandard  &  Poor\u2019s  and  Fitch  Ratings  have  assigned  a  rating  of  BBB\u2013  with  a  stable  outlook \nconsistent  with  the  government\u2019s  sovereign  rating.  POWERGRID\u2019s  revenue  from  operations \ndoubled  in  the  5  years  preceding  FY2016.  POWERGRID  achieved  a  14%  post-tax  return  on \nequity and a debt service coverage ratio of 2.0 in FY2016, and it is also projected to sustain a \nsound  financial  position.  The  company  maintains  adequate  financial  management  capacity \nbased  on  its  navratna  (jewel)  status,  where  the  government  allows  it  a  degree  of  managerial \nand financial autonomy, despite its majority-government ownership. \n \nC. \n \n28. \nPOWERGRID  is  governed  by  corporate  governance  principles  and  systems  as  per \nIndia\u2019s Securities and Exchange Board Regulations, 2015. It has disclosed quarterly corporate \ngovernance  reports  with  certificates \ntransparency,  and \naccountability.  The  corporate  governance  structure  specifies  the  distribution  of  rights  and \nresponsibilities  among  different  stakeholders, \nincluding  a  number  of  committees  and \nindependent  directors.  POWERGRID\u2019s  operations  fall  under  the  regulation  of  the  Central \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission,  which  provides  robust,  tariff-based  remuneration  for  its \ntransmission  services.  POWERGRID  also  has  an  advanced  accounting  system  using \ncomputerization  that  ensures  confidentiality  and  integrity  at  various  levels,  and  its  financial \nmanagement risks are low. \n \n\nto  ensure  corporate \n\nGovernance \n\nfairness, \n\n                                                \n30 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The financial internal rate of return \nof  the  Bhadla  subproject  is  4.90%  (higher  than  its  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  3.92%),  and  that  of  the \nBanaskantha subproject is 4.83% (higher than its weighted average cost of capital of 3.91%). \n\n31 Economic  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The  economic  internal  rate  of \n\nreturn of the Bhadla subproject is 19.22%, and that of the Banaskantha subproject is 18.50%. \n\n\f9 \n\nSafeguards \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n29. \nwith  the  government  and  POWERGRID.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  committee  for  corporate  social  responsibility  (CSR)  has  provided  local \ncommunities  with  various  activities  relating  to  rural  development,  skills  development,  health, \neducation,  and  the  environment,  as  appropriate. 32  The  project  is  designed  to  include \n(i) compensation  for  the  loss  of  crops  and  trees  and  land  damage  based  on  market  value,  \n(ii)  additional  assistance  for  affected  vulnerable  households  under  CSR, 33  and  (iii)  gender \nmainstreaming training programs for POWERGRID and its contractors.34 \n \nE. \n \n31. \nThe  overall  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment,  category  B  for \ninvoluntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. The subprojects will have no \nsignificant  safeguard  impacts.  Two  advance  subprojects  have  already  been  appraised,  and \nenvironmental  and  social  assessments  have  been  completed  on  the  basis  of  CSS.  Each \nsubproject\u2019s environmental and social impacts have been adequately assessed in the IEAR and \nCPTD, and these documents meet the requirements of both the ESPP and the action plan for \nsafeguards in the PAM.35 The environmental impacts of the transmission lines  were minimized \nduring  the  route-selection  process,  and  the  alignments  do  not  pass  through  any  forests.  No \nacquisition  of  private  land  for  the  subprojects  is  foreseen.36 Impacts  during  the  construction  of \nthe  lines  will  be  temporary  and  will  primarily  consist  of  the  loss  of  crops  and  trees,  for  which \naffected persons will be compensated.37 POWERGRID has a good track record and its staff are \nexperienced in monitoring the environmental and social risks of subprojects and conducting the \nnecessary  consultations  and  disclosure.  Any  subsequent  subprojects  will  be  assessed  in \naccordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  ESPP  and  the  action  plan  in  the  PAM,  which  will  be \ntreated  as  safeguard  frameworks  and  guidelines  to  prepare  the  IEAR  and  CPTD.  Project \nimplementation will be monitored continuously in keeping with ADB requirements.38 \n \nF. \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.39 The risks are manageable, and appropriate \nmitigation measures are incorporated. Integrated benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n32 POWERGRID spent more than $18 million equivalent on CSR activities in 2015\u20132016.  \n33 The ESPP\u2019s definition of vulnerable households includes scheduled tribes, scheduled castes, households headed \nby  women,  and  people  with  disabilities  as  certified  by  state  governments.  These  will  be  prioritized  under  CSR \nactivities. \n\n34 The  programs  will  be  implemented  after  training  manuals  are  prepared  for  POWERGRID  and  the  contractors \ncovering equal pay for men and women, the prevention of sexually transmitted infections, and the construction of \nsite facilities suitable for women workers. \n\n35 As a result, these safeguard documents also fully meet ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n36 The land has been acquired or is being transferred from state governments and a state utility to POWERGRID. \n37 With regard to transmission lines, a small square area (0.8\u20131.96 square meters) is requested for each tower. \n38 The  use  of  CSS  will  not  change  ADB\u2019s  monitoring  disclosure  requirements  or  the  role  and  function  of  ADB\u2019s \n\naccountability mechanism. \n\n39 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nCompletion delays \ndue to procurement \nand safeguards \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nDelays in the completion of transmission projects are typically due to the time required \nfor  procurement,  private  land  acquisition,  and  rights-of-way.  These  risk  factors  are \nmitigated for the project. Most of the bids have been advertised and some have already \nbeen  awarded  through  advance  procurement  action.  For  the  subproject  sites, \nPOWERGRID has confirmed that no private land will be acquired, and the impacts of \ntransmission towers and lines are limited to the loss of crops and trees, which will be \naddressed  through  compensation.  Any  subsequent  subprojects  will  be  implemented \nthrough  POWERGRID\u2019s  procurement  and  safeguard  systems,  as  well  as  their  action \nplans and loan and guarantee agreements, and will be monitored by ADB. No safeguard \ncategory A subprojects will be considered under the sector loan. \n\nCounterparty defaults  POWERGRID  is  protected  against  any  immediate  failures  stemming  from  solar  park \ndevelopment or power offtaking under commercial agreements. Specific securities are \nincluded in the form of performance bonds from  solar park developers, and letters of \ncredit  from  offtakers.  In  case  of  any  offtaker  defaults  beyond  these  securities,  the \nregulations  allow  POWERGRID  to  recover  its  losses  from  other  non-defaulting \ncustomers by sharing any increased transmission charges on a pro rata basis. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s regulatory risk is minimal due to the regulator\u2019s good track record and \nthe National Tariff Policy provisions, which specify a full cost pass-through to ensure \nthe  project\u2019s  full  cost  recovery.  The  sector  regulator  has  historically  supported \nPOWERGRID  as  the  central  transmission  utility  and  national  transmission  licensee, \nwith the tariff structure and key tariff components remaining largely unchanged. \n\nRegulatory changes \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, POWERGRID = Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n33. \nThe  government  and  POWERGRID  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, except as \nADB may agree otherwise, as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n34. \nproject, which are set forth in the draft loan and guarantee agreements. \n \n\nThe government and POWERGRID have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n35. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $175,000,000  to  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited,  to  be \nguaranteed  by  India,  for  the  Solar  Transmission  Sector  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan and guarantee agreements presented to the Board; and \nthe  use  of  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited\u2019s  agency  procurement \nsystems, as described in para. 21. \n\n \n\n7 March 2017 \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nShare of clean energy in the power mix increased, overall efficiency of the power system increased, and \nenergy security in India enhanced (Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Missiona and India\u2019s Intended \nNationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changeb) \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \n\nSupply of clean power \nto the national \ntransmission system \nexpanded \n\nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and Baselines \nBy 2022: \n \na.
