I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the additional financing of the Subregional Transport \nProject Preparatory Facility.1 \n \n2.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  has  requested  additional  financing  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to scale up the Subregional Transport Project Preparatory Facility, \nwhich is funded by an ADB technical assistance (TA) loan approved in 2010.2 The additional \nfinancing  will  provide  further  support  in  preparing  high-priority  transport  projects  that  will \nenhance subregional trade. The new loan will be used to prepare railway and road projects in \nBangladesh that are part of the Trans-Asia Railway network and the Asian Highway network. It \nwill also support the executing agencies during initial project implementation. The additional \nfinancing is being processed based on the government\u2019s request, as it is not included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2015\u20132017.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Bangladesh has the potential to become a transport and transshipment center for the \nsubregion. It borders India and Myanmar, and is close to the landlocked countries of Bhutan and \nNepal. Bangladesh has taken many steps to strengthen its regional and international transport \nconnectivity. With the Bhangabandhu Bridge over River Jamuna (the Jamuna Multipurpose \nBridge) and the provision of access to Mongla and Chittagong ports for Bhutan, India, and \nNepal, the main transport corridors in Bangladesh, such as the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor, can \nfacilitate trade between Bangladesh and the northeastern states of India, the Indian state of \nWest Bengal, Bhutan, and Nepal. This increases the potential to attract more foreign and \ndomestic investments. Bangladesh is located on major international trade corridors, as identified \nin  the  South  Asia  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  Regional  Multimodal \nTransport  Study  (SRMTS)4 and  those  projects  linking  South  Asia  with  Southeast  Asian \ncountries, the Asia Highway network, and the Trans-Asian Railway network. However, the \namount of regional trade within South Asia is much smaller than in other similar regions. One of \nthe main reasons for the limited cross-border traffic are missing links and congestion in main \ndomestic corridors, which do not allow operating additional domestic and international traffic. \nAddressing the capacity deficiencies in the domestic transport network and constructing missing \nlinks  will  enable  Bangladesh  to  benefit  more  from  international  trade  and  will  support  the \ncountry\u2019s economic development. \n \n4.  The current TA loan was approved on 3 November 2010 and became effective on 21 \nJuly 2011. It has demonstrated that the project readiness of follow-on road and railway projects \nin Bangladesh has improved. The preparation of projects under the current TA loan has also \nhelped to attract financing for follow-on transport projects by other development partners. The \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010.

", "2 \ncurrent TA loan has been used to prepare design for two loans approved by ADB in 20125 and \n2014.6 The  design  prepared  under  the  current  TA  Loan  has  generated  interest  from  the \ngovernments of the People\u2019s Republic of China and Japan to finance two railway projects in \nBangladesh. \n \n5.  The rating of the current TA loan is \u201con-track\u201d; despite initial delays, it is rated \u201con-track\u201d \nsince the second quarter of 2013. As of 20 August 2015, contracts for $21.8 million equivalent\u2014\nor 99% of the loan amount of $22.1 million equivalent\u2014had been awarded and the cumulative \ndisbursement  was  $18.6  million  equivalent  (84%).  The  original  loan  closing  date  of  31 \nDecember 2013 was extended to 31 December 2015 to allow for the completion of the design \nand  to  provide  sufficient  time  to  support  the  executing  agencies  during  initial  project \nimplementation, especially during procurement for follow-on transport projects and safeguards \nimplementation. Loan covenants and safeguard requirements are being complied with. \n \n6.  Under the current TA loan, one of the follow-on railway projects will require continued \nprocurement support in 2015. Therefore, the loan closing date for the current TA loan needs to \nbe extended until 30 June 2016. \n \n7.  The proposed additional financing will support change in project scope by scaling up the \ncurrent project to cover additional 8 road projects with a total route length of 600 km and 4 \nrailway projects with a total route length of 295 km. The additional financing will help prepare \ndomestic transport projects with high impact on regional trade ready for investment. It will also \nsupport the government during initial project implementation. \n \n8.  The implementation of the current TA loan is considered highly successful, and the \ngovernment has requested ADB to provide additional financing to increase the benefits and \nprepare for the implementation of additional high-priority transport projects with subregional \nimpact.  The  implementation  of  these  projects  is  expected  to  be  financed  under  (i)  the \nmultitranche financing facility for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) \nRailway Connectivity Investment Program, scheduled for approval in 2016; and (ii) the SASEC \nRoad and Trade Facilitation Investment Program, scheduled for approval on a standby basis in \n2017. Both investment programs are included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for \nBangladesh (footnote 3). \n \n9.  The additional financing supports key thematic drivers of ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh,  2011\u20132015:  (i)  good  governance  and  capacity  development,  (ii) \nregional  cooperation,  (iii)  environmental  sustainability  and  climate  resilience,  and  (iv) \npartnerships.7 Investments in key domestic corridors with high regional impact were identified as \npriorities  for  the  transport  sector  and  are  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  strategies  for  the \ntransport sector development. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2012.

The impact will be increased subregional connectivity and trade, aligned with the Sixth \nFive-Year Plan (2011\u20132015).8 The outcome will be improved efficiency in implementing regional \ncooperation  and  integration  (RCI)  transport  projects  and  facilitating  cross-border  traffic  in \nBangladesh. \n \n11.  The impact and outcome statements are unchanged from the original project. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The outputs will be (i) feasibility studies and detailed design of RCI transport projects; \nand (ii) implementation support for RCI transport projects to facilitate government approvals, \nsafeguard implementation, and procurement. \n \n13.  The additional financing will enhance capacity to prepare RCI transport projects and \nimprove project readiness through the provision of feasibility studies, detailed designs,9 and \nimplementation support for regional transport projects. The focus will be on priority transport \ncorridors identified in the SRMTS, Asian Highway network, Trans-Asia Railway network, and \nthose projects linking South Asia with Southeast Asia. At a meeting in Kathmandu, Nepal on 4 \nNovember 2014, the SASEC Transport and Trade Facilitation Working Group endorsed the \npreparation of these priority subregional transport projects. The additional financing will scale-up \nthe preparation of feasibility studies and detailed design as well as provision of implementation \nsupport in order to prepare additional 8 road projects with a total route length of 600 km and 4 \nrailway projects with a total route length of 295 km. A list of the transport projects to be prepared \nunder this loan is in attachment B of the project administration manual (PAM). 10 Any additional \ntransport projects to be financed under additional financing will be selected based on the criteria \ndescribed in attachment B of the PAM. \n \nD.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 9). The implementation arrangements will be same as those for the current \nTA loan, which is performing well and has prepared transport projects for implementation with \nfinancing from ADB and other development partners. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2016\u2013December 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021 \nLoan closing date  30 June 2022 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight bodies  Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges \n(ii)  Executing agencies  Bangladesh Railway and Roads and Highways Department \n(iii) Implementation unit  Dhaka, 1 project director, and 4 staff for the railway component and \n1 project director and 5 staff for the roads component \nConsulting services  Bangladesh Railway  About 1,300 person- $19.0 milliona \ncomponent: QCBS  months \nRoads and  About 450 person- $4.5 milliona \nHighways  months; one \nDepartment  consulting firm and \ncomponent: QCBS  two individual \nconsultants \n ", "5 \nAspects   Arrangements \nRetroactive financing and advance  Retroactive financing and advance contracting is proposed for \ncontracting  consulting services \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements that the government and ADB have agreed \nupon. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \na  Excludes taxes and duties. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Bangladesh Railway, and Roads and Highways Department estimates. \n \n18.  The  additional  financing  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  January  2016  to \nDecember 2021. \n \n19.  International consulting firms and national consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nAdvance contracting and retroactive financing are proposed to improve project readiness. All \nconsultants will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of \n90:10, taking into account the complexity of the large-scale design works. To avoid start-up \ndelays, the government has requested ADB to select consultants on its behalf. The government \nwill negotiate and enter into agreements while ADB will play an active facilitation role. \n \n20.  The additional financing will be used for a variation of an ongoing consulting contract \nunder the railway component of the current TA loan. Additional design works became necessary \nduring  the  implementation  of  the  current  TA  loan  because  of  changes  in  the  technical \nspecifications  and  the  employer\u2019s  requirements.  The  contract  variation  refers  only  to  such \ngeographical sections of the railway lines that were part of the original scope of works of the \nconsultants. For these sections, the ongoing contract amount of $12.0 million will be scaled up \nby $4.5 million for additional tasks under the rail component. The consulting firm has been \nselected through international competitive bidding using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. Consultants submitted full technical proposals. The \nfirm has performed well, has not been sanctioned, and has delivered the expected outputs on \ntime and in the required quality. The consultants, who are already familiar with the section, will \ncarry out the additional design work. This will save time and money associated that would be \nneeded for a new consultant, who would have to become familiar with the relevant section, the \nenvironment, and previous studies and surveys. \n \n21.  ADB approved advance contracting of consulting services on 19 June 2015 and the \ngovernment requested retroactive financing for consulting services. Up to 20% of the loan \nproceeds will be eligible for retroactive financing, provided that expenditures are incurred on \nconsulting services for the overall facility in accordance with agreed procedures and before the \neffective  date  but  no  earlier than  12  months before the  date  of the loan  agreement. The \ngovernment has been informed that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing \ndoes not in any way commit ADB to finance the facility. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  All  proposed  railway  and  road  projects  that  will  be  prepared  under  the  additional \nfinancing are in line with the selection criteria described in the PAM (footnote 9). All railway and \nroad sections to be prepared under the additional financing are on high-priority corridors for \nregional connectivity as identified in the SRMTS, Asian Highway network, Trans-Asia Railway \nnetwork, and those projects linking South Asia with Southeast Asia. All projects were also \n ", "6 \nidentified as priority projects in the national sector planning documents of Bangladesh, i.e. the \nRailway Sector Master Plan toward 203011 approved in 2013 and the Roads Master Plan. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  The follow-on transport projects prepared under the facility will support Bangladesh's \neconomic growth and reduce poverty by connecting major markets in the country and providing \ncommunities with access to economic and social services. It will also contribute to regional \ncooperation  and  integration  by  strengthening  connectivity  with  neighboring  countries  and \nincreasing  the  trade  competitiveness  of  Bangladesh.  A  preliminary  study  on  transit  traffic \nthrough  Bangladesh  estimates  that  improvements  to  the  country\u2019s  sections  of  priority \nsubregional transport corridors could facilitate the movement of about 18 million tons of freight \nper year in Bhutan, India, and Nepal. \n \n24.  The  facility  will  combine  support  for  project  feasibility  studies,  detailed  design, \nprocurement, and safeguard implementation, ensuring that (i) follow-on transport projects will be \nimplemented  without  delay,  (ii)  the  positive  impacts  of  follow-on  transport  projects  will \nmaterialize  without  delay,  and  (iii)  the  government  will  minimize  commitment  and  interest \ncharges arising under follow-on loans. The facility will help the government ensure the economic \nand financial viability of transport corridor projects with subregional impacts, and will mitigate the \nsocial and environmental risks of any follow-on transport projects. \n \n25.  By  providing  detailed  design,  procurement,  and  safeguard  implementation  support \nimmediately after the feasibility study, the facility will accelerate the start of physical works of the \nfollow-on  loans  by  at  least  1  year  compared  with  projects  processed  under  conventional \nschemes. Currently, project executing agencies in Bangladesh can start recruiting consultants \nonly after the project loans have been approved. By contrast, the facility will allow executing \nagencies to undertake detailed design immediately after completion of feasibility studies. \nC.  Governance \n26.  Financial  management.  Both  the  Roads  and  Highways  Department  (RHD)  and \nBangladesh  Railway  have  implemented  ADB-funded  projects  and  are  familiar  with  project \nfinancial  accounting  methods  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures.  For  the  facility,  one \naccountant will be included in each project implementation unit. The RHD and Bangladesh \nRailway have participated in workshops run by ADB consultants on good practice of financial \nmanagement systems. The overall financial management capacity is adequate but, given the \ncountry risk rating, the project risk is considered moderate. \n \n27.  Procurement and anticorruption measures. Recruitment of consultants will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). After ADB selects the consultants, the executing agencies will negotiate contracts \nwith them. This recruitment process will help to ensure that consulting services are available in \na timely manner. The procurement rules for the selection of contractors required by international \nfinancial institutions such as ADB are considered sufficiently robust to deter corruption during \nbid selection. National procurement regulations have also improved recently through the Public \nProcurement Act, 2006, and the related Public Procurement Rules (2008) with subsequent \namendments.  During  implementation  of  the  facility,  reports  will  be  submitted  to  executing \nagencies and ADB in line with submission milestones to ensure the quality and timeliness of \nconsultants' work. \n \n                                                \n11 Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Railways. 2013.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  Bangladesh  Railway,  and  the  RHD.  The  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The facility is not expected to have any impacts on gender and social dimensions. \nFollow-on transport projects will be prepared in compliance with ADB's Handbook on Poverty \nand Social Analysis: A Working Document (2012).12 Gender, labor, HIV/AIDS, and other social \nrisks related to follow-on transport projects will be assessed, and a mitigation plan will be \nprepared to address those issues. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  The  facility  will  support  the  development  of  environmentally  and  socially  viable \ninvestment projects. Because the facility is focused on project preparation, it is not expected to \nhave any adverse social and environmental consequences. The facility is categorized C for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Follow-on transport projects will \nbe designed in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government \nguidelines, regulations, and policies. During the feasibility studies, the consultants will prepare \nenvironmental impact assessments or initial environmental examinations, as applicable, along \nwith climate risk and vulnerability assessments, including environmental management plans for \nthe selected transport projects. Similarly, resettlement planning, indigenous peoples planning, \nand gender analyses will be done for the selected transport projects during this stage. Capacity \nbuilding on safeguards implementation and coordination will be carried out in parallel for the \nRHD. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.13 The integrated benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of public  Direct payment procedures will be adopted.
