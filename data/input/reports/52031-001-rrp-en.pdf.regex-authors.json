THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Vanuatu for the Greater Port Vila Urban Resilience Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve urban resilience in Greater Port Vila (GPV) through capacity \nbuilding, institutional strengthening, and the construction of two multipurpose emergency shelters. \nThe project is guided by the Greater Port Vila Resilient Urban Development Strategy and Action \nPlan (GPV RUDSAP), which envisions that, by 2030, GPV is a safe, inclusive, resilient, and \nvibrant  economic  hub  based  on  sustainable  development.2  About  15,500  people  in  the \nmunicipality of Port Vila will benefit from the project, of whom about half are women.3 \n \n3.  The project also supports efforts to recover from the impacts of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic and Tropical Cyclone Harold through (i) preventive measures for health and \nsocial safety nets; (ii) a focus on the vulnerable, women, and the \u201cnew poor\u201d;4 and (iii) partnerships \nand investments that generate jobs and stimulate the local economy. The project is aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s Vanuatu Recovery Strategy 2020\u20132023: Tropical Cyclone Harold & COVID-19.5 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n4.  Vanuatu ranks first globally as the economy most exposed to natural hazards based on \nvulnerability, and is highly exposed to geophysical hazards, including volcanic eruptions and \nearthquakes.6 While not classified as a fragile and conflict-affected situation, Vanuatu is a small \nisland  developing  state  and  shares  many  of  the  characteristics  of  fragile  states\u2014weak \ngovernance  and  low  capacity,  geographic  isolation,  high  cost  of  doing  business,  frequent \ngovernment changes, and vulnerability to climate change and disaster-related shocks.7 \n \n5.  Rapid urban population growth. Port Vila is the capital city and economic gateway to \nVanuatu, with an urban population of about 41,326 in 2019 (an increase from 38,714 people in \n2016). Port Vila is a first-tier urban settlement of about 12 square kilometers (km2) with a formally \nestablished municipal council. The population density is 3,444 people per km2 and about 30% of \nthe population live in informal and squatter settlements.8 GPV, comprising Port Vila and the \n \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Vanuatu, Ministry of Internal Affairs. 2020.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nsurrounding peri-urban areas in Shefa Province, is defined for urban planning purposes as \ncovering an area of 289 km2. The population of GPV is projected to increase to 112,140 by 2030 \nfrom about 84,852 in 2018 (an increase from 81,712 people in 2016) driven by rapid internal \nmigration from the outer islands.9 Population growth has increased the pressures on existing \ninfrastructure and services and worsened inequality. The combined impact of COVID-19 and \nfrequent tropical cyclones also contribute to deepening inequality. \n \n6.  Vulnerability to climate change and disasters. The impacts of existing and future \nclimate change on GPV include (i) an increase in both average annual rainfall and the intensity \nand frequency of extreme rainfall events; (ii) sea level rise; (iii) storm surge; (iv) increased \ntemperatures; and (v) changes in wind and wave climate, resulting in potential increases in \nextreme wave heights, and ocean acidity. About 41% of the tropical cyclones that affected \nVanuatu between 1981 and 2010 were category 3 or stronger.10 The social and economic impact \nof disasters caused by natural hazards, such as earthquakes and strong winds, is significant. \nAt the 100-year mean return period, about 85% of the buildings and population are exposed to \nmoderate levels, and 15% to high levels, of potential risk of earthquakes and winds.11 In 2015, \nTropical  Cyclone  Pam,  a  category  5  cyclone,  caused  an  estimated  total  loss  of  about \n$450 million\u2014equivalent to 64% of the gross domestic product of Vanuatu. About 65,000 people \nwere displaced from their homes and about 50% of private households in Shefa Province sought \nshelter.12 In 2020, Vanuatu experienced the impacts of a dual emergency\u2014category 5 Tropical \nCyclone Harold in April and COVID-19, which necessitated border closure affecting tourism, \ndisaster recovery operations, and trade.13 Vanuatu has been in a state of emergency since \n26 March 2020, and the economy is expected to contract by 9.8% in 2020.14 COVID-19 is \nexacerbating the challenges women face in all spheres, including employment, and is likely to \nincrease the incidence and severity of gender-based violence (GBV). \n \n7.  Traditional temporary evacuation centers unsatisfactory. Churches, schools, and \ncommunity halls are often designated as evacuation centers. However, these buildings are not \nalways designed to withstand strong winds; are unsuitable for long stays; do not have sufficient \nwater, toilets, or cooking facilities; and may not meet the needs and priorities of both men and \nwomen. Additional challenges with such evacuation centers include the high cost of cleanup and \nrestoration of facilities after use, the urgent need for the facilities to resume normal operations, \nlimited capacity and access to centers, and poor connectivity to hospitals  and emergency \nservices. It is recognized that an emergency shelter needs to have a daily function or use to \nensure a regular source of revenue to cover the costs for operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \n8.  Need for greater urban resilience in GPV. Building urban resilience requires a holistic \nand coordinated approach to city development and its application to future projects and policies \nbased  on  existing  policy  directions,  initiatives,  and  disaster  and  climate  change  risk \n \n9  Government of Vanuatu, National Statistics Office. 2011. 2009 National Population and Housing Census.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nassessments.15 Urban infrastructure development in GPV has occurred with limited planning or \nprioritization  of  investments:  (i)  development  has  been  influenced  by the  informal  systems \nestablished under customary land ownership; (ii) investments have not contributed to a common \nvision; (iii) investments have not considered the rural\u2013urban synergies within the GPV area; and \n(iv) there  has  been  limited  focus  on  improving  safety for  women  and  children,  enhancing \npedestrian access and the connectivity of public spaces, and retrofitting existing buildings to \nenhance vibrancy in Port Vila. To address these shortcomings, the GPV RUDSAP includes \nprioritized investments and emphasizes greater resilience in urban planning, development, and \nmanagement for sustained inclusive economic growth. \n \n9.  Limited partnerships and capacity in strengthening urban resilience. The Ministry of \nInternal Affairs (MOIA) oversees local government and is mandated to coordinate urban planning \nand development in Port Vila. The MOIA coordinates with the National Disaster Management \nOffice on disaster risk management efforts at the subnational level. In 2020, the Department of \nUrban Affairs and Planning (DUAP) was established to focus on the needs of municipalities as \ngrowing urban centers. Port Vila Municipal Council (PVMC) is responsible for the administration \nof the municipality, including O&M of municipal assets. It operates on corporate principles and \nprepares 3-year corporate plans and annual business plans. Yet PVMC is hampered by its poor \nfinancial capacity, which constrains its ability to resource and finance the requirements for this \nrole. Property taxes account for about 59% of its income. The present property valuation roll dates \nfrom 2003 and, while updated in 2013, it was not published in the Official Gazette.16 In addition, \nduring and immediately after disasters, community disaster and climate change committees \n(CDCCCs) are responsible for communities\u2019 disaster response. Greater formal and informal \ncollaboration, training, and partnerships are needed across different subnational government \nagencies and with communities to promote local disaster risk and climate change adaptation \nsolutions. Women employees are a minority within the MOIA (37%); PVMC (17%, excluding \ncouncilors); and on CDCCCs (only about 30% of which include women), and closer reflection of \nsocietal makeup would better support partnerships. \n \n10.  Lessons. The project addresses issues of effectiveness and sustainability identified by the \ncompleted  Port  Vila  Urban  Development  Project  and  other  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nprojects, and in consultation with development partners and the Vanuatu Project Management \nUnit.17 Lessons reflected in project design include the importance of aligning investments with a \ncommon vision guided by a Port Vila urban development strategy; focusing on building PVMC\u2019s \ncapacity for O&M of assets; using local experts to strengthen partnerships in the municipal urban \nward  units  and  communities  for  greater  resilience;  allowing  enough  time  to  complete  land \n \n15 Beca International Consultants Ltd, GNS Science, and National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research. 2016. \nUrban Risk Management Strategy: Risk Mapping and Planning for Urban Preparedness.

Strategic alignment. The project aligns with the government\u2019s GPV RUDSAP, which \nprovides a strategic road map for resilient urban development in GPV to 2030. It contributes to \nthe achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 1, 5, 6, 11, 13, and 16; and is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The project supports the government\u2019s \nVanuatu  Recovery  Strategy  2020\u20132023  in  disaster  preparedness,  response,  and  recovery. \nConsultations with development partners focused on the project design and project preparedness, \nand synergies with ongoing sector and institutional activities. \n \nB.  Project Description \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: By 2030, GPV is a safe, inclusive, resilient, \nand vibrant economic hub based on sustainable development (footnote 2). The project will have \nthe following outcome: Urban resilience in GPV improved (footnote 1). This will be achieved \nthrough four outputs. \n \n13.  Output 1: Resilience in urban planning and management strengthened. The output will \nstrengthen the capacity of PVMC and the DUAP of the MOIA. The project will (i) support the DUAP \nin urban planning and administration for greater resilience and improved service delivery, including \nby updating the GPV RUDSAP and preparing the Port Vila livable city action plan; (ii) review \nPVMC\u2019s 3-year corporate plan and annual business plan to ensure appropriate planning for asset \nmaintenance, disaster response, and gender targets; (iii) review and expand PVMC\u2019s asset register; \nand (iv) support PVMC in financial planning, including updating the property valuation roll and \ntaxes.18 The output will also support the establishment of an information-sharing network between \nPVMC and other municipal councils to share experiences and lessons through peer-to-peer \nlearning. \n \n14.  Output 2: Urban resilience enhanced through local partnerships. The output will \nfacilitate  vertical  and  horizontal  partnerships  and  coordination19  through  activities  including \ntraining ward secretaries in disaster risk management and climate change adaptation; financing \npublic campaigns on climate change adaptation and disaster risk management with a particular \nemphasis on the poor, women, and vulnerable households; and preparing inclusive and gender-\nresponsive emergency preparedness plans for each shelter constructed.  \n \n15.  Output 3: Resilient urban infrastructure constructed in Greater Port Vila. The output \nwill finance two multipurpose and gender-responsive emergency shelters that include sanitation \nfacilities, office space, and market area improvements. The shelters are one of the seven areas \nof investment prioritized in the GPV RUDSAP.20 They will be located at Seaside Showground in \nCenter ward and at Freshwota in Freshwota-Tasariki ward. Geographic information system \nhazard risk and exposure maps were used as an initial screening tool to determine the location \n \n18 These activities will complement the ongoing efforts by the Programme for Technical Assistance to Pacific Island \nCountries that is being implemented by Local Government New Zealand, which supports local government authorities \nin Pacific island countries. \n19 Vertical partnerships include those among the MOIA, PVMC, and wards. Horizontal partnerships include those \nbetween PVMC, wards, CDCCCs, and local stakeholders such as businesses. \n20 The strategy includes 67 interventions with a cost estimate of $180 million, of which 30 interventions are prioritized \nacross 7 broad areas totaling $25 million. \n ", "5 \nof candidate shelters.21 Final selection was based on ward priority, community accessibility, \nequitable spatial distribution, and maximizing the number of beneficiaries. \n \n16.  The two shelters can help about 905 potential evacuees avoid death, disability, and \ndiseases during disasters. The design of the two shelters for use outside emergency situations in \nthe country is an innovation introduced by this project. They will include communal space that can \nbe used for economic activities (e.g., a marketplace), community meetings, and gender-sensitive \npost-disaster response. For instance, movable partitions will be available to cordon off part of the \nopen space on the ground floor for emergency triage activities. Each shelter incorporates these \nunique design features that enable them to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic or future \nhealth emergencies. Each shelter will be equipped with water supply, separate sanitation facilities \nfor men and women, and a kitchen for hygienic food preparation. All facilities will be accessible to \npeople living with disabilities.  \n \n17.  Output 4: Asset management and institutional capacity strengthened. The output will \nimprove the MOIA\u2019s capacity to develop, implement, and monitor projects; and will strengthen \nPVMC\u2019s capacity to operate and maintain shelters constructed under the project. Sustainable \nO&M will be ensured through the implementation of the Asset Management Strategy that was \ndeveloped during project preparation, which includes support to PVMC in establishing and \nmanaging  a  dedicated  major  maintenance  reserve  account  to  finance  future  repairs  and \nrehabilitation of the shelters. This will benefit both agencies\u2019 future investment activities. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n18.  The project\u2019s approach to urban development strongly emphasizes capacity building and \ninstitutional strengthening, and the practical application of the GPV RUDSAP in planning and \nfinancing  infrastructure  to  help  build  urban  resilience  and  address  the  causes  of  fragility. \nThe approach  builds  on  and  implements  activities  developed  through  technical  assistance, \nincluding the GPV RUDSAP (footnote 2), a geographic information system platform that used \nhazard risk and exposure data sets and associated spatial maps (footnote 21), and a strategic \nprocurement plan.22 The approach supports the government\u2019s decentralization framework for \nurban service delivery and governance; focuses on effectiveness and sustainability through the \nimplementation of a capacity development plan and the Asset Management Strategy, featuring \nan O&M plan for each project asset; and responds to COVID-19 and Tropical Cyclone Harold by \nfocusing on localized preparedness for, response to, and recovery from disasters and health \nemergencies. \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $11.77 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).23 \n \n20.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $9.640 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. Climate adaptation is \nestimated to cost $4.820 million based on calculations outlined in the climate change assessment.24 \n \n \n21 ADB. 2016.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n25.  The  two  multipurpose  emergency  shelters  are  designed  to  withstand  cyclones  and \nearthquakes, and benefit communities throughout the year. Each shelter will be built in an area \n ", "8 \nthat is not susceptible to high tide storm surge or localized flooding and is protected against high \nwinds. Hazard mapping confirmed the location of these sites and their degree of exposure and \nvulnerability to natural hazards. The shelters will be built with the required structural resilience to \nwithstand extreme storm conditions and small to moderate earthquakes at 100-year mean return \nperiod, following the national building code and international best practice for resilient buildings. \nThey are designed to use locally available materials and techniques commonly applied in Vanuatu \nto enable upkeep by local firms. The designs build on the National Disaster Management Office\u2019s \nminimum requirements for evacuation centers and incorporate design features that enable the \nshelters to be used during COVID-19 or future health emergencies. The cost estimates are based \non actual rates for buildings constructed under the Port Vila Urban Development Project, other \nconstruction contract rates, and cost estimates for market improvements. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n26.  The two multipurpose emergency shelters are cost-effective solutions. Standard cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis is not applicable for this project, because the quantifiable benefits, in the form of \navoided deaths and disabilities of residents,25 that could result from the establishment of shelters \nwould yield disproportionately low benefits relative to investment costs. The two shelters can help \nabout 905 potential evacuees avoid death, disability, and diseases during disasters. Thus, a least-\ncost analysis was conducted, which found that multipurpose emergency shelters constructed with \nconcrete block walls and reinforced concrete columns are a more cost-effective solution, with \n9%\u201317% lower costs per evacuee, than similar shelters made from light-gauge galvanized steel. \nThe  two  shelters  will  also  provide  employment  opportunities  to  about  339  people  through \nimproved market area development, and will serve about 15,500 people at different times and in \nvarious capacities (e.g., as an emergency shelter, marketplace and/or community center). \n \n27.  The fee that could be earned from the use of the shelters during normal times would not \ncover the full investment costs. An incremental recurrent cost analysis was conducted, which \nconcluded that the incremental yearly cost required to operate and maintain two shelters averages \nVt5.8 million, or about 10% of the fee expected to be collected by the shelters. The remaining \n90% constitutes revenue surplus, a portion of which will be kept in the major maintenance reserve \naccount for future repairs and rehabilitation.26 Thus, adequate funds should be available to cover \nthe full O&M cost of the shelters and ensure the financial sustainability of their operations. The \nproposed  fee  for  facility  uses  during  normal  times  is  considered  affordable.  The  Asset \nManagement Strategy will help to ensure that the project assets are operated and maintained.27  \n \nC.  Sustainability \n28.  The project will provide financing to build urban resilience and address the causes of \nfragility  through  an  emphasis  on  capacity  building,  improved  forecasting  and  planning,  and \ninstitutional development. PVMC relies on property taxes and other fees since it does not receive \ncentral budget transfer for its operations. The project will implement the Asset Management \nStrategy, set forth in the PAM (footnote 23), which addresses the technical, administrative, and \nfinancial requirements for O&M of the project assets. Based on the Asset Management Strategy, \neach shelter will have an O&M plan outlining these requirements. To ensure that the shelters are \nadequately maintained and funds are available, the project will support PVMC in setting up a \nmajor maintenance reserve account dedicated to the O&M of the project assets, completing a \n \n25  Measured in disability-adjusted life-years because of disasters caused by natural hazards. \n26 The amount will be determined during project implementation, based on detailed designs and actual cost of O&M. \n27 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nproperty valuation review, and reviewing alternative revenue-generating streams. ADB and the \ngovernment will review the Asset Management Strategy and update it, as needed. \n \nD.  Governance \n29.  The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate, based on a financial \nmanagement assessment completed for the MFEM, the MOIA, and PVMC. The project will \nstrengthen the capacity of the PCU staff in financial management and internal and external audit \noversight. The PCU and the project implementation unit will have qualified staff. While the limited \nnumber of available skilled staff presents an inherent risk to project effectiveness, this will be \nmitigated during implementation through the consulting packages. The MFEM and the MOIA will \nrecruit project assistance and implementation consultants to support project management and \nprovide training in ADB financial management and reporting procedures, project accounting, \nfunds flow management, and procurement. The Office of the General Auditor will recruit an \nexternal auditor acceptable to ADB to assist in annual project audits. \n \n30.  The  project  procurement  classification  is  B  with  risk  mitigating  actions.  A  strategic \nprocurement  plan  has  been  prepared  based  on  the  institutional  procurement  capacity \nassessments carried out in 2020, and a 2017 country and sector and/or agency procurement risk \nassessment report. The MFEM has experience in implementing ADB-financed projects and is \nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s procurement procedures under the 2017 procurement framework. The MOIA \nhas dedicated procurement officers with some experience with projects funded by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners. Procurement under the project is not complex and will be done by the PCU \nwith support from the consultants and the MFEM. The project allocates sufficient resources for \nprocurement training, contract management, and ADB oversight. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the MFEM, the MOIA, and PVMC. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n32.  Poverty  targeting  is  general  intervention.  By  working  with  ward  secretaries  and \ncommunities, the project will use a place-based approach by targeting an entire community to \nidentify (i) climate change and disaster risk management issues in neighborhoods, and (ii) the \npoor  and  vulnerable  households  in  each  ward.  These  challenges  will  be  transformed  into \nmessages  for  public  awareness-raising  and  addressed  in  emergency  preparedness  plans. \nThe multipurpose emergency shelters will be accessible to all community members and will \nstrengthen  community  social  cohesion.  The  shelters  will  be  inclusive,  as  they  will  provide \nemployment opportunities and support income generation for men, women, and youth; and are \ndesigned to reflect community priorities and characteristics. \n \n33.  The project is categorized gender equity theme. Women are rarely key stakeholders in \nurban planning and design and, as a result, urban infrastructure does not always meet their needs \nor priorities. Key gender issues include limited participation by women and lack of female \nrepresentation in leadership roles in decision-making, high levels of gender-based violence \n(GBV), limited access to employment and skills development, and poor market conditions and \nfacilities. About 60% of women have experienced some form of abuse from an intimate partner at \n ", "10 \nleast once in their lifetime, with 21% left with permanent injuries.28 The project will promote gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment through meaningful participation and inclusion of women in \nleadership  and  decision-making  opportunities;  training  opportunities  for  women;  specific \nmeasures to respond to GBV, including public campaigns and GBV referral pathways; and \ngender-responsive resilient infrastructure. The MOIA will monitor the gender action plan will be \nmonitored on a quarterly basis using a template provided by ADB. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.29 \n \n35.  Environment (category B). The two multipurpose shelters are expected to have positive \nimpacts. Potential negative impacts arising from construction activities will be limited in scope and \nscale, and can be substantially mitigated by good construction management. Proper disposal \n(including reuse or recycling) of materials is part of the environment assessment and included in \nthe environmental management plan. An initial environment examination has been prepared for the \ntwo shelters. \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A resettlement plan has been prepared for the two \nshelters, which are located on government land. There may be partial impacts on trees and \ntemporary displacement of market vendors to an alternative market adjacent to the existing site, \nwith minimal to no impacts on incomes. \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to impact any distinct and \nvulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, as \nVanuatu\u2019s population comprises mostly Melanesians. Local communities will receive culturally \nappropriate benefits and will actively participate in the project. \n \n38.  Safeguard planning documents are prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement and Government of Vanuatu regulations. The MOIA will submit semiannual safeguard \nmonitoring reports to ADB and, with support from project consultants, will monitor compliance with \nsafeguards. A grievance redress mechanism will be established to address issues and grievances \nin a timely and effective manner. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n39.
